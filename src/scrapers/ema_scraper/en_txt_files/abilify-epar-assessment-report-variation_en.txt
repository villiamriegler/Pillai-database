2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
The applicant submitted a type II variation application to propose changes in SmPC sections 4.1 and 4.2 
regarding the treatment of schizophrenia in adolescents from “aged 15 years and older” to “aged 13 years 
and older”, and the corresponding changes in SmPC section 4.2 from “below 15 years” to “below 13 years” 
and the package leaflet as a new therapeutic indication (extension of target population for the same disease, 
based on a different age range). 
In  general,  there  is  consensus  that  schizophrenia  is  a  severe  psychiatric  disorder  both  in  childhood  and 
adolescence as well as in adulthood. The lifetime prevalence of schizophrenia is approximately 1%. It is 
assumed that only 0.1 to 1% of all schizophrenic psychoses manifest themselves before the age of 10, and 
70% of all schizophrenic disorders occur between the age of 20 and 45 (Remschmidt & Theisen, 2005). 
The prevalence rate of very early-onset schizophrenia (manifestation before the age of 12) is less than one 
child in 10,000 children between 2 and 12 years of age (Burd & Kerbeshian, 1987). It is estimated that 
childhood-onset  schizophrenia  is  approximately  50  times  less  frequent  than  adult-onset  schizophrenia. 
There is a remarkable increase of schizophrenia after the 13th year of life (Remschmidt et al., 1994), and the 
prevalence of schizophrenia among adolescents has been estimated to be as high as 0.5% (Gillberg et al, 
1986). 
Assessment report  
EMA/702260/2016 
Page 5/54 
 
  
  
 
The course of the disease in the adolescent population is variable. Some adolescents with schizophrenia 
experience only one cycle of these phases, although most have multiple cycles (McClellan et al, 1993; Werry 
et  al,  1991).  The  long-term  outcome  of  adolescents  diagnosed  with  schizophrenia  has  been  studied  by 
several investigators and psychiatrists in follow-up studies. In the majority of cases schizophrenia turned out 
to  be  a  chronic  or  relapsing  disorder  with  only  a  minority  of  patients  that  were  fully  employed  or  were 
attending school full-time (Werry et al, 1991; Tsai & Champine, 2004). 
In a published retrospective study (Krausz & Muller-Thomsen, 1993), only 37% and 42% of patients had no 
symptoms and no findings after follow-up examinations at 5 years and 11 years, respectively. Moreover, 
21%  and  20%  of  the  patients  were  hospitalized  for  the  entire  6  months  preceding  the  follow-up 
examinations at 5 and 11 years, respectively. 
Aripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic that is approved via the centralised procedure in the European Union 
(EU)  as  different  pharmaceutical  forms  in  multiple  indications  (Abilify  -  EMEA/H/C/000471).  In  the  EU 
aripiprazole is approved for: 
•  Treatment of schizophrenia in adults and adolescents (ages 15 years and older) (oral formulations) 
•  Treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar I disorder in adults (oral formulations) 
•  Treatment up to 12 weeks of moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar I disorder in adolescents 
aged 13 years and older (oral formulations) 
•  Prevention of a new manic episode in adults who experienced predominantly manic episodes and 
whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment (oral formulations) 
•  Rapid control of agitation and disturbed behaviours in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with 
manic episodes in bipolar I disorder, when oral therapy is not appropriate (immediate-release IM 
formulation) 
•  Maintenance  treatment  of  schizophrenia  in  adult  patients  stabilised  with  oral  aripiprazole 
(prolonged-release suspension for injection formulation, Abilify Maintena, EMEA/H/C/002755) 
This assessment of extension of indication discusses the results of two completed clinical trials that address 
the requirements of the Paediatric Investigation Plan (EMEA-000235-PIP02-10-M02) for the treatment of 
schizophrenia in patients 13 to 17 years of age in order to demonstrate the maintenance of effects: 
•  Trial  31-09-266:  A  phase  3  long-term  multicentre,  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled 
study  enrolling  patients  in  the  US,  Russia,  Romania,  India,  Philippines,  Malaysia,  and  Taiwan  to 
evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of aripiprazole as maintenance treatment in adolescent 
patients aged 13 to 17 years with schizophrenia. 
•  Trial 31-09-267: A Long-term, multicentre, open-label Study to evaluate the Safety and Tolerability 
of  flexible-dose  oral  Aripiprazole  (OPC-14597)  as  Maintenance  Treatment  in  Adolescent  Patients 
with Schizophrenia or Child and Adolescent Patients with Bipolar I Disorder, Manic or mixed Episode 
with or without Psychotic Features 
Trial 31-09-267 was conducted as a post-approval commitment to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) 
Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) and was later added to the Abilify Schizophrenia 
PIP by the Paediatric Committee (PDCO) of the EMA. 
The focus of the submission is: 
•  To compare the safety results for the use of aripiprazole in Trial 31-09-267 in younger paediatric 
subjects (ages 10 to 14 years) with safety results in older paediatric subjects (ages 15 to 17 years); 
Assessment report  
EMA/702260/2016 
Page 6/54 
 
  
  
•  To demonstrate the safety of aripiprazole in Trial 31-09-267 for selected safety topics required by 
the CHMP and PDCO, ie, sexual maturation and growth (Tanner Staging), cognitive adverse effects 
assessed  using  the  New  York  Assessment  for  Adverse  Cognitive  Effects  of  Neuropsychiatric 
Treatment  (NY-AACENT),  special  interest  adverse  events  (AEs)  relating  to  sedation/somnolence, 
and special interest AEs relating to metabolic measures (i.e., glucose, weight gain, and prolactin). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The present variation concerns a new therapeutic indication for the paediatric population. ABILIFY will be 
indicated  for  the  treatment  of  schizophrenia  in  adolescents  aged  13  years  and  older.  A  complete 
environmental risk assessment (ERA) was previously assessed and approved for aripiprazole; a PECsurfacewater  
of 0.15 µg/L calculated with a default Fpen of 0.01/DOSEai of 30 mg and a PEC/PNEC below 1 (0.58) were 
obtained.  
For the current type II variation the applicant presented two exposure approaches: 
a)  With Prevalence data (total population – adult and paediatric) 
Two different values for PECsurfacewater based on refined Fpen calculations of prevalence data for the sought 
indication: 0.5% and 2.2% as median and highest prevalence of schizophrenia were determined. The PNEC 
resulted from the toxicity and environmental fate studies already performed and approved for the medicinal 
product marketing authorisation.  
The most conservative PEC/PNEC ratios compared with the previously approved environmental exposure are 
summarised below. Some results (in bold) were corrected by the assessor, since the applicant in its ERA 
report considered wrongly these values.

b)  With Sales / Forecast data (total population – adult and paediatric) 
Based on the IMS sales data of aripiprazole (2011–2013) was concluded that 386692 person/year (who 
received  15  mg  daily)  were  treated  with  aripiprazole.  This  stands  for  8.8%  of  4.4  million  adults  with 
schizophrenia. Taking the highest prevalence of 2.2%, the applicant calculated 96800 new cases / year of 
which 5.2% (5033) are adolescent between 10-14 years of age. 
The forecast consummation data for the year 2019 was estimated as 3801.31 Kg (growth rate of ~9%). A 
refined PEC of 0.000764 µg/L and a ratio PEC/PNEC surfacewater of 0.003 were determined taking into account 
a Fpen based on this estimated consummation data  and the total population for EU in 2020.  
 During  the  procedure,  the  applicant  was  requested  to  discuss  the  possible  significant  environmental 
exposure conditioned by the increase of the therapeutic use (adolescents in the 13-15 age range).  The 
applicant updated the ERA and PEC /PNEC ratios were recalculated taking into account the addition of both 
PECs surface water: paediatric population and adult / adolescent population. Having reviewed the data, the 
Assessment report

CHMP concluded that no significant increase of environmental exposure to this medicinal product was to be 
expected. 
The questions posed by the assessor have been adequately addressed.  
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Considering the above data, aripiprazole should be used according to the precautions stated in the SmPC in 
order to minimise any potential risks to the environment. 
3.  Clinical aspects 
3.1.  Clinical efficacy 
3.1.1.  Main study(ies) 
The efficacy information submitted in this application is provided by 2 long-term trials, Trial 31-09-266 and 
Trial 031-09-267.  
Study 31-09-266 
A  Long-Term  Multicenter,  Randomized,  Double-blind,  Placebo-controlled  Study  to  Evaluate  the  Efficacy, 
Safety, and Tolerability of Aripiprazole (OPC-14597) as Maintenance Treatment in Adolescent Patients with 
Schizophrenia. 
Methods 
This  was  a  placebo-controlled  relapse-prevention  trial  conducted  in  the  US,  Russia,  Romania,  India, 
Philippines,  Malaysia,  and  Taiwan.  Trial  31-09-266  had  a  screening  period,  three  phases  (Conversion, 
Stabilization, and Double-blind Maintenance), and a follow-up period. The duration of this trial from first 
subject enrolled to last subject completed was approximately 5 years, including a 3-year recruitment period. 
Individual participation for subjects, who completed the trial, ranged from a minimum of approximately 60 
weeks to a maximum of 89 weeks. Length of participation varied depending on the screening duration (3 to 
42 days), the time required for conversion to aripiprazole monotherapy (0 to 6 weeks), the time required to 
achieve stability on oral aripiprazole (7 to 21 weeks), the duration of maintenance prior to any possible 
exacerbation of psychotic symptoms (up to 52 weeks), and the need for 4-week post-trial follow-up.

Schematic representation of the design for trial 31-09-266 
Study participants 
Eligible subjects were male or female adolescent, aged 13 to 17 years, who met the current diagnostic 
criteria of schizophrenia, as defined by DSM-IV-TR criteria and confirmed by the Kiddie Schedule for 
Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Present and Lifetime version (K-SADS-PL), and a history (as per 
subject, family, or healthcare provider, or by previous medical records) of the illness (diagnosis or 
symptoms) for at least 6 months prior to screening, and were able to comply with protocol requirements. 
Subjects were excluded from the trial based on a significant risk of committing suicide based on history 
(e.g., suicide attempt in the past 1 year) or routine psychiatric status examination or met DSM-IV-TR criteria 
for substance dependence (including alcohol and benzodiazepines, but excluding caffeine and nicotine) 
within 180 days prior to screening. 
Treatments 
Conversion: 
During the 4 to 6 weeks conversion phase, subjects were cross-titrated from other antipsychotic(s) to oral 
aripiprazole monotherapy. Any subject who met the eligibility criteria and was receiving oral aripiprazole 
monotherapy  at  a  minimum  dose  of  10  to  30  mg/day  at  the  time  of  screening  entered  directly  into  the 
stabilization phase. Subjects who met the eligibility criteria and were receiving lower doses of aripiprazole 
monotherapy between ≥ 5 mg/day and  < 10 mg/day at the time of screening, bypassed the  conversion 
phase and continued on the same dose at the beginning of the stabilisation phase, but had to achieve a 
minimum target dose of 10 mg/day by Day 6 of the stabilisation phase. 
Subjects who were currently receiving aripiprazole monotherapy at a dose of < 5 mg/day were required to 
enter the conversion phase. The aim of the conversion phase was to achieve aripiprazole oral monotherapy 
at  a  minimum  target  dose  of  10  mg/day  at  Week  4,  and  no  later  than  Week  6,  before  entering  the 
stabilisation  phase.  However,  higher  starting  doses  were  acceptable  (up  to  30  mg/day),  based  on 
investigator judgment and subject’s clinical need. 
Assessment report  
EMA/702260/2016 
Page 9/54 
 
  
  
 
 
Stabilisation: 
During the stabilisation phase, subjects were stabilised on aripiprazole within the dose range of 10 mg/day 
to 30 mg/day over a minimum of 7 weeks and a maximum of 21 weeks. Based on clinical judgment with 
regard to tolerability issues, the investigator was allowed to reduce the subject’s aripiprazole dose, but to no 
less than 10 mg/day. If a dose reduction to 5 mg/day was required after Day 6 in the stabilisation phase, the 
subject was discontinued from the trial. Eligible subjects were allowed to bypass the conversion phase and 
enter the stabilisation phase directly if: 
(1)  the  subject  recently  had  been  without  antipsychotic  treatment  (for  no  more  than  3  weeks)  prior  to 
screening and the subject had a history of relapse and/or exacerbation of symptoms when not receiving 
antipsychotic treatment, or 
(2) the subject was being treated with oral aripiprazole monotherapy between 10 mg/day to 30 mg/day or 
(3) the subject was treated with a lower dose of branded aripiprazole between ≥ 5 mg/day and < 10 mg/day, 
but achieved a minimum target dose of 10 mg/day by Day 6 of the stabilisation phase. 
Subjects were assessed for stability beginning at Week 6 of the stabilisation phase. 
Stability in the stabilisation phase was achieved after 2 consecutive weekly assessments, starting no sooner 
than  Week  6  at  which  the  subject  met  predefined  stability  criteria.  Consequently,  at  any  time  between 
Weeks 7 and 21, subjects meeting stability criteria at 2 consecutive weekly assessments were randomised 
and entered the double-blind maintenance phase. In order to enter the double-blind maintenance phase, all 
subjects must have been on a minimum daily dose of 10 mg aripiprazole when the stability criteria were met. 
A period of up to 21 weeks was permitted to maximise the possibility of achieving the required duration of 
symptom stability. Assessments for stability continued until the subject could not meet the stability criteria 
at 2 consecutive weekly visits on or before Week 21. Any subject who had not met the stability criteria at 
Week 20 was withdrawn from the trial. 
Maintenance: 
From  the  stabilisation  phase,  subjects  were  randomised  in  a  2:1  ratio  to  receive  either  aripiprazole  10 
mg/day to 30 mg/day or placebo in a double-blind fashion, with double-blind treatment continuing for up to 
52  week  after  randomisation.  During  the  double  blind  maintenance  phase,  outpatient  subjects  were 
evaluated weekly for the first 4 weeks and then every 2 weeks. Subjects reported condition was assessed via 
telephone in the weeks that fell between trial centre visits, with the option of bringing the subject back to the 
trial centre, if there were any concerns. 
Follow-up: 
Subjects who completed the double-blind maintenance phase and those who discontinued from the trial due 
to impending relapse in the double-blind maintenance phase, or were withdrawn by the investigator for “lack 
of efficacy” or “worsening of illness” during the double-blind maintenance phase, and who met at least 1 of 
the protocol criteria for exacerbation of psychotic symptoms/impending relapse could enter an open-label 
safety trial of aripiprazole (Protocol 31-09-267). Subjects withdrawn from conversion or stabilisation phases 
prior to termination of the trial were not eligible for participation in this open-label trial. Subject who did not 
enter the open-label trial were followed up for safety/tolerability at visits 2 weeks (± 3 days) and 4 weeks (± 
3 days) after the last trial visit. Follow-up treatment in the form of non-trial medication supplement was 
offered for up to 12 weeks.

Objectives 
The primary objective of the trial was to evaluate the efficacy of aripiprazole compared with placebo in 
adolescent schizophrenic subjects who had maintained stability on oral aripiprazole for 2 consecutive weekly 
time points after at least 7 weeks of treatment. 
The secondary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral aripiprazole as maintenance 
treatment in adolescent subjects with schizophrenia. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  in  the trial  was  the  time  from  randomisation  to  exacerbation  of  psychotic 
symptoms/impending relapse in the double-blind maintenance phase. Impending relapse was defined as 
meeting any of the following 5 criteria: 
1) A Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) score of ≥ 5 (minimally worse) AND 
•  an increase in any of the following individual Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) 
items  (conceptual  disorganization,  hallucinatory  behaviour,  suspiciousness,  unusual  thought 
content) to a score > 4 with an absolute increase of ≥ 2 on that specific item since randomization 
OR 
•  an  increase  in  any  of  the  following  individual  PANSS  items  (conceptual  disorganization, 
hallucinatory  behaviour,  suspiciousness,  unusual  thought  content)  to  a  score  >  4  and  an 
absolute  increase  of  ≥   4  on  the  combined  4  PANSS  items  (conceptual  disorganization, 
hallucinatory behaviour, suspiciousness, unusual thought content) since randomization OR 
2) A CGI-I score of 6 or 7 (much or very much worse) OR 
3) Hospitalization due to worsening of illness (including partial hospitalization programs), but excluding 
hospitalization for psychosocial reasons OR 
4) Any suicidal behaviour or answers of “yes” to Questions 4 or 5 on the suicidal ideation section of the 
C-SSRS OR 
5) Violent or aggressive behaviour resulting in clinically significant self-injury, injury to another person, 
or property damage or inability to attend school due to this behaviour. 
In the double-blind maintenance phase the following secondary efficacy variable were compared between 
the aripiprazole treatment group and the placebo group at endpoint: 
•  Percentage of subjects meeting exacerbation of psychotic symptoms/impending relapse criteria 
•  Percentage  of  responders  in  each  treatment  group  (i.e.,  response  defined  as  meeting  stability 
criteria) 
•  Percentage of subjects achieving remission, where remission is defined as a score of ≤ 3 on each of 
the following specific PANSS items, which was maintained for a period of 6 months: delusions (P1), 
unusual  thought  content  (G9),  hallucinatory  behaviour  (P3),  conceptual  disorganization  (P2), 
mannerisms/posturing (G5), blunted affect (N1), social withdrawal (N4), and lack of spontaneity 
(N6) 
•  Time to discontinuation for all causes

Other Endpoints are: 
Efficacy: 
•  Mean change from baseline to endpoint in PANSS Total Score 
•  Mean change from baseline to endpoint in CGI-S score 
•  Mean CGI-I score at endpoint 
•  Mean change from baseline to endpoint in PANSS positive and negative subscales 
•  Mean change from baseline to endpoint in CGAS 
Safety: 
•  The frequency and severity of AEs, seriousness of AEs (clinical and laboratory), and discontinuation 
from trial due to AEs 
•  The frequency of symptom items for the NY-AACENT 
•  The frequency of side effects for the UKU Side Effects Rating Scale 
•  Analysis of potential suicide events recorded on the C-SSRS 
•  Mean change from baseline and incidence of clinically significant changes from baseline for clinical 
laboratory tests and urinalysis results (including fasting blood lipids and glucose, serum prolactin, 
insulin, haemoglobin A1c, and creatinine phosphokinase [CPK]), vital signs and ECG parameters. A 
central ECG service was utilized to review all ECGs in order to standardize interpretations for the 
safety analysis. 
•  Review of physical examination findings 
•  Baseline and post-baseline Tanner Staging 
•  Mean change from baseline of z-scores for height and body weight, mean changes of BMI, and waist 
circumference 
•  Mean change from baseline to endpoint on the AIMS, SAS, and BARS 
Sample size 
The expected total number of exacerbations of psychotic symptoms/impending relapse was estimated using 
a 2:1 (aripiprazole: placebo) randomization ratio to achieve at least 80% power and to preserve an overall 
nominal alpha level of 0.05 (2-sided). The resulting total number of events satisfying these design 
constraints was 37, assuming 52-week relapse rates of 66% for placebo and 33% for aripiprazole, 
corresponding to a hazard ratio of 0.37 (aripiprazole vs placebo) and an exponential distribution for relapse 
times.   
An interim analysis was performed after the accrual of approximately 75% of endpoints (=28), and the final 
analysis at 100% of planned events (=37). Hence, the target number of events was 28 for the interim 
analysis. This event-driven trial was terminated by the sponsor after the 37th exacerbation of psychotic 
symptoms/impending relapse was confirmed. The O’Brien-Fleming group sequential boundaries were used 
to allocate alpha levels of 0.019 to the interim look, and 0.044 to the final analysis. It was expected that 105 
subjects would be randomized, in a 2:1 ratio (70 in the aripiprazole group and 35 in the placebo group) to 
yield 37 events. The planned sample size and power assumed a 52-week dropout rate for reasons other than 
relapse of 30% and an accrual period of 1 day followed by trial duration of 52 weeks, in addition to the

assumptions applied to estimate the required number of events. The statistical computing software EAST 
was utilized in the sample size calculations. 
Before a protocol amendment, the sample size calculation was based on 90% power and on two interim 
analyses, and the number of events needed was 49. 
Randomisation 
Upon meeting entry requirements into the double-blind maintenance phase, subjects were assigned to trial 
medication via an interactive voice response system (IVRS) or interactive web response system (IWRS) 
according to a computer generated randomization code provided by the sponsor. 
Blinding (masking) 
During the double-blind phase of the trial, the treatment assignment code list was available only to an 
independent biostatistician and the clinical supply operations group. Subjects, investigational site personnel, 
the sponsor’s employees, and all other trial personnel remained blinded to the identity of the treatment 
assignments until every subject had completed trial treatment and the database was locked. 
There was a planned interim analysis, and the results of the interim analysis and individual subject data 
remained blinded to the sponsor during the course of the IDMC’s unblinded data analysis. 
Statistical methods 
The  primary  efficacy  analysis  compared  the  efficacy  of  oral  aripiprazole  (10  to  30  mg/day)  with  that  of 
placebo with regard to time to exacerbation of psychotic symptoms/impending relapse in the Double-Blind 
Maintenance Efficacy Sample. The primary efficacy endpoint was analysed using a log rank test comparing 
the 2 treatment groups at an overall nominal significance level of 0.05 (2-sided) following a group sequential 
procedure. The interim analysis was performed after approximately 75% of endpoints had accrued using 
O’Brien-Fleming sequential boundaries with an alpha level of 0.0193 for rejecting the null hypothesis at the 
interim time. The alpha level for the final analysis was 0.0442. Additionally, the corresponding confidence 
intervals for the hazard ratio (aripiprazole vs placebo) for the interim and final analyses were provided using 
the Cox proportional hazard model with terms for treatment in the model. Analyses of the secondary and 
other efficacy endpoints were performed for the Doubleblind Maintenance Phase Efficacy Sample using both 
last observations carried forward (LOCF) and observed cases (OC) datasets. Efficacy endpoints in the form 
of  mean  change  from  baseline  were  summarized  by  descriptive  statistics  and  compared  between  the 
aripiprazole and placebo groups by fitting an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model to the change scores 
with terms for treatment as a factor and baseline value as a covariate. Mixed models for repeated measures 
(MMRM) were employed to compare the change scores between the aripiprazole and placebo groups. Mean 
CGI-I score at endpoint was summarized by descriptive statistics and compared between the aripiprazole 
and  placebo  groups  using  the  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  method  based  on  row  mean  score  statistics. 
Proportion endpoints were summarized by counts and percent’s and, in addition, compared between the 
aripiprazole  and  placebo  groups  by  the  Chi-square  test.  Time  to  discontinuation  due  to  all  causes  was 
compared between the aripiprazole and placebo groups using the log rank test, along with Kaplan-Meier 
curves. The secondary and other efficacy endpoints at the end of the stabilization phase were evaluated 
using descriptive statistics for the Stabilization Efficacy Sample.

Baseline data 
Of the 201 subjects who entered the trial, 56 (27.9%) were between 13 and 14 years old and 145 (72.1%) 
were  at  least  15  years  old.  Of  the  146  subjects  randomised  in  the  double-blind  maintenance  phase,  21 
subjects completed the trial (15 aripiprazole, 6 placebo). Of the 146 subjects randomised in the double-blind 
maintenance phase, 41 (28.8%) were between the age of 13 and 14 years and 113 (77.4%) were at least 
15 years old. There were a larger number of male subjects than female subjects enrolled in the trial: 133 
male subjects (66%) compared to 68 female subjects. Female subjects and subjects aged 13 to 15 years 
were considered to be adequately represented in the subject population. In the double-blind maintenance 
phase, there were 98 subjects (62 males (63%) and 36 females) in the aripiprazole group and 48 subjects 
(34 males (71%) and 14 females) in the placebo group. The majority of subjects were white or Asian and

non-Hispanic or Latino. A minority (12.3%) of subjects in Trial 31-09-266 were enrolled at trial sites in an EU 
member country (Romania), the others were enrolled from outside the EU.   
Baseline disease severity was comparable between treatment groups. The mean age of first diagnosis of 
schizophrenia for subjects was 13 years. There was a decrease in PANSS total score between the conversion 
phase n = 185 subjects (mean was 86.9) and the double-blind maintenance phase where n = 146 subjects 
(mean was 65.5 in the aripiprazole group and 62.9 in the placebo group). There was a decrease in mean 
CGI-S  scores  in  the  double-blind  maintenance  phase  for  both  treatment  groups  (3.2  in  the  aripiprazole 
group and 3.0 in the placebo group) relative to the larger group treated in the conversion phase. The mean 
CGAS  score  increased  in  the  double-blind  maintenance  phase  in  both  treatment  groups  (60.9  in  the 
aripiprazole  group  and  66.1  in  the  placebo  group).  The  table  below  shows  the  study  participant

Numbers analysed 
A total of 244 subjects were screened for this trial. Over half the subjects screened for the trial came from 
the Russian Federation and India. A total of 201 subjects entered the trial and 146 subjects were randomized 
in the double-blind maintenance phase: 98 subjects in the aripiprazole group and 48 subjects in the placebo 
group. Of the 201 subjects who entered the trial, 56 (27.9%) subjects were between 13 and 14 years old 
and  145  (72.1%)  subjects  were  at  least  15  years  old.  Of  146  subjects  who  were  randomized  in  the 
double-blind maintenance phase, 21 subjects completed the trial: 15 subjects in the aripiprazole group and 
6 subjects in the placebo group. Of the 146 subjects randomized in the double-blind maintenance phase, 41 
(28.8%) subjects were between the age of 13 and 14 years and 113 (77.4%) subjects were at least 15 years 
old.  Female  subjects  and  subjects  aged  13  to  15  years  were  adequately  represented  in  the  subject 
population. The main reason for discontinuation from the trial was the sponsor discontinuing the trial (180 
subjects  [89.6%]  total),  which  occurred  after  the  37th  event  of  exacerbation  of  psychotic 
symptoms/impending  relapse  occurred.  All  subjects  were  analysed  for  safety  and  all  subjects  in  the 
stabilization and double-blind maintenance phases were analysed for efficacy.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
Aripiprazole  was  superior 
to  placebo  as  measured  by 
time 
to  exacerbation  of  psychotic 
symptoms/impending relapse, as derived from the Cox Proportional Hazard model (p = 0.0161). There was 
a  statistically  significant  delay  in  time  to  exacerbation  of  psychotic  symptoms/impending  relapse  for 
aripiprazole-treated subjects compared to placebo-treated subjects. The overall relapse rate was lower in 
the  aripiprazole-treated  subjects  (19.39%)  compared  to  placebo-treated  subjects  (37.50%).  Sensitivity 
analyses  for  time  to  exacerbation  of  psychotic  symptoms/impending  relapse  for  multiple  imputation 
approach confirmed the primary analysis results (all p-values under different situations less than 0.021). 
The  sensitivity  analysis  for  time  to  exacerbation  of  psychotic  symptoms/impending  relapse  for 
discontinuations  due  to  reasons  other  than  sponsor  discontinued  the  trial  also  supported  the  primary 
analysis (p = 0.0076). 
Secondary endpoints 
A  greater  proportion  of  subjects  treated  with  placebo  met  at  least  one  of  the  exacerbation  of  psychotic 
symptoms/impending relapse criteria compared to aripiprazole-treated subjects (p = 0.0181). All psychotic 
symptoms/impending relapse criteria were met by a higher incidence of placebo-treated subjects compared 
to aripiprazole-treated subjects with the exception of suicidal behaviour (0 of 48 subjects in the placebo 
group vs. 1 of 98 subjects in the aripiprazole group). 
The  difference  in  the  percentage  of  aripiprazole-treated  subjects  who  were  responders  at  the  last  visit 
compared to placebo-treated subjects was not statistically significant (p = 0.0962). At the last visit, 76 of 98 
(77.6%) aripiprazole-treated subjects were responders compared to 31 of 48 (64.6%) of placebo-treated 
subjects. 
A statistically significant difference in the time to discontinuation prior to Day 378, for reasons other than 
sponsor  terminated  the  trial,  in  the  double-blind  maintenance  phase,  was  seen  in  the  placebo  subjects 
compared to aripiprazole subjects (p = 0.0076). The discontinuation rate for placebo-treated subjects was 
47.92% compared to 25.51% for aripiprazole-treated subjects. 
Other efficacy endpoints  
In general, symptom stability was maintained in the aripiprazole group, as measured by lack of change in 
the  PANSS  total,  positive,  negative,  CGI-I  and  CGI-S  scores,  and  worsened  in  placebo.  However,  the 
differences  in  the  adjusted  mean  changes  from  baseline,  based  on  the  last  observation  carried  forward 
(LOCF) dataset, between aripiprazole- and placebo-treated subjects were not statistically significant. There 
was  no  notable  change  from  baseline  in  the  PANSS  Total  Score,  based  on  the  LOCF  dataset,  for 
aripiprazole-treated  subjects  during  the  double-blind  maintenance.  In  contrast,  the  PANSS  Total  Score, 
based  on  the  LOCF  dataset,  increased  (worsened)  from  baseline  over  the  course  of  the  double-blind 
maintenance for placebo-treated subjects. There was no notable change from baseline in the PANSS Positive 
Subscale Score or Negative Subscale Score by week, based on the LOCF or observed cases (OC) datasets, 
for either treatment group. However, differences were seen in the adjusted mean changes. There was no 
notable change from baseline in the CGI-S Score based on the LOCF dataset for aripiprazole-treated subjects 
during the double-blind maintenance phase and a very slight increase for placebo-treated subjects. There 
was a statistically significant treatment difference seen in the mean CGI-I score, based on the LOCF dataset, 
for aripiprazole vs. placebo-treated subjects from Weeks 10 to 30 (p ≤ 0.0037). Thus, aripiprazole-treated 
subjects  fared  slightly  better,  based  on  CGI-I  score,  than  placebo  treated  subjects.  There  was  no  mean 
change from baseline in the CGAS Score by week, based on the LOCF or OC datasets, for either treatment 
group. However, differences were seen in the adjusted mean changes.

Ancillary analyses 
As only the younger subgroup (13-14 years) of the population of the trial was not already covered by the 
approved indication, a subgroup analysis by age is of interest. Despite the point estimates for the treatment 
effect are generally overlapping, the trial do not reach statistical significance for the main efficacy analysis 
in the younger subgroup. 
In fact, for subjects receiving aripiprazole, relapse rates were comparable across age subgroups (20.69%, 
13 - 14 years; 18.84%, 15 - 17 years), although the relapse rate with placebo was higher in the younger age 
subgroup. Point estimates for the hazard ratios (HRs) were also comparable between age subgroups (0.495, 
13 - 14 years; 0.454, 15 - 17 years), but the absence of effect fell within the 95% confidence interval for the 
younger subgroup (0.151 to 1.628). The relapse rate with aripiprazole was lower than placebo overall and 
for both age subgroups; however, the log-rank test p-value for the treatment difference was statistically 
significant in favour of aripiprazole for the older subgroup (p = 0.0397), but not the younger subgroup (p = 
0.2378). 
Study 31-09-267 
A Long-term, Multicenter, Open-label Study to Evaluate the Safety and  Tolerability of Flexible-dose Oral 
Aripiprazole (OPC-14597) as Maintenance Treatment in Adolescent Patients With Schizophrenia or Child and 
Adolescent Patients With Bipolar I Disorder, Manic or Mixed Episode With or Without Psychotic Features 
Methods 
Trial Design 
This was an open-label trial of titrated aripiprazole to evaluate the safety and efficacy of aripiprazole tablets 
(10  to  30  mg/day)  as  maintenance  treatment  in  adolescent  subjects  (13  to  17  years  of  age)  with 
schizophrenia or child and adolescent subjects (10 to 17 years of age) with bipolar I disorder, manic or mixed 
episode, with or without psychotic features. The enrolled subject population of male and female subjects was 
comprised  of  child  and  adolescent  subjects  with  a  diagnosis  or  symptoms  of  schizophrenia  or  bipolar  I 
disorder,  manic  or  mixed  episode  with  or  without  psychotic  features,  with  a  diagnosis  according  to  the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria. 
This  trial  was  conducted  to  further  characterise  2  years  of  safety  exposure  with  special  focus  on  sexual 
maturation  and  growth,  cognitive  side  effects,  and  the  tolerability  of  aripiprazole  10  to  30  mg/day. 
Participants from the placebo-controlled Trial 31-09-266 were given the option to rollover to a one year 
openlabel follow up in the current trial on a compassionate basis. The data from these rollover subjects are 
shorter  in  duration  and  are  not  intended  to  be  primarily  used  to  satisfy  the  commitment  to  the  PIP 
commitment nor should the safety data be combined for these 2 groups with such difference in the exposure 
time. This trial consists of a screening period, a conversion/titration phase, an open-label treatment phase, 
and a follow-up period. Individual participation for subjects who completed the trial ranged from a minimum 
of approximately 56 weeks to a maximum of 120 weeks. Length of participation varied depending on the 
screening duration (3 to 42 days for de novo subjects and 0 days for Trial 31-09-266 rollover subjects), the 
time  required  for  conversion  to  aripiprazole  monotherapy  (0  to  6  weeks),  the  duration  of  open-label 
treatment (12 to 24 months ± 7 days), and 4-week post-trial follow up.

Schematic representation of the design for trial 31-09-267 
Study Participants 
The enrolled subject population of child and adolescent male and female subjects was planned to include 
approximately 500 de novo subjects either with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder, manic or mixed episode 
and approximately 150 rollover subjects from Trial 31-09-266. The actual number of subjects enrolled was 
524. 
All de novo subjects were required to enter the screening period of the trial. De novo subjects could have two 
years exposure to aripiprazole while subjects who rolled over from the 31-09-266 trial could have one year 
exposure. 
The  31-09-266  trial  enrolled  only  subjects  with  schizophrenia.  De  novo  subjects  in  the  31-09-267  were 
enrolled with a diagnosis of either schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Due to the rollover population being all 
schizophrenic and the criteria for the 31-09-267 allowing for either diagnosis, the number of subjects with 
bipolar disorder enrolled was much smaller than subjects with schizophrenia in this trial. 
Subjects who were screened and were not required to go through the conversion phase had to complete an 
open-label  treatment  phase  baseline  visit  prior  to  their  participation  in  the  open-label  treatment  phase. 
Subjects from Trial 31-09-266 who were eligible for entry into this open-label trial, because they chose to 
continue treatment upon completion of Trial 31-09-266, bypassed screening and the conversion phase, but 
were required to reinitiate the fixed dose titration in the open-label treatment phase. 
Treatments 
Screening Period: 
Screening  was  from  Days  −42  to  −3.  After  the  screening  procedures  were  complete,  eligible  subjects 
underwent a washout of prohibited medications to be eligible to enter the conversion phase or the open-label 
treatment phase. 
Assessment report  
EMA/702260/2016 
Page 19/54 
 
  
  
 
Conversion Phase (de novo subjects and subjects with schizophrenia who rolled over from the screening 
period or the conversion phase of Trial 31-09-266): 
During the 4 to 6 weeks of the conversion phase, some of the de novo subjects were cross-titrated from their 
other antipsychotic(s) (if any) to oral trial aripiprazole target dose ranging from 10 to 30 mg/day. Subjects 
were required to receive a minimum dose of 10 mg daily to enter the open-label treatment phase from the 
conversion phase. Evaluations from the Week 6 (or end of the conversion phase) visit served as the baseline 
visit for the open-label treatment phase. Subjects who completed the screening period of Trial 31-09-266 
rolled over into the conversion phase of Trial 31-09-267 and resumed dose titration in this trial at the week 
in the conversion phase that they had stopped in Trial 31-09-266. 
Open-label Treatment Phase: 
Subjects  entered  the  open-label  treatment  phase  directly  after  screening  if  they  rolled  over  from  the 
stabilization or double-blind maintenance phase of Trial 31-09-266 or if, as a de novo subject, they were 
already treated with oral aripiprazole monotherapy. Otherwise (ie, subjects naive to aripiprazole, or who 
were  receiving  more  than  1  antipsychotic  drug),  subjects  entered  the  open-label  treatment  phase  after 
completing the conversion phase, and not directly after screening. The open-label treatment phase baseline 
trial procedures were performed prior to entering the open-label treatment phase. During the open-label 
treatment phase, subjects received trial aripiprazole within the approved dose range of 10 to 30 mg/day; 
nevertheless,  the  dose  could  have  been  lowered  to  5  mg/day,  if  it  was  deemed  necessary  after  Day  6, 
according to the investigator’s clinical judgment. The length of treatment in the open-label treatment phase 
was determined by the following criteria: 
•  De novo subjects enrolled in the open-label treatment phase of this trial were eligible to 
receive up to 2 years (104 weeks) of open-label aripiprazole treatment. 
•  Rollover  subjects  enrolled in  the  open-label treatment  phase  of  this  trial  were  eligible  to 
receive up to 1 year (52 weeks) of open-label aripiprazole treatment. 
Safety Follow-up Phase: 
A follow-up phone call to the subject/parent/guardian or legally acceptable representative, as applicable for 
local laws, occurred 30 +- 3 days after the End of Trial (Months 12 or 24)/ET visit to assess adverse events 
(AEs). 
Objectives 
The objective of the trial was to further characterize the long-term safety and tolerability of aripiprazole in 
adolescent subjects with schizophrenia and child and adolescent subjects with bipolar I disorder, manic or 
mixed episode, with or without psychotic features. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: 
• 
frequency and severity of AEs, serious AEs (clinical and laboratory), and discontinuation from trial 
due to AEs. 
Secondary safety endpoints included the following: 
•  Mean change from baseline and incidence of clinically significant abnormalities in clinical laboratory 
tests  and  urinalysis  results  (including  fasting  blood  lipids,  glucose,  and  insulin,  serum  prolactin, 
haemoglobin A1c, and creatinine phosphokinase), vital signs (supine and standing positions), and

ECG parameters. A central ECG service was utilized to review all ECGs to standardize interpretations 
for the safety analysis. 
•  Review of physical examination findings 
•  Mean change from baseline of z-scores for height and body weight, and mean changes of BMI and 
waist circumference 
•  Mean change from baseline on the AIMS, SAS, and BARS 
•  The frequency of symptom items for the clinician-administered NY-AACENT 
•  Baseline and post-baseline Tanner Staging 
•  Analysis of potential suicide events recorded on the C-SSRS 
•  Time to discontinuation due to AE 
The secondary efficacy endpoints for subjects with schizophrenia included the following: 
•  Mean change from baseline in PANSS Total Score 
•  Mean change from baseline in PANSS Positive and Negative Subscale Scores 
•  Mean change from baseline in CGI-S Score 
•  Mean CGI-I Score at endpoint 
•  Mean change from baseline in CGAS 
The secondary efficacy endpoints for subjects with bipolar manic or mixed episode included the following: 
•  Mean change from baseline in YMRS Score 
•  Mean change from baseline in CGI-BP Severity Score 
•  Mean CGI-BP Improvement Score at endpoint 
•  Mean change from baseline in GBI Score 
•  Mean change from baseline in ADHD-RS-IV Score 
•  Mean change from baseline in CGAS 
The other efficacy endpoints included the following: 
•  Change from baseline for P-QLES-Q 
•  Mean change from baseline on the PANSS Cognitive Subscale Score 
•  Time to discontinuation for all reasons 
Statistical methods 
For trial 31-09-267 no primary efficacy endpoints were defined. The secondary efficacy endpoints for the 
open-label  treatment  phase  was  the  mean  CGI-I  Score  for  subjects  with  schizophrenia  and  CGI-BP 
Improvement  Score  for  subjects  with  bipolar  manic  or  mixed  episode  were  summarized  by  descriptive 
statistics using the Open-label Treatment Phase Efficacy Sample. Descriptive statistics were provided for all 
other  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  in  the  form  of  mean  change  from  baseline  using  the  Open-label 
Treatment Phase Efficacy Sample. Descriptive statistics included mean, median, range, and SD, and were 
presented by enrolment source and target disease. The PANSS Total Score (range 30 to 120) is the sum of 
the rating scores for 7 positive scale items, 7 negative scale items, and 16 general psychopathology scale 
Assessment report

Page 21/54 
 
  
  
items. A missing  value  for any item(s) could have resulted in a missing PANSS Total Score.  The PANSS 
Positive Subscale Score (range 7 to 49) is the sum of the rating scores for the 7 positive scale items from the 
PANSS scale. The PANSS Negative Subscale Score (range 7 to 49) is the sum of the rating scores for the 7 
negative  scale  items  from  the  PANSS  scale.  A  missing  value  of  any  items  in  the  PANSS  positive  or  the 
negative items resulted in a missing subscale score. Higher scores in the  PANSS assessments represent 
greater  severity.  The  CGI-S  and  CGI-BP  Severity  Scores  (range  1  to  7),  as  well  as  CGI-I  and  CGI-BP 
Improvement Scores (range 1 to 7) are single-item rating scores, with higher scores representing greater 
severity or less improvement. The CGAS Score (range 1 to 100) is a single-item score for rating a child’s 
general  level  of  functioning  on  a  health-illness  continuum,  with  higher  scores  representing  better 
functioning. The YMRS Total Score (range 0 to 44) is the sum of the rating scores for 11 items for assessing 
the core symptoms of mania. A missing value for any YMRS assessment item(s) could have resulted in a 
missing YMRS Total Score. A higher YMRS Total Score represents greater severity. The GBI Total Score for 
mania (range 0 to 30) is the sum of scores for items 1 to 10 and the GBI Total Score for depression (range 
0 to 30) is the sum of scores for items 11 to 20 in the GBI Parent/Guardian or Subject Version panel. Scores 
from the Parent/Guardian and Subject Versions were summarized separately. A missing value for any GBI 
assessment  item(s)  could  have  resulted  in  a  missing  GBI  Total  Score.  High  scores  represent  greater 
psychopathology. The ADHD-RS-IV Total Score (range 0 to 54) is the sum of rating scores for 18 items, with 
higher scores representing greater severity. A missing value for any ADHD-RS-IV assessment items could 
have resulted in a missing ADHD-RS-IV Total Score. Other endpoints included the change from baseline in 
P-QLES-Q Total and Overall Scores; change from baseline in the PANSS Cognitive Subscale Score, and time 
to discontinuation for all reasons other than sponsor terminating the trial. The change in the P-QLES-Q Total 
and Overall Scores and PANSS Cognitive Subscale Score data were listed for the conversion phase safety 
data and also summarized using descriptive statistics for the end of the open-label treatment phase and by 
visit for the open-label treatment phase safety data. Descriptive statistics included mean, median, range, 
and SD, and were presented by enrolment source and target disease. The Kaplan-Meier curve was plotted 
for time to discontinuation due to all causes other than sponsor terminating the trial for groups of subjects 
by enrolment source and target disease. The P-QLES-Q Total Score (range 14 to 70) is the sum of rating 
scores for items 1 to 14 and the P-QLES-Q Overall Score (range 1 to 5) are referred to as item 15 from the 
P-QLES-Q panel. A missing value for any one of the P-QLES-Q items 1 to 14 could have resulted in a missing 
P-QLES-Q Total Score. Higher scores in P-QLES-Q represent better performance of the assessed subjects. 
The PANSS Cognitive Subscale Score is the sum of rating scores for items G10, G11, G12, P2, N5, and N7 
from the PANSS. A missing value for any one of the 6 items could have resulted in a missing PANSS Cognitive 
Subscale Score. The time to discontinuations due to all causes other than sponsor terminating the trial was 
measured  from  the  date  of  entering  the  open-label  treatment  phase  to  the  date  of  ET  for  discontinued 
subjects in the open-label treatment phase (i.e., time to discontinuation = date of discontinuation [or date 
of completion for completed subjects] − date of subject entering the open-label treatment phase + 1). If the 
subjects  completed  the  trial  or  were  discontinued  due  to  the  sponsor  terminating  the  trial,  they  were 
censored at the time of completion or trial termination, respectively.

Baseline data 
A total of 524 subjects entered this trial: 362 subjects were de novo subjects and 148 subjects rolled over 
from Trial 31-09-266. The number of subjects with schizophrenia that entered this trial was 427 and the 
number of subjects with bipolar disorder was 97. A total of 158 de novo subjects participated in the trial for 
more than 728 days: 127 with schizophrenia and 31 with bipolar disorder. The de novo subset of the subject 
population is the primary dataset for the PIP commitment. 
The majority of subjects who entered trial 31-09-267 were White (380 of 524 [72.5%] subjects) and not 
Hispanic or Latino (511 of 524 [97.5%] subjects). The next most frequently represented race was Asian 
(20.8%), followed by Black or African American, Other, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (5.0%, 
1.5%, and 0.2%, respectively). A quarter of the subject was enrolled in EU member countries (Bulgaria,

Croatia, Hungary, Poland, and Romania). Overall, the mean (SD) age of subjects was 15.2 ± 1.6 years. The 
mean age of de novo subjects was 15.0 ± 1.6 (range: 10.0 to 17.0 years). The demographic characteristics 
of subjects who entered the conversion and open-label treatment period were similar. The mean (SD) age of 
first diagnosis of the target disease was 13.5 (2.3) years (range: 4 to 17) for the Open-label Treatment 
Phase Safety Sample. The mean (SD) PANSS Total Score at baseline was 68.2 (17.5) and the CGI-S Score 
was 3.4 (0.9) for de novo subjects with schizophrenia. For (de novo) bipolar subjects, the mean (SD) YMRS 
Total Score at baseline was 19.5 (8.8), and the CGI-BP Overall Bipolar Severity Score was 3.5 (1.2), and the 
CGI-BP Overall Bipolar Change Score was 2.3 (1.2).

Numbers analysed 
A  total of  524  subjects  entered this  trial  (297  subjects  in  the  conversion  phase  and  510  subjects  in  the 
open-label  treatment  phase).  Overall,  in  the  open-label  treatment  phase,  362  subjects  were  de  novo 
subjects (280 subjects entered into the conversion phase) and 148 subjects rolled over from Trial 31-09-266 
(3 subjects enrolled in the conversion phase prior to entering the open-label treatment phase). The number 
of subjects with schizophrenia that entered this trial at any phase was 427 and the number of subjects with 
bipolar disorder that entered this trial at any phase was 97. All of the subjects were analysed for safety (524 
subjects) and 507 of 510 (99.4%) subjects in the open-label treatment phase were analysed for efficacy. A 
total of 158 de novo subjects participated in the trial for more than 728 days: 127 with schizophrenia and 31 
with  bipolar  disorder.  The  de  novo  subset  of  the  subject  population  is  the  primary  dataset  for  the  PIP 
commitment. Only 198 of 524 (37.8%) subjects completed the trial; 14 of 297 (4.7%) subjects discontinued 
during the conversion phase and 312 of 510 (61.2%) subjects discontinued from the open-label treatment 
phase. De novo and rollover subjects discontinued from the open-label treatment phase at rates of 185 of 
362 (51.1%) subjects and 127 of 148 [85.8%] subjects, respectively. Subjects with bipolar disorder and 
subjects with schizophrenia discontinued from the open-label treatment phase at similar rates (59 of 94 
[62.8%] subjects and 253 of 416 [60.8%] subjects, respectively). The most frequent reasons for subject 
discontinuation  during  any  phase  were  sponsor  discontinued  trial  (31.5%),  subject  withdrew  consent 
(13.7%), and AE (6.9%). Most of the premature study discontinuations were from the open-label treatment 
phase rather than from the conversion phase. Of the most frequent reasons for subject discontinuation, de 
novo subjects and rollover subjects discontinued from the open-label treatment phase because the sponsor 
discontinued trial (16.3% and 71.6%, respectively). De novo and rollover subjects discontinued from the 
open-label treatment phase due to subject withdrew consent at rates of 14.4% and 8.8%, respectively, and 
due  to  AEs  at  rates  of  7.7%  and  3.4%,  respectively.  Of  the  most  frequent  reasons  for  subject 
discontinuation,  schizophrenia  subjects  and  bipolar subjects  discontinued  from  the  open-label  treatment 
phase  because  sponsor  discontinued  trial  at  rates  of  38.2%  and  6.4%,  respectively,  and  subjects  with 
schizophrenia or bipolar disorder discontinued from the open-label treatment phase due to subject withdrew 
consent  at  rates  of  11.8%  and  17.0%,  respectively).  For  all  subjects,  the  most  frequent  reason  for 
withdrawal of consent was the refusal of subjects who had just turned 18 years of age to sign the ICF. Only 
de novo subjects had up to 2 years of exposure, rollover subjects had up to 1 year of exposure. The de novo 
portion of the dataset is intended to address the PIP commitment, as described above; rollover subjects 
received open-label treatment after the participation of the placebo-controlled study in a compassionate use 
basis. The length of exposure is different between the de novo and rollover cohorts; therefore, the emphasis 
is on the de novo subject data.

Outcomes and estimation 
Safety Results: 
 Overall,  349  of  510  (68.4%)  subjects  experienced  a  total  of  1156  treatment-emergent  adverse  events 
(TEAEs): 278 of 362 (76.8%) de novo subjects and 71 of 148 (48.0%) rollover subjects. A total of 49 of 510 
(9.6%) subjects experienced at least 1 serious TEAE: 42 of 362 (11.6%) de novo subjects and 7 of 148 
(4.7%) rollover subjects. A total of 203 of 510 (39.8%) subjects had at least 1 TEAE that was considered by 
the investigator to be potentially causally related to the trial drug: 163 of 362 (45.0% de novo subjects and 
40 of 148 (27.0%) rollover subjects. Overall, 32 of 510 (6.3%) subjects experienced at least 1 TEAE which 
led to discontinuation of the trial drug: 27 of 362 (7.5%) de novo subjects and 5 of 148 (3.4%) rollover 
subjects. The most frequently reported AEs of special interest among de novo subjects (9% to 13%) were 
EPS-,  weight  gain-,  and  sedation/somnolence-related  TEAEs  with  suicideand  orthostasis-related  TEAEs 
reported less frequently (1% to 4%). Hepatic-, prolactin-, glucose-, and lipid parameter-related TEAEs were 
reported at a frequency of < 1%; no neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS)- or seizure-related TEAEs were 
reported.  One  death  occurred  during  this  trial.  On  Day  572  of  the  open-label  treatment  phase,  Subject 
621-5102  died  of  accidental  acute  heroin  toxicity  (Medical  Dictionary  for  Regulatory  Activities  preferred 
term: toxicity to various agents). The fatal TEAE was considered severe, unrelated to trial medication, and 
was not suicide related. 
Two pregnancies were reported during the trial and resulted in live births. The birth was uncomplicated for 
Subject 619-5402 and at the infant’s 4-month check-up the child had reached all normal developmental 
milestones. The birth of Subject 617-5069’s baby was via spontaneous vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery. 
The newborn had the umbilical cord wrapped 3 times around her leg, a caput succedaneum, a large middle 
digit on the right hand, bilateral wrist drop, upper extremity increased tone, and lower extremity decreased 
tone. There were no further updates to the condition of either mother or child. One potential Hy’s law case 
was  reported  during  this  trial;  this  rollover  subject  had  a  concomitant  TEAE  of  hepatitis  A  during  the 
open-label treatment phase. 
No  clinically  meaningful  changes  from  baseline  were  observed  in  mean  serum  chemistry,  hematology, 
urinalysis, or other laboratory test parameters in the open-label treatment phase. 
Weight, BMI, and waist circumference increased steadily throughout the open-label treatment period. Based 
on  the  relatively  stable  weight  and  BMI  z-scores  data,  the  weight  changes  that  occurred  during  the 
open-label treatment phase were consistent with growth and maturation of this pediatric population, aged 
10 to 18 years. 
The  most  frequently  reported  vital  signs  of  potential  clinical  relevance  during  the  open-label  treatment 
period for de novo subjects included weight gain ≥ 7% in 168 of 361 (46.5%) subjects, increase in standing 
diastolic blood pressure ≥ 15 mmHg in 40 of 361 (11.1%) subjects, weight loss ≥ 7% in 39 of 361 (10.8%) 
subjects and increase in supine diastolic blood pressure ≥15 mmHg in 37 of 361 (10.2%) subjects). The 
frequency with which weight gain ≥7% occurred increased steadily throughout the trial. 
No clinically meaningful changes from baseline were observed in the AIMS Movement Rating Score or the 
BARS  Global  Score  in  the  open-label  treatment  phase.  In  general,  the  SAS  Total  Score  using  the  LOCF 
dataset decreased throughout the open label treatment phase. 
Overall,  275  of  362  (76.0%)  de  novo  subjects  had  signs/symptoms  (at  least  one  occurrence)  in  the 
NY-AACENT;  a  majority  of  subjects  had  signs/symptoms  of  reasoning  and  problem  solving  (230  of  362 
[63.5%] subjects), attention/vigilance (221 of 362 [61.0%] subjects), social cognition (215 of 362 [59.4%] 
subjects), and speed of processing (198 of 362 [54.7%] subjects). 
There were no completed suicides in this trial. Overall during the open-label treatment phase, suicidality and 
suicidal ideation were reported on the C-SSRS for 8.3% of de novo subjects and 8.1% of de novo subjects, 
Assessment report

respectively, with worsening and emergence of suicidal ideation reported for 6.9% of de novo subjects and 
5.0% of de novo subjects, respectively. 
Overall, 146 (40.3%) de novo subjects who were not already at Tanner Stage 5 (adult sexual maturity) 
progressed at least 1 stage from baseline as of the last assessment during the open-label treatment phase. 
A total of 132 de novo subjects (79 of 210 [37.6%] male subjects and 53 of 152 [34.9%] female subjects) 
were Tanner Stage 5 at baseline. Tanner Staging progression (ie, 1 to 3 stages from baseline) was similar for 
male and female de novo subjects during aripiprazole treatment (87 of 210 [41.4%] male subjects and 59 
of 152 [38.8%] female subjects). 
Efficacy Results:  
Rapid symptom improvement in the PANSS Total Score, PANSS Positive Subscale Score, PANSS Negative 
Subscale  Score,  CGI-S  Score,  CGI-I  Score,  CGAS  Score,  CGI-BP  Severity  Score,  CGI-BP  Improvement 
Score,  and  PANSS  Cognitive  Subscale  Score  were  observed  for  de  novo  subjects  during  the  first  2  to  4 
months of the open-label treatment phase of this trial. Subjects continued to improve throughout the rest of 
the trial, although at a slower rate than the first few months. Based on the GBI Total Score for Mania and 
Depression as well as the ADHD-RS-IV Total Score, bipolar subjects experienced a rapid improvement in 
symptoms reaching a maximum mean change from baseline between Weeks 3 and 8. 
Mania  symptoms  rapidly  improved  for  bipolar  subjects  based  on  the  YMRS  Total  Score  using  the  LOCF 
dataset over the first 8 weeks of the open-label treatment phase. After this initial improvement, the mean 
(SD)  YMRS  Total  Score  plateaued.  Improvement  of  symptoms  was  also  seen  throughout  the  open-label 
treatment phase based on the P-QLES-Q Total and Overall Scores. 
Overall, 147 of 510 (28.8%) subjects discontinued from the open-label treatment phase for reasons other 
than sponsor discontinued the trial (126 of 362 de novo subjects and 21 of 148 rollover subjects) with a 
median  time  to  discontinuation  of  768.0  days.  A  total  of  73  of  268  (27.2%)  de  novo  subjects  with 
schizophrenia discontinued and 53 of 94 (56.4%) [de novo] subjects with bipolar disorder discontinued. 
There was no notable difference in discontinuation rate for de novo subjects based on subject age (36.4% for 
subjects < 15 years and 34.1% for subjects ≥15 years).

3.1.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study 31-09-266 was a placebo controlled paediatric study in schizophrenia, with most centres outside EU.  
It is acknowledged that ethical issues prevent in some countries, particularly in EU, to conduct a trial on 
schizophrenic patients with a placebo arm. Thereby studied population came mostly from non EU countries, 
where clinical practice in paediatric psychiatry and access to psychiatric support and medication may be 
different from most EU. Given that a large number of patients studied were indeed from Russian and Asian 
centres, the applicant was requested to show that these patients (particularly those who are 13 and 14 year 
old) are representative of the EU population. In its responses, the MAH stressed out that 12% of patients 
enrolled in study 266 were from EU (albeit from a single country – Romania). A comparison between EU 
countries  and  the  other  world  regions  did  not  exhibit  relevant  differences.  This  comparison  however  is 
between Eastern Countries and the rest of the world, and not between non Eastern EU countries vs Eastern 
countries. The CHMP was of the opinion that the same doubt subsisted as in particular in these countries, full 
access to atypical antipsychotics are not universal, jeopardizing external validity. 
The study did not include an active comparator arm, and most of the patients did not reach end of study due 
to the decision of sponsor rather than impending relapse. Furthermore patient time “in trial” was considered 
short for the primary endpoint (mean days on ARI: 184; mean days on placebo: 158). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The  high (42.1%) proportion of remitters in the placebo arm poses into question the diagnosis of 
schizophrenia in the patients studied, as this rests primarily on the course of the disease (episodic, often 
after prodromal phase, with incomplete recovery between episodes) and hence the generalisation of the 
results to the target population. On this point the Applicant, upon request, clarified that the remitters rate is 
dependent on the actual time on study, and it is not, due to the termination of the study due to decision of 
sponsor, a 1-year remitters rate. 
However, the lack of precision of the estimation of the hazard ratio for the patients aged 13 to 14 (whose 
95% confidence interval ranges from 0.151 to 1.628) – probably also due to the small number – does not 
allow to draw a conclusion on the presence of a treatment effect 
3.1.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The CHMP considered that the data provided could not support the level of efficacy required for an extension 
of indication for the age range 13-14 years of age. 
3.2.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Data from two clinical trials with aripiprazole for the treatment of schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder, manic 
or  mixed  episode  with  or  without  psychotic  features  in  child  and  adolescent  subjects  is  presented  fr 
discussion.  The  safety  profile  observed  for  aripiprazole  in  paediatric  schizophrenia  and  bipolar  mania 
subjects has similitude with the known product safety profile in adults, as observed from both clinical trials 
and  post-marketing  reports.  No  new  types  of  adverse  events  (AEs)  were  observed  in  the  paediatric 
population than were reported in the adult population. However, variations for certain AEs were observed 
between  the  adult  and  paediatric  populations.  For  adolescent  subjects  with  schizophrenia,  the 
recommended target dose of Abilify is 10 mg/day. Aripiprazole was studied in the present trials at daily 
doses  of  10  to  30  mg  in  adolescent  subjects  (13  to  17  years  of  age)  with  schizophrenia  and  child  and 
adolescent subjects (10 to 17 years of age) with bipolar I disorder, manic or mixed episode with or without 
psychotic features.

Study 31-09-266 
Patient exposure 
During the stabilization phase, the mean average daily dose (SD) was 18.4 mg (6.1) in the aripiprazole 
group and 17.1 mg (5.9) in the placebo group. In the double-blind maintenance phase, the mean average 
daily dose (SD) was 19.2 mg (6.7) in the aripiprazole group and 17.7 mg (6.6) in the placebo group. In the 
double-blind maintenance phase, the mean number of days of aripiprazole exposure was 184.6 days in the 
aripiprazole  group  and  158.1  days  in  the  placebo  group.  The  minimum  number  of  days  of  aripiprazole 
exposure in the double-blind maintenance phase was 6 days and maximum was 371 days.

A total of 244 subjects were screened for this trial. Over half the subjects screened for the trial came from 
the Russian Federation and India. A total of 201 subjects entered the trial and 146 subjects were randomized 
in the double-blind maintenance phase: 98 subjects in the aripiprazole group and 48 subjects in the placebo 
group. Of the 201 subjects who entered the trial, 56 (27.9%) subjects were between 13 and 14 years old 
and  145  (72.1%)  subjects  were  at  least  15  years  old.  Of  146  subjects  who  were  randomized  in  the 
double-blind maintenance phase, 21 subjects completed the trial: 15 subjects in the aripiprazole group and 
6 subjects in the placebo group. Of the 146 subjects randomized in the double-blind maintenance phase, 41 
(28.8%) subjects were between the age of 13 and 14 years and 113 (77.4%) subjects were at least 15 years 
old.  Female  subjects  and  subjects  aged  13  to  15  years  were  adequately  represented  in  the  subject 
population. The main reason for discontinuation from the trial was the sponsor discontinuing the trial (180 
subjects  [89.6%]  total),  which  occurred  after  the  37th  event  of  exacerbation  of  psychotic 
symptoms/impending  relapse  occurred.  All  subjects  were  analysed  for  safety  and  all  subjects  in  the 
stabilization and double-blind maintenance phases were analysed for efficacy.

Adverse events 
In the stabilization phase of trial 31-09-266, a total of 183 (100.0%) subjects were treated with aripiprazole 
oral tablets. A total of 109 (59.6%) subjects reported TEAEs. Four (2.2%) subjects reported serious TEAEs 
and 4 (2.2%) subjects reported TEAEs that were considered severe in severity. A total of 7 (3.8%) subjects 
discontinued  trial  medication  due  to  AEs.  A  total  of  146  subjects  were  randomized  in  the  double-blind 
maintenance phase (98 subjects in the aripiprazole group and 48 subjects in the placebo group). A total of

140 TEAEs were reported by 64 (65.3%) subjects in the aripiprazole group and 79 TEAEs reported by 33 
(68.8%) subjects in the placebo group. The aripiprazole group reported fewer serious TEAEs (3 subjects 
[3.1%]) compared to the placebo group (6 subjects [12.5%]). The aripiprazole group also reported fewer 
severe  TEAEs  (2  subjects  [2.0%])  compared  to  the  placebo  group  (5  subjects  [10.4%]).  A  total  of  20 
subjects (20.4%) in the aripiprazole group and 19 subjects (39.6%) in the placebo group discontinued trial 
medication due to AEs. 
Table: summary of AEs 
Common Adverse Events 
A similar percentage of subjects in the aripiprazole and placebo treatment groups in trial 31-09-266 reported 
TEAEs in the double-blind maintenance phase. A larger percentage of subjects discontinued trial medication 
due to AEs in the placebo group than in the aripiprazole group (39.6% of placebo subjects compared to 
20.4%  of  aripiprazole  subjects).  A  total  of  45  (45.9%)  subjects  reported  TEAEs  considered  by  the 
investigator as potentially causally related to IMP in the aripiprazole group compared to 29 (60.4%) subjects 
in the placebo group. 
TEAEs 
In trial 31-09-266, a total of 64 (65.3%) TEAEs were reported in the aripiprazole group vs 33 (68.8%) TEAEs 
reported in the placebo group. Schizophrenia was the most frequently reported TEAE by the aripiprazole 
group  and  the  placebo  group,  10  subjects  (10.2%)  and  13  subjects  (27.1%),  respectively.  Insomnia 
(considered  a  symptom  of  worsening  schizophrenia)  was  reported  by  more  placebo  subjects  than 
aripiprazole  subjects,  9  subjects  (18.8%)  and  5  subjects  (5.1%),  respectively.  Psychotic  disorder  was 
reported as a TEAE by 9 subjects (9.2%) in the aripiprazole group and in 5 subjects (10.4%) in the placebo 
group. Weight increased was reported by 8 subjects (8.2%) in the aripiprazole group and by 5 subjects 
(10.5%) in the placebo group. The aripiprazole group reported more TEAEs of nasopharyngitis (7 subjects 
[7.1%]) compared to the placebo group (1 subject [2.1%]). Most TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity.

Other SAEs 31-09-266 
The number of serious TEAEs was higher in the placebo group, 6 subjects (12.5%) vs the aripiprazole group 
3  subjects  (3.1%).  The  placebo  group  had  5  (10.4%)  subjects  with  serious  TEAEs  of  schizophrenia 
compared to the aripiprazole group, who had 1 (1.0%) subject with a serious TEAE of schizophrenia. Of the 
5 serious TEAEs of schizophrenia in the placebo group, 3 events were considered moderate in severity and 
2 events were considered severe in severity. The serious TEAE of schizophrenia in the aripiprazole group was 
considered mild in severity. The aripiprazole group had 2 (2.0%) subjects with serious TEAEs of psychotic 
disorder compared to the placebo group who had 1 (2.1%) subject with a serious TEAE of psychotic disorder. 
The 2 serious TEAEs of psychotic disorder in the aripiprazole group were considered moderate in severity 
while  the  1  serious  TEAE  of  psychotic  disorder  in  the  placebo  group  was  considered  to  be  moderate  in 
severity.

Other Significant Adverse Events 
syndrome 
to  EPS,  neuroleptic  malignant 
There were 11 defined adverse events of special interest (AESI) for trial 31-09-266. These included AEs 
relating 
suicide, 
sedation/somnolence,  glucose  levels,  lipid  parameters,  weight  gain,  prolactin  levels,  and  hepatic 
functioning. No adverse events of special interest relating to EPS, NMS, seizure, orthostasis events, suicide, 
sedation  and  somnolence,  glucose,  lipid  parameters,  weight  gain,  prolactin  and  hepatic  events  in  the 
Double-blind  Maintenance  Phase  occurred  more  frequently  in  the  aripiprazole  group  compared  to  the 
placebo group due to the previous stabilization of subjects on aripiprazole in the conversion and stabilization 
phases. The most common AESI reported was akathisia, which was reported by 3 subjects (6.3%) in the 
placebo group and 3 subjects (3.1%) in the aripiprazole group. No subjects experienced AESIs relating to 
NMS, seizures, orthostasis, glucose levels, or prolactin.

(NMS), 
Vital Signs 
The  most  frequently  reported  vital  signs  of  potential  clinical  relevance  during  the  open-label  treatment 
period for de novo subjects included weight gain ≥ 7% in 168 of 361 (46.5%) subjects, increase in standing 
diastolic blood pressure ≥ 15 mmHg in 40 of 361 (11.1%) subjects, weight loss ≥ 7% in 39 of 361 (10.8%) 
subjects and increase in supine diastolic blood pressure ≥ 15 mmHg in 37 of 361 (10.2%) subjects. The 
frequency  with  which  weight  gain  ≥  7%  occurred  increased  steadily  throughout  the  trial.  The  most 
frequently reported vital sign-related TEAEs during the open-label treatment period for de novo subjects 
were increased weight in 32 of 362 (8.8%) subjects and pyrexia in 12 of 362 (3.3%) subjects. Weight and 
BMI z-scores deviated little from the mean of the age and gender reference population, and changed little 
from baseline. Based on the relatively stable weight and BMI z-scores, the weight changes that occurred 
during  the  open-label  treatment  phase  were  consistent  with  growth  and  maturation  of  this  paediatric 
population, aged 10 to 18 years. 
Electrocardiogram:  During  the  open-label  treatment  phase,  the  RR  interval  had  a  steady  increase  from 
baseline, with a mean (SD) change from baseline of 31.7 (135.6) msec at Month 24. The most frequently 
reported  ECG  measurements  of  potential  clinical  relevance  in  de  novo  subjects  were  premature 
supraventricular  beat  (11  of  361  [3.0%]  subjects),  bradycardia  (9  of  361  [2.5%]  subjects),  sinus 
bradycardia  (9  of  361  [2.5%]  subjects),  right  bundle  branch  block  (6  of  361  [1.7%]  subjects),  and 
premature ventricular beat (6 of 361 [1.7%] subjects). The most frequently reported TEAEs related to ECG 
parameters in de novo subjects included conduction disorder (2 of 362 [0.6%] subjects) and prolonged QT 
electrocardiogram (2 of 362 [0.6%] subjects). 
Simpson-Angus Scale 
SAS  Total  Score  using  the  LOCF  dataset  decreased  throughout  the  open-label  treatment  phase  in  trial 
31-09-266. The mean (SD) change from baseline for de novo subjects at Month 12 was −0.46 (1.72) and at 
Month 24 was −0.53 (1.81). Similar data were observed using the OC dataset. 
New York Assessment for Adverse Cognitive Effects of Neuropsychiatric Treatment 
275 of 362 (76.0%) de novo subjects had any signs/symptoms (at least one occurrence) in the NY-AACENT; 
a majority of subjects had signs/symptoms of reasoning and problem solving (230 of 362 [63.5%] subjects), 
attention/vigilance  (221  of  362  [61.0%]  subjects),  social  cognition  (215  of  362  [59.4%]  subjects),  and 
speed of processing (198 of 362 [54.7%] subjects). Function-impaired signs/symptoms in the NY-AACENT 
were reported for 206 of 362 (56.9%) de novo subjects. The most frequently reported function-impaired 
signs/symptoms included reasoning and problem solving (168 of 362 [46.4%] subjects), social cognition 
(154  of  362  [42.5%]  subjects),  and  attention/vigilance  (150  of  362  [41.4%]  subjects).  Most  of  the 
NY-AACENT  signs/symptoms,  including  function-impaired  signs/symptoms,  were  mild  to  moderate  in 
severity.  Extreme  symptoms  were  reported  for  social  cognition  (4  of  510  [0.8%]  de  novo  subjects), 
reasoning and problem solving (2 of 510 [0.4%] de novo subjects), and attention/vigilance (1 of 510 [0.2%] 
de novo subjects). Trial medication-related, mild and moderate, function-impaired signs/symptoms in the 
NY-AACENT Total Score were reported for 1 to 3 subjects at each time point. No subjects had mean changes 
from baseline in the NY-AACENT Total Score of trial medication-related, function-impaired signs/symptoms 
that were considered severe or extreme.

Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale Cognitive Subscale Score 
Rapid symptom improvements for subjects with schizophrenia in PANSS Cognitive Subscale Score using the 
LOCF dataset were observed for de novo subjects during the first 3 to 4 months of the open-label treatment 
phase,  followed  by  gradual  improvement  for  the  duration  of  the  open-label  treatment  phase.  De  novo 
subjects had mean (SD) change from baseline of −2.07 (4.01) at Month 12 and −2.51 (4.01) at Month 24. 
Similar results were observed with the OC dataset. 
Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
There were no completed suicides in trial 31-09-266. During the open-label treatment phase, suicidality was 
reported on the C-SSRS by 30 of 360 (8.3%) de novo subjects and suicidal ideation was reported by 29 of 
360 (8.1%) de novo subjects. Worsening and emergence of suicidal ideation was reported by 25 of 360 
(6.9%) de novo subjects and 18 of 360 (5.0%) de novo subjects, respectively 
Tanner Staging 
Of the 362 de novo subjects with baseline and post-baseline Tanner Staging, 146 (40.3%) subjects who 
were not already at Tanner Stage 5 (adult sexual maturity) progress at least 1 stage from baseline as of the 
last assessment during the open-label treatment phase. A total of 132 de novo subjects (79 of 210 [37.6%] 
male subjects and 53 of 152 [34.9%] female subjects) were already at Tanner Stage 5 at baseline. Tanner 
Staging progression (i.e., 1 to 3 stages from baseline) was similar for male and female de novo subjects 
during aripiprazole treatment (87 of 210 [41.4%] male subjects and 59 of 152 [38.8%] female subjects). 
Laboratory findings 
No  clinically  meaningful  changes  from  baseline  were  observed  in  serum  chemistry,  haematology,  urine 
analysis and other laboratory test parameters in the open-label treatment phase of trial 31-09-266. 
The  frequencies  of  potentially  clinically  relevant  laboratory  values  were  comparable  for  aripiprazole  and 
placebo treatment with the exception of prolactin (58 [59.2%] subjects in the aripiprazole group and 13 
[27.1%] subjects in the placebo group). The prolactin baseline mean for the aripiprazole group was 4.26, 
and the last visit mean was 6.29. The prolactin baseline mean for the placebo group was 4.43, and the last 
visit mean was 9.79. Despite the laboratory values reported, these subjects remained asymptomatic. 
There  were  very  few  TEAEs  reported  that  were  related  to  clinical  laboratory  test  abnormalities  in  either 
treatment group. The aripiprazole group reported clinical laboratory test TEAEs of leukopenia and increased 
blood insulin in 2 (2.0%) subjects each. All other clinical laboratory test TEAEs were reported by 1 subject in 
either treatment group. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
(19.1%),  antiepileptics 
(98.1%),  anti-Parkinson  drugs 
385  of  510  (75.5%)  subjects  in  the  Open-label  Treatment  Phase  Enrolled  Sample  used  at  least  one 
concomitant medication prior to the start of the trial period, with incidences of use by de novo subjects and 
rollover subjects of 357 of 362 [98.6%] subjects and 28 of 148 [18.9%] subjects, respectively. The most 
frequently  administered  classes  of  medications  prior  to  the  start  of  the trial period  for  de  novo  subjects 
included  psycholeptics 
(16.3%),  and 
psychoanaleptics (15.7%). The most frequently administered medications for de novo subjects prior to the 
start of the trial period were risperidone (40.3%) and aripiprazole (29.0%). 274 of 283 (96.8%) subjects in 
the  Open-label  Treatment  Phase  Enrolled  Sample  used  at  least  one  concomitant  medication  in  the 
conversion phase, with incidences for de novo subjects and rollover subjects of 273 of 280 (97.5%) subjects 
and 1 of 3 (33.3%) subjects, respectively.. The most frequently administered classes of medications for de 
novo subjects during the conversion phase included psycholeptics (95.7%), anti-Parkinson drugs (22.9%), 
and antiepileptics (11.8%). The most frequently administered medications for de novo subjects during the 
conversion phase were risperidone (46.8%) and olanzapine (14.3%). 318 of 510 (62.4%) subjects in the 
Open-label  Treatment  Phase  Enrolled  Sample  used  at  least  one  concomitant  medication  during  the 
open-label treatment phase, with incidences of use by de novo subjects and rollover subjects of 255 of 362 
(70.4%) subjects and 63 of 148 (42.6%) subjects, respectively. The most frequently administered classes 
of medications for de novo subjects during the open-label treatment phase included psycholeptics (33.1%), 
analgesics (21.0%), psychoanaleptics (17.7%), anti-Parkinson drugs (17.4%), antiepileptics (16.0%), and 
antibacterial for systemic use (12.2%). The most frequently administered medication for de novo subjects 
Assessment report

during  the  open-label  treatment  phase  was  paracetamol  (16.6%).  427  of  510  (83.7%)  subjects  in  the 
Open-label Treatment Phase Enrolled Sample used at least one concomitant medication after the end of the 
trial period, with incidences of use by de novo subjects and rollover subjects of 316 of 362 (87.3%) subjects 
and 111 of 148 (75.0%) subjects, respectively. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The main reason  for discontinuation from the trial was the sponsor discontinuing the trial (180 subjects 
[89.6%]  total),  which  occurred  after  the  37th  event  of  exacerbation  of  psychotic  symptoms/impending 
relapse occurred. There was no detailed information about discontinuation due to AEs in the information 
provided. 
Study 31-09-267 
Patient exposure 
All subjects in trial 31-09-267 receiving at least 1 dose of IMP were included  in the safety dataset. 510 
subjects were exposed to at least 1 dose of aripiprazole in the open-label treatment phase at a mean (SD) 
daily dose of 18.1 (6.9) mg. The mean daily doses were the same for de novo and rollover subjects. A total 
of  273  of  362  (75.4%)  de  novo  subjects  received  >  372  to  776  days  of  aripiprazole  treatment  in  the 
open-label treatment phase. A total of 158 de novo subjects participated in the trial for more than 728 days: 
127 subjects with schizophrenia and 31 subjects with bipolar disorder. De novo subjects were allowed 24 
months  of  treatment  in  the  open-label  treatment  phase  while  rollover  subjects  were  only  allowed  a 
maximum of 12 months; thus, the mean (SD) aripiprazole treatment for de novo subjects was 547.9 (237.7) 
days. 70 of 362 de novo subjects ended treatment on a daily dose of 30 mg. The majority of subjects with 
bipolar disorder ended treatment in the open-label treatment phase on a dose of 10 to 20 mg, whereas 
subjects with schizophrenia were fairly evenly distributed between doses of 10 to 30 mg. In the conversion 
phase, 294 de novo subjects received a mean (SD) daily dose of 12.5 (3.2) mg aripiprazole. Subjects with 
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder received mean (SD) daily doses of 12.8 (3.1) mg and 10.7 (3.0) mg, 
respectively. 
A  total  of  524  subjects  entered this  trial  (297  subjects  in  the  conversion  phase  and  510  subjects  in  the 
open-label  treatment  phase).  Overall,  in  the  open-label  treatment  phase,  362  subjects  were  de  novo 
subjects (280 subjects entered into the conversion phase) and 148 subjects rolled over from Trial 31-09-266 
(3 subjects enrolled in the conversion phase prior to entering the open-label treatment phase). The number 
of subjects with schizophrenia that entered this trial at any phase was 427 and the number of subjects with 
bipolar disorder that entered this trial at any phase was 97. All of the subjects were analysed for safety (524 
subjects) and 507 of 510 (99.4%) subjects in the open-label treatment phase were analysed for efficacy. A 
total of 158 de novo subjects participated in the trial for more than 728 days: 127 with schizophrenia and 31 
with  bipolar  disorder.  The  de  novo  subset  of  the  subject  population  is  the  primary  dataset  for  the  PIP 
commitment. Only 198 of 524 (37.8%) subjects completed the trial; 14 of 297 (4.7%) subjects discontinued 
during the conversion phase and 312 of 510 (61.2%) subjects discontinued from the open-label treatment 
phase. De novo and rollover subjects discontinued from the open-label treatment phase at rates of 185 of 
362 (51.1%) subjects and 127 of 148 [85.8%] subjects, respectively. Subjects with bipolar disorder and 
subjects with schizophrenia discontinued from the open-label treatment phase at similar rates (59 of 94 
[62.8%] subjects and 253 of 416 [60.8%] subjects, respectively). The most frequent reasons for subject 
discontinuation  during  any  phase  were  sponsor  discontinued  trial  (31.5%),  subject  withdrew  consent 
(13.7%), and AE (6.9%). Most of the premature study discontinuations were from the open-label treatment 
phase rather than from the conversion phase. Of the most frequent reasons for subject discontinuation, de 
novo subjects and rollover subjects discontinued from the open-label treatment phase because the sponsor 
discontinued trial (16.3% and 71.6%, respectively). De novo and rollover subjects discontinued from the 
open-label treatment phase due to subject withdrew consent at rates of 14.4% and 8.8%, respectively, and 
due  to  AEs  at  rates  of  7.7%  and  3.4%,  respectively.  Of  the  most  frequent  reasons  for  subject 
discontinuation,  schizophrenia  subjects  and  bipolar  subjects  discontinued  from  the  open-label  treatment 
phase  because  sponsor  discontinued  trial  at  rates  of  38.2%  and  6.4%,  respectively,  and  subjects  with 
schizophrenia or bipolar disorder discontinued from the open-label treatment phase due to subject withdrew 
consent  at  rates  of  11.8%  and  17.0%,  respectively).  For  all  subjects,  the  most  frequent  reason  for 
withdrawal of consent was the refusal of subjects who had just turned 18 years of age to sign the ICF.  
Only de novo subjects had up to 2 years of exposure, rollover subjects had up to 1 year of exposure. The de 
novo  portion  of  the  dataset  is  intended  to  address  the  PIP  commitment,  as  described  above;  rollover 
subjects  received  open-label  treatment  after  the  participation  of  the  placebo-controlled  study  in  a 
compassionate use basis. The length of exposure is different between the de novo and rollover cohorts;

Table: subject enrolment per country  
Overall,  172  of  297  (57.9%)  subjects  were  enrolled  in  the  conversion  phase  for  43  to  50  days  (all  172 
subjects were de novo subjects). The incidence of bipolar and schizophrenic subjects who enrolled in the 
conversion phase for 43 to 50 days was 23 of 43 (53.5%) and 149 of 254 (58.7%), respectively. A total of 
298 of 510 (58.4%) subjects were enrolled in the open-label treatment phase for at least 12 months (365 to 
378 days), including 18 of 148 (12.2%) rollover subjects and 280 of 362 (77.3%) de novo subjects. Of these 
298  subjects,  58  of  94  (61.7%)  subjects  had  bipolar  disorder  and  240  of  416  (57.7%)  subjects  had  a 
diagnosis of schizophrenia. One hundred fifty-eight of 362 (43.6%) de novo subjects were enrolled in the 
open-label treatment phase for the maximum time allowed (> 728 to 777 days); rollover subjects were only 
permitted a maximum of 12 months of treatment in the open-label treatment phase. Of these 158 subjects, 
31  of  94  (33.0%)  subjects  with  bipolar  disorder  and  127  of  416  (30.5%)  subjects  with  schizophrenia 
remained in the trial for the 2-year interval. 
Adverse events 
In trial 31-09-267, 349 of 510 (68.4%) subjects experienced a total of 1156 TEAEs. The incidence of TEAEs 
among  de  novo  subjects  was  278  of  362  (76.8%)  subjects  and  the  incidence  of  TEAEs  among  rollover 
subjects was 71 of 148 (48.0%) subjects. A total of 49 of 510 (9.6%) subjects experienced at least 1 serious 
TEAE. The rates of serious and severe TEAEs among de novo subjects were 42 of 362 (11.6%) subjects and 
30 of 362 (8.3%) subjects, respectively, and for rollover subjects were 7 of 148 (4.7%) subjects and 3 of 
148 (2.0%) subjects, respectively. A total of 32 of 510 (6.3%) subjects discontinued the trial medication due 
to an AE. The incidence of de novo and rollover subjects who discontinued trial medication due to AEs was 
27 of 362 (7.5%) subjects and 5 of 148 (3.4%) subjects, respectively. In the conversion phase, 122 of 294 
(41.5%) de novo subjects reported a TEAE. Two of 294 (0.7%) de novo subjects reported a serious TEAE 
and 3 of 294 (1.0%) de novo subjects discontinued the trial due to AEs.

Common Adverse Events 
In trial 31-09-267, 349 of 510 (68.4%) subjects experienced a total of 1156 TEAEs: 278 of 362 (76.8%) de 
novo subjects and 71 of 148 (48.0%) rollover subjects. A total of 49 of 510 (9.6%) subjects experienced at 
least 1 serious TEAE: 42 of 362 (11.6%) de novo subjects and 7 of 148 (4.7%) rollover subjects. A total of 
203 of 510 (39.8%) subjects had at least 1 TEAE that was considered by the investigator to be potentially 
causally related to the IMP: 163 of 362 (45.0%) de novo subjects and 40 of 148 (27.0%) rollover subjects. 
TEAEs 
The most commonly reported TEAEs among de novo subjects were headache (61 of 362 [16.9%] subjects), 
schizophrenia (33 of 362 [9.1%] subjects), increased weight (32 of 362 [8.8%] subjects), anxiety (30 of 
362 [8.3%] subjects), somnolence (30 of 362 [8.3%] subjects), and nasopharyngitis (29 of 362 [8.0%] 
subjects).  In  the  conversion  phase,  the  most  commonly  reported  TEAEs  in  de  novo  subjects  included 
headache (7.8%) and somnolence (6.8%).

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
The 1 death (accidental acute heroin toxicity in a de novo subject) that occurred during trial 31-09-267 was 
not suicide-related and unrelated to trial drug. On Day 572 of the open-label treatment phase, the subject 
died of accidental acute heroin toxicity (MedDRA preferred term: toxicity to various agents). The s-ubject, a 
17-year-old  white  male,  was  a  de  novo  subject  with  a  diagnosis  of  bipolar  disorder.  The  subject  had  a 
negative  drug  screen  at  screening  and  baseline,  but  tested  positive  for  cocaine/metabol  and 
tetrahydrocannabinol at Month 3. A retest was negative as well as the Month 6 drug screen. The subject then 
tested positive for tetrahydrocannabinol at Month 9, 12, and 15. Morphine was also detected at Month 12. 
After the third consecutive positive tetrahydrocannabinoil result, the clinical team held a case conference

and detailed the clinical picture and management plan in a note to file. The subject was not deemed to have 
met substance dependence criteria. Cannabis use was reported as sporadic and due to contextual factors. 
The  subject  had  insomnia,  was  working  unsociable  hours,  and  sharing  a  flat  with  friends  who  smoked 
cannabis. The subject had recently moved back home. At the last visit, prior to the subject’s death (10 days 
before), drug screen was negative for tetrahydrocannabinol. The PI did not believe that the subject met 
withdrawal criteria based on his illicit drug use. The subject was counselled on the use of these drugs while 
participating in the trial. On Day 572, the subject had been found nonresponsive in his bed; emergency 
services  were  called  and  the  subject  was  taken  to  the  hospital.  The  subject  was  reportedly  alive  during 
transport and died at the hospital. He had been healthy and did not report any suicidal thoughts. Ongoing 
concomitant  medication  included  trazodone  hydrochloride  and  lisdexamfetamine  mesylate.  An  autopsy 
provided the following pathological diagnoses: acute and chronic prescription drug and illicit drug abuse with 
acute heroin toxicity; haemorrhages and puncture marks in the right antecubital fossa; history of alprazolam 
abuse; pulmonary oedema; hypertensive cardiovascular disease with cardiac hypertrophy (450 g). Femoral 
blood specimen noted 6-monoacetylmorphine < 0.01 mg/L, codeine 0.01 mg/L, marijuana metabolite was 
revealed 
presumptive  positive,  and  morphine  0.12  mg/L.  Stomach 
6-monoacetylmorphine < 0.25 mg/L, codeine 0.43 mg/L, and morphine 2.5 mg/L. Urine specimen showed 
6-monoacetylmorphine  1.5  mg/L,  codeine  0.17  mg/L,  and  morphine  >  2.0  mg/L.  The  fatal  TEAE  was 
considered severe and unrelated to trial medication.

Other SAEs 
Serious TEAEs were reported for a total of 49 of 510 (9.6%) subjects. The incidence of serious TEAEs for de 
novo  subjects  and  rollover  subjects  were  42  of  362  (11.6%)  subjects  and  7  of  148  (4.7%)  subjects, 
respectively. The most frequently reported serious TEAEs in de novo subjects were schizophrenia (14 of 362 
[3.9%]  subjects),  suicidal  ideation  (8  of  362  [2.2%]  in  subjects),  bipolar  disorder  (7  of  362  [1.9%] 
subjects),  aggression  (3  of  362  [0.8%]  subjects),  agitation  (2  of  362  [0.6%]  subjects),  and  auditory 
hallucination (2 of 362 [0.6%] subjects). All serious TEAEs of suicidal ideation were reported for de novo 
subjects. In the conversion phase, serious TEAEs were reported for 2 de novo subjects: tooth disorder was 
reported for a subject with schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder for a subjects with bipolar disorder.

Other significant AEs 
Adverse events of special interest for trial 31-09-267 are described in detail below. 
Extrapyramidal Symptoms 
Overall,  in  the  open-label  treatment  phase,  EPS-related  TEAEs  were  reported  for  58  of  510  (11.4%) 
subjects: 48 of 362 (13.3%) de novo subjects and 10 of 148 (6.8%) rollover subjects. The most frequently 
reported  EPS-related  TEAEs  for  de  novo  subjects  were  akathisia  (17  of  362  [4.7%]  subjects)  and 
extrapyramidal  disorder  (15  of  362  [4.1%]  subjects).  No  EPS-related  TEAEs  were  serious  or  led  to  the 
discontinuation of trial medication. 
Orthostasis 
A total of 5 of 510 (1.0%) subjects experienced orthostasis-related TEAEs in the open-label treatment phase 
(5 of 362 [1.4%] de novo subjects). The TEAEs included syncope (3 of 362 [0.8%] de novo subjects) and 
orthostatic hypotension (2 of 263 [0.6%] de novo subjects). The events were not serious and did not result 
in the discontinuation of trial medication. 
Suicide 
A total of 17 of 510 (3.3%) subjects experienced suicide-related TEAEs in the open-label treatment phase: 
14 of 362 (3.9%) de novo subjects and 3 of 148 (2.0%) rollover subjects. 
The most frequently reported suicide-related TEAE for de novo subjects was suicidal ideation, which was 
reported  for  9  of  362  (2.5%)  subjects.  Serious  TEAEs  that  were  reported  for  de  novo  subjects  included 
suicide attempt (1 of 362 [0.3%] subjects), suicidal ideation (8 of 362 [2.2%] subjects with 1 of these TEAEs 
considered to be potentially causally related to IMP), and intentional overdose. Three of these serious TEAEs 
led to the discontinuation of trial medication (suicidal ideation for 2 of 362 [0.6%] subjects and intentional 
overdose for 1 of 362 [0.3%] subjects. Of note, the death that occurred in this trial was not suicide related.

Sedation and Somnolence 
A  total  of  37  of  510  (7.3%)  subjects  experienced  a  sedation-  or  somnolence-related  TEAE  during  the 
open-label treatment phase: 34 of 362 (9.4%) de novo subjects and 3 of 148 (2.0%) rollover subjects. 
Somnolence was more prevalent than sedation (30 of 362 [8.3%] de novo subjects and 4 of 362 [1.1%] de 
novo  subjects,  respectively).  No  sedation  or  somnolence-related  TEAEs  were  serious  or  resulted  in  the 
discontinuation of IMP. 
Glucose 
In the open-label treatment phase, glucose-related TEAEs were reported for only 2 of 510 (0.4%) subjects. 
Both events were reported in de novo subjects. These TEAEs were increased blood glucose and metabolic 
syndrome. None of the TEAEs related to glucose levels were serious or resulted in the discontinuation of trial 
medication. All glucose-related TEAEs considered to be potentially causally related to IMP. 
Lipid Parameters 
In  the  open-label  treatment  phase,  lipid  parameter-related  TEAEs  were  reported  for  2  of  510  (0.4%) 
subjects.  Both  events  were  reported  in  de  novo  subjects.  The  lipid  parameter-related  TEAEs  included 
increased high-density lipoprotein and hypercholesterolemia. None of the TEAEs related to lipid parameters 
were serious or resulted in the discontinuation of trial medication. All lipids parameter-related TEAEs were 
considered to be potentially causally related to IMP. 
Weight Gain 
A total of 52 of 510 (10.2%) subjects experienced a weight gain-related TEAE in the open-label treatment 
phase: 43 of 362 (11.9%) de novo subjects and 9 of 148 (6.1%) rollover subjects. The most frequently 
reported weight-gain TEAE for de novo subjects was increased weight (32 of 362 [8.8%] subjects). None of 
the TEAEs related to weight gain in de novo subjects were serious; however, one TEAE of increased weight 
resulted in the discontinuation of trial medication. 
Prolactin 
In the open-label treatment phase, prolactin-related TEAEs were reported for 3 of 510 (0.6%) subjects: 1 of 
362 (0.3%) de novo subjects and 2 of 148 (1.4%) rollover subjects. The prolactin-related TEAE of increased 
blood prolactin was reported for 1 of 362 (0.3%) de novo subjects with schizophrenia (female). This event 
was not serious and did not result in discontinuation of trial medication. 
Hepatic 
Hepatic-related TEAEs were reported for 4 of 510 (0.8%) subjects in the open-label treatment phase: 3 of 
362 (0.8%) de novo subjects and 1 of 148 (0.7%) rollover subjects. The hepatic-related TEAEs reported by 
de novo subjects included increased ALT (1 of 362 [0.3%] subjects) and increased blood bilirubin (2 of 362 
[0.6%] subjects). These events did not result in discontinuation of trial medication. 
New York Assessment for Adverse Cognitive Effects of Neuropsychiatric Treatment 
In the double-blind maintenance, similar frequencies of signs and symptoms of cognitive side effects were 
seen for the aripiprazole-treated subjects and placebo-treated subjects. The sign/symptom with the largest 
difference between treatment groups was for adverse effects on reasoning and problem solving (61 [62.2%] 
subjects in the aripiprazole group and 34 [70.8%] subjects in the placebo group). No notable changes from 
baseline by week were seen for the NY-AACENT total score of drug-related, mild, function impaired signs or 
symptoms in the OC dataset. No notable changes from baseline by week were seen for the NY-AACENT total 
score of drug-related, moderate, function impaired signs or symptoms in the OC dataset. In general, the 
NY-AACENT scale could not distinguish between cognitive side effects due to schizophrenia or due to the use 
of neuroleptics. There was no apparent drug-relationship for cognitive side effects.

Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
There were no completed suicides in trial 31-09-266. During the open-label treatment phase, suicidality was 
reported on the C-SSRS by 30 of 360 (8.3%) de novo subjects and suicidal ideation was reported by 29 of 
360 (8.1%) de novo subjects. Worsening and emergence of suicidal ideation was reported by 25 of 360 
(6.9%) de novo subjects and 18 of 360 (5.0%) de novo subjects, respectively. For the open-label treatment 
phase, based on the C-SSRS, actual suicide attempts were reported for 2 of 360 (0.6%) de novo subjects, 
interrupted attempts were reported for 1 of 360 (0.3%) de novo subjects, and preparatory acts or behaviour 
was  reported  for  1  of  360  (0.3%)  de  novo  subjects.  Suicidal  ideation  for  de  novo  subjects  during  the 
open-label  treatment  period  included  wish  to  be  dead  (24  of  360  [6.7%]  subjects),  nonspecific  active 
suicidal  thoughts  (18  of  360  [5.0%]  subjects),  active  suicidal  ideation  without  intent  to  act  (11  of  360 
[3.1%] subjects), active suicidal ideation with some intent to act but without a specific plan (7 of 360 [1.9%] 
subjects), and active suicidal ideation with a specific plan and intent (1 of 360 [0.3%] subjects). During the 
conversion  and  open-label  treatment  phases,  the  mean  C-SSRS  Suicidal  Ideation  Intensity  Total  Score 
decreased from baseline to approximately 0 at Week 1 and generally remained steady throughout the phase 
overall and for most groups. The mean change from baseline in suicidal ideation intensity total score was = 
0.0 at all visits for both treatment groups in trial 31-09-267. 
Tanner Staging 
Of 98 aripiprazole-treated subjects with baseline and follow-up Tanner staging, 26 (26.5%) progressed 1 or 
2 stages from baseline as of the last assessment. Of 48 placebo-treated subjects with baseline and follow-up 
Tanner staging, 8 (16.7%) progressed 1 or 2 stages as of the last assessment. 
Paediatric Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire 
In  the  double-blind  maintenance  phase  of  trial  31-09-267,  there  was  no  statistical  difference  between 
treatment groups in the mean change from baseline in P-QLES-Q total score by week for the LOCF and OC 
datasets. Similar results were seen in the adjusted mean change from baseline in P-QLES-Q total score by 
week for the LOCF and OC datasets. Results from the mean by week in the P-QLES-Q overall score for the 
LOCF dataset showed subjects in the aripiprazole groups stayed about the same and placebo decreased 
(worsened). Results from the mean by week in the P-QLES-Q overall score for the OC dataset showed an 
increase  (improvement)  by  Week  24  in  the  aripiprazole  group  and  then  a  decrease  by  Week  52  to  the 
baseline mean. The placebo group showed an increase from baseline in mean at Week 24 and 52 and then 
a decrease by last visit. 
Laboratory findings 
No  clinically  meaningful  changes  from  baseline  were  observed  in  serum  chemistry,  haematology,  urine 
analysis and other laboratory test parameters in the double-blind maintenance phase of trial 31-09-267. 
The  most  frequently  reported  incidences  of  potentially  clinically  relevant  chemistry  values  for  de  novo 
subjects were chloride (133 of 358 [37.2%] subjects, inorganic phosphorus (106 of 359 [29.5%] subjects), 
and fasting HDL cholesterol (94 of 348 [27.0%] subjects). No abnormal haematology results of potential 
clinical  relevance  were  reported  for  more  than  5%  of  subjects  overall.  The  most  frequently  reported 
potentially  clinically  relevant  urinalysis  parameters  for  de  novo  subjects  were  urine  protein  (259  of  351 
[73.8%]  subjects)  and  specific  gravity  (139  of  360  [38.6%]  subjects).  The  most  frequently  reported 
potentially clinically relevant other laboratory assessment for de novo subjects was prolactin (236 of 360 
[65.6%] subjects. Prolactin levels > 2 × ULN at any post-baseline visit were reported for 13 of 360 (3.6%) 
de novo subjects (9 female and 4 male subjects); all subjects had a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Prolactin 
levels > 3 × ULN at any post-baseline visit were reported for 6 of 360 (1.7%) de novo subjects (all female 
subjects); all subjects had schizophrenia. The most frequently reported clinical laboratory-related TEAEs for 
de novo subjects were increased blood CPK (7 of 362 [1.9%] subjects) and proteinuria (4 of 362 [1.1%] 
subjects). One potential Hy’s law case was reported during this trial. On Day 48 of the open-label treatment 
phase, Subject 139-0074, a 16-year-old male with schizophrenia, who had previously received aripiprazole 
for 4 months in Trial 31-09-266, had potentially clinically relevant elevations in ALT (483 U/L; ULN: 43 U/L), 
AST (253 U/L; ULN: 40 U/L), and total bilirubin (5.3 mg/dL; ULN: 1.2 mg/dL). On Day 46, a TEAE of hepatitis 
A was reported for this subject. The TEAE was mild in severity, was not considered by the investigator to be 
causally related to IMP, and resulted in the discontinuation of trial medication. 
Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety 
Assessment report  
EMA/702260/2016 
Page 47/54 
 
  
  
A  total  of  24  (16.4%)  subjects  reported  a  potentially  clinically  relevant  weight  gain  ≥  7  %  during  the 
double-blind maintenance phase: 20 (20.4%) in the aripiprazole group and 4 (8.3%) in the placebo group. 
This was not unexpected, as weight gain is a known side effect of aripiprazole. Of the subjects who gained 
≥ 7 % during the double-blind maintenance phase, 16 aripiprazole subjects and 4 placebo subjects had low 
BMI (< 23 kg/m2) at baseline, 2 aripiprazole subjects and 0 placebo subjects had average BMI (≥ 23 - ≤ 27 
kg/m2) at baseline and 2 aripiprazole subjects and 0 placebo subjects had higher than average BMI (> 27 
kg/m2) at baseline. Thus, the majority of the subjects who gained more than 7% weight from baseline to 
last visit had low BMI. This finding is similar to the analysis of weight increase in other paediatric programs. 
A total of 15 (10.3%) subjects reported a potentially clinically relevant increase ≥ 15 mmHg in standing 
diastolic blood pressure: 11 (11.2%) subjects in the aripiprazole group and 4 (8.3%) subjects in the placebo 
group. All other incidences of vital signs of potential clinical relevance were reported by fewer than 8% of 
subjects  in  either  treatment  group.  Potentially  clinically  relevant  vital  signs  were  comparable  for  the 
aripiprazole and placebo groups. 
The most frequently reported TEAE related to vital signs was weight increased reported by 8 (8.2%) subjects 
in the aripiprazole group and 5 (10.4%) subjects in the placebo group. All other TEAEs related to vital signs 
were reported by 2 or fewer subjects in the aripiprazole group. 
Incidence of weight gain (≥ 7 % change from baseline) was 14.3% in the aripiprazole group compared to 
8.3% in the placebo group at last visit. Weight loss (≥ 7 % change from baseline) was comparable between 
the  aripiprazole  and  placebo  groups.  Weight  changes  were  in  line  with  aripiprazole  paediatric  data  for 
subjects aged 13 to 17 years. 
Electrocardiogram 
No  clinically  meaningful  changes  from  baseline  were  observed  in  ECG  parameters  in  the  double-blind 
maintenance phase. The incidence of potentially clinically relevant ECG measurements was similar for the 
aripiprazole and placebo treatment groups. Electrocardiogram-related TEAEs were reported more frequently 
in the aripiprazole group than in the placebo group. One (2.1%) subject in the placebo group reported a 
TEAE of tachycardia and 2 (2.0%) subjects in the aripiprazole group reported a TEAE of tachycardia. Two 
(2.0%) subjects in the aripiprazole group reported a TEAE of arrhythmia. All other ECG-related TEAEs were 
reported by 1 (1.0%) subject in the aripiprazole group. 
Safety in special populations 
Pregnancy 
Two pregnancies were reported during the trial. Subject 619-5402, a de novo subject, became pregnant 
during the trial while taking oral contraceptives; the last dose of trial medication was taken on Day 174, after 
learning  of  the  pregnancy.  She  delivered  a  healthy  male  infant  by  spontaneous  vaginal  delivery  at 
gestational age of 40 weeks after an unremarkable pregnancy. The birth was uncomplicated; however, there 
was a period of physiological jaundice. At the infant’s 4-month check-up, the child had reached all normal 
developmental milestones. 
Subject 617-5069, a de novo subject, was sexually assaulted and became pregnant during the trial; the last 
dose of trial medication was taken on Day 260, after learning of the pregnancy. The subject gave birth to a 
female  infant  by  spontaneous  vacuum-assisted  vaginal  delivery  at  gestational  age  38.4  weeks.  The 
new-born had the umbilical cord wrapped 3 times around her leg, a caput succedaneum, a large middle digit 
on the right hand, bilateral wrist drop, upper extremity increased tone, and lower extremity decreased tone. 
There were no further updates to the condition of either mother or child. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Concomitant Medications 
A  larger  number  and  percentage  of  subjects  in  the  aripiprazole  group  received  concomitant  medication 
during  the  double-blind  maintenance  than  in  the  placebo  group,  43  (43.9%)  subjects  compared  to  17 
(35.4%),  respectively.  The  most  frequently  taken  concomitant  medications  during  the  double-blind 
maintenance were trihexyphenidyl (6 [6.1%] subjects in the aripiprazole group and 5 [10.4%] subjects in 
the placebo group), paracetamol (11 [11.2%] subjects in the aripiprazole group and 3 [6.3%] subjects in 
Assessment report  
EMA/702260/2016

the placebo group), and clonazepam (6 [6.1%] subjects in the aripiprazole group and 4 [8.3%] subjects in 
the placebo group). All other concomitant medications were taken by 12% or less of subjects. During the 
double-blind maintenance, the mean (SD) average daily dose of anticholinergic agents (as mg benztropine 
equivalents) was 1.38 (1.05) in the aripiprazole group and 0.83 (0.74) for the placebo group. The mean (SD) 
average daily dose of benzodiazepine derivatives during the double-blind maintenance (as mg lorazepam 
equivalents) was 1.59 (1.50) in the aripiprazole group and 0.70 (0.87) in the placebo group. 
Overdose 
In Trial 31-09-267, one death of accidental overdose (MedDRA preferred term: toxicity to various agents) 
was reported and was not suicide-related. 
Drug Abuse 
No clinical trials were conducted to evaluate aripiprazole potential for abuse, tolerance, or physical 
dependence 
Withdrawal and Rebound 
No trials were conducted to assess withdrawal and rebound. Adverse events were followed for 30 days after 
stopping IMP. 
Effects on Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery or Impairment of Mental Ability 
No trials were conducted to assess effects on ability to drive or operate machinery or impairment of mental 
ability. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The incidence of TEAEs resulting in discontinuation of the IMP was lower in the younger versus the older 
subgroup (4.5% vs 8.8%, respectively). The TEAEs resulting in discontinuation of the IMP for more than one 
subject overall included schizophrenia, which was more frequent among the older paediatric subjects, and 
suicidal ideation, which occurred for one subject in both age subgroups.

3.2.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In  Trial  31-09-267,  safety  was  evaluated  over  2  years  in  subjects  with  either  bipolar  disorder  or 
schizophrenia. 
Safety seemed generally comparable between the age subgroups (OL treatment phase, de novo subjects), 
and for the specific safety topics noted in the PIP: 
•  The overall incidence of TEAEs, as well as the incidence of those TEAEs considered serious or severe, 
was comparable across pediatric age subgroups. The incidence of AEs resulting in discontinuation of 
the  IMP  occurred  less  frequently  for  subjects  in  the  younger  subgroup  (4.5%)  versus  the  older 
subgroup (8.8%). 
•  Of TEAEs occurring in ≥ 5% of subjects in any age group, the younger subgroup had a higher (by at 
least  2-fold)  incidence  of  oropharyngeal  pain  and  aggression  and  a  lower  (by  at  least  2-fold) 
incidence  of  tremor,  akathisia,  and  extrapyramidal  disorder  compared  with  the  older  pediatric 
subgroup. 
• 
For  serious  TEAEs  that  occurred  for  >  2  subjects  overall,  the  younger  subgroup  had  a  higher 
incidence (by at least 2-fold) of serious suicidal ideation and aggression and a lower incidence (by at 
least 2-fold) of serious schizophrenia compared with the older pediatric subgroup. 
•  Of the TEAEs of special interest: 
o  Sedation/somnolence-related  TEAEs  occurred  for  6.3%  and  10.8%  of  subjects  in  the 
younger and older pediatric groups, respectively; most were events of somnolence. 
o  Glucose-related TEAEs occurred infrequently in both age subgroups (1 subject per group). 
Of subjects with normal fasting insulin levels at baseline, levels were high at the last visit for 
19/98 (19.4%) subjects in the younger group and 33/231 (14.3%) subjects in the older 
pediatric group. 
o  Weight gain-related TEAEs occurred for 13.4% and 11.2% of subjects in the younger and 
older pediatric groups, respectively. No clinically meaningful changes from baseline were 
observed for weight or BMI as determined by an assessment of z-scores. 
o  One subject in the older pediatric subgroup had a prolactin-related TEAE (blood prolactin 
increased). 
o  Using the NY-AACENT, the incidence of adverse cognitive effects was comparable across age 
subgroups,  with  those  effects  relating  to  reasoning  and  problem  solving  being  the  most 
frequent (overall and in both the younger [71.4%] and older [60.0%] pediatric subgroups). 
o  Of  the  362  de  novo  subjects,  132  entered  the trial at  Tanner  Stage  5.  Of  the  remaining 
subjects, Tanner Stage progression was observed for: 5/5 (100%) subjects with Tanner 1 at 
baseline; 19/23 (82.6%) subjects with Tanner 2 at baseline; 44/62 (71.0%) subjects with 
Tanner 3 at baseline; and 78/140 (55.7%) subjects with Tanner 4 at baseline. 
3.2.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Study 31-09-266 
The aripiprazole and placebo groups reported a similar percentage of TEAEs in the double-blind 
maintenance. The most frequently reported TEAEs in either treatment group were schizophrenia/psychotic 
disorder, insomnia, psychotic disorder, and weight increased. The aripiprazole group reported fewer serious 
TEAEs than the placebo group in the double-blind maintenance. No adverse events of special interest

occurred with more frequency in aripiprazole-treated subjects as compared to placebo in the double blind 
maintenance. 
No clinically meaningful changes from baseline were presented in vital sign parameters or ECG parameters, 
in serum chemistry, haematology, urinalysis or other laboratory test parameters in the double-blind 
maintenance phase, including serum prolactin concentrations. 
No drug-induced liver events were reported. Weight and BMI changes were not presented on a case by case 
to assess clinical significance. Also, the global results between aripiprazole and placebo treatment in 
NY-AACENT scales are presented, but the entire results are not. Given the observed differences in study 
31-09-267, the results from 266 study are expected to be relevant. There seems to be no delay in sexual 
maturation associated with aripiprazole treatment based on Tanner staging, but the number of young 
patients was low. 
Due to the small study duration for most enrolled patients, long-term safety was not thoroughly assessed, 
particularly in the younger group, where a small number of patients was studied. 
Study 31-09-267 
Data on aripiprazole in adolescent patients with schizophrenia was provided. Safety was evaluated over 2 
years in subjects with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia without any apparent loss of efficacy. 
The most frequently reported AEs of special interest (7% to 12%) were EPS, weight gain, and 
sedation/somnolence-related TEAEs with suicide and orthostasis related TEAEs reported less frequently (1% 
to 4%). No NMS- or seizure related TEAEs were reported. 
Weight and BMI data was presented on a patient basis, in order to admit them non clinically relevant, upon 
RfSI. Although there were no striking differences for most patients in the z-score of BMI / weight gain, the 
fact was that most patients were followed for a limited period of time – usually less than one year – and 
patients were not given enough time to increase weight / BMI. 
Potentially clinically relevant findings for any type of ECG abnormality occurred in < 4% of subjects. 
Overall, 42% of males and 37% of females entered the trial at Tanner Stage 5 (adult sexual maturity); 34% 
of males and 37% of females progress at least 1 stage as of the last assessment. 
Study 31-09-267 does not allow a reliable safety assessment as selection occurs i.e. only patients who 
benefit and have no safety problems continue. The duration of the trial was very short to allow firm 
conclusions on discontinuation rates over time and reasons for discontinuation. 
Children in the 10-14 age range are less prone to complain and report adverse events than adolescents 
15-17. Even in the older age group, a significant number of patients refused to continue in the trial the 
moment they turned 18 years old and did not revalidate informed consent. During the procedure, the MAH 
discussed the rate of adverse events leading to discontinuation, the UKU scale and NY-AACENT scale in both 
13-14 and 15-17 age groups, and found no relevant difference among groups in their response to 
aripiprazole vs placebo. The CHMP concluded that the behaviour was apparently similar in the magnitude of 
events, and that the explanation could be considered adequate.

4.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The design of the Study 31-09-266 allows for a comparison of Relapse rates as the main measure of 
beneficial effect. The point estimate for this endpoint favours Aripiprazole over Placebo both for the whole 
population studies (0.461) and for the patients aged 13 and 14 (0.495). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Due to the low number or subjects (n = 41) and events (n = 11), the estimation of the HR in the subjects 
aged 13 and 14 years is extremely imprecise, with a 95% CI ranging from 0.151 to 1.628, not allowing for 
any firm conclusion on the existence (and on the direction) of a difference. This is confirmed by the log-rank 
test that fails, for this population, to reject the null hypothesis of absence of treatment effect (p = 0.2378). 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects and Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Adverse events cumulative over time such as weight gain independent of height growth are forcefully 
unidentified in a shorter than one year follow up duration. Moreover, considering that in bipolar disorder the 
PASS study showed that the lower age range had the higher risk for weight gain, the available evidence does 
not allow us to believe that younger schizophrenia paediatric patients would behave differently. However, 
the applicant has demonstrated that objective measures such as Z-scores showed limited changes. 
In general, the short follow-up time and the small size limit the interpretability of the safety findings from 
study 31-09-266. The interpretability of the additional information in Study 31-09-267, additionally, could 
also be affected by the fact that part of the population on this study (30%) is somehow a selected subset of 
the population in the previous study (i.e. that only patients who benefit and have no safety problems 
continue in this study).

Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
The CHMP acknowledged that schizophrenia is a rare condition in 13-14 years old of age, a population where 
there is an unmet need and where diagnosis can be difficult.

In study 266, the results differed between the 13-14 age range group and the 15-17 age range group. In 
particular, despite the point estimates of the hazard ratio of relapse were very similar (0.495 for 13 - 14 
years old patients; 0.454, for 15 - 17 years old patients), the precision of these estimation – possibly also 
due to the small number (n= 41) of patients between 13 and 14 years - was different. While the 95% 
confidence interval for hazard ratio in older patients does not include the absence of treatment effect (0.242 
to 0.879), it does not allow the same conclusion for the younger subgroup (0.151 1.628). This is consistent 
with the log-rank test that allows to refuse the hypothesis of absence of treatment effect for the older 
subgroup (p = 0.0161) but fails to do the same in the younger subgroup (p = 0.2378).  
Concerns were also raised on the validity of the schizophrenia diagnosis in study 266 due to the very high 
remitter’s rate in the short follow-up. This has been explained by the rate being actually a less-than-annual 
rate due to study discontinuation for sponsor’s decision.  
Moreover there were issues about external validity of the results as trials were carried out mostly outside EU, 
as in EU most IRB do not allow placebo trials in schizophrenia adolescents. Indeed 25% of patients in study 
267 were from EU (all from Eastern Europe) and 12% in study 266 (albeit from a single country – Romania).  
A comparison between EU countries and the other world regions did not exhibit relevant differences. This 
comparison however was between Eastern Countries and the rest of the world, and not between EU non 
Eastern vs Eastern countries. So concern still remained on the generalizability of the results to the whole EU 
population  
Moreover, the safety issues identified in children make the benefit-risk ratio even less positive in the younger 
age group. Data on safety was considered either too short or too directed towards ruling out adverse events. 
Patient number is both very short and shortly studied. At the best case scenario, in the medium term the 
most troublesome adverse events for children and adolescents seem to be less frequent in schizophrenia 
patients as compared to bipolar patients, but even this comparison must be considered with caution, as 
study duration and population refinement in the schizophrenia patients decrease the chance of TEAE as 
compared to the trial on bipolar patients. 
Having reviewed the data provided by the company, and especially in view of the uncertainties, the CHMP 
considered that there was sufficient efficacy data to support the indication of 15 year old and above, but not 
in the 13-14 year old children.   
However information of the withdrawal study (Trial 31-09-266) including specific information about the 
lower age ranges, might be important for physicians. Therefore, it was proposed to add the results of the 
randomised withdrawal study to section 5.1, to which the MAH agreed.

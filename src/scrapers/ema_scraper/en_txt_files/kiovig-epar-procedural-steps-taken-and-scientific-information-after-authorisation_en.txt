Based on new safety data the manufacturer proposes an

update of the Product Information. The changes reflect the 
Update of section 4.4 of the SmPC in order to include 
a new warning on possible false positive testing of 
assays used for diagnosis of fungal infections 
depending on detection of beta-D-glucans and to 
amend the existing warning on aseptic meningitis 
syndrome. Minor changes are made to the existing 
warnings on thromboembolic events and acute renal 
failure. The RMP is updated in relation to the new 
warning and to include the changes requested during 
the assessment of variation 
EMEA/H/C/0000628/II/0056. 
possibility of false positive readings in detection of ß-d-
glucans for diagnosis of fungal infections, the higher 
incidence of aseptic meningitis syndrome (AMS) in female 
patients and its lack of dependency on dosage of 
administered immunoglobulin. They also make treating 
physicians more aware of thromboembolism and renal 
failure in patients requiring intravenous immunoglobulins. 
Due to new safety information with KIOVIG the list of 
adverse events has been updated.

Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC in order to revise

adverse drug reactions based on information from 
several clinical studies in which KIOVIG was used as 
investigational medicinal product.  Safety information 
from clinical trials is deleted from section 4.8 of the 
SmPC for simplification. The Package Leaflet is 
updated accordingly. The MAH took also the 
opportunity to implement QRD version 9.1 and to 
update the details of the local representative for

The MAH performed a pooled data analysis from 4 clinical 
Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC and consequential 
update to section 4 of the PL to reflect the change of 
frequency of ADRs already included in the SmPC 
following an update of the clinical trial safety data 
pool. Stroke and myocardial infarction have also 
been included as new ADRs based on post-marketing 
spontaneous reporting; PL has been updated 
accordingly. Editorial changes have been made to 
section 4.2 of the SmPC.and paediatric statements 
have been included to sections 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 4.9 and 
5.1 of the SmPC as per previous commitments 
during variation IB/46. The PI is updated following 
the new QRD v.9.  Finally the MAH proposed to 
trials (2 trials in PID patients and one trial in patients with 
ITP, part of the original MAA, and the one trial in subjects 
with MMN, assessed in a previous variation) and post-
marketing spontaneous reports (including 2 reports of 
myocardial infarction and 2 of stroke) for a re-calculation of 
frequencies and frequency categories for a certain number 
of ADRs and to add Stroke and Myocardial Infarction in the 
Product Information (PI). As a result of the data analysis, 
frequencies and frequency categories have been changed 
for a few of the already reported ADRs in the PI, which was 
updated accordingly. Addition of stroke and myocardial 
infarction has been due to two reports of stroke and two 
reports of MI from post-marketing sources and the MAH 
has now incorporated them in the ADR list within frequency

C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications

It is clinically critical to distinguish true hyponatremia from 
a pseudohyponatremia that is associated with concomitant 
decreased calculated serum osmolality or elevated osmolar 
gap, because treatment aimed at decreasing serum free 
water in patients with pseudohyponatremia may lead to 
volume depletion, a further increase in serum viscosity and 
a possible predisposition to thromboembolic events.

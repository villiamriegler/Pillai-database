2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Roflumilast,  at  a  500  microgram  once-daily  dose,  is  authorised  in  the  EU  since  05-Jul-2010  for 
maintenance 
(FEV1 
post-bronchodilator  <  50%  predicted)  associated  with  chronic  bronchitis  in  adult  patients  with  a 
history of frequent exacerbations as add on to bronchodilator treatment. 
treatment  of  severe  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease 
(COPD) 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
COPD  is  the  fourth  leading  cause  of  death  in  Europe,  and  is  a  major  public  health  problem.  COPD  is 
generally but not exclusively associated with tobacco smoking. Tobacco smoke is considered the most 
important  risk  factor  for  COPD  worldwide.  Prevalence  and  morbidity  data  greatly  underestimate  the 
total  burden  of  COPD  because  the  disease  is  usually  not  diagnosed  until  it  is  clinically  apparent  and 
moderately advanced.  
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
COPD  comprises  pathological  changes  in  four  different  compartments  of  the  lungs  (central  airways, 
peripheral  airways,  lung  parenchyma,  pulmonary  vasculature),  which,  in  turn,  give  rise  to  the 
physiological abnormalities in COPD: mucous hypersecretion and cilliary dysfunction, airflow limitation 
and hyperinflation, gas exchange abnormalities, pulmonary hypertension, and systemic effects. 
Assessment report  
EMA/154975/2018  
Page 8/94 
 
 
 
 
 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The most widely accepted classification of the severity of COPD is according to The Global Initiative for 
Chronic  Obstructive  Lung  Disease  (GOLD)  (GOLD  2017   Global  Strategy  for  the  Diagnosis, 
Management and Prevention of COPD; Available from: http://goldcopd.org/gold-2017-global-strategy-
diagnosis-management-prevention-copd/). It includes a spirometric and symptoms classification.  
The GOLD classification of airflow limitation severity (spirometric classification) recognizes four grades 
(1: mild; 2: moderate; 3: severe; 4: very severe), being categories 3-4 those corresponding to severe 
(FEV1 ≤ 50% predicted) and very severe (FEV1 ≤ 30% predicted) airflow limitation, respectively.  
It should be noted that there is only a weak correlation between FEV1, symptoms and impairment of a 
patient’s health status. For this reason, formal symptomatic assessment is also required. 
Current  GOLD  guidelines  recommend  the  symptomatic  classification  of  COPD  patients  regarding 
symptoms  and  risk  of  exacerbations  using  the  “ABCD”  assessment  tool.  Group  D  are  patients  with 
more symptoms at high risk of exacerbations. 
The  prognosis  of  COPD  is  poorer  in  patients  with  severe/very  severe  airflow  limitation  and  it  is 
correlated with the degree of dyspnoea (GOLD 2017). 
2.1.5.  Management 
The  most  important  aspect  of  management  of  the  condition  is  educational  and  social:  the  avoidance 
and cessation of tobacco smoking. The medications for COPD currently available can reduce or abolish 
symptoms, increase exercise capacity, reduce the number and severity of exacerbations, and improve 
health  status.  At  present  no  treatment  is  shown  to  modify  the  rate  of  decline  in  lung  function. 
Combining different agents produces a greater change in spirometry and symptoms than single agents 
alone.  
Current GOLD guidelines recommend adding roflumilast to treatment regimens for patients in Group D 
who  have  chronic  bronchitis  and  forced  expiratory  volume  in  1 second  (FEV1)  <50%  of  predicted 
whose  exacerbations  are  not  adequately  controlled  on  a  triple  combination  of  a  long-acting  β 2-
adrenergic  agonist  (LABA),  a  long-acting  muscarinic  antagonist  (LAMA),  and  inhaled  corticosteroid 
(ICS). The indication for roflumilast in clinical practice is therefore for patients with GOLD spirometric 
grade 3-4 and group D. 
2.2.  About the product 
Roflumilast is a selective phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) inhibitor. PDE4 is an important regulator of 
cyclic AMP in most cell types involved in inflammatory processes. Inhibition of PDE4 reduces the 
breakdown of cAMP, which in turn down-regulates the inflammatory process.  
development 
2.3.  The 
guidance/scientific advice 
programme/compliance 
with 
CHMP 
No  formal  CHMP  scientific  advice  was  given.  However,  there  were  several  interactions  between  the 
Rapporteur and the MAH with respect to defining the design of the OPTIMIZE pivotal study for this line 
extension.  
With  the  proposed  OPTIMIZE  study  (RO-2455-302-RD),  the  marketing  authorization  holder  (MAH) 
intended  to  address  and  fulfill  follow-up  measure  004  “The  applicant  commits  to  present  a  program 
exploring the feasibility of developing alternative doses to minimize the risk of drug interactions, poor 
Assessment report

tolerability  and  the  influence  of  factors  such  as  gender,  age,  smoking  status  on  bioavailability  of  the 
product”.  
During  the  assessment  of  FUM004,  the  design  of  the  OPTIMIZE  study  was  discussed.  The  primary 
endpoint  of  “Percentage  of  subjects  prematurely  discontinuing  study  treatment  due  to  any  reason 
(during  main  period  i.e.,  Visit  V1  to  Vend)”  was  considered  adequate  to  investigate  if  patients  could 
benefit from an up-titration regimen. Initially proposed key secondary endpoints of the study were 
 “Percentage  of  subjects  with  adverse  events  of  interest  to  evaluate  tolerability  -  diarrhea,  nausea, 
headache, decreased appetite, insomnia and abdominal pain (main period, V1 to Vend)” and 
 “Percentage  of  subjects  prematurely  discontinuing  study  treatment  due  to  any  reason  (during  down-
titration period, V0DT to VendDT)”.  
In addition, change in forced vital capacity (FVC) and pre-bronchodilator FEV1 and change in subject-
assessed treatment satisfaction scores were proposed as secondary efficacy endpoints during the up- 
and down-titration period.  
Furthermore, also population PK and PK/PD analysis were proposed to be performed during the whole 
study  (up-  and  down-titration  period)  to  better  understand  the  relationship  between  PK  and  relevant 
safety (adverse events i.e., diarrhea, nausea, headache, decreased appetite, insomnia and abdominal 
pain) and efficacy (FEV1) parameters.  
While  accepting  that  the  primary  objective  of  the  OPTIMIZE  study  is  to  demonstrate  improved 
tolerability  of  250mcg  QD  roflumilast  compared  with  500mcg  QD  roflumilast,  it  was  also  considered 
important  that  the  study  was  also  designed  to  demonstrate  that  efficacy  is  maintained  at  the  lower 
dose.  Therefore,  FEV1  during  the  down  titration  was  proposed  by  the  rapporteur  as  key  secondary 
endpoint.  
In  this  regard,  the  use  of  the  hierarchical  testing  procedure  was  accepted.  However,  if  statistical 
significance was not achieved at a given stage, no inferential conclusions could be drawn from any of 
the  subsequent  analyses  at  the  lower  stages  of  the  hierarchy  even  if  they  were  carried  out  for 
exploratory purposes.  
A mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis was initially proposed by the MAH for the primary 
analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint, change from baseline FEV1. The Rapporteur did not endorse 
the proposal, as this method tends to overestimate treatment effects when a considerable amount of 
data is missing caused by premature discontinuation.  
Therefore,  analysis  of  covariance  (ANCOVA)  was  proposed  with  an  appropriate  model  including  the 
baseline value as a covariate. This method had to be carried out on the ITT population where missing 
data  had  to  be  imputed  using  a  suitable  and  justified  method.  Further  sensitivity  analyses  had  to  be 
conducted to demonstrate the robustness of the findings. 
As requested by the CHMP, the following changes were implemented in the protocol of the OPTIMIZE 
study : 
- Inclusion of FEV1 as key secondary endpoint during down-titration period. 
- Change from mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis to analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
for the primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint, change from baseline FEV1. 
It was planned to extend the existing PK/PD models in a two-step approach by using the data obtained 
from  the  REACT  study  (RO-2455-404-RD)  which  was  performed  to  address  follow-up  measures  001 
and 003, and the data obtained from the OPTIMIZE study.  
Depending  on  the  OPTIMIZE  study  outcome,  the  MAH  planned  to  seek  for  changes  of  the  posology 
section  of  the  SmPC  to  provide  recommendation  for  up-  and/or  down-titration  regimens  with 
roflumilast. 
2.4.  General comments on compliance with GMP, GLP, GCP  
GMP 
The  authorization  of  manufacturing  for  finished  product  manufacturer,  Takeda  GmbH  dated  15th 
February 2017, has been submitted, as well as the certificate of GMP compliance of the manufacturer, 
dated 14th February 2017, following an inspection carried out on 22nd June 2016.

A  valid  QP  Declaration  has  been  submitted,  updated  with  more  recent  audit  dates  for  Siegfried 
Evionnaz SA and Jetpharma SA, dated 6th September 2017. 
GCP 
Directive  2001/83/EC  (amended)  Article  8.3  (ib)  requires  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials 
carried out outside the European Union (EU) meet the ethical requirements of Directive 2001/20/EC. In 
the  pivotal  study  supporting  this  line  extension  application  (RO-2455-302-RD  OPTIMIZE  study), 
subjects  were  randomized  at  a  total  of  161  sites  in  15  countries:  Bulgaria  (11  sites),  Germany  (9), 
Greece  (5),  Hungary  (21),  Republic  of  Korea  (9),  Philippines  (4),  Poland  (15),  Romania  (19),  Russia 
(17), Slovakia (12), South Africa (14), Spain (2), Thailand (3), Ukraine (14), and United Kingdom (6). 
Takeda (sponsor of the clinical trial) and its representative, Quintiles, performed study RO-2455-302-
RD OPTIMIZE to the same ethical standard in all countries, both within and outside the EU. This ethical 
standard  is  consistent  with  the  ethical  requirements  of  Directive  2001/20/EC.  In  the  protocol, 
investigators  were  instructed  to  conduct  the  study  in  accordance  with  the  current  version  of  the 
Declaration  of  Helsinki,  and  the  International  Conference  on  Harmonization  (ICH),  harmonized 
tripartite guideline ICH E6 (R1): Good Clinical Practice, and any applicable local regulations.  
Takeda  procedures,  internal  quality  control  measures,  and  audit  programs  provide  reassurance  that 
the  clinical  study  program  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  Good  Clinical  Practice  (GCP),  as 
documented by the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH). AstraZeneca acquired the rights 
to the OPTIMIZE Study from Takeda following completion of the study. 
During  the  OPTIMIZE  study,  internal  audits  found  non-compliance  potentially  affecting  patient  safety 
and  study  data  integrity  at  a  single  site  (site  6002),  resulting  in  inspection  by  the  South  African 
Medicines  Control  Council  in  July  2015.  A  site  inspection  was  also  conducted  by  Authority  for  Health 
and  Consumer  Protection,  Free  and  Hanseatic  City  of  Hamburg,  Germany  in  October  2015,  with  no 
significant  finding  of  non-compliance.  In  addition,  data  from  OPTIMIZE  were  included  in  a  Medicines 
and  Healthcare  Products  Regulatory  Agency  inspection  of  records  for  several  studies  in  August  2015.  
Taking the above into account, the CHMP did not find sufficient reasons to trigger an inspection for this 
study.

microgram tablet by adding the new strength of 250 microgram roflumilast tablets. 
The application is submitted in accordance with article 8(3) in directive 2001/83/EC (i.e.: dossier with 
administrative, quality, pre-clinical and clinical data). 
The clinical part of this submission is based on clinical data from a single study (Study RO 2455 302-
RD  [OPTIMIZE])  together  with  updated  pop  PK  analyses  based  on  data  from  OPTIMIZE  and  REACT 
(Study  RO-2455-404-RD)  to  fulfill  a  Committee  for  Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use  (CHMP)  post-
authorization measure (FUM004). 
The  proposed  indication  is  for  the  250  micrograms  tablet  to  be  taken  once  daily  for  28  days  as  a 
starting  dose  intended  to  reduce  patient  discontinuation  when  initiating  therapy.  The  recommended 
maintenance dose is one tablet of 500 micrograms roflumilast to be taken once daily. 
This  line-extension  including  the  250  micrograms  roflumilast  tablet  translates  into  the  following 
changes in the SmPC pertaining to sections 4.2 and 5.1 (track changes).

2.6.  Quality aspects 
2.6.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as tablets containing 250 µg of roflumilast as active substance.  
Other ingredients are: lactose monohydrate, maize starch, povidone, and magnesium stearate. 
The product is available in PVC/PVDC aluminium blisters as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC 
2.6.2.  Active Substance 
The active substance used to manufacture the new strength: 250 µg film tablets is the same as that 
used in the manufacture of the currently authorised 500 µg film coated tablets  
2.6.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Daxas 250 μg tablets are uncoated tablets (immediate release). They are described as white to off-
white, round tablets embossed with “D” on one side and “250” on the other. The tablet’s diameter is 5 
mm. 
The finished product is currently available as film-coated 500 µg tablets. The applicant is applying for 
uncoated 250 µg tablets which will have a different composition to the 500 µg film coated tablets. The 
objective of the pharmaceutical development was to develop an immediate-release, white 250 µg 
tablet by employing standard manufacturing technologies, to enable a recommended starting 
roflumilast dosage. 
Roflumilast  is  a  white  to  off-white,  crystalline  powder;  it  is  a  very  stable  chemical  substance.  The 
active  substance  is  poorly  soluble  in  aqueous  solutions  between  pH  1  to  7.  Dissolution  of  the  active 
substance  from  the  dosage  form  depends  mainly  on  its  solubility  as  well  as  its  rate  of  dissolution. 
Therefore, the particle size of the active substance might affect rate and extent of dissolution. The use 
of micronized active substance was needed to provide an immediate release dissolution profile. 
Different excipients were investigated by preparing binary combinations containing the drug substance 
and the excipient and stored in different ambient conditions. Only those excipients with a proven 
compatibility with roflumilast were selected for development. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
Tablet formulations were varied in weight and size during drug development by varying the amount of 
excipients.  Several clinical studies and bioequivalence studies were performed during development.  
Finally, a small uncoated, white tablet was chosen for marketing authorisation. 
Since  the  absorption  of  the  drug  depends  mainly  on  its  release  from  the  tablet  and  on  dissolution 
under  physiological  conditions,  in-vitro  dissolution  may  be  relevant  to  the  prediction  of  in-vivo 
performance. In order to establish a suitable dissolution method, different factors have to be taken into 
account.  These  include  the  physicochemical  characteristics  of  the  drug  as  well  as  different  testing

conditions.  Importantly,  the  dissolution  method  was  able  to  discriminate  between  different,  bio-
inequivalent formulations, are consistent with the corresponding pharmacokinetic characteristics.  
In order to link the formulation of the finished product used in pivotal clinical trials to the original 
formulation intended for commercialisation, a bioequivalence study was performed showing 
bioequivalence. There was also no difference in the in-vitro dissolution profiles of the tablets used in 
pivotal clinical trials and Formula E film-coated tablets. 
Due to the low active substance content of the tablets, special focus was taken on blend and content 
uniformity  during  manufacturing  development,  scale-up  and  validation,  and  the  homogeneous 
distribution  of  the  active  substance  and  homogeneity  of  the  granules  was  determined  during  release 
testing  by  content  uniformity.  Therefore,  the  manufacturing  process  for  the  granules  was  adapted 
during scale-up to the commercial batch scale.  
The  primary  packaging  is  PVC/PVDC  aluminum  blisters.  The  material  complies  with  Ph.Eur.  and  EC 
requirements.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been  validated  by  stability  data  and  is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of 4 main steps: production of the granulation solution, production 
of  the  granulate,  production  of  the  tableting  mixture,  tableting  and  packaging.  The  process  is 
considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process. 
As  a  unit-dose  form  contains  less  than  2%  active  substance  by  weight  the  manufacturing  process  is 
considered  non-standard.  As  such,  normally,  the  granulation  should  be  considered  as  a  critical  step 
however  the  applicant  has  provided  process  validation  data  showing  that  all  batches  comply  with 
specifications  and  no  deviations  were  detected.  The  validation  data  provided supports  the  robustness 
of the manufacturing process and in process controls with regard to blend uniformity and assay of the 
tablet. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished 
product  of  intended  quality  in  a  reproducible  manner.  The  in-process  controls  are  adequate  for  this 
type of manufacturing. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
appearance  (visual),  dimension  (measuring  device),  water  content  (KF),  identity  (HPLC,  UV),  purity 
(HPLC), microbiological purity (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC or UV), content uniformity (Ph. Eur.), dissolution 
(Ph. Eur.) .

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 4 commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability  data  from  3  production  scale  batches  of  finished  product  stored  for  up  to  48  months  under 
long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 
75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Additionally, they were tested at 30 ºC / 75% 
RH for 48 months.  The batches of the medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing 
and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for the same specification as release. The analytical procedures used are stability 
indicating.  No  obvious  trends  were  detectable  and  the  results  were  well  within  the  proposed 
specification under long term and accelerated conditions. 
In addition, one batch (stored without primary packaging material) was exposed to light as defined in 
the  ICH  Guideline  on  Photostability  Testing  of  New  Drug  Substances  and  Products.  No  changes  were 
observed. Data confirmed that no additional storage recommendations regarding light protection were 
necessary. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 48 months without any special storage 
conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as 
those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the 
use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the 
Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal 
products. 
2.6.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.

2.6.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

The  Applicant  has  submitted  no  additional  nonclinical  data  supporting  a  lower  starting  dose.  No 
modification of the benefit risk profile of Roflumilast is expected. 
With  regards  to  the  Environmental  Risk  Assessment,  no  additional  studies  were  submitted.  The 
Applicant  estimates  that  no  increase  in  the  environmental  exposure  is  anticipated,  given  that  the

The only modification presented in this line extension is the substitution of the starting dose of 500mcg 
of Roflumilast for a lower one, i.e. 250 mcg. Given the positive risk benefit profile obtained in the initial 
assessment of the substance, no additional concerns are expected from a nonclinical point of view. 
The documentation and rationale for not conducting additional ERA studies is considerable acceptable.

2.8.  Clinical aspects 
2.8.1.  Introduction 
This line extension application is based on the study  RO-2455-302-RD (OPTIMIZE). This multicentre, 
randomized, double blind, Phase III study comprised an initial 4 week period in which patients received 
roflumilast 250 μg once daily (OD), 500 μg every other day (EOD), or the currently approved dosage 
of  500  μg  OD;  followed  by  8  weeks  of  dosing  at  500  μg  OD  for  all  subjects.  For  patients  unable  to 
tolerate  the  approved  maintenance  dose  of  roflumilast  500  μg  OD  during  the  Main  Period,  the  lower 
dosage of 250 μg OD was to be administered in a Down-titration Period. 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data were collected in both Main and Down-titration 
Periods  to  update  the  developed  population  PK  (pop-PK)  and  PK–PD  models,  and  specifically  to 
evaluate  exposures  in  patients  unable  to  tolerate  roflumilast  500  μg  OD  both  before  and  after 
transitioning  to  a  250  μg  OD  relative  to  exposures  in  patients  tolerating  the  approved  dosage. 
OPTIMIZE  was  performed  using  the  US  formulation  of  roflumilast  500  μg  and  250  μg  tablets. 
Evaluations  included  treatment  discontinuations  for  any  reason  as  a  primary  variable;  other  safety 
evaluations  included  AEs  of  interest  (preferred  terms  associated  with  Diarrhoea,  Nausea,  Headache, 
Decreased  appetite,  Insomnia,  Abdominal  pain,  Vomiting,  Angioedoema,  Anxiety,  Depression,  and 
Weight  loss),  GI  tolerability,  and  patient-assessed  outcomes.  Other  assessments  included  effects  on 
lung function, PK, and PK-PD relationships with AEs and lung function.

2.8.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
In  the  original  submission,  the  PK  profile  of  roflumilast  and  its  metabolite  were  assessed  using  PK 
samples taken across 21 Phase I studies, 1 Phase II study and 1 Phase III study.  
In  humans,  roflumilast  is  rapidly  metabolised  to  its  N-oxide  metabolite.  The  latter  exerts  PDE4 
inhibitory activity (approximately 3-fold lower potency compared with the parent compound) with 10-
fold higher area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), and a 3-fold higher free fraction in 
plasma.  The  N-oxide  metabolite  contributes  about  90%  of  the  overall  PDE4  inhibitory  activity  and  is 
assumed  to  contribute  largely  to  the  pharmacodynamics  (PD)  activity  of  roflumilast.  Thus,  during 
development, pharmacokinetic (PK) data were evaluated for both the parent compound and its N-oxide 
metabolite. 
Roflumilast  is  converted  to  roflumilast  N-oxide  by  cytochrome  P450  (CYP)  3A4  and  1A2  isoenzymes 
(von Richter et al 2007, Lahu et al 2008). CYP3A4 is primarily responsible for clearance of roflumilast 
N-oxide, with some contribution from CYP2C19 and extrahepatic CYP1A1. The activity of CYP3A4 and 
CYP1A2  can  be  affected  by  covariates  such  as  age  and  sex  (Bebia  et  al  2004,  Mangoni  and  Jackson 
2004, Cotreau et al 2005) and smoking (Funck-Brentano et al 2006), and these covariate effects have 
been demonstrated on the PK profile of roflumilast. 
To estimate the combined PDE4 inhibitory activities of roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide, the concept 
of “total PDE4 inhibitory activity” (tPDE4i) was established and additionally used to characterise the PK 
of  roflumilast  (Hermann  et  al  2007,  Lahu  and  Facius  2013).  The  tPDE4i  accounts  for  differences  in 
intrinsic PDE4 inhibitory activity, free concentration in plasma, and in vivo systemic exposures (AUC) of 
roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide. 
More  recently,  the  population  PK  model  was  updated  with  data  obtained  in  the  Phase  IIIb/IV  REACT 
study which tested the utility of adding roflumilast 500 μg once daily to a fixed dose combination (FDC) 
of long-acting β2-agonist (LABA)/inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). Now, the population PK model has been 
updated with data from OPTIMIZE. 
Total PDE4i was calculated according to the following equation: 
where fu,p/fu,m is the in vitro fraction unbound for parent/metabolite (fu,p=0.011, fu,m=0.034), IC50,p/IC50,m is 
the in vitro 50% inhibitory concentration for parent/metabolite (IC50,p=0.3 μg/L; IC50,m=0.8 μg/L), CLk
m is 
the individual apparent clearance for parent/metabolite (estimated by the population PK model), dose is the daily 
oral dose, and τ is the dosing interval (24 hours). 
p/CLk
The  population  PK  analyses  from  the  original  submission  described  the  PK  of  roflumilast  parent  and 
metabolite  in  2  independent  models.  In  the  population  PK  covariate  analyses,  race  had  the  greatest 
impact  on  tPDE4i,  and  females  were  estimated  to  have  higher  tPDE4i  than  males.  Smokers  were 
shown  to  have  a  lower  tPDE4i  than  non-smokers/former  smokers.  In  addition,  an  exposure-response 
relationship  was  identified  for  FEV1  from  exposure-response  analyses  using  data  from  4  Phase  II/III 
studies.  A  significant  exposure-response  relationship  was  identified  for  the  adverse  events  (AEs)  of 
diarrhoea, nausea and headache. 
The  new  information  is  generated  from  the  OPTIMIZE  study.  OPTIMIZE  had  the  following  PK-related 
objectives: 
• 
• 
• 
To characterize the PK of roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide with an up-titration regimen 
To characterize the PK of roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide with roflumilast 250 μg once daily 
in patients not tolerating the 500 μg once daily dose 
To characterize the PK/PD relation with respect to relevant safety and efficacy parameters 
In  OPTIMIZE,  the  PK  of  both  roflumilast  and  roflumilast  N-oxide  were  measured.  Bioanalytics  of 
roflumilast  and  roflumilast  N-oxide  were  performed  using  a  validated  high  performance  liquid

chromatography tandem mass spectrometer method. The lower limit of quantitation in plasma is 0.100 
microg/L using a sample volume of 0.2 mL. 
The OPTIMIZE population PK model 
The resulting integrated PK model is shown schematically in Figure 1. The base REACT model consisted 
of  two  distribution  compartments  with  first-order  absorption  and  elimination  for  the  parent  and  two 
additional distribution compartments with first order elimination for the metabolite. The absorption of 
the parent was described by a first-order process and a lag-time. 
In  the  absence  of  IV  data  for  both  roflumilast  and  the  N-oxide,  absolute  bioavailability  cannot  be 
estimated and therefore only apparent clearances and volumes can be used. This is the reason why in 
the model roflumilast is transformed completely into the N-oxide metabolite, although other metabolic 
routes  are  known  to  exist.  In  addition  to  systemic  formation  of  roflumilast  N-oxide,  pre-systemic 
formation  was  also  identified,  which  is  described  by  first  order  absorption  from  an  additional  dose 
compartment, with a separate fraction (F5). The bioavailability of the additional dose compartment for 
the N-oxide metabolite was estimated. 
This  parameter  describes the  contribution  of  pre-systemic  formation  relative  to  systemic  formation of 
roflumilast N-oxide. The bioavailability of roflumilast was fixed to 1 (F1).

of  metabolite;  KAp  absorption  rate  of  parent;  Qm  intercompartmental  clearance  of  metabolite;  Qp 
intercompartmental clearance of parent. 
The  base  REACT  model  was  applied  on  the  OPTIMIZE  data  and  the  effect  of  patients  versus  healthy 
volunteers  were  fixed  to  the  values  estimated  for  the  REACT  study.  The  base  REACT  population  PK 
model without covariates described individual plasma concentration data in OPTIMIZE well. Therefore, 
the model developed on combined REACT and OPTIMIZE data used the same structure while covariates 
were investigated anew. 
Systemic exposure to parent and metabolite were integrated in the tPDE4i, because this parameter is 
directly derived from model parameters. 
Both  roflumilast  parent  and  metabolite  total  plasma  concentrations  were  described  by  the  integrated 
population PK model with adequate precision. As compared to the final REACT model results obtained 
on  the  REACT  data  only,  similar  parameter  estimates  were  obtained  for  the  combined  dataset,  the 
percent change of parameters being overall below 21%. A larger difference (61%) was found between

the  estimates  of  the  Phase  II/III  effects  on  the  volume  of  the  central  compartment  for  the  N-oxide 
obtained on the REACT data only and on the combined dataset. 
The  OPTIMIZE  model  was  able  to  describe  the  between-subject  variability  (BSV)  across  treatment 
phases  (up-titration,  maintenance,  and  down-titration)  and  dose  regimens  (OD  or  EOD),  as  shown  in 
the  Visual  Predictive  Checks  (VPCs)  (Figure  2  and  Figure  3).  Time  axes  for  the  VPC  plots  were 
restricted to the period of time where the majority of observations was available (first 30 or 60 hours 
after dose, depending on the treatment arm).

Covariate Effects 
A  covariate  analysis  was  performed  on  the  combined  REACT  and  OPTIMIZE  dataset,  and  new 
covariates  of  age  and  sex  were  added  as  compared  to  the  final  REACT  model. Table  4  shows  patient 
counts and characteristics for the combined dataset, as well as for OPTIMIZE and REACT separately.

Table 2. Demographic and baseline characteristics for OPTIMIZE and REACT. 
The covariate ‘race’ was tested according to the covariate analysis, and each race category 
was included in the model as a binary relationship. However, in the single covariate addition 
procedure, race did not show a statistically significant result. 
The covariates included in the model according to the combined dataset showed that: 
• 
• 
The clearance of the N-oxide is 11.2% lower for females 
The clearance of roflumilast and its metabolite are lower for patients older than 60 years old. 
For  example,  a  70-year-old  patient is  characterized by  9%  and  8%  lower  clearance  of  parent 
and  metabolite,  respectively.  However,  10%  higher  clearances  were  estimated  for  a  50-year-
old patient with respect to the estimate obtained for the 60-year-old patient. 
•  Concerning the covariates already included in the final REACT model and re-estimated on the 
combined  dataset,  the  results  showed  that  clearance  of  parent  and  metabolite  were  15.1% 
higher for current smokers as compared to former smokers. 
•  Based on a reference value of weight of 70 kg, a patient weighing 80 kg is characterized by a 
3.7%  and  18%  higher  clearance  of  the  metabolite  and  all  volume  terms,  respectively.  Lower 
clearance of N-oxide (-4%) and volume (-17%) were found for a patient weighing 60 kg. 
These  differences  were  not  considered  to  be  clinically  relevant,  and  no  changes  to  the  current 
approved maintenance dose of roflumilast are warranted. 
For each covariate included in the final model for the combined dataset, the single covariate effect on 
the tPDE4i was assessed, assuming a 500 μg once daily treatment. 
This analysis showed that tPDE4i values decreased for increasing weight, ranging from 1.012 to 0.681 
corresponding to the minimum (i.e., 33.5 kg) and maximum (i.e., 160 kg) body weight, respectively.

The single effect of age on clearance of parent and metabolite provided tPDE4i values between 0.675 
and  1.055  corresponding  to  the  minimum  (40  years)  and  the  maximum  (92  years)  values  of  the 
covariate AGE.  
The smoking status affected both clearances and determined a lower tPDE4i value for current smoker 
(ie,  0.729)  as  compared  to  former/never  smoker  (ie,  0.839).  Females  were  characterized  by  higher 
tPDE4i values (ie, 0.937) as compared to males (ie, 0.839). 
Systemic exposure 
The  tPDE4i  was  calculated  for  1238  patients  with  quantifiable  PK  samples  in  the  OPTIMIZE  trial.  The 
individual  tPDE4i  was  estimated  for  each  treatment  phase  and  dose  regimen  administered  to  the 
patients. In the roflumilast 250 μg OD up-titration phase of the Main Period (treatment arm 3), tPDE4i 
values  were  found  to  be  approximately  half  of  the  values  estimated  for  patients  who  underwent  the 
500 μg continuous treatment (treatment arm 1).  
Similar  but  slightly  higher  tPDE4i  values  were  obtained  in  the  roflumilast  500  μg  EOD  up-titration 
phase  of  the  Main  Period  (treatment  arm  2)  as  compared  to  the  roflumilast  250  μg  OD  up-titration 
phase  (treatment  arm  3).  Although  similar  tPDE4i  values  were  estimated  in  the  up-titration  phase  of 
the  roflumilast  500  μg  EOD  and  roflumilast  250  μg  OD  treatment  arms,  higher  maximum  and  lower 
minimum concentrations are expected due to the dose regimen. 
Furthermore, estimated tPDE4i values were comparable for roflumilast 500 μg OD in the maintenance 
phase across all treatment arms. As compared to the Down-Titration Period, similar tPDE4i values were 
estimated in the roflumilast 500 μg EOD and roflumilast 250 μg OD up-titration treatment arms in the 
Main Period. 
Systemic exposure – Down-Titration 
For patients who did not tolerate roflumilast 500 μg OD and enrolled in the Down-Titration Period, the 
analysis showed that, when receiving 250 μg OD, patients have a tPDE4i exposure approximately half 
that  observed  in  patients  treated  with  500  μg  OD  (ie,  patients  who  tolerated  500  μg  OD  and  did  not 
down-titrate).  
However,  for  all  subgroup  pairs  with  sufficient  number  of  patients,  the  average  tPDE4i  in  ‘non-
tolerators’  is  slightly  higher  when  compared  with  ‘tolerators’  at  the  same  dose.  For  example,  when 
considering the subgroup of patients who dropped out due to any reason, the median tPDE4i after 500 
μg OD is 1.16 and 1.23 (+6%) in ‘tolerators’ and ‘non-tolerators’, respectively.  
Nevertheless,  comparing  ‘tolerators’  of  roflumilast  500  μg  OD  (median  tPDE4i  of  1.16  at  500  μg  OD) 
with  ‘non-tolerators’  of  roflumilast  500  μg  OD  (median  tPDE4i  of  0.60  at  250  μg  OD,  ie,  during  the 
Down-Titration Period), the latter have still a markedly lower tPDE4i systemic exposure (-48.3%).

Comparison of population PK results 
The  population  PK  analyses  from  the  original  submission  described  the  PK  of  roflumilast  parent  and 
metabolite in 2 independent models. 
The  current  OPTIMIZE  model  simultaneously  describes  parent  and  metabolite.  Benefits  of  this 
approach are that correlations, e.g., between the clearance of parent and metabolite are captured by 
the model, which should result in more reliable tPDE4i simulations. Also sparse data can be described 
with  more  certainty,  because  parent  and  metabolite  data  simultaneously  inform  all  individual  PK 
parameters. 
The  covariate  analysis  in  the  original  models  was  built  on  PK  data  collected  in  healthy  volunteers, 
whereas the covariate analysis of the current OPTIMIZE population PK model is based on patient data 
only. 
Comparison  of  covariate  findings  between  the  original  and  the  OPTIMIZE  population  PK 
model:  A  high  level  overview  of  the  original  covariate  findings  is  described  here.  In  the  original 
submission,  the  impact  of  individual  covariates  was  determined  as  relative  change  in  tPDE4i  values 
from a reference subject, which was defined as male, non-smoking, non-black/non-Hispanic,  healthy, 
aged  40-years  old.  In  OPTIMIZE,  the  reference  patient  was  a  male,  60-year  old,  former  smoker, 
baseline body weight of 70 kg. 
In the original analysis, of the single covariates, black (race) had the greatest impact on tPDE4i, with a 
42%  higher  mean  tPDE4i  than  non-black/non-Hispanic  patients.  Similarly,  but  to  a  lesser  extent, 
Hispanic  patients  were  estimated  to  have  a  28%  higher  mean  tPDE4i  than  non-black/non-Hispanic 
patients.  Female  patients were  estimated  to  have  a  19%  higher  mean  tPDE4i  than  male  patients.  To 
the  contrary,  smokers  were  estimated  to  have  a  19%  lower  mean  tPDE4i  than  non-smokers/former 
smokers. 
Using the population PK model with REACT and OPTIMIZE combined data, the assessment of the single 
covariate  effect,  assuming  the  500  μg  OD  treatment,  showed  that  tPDE4i  ranges  between  1.012  and 
0.681  according to  range of  body  weight  observed in  the  studied  population  (ie,  33.5 to  160  kg)  (no

effect of weight was seen in the original analysis). Race was not identified as a covariate (due to the 
low  numbers  of  black  patients).  As  in  the  original  analysis,  higher  tPDE4i  values  were  estimated  for 
females (+12% as compared to males) and lower tPDE4i values were obtained for current smokers (-
13%  as  compared  to  former/never  smokers).  For  the  age  range  between  40  and  92  years,  tPDE4i 
ranged between 0.675 and 1.055. 
2.8.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Roflumilast  is  a  PDE4  inhibitor,  a  non-steroid,  anti-inflammatory  active  substance  designed  to  target 
both the systemic and pulmonary inflammation associated with COPD. The mechanism of action is the 
inhibition  of  PDE4,  a  major  cyclic  adenosine  monophosphate  (cAMP)-metabolizing  enzyme  found  in 
structural and inflammatory cells important to the pathogenesis of COPD (Daxas SmPC).  
Roflumilast  targets  the  PDE4A,  4B  and  4D  splicing  variants  with  similar  potency  in  the  nanomolar 
range. The affinity to the PDE4C splicing variants is 5 to 10-fold lower. This mechanism of action and 
the  selectivity  also  apply  to  roflumilast  N-oxide,  which  is  the  major  active  metabolite  of  roflumilast 
(Daxas SmPC). 
PK-PD relationship 
Three types of analyses were performed to characterize the relationship of systemic exposure with  
a) post-BD FEV1 observations (PK/FEV1 models),  
b) the percentage of patients with at least one AE (PK/AE models), and  
c) the time to treatment discontinuation due to AEs (PK/TTE models). 
Methods  
a) PK/FEV1 dataset 
In  the  OPTIMIZE  study,  out  of  1238  patients  with  valid  PK  samples,  all  had  FEV1  measurements. 
Therefore,  all  1238  patients  were  also  included  in  the  PK/FEV1  analysis.  In  total,  the  OPTIMIZE 
PK/FEV1 dataset consists of 6093 FEV1 observations: 1991 observations from the 500 μg OD subset, 
2053 observations from the 500 μg EOB subset, and 2049 observations from the 250 μg OD subset. 
The  PK/FEV1  dataset  was  created  from  the  OPTIMIZE  data  with  minor  modifications;  post-
bronchodilator observations and FEV1 observations at screening were removed. 
Treatment phases and Visit numbers were assigned to allow differentiation between treatment phases 
(up-titration,  maintenance,  and  down-titration),  for  graphical  evaluation  and  modelling  purposes. 
Empirical  Bayesian  Estimates  of  PK  parameters  for  individual  patients  using  the  final  PK  model  were 
used  to  compute  tPDE4i  values  for  each  of  the  treatment  phases.  These  were  added  to  the  PK/FEV1 
dataset to be used as PK input. 
Additional  columns  were  added  to  identify  patients  in  potential  special  interest  categories,  such  as 
COPD severity, body weight, and age. In addition, new columns were created for the percentage of the 
study  period  during  which  there  was  concomitant  LABA/ICS  use  and  a  flag  to  indicate  concomitant 
LABA/ICS use at each observation. 
The PK/FEV1 model was developed using the following stepwise approach:  
1.  First,  the  previously  developed  base  and  final  REACT  models    were  applied  to  the  OPTIMIZE  data 
according  to  a  Bayesian  Feedback  procedure  (i.e.  MAXEVAL  =  0  in  the  NONMEM  code,  meaning  that 
estimation  is  not  performed  but  parameters  already  available  are  used  to  provide  predictions  for  the 
new OPTIMIZE dataset);  
2. Description of FEV1 was then optimized on the OPTIMIZE dataset using the REACT covariate model 
as a starting point.  
Due to the absence of placebo group data in the OPTIMIZE data, all disease progression and placebo-
related  fixed-effect  parameters  were  fixed  at  REACT  values.  Covariate  effect  parameters  on  BSL  and 
SLP4  were  re-estimated,  but  not  those  on  E0,  because  of  the  shorter  time  period  over  which  FEV1

observations were available. This is due to the different duration of the OPTIMIZE study as compared 
to the REACT one, being 12 weeks (plus 8 weeks if the patients started the down-titration period) and 
52 weeks, respectively.  
All  random  effect  parameters  (BSV  on  BSL  and  E0,  and  WSV)  were  re-estimated.  Differences  in  PK 
between  up-titration  dose  regimens  were  evaluated  by  estimating  separate  treatment  parameters 
(SLP4  and  ThalfP4)  for  500  μg  EOD  and  250  μg  OD  versus  500  μg  OD  dose  regimens;  3.  A  formal 
covariate  analysis  was  performed  on  BSL  (the  only  parameter  for  which  a  BSV  was  estimated  on 
OPTIMIZE  data).  A  forward  inclusion/backward  elimination  procedure  was  followed.  Forward  inclusion 
was done on top of the covariates already present in the REACT model. During backward elimination, 
all covariates were removed one-by-one (including those already present in the REACT model). 
b) PK/AE dataset 
There  were  1238  patients  in  the  PK/AE  dataset.  The  binary  response  variable  AE  was  set  to  ‘yes’  for 
patients with at least 1 AE with Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities preferred term (PT) in 'Any 
AE (all PTs)' during the Main Period of the study. Systemic exposure in the model was defined as the 
predicted tPDE4i with the 500 μg OD treatment. In total, 797 (64.4%) of patients reported at least 1 
AE.  Patient  counts  (and  percent)  for  each  arm  of  the  study  were:  257  (62.1%)  in  the  250  μg  OD 
treatment  arm,  269  (65.0%)  in  the  500  μg  EOD  treatment  arm,  271  (66.1%)  in  the  500  μg  OD 
treatment arm. 
To assess the incidence and timing of AEs of interest, a list of ‘AEs of interest’ was compiled consisting 
of 6 groups of related PTs: headache, diarrhoea, nausea, decreased appetite, insomnia, and abdominal 
pain.  For  the  analysis  that  explored  the  relationship  between  PK  and  AEs  of  interest,  an  additional  5 
groups  of  related  PTs  were  included  in  a  list  referred  to  as  ‘AEs  of  interest’  (extended  list)  to  ensure 
consistency with previous PK/AE analyses, consisting of 11 groups of related PTs: headache, diarrhoea, 
nausea,  abdominal  pain,  appetite  disorders,  sleep  disorders,  vomiting,  angioedema,  anxiety, 
depression,  weight  loss.  In  total,  633  (51.1%)  patients  reported  at  least  1  of  these  AEs.  The  ‘AEs  of 
interest’ category was used in the safety statistics analysis of OPTIMIZE and the ‘Any AE’ category was 
used for sensitivity analyses. 
c) PK/TTE dataset 
There were 1238 patients in the PK/TTE dataset. The PK/TTE analysis was based on all discontinuation 
events due to 'AEs of Interest (extended list)' during the Main Period from all patients. Any AE that led 
to discontinuation from the Main Period was recorded with event time defined as days after treatment 
start  until  last  Main  Period  study  medication  intake  (days  on  MP),  excluding  potential  later  study 
medication intakes during the Down-Titration Period. For each patient i and every AE group X, the time 
to  discontinuation  TTE_Xi  was  defined  as  “censored”  if  no  AE  in  group  X  lead  to  treatment 
discontinuation of patient i from the Main Period. In case patient i had an AE in group X which lead to 
discontinuation  from  the  Main  Period,  TTE_Xi  was  set  to  the  number  of  days  that  the  patient  was 
treated during the Main Period. 
For each subject, the tPDE4i predicted for the treatment phase at which this patient discontinued was 
chosen  as  systemic  exposure  variable.  If  discontinuation  happened  during  up-titration  phase  of  the 
Main  Period,  tPDE4i  predicted  for  the  respective  up-titration  treatment  was  used  (tPDE4i_250OD, 
tPDE4i_500EOD, or tPDE4i_500OD), if discontinuation happened during the maintenance phase of the 
Main  Period,  tPDE4i_500OD  was  used.  In  case  a  patient  either  completed  the  Main  Period  or 
discontinued  due  to  another  reason,  the  respective  tPDE4i  predicted  for  the  last  day  of  the  patient’s 
Main Period was used. 
Results 
a) Exposure-response model for FEV1 
The previous exposure-response model for FEV1 was developed based on data from the REACT study, 
and described the relative change from baseline in FEV1, as a function of roflumilast systemic exposure 
expressed as tPDE4i. The REACT model has now been applied to PK and FEV1 data from the OPTIMIZE 
study to further characterize the exposure FEV1 response of roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide. 
The final OPTIMIZE model 
The final OPTIMIZE FEV1 model contains the following covariate effects:

•  COPD  status,  concomitant  long  acting  muscarinic  antagonist  (LAMA)  use,  percent  reversibility 
(for short-acting bronchodilators), age, weight, sex and race on baseline FEV1 
•  Weight on placebo effect 
•  Smoking status on treatment effect slope. 
All parameters could be estimated with good precision (CV<50%). The final model described OPTIMIZE 
data well (Figure 4).

Source: see Module 5.3.4.2, PK and PK/PD analysis of exposure and efficacy report (OPTIMIZE), Figure 8. 
The  observed  FEV1  changes  in  the  OPTIMIZE  study  are  well  described  by  the  FEV1  model  developed 
for  the  REACT  study  in  the  treatment  phases  (up-titration,  maintenance,  and  down-titration)  and 
across  the  different  treatment  arms.  Model  simulations  showed  that  change  of  FEV1  from  baseline  is 
lower  at  the  end  of  the  4-week  up-titration  treatment  phase  with  roflumilast  250  μg  OD  than 
roflumilast 500 μg OD (Figure 4, [c]), and is predicted to decrease after down-titration from roflumilast 
500 μg OD to roflumilast 250 μg OD (Figure 4, [d]). 
Covariate Effects:  
To evaluate the influence of covariates in the PD model, FEV1 and FEV1 change from baseline (ΔFEV1) 
estimates  for  a  500  μg  OD  dose  regimen  at  steady  state,  after  4  weeks  and  after  12  weeks  of 
treatment, were calculated assuming a typical tPDE4i value, accounting for patient covariates. 
Covariates weight, COPD severity, and percent reversibility for short-acting bronchodilators resulted in 
the largest change in FEV1 at baseline parameter, followed by the effect of age, sex, race and the use 
of  LAMA  at  baseline,  while  smoking  affected  the  proportionality  coefficient  for roflumilast tPDE4i.  The 
range of predicted FEV1 change from baseline at week 4 and week 12 (resulting from covariates in the 
PK/FEV1 model) was largest for weight and smoking.  
For  example, ΔFEV1  after 12  weeks  ranged  from  32.0  to  157  mL  for  a  33.5  to  160  kg  weight  range, 
and  was  dependent  on  smoking  status  (96.5  versus  56.0  mL  for  current  versus  former/never 
smokers). 
b) Results of the PK/AE analysis 
b1. AEs of interest 
The final model quantifies a significant increase in the percentage of subjects with AEs of Interest with 
increased exposure (see Figure 5). The plot show the mean model response (thick line) together with a 
shaded ribbon indicating the 95% confidence intervals around the mean response. The erratic thin line 
represents the local fit (local fit is a locally averaged percentage of subjects with adverse events and

it’s  variability  is  not  directly  related  to  the  shaded  95%  CIs,  i.e.  it  is  not  expected  to  have 
approximately 95% of the local fits within the shaded area, as it would be with standard VPC plots). 
Figure 5. Model response from the logistic regression model for the percentage of 
subjects with AEs of Interest (extended list) as a function of tPDE4i (500μg OD). 
In  addition  covariates  LAMAC  and  SMOK  indicated  that  percentages  of  subjects  with  AEs  of  Interest 
were 
•  Higher in subjects concomitantly treated with LAMAs when compared with subjects not taking 
LAMAs. 
•  Higher in former smokers when compared with current smokers. 
Total  PDE4i  was  a  significant  predictor  of the  percentage  of patients  with  AEs  in  7  out  of  9  tested  PT 
groups.  Logistic  regression  analysis  indicates  that  the  percentage  of  patients  with  AEs  of  interest 
(extended  list),  Any  AE  (all  PTs),  diarrhoea,  appetite  disorders,  insomnia,  nausea,  and  weight  loss, 
according to the model, depends on tPDE4i. The percentage of patients with headache and abdominal 
pain  was  not  found  to  depend  on  tPDE4i,  according  to  the  model.  Smoking  habit  was  a  significant 
predictor in 5 models.  
In  addition,  covariates  Asian  and  concomitant  use  of  LAMA  or  LABA/ICS  were  significant  for  one  PT 
group each (RO-2455-302-RD: Expert Report to Characterize PK/AE).  
Moreover,  variable  treatment  arm  (250  μg  OD/500  μg  EOD)  was  not  found  as  a  covariate  in  any 
model, ie, the percentages of patients with AEs are not affected by treatment arm but were sufficiently 
characterized by tPDE4i as a descriptor of systemic exposure.  
Simulations of the PK/AE models were performed to assess the probability of a patient to develop AEs 
in  dependence  of  their  characteristics  and  roflumilast  systemic  exposure.  Relative  risks  over  placebo 
were  derived  from  these  simulations.  Placebo  effects  were  predicted  since  there  was  no  placebo  arm 
included in OPTIMIZE. 
Among  all  simulated  scenarios  for  the  “AEs  of  interest  (extended  list)”,  the  median  predicted  RR  (to 
placebo)  for  a  reference  patient  (male,  age  64  years,  former  smoker,  body  weight  74  kg,  and 
concomitant treatment with LAMA) when treated with 500 μg OD is1.31 with a 90% prediction interval 
of [0.43, 4.67].  
The lowest average RR of 1.27 [0.41, 4.56] was predicted for young patients (age=51 years) and the 
highest average RR of 1.38 [0.38, 5.66] was predicted for patients concomitantly treated with LAMAs. 
Relative differences of both extremes when compared with the reference were -3% and +5% and not 
considered clinically relevant.

Table 4. Simulated tPDE4i, percentages of subjects with AEs of Interest (extended 
list), and relative risk to placebo in subgroups defined by PK and PD covariates for 
typical subjects. 
b.2 Any AE: 
For any AE, the logit of probability depended on tPDE4i and race (Asian versus non-Asian). As with AEs 
of interest, LAMA use and smoking were also found to be covariates. In addition, covariates of the PK 
model  result  in  different  tPDE4i  levels  and  hence  translate  into  differences  in  RR  when  comparing 
simulations stratified by these variables. Nevertheless, these differences are small in all cases and do 
not indicate clinically relevant differences across all investigated subgroups. 
For “Any AEs”, the predicted RR (to placebo) for a reference patient when treated with 500 μg OD is 
1.31  [0.48,  4.43].  The  lowest  and  highest  predicted  RRs  in  all  scenarios  were  1.15  [0.65,  2.64]  for 
Asian patients and 1.34 [0.51, 4.52] for patients with a body weight of 48 kg. This corresponds to a -
12%  and  +2%  difference  from  the  reference.  Numerically  the  same  highest  RRs  were  also  predicted 
for females and patients aged 77 years. The high variability in AEs translated into the prediction of RRs 
causing  largely  overlapping  prediction  intervals  in  all  cases  that  included  1  (no  effect).  Given  this 
variability, RRs were very similar among all simulated scenarios.

c) Results of the PK/TTE analysis 
Time-to-event  models  with  a  log-normal  hazard  adequately  described  discontinuation  times  from  the 
Main Period (up-titration and maintenance phases) and from the up-titration phase of the Main Period 
only due to AEs of interest (extended list) and due to Any AEs. 
The  variable  ‘treatment  arm  250  μg  OD’  was  a  significant  covariate  in  all  models,  indicating  that 
patients treated with roflumilast 250 μg OD for 4 weeks before increasing the dose to roflumilast 500 
μg  OD  had  significantly  lower  discontinuation  rates  due  to  AEs  of  interest  (extended  list)  and  due  to 
Any  AEs  during  the  Main  Period  compared  to  patients  in  the  500  μg  EOD  or  500  μg  OD  treatment 
arms. 
In  addition,  variables  Asian,  sex,  and  age  were  found  as  significant  covariates  when  characterizing 
discontinuation events during the Main Period; discontinuation rates due to AEs were higher for Asians, 
females, and with increasing age. However, when characterizing discontinuation events during the up-
titration phase of the Main Period only, only body weight was found beside ‘treatment arm 250 μg OD’ 
as a covariate; early treatment discontinuation due to AEs in OPTIMIZE (within the up-titration phase) 
was found to be co-dependent on other patient characteristics rather than late discontinuation events. 
Despite up-titration with 250 μg OD, systemic exposure (as characterized by tPDE4i) was not found to 
significantly affect discontinuation rates. 
Discussion about the PK-response models: 
a) Comparison of findings between the original and OPTIMIZE PK/FEV1 analyses:  
The  originally  developed exposure-response  models for  FEV1  were  based  on  data  from  4  Phase  II/III 
studies testing roflumilast compared with placebo without PK sampling. These models were developed 
as  dose/response  models  and  then  extended  using  simulated  typical  systemic  exposure  as  a  PK 
variable.  In  contrast,  the  OPTIMIZE  PK/FEV1  analyses  is  an  individual  exposure  response  model 
describing  the  change  in  FEV1  over  time  as  a  function  of  tPDE4i  and  therefore  cannot  be  directly 
compared  with  the  original  model.  In  addition,  there  were  differences  in  treatment  duration  and 
background therapy between OPTIMIZE and the originally reported studies. 
b) Comparison of findings between the original and OPTIMIZE PK/AE analyses:  
In  the  PK/AE  analyses  in  the  original  submission,  a  significant  exposure-response  relationship  was 
identified  for  diarrhoea,  nausea,  and  headache.  In  OPTIMIZE  PK/AE  analyses,  systemic  exposure,  as 
measured  by  tPDE4i,  was  a  significant  predictor  of  the  percentage  of  patients  with  AEs  in  7  out  of  9

tested  PT  groups;  AEs  of  interest  (extended  list),  Any  AE  (all  PTs),  diarrhoea,  appetite  disorders, 
insomnia, nausea, and weight loss depends on tPDE4i. The percentages of patients with headache and 
abdominal pain were not found to depend on tPDE4i. 
However,  the  originally  reported  and  OPTIMIZE  PK/AE  models  cannot  be  directly  compared  in  detail 
due to the difference in the dosing regimen compared to that currently approved for roflumilast. 
2.8.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
This  application  is  based  on  the  study  RO-2455-302-RD  (OPTIMIZE),  ‘a  multicenter,  randomized, 
double-blind,  Phase  3  study  to  evaluate  tolerability  and  pharmacokinetics  of  500  μg  roflumilast  once 
daily  with  an  up-titration  regimen  in  COPD,  including  an  open-label  Down-Titration  Period  evaluating 
tolerability and PK of 250 μg roflumilast once daily in patients not tolerating 500 μg roflumilast once-
daily’.  
The OPTIMIZE population pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses used OPTIMIZE data combined with PK data 
from  the  REACT  study  (Study  RO  2455-404-RD).  Parameters  of  the  final  population  PK  model  were 
estimated with good precision (coefficient of variation of the estimates less than 25%) and estimates 
were  consistent  with  previous  findings.  The  model  was  able  to  adequately  describe  average  PK 
concentrations  as  well  as the  BSV  across  all  treatment  phases  (up-titration,  maintenance,  and  down-
titration) and dosing schemes. 
Reducing the dose of roflumilast to 250 μg OD in patients who did not tolerate roflumilast 500 μg OD 
markedly  reduced  tPDE4i  to  below  those  typically  observed  in  patients  who  tolerated  500  μg  OD. 
Therefore,  administration of  roflumilast 250  μg  OD may  not  induce  sufficient  PDE4  inhibition  to exert 
clinical efficacy. 
Although  the  applicant  states  that  dose  adjustment  for  patient  covariates  (such  as  gender,  age  and 
smoking status) is not warranted, it does not prevent from updating section 5.2 of the SmPC.  
In addition, the need for dose adjustment should be further discussed for some special populations.  
The Applicant has submitted the requested pre-study validation report ACTC2 including two addendum 
(Analyte Stability in Frozen Matrix Sodium Heparin and Stability of Standards in Solution). 
In  general,  the  pre-study  or  method  validation  of  the  bioanalytical  method  was  consistent  and 
demonstrated  an  adequate  linearity,  precision  and  accuracy  (both  intra-  and  inter-day)  within  the 
calibrated  range,  which  showed  also  an  adequate  selectivity,  absence  of  significant  carry-over  and 
matrix  effect  and  adequate  dilution  linearity.  In  addition,  the  analyte  long-term  stability  was 
demonstrated for 716 days at -20 ºC and -70 ºC. 
New PK data generated from OPTIMIZE in almost 19.000 samples from 1238 COPD patients are robust 
and may be of interest for prescribers. In this respect, section 5.2 of the SmPC must be updated with 
respect  to:  a)  PK  data  of  the  250  microgram  dose.  It  should  be  stated  that  these  levels  are  sub-
therapeutic  and  therefore  not  recommended  for  maintenance  treatment,  with  cross  reference  to 
section 5.1 and 4.2;  
b) The influence of intrinsic/extrinsic factors on PDE4 inhibitory activity (i.e.: age, weight, race, gender 
and smoking status) (subsection of special populations).  
Upon  request,  adiscussion  about  potential  need  for  dose  adjustments  was  provided    (e.g.:  whether 
obese patients may require maintenance doses > 500 micrograms or if Asian patients and/or patients 
with low body weight may require maintenance doses < 500 micrograms.  
The company provided a new population PK model on the combined REACT and OPTIMIZE dataset and 
identified no clinically relevant changes of systemic exposure levels in populations of particular interest 
(eg,  elderly  patients,  female  patients,  or  patients  with  high  [>80 kg]  or  low  [<60 kg]  baseline  body 
weight).   
With  respect  to  race,  Asian  patients  tend  to  have  a  lower  body  weight  than  patients  from  Western 
countries.    Asian  race  was  not  a  significant  covariate  in  population  PK  analysis,  whereas  in  subgroup 
analyses of pivotal studies (Study M2-124 and Study M2-125), the effect of roflumilast versus placebo 
on  the  rate  of  moderate  or  severe  exacerbations  showed  no  heterogeneity  depending  on  race.  
Therefore,  is  was  concluded  that  the  approved  maintenance  dose  of  roflumilast  500 μg  OD  does  not 
need to be adjusted in these populations.

The mechanism of action, primary and secondary pharmacology of roflumilast are well established and 
were already assessed in the roflumilast 500 microg MAA. The new line extension application is based 
on  a  single  pivotal  study  (OPTIMIZE  study)  that  included  combined  PK,  PD,  efficacy  and  safety  data. 
Only the new PD data pertaining to the OPTIMIZE PK-PD model have been described and assessed in 
this section. 
Three  types  of  analyses  were  performed  to  characterize  the  relationship  of  systemic  exposure  of  3 
roflumilast  starting  regimes  (250  microg  OD  or  500  microg  EOD  for  4  weeks  followed  by  500  for  8 
additional weeks versus standard regime of roflumilast 500 microg OD for 12 weeks) with  
a)  post-BD  FEV1  observations  (PK/FEV1  models);  b)  the  percentage  of  patients  with  at  least  one  AE 
(PK/AE models), and c) the time to treatment discontinuation due to AEs (PK/TTE models). 
The  population  PK/FEV1  model  predicted  a  reduced  improvement  in  FEV1  at  roflumilast  250  μg  OD 
compared to roflumilast 500 μg OD during the 4-week up-titration phase of the Main Period. The model 
also predicted a decrease of FEV1 change from baseline in subjects down-titrating from 500 μg OD to 
250 μg OD in the Down-Titration Period. In accordance with reducing the dose of roflumilast to 250 μg 
once daily in patients who did not tolerate roflumilast 500 μg once daily, total PDE4 inhibition (tPDE4i) 
was  markedly  reduced  by  approximately  50%  to  below  that  typically  observed  in  patients  who 
tolerated  500  μg  once daily,  and  this  led  to  a  smaller  change  in  forced  expiratory  volume  in  the  first 
second  (FEV1)  from  baseline.  Therefore,  administration  of  roflumilast  250  μg  once  daily  may  not 
induce  sufficient  phosphodiesterase  4  (PDE4)  inhibition  to  exert  clinical  efficacy.  This  is  further 
discussed in the efficacy section. 
PK/PD models of incidence of adverse events (AEs) and time-to event models for discontinuation from 
the  study  were  also  developed.  Covariate  analyses  using  these  models  found  weighted  plasma 
exposure of roflumilast and its metabolite to be a significant predictor of AE incidence, and dose in the 
up-titration phase to be a significant predictor of discontinuations. The models were based on average 
concentrations and were unable to explain the differences in discontinuation rates between the two up-
titration  regimes  (250  microg  OD  vs.  500  microg  EOD),  despite  average  concentrations  were  similar. 
Other  PK  characteristics  (e.g.  Cmax)  might  be  required  in  addition  to  characterize  the  PK/safety 
relationship. The sparse data used to build the population PK model did not allow a robust prediction of 
Cmax.  and therefore cannot analyze a potential relationship between Cmax and discontinuation rates. It 
was  concluded  that,  even  if  further  analyses  of  PK/safety  data  based  on  Cmax  were  possible,  these 
would not change the position regarding the benefit of introducing a starting dose of roflumilast 250 μg 
OD. 
On  the  other  hand,  time  to  event  models  attempt  to  characterize  the  (discontinuation)  time 
(dependent variable) as a function of so called predictor or independent variables.  
These data provided supporting evidence that starting roflumilast treatment with 250 μg once daily for 
4  weeks  followed  by  up-titration  to  the  500  μg  once  daily  dose  results  in  lower  discontinuation  rates 
and AEs of interest, compared to starting with roflumilast 500 μg once daily. This is applicable for the 
12 week study period. No assumptions can be made beyond this period. 
 Nevertheless,  in  previous  roflumilast  clinical  trials,  Kaplan-Meier  plots  of  time  to  onset  of  AEs  show 
that the majority of events in the roflumilast treated-patients occur early, and that there is a plateau 
after 4 weeks. Therefore, the first 4 weeks of treatment represents the dosing period most relevant to 
the  aims  of  the  study  (ie,  to  improve  tolerability  of  roflumilast  through  use  of  alternative  dosing 
regimens).    After  this  time,  there  is  no  evidence  to  support  a  need  for  further  improvements,  as  the 
frequency  of  AEs  with  roflumilast  is  not  higher  than  with  placebo,  and  the  rate  of  withdrawals  from 
study treatment are low. 
2.8.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
New  PK  data  generated  from  OPTIMIZE  in  almost  19.000  samples  from  1238  COPD  patients  are 
robust.  Results  from  the  new  population  PK  model  on  the  combined  REACT  and  OPTIMIZE  dataset 
identified no clinically relevant changes of systemic exposure levels in populations of particular interest 
(eg,  elderly  patients,  female  patients,  or  patients  with  high  [>80 kg]  or  low  [<60 kg]  baseline  body 
weight).    With  respect  to  race,  Asian  patients  tend  to  have  a  lower  body  weight  than  patients  from 
Western  countries.    Asian  race  was  not  a  significant  covariate  in  population  PK  analysis,  whereas  in 
subgroup  analyses  of  pivotal  studies  (Study M2-124  and  Study  M2-125),  the  effect  of  roflumilast 
versus  placebo  on  the  rate  of  moderate  or  severe  exacerbations  showed  no  heterogeneity  depending

on  race.    Therefore,  the  approved  maintenance  dose  of  roflumilast  500 μg  OD  does  not  need  to  be 
adjusted in these populations. 
With  respect  to  PK-PD  relationship,  three  types  of  analyses  were  performed  to  characterize  the 
relationship of systemic exposure of 3 roflumilast starting regimes (250 microg OD or 500 microg EOD 
for  4  weeks  followed  by  500  for  8  additional  weeks  versus  standard  regime  of  roflumilast  500 
micrograms  OD  for  12  weeks)  with:  a)  post-BD  FEV1  observations  (PK/FEV1  models);  b)  the 
percentage  of  patients  with  at  least  one  AE  (PK/AE  models),  and  c)  the  time  to  treatment 
discontinuation due to AEs (PK/TTE models). 
Results  from  the  new  population  PK  model  and  PK-PD  model  of  pre-BD  FEV1  also  indicates  that  250 
micrograms  roflumilast  is  associated  to  sub-therapeutic  levels  and  therefore  should  not  be  used  for 
maintenance treatment. The SmPC has been ammended accordingly in secctions 4.2 and 5.1 to warn 
against the use of the 250 microgram dose as maintenance dose. The applicant has been requested to 
discuss about what are considered therapeutic and subtherapeutic levels (e.g. levels of PDE4 inhibitory 
activity)  and  make  a  revised  proposal  to  include  these  levels  in  the  SmPC  for  the  250  microg 
(subtherapeutic) and 500 microg (therapeutic) (see LoI). 
PK/PD models of incidence of adverse events (AEs) and time-to event models for discontinuation from 
the study were also developed. The models were based on average concentrations. Covariate analyses 
using  these  models  found  weighted  plasma  exposure  of  roflumilast  and  its  metabolite  to  be  a 
significant predictor of AE incidence, and dose in the up-titration phase to be a significant predictor of 
discontinuations.  
2.9.  Clinical efficacy 
2.9.1.  Dose-response studies and main clinical studies 
This submission is based on data from a single study (Study RO 2455 302-RD [OPTIMIZE]) conducted 
to  fulfil  a  Committee  for  Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use  (CHMP)  post-authorization  measure 
(FUM004)  to  explore  alternative  doses  of  roflumilast  to  minimise  the  risk  of  drug  interactions,  poor 
tolerability, and the influence of factors such as gender, age, and smoking status on the bioavailability 
of the product in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  
The  single  pivotal  OPTIMIZE  study  was  a  multicenter,  randomized,  double-blind,  Phase  III  study  that 
comprised  a  12-week  Main  Period,  including  an  initial  4-week  up-titration  regimen  to  assess  if 
alternative dosing strategies (roflumilast 250 μg once daily or 500 μg every other day) could minimise 
the risk of poor tolerability of the approved dose of 500 μg once daily (primary safety objective). 
 The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients prematurely discontinuing study treatment due 
to  any  reason  during  the  Main  Period  (see  Module  2.7.4).  The  study  also  included  an  8-week  Down-
Titration Period in patients not tolerating the approved dose of roflumilast 500 μg once daily during the 
Main Period, to assess if a lower maintenance dose of 250 μg once daily could be proposed to minimise 
the risk of poor tolerability (secondary safety objective).

Methods 
OPTIMIZE was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 3-arm, parallel group, phase 3 study with an 
open-label Down-Titration Period for subjects who withdrew from the Main Period of the study. During 
the  Main  Period,  subjects  were  randomized  receive  1  of  the  3  treatments  consisting  of  2  up-titration 
treatment groups: 250 μg OD or 500 μg EOD for the first 4 weeks followed by 500 μg OD for 8 weeks, 
and the currently approved roflumilast regimen of 500 μg OD administered for 12 weeks.  
During the Main Period, the first 4 weeks (up-titration) was double-blinded, and the following 8 weeks 
(maintenance  period)  was  single-blinded.  All  subjects  discontinuing  from  the  Main  Period  were 
permitted to enter an 8-week open-label Down-Titration Period where they received roflumilast 250 μg 
OD. 
Spirometry  and  subject-assessed  treatment  satisfaction  for  efficacy  assessments  were  performed  at 
Screening (V0, Days -21 to -7), Randomization (V1, Day 1), and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 (Visits V2, 
V3, V4, and Vend) of the Main Period, and at Baseline (V0DT=Vend of Main Period) and at Weeks 2, 4 
and 8 (Visits V1DT, V2DT and VendDT) of the Down-Titration Period. Six milliliter blood samples for PK 
analysis were drawn at Visits V2, V4, Vend/V0DT, V1DT, V2DT and VendDT.

Primary: 
•  To  evaluate  discontinuation  rates  of  roflumilast  500  μg  once  daily  (OD)  using  an  up-titration 
regimen with either 250 μg OD or 500 μg every other day (EOD) for the first 4 weeks of treatment 
followed by 500 μg OD for 8 weeks compared with continuous treatment of 500 μg OD during the 
entire 12-week Main Period.

Down-Titration Period (V0DT to VendDT). 
Other secondary endpoints were: 
•  Change  in  prebronchodilator  FEV1  from  V1  to  V2,  V3,  V4,  and  Vend  (during  Main  Period  of  the 
study) and also from V1 to VendDT (including Down-Titration Period). 
•  Change  in  prebronchodilator  FVC  from  V1  to  V2,  V3,  V4,  and  Vend  (during  Main  Period  of  the 
study) and also from V0DT to VendDT and V1 to VendDT (including Down-Titration Period). 
• 
•  Change in subject-assessed treatment satisfaction scores from V1 to V2, V3, V4, and Vend (during 
Main  Period  of  the  study)  and  also  from  V0DT  to  VendDT  and  V1  to  VendDT  (including  Down-
Titration Period).

metabolite)  and  total  phosphodiesterase  4  (PDE4)  inhibitory  activity  (tPDE4i)  of  both  active 
moieties including covariate effects on these parameters (where ‘tPDE4i’ activity includes the PDE 
inhibitory activity of roflumilast itself as well as roflumilast N-oxide). 
•  Relationship  between  PK  and  relevant  safety  (AEs  of  interest  [extended  list]  to  evaluate 
tolerability,  ie,  diarrhea,  nausea,  headache,  decreased  appetite,  insomnia,  abdominal  pain, 
vomiting, angioedema, anxiety,and weight loss) and efficacy (FEV1) parameters. 
Safety: 
•  Safety  was  assessed  by  evaluation  of  AEs,  changes  in  laboratory  values,  vital  signs,  physical 
examination  findings,  body  weight  and  body  mass  index  (BMI),  as  well  as  changes  on  the 
Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). 
• 
Sample size 
The sample size for the Main Period was based on the primary endpoint of the percentage of subjects 
discontinuing study treatment due to any reason, during the Main Period of the study, up to Week 12. 
Discontinuation rates for the sample size calculation were estimated from data of the roflumilast COPD 
pivotal  studies  pool  (M2-124  and  M2-125),  which  included  a  very  similar  subject  population  as  the 
OPTIMIZE study. The discontinuation rates after the initial 12 weeks of treatment were used to reflect 
the  treatment  duration  of  the  OPTIMIZE  study  (total  treatment  duration  of  the  pivotal  studies  was  1 
year).  
With these assumptions, Kaplan-Meier estimates revealed discontinuation rates of 20% with roflumilast 
and 13% with placebo. 
Based on these data, a total of 441 subjects per treatment arm, 1323 overall, will provide 80% power 
to declare superiority of each of: 
•  Roflumilast 250 μg OD/500 μg OD vs. reference. 
•  Roflumilast 500 μg EOD/500 μg OD vs. reference. 
Where  the  reference  is  defined  as  roflumilast  500  μg  OD  for  12  weeks.  It  refers  to  a  2-group  chi-
square  test of  equal  proportions  (OR  =1),  assuming  discontinuation  rates  of 13% on  each  of  the  up-
titration arms and 20% on the reference arm, and a 2-sided significance level of 5.0% using a closed 
testing  procedure  with  hierarchical  evaluation  (roflumilast  250  μg  OD/500  μg  OD  being  tested  first 
followed by roflumilast 500 μg EOD/500 μg OD). 
The expected sample size for the Down-Titration Period was based on the above assumption that 13% 
to  20%  of  subjects  prematurely  discontinue  roflumilast  treatment.  Including  about  1323  subjects  in 
the  Main  Period  will  thus  lead  to  approximately  150  subjects  in  the  Down-Titration  Period  assuming 
that  75%  of  subjects  who  discontinue  from  the  Main  Period  will  continue  into  the  Down-Titration 
Period.

Randomisation 
In  this  study,  a  1:1:1  randomization  was  employed.  Eligible  subjects  were  randomized  by  means  of 
interactive  voice  response  system/interactive  web  response  system  (IVRS/IWRS).  At  each  dispensing 
visit, the system assigned an appropriate investigational medicinal product (IMP) kit(s) from the stock 
available at the study center for each subject.  
• 
Blinding (masking) 
The  first  4  weeks  of  the  main  treatment  period  was  double-blind.  The  following  8  weeks  of  the  main 
treatment  period  was  single-blinded  with  the  sponsor  and  investigators  aware  that  all  subjects  were 
receiving  roflumilast  500  μg  OD.  All  subjects  discontinuing  from  the  main  treatment  period  were 
permitted  to  enter  an  8-week,  Down-Titration  Period  where  subjects  received  open-label  roflumilast 
250 μg OD. In all cases, the original randomized treatment regimen remained blinded to all parties for 
the duration of the study. 
Roflumilast  250  μg  and  500  μg  tablets  as  well  as  the  placebo  tablets  were  identical  in  appearance, 
shape  and  color,  and  had  identical  labeling  and  packaging.  The  investigational  drug  blind  was 
maintained  using  the  IVRS/IWRS,  and  was  not  to  be  broken  unless  information  concerning  the 
investigational drug was necessary for the medical treatment of a subject, or in the event of a medical 
emergency (Section 8.5 of the protocol). 
• 
Statistical methods 
In this study, all confirmatory decisions were taken to assess superiority. For this purpose, the primary 
and key secondary endpoints in safety were based on the SAS, where as the key secondary endpoint in 
efficacy was based on the FAS (Intention-to-treat analysis). To analyze robustness of results, analyses 
based  on  the  VCS  (Per-protocol  analysis)  was  generally  performed  in  addition  and  interpreted  as 
supportive analysis. 
For  hypothesis  testing,  a  hierarchical  testing  procedure  was  prespecified  to  control  the  overall  type  I 
error rate of 5% for the primary and key secondary endpoints as described in above is as follows: 
The null hypotheses to be tested in a fixed order at the 2-sided 0.05 significance level were: 
•  H01: the percentage of discontinuations by Week 12 on roflumilast 250 μg OD/500 μg OD was not 
lower than or equal to that on roflumilast 500 μg OD. 
•  H02:  the  percentage  of  discontinuations  by  Week  12  on  roflumilast 500  μg  EOD/500  μg  OD  was 
not lower than or equal to that on roflumilast 500 μg OD. 
•  H03:  the  percentage  of  AEs  of  interest  by  Week  12  on  roflumilast  250  μg/500  μg  OD  was  not 
lower than or equal to that on roflumilast 500 μg OD. 
•  H04: the percentage of AEs of interest by Week 12 on roflumilast 500 μg EOD/500 μg OD was not 
• 
lower than or equal to that on roflumilast 500 μg OD. 
In  addition,  the  change  from  Baseline  (V0DT)  in  pre-bronchodilator  FEV1  during  the  open-label 
down-titration period was estimated. 
The  above  testing  procedure  controlled  the  5%  error  rate;  each  subsequent  hypothesis  would  be 
tested  for  confirmatory  basis  only  if  all  previously  tested  hypotheses  had  been  rejected.  As  a  result, 
the  principle  of  closed  testing  implied  that  the  overall  2-sided  false-rejection  rate  of  the  study  was 
maintained at 5%. If any test could not be performed on a confirmatory basis, because a previous test 
had failed, the test was performed in an exploratory manner. 
For statistical interpretation, the default significance level was 5%, CIs  for point estimates were 95% 
and all tests were interpreted as 2-sided. 
The  analyses  of  ‘main  interest’  for  the  Down-Titration  Period  were  those  conducted  in  only  those 
subjects who were taking roflumilast 500 μg OD during the Main Period at the time of discontinuation 
(thus excluding subjects  who discontinued whilst taking roflumilast 250 μg OD or 500 μg EOD during 
the Main Period for the Down-Titration Period).

The  primary  endpoint  (percentage  of  subjects  prematurely  discontinuing  study  treatment  for  any 
reason during the Main Period from V1 to Vend) was analyzed using a logistic regression model, with 
study  treatment,  country  and  baseline  FEV1  as  explanatory  variables.  Superiority  analyses  were 
performed using a hierarchical testing procedure. 
Comparisons  were  made  at  the  2-sided  5%  significance  level.  As  a  supportive  analysis,  the  hazard 
ratio for each up-titration arm compared with the roflumilast 500 μg OD arm and the associated 95% 
CI were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model with study treatment and country as class 
effects and baseline FEV1 as a continuous covariate. Subjects who did not discontinue study treatment 
during  the  Main  Period  were  censored  at  Vend  (final  visit  of  Main  Period).  A  sensitivity  analysis  was 
performed for the primary and key secondary endpoints. 
The  percentage  of  subjects  with  AEs  of  interest  (diarrhea,  nausea,  headache,  decreased  appetite, 
insomnia,  and  abdominal  pain)  was  analyzed  using  a  logistic  regression  analysis  as  part  of  the 
hierarchical  approach  as  described  for  the  primary  safety  endpoint.  Time  to  onset,  duration  and 
intensity of AEs of interest to evaluate tolerability was summarized descriptively. Descriptive statistics 
were  used  to  analyze  the  endpoint  of  percentage  of  subjects  prematurely  discontinuing  study 
treatment due to any reason (from V0DT to VendDT). 
Analyses of AEs, clinical laboratory values, vital signs, body weight and BMI, as well as C-SSRS were 
performed descriptively. 
Efficacy: 
The key secondary endpoint (change in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 from V0DT to VendDT) was assessed 
with an analysis of variance (ANCOVA) model using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) value, 
as described by Ebutt and Frith. The robustness of the primary method for the key-secondary endpoint 
was assessed using another ANCOVA model for repeated measurements, as described by Verbeke and 
Molenberghs. These analyses were repeated for change in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 from Baseline (V1) 
to  the  end  of  the  Main  Period  (Vend),  as  well  as  for  the  endpoints  of  change  from  Baseline  in  pre-
bronchodilator FVC and subject-assessed treatment satisfaction. 
Also,  as  a  sensitivity  analysis,  change  in  pre-bronchodilator  FEV1  from  baseline  (V0DT)  to  the  last 
scheduled  post-randomization  visit  was  analyzed  with  a  pattern  mixture  model  implemented  by 
multiple imputation replacing LOCF in accounting for missing data.

Changes in study conduct or in the planned analyses 
There was 1 protocol amendment: Protocol Amendment 1 with the following changes: 
•  All procedures outlined in the Vend visit were to be performed at V0DT for subjects continuing into 
the open-label Down-Titration Period of the study. 
•  Clarified  that  the  ‘Liver  Function  Test  Abnormalities’  were  not  be  a  separate  subject 
discontinuation/withdrawal category. 
•  Clarified  that  an  additional  dose  of  study  drug  was  not  to  be  provided  at  Vend  for  subjects 
discontinuing prematurely from the Main Period without continuing into the Down-Titration Period, 
and that only 1 PK sample was to be taken at this visit.

Participant flow  
The disposition of randomized subjects is summarized in Table 9. Of the 1323 subjects who went on to 
be  randomized,  2  subjects  (0.2%)  were  never  treated.  In  total,  1043  subjects  (79%)  completed  the 
Main  Period.  Of  the  278  subjects  (21.0%)  who  discontinued  during  the  Main  Period,  146  subjects 
(11.1%) discontinued during the first 4 weeks of the Main Period (up to Visit 3).  
A total of 104 subjects (7.9%) who withdrew from the Main Period entered the Down-Titration Period 
(where they received roflumilast 250 μg OD). Approximately one-quarter of these subjects went on to 
discontinue  from  this  Down-Titration  Period,  with  the  most  common  reason  for  discontinuation  from 
this  period  due  to  an  AE.  Of  the  104  subjects  who  entered  the  Down-Titration  Period,  80  subjects

(comprising of 20, 22 and 38 subjects from the 250 μg OD/500 μg OD, 500 μg EOD/500 μg OD, and 
500  μg  OD  treatment  groups,  respectively)  entered  after  not  tolerating  at  least  1  dose  of  roflumilast 
500  μg  OD  during  the  Main  Period.  The  remaining  24  subjects  (104-80=24)  who  entered  the  Down 
Titration Period did not receive roflumilast 500 μg OD in the Main Period but received either 250 μg OD 
or 500 μg EOD, during the first 4 weeks of low dose roflumilast.

Recruitment and study conduct 
In total, 1585 subjects were screened, of which 1323 subjects (83.5%) from 161 sites in 15 countries 
were  eligible  for  randomization  and  included  in  the  FAS.  The  most  common  reason  for  exclusion  was 
not meeting inclusion criteria (in 162 of 262 subjects [61.8%]).

Subjects  were  randomized  into  the  double-blind  main  treatment  period  at  a  total  of  161  sites  in  15 
countries:  Bulgaria  (11  sites),  Germany  (9),  Greece  (5),  Hungary  (21),  Republic  of  Korea  (9), 
Philippines  (4),  Poland  (15),  Romania  (19),  Russia  (17),  Slovakia  (12),  South  Africa  (14),  Spain  (2), 
Thailand (3), Ukraine (14), and United Kingdom (6). 
For  statistical  analyses,  countries  were  divided  into  4  regions  as  follows:  Western  Europe  (Germany, 
Spain,  United  Kingdom),  North-Eastern  Europe  (Poland,  Russia,  Ukraine),  South-Eastern  Europe 
(Bulgaria,  Greece,  Hungary,  Romania,  Slovakia),  and  Non-European  (South  Korea,  Philippines,  South 
Africa, Thailand).  
During the study, persistent noncompliance was noted at site 6002, which was based in South Africa. 
Following  routine  monitoring  of  the  site  a  number  of  significant  noncompliance  issues  were  noted 
including  inadequate  source  documentation  confirming  the  eligibility  of  3  subjects,  a  subinvestigator 
who  was  not  a  listed  delegate  obtaining  informed  consent,  and  the  incorrect  storing  of  PK  samples. 
Study recruitment at the site was paused while corrective action, including the retraining of staff was 
undertaken.  The  recruitment  hold  was  subsequently  lifted,  and  the  site  was  permitted  to  recruit  one 
subject.  Three  days  later,  the  site  monitor  reported  persistent  noncompliance  at  the  site,  resulting  in 
Takeda conducting an audit at the study site. At the time of the investigation, the site had screened 5 
subjects; 1 subject was a screen failure, and 4 subjects had completed the study. The audit was rated 
as  ‘unsatisfactory’  due  to  significant  noncompliance  issues,  and  the  site  was  closed  from  further 
participation in the study protocol.  
The noncompliance issues/site closure had been reported to the Ethics Committee and the Regulatory 
Authority  (Medicines  Control  Council)  of  South  Africa.  At  the  time  of  the  investigation,  the  site  had 
screened 5 subjects; 1 subject was a screen failure, and 4 subjects had completed the study. Although 
subject data was included in the primary intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, to account for any impact on 
data  integrity,  a  sensitivity  analysis  excluding  subject  data  from  South  African  Site  6002,  which  was 
suspected of scientific misconduct, was carried out.

Baseline data 
Main Period 
Demographic  and  baseline  characteristics  are  summarized  in  Table  10  for  the  Main  Period.  Overall, 
demographic  characteristics  were  similar  across  the  3  treatment  groups.  The  majority  of  subjects  in 
each  treatment  group  were  White  (405  subjects  [91.8%]  in  the  roflumilast  250  μg  OD/500  μg  OD 
group,  399  subjects  [91.3%]  in  the  roflumilast  500  μg  EOD/500  μg  OD  group  and  405  subjects 
[91.4%]  in  the  roflumilast  500  μg  OD  group).  The  mean  (SD)  age  of  subjects  was  64.2  (7.81),  65.0 
(8.21), and 64.6 (8.36) years in the roflumilast 250 μg OD/500 μg OD, 500 μg EOD/500 μg OD, and 
500  μg  OD  groups,  respectively.  The  250  μg  OD/  500  μg  OD  dose  group  was  comprised  of  more 
subjects aged 40 to 64 years (54.9% of subjects) than the other 2 dose groups (46.2% and 50.6% for 
500  μg  EOD/  500  μg  OD  and  500  μg  OD,  respectively).  The  majority  of  subjects  in  each  treatment 
group  were  male  (72.6%  in  roflumilast  250  μg  OD/500  μg  OD  group,74.4%  in  roflumilast  500  μg 
EOD/500 μg OD group, and 76.3% in roflumilast 500 μg OD group).

Other baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 11 for the Main Period. With the exception of 3 
subjects  whose  information  is  missing,  all  subjects had  a  history  of  COPD  exacerbation,  although  the 
majority  of  subjects  had  experienced  ≤2  episodes  within  the  1  year  prior  to  Screening.  A  small 
proportion of subjects (6.5%-6.9% across the 3 treatment groups) had previously received roflumilast 
treatment,  though  none  of  these  had  stopped  due  to  intolerability.  Baseline  lung  function  results 
(FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC, and %FEV1 reversibility) were broadly similar across the 3 treatment groups.

Concomitant medications 
Nearly all subjects in the Main Period (1320 subjects, 99.9%) were receiving an ongoing concomitant 
medication at Baseline. Overall, the type and frequency of concomitant medication was broadly similar 
across treatment groups (Table 12).

Down-Titration Period 
Demographic and baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 13 for subjects who did not tolerate 
roflumilast  500  μg  OD  during  the  Main  Period  and  subsequently  entered  the  Down-Titration  Period 
(N=80). 
Overall, demographic characteristics were similar across the 3 treatment groups in the Down-Titration 
Period.  As  shown  in  Table  13,  the  majority  of  subjects  in  each  treatment  group  were  White  (18 
subjects  [90.0%]  in  the  roflumilast  250  μg  OD/500  μg  OD  group,  21  subjects  [95.5%]  in  the 
roflumilast  500  μg  EOD/500  μg  OD  group,  and  34  subjects  [89.5%]  in  the  roflumilast  500  μg  OD 
group).  The  mean  (SD)  age  of  subjects  was  65.6  (8.82),  63.5  (5.93),  and  66.0  (7.78)  years  in  the 
roflumilast 250 μg OD/500 μg OD, 500 μg EOD/500 μg OD, and 500 μg OD groups, respectively. The

500 μg EOD/500 μg OD and 500μg OD treatment groups were comprised of more subjects aged 40 to 
64  years  (50.0%  and  52.6%  of  subjects,  respectively)  than  the  250  μg  OD/  500  μg  OD  dose  group 
(40.0%).  The  majority  of  subjects  in  each  treatment  group  were  male  (60.0%  in  roflumilast  250  μg 
OD/500  μg  OD  group,  54.5%  in  roflumilast  500  μg  EOD/500  μg  OD  group,  and  63.2%  in  roflumilast 
500 μg OD group). 
Table 11. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics of Subjects in the Down-
Titration Period Who Did Not Tolerate Roflumilast 500 μg OD in the Main Period 
(SAS, Down-Titration Period) 
As  shown  in  Table  14,  all  subjects  had  a  history  of  COPD  exacerbation,  although  no  subject  had 
experienced  >2  episodes  within  the  1  year  prior  to  Screening.  In  total,  5.0%,  9.1%,  and  13.2%  of 
subjects in the roflumilast 250 μg OD/500 μg OD, 500 μg EOD/500 μg OD, and 500 μg OD treatment 
groups, respectively, had previously received roflumilast treatment, though none of these had stopped 
due  to  intolerability.  There  was  an  imbalance  between  treatment  groups  in  baseline  %FEV1 
reversibility, probably due to the small sample size (N=80).

Protocol Deviations 
The  number  of  subjects  with  ≥1  protocol  deviation was  broadly  similar  across  treatment  groups,  and 
did not have any clinically significant impact on the interpretation of the study data or subject safety. 
In all treatment groups, the most common protocol deviation was “selection criteria not met”. 
Table 14. Significant Protocol Deviations (FAS) 
Measurements of Treatment Compliance 
Compliance to study medication was similarly high across treatment groups during the Main Period and 
Down-Titration Period. During the Main Period, at least 95% of subjects in all treatment groups having 
compliance  between  ≥75%  and  ≤125%  of  study  medication:  mean  (SD)  treatment  compliance  was 
104.42% (91.623%), 100.92% (14.138%), and 102.36% (20.549%) in roflumilast 250 μg OD/500 μg 
OD,  500  μg  EOD/500  μg  OD,  and  500  μg  OD  treatment  groups,  respectively.  During  the  Down-
Titration  Period,  mean  (SD)  treatment  compliance  was  99.21%  (4.177%),  107.75%  (26.381%),  and 
102.91%  (33.432%)  in  roflumilast  250  μg  OD/500  μg  OD,  500  μg  EOD/500  μg  OD,  and  500  μg  OD

treatment groups, respectively, with at least 90.9% of subjects in all treatment groups taking between 
≥75% and ≤125% of study medication. 
A significant protocol deviation of treatment compliance <75% or >125% was reported in 52 of 1323 
subjects  (3.9%)  during  the  Main  Period  and  in  3  of  1323  (0.2%)  during  the  Down-Titration  Period. 
Treatment  noncompliance  led  to  discontinuation  in  2  subjects  (both  in  the  250  μg  OD/500  μg  OD 
treatment group). 
• 
Outcomes and estimation 
The  primary  endpoint  of  this  study  was  the  percentage  of  subjects  prematurely  discontinuing  study 
treatment  due  to  any  reason  (during  Main  Period,  ie,  Visit  V1  to  Vend).  Although  this  is  a  safety 
endpoint, it is  described  first  in  this  assessment  report to  follow  the  same  hierarchy  as  in  the  clinical 
study.  
Efficacy was assessed as a ‘key secondary endpoint’, and ‘other secondary endpoint’ in this study. The 
key  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were  assessed  using  hierarchical  statistical  testing  procedures. 
However,  as  a  result  of the  failure to  reach  statistical  significance  for  the  second  hierarchical test,  all 
efficacy endpoints tested using this procedure were performed in an exploratory manner. 
Primary endpoint 
Primary Analysis of the Primary Endpoint: Percentage of Subjects Prematurely Discontinuing 
Study Treatment Due to Any Reason During the Main Period 
A  logistic  regression  model  was  used  with  terms  for  study  treatment,  country  and  baseline  FEV1  as 
explanatory variables. Treatment comparisons were made at a 5% significance level, 2-sided, following 
hierarchical  testing  procedure.  As  a  supportive  analysis  for  the  primary  results,  results  based  on  Cox 
proportional hazards model were also presented. 
The  result  of  the  statistical  analyses  for  the  primary  endpoint  is  shown  in  Table  17.  Compared  with 
roflumilast  500  μg  OD  [H01]  the  odds  of  discontinuing  the  Main  Period  were  statistically  significantly

roflumilast  500  μg  EOD/500  μg  OD  treatment  groups  [H02]  (OR  0.76,  95%  CI:  0.55,  1.07;  p-value

95% CI: 0.58, 1.02) versus roflumilast 500 μg OD.

A summary of the time to discontinuation during the Main Period is displayed in Figure 7. 
Compared  with  either  up-titration  treatment  group,  the  frequency  of  discontinuation  in  the  500  μg 
treatment group was greater and started to occur earlier. The Kaplan-Meier plot is based on the Main 
Period data only and, as indicated by the plot, some subjects had 150 days for their Main Period and 
were censored at that time point.

Any Reason During the Main Period (SAS, Main Period) 
Sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint: 
The results based on the logistic regression model with region as a covariate, instead of country, were 
consistent  with  the  primary  analysis  results;  compared  with  roflumilast  500  μg  OD,  the  odds  of 
discontinuing  from  the  Main  Period  were  lower  in  the  roflumilast  250  μg  OD/500  μg  OD  treatment 
group (OR=0.70, 95% CI: 0.50, 0.97; p-value 0.032). 
The results of the sensitivity analyses by excluding the South African site (Site 6002) for the primary 
endpoint supported the results of the primary analysis. Compared with roflumilast 500 μg OD, the odds 
of  discontinuing  from  the  Main  Period  were  lower in  the  roflumilast  250  μg  OD/500  μg  OD  treatment 
group (OR=0.66, 95% CI: 0.47, 0.93; p-value 0.017). 
This  is  not  unexpected,  as  this  site only  included  5 patients  and  only  2 of  them  had  a  primary  event 
(one in group 2 and one in group 3) 
Subgroup Analyses of the Primary Endpoint 
Subgroup  analysis  of  the  primary  endpoint  is  displayed  in  Figure  8.  In  the  majority,  analyses  of 
subgroups tended to support the primary finding, such that the odds of premature discontinuation from 
the Main Period were lower in the up-titration groups compared with the reference treatment.  
The subgroups that trended towards favoring reference treatment (roflumilast 500 μg OD) were non-
European region and Asian race (versus roflumilast 250 μg OD/500 μg OD), and north-Eastern Europe

CIs were wide for some subgroups, predominantly due to the small number of subjects in each of the 
subgroups. In particular, Asian race (32, 30, 32 subjects in the roflumilast 250 μg OD/500 μg OD, 500 
μg EOD/500 μg OD, and 500 μg OD treatment groups, respectively), and Western Europe (20, 33, and 
19 subjects, respectively).

Key Secondary Safety Endpoint: TEAEs of Interest during the Main Period 
The  results  of  the  statistical  analysis  of  TEAEs  of  Interest  (diarrhea,  nausea,  headache,  reduced 
appetite,  insomnia,  or  abdominal  pain)  during  the  Main  Period  are  considered  exploratory  based  on 
insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis for the primary endpoint at the 5% significance 
level  [H02]  in  the  framework  of  hierarchical  testing  (i.e.:  no  statistically  significant  differences  were 
found  for  the  comparison  between  groups  2  and  3  for  the  primary  endpoint  of  premature 
discontinuations).

Compared  with  roflumilast  500  μg  OD,  the  odds  of  experiencing  a  ‘TEAE  of  interest’  was  significantly 
lower  at  the  5%  significance  level  in  the  roflumilast  250  μg  OD/500  μg  OD  treatment  group  (54.2% 
versus  45.4%  of  subjects,  OR=0.63,  95%  CI:  0.47,  0.83;  p-value  =  0.001).  This  difference  was  not 
observed between roflumilast 500 μg EOD/500 μg OD (48.3% of subjects) and the roflumilast 500 μg 
OD (54.2%) treatment groups in the analysis of AEs of interest. 
The  more  frequent  TEAEs  of  interest  were  diarrhea,  decreased  appetite,  nausea  and  headache,  all  of 
them occurring more frequently and starting soon in the control group than in the roflumilast 250 μg 
OD/500 μg OD experimental group (Table 18).

Change From Baseline in Prebronchodilator FEV1 
Main period:  
Improvements  in  prebronchodilator  FEV1  from  V1  to  each  Main  Period  postrandomization  visit  were 
clinically  relevant  (approximately  100  mL)  and  showed  minimal  differences  across  the  3  treatment 
groups (LS means of 0.09 L, 0.13 L, and 0.11 L for roflumilast 250 μg OD/500 μg OD, 500 μg EOD/500 
μg OD, and roflumilast 500 μg OD treatment groups, respectively; Table 19 FAS). Similar results were 
shown  when  subjects  for  both  Main  Period  and  Down-Titration  Period  were  evaluated  (LS  means  of 
0.07  L,  0.14  L,  and  0.10  L  for  roflumilast  250  μg  OD/500  μg  OD,  500  μg  EOD/500  μg  OD,  and 
roflumilast 500 μg OD treatment groups, respectively; Table 19 FAS).  
Table 17. Statistical Analysis of the change in FEV1 during the study. 
SAS  and  FAS  Down-Titration  Period  analyses  are  based  on  a  subgroup  of  80  subjects  (250  μg  OD/500  μg  OD 
[n=20], 500 μg EOD/500 μg OD [n= 22], 500 μg OD [n= 38]), who received 500 μg OD and discontinued during 
the Main Period. VCS Down-Titration Period analyses are based on a subgroup of 69 subjects (250 μg OD/500 μg 
OD [n=16], 500 μg EOD/500 μg OD [n= 18], 500 μg OD [n=35]), who received 500 μg OD and discontinued during 
the Main Period.

Down-Titration  Period:  the  analysis  of  main  interest  was  for  those  patients  who  did  not  tolerate 
roflumilast  500  μg  OD  during  the  Main  Period  and  subsequently  entered  the  down-Titration  period 
(n=80), in order to ascertain whether a the 250 microgram dose, administered to all of them, could be

effective (i.e.: whether it could produce improvements in pre-BD FEV1 from the start of down-titration 
to  end  of  down-titration).  Eighty  subjects  (of  1321  subjects,  6.0%)  who  did  not  tolerate  roflumilast 
500  μg  OD  in  the  Main  Period  were  treated  with  roflumilast  250  μg  OD  for  8  weeks  (n=20  for  the 
roflumilast  250  μg  OD/500  μg  OD  group,  n=22  for  roflumilast  500  μg  EOD/500  μg  OD  group,  and 
n=38 for the roflumilast 500 μg OD group at Baseline, V0DT). The analyses indicated no effect of the 
250 microgram low-dose roflumilast in pre-BD FEV1 (Table 20).  
Table 18. Change in pre-BD FEV1 (L) from baseline down-titration to last scheduled 
down-titration period visit (FAS and VCS). 
The lack of effect on pre-BD FEV1 of a lower roflumilast maintenance dose was consistent in the per-
protocol analysis based on the VCS and in several sensitivity analyses. 
Other efficacy endpoints: 
FVC: In all treatment groups, mean FVC increased from V1 to Vend. Improvements in mean FVC from 
V1  to  each  Main  Period  post-randomization  visit  showed  minimal  differences  across  the  3  treatment 
groups (LS Means of 0.09L, 0.15L, and 0.15L for roflumilast 250 μg OD/ 500 μg OD, 500 μg EOD/500 
μg  OD,  and  roflumilast  500  μg  OD  treatment  groups,  respectively).  Similar  results  were  shown  when 
subjects for both Main Period and Down-Titration Period were evaluated (LS means of 0.09 L, 0.17 L, 
and 0.14 L for roflumilast 250 μg OD/500 μg OD, 500 μg EOD/500 μg OD, and roflumilast 500 μg OD 
treatment groups, respectively. 
Patients'  satisfaction  with  treatment:  Subject  treatment  satisfaction  was  assessed  by  asking 
subjects  to  assess  their  satisfaction  with  their  COPD  therapy  at  each  visit  on  a  7-point  scale  ranging 
from  0  indicating  very  satisfied  to  6  indicating  very  dissatisfied.  Therefore,  a  within  group  negative 
change  from  baseline  indicates  increased  satisfaction  with  study  treatment  compared  with  previous 
treatment  at  baseline,  while  a  between  group  negative  difference  indicates  an  increased  change  in 
satisfaction  with  experimental  treatment  versus  baseline  compared  with  the  corresponding  change  in 
the control treatment.  
Assessment report  
EMA/154975/2018

At  baseline,  patients  had  a  mean  1.8  score,  which  indicates  that  the  majority  were  between  1 
(Satisfied) and 2 (Somewhat satisfied), but closer to 2. 
Analyses  without  adjustment  for  multiplicity  found  a  statistically  significant  difference  at  the  5% 
significance  level  for  the  change  in  subject-assessed  treatment  satisfaction  scores  from  V1  to  each 
post-randomization  visit  during  the  Main  Period  favoring  roflumilast  250  μg  OD/500  μg  OD  versus 
roflumilast 500 μg (LS mean for treatment difference -0.20, 95% CI: -0.33, -0.06; p-value 0.004; see 
Table  below).  Therefore,  patients  on  the  control  group  still  remained  closer  to  score  2  (somewhat 
satisfied) while patients on the group 1 became closer to score 1 (satisfied). 
Table 19. Statistical Analysis of the Change in Subject-Assessed Treatment 
Satisfaction 
Looking at the descriptive data at D84, there are numerically more patients in up-titration group1 that 
are satisfied (score 0-2) (89.1%) than in the control group (85.7%). On the contrary, there are more 
patients dissatisfied (score 4-6) in the control group (7.5%) than in up-titration group 1 (3.7%) (Table

2.9.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
This submission is based on data from a single study (Study RO 2455 302-RD [OPTIMIZE]) conducted 
to  fulfil  a  Committee  for  Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use  (CHMP)  postauthorisation  measure 
(FUM004)  to  explore  alternative  doses  of  roflumilast  to  minimise  the  risk  of  drug  interactions,  poor 
tolerability, and the influence of factors such as gender, age, and smoking status on the bioavailability 
of the product in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  
OPTIMIZE was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 3-arm, parallel group, phase 3 study with an 
open-label Down-Titration Period for subjects who withdrew from the Main Period of the study. During 
the  Main  Period,  subjects  were  randomized  receive  1  of  the  3  treatments  consisting  of  2  up-titration 
treatment groups: 250 μg OD or 500 μg EOD for the first 4 weeks followed by 500 μg OD for 8 weeks, 
and  the  currently  approved  roflumilast  regimen  of  500 μg  OD  administered  for  12  weeks.  During  the 
Main  Period,  the  first  4  weeks  (up-titration)  was  double-blinded,  and  the  following  8  weeks 
(maintenance  period)  was  single-blinded.  All  subjects  discontinuing  from  the  Main  Period  were 
permitted to enter an 8-week open-label Down-Titration Period where they received roflumilast 250 μg 
OD.  
Spirometry  and  subject-assessed  treatment  satisfaction  for  efficacy  assessments  were  performed  at 
Screening (V0, Days -21 to -7), Randomization (V1, Day 1), and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 (Visits V2, 
V3, V4, and Vend) of the Main Period, and at Baseline (V0DT=Vend of Main Period) and at Weeks 2, 4 
and 8 (Visits V1DT, V2DT and VendDT) of the Down-Titration Period. Six milliliter blood samples for PK 
analysis were drawn at Visits V2, V4, Vend/V0DT, V1DT, V2DT and VendDT. 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria in OPTIMIZE study are in line with the indication (severe COPD and  a 
history  of  exacerbations)  and  contraindications/non-recommendation  of  use  detailed  in  the  Daxas 
SmPC. Study medications included  roflumilast 250 μg tablet, 500 μg tablet and placebo (roflumilast 0 
μg  tablet).    Placebo  was  used  only  during  the  4-week  up-titration  period  (the  only  phase  that  was 
double-blinded)  (the  8  week  continuation  after  initial  4-week  up-titration  was  single  blinded,  as 
investigators  knew  that  all  patients  were  receiving  the  roflumilast  500  μg  tablet,  although  they  were 
unaware of the type of initial 4-week treatment that patients had received). 
Primary  Endpoint  was  the  percentage  of  subjects  prematurely  discontinuing  study  treatment  due  to 
any  reason  during  Main  Period.  Key  Secondary  Endpoints  included  the  percentage  of  subjects  with 
adverse  events  (AEs)  of  interest  to  evaluate  tolerability  during  Main  Period,    the  change  in 
prebronchodilator FEV1 during Down-Titration Period (V0DT to VendDT) and the percentage of subjects 
prematurely  discontinuing  study  treatment  due  to  any  reason  during  Down-Titration  Period  (V0DT  to 
VendDT).  Other  secondary  endpoints  were:    change  in  prebronchodilator  FEV1  during  Main  Period  of 
the  study,  change  in  prebronchodilator  FVC  during  Main  Period  and  also  including  Down-Titration 
Period;  change  in  subject-assessed  treatment  satisfaction  scores  during  Main Period  of the  study  and 
also including Down-Titration Period. 
Randomisation and blinding/masking methods were appropriate.

Subjects  were  randomized  into  the  double-blind  main  treatment  period  at  a  total  of  161  sites  in  15 
countries:  Bulgaria  (11  sites),  Germany  (9),  Greece  (5),  Hungary  (21),  Republic  of  Korea  (9), 
Philippines  (4),  Poland  (15),  Romania  (19),  Russia  (17),  Slovakia  (12),  South  Africa  (14),  Spain  (2), 
Thailand (3), Ukraine (14), and United Kingdom (6). During the study, persistent noncompliance was 
noted  at  site  6002,  which  was  based  in  South  Africa.  At  the  time  of  the  investigation,  the  site  had 
screened 5 subjects; 1 subject was a screen failure, and 4 subjects had completed the study. The site 
was closed from further participation in the study protocol. A request for triggered GCP inspection  was 
proposed  by  the  Rapporteur  for  the  following  clinical  study:  RO-2455-302-RD  (OPTIMIZE)  and  was 
discussed  at  CHMP.    It  should  be  ruled  out  that  the  non  compliance  on  GCP  is  an  isolated  finding  in 
center  6002  in  South-Africa  or  if  it  is  systemic  to  the  whole  trial.  The  CHMP  did  not  find  sufficient 
reasons to trigger an inspection for this study. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 1321 randomized patients received at least one dose of study drug (441 in 250/500 microg 
group  1;  437  in  500  microg  EOD  group  2;  443  in  the  500  microg  OD  control  group).  Overall, 
demographic  characteristics  were  similar  across  the  3  treatment  groups.  The  majority  of  subjects  in 
each  treatment  group  were  White  (405  subjects  [91.8%]  in  the  roflumilast  250  μg  OD/500  μg  OD 
group,  399  subjects  [91.3%]  in  the  roflumilast  500  μg  EOD/500  μg  OD  group  and  405  subjects 
[91.4%]  in  the  roflumilast  500  μg  OD  group).  The  mean  (SD)  age  of  subjects  was  64.2  (7.81),  65.0 
(8.21), and 64.6 (8.36) years in the roflumilast 250 μg OD/500 μg OD, 500 μg EOD/500 μg OD, and 
500  μg  OD  groups,  respectively.  The  250  μg  OD/  500  μg  OD  dose  group  was  comprised  of  more 
subjects aged 40 to 64 years (54.9% of subjects) than the other 2 dose groups (46.2% and 50.6% for 
500  μg  EOD/  500  μg  OD  and  500  μg  OD,  respectively).  The  majority  of  subjects  in  each  treatment 
group  were  male  (72.6%  in  roflumilast  250  μg  OD/500  μg  OD  group,74.4%  in  roflumilast  500  μg 
EOD/500 μg OD group, and 76.3% in roflumilast 500 μg OD group). 
Nearly all subjects in the Main Period (1320 subjects, 99.9%) were receiving an ongoing concomitant 
medication at Baseline. Overall, the type and frequency of concomitant medication was broadly similar 
across  treatment  groups.  About  67%  of  patients  was  receiving  a  dual  ICS+LABA  combination  during 
the main period, and 63% of patients were receiving a LAMA. However, no data about the aggregated 
number  of  patients  receiving  the  ICS+LAMA  combination  or  ICS+LABA+LAMA  combination  were 
reported. Tolerability may differ (be worse) at increasing number of concomitant medications. In fact, 
concomitant LAMA use was a covariate in the PK/PD model of adverse events.  
During  the  procedure,  the  applicant  was  requested  to  analyse  the  main  endpoint  and  key  secondary 
safety  endpoint  in  the  target  population  included  in  the  product  labelling  (i.e.:  severe  COPD  patients 
treated  with  ICS  plus  LABA  and/or  LAMA),  separately  for  dual  combination  (ICS+LABA  or  LAMA)  and 
triple  combination  (ICS+LABA+LAMA)  and  to  discuss  the  findings.  The  results  were  hampered  by  its 
post-hoc nature and lack of statistical power due to small sample sizes. Anyway, the analysis provided 
justify  for  all  of  the  subgroups  studied  to  take  advantage  of  the  250  µg  OD/500 µg  OD  up-titration 
regimen, regardless of concomitant LAMA or multiple concomitant medication use. 
Percentage  of  Subjects  Prematurely  Discontinuing  Study  Treatment  Due  to  Any  Reason 
During the Main Period (main endpoint): Compared with roflumilast 500 μg OD [H01] the odds of 
discontinuing the  Main  Period  using  a logistic  regression  model  were  statistically  significantly  lower in 
the roflumilast 250 μg OD/500 μg OD treatment group at the 5% significance level (24.6% vs. 18.4% 
of subjects, OR=0.66, 95% CI: 0.47, 0.93; p-value 0.017, primary endpoint). At the 5% significance 
level,  there  was  no  statistically  significant  difference  between  roflumilast  500  μg  OD  and  roflumilast 
500  μg  EOD/500  μg  OD  treatment  groups  [H02]  (OR  0.76,  95%  CI:  0.55,  1.07;  p-value  0.114). 
Supportive  analysis  Cox  proportional  hazards  model  found  a  similar  result  for  roflumilast  250  μg 
OD/500  μg  OD  (HR=0.68,  95  %  CI:  0.51,  0.92)  and  roflumilast  500  μg  EOD/500  μg  OD  (HR=0.77, 
95% CI: 0.58, 1.02) versus roflumilast 500 μg OD. 
The results based on the logistic regression model with region as a covariate, instead of country, were 
consistent  with  the  primary  analysis  results.  Compared  with  roflumilast  500  μg  OD  [H01The  odds  of 
discontinuing  from  the  Main  Period  were  lower  in  the  roflumilast  250  μg  OD/500  μg  OD  treatment 
group  (OR=0.70,  95%  CI:  0.50,  0.97;  p-value  0.032).  The  results  of  the  sensitivity  analyses  by

excluding  the  South  African  site  (Site  6002)  for  the  primary  endpoint  supported  the  results  of  the 
primary analysis also yielded significant differences (OR=0.66, 95% CI: 0.47, 0.93; p-value 0.017). 
Strictly  speaking,  the  single  pivotal  trial  supporting  this  application  does  not  fulfill  with  the  level  of 
statistical significance (considerably stronger than <0.05) normally required for application based on a 
single  pivotal  trial  (Points  to  consider  on  application  with  1.  meta-analyses;  2.  one  pivotal  study; 
CHMP/EWP/2330/99).  However,  it  has  to  bear  in  mind  that,  on  the  one  hand,  the  results  on  the 
primary  (safety)  endpoint  were  quite  robust,  with  all  sensitivity  and  ancillary  analyses  of  the  main 
endpoint  showing  a  benefit,  and  with  all  secondary  endpoint  showing  also  a  benefit  in  safety  and 
patient's  satisfaction  and  no  detrimental  effect  on  efficacy  (pre-BD  FEV1).  On  the  other  hand,  the 
efficacy  of  roflumilast  is  out  of  question  at  this  stage,  and  the  line  extension  is  restricted  to  improve 
the initial tolerability and decrease early withdrawal rates with treatment by starting with a lower dose. 
It  is  concluded  that  starting  with  a  halved  dose  for  the  first  4  weeks  followed  by  the  500  microg 
maintenance  dose  is  safer  than  starting  with  500  microg  dose.  In  addition,  no  claims  of  efficacy  are 
made for this starting dose.  
Anyway,  while  recognizing  that  a  streamlined  posology  aimed  to  minimize  adverse  events  and 
treatment discontinuations is a positive goal, the applicant was requested to discuss about the clinical 
relevance  and  impact  of  decreasing  the  number  of  discontinuations  by  6.2%  in  terms  of  preventing 
exacerbations.    With  a  6.2%  reduction  of  discontinuations  in  the  current  population  treated  with 
roflumilast would translate into a 12.9% reduction in exacerbations during the first year. According to 
market share of roflumilast in different regions, this would translate in the prevention of additional 340 
exacerbations in Europe and 1031 exacerbations globally, compared with starting with the 500 microg 
dose. This benefit is added to the adverse events (mainly gastrointestinal) prevented. 
During  the  procedure, the  applicant  was  requested to discuss  whether  the  results  at 3  months  would 
be sustained in the long term. In roflumilast clinical trials, Kaplan-Meier plots of time to onset of AEs 
show  that  the  majority  of  events  in  the  roflumilast  treated-patients  occur  early,  and  that  there  is  a 
plateau  after  4  weeks.  Therefore,  the  first  4 weeks  of  treatment  represents  the  dosing  period  most 
relevant  to  the  aims  of  the  study  (ie,  to  improve  tolerability  of  roflumilast  through  use  of  alternative 
dosing regimens).  After this time, there is no evidence to support a need for further improvements, as 
the frequency of AEs with roflumilast is not higher than with placebo, and the rate of withdrawals from 
study treatment are low. 
The results of the per protocol analysis provided during the procedure wer consistent with the results 
of  the  primary  analysis  and  supported  the  finding  that  protocol  deviations  had  no  impact  on  the 
interpretation of the study data. 
Most  subgroups  trended  towards  favouring  the  250/500  microg  OD  up-titration  regimen  with  some 
exceptions. The subgroups that trended towards favoring reference treatment (roflumilast 500 μg OD) 
were  non-European  region  and  Asian  race  (versus  roflumilast  250  μg  OD/500  μg  OD),  and  north-
Eastern Europe region and current smoking status (versus roflumilast 500 μg EOD/500 μg OD).  
Race was not a significant covariate in population PK analysis, whereas in subgroup analyses of pivotal 
studies  (Study M2-124  and  Study  M2-125),  the  effect  of  roflumilast  versus  placebo  on  the  rate  of 
moderate or severe exacerbations showed no heterogeneity depending on race.  Results from the new 
population  PK  model  on  the  combined  REACT  and  OPTIMIZE  dataset  identified  no  clinically  relevant 
changes  of  systemic  exposure  levels  in  other  populations  of  particular  interest  (eg,  elderly  patients, 
female  patients,  smoking  status,  or  patients  with  high  [>80 kg]  or  low  [<60 kg]  baseline  body 
weight).    With  respect  to  race,  Therefore,  the  approved  maintenance  dose  of  roflumilast  500 μg  OD 
does not need to be adjusted in these populations.  
Assessment report  
EMA/154975/2018

Elderly patients seem under-represented in the OPTIMIZE study, and they are a special population at 
risk of adverse events and withdrawals. The applicant clarified that only 115 patients were between 75 
to  84  years  and  only  2  patients  were  >85  years  old.  With  the  limitations  of  small  sample  sizes,  the 
subgroup  analyses  by  age  showed  some  small  increases  in  adverse  events  with  age  with  all  dosing 
regimes, but the benefit of the new dosing regime in avoiding adverse events and discontinuations was 
consistently in favour of the new roflumilast regime regardless of age. 
TEAEs of Interest during the Main Period (Key Secondary Safety Endpoint):  
The  more  frequent  TEAEs  of  interest  were  diarrhea,  decreased  appetite,  nausea  and  headache,  all  of 
them occurring more frequently and starting soon in the control group than in the roflumilast 250 μg 
OD/500 μg OD experimental group. Compared with roflumilast 500 μg OD, the odds of experiencing a 
‘TEAE of interest’ was significantly lower at the 5% significance level in the roflumilast 250 μg OD/500 
μg  OD  treatment  group  (54.2%  versus  45.4%  of  subjects,  OR=0.63,  95%  CI:  0.47,  0.83;  p-value  = 
0.001).  This  difference  was  not  observed  between  roflumilast  500  μg  EOD/500  μg  OD  (48.3%  of 
subjects) and the roflumilast 500 μg OD (54.2%) treatment groups in the analysis of AEs of interest.  
The  results  of  the  statistical  analysis  of  TEAEs  of  Interest  (diarrhea,  nausea,  headache,  reduced 
appetite, insomnia, or abdominal pain) during the Main Period are supportive and consistent with the 
results  on  the  main  study  endpoint.  However,  they  are  considered  exploratory  based  on  insufficient 
evidence  to  reject  the  null  hypothesis  for  the  primary  endpoint  at  the  5%  significance  level  [H02]  in 
the  framework  of  hierarchical  testing  (i.e.:  no  statistically  significant  differences  were  found  for  the 
comparison between groups 2 and 3 for the primary endpoint of premature discontinuations).  
Change From Baseline in Prebronchodilator FEV1: 
a) Main treatment period:  
Improvements  in  prebronchodilator  FEV1  from  V1  to  each  Main  Period  postrandomization  visit  were 
clinically  relevant  (approximately  100  mL)  and  showed  minimal  differences  across  the  3  treatment 
groups (LS means of 0.09 L, 0.13 L, and 0.11 L for roflumilast 250 μg OD/500 μg OD, 500 μg EOD/500 
μg  OD,  and  roflumilast  500  μg  OD  treatment  groups,  respectively).  Similar  results  were  shown  when 
subjects for both Main Period and Down-Titration Period were evaluated (LS means of 0.07 L, 0.14 L, 
and 0.10 L for roflumilast 250 μg OD/500 μg OD, 500 μg EOD/500 μg OD, and roflumilast 500 μg OD 
treatment groups, respectively). 
b) Down-Titration Period:  
The analysis of main interest was for those patients who did not tolerate roflumilast 500 μg OD during 
the  Main  Period  and  subsequently  entered  the  down-Titration  period  (n=80),  in  order  to  ascertain 
whether  a  the  250  microgram  dose,  administered  to  all  of  them,  could  be  effective  (i.e.:  whether  it 
could produce improvements in pre-BD FEV1 from the start of downtitration to end of downtitration). 
Eighty subjects (of 1321 subjects, 6.0%) who did not tolerate roflumilast 500 μg OD in the Main Period 
were treated with roflumilast 250 μg OD for 8 weeks (n=20 for the roflumilast 250 μg OD/500 μg OD 
group,  n=22  for  roflumilast  500  μg  EOD/500  μg  OD  group,  and  n=38  for  the  roflumilast  500  μg  OD 
group at Baseline, V0DT). The analyses indicated no effect of the 250 microgram low-dose roflumilast 
in  pre-BD  FEV1.  The  lack  of  effect  on  pre-BD  FEV1  of  a  lower  roflumilast  maintenance  dose  was 
consistent in the per-protocol analysis based on the VCS and in several sensitivity analyses. 
During  the  procedure,  it  was  introduced  in  the  product  information  that  the  250  micrograms  dose  is 
subtherapeutic and should not be used for maintenance treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/154975/2018  
Page 62/94 
 
 
 
 
 
FVC:  In  all  treatment  groups,  mean  FVC  increased  from  V1  to  Vend  with  minimal  differences  across 
the  3  treatment  groups.  Similar  results  were  shown  when  subjects  for  both  Main  Period  and  Down-
Titration Period were evaluated. 
Patients'  satisfaction  with  treatment:  The  secondary  outcome  of  mean  treatment  difference  in 
increased patient's satisfaction with treatment is difficult to interpret in terms of clinical relevance, as 
the  mean  values  at  study  time-point  compared  with  baseline  remain  between  1  (satisfied)  and  2 
(somewhat  satisfied)  regardless  of  dosing  schedule  applied.  Looking  at  the  descriptive  data  at  D84, 
there are numerically more patients in up-titration group1 that are very satisfied or satisfied (89.1%) 
than in the control group (85.7%). On the contrary, there are more patients dissatisfied (score 4-6) in 
the  control  group  (7.5%)  than  in  the  up-titration  group  1  (3.7%).  Therefore,  it  seems  that  patient's 
satisfaction tended to be improved with the up-titration regime than with the standard regime. These 
results  are  consistent  with  the  primary  endpoint  of  treatment  withdrawals  and  the  key  secondary 
endpoint  of  AEs  of  interest  (less  risk  of  diarrhoea,  insomnia,  nausea).  Patient's  satisfaction  with  up-
titration probably reflects a better tolerability (less adverse events with the 250 microg to 500 microg 
up-titration)  at  similar  efficacy  in  terms  of  lung  function  improvement  (i.e.:  similar  improvement  in 
pre-BD FEV1 regardless of dosing schedule, close to +100 ml). 
2.9.3.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
This submission is based on data from a single study (Study RO 2455 302-RD [OPTIMIZE]) conducted 
to  fulfil  a  Committee  for  Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use  (CHMP)  post-authorization  measure 
(FUM004)  to  explore  alternative  doses  of  roflumilast  to  minimize  the  risk  of  poor  tolerability,  and  to 
investigate  the  influence  of  factors  such  as  gender,  age,  and  smoking  status  on  the  bioavailability  of 
the product in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  
Compared with standard dosing (roflumilast 500 μg OD),  patients on the roflumilast 250 μg OD/500 
μg  OD  up-titration  dosing  regimen  had  statistically  significant  lower  odds  of  discontinuing  the  Main 
Period using a logistic regression model (24.6% vs. 18.4% of subjects, OR=0.66, 95% CI: 0.47, 0.93; 
p-value 0.017, primary endpoint). Supportive analysis Cox proportional hazards model found a similar 
result  for  roflumilast  250  μg  OD/500  μg  OD  (HR=0.68,  95  %  CI:  0.51,  0.92).  The  results  were 
consistent  using  region  as  a  covariate,  instead  of  country.  In  addition,  the  results  of  the  sensitivity 
analyses  by  excluding  the  South  African  site  (Site  6002)  for  the  primary  endpoint  also  yielded 
significant differences (OR=0.66, 95% CI: 0.47, 0.93; p-value 0.017). On the contrary, the second up-
titration  regime  tested  (roflumilast  500  μg  EOD/500  μg  OD)  was  not  superior  to  the  standard  dosing 
regime in reducing discontinuations (OR 0.76, 95% CI: 0.55, 1.07; p-value 0.114). 
While  recognizing  that  a  streamlined  posology  aimed  to  minimize  adverse  events  and  treatment 
discontinuations is a positive goal, the applicant was requested to discuss about the clinical relevance 
and  impact  of  decreasing  the  number  of  discontinuations  by  6.2%  in  terms  of  preventing 
exacerbations.  The  applicant  considered  that,  6.2%  reduction  of  discontinuations  in  the  current 
population treated with roflumilast would translate into a 12.9% reduction in exacerbations during the 
first  year.  According  to  market  share  of  roflumilast  in  different  regions,  this  would  translate  in  the 
prevention of additional 340 exacerbations in Europe and 1031 exacerbations globally, compared with 
starting with the 500 microg dose. This benefit is added to the adverse events (mainly gastrointestinal) 
prevented. 
Most subgroups trended towards favouring the 250/500 microgram OD up-titration regimen with some 
exceptions (non-European region and Asian race).   Race was not a significant covariate in population 
PK  analysis,  whereas  in  subgroup  analyses  of  pivotal  studies  (Study M2-124  and  Study  M2-125),  the 
effect  of  roflumilast  versus  placebo  on  the  rate  of  moderate  or  severe  exacerbations  showed  no 
heterogeneity depending on race.  Results from the new population PK model on the combined REACT 
and  OPTIMIZE  dataset  identified  no  clinically  relevant  changes  of  systemic  exposure  levels  in  other 
populations  of  particular  interest  (eg,  elderly  patients,  female  patients,  smoking  status,  or  patients

with  high  [>80 kg]  or  low  [<60 kg]  baseline  body  weight).    With  respect  to  race,  Therefore,  the 
approved  maintenance  dose  of  roflumilast  500 μg  OD  does  not  need  to  be  adjusted  in  these 
populations. 
With  respect  to  lung  function,  the  three  dosing  regimens  were  associated  to  similar  improvements  in 
pre-BD FEV1 versus baseline, thus suggesting that all treatment approaches had similar efficacy. The 
analysis  of  FEV1  during  down-titration  period  in  patients  who  did  not  tolerate  roflumilast  in  the  main 
period indicated no effect of the 250 microgram low-dose roflumilast in pre-BD FEV1. The lack of effect 
on  pre-BD  FEV1  of  a  lower  roflumilast  maintenance  dose  was  consistent  in  the  per-protocol  analysis 
based on the VCS and in several sensitivity analyses. In the product information it has been reinforced 
the message that the 250 micrograms dose is sub-therapeutic and should not be used for maintenance 
treatment. 
2.9.4.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
A summary of the duration of exposure to study drug (in weeks) during the Main Period is described in 
Table  24.  The  mean  and  median  duration  of  exposure  was  broadly  similar  across  treatment  groups. 
The  roflumilast  500  μg  OD  treatment group  tended  to  have  a  greater  number  of  subjects  (72  of  443 
subjects,  16.3%)  who  received  treatment  for  ≤4  weeks  compared  with  the  up-titration  treatment 
groups. More than 80% of subjects in each treatment group had exposure to roflumilast for more than 
8 weeks during the Main Period (Table 24). 
Table 22. Main Period Study Medication Exposure (SAS, Main Period) 
Down-Titration Period 
Patients  were  exposed  to  roflumilast  250  micrograms  for  a  mean  between  6.7  to  7.2  weeks  in 
subgroups  by  prior  treatment.  At  least  80%  of  subjects  were  exposed  to  roflumilast  250  micrograms 
for  more  than  4  weeks  during  the  Down-Titration  Period  in  subgroups  by  prior  treatment.  Only  12 
patients were exposed for less than 4 weeks.

Summary of AEs by relatedness and severity 
Main  Period:  An  overview  of  TEAEs  occurring  during  the  Main  Period  is  summarized  in  Table  25. 
Overall, 61.2%, 64.3%, and 65.7% of subjects receiving 250 μg OD/500 μg OD, 500 μg EOD/ 500 μg 
OD, and 500 μg OD, respectively, experienced at least 1 TEAE during the Main Period (Table 25). The

majority of TEAEs were investigator-assessed as unrelated to study treatment, and were rated mild-to-
moderate intensity. In 15.3% of subjects, the TEAE led to study drug discontinuation. 
Serious  TEAEs  occurred  in  a  similar  proportion  of  subjects  across  treatment  groups  (4.3%-5.0%  of 
subjects); the majority of SAEs were investigator-assessed as unrelated to study treatment. 
Overall, 6 subjects (0.5%) died (1 further subject died ≥30 days after the last dose of roflumilast and 
is not included in Table 25, but is discussed in next section about SAES and death. 
Table 23. Overview of TEAEs Occurring in the Main Period (SAS, Main Period) 
Down-Titration  Period:  As  shown  in  Table  26,  TEAEs  occurred  in  45.0%,  50.0%,  and  65.8%  of

(N=20), 500 μg EOD/500 μg OD (N=22), and 500 μg OD (N=38), respectively, during the Main Period. 
In 12.5% of subjects, the TEAE led to study drug discontinuation. One subject in the roflumilast 250 μg 
OD/500  μg  OD  treatment  group  experienced  a  serious  and  treatment-related  TEAE  (of  COPD).  There 
were no deaths during the Down-Titration Period.

Overview of TEAEs by System Organ Class (SOC) 
Main Period: TEAEs reported in ≥2% of subjects in any treatment group are summarized in Table 27 
for  the  Main  Period.  The  most  frequently  reported TEAEs  during  the  Main  Period  were  in  the  SOCs  of 
Gastrointestinal  disorders  (36.5%,  38.2%,  and  44.2%  of  subjects  in  250  μg  OD/500  μg  OD,  500  μg 
EOD/500  μg  OD,  and  500  μg  OD treatment  groups,  respectively),  Nervous  system  disorders  (27.0%, 
30.9%, and 29.3% of subjects, respectively), Metabolism and nutrition disorders (23.1%, 24.9%, and 
30.0%, respectively), and Psychiatric disorders (22.9%, 24.9%, and 25.5% of subjects, respectively). 
TEAEs  in  the  SOC  Cardiac  disorders  were  infrequent  (1.2%  of  1321  subjects),  occurring  in  1.6%, 
1.1%,  and  0.9%  of  subjects  in  250  μg  OD  500  μg  OD,  500  μg  EOD/500  μg  OD,  and  500  μg  OD

disorders  (15.0%,  18.2%,  and  26.3%  of  subjects,  respectively),  Metabolism  and  nutrition  disorders 
(15.0%,  18.2%,  and  23.7%,  respectively),  and  Psychiatric  disorders  (10.0%,  22.7%,  and  15.8%  of 
subjects,  respectively).  These  most  frequent  events  were  consistent  with  those  observed  in  the  Main 
Period. No subjects experienced a TEAE in the SOC Cardiac disorders during the Down-Titration Period. 
TEAEs in the SOC Infections and infestations occurred in 15.0%, 0%, and 15.8% of subjects in 250 μg 
OD/500  μg  OD  (N=20),  500  μg  EOD/500  μg  OD  (N=22),  and  500  μg  OD  (N=38)  treatment  groups, 
respectively.  
Treatment-Related TEAEs 
Main  Period:  Overall,  145  subjects  (32.9%),  159  subjects  (36.4%),  and  177  subjects  (40.0%) 
receiving  roflumilast  250  μg  OD/500  μg  OD,  500  μg  EOD  500  μg  OD,  and  500  μg  OD,  respectively,

experienced  a  TEAE  that  was  investigator-assessed  as  related  to  roflumilast  (Table  28).  The  most 
frequent  treatment-related  TEAEs  were  in  the  SOCs  Gastrointestinal  disorders,  Metabolism  and 
nutrition disorders, Psychiatric disorders, and Nervous system disorders (Table 28). TEAEs occurring in 
≥1% of subjects in any treatment group are shown in Table 28.

Serious adverse events and deaths 
Deaths 
Seven  subjects  died  over  the  duration  of  this  study.  Of  the  7  deaths,  6  subjects  (of  a  total  of  1321 
subjects,  0.5%)  died  in  the  Main  Period.  The  remaining  death  (Subject  6164/004  in  treatment  group 
250 μg OD/ 500 μg OD) occurred ≥30 days after the last dose of study medication. None of the SAEs 
leading to death were investigator-assessed as related to study treatment.

Down-Titration Period: Of the 80 subjects that entered the Down-Titration Period after not tolerating 
roflumilast  500  μg  OD  in  the  Main  Period,  1  subject  (1.3%)  who  entered  this  period  in  the  250  μg 
OD/500  μg  OD  treatment  group  experienced  1  serious  TEAE.  The  SAE  of  (worsening)  COPD  was 
investigator-assessed as treatment-related. 
Other significant AEs: 
Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
No  completed  or  attempted  suicide  was  reported  during  the  treatment  period.  Suicidal  ideation  was 
reported in 1 subject in the roflumilast 500 μg OD group during the Main Period (Subject 6146/015), 
and  resulted  in  discontinuation  from  the  study.  There  was  no  suicide  or  suicidal  ideation  reported 
during the Down-Titration Period. 
Laboratory findings 
There  were  no  clinically  relevant  changes  in  mean  or  median  serum  chemistry  or  hematology  values 
from V1 at Vend for any treatment group during the Main Period, or from V1 or V0DT to VendDT in the 
Down  Titration  Period.  No  more  than  2.2%  of  subjects  in  any  treatment  group  had  serum  chemistry 
values  that  met  criteria  for  ‘markedly  abnormal’  during  the  Main  Period  and  no  more  than  2%  of 
subjects  in  any  treatment  group  had  hematology  values  that  met  criteria  for  ‘markedly  abnormal’ 
during the Main Period (see Clinical AR).  
The mean body weight loss was around 1 kg in the 3 treatment groups during the main study period. 
No significant mean weight loss was reported during the down-titration period. In total, 36 of the 1321 
subjects  (2.7%)  experienced  the  TEAE  of  “weight  decreased”  during  the  Main  Period,  with  incidence 
higher in 500 μg OD than either up-titration group (3.8% versus 2.3% and 2.1% of subjects in 250 μg 
OD/500 μg OD and 500 μg EOD/500 μg OD, respectively). A TEAE of weight loss was only reported in 
2 subjects during the Down Titration period (see Clinical AR). 
Safety in special populations 
Regarding  the  primary  endpoint,  premature  discontinuations  were  more  frequent  in  patients  >  65 
years  (23-27%  across  treatment  groups)  than  in  patients  <  65  years  (15-22%  across  treatment 
groups)  but  the  odds  ratio  of  discontinuations  favor  up-titration  group  1  versus  reference  both  in 
patients > 65 years (OR point estimate 0.70) and in patients < 65 years (Table 31). 
The same applies for the key secondary safety endpoint of rate of patients with AEs of interest, which 
is    more  frequent  in  patients  >  65  years  (48-56%  across  treatment  groups)  than  in  patients  <  65 
years (43-53% across treatment groups) but the odds ratio of discontinuations favor up-titration group 
1 versus reference both in patients > 65 years (47.7% vs 55.7%) and in patients < 65 years (43.4% 
vs. 52.7%) (Table 31).

Pregnancy 
There were no subjects with a positive pregnancy test throughout the duration of the study. 
Immunological events 
No specific section is dedicated to immunological events in the dossier. Anyway, looking at the TEAEs 
by SOC, either frequent or serious, there was no indication of immunological events with roflumilast in 
OPTIMIZE study beyond some mild skin reactions.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No  information  provided  initially.  During  the  procedure,  the  applicant  was  requested  to  show  the 
results  of  the  main  endpoint  and  key  secondary  safety  endpoint  by  subgroups  according  to 
concomitant medications (i.e.: concomitant ICS only, concomitant ICS+LABA, concomitant ICS+LAMA, 
concomitant  ICS+LABA+LAMA)  by  treatment  groups  and  to  discuss  whether  the  250/500  microgram 
up-titration  regime  could  provide  a  particular  advantage  in  patients  with  multiple  concomitant 
medications.  The  Applicant  submitted  the  requested  subgroup  analyses  by  concomitant  medication 
use.  The  analyses  were  hampered by  their  post-hoc  nature  and  lack  of  statistical  power  due to  small 
sample sizes. Anyway, the analysis provided justify for all of the subgroups studied to take advantage 
of  the  250  µg  OD/500 µg  OD  up-titration  regimen,  regardless  of  concomitant  LAMA  or  multiple 
concomitant medication use. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
This was an important component of the main endpoint (all withdrawals) in OPTIMIZE. Please see the 
outcomes estimation in the efficacy section. 
2.9.5.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The comparative results of the main and key secondary (safety) study endpoints (rate of withdrawals 
and  TEAEs  of  interest  have  already  been  described  in  the  efficacy  section.  The  following  sections  will 
focus  on  the  description  of  patient  exposures,  adverse  events,  laboratory  findings,  safety  in  special 
populations, safety related to drug-drug interactions and post-marketing experience. 
The  roflumilast  up-titration  groups  (250  μg  OD/500  μg  OD  and  500  μg  EOD/  500  μg  OD)  tended  to 
have a greater number of subjects (378 and 375 subjects; 85.7 and 85.8%, respectively) who received 
treatment  for  >8  weeks  compared  with  the  standard  treatment  group  (355  of  443;  80.1%).  The 
roflumilast  500  μg  OD  treatment  group  tended  to  have  a  greater  number  of  subjects  (72  of  443 
subjects,  16.3%)  who  received  treatment  for  ≤4  weeks  compared  with  the  up-titration  treatment 
groups  (7.9%  and  9.6%,  respectively).  This  is  consistent  with  the  results  of  the  primary  endpoint, 
showing  less  early  withdrawals  with  the  250  μg  OD/500  μg  OD  dosing  regimen  than  with  the  other 
dosage schedules.  
Most patients (63.7%) experienced TEAEs during treatment with roflumilast (61.2% in group 1, 64.3% 
in group 2 and 65.7% in control group). Most frequent TEAEs were gastrointestinal (diarrhoea, nausea, 
abdominal  pain)  (occurring  in  37.9%  of  patients  overall)  (34.9%  in  group  1,  35.9%  in  group  2  and 
42.9%  in  control  group).  SAES  were  reported  in  4.6%  of  subjects.  Only  0,2%  of  patients  had  a  SAE 
related to study medication (1 patient in each group).  
Overall, 145 subjects (32.9%), 159 subjects (36.4%), and 177 subjects (40.0%) receiving roflumilast 
250 μg OD/500 μg OD, 500 μg EOD 500 μg OD, and 500 μg OD, respectively, experienced a TEAE that 
was  investigator-assessed  as  related  to  roflumilast.  The  most  frequent  treatment-related  TEAEs  were 
in  the  SOCs  Gastrointestinal  disorders  (diarrhoea  17.6%,  nausea  13.5%,  abdominal  pain  11.6%), 
Metabolism  and  nutrition  disorders  (decreased  appetite  15.1%),  Psychiatric  disorders  (insomnia, 
12.1%)  and  Nervous  system  disorders  (headache  10.7%,  dizziness  2.1%).  The  benefit  of  the 
roflumilast  250  μg  OD/500  μg  OD  up-titration  regime  versus  the  standard  roflumilast  500  μg  OD

regime was largely driven by less related TEAEs of diarrhoea (13.8% vs. 21.7%; -7.9% difference) and 
nausea (11.3% vs. 16.3%; -5% difference). 
Seven  subjects  died  over  the  duration  of  this  study.  Of  the  7  deaths,  6  subjects  (of  a  total  of  1321 
subjects,  0.5%)  died  in  the  Main  Period.  The  remaining  death  (Subject  6164/004  in  treatment  group 
250 μg OD/ 500 μg OD) occurred ≥30 days after the last dose of study medication. None of the SAEs 
leading to death were investigator-assessed as related to study treatment. 
In  total,  61  of  1321  subjects  (4.6%)  experienced  81  SAEs,  including  19  (4.3%),  22  (5.0%),  and  20 
(4.5%)  subjects  in  the  roflumilast  250  μg  OD/500  μg  OD  (24  SAEs),  500  μg  EOD/500  μg  OD  (30 
SAEs), and 500 μg OD (27 SAEs) treatment groups, respectively. Most SAES were related to worsening 
COPD. No safety signal is apparent from these data.  
There  were  no  clinically  relevant  changes  in  mean  or  median  serum  chemistry  or  hematology  values 
from V1 at Vend for any treatment group during the Main Period, or from V1 or V0DT to VendDT in the 
Down  Titration  Period.  No  more  than  2.2%  of  subjects  in  any  treatment  group  had  serum  chemistry 
values  that  met  criteria  for  ‘markedly  abnormal’  during  the  Main  Period  and  no  more  than  2%  of 
subjects  in  any  treatment  group  had  hematology  values  that  met  criteria  for  ‘markedly  abnormal’ 
during the Main Period.  
The mean body weight loss was around 1 kg in the 3 treatment groups during the main study period. 
No significant mean weight loss was reported during the down-titration period. In total, 36 of the 1321 
subjects  (2.7%)  experienced  the  TEAE  of  “weight  decreased”  during  the  Main  Period,  with  incidence 
higher in 500 μg OD than either up-titration group (3.8% versus 2.3% and 2.1% of subjects in 250 μg 
OD/500 μg OD and 500 μg EOD/500 μg OD, respectively). A TEAE of weight loss was only reported in 
2  subjects  during  the  Down  Titration  period.The  dossier  has  no  dedicated  section  to  safety  in  special 
populations  or  in  the  elderly.  The  only  data  available  is  about  primary  and  key  secondary  analysis  of 
safety  by  age  group  in  the  subgroup  analysis  of  the  main  endpoint  (withdrawals  in  patients  >  65 
years)  and  in  some  tables  in  the  appendixes.  Looking  at  subgroups  of  primary  and  key  secondary 
endpoint,  premature  discontinuations  were  more  frequent  in  patients  >  65  years  (23-27%  across 
treatment groups) than in patients < 65 years (15-22% across treatment groups), but the odds ratio 
of  discontinuations  favoured  up-titration  group  1  versus  reference  both  in  patients  >  65  years  (OR 
point  estimate  0.70)  and  in  patients  <  65  years  (Table  31).  The  same  applies  for  the  key  secondary 
safety endpoint of rate of patients with AEs of interest, which tended to be more frequent in patients > 
65  years  (48-56%  across  treatment  groups)  than  in  patients  <  65  years  (43-53%  across  treatment 
groups), but consistently less frequent in the up-titration group 1 versus reference both in patients > 
65  years  (47.7%  vs.  55.7%)  and  in  patients  <  65  years  (43.4%  vs.  52.7%)  (Table  31).  During  the 
procedure, the applicant wa also invited to discuss about the apparent under-representation of elderly 
patients  in  the  pivotal  OPTIMIZE  study,  particularly  taking  into  account  that  they  are  a  special 
population  at  the  highest  risk  of  having  a  primary  outcome  study  event  (i.e.:  withdrawal  due  to 
intolerability).  The  applicant  clarified that  only  115 patients  were between  75  to  84  years  and  only  2 
patients were >85 years old. With the limitations of small sample sizes, the data showed some small 
increases in adverse events with age with all dosing regimes, but the benefit of the new dosing regime 
in  avoiding  adverse  events  and  discontinuations  was  consistently  in  favour  of  the  new  roflumilast 
regime regardless of age. 
No specific section is dedicated to immunological events in the dossier. Anyway, looking at the TEAEs 
by SOC, either frequent or serious, there was no indication of immunological events with roflumilast in 
OPTIMIZE study beyond some mild skin reactions.

With  respect  to  safety  related  to  drug-drug  interactions,  the  company  is  also  requested  to  show  the 
results  of  the  main  endpoint  and  key  secondary  safety  endpoint  by  subgroups  according  to 
concomitant medications (i.e.: concomitant ICS only, concomitant ICS+LABA, concomitant ICS+LAMA, 
concomitant  ICS+LABA+LAMA)  by  treatment  groups  and  to  discuss  whether  the  250/500  microgram 
up-titration  regime  could  provide  a  particular  advantage  in  patients  with  multiple  concomitant 
medications.  This  analysis  is  of  special  interest,  as  a  higher  incidence  in  weight  decrease,  decreased 
appetite,  headache  and  depression  has  been  reported  with  roflumilast  in  patients  receiving 
concomitant LAMA as compared to those not receiving LAMA (REACT study data already included in the 
SmPC) (see also efficacy section). 
During the procedure, the applicant was invited to comment on the potential benefit of recommending 
the  administration  of  roflumilast  with  food  in  reducing  gastrointestinal  intolerability.  The  applicant 
answered  that  clinical  data  available  with  roflumilast  does  not  indicate  a  protective  effect  of  meal  on 
gastrointestinal  adverse  effects  or  other  intolerability  symptoms.  Therefore,  it  is  endorsed  that  a 
specific recommendation to take roflumilast with food is not needed.  
The cumulative clinical trial exposure to roflumilast in the COPD program, asthma program and other 
indications (tablet and cream formulations) is 17396 patients, as of 5 January 2017. Cumulative post-
marketing exposure to roflumilast globally since first marketing launch in 2010 has been estimated to 
be over 804,498 patient-years, with the majority of exposure occurring in North America and Europe. 
Post-marketing  surveillance  data  with  roflumilast  at  the  time  of  this  submission  shows  that  the  AE 
pattern  in  post-marketing  surveillance  reports  does  not  deviate  from  the  experience  from  clinical 
studies.  The  most  frequently  reported  ADRs  from  roflumilast  post-marketing  reports  are  well-known 
reactions  associated  with  PDE-4  inhibitors  (i.e.:  gastrointestinal  adverse  reactions,  insomnia, 
decreased  appetite)  and/or  are  expected  events  for  this  patient  population,  clinical  manifestations  of 
the  underlying  disease  and  its  progression.  Weight  decrease,  psychiatric  disorders  including  suicide 
risk, and angioedema as important identified risks, and cardiac safety, malignancy and infection risks 
to be clinically important potential risks for roflumilast. No new safety data have been received during 
the latest post-marketing safety reporting period to alter the current understanding and assessment of 
these safety risks. 
2.9.6.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The analysis of safety data from OPTIMIZE study does not raise any new concern about the safety of 
roflumilast.  Most  patients  (63.7%)  experienced  TEAEs  during  treatment  with  roflumilast  (61.2%  in 
group  1,  64.3%  in  group  2  and  65.7%  in  control  group),  with  most  frequent  TEAEs  being 
gastrointestinal (diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain) (occurring in 37.9% of patients overall) (34.9% in 
group 1, 35.9% in group 2 and 42.9% in control group). SAES were reported in 4.6% of subjects. Only 
0,2%  of  patients  had  a  SAE  related  to  study  medication  (1  patient  in  each  group).  These  data  are 
consistent with the known safety profile of roflumilast. 
The  analysis  of  TEAEs  related  to  study  drug  indicated  a  safety  advantage  of  the  roflumilast  250  μg 
OD/500  μg  OD  up-titration  regime  versus  the  standard  roflumilast  500  μg  OD  regime,  which  was 
largely  driven  by  less  related  TEAEs  of  diarrhoea  (13.8%  vs.  21.7%;  -7.9%  difference)  and  nausea 
(11.3% vs. 16.3%; -5% difference). 
The summary of safety concerns after the addition of the 250 microg dose remain the same as for the 
500 microgram dose, which is endorsed, because no new safety concerns related to new or increased 
adverse reactions are expected with the use of a lower roflumilast dose. However, with respect to the 
Assessment report  
EMA/154975/2018  
Page 75/94 
 
 
 
 
 
safety  specification,  the  main  concern  due  to  the  availability  of  the  new  (ineffective)  250  microgram 
dose, is the potential for off-label use with respect to the maintenance dose. 
On  the  one  hand,  the  information  included  in  the  RMP  provides  evidence  that  up-titration  has  been 
done  off-label  since  the  approval  of  roflumilast  500  microgr  with  the  use  every  second  day  or  half  a 
tablet  each  day.  Therefore,  current  line  extension  is  expected  to  put  in  the  SmPC  a  practice  already 
extended among prescribers, but now with evidence from a randomized trial. The product information 
was  ammended  during  the  procedure  to  reinforce  the  message  that  the  250  micrograms  dose  is 
subtherapeutic and should not be used for maintenance treatment.

occurred more frequently in patients treated 
with Daxas/Daliresp/Libertek compared to 
placebo-treated patients. After discontinuation 
of Daxas/Daliresp/Libertek, the majority of 
patients had regained body weight after 
3 months.  
Body weight of underweight patients should be 
checked at each visit. Patients should be 
advised to check their body weight on a 
regular basis. In the event of an unexplained

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context  
Place of roflumilast in therapy 
Roflumilast is a selective phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) inhibitor. PDE4 is an important regulator of 
cyclic  AMP  in  most  cell  types  involved  in  inflammatory  processes.  Inhibition  of  PDE4  reduces  the 
breakdown  of  cAMP,  which  in  turn  down-regulates  the  inflammatory  process.  It  has  a  mechanism  of 
action  that  is  complimentary  to  the  anti-inflammatory  effect  of  ICS  and  the  bronchodilatory  effect  of 
LABA and LAMA, which are the standard of care in patients with severe COPD at risk of exacerbations. 
Exacerbations  of  COPD  are  worsenings  of  the  patient’s  respiratory  symptoms  beyond  normal  day-to-
day variation that lead to changes in medication, and possibly, hospitalization and death. 
Assessment report

Current GOLD guidelines recommend adding roflumilast to treatment regimens for patients in Group D 
who have chronic bronchitis and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) <50% of predicted 
whose exacerbations are not adequately controlled on a triple combination of a long-acting β2-
adrenergic agonist (LABA), a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), and inhaled corticosteroid 
(ICS). The indication for roflumilast in clinical practice is therefore for patients with GOLD spirometric 
grade 3-4 and group D. 
Roflumilast was approved for use in 2010. During clinical studies, the rate of discontinuations with 
roflumilast in pivotal studies was quite high, around 30%, with withdrawals due to intolerability 
accounting for the majority of discontinuations (Daxas EPAR, 2010). As follow-up measure (FUM004), 
the MAH was encouraged to present a program exploring the feasibility of developing alternative doses 
to minimize the risk of drug interactions and poor tolerability. This line extension application is the 
result of studies aimed to address this issue. 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Roflumilast, at a 500 microgram once-daily dose, is authorised in the EU since 05-Jul-2010 for 
maintenance treatment of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (FEV1 
post-bronchodilator less than 50% predicted) associated with chronic bronchitis in adult patients with a 
history of frequent exacerbations as add on to bronchodilator treatment. 
COPD is the fourth leading cause of death in Europe, and is a major public health problem. COPD is 
generally but not exclusively associated with tobacco smoking. Tobacco smoke is considered the most 
important risk factor for COPD worldwide. Prevalence and morbidity data greatly underestimate the 
total burden of COPD because the disease is usually not diagnosed until it is clinically apparent and 
moderately advanced.  
COPD comprises pathological changes in four different compartments of the lungs (central airways, 
peripheral airways, lung parenchyma, pulmonary vasculature), which, in turn, give rise to the 
physiological abnormalities in COPD: mucous hypersecretion and cilliary dysfunction, airflow limitation 
and hyperinflation, gas exchange abnormalities, pulmonary hypertension, and systemic effects. 
The most widely accepted classification of the severity of COPD is according to The Global Initiative for 
Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) (GOLD 2017 Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management 
and Prevention of COPD; Available from: http://goldcopd.org/gold-2017-global-strategy-diagnosis-
management-prevention-copd/). It includes a spirometric and symptoms classification.  
The GOLD classification of airflow limitation severity (spirometric classification) recognizes four grades 
(1: mild; 2: moderate; 3: severe; 4: very severe), being categories 3-4 those corresponding to severe 
(FEV1 ≤ 50% predicted) and very severe (FEV1 ≤ 30% predicted) airflow limitation, respectively.  
It should be noted that there is only a weak correlation between FEV1, symptoms and impairment of a 
patient’s health status. For this reason, formal symptomatic assessment is also required. 
Current GOLD guidelines recommend the symptomatic classification of COPD patients regarding 
symptoms and risk of exacerbations using the “ABCD” assessment tool. Group D are patients with 
more symptoms at high risk of exacerbations. The prognosis of COPD is poorer in patients with 
severe/very severe airflow limitation and it is correlated with the degree of dyspnoea (GOLD 2017). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The  most  important  aspect  of  management  of  the  condition  is  educational  and  social:  the  avoidance 
and cessation of tobacco smoking. The medications for COPD currently available can reduce or abolish 
symptoms, increase exercise capacity, reduce the number and severity of exacerbations, and improve 
health  status.  At  present  no  treatment  is  shown  to  modify  the  rate  of  decline  in  lung  function. 
Combining different agents produces a greater change in spirometry and symptoms than single agents 
alone.

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This submission is based on data from a single study (Study RO 2455 302-RD [OPTIMIZE]) conducted 
to fulfill a Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) post-authorization measure 
(FUM004) to explore alternative doses of roflumilast to minimize the risk of poor tolerability, and to 
explore the influence of factors such as gender, age, and smoking status on the bioavailability of the 
product in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  
OPTIMIZE was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 3-arm, parallel group, phase 3 study with an 
open-label Down-Titration Period for subjects who withdrew from the Main Period of the study. During 
the Main Period, subjects were randomized receive 1 of the 3 treatments consisting of 2 up-titration 
treatment groups: 250 μg OD or 500 μg EOD for the first 4 weeks followed by 500 μg OD for 8 weeks, 
and the currently approved roflumilast regimen of 500 μg OD administered for 12 weeks. All subjects 
discontinuing from the Main Period were permitted to enter an 8-week open-label Down-Titration 
Period where they received roflumilast 250 μg OD.  
Inclusion and exclusion criteria in OPTIMIZE study were in line with the indication (severe COPD and a 
history of exacerbations) and contraindications/non-recommendation of use detailed in the Daxas 
SmPC. Study medications included  roflumilast 250 μg tablet, 500 μg tablet and placebo of identical 
appearance. Placebo was used only during the 4-week up-titration period (the only phase that was 
double-blinded) (the 8 week continuation after initial 4-week up-titration was single blinded, as 
investigators knew that all patients were receiving the roflumilast 500 μg tablet, although they were 
unaware of the type of initial 4-week treatment that patients had received). 
Primary Endpoint was the percentage of subjects prematurely discontinuing study treatment due to 
any reason during Main Period. Key Secondary Endpoints included the percentage of subjects with 
adverse events (AEs) of interest to evaluate tolerability during Main Period,  the change in pre-
bronchodilator (pre-BD) FEV 1 during Down-Titration Period (V0DT to VendDT) and the percentage of 
subjects prematurely discontinuing study treatment due to any reason during Down-Titration Period 
(V0DT to VendDT). Other secondary endpoints were:  change in pre-BD FEV1 during Main Period of the 
study, change in pre-BD FVC during Main Period and also including Down-Titration Period; change in 
subject-assessed treatment satisfaction scores during Main Period of the study and also including 
Down-Titration Period. 
Study methods were appropriate, and one study site was closed due to GCP non compliance issues.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Compared with roflumilast 500 μg OD [H01] the odds of discontinuing the Main Period using a logistic 
regression model were statistically significantly lower in the roflumilast 250 μg OD/500 μg OD 
treatment group at the 5% significance level (24.6% vs. 18.4% of subjects, OR=0.66, 95% CI: 0.47, 
0.93; p-value 0.017, primary endpoint). At the 5% significance level, there was no statistically 
significant difference between roflumilast 500 μg OD and roflumilast 500 μg EOD/500 μg OD treatment 
groups [H02] (OR 0.76, 95% CI: 0.55, 1.07; p-value 0.114). Supportive analysis Cox proportional 
hazards model found a similar result for roflumilast 250 μg OD/500 μg OD (HR=0.68, 95 % CI: 0.51, 
0.92) and roflumilast 500 μg EOD/500 μg OD (HR=0.77, 95% CI: 0.58, 1.02) versus roflumilast 500 
μg OD. A per-protocol analysis also supported the robustness of the results on the primary study 
endpoint. 
The results of the main endpoint based on the logistic regression model with region as a covariate, 
instead of country, were consistent with the primary analysis results. Compared with roflumilast 500 
μg OD [H01The odds of discontinuing from the Main Period were lower in the roflumilast 250 μg 
OD/500 μg OD treatment group (OR=0.70, 95% CI: 0.50, 0.97; p-value 0.032). The results of the 
sensitivity analyses by excluding the South African site  for the primary endpoint supported the results 
of the primary analysis also yielded significant differences (OR=0.66, 95% CI: 0.47, 0.93; p-value 
0.017). Most subgroups trended towards favouring the 250/500 microg OD up-titration regimen.

The analysis of TEAEs of Interest during the Main Period (Key Secondary Safety Endpoint) was entirely 
consistent with those of the primary endpoint. Compared with roflumilast 500 μg OD, the odds of 
experiencing a ‘TEAE of interest’ was significantly lower in the roflumilast 250 μg OD/500 μg OD 
treatment group (54.2% versus 45.4% of subjects, OR=0.63, 95% CI: 0.47, 0.83; p-value = 0.001). 
This difference was not observed between roflumilast 500 μg EOD/500 μg OD (48.3% of subjects) and 
the roflumilast 500 μg OD (54.2%) treatment groups in the analysis of AEs of interest.  
During the main treatment period  (D0-D84Vend), all the 3 treatment groups experienced statistically 
significant and relevant absolute mean improvements in pre-BD FEV1 versus baseline (group 1: +117 
ml; group 2: +141 ml; group 3, control = +122 ml), having in mind that they were patients who had a 
baseline pre-BD FEV1 around 1018 ml to 1028 ml (≈10% relative increase.  There were no statistically 
significant differences for the change in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 from baseline to end of treatment 
visit, between roflumilast 250 μg OD/500 μg OD versus roflumilast 500 μg OD (LS mean for treatment 
difference 0.02 L, 95% CI: -0.17, 0.20; p=0.871) or roflumilast 250 μg EOD/500 μg OD  versus 
roflumilast 500 μg OD-group 3 (LS mean for treatment difference 0.13 L, 95% CI: -0.05, 0.32; 
p=0.162), thus suggesting that all treatment approaches had similar efficacy. Per-protocol analysis 
based on the VCS also found similar results. 
There were numerically more patients in up-titration group that are very satisfied or satisfied (89.1%) 
than in the control group (85.7%). On the contrary, there were more patients dissatisfied in the 
control group (7.5%) than in the up-titration group 1 (3.7%). Therefore, it seems that patient's 
satisfaction tended to be improved with the up-titration regime than with the standard regime, and this 
is consistent with the primary endpoint of treatment withdrawals and the key secondary endpoint of 
AEs of interest (less risk of diarrhoea, insomnia, nausea). Patient's satisfaction with up-titration 
probably reflects a better tolerability (less adverse events with the 250 micrograms to 500 micrograms 
up-titration) at similar efficacy in terms of lung function improvement (i.e.: similar improvement in 
pre-BD FEV1 regardless of dosing schedule, close to +100 ml). However, no definitive conclusions can 
be drawn due to the exploratory nature of the analysis. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
About 67% of patients was receiving a dual ICS+LABA combination during the main period, and 63% 
of patients were receiving a LAMA. However, no data about the aggregated number of patients 
receiving the ICS+LAMA combination or ICS+LABA+LAMA combination were reported initially. 
Submitted subgroup analyses by concomitant medication use submitted during the procedure were 
hampered by its post-hoc nature and lack of statistical power due to small sample sizes. Anyway, the 
analysis provided justify for all of the subgroups studied to take advantage of the 250 µg OD/500 µg 
OD up-titration regimen, regardless of concomitant LAMA or multiple concomitant medication use. In 
addition, patients on polypharmacy (on ≥4 concomitant medications) had a small increase 
(approximately 10%) in the predicted tPDE4i and could not explain the observed increase in number of 
AEs of interest for these patients. Therefore, no conclusion can be drawn on higher benefit of the new 
roflumilast dosing regime  in patients on polypharmacy. 
Strictly speaking, the single pivotal trial supporting this application does not fulfill with the level of 
statistical significance (considerably stronger than <0.05) normally required for application based on a 
single pivotal trial (Points to consider on application with 1. meta-analyses; 2. one pivotal study; 
CHMP/EWP/2330/99). However, on the one hand, the results on the primary safety endpoint were 
quite robust, with all sensitivity and ancillary analyses of the main endpoint showing a benefit, and 
with key secondary endpoint showing also a benefit in safety (e.g.: significant lower rates of TEAEs of 
interest) and patient's satisfaction, with no detrimental effect on efficacy (pre-BD FEV1). On the other 
hand, the line extension is restricted to improve the initial tolerability and decrease early withdrawal 
rates with treatment by starting with a lower dose.

EMA/154975/2018  
Page 88/94 
 
 
 
 
 
There are no data to ascertain whether the benefit shown at 3 months will be sustained in the long 
term. Even if the effect is sustained overtime, and while recognizing that a streamlined posology aimed 
to minimize adverse events and treatment discontinuations is a positive goal. It is agreed with the 
applicant that a 6.2% reduction of discontinuations in the current population treated with roflumilast 
would translate into a 12.9% reduction in exacerbations during the first year. According to market 
share of roflumilast in different regions, this would translate in the prevention of additional 340 
exacerbations in Europe and 1031 exacerbations globally, compared with starting with the 500 microg 
dose. This benefit is added to the adverse events prevented (mainly gastrointestinal). 
Although most subgroups trended towards favouring the 250/500 microg OD up-titration regimen, 
there were two exceptions (i.e.: non-European region and Asian race in the comparison versus 
roflumilast 500 μg OD). Asian patients tend to have a lower body weight than patients from Western 
countries.  Asian race was not a significant covariate in population PK analysis, whereas in subgroup 
analyses of pivotal studies, the effect of roflumilast versus placebo on the rate of moderate or severe 
exacerbations showed no heterogeneity depending on race.  Results from the new population PK model 
on the combined REACT and OPTIMIZE dataset identified no clinically relevant changes of systemic 
exposure levels in other populations of particular interest (eg, elderly patients, current smokers, 
female patients, or patients with high [>80 kg] or low [<60 kg] baseline body weight). Therefore, the 
approved maintenance dose of roflumilast 500 μg OD does not need to be adjusted in these 
populations. 
Elderly patients seem under-represented in the OPTIMIZE study, and they are a special population at 
risk of adverse events and withdrawals. The applicant clarified that only 115 patients were between 75 
to 84 years and only 2 patients were >85 years old. With the limitations of small sample sizes, the 
subgroup analyses by age showed some small increases in adverse events with age with all dosing 
regimes, but the benefit of the new dosing regime in avoiding adverse events and discontinuations was 
consistently in favour of the new roflumilast regime regardless of age. 
The analysis of main interest for the down-titration phase was for those patients who did not tolerate 
roflumilast 500 μg OD during the Main Period and subsequently entered the down-Titration period 
(n=80), in order to ascertain whether a the 250 microgram dose, administered to all of them, could be 
effective (i.e.: whether it could produce improvements in pre-BD FEV1 from the start of down-titration 
to end of down-titration). Eighty subjects (of 1321 subjects, 6.0%) who did not tolerate roflumilast 
500 μg OD in the Main Period were treated with roflumilast 250 μg OD for 8 weeks (n=20 for the 
roflumilast 250 μg OD/500 μg OD group, n=22 for roflumilast 500 μg EOD/500 μg OD group, and 
n=38 for the roflumilast 500 μg OD group at Baseline, V0DT). The analyses indicated no effect of the 
250 microgram low-dose roflumilast in pre-BD FEV1. The lack of effect on pre-BD FEV1 of a lower 
roflumilast maintenance dose was consistent in the per-protocol analysis based on the VCS and in 
several sensitivity analyses. Product information was ammended to reinforce the message that the 250 
micrograms dose is subtherapeutic and should not be used for maintenance treatment. 
The results of the statistical analysis of TEAEs of Interest (diarrhea, nausea, headache, reduced 
appetite, insomnia, or abdominal pain) during the Main Period are supportive and consistent with the 
results on the main study endpoint. However, they are considered exploratory based on insufficient 
evidence to reject the null hypothesis for the primary endpoint at the 5% significance level [H02] in 
the framework of hierarchical testing (i.e.: no statistically significant differences were found for the 
comparison between groups 2 and 3 for the primary endpoint of premature discontinuations).  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The analysis of safety data from OPTIMIZE study does not raise any new concern about the safety of 
roflumilast. Most patients (63.7%) experienced TEAEs during treatment with roflumilast (61.2% in 
group 1, 64.3% in group 2 and 65.7% in control group), with most frequent TEAEs being 
gastrointestinal (diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain) (occurring in 37.9% of patients overall) (34.9% in 
group 1, 35.9% in group 2 and 42.9% in control group). SAES were reported in 4.6% of subjects. Only 
Assessment report  
EMA/154975/2018  
Page 89/94 
 
 
 
 
 
0,2% of patients had a SAE related to study medication (1 patient in each group). These data are 
consistent with the known safety profile of roflumilast.  
The analysis of TEAEs related to study drug indicated a safety advantage of the roflumilast 250 μg 
OD/500 μg OD up-titration regime versus the standard roflumilast 500 μg OD regime, which was 
largely driven by less related TEAEs of diarrhoea (13.8% vs. 21.7%; -7.9% difference) and nausea 
(11.3% vs. 16.3%; -5% difference). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Although the OPTIMIZE study showed a benefit of the roflumilast 250 μg OD/500 μg OD up-titration 
regime versus the standard roflumilast 500 μg OD regimen, it was based on the assessment at 3 
months.  The first 4 weeks of treatment represents the dosing period most relevant to the aims of the 
study (i.e., to improve tolerability of roflumilast through use of alternative dosing regimens).  After this 
time, there is no evidence to support a need for further improvements, as the frequency of AEs with 
roflumilast is not higher than with placebo, and the rate of withdrawals from study treatment are low. 
The 250 micrograms dose is subtherapeutic and should not be used for maintenance treatment.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Adherence to COPD medications is a key goal in the management of COPD, as it is associated with 
reduced risk of death and admission to hospital due to COPD exacerbations [Vestbo et al. Thorax. 
2009;64:939-43]. Therefore, any measure to improve adherence to roflumilast is welcomed to 
minimize the high withdrawal rates, about 30%, found in pivotal studies with roflumilast (Daxas EPAR, 
2010).  
The OPTIMIZE pivotal study was designed to answer that question. The study showed a better 
adherence (less early withdrawals: 18.4% vs. 24.6%; Diff: -6.2%) with the roflumilast 250 μg OD/500 
μg OD up-titration regime versus the standard roflumilast 500 μg OD regimen. The results were further 
supported by a lower risk of TEAEs of interest (45.4% vs. 54.2: Diff.: -8.8%) and trend towards a 
better patients' satisfaction with treatment, probably related to a better tolerability. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The analysis of TEAEs related to study drug indicated a safety advantage of the roflumilast 250 μg 
OD/500 μg OD up-titration regime versus the standard roflumilast 500 μg OD regime, which was 
largely driven by less related TEAEs of diarrhoea (13.8% vs. 21.7%; -7.9% difference) and nausea 
(11.3% vs. 16.3%; -5% difference). The positive effect is further supported by sensitivity analyses of 
the main endpoint as well as for the results of secondary endpoints of TEAEs of interest and patient-
reported outcomes. 
The analysis of safety data from OPTIMIZE study does not raise any new concern about the safety of 
roflumilast. Most patients (63.7%) experienced TEAEs during treatment with roflumilast (61.2% in 
group 1, 64.3% in group 2 and 65.7% in control group), with most frequent TEAEs being 
gastrointestinal (diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain) (occurring in 37.9% of patients overall) (34.9% in 
group 1, 35.9% in group 2 and 42.9% in control group). SAES were reported in 4.6% of subjects. 
These data are consistent with the known safety profile of roflumilast.  
Finally, there is a risk of off-label use with the roflumilast 250 microgram as maintenance dose. The 
250 micrograms dose is sub-therapeutic and should not be used for maintenance treatment. This has 
been adequately mentioned in section 4.2 of the SmPC.

3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance  
Although  the  OPTIMIZE  study  showed  a  benefit  of  the  roflumilast  250  μg  OD/500  μg  OD  up-titration 
regime  versus  the  standard  roflumilast  500  μg  OD  regime  for  withdrawals  and  TEAEs  of  interest,  the 
study does not provide data beyond 3 months.   In roflumilast clinical trials, Kaplan-Meier plots of time 
to  onset  of  AEs  show  that  the  majority  of  events  in  the  roflumilast  treated-patients  occur  early,  and 
that there is a plateau after 4 weeks. Therefore, the first 4 weeks of treatment represents the dosing 
period most relevant to the aims of the study (i.e., to improve tolerability of roflumilast through use of 
alternative  dosing  regimens).    After  this  time,  there  is  no  evidence  to  support  a  need  for  further 
improvements, as the frequency of AEs with roflumilast is not higher than with placebo, and the rate of 
withdrawals  from  study  treatment  are  low.  With  a  6.2%  reduction  of  discontinuations  in  the  current 
population treated with roflumilast would translate into a 12.9% reduction in exacerbations during the 
first  year.  According  to  market  share  of  roflumilast  in  different  regions,  this  would  translate  in  the 
prevention of additional 340 exacerbations in Europe and 1031 exacerbations globally, compared with 
starting with the 500 microg dose. This benefit is added to the adverse events (mainly gastrointestinal) 
prevented. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Daxas is positive for the lower strength 250 μg in the currently approved indication. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality  and  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considers  by 
consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Daxas 250 μg, is favourable in the following indication: 
Daxas is indicated for maintenance treatment of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
(FEV1 post-bronchodilator less than 50% predicted) associated with chronic bronchitis in adult patients 
with a history of frequent exacerbations as add on to bronchodilator treatment. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension of the marketing authorisation for Daxas subject to the 
following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The  requirements  for  submission  of  periodic  safety  update  reports  for  this  medicinal  product  are  set 
out  in  the  list  of  Union  reference  dates  (EURD  list)  provided  for  under  Article  107c(7)  of  Directive

medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder shall agree the content and format of the updated educational 
material with the national competent authority. 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) should ensure that all Healthcare Professionals who are 
expected to prescribe Daxas are provided with an updated Educational pack. 
The educational pack should contain the following: 
•  Summary of Product Characteristics and Patient Information Leaflet for Daxas 
•  Educational material for the physician. 
•  Copies of the patient card to be given to patients or caregivers before they receive Daxas 
The educational material for the prescriber should include information on the following key elements: 
  The specific indication approved.  
  The fact that Daxas is not indicated for the treatment of COPD patients outside of the approved 
indication, nor for use in patients with asthma or alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. 
  The need to inform patients about the risks of Daxas and the precautions for safe use 
including: 
  The risk of weight decrease in underweight patients and the need to monitor the body weight 
at each visit and to stop the treatment in the event of an unexplained and clinically concerning 
weight decrease. Patients should be advised to weigh themselves at regular intervals and 
record the weight in the patient card. 
  The risk of psychiatric disorders such as insomnia, anxiety, depression in patients receiving 
Daxas and the potential risk of suicide. Rare instances of suicidal ideation and behaviour, 
including completed suicide, have been observed in patients with and without a history of 
depression, usually in the first weeks of treatment. Physicians should carefully assess the 
benefit risk balance of this treatment in patients with existing psychiatric symptoms or with 
history of depression. Daxas is not recommended in patients with a history of depression 
associated with suicidal ideation or behaviour. If patients suffer from new or worsening 
psychiatric symptoms, or suicidal ideation or suicidal attempt, it is recommended to 
discontinue treatment with Daxas. 
  Patients and caregivers should be requested to report any changes in the patient`s behaviour 
or mood or suicidal ideation. 
  The potential risk of malignant tumours and the lack of experience in patients with past history 
of cancer. Daxas should not be initiated or should be stopped in patients with cancers (except 
basal cell carcinoma). 
  That increased exposure might occur in certain populations and increase the risk of persistent 
intolerability: 
o  Special populations who have increased PDE4 inhibition such as black non smoking 
females; 
o  Patients concomitantly treated with CYP1A2/2C19/3A4 inhibitors (such as fluvoxamine 
and cimetidine) or CYP1A2/3A4 inhibitors (such as enoxacin). 
  The potential risk of infections: Daxas should not be initiated, or treatment should be stopped, 
in patients with severe acute infectious diseases. The limited experience in patients with latent 
infections such as tuberculosis, viral hepatitis or herpes infections.

  The lack of experience in patients with HIV infection or active hepatitis, with severe 
immunological diseases (e.g. multiple sclerosis, lupus erythematosus, multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy) or treated with immunosuppressive therapy (other than short-term 
systemic corticosteroids) and that Daxas should not be initiated or should be stopped in these 
patients. 
  The potential cardiac risk: Daxas has not been studied in patients in congestive heart failure 
(NYHA grade 3 and 4); hence, it is not recommended in this population. 
  The limited or missing information in patients with liver impairment. Daxas is contraindicated 
in patients with moderate or severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh B or C). Clinical data are 
considered insufficient to recommend dose adjustment and caution should be observed in 
patients with mild liver impairment (Child-Pugh A).  
  The lack of clinical data to support the combination with theophylline and that such 
combination is not recommended. 
Patient Card 
The patient card should contain the following key elements: 
cancer 
insomnia, anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation or behaviour 
That they should tell their doctor if they have a history of any of the following conditions  
• 
• 
•  multiple sclerosis or SLE 
• 
infection with tuberculosis, herpes, hepatitis, HIV 
That patients or their caregivers should tell their doctor if the patient develops symptoms indicative of: 
• 
insomnia, anxiety, depression, changes in behaviour or mood, suicidal ideation or behaviour 
• 
severe infection 
That patients should tell their doctor if they are taking any other medicines. 
That Daxas may cause weight loss and patients should weigh themselves regularly and record their 
weight on the patient card. 
The patient card should include an area where patients can record their weight and the date they 
weighed themselves and they should be asked to bring the patient card with them at each visit. 
• 
Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures

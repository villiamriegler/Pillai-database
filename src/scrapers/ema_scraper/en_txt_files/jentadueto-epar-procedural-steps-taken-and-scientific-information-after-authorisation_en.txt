and section 5.1 of the Glyxambi SmPC, based on the final 
results from study 1218.74 (CAROLINA study). The double-
blind parallel group CAROLINA study evaluated the 
cardiovascular safety of linagliptin versus glimepiride as 
adjunct to standard care therapy in patients with type 2 
diabetes and with increased CV risk. A total of 6033 
patients were treated (linagliptin 5 mg: 3023, glimepiride 1 
mg to 4 mg: 3010) and followed for a median of 6.25 
years. The mean age was 64 years, the mean HbA1c was 
7.15 %, and 60 % were male. Approximately 19 % of the 
population had an eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2. The study 
was designed to demonstrate non-inferiority for the

Leaflet for Trajenta is updated accordingly. The RMP 
version 13.1 for Jentadueto and Trajenta and version 
5.1 for Glyxambi have also been submitted. In 
addition, the Worksharing applicant (WSA) took the 
opportunity to make corrections throughout the 
product information for Glyxambi and Jentadueto and 
to make corrections to the Bulgarian, French, 
Swedish translations for Glyxambi.

Please refer to the assessment report:  
726/2004, the European Commission requested on 
25 January 2016 the opinion of the European 
Medicines Agency on the adequacy of the current 
recommendations for metformin containing products 
with respect to the use in patients with moderate 
renal failure, taking into account the available 
information on the risk of lactic acidosis. The CHMP 
was requested to assess the impact thereof on the 
benefit-risk balance of metformin containing 
products and to give its recommendation whether 
the marketing authorisation of this product should be 
maintained, varied, suspended or revoked. 
The notification for the procedure is appended to this 
opinion.

Lactic acidosis is a very rare, but serious (high mortality in 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC in 
order to align the SmPC for Jentadueto and Synjardy 
to the safety information for the UK metformin label 
(Glucophage) with regard to tissue hypoxia, lactic 
acidosis, compromised cardiac or renal function and 
administration of iodinated contrast agents. In 
addition, the Worksharing applicant (WSA) took the 
opportunity to update the list of local representatives 
for Spain and Portugal in the Package Leaflet for 
Jentadueto and to bring the PI of Jentadueto in line 
with the latest QRD template version 9.1. The RMPs 
(version 3.0 for Synjardy and version 11.0 for 
Jentadueto) for both products have been updated 
according to the SmPC changes. 
II and PL 
the absence of prompt treatment), metabolic complication 
that can occur due to metformin accumulation. Reported 
cases of lactic acidosis in patients on metformin have 
occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal 
failure or acute worsening of renal function. Special caution 
should be paid to situations where renal function may 
become impaired, for example in case of dehydration 
(severe diarrhoea or vomiting), or when initiating 
antihypertensive therapy or diuretic therapy and when 
starting therapy with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drug (NSAID). In the acute conditions listed, metformin 
should be temporarily discontinued. 
The intravascular administration of iodinated contrast 
materials in radiologic studies can lead to renal failure. This 
may induce metformin accumulation and may increase the 
risk for lactic acidosis. Therefore, this medicinal product 
must be discontinued prior to, or at the time of the test and

not be reinstituted until at least 48 hours afterwards, and 
only after renal function has been re-evaluated and has not 
deteriorated further. 
Other associated risk factors should be considered to avoid 
lactic acidosis such as poorly controlled diabetes, ketosis, 
prolonged fasting, excessive alcohol intake, hepatic 
impairment and any condition associated with hypoxia 
(such as decompensated cardiac failure, acute myocardial 
infarction). 
Patients with heart failure are more at risk of hypoxia and 
renal insufficiency. In patients with stable chronic heart 
failure, the combination with metformin may be used with a 
regular monitoring of cardiac and renal function. For 
patients with acute and unstable heart failure, the 
combination is contraindicated due to the metformin 
component. 
The risk of lactic acidosis must be considered in the event 
of non-specific signs such as muscle cramps, digestive 
disorders as abdominal pain and severe asthenia. Patients 
should be instructed to notify these signs immediately to 
their physicians if they occur, notably if patients had a good 
tolerance to the combination including metformin before. 
The combination should be discontinued, at least 
temporarily, until the situation is clarified. Reintroduction of 
the combination should then be discussed taking into 
account the benefit/risk ratio in an individual basis as well 
as renal function. 
In case of lactic acidosis, the patient should be hospitalised 
immediately. Physicians should alert the patients on the 
risk and on the symptoms of lactic acidosis.

In this variation the MAH has provided an update of the 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC in order to update 
the information with the current data from the 
cardiovascular risk meta-analysis. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
prospective CV meta-analysis. A first analysis of this study 
was submitted with the MAA. Additionally an updated 
summary was performed in 2011 to support the types II 
variation for the add-on to insulin indication 
(EMEA/H/C/002110/II/0004/G).  
Compared to earlier analyses no significant changes have 
been observed.  
In total there were 60 primary events on linagliptin and 62 
on comparators. The overall CV risk ratio was not

significantly reduced for linagliptin versus combined 
comparators.  No difference in CV risk for linagliptin was 
observed versus placebo in the placebo-controlled trials 
only. The secondary and tertiary composite CV endpoints 
also do not show an increased risk for linagliptin as 
compared with combined comparators. 
Section 5.1 of the SmPC has been updated to reflect this 
new data.

Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC in order to include 
the new adverse reaction “rash” following a CHMP 
request after the evaluation of the latest PSUR. The 
Package Leaflet was updated accordingly. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to 
implement minor typographical corrections in the 
SmPC. 
Furthermore, Annex II was updated to reflect the 
latest version of the QRD template. 
C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested

MAH 
II and PL 
the CHMP requested that, considering the reported de- and 
re-challenge cases, “rash” should be clearly included as a 
new adverse reaction in the product information. 
The MAH has complied with the mentioned CHMP request. 
Based on the incidence of “rash” in clinical trials (0.4%), 
frequency uncommon was proposed to be assigned, and 
the CHMP considered it to be acceptable. 
Furthermore, the MAH proposals to:  
-  
change of the frequency of “hypersensitivity” from 
uncommon to rare and 
- 
      addition of “urticaria” and “angioedema” to the 
SOC “Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders” with the 
frequency rare. For these ADRs an asterix is used to 
indicate that these events were derived from post-
marketing experience; 
were in line with the conclusions of PSUR-2 and therefore 
were considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
The other proposed changes and corrections to the SmPC 
and PL were accepted. 
Based on the information presented by the MAH to support 
this variation, there is no impact on the overall benefit/risk

1.  Scientific discussion  
1.1.  Introduction 
Schizoaffective disorder is a common, chronic, and disabling mental illness. Schizoaffective disorder as 
defined  using  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders,  Fourth  Edition  (DSM-IV)  criteria 
has  features  of  both  schizophrenia—including  2  or  more  of  the  following  symptoms:  hallucinations, 
delusions,  disorganized  speech,  grossly  disorganized  or  catatonic  behaviour,  or  negative  symptoms—
and prominent affective symptoms consistent with major depression or mania1. According to DSM-IV, a 
diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder is made when the symptom criteria for schizophrenia are met and 
during  the  same  continuous  period  there  is  a  major  depressive  episode,  manic  episode,  or  mixed 
episode. During that same period, hallucinations or delusions must be present for at least 2 weeks in 
the absence of prominent mood symptoms. 
Schizoaffective  disorder  includes  all  the  signs  and  symptoms  of  a  manic  episode  and/or  a  major 
depressive  episode,  in  addition  to  the  presence  of  symptoms  consistent  with  schizophrenia. 
Nevertheless,  the  clinical  features  of  schizoaffective  disorder  differ  from  bipolar  disorder  and 
schizophrenia  in  important  ways,  including  prognosis  and  approaches  to  treatment.  The  course  of 
schizoaffective  disorder  is  ill  defined,  with  overall  prognosis  appearing  to  be  intermediate  to  that  of 
schizophrenia and affective disorders2. 
The  lifetime  prevalence  of  schizoaffective  disorder  ranges  from  0.3%  to  0.8% 3.  The  incidences  of 
schizoaffective  disorder  and  schizophrenia  were  approximately  24%  and  32%,  respectively,  among 
frequent users of mental health services4. 
Schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder have similarities in terms of symptoms, comorbidities, and 
genetic risk. Thus, atypical antipsychotics may be particularly useful in the treatment of schizoaffective 
disorder. However, currently there is no antipsychotic that has been approved for use in this indication 
in the European Union (EU). 
In this type II variation, the MAH initially applied for an extension of indication of Invega as follows: 
“Treatment of schizoaffective disorder as monotherapy or in combination with mood stabilisers and/or 
antidepressants.” 
Furthermore,  the  MAH  requested  consideration  of  this  application  under  Article  14(11)  of  Regulation 
(EC)  No  726/2004  and  submitted  a  justification  that  the  application  concerns  a  new  therapeutic 
indication which is claimed to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. 
Invega prolonged release tablets (Paliperidone ER) are currently approved in the European Union (EU) 
for  the  treatment  of  schizophrenia  with  recommended  dose  of  6  mg  once  daily.  Dosage  adjustment 
may be required within the recommended range of 3-12 mg once daily. 
Paliperidone  (9-hydroxy-risperidone)  belongs  to  the  class  of  atypical  antipsychotics  and  is  the  major 
metabolite of risperidone, used for the treatment of schizophrenia.

1.2.  Non clinical aspects 
Environmental risk assessment (ERA) 
The  MAH  predicted  that  based  on  available  epidemiological  studies,  the  approval  of  the  proposed 
indication  will  not  significantly  increase  the  use  of  paliperidone  in  the  EU.    Taking  into  account  the 
updated calculation of the PEC refinement based on actual use of the product and that in the studies, 
both  patients  with  schizoaffective  disorder  and  schizophrenia  were  included,  the  ERA  was  considered 
acceptable by the CHMP. 
1.3.  Clinical aspects 
The development program completed to support the proposed extension of indication consisted of: 
-  Two  Phase  I  studies  to  investigate  the  possible  interactions  between  divalproex  sodium  and 
paliperidone  in  healthy  subjects  (R076477-BIM-1003)  and  in  clinically  stable  patients  with 
schizophrenia,  bipolar  I  disorder  or  schizoaffective  disorder  (R076477-BIM-1004),  when  co-
administered; 
-  Two  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallel-group,  6  week,  Phase  III  studies,  to 
assess  the  efficacy  and  safety  with  2  dose  levels(R076477-SCA-3001)5 and  flexible  doses  (R076477-
SCA-3002)6 of paliperidone  
Additionally, the MAH also provided some pharmacokinetic (PK) data from patients with schizoaffective 
disorder  and  the  results  from  an  in  vitro  induction  study  (FK5875),  previously  submitted  in  the 
withdrawn application (EMEA/H/C/746/II/19). 
A  Phase  3b  safety  and  tolerability  study  (SCH-4005)  in  subjects  with  schizophrenia  or  schizoaffective 
disorder and with active hepatic disease is also currently ongoing.  
In April and May 2009, the MAH sought national scientific advices at the MPA and BfARM, respectively 
on  whether  the  proposed  clinical  program  could  support  a  claim  for  an  indication  in  schizoaffective 
disorder.  During  the  national  scientific  advices,  the  main  considerations  were  related  to  the  following 
requirements:  sensitivity  analysis  related  to  efficacy  (responder  analysis);  subgroup  analyses  for  1) 
the  primary  endpoint  with  subjects  who  had  major  depression  or  mania,  2)  for  co-medication 
(antidepressants (AD) only, mood stabilizers (MS) only, AD and MS, neither AD or MS); consistency on 
both  PANSS  positive  and  negative  symptoms;  generalisibility  of  the  data  to  the  EU  population  and 
adequate supportive data (e.g dose finding studies) on the proposed dosing regimen. 
1.3.1 Pharmacokinetics 
• 
1) 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Study R076477-BIM-1003 
This was an open label, 2-treatment, single-sequence study in 24 healthy men (one subject withdrew 
consent). 
The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  divalproex  sodium  (VPA)  at  steady 
state on the PK of a single dose of paliperidone ER (12 mg). The secondary objective was to evaluate 
the effect of a single dose of 12 mg paliperidone ER on the steady-state PK of divalproex sodium ER. 
Divalproex  sodium  ER  (extended  release)  increased  the  plasma  exposure  of  paliperidone  by  an 
estimated  51%  (Cmax:  maximum  plasma  concentration)  and  52%  (AUC0-∞:  area  under  the  plasma 
5 hereafter referred to as SCA-3001 
6 hereafter referred to as SCA-3002

concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinite time). Median Tmax for paliperidone was approximately 
24  hours  for  both  treatments.  The  estimated  half-life  of  paliperidone  was  not  different  between  the 
treatments (mean 23.5 hours for paliperidone alone and 24.0 hours for paliperidone + VPA).  
VPA  steady-state  concentrations  were  similar  after administration  of  divalproex  sodium  ER  alone  and 
after co-administration of  paliperidone ER and divalproex sodium ER. The treatment ratios for Cmax,ss  
(maximum plasma concentration during a dosing interval at steady state) and AUCτ  (area under the 
plasma  concentration-time  curve  during  a  dosing  interval)  were  close  to  100%.  The  90%  CIs 
(confidence  intervals)  for  geometric  mean  ratios  of  AUCτ  and  Cmax,  ss  (maximum  plasma 
concentration during a dosing interval at steady state) fell within 80% and 125%. 
The frequency of the adverse events (AEs) were 35 % for the combination (paliperidone+VPA) and 79 
% for paliperidone alone. 
2) 
Study R076477-BIM-1004 
This  was  an  open label,  single-sequence,  PK  drug-drug  interaction  study  of  oral  paliperidone  ER  co-
administered with oral divalproex sodium ER (DEPAKOTE® ER, Abbott) in clinically stable subjects with 
schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder or schizoaffective disorder who were on valproate therapy.  
The primary objective of this study is to assess the potential effect of multiple doses of paliperidone 
ER tablets on the steady-state PK of VPA.  
Fourteen of the 17 enrolled subjects completed the study as per the study protocol and three subjects 
were withdrawn due to an adverse event, withdrawal of consent, and the third due to a positive test 
for  cocaine.  One  subject  did  not  fast  for  10  hours  before  intake  of  divalproex  sodium  on  Day  7  and 
plasma  concentrations  and  PK  parameters  for  VPA  were  excluded  from  descriptive  statistics  and 
statistical analyses. 
Mean  VPA  steady-state  concentration-time  profiles  were  comparable  after  co-administration  of 
paliperidone ER and divalproex sodium ER and after administration of divalproex sodium ER alone.  
Plasma  VPA  steady-state  concentrations  were  similar  after  administration  of  divalproex  sodium  ER 
alone  and  after  co-administration  with  paliperidone  ER.  Mean  AUCτ  and  Cmax,ss  values  were  similar 
for  both  treatments.The  VPA  treatment  ratios  for  Cmax,ss  and  AUCτ  were  close  to  100%.  The  90% 
confidence intervals for geometric mean ratios of AUCτ and Cmax,ss fell within 80 and 125%. 
The  number  of  subjects  who  reported  treatment-emergent  AEs  was  higher  during  treatment  with 
paliperidone ER plus divalproex sodium ER than during treatment with divalproex sodium ER alone (63 
versus (vs). 18%). One subject experienced a serious adverse event (blood creatinine increased), and 
one subject was discontinued from study due to a non-serious adverse event (akathisia). The increase 
in  blood  creatinine  was  based  on  an  isolated  laboratory  finding,  without  clinical  signs  of  acute  renal 
impairment, and the finding was considered by the laboratory as likely recorded in error. 
• 
Additional pharmacokinetic analysis 
No  specific  PK  studies  have  been  conducted  in  patients  with  schizoaffective  disorder  and  no  plasma 
samples  were  taken  from  the  Phase  III  studies  included  in  this  variation  application.  In  two 
schizophrenia  studies  previously  submitted  (SCH-102  and  SCH-1014),  patients  with  schizoaffective 
disorder were allowed for inclusion and some PK data were obtained in these studies.  
A  total  of  thirteen  subjects  with  schizoaffective  disorder  (5  from  Study  SCH-  102  and  8  from  Study 
SCH-1014) and 58 subjects with schizophrenia (27 from Study SCH-102 and 31 from Study SCH-1014) 
were included in this subgroup analysis.

Results  indicated  that  no  pharmacokinetic  differences  between  patients  with  schizoaffective  disorder 
and those with schizophrenia were observed. 
• 
In vitro metabolism 
An in vitro induction study (Study FK5875) has been performed, to assess the effect of paliperidone on 
the activity of the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 in human hepatocytes.   
Omeprazole  led  to  a  13-fold  increase  in  CYP1A2  activity  compared  to  vehicle  alone.  Rifampicin-
mediated induction of CYP2C19 activity, led to a moderate, but significant 2-fold increase compared to 
vehicle  alone.  Rifampicin  led  to  a  moderate,  but  significant  2.3-fold  increase  of  CYP3A4  function 
compared to vehicle alone. Paliperidone did not induce, nor inhibit, CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and/or CYP3A4.  
• 
Discussion on pharmacokinetic aspects 
A single paliperidone ER dose or multiple dosing with paliperidone ER did not affect VPA steady state 
concentrations. 
In the multiple dose paliperidone ER study (R076477-BIM-1004), different VPA doses (500 to 2000 mg 
once daily) were administered, but since all subjects remained on a stable dose of VPA throughout the 
study,  this  was  considered  acceptable  by  the  CHMP.  Multiple  dosing  with  paliperidone  ER  12 mg/day 
did not affect the pharmacokinetics of VPA. The paliperidone dose used in this study was the highest 
recommended dosage in both schizophrenia and the schizoaffective disorder indications.  
However,  in  the  single  dose  paliperidone  ER  study  (R076477-BIM-1003),  an  effect  of  VPA  co-
administration  was  observed  with  approximately  50%  higher  exposure  to  paliperidone.  According  to 
the  MAH,  the  most  likely  mechanism  behind  the  observed  increase  in  exposure  an  absorption-based 
interaction:  a  prolongation  of  the  gastric  residence  time  of  the  paliperidone  ER  tablet  could  have 
extended  the  time  for  paliperidone  absorption  in  the  small  intestine,  and  thus,  increased  the 
bioavailability.  It  was  also  hypothesized  that  prolongation  of  the  gastric  residence  time  in  those 
subjects who showed the highest treatment ratio of AUC and Cmax may have been caused by a physical 
phenomenon  such  as  swelling  of  the  divalproex  sodium  ER  tablets,  which  might  have  prevented 
passage through the pylorus.  
In  the  CHMP’s  view,  Invega  is  an  OROS  (oral  osmotic  system)  formulation,  and  it  is  known  that 
concomitant intake with a high-fat meal increases the bioavailability by 50-60%, which is also thought 
to be due to an effect on gastric emptying and consequently a larger time for absorption in the small 
intestine. Even if both formulations used in this interaction study are ER and the divalproex sodium ER 
tablet,  it  seems  rather  unlikely  that  the  size  increase  (due  to  swelling)  would  be  so  extensive  that  it 
would affect passage through the pylorus. The CHMP therefore considered that the mechanism behind 
the  observed  interaction  was  not  completely  clear  and  recommended  that  information  based  on  the 
study results could be reflected into the SPC.  
In  study  R076477-BIM-1003,  the  adverse  events  (AEs)  observed  were  consistent  with  the  known 
safety profile of divalproex sodium ER  and paliperidone ER tablets and the combined treatment did not 
result in a higher incidence of  AEs due to an increase in plasma concentrations of paliperidone.  
No  interaction  study  with  lithium  has  been  performed.  Although  an  interaction  between  paliperidone 
and  lithium  does  not  seem  theoretically  plausible,  the  CHMP  recommended  this  information  to  be 
reflected into the SPC. 
The  potential  for  paliperidone  to  induce  CYPs  1A2,  2C19  and  3A4  was  also  investigated  in  an  in vitro 
study  (FK5875),  including  positive  controls.  No  induction  was  observed  with  paliperidone.  The 
rifampicin-mediated  induction  was  relatively  low,  being  approximately  2-fold  for  both  CYP  2C19  and 
3A4, while omeprazole caused a 13-fold induction of CYP1A2. The small effect observed with rifampicin 
Invega 
ASSESSMENT REPORT

indicates that the study may not be very sensitive in detecting an inducing effect. Considering that the 
rifampicin  induction  effect  was  very  small,  the  validity  of  the  study  for  assessment  of  CYP2C19  and 
CYP3A4  induction  is  questioned  and  therefore  the  CHMP  still  maintained  its  recommendation  for  non 
inclusion of this information into the SPC. 
1.3.2 Clinical efficacy 
• 
Main clinical studies 
Two  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallel-group,  6  week,  Phase  III  studies  were 
conducted  to  assess  the  efficacy  and  safety  with  2  dose  levels  (SCA-3001)  and  flexible  doses  (SCA-
3002) of paliperidone. 
Studies SCA-3001 and SCA-3002 were multicenter and conducted in the US, India (both SCA-3001 and 
SCA-3002),  Russia  and  Ukraine  (SCA-3001),  Asia  and  Romania  (SCA-3002)  with  a  majority  of  US 
patients included in these studies. The design was similar in the two studies. 
METHODS 
Inclusion/ Exclusion Criteria 
Patients  who  enrolled  were:  male  or  female,  18  to  65  years  of  age;  fulfilling  the  DSM-IV  criteria  for 
schizoaffective  disorder;  experiencing  an  acute  exacerbation  with  a  Positive  And  Negative  Syndrome 
Scale  (PANSS)  score  of  at  least  60;  presenting  a  score  of  >  4  on  at  least  2  of  the  PANSS  items  ( 
Hostility,  Excitement,  Tension,  Uncooperativeness,  and  Poor  Impulse  Control)  at  screening  and 
randomisation, and presenting a score of >16 on the Young Mania rating Scale (YMRS) and/or a score 
of >16 on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-21) at screening and randomisation.  
Key  exclusion  criteria  were:  meeting  DSM-IV  criteria  for  major  depressive  disorder,  bipolar  disorder, 
schizophrenia,  or  schizophreniform  disorder;  currently  meeting  criteria  for  any  other  Axis  I  diagnosis 
except  substance  abuse;  meeting  the  DSM-IV  criteria  for  substance  dependence  in  the  6  months 
before  study  entry,  an  Axis  II  diagnosis  of  Mental  Retardation  or  Borderline  Personality  Disorder; 
suicide attempt within 12 months or at imminent risk of suicide according to the investigator’s clinical 
judgement, and first episode (no prior history of psychotic symptoms). 
Randomisation and Blinding 
Randomisation  was  centralised  with  randomly  permuted  blocks  and  stratified  by  site  and  by 
concomitant  treatment  with  antidepressants  and/or  mood  stabilizers  versus  no  such  concomitant 
treatment.The capsules of study drug, including placebo, were identical in appearance. To further keep 
the  blind,  post-baseline  prolactin  levels  were  not  available  to  the  investigators  or  the  sponsor  during 
the course of the study. 
Treatment period 
After  a  screening  and  wash-out  period  of  2-5  days,  eligible  patients  were  randomised  to  6  weeks  of 
double-blind  treatment  with  paliperidone  ER  or  placebo.  The  patients  were  hospitalised  during  the 
wash-out period and at least for the first 8 days of double-blind treatment. 
In  study  SCA-3001  the  patients  were  assigned  to  a  low  or  high  dose-group  of  paliperidone  ER  or 
placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio,  while in study  SCA-3002 the patients were assigned to paliperidone ER in a 
flexible dose regimen or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. 
In  the  low  or  high  dose  comparison  to  placebo  (study  SCA-3001),  paliperidone  ER  treated  patients 
were started on 12 or 6 mg/day. During the first 15 days the dose could be reduced once to 9 and 3

mg, respectively. After at least 4 days on a reduced dose, the dose could be increased to the original 
dose.  
In  the  flexible  dose  study    (study  SCA-3002),  paliperidone  ER  treated  patients  were  started  on  6 
mg/day for 4 days, and thereafter the dose could be adjusted between 3 and 12 mg/day until Day 15.  
In neither of the studies dose adjustment was allowed after the Day 15 visit. 
Primary/Secondary Endpoints 
The primary efficacy variable was the change from baseline to Week 6 in PANSS total score. 
Secondary  efficacy  endpoints  included:  change  from  baseline  to  Week  6  in  PANSS-24;  change  from 
baseline to Week 6 in PANSS subscales and factor scores; actual and change from baseline to Week 6 
in Clinical Global Impression of Severity for Schizoaffective disorder (CGI-C-SCA); CGI of Change-SCA 
(CGI-C-SCA)  at  week  6;  responder  rate  (defined  as  the  percentage  of  patients  with  >30%  reduction 
from baseline in PANSS total score and a CGI-C-SCA <2 at week 6); change from baseline to Week 6 
in HAM-D-21; change from baseline to Week 6 in YMRS. 
Statistical Method 
All  efficacy  analyses  were  performed  with  the  Intent-To-Treat  (ITT)  analysis  set  which  included  all 
randomised patients who received at least 1 dose of study medication and had both a baseline and at 
least 1 post-baseline PANSS assessment. 
The  primary  endpoint  and  all  other  variables  measuring  change  from  baseline  were  analysed  with  an 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment, concomitant treatment stratum and country as 
fixed  factors  and  baseline  score  as  covariate.  The treatment  effect  was  estimated  with  the  difference 
between LS means with accompanying 95% confidence interval. 
The  responder  data  were analysed  with  the  Cochran  Mantel  Haenszel  test  controlling  for  concomitant 
medication stratum and country. 
In the three-armed study (SCA-3001) the overall type I error was controlled with the Hochberg step-
up  procedure.  All  secondary  analyses  were  considered  supportive  and  no  further  adjustments  for 
multiplicity were planned. 
In all analyses the primary approach for imputation of missing values was the Last Observation Carried 
Forward (LOCF) method. Alternative analyses were performed with a repeated measures mixed effects 
model  (MMRM),  and  analyses  where  increasingly  worse  (up  to  20  %)  LOCF  values  were  imputed  for 
missing values in the active treatment group while the originally imputed LOCF value was kept for the 
placebo group. 
RESULTS

Study SCA-3001 
Patient characteristics 
Three hundred and eighty seven patients were enrolled, and of these 316 were randomised to a low or 
high dose of paliperidone ER, or placebo. Almost all patients were included in the ITT populations. The 
withdrawal rate was dose-dependent with more discontinuations on placebo (41.1%)  and lower doses 
(33.9%), mainly due to lack of effect and withdrawal of consent. 
Demographic  characteristics  were  similar  for  the  three  treatment  groups  with  the  exception  of  body 
weight and body mass index (BMI), which were higher in the placebo group especially compared to the 
paliperidone ER low dose group.

Figure 1 Change from baseline in PANSS Total score in study SCA-3001. ITT-LOCF results 
A  significant  difference  versus  placebo  was  observed  for  the  paliperidone  ER  high  dose  group  for  the 
primary endpoint PANSS Total score while a significant result was not achieved for the low dose group 
(Table 5 and Figure 1).  
For  the  key  secondary  variables  PANSS-24,  HAM-D-21,  YMRS,  responders  and  percentage  of  patient 
much  or  very  much  approved  on  the  CGI-C-SCA  scale,  there  was  an  overall  pattern  of  significant  or 
nearly  significant  results  in  favour  of  both  dose  groups  versus  placebo  with  a  clear  tendency  of  dose 
response (Table 5).  
Although there was no statistical evidence of a differential effect depending on whether the patient was 
on  concomitant  treatment  with  antidepressants  and/or  mood  stabilizers  or  not  (treatment-by-
concomitant  medication  interaction,  p-value=0.641),  the  effect  was  clearly  less  pronounced    and  not 
reaching statistical significance for patients on concomitant treatment (see Figure 2).

Study SCA-3002 
Patient characteristics 
Three  hundred  and  ninety  one  patients  were  enrolled,  and  of  these  311  were  randomised  to  flexibly 
dosed paliperidone ER (3-12 mg), or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. The withdrawal rate was higher on placebo 
(45.3%) versus active treatment (38%,) mainly due to lack of effect. 
The treatment groups were well balanced with respect to demographic characteristics as well as with 
respect to baseline severity. 
Baseline ratings and psychiatric history are presented in Tables 7 and 8.

A  significant  difference  comparable  to  the  difference  seen  for  the  high  dose  in  study  SCA-3001  was 
observed for flexibly dose paliperidone ER versus placebo. 
All key secondary efficacy variables were statistically significant in favour of paliperidone ER. 
There was no statistical evidence of a treatment-by concomitant medication interaction (p=0.486) and 
the difference versus placebo was statistically significant for both strata (Figure 4).  
Neither  was  there  any  statistical  evidence  of  country  or  regional  difference  but  similar  to  study  SCA-

Supportive studies 
There  are  no  studies  demonstrating  an  effect  beyond  6  weeks  of  paliperidone  ER  in  schizoaffective 
disorder.  To  support  the  maintenance  of  the  effect,  the  MAH  referred  to  the  data  establishing 
maintenance of effect in the initial CHMP approval of the schizophrenia indication, primarily a relapse 
prevention  study  (SCH-301),  with  some  support  from  open-label  extension  studies  (SCH-701,  SCH-
703, SCH-704 and SCH-705) conducted in schizophrenia. In study SCH-301, patients responding to 14 
weeks open label paliperidone treatment were randomised to continue on active treatment or placebo. 
Roughly twice as many patients had a relapse on placebo compared with paliperidone (see Figure 5).  
Figure 5 
In the 4 open label studies, flexible doses of paliperidone ER were administered covering the range 3 
to  15  mg.  The  combined  intent-to-treat  analysis  sets  of  the  4  studies  included  a  total  of  1,309 
subjects,  among  whom  895  received  paliperidone  ER  for  greater  than  6  months  and  571  received 
paliperidone  ER  for  more  than  1  year.  In  all  studies,  the  mean  PANSS  total  score  decreased  from 
baseline (open-label) to end point. 
In  study  SCH-703,  improvement  during  the  open-label  treatment  phase  was  more  prominent  for 
subjects  treated  with  placebo  during  the  double-blind  phase,  although  incremental  improvement  was 
also noted in subjects previously treated with paliperidone ER and olanzapine. 
In  study  SCH-704,  subjects  entering  the  open-label  phase  had  previously  experienced  statistically 
significant  decreases  in  the  mean  PANSS  total  score  during  double-blind  treatment.  Despite  this 
improvement  already  realized  at  the  start  of  the  open-label  phase,  continued  improvement  was 
observed  during  open-label  treatment.  Improvement  during  the  open-label  phase  was  most 
pronounced  in  subjects  previously  treated  with  double-blind  placebo,  as  these  subjects  had  notably 
higher PANSS scores at open-label baseline. 
In study SCH-705, subjects previously treated with double-blind placebo had the most improvement. 
In  study  SCH-701,  the  largest  treatment  effect  during  the  open-label  extension  was  observed  in 
subjects  treated  with  double-blind  placebo,  as  these  subjects  had  notably  higher  PANSS  scores  at 
open-label baseline.

The MAH also referred to studies with the mother compound risperidone in which schizophrenia as well 
as  schizoaffective  patients  have  been  studied  (RIS-USA-79,  RSI-SCH-401,  RIS-INT-57)  and  the  Vieta 
et  al  study  (2001).  Comparative  pharmacokinetic  data  were  also  presented  to  further  support  this 
proposed extrapolation. 
In  study  RIS-USA-79  stable  outpatients  fulfilling  the  DSM-IV  criteria  for  chronic  schizophrenia  or 
schizoaffective disorder were randomised to at least one year double-blind treatment with risperidone 
2-8  mg/day  (median  modal  dose  4  mg)  or  haloperidol  5-20  mg/day  (median  modal  dose  10  mg). 
Primary  endpoint  was  time  to  relapse  with  relapse defined  as  clinical  deterioration,  increased level of 
care,  or  violence  towards  self  and/or  others.    Overall  the  result  was  in  favour  of  risperidone  and  the 
magnitude  of  effect  was  similar  in  patients  with  schizoaffective  disorder  and  in  patients  with 
schizophrenia (Table 12).

In  a  12  months  double-blind  study  (RSI-SCH-401)  comparing  two  doses  of  risperidone  long-acting 
injection in subjects with stable schizoaffective disorder (n=66) or stable schizophrenia (n=258) similar 
relapse rates (15% vs 22%, respectively) were observed. 
In  a  12  months  open  label  study  (RSI-INT-57)  comparing  three  doses  of  risperidone  long-acting 
injection in subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, improvements in PANSS total score 
were  statistically  significant  (p≤0.004)  at  each  time  point  in  all  3  dose  groups  for  subjects  with 
schizophrenia  Similarly,  for  subjects  with  schizoaffective  disorder,  the  improvement  in  PANSS  total 
score in each dose group was statistically significant (p≤0.029) at each time point. 
In the Vieta et al. study (2001),  a long-term (6-month) open-label adjunctive study of risperidone in 
541 subjects with bipolar I disorder (55% of subjects), schizoaffective disorder, bipolar subtype (34%), 
bipolar  II  disorder  (8%),  or  bipolar  disorder  not  otherwise  specified  (3%),  statistically  significant 
improvements  from  baseline  in  all  efficacy  measures  (YMRS,  HAM-D,  PANSS  total  score,  PANSS 
subfactors, and Clinical Global Impression) at the 6-month end point were observed. Mean (SD) scores 
on the YMRS decreased from 25.6 (10.7) at baseline to 2.4 (4.6) at end point (p<0.0001) (Figure 10). 
Mean (SD) HAM-D scores declined from 12.8 (7.9) at baseline to 4.1 (4.8) at 6 months (p<0.001). 
Further  long-term  clinical  studies  with  paliperidone  ER  and  other  related  compounds  (paliperidone 
palmitate,  risperdal  consta),  conducted  either  in  bipolar  I  disorder,  schizophrenia  or  treatment 
resistant  depression,  were  referred  by  the  MAH  as  supportive  data.  All  of  these  populations  had  at 
least one symptom domain of schizoaffective disorder (psychosis, mania and depression). 
In  the  schizophrenia  study  PSY-3001,  subjects  were  treated  with  flexible  doses  of  paliperidone 
palmitate  in  a  9-week  transition  phase,  followed  by  a  12-week  maintenance  phase.  The  dose  of 
paliperidone palmitate was fixed in a second 12-week period of the maintenance phase. Those subjects 
who  continued  to  achieve  symptom  response  were  then  randomly  assigned  to  continue  with  fixed 
doses of paliperidone palmitate or were switched to placebo. Results are presented in Figure 6.

In the Bipolar I disorder study BIM-3004, treatment periods consisted of a 3-week double-blind acute 
treatment  phase;  a  12-week  double-blind  continuation  phase;  a  double-blind  maintenance  phase 
(lasting  until  the  subject  experiences  a  recurrence);  and  a  follow-up  phase.  Subjects  were  randomly 
assigned in a 4:1 ratio to paliperidone ER or olanzapine (for assay sensitivity) in the double-blind acute 
treatment phase of the study. Paliperidone ER was dosed once daily in a flexible dosage range of 3 to 
12  mg/d  to  optimize  each  subject’s  level  of  clinical  response  and  tolerability  of  the  study  drug. 
Subjects who achieved a clinical response (i.e., a reduction from baseline [Day 1] in YMRS total score

Choice of the Dose 
The  MAH  recommended  6  mg  once  a  day  for  the  treatment  of  schizoaffective  disorder  with  the 
possibility to adjust the dose between 3 and 12 mg/day. 
In the CHMP’s view, the low dose, particularly 3 mg, is not supported by the clinical studies, as study 
SCA-3001  clearly  favored  the  high  dose  group.  Also  a  dose  recommendation  for  3  mg  cannot  be 
deduced  from  study  SCA-3002,  as  only  single  cases  received  3mg/d  and  30-35%  patients  each 
received 6mg, 9mg or 12mg/d as final dose.  
Following  MAH’s  justifications  on  dosing  recommendation,  the  CHMP  was  still  of  the  opinion  that  the 
low dose could not be recommended. In study SCA-3001, the low dose (6 mg/d, with option to reduce 
to  3mg/d)  was  not  efficacious  with  a  mean  change  in  PANSS  of  -27.4  vs  -21.7  (placebo  group)  (p= 
0.187). In the other pivotal study SCA-3002 only 3 out of 304 patients (1%) were treated with the 3 
mg  dose  in  study  SCA-3002.  The  CHMP  recommended  to  modify  the  proposed  posology  in  the  SPC 
accordingly. 
• 
Additional analyses 
At  the  CHMP’s  request,  analyses  from  pivotal  studies  SCA-3001  and  SCA-3002  were  performed  to 
compare the efficacy in the sub-groups defined as “antidepressants only” and “mood stabilisers only”.

Additionally, post-hoc responder analyses that considered subjects who discontinued from the study as 
non-responders showed that at week 6, the proportions of subjects who responded to treatment were 
statistically significantly greater than placebo for studies SCA-3001 and SCA-3002 (34.6% and 23.7%, 
respectively)  in  the  ER  groups  (SCA-3001:  55.1%,  p=0.002  for  the  high  dose  group;  SCA-3002:

In  two  placebo-controlled  short-term  phase  3  studies,  statistically  significant  effect  in  favour  of 
paliperidone  ER  for  the  primary  endpoint  PANSS  Total  score  was  shown.  The  clinical  relevance  of  the 
results is illustrated in responder analyses showing differences versus placebo of 22 and 12.5 %-units 
for  the  two  studies,  respectively.  The  validity  of  these  effects  for  schizoaffective  patients  are 
substantiated  in  analyses  of  secondary  endpoints,  including  PANSS-24  which  consist  of  the  PANSS 
items  corresponding  to  the  DSM-IV  criteria  for  schizoaffective  disorder,  and  clinically  relevant 
reductions  of  depressive  and  manic  symptoms  in  patients  with  pronounced  affective  symptoms  at 
baseline.  
In  study  SCA-3001,  an  effect  of  paliperidone  ER  9-12  mg/day  (high  dose  group)  has  been 
demonstrated  for  the  primary  endpoint  with  consistent  support  in  the  analyses  of  the  secondary 
endpoints.  
In study SCA-3002, an effect of flexibly dosed (3-12 mg/day) paliperidone ER has been demonstrated. 
The  number  of  EU  patients  studied  was  limited  (81  patients  from  Romania).Otherwise  the  study 
population is dominated by US patients (with a potentially less pronounced effect), and Asian patients. 
After  a  subgroup  analysis  (EU  Caucasians  vs  US  Caucasians)  performed  by  the  MAH,  the  CHMP 
considered  these  results  to  be  sufficiently  supportive  of  the  external  validity  of  the  two  short-term 
studies. 
However,  the  CHMP  raised  major  concerns  regarding  the  comparative  efficacy  data  between  mono-
therapy  and  combination  with  anti-depressives-mood  stabilizers,  as  presented  by  the  MAH.  For 
instance,  in  study  SCA-3001,  although  no  statistical  evidence  of  a  differential  effect  depending  on 
whether the patient was on concomitant treatment with antidepressants and/or mood stabilizers or not 
(treatment-by-concomitant  medication  interaction,  p-value=0.641)  was  observed,  the  change  in 
PANSS  Total  score  was  clearly  less  pronounced  not  reaching  statistical  significance  for  patients  on 
concomitant  treatment(see  Figure  2).  Moreover,  apart  from  PANSS  total  score,  which  reflects  the 
schizophrenia  component,  the  CHMP  considered  that  information  was  required  in  both  settings  about 
the effect on the affective component (mania, depression). 
Following the above major concern, the MAH performed a post-hoc analysis pooling the pivotal studies 
SCA-3001 and SCA-3002. In the pooled analysis, clinically relevant effects on PANSS and YMRS total 
scores were demonstrated in patients with mood stabilizers only and in patients with antidepressants 
only.  The  CHMP  noted  that  no  effect  is  observed  in  patients  on  both  mood  stabilizers  and 
antidepressants.  However,  this  observation  is  based  on  50  patients  in  total  and  must  be  interpreted 
with caution. In subgroup analyses of the pooled studies, highly significant effects on PANSS and YMRS 
total  scores  have  been  demonstrated  for  patients  with  prominent  manic  symptoms,  prominent 
depressive symptoms, as well as in patients with prominent mixed symptoms. The point estimates of 
difference in the least-squares (LS) mean changes from baseline for the YMRS and PANSS total scores 
were respectively : -4.8 and -8.2 (prominent manic symptoms at baseline); -3.1 and -7.9 (prominent 
depressive symptoms) and -4.2 and -8.5 (prominent mixed symptoms). The magnitude of effect for all 
endpoints  was  considered  by  the  CHMP  clinically  relevant  and  comparable  to  other  studies  of  acute 
treatment  in  schizophrenia,  manic  episodes  associated  with  bipolar  I  disorder  and  major  depressive 
episodes, respectively. As expected the effect on manic symptoms is less pronounced in patients with 
prominent depressive symptoms.

Prior  to  any  final  conclusions  on  the  above,  further  analyses  were  required,  excluding  patients  on 
prohibited  additional  antipsychotics  prior  to  PANSS  total  score  assessment.  Results  (see  Figure  12) 
were consistent with the earlier analyses (Figures 2 and 4) in the “no concomitant medication” stratum. 
In  both  studies  SCA-3001  and  SCA-3002  using  the  pre-specified  and  post-hoc  responder  analyses, 
paliperidone ER had a statistically favourable effect on the proportion of responders relative to placebo 
among  subjects  with  schizoaffective  disorder.  Same  analyses  excluding  subjects  receiving  prohibited 
concomitant  antipsychotic  medication  prior  to  the  last  PANSS  assessment  during  the  study  showed 
similar results. 
The  overall  effect  of  lithium  in  the  pivotal  studies  was  also  questioned  by  the  CHMP  and  subgroup 
analyses were performed by the MAH in subjects with prominent depressive symptoms for HAM-D total 
score  and  in  subjects  with  prominent  manic  symptoms  for  YRMS  total  score  and  in  all  subjects  for 
PANSS  total  score  to  address  this  point.  In  total,  29  patients  on  paliperidone  ER  and  22  on  placebo 
received at least one dose of lithium meaning 11% of subjects in the placebo group and 7% of subjects 
in  the  combined  paliperidone  ER  group  used  lithium  during  the  phase  III  studies.  With  respect  to 
affective  symptoms  rated  with  HAM-D  and  YMRS  total  scores,  there  were  no  major  numerical 
differences in magnitude of effect between patients with no concomitant lithium use and patients with 
any lithium use, and no indication of a treatment by lithium use interaction (see Tables 18 and 19). In 
contrast,  for  psychotic  symptoms  rated  with  PANSS  Total  Score,  the  effect  seen  in  the  overall 
population  is  entirely  attributed  to  the  subgroup  with  no  lithium  use.  However,  due  to  the  limited 
number of patients, the CHMP considered that no reliable conclusions can be drawn on this issue. 
To further support the effect of paliperidone ER as monotherapy or add-on treatment in schizoaffective 
disorder, indirect comparison of efficacy results between paliperidone ER and other antipsychotics from 
available  clinical  studies  in  this  population  was  also  conducted  by  the  MAH.  However,  the  CHMP 
considered this  analysis  of  limited  value.  The  CHMP  noted  that  only  2  published  randomised,  double-
blind studies comparing an antipsychotic versus an antidepressant or mood stabilizer were identified7 . 
The proposed initial extrapolation of available long term data from the schizophrenia studies and from 
the  studies  with  the  mother  compound  risperidone  (performed  in  schizophrenia  and  schizoaffective 
disorder)  to  support  the  long-term  maintenance  of  the  effect  of  paliperidone  ER  in  schizoaffective 
disorder  was  questioned  by  the  CHMP.  The  pivotal  studies  had  a  maximum  length  of  6  weeks  and 
longer-term  maintenance  studies  were  not  included  in  the  development  program.  Although 
pharmacokinetic  data  were  presented  to  support  the  extrapolation  using  the  mother  compound 
risperidone,  all  schizophrenia  long  term  studies  with  paliperidone  ER  had  an  open-label  design  and 
neither  risperidone  or  comparators  used  in  the  proposed  supportive  long  term  studies  have  been 
authorised in schizoaffective disorder.  
In light of the above major concern related to extrapolation of long term data to support the long-term 
maintenance  of  the  effect  of  paliperidone  ER  in  schizoaffective  disorder  and  on  the  basis  of  the 
available  data  to  date,  the  CHMP  agreed  to  convene  a  Central  Nervous  System  Scientific  Advisory 
Group  (SAG-CNS)  to  discuss  the  need  for  long-term  efficacy  data  for  paliperidone  in  the  applied 
indication. The SAG-CNS was held on 13 July 2010 and the main conclusions were the following: 
-  Ideally,  long-term  studies  in  the  target  population with  outcome  scales  validated  for  schizoaffective 
disorder  should  have  been  performed.  However,  in  the  absence  of  such  studies,  it  was  considered 
reasonable  that  there  is  maintenance  of  effect  on  psychotic  symptoms  during  prolonged  treatment 
since  the  psychotic  symptoms  of  schizoaffective  disorder  are  similar  to  those  in  schizophrenia.  Thus, 
this was considered a valid extrapolation.

- The group was convinced that there is good evidence of maintenance of effect on manic symptoms. 
From the submitted documentation, the SAG-CNS is not convinced that there is a clinically significant 
effect on depressive symptoms. The HAM-D scale is not validated for measuring depressive symptoms 
in  schizophrenia  and  related  disorders.  Other  assessment  scales  which  have  been  validated  should 
have been considered (i.e. the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia). There was no evidence for 
a tachyphylactic mechanism. 
To further address the above major concern, additional long-term clinical studies with paliperidone ER 
and  other  related  compounds  (paliperidone  palmitate,  risperdal  consta),  conducted  either  in  bipolar  I 
disorder,  schizophrenia  or  treatment  resistant  depression,  were  referred  by  the  MAH  as  supportive 
data. All of these populations had at least one symptom domain of schizoaffective disorder (psychosis, 
mania and depression).  
An oral explanation took place on 20 July 2010. In the MAH’s view: 
- overlap in  symptom presentation according to DSM-IV criteria supports the validity of extrapolation 
of  data  in  different  populations  having  one  of  the  symptom  domains  of  schizoaffective  disorder 
(psychosis, mania, depression); 
- studies RIS-USA-79, RIS-SCH-401 and RIS-INT-57 showed that patients with schizoaffective disorder 
and schizophrenia responded similarly; 
- generally, there is a consistent benefit across acute and maintenance studies in psychotic and mood 
disorders for paliperidone and risperidone; 
- the maintenance of the effect of paliperidone ER has been demonstrated in psychosis (study SCH-301) 
and in preventing any mood episode in (study BIM-3004). In addition, comparative data from studies 
with paliperidone ER and risperdal consta showed an effect in preventing manic/mixed episodes. 
Having considered the SAG-CNS conclusions and the oral explanation provided by the MAH, the CHMP 
recommended the following indication: 
“INVEGA  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  psychotic  or  manic  symptoms  of  schizoaffective 
disorder. Effect on depressive symptoms has not been demonstrated." 
On  the  basis  of  the  available  data,  the  CHMP  also  recommended  to  include in  section  4.2  of  the  SPC 
related  to  schizoaffective  disorder  that  “Maintenance  of  effect  has  not  been  studied”.  The  CHMP 
requested  a  long-term  maintenance  study  on  paliperidone  palmitate  to  be  conducted  to  confirm  the 
maintenance  of  the  effect  of  paliperidone  in  this  population.  Additional  pharmacokinetic  data  on 
switching  from  oral  paliperidone  to  paliperidone  palmitate  should  also  be  provided  by  the  MAH.  The 
request  for  these  data  has  been  included,  upon  request  of  the  CHMP,  in  a  new  version  of  the  risk 
management plan. 
Furthermore,  the  CHMP  has  identified  that  an  effect  on  depressive  symptoms  has  not  been 
demonstrated, which should be clearly reflected in the product information. The HAM-D 21 scale used 
in the clinical trials is not validated for schizoaffective disorder and also includes symptoms that could 
be  attributed  to  psychosis/mania.  Furthermore,  some  improvement  of  depressive  symptoms  may  be 
expected  when  treating  an  acute  and  distressing  psychotic  episode even  in  the  absence  of  a  genuine 
antidepressive  effect  of  the  administered  drug.  On  the  basis  of  the  maintenance  study  protocol,  as 
proposed by the MAH, the CHMP recommended the use of HAM-D-17 scale.

Patient exposure 
The number of subjects who received at least one dose, and was part of the overall safety analyses set 
is  shown  in  each  concomitant  medication  stratum,  as  continuation  of  ongoing  therapy  with  mood 
stabilizers  (lithium,  valproate,  or  lamotrigine)  and/or  antidepressants  (except  monoamine  oxidase 
inhibitors) was permitted in both studies (see Table 16).

SCA-3001 and R076477-SCA-3002: All Randomized Subjects Analysis Set) 
Up  to  01  May  2009  in  the  ongoing  Phase  3b  Study  SCH-4005  in  patients  with  schizophrenia  or 
schizoaffective disorder and hepatic disease, 114 subjects were assigned to open-label treatment, and 
84 subjects received at least 1 dose of paliperidone ER.  
Total  duration  of  study  medication  and  average  daily  dose  during  the  double-blind  phase  are 
summarized  in  Table  20.  Across  both  completed  Phase  3  studies  paliperidone  ER  exposure  was 
calculated to be 39.3 subject-years. ´

In  Study  SCH-4005,  114  subjects  received  conventional  or  atypical  oral  antipsychotics  for  4  weeks 
(Phase  1),  and  84  subjects  cross-titrated  from  oral  antipsychotic  treatment  to  paliperidone  ER 
treatment for 1 week and then received paliperidone ER for 4 weeks (Phase 2, starting dose 6 mg/d, 
dose  range  3  to  12  mg/d).  Of  the  84  subjects  receiving  paliperidone  ER  during  Phase  2,  the  median 
duration  of  exposure  was  34  days,  and  the  mean  (SD)  duration  was  30  (9.2)  days,  and  the  average 
daily dose was 7.5 mg. This treatment resulted in 6.89 subject-years of paliperidone ER exposure. 
• 
Adverse events 
Treatment-Emergent  Adverse  Events  (TEAEs)  were  reported  for  65%  of  622  subjects  during  the 
double-blind  phase  of  the  studies.  In  44%,  AEs  were  considered  possibly,  probably,  or  very  likely 
related to study drug. 
All common treatment-emergent adverse events, ie, events that occurred in at least 5% of subjects in 
any treatment group during the double-blind phase, are presented in Table 21.

Events more frequently reported for paliperidone compared with placebo, were in the Nervous system 
disorders  System  Organ  Class  (SOC)  with  39.8%  vs.  27.7%,  respectively  and  the  Gastrointestinal 
disorders  SOC  with  24.5%  vs.  19.8%,  respectively.  With  respect  to  common  TEAEs,  tremor, 
hypertonia, somnolence, and dyspepsia occurred at higher incidences (more than 3%) in paliperidone 
ER-treated  subjects  compared  with  placebo.  Also  events  such  as  akathisia,  dizziness,  sedation  
dystonia, were among commont reported events, more frequently seen in paliperidone groups.  
In  subjects  receiving  concomitant  antidepressants  and/or  mood  stabilizers,  TEAEs  occurred  at  a 
greater  incidence  compared  to  those  subjects  not  receiving  these  therapies  (70.4%  versus  60.5% 
respectively).  Within  the  strata,  those  without  concomitant  antidepressants  and/or  mood  stabilizers, 
TEAEs  occurred  in  49%  on  placebo,  and  66%  on  paliperidone  (total),  while  in  the  group  on 
concomitant medication, TEAEs occurred in 70% of both placebo and total paliperidone.   
• 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) and deaths 
 In  phase  III  studies,  serious  TEAEs  were  reported  for  37  subjects  (5.9%),  and  AEs  lead  to 
discontinuation  of  40  subjects  (6.4%).  incidence  of  SAEs  was  higher  for  placebo  (6.9%)  vs.  the  total 
paliperidone  group  (5.5%),  and  higher  for  paliperidone  ER  low  dose  (9.3%)  compared  with  the  high 
dose (2.0%). Most of the SAEs were related to psychiatric disorders. 
There were two cases of suicidal ideation in the placebo group, and one case  of suicidal behaviour in 
the  low  dose  paliperidone  group.  These  SAEs  were  considered  related  to  the  underlying  psychiatric 
disorder. In the paliperidone group there were two cases of serious infection, while all other SAEs were 
reported  as  single  occurrences  across  all  treatment  groups.  All  SAEs  (excepted  case  related  to  small 
intestinal obstruction) were considered unrelated to paliperidone.  
There were no deaths reported during any of the studies (BIM-1003, BIM-1004, SCA-3001, and SCA-
3002), or up to the cut-off date of 01 May 2009 in study SCH-4005.

Overall,  7%  of  subjects  withdrew  due  to  adverse  events  in  the  placebo  group  as  well  as  in  the  total 
paliperidone ER group. Discontinuation due to AEs ranged from 4% of subjects in the paliperidone ER 
high dose group to 9% of subjects in the low dose group. Consequently, no apparent dose relationship 
in relation to withdrawal was observed. 
• 
Laboratory findings and vital signs 
Apart  from  elevated  serum  prolactin  levels  (see  below),  there  were  no  other  clinically  relevant  mean 
changes  from  baseline  at  any  time  point  across  treatment  groups  for  laboratory  analytes,  including 
hematology, renal function, liver function, fasting blood glucose, serum lipid, and urinalysis parameters. 
In the high paliperidone ER group, slight increases in mean changes from baseline to endpoint in ALT 
and AST values were noted, with no corresponding change in the median values.   
There were no clinically noteworthy differences in means or mean changes from baseline to end point 
in  any  laboratory  analyte for  paliperidone  ER-treated  subjects  receiving  antidepressants  and/or  mood 
stabilizers relative to subjects receiving paliperidone ER alone. 
There  were  no  clinically  relevant  differences  in  mean  changes  from  baseline  for  supine  and  standing 
pulse  rate  or  systolic  and  diastolic  blood  pressure  between  the  placebo  and  paliperidone  ER  groups. 
Review of number of subjects with increases in standing and supine pulse rates above limits defined as 
clinically  important,  showed  a  higher  percentage    of  increases  in  paliperidone  ER-treated  subjects 
compared  with  placebo  (eg  15%  and  9%  for  standing  pulse  rate  in  the  total  paliperidone  ER  and 
placebo groups, respectively). 
• 
Other safety findings 
Extrapyramidal Symptom (EPS)-Related Adverse Events 
The  overall  incidence  of  EPS-related  AEs  was  higher  in  paliperidone  treated  subjects  (19.8%)  than  in 
placebo-treated  subjects  (10.9%),  corresponding  to  e.g.  parkinsonism,  hyperkinesias,  tremor  and 
dystonia.  All  treatment-emergent  EPS-related  adverse  events  were  considered  by  the  investigator  to 
be  mild  or  moderate  in  severity,  except  dystonia  (n=1,  placebo)  and  tremor  (n=1,  paliperidone  ER 
flexible dose group). None was reported as a serious AE. 
Suicidality 
There  were  no  reports  of  completed  suicide  in  either  study.  Suicidality  during  the  double-blind  phase 
was reported by 3% of placebo-treated and 0.5% of paliperidone ER-treated subjects. Six subjects in 
the  placebo  group  experienced  suicidal  ideation  that  was  considered  mild  (n=2),  moderate  (n=2),  or 
severe  (n=2).  One  subject  in  the  paliperidone  ER  low  dose  group  experienced  suicidal  behavior  that 
was  considered  severe,  and  1  subject  in  the  paliperidone  ER  high  dose  group  experienced  suicidal 
ideation that was moderate in severity. 
Depression 
The depressed mood and depression experienced by the placebo- and paliperidone ER-treated subjects 
were mild or moderate in severity.Overview of the AEs are presented in Table 22.

Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome 
No cases of neuroleptic malignant syndrome were reported in either study. 
Potentially Prolactin-Related Events 
Mean changes from baseline in serum prolactin levels were greater in paliperidone ER-treated subjects 
than  placebo  and  greater  in  paliperidone  ER-treated  females  than  in  paliperidone  ER-treated  males. 
Prolactin-related  adverse  events  occurred  in  2.1  %  of  paliperidone  ER-treated  subjects  and  more 
frequently  in  females  (6  of  9  cases)  than  in  males.  All  potentially  prolactin-related  events  were 
considered mild or moderate in severity. No subject discontinued. Three of the 10 potentially prolactin-
related adverse events (ie, erectile dysfunction in 1 male and galactorrhoea in 2 females) were noted 
as persisting. The remaining 7 adverse events resolved. 
Glucose-Related Events 
The  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  glucose-related  adverse  events  was  (<1%)  and  corresponded 
with  the  general  lack  of  clinically  significant  changes  in  blood  glucose  levels.  Two  subjects  in  the 
paliperidone ER flexible dose group experienced blood glucose increased (blood glucose value of 13.9 
mmol/L at 6 weeks; normal range of 3.6 to 7.7 mmol/L) and hyperglycaemia (blood glucose value of 
17.3 mmol/L at 6 weeks), respectively. Both events were considered to be moderate in severity.  
Weight-related events  
Weight-related  TEAEs  were  reported  for  8.1%  of  paliperidone  ER-treated  subjects  and  2.5%  of 
placebo-treated  subjects.  It  included  weight  increased  (4.0%  of  paliperidone  vs.  1.5%  for  placebo), 
increased appetite (2.4% vs. 0.5%, respectively), neither of which increased in frequency with dose.

Weight decrease was reported as well (1.0%  paliperidone vs. none on placebo) ; decreased appetite 
(1.4%  versus  0.5%,  respectively).  All  except  one  (weight  increased  in  one  female  subject  on 
paliperidone  ER  flexible  dose)  were  considered  mild  or  moderate  in  severity.  No  subject  discontinued 
study treatment due to a weight-related TEAE. 
In  addition,  paliperidone  ER-treated  subjects  with  a  screening  BMI  of  30  kg/m2  or  greater  (obese) 
gained more weight at end point than paliperidone ER-treated subjects with a screening BMI less than 
25 kg/m2 (normal) or 25 to less than 30 kg/m2 (overweight). A higher percentage of paliperidone ER-
treated subjects (5%) had an increase in body weight of 7% or greater than placebo-treated subjects 
(1%),  and  the  increase  in  body  weight  of  7%  or  more  was  dose  related  (3%  low  dose  vs.  7%  high 
dose group); with a 1% incidence in the placebo group. 
Cardiovascular Effects: Proarrhythmic Potential 
There was 1 subject on paliperidone ER low dose group who experienced a grand mal convulsion that 
was considered severe. There were no other TEAEs suggestive of proarrhythmic potential. 
Electrocardiograms 
Increases of 30 to 60 msec from average predose values in corrected QTcLD intervals at endpoint were 
reported for 2.6% of paliperidone ER-treated subjects compared with 0.6% of subjects in the placebo 
group. No subject experienced an increase in QTcLD interval greater than 60 msec.

Discussion on clinical safety 
Short  term  safety  data  from  the  two  Phase  3  studies  with  paliperidone  ER  in  patients  with 
schizoaffective  disorder  do  not  reveal  any  new  safety  concerns,  compared  with  what  is  known  from 
previous studies with paliperidone and from experience with risperidone. Interim data from an ongoing 
open  label  Phase  3b  study  in  114  subjects  with  schizophrenia  or  schizoaffective  disorder  and  hepatic 
disease were also analysed.   
In the two phase 3 studies, events more frequently reported for paliperidone compared with placebo, 
were  in  the  Nervous  system  disorders  SOC  (39.8%  vs. 27.7%,  respectively)  and  the  Gastrointestinal 
disorders  SOC  (24.5%  vs.  19.8%,  respectively).  With respect  to  common  TEAEs,  tremor,  hypertonia, 
somnolence,  and  dyspepsia  occurred  at  higher  incidences  (more  than  3%)  in  paliperidone  ER-treated 
subjects compared with placebo. Also events such as akathisia, dizziness, sedation and dystonia, were 
among commonly reported events, more frequently seen in paliperidone groups.  
The  incidence  of  SAEs  was  higher  for  placebo  (6.9%)  vs.  the  total  paliperidone  group  (5.5%),  and 
higher for paliperidone ER low dose (9.3%) compared with the high dose (2.0%). Most SAEs appeared 
in the Psychiatric disorders SOC (19 of 27).  
Among  events  of  special interest,  the  overall incidence  of  EPS-related  AEs  was  higher  in  paliperidone 
treated  subjects  (19.8%)  than  in  placebo-treated  subjects  (10.9%),  corresponding  to  e.g. 
parkinsonism, hyperkinesias, tremor and dystonia. Regarding prolactin, mean changes from baseline in 
serum  prolactin  levels  were  greater  in  paliperidone  ER-treated  subjects  than  placebo  and  greater  in 
paliperidone  ER-treated  females  than  in  paliperidone  ER-treated  males.  Prolactin-related  adverse 
events  occurred  in  2.1 % of  paliperidone  ER-treated  subjects  and  more  frequently  in  females  (6 of  9 
cases)  than  in  males.  As  expected,  weight  increase  occurred  more  frequently  in  paliperidone  treated 
subjects, compared with placebo.  
When  comparing  the  overall  reporting  of  adverse  events  across  regions,  there  was  a  difference 
between European patients (180 of 622 subjects were from Romania, Russia  and Ukraine) and those 
from  the  USA  and  Rest  of  the  World,  with  lower  frequencies  reported  by  EU-patients.  This  was  also

observed  for  paliperidone  ER-treated  subjects,  since  adverse  events  were  reported  by  a  higher 
percentage of subjects at non-European sites (78.3%) compared with European sites (43.0%).  
However,  a  dose-relationship  was  found  for  a  significant  number  of  ADRs  (e.g  .  toothache, 
pharyngolaryngeal pain, galactorrhoea, tremor, akathisia, somnolence, nausea, dyspepsia, constipation, 
insomnia, asthenia, nasopharyngitis, myalgia, increased appetite).  
Additionally,  significant  effect  related  to  concomitant  medication  on  the  rate  of  ADRs  was  observed. 
This information was subsequently reflected in the SPC. 
Furthermore, the CHMP required further long-term safety to confirm above findings beyond a six week 
observation  period.  To  address  this  major  concern,  the  MAH  referred  to  studies  with  the  mother 
compound risperidone in which bipolar as well as schizoaffective patients have been studied (RSI-INT-
57,  RIS-BIP-302),  taking  into  account  that  categories  and  dosages  of  medications  used  most 
frequently in these populations are similar.  
In Study RIS-INT-57, which included 110 patients with schizoaffective disorder and 561 patients with 
schizophrenia,  long-acting  risperdone  was  administered  every  second  week  for  12  months. 
Concomitant  treatment  was  allowed  and  among  the  patients  with  schizoaffective  disorder  48% 
received  antidepressants  and  49%  received  mood  stabilizers.  No  unexpected  safety  issue  was 
identified and overall the safety profile was comparable for the two diagnoses. There was no tendency 
of increasing safety problems over time (81 of the patients with schizoaffective disorder remained on 
treatment for the entire study period). 
In 12 months study (RIS-BIP-302) in bipolar depression long-acting risperidone (n=72) was compared 
to  placebo  as  add-on  to  treatment  as  usual,  which  in  the  risperidone  group  included  antidepressants 
(31%)  and  mood  stabilizers  (90%).  Overall  the  safety  pattern  was  as  expected  for  risperidone  with 
tremor (24%), insomnia (19%), and muscle rigidity (11%) being the most frequent events. Compared 
to  placebo  the  total  incidence  of  treatment  emergent  adverse  events  was  lower  and  with  respect  to 
severity fewer events were moderate or severe. 
Overall, the CHMP considered these data reassuring and supportive of the safety profile of paliperidone 
ER  in  the  proposed  indication,  taking  into  account  the  comparative  PK  data  of  paliperidone  versus 
risperidone.  More  than  100  patients  have  been  treated  for  12  months  concomitantly  with 
antidepressants  and/or  mood  stabilizers  and  risperidone  in  doses  comparable  to  or  higher  than  the 
recommended dose range for paliperidone in schizoaffective disorder.  
No  new  safety  issue  has  been  identified  and  no  major  increased  incidence  of  treatment  emerging 
adverse  events  has  been  observed.  However,  the  CHMP  considered  that  data  on  safety  and  efficacy 
during long-term treatment with paliperidone was desirable to confirm the findings of the other studies 
conducted  with  the  mother  compound,  risperidone.  In  addition,  the  CHMP  recommended  to  align  the 
safety  information  regarding  hyperprolactinaemia  with  the  approved  SPC  for  long  acting  risperidone 
injection. The CHMP also recommended further revision of the proposed SPC information related to EPS. 
During  the  oral  explanation  held  on  20  July  2010,  the  MAH  provided  further  data  on  depressive 
switches  with  paliperidone  ER.  In  pivotal  studies  (SCA-3001  and  SCA-3002),  the  incidence  of  such 
event was 6.1% (8/132) versus 11.3% (8/71) in paliperidone ER and placebo groups, respectively. In 
study  BIM-3004,  the  incidence  was  7.2%  (44/563)  and  6.2%  (9/146)  in  paliperidone  ER  and 
olanzapine  groups,  respectively.  The  MAH  concluded  that  there  was  no  evidence  for  increased 
depressive switches with paliperidone ER.  
However,  in  the  absence  of  comparative  data  on  such  event  with  other  antipsychotics,  the  CHMP 
recommended  to  include  a  warning  on  possible  switch  to  depression,  given  the  effect  on  depressive 
symptom of paliperidone ER has not been established in the intended population.

risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information.  
1.3.5 User Consultation 
The MAH referred to the Readability Testing of the paliperidone tablets Package Leaflet (PL) conducted 
during the assessment of the initial marketing authorisation application.  
The MAH considered that minor changes have been proposed in the PL. Since the change mainly relate 
to  the  adverse  drug  reactions  listing  in  the  PL  and  that  the  layout  is  not  significantly  changed,  this 
justification was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.  BENEFIT RISK ASSESSMENT 
2.1 Benefits 
Paliperidone  ER,  the  active  metabolite  of  risperidone,  has  earlier  been  approved  for  treatment  of 
schizophrenia  based  on  studies  demonstrating  efficacy  in  acute  short-term  treatment  as  well  as 
maintenance  of  effect.  To  fulfil  the  regulatory  requirements  for  the  additional  claim  schizoaffective 
disorder the MAH has performed specific studies in that patient population.  
In two placebo-controlled short-term studies statistically significant effect in favour of paliperidone ER 
for  the  primary  endpoint  PANSS  Total  score  was  shown.  The  clinical  relevance  of  the  results  is 
illustrated  in  responder  analyses  showing  differences  versus  placebo  of  22  and  12.5  %-units  for  the 
two studies, respectively. The validity of these effects for schizoaffective patients are substantiated in 
analyses of secondary endpoints, including PANSS-24 which consist of the PANSS items corresponding 
to the DSM-IV criteria for schizoaffective disorder, and clinically relevant reductions of depressive and 
manic symptoms in patients with pronounced affective symptoms at baseline.  
In the pooled analysis, clinically relevant effects on PANSS and YMRS total scores were demonstrated 
in  patients  comedicated  with  mood  stabilizers  only  and  in  patients  with  antidepressants  only.  In 
subgroup  analyses  of  the  pooled  studies,  highly  significant  effects  on  PANSS  and  YMRS  total  scores 
have  been  demonstrated  for  patients  with  prominent  manic  symptoms,  prominent  depressive 
symptoms,  as  well  as  in  patients  with  prominent  mixed  symptoms.  The  magnitude  of  effect  for  all 
endpoints  was  considered  by  the  CHMP  clinically  relevant  and  comparable  to  other  studies  of  acute 
treatment  in  schizophrenia,  manic  episodes  associated  with  bipolar  I  disorder  and  major  depressive 
episodes, respectively. As expected the effect on manic symptoms is less pronounced in patients with 
prominent depressive symptoms.

Maintenance  of  effect  has  not  been  specifically  studied  with  paliperidone  ER  in  patients  with 
schizoaffective  disorder.  The  CHMP  has  also  identified  that  effects  on  depressive  symptoms  has  not 
been demonstrated.  
Having  considered  the  SAG  conclusions  and  the  oral  explanation  provided  by  the  MAH,  the  CHMP 
recommended the following indication: 
“INVEGA  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  psychotic  or  manic  symptoms  of  schizoaffective 
disorder. Effect on depressive symptoms has not been demonstrated." 
On  the  basis  of  the  available  data,  the  CHMP  also  recommended  to  include in  section  4.2  of  the  SPC 
related to schizoaffective disorder that “Maintenance of  effect has not been studied”.

2.2 Risks 
In the clinical program for schizoaffective disorder 420 patients have been treated with paliperdone ER. 
The safety profile in this indication is as expected from the studies in schizophrenia and acute mania 
associated with bipolar I disorder as well as from the overall safety database for the mother compound 
risperidone. No new safety concerns have been identified.  
However, the CHMP required further long-term safety to confirm the above findings beyond a six week 
observation  period.  To  address  this  major  concern,  the  MAH  referred  to  studies  with  the  mother 
compound risperidone in which bipolar as well as schizoaffective patients have been studied (RSI-INT-
57,  RIS-BIP-302),  taking  into  account  that  categories  and  dosages  of  medications  used  most 
frequently in these populations are similar. 
Overall, the CHMP considered these data reassuring and supportive of the safety profile of paliperidone 
ER  in  the  proposed  indication,  taking  into  account  the  comparative  PK  data  of  paliperidone  versus 
risperidone.  More  than  100  patients  have  been  treated  for  12  months  concomitantly  with 
antidepressants  and/or  mood  stabilizers  and  risperidone  in  doses  comparable  to  or  higher  than  the 
recommended  dose  range  for  paliperidone  in  schizoaffective  disorder.  No  new  safety  issue  has  been 
identified and no major increased incidence of treatment emerging adverse events has been observed. 
However, the CHMP recommended to align the safety information regarding hyperprolactinaemia with 
the approved SPC for long acting risperidone injection. The CHMP also recommended further revision of 
the proposed SPC information related to EPS. 
A  dose-relationship  was  also 
found 
for  a  significant  number  of  ADRs  (e.g 
.toothache, 
pharyngolaryngeal pain, galactorrhoea, tremor, akathisia, somnolence, nausea, dyspepsia, constipation, 
insomnia, asthenia, nasopharyngitis, myalgia, increased appetite).  
Additionally,  significant  effect  related  to  concomitant  medication  on  the  rate  of  ADRs  was  observed. 
This information was subsequently reflected in the SPC. 
A  long-term  maintenance  study  has  been  agreed  to  be  conducted  by  the  MAH,  which  will  further 
provide long-term safety data in this population. 
2.3 Balance 
In the overall study population, clinically relevant effects on psychotic and manic symptoms have been 
demonstrated in schizoaffective disorder that with respect to severity compares well with schizophrenia 
and no additional safety concerns have been identified.  
However,  no  specific  long-term  data  on  paliperidone  are  available  to  confirm  the  maintenance 
treatment.  In addition, effect on depressive symptoms has not been demonstrated.  
A  long-term  maintenance  study  has  been  agreed  to  be  conducted  by  the  MAH,  as  part  of  the  risk 
management plan. 
3.  Conclusion 
On 18 November 2010, the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the 
amendments  to  be  introduced  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics,  Annex  II  and  Package 
Leaflet. 
Furthermore,  the  CHMP  reviewed  the  data  submitted  by  the  applicant  taking  into  account  the 
provisions of Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004 and considered the indication to be new

1. Introduction 
Paliperidone  (R076477)  is  a  monoaminergic  antagonist  with  a  high  affinity  for  serotoninergic  (5-
hydroxytryptamine  type  2A)  and  dopaminergic  D2  receptors.  Paliperidone  (9-hydroxyrisperidone)  is 
the  major  active  metabolite  of  risperidone.  The  controlled  release of  paliperidone  from  the  extended-
release formulation results in slower absorption of paliperidone than an immediate-release formulation, 
steadily  rising  plasma  concentrations  on  the  first  day  of  dosing,  and  reduced  fluctuations  in  plasma 
concentrations at steady state. 
Invega was first granted a marketing authorisation in the EU on 25 June 2007 for the treatment of 
schizophrenia in adults. 
In  September  2009  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  submitted  an  application  for  a  Type  II 
variation (EMEA/H/C/746/II/23) to include the new indication “Treatment of schizoaffective disorder as 
monotherapy or in combination with mood stabilisers and/or antidepressants” for Invega.  
In the initial assessment of the variation application, the CHMP raised major objections on both efficacy 
and safety as well as a  number of other concerns.  Based on the outcome of Central Nervous System 
Scientific  Advisory  Group  (SAG-CNS)  and  CHMP  assessment,  the  applicant    amended  the  proposed 
indication  as  follows:  “INVEGA  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  psychotic  or  manic  symptoms  of 
schizoaffective disorder. Effect on depressive symptoms has not been demonstrated."  
In accordance with the provisions of Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the MAH applied 
for an extended marketing protection period for Invega in the context of the current Type II variation. 
The  request  is  based  on  the  MAH’s  position  that  the  approval  of  paliperidone  PR  in  the  sought 
indication  will  offer  significant  clinical  benefit  compared  with  existing  therapies  since  no  other 
medications are currently approved for the treatment of schizoaffective disorder in the EU. 
2. Justification of significant clinical benefit as presented by the applicant 
Proposed new indication as compared to already authorised indication 
Schizoaffective disorder is a common, chronic, and disabling mental illness associated with significant 
impairment of functioning. Schizoaffective disorder is recognized in both the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual, 4th edition (DSM-IV) and the International Classification of Disease, 10th Revision (ICD-10) as 
a  distinct  diagnostic  entity  (APA  2000;  WHO  1993),  with  clinical  features,  course,  and  outcome 
differing  from  schizophrenia  (Lake  2007,  Cheniaux  2008,  Peralta  2008).  Schizoaffective  disorder 
includes the signs and symptoms of a manic episode and/or a major depressive episode, in addition to 
the  presence  of  symptoms  consistent  with  schizophrenia.  Nevertheless,  the  clinical  features  of 
schizoaffective  disorder  differ  from  bipolar  disorder  and  schizophrenia  in  important  ways,  including 
prognosis  and  approaches  to  treatment.  Compared  with  subjects  with  schizophrenia,  subjects  with 
schizoaffective disorder show a higher risk of substance abuse, higher hospitalisation rates, and higher 
suicide rates (Cheniaux 2008, Olfson 2009, Radomsky, 1999). 
According  to  DSM-IV,  a  diagnosis  of  schizoaffective  disorder  is  made  when  the  symptom  criteria  for 
schizophrenia  are  met  and  during  the  same  continuous  period  there  is  a  major  depressive  episode, 
manic  episode,  or  mixed  episode.  During  that  same  period,  symptoms  that  meet  Criterion  A  for 
schizophrenia  (ie,  2  or  more  of  the  following:  hallucinations,  delusions,  disorganised  speech,  grossly 
disorganised or catatonic behavior, or negative symptoms) must be present for at least 2 weeks in the 
absence  of  prominent  mood  symptoms  (APA  2000).  Diagnostic  criteria  for  schizoaffective  disorder 
according  to  ICD-10  are  slightly  more  inclusive  than  DSM-IV  criteria,  and  include  persons  in  whom 
definite  schizophrenic  and  definite  affective  symptoms  are  prominent  simultaneously,  or  within  a  few 
days  of  each  other,  within  the  same  episode  of  illness,  and  for  whom  the  episode  does  not  meet 
criteria for either schizophrenia or a depressive or manic episode (WHO 1993). 
In  an  analysis  of  Medicaid  claims  data  from  2  U.S. states  focusing  on  over  55,000  adults  treated  for 
schizoaffective  disorder  or  schizophrenia,  roughly  one-third  were  treated  for  schizoaffective  disorder 
(Olfson  2009).  In  this  analysis  patients  with  schizoaffective  disorder  were  significantly  more  likely  to 
receive cotreatment for substance use or for an anxiety, depressive, bipolar, or other mental disorder 
during the prestudy period (Olfson 2009). Similar to previous reports, the patients with schizoaffective 
disorder were also significantly more likely to be treated with mood stabilisers, antidepressants, and/or 
anxiolytics. Furthermore, patients with schizoaffective disorder were significantly more likely to receive

psychotherapy. This analysis supports the current diagnostic classification that regards schizoaffective 
disorder  and  schizophrenia  as  distinct  diagnostic  entities  and  suggests  a  more  complicated  clinical 
course and more complex treatment needs in patients with schizoaffective disorder.  
Given  the  complex  medication  regimens  often  utilised  in  schizoaffective  disorder,  these  patients  may 
be at particularly high risk for cytochrome P450-mediated drug-drug interactions, especially when co-
administering certain antipsychotic and antidepressant medications. In addition, it has been suggested 
that  patients  with  affective  symptoms  may  be  more  vulnerable  to  the  extrapyramidal  side  effects 
associated with antipsychotic medications (Gao 2008). 
Details of existing therapies related to the proposed new indication 
There  are  no  medications  approved  for  use  in  schizoaffective  disorder  in  the  EU  to  the  applicant’s 
knowledge.  Furthermore,  no  treatments  have  been  systematically  studied  in  patients  with 
schizoaffective  disorder  nor  are  there  any  widely  accepted  guidelines  for  the  treatment  of  this 
condition.  Nonetheless,  patients  with  schizoaffective  disorder  are  often  prescribed  complex 
pharmacological  regimens  as  clinicians  attempt  to  manage  the  psychotic  and  affective  symptoms 
(Malhi 2005). 
Therefore,  despite  the  widespread  use  of  antipsychotics  alone  or  in  combination  with  antidepressants 
and/or  mood  stabilisers  in  the  treatment  of  schizoaffective  disorder,  there  are  little  data  (aside  from 
that  contained  within  the  current  application)  that  support  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  this  practice. 
While off-label uses are legal and in many instances may be in the best interest of patients, they have 
not received the same degree of independent scrutiny through randomised clinical trials as agents that 
have been approved by Regulatory authorities (Pickar 2008). 
Significant clinical benefit based on improved efficacy as presented by the applicant 
The efficacy and safety of paliperidone PR has been shown in 2 adequately powered and well-controlled 
Phase  3  clinical  studies  in  subjects  with  schizoaffective  disorder  (R076477-SCA-3001  and  R076477-
SCA-3002;  hereafter  referred  to  as  SCA-3001  and  SCA-3002,  respectively).  These  data  were  further 
supported  by  results  from  2  completed  Phase  1  drug  interaction  studies  (R076477-BIM-1003  and 
R076477-BIM-1004; hereafter referred to as BIM-1003 and BIM-1004).  
The  2  Phase  3  trials  (SCA-3001  and  SCA-3002)  included  adult  subjects  with  a  Structured  Clinical 
Interview  for  DSM-IV  Disorders  (SCID)-confirmed  DSM-IV  diagnosis  of  schizoaffective  disorder  who 
were experiencing an acute exacerbation. In SCA-3001, patients were assigned to 1 of 2 dose levels of 
paliperidone: a low-dose group (6 mg/day with the option to reduce to 3 mg/day) or a high-dose group 
(12 mg/day with the option to reduce to 9 mg/day). In SCA-3002, patients received flexible doses of 
paliperidone (3-12 mg/day, starting at 6 mg/day). 
In  addition  to  study  medication,  subjects  were  permitted  to  receive  concomitant  treatment  with  a 
mood  stabiliser  and/or  antidepressant,  provided  these  medications  had  been  given  at  a  stable  dose 
within 30 days of screening. Approximately half the subjects enrolled received ongoing treatment with 
a  mood  stabiliser  and/or  antidepressant  during  the  studies.  Therefore,  the  study  populations  were 
representative  of  the  patient  population  likely  to  be  treated  with  paliperidone  PR  in  clinical  practice. 
Randomisation was stratified by site and by treatment with concomitant medications (antidepressants 
and/or mood stabilisers) vs. no concomitant treatment with those medications. 
Efficacy  was  evaluated  using  the  positive  and  negative  symptom  scale  (PANSS),  as  validated  multi-
item inventory composed of 5 factors to evaluate positive symptoms, negative symptoms, disorganised 
thoughts,  uncontrolled  hostility/excitement,  and  anxiety/depression.  As  secondary  outcomes,  mood 
symptoms  were  evaluated  using  the  Hamilton  Depression  Rating  Scale  (HAM-D-21)  and  the  Young 
Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). 
The findings of the Phase 3 studies SCA-3001 and SCA-3002 have provided evidence for the efficacy of 
paliperidone PR in the treatment of schizoaffective disorder  
Studies  SCA-3001  and  SCA-3002  showed  superior  efficacy  of  paliperidone  PR  high  dose  (12  mg/day, 
with  option  to  reduce  to  9  mg/day)  and  paliperidone  PR  in  a  flexible-dose  range  of  3  to  12  mg/day 
(starting  dose  6  mg/day)  to  placebo  on  the  primary  efficacy  variable  (change  from  baseline  to  end 
point in PANSS total score), as well as on other efficacy endpoints including the YMRS and HAM-D-21 
in  subjects  with  prominent  mania  and  depression,  respectively.  In  subgroup  analyses  of  the  pooled

studies,  paliperidone  PR  was  effective  when  used  both  as  monotherapy  and  when  administered  with 
concomitant  antidepressants  and/or  mood  stabilisers.  Overall,  there  was  a  small  mean  numerical

receiving  paliperidone  PR  monotherapy  vs  combination 
in  patients 
Efficacy on PANSS, YMRS, and HAM-D-21 scores was demonstrated regardless of baseline mood status. 
In  subgroup  analyses  of  the  pooled  studies,  highly  significant  effects  were  demonstrated  for  patients 
with prominent manic symptoms (YMRS total score ≥16), prominent depressive symptoms (HAM-D-21 
total score ≥16), or mixed symptoms (both YMRS and HAM-D-21 total scores ≥16) at baseline.  
These findings were further supported by improvements in other secondary efficacy variables such as 
the change in the PANSS  24-item score corresponding to DSM-IV criteria for  schizoaffective disorder, 
PANSS subscales and factor scores, and global impressions of illness (CGI-S-SCA and CGI-C-SCA).  
The improvement in the PANSS total score and the change in the severity of illness were of significant 
magnitude  to  be  clinically  meaningful.  After  6  weeks  of  treatment,  a  greater  proportion  of  subjects 
treated with paliperidone PR than with placebo were treatment responders. The efficacy of paliperidone 
PR was independent of the demographic characteristics age, sex, race, or geographic location, as well 
as of baseline affective symptomatology. 
Significant clinical benefit based on improved safety as presented by the applicant 
Paliperidone  PR  is  an  atypical  antipsychotic  approved  for  the  treatment  of  schizophrenia,  with  over 
150,000 patient-years of postmarketing exposure worldwide. 
The  clinical  development  program  of  paliperidone  PR  in  the  treatment  of  schizoaffective  disorder 
included  2  completed  Phase  3  studies,  in  which  420  subjects  with  schizoaffective  disorder  were 
exposed  to  paliperidone  PR  for  a  total  of  39.3  subject-years;  a  Phase  1  drug  interaction  study  in 
healthy men in which 24 subjects were exposed to paliperidone PR for a total of 0.13 subject-years; a 
Phase  1  drug  interaction  study  in  subjects  with  schizophrenia,  bipolar  I  disorder,  or  schizoaffective 
disorder in which 16 subjects were exposed to paliperidone PR for a total of 0.21 subject-years; and an 
ongoing  Phase  3b  study  in  subjects  with  schizophrenia  or  schizoaffective  disorder  and  with  hepatic 
disease in which 84 subjects were exposed to paliperidone PR for 6.89 subject-years through the cutoff 
date.  
The  comprehensive  safety  data  of  1,107.00  subject-years  in  2,054  individual subjects  in  the  Phase  3 
clinical  development  program  of  paliperidone  PR  in  schizophrenia  complements  the  safety  data  from 
clinical studies of paliperidone PR in the new indication.  
Paliperidone  PR,  administered  in  daily  doses  ranging  from  3  to  12  mg,  either  as  monotherapy  or  in 
combination with antidepressants and/or mood stabilisers, was generally well tolerated for a period of 
6  weeks  in  the  2  double-blind  placebo-controlled  studies  SCA-3001  and  SCA-3002.  There  were  no 
deaths in either Phase 3 study, in either Phase 1 study, or in the ongoing Phase 3b study through the 
cutoff date.  
There was no difference between the paliperidone PR and placebo groups with respect to the incidence 
of suicidality-related adverse events in the completed Phase 3 schizoaffective disorder studies. Adverse 
events  related  to  depression  were  infrequent  and  occurred  in  numerically  fewer  paliperidone  PR-
treated than placebo-treated subjects.  
Extrapyramidal  symptoms  have  been  associated  with  atypical  antipsychotics  in  patients  with 
schizoaffective  disorder  (Janicak  2001,  Keck  2001).  There  were  no  reports  of  tardive  dyskinesia  or 
neuroleptic  malignant  syndrome  in  the  4  completed  studies.  In  the  Phase  3  studies,  extrapyramidal 
symptom-related adverse events and concomitant use of anticholinergic medications were reported at 
higher  rates  in  subjects  treated  with  paliperidone  PR  compared  to  placebo.  In  SCA-3001, 
anticholinergic  medications  were  used  more  frequently  in  the  paliperidone  PR  high  dose  group 
compared with the low dose group. The EPS-related adverse events were usually mild and usually did 
not lead to withdrawal, and none was serious. These findings are consistent with the data from Phase 3 
studies of paliperidone PR in the treatment of schizophrenia.  
Consistent  with  the  findings  of  the  clinical  program  in  schizophrenia,  ECG  data  did  not  suggest  an 
increased cardiovascular risk with paliperidone PR in the dose range of 3 to 12 mg. No adverse events 
of  ventricular  fibrillation  and  flutter  or  torsade  de  pointes  occurred  during  any  of  the  completed 
studies.

With  the  exception  of  mostly  asymptomatic  increases  in  serum  prolactin  levels,  changes  in  clinical 
laboratory  test  values  in  subjects  receiving  paliperidone  PR  for  up  to  6  weeks  were  transient,  largely 
asymptomatic,  and  considered  not  clinically  relevant.  Limited  weight  gain  was  observed  in  subjects 
treated with paliperidone PR; a dose-related trend in weight gain was apparent in SCA-3001.  
A greater proportion of subjects receiving paliperidone PR in combination with mood stabilisers and/or 
antidepressants  experienced  at  least  one  adverse  event  as  compared  to  those  subjects  receiving 
monotherapy. There was  also a higher incidence of adverse events in placebo-treated subjects in the 
combination  therapy  stratum  compared  to  placebo-treated  subjects  receiving  monotherapy.  This 
suggests  that  in  subjects  treated  with  combination  therapy  (paliperidone  PR  plus  antidepressants 
and/or mood stabilisers), a considerable number of the adverse events observed may be related to the 
antidepressant and/or mood stabiliser rather than paliperidone PR. There were no other differences of 
clinical  concern  in  the  safety  and  tolerability  profile  of  paliperidone  PR  given  alone  or  in  combination 
with antidepressants and/or mood stabilisers.  
Psychiatric disorders that were serious or led to discontinuation of study drug occurred more frequently 
in subjects in the paliperidone PR low dose group receiving concomitant antidepressants and/or mood 
stabilisers. This may potentially have been due to less effective control of psychiatric disorders in the 
low dose group compared to the high dose and flexible dose groups, as well as more severe illness in 
subjects receiving antidepressants and/or mood stabilisers at enrollment. 
Significant clinical benefit based on major contribution to patient care as presented by the applicant 
As  summarised  above,  paliperidone  PR  has  demonstrated  a  favorable  benefit-risk  profile  in  the 
treatment  of  schizoaffective  disorder  in  2  large,  well-controlled  Phase  3  studies.  The  population 
included in these studies were well-defined using current diagnostic criteria and reflective of the real-
world setting, in that they were receiving an atypical antipsychotic alone or in combination with mood 
stabilisers and/or antidepressants.  
These  studies  represent  the  first  large-scale,  placebo-controlled  studies  conducted  in  patients  with 
schizoaffective disorder. No other agent has been studied in this population in such a rigorous manner. 
Therefore, the key benefit paliperidone PR offers over other medications is that it is the only agent that 
has demonstrated efficacy and safety in schizoaffective disorder according to current standards.  
The  Sponsor  conducted  a  review  of  the  literature  to  explore  the  efficacy  of  paliperidone  PR  versus 
other  agents  in  the  treatment  of  schizoaffective  disorder.  Consistent  with  findings  of  other  literature 
reviews  (Levinson  1999,  Keck  1999,  Jäger  2010),  no  other  large-scale,  prospective,  well  controlled 
studies were identified during the Sponsor’s review of the literature.  
Therefore,  it  is  not  possible  to  make  meaningful  comparisons  between  paliperidone  PR  and  other 
agents in the treatment of schizoaffective disorder. Of  note, most of the studies identified during the 
search  evaluated  the  efficacy  of  antipsychotics  and  mood  stabilisers  as  monotherapy,  which  is  not 
reflective of  clinical  practice.  Only  2  double-blind,  randomised,  controlled  studies  involving  adjunctive 
treatment  of  an  antipsychotic  with  an  antidepressant  or  mood  stabiliser  were  identified  during  the 
Sponsor’s review (Brockington 1978, Okuma 1989). 
MAH’s overall conclusion supporting significant clinical benefit 
Schizoaffective disorder is a serious, disabling, and persistent mental illness associated with significant 
impairment of functioning and a high lifetime risk of suicide. The loss of life and disability due to severe 
impairment  of  functioning  in  patients  with  schizoaffective  disorder  results  in  a  substantial  cost-of-
illness  burden  to  society.  Despite  the  significance  of  this  condition,  current  therapies  have  not  been 
studied  in  adequate  and  well-controlled  clinical  trials  and  there  are  no  European  Agency-approved 
medications for the treatment of this illness. 
There  is  a  need  for  efficacious  treatments  of  schizoaffective  disorder  with  a  favourable  benefit-risk 
balance.  As  documented  in  the  current  application  (EMEA/H/C/746/II/23),  paliperidone  PR  has 
demonstrated a favorable benefit-risk balance in the acute treatment of psychotic and manic episodes 
of  schizoaffective  disorder  in  2  well-controlled  Phase  3  studies.  These  studies  (SCA-3001  and  SCA-
3002)  represent  the  first  large-scale,  placebo-controlled  studies  in  the  treatment  of  schizoaffective 
disorder. As no other agents are approved for schizoaffective disorder, the approval of paliperidone PR 
in  this  indication  would  represent  a  significant  and  clinically  meaningful  contribution  to  patient  care, 
allowing clinicians to make evidence-based decisions when considering treatment choices.

3. Assessment of the applicant’s justification of significant clinical benefit   
Proposed new indication 
Taking  into  account  the  provisions  of  the  “Guidance  on  elements  required  to  support  the  significant 
clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies of a new therapeutic indication in order to benefit 
from  an  extended  (11-year)  marketing  protection  period  (November  2007)”,  the  CHMP  is  of  the 
opinion that the proposed new indication: ”INVEGA is indicated for the treatment of psychotic or manic 
symptoms  of  schizoaffective  disorder. Effect  on  depressive  symptoms  has  not  been  demonstrated."  
can be considered as a new therapeutic indication. 
Details of existing therapies related to the proposed new indication

Psychotherapy

psychotherapy is generally used in association with pharmacological treatment and therefore does not 
constitute alone an existing therapeutic alternative.  
is  recognised  as  a  non-pharmacological  approach 
to 
The CHMP considered therefore that no existing therapies are currently available for this new 
indication. 
Significant clinical benefit based on improved efficacy 
In the overall study population, clinically relevant effects on psychotic and manic symptoms have been 
demonstrated in the new indication for schizoaffective disorder, a disease that with respect to severity 
compares well with schizophrenia. However, the data provided to support the long-term maintenance 
of effect were questioned by the CHMP.  
In light of the concern related to extrapolation of long term data to support the long-term maintenance 
of  the  effect  of  paliperidone  ER  in  schizoaffective  disorder  and  on  the  basis  of  the  available  data  to 
date,  the  CHMP  agreed  to  convene  a  SAG-CNS  to  discuss  the  need  for  long-term  efficacy  data  for 
paliperidone  in  the  applied  indication.  The  group  was  convinced  that  there  is  good  evidence  of 
maintenance of effect on manic symptoms. However, from the submitted documentation, the SAG was 
not convinced that there is a clinically significant effect on depressive symptoms.  
The MAH concluded that there was no evidence for increased depressive switches with paliperidone PR. 
However,  in  the  absence  of  comparative  data  on  such  event  with  other  antipsychotics,  the  CHMP 
recommended  to  include  a  warning  on  possible  switch  to  depression,  given  the  effect  on  depressive 
symptom of paliperidone PR has not been established in the intended population. 
On the basis of the available data, the CHMP recommended the following indication: “INVEGA is 
indicated for the treatment of psychotic or manic symptoms of schizoaffective disorder. Effect on 
depressive symptoms has not been demonstrated."  
In the absence of existing therapies for the above-mentioned new indication, the CHMP considered that 
there is significant clinical benefit on efficacy for Invega in the targeted population. 
Significant clinical benefit based on improved safety  
In the clinical program for schizoaffective disorder 420 patients have been treated with paliperidone ER. 
The safety profile in this indication is as expected from the studies in schizophrenia and acute mania 
associated with bipolar I disorder as well as from the overall safety database for the mother compound 
risperidone.  
Overall, the CHMP considered the data reassuring and supportive of the safety profile of paliperidone 
ER  in  the  proposed  indication,  taking  into  account  the  comparative  pharmacokinetic  data  of 
paliperidone versus risperidone.  
More  than  100  patients  have  been  treated  for  12  months  concomitantly  with  antidepressants  and/or 
mood stabilizers and risperidone in doses comparable to or higher than the recommended dose range

for  paliperidone  in  schizoaffective  disorder.  No  new  safety  issue  has  been  identified  and  no  major 
increased incidence of treatment emerging adverse events has been observed.  
Overall,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  safety  profile  for  Invega  remains  unchanged.  In  the  absence 
existing  therapies  for  the  above-mentioned  new  indication,  the  CHMP  is  of  the  opinion  that  no 
significant clinical benefit on safety for Invega can be identified at this present time. 
Significant clinical benefit based on major contribution to patient care 
The  CHMP  is  of  the  opinion  that  Invega  is  expected  to  contribute  to  patient  care  as  an  authorised 
medicinal product.  
4. CHMP Conclusion 
Following the overall assessment of the efficacy and safety data provided, the CHMP considers that the 
benefit/risk  ratio  of  Invega  is  positive  for  the  following  indication:  “INVEGA  is  indicated  for  the 
treatment of psychotic or manic symptoms of schizoaffective disorder. Effect on depressive symptoms 
has not been demonstrated."  
In the absence of existing therapies, the CHMP considered that the justification for one additional year 
of marketing protection was valid.  
5. Outcome 
The  CHMP  reviewed  the  data  submitted  by  the  applicant  taking  into  account  the  provisions  of  Article 
14(11)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No.  726/2004,  and  taking  into  account  the  provisions  of  the  “Guidance  on 
elements required to support the significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies of a 
new therapeutic indication in order to benefit from an extended (11-year) marketing protection period 
(November  2007)”,  considered  that  the  new  therapeutic  indication  is  held  to  bring  significant  clinical 
benefit in the absence of existing therapies.

Patient Alert Card 
All prescribers of LIBTAYO should be familiar with the educational materials and inform the patients 
about the Patient Alert Card explaining what to do should they experience any symptom of immune-
mediated adverse reactions and infusion-related reactions. The physician will provide the Patient Alert 
Card to each patient. 
Special populations 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of LIBTAYO in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years have not 
been established. No data are available. 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is recommended for elderly patients. Cemiplimab exposure is similar across all 
age groups (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). Data are limited in patients ≥75 years on cemiplimab 
monotherapy. 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment of LIBTAYO is recommended for patients with renal impairment. There are 
limited data for LIBTAYO in patients with severe renal impairment CLcr 15 to 29 ml/min (see 
section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. 
LIBTAYO has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. There are insufficient data 
in patients with severe hepatic impairment for dosing recommendations (see section 5.2).

Method of administration 
LIBTAYO is for intravenous use. It is administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes through 
an intravenous line containing a sterile, non-pyrogenic, low-protein binding, in-line or add-on filter 
(0.2 micron to 5 micron pore size). 
Other medicinal products should not be co-administered through the same infusion line. 
For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3 
Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4 
Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Immune-mediated adverse reactions 
Severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions have been observed with cemiplimab (see 
section 4.2 and section 4.8). These immune-mediated reactions may involve any organ system. 
Immune-mediated reactions can manifest at any time during treatment with cemiplimab; however, 
immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur after discontinuation of cemiplimab. 
The guidance for immune-mediated adverse reactions applies to cemiplimab whether administered as 
monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy. 
Immune-mediated adverse reactions affecting more than one body system can occur simultaneously, 
such as myositis and myocarditis or myasthenia gravis, in patients treated with cemiplimab or other 
PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. 
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated 
adverse reactions should be managed with cemiplimab treatment modifications, hormone replacement 
therapy (if clinically indicated), and corticosteroids. For suspected immune-mediated adverse 
reactions, patients should be evaluated to confirm an immune-mediated adverse reaction and to 
exclude other possible causes, including infection. Depending upon the severity of the adverse 
reaction, cemiplimab should be withheld or permanently discontinued (see section 4.2). 
Immune-mediated pneumonitis 
Immune-mediated pneumonitis, defined as requiring use of corticosteroids with no clear alternate 
aetiology, including fatal cases, has been observed in patients receiving cemiplimab (see section 4.8). 
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis and causes other than immune-
mediated pneumonitis should be ruled out. Patients with suspected pneumonitis should be evaluated 
with radiographic imaging as indicated based on clinical evaluation and managed with cemiplimab 
treatment modifications and corticosteroids (see section 4.2). 
Immune-mediated colitis 
Immune-mediated diarrhoea or colitis, defined as requiring use of corticosteroids with no clear 
alternate aetiology, has been observed in patients receiving cemiplimab (see section 4.8). Patients 
should be monitored for signs and symptoms of diarrhoea or colitis and managed with cemiplimab 
treatment modifications, anti-diarrhoeal agents, and corticosteroids (see section 4.2). 
Immune-mediated hepatitis 
Immune-mediated hepatitis, defined as requiring use of corticosteroids with no clear alternate 
aetiology, including fatal cases, has been observed in patients receiving cemiplimab (see section 4.8). 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients should be monitored for abnormal liver tests prior to and periodically during treatment as 
indicated based on clinical evaluation and managed with cemiplimab treatment modifications and 
corticosteroids (see section 4.2). 
Immune-mediated endocrinopathies 
Immune-mediated endocrinopathies, defined as treatment-emergent endocrinopathies with no clear 
alternate aetiology, have been observed in patients receiving cemiplimab (see section 4.8). 
Thyroid disorders (Hypothyroidism/Hyperthyroidism/Thyroiditis) 
Immune-mediated thyroid disorders have been observed in patients receiving cemiplimab. Thyroiditis 
can present with or without an alteration in thyroid function tests. Hypothyroidism can follow 
hyperthyroidism. Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during the treatment. Patients should be 
monitored for changes in thyroid function at the start of treatment and periodically during the 
treatment as indicated based on clinical evaluation (see section 4.8). Patients should be managed with 
hormone replacement therapy (if indicated) and cemiplimab treatment modifications. Hyperthyroidism 
should be managed according to standard medical practice (see section 4.2). 
Hypophysitis 
Immune-mediated hypophysitis has been observed in patients receiving cemiplimab (see section 4.8). 
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis and managed with cemiplimab 
treatment modifications, corticosteroids and hormone replacement, as clinically indicated (see 
section 4.2). 
Adrenal insufficiency 
Adrenal insufficiency has been observed in patients receiving cemiplimab (see section 4.8). Patients 
should be monitored for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency during and after treatment and 
managed with cemiplimab treatment modifications, corticosteroids and hormone replacement, as 
clinically indicated (see section 4.2). 
Type 1 Diabetes mellitus 
Immune-mediated type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, has been observed in 
patients receiving cemiplimab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for hyperglycaemia and 
signs and symptoms of diabetes as indicated based on clinical evaluation and managed with oral 
anti-hyperglycaemics or insulin and cemiplimab treatment modifications (see section 4.2).  
Immune-mediated skin adverse reactions 
Immune-mediated skin adverse reactions, defined as requiring use of systemic corticosteroids with no 
clear alternate aetiology, including severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), such as 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal 
outcome), and other skin reactions such as rash, erythema multiforme, pemphigoid, have been reported 
in association with cemiplimab treatment (see section 4.8).  
Patients should be monitored for evidence of suspected severe skin reactions and exclude other causes. 
Patients should be managed with cemiplimab treatment modifications and corticosteroids (see 
section 4.2). For symptoms or signs of SJS or TEN, refer the patient for specialised care for 
assessment and treatment and manage patient with treatment modifications (see section 4.2). 
Cases of SJS, fatal TEN and stomatitis occurred following 1 dose of cemiplimab in patients with prior 
exposure to idelalisib, who were participating in a clinical trial evaluating cemiplimab in Non-Hodgkin 
Lymphoma (NHL), and who had recent exposure to sulfa containing antibiotics (see section 4.8). 
Patients should be managed with cemiplimab treatment modifications and corticosteroids as described 
above (see section 4.2). 
Immune-mediated nephritis 
Immune-mediated nephritis, defined as requiring use of corticosteroids with no clear alternate 
aetiology, including a fatal case, has been observed in patients receiving cemiplimab (see section 4.8). 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Patients should be managed with cemiplimab treatment 
modifications and corticosteroids (see section 4.2). 
Other immune-mediated adverse reactions 
Other fatal and life-threatening  immune-mediated adverse reactions have been observed in patients 
receiving cemiplimab including paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis, meningitis, myositis and 
myocarditis (see section 4.8 for other immune-mediated adverse reactions). 
Noninfective cystitis has been reported with other PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. 
Evaluate suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions to exclude other causes. Patients should be 
monitored for signs and symptoms of immune-mediated adverse reactions and managed with 
cemiplimab treatment modifications and corticosteroids as clinically indicated (see section 4.2 and 
section 4.8). 
Solid organ transplant rejection has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients treated with 
PD-1 inhibitors. Treatment with cemiplimab may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant 
recipients. The benefit of treatment with cemiplimab versus the risk of possible organ rejection should 
be considered in these patients. Cases of graft-versus-host disease have been reported in the post-
marketing setting in patients treated with other PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in association with allogeneic 
haematopoietic stem cell transplant. 
Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) has been reported in patients receiving cemiplimab (see 
section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of HLH. If HLH is 
confirmed, administration of cemiplimab should be discontinued and treatment for HLH initiated (see 
section 4.2). 
Infusion-related reactions 
Cemiplimab can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions (see section 4.8). Patients 
should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions and managed with 
cemiplimab treatment modifications and corticosteroids. Cemiplimab should be interrupted or the rate 
of infusion slowed for mild or moderate infusion-related reactions. The infusion should be stopped and 
cemiplimab should be permanently discontinued for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) 
infusion-related reactions (see section 4.2). 
Patients excluded from clinical studies 
Patients that had active infections, were immunocompromised, had a history of autoimmune diseases, 
ECOG PS ≥2 or a history of interstitial lung disease were not included. For a full list of patients 
excluded from clinical studies, see section 5.1. 
In the absence of data, cemiplimab should be used with caution in these populations after careful 
evaluation of the balance of benefits and risks for the patient. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No pharmacokinetic (PK) drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with cemiplimab. 
The use of systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants before starting cemiplimab, except for 
physiological doses of systemic corticosteroid (≤ 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent), should be 
avoided because of their potential interference with the pharmacodynamic activity and efficacy of 
cemiplimab. However, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants can be used after starting 
cemiplimab to treat immune-mediated adverse reactions (see section 4.2).

4.6 
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment with cemiplimab 
and for at least 4 months after the last dose of cemiplimab. 
Pregnancy 
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with cemiplimab. There are no available data on 
the use of cemiplimab in pregnant women. Animal studies have demonstrated that inhibition of the 
PD-1/PD-L1 pathway can lead to increased risk of immune-mediated rejection of the developing 
foetus resulting in foetal death (see section 5.3). 
Human IgG4 is known to cross the placental barrier and cemiplimab is an IgG4; therefore, cemiplimab 
has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing foetus. Cemiplimab is not 
recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using effective 
contraception unless the clinical benefit outweighs the potential risk. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether cemiplimab is secreted in human milk. It is known that antibodies (including 
IgG4) are secreted in human milk; a risk to the breast-feeding newborn/infant cannot be excluded. 
If a woman chooses to be treated with cemiplimab, she should be instructed not to breast-feed while 
being treated with cemiplimab and for at least 4 months after the last dose. 
Fertility 
No clinical data are available on the possible effects of cemiplimab on fertility. No effects on fertility 
assessment parameters or in the male and female reproductive organs were observed in a 3-month 
repeat dose fertility assessment study with sexually mature cynomolgus monkeys. 
4.7 
Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Cemiplimab has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue has been 
reported following treatment with cemiplimab (see section 4.8). 
4.8 
Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur with cemiplimab. Most of these, including severe 
reactions, resolved following initiation of appropriate medical therapy or withdrawal of cemiplimab 
(see “Description of selected adverse reactions” below). 
Cemiplimab as monotherapy 
The safety of cemiplimab as monotherapy has been evaluated in 1281 patients with advanced solid 
malignancies who received cemiplimab monotherapy in 5 clinical studies. The median duration of 
exposure to cemiplimab was 28 weeks (range: 2 days to 144 weeks).  
Immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in 21% of patients treated with cemiplimab in clinical 
trials including Grade 5 (0.3%), Grade 4 (0.6%), Grade 3 (5.7%), and Grade 2 (11.2%). Immune-
mediated adverse reactions led to permanent discontinuation of cemiplimab in 4.6% of patients. The 
most common immune-mediated adverse reactions were hypothyroidism (6.8%), hyperthyroidism 
(3.0%), immune-mediated pneumonitis (2.6%), immune-mediated hepatitis (2.4%), immune-mediated 
colitis (2.0%), and immune-mediated skin adverse reactions (1.9%) (see “Description of selected 
adverse reactions” below, Special warnings and precautions for use in section 4.4 and Recommended 
treatment modifications in section 4.2).  
Adverse events were serious in 32.4% of patients.  
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Adverse events led to permanent discontinuation of cemiplimab in 9.4% of patients. 
Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic 
epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in association with cemiplimab treatment (see 
section 4.4). 
Cemiplimab in combination with platinum‐based chemotherapy  
The safety of cemiplimab in combination with platinum‐based chemotherapy has been evaluated in a 
clinical study of 465 patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. The median duration of 
exposure was 38.5 weeks (10 days to 102.6 weeks) in the cemiplimab and chemotherapy group, and 
21.3 weeks (4 days to 95 weeks) in the chemotherapy group. 
Immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in 18.9% of patients including Grade 5 (0.3%), Grade 3 
(2.6%), and Grade 2 (7.4%). Immune-mediated adverse reactions led to permanent discontinuation of 
cemiplimab in 1.0% of patients. The most common immune-mediated adverse reactions were 
hypothyroidism (7.7%), hyperthyroidism (5.1%), increased blood thyroid stimulating hormone (4.2%), 
immune-mediated skin reaction (1.9%), immune-mediated pneumonitis (1.9%), and decreased blood 
thyroid stimulating hormone (1.6%) (see “Description of selected adverse reactions” below, Special 
warnings and precautions for use in section 4.4 and Recommended treatment modifications in 
section 4.2).  
Adverse events were serious in 25.3% of patients.  
Adverse events led to permanent discontinuation of cemiplimab in 5.1% of patients. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Table 2 lists the incidence of adverse reactions in the monotherapy safety dataset and in patients 
treated with cemiplimab in combination with chemotherapy.  Adverse reactions are presented by 
system organ class and by frequency. Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10); common 
(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare 
(< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from available data).  
Adverse reactions known to occur with cemiplimab or combination therapy components given alone 
may occur during treatment with these medicinal products in combination.

The following additional immune-mediated adverse reactions were observed in patients receiving 
combination therapy in clinical trials: vasculitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, central nervous system 
inflammation, and meningitis (Grade 4), each with the frequency of rare. 
Infusion-related reactions 
Infusion-related reactions occurred in 94 (7.3%) of 1281 patients treated with cemiplimab 
monotherapy including 2 (0.2%) patients with Grade 3 or 4 infusion-related reactions. Infusion-related 
reaction led to permanent discontinuation of cemiplimab in 1 (< 0.1%) patient. Common symptoms of 
infusion-related reaction include nausea, pyrexia, and vomiting. Ninety-three of 94 (98.9%) patients 
recovered from the infusion-related reaction at the time of data cutoff. 
Immunogenicity 
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity with cemiplimab. In clinical 
studies with 1029 patients treated with cemiplimab, 2.1% of patients developed treatment-emergent 
antibodies, with approximately 0.3% exhibiting persistent antibody responses. No neutralising 
antibodies have been observed. There was no evidence of an altered pharmacokinetic or safety profile 
with anti-cemiplimab antibody development. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9 
Overdose 
In case of overdose, patients should be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, 
and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1 
Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, PD-1/PD-L1 (Programmed cell death protein 
1/death ligand 1) inhibitors. ATC code: L01FF06 
Mechanism of action 
Cemiplimab is a fully human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody that binds to the 
programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor and blocks its interaction with its ligands PD-L1 and 
PD-L2. Engagement of PD-1 with its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, which are expressed by antigen 
presenting cells and may be expressed by tumour cells and/or other cells in the tumour 
microenvironment, results in inhibition of T cell function such as proliferation, cytokine secretion, and 
cytotoxic activity. Cemiplimab potentiates T cell responses, including anti-tumour responses, through 
blockade of PD-1 binding to PD-L1 and PD-L2 ligands.

Clinical efficacy and safety 
CSCC 
The efficacy and safety of cemiplimab in patients with mCSCC (nodal or distant) or laCSCC who 
were not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation were studied in clinical trial 
R2810-ONC-1540 (Study 1540). Study 1540 was a phase 2, open-label, multi-centre study that 
enrolled 193 patients with mCSCC or laCSCC in Groups 1 to 3 with a combined median follow-up 
time of 15.7 months total. Median duration of follow-up was 18.5 months for the mCSCC 3 mg/kg 
every 2 weeks (Q2W) group (Group 1), 15.5 months for the laCSCC 3 mg/kg Q2W group (Group 2), 
17.3 months for the mCSCC 350 mg Q3W group (Group 3). In an additional cohort of 165 advanced 
CSCC patients (mCSCC and laCSCC) dosed at 350 mg Q3W, the median duration of follow-up was 
8.7 months (Group 6). 
Patients with any of the following were excluded: autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy 
with immunosuppressant agents within 5 years; history of solid organ transplant; history of 
pneumonitis within the last 5 years; prior treatment with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 or other immune checkpoint 
inhibitor therapy; active infection requiring therapy, including known infection with human 
immunodeficiency virus, or active infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus; chronic lymphocytic 
leukaemia (CLL); brain metastases or Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance 
score (PS) ≥ 2. 
In Study 1540, patients received cemiplimab intravenously (IV) until progression of disease, 
unacceptable toxicity or completion of planned treatment [3 mg/kg Q2W for 96 weeks (Groups 1 and 
2) or 350 mg Q3W for 54 weeks (Group 3)]. If patients with locally advanced disease showed 
sufficient response to treatment, surgery with curative intent was permitted. Tumour response 
assessments were performed every 8 or 9 weeks (for patients receiving 3 mg/kg Q2W or 350 mg 
Q3W, respectively). The primary efficacy endpoint of Study 1540 was confirmed objective response 
rate (ORR), as assessed by independent central review (ICR). For patients with mCSCC without 
externally visible target lesions, ORR was determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumours (RECIST 1.1). For patients with externally visible target lesions (laCSCC and mCSCC), 
ORR was determined by a composite endpoint that integrated ICR assessments of radiologic data 
(RECIST 1.1) and digital medical photography (WHO criteria). The key secondary endpoint was 
duration of response (DOR) by ICR. Other secondary endpoints included ORR and DOR by 
investigator assessment (IA), progression-free survival (PFS) by ICR and IA, overall survival (OS), 
complete response rate (CR) by ICR, and change in scores in patient reported outcomes on the 
European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire 
(EORTC QLQ-C30). 
In the efficacy analysis of 193 patients with advanced CSCC from Study 1540 Groups 1 to 3, 115 had 
mCSCC and 78 had laCSCC. The median age was 72 years (range: 38 to 96): Seventy-eight 
(40.4%) patients were 75 years or older, 66 patients (34.2%) were 65 to less than 75 years, and 
49 patients (25.4%) were less than 65 years. A total of 161 (83.4 %) patients were male, and 
187 (96.9%) patients were White; the ECOG PS was 0 (44.6%) and 1 (55.4%). Thirty-three and 
7/10 percent (33.7%) of patients had received at least 1 prior anti-cancer systemic therapy, 81.3% of 
patients had received prior cancer related surgery, and 67.9% of patients had received prior 
radiotherapy. Among patients with mCSCC, 76.5% had distant metastases, and 22.6% had only nodal 
metastases. 
Efficacy results based on the final analysis of Study 1540 Groups 1 to 3 are presented in Table 3.

Efficacy and PD-L1 status 
Clinical activity was observed regardless of tumour PD-L1 expression status.  
BCC 
The efficacy and safety of cemiplimab in patients with laBCC or mBCC who had progressed on HHI 
therapy, were intolerant of prior HHI therapy, or had no better than SD after 9 months on HHI therapy 
(exclusive of treatment breaks), were evaluated in Study 1620, an open-label, multi-centre, 
non-randomised study. The study excluded patients with autoimmune disease that required systemic 
therapy with immunosuppressant agents within 5 years; history of solid organ transplant; prior 
treatment with anti–PD-1/PD-L1 therapy or other immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy; infection with 
HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C; or ECOG performance score (PS) ≥ 2. 
Patients received cemiplimab 350 mg intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks for 5 cycles of 9 weeks 
followed by 4 cycles of 12 weeks up to 93 weeks of treatment. Treatment continued until disease 
progression, unacceptable toxicity or completion of planned treatment. Tumour assessments were 
performed every 9 weeks during cycles 1 to 5 and every 12 weeks during cycles 6 to 9. The major 
efficacy endpoints were confirmed ORR and DOR as assessed by ICR. Secondary efficacy outcomes 
included ORR and DOR by IA, PFS, OS, CR by ICR, and time to response. For patients with mBCC 
without externally visible target lesions, ORR was determined by RECIST 1.1. For patients with 
externally visible target lesions (laBCC and mBCC), ORR was determined by a composite endpoint 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that integrated ICR assessments of radiologic data (RECIST 1.1) and digital medical photography 
(WHO criteria). 
A total of 138 patients with advanced BCC were included in the efficacy analysis of Study 1620, 
84 patients with laBCC and 54 patients with mBCC. 
In the laBCC group, the median age was 70.0 years (range: 42 to 89): 31 (37%) patients were <65 
years old and 53 (63%) were 65 years or older. A total of 56 (67%) were male and 57 (68%) were 
White; the ECOG PS was 0 (61%) and 1 (39%); Eighty-three per cent (83%) of patients had received 
at least 1 prior cancer-related surgery and 35% of patients had >3 prior cancer-related surgeries 
(median: 3.0 surgeries, range: 1 to 43); 50% of patients had received at least 1 prior anti-cancer 
radiotherapy (RT) (median: 1.0 RT, range: 1 to 6). 
In the mBCC group, the median age was 63.5 years (range: 38 to 90): 27 (50%) patients were <65 
years old and 27 (50%) were 65 years or older. A total of 38 (70%) were male and 47 (87%) were 
White; the ECOG PS was 0 (67%) and 1 (33%); Eighty-five per cent (85%) of patients had received at 
least 1 prior cancer-related surgery and 28% of patients had >3 prior cancer-related surgeries (median: 
2.0 surgeries, range: 1 to 8); 59% of patients had received at least 1 prior anti-cancer radiotherapy (RT) 
(median: 1.0 RT, range: 1 to 4). 
All 138 patients were previously treated with a HHI, and 12% (16/138) of patients were previously 
treated with both vismodegib and sonidegib (as separate lines of therapy). Of the 84 laBCC patients, 
71% (60/84) of patients discontinued HHI therapy due to disease progression, 38% (32/84) of patients 
discontinued HHI therapy due to intolerance and 2% (2/84) discontinued solely due to lack of 
response. Of the 54 mBCC patients, 76% (41/54) of patients discontinued HHI therapy due to disease 
progression, 33% (18/54) of patients discontinued HHI therapy due to intolerance, and 6% (3/54) 
discontinued solely due to lack of response. Investigators could select more than one reason for 
discontinuation of prior HHI therapy for an individual patient.

NSCLC 
First-line treatment of NSCLC with cemiplimab as monotherapy 
The efficacy and safety of cemiplimab compared with platinum-doublet chemotherapy in patients with 
locally advanced NSCLC who were not candidates for definitive chemoradiation, or with metastatic 
NSCLC who had tumour PD-L1 expression ≥ 50% using the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx assay were 
evaluated in Study 1624, a randomised, open-label, multi-centre study.  
A total of 710 patients were enrolled.  
The study excluded patients with EGFR, ALK or ROS1 genomic tumour aberrations, ECOG 
performance score (PS) ≥ 2, medical conditions that required systemic immunosuppression, 
uncontrolled infection with hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV) or human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV), history of interstitial lung disease, who were never smokers or who had an autoimmune disease 
that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment. Treatment of brain metastases was 
permitted, and patients could be enrolled if they had been adequately treated and had neurologically 
returned to baseline for at least 2 weeks prior to randomisation. Radiological confirmation of stability 
or response was not required.  
Randomisation was stratified by histology (non-squamous vs squamous) and geographic region 
(Europe, Asia, or Rest of World). Patients were randomised (1:1) to receive cemiplimab 350 mg 
intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks for up to 108 weeks or investigator’s choice of the following 
platinum-doublet chemotherapy regimens for 4 to 6 cycles: paclitaxel + cisplatin or carboplatin; 
gemcitabine + cisplatin or carboplatin; or pemetrexed + cisplatin or carboplatin followed by optional 
pemetrexed maintenance (This regimen was not recommended for patients with squamous NSCLC). 
Treatment with cemiplimab continued until RECIST 1.1-defined progressive disease, unacceptable 
toxicity, or up to 108 weeks. Patients who experienced independent review committee (IRC)-assessed 
RECIST 1.1-defined progressive disease on cemiplimab therapy were permitted to continue treatment 
with cemiplimab with an addition of 4 cycles of histology-specific chemotherapy until further 
progression was observed. Patients who experienced IRC-assessed RECIST 1.1-defined progressive 
disease on chemotherapy treatment were permitted to receive cemiplimab treatment until further 
progression, unacceptable toxicity or up to 108 weeks. Of the 203 patients randomised to receive 
chemotherapy who had IRC-assessed RECIST 1.1- defined disease progression, 150 (73.9%) patients 
crossed over to treatment with cemiplimab. Assessment of tumour status was performed every 9 
weeks. The primary efficacy endpoints were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) 
as assessed by blinded IRC using RECIST 1.1. A key secondary endpoint was objective response rate 
(ORR).  
Among the 710 patients, baseline characteristics were: median age 63 years (45% were 65 or older), 
85% male, 86% White, an ECOG performance score 0 and 1 in 27% and 73% respectively, and 12% 
with history of brain metastasis. Disease characteristics were locally advanced (16%), metastatic 
(84%), squamous (44%) and non-squamous (56%). 
The study showed statistically significant improvement in OS for patients randomised to cemiplimab 
as compared with chemotherapy.

First-line treatment of NSCLC with cemiplimab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy 
The efficacy and safety of cemiplimab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy were 
evaluated in Study 16113, a randomised, multi-centre, double-blind, active-controlled trial in 466 
patients with locally advanced NSCLC who were not candidates for definitive chemoradiation, or with 
metastatic NSCLC, regardless of tumour PD-L1 expression status and who had not previously 
received systemic treatment for metastatic NSCLC. Testing for genomic tumour aberrations other than 
EGFR, ALK or ROS1 was not mandatory for enrolment in Study 16113. 
Patients with EGFR, ALK or ROS1 genomic tumour aberrations; a medical condition that required 
systemic immunosuppression; active infection with hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV), 
uncontrolled human immunodeficiency disease (HIV), or ongoing or recent autoimmune disease that 
required systemic therapy were ineligible. Patients with a history of brain metastases were eligible if 
they had been adequately treated and had neurologically returned to baseline for at least 2 weeks prior 
to randomisation. Radiological confirmation of stability or response was not required. 
Randomisation was stratified by histology (non-squamous vs squamous) and PD-L1 expression (<1% 
versus 1% to 49% versus ≥ 50%) according to the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) assay. Patients were 
randomised (2:1) to receive either cemiplimab 350 mg intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks for 108 
weeks plus platinum-based chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 4 cycles or placebo intravenously (IV) 
every 3 weeks for 108 weeks plus platinum-based chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. 
Treatment with cemiplimab or placebo was continued until RECIST 1.1-defined progressive disease, 
unacceptable toxicity, or up to 108 weeks. Treatment with chemotherapy was given for 4 cycles 
followed by maintenance of pemetrexed as clinically indicated or until RECIST 1.1-defined 
progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. Chemotherapy in Study 16113 consisted of carboplatin or 
cisplatin combined with paclitaxel or pemetrexed with mandatory maintenance for pemetrexed 
regimens. Assessment of tumour status was performed every 9 weeks beginning at week 9 during year 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1 and every 12 weeks beginning at week 55 during year 2. The primary efficacy endpoint was overall 
survival (OS). Key secondary endpoints as assessed by blinded IRC using RECIST 1.1, were 
progression-free survival (PFS), and objective response rate (ORR).  
Among the 466 patients, 327 (70%) had tumours expressing PD-L1 (in ≥ 1% of tumour cells). Of 
these, 217 patients were in the cemiplimab and chemotherapy group and 110 patients were in the 
placebo and chemotherapy group. The baseline characteristics of the 327 patients with tumours 
expressing PD-L1 in ≥ 1% of tumour cells were: median age 62 years (38% were 65 or older), 83% 
male, 87% White, an ECOG performance score 0 and 1 in 16% and 83% respectively, and 6% with 
history of brain metastasis; 51% of patients were current smokers, 34% were past smokers and 15% 
had never smoked (less than 100 cigarettes a lifetime). Disease characteristics were locally advanced 
(14%), metastatic (86%), squamous histology (45%), and non-squamous histology (55%). 
At the primary analysis in the overall population with a median follow-up time of 16.4 months, the 
study showed a statistically significant improvement in OS for patients randomised to cemiplimab in 
combination with chemotherapy compared with placebo in combination with chemotherapy. 
Efficacy results in patients whose tumours expressed PD-L1 ≥1% are presented in Table 6, Figure 3, 
and Figure 4.

Cervical Cancer 
The efficacy and safety of cemiplimab were evaluated in patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical 
cancer whose tumours progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy, with or without 
bevacizumab in Study 1676, a randomised, open-label, multi-centre study. Patients were enrolled 
regardless of PD-L1 tumour expression status. The study excluded patients with autoimmune disease 
that required systemic therapy with immunosuppressant agents within 5 years and prior treatment with 
anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. 
The stratification factors for the efficacy analysis were geographic region (North America, Asia, Rest 
of World) and histology [squamous histology (SCC), adenocarcinoma / adenosquamous histologies 
(AC)]. Randomisation was also stratified by whether or not patients had received prior bevacizumab 
treatment and their ECOG performance status. Patients were randomised (1:1) to receive cemiplimab 
350 mg intravenously every 3 weeks or investigator’s choice of intravenous chemotherapy among 
pemetrexed, topotecan, irinotecan, gemcitabine, or vinorelbine, for up to 96 weeks. 
Treatment continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or completion of planned 
treatment. Tumour assessments were performed every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks and every 
12 weeks thereafter. The primary efficacy endpoint was OS in SCC followed by the total population. 
Secondary endpoints included PFS, ORR according to RECIST 1.1, and DOR by investigator 
assessment. 
The median age was 51 years (22 to 87 years); 63% were White, 29% Asian, 3.5% Black; 49% 
received prior bevacizumab treatment, 47% had ECOG PS 0 and 53% had ECOG PS 1; 78% had SCC 
and 22% had AC, 94% had metastatic disease; 57% had 1 prior line of treatment in the recurrent or 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
metastatic setting and 43% had > 1 prior line of treatment in the recurrent or metastatic setting. The 
median duration of follow-up for the primary analysis in the total population was 18.2 months.  
Cemiplimab showed a statistically significant improvement in OS in both SCC and total population 
compared to chemotherapy.  
Efficacy results are presented in Table 7, Figure 5, and Figure 6.

An exploratory subgroup analysis was conducted on survival by tumour PD-L1 Tumour Cell (TC) 
expression status using a clinical trial assay (VENTANA PD-L1 SP263 Assay). Of the 608 enrolled 
patients, 42% of patients had samples that were tested for PD-L1. Among these samples, 64% were 
PD-L1 ≥ 1% and 36% were PD-L1 < 1%. At the updated exploratory OS analysis, with median 
duration of follow-up of 30.2 months, the HR for the PD-L1 ≥ 1% group was 0.70 (95% CI: 0.48, 
1.01) and the HR for the PD-L1 < 1% group was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.53, 1.36). 
Elderly population 
Monotherapy 
Of the 1281 patients treated with cemiplimab monotherapy in clinical studies, 52.2% (669/1281) were 
less than 65 years, 25.9% (332/1281) were 65 to less than 75 years, and 21.9% (280/1281) were 
75 years or older. 
No overall differences in efficacy were observed between elderly patients and younger patients. There 
was a trend towards a higher frequency of serious adverse events and discontinuations due to adverse 
events in patients 65 years and older compared with patients aged less than 65 years treated with 
cemiplimab monotherapy. 
Combination therapy 
Of the 312 patients treated with cemiplimab in combination with chemotherapy, 59% (184/312) were 
less than 65 years, 35.3% (110/312) were 65 to less than 75 years, and 5.8% (18/312) were 75 years or 
older. 
No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between elderly patients and younger 
patients treated with cemiplimab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
cemiplimab in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of all conditions included in the 
category of malignant neoplasms, except haematopoietic and lymphoid tissue (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
5.2 
Pharmacokinetic properties 
Concentration data from 1063 patients with various solid tumours who received intravenous 
cemiplimab were combined in a population PK analysis. 
At 350 mg Q3W, the mean cemiplimab concentrations at steady-state ranged between a Ctrough of 
59 mg/l and a concentration at end of infusion (Cmax) of 171 mg/l. Steady-state exposure is achieved 
after approximately 4 months of treatment. 
Cemiplimab exposure at steady-state in patients with solid tumours is similar at 350 mg Q3W and at 
3 mg/kg Q2W.  
Absorption 
Cemiplimab is administered via the intravenous route and hence is completely bioavailable. 
Distribution 
Cemiplimab is primarily distributed in the vascular system with a volume of distribution at 
steady-state (Vss) of 5.9 l. Median Tmax occurs at the end of the 30-minute infusion. 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Biotransformation 
Specific metabolism studies were not conducted because cemiplimab is a protein. Cemiplimab is 
expected to degrade to small peptides and individual amino acids. 
Elimination 
Clearance of cemiplimab is linear at doses of 1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg every two weeks. Cemiplimab 
clearance after the first dose is approximately 0.25 l/day. The total clearance appears to decrease by 
approximately 11% over time, resulting in a steady state clearance (CLss) of 0.22 l/day; the decrease 
in CL is not considered clinically relevant. The within dosing interval half-life at steady state is 
22 days. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
At the dosing regimens of 1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg every two weeks, pharmacokinetics of cemiplimab 
were linear and dose proportional, suggesting saturation of the systemic target-mediated pathway. 
Special populations 
A population PK analysis suggests that the following factors have no clinically significant effect on 
the exposure of cemiplimab: age, gender, body weight, race, cancer type, albumin level, renal 
impairment, and mild to moderate hepatic impairment. 
Renal impairment 
The effect of renal impairment on the exposure of cemiplimab was evaluated by a population PK 
analysis in patients with mild (CLcr 60 to 89 ml/min; n= 396), moderate (CLcr 30 to 59 ml/min; 
n= 166), or severe (CLcr 15 to 29 ml/min; n= 7) renal impairment. No clinically important differences 
in the exposure of cemiplimab were found between patients with renal impairment and patients with 
normal renal function. Cemiplimab has not been studied in patients with CLcr < 21 ml/min (see 
section 4.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
The effect of hepatic impairment on the exposure of cemiplimab was evaluated by population PK 
analysis in patients with mild hepatic impairment (n= 22) (total bilirubin [TB] greater than 1.0 to 
1.5 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] and any aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) and patients 
with moderate hepatic impairment (n=3) (total bilirubin > 1.5 times ULN up to 3.0 times ULN) and 
any AST; no clinically important differences in the exposure of cemiplimab were found compared to 
patients with normal hepatic function. Cemiplimab has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment. There are insufficient data in patients with severe hepatic impairment for dosing 
recommendations (see section 4.2). 
5.3 
Preclinical safety data 
No studies have been performed to test the potential of cemiplimab for carcinogenicity or genotoxicity. 
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with cemiplimab (see section 4.6). As reported 
in the literature, PD-1/PD-L1 signalling pathway plays a role in sustaining pregnancy by maintaining 
immunological tolerance and studies have shown that PD-1 receptor blockade results in early 
termination of pregnancy. The increase of spontaneous abortion and/or resorption in animals with 
restricted PD-L1 expression (knock-out or anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies) has been shown 
in both mice and monkeys. These animal species have similar maternal-foetal interface to that in 
humans.

1. 
What LIBTAYO is and what it is used for 
LIBTAYO is an anti-cancer medicine that contains the active substance cemiplimab, which is a 
monoclonal antibody. 
LIBTAYO is used in adults to treat: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
a type of skin cancer called advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). 
a type of skin cancer called advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC) for which you have received 
treatment with a hedgehog pathway inhibitor and this treatment did not work well or was not 
well tolerated. 
a type of lung cancer called advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 
a type of cancer called cervical cancer that has worsened on or after chemotherapy. 
LIBTAYO may be given in combination with chemotherapy for NSCLC. It is important that you also 
read the package leaflets for the specific chemotherapy you may be receiving. If you have any 
questions about these medicines, ask your doctor. 
LIBTAYO works by helping your immune system fight your cancer. 
2. 
What you need to know before you are given LIBTAYO 
You should not be given LIBTAYO if: 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  you are allergic to cemiplimab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you think you may be allergic, or you are not sure, talk to your doctor before you are given 
LIBTAYO. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given LIBTAYO if:  
•  you have an autoimmune disease (a condition where the body attacks its own cells) 
•  you have had an organ transplant, or you have received or plan to receive a bone marrow 
transplant using bone marrow from another person (allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell 
transplant) 
•  you have lung or breathing problems 
•  you have liver problems 
•  you have kidney problems 
•  you have diabetes 
•  you have any other medical conditions. 
If any of the above apply to you, or you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given 
LIBTAYO. 
Look out for side effects 
LIBTAYO can cause some serious side effects that you need to tell your doctor about immediately. 
These problems may happen anytime during treatment or even after your treatment has ended. You 
may have more than one side effect at the same time. 
These serious side effects include: 
•  Skin problems  
•  Lung problems (pneumonitis)  
•  Gut problems (colitis)  
•  Liver problems (hepatitis)  
•  Hormone gland problems - especially thyroid, pituitary, adrenal glands and the pancreas 
•  Type 1 diabetes, including diabetic ketoacidosis (acid in the blood produced from 
diabetes) 
Infusion-related reactions  
•  Kidney problems (nephritis and kidney failure) 
•  Central nervous system problems (such as meningitis) 
• 
•  Muscle problems (inflammation of the muscles called myositis) 
• 
•  A disease where the immune system makes too many of otherwise normal infection-
fighting cells called histiocytes and lymphocytes that may cause various symptoms 
(haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis) (see ‘Possible side effects’ for the list of signs and 
symptoms) 
Inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) 
•  Problems in other parts of the body (see ‘Possible side effects’) 
Look out for these side effects while you are receiving LIBTAYO. See ‘Possible side effects’ section 
in section 4. If you have any of these effects, talk to your doctor immediately.  
Your doctor may give you other medicines in order to stop more severe reactions and reduce your 
symptoms. Your doctor also may delay your next dose of LIBTAYO or stop your treatment. 
Children and adolescents 
LIBTAYO should not be used in children and adolescents below 18 years of age. 
Other medicines and LIBTAYO 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In particular, tell your doctor if you are taking or have ever taken any of the following medicines: 
•  a cancer medicine called idelalisib 
•  medicines that make your immune system weak - examples include corticosteroids, such 
as prednisone. These medicines may interfere with the effect of LIBTAYO. However, 
once you are treated with LIBTAYO, your doctor may give you corticosteroids to reduce 
the side effects that you may have with LIBTAYO.  
Pregnancy  
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for 
advice before you are given this medicine. 
•  LIBTAYO can harm your unborn baby. 
•  Tell your doctor immediately if you become pregnant while you are being treated with 
• 
LIBTAYO. 
If you are able to become pregnant, you must use an effective method of contraception to 
avoid becoming pregnant: 
−  while you are being treated with LIBTAYO and 
− 
for at least 4 months after the last dose. 
•  Talk to your doctor about the contraception methods that you must use during this time. 
Breast-feeding 
• 
If you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed, ask your doctor for advice before you are 
given this medicine.  
•  Do not breast-feed while you are being treated with LIBTAYO and for at least 4 months 
after the last dose.  
It is not known if LIBTAYO passes into your breast milk.  
• 
Driving and using machines 
LIBTAYO has no or minor influence on your ability to drive and use machines. If you feel tired, do 
not drive or use machines until you feel better.  
3.  How you are given LIBTAYO 
•  LIBTAYO will be given to you in a hospital or clinic - supervised by a doctor experienced 
in cancer treatment. 
•  LIBTAYO is given as a drip into a vein (intravenous infusion).  
•  The infusion will last about 30 minutes. 
•  LIBTAYO is usually given every 3 weeks. 
How much you will receive 
The recommended dose of LIBTAYO is 350 mg. 
Your doctor will decide how much LIBTAYO you will receive and how many treatments you will 
need. 
Your doctor will test your blood for certain side effects during your treatment. 
If you miss an appointment 
Call your doctor as soon as possible to make another appointment. It is very important that you do not 
miss a dose of this medicine.  
If you stop receiving LIBTAYO 
44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Do not stop treatment of LIBTAYO unless you have discussed this with your doctor. This is because 
stopping your treatment may stop the effect of the medicine. 
Patient Alert Card 
The information in this Package Leaflet can be found in the Patient Alert Card you have been given by 
your doctor. It is important that you keep this Patient Alert Card and show it to your partner or 
caregivers. 
If you have any questions about your treatment, ask your doctor.  
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Your 
doctor will discuss these with you and will explain the risks and benefits of your treatment. 
LIBTAYO acts on your immune system and may cause inflammation in parts of your body (see the 
conditions listed in ‘Look out for side effects’ in section 2). Inflammation may cause serious damage 
to your body and may need treatment or require you to stop treatment with LIBTAYO. Some 
inflammatory conditions may also lead to death. 
Seek urgent medical attention if you have any of the following signs or symptoms, or if they get 
worse: 
•  Skin problems such as rash or itching, skin blistering or ulcers in mouth or other mucous 
membrane.  
•  Lung problems (pneumonitis) such as new or worsening cough, being short of breath or 
chest pain.  
•  Gut problems (colitis) such as frequent diarrhoea often with blood or mucus, more bowel 
movements than usual, stools that are black or tarry, and severe stomach (abdomen) pain 
or tenderness.  
•  Liver problems (hepatitis) such as yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes, 
severe nausea or vomiting, pain on right side of your stomach (abdomen), feeling sleepy,

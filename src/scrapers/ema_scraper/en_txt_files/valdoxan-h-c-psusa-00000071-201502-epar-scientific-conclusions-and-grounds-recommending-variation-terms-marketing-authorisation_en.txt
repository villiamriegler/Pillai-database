Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for agomelatine, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
84 cases of confusional state/disorientation have been reported cumulatively. There are two well-
documented cases of delirium, both with positive rechallenge. Additionally, there is substantial 
number of events that are timely related to the initiation of treatment with agomelatine and with 
positive dechallenge.  
Therefore, in view of available data regarding confusional state, the PRAC considered that changes 
to the product information were warranted.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.  
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for agomelatine the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing agomelatine is favourable subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information  
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisations should be varied.

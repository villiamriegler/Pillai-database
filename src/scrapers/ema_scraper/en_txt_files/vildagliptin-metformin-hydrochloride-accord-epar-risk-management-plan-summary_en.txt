film-coated 
tablets  & 
Vildagliptin/Metformin  hydrochloride  Accord  50  mg/1000  mg  film-coated  tablets’  risks,  are 
outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
 
 
•  Specific  information,  such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on  correct  use,  in  the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the

without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed including signal management activity, so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.

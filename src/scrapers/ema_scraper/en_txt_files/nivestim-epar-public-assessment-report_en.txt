2.  SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
2.1.  Introduction 
The current combination therapy for cancers often targets proliferating cells leading to bone marrow 
damage. Anemia and thrombocytopenia and, most importantly, neutropenia results in impaired host 
defence, which leaves patients more susceptible to bacterial infections and sepsis. This leads to delays 
in subsequent chemotherapy cycles. The recovery of bone marrow is stimulated by various growth 
factors. The most important growth factor for the recovery of neutrophils is granulocyte colony-
stimulating factor, G-CSF. Filgrastim is a human G-CSF produced by recombinant DNA technology. G-
CSF is a 20,000 Dalton glycoprotein hormone that stimulates the proliferation of neutropoietic 
progenitor cells and their differentiation to granulocytes, and functionally activates mature neutrophils. 
Commercial forms of recombinant human G-CSF include Escherichia coli-derived G-CSF, which has no 
sugar chain (unglycosylated G-CSF; filgrastim; Neupogen, Amgen) and Chinese hamster ovary cell-
derived G-CSF (glycosylated G-CSF; lenograstim, Chugai Pharma UK Ltd). 
Human G-CSF is a single polypeptide chain protein of 174 amino acids with O-glycosylation at one 
threonine residue.  It acts by binding to a specific transmembrane receptor (G-CSF receptor), a 
member of the class I cytokine receptor family expressed on various hematopoietic cells such as stem 
cells, multipotent progenitors, myeloid-committed progenitors, neutrophils, and monocytes.  This 
receptor forms homo-oligomeric complexes upon ligand binding.  Seven membrane-bound and one 
soluble isoform of the G-CSF receptor have been isolated; the membrane-bound isoforms arise from 
alternative RNA splicing leading to differences in the cytoplasmic sequences, but the extracellular, 
ligand-binding domains are identical.  Consequently, the effects of G-CSF (and of recombinant human 
G-CSF, rhG-CSF) are mediated via a single affinity class of receptors.  The same mechanism of action 
and receptor mediated biological activity operates in mobilization of mature neutrophils into the 
circulating neutrophil pool and acceleration of granulopoiesis. 
Nivestim (also referred to as Pliva/Mayne filgrastim) is a 175 amino acid protein – recombinant 
methionyl human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (r-metHuG-CSF) that is produced in E. coli and 
has a molecular weight of 18,800 daltons. Unlike the human protein, Nivestim is unglycosylated and 
contain an N-terminal methionine. 
The applicant applied for the following indications: 
CHMP assessment report

Filgrastim is indicated for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile 
neutropenia in patients treated with established cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the 
exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes) and for the reduction in the 
duration of neutropenia in patients undergoing myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow 
transplantation considered to be at increased risk of prolonged severe neutropenia. 
The safety and efficacy of filgrastim are similar in adults and children receiving cytotoxic 
chemotherapy. 
Filgrastim is indicated for the mobilisation of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC). 
In patients, children or adults, with severe congenital, cyclic, or idiopathic neutropenia with an 
absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of ≤ 0.5 x 109 /l and a history of severe or recurrent infections, long 
term administration of filgrastim is indicated to increase neutrophil counts and to reduce the incidence 
and duration of infection-related events. 
Filgrastim is indicated for the treatment of persistent neutropenia (ANC ≤ 1.0 x 109 /l) in patients with 
advanced HIV infection, in order to reduce the risk of bacterial infections when other options to 
manage neutropenia are inappropriate. 
Nivestim is administered by the subcutaneous (S.C.) or intravenous (I.V.) route, normally at a dose of 
5 μg/kg or 10 μg/kg body weight. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Filgrastim, the active substance of Nivestim, is a recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating 
factor (G-CSF) produced in E. coli as a non-glycosylated protein containing an N-terminal methionyl 
extension. It stimulates the proliferation, differentiation and activation of late progenitor cells of the 
granulocyte lineage, as well as enhances the activity of mature neutrophils.  
Nivestim has been developed as a similar biological medicinal product according to Article 10(4) of 
Directive 2001/83/EC as amended. The reference medicinal product used throughout the quality, 
safety and efficacy development programme is Neupogen marketed in the Community by Amgen. The 
reference medicinal product was sourced from UK, Germany and Poland for the purpose of the 
comparability exercise.  
Nivestim solution for injection or infusion in prefilled syringes is a clear, colourless, and sterile solution. 
Three strengths have been developed, 120µg/0.2ml, 300µg/0.5ml and 480µg/0.5ml. The qualitative 
and quantitative composition of Nivestim and Neupogen is the same, with the exception of the 
120µg/0.2ml presentation, which is not marketed by Amgen. However, this presentation only differs in 
fill volume from the 300µg/0.5 ml presentation.  
2.2.2.  Active substance  
2.2.2.1.  Manufacture 
The filgrastim Active substance, manufactured at Hospira Zagreb d.o.o., Croatia, is produced in E. coli 
bacteria transformed with an expression plasmid which contains the gene for human granulocyte-
colony stimulating factor The manufacturing process consists of two major production phases; 1. 
biosynthesis and filgrastim inclusion bodies recovery, and 2. Filgrastim purification. The process starts 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/262762/2010   
Page 5/48
 
 
 
 
by thawing one ampoule of the E. coli working cell bank, which is propagated to the biosynthesis step 
performed in bioreactor. Following completion of fermentation, the biomass is separated from the 
fermentation broth by flow-through centrifuge and used for release of inclusion bodies by 
homogenization in high pressure homogenizer. The wet paste of filgrastim inclusion bodies is packed 
as portions in containers with closure and following extraction of inclusion bodies and refolding, 
filgrastim is purified by two chromatographic steps. Filgrastim Active substance solution is filled into 
containers which are stored at 2-8°C for up to 24 months.  
Master and working cell banks have been established and characterised for purity, identity, and 
viability. The genetic stability of the cell substrate has been adequately demonstrated throughout the 
production time.  
The manufacturing process is controlled by in-process controls (IPCs). The Applicant has identified 
three critical steps for the upstream  as well as three for the downstream process.  
The performance of the manufacturing process was validated using six consecutive batches. Along with 
routine in process testing, additional samples were taken and analysed for bacterial growth, 
reproducibility of wet weight reduction from biomass to inclusion bodies paste, appearance, SDS-
PAGE/WB pattern, and dry weight of inclusion bodies, as well as for downstream removal of product 
related impurities. The results were considered acceptable.  
The filgrastim Active substance manufacturing process has undergone optimization during 
development. After Phase I, but prior to Phase III clinical trials, the process for Active substance 
production was improved in terms of its robustness. The Applicant has conducted a thorough 
comparability exercise and adequately demonstrated that the current and the previous manufacturing 
process produced Active substance of comparable quality. 
Characterisation of the Active substance has been conducted on three filgrastim batches. 
Physicochemical properties were studied using a variety of analytical methods (appearance, pH, IEF, 
SDS-PAGE, protein concentration by uv spectroscopy, SEC-HPLC, RP-HPLC, IC, peptide mapping with 
C- and N-terminal amino acid sequencing, CD analysis, fluorescence spectroscopy, intact molecular 
mass determination, determination of disulphide bridges by peptide mapping, amino acid analysis, N-
terminal sequence analysis). In addition, biological activity (using in vitro assay), immunochemical 
properties (Western blot) and purity (by SEC-HPLC, SDS-PAGE, RP-HPLC, IC and IEF) have been 
determined. For product related impurity profiling, the Applicant has considered formylmethionine-
filgrastim, oxidised forms, dimer and HMW species, unfolded and partially folded filgrastim, as well as 
other filgrastim related impurities such as deamidated and truncated forms. Removal of process-
related impurities was adequately addressed. In conclusion, the characterisation studies are 
satisfactory and state-of-the-art analytical procedures have been used. 
2.2.2.2.  Specification 
Before application for marketing authorisation, Active substance specification was adjusted in order to 
be in agreement with Ph. Eur. monograph for Filgrastim concentrated solution 01/2009:2206 (official 
from 1 January 2009). During the Marketing Authorisation Application procedure, the Applicant has 
amended the Active substance specifications according to the requirements of the CHMP, to take into 
account manufacturing experience and batch data.  
A Major Objection was raised with regard to the performance of the potency assay and the proposed 
acceptance limits for the biological activity at release. In response, the Applicant provided further 
justifications, including additional data and a proposal to tighten the acceptance criteria. The Applicant 
also provided additional experimental data demonstrating the correct assignment of protein content 
and biological activity of the in-house reference standard, and that the filgrastim dosing in the clinical 
CHMP assessment report

Page 6/48
 
 
 
trials was accurate. The Major Objection was thereby considered satisfactorily resolved, taking into 
account also a commitment to review the acceptance limits once more experience is gained, see Letter 
of Undertaking. 
For control of host cell protein (HCP), the commercially available assay proposed by the Applicant was 
not considered sufficiently sensitive towards HCP originating from the producer bacteria E. coli. The 
Applicant will develop post-approval a new in-house HCP assay with sufficient sensitivity and will 
submit a follow-up measure accordingly. Meanwhile, the commercially available assay in combination 
with SDS-PAGE silver staining will be used to control the HCP content of the Active substance.  
The Applicant also committed to review the acceptance limits for all quantitative parameters in the 
Active substance and Medicinal Product specifications once 30 commercial scale batches has been 
produced.  
Considering the above, the specifications and acceptance limits are considered as justified and 
acceptable.  
2.2.2.3.  Stability 
The Applicant has conducted real-time, real-condition stability studies, as well as studies under 
accelerated conditions on three filgrastim batches produced using the current manufacturing process. 
In addition, one batch has been analysed under stressed conditions as well as for stability under 
freeze-thaw cycles, high-low temperature cycles, and for photostability. The proposed shelf-life of 24 
months at 5°C±3°C is considered justified.  
2.2.2.4.  Comparability exercise for Active substance  
The Applicant has conducted a comprehensive comparability exercise in order to demonstrate 
biosimilarity between Nivestim and the reference medicinal product Neupogen. The analytical methods 
used are regarded as suitable and state-of-the-art for the intended purpose. The comparability has 
mainly been addressed on the level of the Medicinal Product, but in addition, one batch of Neupogen 
was included as reference in most of the characterisation studies performed for the Active substance. 
Reference is made to section 3.2.2.1 (Manufacture) for further details on the characterisation and the 
analytical methods used. 
2.2.3.  Medicinal Product  
2.2.3.1.  Pharmaceutical Development 
Filgrastim solution for injection or infusion in prefilled syringes is a clear, colourless, and sterile 
solution. Three strengths have been proposed, 120µg/0.2ml, 300µg/0.5ml and 480µg/0.5ml. The 
excipients used in the formulation are polysorbate 80, sorbitol, acetic acid, sodium hydroxide and 
water for injections. The qualitative and quantitative composition of Nivestim and Neupogen reference 
medicinal product is the same, with the exception of the 120µg/0.2ml presentation, which is not 
marketed by Amgen for Neupogen. However, this presentation contains the same active substance 
concentration (0.6mg/ml) and the same excipients, in the same concentration as the 300µg/0.5 ml 
marketed for Neupogen. Only the fill volume is smaller.  
There is no overage in the formulation for Filgrastim or any excipient. However, each prefilled syringe 
is filled with 0.52 ml to deliver 0.5 ml (for Filgrastim PFS 480 μg/0.5 ml and 300 μg/0.5 ml) or with 
0.22 ml to deliver 0.2 ml (for Filgrastim PFS 120 μg/0.2 ml) of Medicinal Product. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/262762/2010   
Page 7/48
 
 
 
 
 
During development the manufacturing processes for both Active substance and Medicinal Product 
have undergone optimization, which resulted in slight changes in clinical formulation from Phase I to 
Phase III study.  
During product development, formulation studies were performed, even though the excipients are 
qualitatively and quantitatively the same as of the reference product. These studies were well 
described and were considered appropriate for biosimilar product. 
2.2.3.2.  Adventitious Agents 
Apart from growth media and chromatographic resin, no other raw materials or excipients of biological 
origin are used in the manufacture of the Active substance and the Medicinal Product. These raw 
materials are considered to pose very low risk with respect to viral safety. 
Both the Active substance and Medicinal Product manufacturing processes are well controlled for 
microbiological safety. Master and working cell banks have undergone appropriate testing. 
2.2.3.3.  Manufacture of the Product 
The manufacturing process is conducted at the same facility as the Active substance manufacturing 
(Hospira Zagreb d.o.o., Croatia).  
Manufacturing consists of mixing active substance with excipients, pH adjustment, filtration and filling 
into sterile syringes.  
The Medicinal Product is presented in transparent 1 ml glass syringes with preassembled steel needle 
gauge 27G 1/2, stopped with a coated rubber stopper, and plunger rod inserted in the stopper.  
The Medicinal Product manufacturing process has been adequately validated using three consecutive 
batches of each presentation. In addition, since the validation batches for the 480 µg/0.5ml 
presentation did not fully cover the proposed batch size range, the Applicant has committed to re-
validate the manufacturing process for Filgrastim prefilled syringes 480 µg/0.5ml using three 
consecutive commercial scale batches.  
2.2.3.4.  Product Specification 
The proposed Medicinal Product specifications (release and end of shelf life) are primarily based on the 
requirements of the Ph. Eur. monograph for the active substance. During the Marketing Authorisation 
Application procedure, the Applicant has amended the Medicinal Product specifications according to the 
requirements of the CHMP, to take into account manufacturing experience and batch data. The current 
specifications, including the acceptance limits, are thereby considered as justified and acceptable. The 
Applicant also committed to review the acceptance limits for all quantitative parameters in the Active 
substance and Medicinal Product specifications once 30 commercial scale batches has been produced. 
2.2.3.5.  Stability of the Product 
The Applicant has provided real-time, real-condition stability data for three batches of each 
presentation as follows: 
o  30 months for the 480 µg/0.5ml presentation 
o  24 months for the 300 μg/0.5 ml presentation  
o  12 months for the 120 μg/0.2 ml presentation  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/262762/2010   
Page 8/48
 
 
 
All results from the real-time stability study were within the acceptance criteria. In addition, the 
Applicant has conducted cyclic and freezing tests, as well as stability studies under accelerated and 
stressed conditions. Extrapolation of stability data from pre-filled syringes 300 μg/0.5 ml to pre-filled 
syringes 120 μg/0.2 ml is has been justified and is considered to be acceptable. No significant 
differences between results for the 120 μg/0.2 ml and 300 μg/0.5 ml presentations were observed. 
The stability data provided supports a shelf life of 30 months at 2-8°C for the 480µg/0.5ml 
presentation and a shelf life of 24 months at 2-8°C for the 300µg/0.5ml and 120µg/0.2 ml 
presentations.  
2.2.3.6.  Comparability exercise for Medicinal Product  
In accordance with the Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-
derived proteins as active substance: Quality issues (EMEA/CHMP/BWP/49348/2005), the Applicant 
has conducted state-of-the-art comparative characterisation studies between Nivestim and the 
reference medicinal product Neupogen, authorised in the Community. The comparability has mainly 
been assessed on the level of the Medicinal Product, but one batch of Neupogen was additionally 
included as reference in most of the characterisation studies performed for the Active substance. 
The comparability study included both release tests and assessment of additional characteristics. The 
identity, the physical properties, the primary and higher order structures, the biological activity, the 
content, as well as the purity/impurity profiles were compared and found to be highly similar between 
Nivestim and Neupogen. 
In addition to the characterisation studies, the Applicant also conducted a comparative side-by-side 
stability study under stressed conditions. The stability related changes seen were similar for Nivestim 
and Neupogen. Also the decrease in biological activity was similar between the biosimilar and the 
reference medicinal product. 
In conclusion, no significant differences between Nivestim and the reference medicinal product 
Neupogen were observed in the comparative characterisation studies and forced degradation studies. 
The analytical methods used are regarded as suitable and state-of-the-art for the intended purpose. 
The characterisation studies of the Active substance further support the conclusion that the two 
products are similar.  Altogether, biosimilarity between Nivestim and Neupogen has been satisfactorily 
demonstrated on the quality level.  
2.2.3.7.  GMO 
Not applicable 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the Active substance and Medicinal Product 
have been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The nonclinical development program with Nivestim was performed in agreement with the EMEA 
Scientific Advice (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/50208/05, Procedure No.: EMEA/H/SA/562/1/2004/III) and with 
the Guidance on biosimilar medicinal products containing recombinant granulocyte-colony stimulating 
factor (EMEA/CHMP/31329/2005). The nonclinical bioequivalence program between Nivestim versus 
reference medicinal product Neupogen included pharmacodynamic and toxicological studies.  The in 
vivo pharmacodynamics in neutropenic rats, local tolerance in rabbits, and repeated dose toxicity 
studies, were performed according to Good Laboratory Practice (GLP). 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
The pharmacodynamic data package contained in vitro cell based bioassay and receptor-binding assay, 
and an in vivo study in neutropenic rodents. In addition, efficacy was examined in healthy animals. 
2.3.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamics  
Biological activity was determined using a cell-based potency assay relying on the ability of G-CSF to 
stimulate cell proliferation.  
Receptor-binding properties of Nivestim and Neupogen were determined using an assay measuring 
competitive binding of the test compounds to the GCSF receptor (Study report M388-06). Nivestim and 
Neupogen exhibited comparable receptor-binding properties in vitro,  the IC50 values were 35.56 
ng/ml and 36.35 ng/ml, respectively. 
Pharmacodynamic response in terms of increase in absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) was determined 
in a neutropenic rat model (Study report M470-06), as well as in healthy rats in a repeat-dose toxicity 
study. Neutropenia was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats with a single intraperitoneal injection of 
cyclophosphamide (CPA) at 50 mg/kg/day on Day 0. Nivestim or Neupogen were administered SC at 
dose levels 30 and 100 μg/kg once daily for 4 days, starting the day after CPA injection (Days 1 
through 4). The study included an untreated control group as well as one that received CPA followed 
by treatment with placebo (vehicle). White blood cell (WBC) count and WBC differential count were 
measured 3 days prior to CPA and on days 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11 and 14 after the CPA injection. The 
results for ANC are shown in Table 1.

Table 1  
Mean values for absolute neutrophil count (x 1000/uL)  
The neutropenic rat model included only male animals. The treatment with both Nivestim and 
Neupogen at two dose levels resulted in increased neutrophil counts after two days when compared to 
placebo treatment. Based on the statistical analysis, Nivestim and Neupogen induced a comparable 
pharmacodynamic response in male neutropenic rats except on Day 2 at the low dose level.  
 Neutrophil counts were also determined as part of the repeat-dose toxicity study in healthy male and 
female rats. (Figure 1). Increased ANC was observed one day after the first dose, and continued 
through the end of the treatment period. On cessation of treatment, neutrophil counts rapidly declined 
and had returned to normal levels two days after the last treatment. During the 28-day treatment 
period, Nivestim and Neupogen induced a comparable pharmacodynamic response. The regression 
analysis of dose-response curves for neutrophil counts were also comparable.

2.3.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamics 
There were no secondary pharmacodynamic studies submitted. 
2.3.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
There were no safety pharmacology studies submitted. 
2.3.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
There were no secondary pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies submitted. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics studies of Nivestim and the reference product Neupogen were performed as part of 
the 28-day repeat-dose toxicity study.  
Drug plasma levels were determined in groups of 4 animals/sex/time-point on Day 1 and Day 28. An 
adequately adjusted and validated commercial ELISA-based Quantikine human G-CSF immunoassay 
was used for quantification of plasma levels of Nivestim and Neupogen (Study report MN386-06). 
Statistically significant differences were observed in exposure (AUC), peak concentration (Cmax) and 
half-life of the two products at certain dose levels and study days in both males and females. The 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/262762/2010

observed differences were not consistent in direction of change, dose or gender. Statistical analysis of 
the linear relationship between dose and AUC for Nivestim and Neupogen on Day 1 and Day 28 showed 
no statistically significant differences in both males and females, except for female rats on Day 28. 
Evaluation of the regression equation for AUC on Day 1 versus AUC on Day 28 indicated there was no 
statistically significant difference between Nivestim and Neupogen for either males or females. The 
Cmax values were significantly lower for Nivestim  in three groups and significantly higher in one group 
for Nivestim; thus a consistent dose related change in Cmax was not observed. The elimination half life 
did not differ between the two products. Statistically significant differences in T1/2 between Day 1 and 
Day 28 was noted in two treatment groups for Neupogen but were not considered biologically 
significant.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicological data package consisted of 28-day subcutaneous repeated-dose toxicity study in rats 
(Study report. M386-06) followed by a 14-day recovery period with the assessment of antibody 
formation (binding and neutralising antibody), and a single dose local tolerance study in rabbits (Study 
report M387-06) after SC and IV administration.  
2.3.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
There were no single dose toxicity studies submitted. 
2.3.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics) 
Each product was administered SC to male and female Sprague Dawley rats once a day for 28 
consecutive days, at dose levels of 20, 80 or 320 μg/kg/day. Control animals received vehicle. 
Changes attributable to pharmacological activity, such as dose-dependent increases in white blood cell 
counts, absolute neutrophil counts, monocytes and basophils were observed in both sexes. Other 
findings included a dose-dependent decrease in red blood cell count, myeloid hyperplasia of the bone 
marrow, increased extramedullary hematopoiesis in spleen and liver, and dose-related increased 
absolute and relative spleen weights in both sexes, as well as decreased absolute and relative liver 
weights in males only. A dose-related articular swelling of the hind legs and hind leg dysfunction was 
observed in both treatment groups. Histopathological analysis revealed joint alterations, such as 
periostal inflammatory changes, hyperostosis, osteolysis and/or myelofibrosis. The bone changes were 
accompanied by a dose-dependent increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity over control values.  
2.3.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
There were no genotoxicity studies submitted. 
2.3.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
There were no carcinogenicity studies submitted. 
2.3.4.5.  Reproduction Toxicity 
There were no reproduction toxicity studies submitted. 
2.3.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
The toxicokinetic data was collected in the repeat-dose toxicity study and is described under the 
section Pharmacokinetics.

2.3.4.7.  Local tolerance  
Local tolerance (Study report M387-06) was investigated in New Zealand White rabbits. One group 
received Nivestim IV (left ear vein) and SC (two sites on the upper dorsal torso) and the vehicle (right 
ear vein and two sites on the lower dorsal torso). The second group received Neupogen and vehicle in 
a similar manner. A single administration was given at each injection site using undiluted drug at a 
volume of 0.5 ml/injection (480 μg/0.5 ml). Thus each rabbit received a total dose of 1,440 μg 
Nivestim or Neupogen.  
Evaluation of local tolerance showed that both were well tolerated when administered once by SC and 
IV routes. Injection sites were examined after repeated SC dosing as part of the repeat-dose toxicity 
study. All lesions were scored as minimal to mild.There were no differences in the injection site 
reactions between the two products. 
2.3.4.8.  Other toxicity studies - Immunogenicity 
Main, recovery and satellite animal groups were tested for antibody formation, and animals from the 
recovery and satellite groups were tested for neutralising antibodies (NAbs). The occurrence of anti-G-
CSF antibodies appeared to be low in both Nivestim and Neupogen treated groups. NAbs were detected 
in only a few of those animals that had developed binding antibodies. A decrease in plasma drug levels 
was detected in four animals in which NAbs were detected.  When it was possible to compare antibody 
formation with toxicokinetic data, it was observed that in two animals from Nivestim (20 μg/kg/day) 
and two animals from Neupogen (20 μg/kg/day) treated groups, the plasma drug concentration was 
substantially reduced after 28 days of treatment when both binding antibodies and NAbs titer were 
detected simultaneously (Day 30).There was no significant difference in occurrence of NAbs between 
the two products. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The lack of an environmental risk assessment for Nivestim is justified by two reasons: 
1.  Nivestim is being developed as a biological medicinal product similar (Article 10.4 of Directive 
2001/83/EC as amended) to Neupogen, medicinal product with marketing authorisation valid in 
the European Union. Based on the fact that filgrastim medicinal product is prescription only 
medicine and because it is intended to substitute other identical products on the market, the 
approval of the referred product should not result on an increase of the total quantity of 
filgrastim released in the environment. Therefore, it should not result in an increase of risk to 
the environment.  
2.  Furthermore, in accordance with the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of 
Medicinal Products for Humans Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), amino acid, peptides and 
proteins are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment and no environmental risk 
assessment is required. 
The CHMP agreed with the justification proposed by the applicant.

2.3.6.  Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacodynamic data presented in the MAA dossier are considered sufficient and in accordance 
with the current guidance from the non-clinical aspect and with respect to the legal basis of the 
application. The pharmacokinetic behaviour and pharmacodynamic response in healthy rats to Nivestim 
and the reference product Neupogen can be considered to be comparable. 
The pharmacological activity and pharmacodynamic response of Nivestim and Neupogen exhibited 
comparable receptor-binding properties in vitro in cell-based assays and comparable biological activity  
in vivo in neutropenic rats.  
 Neutrophil counts were also determined as part of the repeat-dose toxicity study in healthy male and 
female rats. During the 28-day treatment period, Nivestim and Neupogen induced a comparable 
pharmacodynamic response. The results showed statistically significant dose-dependent increases in 
neutrophil counts (ANC) over vehicle controls. On cessation of treatment, neutrophil counts rapidly 
declined and had returned to normal levels two days after the last treatment. Sporadic statistically 
significant differences between the two products were observed during the recovery period. However, 
the regression analysis of dose-response curves for neutrophil counts were comparable. 
Drug plasma levels were determined in the groups of 4 animals/sex/time-point on Day 1 and Day 28. 
An adequately adjusted and validated commercial ELISA-based human G-CSF immunoassay was used 
for quantification of plasma levels of Nivestim and Neupogen. Differences were observed in exposure 
(AUC), peak concentration (Cmax) and half-life of the two products at certain dose levels and study 
days in both males and females. The observed differences were not consistent in direction of change, 
dose or gender. Regression analysis explored difference in the slopes of the lines for Nivestim and 
Neupogen on Day 28. The small number of animals per group may partly explain the substantial inter-
animal variation in plasma drug levels. Although differences in some of the PK parameters were 
observed, the pharmacodynamic response in healthy animals appeared to be comparable. Thus, the 
pharmacokinetic behaviour of Nivestim and the reference product Neupogen can be considered to be 
comparable. 
Histopathologic changes in the 28-day repeat-dose toxicity study were in general qualitatively and 
quantitatively similar between Nivestim and Neupogen treated groups. The minor differences in degree 
and/or frequency of the various changes observed were not considered to be biologically meaningful. 
Therefore, the toxicological profile of Nivestim can be considered comparable to the reference product 
Neupogen. 
Evaluation of local tolerance showed that both compounds were well tolerated when administered once 
by SC and IV routes. No difference between Nivestim and Neupogen could be seen. Injection sites 
were examined and there were no relevant differences between injection-related lesions at SC sites 
treated with placebo, Nivestim or Neupogen for either males or females. Injection site reactions were 
considered comparative between the two products. 
The occurrence of anti-G-CSF antibodies appeared to be low in both Nivestim and Neupogen treated 
groups. NAbs were detected in only a few of those animals that had developed binding antibodies. A 
decrease in plasma drug levels was detected in four animals in which neutralising antibodies were 
detected.  There was no significant difference in occurrence of neutralising antibodies between the two 
products.  
During the assessment, minor concerns were raised on the demonstration of biosimilarity of Nivestim 
and the reference product Neupogen in terms of biological activity, the impact of retrospective 
validation of immunogenicity assays on the interpretation of the results and the contradiction in 
reporting related to statistical analysis of the pharmacodynamic response data.  The applicant provided 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/262762/2010   
Page 15/48
 
 
 
adequate and sufficient responses to the questions. Analytical comparative data was presented for 
both products where characterisation data indicated very similar characteristics and biological activity 
for both products. The retrospectively extended method validation appeared to induce no additional 
changes than those indicated for the results of the ELISA screening assay and thus, interpretation and 
conclusions drawn from the data were considered valid. Finally, the contradiction in reporting was 
clarified as caused by erroneous reporting.  
2.3.6.1.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In conclusion, the non-clinical assessment of Nivestim did not reveal any important differences in 
terms of activity and toxicity between Nivestim and Neupogen. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
A clinical development programme was designed to show biosimilarity of Nivestim to Neupogen. The 
first stage of the programme consisted of two phase I, single-centre, randomised, open-label, healthy 
volunteer studies designed to compare the PK, PD, and safety characteristics of Nivestim and 
Neupogen when given as single (study GCF061) and multiple doses (study GCF062). The second stage 
of the programme consisted of a phase III, randomised, multicentre, double-blind study designed to 
demonstrate the therapeutic equivalence of Nivestim and Neupogen in the prophylaxis of neutropenia 
in patients undergoing a myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimen (study GCF071).  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The clinical development program was performed in agreement with the Scientific Advices issued by 
EMA on February 18, 2005 (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/50208/05, Procedure No.: EMEA/H/SA/562/1/2004/III) 
and on June 28, 2006 (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/228511/2006, Procedure No.: 
EMEA/H/SA/562/1/FU/1/2006/II). The PK and PD studies were designed and developed in accordance 
with the Guidance on biosimilar medicinal products containing recombinant granulocyte-colony 
stimulating factor (Annex guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-
derived proteins as active substance: non-clinical and clinical issues, EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/31329/2005), 
in order to show similarity between Nivestim and Neupogen. The phase III study design and endpoints 
were in accordance with the recommended clinical guidance for the demonstration of comparability of 
Nivestim to Neupogen. In agreement with the guidelines on clinical safety, data on adverse events 
(AEs) were collected in all studies and, as there is potential for an immune response in the form of 
antibodies against G-CSF, information on immunogenicity was collected in studies GCF062 and GCF071 
using two validated bioanalytical assays.

The applied and approved indication for Nivestim was: 
Filgrastim is indicated for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile 
neutropenia in patients treated with established cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the 
exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes) and for the reduction in the 
CHMP assessment report

duration of neutropenia in patients undergoing myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow 
transplantation considered to be at increased risk of prolonged severe neutropenia. 
The safety and efficacy of filgrastim are similar in adults and children receiving cytotoxic 
chemotherapy. 
Filgrastim is indicated for the mobilisation of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC). 
In patients, children or adults, with severe congenital, cyclic, or idiopathic neutropenia with an 
absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of ≤ 0.5 x 109 /l and a history of severe or recurrent infections, long 
term administration of filgrastim is indicated to increase neutrophil counts and to reduce the incidence 
and duration of infection-related events. 
Filgrastim is indicated for the treatment of persistent neutropenia (ANC ≤ 1.0 x 109 /l) in patients with 
advanced HIV infection, in order to reduce the risk of bacterial infections when other options to 
manage neutropenia are inappropriate. 
2.4.2.  GCP 
The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.   
2.4.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Two phase I trials (GCF061 and GCF062) were carried out to study pharmacokinetics (PK) and 
demonstrate biosimilarity between Nivestim and Neupogen, the reference product.  
Subjects in study GCF061 received a single dose (10 μg/kg) of Nivestim and Neupogen in random 
order and the primary objective was to compare the PK of Nivestim with Neupogen, administered as a 
single IV or SC dose. There was a washout period of at least 13 days between treatments. A secondary 
objective was to compare the pharmacodynamics (PD) and safety of Nivestim with Neupogen, 
administered as a single IV or SC dose. The primary endpoint for both the IV and SC routes of 
administration was AUC(0-tlast) for the plasma concentration of G-CSF. The secondary PK endpoints were 
Cmax, Tmax, T1/2, AUC(0-inf), λ, and Cl for the plasma concentration of G-CSF; the secondary PD endpoints 
were absolute neutrophil count (ANC) AUC(0-tlast), ANC Tmax, ANCmax, ANCmin.  
Study GCF062 was a single-centre, randomised, double-blind, multiple-dose, comparator-controlled, 
two-way crossover study which compared the PD of Nivestim with Neupogen, administered as multiple 
SC doses. Subjects were randomised to one of two doses (10 μg/kg or 5 μg/kg) and further 
randomised to order of treatment. Subjects received a total of five SC injections of Nivestim (at one of 
two doses) or Neupogen (at a matching dose level) over five consecutive days, crossing over to the 
alternative treatment in the second treatment period, with a washout period of at least 13 days 
between the last dose of the Treatment Period 1 and the first dose of Treatment Period 2. The primary 
and secondary objective for study GCF062 were to compare the PD, PK and safety of Nivestim with 
Neupogen, administered as multiple SC doses. The primary endpoint was the absolute neutrophil count 
(ANC) and AUC(0-tlast) at Day 5. The secondary PK endpoints were Cmax, Cmin, Tmax, T1/2, AUC(0-tlast), 
AUC(0-24), AUC(0-inf), λ, and Cl for the plasma concentration of G-CSF at Day 5; the secondary PD 
endpoints were ANC Tmax, ANCmax, ANCmin and CD34+ cell count at Day 5.

Analytical methods 
Plasma G-CSF levels were detected using a commercial kit method (Quantikine human G-CSF ELISA), 
which uses the quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay technique. The assay was validated for 
use in human plasma and an initial analysis of the study plasma G-CSF samples was performed. The 
PK results were found to be inaccurate and a repeat validation and re-analysis of the GCF061 and 
GCF062 PK data were performed. The applicant established a final detection range for G-CSF between 
80 pg/ml. (LLOQ) and 2500 pg/mL (ULOQ).   
• 
Pharmacokinetic data and Statistical analysis 
The PK population consisted of all subjects who completed the studies with a sufficient number of 
quantifiable concentrations to warrant parameter estimation in any study treatment period.  Analysis of 
PK parameters was based on this population. For both the IV and SC routes of administration, PK data 
was analysed by non-compartmental methods with WinNonlin (Standard version 1, Pharsight 
Corporation, Mountain View, California) and modelled for constant intravenous infusion. 
For each of IV and SC routes of administration, the parameter AUC(0-tlast) was log transformed and 
analysed using a mixed effects analysis of variance (ANOVA) with terms including subject within 
sequence as a random effect and sequence treatment and period as fixed effects. A 90% confidence 
interval for the ratio of the ‘test’ to ‘reference’ treatment means, after adjustment for other factors in 
the model, was calculated using the least square estimates of the means and the residual variance 
from the model. If the 90% confidence interval was within the conventional bioequivalence limits of 0.8 
and 1.25, then bioequivalence was declared reached. AUC(0-inf) and Cmax were log transformed and 
analysed in the same manner as the primary endpoint. The PK parameter T1/2 was not initially log-
transformed; however, since log transformation improved its adherence to the assumptions for 
analysis of variance, this parameter was subsequently transformed and analysed in the same manner 
as the primary endpoint. 
The Cl, λ and Tmax parameters arising from the PK data were summarised. The approximate 
bioavailability of the test treatment, comparing the PK variable AUC(0-tlast) after IV and SC 
administration, were evaluated as supportive data only.  
Data were analysed and reported using SAS Version 8.2 
2.4.3.1.  Absorption  
There were no studies on absorption submitted. 
2.4.3.2.  Distribution 
PK data from study GCF061 suggests that 10 μg/kg doses of Nivestim and Neupogen are bioequivalent 
in healthy volunteers when administered by either the IV or SC routes (table 2, 3, 4 and 5).

The PK data from study GCF062 is presented in Table 6 and 7 below.  The results show that in the 10 
μg/kg subgroup, the ratio of AUC(0-tlast) between Nivestim and Neupogen was 1.150 (90%CI, 1.034-
1.279) and the ratio of Cmax between Nivestim and Neupogen was 1.136 (90%CI, 1.002-1.287). The 
90%CIs were slightly above the upper limit of the pre-defined equivalence range of 0.80-1.25. 
The ratios of AUC(0-tlast) (AUC(0-24)) in the 5 μg/kg  subgroup between Nivestim and Neupogen  was  
1.097 (90%CI, 0.988-1.218) where the 90%CIs were within the pre-defined equivalence range of 
0.80-1.25.  The ratio of Cmax between Nivestim and Neupogen was 1.129 (90%CI, 0.980-1.300). The 
90%CI was above the upper limit of the pre-defined equivalence range of 0.80-1.25.

There were no studies on the mechanism of action submitted. 
Based on the SmPC of Neupogen, human G-CSF is a glycoprotein which regulates the production and 
release of functional neutrophils from the bone marrow. Nivestim containing r-metHuG-CSF (filgrastim) 
causes marked increases in peripheral blood neutrophil counts within twenty-four hours, with minor 
increases in monocytes. In some severe chronic neutropenia patients filgrastim can also induce a 
minor increase in the number of circulating eosinophils and basophils relative to baseline; some of 
these patients may present with eosinophilia or basophilia already prior to treatment. Elevations of 
neutrophil counts are dose-dependent at recommended doses. Neutrophils produced in response to 
filgrastim show normal or enhanced function as demonstrated by tests of chemotactic and phagocytic 
function. Following termination of filgrastim therapy, circulating neutrophil counts decrease by 50% 
within 1 to 2 days, and to normal levels within 1 to 7 days (SmPC section 5.1).

2.4.4.2.  Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The primary PD endpoint for study GCF062 was ANC AUC(0-tlast) at Day 5. Results for the 10 μg/kg dose 
group and the 5 μg/kg dose group are shown in Table 8 and 9, respectively. 
Table 8

Table 9 
ANC AUC (0-tlast) for 5μg/kg dose (pg.h/ml) – Study GCF062 
The geometric mean ANC AUC(0-tlast) values for treatment with 10 μg/kg and 5 μg/kg dose Nivestim and 
Neupogen were similar and the ratio was 0.969 (90%CI, 0.928-1.012) and 0.984 (90%CI, 0.922-
1.050), respectively. The 90%CI was within the pre-defined equivalence range of 0.80-1.25. When 
outliers were excluded, the ratio for ANC AUC(o-tlast) for 10 μg/kg and 5 μg/kg dose between Nivestim 
and Neupogen was 0.980 (90%CI, 0.942-1.020) and 0.995 (90%CI, 0.960-1.030), respectively. 
Figure 2 and 3 shows the mean ANC in the PD population for the 10μg/kg and 5 μg/kg dose, 
respectively.

The geometric mean ANC AUC(0-tlast) values for the SC Nivestim and Neupogen  treatment groups were 
similar and the ratio of means was 1.027 (90%CI, 0.991-1.064) for population 1. When outliers were 
excluded, the ratio of AUC(0-tlast) between Nivestim and Neupogen was 1.048 (90%CI, 1.020-1.077).  
Average values for ANC Tmax were generally comparable for subjects receiving IV and those receiving 
SC, but were slightly later in the latter group. The geometric mean ANCmax values for the SC Nivestim 
and Neupogen treatment groups were also similar; the ratio of means was 1.043 (90%CI, 0.981-
1.109) for PD population 1. When outliers were excluded, the ratio of ANCmax between Nivestim and 
Neupogen was 1.058 (90%CI, 0.998-1.122). The geometric mean ANCmin values for the SC Nivestim 
and Neupogen treatment groups were comparable; the ratio of means was 1.128 (90%CI, 0.828-
1.537), meaning the CI was outside the pre-defined equivalence range of 0.80-1.25. The same 
occurred for the ratio of ANCmin between Nivestim and Neupogen which was 1.148 (90%CI, 0.938-
1.405), when outliers were excluded.  
In general, the results for the Population 2 were similar to Population 1 for SC and IV administration.  
When the 95%CI for the ratio of the mean ANC AUC(0-tlast) value measured at Day 5 in the PD 
population 1,  it was also well within the pre-defined equivalence range in both IV treatment group 
(95%CI, 0.986-1.085) as well as SC treatment group (95%CI, 0.984-1.072). Also in PD population 2, 
the 95%CI for the ratio was within the range 0.974 - 1.082 and 0.994 - 1.079 in IV and SC groups, 
respectively. The equivalence was not shown for the ANCmin value which was out of 95%CI equivalence 
range in both upper and lower boundary (0.777, 1.639 and 0.703, 1.436) in SC subjects (PD 
Population 1 and 2) and below lower limit (0.654, 1.060 and 0.728, 1055) in IV subjects.   
Secondary pharmacology was studied only in trial GCF062. Pharmacodynamic endpoints (mean 
ANCmax, ANCmin, ANC Tmax and CD34+) for subjects in the 10 μg/kg dose group and 5 μg/kg dose 
group are presented in Table 12 and 13. Results show the mean ANCmax, ANCmin and CD34+ were 
equivalent for subjects receiving both Nivestim and Neupogen and ANC Tmax occurred slightly earlier 
following treatment with Nivestim (7.845 h) compared to treatment with Neupogen (9.448 h). Similar 
results were obtained with 5 μg/kg dose group.

2.4.4.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The healthy volunteer study GCF061 demonstrated that bioequivalence between Nivestim and 
Neupogen could be established and the results from study GCF062 support this conclusion.  
Study GCF062 was performed according to the EMEA/CHMP Guidance on Similar Medicinal Products 
containing recombinant granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/31329/2005). It is 
not a requirement to study PD parameters in both SC and IV administration, however it may be useful 
to have the information. The applicant studied PD in two different dose levels (5 and 10 μg/kg). The 5 
μg/kg dose curve showed linearity in the ascending part of the dose-response curve. There is 
consistency in the results of both doses, demonstrating the equivalence between Nivestim and 
Neupogen in the SC route. The CHMP noted that a shorter wash-out period was used in comparison to 
the reference products BE study referred (EMEA/502481/2008) but this had no impact on the clinical 
relevance.  
The CHMP noted that the results of the primary endpoints in pharmacology confirmed the 
bioequivalence between Nivestim and Neupogen. The primary endpoint ANC AUC was equivalent with 
both IV and SC administration and within the pre-defined 90%CI equivalence range of 0.80-1.25. 
Tmax seems to appear slightly earlier with Nivestim but this was considered to have no clinical 
relevance. The only value outside the pre-defined 90%CI equivalence rate was ANCmin in Study 
GCF061 for both SC and IV administration. It is of note that when given IV, Nivestim had lower values 
than Neupogen, while with SC administration the situation was reversed.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/262762/2010

As per the guideline, the CD34+ cell count was reported as a secondary endpoint. The level of CD34+ 
cells exceeded the upper limit of the allowed equivalence range in Nivestim PD population in both 10 
μg/kg dose group (95%CI, 0.872-1.285), and in 5 μg/kg dose group (95%CI, 0.821-1.283). However, 
the geometric mean CD34+ values were similar for both Nivestim and Neupogen hence establishing 
equivalence between the two products.  
 As part of a major objection at D120, the CHMP requested a discussion on the choice of 90% CI 
instead of 95% CI for the pharmacodynamic endpoint in study GCF062 and to demonstrate assay 
sensitivity for the primary PD parameters. At the request of the CHMP, the applicant reanalyzed the 
data for the PD endpoint according to the 95% confidence interval. The ratio of the mean ANC AUC(0-
tlast) value, in both 10 μg/kg and 5 μg/kg single dose groups was within the 95%CI range of 0.80 - 
1.25, fulfilling the equivalence criteria. Pharmacodynamic endpoints for subjects in PD Population 1 and 
for subjects in PD Population 2 demonstrated that IV and SC Nivestim and Neupogen are considered 
equivalent. Except for ANCmin, generally the 95%CIs were within the pre-defined equivalence range of 
0.80-1.25 showing that the two treatments were bioequivalent for these endpoints. The ANC value 
curves for both treatments were also considered comparable. 
The CHMP had some concern about the reliability of G-CSF plasma concentration analysis. The 
applicant addressed the concern by providing data from an assay that was designed to measure G-CSF 
levels in plasma and data from an ELISA assay validated for measuring G-CSF in human plasma  The 
stability assay in different temperatures and G-CSF concentrations showed no loss of G-CSF activity 
even after 3 freeze-thaw cycles. The applicant provided further comments on the specificity of the 
assay for the intact G-CSF protein and the specificity of the antibodies used for the detection of all 
forms of G-CSF.  
2.4.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In conclusion, the clinical pharmacology assessment of Nivestim did not reveal any important 
differences in terms of bioequivalence between Nivestim and Neupogen. 
2.4.5.  Clinical efficacy  
The clinical programme for demonstrating biosimilarity between Nivestim and Neupogen included one 
phase III study, which was conducted in patients with breast cancer who received G-CSF prophylaxis in 
addition to a normal chemotherapy (Study GCF071). 
2.4.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
As this application relates to a biosimilar product, there is no requirement for dose-response studies 
and no dose response studies were submitted. The dose for Nivestim is the same as for the reference 
products Neupogen. The recommended dose of Neupogen is 5–12 μg/kg/day, depending on the 
indication. The dose of 5 μg/kg/day Nivestim or Neupogen was chosen as this is the dose licensed for 
breast cancer.

2.4.5.2.1.2.  Treatments 
Prior to receiving chemotherapy, all subjects were to receive pre-medication in the form of 
dexamethasone 8 mg b.i.d. for 3 days starting on Day -1, the day before chemotherapy is given. 
Eligible subjects received chemotherapy comprising doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 (bolus injection) and 
docetaxel 75 mg/m2 on day 1 of cycles 1 to 6.  
Treatment with Nivestim or Neupogen at 5 μg/kg by SC injection was initiated on Day 2 of each cycle 
at least 24 hours after of administration of chemotherapy. It was administered once daily for 14 days, 
on Days 2 to 15 of each cycle, or until the documented nadir had passed and the ANC was >3 x 109/L, 
whichever occurs first. During cycle 1, the decision to dose the subject was based on the ANC result 
from the previous day. Since haematology was assessed less frequently from cycle 2 onwards, the 
decision to dose the subjects in the following cycles was based on the most recent ANC result. 
The required volume of IMP for administration during each cycle was based on the subject’s actual 
bodyweight on Day 1 of the cycle. 
2.4.5.2.1.3.  Objectives 
The primary objective of this trial was to demonstrate the therapeutic equivalence of Nivestim and 
Neupogen.  
The secondary objectives were to compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of Nivestim and 
Neupogen and to compare the immunogenicity of Nivestim and Neupogen. 
2.4.5.2.1.4.  Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint of this study was the duration of severe neutropenia (DSN) in days (ANC <0.5 x 
109/L) in cycle 1. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints were: 
• DSN (ANC <0.5 x 109/L) in cycles 2 to 3; 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/262762/2010   
Page 29/48
 
 
 
• Time to ANC recovery (ANC >3 x 109/L) in cycles 1 to 3; 
• Incidence of febrile neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L and body temperature of 38.5 ºC) in cycles 1 to 
3; 
• Incidence of documented infection in cycles 1 to 3; 
• Cumulative dose of Nivestim or Neupogen 
Secondary safety endpoints were: 
• Incidence and duration of hospitalisation of subjects with febrile neutropenia; 
• Incidence of adverse events; 
• Changes in laboratory safety parameters; 
• G-CSF antibody formation 
2.4.5.2.1.5.  Sample size 
For a 2:1 randomisation of filgrastim Nivestim versus Neupogen, the sample size required would be 
144 and 72 evaluable subjects respectively (total of 216 subjects). This sample size is based on using 
a primary endpoint of DSN in cycle 1 (measured in days) with an equivalence range of (±1 day), an 
expected true difference in mean DSN of <0.25 days, a common standard deviation of 1.6 days and a 
power of 90%. Assuming at least a 20% drop-out rate (where these subjects will not be eligible for the 
Per Protocol analysis) a total of 279 subjects (186 and 93 subjects for Nivestim and Neupogen, 
respectively) would be required to be randomised into the study. 
2.4.5.2.1.6.  Randomisation 
Subjects were randomly allocated (2:1) to one of two treatment arms: Nivestim (5 μg/kg) or 
Neupogen (5 μg/kg). Subjects were stratified according to country and treatment setting: 
neoadjuvant/adjuvant versus metastatic. Randomisation was performed using IVRS. 
2.4.5.2.1.7.  Blinding (masking) 
The treatment was double-blind that is, neither the subject nor study site staff knew which treatment 
(Nivestim or Neupogen) was being taken. 
2.4.5.2.1.8.  Statistical methods 
No interim analysis was planned. 
Continuous data was summarised by treatment group using summary statistics (n, mean, standard 
deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (as a percentage CV%= SD/mean*100) median, minimum and 
maximum).  
Categorical data was summarised by treatment group using frequency counts and percentages. 
Percentages in summary tables were calculated out of the population denominator (the number of 
subjects in the relevant population or subgroup of a population) or out of the number of subjects with 
relevant recorded values, as indicated on each table template. Unless otherwise specified in the SAP 
missing data was not imputed, and analyses/summary presentations was based on available data at 
assessment time points.

Subjects were to receive up to 6 cycles of chemotherapy supported by IP; they did not have to 
complete all 6 cycles of chemotherapy in order to complete the study. Of the 184 subjects randomised 
to Nivestim, 8.2% (15/184) did not complete the study compared with 11.6% (11/95) of subjects 
randomised to Neupogen. 
There were 4 amendments to the final protocol dated 19 April 2007.  
Common deviations included those relating to incorrect visit windows, timing of IP/chemotherapy 
administration and timing of/missing laboratory assessments. The statistical analysis plan included 
prospective definitions of the Major Protocol Violations which would exclude subjects from the PP 
population.  
Following a review of the subject listings and the major protocol deviations by the applicant at the 
blinded data review meeting it was decided that 28 of the 278 subjects in the ITT and safety 
populations should be excluded from the PP population in Cycle 1 due to major protocol deviations, 41 
subjects in Cycle 2, and 46 subjects in Cycle 3. Eight subjects in the Nivestim group and 5 subjects in 
the Neupogen group had protocol deviations related to entry criteria, the majority of which were 
regarding hepatic function (alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, ALT and/or AST concentrations). Four 
subjects in the Nivestim group and 3 subjects in the Neupogen group were excluded from the PP 
population in all cycles due to hepatic function entry violation. One subject in the Nivestim group had a 
missing ANC result at study entry, which also excluded the subject from the PP population. Due to a 
misunderstanding of the dosing regimen in the protocol, study treatment was incorrectly stopped  
before ANC nadir which resulted in exclusion of a number of subjects from the PP population due to 
missed IP doses and ANC measurements (8), 14 subjects for Cycle 2, 11 subjects for Cycle 3, and 3 
subjects for Cycle 4. The subjects remained in the study and were included in the Safety population. 
2.4.5.2.1.11.  Baseline data 
In line with the study entry criteria, all subjects had breast cancer. The most common tumour stage 
was Stage IIB in the Nivestim group (24.6%) and Stage IIIA in the Neupogen group (24.2%). 
In both treatment groups, the most common treatment setting was adjuvant; 49.7% in the Nivestim 
group compared with 42.1% in the Neupogen group. Treatment was in the adjuvant/neoadjuvant 
setting for 84.7% of subjects in the Nivestim group and 81.1% in the Neupogen group. 
Treatment was in the metastatic setting for only 15.3% of subjects in the Nivestim group and 18.9% in 
the Neupogen group. The most common site of metastases in both treatment groups was the lymph 
node, recorded in 9.8% of subjects in the Nivestim group and 7.4% in the Neupogen group. 
The majority of subjects in both treatments groups had had past surgical treatment for their malignant 
disease (60.7% in the Nivestim group and 55.8% in the Neupogen group). 
2.4.5.2.1.12.  Numbers analysed 
The ITT population are those subjects in the safety population who had at least one post-dose ANC 
recorded. This population was used for supportive analysis of all primary and secondary efficacy

endpoints. The PP population include those subjects in the ITT population with no clinically significant 
protocol violations. This population was used as the primary analysis population for the primary 
analysis of DSN, and also used for all secondary efficacy endpoints. A total of 250, 237 and 232 
subjects were included in the PP population for Cycles 1, 2 and 3, respectively.

The mean DSN was 1.6 days (SD 1.20) in the Nivestim group compared with 1.3 days (SD 1.08) in the 
Neupogen group. The 90%CI for the difference of the treatment means lies within the pre-defined 
range -1 to +1 day. A higher proportion of Nivestim subjects experienced severe neutropenia in Cycle 
1 compared with Neupogen subjects: 128/165 (77.6%) on Nivestim compared with 58/85 (68.2%) on 
Neupogen. Analysis of DSN in Cycle 1 gave adjusted means (adjusted for treatment setting, i.e. 
ANOVA least square means) of 1.85 and 1.47 days for Nivestim and Neupogen, respectively, with a 
difference between the two treatment groups means of 0.38 (95%CI, 0.08-0.68) (Table 16).  
Table 16

A comparable result was achieved with the ITT population where the difference in DSN means between 
the treatments was 0.43 days (95%CI, 0.13-0.73).   
In subjects with severe neutropenia, the majority (93.3%) of subjects in the Nivestim group and all 
(100%) subjects in the Neupogen group had a DSN of less than 3 days. Eleven subjects (6.7%) in the 
Nivestim group had a DSN of 4 or 5 days: 10 (6.1%) had a DSN of 4 days and 1 (0.8%) had a DSN of 
5 days. Of the 10 subjects in the Nivestim group with a DSN of 4 days, two had febrile neutropenia 
(ANC < 0.5 x 109/L and body temperature ≥ 38.5°C) in the same cycle. The one subject with a DSN of 
5 days also had febrile neutropenia in the same cycle.

Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The DSN in cycle 2 for the PP population is presented in Table 17. In subjects with severe neutropenia 
in Cycle 2, the DSN was 1-3 days for 98.7% (74/75) of subjects in the Nivestim group and 93.1% 
(27/29) in the Neupogen group. One (1.3% (1/75)) and two (6.9% (2/29)) cases of severe 
neutropenia in the Nivestim group and the Neupogen group, respectively, lasted 4 days. No subjects 
experienced DSN beyond 4 days. A higher proportion of Nivestim subjects experienced severe 
neutropenia in Cycle 2 compared with that of Neupogen subjects: 75/154 (48.7%) subjects on 
Nivestim compared with 29/83 (34.9%) on Neupogen.

The DSN in cycle 3 for the PP population is presented in Table 18. A lower proportion of Nivestim 
subjects experienced severe neutropenia in Cycle 3 compared with that of Neupogen subjects: 60/154 
(39.0%) for Nivestim compared with 33/78 (42.3%) for Neupogen. In subjects with severe 
neutropenia in cycle 3, the DSN was 1-3 days in 96.7% (58/60) and 100% (33/33) of subjects for 
Nivestim and Neupogen, respectively. Two (3.3% (2/60)) cases of severe neutropenia in the Nivestim 
group lasted 4 days. No subjects experienced DSN beyond 4 days.

2.4.5.2.1.14.  Ancillary analyses 
To determine whether there were differences seen in the clinical variables between Nivestim and 
Neupogen which could bias the conclusion observed between the two arms in mean DSN Cycles 1-3, 
incidence of infection, use of prophylactic antibiotic and cumulative dose in the study treatment was 
reported.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/262762/2010   
Page 36/48
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The incidence of documented infection was low and was similar between the two treatment groups. 
The proportion of subjects experiencing one or more infections in Cycles 1-3 was 3.0% in the Nivestim 
compared with 3.5% in the Neupogen group.   
Prophylactic antibiotics were administered to 15 (8.2%) and 8 (8.4%) subjects in Cycle 1 for Nivestim 
and Neupogen, respectively; 11 (6.0%) and 4 (4.2%) subjects, respectively, in Cycle 2; and 11 
(6.0%) and 4 (4.2%) subjects, respectively, in Cycle 3. Taking Cycles 1-3 combined, this affected 17 
(9.3%) and 8 (8.4%) subjects for Nivestim and Neupogen respectively. 
The mean number of injections given to subjects in Cycles 1-3 and Cycles 4-6 were similar between 
the two treatment groups (Table 21).

2.4.5.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
As this application relates to a biosimilar product, there is no requirement for dose-response studies. 
The chosen dose referenced to the reference product Neupogen was acceptable. This view was 
supported by CHMP/SAWP based on the fact that Nivestim and Neupogen are structurally identical and 
as long as the bioequivalence with Neupogen in phase I studies showing similar ANC profiles and 
comparable pharmacokinetics could be demonstrated. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/262762/2010   
Page 37/48
 
 
 
 
 
 
The statistical data provided demonstrated the similarity between the test and reference products in 
both pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic effects. There were concerns over the statistical design of 
the ANOVA analysis and the recording of the subjects included. The CHMP noted that the clarification of 
the model design used in two-way, two-period, crossover trial was adequate and the p values provided 
for the sequence effect indicated a low probability for carryover effect.  
Overall, the two treatment groups in the pivotal phase III study GCF071 had similar baseline 
characteristics, including tumour staging, sites of metastasis, and past treatment for malignant 
disease. There were no major differences between the two treatment groups in any demographic 
variable or baseline disease characteristic (including tumour staging, sites of metastases, and past 
treatment for malignant disease). 
The CHMP noted that the study GCF071 was conducted according to the guideline 
EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 and supported the use of the chosen reference product as a 
comparator. The assay sensitivity of the study, as required in the guideline, was part of the major 
objection as it had not been demonstrated. The applicant responded by providing literature references 
that the combination chemotherapy induced severe neutropenia and also gave historical evidence of 
sensitivity of the drug effect in the form of a comparison with the results of a similar conducted trial 
XM02 study (Ratiograstim EPAR)  to the GCF071 trial (same study population, concomitant therapy 
and endpoints). The CHMP noted that the applicant justified adequately the issues concerning the 
study sensitivity to detect equivalence and the validation of the measurement. 
The CHMP had concerns over the results obtained for the PP and ITT population with regards to its 
clinical relevance. The applicant justified the use of PP population for the calculation of the primary 
endpoint accordingly and the results from the bioequivalence study show that the non-inferiority was 
proven for both populations, i.e. PP and ITT. The exclusion of subjects in the clinical trial was 
conducted according to the predefined criteria. The applicant was asked to explain the discrepancy in 
the number of withdrawn subjects reported. The applicant provided an explanation which was 
considered acceptable by the CHMP.  
The mean time to ANC recovery in Cycles 1, 2 and 3 in the PP population were similar in both 
treatment groups. The proportion of subjects with ANC > 3 x 109/L in Cycles 1, 2 and 3 was lowest 
within the expected period of severe neutropenia, Days 4-10 of the cycle, which is as expected for this 
class of treatment.  
The Nivestim study group showed a greater proportion of patients with severe neutropenia than 
Neupogen study group in Cycle 1 (77,6 % vs 68,2%) and cycle 2. Also DSN lasted longer in the 
Nivestim study group. The clinical significance of the difference was part of a major objection. It was 
concluded that the incidence of febrile neutropenia, the number of infections as well as the number of 
needed injections were similar in both groups. The difference in the proportion of the severe 
neutropenia does not seem to affect the other variables measuring the severity of clinical condition of 
the subjects. These findings were not statistically significant. The number of drop outs in the study 
population was the main concern with regards to the significance of the slightly inferior response to the 
treatment in Nivestim group. According to the data provided, the duration of the severe neutropenia in 
subjects withdrawn was proportionally similar in both treatment arms thus having no significant effect 
on the result.  
2.4.5.7.  Conclusion on clinical efficacy 
In summary, the data submitted were sufficient to allow to conclude therapeutic equivalence between 
the two products in terms of efficacy. Both the primary efficacy results (DSN in Cycle 1) and the 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/262762/2010   
Page 38/48
 
 
 
secondary efficacy results (DSN in Cycles 2 and 3 among the others) showed no significant difference 
between Nivestim and Neupogen. 
2.4.6.  Clinical safety 
2.4.6.1.  Patient exposure 
Of the 279 randomised subjects in the GCF071 study, 278 were included in the Safety population. 
There were 183 Patients which received Nivestim and 95 patients received Neupogen. The extent of 
exposure by the number of injection received is summarised in the Table 22. 
Table 22 
Extent of exposure of breast cancer patients to Nivestim and 
Neupogen – Study GCF071 
Mean doses of Nivestim over cycles 1–6 received during the study was 42.0 (SD 9.74) compared with 
41.9 (SD 10.49) doses of Neupogen.  
2.4.6.2.  Adverse events  
In study GCF061, in the 10μg/kg group IV, the most common adverse events in each treatment group 
was nervous system disorders [considered treatment related for headache in 5 (25.0%) subjects 
receiving Nivestim and 8 (36.4%) subjects receiving Neupogen], musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders [considered treatment related in 7 (35.0%) subjects receiving Nivestim and 5 (22.7%) 
subjects receiving Neupogen]. In the 10μg/kg SC group, the most common treatment-related adverse 
events were back pain [nine (34.6%) and nine (34.6%), respectively, after Nivestim and Neupogen] 
and headache [seven (26.9%) and eight (30.8%) respectively]. 
In the multiple-dose study GCF062, most subjects (> 75%) experienced AEs during the study. The 
most common treatment-related AEs were back pain and headache in both the 10 μg/kg and 5 μg/kg 
dose groups. In the 10 μg/kg dose group, back pain was reported by 16 (61.5%) and 14 (56.0%) 
subjects and headache was reported by 14 (53.8%) and 11 (44.0%) subjects following Nivestim and 
Neupogen treatment, respectively. In the 5 μg/kg dose group, treatment-related back pain was 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/262762/2010

reported by 11 (45.8%) and nine (37.5%) subjects and headache was reported by 11 (45.8%) and 13 
(54.2%) subjects following Nivestim and Neupogen treatment respectively. 
In the study GCF071, a similar proportion of patients in the two treatment groups experienced AEs 
(86.9% and 84.2% in the Nivestim and Neupogen groups, respectively) and treatment-related AEs 
(24.6% and 23.2% in the Nivestim and Neupogen groups, respectively). The Table 23 is a summary of 
the adverse events and adverse reactions.

The total number of subjects experiencing one or more treatment-emergent AEs during Cycle 1 were 
125 (68.3%) on Nivestim and 56 (58.9%) on Neupogen. In general, AEs were most frequently 
reported in the system organ class of gastrointestinal disorders (the most common individual event 
was nausea); whereas, adverse reactions were most frequently reported in the system organ class of 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders in both treatment groups (Nivestim: n=35, 19.1%; 
Neupogen: n=18, 18.9%). The most common individual adverse reaction was bone pain; there was a 
higher incidence of bone pain in the Nivestim group (Nivestim: n=26, 14.2%; Neupogen: n=9, 9.5%). 
All of these events were mild or moderate in nature except one subject on Neupogen who had severe 
pain in the extremity. The vast majority of the cases with bone pain responded to non-narcotic drugs. 
During clinical studies 183 cancer patients and 96 healthy volunteers were exposed to filgrastim. The 
safety profile of filgrastim observed in these clinical studies was consistent with that reported with the 
reference product used in these studies (SmPC section 4.8). 
The occurrence of Sweet's syndrome (acute febrile dermatosis) has been reported occasionally. 
However, since a significant percentage of these patients were suffering from leukaemia, a condition 
known to be associated with Sweet's syndrome, a causal relationship with filgrastim has not been 
established (SmPC section 4.8).  
2.4.6.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In Study GCF062 there were no serious adverse events (SAEs) reported. There were two severe AEs  
(NCI CTCAE grade 4) reported in the healthy volunteer multiple dose Study (GCF062). One subject in 
the 10 μg/kg dose group suffered from headache, which was reported as severe and classed as 
possibly related to Neupogen treatment. One subject in the 5 μg/kg dose group suffered muscle 
spasms, which were classed as severe and probably related to Nivestim treatment.  
In the GCF071 study, with regard to serious adverse events, there were 12 (6.6%) subjects in the 
Nivestim group and 4 (4.2%) of subjects in the Neupogen group who experienced serious adverse 
events. Severe AEs (NCI CTCAE grade 4) were reported by 15 (8.2%) patients in the Nivestim group 
and 10 (10.5%) patients in the Neupogen group. Eight (4.4%) patients in the Nivestim group and 2 
(2.1%) patients in the Neupogen group reported life-threatening/disabling AEs.  None of the SAEs was 
considered related to study treatment. 
The organ system with the most severe or life-threatening/disabling AEs was blood and lymphatic 
system disorders. Febrile neutropenia was the most common individual severe AE reported and 
neutropenia was the most common life-threatening/disabling AE. The frequency of protocol-defined 
febrile neutropenia (ANC<0.5 x 109/L and body temperature ≥ 38.5°C) was similar in the two 
treatment arms. A total of six subjects [four (2.4%) in the Nivestim arm and two (2.4%) in the 
Neupogen arm] had febrile neutropenia over the Cycles 1 - 3 of the study.

There were no deaths reported during the studies GCF061 and GCF062. There was one death during 
study GCF071, a 49-year-old female subject with previous medical history of obesity, diabetes mellitus 
and essential hypertension. The cause of death was unknown. The investigator concluded that the 
patient’s death was unlikely to be related to the treatment but that an infection could not been ruled 
out.  
2.4.6.4.  Laboratory findings 
In severe chronic neutropenia patients, anemia is a very common undesirable effect of filgrastim.  In 
addition, elevated gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase GGT, alkaline phosphatase, LDH and uric acid 
values are also common undesirable effects of filgrastim which are documented in the SmPC of 
Neupogen. Based on the laboratory findings in study GCF071, no differences in these parameters were 
observed between the Nivestim group and the Neupogen reference group.  
Immunological events 
Blood samples for the assessment of anti-G-CSF antibodies were taken in patients in the study GCF062 
and study GCF071. Two assays were developed and validated to measure the presence of G-CSF 
antibodies: a screening antibody assay and a cell-based neutralising antibody assay. The neutralising 
assay was used to further analyse any positive samples. Subjects were either positive or negative for 
the presence of G-CSF antibodies and neutralising activity of  antibodies.  
In the GCF062 study, two subjects gave a positive antibody response following treatment. The 
incidence of detectable G-CSF antibodies was low. Three patients in the Nivestim treatment group 
(1.6%) had one or more post-treatment samples with a borderline positive result. NAbs were not 
found in three samples having borderline positive responses in the anti-G-CSF antibody screening. 
There was no evidence of a clinical effect on efficacy (neutrophil counts) or safety in the patients with 
borderline positive results. No patient in the Neupogen treatment group tested positive for G-CSF 
antibodies. 
2.4.6.5.  Safety in special populations 
There were no studies submitted in special populations. 
2.4.6.6.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
There were no studies submitted for drug-drug interactions and other interactions. 
2.4.6.7.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In study GCF061, one subject (5.0%) withdrew from the study owing to AEs where the subject 
experienced agitation, dyspnoea, dizziness, headache, a respiratory disorder, arthralgia, nausea, and 
pharynx dysaesthesia after receiving a single IV dose of 10 μg/kg Neupogen. All AEs were moderate in 
intensity and considered probably related to study treatment. 
In study GCF062, one subject (3.8%) was withdrawn from the study owing to AEs where the subject 
experienced moderate musculoskeletal chest pain and mild back pain following administration of three 
doses of 10 μg/kg Nivestim treatment. Both AEs were considered related to study treatment and both 
AEs subsequently resolved. 
There were six subjects (3.2%) in the study GCF071 who experienced AEs which led to withdrawal 
from the study (four [2.2%] patients in the Nivestim group and two [2.1%] patients in the Neupogen 
group). Two patients in the Nivestim group experienced three SAEs (lymphopenia, asthma, and deep 
vein thrombosis) and one patient in the Neupogen group experienced one SAE (appendicitis) leading to

withdrawal. One subject (0.5%) in the Nivestim group (117802) discontinued due to an AE reported as 
“febrile neutropenia”. 
2.4.6.8.  Post marketing experience 
There were no post-marketing studies submitted. 
2.4.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The CHMP considered that the study design with regards to evaluating the safety of Nivestim was 
acceptable. The applicant clarified the duration of the drug exposure adequately. A higher incidence of 
bone pain was observed with Nivestim, the pain being mild or moderate in intensity, and manageable 
by NSAID or paracetamol. Due to the higher incidence of bone pain and myalgia, these adverse events 
are addressed in the RMP and in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
The CHMP considered that that the development of antibody assays were poorly described and did not 
follow the guideline EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/14327/2006.  The applicant was asked to present the antibody 
testing strategy and define the cut-off points. The applicant responded by describing the analytical 
methods and the screening method. The bioanalytical test strategy used for evaluating serum samples 
for anti-G-CSF antibody included simultaneously screening for and confirmation of anti-G-CSF 
antibodies.  
The CHMP asked the applicant to submit a follow-up measure to present 6 month follow-up results for 
the NAbs assay results and follow up results. The applicant presented results which were consistent 
with the data provided from Neupogen. The CHMP considered that according to the data presented, 
there were no immune-mediated adverse effects or loss of efficacy. Due to the low number of patients 
that tested positive for anti-G-CSF antibodies, it could be possible that immunogenicity could go 
undetected. A potential higher risk of immunogenicity in individuals treated with Nivestim compared to 
Neupogen cannot be excluded. Therefore, the CHMP recommended that follow-up measures with 
regards to immunogenicity should be implemented in the event of a possibility of low-level 
immunogenicity not detected by the analytical method used. This issue is addressed in the RMP.  
The report and the conclusion of the one death case in the GCF071 study was found to be sufficient. 
The applicant was also asked to explain the higher number of febrile neutropenia cases reported in the 
Nivestim group in relation to the Neupogen group. The applicant clarified that the incidence of febrile 
neutropenia in both treatments were identical.  
2.4.6.10.  Conclusion on clinical safety 
The CHMP considers that the overall safety profile of the product is acceptable. 
2.5.  Pharmacovigilance  
2.5.1.  Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
regulatory requirements. 
2.5.2.  Risk management plan 
The MAA submitted a risk management plan.

2.6.  Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation 
2.6.1.  Quality 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
The Applicant has successfully demonstrated biosimilarity between Nivestim and the reference 
medicinal product Neupogen (Amgen). 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no 
impact on the Risk-benefit balance of the product. The Applicant gave a Letter of Undertaking and 
committed to resolve these as follow-up measures after the opinion. 
2.6.2.  Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology 
The non-clinical evaluation of Nivestim is considered sufficient. Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic 
and toxicology data from published literature and from original studies did not reveal any differences in 
serious or common adverse effect in animals tested. There were no differences in the pharmacological 
activity of the test compound as demonstrated and compared to the activity of the reference product.  
2.6.3.  Efficacy 
The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data in healthy volunteers (ANC and CD34+ counts) with 
both IV and SC administration was presented to establish comparability between Nivestim and 
Neupogen.  A randomised, open-label, single-dose, comparator-controlled, two-way crossover study in 
46 healthy volunteers showed that the pharmacokinetic profile of Nivestim was comparable in terms of 
AUC(0-tlast) for the plasma concentration of G-CSF to that of the reference product after subcutaneous 
and intravenous administration. The secondary endpoints (Cmax, Tmax, T1/2, AUC(0-inf), λz, and Cl for the 
plasma concentration of G-CSF and  absolute neutrophil count (ANC) AUC(0-tlast), ANC Tmax, ANCmax, 
ANCmin for the PD endpoints) were supportive of the primary endpoint. Another randomised, double-
blind, multiple-dose, comparator-controlled, two-way crossover study in 50 healthy volunteers showed 
that the pharmacokinetic profile of Nivestim was comparable to that of the reference product after 
subcutaneous administration. 
The efficacy and safety of Nivestim has been assessed in randomised, controlled phase III study in 
breast cancer.  There were no relevant differences between Nivestim and the reference product with 
regard to duration of severe neutropenia in cycle 1. This was supported by the secondary endpoints 
such as time to ANC recovery and the incidence of febrile neutropenia.  
2.6.4.  Safety 
A comparison in the safety profile between Nivestim and Neupogen was based on the studies in 
healthy volunteers. The overall safety profile of Nivestim was similar to the reference product 
Neupogen where the AEs, SAEs and common undesirable effects of Nivestim are consistent with those 
documented with Neupogen. A higher incidence of bone pain was met with Nivestim, the pain being 
mild or moderate in intensity, but manageable with NSAID or paracetamol. Due to the higher incidence 
of bone pain and myalgia in the Nivestim group, follow-up of these adverse events is recommended in 
the RMP. The incidence of febrile neutropenia in both treatments were similar.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/262762/2010   
Page 46/48
 
 
 
The occurrence of antibodies and NAbs in patients treated with Nivestim remains unclear. According to 
the data available, there were no immune-mediated adverse effects or loss of efficacy in patients 
having borderline positive responses in the anti-G-CSF antibody screening. Nevertheless, follow-up 
measures for determining the possible development of immunogenicity should be implemented as 
there is not enough data to demonstrate sensitivity and detection of anti-G-CSF antibodies. Additional 
long term safety and immunogenicity data will be collected in the post-marketing phase, as described 
in the RMP. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. There are no new important adverse reactions observed with 
Nivestim which are different than what has been described with Neupogen.  
Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the 
proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these.  
2.6.4.1.  User consultation 
The applicant performed standard readability testing. No major issues regarding the content were 
found. The test showed that the PL was well structured and organised, easy to understand, written in a 
comprehensible manner and readable to patients/users which were able to act upon the information. 
The layout of the package leaflet was considered acceptable. Thus, the PL meets the legal 
requirements for user testing under Art. 59(3) and 61(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended by 
directive 2004/27/EC. 
2.6.5.  Risk-benefit assessment 
This application for Nivestim, a recombinant human G-CSF (rhG-CSF), is based on the claim of 
biosimilarity to the approved reference product Neupogen. The phase I studies GCF061, GCF062 and 
phase III pivotal study GCF071 were conducted in accordance with the EMEA/CHMP guidelines on bio-
technology derived proteins and rh-G-CSF and CHMP scientific advice. The primary purpose of this 
assessment is not the characterisation of the benefit/risk of the product but the qualitative and 
quantitative evaluation of the similarity between Nivestim and Neupogen.  The quality, non-clinical and 
clinical data presented supported the conclusion of similarity between Nivestim and Neupogen. PD and 
PK parameters for IV or SC administration allowed to conclude on the bioequivalence of the test 
product with the reference product, where the majority of PK and PD endpoints fell within the 
predefined 90%CI for both 5 and 10μg/kg. The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints of the Phase 
III trial were met and results showed therapeutic equivalence between Nivestim and Neupogen. The 
safety profile of Nivestim was consistent with the reference product. However, the CHMP had concerns 
over the determination of antibody formation and the presence of NAbs in patients treated with 
Nivestim. This issue will be addressed as a follow up measure. The CHMP also asked the applicant to 
agree to certain post-authorisation commitments to obtain more safety data related to patients with 
severe chronic neutropenia, to assess long term effects of G-CSF in healthy donors and to follow up on 
events of special interest through targeted questionnaires.  
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion that:  
routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product. 
• 
•  no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product 
information.

2.6.6.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Nivestim in the following indications 
Filgrastim is indicated for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of 
febrile neutropenia in patients treated with established cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy 
(with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes) and for the 
reduction in the duration of neutropenia in patients undergoing myeloablative therapy followed 
by bone marrow transplantation considered to be at increased risk of prolonged severe 
neutropenia. 
The safety and efficacy of filgrastim are similar in adults and children receiving cytotoxic 
chemotherapy. 
Filgrastim is indicated for the mobilisation of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC). 
In patients, children or adults, with severe congenital, cyclic, or idiopathic neutropenia with an 
absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of ≤ 0.5 x 109 /l and a history of severe or recurrent 
infections, long term administration of filgrastim is indicated to increase neutrophil counts and 
to reduce the incidence and duration of infection-related events. 
Filgrastim is indicated for the treatment of persistent neutropenia (ANC ≤ 1.0 x 109 /l) in 
patients with advanced HIV infection, in order to reduce the risk of bacterial infections when 
other options to manage neutropenia are inappropriate. 
 was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.

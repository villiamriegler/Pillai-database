Patients should be monitored for: thromboembolic events, peripheral neuropathy, severe skin 
reactions, bradycardia, syncope, somnolence, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia (see sections 4.4 
and 4.8). Dose delay, reduction or discontinuation, dependent upon the NCI CTC (National Cancer 
Institute Common Toxicity Criteria) grade, may be necessary. 
If less than 12 hours has elapsed since missing a dose, the patient can take the dose. If more than 
12 hours has elapsed since missing a dose at the normal time, the patient should not take the dose, but 
take the next dose at the normal time on the following day. 
Thromboembolic events 
Thromboprophylaxis should be administered for at least the first 5 months of treatment especially in 
patients with additional thrombotic risk factors. Prophylactic antithrombotic medicinal products, such 
as low molecular weight heparins or warfarin, should be recommended. The decision to take 
antithrombotic prophylactic measures should be made after careful assessment of an individual 
patient’s underlying risk factors (see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8). 
If the patient experiences any thromboembolic events, treatment must be discontinued and standard 
anticoagulation therapy started. Once the patient has been stabilised on the anticoagulation treatment 
and any complications of the thromboembolic event have been managed, the thalidomide treatment 
may be restarted at the original dose dependent upon a benefit-risk assessment. The patient should 
continue anticoagulation therapy during the course of thalidomide treatment. 
Neutropenia 
White blood cell count and differential should be monitored on an ongoing basis, in accordance with 
oncology guidelines, especially in patients who may be more prone to neutropenia. Dose delay, 
reduction or discontinuation, dependent upon the NCI CTC grade, may be necessary. 
Thrombocytopenia 
Platelet counts should be monitored on an ongoing basis, in accordance with oncology guidelines. 
Dose delay, reduction or discontinuation, dependent upon the NCI CTC grade, may be necessary. 
Peripheral neuropathy 
Dose modifications due to peripheral neuropathy are described in Table 2. 
Table 2: Recommended dose modifications for thalidomide -related neuropathy in first line 
treatment of multiple myeloma 
Severity of neuropathy 
Grade 1 (paraesthesia, weakness and/or loss of 
reflexes) with no loss of function  
Grade 2 (interfering with function but not with 
activities of daily living) 
Grade 3 (interfering with activities of daily 
living) 
Grade 4 (neuropathy which is disabling) 
Modification of dose and regimen 
Continue to monitor the patient with clinical 
examination. Consider reducing dose if 
symptoms worsen. However, dose reduction is 
not necessarily followed by improvement of 
symptoms. 
Reduce dose or interrupt treatment and continue 
to monitor the patient with clinical and 
neurological examination. If no improvement or 
continued worsening of the neuropathy, 
discontinue treatment. If the neuropathy resolves 
to Grade 1 or better, the treatment may be 
restarted, if the benefit/risk is favourable. 
Discontinue treatment  
Discontinue treatment 
Allergic reactions and severe skin reactions 
Thalidomide interruption or discontinuation should be considered for Grade 2-3 skin rash. 
Thalidomide must be discontinued for angioedema, anaphylactic reaction, Grade 4 rash, exfoliative or 
bullous rash, or if Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) or drug reaction 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is suspected and should not be resumed following 
discontinuation for these reactions. 
Elderly population 
No specific dose adjustments are recommended for the elderly ≤ 75 years of age. For patients 
> 75 years of age, the thalidomide recommended starting dose is 100 mg per day. The initial dose of 
melphalan is reduced for elderly > 75 years of age considering baseline bone marrow reserve and renal 
function. The melphalan recommended starting dose is 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg daily according to bone 
marrow reserve along with a further 50 % dose reduction for moderate (creatinine clearance: ≥ 30 but 
< 50 mL/minute) or severe (CrCl: < 30 mL/minute) renal insufficiency. The maximum daily 
melphalan dose is 20 mg in patients > 75 years of age (see Table 1). 
Patients with renal or hepatic impairment 
Thalidomide BMS has not formally been studied in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. 
No specific dose recommendations for these patient populations are available. Patients with severe 
organ impairment should be carefully monitored for adverse reactions. 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of Thalidomide BMS in the paediatric population in the indication of multiple 
myeloma. 
Method of administration 
Thalidomide BMS should be taken as a single dose at bedtime, to reduce the impact of somnolence. 
Capsules should not be opened or crushed (see section 6.6). 
It is recommended to press only on one end of the capsule to remove it from the blister, thereby 
reducing the risk of capsule deformation or breakage. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to thalidomide or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
• 
•  Women who are pregnant (see section 4.6). 
•  Women of childbearing potential unless all the conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention 
Programme are met (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). 
•  Male patients unable to follow or comply with the required contraceptive measures (see 
section 4.4). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Teratogenic effects 
Thalidomide is a powerful human teratogen, inducing a high frequency of severe and life-
threatening birth defects. Thalidomide must never be used by women who are pregnant or by 
women who could become pregnant unless all the conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention 
Programme are met. The conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme must be fulfilled for 
all male and female patients. 
Criteria for women of non-childbearing potential 
A female patient or a female partner of a male patient is considered to have childbearing potential 
unless she meets at least one of the following criteria: 
• 
Age  50 years and naturally amenorrhoeic for  1 year (Amenorrhoea following cancer therapy 
or during breast-feeding does not rule out childbearing potential). 
Premature ovarian failure confirmed by a specialist gynaecologist. 
Previous bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, or hysterectomy. 
XY genotype, Turner’s syndrome, uterine agenesis. 
• 
• 
• 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Counselling 
For women of childbearing potential, thalidomide is contraindicated unless all of the following 
conditions are met: 
• 
• 
She understands the teratogenic risk to the unborn child 
She understands the need for effective contraception, without interruption, at least 4 weeks 
before starting treatment, throughout the entire duration of treatment, and at least 4 weeks after 
the end of treatment 
Even if a woman of childbearing potential has amenorrhea she must follow all the advice on 
effective contraception 
She should be capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures 
She is informed and understands the potential consequences of pregnancy and the need to 
rapidly consult her doctor if there is a risk of pregnancy 
She understands the need to commence the treatment as soon as thalidomide is dispensed 
following a negative pregnancy test 
She understands the need and accepts to undergo pregnancy testing every 4 weeks except in case 
of confirmed tubal sterilisation 
She acknowledges that she understands the hazards and necessary precautions associated with 
the use of thalidomide. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
As thalidomide is found in semen, as a precaution all male patients taking thalidomide must meet the 
following conditions: 
• 
He understands the teratogenic risk if engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant woman or a 
woman of childbearing potential.  
He understands the need for the use of a condom if engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant 
woman or a woman of childbearing potential not using effective contraception (even if the man 
has had a vasectomy), during treatment, during dose interruption and for at least 7 days 
following discontinuation of treatment.  
He understands that if his female partner becomes pregnant whilst he is taking thalidomide or 7 
days after he has stopped taking thalidomide, he should inform his treating physician 
immediately and that it is recommended to refer the female partner to a physician specialised or 
experienced in teratology for evaluation and advice. 
• 
• 
The prescriber must ensure that: 
• 
The patient complies with the conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme including 
confirmation that she has an adequate level of understanding 
The patient has acknowledged the aforementioned conditions. 
• 
Contraception 
Women of childbearing potential must use one effective method of contraception for at least 4 weeks 
before start of treatment, during treatment, and until at least 4 weeks after thalidomide treatment and 
even in case of dose interruption unless the patient commits to absolute and continuous abstinence 
confirmed on a monthly basis. If not established on effective contraception, the patient must be 
referred preferably to an appropriately trained healthcare professional for contraceptive advice in order 
that contraception can be initiated. 
Implant 
Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (IUS) 
The following can be considered to be examples of effective methods of contraception: 
• 
• 
•  Medroxyprogesterone acetate depot 
• 
• 
Tubal sterilisation 
Sexual intercourse with a vasectomised male partner only; vasectomy must be confirmed by two 
negative semen analyses 
Ovulation inhibitory progesterone-only pills (i.e. desogestrel) 
• 
Because of the increased risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with multiple myeloma (MM), 
combined oral contraceptive pills are not recommended (see section 4.5). If a patient is currently using 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
combined oral contraception, she should switch to one of the effective methods listed above. The risk 
of venous thromboembolism continues for 4-6 weeks after discontinuing combined oral contraception. 
Pregnancy testing 
Medically supervised pregnancy tests with a minimum sensitivity of 25 mIU/ml must be performed for 
women of childbearing potential as outlined below. This requirement includes women of childbearing 
potential who practice absolute and continuous abstinence. 
Prior to starting treatment 
A medically supervised pregnancy test should be performed during the consultation, when thalidomide 
is prescribed or in the 3 days prior to the visit to the prescriber once the patient had been using 
effective contraception for at least 4 weeks. The test should ensure the patient is not pregnant when 
she starts treatment with thalidomide. 
Follow-up and end of treatment 
A medically supervised pregnancy test should be repeated every 4 weeks, including 4 weeks after the 
end of treatment, except in the case of confirmed tubal sterilisation. These pregnancy tests should be 
performed on the day of the prescribing visit or in the 3 days prior to the visit to the prescriber. 
Men 
As thalidomide is found in semen, as a precaution all male patients must use condoms during 
treatment, during dose interruption and for at least 7 days following discontinuation of treatment if 
their partner is pregnant or is of childbearing potential not using effective contraception. 
Male patients should not donate semen or sperm during treatment (including during dose 
interruptions) and for at least 7 days following discontinuation of thalidomide. 
Additional precautions 
Patients should be instructed never to give this medicinal product to another person and to return any 
unused capsules to their pharmacist at the end of treatment. 
Patients should not donate blood during treatment (including during dose interruptions) and for at least 
7 days following discontinuation of thalidomide. 
Healthcare professionals and caregivers should wear disposable gloves when handling the blister or 
capsule. Women who are pregnant or suspect they may be pregnant should not handle the blister or 
capsule (see section 6.6). 
Educational materials, prescribing and dispensing restrictions 
In order to assist patients in avoiding foetal exposure to thalidomide, the Marketing Authorisation 
Holder will provide educational material to healthcare professionals to reinforce the warnings about 
the teratogenicity of thalidomide, to provide advice on contraception before treatment is started and to 
provide guidance on the need for pregnancy testing. The prescriber must inform the patient about the 
expected teratogenic risk and the strict pregnancy prevention measures as specified in the Pregnancy 
Prevention Programme and provide patients with appropriate patient educational brochure, patient 
card and/or equivalent tool as agreed with each National Competent Authority. In collaboration with 
each National Competent Authority, a controlled access programme has been implemented which 
includes the use of a patient card and/or equivalent tool for prescribing and/or dispensing controls, and 
the collection of information relating to the indication in order to monitor the off-label use within the 
national territory. Ideally, pregnancy testing, issuing a prescription and dispensing should occur on the 
same day. Dispensing of thalidomide to women of childbearing potential should occur within 7 days 
of the prescription and following a medically supervised negative pregnancy test result. Prescriptions 
for women of childbearing potential can be for a maximum duration of treatment of 4 weeks according 
to the approved indications dosing regimens (see section 4.2), and prescriptions for all other patients 
can be for a maximum duration of 12 weeks. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Amenorrhea 
The use of thalidomide could be associated with menstrual disorders including amenorrhea. 
Amenorrhea during thalidomide therapy should be assumed to result from pregnancy, until it is 
medically confirmed that the patient is not pregnant. A clear mechanism by which thalidomide can 
induce amenorrhea is not elucidated. The reported events occurred in young (premenopausal) women 
(median age 36 years) receiving thalidomide for non-multiple myeloma indications, had an onset 
within 6 months of initiating treatment and reversed upon discontinuation of thalidomide. In 
documented case reports with hormone evaluation, the event of amenorrhoea was associated with 
decreased estradiol levels and elevated FSH/LH levels. When provided, antiovary antibodies were 
negative and prolactin level was within the normal range. 
Cardiovascular disorders 
Myocardial infarction 
Myocardial infarction (MI) has been reported in patients receiving thalidomide, particularly in those 
with known risk factors. Patients with known risk factors for MI, including prior thrombosis, should 
be closely monitored and action should be taken to try to minimise all modifiable risk factors 
(e.g. smoking, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia). 
Venous and arterial thromboembolic events 
Patients treated with thalidomide have an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (such as deep 
vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) and arterial thromboembolism (such as myocardial 
infarction and cerebrovascular event) (see section 4.8). The risk appears to be greatest during the first 
5 months of therapy. Thromboprophylaxis and dosing/anticoagulation therapy recommendations are 
provided in section 4.2. 
Previous history of thromboembolic events or concomitant administration of erythropoietic agents or 
other agents such as hormone replacement therapy, may also increase thromboembolic risk in these 
patients. Therefore, these agents should be used with caution in multiple myeloma patients receiving 
thalidomide with prednisone and melphalan. Particularly, a haemoglobin concentration above 12g/dl 
should lead to discontinuation of erythropoietic agents. Action should be taken to try to minimize all 
modifiable risk factors (e.g. smoking, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia). 
Patients and physicians are advised to be observant for the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism. 
Patients should be instructed to seek medical care if they develop symptoms such as shortness of 
breath, chest pain, arm or leg swelling. 
Thyroid disorders 
Cases of hypothyroidism have been reported. Optimal control of co-morbid conditions influencing 
thyroid function is recommended before start of treatment. Baseline and ongoing monitoring of 
thyroid function is recommended. 
Peripheral neuropathy 
Peripheral neuropathy is a very common, potentially severe, adverse reaction to treatment with 
thalidomide that may result in irreversible damage (see section 4.8). In a phase 3 study, the median 
time to first neuropathy event was 42.3 weeks. 
If the patient experiences peripheral neuropathy, follow the dose and schedule modification instruction 
provided in section 4.2. 
Careful monitoring of patients for symptoms of neuropathy is recommended. Symptoms include 
paraesthesia, dysaesthesia, discomfort, abnormal co-ordination or weakness. 
It is recommended that clinical and neurological examinations are performed in patients prior to 
starting thalidomide therapy, and that routine monitoring is carried out regularly during treatment.  
Medicinal products known to be associated with neuropathy should be used with caution in patients 
receiving thalidomide (see section 4.5). 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Thalidomide may also potentially aggravate existing neuropathy and should therefore not be used in 
patients with clinical signs or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy unless the clinical benefits outweigh 
the risks. 
Syncope, bradycardia and atrioventricular block 
Patients should be monitored for syncope, bradycardia and atrioventricular block; dose reduction or 
discontinuation may be required. 
Pulmonary hypertension 
Cases of pulmonary hypertension, some fatal, have been reported in patients treated with thalidomide. 
Patients should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of underlying cardiopulmonary disease prior to 
initiating and during thalidomide therapy. 
Haematological disorders 
Neutropenia  
The incidence of neutropenia grade 3 or 4 reported as adverse reactions was higher in multiple 
myeloma patients receiving MPT (Melphalan, Prednisone, Thalidomide) than in those receiving MP 
(Melphalan, Prednisone): 42.7 % versus 29.5 % respectively (study IFM 99-06). Adverse reactions 
from post-marketing experience such as febrile neutropenia and pancytopenia were reported with 
thalidomide. Patients should be monitored and dose delay, reduction or discontinuation may be 
required (see section 4.2). 
Thrombocytopenia 
Thrombocytopenia, including grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions, has been reported in multiple myeloma 
patients receiving MPT. Patients should be monitored and dose delay, reduction or discontinuation 
may be required (see section 4.2). Patients and physicians are advised to be observant for signs and 
symptoms of bleeding including petechiae, epistaxis and gastrointestinal haemorrhage, especially in 
case of concomitant medicinal product prone to inducing bleeding (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). 
Hepatic disorders 
Hepatic disorders, mainly abnormal liver test results, were reported. No specific pattern was identified 
between hepatocellular and cholestatic abnormalities, with some cases having a mixed presentation. 
The majority of the reactions occurred within the first 2 months of therapy and resolved spontaneously 
without treatment after thalidomide discontinuation. Patients should be monitored for liver function, 
particularly in case of pre-existing liver disorder or concomitant use of medicinal product susceptible 
to induce liver dysfunction (see section 4.8). 
Allergic reactions and severe skin reactions 
Cases of allergic reactions including angioedema, anaphylactic reaction and severe cutaneous 
reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug 
reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported with the use of 
Thalidomide. Patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms of these reactions by their 
prescribers and should be told to seek medical attention immediately if they develop these symptoms. 
Thalidomide interruption or discontinuation should be considered for Grade 2-3 skin rash. 
Thalidomide must be discontinued for angioedema, anaphylactic reaction, Grade 4 rash, exfoliative or 
bullous rash, or if SJS, TEN or DRESS is suspected, and should not be resumed following 
discontinuation for these reactions. (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).  
Somnolence 
It is very common that thalidomide causes somnolence. Patients should be instructed to avoid 
situations where somnolence may be a problem and to seek medical advice before taking other 
medicinal products known to cause somnolence. Patients should be monitored and dose reduction may 
be required. 
Patients should be advised as to the possible impairment of mental and/or physical abilities required 
for the performance of hazardous tasks (see section 4.7). 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tumour lysis syndrome 
The patients at risk of tumour lysis syndrome are those with high tumour burden prior to treatment. 
These patients should be monitored closely and appropriate precautions taken. 
Infections 
Patients should be monitored for severe infections including sepsis and septic shock. 
Cases of viral reactivation have been reported in patients receiving thalidomide, including serious 
cases of herpes zoster or hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation. 
Some of the cases of herpes zoster reactivation resulted in disseminated herpes zoster, requiring a 
temporary hold of the treatment with thalidomide and adequate antiviral treatment. 
Some of the cases of HBV reactivation progressed to acute hepatic failure and resulted in 
discontinuation of thalidomide. Hepatitis B virus status should be established before initiating 
treatment with thalidomide. For patients who test positive for HBV infection, consultation with a 
physician with expertise in the treatment of hepatitis B is recommended. 
Previously infected patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of viral reactivation, 
including active HBV infection, throughout therapy. 
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) 
Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, including fatal cases, have been reported with 
thalidomide. PML was reported several months to several years after starting the treatment with 
thalidomide. Cases have generally been reported in patients taking concomitant dexamethasone or 
prior treatment with other immunosuppressive chemotherapy. Physicians should monitor patients at 
regular intervals and should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients with new or 
worsening neurological symptoms, cognitive or behavioural signs or symptoms. Patients should also 
be advised to inform their partner or caregivers about their treatment, since they may notice symptoms 
that the patient is not aware of. 
The evaluation for PML should be based on neurological examination, magnetic resonance imaging of 
the brain, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis for JC virus (JCV) DNA by polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR) or a brain biopsy with testing for JCV. A negative JCV PCR does not exclude PML. Additional 
follow-up and evaluation may be warranted if no alternative diagnosis can be established.  
If PML is suspected, further dosing must be suspended until PML has been excluded. If PML is 
confirmed, thalidomide must be permanently discontinued. 
Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) 
A statistically significant increase of AML and MDS was observed in one clinical study in patients 
with previously untreated MM receiving the combination of melphalan, prednisone, and thalidomide 
(MPT). The risk increased over time and was about 2 % after two years and about 4 % after three 
years. An increased incidence of second primary malignancies (SPM) has also been observed in 
patients with newly diagnosed MM receiving lenalidomide. Among invasive SPMs, cases of 
MDS/AML were observed in patients receiving lenalidomide in combination with melphalan or 
immediately following high dose melphalan and autologous stem cell transplantation. 
The benefit achieved with thalidomide and the risk of AML and MDS must be taken into account 
before initiating treatment with thalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone. 
Physicians should carefully evaluate patients before and during treatment using standard cancer 
screening and institute treatment as indicated. 
Patients with renal or hepatic impairment 
Studies conducted in healthy subjects and patients with multiple myeloma suggest that thalidomide is 
not influenced to any significant extent by renal or hepatic function (see section 5.2). However, this 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
has not formally been studied in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function; therefore patients 
with severe renal or hepatic impairment should be carefully monitored for any adverse events. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Thalidomide is a poor substrate for cytochrome P450 isoenzymes and therefore clinically important 
interactions with medicinal products that are inhibitors and/or inducers of this enzyme system are 
unlikely. Non-enzymatic hydrolysis of thalidomide, being the primary clearance mechanism, suggests 
that the potential for drug-drug interactions with thalidomide is low. 
Increase of sedative effects of other medicinal products 
Thalidomide has sedative properties, thus may enhance the sedation induced by anxiolytics, hypnotics, 
antipsychotics, H1 antihistamines, opiate derivatives, barbiturates and alcohol. Caution should be used 
when thalidomide is given in combination with medicinal products that cause drowsiness. 
Bradycardic effect 
Due to thalidomide’s potential to induce bradycardia, caution should be exercised with medicinal 
products having the same pharmacodynamic effect such as active substances known to induce torsade 
de pointes, beta blockers or anticholinesterase agents. 
Medicinal products known to cause peripheral neuropathy 
Medicinal products known to be associated with peripheral neuropathy (e.g. vincristine and 
bortezomib) should be used with caution in patients receiving thalidomide. 
Hormonal contraceptives 
Thalidomide does not interact with hormonal contraceptives. In 10 healthy women, the 
pharmacokinetic profiles of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol following administration of a single 
dose containing 1.0 mg of norethindrone acetate and 0.75 mg of ethinyl estradiol were studied. The 
results were similar with and without co-administration of thalidomide 200 mg/day to steady-state 
levels. However, combined hormonal contraceptives are not recommended due to the increased risk of 
venous thromboembolic disease. 
Warfarin 
Multiple dose administration of 200 mg thalidomide q.d. for 4 days had no effect on the international 
normalized ratio (INR) in healthy volunteers. However, due to the increased risk of thrombosis in 
cancer patients, and a potentially accelerated metabolism of warfarin with corticosteroids, close 
monitoring of INR values is advised during thalidomide-prednisone combination treatment as well as 
during the first weeks after ending these treatments. 
Digoxin 
Thalidomide does not interact with digoxin. In 18 healthy male volunteers, multiple dose 
administration of 200 mg thalidomide had no apparent effect on the single dose pharmacokinetics of 
digoxin. In addition, single dose administration of 0.5 mg digoxin had no apparent effect on 
thalidomide pharmacokinetics. It is not known whether the effect will be different in multiple 
myeloma patients. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females 
Women of childbearing potential must use one effective method of contraception for at least 4 weeks 
before start of treatment, during treatment including during dose interruptions, and until at least 
4 weeks after thalidomide treatment (see section 4.4). If pregnancy occurs in a woman treated with 
thalidomide, treatment must be stopped immediately and the patient should be referred to a physician 
specialised or experienced in teratology for evaluation and advice. 
As thalidomide is found in semen, as a precaution all male patients must use condoms during 
treatment, during dose interruption and for at least 7 days following discontinuation of treatment when 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
having sexual intercourse with a pregnant woman or with a woman of childbearing potential who is 
not using effective contraception. This applies even if the man has had a vasectomy. 
If pregnancy occurs in a partner of a male patient taking thalidomide, the female partner should be 
referred to a physician specialised or experienced in teratology for evaluation and advice. 
Pregnancy 
Thalidomide is contraindicated during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential unless all the 
conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme are met (see section 4.3) 
Thalidomide is a powerful human teratogen, inducing a high frequency (about 30 %) of severe and 
live-threatening birth defects such as: ectromelia (amelia, phocomelia, hemimelia) of the upper and/or 
lower extremities, microtia with abnormality of the external acoustic meatus (blind or absent), middle 
and internal ear lesions (less frequent), ocular lesions (anophthalmia, microphthalmia), congenital 
heart disease, renal abnormalities. Other less frequent abnormalities have also been described. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether thalidomide is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown 
excretion of thalidomide in breast milk. Therefore breast-feeding should be discontinued during 
treatment with thalidomide. 
Fertility 
A study in rabbits demonstrated no effect on fertility indices in males or females although testicular 
degeneration was observed in males. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Thalidomide BMS as per the recommended posology has minor or moderate influence on the ability to 
drive and use machines. 
Thalidomide may cause fatigue (very common), dizziness (very common), somnolence (very 
common) and blurred vision (common) (see section 4.8). Patients should be instructed not to drive 
cars, use machines or perform hazardous tasks while being treated with thalidomide if they feel tired, 
dizzy, sleepy or have blurred vison. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Most patients taking thalidomide can be expected to experience adverse reactions. 
The most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of thalidomide in combination 
with melphalan and prednisone are: neutropenia, leukopenia, constipation, somnolence, paraesthesia, 
peripheral neuropathy, anaemia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, dizziness, dysaesthesia, tremor and 
peripheral oedema. 
In addition to the adverse reactions outlined above, thalidomide in combination with dexamethasone in 
other clinical studies led to the very common adverse reaction of fatigue; common adverse reactions of 
transient ischaemic event, syncope, vertigo, hypotension, mood altered, anxiety, blurred vision, nausea 
and dyspepsia; and uncommon adverse reactions of cerebrovascular accident, diverticular perforation, 
peritonitis, orthostatic hypotension and bronchitis. 
The most clinically important adverse reactions associated with the use of thalidomide in combination 
with melphalan and prednisone or dexamethasone include: deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary 
embolism, peripheral neuropathy, severe skin reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic 
epidermal necrolysis and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, syncope, 
bradycardia, and dizziness (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.5).

Additional adverse reactions from post-marketing experience with thalidomide and not seen in the 
pivotal study include febrile neutropenia and pancytopenia. 
Teratogenicity 
The risk of intra-uterine death or severe birth defects, primarily phocomelia, is extremely high. 
Thalidomide must not be used at any time during pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). 
Venous and arterial thromboembolic events 
An increased risk of venous thromboembolism (such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary 
embolism) and arterial thromboembolism (such as myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular event) 
has been reported in patients treated with thalidomide (see section 4.4). 
Peripheral neuropathy 
Peripheral neuropathy is a very common, potentially severe, adverse reaction of treatment with 
thalidomide that may result in irreversible damage (see section 4.4). Peripheral neuropathy generally 
occurs following chronic use over a period of months. However, reports following relatively short-
term use also exist. Incidence of neuropathy events leading to discontinuation, dose reduction or 
interruption increases with cumulative dose and duration of therapy. Symptoms may occur some time 
after thalidomide treatment has been stopped and may resolve slowly or not at all.

Posterior  reversible  encephalopathy  syndrome  (PRES)/  Reversible  posterior  leukoencephalopathy 
syndrome (RPLS) 
Cases of PRES/RPLS have been reported. Signs and symptoms included visual disturbance, headache, 
seizures and altered mental status, with or without associated hypertension. A diagnosis of 
PRES/RPLS requires confirmation by brain imaging. The majority of the reported cases had 
recognized risk factors for PRES/RPLS, including hypertension, renal impairment and concomitant 
use of high dose corticosteroids and/or chemotherapy. 
Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) 
AML and MDS were reported in one clinical study in patients with previously untreated multiple 
myeloma receiving the combination of melphalan, prednisone, and thalidomide (see section 4.4). 
Allergic reactions and severe skin reactions 
Cases of allergic reactions including angioedema, anaphylactic reaction and severe cutaneous 
reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, TEN and DRESS have been reported with the use of 
thalidomide therapy. If angioedema, anaphylactic reaction, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, TEN or 
DRESS is suspected, use of thalidomide should not be resumed (see section 4.2 and 4.4). 
Elderly population 
The adverse reaction profile reported in patients > 75 years of age treated with thalidomide 100 mg 
once daily was similar to the adverse reaction profile observed in patients ≤ 75 years of age treated 
with thalidomide 200 mg once daily (see Table 3). However, patients with age > 75 years are 
potentially at risk for a higher frequency of serious adverse reactions. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Eighteen cases of overdose have been reported in the literature concerning doses up to 14.4 grams. In 
thirteen of these cases, patients took thalidomide alone; amounts ranged from 350 mg to 4000 mg. 
These patients either exhibited no symptoms or exhibited symptoms of drowsiness, irritability, 
“sickness,” and/or headache. In one 2-year-old child who took 700 mg, there was an abnormal plantar 
response in addition to drowsiness and irritability. No fatalities have been reported and all overdose 
patients recovered without sequelae. There is no specific antidote for a thalidomide overdose. In the 
event of an overdose, the patient’s vital signs should be monitored and appropriate supportive care 
given to maintain blood pressure and respiratory status.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: immunosuppressants, other immunosuppressants, ATC code: L04AX02. 
Thalidomide has a chiral centre and is used clinically as a racemate of (+)-(R)- and 
(-)-(S)-thalidomide. The spectrum of activity of thalidomide is not fully characterised. 
Mechanism of action 
Thalidomide shows immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and potential anti-neoplastic activities. 
Data from in vitro studies and clinical trials suggest that the immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory 
and anti-neoplastic effects of thalidomide may be related to suppression of excessive tumour necrosis 
factor-alpha (TNF-) production, down-modulation of selected cell surface adhesion molecules 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
involved in leukocyte migration and anti-angiogenic activity. Thalidomide is also a non-barbiturate 
centrally active hypnotic sedative. It has no antibacterial effects. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Results from IFM 99-06, a Phase 3, randomised, open label, parallel group, multicentre study have 
demonstrated a survival advantage when thalidomide is used in combination with melphalan and 
prednisone for 12 cycles of 6 weeks in the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients. In 
this study the age range of patients was 65-75 years, with 41 % (183/447) of patients 70 years old or 
older. The median dose of thalidomide was 217 mg and > 40 % of patients received 9 cycles. 
Melphalan and prednisone were dosed at 0.25 mg/kg/day and 2 mg/kg/day respectively on days 1 to 4 
of each 6 weeks cycle. 
Further to the per protocol analysis, an update was conducted for the IFM 99-06 study providing an 
additional 15 months follow-up data. The median overall survival (OS) was 51.6 ± 4.5 and 
33.2 ± 3.2 months in the MPT and MP groups, respectively (97.5 % CI 0.42 to 0.84). This 18 month 
difference was statistically significant with a hazard ratio of reduction of risk of death in the MPT arm 
of 0.59, 97.5 % confidence interval of 0.42-0.84 and p-value of < 0.001 (see Figure 1).

Paediatric Population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
thalidomide in all subsets of the paediatric population in multiple myeloma (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Absorption of thalidomide is slow after oral administration. The maximum plasma concentrations are 
reached 1-5 hours after administration. Co-administration of food delayed absorption but did not alter 
the overall extent of absorption. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
The plasma protein binding of the (+)-(R) and (-)-(S) enantiomers was found to be 55 % and 65 % 
respectively. Thalidomide is present in the semen of male patients at levels similar to plasma 
concentrations (see section 4.4). The distribution of thalidomide is not influenced by age, gender, renal 
function and blood chemistry variables, to any significant level. 
Biotransformation 
Thalidomide is metabolised almost exclusively by non-enzymatic hydrolysis. In plasma, unchanged 
thalidomide represents 80 % of the circulatory components. Unchanged thalidomide was a minor 
component (< 3 % of the dose) in urine. In addition to thalidomide, hydrolytic products 
N-(o-carboxybenzoyl) glutarimide and phthaloyl isoglutamine formed via non-enzymatic processes 
are also present in plasma and in majority in urine. Oxidative metabolism does not contribute 
significantly to the overall metabolism of thalidomide. There is minimal cytochrome P450 catalysed 
hepatic metabolism of thalidomide. There are in vitro data indicating that prednisone may give rise to 
enzyme induction which could reduce the systemic exposure of concomitantly used medicinal 
products. The in vivo relevance of these findings is unknown. 
Elimination 
The mean elimination half-life of thalidomide in plasma following single oral doses between 50 mg 
and 400 mg was 5.5 to 7.3 hours. Following a single oral dose of 400 mg of radio-labelled 
thalidomide, the total mean recovery was 93.6 % of the administered dose by day 8. The majority of 
the radioactive dose was excreted within 48 hour following dose administration. The major route of 
excretion was via the urine (> 90 %) while faecal excretion was minor. 
There is a linear relationship between body weight and estimated thalidomide clearance; in multiple 
myeloma patients with body weight from 47-133 kg, thalidomide clearance ranged from 
approximately 6-12 L/h, representing an increase in thalidomide clearance of 0.621 L/h per 10 kg body 
weight increase. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Total systemic exposure (AUC) is proportional to dose at single-dose conditions. No time dependency 
of the pharmacokinetics has been observed. 
Hepatic and renal impairment 
The extent of thalidomide metabolism by the liver cytochrome P450 system is minimal and intact 
thalidomide is not excreted by the kidney. Measures of renal function (CrCl) and liver function (blood 
chemistry) indicate minimal effect of kidney and liver function on the pharmacokinetics of 
thalidomide. As such the metabolism of thalidomide is not expected to be affected by hepatic or renal 
dysfunction. Data from patients with end-stage renal disease suggest no impact of kidney function on 
thalidomide pharmacokinetics.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In the male dog, after one year of dosing, reversible bile plugs in canaliculi were observed at 
exposures greater than 1.9-fold the human exposure. 
Decreased platelet counts were noted in the mouse and rat studies. The latter appears to be related to 
thalidomide and occurred at exposures greater than 2.4-fold the human exposure. This decrease did not 
result in clinical signs. 
In a one-year dog study, enlarged and/or blue discoloration of mammary glands and prolonged estrus 
were observed in females at exposures equal to 1.8 or greater than 3.6-fold the human exposure, 
respectively. The relevance to humans is unknown. 
The effect of thalidomide on thyroid function was assessed in both rats and dogs. No effects were 
observed in dogs; however in rats, there was an apparent dose-dependent decrease in total and free T4 
that was more consistent in the female. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No mutagenic or genotoxic effect has been revealed when thalidomide was assayed in a standard 
battery of genotoxicity tests. No evidence of carcinogenicity was observed at exposures approximately 
15, 13 and 39 times the estimated clinical AUC at the recommended starting dose in mice, male rats 
and female rats respectively. 
Animal studies have demonstrated differences in species susceptibility to the teratogenic effects of 
thalidomide. In humans, thalidomide is a proven teratogen. 
A study in rabbits demonstrated no effect on fertility indices in males or females although testicular 
degeneration was observed in males. 
A peri- and postnatal toxicity study performed in rabbits with thalidomide administered at doses up to 
500 mg/kg/day resulted in abortions, increased stillbirths and decreased pup viability during lactation. 
Pups from mothers treated with thalidomide had increased abortions, reduced body weight gain, 
alterations in learning and memory, decreased fertility, and reduced pregnancy index.

1.  What Thalidomide BMS is and what it is used for 
What Thalidomide BMS is 
Thalidomide BMS contains an active substance called thalidomide. This belongs to a group of 
medicines which affect how your immune system works. 
What Thalidomide BMS is used for 
Thalidomide BMS is used with two other medicines called ‘melphalan’ and ‘prednisone’ to treat 
adults with a type of cancer called multiple myeloma. It is used in people who have recently been 
diagnosed and who have not been prescribed another medicine for their multiple myeloma before who 
are aged 65 years and over, or aged less than 65 years who cannot be treated with high dose 
chemotherapy, which can be very difficult for the body to handle. 
What is multiple myeloma 
Multiple myeloma is a type of cancer which affects a certain type of white blood cell, called the 
plasma cell. These cells collect in the bone marrow and divide out of control. This can damage the 
bone and kidneys. Multiple myeloma generally cannot be cured. However, the signs and symptoms 
can be greatly reduced or disappear for a period of time. This is called a ‘remission’. 
How Thalidomide BMS works 
Thalidomide BMS works by helping the body’s immune system and directly attacking the cancer. It 
works in a number of different ways: 
• 
• 
• 
by stopping the cancer cells developing 
by stopping blood vessels growing in the cancer 
by stimulating part of the immune system to attack the cancer cells. 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you take Thalidomide BMS 
You will have been given specific instructions by your doctor, particularly on the effects of 
thalidomide on unborn babies (outlined in the Thalidomide BMS Pregnancy Prevention Programme). 
You will have been given an educational brochure for patient by your doctor. Read it carefully and 
follow the related instructions. 
If you do not fully understand these instructions, please ask your doctor to explain them again before 
you take thalidomide. See also further information in this section under “Warnings and precautions” 
and “Pregnancy and breast-feeding”. 
Do not take Thalidomide BMS 
• 
if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant or are planning to become pregnant, as 
Thalidomide BMS causes birth defects and foetal death. 
if you are able to become pregnant, unless you are able to follow or comply with the required 
contraceptive measures to prevent you from becoming pregnant (see section 2 “Warnings and 
precautions” and “Pregnancy and breast-feeding”). 
if you are able to become pregnant, your doctor will record with each prescription that the 
necessary measures have been taken and will provide you with this confirmation.

Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking this medicine in the following situations: 
For women taking Thalidomide BMS 
Before starting the treatment, you should ask your doctor if you are able to become pregnant, even if 
you think this is unlikely. Even if you do not have a menstrual bleeding following cancer therapy, you 
may become pregnant. 
If you are able to become pregnant: 
•  Your doctor will make sure that you have pregnancy tests 
o  before treatment 
o  every 4 weeks during treatment 
o  4 weeks after stopping treatment 
•  You must use one effective method of contraception: 
for at least 4 weeks before starting treatment  
o 
o  during treatment 
o  until at least 4 weeks after stopping treatment 
Your doctor will tell you what method of contraception to use. 
If you are able to become pregnant, your doctor will record with each prescription that the necessary 
measures, as outlined above, have been taken  
For men taking Thalidomide BMS 
Thalidomide passes into semen. Therefore, do not have unprotected intercourse, even if you had a 
vasectomy. 
• 
Pregnancy and any exposure during pregnancy must be avoided. Always use a condom: 
o  during treatment  
o 
for at least 7 days after stopping treatment 
•  You must not donate semen:  
o  during treatment  
o 
for at least 7 days after stopping treatment 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For all patients 
Talk to your doctor before taking Thalidomide BMS if 
• 
you do not understand the contraception advice given to you by your doctor or if you do not feel 
able to follow this advice. 
you have had a heart attack, have ever had a blood clot in the past, or if you smoke, have high 
blood pressure or high cholesterol levels. During the treatment with Thalidomide BMS you have 
an increased risk of developing blood clots in the veins and arteries (see also section 4 “Possible 
side effects”).   
you have experienced or have existing neuropathy i.e. nerve damage causing tingling, abnormal 
co-ordination or pain in your hands or feet (see also section 4 “Possible side effects”).    
you experienced or have existing slow heart rate (this may be a symptom of bradycardia). 
you have high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs (see also section 4 “Possible side 
effects”). 
you have a fall in the number of white blood cells (neutropenia) accompanied by fever and 
infection. 
you have a fall in the number of platelets. You will be more prone to bleeding and bruising. 
you have or have had injury to the liver (hepatic disorders) including abnormal liver test results.  
you experience or have experienced in the past severe skin reactions called Stevens-Johnson 
syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis or drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms 
(which is also known as DRESS or drug hypersensitivity syndrome). (For description of 
symptoms see section 4 “Possible side effects”).  
you have had an allergic reaction whilst taking Thalidomide BMS such as rash, itching, swelling, 
dizziness or trouble breathing. 
you have experienced sleepiness.  
you have experienced fever, chills and severe shaking, and possibly complicated by low blood 
pressure and confusion (these may be symptoms of severe infections).  
you have or have ever had previous viral infection, particularly varicella zoster, hepatitis B 
infection, or HIV. If you are in doubt, talk to your doctor. Treatment with Thalidomide BMS may 
cause a virus to become active again in patients who carry it, resulting in a recurrence of the 
infection. Your doctor should check whether you have ever had hepatitis B infection. 
you have kidney or liver problems (see also section 4 “Possible side effects”).

Your thyroid function may be checked before you take thalidomide and monitored during treatment. 
At any time during or after your treatment, tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you experience: 
blurred, loss of or double vision, difficulty speaking, weakness in an arm or a leg, a change in the way 
you walk or problems with your balance, persistent numbness, decreased sensation or loss of 
sensation, memory loss or confusion. These may all be symptoms of a serious and potentially fatal 
brain condition known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). If you had these 
symptoms prior to treatment with Thalidomide BMS, tell your doctor about any change in these 
symptoms. 
Your doctor may check if you have a high total amount of tumour throughout the body, including your 
bone marrow. This could lead to a condition where the tumours break down and cause unusual levels 
of chemicals in the body which can lead to kidneys failure (this condition is called Tumour Lysis 
Syndrome) (see also section 4 “Possible side effects”). 
Your doctor should evaluate if you develop additional types of haematological malignancies (called 
acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes) during your treatment with Thalidomide 
BMS (see also section 4 “Possible side effects”). 
You must not donate blood during Thalidomide BMS treatment and for at least 7 days after stopping 
treatment. 
If you are not sure if any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor before taking Thalidomide 
BMS.

4.  Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
The following side effects may happen with this medicine: 
Stop taking Thalidomide BMS and see a doctor straight away if you notice the following serious 
side effects – you may need urgent medical treatment: 
•  Extremely intense and serious skin reactions. The adverse reaction of the skin may appear as 
rashes with or without blisters. Skin irritation, sores or swelling in the mouth, throat, eyes, 
nose and around the genitals, oedema and fever and flulike symptoms may occur. These 
symptoms may be signs of the rare and serious skin reactions Stevens-Johnson syndrome, 
toxic epidermal necrolysis or DRESS syndrome.  
•  Allergic reactions such as a localised or generalised pruritic rash, angioedema and 
anaphylactic reaction (serious types of allergic reaction that may be manifested as hives, 
rashes, swelling of eyes, mouth or face, difficulty of breathing, or itching). 
Tell your doctor straight away if you notice any of the following serious side effects: 
•  Numbness, tingling, abnormal coordination or pain in your hands and feet. 
• 
This may be due to nerve damage (called ‘peripheral neuropathy’), which is a very common side 
effect. It may become very severe, painful and disabling. If you experience such symptoms, speak 
to your doctor straight away, who may reduce the dose or discontinue the treatment. This side 
effect usually happens after you have been taking this medicine for several months but can 
happen sooner than this. It can also happen sometime after treatment has stopped. It may not go 
away, or may go away slowly. 
Sudden pain in your chest or difficulty in breathing. 
This may be due to blood clots in the arteries leading to your lungs (called ‘pulmonary 
embolism’), which is a common side effect. These can happen during treatment, or after treatment 
has stopped. 
Pain or swelling in your legs, especially in your lower leg or calves. 
This may be due to blood clots in the veins of your leg (deep vein thrombosis), which is a 
common side effect. These can happen during treatment, or after treatment has stopped. 
•  Chest pain spreading to the arms, neck, jaw, back or stomach, feeling sweaty and 
• 
breathless, feeling sick or vomiting. 
These may be symptoms of a heart attack/myocardial infarction (which may be due to blood clots 
in the arteries of your heart). 
•  Having difficulty in seeing or speaking, which is temporary. 
These may be symptoms of a stroke (which may be due to a clot in an artery in your brain). 
Fever, chills, sore throat, cough, mouth ulcers or any other symptoms of infection. 
• 
•  Bleeding or bruising in the absence of injury. 
Other side effects include: 
It is important to note that a small number of patients with multiple myeloma may develop additional 
types of cancer, especially haematological malignancies, and it is possible that this risk may be 
increased with Thalidomide BMS treatment; therefore your doctor should carefully evaluate the 
benefit and risk when you are prescribed Thalidomide BMS.

Limited data show that the safety of the combination of 
Cotellic and vemurafenib in patients with a BRAF V600 
mutation-positive melanoma which has metastasised to the 
brain is consistent with the known safety profile of Cotellic 
in combination with vemurafenib. The efficacy of the

The safety of Cotellic in children and adolescents has not 
been fully established. The safety of Cotellic was assessed 
in a multi-centre, open-label, dose-escalation study in 55 
paediatric patients aged 2 to 17 years with solid tumours. 
The safety profile of Cotellic in these patients was 
consistent with that in the adult population. Currently 
available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of 
the SmPC, but no recommendation on posology can be 
made.

At the initial Marketing Authorisation Application, the 
Update of sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order 
to update the safety and efficacy results of studies 
GO28141 and NO25395. The RMP has been updated 
accordingly (version 2.1). In addition, the Marketing 
authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to 
make minor amendments in sections 5.1 and 5.3 of 
the SmPC.

data 
overall survival data from the pivotal phase III Study 
GO28141 (“coBRIM”) were immature. In the present 
variation, an update of overall survival and safety was 
provided for Study GO28141, and updated efficacy 
analyses were provided for the supportive phase 1b Study 
NO25395 (“BRIM7”). The SmPC has been updated with the 
updated efficacy results from both studies. The survival 
benefit of the addition of cobimetinib to vemurafenib in the 
treatment of unresectable or metastatic malignant 
melanoma has now been established to be approximately 5 
months in median.  
Small changes in the cumulative frequencies of adverse 
drug reactions were observed in the Study GO28141 safety 
update with 10 month’s increased median follow-up. No 
changes were made to the SmPC with regard to safety. The 
currently presented ADR frequencies correspond to the 
median duration of treatment.

Update of sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.2 of the SmPC to 
reflect the results GP29342 with recommendations 
for patients with hepatic impairment. Furthermore, 
the MAH submitted results of the in vitro CYP time-
dependent inhibition study (15-1983). In addition, 
the MAH took the opportunity to use the term CYP3A 
throughout the SmPC to cover both CYP3A4 and 
CYP3A5, in line with previous recommendations, and 
to bring the product in line with the latest QRD 
template. The Package Leaflet was updated 
accordingly. The Risk Management Plan was updated 
to reflect the completion of the studies.

Labelling and

PL 
compared to healthy subjects was evaluated with study 
GP29342. Systemic total cobimetinib exposures after a 
single dose were similar in subjects with mild or moderate 
hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects, while 
subjects with severe hepatic impairment had lower total 
cobimetinib exposures (AUC0-∞ geometric mean ratio of 
0.69 compared to healthy subjects) which is not considered 
to be clinically significant. Unbound cobimetinib exposures 
were similar between subjects with mild and moderate 
hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal 
hepatic function while subjects with severe hepatic 
impairment had approximately 2-fold higher exposures. 
No dose adjustment is therefore recommended in patients 
with hepatic impairment. Patients with severe hepatic 
impairment may have increased plasma concentrations of 
unbound cobimetinib compared to patients with normal 
hepatic function. Liver laboratory abnormalities can occur 
with Cotellic and caution should be used in patients with 
any degree of hepatic impairment.

Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Wakix 
pitolisant 
On 19 November 2015, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Wakix, 
intended for the treatment of narcolepsy with or without cataplexy. Wakix was designated as an orphan 
medicinal product on 10 July 2007. The applicant for this medicinal product is Bioprojet Pharma. 
Wakix will be available as 4.5 and 18 mg film-coated tablets. The active substance of Wakix is pitolisant, 
an antagonist/inverse agonist of the histamine H3 receptor (ATC code: N07XX11). It works by enhancing 
the histaminergic transmissions in the brain.  
The benefits with Wakix are its ability to decrease daytime somnolence and cataplexy rate. The most 
common side effects are headache, insomnia and nausea. 
The full indication is: “Wakix is indicated in adults for the treatment of narcolepsy with or without 
cataplexy". It is proposed that Wakix be prescribed by physicians experienced in the treatment of sleep 
disorders.  
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and 
made available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been 
granted by the European Commission.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a rare and incurable disease that is characterised by the 
accumulation of clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM) and accounts for 10% of all 
haematological malignancies. In Europe, there are approximately 27,800 new cases each year. 
The median age of patients at diagnosis is 65 years and the disease has a typical course 
characterised by a chronic phase lasting several years, and an aggressive terminal phase. Due 
to the availability of new agents in recent years including thalidomide, bortezomib and 
lenalidomide, and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), the 5-year survival rate has 
improved to 40% - 50%. 
The clinical features of MM are varied but the most common criteria used in diagnosis of 
symptomatic MM are the presence of neoplastic plasma cells comprising greater than 10% of 
BM cells or presence of a plasmacytoma; paraprotein (M protein) in the serum and/or urine; 
and evidence of related organ or tissue impairment  due to plasma cell disorder. Symptomatic 
MM, signalling the necessity for treatment, is typically manifested by hypercalcaemia, renal

Page 8/87 
 
  
insufficiency, anaemia, and bone lesions (CRAB). This deterioration leads to progressive 
morbidity and eventual mortality by infection and causes significant skeletal destruction, and 
less commonly, neurological complications and hyperviscosity. The prognosis depends on a 
variety of factors including age and stage of MM at time of diagnosis.  
Therapies for MM currently consist of the following 6 classes of agents: proteasome inhibitors 
(bortezomib), immunomodulatory medicinal products (thalidomide, lenalidomide), 
corticosteroids, alkylators, anthracyclines, nitrosoureas (to a lesser extent), plus high-dose 
chemotherapy and transplantation for those who are eligible. There is currently no generally 
accepted standard treatment. First line treatment options should contain at least one of the 
novel therapies followed by ASCT if indicated.  
However, the disease remains fatal, as patients inevitably progress and will relapse. Although 
patients with relapsed disease can achieve responses to subsequent anti-myeloma regimens, 
the duration of response typically decreases with successive relapses until resistant disease 
develops.  
The following are definitions of relapsed and refractory disease by the International Myeloma 
Working Group (IMWG): 
Relapsed Disease: Previously treated myeloma patients who, after a period of being off-
therapy, require salvage therapy but do not meet criteria for "primary refractory" or "relapsed-
and-refractory" categories, as outlined below.   
Refractory Disease: MM that is non-responsive while on therapy or progresses within 60 days of 
last therapy. Relapsed-and-refractory myeloma is defined as relapse of disease in patients who 
achieve minor response (MR) or better, and then either become non-responsive while on 
salvage therapy, or progress within 60 days of last therapy. Primary refractory myeloma refers 
to patients who have never achieved an MR with any therapy. 
The main considerations for choosing the optimal treatment for a patient with relapsed 
refractory MM (RRMM) include prior therapy, age, physical condition and presence of aggressive 
features like extramedullary disease, pancytopenia or rapid increase in tumour load/bone 
lesions, and cytogenetic profile. The goal is to control the disease for as long as possible, since 
no treatment is curative.  
Bortezomib and lenalidomide-based regimens are the most commonly used agents in the 
treatment of relapsed or refractory MM in combination with corticosteroids, and sometimes an 
alkylator or with an anthracycline. Corticosteroids (pulsed or weekly dexamethasone) are 
recommended for use in combinations with most products.  
Refractory disease can sometimes be treated with a particular agent to which resistance has 
developed if the agent is used in conjunction with other compounds that produce synergistic 
anti-MM effect or at a different posology. At second or subsequent relapses, usually after the 
patient has been treated with bortezomib and at least one immunomodulatory agent, there are 
limited options, and once patients have become refractory to both of them (double refractory), 
the outcome is very poor.

Pomalidomide belongs to the pharmacotherapeutic group of immunomodulating agents which 
also includes thalidomide and lenalidomide with apparent limited cross resistance within the 
class and with the potential to improve patient outcome in a relapsed/refractory setting. 
The exact mechanism of action of pomalidomide is unknown but results in tumouricidal, 
immunomodulatory, anti-angiogenic, and anti-inflammatory properties seen also with other 
drugs of the same class. When used in combination with dexamethasone a synergy in anti-
proliferative activity is shown. In addition, pomalidomide inhibits proliferation of lenalidomide 
resistant MM cells.  
Celgene Europe Ltd has applied for Pomalidomide Celgene in combination with dexamethasone 
to be indicated in the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma 
who have received at least two prior treatment regimens, including both lenalidomide and 
bortezomib, and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as hard gelatin capsules containing 1mg, 2 mg, 3 mg or 4mg 
of pomalidomide as active substance.  
Other ingredients are: mannitol, pregelatinised starch and sodium stearyl fumarate. The 
capsule shells are made of gelatin and contain different colorants depending on the strength, as 
described in section 6.1 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC). 
The product is available in polyvinyl chloride (PVC)/ polychlorotrifluoroethylene (PCTFE) blisters 
with push through aluminium foil.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The chemical name of pomalidomide is (RS)4-Amino-2-(2,6-dioxopiperidin-3-yl)isoindole-1,3-
dione and has the following structure: 
The structure of pomalidomide has been confirmed by elemental analysis, mass spectrometry 
(electrospray ionization), nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR and 13C-NMR) spectroscopy, 
UV spectrophotometry, and infrared spectrophotometry (FTIR-KBr). 
The active substance is a crystalline non-hygroscopic yellow powder, which is slightly soluble in 
acetone, acetonitrile, methylene chloride, methyl ethyl ketone and tetrahydrofuran; very 
Pomalidomide Celgene 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/427059/2013 
Page 10/87 
 
 
 
  
slightly soluble in absolute ethanol, ethyl acetate, heptane, methanol, 2-propanol and toluene; 
and practically insoluble in water.  
Pomalidomide has one stereochemical centre. The active substance is obtained as a racemic 
mixture, no optical rotation is observed. X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD), Differential Scanning 
Calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetry (TGA) studies conducted have identified one single 
polymorphic form of pomalidomide, designated as Form A.  
In relation to the new active substance claim, although pomalidomide is a structural analogue 
of lenalidomide and thalidomide, it cannot be derived from any of these compounds in a simple 
synthetic modification or in vivo. Therefore, pomalidomide is not considered to be a derivative 
of lenalidomide or thalidomide.  Pomalidomide is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture of 
isomers, complex or derivative of a chemical substance previously authorised as a medicinal 
product in the European Union and is considered to be a new active substance in itself. 
Manufacture 
The active substance is supplied by two manufacturers. Pomalidomide is synthesized in two main 
steps using commercially available well defined starting materials with acceptable specifications. 
The first step consists of a coupling reaction in which the starting materials react to form crude 
pomalidomide. The second step is a purification process consisting on filtration, crystallization 
and drying to obtain the final drug substance. 
As stated above, pomalidomide molecule has one stereochemical centre, which is introduced 
during the coupling step (step 1).  The synthetic process yields a racemic mixture of 
pomalidomide (1:1 R:S) and a single polymorphic form, form A, is obtained. 
The manufacturing process has been developed using a combination of conventional univariate 
studies and elements of QbD such as risk assessment and design of experiment (DOE) studies to 
gain process understanding and knowledge. No design space has been applied for. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU 
guideline on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities have been well 
discussed with regards to their origin and characterised.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control 
methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance (visual examination), 
identification (IR), assay (HPLC), related impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content 
(KF), sulphated ash (Ph.Eur.), heavy metals (ICP-MS), and particle size (Ph. Eur.). 
The absence of a test to control chirality has been adequately justified. The enantiomeric purity 
of the racemic starting material is controlled by its own specification, and there are no 
asymmetric reagents, solvents, chromatography, or resolution used in the synthesis of 
pomalidomide that would enrich the stereochemistry. In addition, the racemic content of 
pomalidomide was confirmed using chiral HPLC on the 24 month stability time point samples.

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and(non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. 
Batch analysis data on 3 commercial scale batches of the active substance manufactured at each 
of the proposed manufactured sites are provided. The results are within the specifications and 
consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on two commercial scale batches of active substance from one of the proposed 
manufacturers and three commercial scale batches from the other proposed manufacturer stored 
in the intended commercial package for 12 months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% 
RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided.  
Supportive stability data on two pilot scale batches stored for up to 60 months at long term 
conditions(25 ºC / 60% RH) and 6 months at accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) from an 
additional manufacturer (not proposed as commercial manufacturing site, but using the proposed 
commercial manufacturing process) have been submitted. 
Additional supportive stability data (24 months under long term-conditions and 6 months at 
accelerated conditions) on three commercial scale batches manufactured by one of the registered 
manufacturers have been presented. These batches were prepared using a similar manufacturing 
process as the one proposed for commercialization, with the exception of the recrystallization 
solvents used in the final step (ethanol/DMSO instead of water/DMSO).  
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch, showing that 
pomalidomide is photo-stable. 
Results on stress conditions under acid and base heated stress conditions, thermal, and oxidation 
stress conditions were also provided on one laboratory scale batch manufactured by the 
synthetic route proposed for commercial use with the exception of the final recrystallization 
solvents. 
The following parameters were tested: description, related substances and assay. The analytical 
methods used in the stability studies were the same as those used for release testing of 
commercial products.  
No significant changes where observed in any of the primary, or supportive pomalidomide 
stability study results during the evaluated periods. 
The stability results indicate that the drug substance manufactured by the proposed supplier(s) is 
sufficiently stable, and indicate that Form A is maintained during the re-test period. The stability 
results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to formulate hard capsules containing 1 mg, 
2 mg, 3 mg and 4mg pomalidomide per capsule, respectively. 
Several formulations were evaluated during development. The first formulation developed 
contained anhydrous lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, and magnesium 
stearate. In an effort to improve processing, anhydrous lactose was replaced with anhydrous 
dibasic calcium phosphate, and other excipients were changed accordingly.  The revised 
formulation contained pomalidomide, anhydrous dibasic calcium phosphate, pregelatinized 
starch, croscarmellose sodium, and sodium stearyl fumarate. All the batches met the 
specification.  However some instability was detected at accelerated and room temperature 
conditions. To overcome the instability of this formulation, additional formulations were studied. 
Based on the development study results, the proposed formulation was selected. The proposed 
capsule strengths use two common blends comprised of the same excipients, varying in the 
proportion of drug substance and two excipients, mannitol and sodium stearyl fumarate. 
Pomalidomide capsules, 1 mg and 2 mg, are dose proportional and utilize a common blend. 
Pomalidomide capsules, 3 mg and 4 mg, are dose proportional and utilize another common 
blend.  
A simple blending and encapsulation process has been selected. The effect of the active 
substance particle size distribution on dissolution and content uniformity is controlled by setting 
appropriate specification limits. 
The commercial formulation is identical to the clinical formulation; the only difference between 
them is the capsule shell dye components. The clinical reddish-brown capsule shells contain iron 
oxide and the commercial capsule shells contain various iron oxides and FD&C dyes. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients typically used in capsule formulations 
and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. There are no novel excipients used in the 
finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
Compatibility of the excipients with the drug substance on the proposed capsule formulations has 
been demonstrated. 
The primary packaging is polyvinyl chloride (PVC)/ polychlorotrifluoroethylene (PCTFE) blisters 
with push through aluminium foil. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The 
choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for 
the intended use of the product.  
Adventitious agents 
Gelatine obtained from bovine sources is used in the product. Valid TSE CEP from the suppliers of 
the gelatine used for the manufacture of the capsule shells is provided.  
No other excipients derived from animal or human origin are used.

Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process consists of four main steps. In brief, pomalidomide is blended with 
mannitol and a portion of pregelatinised starch (Blend 1), further blended with the remainder of 
the pregelatinised starch (Blend 2) and mixed with sodium stearyl fumarate (Blend 3) which is 
then filled into the hard gelatin capsule shells and packed into blisters. 
Adequate in-process controls have been set up and a detailed description along with a process 
flow scheme have been provided. 
Since the active substance content per unit dose product is below 2% of the composition in all 
cases, according to the Guideline on Process Validation (EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/70278/2012-
Rev1) the manufacturing process is considered a non-standard process, and therefore validation 
data for all proposed manufacturing sites have been submitted. These data demonstrate that the 
manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a 
reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this manufacturing process.  
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form, 
namely: appearance (visual examination), identification (UV-Vis, HPLC), assay (HPLC), related 
impurities (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (HPLC) and microbial limits 
(Ph. Eur).  
Batch analysis results are provided for three commercial scale batches of each strength 
manufactured at the two proposed manufacturing sites batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Analytical  methods  have  been  fully  validated  in  accordance  with  the  EU/ICH  Validation 
Guidelines, and have proven to be stability indicating. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of three batches of finished product  per strength manufactured by one of the 
proposed manufacturers stored under long term conditions for 18 months at 25 ºC /60% RH and 
for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC/75% RH according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided. The batches of pomalidomide capsules are identical to those proposed 
for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Registration stability batches represent the selected colour combinations for the commercial 
capsules shells, except for the 1 mg capsule which has a medium blue body instead of the yellow 
body proposed for the commercial formulation. The 3 mg and 4 mg proposed commercial 
capsules are the same colour as the registration stability batches however the dye composition 
used in the capsule shells were modified to reduce the likelihood of fading. 
In addition, supportive stability studies for pomalidomide clinical capsules in reddish-brown 
coloured (iron oxide) capsule shells have been carried out for up to 36 months storage for 1 mg 
and 2 mg and up to 18 months for 3 mg pomalidomide capsules stored under long-term (25 
ºC/60% RH) and 6 months under accelerated (40 ºC/75% RH) conditions. Samples were tested

for appearance, assay, related impurities, and dissolution. The analytical procedures used are 
stability indicating. 
For all batches of all strengths in the proposed container closure there were no significant 
changes or trends in any of the parameters monitored under long term or accelerated conditions. 
All data were well within the proposed specification and no significant changes were observed. 
In addition, one batch of each strength was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on 
Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. These studies showed that 
pomalidomide capsules are photostable when stored in the proposed container. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life stated in the SmPC with no storage conditions is 
acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished 
product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to 
the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical 
use. 
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substance. However, 
no design spaces were claimed for the manufacturing process of the active substance. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the 
conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform 
clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory 
way.

Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The goal of the nonclinical studies was to support the registration of pomalidomide for the 
treatment of multiple myeloma. 
All pivotal toxicology and safety pharmacology studies were conducted in accordance with the 
GLP regulations of the country where the study was performed.

2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Primary pharmacodynamics were evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. The molecular mechanism 
of action of pomalidomide was evaluated in vitro. Pomalidomide appeared to have a dual 
mechanism of action, being both directly tumouricidal for MM cells and also having 
immunomodulatory activity with direct effects on T and NK-mediated immunity.  
In vitro studies have identified a molecular mechanism for the pleiotropic effects of 
pomalidomide in MM and in T cells. Specifically, pomalidomide bound to the protein cereblon 
(CRBN), part of an E3 ligase complex, and the expression levels of CRBN in myeloma cells was 
linked to both the efficacy of pomalidomide and to the acquisition of resistance to lenalidomide. 
Pomalidomide was claimed to have direct antiproliferative activity against B cell lines derived 
from MM and Burkitt’s lymphoma patients. Pomalidomide in combination with dexamethasone 
increased this effect in a dose dependent manner.  
In lenalidomide-resistant MM cell lines, pomalidomide treatment inhibited cell proliferation. 
However, data from some in vitro studies indicated that although pomalidomide displayed 
inhibitory activities against several MM cell lines, pomalidomide did not display activity against 
samples obtained from MM patients. This finding suggested that the product might not show 
efficacy in patients that display the same type of MM cells. The Applicant provided data which 
demonstrated that pomalidomide has in vitro tumouricidal activity against MM cells.  
Cell proliferation and gene expression studies were performed in MM cell lines to identify 
molecular differences in the mechanisms of action between pomalidomide and lenalidomide.  A 
comparison of the effect on gene expression levels of key genes in several signalling pathways 
revealed that both compounds may commonly modulate expression levels of many genes 
however 4 genes may be modulated only by pomalidomide.  
Pomalidomide inhibited the proliferation of 6 human B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic 
leukaemia (BCP-ALL) cell lines. Pomalidomide inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in 
fresh BCP-ALL cells from paediatric subjects. Pomalidomide also had antiproliferative effects in 
6 breast cancer cell lines. 
Pomalidomide increased T cell stimulation by augmenting T cell proliferation, increasing IFN-γ, 
IL-2, and RANTES production and decreasing IL-10 production by CD4 T cell co-stimulated with 
the anti-CD-3 monoclonal antibody. 
The effect of pomalidomide on cytokine signalling triggered by the interaction of immune 
effector cells with either MM cells or BM stromal cells was also studied. Pomalidomide induced in 
vitro proliferation of CD4, CD8 T cells, NK and NKT cells from patients with MM. Additionally, 
pomalidomide induced expression of costimulatory molecules CD28, inducible costimulator 
(ICOS), and inducible costimulator ligand (ICOSL) in CD3+ gated effector cells within MM-
PBMCs.  Pomalidomide stimulated intracytoplasmic IFN-γ and IL-2 expression in CD4 T cells, 
CD8T cells, and NK T cells from peripheral blood of MM patients.  There was also significantly 
increased secretion of IFN-γ and IL-2 as well as decreased secretion of IL-6 in MM-BMMCs 
cultured with pomalidomide.  In addition, pomalidomide also reduced inhibitory T cell

Page 16/87 
 
  
populations. Pomalidomide significantly reduced suppressor of cytokine signalling 1 (SOCS1) 
expression in CD4 T, CD8 T, NK cells, and NK T cells from healthy donors and MM patients. 
Pomalidomide inhibited the production of many pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines 
from LPS-stimulated human PBMC, including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, MCP-1, and MIP-1αand 
increased production of the anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-10 and RANTES.  Pomalidomide 
also significantly reduced the expression of SOCS1 protein in all effector cells co-cultured either 
with MM cell lines alone or with MM cell lines and MM-BMSC.   
A study of the inhibition of angiogenesis in human umbilical artery explants revealed that 
pomalidomide caused a significant dose-dependent inhibition of microvessel formation. 
Pomalidomide inhibited the VEGF-induced endothelial cord formation in a dose dependent 
manner. Pomalidomide inhibited angiogenesis by blocking the migration and adhesion of 
endothelial cells. 
In vivo, anti-tumour efficacy was investigated in tumour models. Pomalidomide reduced tumour 
volumes and demonstrated anti-angiogenic activity. In beige-nude-xid mice injected with the Hs 
Sultan (Burkitt’s lymphoma) tumour cells the pomalidomide-treated animals showed significant 
inhibition of tumour growth after 18 days of treatment.  Also, mice receiving pomalidomide 
treatment showed an almost complete suppression of tumour growth until they were 
euthanized on Day 35 post-inoculation. In a SCID-hu model of human MM pomalidomide had no 
significant efficacy at any of the tested doses in the LAGλ-1 and the non-secretory LAGκ-1B 
tumour-bearing mice.  However, pomalidomide reduced tumour volume growth and IgG levels 
in mice bearing the LAGκ-1A tumours but these results were not significant. 
The effect of pomalidomide on therapy resistant acute lymphoblastic leukaemia was examined 
in NOD/SCID mice injected s.c with leukaemic blast cells from patients. Pomalidomide 
significantly inhibited tumour growth and in tumours from treated animals MVD was lower. In 
another NOD/SCID model in which mice were inoculated i.v. with tumour cells from relapsed 
BCR/ABL positive BCP-ALL subjects dissemination of leukaemic cells into spleen was 
significantly reduced by pomalidomide treatment. 
In a human Burkitt’s lymphoma tumour model in SCID mice, the concurrent administration of 
pomalidomide with rituximab was more effective in controlling tumour growth and prolonging 
survival than rituximab alone. Lymphoma-bearing SCID mice treated with pomalidomide 
showed greater recruitment of NK cells into the tumour bed, in particular more centralised 
infiltration into tumours than the peripheral pattern in DMSO treated controls. Pomalidomide 
showed an anti-angiogenic effect evidenced by a reduction in MVD of the tumours. In the MMPA 
pomalidomide inhibited microvessel formation. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Non-neoplastic hematologic disorders (e.g., SCD), autoimmune inflammatory disorders such as 
SSc and effects on endothelial progenitor cell differentiation were considered to be secondary 
pharmacodynamics. 
Pomalidomide had anti-fibrotic properties.  In an in vivo mouse model of systemic sclerosis 
(SSc) utilizing bleomycin as an inducer of skin fibrosis, pomalidomide reduced dermal thickness 
and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) staining of myofibroblasts, which is a direct measure of 
Pomalidomide Celgene

Page 17/87 
 
  
dermal fibrosis.  Most notably, pomalidomide was efficacious in this SSc mouse model with 
either prophylactic or therapeutic dosing.   
Pomalidomide also affected the regulation of fetal haemoglobin (HbF) making it a potential 
therapeutic agent for the treatment of non-malignant hematologic disorders such as sickle cell 
disease (SCD) and β-thalassemia.  In vitro pomalidomide was a more potent inducer of HbF 
than HU, the only treatment currently approved for SCD.  Pomalidomide increased the 
expression of genes directing the production of HbF as well as γ- and ε-globin gene 
transcription and expression during erythroid differentiation.  In an in vivo knockout transgenic 
mouse model of SCD, pomalidomide (10 mg/kg; 5 QD/week x 8) stimulated erythropoiesis as 
indicated by bone marrow hyperplasia and increased extramedullary hematopoiesis, a trend 
toward higher reticulocytes and significantly higher red blood cell (RBC) levels.  Pomalidomide 
significantly increased HbF expression with a trend toward higher gamma-globin chain A (Aγ) 
levels.  The pomalidomide responder rate, defined as the percentage of animals that exceeded 
the maximum HbF and Aγ levels in the vehicle group, reached 67% and 78% respectively.  
Among responders, pomalidomide induced a nearly 2-fold increase in HbF and the increase in 
Aγ levels was significant and was similar to the approved HbF-inducing agent HU. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
In oral dose CNS and respiratory function studies in the rat, there were no treatment related 
effects up to the highest dose tested. In vitro, pomalidomide had no significant effect on hERG 
current at up to 87.5 µm. In anaesthetised dogs, pomalidomide had no effects on QTc following 
i.v. administration of up to 25mg/kg although there was an effect on respiration and b.p. in 1/4 
dogs. In a conscious telemetered monkey study oral doses of pomalidomide of up to 10mg/kg 
had no adverse effects on CVS, electrocardiogram (ECG) and haemodynamic parameters, or 
respiration. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Pomalidomide was examined alone and in combination with dexamethasone and bortezomib for 
the inhibition of MM.1S tumour growth in a xenograft mouse model of multiple myeloma.  As a 
single agents, pomalidomide and dexamethasone inhibited tumour growth approximately 43% 
and 38% (Day 8) - 87% and 65% (Day 25), respectively compared with the control.  The 
combination of pomalidomide with bortezomib, dexamethasone, or dexamethasone and 
bortezomib further increased the tumour suppression to approximately 93%, 93%, and 96%, 
respectively on Day 25. 
Another in vivo study was also conducted where concurrent administration of pomalidomide and 
rituximab was more effective in prolonging survival than rituximab therapy alone. 
In vivo, synergistic effects were observed with hydroxyrurea in increasing Foetal Haemoglobin 
expression during erythroid differentiation and with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors in 
the expansion of CD34+ and CD133+ cells.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
In vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to characterize the absorption, distribution, 
metabolism, and excretion of pomalidomide (racemate).  Analytical methods for the 
determination of concentrations of pomalidomide and its enantiomers in pharmacokinetic and 
toxicokinetic studies were developed  
In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that pomalidomide enantiomers readily undergo 
racemisation.  Following repeated doses of pomalidomide, the exposure (AUC) ratio of S-
enantiomer/R-enantiomer ranged from 0.43 to 0.57 in rats and 0.73 to 1.07 in monkeys. In 
human and monkey plasma, the S-enantiomer had a higher per cent protein bound than the R-
enantiomer suggesting a possible stereoselectivity of the product in plasma protein binding 
maybe as a consequence of chiral discriminative properties of the binding sites of the protein 
fractions. Additional data suggested that the distribution of pomalidomide into tissues is not 
extensive and that differences in enantiomer distribution would be minor. 
In rats and monkeys, systemic clearance of pomalidomide was low (<1/6th liver blood flow), the 
volume of distribution was 2- to 4-fold body water volume, suggesting good tissue distribution 
of the compound), and the terminal half-lives of pomalidomide in animals ranged from mean 
values of 4 to 7 hours following an IV dose. In rats and monkeys, the oral bioavailability of 
pomalidomide (racemate) was low (mean values of 13% to 15%) following a 100 mg/kg dose.  
However, the bioavailability in monkeys was high (approximately 100%) at a dose of 2 mg/kg, 
indicating the extent of absorption is solubility limited. In rats, there was slight gender 
difference in systemic exposure (up to 2.5-fold higher in females), but this was not observed in 
monkeys.  Following repeated dosing in rats, systemic exposure (AUC) increased in a less than 
dose-proportional manner and the extent of pomalidomide accumulation was minimal in males 
and moderate (<2.0-fold) in females. Following repeated dosing to monkeys, systemic 
exposure (AUC) increased in approximately a dose-proportional manner and accumulation of 
pomalidomide generally did not occur at doses less 1 mg/kg, but was observed at higher doses 
(up to 3-fold accumulation).  
Following oral administration of 14C-pomalidomide to pigmented rats, drug related radioactivity 
was widely distributed into tissues, with most tissue concentrations peaking at 3 hours and 
decreasing to below quantifiable levels by 12 hours post-dose. The highest measured tissue 
concentrations occurred in the kidney, the gastrointestinal tract, urinary bladder, and bile, with 
lesser levels observed in most other tissues including liver, endocrine glands, secretory glands, 
and pigmented skin. Additional studies investigating the penetration of pomalidomide into the 
CNS of rats and mice indicated moderate distribution into the brain, with brain to plasma/blood 
ratios ranging from 0.39 to 0.49. 
Pomalidomide plasma protein binding ranged from approximately 12% to 59% at 
concentrations between 30 and 1000 ng/mL in animals and humans. There was no apparent 
concentration dependency of plasma protein binding over this concentration range in human 
plasma.  Following repeated oral administration of pomalidomide to pregnant rabbits, foetal 
plasma pomalidomide concentrations were approximately 50% of the maternal Cmax, indicating 
that pomalidomide crosses the placenta. Following oral administration of pomalidomide to 
lactating rats, transfer into milk was observed, with milk to plasma ratios of 0.63 to 1.46.

In hepatocytes from rabbit and human, and in vivo in rat, monkey and human, pomalidomide 
was metabolized primarily via hydroxylation of the phthalimide ring (M14, M16 and M17) 
followed by glucuronidation (M12 and M13), hydrolysis of the glutarimide ring (M10 and M11), 
and hydrolysis of the phthalimide ring (M2).  There were no unique or disproportionate 
metabolites observed in humans, compared to rats and monkeys. 
Following oral or IV administration of 14Cpomalidomide to rats or monkeys, excretion of 
radioactivity was rapid and nearly complete (>90%).  In rats, the predominant route of 
elimination was in the faeces following oral administration, mostly from unabsorbed parent, but 
in urine following IV administration.  In monkeys, the primary route of elimination was via the 
urine, which contained >70% of the radioactive dose following either oral or IV administration.  
These data indicate that urine is the primary route of elimination for systemic pomalidomide-
related material in both species.  Urinary radioactivity consisted primarily of metabolites and 
hydrolysis products, indicating urinary excretion of unchanged compound was a minor clearance 
pathway. 
Pomalidomide was not a CYP inhibitor or inducer in vitro. While pomalidomide is a substrate for 
P-glycoprotein (P-gp), its intestinal absorption did not appear to be limited by P-gp transport. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Single-dose oral and intravenous studies in mice and rats indicated that the acute oral 
minimum lethal dose was >2000 mg/kg, and acute IV minimum lethal dose was >80 mg/kg for 
mice, and >50 mg/kg for rats. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeated dose toxicity studies were conducted in the rat and monkey using the oral gavage 
route of administration except for the 13 week and 9 month monkey studies in which the 
nasogastric route was used. Toxicokinetics were conducted in all studies.   
In the rat, pomalidomide was well-tolerated up to the top dose tested in all the studies. No 
adverse effects were observed up to 5000 mg/kg/day in the 7-day study, 2000 mg/kg/day in 
the 28-day study, 1500 mg/kg/day in the 90-day study and 1000 mg/kg/day in the 6-month 
study.  In the 7 day study, toxicokinetics revealed no increase in parameters (Tmax, Cmax, 
AUC24h) with increasing dose 2000 to 5000mg/kg. In the 6-month study, the dosage of 1000 
mg/kg/day resulted in AUC24h of 42530 and 98010 ng•h/mL in males and females, respectively 
on Day 180. 
In the monkey, pomalidomide was evaluated in repeat-dose studies with durations of 14 days 
at doses from 50 to 1200 mg/kg/day, 28 days at doses from 30 to 300 mg/kg/day and from 
0.2 and 2 mg/kg/day, 90 days at doses from 0.05 to 10 mg/kg/day and 9 months at doses 
from 0.05 to 1 mg/kg/day. In these studies, the monkey appeared to be more sensitive to 
pomalidomide effects compared to the rat, and morbidity and mortality occurred at doses of 1 
and 10 mg/kg/day in the 9-month and 3-month studies, respectively.  The main toxic effects 
Pomalidomide Celgene 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/427059/2013 
Page 20/87 
 
  
were associated with the hematopoietic/lymphoreticular systems.  The major findings were 
decreased RBC parameters (red blood cell count, haemoglobin, and haematocrit), decreased 
white blood cell (WBC) counts (neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes), and histologic 
lymphoid depletion (lymph nodes, spleen, thymus, and GALT).  In addition, increased incidence 
of loose and watery stool leading to weight loss were often observed and contributed to poor 
clinical conditions.   
In the 28 day study, administration of pomalidomide to monkeys at 30, 100, and 300 
mg/kg/day was associated with mortality and poor clinical condition that led to study 
termination by Day 19.  The principle target organs were the hematopoietic and lymphoid 
systems that may have caused secondary effects in other tissues.  The NOAEL for 
pomalidomide was <30 mg/kg (AUC16h <48771 and 51858 ng•h/mL for male and female 
monkeys, respectively).   
In the 13 week study, all animals were to be dosed once daily for 13 weeks.  However, dosing 
at 10 mg/kg/day was discontinued after 5 weeks due to adverse clinical signs and 
haematological findings.  In that group, 3 animals/sex were euthanized in Week 6, and 2 
animals/sex were retained on dosing-free recovery until Week 13.   
In the 9-month toxicity study in monkeys, pomalidomide was administered orally at 0.05, 0.1, 
and 1 mg/kg/day.  There were 6 animals/sex/group. Treatment -related morbidity and early 
euthanasia (3 animals/sex) occurred at 1 mg/kg/day and were attributed to 
immunomodulation/immunosuppression effects associated with the pharmacology of 
pomalidomide (decreased peripheral blood lymphocytes, histologic lymphoid depletion, and 
hypocellularity of bone marrow).  These immunosuppressive effects were associated with 
staphylococcal infection and chronic inflammation of the large intestine.  Villous atrophy of the 
small intestine and minimal or mild bile duct proliferation were also present.  In addition, one 
female monkey at 1 mg/kg/day was euthanized on day 253 and exhibited changes consistent 
with acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML; extreme leukocytosis, multiple organ infiltrates, and 
bone marrow blast infiltration).  
Pomalidomide has also shown to be capable of inducing death in primary human AML blasts. 
The 1 mg/kg/day dose resulted in a mean AUC24h of 6540 ng•h/mL in female monkeys on Day 
272 (16-fold higher exposure relative to a 4 mg clinical dose).  In the surviving animals, there 
were no treatment-related changes in body weight, electrocardiography, blood pressure 
measurements, ophthalmology, and urinalysis.  Evaluation of recovery animals indicated that all 
treatment-related findings were reversible after 8 weeks of dosing cessation, except for 
proliferation of intrahepatic bile ducts observed in 1 animal at 1.0 mg/kg/day.  The NOAEL was 
0.1 mg/kg/day, corresponding to Day 272 pomalidomide AUC24h of 227 and 211 ng•h/mL for 
males and females, respectively (approximately 0.5-fold exposure ratio relative to a 4 mg 
clinical dose).   
Cardiovascular assessment (vital signs, ECG, respiration, and heart rate) conducted in the 1-, 
3-, and 9-month monkey studies indicated no treatment -related cardiovascular changes at 
doses up to 2 mg/kg/day for up to 3 months, and up to 1 mg/kg/day after 9 months (Cmax = 
1249 and 653 ng/mL; both sexes combined, at 2 and 1 mg/kg/day respectively).

Genotoxicity 
Pomalidomide was not mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian mutation assays, and did not 
induce chromosomal aberrations in human peripheral blood lymphocytes or micronuclei 
formation in polychromatic erythrocytes in bone marrow of rats administered doses up to 
2000 mg/kg/day. 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
In a fertility and early embryonic development study in rats pomalidomide was administered to 
males and females at dosages of 25, 250, and 1000 mg/kg/day.  Uterine examination on GD13 
revealed a decrease in mean number of viable embryos and an increase in post-implantation 
loss at all dosage levels.  Therefore, the NOAEL for these observed effects was <25 mg/kg/day 
(AUC24h was 39960 ng•h/mL at this lowest dose tested, and the exposure ratio was 99-fold 
relative to a 4 mg clinical dose).  When treated males on this study were mated with untreated 
females, all uterine parameters were comparable to the controls.  Based on these results, the 
observed effects were attributed to the treatment of females. 
Pomalidomide was teratogenic in both rats and rabbits when administered during the period of 
major organogenesis.  In the rat embryofoetal developmental toxicity study, malformations or 
absence of urinary bladder, absence of thyroid gland, and fusion and misalignment of lumbar 
and thoracic vertebral elements (centra and/or neural arches) occurred at all dosage levels (25, 
250, and 1000 mg/kg/day).  There was no maternal toxicity observed in this study.  Therefore, 
the maternal NOAEL was 1000 mg/kg/day, and the NOAEL for developmental toxicity was <25 
mg/kg/day for rats (AUC24h was 34340 ng•h/mL on GD17 at this lowest dose tested, and the 
exposure ratio was 85-fold relative to a 4 mg clinical dose).  
In rabbits, pomalidomide at dosages ranging from 10 to 250 mg/kg produced embryo-foetal 
developmental malformations stated to be similar to those observed with thalidomide. 
Increased cardiac anomalies were seen at all doses with significant increases at 
250 mg/kg/day.  At 100 and 250 mg/kg/day, there were slight increases in post-implantation 
loss and slight decreases in foetal body weights.  At 250 mg/kg/day, foetal malformations 
included limb anomalies (flexed and/or rotated fore and/or hind limbs, unattached or absent 
digit) and associated skeletal malformations (not ossified metacarpal, misaligned phalanx and 
metacarpal, absent digit, not ossified phalanx, and short not ossified or bent tibia), moderate 
dilation of the lateral ventricle in the brain, abnormal placement of the right subclavian artery, 
absent intermediate lobe in the lungs, low-set kidney, altered liver morphology, incompletely or 
not ossified pelvis, an increased average for supernumerary thoracic ribs and a reduced 
average for ossified tarsals.  Slight reduction in maternal body weight gain, significant reduction 
in triglycerides, and significant decrease in absolute and relative spleen weights were observed 
at 100 and 250 mg/kg/day.  The maternal NOAEL was 10 mg/kg/day, and the developmental 
NOAEL was <10 mg/kg/day for rabbits (AUC24h was 418 ng•h/mL on GD19 at this lowest dose 
tested, which was similar to that obtained from a 4 mg clinical dose.

No pre- and postnatal development study has been conducted. 
Toxicokinetic data 
The toxicokinetics of pomalidomide were evaluated as part of repeat-dose toxicity studies in 
rats and monkeys. 
Local Tolerance  
No local tolerance study has been conducted. 
Other toxicity studies 
Pomalidomide was assessed for immunotoxicity in monkeys after treatment at 2 mg/kg/day for 
28 days. Treatment-related effects included increased large unstained cells, decreases in 
peripheral lymphocytes populations (correlating to bone marrow hypocellularity), alterations to 
the primary and secondary humoral immune system, thymic organ weight decreases 
(macroscopic finding of small thymus), and histological findings consistent with general 
lymphoid depletion in the thymus, spleen, and the mandibular and mesenteric lymph nodes.  
There were no effects on granulocyte, monocyte, or NK cell function.  All findings at 2 
mg/kg/day demonstrated full recovery after a 30-day treatment-free period, with the exception 
of the decreased CD20+ B-lymphocytes (partial recovery observed) and reduced thymus 
weights; minimal/mild histological changes in the lymph nodes also indicated that there were 
partial recoveries of these effects.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The primary pharmacodynamics were evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. The molecular 
mechanism of action of pomalidomide was evaluated in vitro. Pomalidomide appeared to have a 
dual mechanism of action, having immunomodulatory activity with direct effects on T and NK-
mediated immunity. The data indicates that pomalidomide was directly tumouricidal for MM 
cells.  
Data from some in vitro studies indicated that even though pomalidomide displays inhibitory 
activities against several MM cell lines, pomalidomide did not display activity against samples 
obtained from MM patients. This finding suggested that the product might not show efficacy in a 
number of patients that may display the same type of MM cells. Studies in primary MM CD138+ 
cells are limited but similar activity in primary cells and cell lines has been reported. Studying 
the genetic profile of such cells could provide a better understanding of pomalidomide’s 
pharmacology. The Applicant will evaluate markers of response or resistance in MM patients at 
baseline whilst undergoing treatment with pomalidomide in two clinical studies. The CHMP 
recommended that this biomarker analysis report based on clinical studies CC-4047-MM-008 
and CC-4047-MM-010 is submitted when available (2Q 2016). 
In vivo pomalidomide was shown to have anti-tumour, immunomodulatory and anti-angiogenic 
properties. It also had anti-fibrotic properties. Additionally, pomalidomide affected the 
regulation of foetal haemoglobin expression by erythroid precursors derived from the blood of 
healthy adults and adults with SCD. In vitro the combination of pomalidomide + 
dexamethasone (Dex) was synergistic in both H929 lenalidomide-sensitive and -resistant cells, 
inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis.  The mechanism of pomalidomide plus Dex 
synergy in these H929 lenalidomide-resistant cell lines is not known at present.  
The pharmacokinetics of pomalidomide (racemate) were characterised in in vitro and in vivo 
studies. Analytical methods were developed for the determination of concentrations of 
pomalidomide and its enantiomers in pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic studies. Pomalidomide 
enantiomers readily undergo racemisation.  In human and monkey plasma, the S-enantiomer 
had a higher per cent protein bound than the R-enantiomer suggesting a possible 
stereoselectivity of the product in plasma protein binding maybe as a consequence of chiral 
discriminative properties of the binding sites. The data indicates that the distribution of 
pomalidomide into tissues is not extensive and that differences in enantiomer distribution would 
be relatively minor.  
Following repeated dosing in rats, systemic exposure (AUC) increased in a less than dose-
proportional manner and the extent of pomalidomide accumulation was minimal in males and 
moderate (<2.0-fold) in females. Following repeated dosing to monkeys, systemic exposure 
(AUC) increased in approximately a dose-proportional manner and accumulation of pomalidomide 
generally did not occur at doses less 1 mg/kg, but was observed at higher doses (up to 3-fold 
accumulation).  Accumulation occurred in the monkey at a dose ≥1mg/kg/day but this dose 
resulted in an exposure (AUC) approximately 5 times higher than the clinical exposure, 
suggesting this accumulation may not be clinically relevant.  Also the proposed clinical dose of 
4mg/day which equates to 0.067mg/kg is considerably lower than the dose in monkeys at which 
accumulation occurred. Data submitted showed that accumulation appeared to be minimal in 
Pomalidomide Celgene 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/427059/2013 
Page 24/87 
 
  
both healthy and MM subjects, suggesting that significant accumulation of pomalidomide does 
not occur at clinically relevant doses.  
In the rat, pomalidomide was well-tolerated up to the top dose tested in all the studies. No 
adverse effects were observed up to 5000 mg/kg/day in the 7-day study, 2000 mg/kg/day in 
the 28-day study, 1500 mg/kg/day in the 90-day study and 1000 mg/kg/day in the 6-month 
study.  In the monkey the main toxic effects were associated with the 
hematopoietic/lymphoreticular systems.  The major findings were decreased RBC parameters 
(red blood cell count, haemoglobin, and haematocrit), decreased white blood cell (WBC) counts 
(neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes), and histologic lymphoid depletion (lymph nodes, 
spleen, thymus, and GALT).   
In the nine month repeated dose toxicity study in monkeys, AML was reported in one female. 
Based upon the known association in humans of AML with immunosuppression and the low 
incidence of this neoplastic change in cynomolgus macaques, this finding was considered 
treatment-related. Due to the rarity of this type of neoplasm in nonhuman primates, the 
absence of genotoxicity, the reported immunotoxicity in the study and the known association of 
AML and immunosuppression in humans, the Applicant attributed this finding to a secondary 
effect of the product due to immunosuppression. However, the clinical relevance of this finding 
is unknown. A warning on second primary malignancies (SPM) has been included in the SmPC 
and the monitoring of SPM in clinical studies has been included in the pharmacovigilance plan of 
the risk management plan (RMP).  
Pomalidomide was not genotoxic. No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted. This is 
acceptable in view of the therapeutic indication.  
Pomalidomide had adverse effects on fertility and early embryonic development and was 
teratogenic in both test species. Consequently, a pregnancy prevention programme is 
implemented as part of the RMP and conditions of the marketing authorisation. Pomalidomide is 
contraindicated in pregnancy as well as in women of childbearing potential and male patients 
unless adhering to the conditions of the PPP; warning and relevant information have also been 
included in sections 4.4, 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC.  
Based on the environmental risk assessment, pomalidomide is not expected to pose a risk to 
the environment.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical studies conducted were adequate to support the marketing authorisation of 
pomalidomide in the treatment of MM.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic behaviour of pomalidomide was documented in 5 studies in healthy 
volunteers, 2 studies in multiple myeloma patients and was supplemented by data from 8 in 
vitro studies. 
Absorption  
Pomalidomide is a small molecule with low aqueous solubility and low permeability, classified as 
BCS class IV.  The low solubility limits the rate of absorption at higher doses (> 5 mg), but has 
no discernible impact on the extent of absorption up to doses of 50 mg.  Not unexpectedly, 
given the low aqueous solubility, formulation is an important determinant of the rate of 
absorption.   
Pomalidomide was absorbed with a maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) occurring between 
2 and 3 hours and is at least 73% absorbed following administration of single oral dose. The 
systemic exposure (AUC) of pomalidomide increases in an approximately linear and dose 
proportional manner. Following multiple doses, pomalidomide has an accumulation ratio of 27 
to 31% on AUC.  
Coadministration with a high-fat and high-calorie meal slowed the rate of absorption, 
decreasing plasma Cmax by approximately 25%, but had minimal effect on the overall extent of 
absorption with an 8% decrease in AUC.  In the fasted state tmax ranged between 1 and 4 
hours at clinical doses.  
The absolute bioavailability of pomalidomide has not been studied. 
Distribution 
Pomalidomide contains one chiral centre and is manufactured in its racemic form.  All clinical 
studies were performed using the racemic mixture.  In vitro plasma protein binding of 
pomalidomide, determined over a concentration range of 30 to 1000 ng/mL, was 
stereoselective, with the mean percentage bound of 16% for the R-enantiomer and 42% for the 
S-enantiomer.  Although the lowest concentration was somewhat high relative to therapeutic 
drug concentrations, given the low to moderate extent of protein binding, it is accepted that 
protein binding is unlikely to be important over the therapeutic range.  There is no concern 
regarding displacement interactions or impact of disease on drug protein binding.  
The apparent volume of distribution of pomalidomide ranged on average from 74 L to 138 L  
across a dose range of 1 mg to 10 mg in healthy volunteers and from 62 L to 97 L in multiple 
myeloma patients.  In the human AME study (CC-4047-CP-004), blood to plasma ratios for 
radioactivity ranged from 0.749 ± 0.0357 at 0.5 hours post dose to 0.904 ± 0.0444 at 24 hours 
post dose, suggesting that radioactivity distributed readily into red blood cells.  
Pomalidomide is distributed in semen of healthy subjects at a concentration of approximately 
67% of plasma level at 4 hours post-dose after 4 days of QD dosing at 4 mg (CC-4047-CP-006).

Elimination 
Pomalidomide is eliminated from plasma with a geometric mean terminal half-life ranging from 
5.7 to 10.8 hours and total clearance (CL/F) ranging from 6.5 to 10.8 L/hr, with no apparent 
dose-related trend. 
A mass balance study using radiolabelled pomalidomide was conducted in eight healthy male 
volunteers to quantify the rates and routes of elimination and to identify and quantify 
circulating and excreted metabolites.  In addition, a chiral bioanalytical method was used to 
quantify the two enantiomers (the only in vivo data available for the two enantiomers) in 
plasma. The elimination of total radioactivity in plasma mirrored that of parent drug. There 
were no circulating major metabolites in plasma.  The mean total recovery of radioactivity was 
lower than ideal (88% of dose) and ranged from 64% to 110%. Metabolism is the primary 
mechanism of elimination of pomalidomide (less than 10% of dose excreted unchanged in urine 
and faeces) and urine is the primary route for excretion of pomalidomide metabolites (72% of 
dose was recovered in urine and 15% in faeces). The predominant metabolites in excreta were 
the hydrolysis product, M11 (24% of dose), and two glucuronides (M12 and M13; 29% of dose) 
of a hydroxylated metabolite (M17).  The M17 pathway (M17 + glucuronide metabolites) 
accounts for at least 35% of the dose.  Six other minor metabolites were also detected in 
excreta.  As there were no major circulating metabolites, metabolites were not measured in any 
clinical pharmacology studies.  
The mean Cmax and AUC0-t values for the R and S-enantiomers were approximately 50% of 
those observed for pomalidomide in plasma and the AUC0-∞ ratio was 1.0. 
The metabolism of pomalidomide was studied in vitro in human hepatocytes, which showed low 
rates of metabolism. The principal routes of metabolism were hydroxylation, glucuronidation of 
hydroxylated metabolites and hydrolysis.  An in vitro study with recombinant CYP isozymes also 
showed low rates of metabolism. The hydrolysis product, M11, appears to be formed by 
chemical degradation and/or non-P450 metabolism. The relative contribution of each isoenzyme 
to the formation of M17 was estimated to be 54%, 30%, 11% and 4% for CYP 1A2, 3A4, 2C19 
and 2D6, respectively.  Given the low turnover (<10%) during these experiments, further 
evidence to confirm the enzymes responsible for the elimination of pomalidomide is required. 
Pomalidomide is also a substrate for P-glycoprotein.   
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The low aqueous solubility of pomalidomide results in a less than proportional increase in Cmax 
over the dose range of 1 to 50 mg, most in evidence for doses > 10 mg, while AUC is 
proportional to dose.  From exploratory analysis, it appears that Cmax is proportional to dose 
over the dose range of 0.5 to 5 mg, however this should be verified by the Applicant in the 
planned population pharmacokinetic analysis. 
There was very little accumulation of pomalidomide after once daily dosing in healthy 
volunteers and steady-state concentrations were achieved by Day 3 of multiple dosing.  
However, there is evidence of greater (and highly variable) accumulation in multiple myeloma 
patients.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The Applicant has conducted a comprehensive package of in vitro studies to support inferences 
regarding the potential impact of co-administration of pomalidomide with other drugs. 
Pomalidomide was investigated in vitro to determine its potential for induction of CYP enzymes. 
The predominant metabolic pathways of excreted radioactivity are hydroxylation with 
subsequent glucuronidation, or hydrolysis. In vitro, CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 were identified as the 
primary enzymes involved in the CYP-mediated hydroxylation of pomalidomide, with additional 
minor contributions from CYP2C19 and CYP2D6.  Pomalidomide is also a substrate of P-
glycoprotein in vitro. The results of the potential for pomalidomide to inhibit P-gp were 
considered inconclusive. Pomalidomide is not an inhibitor of CYP enzymes and does not appear 
to inhibit drug transport proteins other than P-gp. 
The applicant has also provided results of in vivo interaction studies.  Co-administration of 
pomalidomide with the strong CYP3A4/5 and P-gp inhibitor ketoconazole, or the strong 
CYP3A4/5 inducer carbamazepine, had no clinically relevant effect on exposure to 
pomalidomide. Co-administration of the strong CYP1A2 inhibitor fluvoxamine with pomalidomide 
in the presence of ketoconazole, increased exposure to pomalidomide by 104 % with a 90% 
confidence interval [88% to 122%] compared to pomalidomide plus ketoconazole.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Limited pharmacodynamic data from studies on healthy volunteers and MM patients have been 
submitted.  
The exact mechanism of action of pomalidomide is unknown but results in tumouricidal, 
immunomodulatory, anti-angiogenic, and anti-inflammatory properties seen also with other 
drugs of the same class. However, pomalidomide exhibits a general greater potency compared 
to thalidomide or lenalidomide. 
Pomalidomide Celgene 
Assessment report

Page 29/87 
 
 
 
  
Pomalidomide has also shown inhibition of tumour growth in cells resistant to other drugs, 
including lenalidomide. Combination of pomalidomide and dexamethasone results in a synergy 
in anti-proliferative activities although the exact mechanism of action is unknown. This synergy 
was detected earlier in non-clinical studies. Additional clinical data based on the extensive use 
of dexamethasone with lenalidomide and thalidomide and the expected rapid onset of activity of 
dexamethasone compared to immunomodulatory agents support the proposed combination.  
A dose related decrease in CD4 counts but not in CD8 counts has been observed in healthy 
subjects while in MM patients’ serum paraprotein decreases in a dose related manner.  
No data on exposure-response has been submitted. 
No formal thorough QT/QTc study in healthy subjects has been conducted.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Overall the PK data supported the proposed posology in the target population. 
Pomalidomide has been shown to distribute into semen with concentrations approximately 67% 
of those in plasma. In view of its teratogenicity, the SmPC includes a warning on sperm 
donation and use of condoms during, between and after treatment with pomalidomide. A 
specific recommendation is also made regarding contraception in females during, between and 
after treatment with pomalidomide.   
The pharmacokinetics of pomalidomide appeared to be similar in multiple myeloma patients 
compared to healthy volunteers following single doses. There was very little accumulation of 
pomalidomide after once daily dosing in healthy volunteers and steady-state concentrations 
were achieved by Day 3 of multiple dosing. However, there is evidence of greater (and highly 
variable) accumulation in multiple myeloma patients.  Given the limited number of patients 
contributing pharmacokinetic data and the uncertainty regarding the extent of accumulation, all 
data collected in healthy volunteers and multiple myeloma patients should be included in a 
population analysis as an additional pharmacovigilance measure reflected in the RMP, to 
quantify the multiple dose pharmacokinetics and potential dose and time-dependency of 
pomalidomide. The impact of gender, race, weight and age should be covariates included in this 
population pharmacokinetic analysis. 
Pomalidomide was investigated in vitro to determine its potential for induction of CYP enzymes.  
Given that pomalidomide is a potential human teratogen and may be used in fertile women, an 
in vivo interaction study with combined oral contraceptives would have been required.  
However, given the risk of venous thromboembolism and the pregnancy prevention programme 
that defines suitable methods of contraception (excluding combined oral contraceptives) and 
concerns about the ethics and feasibility of a clinical drug interaction study, such a study was 
not deemed necessary. A warning to that effect has been included in the SmPC.  
The Applicant has only assessed the potential for P-gp inhibition in one in vitro system whereas 
two are recommended with strong and less potent inhibitors. In vitro results of the potential for 
pomalidomide to inhibit P-gp were therefore considered inconclusive. The Applicant will conduct 
an additional in vitro study to assess the potential of pomalidomide as an inhibitor of P 
Pomalidomide Celgene

EMA/CHMP/427059/2013 
Page 30/87 
 
  
glycoprotein using Caco-2 cells as an additional pharmacovigilance measure reflected in the 
RMP.   
Pomalidomide was not an inhibitor of CYP enzymes and did not appear to inhibit drug transport 
proteins other than P-gp. More than 25% of pomalidomide is metabolized, therefore the 
applicant should conduct an in vitro study as an additional pharmacovigilance measure reflected 
in the RMP to evaluate whether pomalidomide is an OATP1B1 and/or OATP1B3 substrate. 
No data in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have been submitted. Patients with renal 
or hepatic impairment should be carefully monitored. Studies are ongoing in these patients and 
will be submitted as an additional pharmacovigilance measure reflected in the RMP.  
Although pharmacodynamic data is limited and the exact mechanism of action is unknown 
pomalidomide results in tumouricidal, immunomodulatory, anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory 
effects in line with other drugs of the same class. A synergy when combined with dexamethasone 
seen in non-clinical studies and further explored later in clinical studies supports the combination. 
Pomalidomide reduces the paraprotein levels in MM and has secondary effects expected for a drug 
of this class, with neutropenia as the most frequent toxicity that led to the chosen 4 mg dose. 
No data on exposure-response has been submitted as PK data is too limited at present. All data 
collected in healthy volunteers and multiple myeloma patients will be included in a population 
analysis to quantify the multiple dose pharmacokinetics and potential dose and time-
dependency of pomalidomide. The covariates to be included in the analysis should include, but 
not be limited to, disease state, dose, formulation, fed state, age, weight, race, gender, 
creatinine clearance (ml/min) and markers of hepatic function. This will be performed and 
submitted as an additional pharmacovigilance measure from the RMP. 
No formal thorough QT/QTc study in healthy subjects has been conducted. Preclinical data 
revealed no evidence of an apparent signal for potential QTc prolongation from pomalidomide. 
QTc interval has been monitored in healthy subjects at single doses up to 50 mg with no 
evidence of QTc prolongation. In MM subjects, a QTc interval thresholds of concern was 
considered at > 500 ms and any change from baseline of > 60 ms. While serious adverse 
events of QTc prolongation have been reported, to date these data have revealed variable QTc 
values and modest changes that have not exceeded our defined threshold cut-offs of concern in 
a frequent or consistent manner. These data also do not reveal any clear trend or pattern of 
QTc prolongation, and do not appear to have significantly translated into symptomatic or 
clinically meaningful events. However, the Applicant should conduct a thorough QT study in 
healthy subjects according to regulatory guidelines as an additional pharmacovigilance measure 
reflected in the RMP. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology data is considered sufficient for approval, with additional data to be 
provided as additional pharmacovigilance measures from the RMP.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Study CC-4047-MM-001 was a phase 1b, ascending dose, open-label study conducted in 
subjects with RRMM to determine the MTD. Pomalidomide at doses of 1, 2, 5, and 10 mg as a 
single oral agent were evaluated using two different schedules: every day dosing (Cohort 1) or 
alternate day dosing (Cohort 2). The duration of treatment was four weeks. Subjects were 
withdrawn on the basis of dose limiting toxicity.  
The MTD was determined to be 2 mg daily (cohort 1) and 5 mg alternate days (cohort 2). 
However, these two cohorts did not evaluate a dose between 2mg and 5 mg.  
Myelosuppression was identified as the dose limiting toxicity suggesting a regimen incorporating 
a rest period would allow recovery of the bone marrow. Consequently, based on experience 
with other products of the same class in multiple myeloma, a cyclic dosing schedule (Days 1-21 
of each 28-day cycle) was studied. Also prior experience with lenalidomide indicated that the 
addition of low-dose dexamethasone enhanced efficacy and was better tolerated than when 
combined with a higher dose of dexamethasone.  
Consequently, phase 1 part of study CC-4047-MM-002 was designed to determine the MTD 
after administration of pomalidomide 2, 3, 4 or 5 mg doses given orally once a day for 21 days 
out of a 28 days cycle. This was a dose escalation study conducted in RRMM patients that had 
received prior treatment with lenalidomide and bortezomib. Other secondary efficacy endpoints 
included objective response, time to response, duration of response and overall survival (OS).  
Thirty-eight (38) subjects were enrolled and all were included in the ITT population. A majority 
of subjects had stage III MM (66%) with median time from first diagnosis of 5.5 years and had 
received a median of 6 prior therapies.  
Identification of MTD was to occur within the 1st cycle and after, subjects were allowed to 
continue study treatment at their assigned dose of pomalidomide. If they developed progressive 
disease (PD) at any time or fail to achieve minimum reduction of serum paraprotein of 25% 
(and 50% reduction in urine paraprotein if measurable) after 4 cycles, they had the option to 
add oral dexamethasone  on days 1, 8, 15, 22 of each 28 day cycle and continue on study 
treatment until PD developed. Those with PD who chose not to add dexamethasone were 
discontinued. 
The MTD was determined to be 4 mg daily based on dose limiting toxicity of neutropenia. 
Median duration of treatment was higher in the 4 mg cohorts compared with the 2 mg and 3 
mg cohorts.  
The response rates were higher in the 4 mg cohort with the addition of dexamethasone (CR or 
PR 29%) and also the 4 mg cohort had more subjects treated for more than 40 weeks, and 
fewer subjects requiring dose reductions compared with the other dosing cohorts. 
Addition of dexamethasone improved the results for 1 year event-free rate. It was also noted 
that when adding dexamethasone neutropenia was reported less frequently.

Median OS was highest in the 4 mg cohort at 88 weeks although median progression-free 
survival (PFS) was higher in 3 mg cohort (36weeks) than 4 mg (20 weeks). 
Based on results from this study, the posology selected for the phase 2 of the study and for the 
phase 3 pivotal study was with a starting dose for pomalidomide is 4 mg oral daily on days 1-21 
of repeated 28-day cycles, in combination with dexamethasone 40 mg oral (20 mg if > 75 
years) on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each 28-day cycle. 
2.5.2.  Main studies  
This application was initially supported by two phase 2 studies, CC-4047-MM-002 (phase 2) and 
IFM-2009-02. During the evaluation, data from the phase 3 study CC-4047-MM-003 became 
available and pivotal to this application. 
Study CC-4047-MM-003 
Methods 
This was a phase 3 multicentre, randomized, open-label study designed to compare the efficacy 
and safety of pomalidomide plus low dose dexamethasone (Pom+LD-dex) versus high dose 
dexamethasone (HD-dex) in patients with refractory or relapsed and refractory MM. 
Study Participants

All treatments were administered orally in 28-day cycles: 
•  Arm A: Pom (4 mg daily Days 1-21) + LD-dex (40 mg daily Days 1,8,15 and 22)  
•  Arm B: HD-dex (40 mg daily Days 1-4, 9-12, 17-20) 
Subjects > 75 years in both arms received dexamethasone at a lower dose (20 mg). 
During the treatment phase, subjects were permitted to receive bisphosphonate therapy and 
hematopoietic growth factors, platelet or red blood cell transfusions at the discretion of the 
investigator. Low-dose aspirin, low molecular weight heparin, or other anti-coagulant was to be 
given to all subjects assigned to Arm A as well as to any subjects in Arm B with a prior history 
of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. 
Subjects in treatment Arm A could participate in a pharmacokinetic study. Subjects were to 
continue their allocated treatment until confirmed progressive disease (PD), intolerable toxicity, 
death, withdrawal of consent or loss to follow up. 
Treatment phase discontinuation occurred when a subject had confirmed progressive disease 
(PD) by at least one member of the Independent Response Adjudication Committee (IRAC). 
Subjects who did not progress or did not have confirmed progressive disease (PD) by IRAC but 
were intolerant to treatment or no longer wished to receive study treatment remained in the 
PFS follow-up period of the treatment phase and had efficacy assessments every 28 days until 
PD. 
Subjects in the HD-dex arm who had confirmed PD, had the option to enrol into a companion 
study (CC-4047-MM-003C) to receive pomalidomide alone. 
Following treatment phase discontinuation, subjects were assessed 28 days after and then 
entered a long-term follow-up period with visits 4 times per year until death or until 5 years 
after randomization, whichever occurred first. Subjects were followed for overall survival (OS) 
and occurrence of second primary malignancies (SPM).  
Objectives 
The primary objective was to compare the efficacy of Pom+LD-dex with that of HD-dex in 
subjects with refractory or relapsed and refractory MM. 
The secondary objective of the study was to compare the safety of Pom + LD-dex with that of 
HD-dex in subjects with refractory or relapsed and refractory MM. 
Exploratory objectives included the relationship between MM response and cytogenetic 
abnormalities; determination of the population pharmacokinetics of pomalidomide when 
administered along with LD-dex in subjects with refractory MM or relapsed and refractory MM; 
pomalidomide exposure and response relationship and mechanism of action of pomalidomide.

Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was PFS by International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria (Durie 
et al. Leukemia; 2006, 1
7). 
Secondary endpoints included Overall survival (OS), Overall response (IMWG criteria per IRAC), 
‐
Objective response (EBMT criteria per Investigators), Time to progression (TTP), Time to 
response, Duration of response (DOR),  Clinical benefit response (time to increased haemoglobin 
value, time to improvement of bone pain, time to improvement of renal function, time to 
improvement of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status), QoL (EORTC 
QLQ-MY20 and QLQ-C30), as well as safety evaluations..  
Sample size 
A total of 426 subjects (284 in Treatment Arm A, 142 in Treatment Arm B) were planned for 
enrolment in the study for the primary analysis of PFS to detect a hazard ratio of 1.5 (HD-dex 
vs. Pom + LD-dex) between the 2 arms (5 to 7.5 months) at the 2-sided significance level of 
0.05..  
Randomisation 
Randomisation in a 2:1 ratio was conducted using the stratification factors of age (≤  75 vs. > 
75 years), disease population (refractory subjects vs. relapsed and refractory subjects vs. 
refractory/intolerant subjects) and number (2 vs. > 2) of prior anti-MM therapies. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
The statistical plan had a total of 426 subjects planned for enrolment. The primary analysis for 
PFS was planned to be performed after 242 subjects progressed or died during the study (PFS 
events), with 85% power to detect a hazard ratio of 1.5 (HD-dex vs. Pom + LD-dex) for PFS 
between the 2 treatment arms (5 to 7.5 months) at the 2-sided significance level of 0.05 
(equivalent to a 1-sided alpha of 0.025). 
An interim analysis for PFS was planned at 50% PFS information for futility only. An interim 
analysis for OS using the O’Brian-Fleming boundary for superiority was planned at the same 
time as the final PFS analysis, or at 50% OS information, whichever was later. All efficacy 
analyses were conducted in the ITT population (all randomized subjects) with additional 
supportive analyses in the Efficacy Evaluable (EE= all ITT subjects who took at least one dose 
of study treatment and who had baseline disease measurement and at least one post-baseline 
efficacy assessment or PFS event) population. 
Subgroup analysis were also conducted for gender, race, baseline ECOG, stratification factors, 
parameters of prognostic significance (e.g. baseline renal impairment), refractoriness to

selected prior anti-myeloma therapies, end of Cycle 2 response status, grade 3 or 4 
neutropenia/thrombocytopenia at Cycle 2 and for subjects randomized at least 6 months prior 
to the data cut-off. 
A sensitivity analysis of PFS based on FDA guideline for censoring rules as well as comparison of 
time to treatment failure between the two arms were planned.

Conduct of the study 
Based on the results of the final PFS analysis and OS interim analysis, with favourable outcome 
for Pom+LD-dex arm, the Data Monitoring Committee recommended subjects still on HD-dex 
arm (with or without PD) to receive pomalidomide, with or without dexamethasone at the 
discretion of the investigator. Per amendment 4 subjects who cross over prior to PD will

continue the treatment phase until PD, and those who cross over after PD on HD-dex will 
continue the treatment phase until the next PD. Subjects will then enter the follow up phase. 
The interim analysis was performed at 154 PFS events and the DMC recommended that the trial 
continue as planned. The final analysis of PFS was based on 267 events and an interim analysis 
of OS was performed with a data cut off of 07 Sep 2012. The database was locked on 17th 
October 2012. The median follow up was 18.1 weeks.

Response rates based on IRAC review of ITT population (IMWG criteria) demonstrated 
favourable outcome for Pom+LD-dex group. Consistent results were obtained from other 
response rates analysis including subgroup analysis. 
Ancillary analyses 
Results for the efficacy evaluable population were consistent with those observed in the ITT 
population. 
Similar PFS results were obtained by IRAC review based on EBMT criteria. Other analyses, 
including sensitivity analysis, were consistent with the primary analysis. In addition, subgroup 
PFS and OS analyses were consistently favourable for Pom+LD-dex group in all subgroups. 
Results of the subgroup analysis based on refractory status (ITT) are shown in the figure below.

Study CC-4047-MM-002 
Subjects in both arms could continue study treatments until disease progression (PD) or 
intolerable toxicity or discontinuation for any other reason. Subjects in arm B who developed PD 
at any time had the option to receive oral dexamethasone in addition to pomalidomide at the

same recommended dose of arm A.  Subjects with PD who chose not to add dexamethasone 
were discontinued from study treatment and those who chose to add dexamethasone could 
continue treatment until PD developed again.  
The pomalidomide and dexamethasone doses could be reduced or stopped due to toxicity 
according to pre-specified instructions in the protocol. All subjects received prophylactic anti-
thrombotic treatment and the use of bisphosphonates and growth factors were allowed. 
Upon discontinuation from study treatment subjects were to be assessed for up to five years, 
for survival and subsequent anti-myeloma therapies. 
A total of 221 subjects were enrolled and as of 01 April 2011, 45 (20.4%) subjects remain 
active in the study (23 arm A and 22 in arm B) and the most common reason for premature 
discontinuation is disease progression. 
The majority of subjects were male and white below the age of 75 years with MM stage III and 
had received a median of 5 prior regimens that included lenalidomide and bortezomib as per 
protocol, and had prior exposure to thalidomide (67%) and stem cell transplant (75%). Only 33 
patients were of black origin. Overall baseline characteristics were balanced between the two 
arms. More than half of the subjects were refractory to lenalidomide and/or bortezomib and 
95% were refractory to last prior regimen.  
Study IFM 2009-02 
Subjects in both arms could continue study treatments until disease progression (PD) or relapse 
or intolerable toxicity or discontinuation for any other reason. 
The pomalidomide and dexamethasone doses could be reduced due to toxicity according to pre-
specified instructions in the protocol. All subjects received prophylactic anti-thrombotic 
treatment and the use of bisphosphonates and growth factors (except first cycle) were allowed. 
84 subjects were randomized patients and comprise the ITT population. At the time of cut-off 
analysis (1st March 2011) 61 patients had discontinued from the study and 23 patients are still 
receiving study treatment. The most common cause for discontinuation was disease 
progression. 
Baseline characteristics were in general balanced in both arms. The majority of patients were 
male, median age 60 years and had stage III disease. Race was not recorded in this study. 
Median number of prior regimens was 5 and in line with the protocol all patients had received 
lenalidomide and bortezomib. Other frequently used therapies apart from steroids included 
thalidomide (73%) and autologous stem cell transplant (81%).  
More than half of the subjects were refractory to lenalidomide and bortezomib and the last 
regimen prior to study entry.

Results of subgroup analyses performed in both studies were in general in line with those of the 
ITT population, including the subgroup analysis of patients refractory to different prior 
regimens. In study CC-4047-MM-002 the subgroup results were in general more favourable for 
the combination arm except for the patients > 65 years but there was an numerically imbalance 
in this subgroup (n=51 combination arm versus n=39 in single arm).  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Dosing of pomalidomide was first studied in two phase 1 adequately designed studies to 
determine the MTD of pomalidomide. The activity of pomalidomide in MM was also explored 
earlier in the development as a single agent and in combination with low dose dexamethasone 
(LD-dex).  
Efficacy of pomalidomide in combination with LD-dex in the proposed indication was based on 
one pivotal study (CC-4047-MM-003) supported by two phase 2 studies, CC-4047-MM-002 
(phase 2) and IFM 2009-02.  
The phase 3 study CC-4047-MM-003 was adequately designed to demonstrate the efficacy of 
pomalidomide in combination with low dose dexamethasone against an appropriate comparator 
(HD-Dex) in the proposed RRMM target population. The inclusion criteria of the study 
corresponded to the criteria by the IMWG of primary refractory and relapsed-and-refractory 
multiple myeloma patients. The choice of endpoints and statistical methods were considered 
appropriate.  
Both phase 2 studies have included a population of RRMM that represents the proposed target 
population. Study CC-4047-MM-002 phase 2 was designed to compare the efficacy of 
pomalidomide with or without dexamethasone so any potential differences between arms would 
represent a benefit of having dexamethasone added to the treatment. Study IFM 2009-02 was a 
non comparative study looking at the activity of Pom + Dex in two slightly different schedules for 
pomalidomide (21/28 versus 28/28 days). As exploratory phase 2 trials the choice of endpoints 
and methodology were considered appropriate.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Data from the phase 1 studies justified the proposed dose of pomalidomide 4 mg once daily and 
dosing schedule.  
The results of study CC-4047-MM-002 showed pomalidomide as single agent failed to 
demonstrate efficacy as pre-specified in the analysis plan but when combined with LD-dex there

is significant activity with a documented response rate of 30% and a median OS of 62 weeks. It 
appeared there was no cross resistance of pomalidomide with other immunomodulatory agents 
and activity was documented in patients refractory to several prior therapies, including stem cell 
transplant. This study supported the proposed combination of pomalidomide with low dose 
dexamethasone. 
In study IFM 2009-02 pomalidomide in combination with dexamethasone showed a response rate 
of around 34% in line with study CC-4047-MM-002.  PFS results were more favourable in this 
study that may be due to having a younger population. There were no significant differences 
between the two arms although the duration of response was longer with the 21/28 day 
regimen. This study supported the dose schedule of pomalidomide for 21 days out of a 28-day 
cycle in combination with low dose dexamethasone. 
The pivotal study CC-4047-MM-003 demonstrated that treatment of pomalidomide in 
combination with low dose dexamethasone was superior to high dose dexamethasone in patients 
with primary refractory MM and relapsed- and- refractory MM. A statistically significant difference 
in favour of the experimental treatment was shown for the primary analysis of PFS (median 15.7 
weeks versus 8 weeks) and other endpoints of overall survival and response rate. Further 
subgroup analysis showed consistent results in favour of the combination treatment.  A plausible 
extrapolation of these positive results  and a clear clinical benefit to patients with relapsed 
disease by the IMWG criteria justifies the proposed indication. The indication clearly specifies 
patients should demonstrate disease progression on the last therapy but does not require to 
occur within 60 days. In conclusion, this pivotal study has confirmed the efficacy of 
pomalidomide in the proposed indication.  
Based on the results of the final PFS analysis and OS interim analysis, with favourable outcome 
for Pom+LD-dex arm, the Data Monitoring Committee recommended subjects still on HD-dex 
arm to receive pomalidomide, with or without dexamethasone at the discretion of the 
investigator. The companion study CC-4047-MM-003/C is currently ongoing. The CHMP 
recommends that the final study report is submitted when available. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of Pom+LD-dex in the proposed indication has been demonstrated.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
As of 1st April 2011, the safety of pomalidomide had been studied in 13 studies involving 171 
healthy volunteers as well as 522 patients with different oncology indications: MM (N = 386) , 
myeloproliferative neoplasm associated myelofibrosis ( N = 63) and solid tumours (N = 73). 
Following the submission of data from phase 3 study CC-4047-MM-03 (cut off 7 Sep 2012), a 
total of 300 additional patients had been exposed to pomalidomide in combination with low 
dose dexamethasone in the proposed posology. Controlled data from this phase 3 trial is pivotal 
for the safety assessment and is discussed in detail below. Data from other studies will only be 
mentioned where relevant.

Patient exposure 
In Study CC4047-MM-003, the median duration of treatment in the Pom + LD-dex arm (12.4 
weeks) was longer than that in the HD-dex arm (8.0 weeks). The median number of treatment 
cycles was 3 in the Pom + LD-dex arm (min, max: 1, 16 cycles) and 2.0 in the HD-dex arm 
(min, max: 1, 12 cycles). 
Subjects in the Pom + LD-dex arm were exposed to pomalidomide for a median (min, max) of 
63 (2, 327) days at a median daily dose of 4.0 mg. The median relative dose intensity was 
0.90. 
Subjects in the Pom + LD-dex arm were exposed to dexamethasone for a median of 12 days at 
a median daily dose of 40 mg. Subjects in the HD-dex arm were exposed to dexamethasone for 
a median of 20 days at a median daily dose of 40 mg. The difference in dexamethasone 
exposure (in days) reflects the difference in planned dexamethasone dose regimens used in the 
2 treatment arms The median relative dose intensity  for dexamethasone was similar (0.9 in the 
Pom + LD-dex arm and 1.0 in the HD-dex arm). 
Adverse events 
Almost all subjects in each treatment arm had at least 1 treatment-emergent AE (TEAE, 97.0% 
in the Pom + LD-dex arm and 93.3% in the HD-dex arm). The frequencies of any Grade 3/4 or 
Grade 5 TEAE as well as serious AE (SAE) were in general similar in the 2 treatment arms. 
More subjects in the Pom + LD-dex arm had 1 or more TEAEs that led to the discontinuation, 
dose reduction or dose interruption of either study drug compared to the HD-dex group 
(9.7%versus 5.4%; 33% versus 23.5%; 64.3% versus 43.6% respectively).

AE  Grade 3/4 (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria (NCI.CTCAE)) 
Similar percentages of subjects in each treatment arm had at least 1 Grade 3/4 TEAE (78.0% of 
Pom + LD-dex subjects and 75.8% of HD-dex subjects). Many of these events, including 
anaemia and thrombocytopenia (the most frequently occurring Grade 3/4 events), occurred in 
similar proportions of subjects in the 2 treatment arms. 
Events that occurred notably more frequently in the Pom + LD-dex arm than in the HD-dex arm 
included Grade 3/4 neutropenia (41.7% vs. 14.8%); Grade 3/4 febrile neutropenia (6.7% vs. 
0%); Grade 3/4 bone pain (6.3% vs. 2.7%); and neutrophil count decreased (4.0% vs. 0.7%).  
Events that occurred notably more frequently in the HD-dex arm than in the Pom + LD-dex arm 
included hyperglycaemia (6.7% vs. 3.0%), asthenia (6.0% vs. 3.3%) and myopathy (3.4% vs. 
0.0%). 
A total of 170 subjects (56.7%) in the Pom + LD-dex arm had at least one Grade ¾ TEAE 
considered to be related to pomalidomide, particularly neutropenia (35.7%), thrombocytopenia 
(13.7%), and anaemia (13.0%). 
Drug Related Adverse Events 
A total of 230 subjects (76.7%) in the Pom + LD-dex arm had at least 1 TEAE considered to be 
related to pomalidomide. The most common adverse drug reactions (ADRs) included 
neutropenia (38.7%), anaemia (22.7%), thrombocytopenia (18.7%), and fatigue (17.7%). An

The proportion of subjects with at least 1 TEAE considered by the investigator to be related to 
dexamethasone was higher in the HD-dex arm (71.8%) than in the Pom + LD-dex arm 
(56.7%), particularly insomnia (17.4% in the HD-dex arm and 3.3% in the Pom + LD-dex 
arm), myopathy (7.4% in the HD-dex arm and 0.3% in the Pom + LD-dex arm), and muscular 
weakness (7.4% in the HD-dex arm and 1.7% in the Pom + LD-dex arm). 
A higher proportion of subjects in the HD-dex arm (43.0%) than in the Pom + LD-dex arm 
(28.0%) had at least one Grade 3/4 TEAE considered to be related to dexamethasone. 
With the exception of hyperglycaemia in the HD-dex arm, no particular dexamethasone-related 
Grade 3/4 TEAE occurred in more than 5% of subjects in either treatment arm. Grade 3/4 
dexamethasone-related hyperglycaemia occurred more frequently in the HD-dex arm (6.7%) 
than in the Pom + LD-dex arm (3.0%) as did asthenia (4.7% in the HD-dex arm and 0.7% in 
the Pom + LD-dex arm).

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
As of 7 September 2012, the proportion of subjects in the Pom + LD-dex arm who had died (75 
of 300 subjects [25.0%]) was lower than in the HD-dex arm (56 of 149 subjects [37.6%]). The 
most common cause of death in both treatment arms was MM followed by infection. An 
overview of deaths in all randomized subjects is shown figure below.

Table 15 – Cause of death for all deaths (Safety Population) 
As of 7 September 2012, 38 of 300 (12.7%) subjects in the Pom + LD-dex arm and 21 of 149 
(14.1%) subjects in the HD-dex arm died during the treatment period (which includes deaths 
occurring on or after the date of first study drug dose and within 30 days of the last study drug 
dose). 37 subjects (12.3%) in the Pom + LD-dex arm and 35 subjects (23.5%) in the HD-dex 
arm died after 30 days from the end of treatment. 
Serious adverse events 
The proportion of subjects with at least one SAE was similar between the two arms, 153 
subjects (51.0%) in the Pom + LD-dex arm and 75 subjects (50.3%) in the HD-dex arm. The 
Pomalidomide Celgene 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/427059/2013 
Page 61/87 
 
 
  
most frequently occurring SAEs in both treatment arms were pneumonia (9.3% in the Pom + 
LD-dex arm and 8.7% in the HD-dex arm) and general physical health deterioration (7.3% in 
the Pom + LD-dex arm and 7.4% in the HD-dex arm). 
The majority of SAEs occurred in similar proportions of subjects in the 2 treatment arms. 
Exceptions include septic shock, which occurred more frequently in HD-dex subjects (4.0%) 
than Pom + LD-dex subjects (1.0%), and febrile neutropenia, which occurred more frequently 
in Pom + LD-dex subjects (4.0%) than in HD-dex subjects (none).

Subjects in either treatment arm by SOC and Preferred Term (Safety Population) 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Neutropenia 
In the Pom + LD-dex arm, 154 of 300 subjects (51.3%) of subjects had at least 1 neutropenia. 
In the HD-dex arm, 30 of 149 subjects (20.1%) had at least 1 neutropenia. Grade 3/4 
neutropenia occurred in 47.7% of Pom + LD-dex subjects and in 15.4% of HD-dex subjects. 
Serious neutropenia occurred in 2.0% of Pom + LD-dex subjects and 0.7% of HD-dex subjects. 
No subject in either treatment arm had their treatment discontinued due to neutropenia. 
Neutropenia was not considered to have been the cause of death for any subject. 
Pomalidomide Celgene 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/427059/2013 
Page 62/87 
 
 
  
Febrile neutropenia occurred in 20 of the 300 subjects (6.7%) in the Pom + LD-dex arm and in 
none of the HD-dex subjects. Febrile neutropenia was considered by the investigator to be 
related to pomalidomide in 14 subjects (4.7%). For all 20 of these subjects, febrile neutropenia 
was Grade 3/4. Twelve subjects (4.0%) in the Pom + LD-dex arm had serious febrile 
neutropenia. 
Infections 
In the Pom + LD-dex arm, 165 of 300 subjects (55.0%) of subjects had at least 1 infection. In 
the HD-dex arm, 72 of 149 subjects (48.3%) had at least 1 infection. The proportions of 
subjects with at least 1 Grade 3/4 infection were similar in the 2 treatment arms (24.0% of 
Pom + LD-dex subjects and 22.8% of HD-dex subjects). The proportions of subjects with at 
least 1 serious infection were also similar in the 2 treatment arms (24.3% of Pom + LD-dex 
subjects and 25.5% of HD-dex subjects). In the Pom + LD-dex arm, 2.0% of subjects had 
infections that led to discontinuation of pomalidomide and 2.3% of subjects had infections that 
led to discontinuation of dexamethasone. In the HD-dex arm, 1.3% of subjects had infections 
that led to discontinuation of dexamethasone. Infections were the cause of death for 8 of 300 
(2.7%) Pom + LD-dex subjects and 11 of 149 (7.4%) HD-dex subjects. The higher rate of 
death due to infections in the HD-dex arm is largely accounted for by the higher proportions of 
deaths due to septic shock and sepsis in the HD-dex arm (3.4% and 2.0%, respectively) than in 
the Pom + LD-dex arm (0.3% and 0.7%, respectively). 
Pneumonia was the most frequently occurring infection, and it occurred in similar proportions of 
subjects in each arm (10.7% of Pom + LD-dex subjects and 9.4% of HD-dex subjects). Other 
respiratory tract infections, including upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, and 
nasopharyngitis, occurred more frequently in the Pom + LD-dex arm than in the HD-dex arm. 
Lower respiratory tract infections occurred more frequently in HD-dex subjects (4.7%) than in 
Pom + LD-dex subjects (2.7%). Septic shock and sepsis occurred more frequently in the HD-
dex arm (4.0% and 2.7%, respectively) than in the Pom + LD-dex arm (1.3% and 2.3%, 
respectively), as did oral herpes (3.4% and 1.0%, respectively). Urinary tract infections 
occurred in similar proportions of subjects in the 2 arms.  
Thrombocytopenia 
In the Pom + LD-dex arm, 90 of 300 subjects (30.0%) of subjects had at least 1 
thrombocytopenia. In the HD-dex arm, 43 of 149 subjects (28.9%) had at least 1 
thrombocytopenia. At least one Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 23.0% of Pom + LD-
dex subjects and in 25.5% of HD-dex subjects. The proportions of subjects with at least 1 
serious thrombocytopenia were similar in the 2 treatment arms (2.0% of Pom + LD-dex 
subjects and 2.7% of HD-dex subjects). In the Pom + LD-dex arm, 0.7% of subjects had 
thrombocytopenia that led to discontinuation of pomalidomide or dexamethasone. In the HD-
dex arm, 1.3% of subjects had thrombocytopenia that led to discontinuation of dexamethasone. 
No subject died as a result of thrombocytopenia; however, it is noted that haemorrhage was 
the cause of death for 2 subjects in the Pom + LD-dex arm  and 1 subject in the HD-dex arm. 
Haemorrhage 
Haemorrhages occurred in 16.3% of Pom + LD-dex subjects and 21.5% of HD-dex subjects. 
Epistaxis and hematoma were the most frequently occurring types of haemorrhage, and these 
Pomalidomide Celgene 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/427059/2013 
Page 63/87 
 
  
events occurred in similar proportions of subjects in each treatment arm. Among subjects with 
haemorrhage, 21 of 49 (42.9%) Pom + LD-dex subjects and 10 of 32 (31.3%) HD-dex subjects 
had thrombocytopenia concurrently with the haemorrhage. Few subjects had Grade 3+ 
haemorrhages: 9 of 300 (3.0%) Pom + LD-dex subjects and 7 of 149 (4.7%) HD-dex subjects. 
Among subjects with Grade 3+ haemorrhages, 5 of 9 Pom + LD-dex subjects and 4 of 7 HD-
dex subjects had thrombocytopenia concurrently. Serious haemorrhages occurred in 2.7% of 
Pom + LD-dex subjects and 2.7% of HD-dex subjects. Haemorrhage was the cause of death in 
2 Pom + LD-dex subjects  and 1 HD-dex subject. 
Peripheral Neuropathy 
In the Pom + LD-dex arm, 37 of 300 subjects (12.3%) had at least 1 peripheral neuropathy 
TEAE. In the HD-dex arm, 16 subjects of 149 subjects (10.7%) had at least 1 peripheral 
neuropathy TEAE. The proportions of subjects with at least one Grade 3/4 peripheral 
neuropathy were similar in the 2 treatment arms (1.0% of Pom + LD-dex subjects and 1.3% of 
HD-dex subjects). There was no serious peripheral neuropathy TEAEs in either treatment arm. 
One subject in the Pom + LD-dex arm (0.3%) and no subjects in the HD-dex arm had 
treatment discontinued as a result of peripheral neuropathy. 
The most frequently occurring peripheral neuropathy events included peripheral sensory 
neuropathy (15 Pom + LD-dex subjects [5.0%] and 4 HD-dex subjects [2.7%]); paraesthesia 
(8 Pom + LD-dex subjects [2.7%] and 5 HD-dex subjects [3.4%]); and peripheral neuropathy 
(6 Pom + LD-dex subjects [2.0%] and 1 HD-dex subject [0.7%]).  
Among subjects with at least 1 occurrence of peripheral neuropathy, 45.9% of Pom + LD-dex 
subjects and 37.5% of HD-dex subjects had neuropathy present at baseline. Among Pom + LD-
dex subjects who did not experience treatment-emergent peripheral neuropathy, the 
percentage of subjects with neuropathy present at baseline was lower (30.0%). Among HD-dex 
subjects with no peripheral neuropathy TEAEs, the percentage of subjects with neuropathy 
present at baseline (37.6%) was similar to that in subjects who experienced treatment-
emergent peripheral neuropathy (37.5%). 
Thromboembolic Events 
In the Pom + LD-dex arm, 3.3% of subjects had at least 1 venous thromboembolism (VTE). In 
the HD-dex arm, 2.0% of subjects had at least 1 VTE. At least one Grade 3/4 VTE occurred in 
1.3% of Pom + LD-dex subjects and in no HD-dex subjects. Serious VTEs occurred in 1.7% of 
Pom + LD-dex subjects and in no HD-dex subjects. No VTE led to the discontinuation of 
treatment in either treatment arm. No subject died as a result of a VTE. 
Of the 8 Pom + LD-dex subjects with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), 1 subject had a concurrent 
pulmonary embolism; 7 other Pom + LD-dex subjects had DVT without concurrent pulmonary 
embolism. None of the 3 HD-dex subjects with DVT had a concurrent pulmonary embolism. 
Arterial thrombotic events (ATE) occurred in 1.0% of Pom + LD-dex subjects and 0.7% HD-dex 
subjects. In the Pom + LD-dex arm, these events included: embolism, ischemic cerebral 
infarction, and myocardial infarction each occurring in 1 subject. In the HD-dex arm, 1 subject 
(0.2%) had a transient ischemic attack. With the exception of the embolism in the Pom + LD-
dex arm, these ATEs were Grade 3/4 events and were serious. None of these ATEs resulted in 
the discontinuation of treatment in either treatment arm. No subject died as a result of an ATE.

Second Primary Malignancy (SPM) 
Two of 300 (0.7%) Pom + LD-dex subjects and 1 of 149 (0.7%) HD-dex subjects had at least 1 
SPM. For all 3 of these subjects, the SPM was basal cell carcinoma of the skin (a non-invasive 
SPM). 
Laboratory findings 
Only haemoglobin, leukocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and platelets were recorded with a 
post baseline Grade of 3 or 4. The percentages of subjects with Grade 3 or 4 haemoglobin, 
lymphocyte, and platelet values were similar in the Pom + LD-dex and HD-dex treatment arms. 
Substantially higher percentages of subjects in the Pom + LD-dex arm than in the HD-dex arm 
experienced Grade 3 or 4 reductions in leukocyte (44.6% vs. 12.4%) and neutrophil (55.1% vs. 
16.3%) values. No other haematology parameter had any non-normal CTCAE value at any time 
during the study. 
Biochemical parameters with the largest differences were gamma glutamyl transferase (8 
subjects [3.2%] vs. 9 subjects [7.5%]), protein urine (36 subjects [13.4%] vs. 27 subjects 
[21.6%]), and urate (72 subjects [30.2%] vs. 40 subjects [34.8%]), each of which had a 
greater percentage of Grade 3 or 4 reports in the HD-dex treatment arm. 
The only serum electrolytes reported with post-baseline Grade 3 or 4 values for subjects in 
either treatment arm (Pom + LD-dex vs. HD-dex) were calcium (corrected) (6 subjects [2.4%] 
vs. 4 subjects [3.3%]), potassium (16 subjects [6.2%] vs. 3 subjects [2.5%]), and sodium (7 
subjects [2.7%] vs. 7 subjects [5.8%]).  
No abnormal urinalysis values were recorded for any subject except for urine protein dipstick, 
for which 3 subjects (1.2%) experienced a Grade 3 abnormality in the Pom + LD-dex arm and 2 
subjects (1.8%) experienced a Grade 3 abnormality in the HD-dex arm. 
Safety in special populations 
No studies in special populations have been conducted. 
No relevant differences were found among subsets of patients in the pivotal study, including AE 
profile by gender, baseline renal impairment and age group. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No relevant safety drug-drug interactions have been identified. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Twenty-four subjects (8.0%) in the Pom + LD-dex arm had 1 or more TEAEs that led to the 
discontinuation of pomalidomide. No single TEAE resulted in the discontinuation of 
pomalidomide in more than 2 subjects.

The percentages of subjects with 1 or more TEAEs leading to discontinuation of dexamethasone 
were 8.3% in the Pom + LD-dex arm and 5.4% in the HD-dex arm.  
In the Pom + LD-dex arm, no single TEAE other than pneumonia led to the discontinuation of 
dexamethasone in more than 2 subjects. Pneumonia led to the discontinuation of 
dexamethasone in 3 Pom + LD-dex subjects (1.0%) and no HD-dex subjects. In the HD-dex 
arm, no single TEAE led to the discontinuation of dexamethasone in more than 1 subject. 
A total of 71 of 300 subjects (23.7%) in the Pom + LD-dex arm had at least 1 TEAE resulting in 
pomalidomide dose reduction. The most frequently occurring TEAEs leading to dose reduction 
were neutropenia (7.7%), thrombocytopenia (6.3%), and febrile neutropenia (1.3%). 
A total of 184 of 300 subjects (61.3%) had at least 1 TEAE resulting in interruption of 
pomalidomide treatment. The most frequently occurring TEAEs leading to interruption of 
pomalidomide were neutropenia (21.0%); thrombocytopenia (8.0%); pneumonia (4.0%); 
febrile neutropenia (3.7%) general physical health deterioration (3.7%), pyrexia (3.7%), 
fatigue (2.3%) and anemia (2.0%).  
As expected, the proportion of subjects with at least 1 TEAE resulting in dexamethasone dose 
reduction was lower in the Pom + LD-dex arm (48 of 300 subjects [16.0%]) than the HD-dex 
arm (35 of 149 subjects [23.5%]). Hyperglycaemia resulted in dexamethasone dose reduction 
in 8 of 300 subjects (2.7%) in the Pom + LD-dex arm and 2 of 149 subjects (1.3%) in the HD-
dex arm. 
The proportion of subjects with at least 1 TEAE resulting in dexamethasone dose interruption 
was higher in the Pom + LD-dex arm (151 of 300 subjects [50.3%]) than the HD-dex arm (65 
of 149 subjects [43.6%]) mainly due to neutropenia (11.0% in the Pom + LD-dex arm and 
2.7% in the HD-dex arm); pneumonia (4.3% in the Pom + LD-dex arm and 4.7% in the HD-
dex arm)and thrombocytopenia (4.0% Pom + LD-dex arm and 2.0% in the HD-dex arm).

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
A total of 300 patients in the study CC-4047-MM-003 have been treated with Pom+LD-dex and 
149 with HD-dex. Subjects who were treated with Pom + LD-dex had a longer duration of 
treatment compared with subjects treated with HD-dex (median 87 days versus 56 days). This 
higher duration of the treatment in the experimental arm could intuitively indicate a better 
tolerability-efficacy of Pom+LD-dex, highlighting the differences between the regimens of 
dexamethasone and the efficacy of pomalidomide. 
In the pivotal study, frequencies of TEAEs were generally similar in both treatment arms. On 
the one hand, blood and lymphatic system disorders (69.7% vs. 57.0%); general disorders 
(64.0% vs. 55.0%); infections and infestations (55.0% vs. 48.3%); gastrointestinal disorders 
(52.3% vs. 36.9%); respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders (41.7% vs. 25.5%); 
nervous system disorders (33.0% vs. 30.2%) and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Pomalidomide Celgene 
Assessment report

Page 67/87 
 
  
(24.3% vs. 14.8%) were more frequently described in the Pomalidomide arm. On the other 
hand, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (43.3% vs. 48.3%); metabolism and 
nutrition disorders (31.7% vs. 40.3%) and psychiatric disorders (22.3% vs. 33.6%) were more 
frequently described in the HD-dex group. Overall, the experimental arm has reported a higher 
percentage of TEAE. 
The most frequent AEs for pomalidomide arm were anaemia (45.7%), neutropenia (45.3%), 
fatigue (28.3%), thrombocytopenia (27%), pyrexia (21%), constipation (19.3%), diarrhoea 
(18.3%), dyspnoea (16.7%), cough (15%), back and bone pain (14.7%) and leucopoenia 
(12.3%).  
This profile of AEs seemed very similar to that previously described for pom+dex in the phase II 
studies. Importantly, the AEs appeared to occur early after initiation of treatment, during the 
first cycles, tending to decrease over time. 
Neutropenias, infections, thrombocytopenia, haemorrhage, peripheral neuropathy, 
thromboembolic events and second primary malignancy have been identified as AEs of special 
interest based on experience and knowledge of others drugs with similar mechanism of action 
(thalidomide and lenalidomide).  
Neutropenia was the most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 haematological adverse reaction in 
patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, followed by anaemia and 
thrombocytopenia. Patients should be monitored for haematological adverse reactions, 
especially neutropenia. Patients should be advised to promptly report febrile episodes promptly. 
Physicians should observe patients for signs of bleeding including epistaxes, especially with use 
of concomitant medication known to increase the risk of bleeding. Complete blood counts 
should be monitored at baseline, weekly for the first 8 weeks and monthly thereafter.  A dose 
modification may be required (see section 4.2). Patients may require use of blood product 
support and /or growth factors.  
Infections were also common in both arms of the study (55% vs 48%), with pneumonia as the 
most frequently infection, though with similar percentage of patients between two groups. 
Grade 3/4 infections were higher in the HD-dex arm.  
Peripheral neuropathy events seemed to be similar between groups. However, pomalidomide 
appeared to have a lower risk for neuropathy than thalidomide. Patients with ongoing ≥Grade 2 
peripheral neuropathy were excluded from clinical studies with pomalidomide.  Appropriate 
caution should be exercised when considering the treatment of such patients with 
pomalidomide. 
Thromboembolic events seemed to be similar between groups, even though serious VTE were 
described in 1.7% of Pom + LD-dex subjects, whereas none for HD-dex. Patients receiving 
pomalidomide in combination with dexamethasone have developed venous thromboembolic 
events (predominantly deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) and arterial thrombotic 
events. Patients with known risk factors for thromboembolism – including prior thrombosis – 
should be closely monitored. Action should be taken to try to minimize minimise all modifiable 
risk factors (e.g. smoking, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia). Patients and physicians are 
advised to be observant for the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism. Patients should be 
instructed to seek medical care if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest

Page 68/87 
 
  
pain, arm or leg swelling.  Anti-coagulation therapy (unless contraindicated) is recommended, 
(such as acetylsalicylic acid, warfarin, heparin or clopidogrel), especially in patients with 
additional thrombotic risk factors. A decision to take prophylactic measures should be made 
carefully after a careful assessment of the individual patient’s underlying risk factors. In clinical 
studies, patients received prophylactic acetylsalicylic acid or alternative anti-thrombotic 
therapy. The use of erythropoietic agents carries a risk of thrombotic events including 
thromboembolism.  Therefore, erythropoietic agents, as well as other agents that may increase 
the risk of thromboembolic events, should be used with caution.  
Haemorrhages appeared to occur more frequently in the HD-dex group of patients. 
No differences were found between arms in relation to second primary malignancy (0.7% 
respectively in each group). Physicians should carefully evaluate patients before and during 
treatment using standard cancer screening for occurrence of second primary malignancies and 
institute treatment as indicated. 
Because pomalidomide has anti-neoplastic activity the complications of tumour lysis syndrome 
may occur. The patients at greatest risk of tumour lysis syndrome are those with high tumour 
burden prior to treatment. These patients should be monitored closely and appropriate 
precautions taken. 
Patients with significant cardiac dysfunction (congestive heart failure [NY Heart Association 
Class III or IV]; myocardial infarction within 12 months of starting study; unstable or poorly 
controlled angina pectoris) were excluded from clinical studies with pomalidomide.  Appropriate 
caution should be exercised when considering the treatment of such patients with 
pomalidomide.  
Patients with a prior history of serious allergic reactions associated with thalidomide or 
lenalidomide were excluded from clinical studies. Such patients may be at higher risk of 
hypersensitivity reactions and should not receive pomalidomide. 
Dizziness, fatigue and confusional state have been reported with pomalidomide. Patients must 
avoid situations where dizziness or confusion may be a problem and are not to take other 
medicinal products that may cause dizziness or confusion without adequate first seeking 
medical advice. Similarly, pomalidomide has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive 
and use machines. If affected, patients should be instructed not to drive cars, use machines or 
perform hazardous tasks while being treated with pomalidomide. 
Twenty-nine per cent of the subjects died during the trial. Deaths were more frequent in the 
HD-dex arm (37.6%) than in the Pom + LD-dex arm (25.0%). The most frequent cause of 
death in both arms was MM, with infections as second cause (7.4% and 2.7%). Of note, renal 
failure was the cause of three deaths in the pomalidomide group but two of these 3 subjects 
had disease progression with baseline creatinine clearance values between 30 and 45 mL/min. 
Patients with creatinine clearance <45 mL/min were excluded from clinical studies. Renal failure 
has been identified as a potential safety risk in the RMP in view of the experience in products of 
the same class. In is recommended in the SmPC to carefully monitor patients with renal 
impairment. A study in patients with renal impairment is ongoing and results will be submitted 
as additional pharmacovigilance measure reflected in the RMP.  
Pomalidomide Celgene 
Assessment report

There is no information on the use in patients with hepatic impairment. Consequently, the 
SmPC recommends to carefully monitor patients with hepatic impairment. A study in patients 
with hepatic impairment is ongoing and results will be submitted as additional 
pharmacovigilance measure reflected in the RMP.  
Looking at the SAEs, both arms seem to report a similar incidence of serious AEs (~ 50%). The 
most common SAEs in the pomalidomide group were pneumonia (9.3%), general physical 
health deterioration (7.3%), pyrexia (5.7%) and febrile neutropenia (4.0%). Of note, 18 
subjects in the experimental arm had renal failure. Of them, pneumonia, febrile neutropenia 
and pyrexia were considered by the investigator to be related to pomalidomide (most 
frequently). Serious AEs related to metabolism disorders, including hypercalcaemia and 
hyperglycaemia, occurred more frequently in the HD-dex arm (8.1%) than in the Pom + LD-dex 
arm (6.3%). 
The group treated with pomalidomide and low dose of dexamethasone had a higher percentage 
of patients with AEs and SAEs leading to discontinuation, reduction and interruption (9.7% vs 
5.4%; 6.7% vs 5.4%; 33% vs 23.5%; 64.3% vs 43.6%; AEs discontinuation, SAEs 
discontinuation; AEs reduction and AEs interruption for pom+LD-dex vs HD-dex, respectively). 
Infections (pneumonia) and renal disorders (renal failure) were the most common AEs leading 
to discontinuation of pomalidomide, whereas neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and pneumonia 
were the main cause of dose reductions and interruptions for pomalidomide treatment.  
Curiously, more patients (in per cent) had dose interruptions of dexamethasone in the 
Pom+LDdex than in the HD-dex group (50% vs 43%). Neutropenia, pneumonia and 
thrombocytopenia were again the reasons. Instructions for dose modification or interruption are 
included in the SmPC. 
Overall, the addition of pomalidomide to dexamethasone was associated with an increase in 
haematological AEs, specifically neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. In terms of non-
haematological safety, there was an increase in the occurrence of fatigue, asthenia, infections, 
constipation, and diarrhoea.  
In view of the risk of teratogenicity (see nonclinical aspects), pomalidomide is contraindicated 
in pregnancy as well as in women of childbearing potential and male patients unless adhering to 
the conditions of the PPP; warning and relevant information have also been included in sections 
4.4, 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC. 
In general, the safety profile of Pom + LD-dex remained similar regardless of age (> 65 or ≤ 
65 years old), gender or baseline renal function. However, no clear conclusions can be reached 
due to the limited sample size of these subgroups. 
Consequently, as an obligation of the marketing authorisation, the applicant should conduct a 
non-interventional post authorisation registry of patients treated with pomalidomide for RRMM. 
The primary objective of the registry study will be to monitor, characterise and determine the 
incidence of adverse reaction as well as to monitor implementation and compliance of Celgene 
PPP and off-label use. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included 
in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
In summary, the combination of pomalidomide + dexamethasone appears to have a similar 
safety profile to other medicinal products of the same class with some differences, including a 
lower risk than thalidomide for neuropathy and a lower risk than lenalidomide for 
thromboembolism. The safety profile of pomalidomide is considered acceptable, especially 
considering the relevance of the observed effects of this combination and the few therapeutics 
alternatives for these patients. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
• 
To conduct a non-interventional post authorisation registry of patients treated with 
pomalidomide for RRMM to monitor incidence of ADRs and to monitor the 
implementation and compliance of Celgene PPP and off label use and controlled 
distribution system on a country basis in agreement with relevant NCA  
(Submission of protocol within 1 month of granting of the marketing authorisation; Final 
clinical study report: 31 April 2020). 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Summary of the pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils 
the legislative requirements.  
2.8.  Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
PRAC Advice 
Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan, the PRAC considers by consensus that 
the risk management system for pomalidomide in the treatment of adult patients with relapsed 
and refractory MM who have received at least two prior treatment regimens, including both 
lenalidomide and bortezomib, and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy, in 
combination with dexamethasone is acceptable.  
This advice is based on the following content of the Risk Management Plan:

−  Advice to patients in PL. 
The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed risk 
minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed 
indication. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
2.9.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted 
by the applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the 
Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human 
use. 
The applicant requested to have a combined package leaflet for the 1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg and 
4 mg strengths. This was considered acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Pomalidomide when used in combination with low dose dexamethasone in the relapsed and 
refractory MM  population at the proposed posology has shown to be superior over the 
acceptable comparator high-dose dexamethasone for PFS (median 15.7 vs 8 weeks; HR 0.45) 
and overall survival (median not reached vs 34 weeks; HR 0.53) with a statistical significant 
difference. These results confirmed the previously encouraging results from the phase 2 studies 
CC-4047-MM-002 and IFM 2009-02. This beneficial effect was also seen in patients refractory to 
several lines of therapy or those that had received prior SCT, and showed no apparent cross 
resistance of pomalidomide with other immunomodulatory agents.   
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
Based on the final PFS analysis and interim OS analysis the IDMC recommended all subjects in 
the high dose dexamethasone arm to be offered the possibility to receive pomalidomide. As such, 
further comparison of survival between the two arms will be compromised by the cross over.

Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The most common AE was a non cumulative reversible haematology toxicity with neutropenia 
(the most frequently grade 3/4 event) anaemia and to a less extent thrombocytopenia. It rarely 
led to treatment discontinuation or was reported as serious AE. It was managed by first dose 
interruption and to less extent dose reductions.  
Infection was the most commonly reported non-haematology toxicity and serious AE, especially 
pneumonia and upper respiratory tract infections. In around half of the cases it was of grade 3/4. 
It was the second most common cause of death. Other common undesirable effects include 
fatigue, pyrexia and gastrointestinal (constipation, diarrhoea, nausea). Gastrointestinal toxicity 
was rarely of grade 3/4. Most AE tended to occur during the initial cycles tapering off later on the 
treatment. 
Expected safety characteristics for an immunomodulator such as neuropathy, thromboembolism 
or constipation were also seen with pomalidomide. Pomalidomide showed a greater 
myelosuppression compared to thalidomide or lenalidomide but had a lower risk for neuropathy 
than thalidomide and a lower thromboembolic risk than lenalidomide. A teratogenic effect was 
observed in non-clinical studies. The risk management plan therefore includes a pregnancy 
prevention programme. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Given the limited extent of the safety database, particularly in some subgroup of patients, the 
applicant should conduct a non-interventional post authorisation registry of patients treated 
with pomalidomide for RRMM in order to monitor the incidence of adverse reaction as well as to 
monitor implementation and compliance of Celgene PPP and off-label use. 
No data in patients with renal or liver impairment although studies in these special populations 
are ongoing and will be submitted as additional pharmacovigilance measure from the RMP. A 
thorough QT/QTc study has not been conducted with pomalidomide but is also planned to be 
conducted and submitted as additional pharmacovigilance measure from the RMP. So far no risk 
of secondary primary malignancies has been shown; however this potential risk will be 
monitored through long term follow-up in clinical studies.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Pomalidomide in combination with low dose dexamethasone has been shown to be superior to 
high dose dexamethasone with a clinically meaningful improvement in PFS and survival in MM 
patients who have failed lenalidomide and bortezomib. This patient population has very limited 
treatment options. 
Pomalidomide Celgene 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/427059/2013 
Page 80/87 
 
  
The most important unfavourable effects in the proposed indication are haematological toxicity 
and infection. The safety profile is as expected for a treatment of this class and is considered 
acceptable in the target population. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The benefit-risk balance is positive. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The benefit of pomalidomide in the proposed indication has been demonstrated in a controlled 
study and the safety profile is considered acceptable. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Pomalidomide Celgene is not similar to 
Thalidomide Celgene and Revlimid within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation 
(EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by 
consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Pomalidomide Celgene in the treatment of adult 
patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior 
treatment regimens, including both lenalidomide and bortezomib, and have demonstrated 
disease progression on the last therapy, in combination with dexamethasone, is favourable and 
therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

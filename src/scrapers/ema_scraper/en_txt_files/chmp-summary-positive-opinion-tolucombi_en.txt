Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Tolucombi 
Telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide 
On 17 January 2013 the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Tolucombi 
40mg/12.5 mg, 80mg/12.5 mg and 80mg/25 mg tablets intended for treatment of essential 
hypertension. The applicant for this medicinal product is Krka, d.d., Novo mesto. They may request a 
re-examination of any CHMP opinion, provided they notify the European Medicines Agency in writing of 
their intention within 15 days of receipt of the opinion. 
The active substances of Tolucombi are telmisartan, a non-peptide angiotensin II receptor (type AT1) 
antagonist, and hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazides diuretic.

Studies have demonstrated the satisfactory quality of Tolucombi, and its bioequivalence with the 
reference product MicardisPlus. A question and answer document on generic medicines can be found 
here.

will be available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been 
granted by the European Commission. 
The CHMP, on the basis of quality, safety and efficacy data submitted, considers there to be a 
favourable benefit to risk balance for Tolucombi and therefore recommends the granting of the 
marketing authorisation.

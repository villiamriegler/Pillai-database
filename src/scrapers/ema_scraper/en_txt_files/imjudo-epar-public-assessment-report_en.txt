1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant AstraZeneca AB submitted on 4 March 2022 an application for marketing authorisation to 
the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Imjudo, through the centralised procedure falling within the 
Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised 
procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 14 October 2021. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab is indicated for the first line treatment of adults with 
advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 
1.2.  Legal basis, dossier content  
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
1.3.  Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0107/2021 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0107/2021 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred.  
1.4.  Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
1.4.1.  Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
1.4.2.  New active substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance tremelimumab contained in the above medicinal product 
to be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a 
medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.

1.5.  Scientific advice 
The applicant did seek Scientific Advice from the CHMP. 
Summary of questions raised/ issues discussed in the scientific advice  
The applicant received scientific advice on the development of durvalumab, tremelimumab for the 
treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma from the CHMP on the 18 May 2017 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/286452/2017). The scientific advice pertained to the following clinical aspects:  
•  AstraZeneca intends to conduct a Phase 3 randomised study to evaluate durvalumab and 
durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab for the treatment of patients with unresectable 
HCC who are not eligible for loco-regional therapy.  
•  The proposed Phase 3 study design is appropriate to support registration of durvalumab and 
durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab at the proposed dosing regimens. In particular: 
the patient population has been appropriately defined in this study to support registration in 
HCC patients who are not eligible for loco-regional therapy; the proposed geographical 
recruitment and trial stratification criteria are appropriate and in turn, will support registration 
in this region; the sorafenib is the most appropriate active comparator for this study; the 
proposed endpoints and targeted magnitude of benefit; the proposed statistical analysis 
approach to evaluate the efficacy endpoints, as well as the multiple testing procedure to 
control the overall Type 1 error rate.  
•  The data from the Phase 1/2 Study 22 will provide sufficient evidence of contribution of 
components for durvalumab and for tremelimumab to support registration of durvalumab in 
combination with tremelimumab in patients with HCC not eligible for loco-regional therapy.  
•  The registrational utility of surrogate endpoints in this disease setting. Specifically, does the 
Agency agree that Time to Progression (TTP) (defined as time to progression or HCC-related 
death [i.e. non-HCC-related deaths will be censored]), if included as another primary endpoint, 
with appropriate control of the overall type I error rate (for example the alpha could be split 
between overall survival and TTP), could form the basis of regulatory approval in advance of 
the overall survival result being available. 
•  AstraZeneca’s proposed biomarker development strategy.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Primary liver cancer (Hepatocellular carcinoma, HCC) accounts for approximately 906,000 new cases 
and 830,000 deaths per year globally. In Europe, there are approximately 87,000 new cases a year 
and around 78,000 deaths (WHO 2020). Hepatocellular carcinoma represents about 90% of primary 
liver cancers (EASL 2018).  
The initially claimed therapeutic indication was: 
TRADENAME in combination with durvalumab is indicated for the treatment of adults with unresectable 
hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
The incidence of HCC increases progressively with advancing age in all populations, reaching a peak at 
70 years (El-Serag 2012, White et al 2017). Rates of both incidence and mortality are 2 to 3 times 
higher among men than among women in most regions (Sung et al 2021).  
The main risk factors for HCC are chronic infection with HBV or HCV, aflatoxin-contaminated foods, 
heavy alcohol intake, excess body weight, type 2 diabetes, and smoking. The major risk factors vary 
from region to region, which is reflected in the incidence of HCC across geographic regions (Sung et al 
2021). The highest incidence rates are seen in East Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, while lower rates are 
seen in Europe and North America (WHO 2019). 
Worldwide, HBV causes an estimated 75% to 80% of HCC cases, while HCV causes 10% to 20% of 
cases (Perz et al 2006). HCV infection (particularly in the US, Japan, and Egypt [Mak et al 2018, 
McGlynn et al 2015]), excessive alcohol consumption, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (linked to 
the growing prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes) represent the main risk factors for HCC (Vogel 
et al 2019).  
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Normal liver tolerogenic mechanisms are likely responsible for chronic liver inflammation or 
carcinogenesis. Chronic presentation of pathological antigens in the liver can actively suppress immune 
responses, thus inducing a state of immune tolerance to the pathogen or tumour. Hepatocellular 
carcinoma takes advantage of peripheral tolerance to evade cell mediated immune responses, which 
allows the tumour to grow. Chronic hepatic inflammatory responses are the number one risk factor for 
liver tumour development (Makarova-Rusher et al 2015). 
Moreover, increased expression of immunosuppressive cell populations, such as regulatory T cells and 
myeloid derived suppressor cells, and inhibitory signalling molecules, such as CTLA 4 and PD 1, have 
been observed in HCC (Gao et al 2009, Hato et al 2014, Pardee and Butterfield 2012) and is 
additionally associated with HBV and HCV infection. This upregulation contributes to the 
immunosuppressive environment for HCC and highlights the importance of the PD-(L)1 and CTLA-4 
pathways in HCC (Golden-Mason et al 2007, Pardee and Butterfield 2012, Peng et al 2008).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17771/2023  
Page 11/176 
 
 
 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The HCC prognosis and treatment depend on factors such as tumour burden, degree of liver 
dysfunction, and clinical performance status (PS) (Marrero et al 2018, Vogel et al 2019). Hepatocellular 
carcinoma classically develops and grows in silent fashion, making its discovery challenging prior to the 
development of later stage disease (Bialecki and Di Bisceglie 2005), which usually leads to a late 
diagnosis, with a median survival following diagnosis of approximately 6 to 20 months (McGlynn et al 
2015). Hepatocellular carcinoma is a medically complex and difficult to treat disease as the majority of 
patients have underlying cirrhosis requiring management of both the malignancy and underlying liver 
disease. Hence, the 5-year survival rate for HCC is less than 20% (Sarveazad et al 2019, Villanueva 
2019). Unresectable HCC remains a difficult to treat disease, and the majority of patients will 
ultimately die of either HCC or complications of liver disease. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Sorafenib, an oral TKI targeting multiple kinases, including VEGFR-1, -2, and -3 and BRAF, has been 
the standard of care (SOC) for advanced HCC in the first-line setting since its approval in 2007, which 
was based on improvement compared to placebo, establishing a median OS of 10.7 months (vs 7.9 
months for placebo [Llovet et al 2008]). Subsequent studies have demonstrated a median OS ranging 
from 10.7 to 13.4 months (Finn et al 2021, Llovet et al 2008, Yamashita et al 2020). In 2018, 
lenvatinib, another multiple kinase inhibitor against VEGFR-1, -2, and -3 and fibroblast growth factor 
receptor-1, -2, -3, and -4, was approved as first-line treatment for advanced HCC in patients without 
main portal vein invasion and ECOG PS 0 to 1. Lenvatinib demonstrated non-inferiority to sorafenib in 
a Phase III study, with a median OS of 13.6 months vs 12.3 months with sorafenib (Kudo et al 2018). 
Atezolizumab (a PD-L1 inhibitor) in combination with bevacizumab (an angiogenesis inhibitor targeting 
vascular endothelial growth factor A) has also been approved in the first-line setting, after the Phase 
III IMbrave150 study showed improvements in OS and PFS compared to sorafenib (Finn et al 2020b, 
Finn et al 2021). The NCCN, ESMO, and Japanese Society of Hepatology guidelines were updated in 
2020 to recommend atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab as the preferred option to treat 
first-line HCC (NCCN Guidelines 2021, JSH 2021; Vogel and Martinelli 2021 [ie, ESMO Guidelines 
2021]). 
Regorafenib and cabozantinib (both multitargeted TKIs) have been approved for patients with 
advanced HCC, who have tolerated and progressed on sorafenib (Abou-Alfa et al 2018, Bruix et al 
2017). Another approved second-line therapy is ramucirumab (a monoclonal antibody against VEGFR 
2), which has improved survival in patients with serum AFP ≥ 400 ng/mL and previous treatment with 
sorafenib (Zhu et al 2019). In addition, nivolumab (an anti-PD-1 mAb) in combination with ipilimumab 
(an anti CTLA-4 mAb) has recently received accelerated approval from the FDA for patients previously 
treated with sorafenib, due to results from the CheckMate 040 study, a Phase II study in which 
nivolumab (1 mg/kg, Q3W) plus ipilimumab (3 mg/kg Q3W × 4) (N=50; 28/50 [56%] with HBV) 
achieved a 32% ORR (Yau et al 2020). 
Unmet medical need 
Despite recent advances in treatment options, patients with uHCC continue to have a low life 
expectancy and the underlying liver disease and portal vein hypertension increase the risk of 
gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with advanced HCC, which can be potentially life-threatening. 
Currently available therapies provide only a modest improvement in survival with safety profiles that 
require management due to adverse events such as diarrhoea, hypertension, and palmar-plantar 
erythrodysaesthesia (PPE). Treatment with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab also carries a higher 
incidence of bleeding, including fatal bleeding, despite attempts to exclude patients at risk for

gastrointestinal bleeding from the pivotal study. Moreover, the underlying liver cirrhosis may result in 
moderate liver dysfunction, which may exacerbate the toxicity of systemic therapies such as TKIs. 
Hence, additional therapeutic options are needed, including options for patients with uHCC who are at 
higher risk of bleeding events, so there exist an unmet medical need for better and tolerable treatment 
options for patients with uHCC. 
2.2.  About the product 
Tremelimumab binds to CTLA-4 that is primarily expressed on the surface of activated T lymphocytes. 
Binding of CTLA-4 to its target ligands (CD80 and CD86) provides a negative regulatory signal, which 
limits T-cell activation and blocks the interaction of the co-stimulatory receptor CD28 with CD80 and 
CD86, thus limiting CD28-mediated T cell co-stimulation. Tremelimumab antagonises binding of CTLA-
4 to its ligands and enhances human T-cell activation as demonstrated by increased cytokine (IL-2, 
IFN-γ) production in vitro in whole blood or PBMC cultures. In addition, blockade of CD80/86 binding to 
CTLA-4 by anti CTLA-4 antibodies results in markedly enhanced T-cell activation and anti-tumour 
activity in animal models, including killing of established murine solid tumours and induction of 
protective anti-tumour immunity. Therefore, it is expected that treatment with tremelimumab will lead 
to activation of the human immune system, increasing anti-tumour immunity in subjects with solid 
tumours. 
Durvalumab binds to programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) (but not programmed cell death ligand-
2) and thus blocks its interaction with programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) on T-lymphocytes (T-cells) and 
cluster of differentiation (CD) 80 (B7.1) on immune cells (ICs) and is engineered to reduce antibody-
dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Blockade of PD-L1/PD-1 and PD-L1/CD80 interactions 
releases the inhibition of immune responses and may result in tumour regressions including objective 
responses based on tumour cell reduction as well as in stable disease due to tumour growth control. 
This mechanism of action may elicit eventually delay of progression and extension of survival. 
The CHMP adopted a positive opinion for the following indication: 
IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab is indicated for the first line treatment of adults with 
advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 
Posology: The recommended dose of Imjudo is 300 mg as a single dose (intravenous infusion over 1 
hour) administered in combination with durvalumab 1500 mg at Cycle 1/Day 1, followed by 
durvalumab monotherapy every 4 weeks, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Dose 
escalation or reduction is not recommended during treatment with Imjudo in combination with 
durvalumab. Treatment withholding or discontinuation may be required based on individual safety and 
tolerability.

Scientific Advice 
Summary of outcome 
EMA agreed with the principles of the statistical analysis and 
commented that the proposed interim analysis may lack power 
and/or maturity when investigating all subgroups (including 
patients with low expression of PD-L1 in whom prognosis may 
be better and treatment efficacy less pronounced). 
The design of Study 22 is appropriate, but contribution of components 
is dependent on results and could be driven by PD-L1 
expression.

Joint Pre-
submission 
Meeting 
AstraZeneca held a joint pre-submission meeting with the Rapporteur 
and Co-Rapporteur to review the planned submission of 
tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab for the 
treatment of adults with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. 
The Rapporteur acknowledged that HIMALAYA was well-designed 
to evaluate contribution of components. It was noted, however, 
that the added benefit of tremelimumab relative to the safety 
profile of the combination would be a key consideration in the 
review. 
Additionally, study integrity will be a key consideration for the 
Agency during their review. The Rapporteur sought assurance to 
support that study integrity was maintained, as the non-
inferiority margin was adopted without prior agency feedback 
during the conduct of the study. 
2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as concentrate for solution for infusion containing 20 mg/mL of 
tremelimumab as active substance.  
Other ingredients are: histidine, histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, trehalose dihydrate, disodium 
edetate dihydrate, polysorbate 80 and water for injections. 
The product is available in a 2 mL type I glass vial with an elastomeric stopper and a violet flip-off 
aluminum seal for the 25 mg presentation and in a 20 mL type I glass vial with an elastomeric stopper 
and a dark blue flip-off aluminum seal vial for the 300 mg presentation. 
2.4.2.  Active substance 
2.4.2.1.  General information 
Tremelimumab (INN) active substance is a human monoclonal antibody from the immunoglobulin (Ig) 
G2a subclass comprising of 2 heavy chains (HC) and 2 light chains (LC) covalently linked with 6 inter-
chain disulfide bonds. There is one N-linked glycosylation site at Asn-301 on each HC (Fc region). The 
molecular weight of tremelimumab is 149,145 Da. The theoretical and experimentally confirmed 
extinction coefficient is 1.43 (mg/mL)-1cm-1 and the pI is in the range of 8.5–9.0. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17771/2023

The mechanism of action is blocking of the interaction between CTLA-4, a cell surface receptor 
expressed on activated T cells, and the natural B7 ligands (CD80 and CD86) on antigen-presenting 
cells resulting in enhanced T cell-mediated immune response such as T cell activation, proliferation, 
and lymphocyte infiltration into tumours leading to tumour cell death.  
2.4.2.2.  Manufacture, process controls and characterisation 
Manufacturing and testing of the active substance is performed by Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma 
GmbH & Co. KG, Birkendorfer Strasse 65, Biberach an der Riss 88397, Germany. The active substance 
is manufactured, packaged, stability tested and quality-control tested in accordance with Good 
Manufacturing Practice (GMP). 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The active substance manufacturing process has been adequately described and is considered 
acceptable. It comprises of upstream process (cell culture steps) and downstream process (purification 
steps).  
The upstream process comprises of vial thaw, inoculum expansion, seed bioreactors, production 
bioreactor and harvest. Cell culture process is initiated with the thaw of cells from one working cell 
bank (WCB) vial. One production bioreactor results in one batch of active substance (parent batch), for 
which a unique batch number is assigned. Subsequently, this parent batch may be subject to 
splitting/pooling (sub-lotting) and stored under refrigerated or frozen conditions. The applicant defined 
the material inputs, critical process parameters (CPPs) and non-critical process parameters (NCPPs), 
and process outputs (in-process controls, microbial controls, and performance attributes) for each 
manufacturing step and are considered acceptable. The harvest is initiated by lowering the bioreactor 
temperature and followed by continuous centrifugation and filtrations (depth filtration and membrane 
filtration). The pre-harvest samples are taken from the production bioreactor on the harvest day to 
perform unprocessed bulk (UPB) testing. Harvest product is tested for bioburden and endotoxins. 
The protein is then purified using a series of packed bed chromatographic and membrane filtration 
techniques. All purification steps were sufficiently described. The used buffers and solutions, 
chromatography media, filters and other product contact disposables were presented. CPPs, NCPPs, in-
process controls (IPCs), microbial controls and performance attributes with the proposed limits (proven 
acceptable range - PARs, acceptance criteria or action limits) were adequately defined for each 
purification step.  
The purification process is followed by a formulation step, which consists of product concentration, 
diafiltration and dilution to formulate the bulk active substance at a concentration of 20 g/L. The 
formulated bulk is then filtered into a stainless-steel mobile vessel. The filtered bulk is then 0.2 µm 
filtered into the active substance containers (Ethyl Vinyl Acetate – EVA - bags) for long-term storage at 
2-8°C. Shipment to the finished product manufacturing site is carried out using EVA bags. 
There is one optional step “controlled freeze, frozen storage and controlled thaw of the active 
substance” during the manufacturing process, to facilitate frozen storage of the active substance. The 
formulated bulk active substance is transferred through a filter into cryovessels and subjected to 
controlled freezing. The frozen bulk can be stored in stainless-steel cryovessels for up 48 months at -
40±10°C. The frozen active substance can be thawed and filtered into a stainless-steel mobile vessel. 
After the indicated hold times in mobile stainless-steel vessels at specified temperatures, the thawed 
active substance is again filtered into the EVA bags which are then shipped to the finished product 
manufacturing site to initiate the manufacturing process of the finished product. The applicant justified 
its strategy to include this optional manufacturing step as it is required for commercial supply and

inventory management. The applicant clarified that the release testing of the active substance is 
performed on the bulk active substance under GMP part II (i.e. freezing, thawing, filtrations, storage 
and transfer between storage containers). This approach is considered unusual, however, all 
manufacturing steps between the bulk active substance and the active substance filled in EVA bags 
were appropriately validated and it was shown that after these additional processing steps, all quality 
attributes comply with the active substance specification. Further, bioburden and endotoxin testing are 
routinely performed at each filtration step to ensure the microbial quality of the active substance. 
Stability data under frozen and refrigerated storage conditions were provided and indicated that no 
significant change in product quality attributes was observed over the proposed storage hold times in 
the individual containers (stainless steels and EVA bags). In conclusion, the proposed strategy is not 
considered in conflict with GMP principles. Nonetheless, it is recommended that the proposed active 
substance manufacturing process and control strategy should be under intensive surveillance of the 
GMP supervisory authority during future inspections.    
Reprocessing steps have been adequately described by the applicant. 
The primary packaging component for the liquid active substance stored at 2-8°C is a disposable, 
single-use EVA bag, constructed from a multilayer film, with the product contact layer composed of 
ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer and a gas barrier film composed of ethyl vinyl alcohol. The 
materials of construction of the individual components were provided and a representative certificate of 
release from the supplier was provided. Acceptance of the EVA bags for use is based on confirmation 
from the supplier’s CoA that all acceptance criteria were met. The bags are pre-sterilised by the vendor 
using validated gamma irradiation (25 kGy minimum) and a representative certificate of irradiation 
from the approved sub-contractor was also provided in the dossier. Compatibility of the active 
substance with EVA bags was demonstrated through stability studies. Extractables and leachables 
assessment for EVA bags was performed and the EVA bags were found to be of low risk for leachables 
upon review of data from the process qualification study.  
The mobile vessel and the cryovessel are both made of 316L stainless-steel (manufactured from non-
corroding chromium-nickel-molybdenum), cleaned-in-place (CIP), steamed-in-place (SIP) and 
integrity-tested via a pressure hold test prior to use. Both are equipped with a 0.2 µm liquid filter, so 
the active substance is filtered prior to entry into these containers. Compatibility of the active 
substance with stainless-steel cryovessels and mobile vessels was demonstrated through stability 
studies. The stainless-steel tanks are considered low risk for extractables and leachables. A risk 
assessment for the presence of elemental impurities has been performed by the applicant, in line with 
ICH Q3D, and the conclusion that no specific control of elemental impurities at the active substance 
level is endorsed. 
Control of materials 
Sufficient information regarding the raw materials used in the active substance manufacturing process 
has been submitted. Compendial raw materials are tested in accordance with the corresponding 
monograph, while specifications (including test methods) for non-compendial raw materials are 
presented.  
The preparation of cell culture media and nutrient feed was adequately described in the dossier. 
Storage temperature and storage duration were provided for both cell culture media and nutrient feed. 
Information related to the origin of the cell culture medium and specifications for the material were 
provided. No animal sourced ingredients or animal derived reagents are used in their manufacture.  
Materials of animal origin were used during cell line development and also in the banking of the master 
cell bank (MCB) and adequate information regarding these materials was included in the dossier. 
Assessment report

The tremelimumab antibody was initially generated in a hybridoma cell line. The genes encoding 
tremelimumab were isolated from hybridoma cells and were used for generation of the expression 
plasmid.  
The host cell line (NS0 mouse myeloma cell line) was used for the preparation of the production cell 
line by electroporation of NS0 cells with the expression plasmid. These cells were subsequently used to 
prepare a pre-MCB stock, which was tested for sterility and mycoplasma.  
A two-tiered cell banking system is used for tremelimumab manufacturing. Preparation of the MCB and 
WCB is adequately presented in the dossier. In line with ICH Q5D, 2 independent WCB storage sites 
are used to ensure continuous, uninterrupted production of pharmaceuticals in case of catastrophic 
events. The cell banks were tested for identity, purity, cell substrate stability including sterility, 
mycoplasma, adventitious viruses and genetic stability. MCB and limit of in vitro cell age (LIVCA) bank 
were also tested for infectious retroviruses. The range of used tests is considered sufficient in 
accordance with ICH Q5A requirements and all tests met the acceptance criteria. The results confirmed 
the identity, cell banks viability and that the cell banks are free of bacteria, fungi, mycoplasma and 
adventitious viruses. Phenotypic stability was demonstrated by assessing growth, productivity, and 
product quality for a certain number of days from the WCB thaw. The genetic stability of the 
expression plasmid and integrated genes for tremelimumab was characterised based on testing of the 
MCB, WCB, and the LIVCA bank. Based on cell line stability data and viral safety data from LIVCA, the 
limit of in vitro cell age is considered adequately justified.  
The applicant has provided a stability protocol for MCB and WCB, indicating the stability tests and the 
acceptance criteria. The stability programme with respect to growth and viability (recoverability) of the 
MCB and WCB was introduced with 5 years measure intervals.  
In conclusion, sufficient information is provided regarding testing of MCB and WCB and release of 
future WCBs. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
A comprehensive overview of the critical IPCs and critical in-process tests (IPTs) applied throughout 
the active substance manufacturing process is given. Acceptable information has been provided on the 
control system in place to monitor and control the active substance manufacturing process with 
regards to critical, as well as non-critical operational parameters and IPTs. Actions taken if limits are 
exceeded are specified. 
Process validation 
A three-stage strategy is followed to define and validate the active substance manufacturing process 
throughout the process lifecycle. Stage 1 (process design) included the process characterisation and 
determination of CPPs. Stage 2 (process qualification stage) included the evaluation of the process 
design to determine if the process is capable of reproducible commercial manufacturing. Stage 3 
(continued process verification) is considered as ongoing assurance gained during routine production 
that the process remains in a state of control.  
The overall approach is in line with ICH Q7 Guideline and it is considered acceptable. Process validation 
was completed using consecutive active substance lots at the proposed commercial manufacturing 
scale at the proposed manufacturer (Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co. KG - BIP). Continued 
process verification identified 2 new critical quality attributes (CQAs) which resulted in the re-
classification of some process parameters and hold times. Additional concurrent validation data 
demonstrated that results for the process parameters and process outputs for the recently produced 
lots are consistent with the outcomes of the prospective validation study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17771/2023  
Page 17/176 
 
 
 
 All manufacturing steps were covered during the process validation studies and the process 
parameters selected included all the CPPs and selected NCPPs, the latter being further classified as Key 
Process Parameters (KPPs) and Non-Key Process Parameters (NKPPs), based on their potential impact 
on process performance. Regarding the process outputs, results for IPCs, microbial controls (MCs) and 
performance attributes (PAs) were monitored in the process validation study. The validation 
acceptance criteria for monitored process parameters were established within the PARs which were 
determined based on process characterisation study. All acceptance criteria for the critical operational 
parameters and likewise acceptance criteria for the IPTs are fulfilled, demonstrating that the 
purification process consistently produces active substance of reproducible quality that complies with 
the predetermined specification and in-process acceptance criteria. Deviations observed in the process 
validation study were investigated and it was concluded that no impact on the process validation study 
could be expected.  
Process intermediates and active substance hold times were validated through a small-scale study 
evaluating biochemical hold stability and are supported by equipment qualification hold time studies, 
demonstrating effective microbial control. Resin lifetime and carryover studies were also conducted at 
small-scale to establish the maximum number of product-contacting cycles for each chromatography 
resin used in the purification process and to demonstrate that the cleaning procedures for the 
chromatography resins are sufficient to reduce carryover of protein and host cell DNA to acceptable 
levels. Overall, the validation lifetime and carryover studies met the acceptance criteria and therefore 
the proposed maximum number of product-contacting cycles for the affinity resin and maximum cycles 
for both ion exchange resins are considered acceptable. 
Filtration membrane studies were conducted at commercial scale to validate membrane carryover 
cleaning, reuse and storage for the filtration steps in the purification process. The target maximum 
number of membranes uses is adequately defined by the applicant. Validation of reprocessing steps 
was performed using small-scale studies. In line with the Guideline on process validation for the 
manufacture of biotechnology-derived active substances and data to be provided in the regulatory 
submission (EMA/CHMP/BWP/187338/2014), the verification protocols to be applied in case of the 
need for reprocessing at large scale were provided and are considered adequate. The applicant 
demonstrated the suitability of all components that come into contact with the active substance 
formulation during the manufacture. Materials evaluated for leachables and details regarding the risk 
assessment were provided.  
In conclusion, the active substance manufacturing process has been adequately validated. 
Manufacturing process development 
Different manufacturing processes have been described. Process A to E batches were used in non-
clinical and clinical studies. All clinical studies in this application were conducted by AstraZeneca 
utilizing Process E (the intended commercial process) active substance lots. During the development, 
several formulations and manufacturing sites were used. The applicant adequately described changes 
that were made throughout the development of the manufacturing process, as well as the 
comparability assessments that were conducted.   
The applicant provided detailed results of analytical testing for the active substance lots manufactured 
from processes C, D and E. Furthermore, batch analysis data for process B and C and a summary of 
min-max ranges for early development Process A batches (used for early toxicology studies and non-
clinical PK study) were provided. Overall, the lots met the specifications in place at the time of release. 
Side-by-side testing of the characterisation tests for each comparability assessment was summarised 
in tabular format. The results demonstrate that the active substance lots manufactured using Process 
C, D and E are highly comparable in terms of product quality, physicochemical and biological 
properties.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17771/2023  
Page 18/176 
 
 
 
Characterisation 
A comprehensive physicochemical and biological characterisation of the tremelimumab molecule was 
presented. The characterisation of tremelimumab involved primary structure, higher order structure, 
carbohydrate structure, charge and size heterogeneity, and biological properties.  
In conclusion, the active substance has been sufficiently characterised, revealing that tremelimumab 
has the expected structure of a human IgG2a subclass antibody. The analytical results are consistent 
with the proposed structure. 
Product-related impurities have been well characterised and studied. These attributes are considered 
CQA and the impact of these attributes on biological activity was adequately discussed. Adequate 
characterisation of product-related impurities has been presented, and therefore, the controls strategy 
for such impurities can be endorsed. 
Process-related impurities comprise of impurities which arise from the cell substrates, cell culture and 
purification processing. Clearance and control of process-related impurities have been sufficiently 
discussed. 
In summary, the characterisation is considered appropriate for this type of molecule. 
2.4.2.3.  Specification 
Tremelimumab active substance specification has been defined in accordance with ICH Q6B and 
includes: general tests (clarity, colour, pH), oligosaccharide analysis, total protein content, identity, 
product-related impurities, process-related impurities), potency and safety attributes tests (bioburden, 
endotoxin). 
Results from the statistical analysis of both release and stability data were used to support the 
justification of the proposed specifications. Justification for the omission of certain tests has been 
adequately presented by the applicant. During the assessment, acceptance criteria for several quality 
attributes (i.e. purity, product-related impurities and potency) were tightened upon request. In 
conclusion, the proposed tests panel is considered appropriate and acceptance criteria clinically 
justified. 
The analytical methods and acceptance criteria applied during stability studies are identical to the 
active substance release specifications, except for certain tests conducted only at release. The stability 
acceptance criteria are set wider than the release acceptance criteria for several parameters, which is 
in principle acceptable. As the number of available batches for setting the acceptance criteria was 
limited, the applicant should further revise the active substance stability specification acceptance 
criteria for these parameters, when data from additional batches are available (REC). 
Analytical methods 
Analytical procedures performed in accordance with Ph. Eur. are appearance (color, clarity), pH, 
bioburden and endotoxin. Non-compendial methods are generally described with a sufficient level of 
detail (including equipment, reagents, system suitability and sample acceptance criteria) and are 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. The biological activity (potency) of the 
active substance is determined using a cell-based potency assay.  
Batch analysis 
The applicant provided detailed results of analytical testing for the active substance lots manufactured 
from processes C, D and E. The results are within the specifications in place at the time of release and 
confirm consistency of the manufacturing process.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17771/2023  
Page 19/176 
 
 
 
In addition, batch analyses data for Process B and Process C active substance lots were provided and 
min-max ranges for Process A lots were summarised.  
Reference materials 
The history of the used reference materials was provided. Several reference standards were used 
during development, however only the current primary reference standard (PRS) was used to test 
clinical material for this application. A two-tiered system of reference standards (PRS and working 
reference standard - WRS) is established and a portion of PRS was used as the first lot of WRS. Both 
PRS and WRS are representative of the production process and clinical performance and meet the 
release specifications. The preparation, storage and qualification of future standards was described in 
the dossier and is considered acceptable.  
2.4.2.4.  Stability 
The applicant proposed that the active substance shelf-life is up to 48 months storage at -50°C to -
30°C in stainless-steel vessels, followed by up to 24 months storage in EVA bags at 2°C to 8°C. The 
total storage duration should not exceed 72 months. 
The applicant provided stability data to support storage of frozen bulk active substance in stainless-
steel containers at -50°C to -30°C (long-term storage conditions), and 2-8°C and 23-27°C/55-65% RH 
(accelerated storage conditions).  
Stability studies for the frozen bulk active substance were performed using reduced-scale stainless-
steel containers (considered representative of the full-scale vessels) and lots manufactured at the 
commercial site (BIP) using the commercial manufacturing process (Process E). Long-term stability 
studies (48 months) are completed for 4 representative lots and for one lot data for 36 out of 48 
months have been provided. No meaningful change was observed under frozen storage conditions. The 
results demonstrate stability of the frozen bulk active substance at -50°C to -30°C in stainless-steel 
vessels for up to 48 months.  
Additionally, 12 months stability data have been provided for 5 bulk active substance lots stored at 
accelerated storage conditions (2-8°C and 23-27°C/55-65% RH). All stability lots met the acceptance 
criteria, however some trends in the studied parameters were observed which were more significant 
under storage at 23-27°C/55-65% RH. The applicant sufficiently discussed all these trends. Based on 
these results, the short-term storage of liquid active substance in stainless-steel containers is 
considered justified. 
The stability of the active substance when stored in EVA bags has been demonstrated for 36 months at 
5±3°C. Stability studies were performed using reduced-scale EVA bags and lots manufactured at the 
commercial site (BIP) using the commercial manufacturing process (Process E).  
Data from long-term (2-8°C, for 36 months) and accelerated (23-27°C/55-65% RH, for 6 months) 
stability studies were provided. Long-term studies are completed for 3 representative lots and for one 
lot data for 6 out of 36 months have been provided.  
Additionally, the applicant provided a summary of active substance photostability studies, conducted in 
accordance with ICH Q1B guideline. Based on the conclusions of these studies, the active substance 
should be protected from light during storage. 
A sequential stability study supporting the proposed cumulative shelf-life (48 months storage at -50°C 
to -30°C in stainless-steel vessels followed by up to 24 months storage in EVA bags at 2°C to 8°C) has 
not been performed. However, 3 active substance stability batches which were included in the stability 
study for the active substance filled in EVA bags for 36 months at 2°C to 8°C followed the 12 months 
Assessment report

storage in stainless steel tanks at -50°C to -30°C. Therefore, based on the overall presented stability 
data, the proposed cumulative shelf-life for the active substance is considered acceptable. The 
applicant committed to perform a sequential stability study utilizing at least one active substance batch 
stored in accordance with the above-mentioned conditions (REC). 
A post-approval stability protocol and stability commitment have been given. For ongoing studies any 
confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the 
Rapporteur and EMA.  
2.4.3.  Finished medicinal product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Tremelimumab finished product is a sterile, preservative-free, liquid dosage form intended for 
intravenous infusion after dilution. The finished product is provided in 2 single-dose presentations: a 
25 mg/1.25 mL vial presentation and a 300 mg/15 mL vial presentation. 
Both presentations contain 20 mg/mL tremelimumab in 20 mM histidine/histidine-HCl monohydrate, 
222 mM trehalose dihydrate, 0.27 mM disodium edetate dihydrate and 0.02% (w/v) polysorbate 80.  
The finished product is filled with a volume in excess of the label-claim volume to meet the USP/Ph. 
Eur./JP test requirements. The proposed overfill volumes are 0.26 mL and 1 mL for 25 mg and 300 mg 
presentations respectively, resulting in target fill volumes of 1.51 mL and 16 mL. The proposed overfill 
was adequately justified based on development data. The finished product does not contain any 
overages. 
The primary packaging components consist of a type I borosilicate glass vial (2R or 20R) and grey 
butyl elastomer stopper (13 mm or 20 mm) capped with an aluminium seal. The vials comply with Ph. 
Eur. 3.2.1 for Type I borosilicate glass. The butyl elastomer stopper complies with Ph. Eur. 3.2.9. 
Stoppers are silicone coated and the compliance with Ph. Eur. Monograph 3.1.8 was confirmed. 
Extractables and leachables from primary container components were evaluated based on a 3-stage 
risk-based strategy. All results were either below the Threshold of Toxicological Concern (TTC), not 
detected over time or found below the established and toxicologically justified Permitted Daily 
Exposure (PDE) level. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by finished 
product stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
The active substance is delivered ready-to-fill and no formulation or dilution steps are performed 
during the finished product manufacturing process. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical 
ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. No novel excipients or no excipients 
of human or animal origin are used in the finished product formulation. Compatibility of tremelimumab 
with these excipients was demonstrated in long-term stability studies. 
Pharmaceutical development 
The formulation composition was developed based on experience with the solubility, structural integrity 
and stability of the product. A summary of the formulation development studies was provided and the 
rationale for introduced changes to develop the intended commercial formulation was thoroughly 
discussed. A characterisation study was executed to evaluate the robustness of the intended 
commercial formulation, to identify any critical formulation parameters and to understand the impact 
of those critical parameters on the finished product CQAs. In conclusion, the suitability of the intended 
formulation has been demonstrated based on development studies.

The applicant presented 4 versions of the manufacturing process used throughout the clinical 
development. Process 4 for the commercial 25 mg and 300 mg finished product vials uses Process E 
active substance. Overall, the finished product manufacturing process development was clearly 
described. The rationale of the performed changes throughout the development was discussed 
accordingly and did not raise concerns. 
Three studies were presented to demonstrate the comparability between lots produced in different 
stages of development. The performed comparability studies are considered well designed and in 
accordance with ICH Q5E guideline. The provided results demonstrate the comparability of the lots 
produced by different finished product manufacturing processes and sites.  
Process characterisation studies were performed. Individual unit operations were evaluated regarding 
impact on CQAs and process performance parameters. Based on the results from the process 
characterisation studies, parameters that impact CQAs are classified as CPPs, while process parameters 
that do not impact any CQA are classified as NCPPs. Based on the tested ranges for process 
parameters, their respective PARs were defined. It was demonstrated that in the defined PARs there is 
no impact on the quality attributes of the product. As part of the characterisation study, the impact of 
manufacturing environment was evaluated. Leachables from in-process product contact materials were 
evaluated based on risk assessment. Potential leachables were found at concentrations well below the 
TTC limit. Therefore, the provided conclusion that the risk to patient safety is low is considered 
acceptable. 
In-use compatibility 
The finished product must be diluted into 0.9% (w/v) saline or 5% (w/v) dextrose solutions prior to 
dose administration. Compatibility of the finished product was assessed in 250 mL polyolefin (PO) and 
polyvinyl chloride (PVC) intravenous (IV) bags. Compatibility with PVC administration sets and 0.2 µm 
polyethersulfone in-line filters was also tested.  
In summary, the physical-chemical and microbiological in-use stability of the diluted product in IV bags 
has been demonstrated for up to 28 days at 2°C to 8°C and for up to 48 hours at room temperature 
(up to 30°C) from the time of preparation. The provided results support the proposed instructions for 
use and handling of the finished product stated in the SmPC (i.e., if not used immediately, in-use 
storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would not be normally 
longer than 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C or 12 hours at room temperature (up to 25°C), unless dilution has 
taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions). 
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls  
The finished product is manufactured, filled, packaged, inspected and tested in accordance with GMP at 
qualified vendors. The finished product is released in the EEA by AstraZeneca AB, Gärtunavägen, SE-
151 85 Södertälje, Sweden. A process flow diagram for the manufacture of the finished product is 
provided in the dossier. Detailed descriptions of the manufacturing steps are presented. Batch formula 
has been provided for the intended commercial batch size ranges: for the 25 mg finished product (1.51 
mL target fill volume) and for the 300 mg finished product (16 mL target fill volume).

The finished product manufacturing process consists of pre-filtration and pooling, mixing, and sterile 
filtration of the active substance, followed by aseptic vial filling and stoppering with sterile container 
closure components. There are no reprocessing steps in the finished product manufacturing process. 
Process control strategy is sufficiently detailed and considered acceptable. In line with the process 
characterisation study, CPPs and NCPPs are defined in the manufacturing process and controlled with 
appropriate limits. Elements of microbial control strategy were described in detail. Process parameters 
are monitored and maintained within established PARs. Overall, the manufacturing process and the 
equipment used are considered adequately described. 
The manufacturing process validation study was performed following a traditional approach. The 
manufacturing process was validated with consecutive lots for each vial presentation at the proposed 
commercial manufacturing site. Production scale process validation data were presented. All process 
parameters (CPPs, KPPs and NKPPS) were maintained within the specified operating ranges, based on 
PARs established in the characterisation study. To confirm process consistency, additional IPTs 
(process outputs) were monitored in the process validation study and all results fell within the 
predefined acceptance criteria.  
The pre-filtration and pooling process is designed to enable pooling of multiple active substance bags. 
The provided results demonstrate that homogeneity of the bulk active substance prior to filling is 
achieved and therefore, pooling and mixing of active substance is considered validated.  
The microbial control strategy includes process design and controls, material controls, facility controls, 
and testing. In the process validation study, all process steps were performed as expected and the 
results demonstrate adequate microbial control and sterility assurance.  
Sterilisation of primary container components is performed at the manufacturing site under GMP 
surveillance. The performed validation studies are in line with the Guideline on the sterilisation of the 
medicinal product, active substance, excipient and primary container 
(EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/850374/2015) and the provided data demonstrated the suitability of the 
selected sterilisation processes.  
Aseptic filling process is validated using media fill runs. The matrix approach alternates the smallest 
and largest vial format for media fill simulations. It is therefore ensured that the commercial batches 
are filled within the qualified aseptic filing time.  
Shipping qualification studies for the bulk vials and shipping validation for finished product packaging 
were performed. Details regarding the validation protocols and analytical testing results were provided 
in dossier and are considered acceptable. 
In conclusion, the validation study demonstrated consistency and robustness of the manufacturing 
process for both product presentations. 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis 
The proposed release specifications for the finished product were defined in accordance with ICH Q6B.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17771/2023  
Page 23/176 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The finished product specification for both 25 mg and 300 mg presentation is generally based on the 
active substance release specification and includes general testing (appearance, osmolarity, pH, sub-
visible particles, extractable volume), quantity testing, identity testing, purity testing, charge 
heterogeneity testing, potency testing and safety attributes testing (sterility and endotoxin). Most of 
the quality attributes are also tested during stability with wider acceptance criteria.  
Overall, the selection of tests is endorsed and the proposed acceptance criteria are generally 
acceptable. Acceptance criteria for product-related impurities and variants were revised during the 
procedure to better reflect the clinically qualified ranges. However, as number of available batches for 
setting the acceptance criteria was limited, the applicant should revise the finished product release and 
stability specification acceptance criteria when data from an additional 30 batches are available (REC). 
No additional impurities are introduced in the finished product manufacturing process. Product-related 
impurities are tested as part of release specification and monitored in stability studies. Process-related 
impurities are controlled in finished product release and stability specifications.  
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been 
performed, considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for 
marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) 
No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and 
the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine 
impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the information provided it is 
accepted that no risk was identified on the possible presence of nitrosamine impurities in the active 
substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no additional control measures are deemed 
necessary.  
Detailed assessment of elemental impurities in accordance with ICH Q3D guideline was provided. It is 
concluded that the overall risk of a potential release of elemental impurities into the finished product is 
low and no specific control is considered necessary. This conclusion is agreed.  
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. Most of the analytical methods used for the 
finished product testing are identical to the ones used for testing of the active substance. Transfer of 
analytical methods between testing sites has been successfully completed.  
Batch analysis 
Summary of individual batch release results for Process 3 (clinical, stability) and Process 4 (validation, 
commercial, clinical, stability) lots was included in the dossier. Results for finished product lots 
manufactured by Process 3 and finished product 25 mg lots and 300 mg lots manufactured by Process 
4 were provided. Only a summary of historic ranges of quality attributes were provided for Process 1 
and Process 2 finished product lots, which is acceptable. The results are within the specifications set in 
place at the time of release and confirm consistency of the finished product manufacturing process.

2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
The finished product stability studies were performed at long-term storage conditions (2-8°C), 
accelerated conditions (23-27°C/55-65% RH) and stressed conditions (38-42°C/70-80% RH), in 
accordance with ICH guidelines. In addition, photostability studies were conducted in accordance with 
ICH Q1B guideline. The stability studies are performed using the proposed commercial primary 
container and closure systems.  
Tremelimumab 25 mg and 300 mg commercial presentations (Process 4) and 400 mg presentation 
(Process 3, used during finished product development) were included in stability studies. Concerning 
the 25 mg finished product presentation, stability data are provided, with three process validation (PV) 
lots designated the primary stability lots. Stability testing is ongoing for additional lots manufactured 
post-PV. For the 400 mg strength, stability data are provided for multiple production scale lots (PV and 
post-PV lots). These data are included as primary data for the 300 mg finished product presentation 
and supporting data for the 25 mg presentation. For the 300 mg finished product presentation, 
stability data are provided for 3 PV lots. Results for elemental impurities from leachable studies for up 
to 48 months are available for the 25 mg presentation and only initial values were provided for the 300 
mg presentation. The elemental impurities stability testing and the formal stability study for the 300 
mg vial presentation are still ongoing and the applicant committed to submit the results for Agency 
review when available (REC). 
The claimed finished product shelf-life of 48 months at 2-8°C for both 25 mg and 300 mg 
presentations was established based on real-time data (up to 48 months) for the 25 mg presentation 
at long-term storage conditions. Data for 300 mg presentation are currently very limited (up to 6 
months), however, up to 48 months of stability data were provided for the 400 mg presentation used 
during finished product development. The applicant proposes that a combination of stability data from 
the 400 mg vial presentation and 25 mg vial presentation could be considered in the assignment of 
shelf-life for the 300 mg vial presentation. Suitability of this approach was thoroughly discussed. An 
identical primary container is used for both 400 mg and 300 mg presentations. All finished product 
presentations have the same formulation, are produced using active substance from the commercial 
process and the comparability between finished product Process 3 and Process 4 materials was 
demonstrated. Taken together, all these considerations and the comparison of stress stability study 
data demonstrating the highly comparable degradation profiles between the 25 mg and the 300 mg 
presentations, it is agreed that the data for 25 mg and 400 mg finished product presentations may be 
extrapolated to support the proposed shelf-life claim for the 300 mg finished product presentation.  
The provided stability data at accelerated stability conditions support the proposed finished product 
total time out of refrigerator of 30 days, as detectable changes are observed only after 2-6 months at 
23-27°C/55-65% RH, with no significant degradation trend. 
Thermal stress stability studies (38-42°C/70-80% RH) were performed to reveal the finished product 
degradation profile. Up to 6 months of stability data for the 400 mg and 25 mg presentations and 3 
months for the 300 mg presentation are available. Clear degradation trends were observed for purity, 
methionine oxidation and charge heterogeneity. Slight decrease in potency was observed. It was 
demonstrated that changes in quality profile under stress conditions are detectable by suitable 
analytical methods and attributes like purity, charge heterogeneity and potency are considered stability 
indicating. 
Finished product lots exposed to light showed an increase in acidic variants, higher methionine 
oxidation rate, and a slight decrease in purity. No significant differences were observed for other 
quality attributes, including potency. It is therefore agreed that the finished product should be stored 
protected from light. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17771/2023

In conclusion, based on the provided stability data, the proposed shelf-life for the finished product of 
48 months and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC (Store in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). Do not 
freeze. Store in the original package in order to protect from light) are acceptable. Reconstitution and 
in-use instructions in the SmPC are consistent with the reported stability findings of the in-use studies, 
as previously discussed. 
A post-approval stability protocol and stability commitment have been given. For ongoing studies any 
confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the 
Rapporteur and EMA. The ongoing stability programme will be followed up by the annual incorporation 
of at least one additional commercial-scale batch as stated in a stability commitment. 
2.4.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
Materials of animal origin were used only during cell line development as well as during preparation of 
specified cell banks and used also during cryopreservation of the specified cell banks. Certificates of 
analysis including information regarding the origin and certificates of suitability (CEPs) issued by the 
European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines & HealthCare (EDQM) were provided for all these 
materials. A TSE/BSE (Transmissible/Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) risk assessment for all these 
materials was performed with the conclusion that the risk of transmission of TSE/BSE from these 
materials is extremely low, which is endorsed. The applicant also provided the certificate of origin for 
the cell culture medium. This material is considered sufficiently documented, with negligible TSE/BSE 
risk of transmission. 
A comprehensive programme, in accordance with ICH Q5A, is employed to test, evaluate and eliminate 
the potential risks of adventitious and endogenous viral agents. The programme includes control of raw 
materials used in the manufacturing, viral testing and characterisation of the cell banks (MCB, WCB, 
LIVCA) used in the GMP process, virus testing of UPB and viral clearance and inactivation assessment 
of the purification process. 
Viral clearance capability of the active substance purification process was evaluated in scale-down 
experiments using 4 model viruses. The viral clearance experiments were performed matching pre-
defined acceptance ranges for process parameters and performance outputs. The level of purification 
of the scaled-down version was shown to be representative of the production procedure. 
All viral clearance experiments were performed in duplicate. The lower log10 reduction value (LRV) 
from the duplicate experiments was used to calculate cumulative LRV. The viral clearance experiments 
demonstrated that the purification process provides a cumulative LRV of ≥21.16, ≥18.28, ≥17.05, and 
≥16.49, respectively, for the 4 model viruses. For the chromatography steps, the used 
chromatography resin provided LRVs either comparable to (within 0.5 log10) or better than the new 
chromatography resin, demonstrating that resin reuse has no negative impact on the viral clearance 
capacity of the chromatography steps. The resin sanitisation and storage studies demonstrated that 
the solutions used for the sanitisation and storage of the resins meet acceptable levels of antimicrobial 
efficacy and that the risk of cross contamination is minimal.  
Endogenous retrovirus-like particles (RLPs) may be present in the cell line used to produce the 
tremelimumab active substance. These particles are measured by TEM analysis of the UPB. A safety 
factor for the removal of RLPs was calculated, resulting in a factor of greater than 9.0 log10 for the 
removal of endogenous virus, which is equivalent to less than 1 retrovirus-like particle for every 1.0 × 
109 doses of tremelimumab. The results are considered adequate.

2.4.3.6.  GMO 
Not applicable. 
2.4.3.7.  Post-approval change management protocol(s) 
The applicant introduced a Post-Approval Change Management Protocol (PACMP) to support the use of 
alternative single-use disposable filters across a number of steps in the active substance 
manufacturing process. Details regarding the planned technical assessment, assessment of 
extractables and leachables, small-scale studies and at-scale verification studies for the purpose of 
demonstration of comparability were provided. The upcoming changes will not have an impact on the 
composition, active substance and finished product specifications, active substance manufacturing 
process, critical steps, in-process controls or hold times and at-scale active substance batches will be 
placed on stability. Overall, the proposed PACMP is considered acceptable. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no 
impact on the benefit/risk ratio of the product, which pertain to lack of data for cumulative active 
substance stability study, revision and potentially tightening of the active substance stability 
specification and finished product release/shelf-life specification acceptance criteria for product-related 
impurities and variants when additional data become available and submission of elemental impurity 
stability testing and formal stability study results for the 300 mg finished product presentation. These 
points are put forward and agreed as recommendations for future quality development. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.4.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
1.  The applicant should review and, if found appropriate, revise the active substance stability 
specification and finished product release/shelf-life specification acceptance criteria when data from an 
additional 30 batches are available. 
2.  The applicant should perform a sequential stability study according to the post-approval sequential 
stability protocol and provide the results supporting a shelf-life for the active substance of 48 months 
storage at -40°C ± 10°C in stainless-steel vessels, followed by up to 24 months storage in EVA bags at 
5°C ± 3°C (for a total of up to 72 months). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17771/2023  
Page 27/176 
 
 
 
3.  The elemental impurities stability testing and the formal stability study for the 300 mg finished 
product presentation are still ongoing. The results should be submitted for Agency’s review when 
available. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
A comprehensive package of in vitro and in vivo studies was designed to characterise the 
pharmacological properties of tremelimumab with respect to mechanism of action and antitumour 
activity, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and toxicological profile. 
Based on the selective binding to human and cynomolgus monkey CTLA-4, the cynomolgus monkey 
was considered to be the only pharmacologically relevant species for assessment of nonclinical safety 
of tremelimumab. Tremelimumab binds to recombinant cynoCTLA-4 (rcynoCTLA-4) with slightly lower 
binding affinity comparable to that for the binding to recombinant human CTLA-4.  
The nonclinical safety testing strategy for tremelimumab appears to meet the requirements as outlined 
in relevant ICH guidance, including ICH S6(R1), ‘Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-Derived 
Pharmaceuticals’, and ICH S9, ‘Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals’. All pivotal 
nonclinical safety studies were conducted in an Organization for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) member country in accordance with OECD GLP guidance. The IV route of 
administration was used for nonclinical toxicity studies as this is the intended clinical route of 
administration. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
Tremelimumab (previously CP-675,206) is a fully human immunoglobulin gamma-2 (IgG2) monoclonal 
antibody (mAb) engineered to bind to cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4; CD152), 
a cell surface receptor expressed on activated T cells. Upon T-cell activation, CTLA-4 expression is 
upregulated and acts to dampen immune responses, modulating and eventually switching off T-cell 
activation. The natural ligands for CTLA-4 are CD80 [B7.1] and CD86 [B7.2], which are present on 
antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Binding of CTLA-4 to CD80/CD86 functions to limit T-cell activation, 
primarily by competing with CD28 for access to CD80/CD86 (Walker and Sansom 2015).  
In vitro, tremelimumab enhances T-cell function, measured by increased release of interleukin 2 (IL-
2), interferon gamma (IFN-γ), and other cytokines (Tarhini and Kirkwood 2008).  
In animal models of cancer, blockade of CTLA-4 function using anti-mouse CTLA-4 antibodies results in 
enhanced T cell function and antitumour activity that is enhanced by concomitant PD-L1 blockade (Wu 
et al 2012). 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro pharmacology 
Selectivity of tremelimumab was demonstrated by comparing binding to rhCTLA-4-Ig and 3 related 
proteins (hCD28-Ig, hB7.2, and hIgG1) at 1 (n=5), 10 (n=5), 100 (n=2) and 300 (n=2) µg/mL using 
ELISA to quantify the binding. Selectivity was >500 in most instances except one at 1 µg/mL in which 
the selectivity was only 14 towards B7.2.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17771/2023  
Page 28/176 
 
 
 
In a more functional assay of binding, activated T cells was used to demonstrate that tremelimumab 
(CP-675,206 at 10 µg/mL) only bind to human and monkey CTLA-4. No binding to activated T cells 
from rat, mouse, hamster, or rabbit could be detected (Report 15-CP-675,206). For the mouse a 
positive control was included. It was stated in the report that tremelimumab in excess generally 
displayed ~ 3-fold higher total binding (surface plus intracellular) to stimulated human CD3+ cells than 
to rhesus or cynomolgus CD3+ cells as judged by median fluorescence intensities. Moreover, the 
affinity of tremelimumab to rhCTLA-4 and rcynoCTLA-4 was quantified using the BIAcore 2000 
technology showing a slight difference in KD values for binding of tremelimumab to rhCTLA-4 and 
rcynoCTLA-4. KD values were 0.28 and 0.98 nM, respectively (Report 14-CP-675,206).  
It was demonstrated that tremelimumab inhibited CD80 and CD86 binding in a competitive ELISA 
assay with sub-nanomolar EC50s (0.78 and 0.46 nM respectively, Report 03-CP-675,206).  
In a functional assay of activated primary human T cells cocultured with Raji cells expressing CD80 and 
CD 86 an increase in secretion of IL2 (510%) and INF-γ (54%) was observed when treated with 
tremelimumab at 30 µg/mL as compared to the negative isotype control anti-KLH (Report 02-CP-
675,206). This concentration corresponds to one third (1/3) of Cmax (~ 100 µg/mL, Table 6, Summary 
of Clinical Pharmacology) and therefore can be considered clinically relevant. 
The involvement of CD80 and CD86 was further demonstrated in a superantigen assay (Report 08-CP-
675,206) according to which, the following was concluded: Effects of B7 blockade on IL-2 production 
and enhancement of IL-2 by tremelimumab at 30 µg/mL were tested in staphylococcal enterotoxin A 
(SEA)-stimulated human PBMC and blood cultures from 3 healthy donors. Anti-B7.1 and anti-B7.2 
antibodies (CD80 and CD86) and CTLA4-Ig (all at 30 µg/mL) were used to block B7 signalling. In PBMC 
cultures, blockade of B7.2 or B7.1 plus B7.2 reduced IL-2 baseline levels and also enhancement of IL-2 
produced by tremelimumab by 89% to 100%. Blockade of B7.1 (CD80) was less effective, inhibiting 
both baseline IL-2 and IL-2 enhancement by tremelimumab by ~ 50%. In general, blockade of B7 in 
human blood cultures produced results that were similar to PBMC cultures with slightly less reduction 
of baseline IL-2 or enhancement of IL-2 induced by tremelimumab. These studies clearly demonstrate 
that SEA superantigen stimulation is highly B7 dependent (Report 08-CP-675,206). 
In study 01-CP-675,206 PBMC and blood from further 15 healthy donors was used in the SEA assay to 
demonstrate that tremelimumab enhanced the production of IL-2 as compared to anti-KLH isotype 
control. 
The final study using the SAE assay on human biomaterial included PBMC and blood from further 15 
healthy donors and from >80 cancer patients as well (Report 13-CP-675-206). Tumour types included 
prostate (minimal and advanced disease), renal, rectal, colon, ovarian, melanoma, non- Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma (NHL), and Hodgkin’s lymphoma, but not HCC. Although the numerical IL-2 response was 
variable and PBMCs and blood from a few patients did not respond to tremelimumab, the increase in 
IL-2 response at 30 µg/mL tremelimumab can be considered consistent as observed across the range 
of tumour types in this study. Moreover, the response was also demonstrated to be concentration 
dependent with enhancement of IL-2 production from 10 µg/mL and to increase further at 30 and 100 
µg/mL. 
Similarly, cultures of whole blood from 5 cynomolgus monkeys confirmed that tremelimumab enhanced 
IL-2 production in the SEA assay at 30 µg/mL (Report 04-CP-675,206). Hence, the cynomolgus 
monkey is considered pharmacologically relevant. 
As stated by Ohue, 2019, regulatory T cells (T-regs) suppress the activation of other T-cell populations 
and that Tegs are recruited into the microenvironment inside cancer tumours to enhance tumour 
immunity. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17771/2023

Study 11-cp-675-206 was aimed at determining if blockade of CTLA4 by tremelimumab affects the 
ability of peripheral blood human Treg cells (CD4+CD25+) to inhibit IFN-γ production or 3H-thymidine 
incorporation of anti-CD3/anti-CD28 activated T responder cells (CD4+CD25-) in an in vitro co-culture 
system. Treg cells were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. FACS analyses indicated that 
84% ± 5% of the isolated CD4+ Tregs were CD25+ and Foxp3+. 
Under the assay conditions, a 2:1 ratio of peripheral blood Treg cells cultured with T responder cells 
markedly inhibited IFN-γ production and 3H-thymidine incorporation compared to cultures without Treg 
cells. Moreover, these studies indicated that tremelimumab does not reverse the ability of human 
peripheral Tregs to suppress IFN-γ production or thymidine incorporation of stimulated human 
peripheral T responder cells at 30 or 100 µg/mL. 
Studies in mice suggested that anti-CTLA-4 mAbs may also selectively deplete intratumoral FOXP3+ 
regulatory T cells via an Fc-dependent mechanism. In a key publication by Sharma et al, 2019, it is 
shown that ipilimumab and tremelimumab are not depleting intratumoral FOXP3+Tregs in human 
cancers and that this represents an opportunity for future improvement of these types of cancer 
treatments. Hence, for tremelimumab, increased activation of effector T-cells is the more likely 
mechanism of action. 
In vivo pharmacology 
A mouse surrogate antibody (hamster anti-mouse CTLA-4 mAb named 9H10) of tremelimumab showed 
relevant efficacy in a mouse tumour model (12-cp-675-206). Syngeneic SA1N fibrosarcoma cells were 
injected subcutaneously into A/J mice (5/group). Treatment with 9H10 at 200 µg on day 0, 3 and 6 
resulted in a 90% reduction in average tumour size on Day 28 compared to treatment with an isotype-
control Ab. Plasma-concentrations of 9H10 24 hours after administration was 102 μg/mL and 
decreased to 34 μg/mL 3 days later, hence were clinically relevant (Cmax ~ 100 µg/mL, Table 6, 
Summary of Clinical Pharmacology). Further studies showed a dose dependent tumour reduction at 
200, 100 and 50 µg, although with no effect at 25 µg. Hence, a mouse surrogate of tremelimumab 
demonstrated efficacy as monotherapy in a mouse tumour model, when treatment was initiated at the 
same day as the inoculation. 
All previous studies were conducted at Pfizer Groton. A new proof of concept study was sponsored by 
AstraZeneca (experimental work in 2017 and 2018, report signed 2021) demonstrating 
pharmacological activity of murine surrogates for tremelimumab and durvalumab in mouse syngeneic 
tumour models (ONC1123-0001). 
In this study, treatment was initiated when the tumours reached 100 to 150 mm3 and can therefore be 
considered more clinically relevant than study 12-CP-675,206 in which treatment was initiated at the 
time of inoculation. 
The anti-mouse CTLA-4 mIgG1 tremelimumab surrogate mAb demonstrated modest antitumour 
activity as monotherapy, but good effect in combination with anti-PD-L1 in the EMT6 breast and CT26 
colon syngeneic mouse tumour models (tumour growth and survival).

Likewise, the tremelimumab surrogate showed combination activity with anti-PD-L1 therapy in the 
MCA205 fibrosarcoma model, but no relevant effect as monotherapy. However, the effects were not 
fully comparable, while the addition of tremelimumab to durvalumab monotherapy increase the 
efficacy in colon model, in breast model, the combination effect is mainly due to durvalumab, thus in 
this case, addition of tremelimumab do not provide an increase in efficacy compared to durvalumab 
monotherapy. Due to this heterogenic data and since an uHCC mouse model has not been studied, the 
effect in the proposed indication cannot be anticipated. Monotherapy and combination with anti-PD-L1 
also induced in-tumour CD4+ or CD8+ T cell proliferation in these 3 mouse tumour models, 
demonstrating the pharmacodynamic activity of the tremelimumab surrogate with respect to T-cell 
activation. As shown previously in vitro for tremelimumab, that peripheral Tregs was not depleted (11-
CP-675,206), the tremelimumab surrogate did not deplete peripheral Tregs in vivo, establishing the 
mAb as a relevant surrogate to explore the pharmacodynamic and antitumour activity in these mouse 
syngeneic tumour models. 
A study entitled “Profiling of Biomarkers Relevant to Immunotherapies in Paediatric Solid Tumours” 
was included in the submission. Immunohistochemistry data for PD-L1 and CD8 were generated for 76 
and 77 paediatric tumours, respectively. Only one sample was positive for PD-L1 staining, defined as ≥ 
1% of TC expression of PD-L1. The level of CD8 T-cell infiltration within the paediatric tumours was 
relatively low as compared to adult tumours. Overall, these IHC data suggest a limited immune 
response against these paediatric tumours. 
It was further concluded that these data were illustrative of a group of samples with relatively low 
levels of mutation and with a limited degree of immunogenicity and immune activation. These 
characteristics suggest that checkpoint blockade, using molecules such as durvalumab and 
tremelimumab, would be unlikely to result in significant activity in paediatric tumours, and is in 
keeping with the relatively low levels of activity observed to date for similar molecules in this setting. 
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Study 07-CP-675,206 showed that plate-bound tremelimumab did not inhibit T cell activation in the 
SEA assay (0.01-100 µg/mL) as the IL-2 response was not changing in any direction at any plating-
concentration. This is presented as a surrogate measure of non-specific surface bound or aggregated 
tremelimumab in vivo in which then tremelimumab is not expected to have any effect.  
In study 05-CP-675,206 tremelimumab was added to unstimulated human whole blood from healthy 
volunteers at concentrations of 10 or 100 μg/mL and did not induce levels of TNF-α, IL-6, or IL-1β in 
Assessment report

vitro that would be predictive of cytokine release syndrome in vivo. The positive control anti-CD3 
induced cytokine release as expected in this assay. Hence, tremelimumab is not expected to induce 
spontaneous cytokine release in vivo, which is confirmed in clinical trials. 
Study 10-CP-675,206 evaluated whole blood incubated with tremelimumab and a positive control 
antibody CP-642,570. Only the positive control reduced platelet number in the incubations. 
Tremelimumab and the negative control antibody anti-KLH did not reduce platelet numbers over the 24 
-hour period the experiment lasted. It should be noted that the testing concentration was only 30 
µg/mL and is therefore not covering Cmax, i.e. no safety margin is established. Immune 
thrombocytopenia has been observed in clinical trials with tremelimumab, however not in the HCC 
pool.  
A human IgG1 antibody has much higher affinity for most human Fcγ receptors compared to a human 
IgG2 antibody such as tremelimumab. A study (16-CP-675,206) of competitive binding between a low 
concentration of 125I-labeled antibody compared to when added 500-fold excess of unlabelled antibody 
to blood leucocytes, showed that an average of 53%, 43%, and 62% of the binding of hIgG1 antibody 
was inhibited by addition of excess unlabelled IgG1 antibody to human healthy donor, human prostate 
cancer patient, or cynomolgus monkey peripheral blood leukocytes. An average of 0%, 15%, and 2% 
of the binding of tremelimumab was inhibited by addition of excess unlabelled tremelimumab to human 
healthy donor, human prostate cancer patient, or cynomolgus monkey peripheral blood leukocytes. 
These results indicate that tremelimumab shows minimal specific binding to Fc receptor-bearing 
leukocytes, whether originating from humans or cynomolgus monkeys or cancer patients. Hence, Fc 
binding is not anticipated to be part of the mechanism of action of tremelimumab. Moreover, the 
tremelimumab binding to FcγRI, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIb and FcγRIII was evaluated using SPR assays and the 
KD obtained are not expected to be reached in the clinical setting. 
In a study of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against naïve and activated 
human T cells using a FACS-based assay (09-cp-675-206), it was demonstrated that tremelimumab 
(100 μg/mL) added to naïve or anti-CD3/CD28 activated human T cells ± IL-2- activated NK cells (up 
to an effector-to-target ratio of 25:1) produced no increases in ADCC compared to the no-treatment 
controls. The positive control anti-CD3 (Mu-IgG2a) did induce T-cell toxicity in both naïve and 
activated T cells in this assay. Hence, ADCC is not anticipated to be part of the mechanism of action of 
tremelimumab. 
CDC risk was evaluated using doses below clinical concentration (5 µg/ml). CDC activity was not seen 
in cells incubated with tremelimumab under this condition.  However, given the lack of effects on T cell 
depletion in the non-clinical in vivo studies and clinical studies, it is likely that the occurrence of CDC in 
vivo does not occur at biological relevant levels. 
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
No stand-alone safety pharmacology studies were conducted for tremelimumab. This is acceptable and 
according to guideline, especially when non-human primate is the only relevant species. 
ECG, heart rate, blood pressure and vital signs (respiration rate and body temperature) was evaluated 
twice pre-dose and 5 min post dose in the GLP single dose study (tmax) and on several occasions during 
the dosing and recovery phase in the two repeat-dose studies. No dose-related changes from normal 
were observed in any study or on any occasion. 
No dedicated CNS safety study was conducted. Instead, daily observations of the behaviour of the 
animals during the studies served this purpose. This is also acceptable as it is not expected that 
tremelimumab will cross the blood brain barrier. Any CNS effects is expected to be secondary to the

pharmacological effect of increased systemic inflammation. Histopathology revealed mononuclear cell 
infiltration of choroid plexus of the brain and pituitary in the 6 months repeat-dose study. Dose-related 
mononuclear cell inflammation was present in kidney. Clinical signs of diarrhoea in the 50 mg/kg/week 
group generally correlated with inflammation in the cecum and colon. 
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies of tremelimumab were submitted. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods of analysis 
Bioanalysis 
An ELISA bioanalytical method was developed and revised over the time providing versions each of 
which was validated according to GLP and used for the three pivotal studies in monkeys. For the 6-
month toxicity and the EFD study an ELISA method validated as described in report DM2004-675206-
014 was used. These studies were conducted in 2005 and 2007, prior to issuing of the current 
bioanalytical guidelines. Hence, incurred sample reproducibility was not demonstrated. Nevertheless, 
the bioanalytical method appears to have been in good control and to be validated in GLP compliance 
according to common practice at the time of conduct including e.g. dilutional integrity up to 2000-fold, 
hook effect and specificity. 
In the assay, the ELISA plate was coated with a capture antigen (human CD152/CTLA-4). The samples 
were aliquoted in duplicate and allowed to incubate. The drug-antigen complex was then detected 
using a biotin-mouse anti-human IgG2 conjugate and a streptavidin HRP conjugate. A colorimetric 
signal is produced using a commercial TMB substrate solution. The intensity of colour generated is 
directly proportional to the concentration of tremelimumab in the sample. Sample concentrations were 
determined by interpolation from a standard curve which was fit using a four-parameter curve fit. The 
minimum required dilution (MRD) for all samples was 1:20 and the required sample volume was 0.050 
mL in duplicate. The quantitation range was 156 to 3000 ng/mL. Samples were stored at a nominal 
temperature of -80˚C prior to analysis. Using this method, stability at -80˚C was demonstrated in 
monkey plasma for 174 days. 
ADA analysis 
GLP compliant ADA analysis was used in the 1 month and 6 months toxicity studies (validation report 
DM2007-675206-022 from 2001). Samples were collected in the EFD study, but not analysed, since 
pharmacokinetics implied that this was not necessary. This is accepted. 
The ADA method was a qualitative sandwich ELISA assay in which the plate was coated with F(ab’)2 
fragments prepared from tremelimumab. Anti-tremelimumab antibodies in plasma was then captured 
by the immobilised tremelimumab F(ab’)2- fragment, washed and then detected and visualised by 
Protein G conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). A normal 
cynomolgus sodium heparin plasma pool and a reference standard plasma (diluted 1:500, 1:1500, and 
1:4500) were included on each plate as negative and positive controls, respectively. Results were 
reported as the net signal at the 1:500 dilution if not ≥3.0, then the 1:1500 was reported.  
The reference standard plasma was pooled plasma from eighteen monkeys that received a single dose 
of tremelimumab. The plasma was collected following clearance of tremelimumab as measured by 
ELISA. This reference standard served as a quality control sample in all subsequent assays.

This is not the state of the art, however it appears to be a feasible way of determining ADA. 
Reference range, dilution effects, stability, lot to lot variation of the negative control and intra/inter 
assay variability (robustness) was included in the validation. Long term stability was not presented. 
ADA could not be detected in the presence of tremelimumab above LLOQ of the bioanalytical method. 
A new method was developed for clinical samples with good assay drug tolerance. 
NAb assay 
Positive samples identified in the ADA assay were subjected to a nAb assay, which was also validated 
(validation report DM2007-675206-023). 
A non-functional qualitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay technique was utilised to determine anti-
tremelimumab neutralizing antibodies to tremelimumab F(ab')2 in cynomolgus sodium heparin plasma. 
with specificity and sufficient affinity to disrupt the binding of tremelimumab to its ligand (CTLA4) in 
cynomolgus sodium heparin plasma. 
Samples were diluted with CTLA4/Ig and incubated with F(ab')2 fragments prepared from 
tremelimumab which had been immobilised on an ELISA plate. After incubation, unbound material was 
washed away and CTLA4/Ig was detected using goat anti-mouse Ig-HRP and visualised with TMB. A 
normal cynomolgus sodium heparin plasma pool and a reference standard plasma (diluted 1:10, 1:50, 
and 1:100) were included on each plate as negative and positive controls. The presence of nAb is 
indicated by a reduction in signal intensity as compared to normal cynomolgus monkey plasma (naive 
to tremelimumab). Study samples were run at 1:10 and 1:50 dilution, and the results were reported as 
the percentage of normal plasma signal generated by a dilution of test plasma in a given concentration 
of CTLA4IIg (10 ng/mL). This is considered an acceptable strategy for a nAb assay. It should be 
mentioned that the nAb assay was not functional in the presence of tremelimumab above LLOQ of the 
bioanalytical assay. 
Absorption 
Absorption was evaluated for the subcutaneous route at 5 mg/kg. Bioavailability was 54% when 
comparing clearance/F for SC administration with mean clearance from two studies of 0.75 mg/kg IV. 
It should be noted that tremelimumab is for intravenous administration together with durvalumab in a 
hospital setting. Hence this study is of minor clinical relevance. Pharmacokinetics after intravenous 
administration is discussed in section Other pharmacokinetic studies below. 
Distribution 
As expected for a monoclonal antibody, volume of distribution is mostly confined to the vascular space 
as the volume of distribution in monkey demonstrate (Vss = 54 mL/kg). 
Metabolism 
There is no evidence of nonlinearity of the pharmacokinetics of tremelimumab over the dose range of 
0.75 to 100 mg/kg single dose. Therefore, it can be assumed that tremelimumab is not cleared via 
target mediated disposition but only through proteolytic degradation and catabolism. 
Excretion 
Excretion was not studied for tremelimumab. This is acceptable due to nature of the molecule and that 
it is expected to be cleared as small peptides or aminoacids or incorporated in the endogenous 
aminoacid pool.

Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions were not studied. This is acceptable as PK drug interactions are not 
expected. 
Other pharmacokinetic studies 
Single dose IV pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics of clonally and non-clonally derived tremelimumab was evaluated after IV 
administration of 0.75 mg/kg to cynomolgus monkey. This is a very low dose compared to the highest 
doses used in the toxicity studies (50 and 30 mg/kg/week). Minor differences in Vss (0.0705 and 
0.0538 L/kg), clearance (0.00339 and 0.00300 mL/min/kg) and resulting half-life (11 and 9.1 days), 
for clonally and non-clonally derived tremelimumab were observed. 
A single dose toxicity study was performed in cynomolgus monkeys at dose levels of 10, 30 and 100 
mg/kg. The toxicokinetic report was very brief providing only Cmax, Tmax and AUC and no 
pharmacokinetic profiles. A trend towards lower increments in systemic levels at lower dose ranges in 
all pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic studies were observed. For example, when comparing AUC0-tlast 
for 0.75 and 10 mg/kg, the increase in dose of 13.3-fold (from 0.75 to 10 mg/kg) only increased AUC 
by 7.8 and 6.8, the increase in dose of 3-fold (from 10 to 30 mg/kg) increased AUC by 2.3 and the 
increase in dose of 3.3-fold (from 30 to 100 mg/kg) increased AUC by 3.1. In addition, in the 1-mont 
and 6-month toxicity studies, accumulation on Day 29 was more pronounced at the lowest dose (AUC0-
24h D29/ AUC0-24h D1 were 1.8 and 1.6 at 5 mg/kg, 1.1 at 15 mg/kg and 1.4 at 50 mg/kg).  
New submitted PK data support that the higher accumulation observed at the lowest dose might be 
due to lower CL, although the high variability in exposure hinders understanding the PK profile of 
tremelimumab in animals. Despite the observed variability in exposure might be due to the impact of 
ADA on clearance of tremelimumab, it should be noted that the ADA analysis was limited to samples 
that showed pre-dose exposure below LLOQ (8/30 and 7/28 animals in the 1-month and 6 months 
toxicity studies, respectively) and thus, are limited to conclude the impact of ADA in exposure 
variability. 
It should be noted that the dose of 0.75 mg/kg is clinically relevant. The dose in patients is a flat single 
dose of 300 mg providing geometric mean Cmax of 100 µg/mL. This is in close range to Cmax in the 
monkeys administered a single dose of 0.75 mg/kg of 25-30 µg/mL. 
Repeat-dose IV Pharmacokinetics 
Repeat-dose toxicokinetics was evaluated in the 1-month toxicology study in which tremelimumab was 
administered IV once weekly at 5, 15 and 50 mg/kg (DM2001-675206-006). A few animals showed 
concentrations of tremelimumab above LLOQ at Day 1. However, so low as this is not anticipated to 
impact the conclusions of the study. 
No gender-related differences in exposure was observed, why data was pooled across gender. AUC 
increased according to increase in dose on day 1, however slightly more than dose-proportional on Day 
29. 
Slight accumulation was observed as a result of pre-dose plasma concentration being 30-50% of Cmax 
over the following doses. The accumulation was most pronounced at the highest dose. This could be 
due to neutralising antidrug antibodies at the lower dose levels, see below.  
Antidrug antibodies were detected in 8/12 monkey in the recovery phase. As expected, variability in 
plasma concentrations tended to increase from Day 22 and onwards. On Day 29 at the mid dose of 15 
mg/kg, 5/8 animals showed lower plasma concentrations indicating antibody mediated increased

Page 35/176 
 
 
 
clearance in selected animals. At the low dose only 2/8 and at the high dose only 1/8 showed lower 
plasma concentrations demonstrating that the animals were, in general, exposed as intended. 
Repeat-dose toxicokinetics was evaluated in the 6-month toxicology study in which tremelimumab was 
administered IV once weekly at 5 and 15 mg/kg/week, n=4 (DM2001-675206-006) for 26 weeks. The 
high dose group of 50 mg/kg/week was terminated on Day 78 due to excess toxicity (last dose on day 
43). Two male and two females continued in to a 100-day recovery phase (Study day 177). There were 
no recovery animals allocated for the low and the mid dose. Pre-dose samples were below LLOQ (0.156 
µg/mL) on Day 1 and so were all samples collected from control animals. The observed slight gender 
differences in exposure were ascribed to variability due to neutralising antibodies and resulting waning 
exposure later in the study in some animals. Hence, the pharmacokinetic data were pooled across 
gender.  
As expected, slight accumulation was observed between day 1 and 29. A slight decrease was evident 
on Day 176 probably due to increased clearance in some animals. Only one animal (34F, 15 mg/kg 
dose) developed antidrug antibodies already on day 22 were the predose sample was below LLOQ. 
From day 43, 3 more animals (28F, 12M and 14M) showed up with exposure at or below LLOQ and 
from Day 141 one more (12F). When pre-dose samples showed exposure below LLOQ, these were 
subjected to ADA assays. Anti-tremelimumab antibodies were detected in animal 12M, 14M and 34F in 
predose samples from Day 44, 44 and 23, respectively correlating with waning exposure in predose 
samples. 
The systemic exposure to tremelimumab appeared to increase with increase in dose in a linear manner 
on Day 1. On day 29, the increase was slightly lower than the increase in dose. This was even more 
obvious on Day 176 due to the increase in neutralising antidrug antibodies and waning exposure in 
some animals. However, on Day 176, a 3-fold increase in dose still increased the exposure 2-fold. All 
monkeys at 5 and 15 mg/kg dose groups had measurable plasma concentrations of tremelimumab 
throughout the 6-month treatment period following each dose except one, which reached LLOQ on Day 
141. Hence, the animals were subjected to adequate dose-related exposure during the dosing phase 
and the validity of the study. 
Since exposure was relatively stable during the study, the AUCday1-30 can be acceptable as a rough 
estimate of for calculating exposure margins. No NOAEL could be established in this 6-months study as 
the monkeys also at the low dose experienced diarrhoea requiring supportive care and skin rash. The 
low dose provided exposure from Day 1 to 30 of 94700 µg/mL*h ((=94700/30)/(19104/28)) = 
3157/682 ~ 5 times higher than clinical exposure.  
Exposure was also followed in the EFD study. Pregnant female monkeys (n=12 or 14) per group were 
dosed 5, 15 or 30 mg/kg/week IV from GD20 to GD49 (5 doses). Systemic exposure (Cmax and 
AUCGD20-49) appeared to increase with increase in dose in a linear manner. Slight increase in exposure 
was observed between GD20 and GD 49 as expected for a product with a half-life longer than the 
dosing interval. ADA samples were obtained in the study, but since only very few animals showed 
increased clearance during the study as evident from low plasma concentrations in pre-dose samples 
on day 48 (12884 in the low dose group, 12702 and 13004 in the mid dose group and animal 12836 in 
the high dose group), these samples were not subjected to ADA analysis.

2.5.4.  Toxicology 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
Two single dose toxicity studies were presented for tremelimumab. The first one was with only a 10 
mg/kg dose in one female and one male monkey and 12 weeks treatment-free observation period 
(Study 00-1985-06, non-GLP). This dose was well tolerated with no clinical signs, only a slight increase 
in lymphocyte counts was considered related to the pharmacological effect of tremelimumab. Exposure 
(AUC0-tlast) was documented to be similar to the same dose level in next study (Study 99-1985-01) and 
the female monkey was found positive for ADA. 
The second study was GLP compliant and included 3 monkeys of each sex in each group (control, 10, 
30 and 100 mg/kg) and a 15-week treatment free observation period (Study 99-1985-01).  
This study included core end points such as mortality, clinical signs (daily), body weight, food 
consumption, physical examinations, haematology, clinical chemistry, inspection of administration site, 
gross pathology, microscopic pathology. Only the control and high dose group was subjected to 
necropsy on Day 106. The others were returned to colony. Moreover, this study included evaluation of 
some safety pharmacology parameters (ECG, heart rate, respiration rate and blood pressure 5 min 
post dosing). 
AUC0-tlast was proportional to the increase in dose and all 9 animals were found positive for ADA. 
All animals survived until the end of the study. The most prominent clinical sign was diarrhoea/loose 
stool which was dose related in incidence and severity. However, this did not result in change in food 
intake or body weight. 
Haematology revealed a general drug-related increase in lymphocyte counts, which occurred in both 
males and females at ≥30 mg/kg. Moreover, a general drug-related increase in eosinophil counts was 
observed in females at all dose levels and males at 100 mg/kg. These effects are considered a result of 
the pharmacological effect of tremelimumab. The increase in circulating lymphocytes was not 
associated with corresponding microscopic changes in the organs examined. Other changes in 
haematology were consistent with stress leucogram profile as they were also observed in the control 
group or were characteristic for an inflammatory response against a foreign protein (human CTLA4 
antibody; tremelimumab). 
All microscopic findings were comparable between drug-treated and control animals and consistent 
with those commonly or sporadically found in non-human primates. 
Safety pharmacology evaluation was included in this study by assessing vital signs (heart rate, 
respiration rate and body temperature) and ECG/blood pressure twice pre-study and 5 minutes (Tmax) 
after dosing. Hence, only acute effects were monitored. No acute drug-related changes were observed. 
This is endorsed. 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
1-month i.v toxicity study with 2 months post-dose observation in cynomolgus monkey 
(Study 00-1985-04, GLP) 
The 1 month repeat-dose toxicity study was performed in compliance with GLP as a multi-site study 
with Pfizer, Groton, CT, USA as the primary site. Only the immunophenotyping and serology was not 
performed to GLP.  
Assessment report

Animals (5/sex/group) were administered tremelimumab at 5, 15 or 50 mg/kg via once-weekly IV 
bolus injection on Day 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29. Control animals (5/sex) received vehicle according to the 
same dosing schedule. Scheduled necropsies were conducted on Day 30 (3/sex/group), and following a 
2-month treatment-free period (Day 105; 2/sex/group). I.e. there were recovery animals in all four 
groups. 
Weekly IV bolus administration of tremelimumab over a period of 1 month was associated with 
intermittent diarrhoea or loose stool in individual animals across all treated groups during the dosing 
phase. In the 2-month treatment-free period, this effect was only observed in the high dose group. As 
expected from the primary pharmacodynamics of tremelimumab, reversible increases in the absolute 
number and/or percent of peripheral blood lymphocytes that correlated with increases in circulating T 
cells and/or B cells at 15 and 50 mg/kg/week was observed. Histopathology revealed periportal 
mononuclear cell infiltrates in the liver at 15 and 50 mg/kg/week, which reversed in females but not in 
males after a 2-month treatment-free period. Additional histopathology findings included lymphoid 
hyperplasia in the spleen and mesenteric lymph node, which was observed at all dose levels. Again, 
these changes were considered consistent with the primary pharmacodynamics of tremelimumab and 
reversed or showed a trend towards reversal after a 2-month treatment-free period. Based on the 
above findings, the 5 mg/kg/week dose was considered to be the NOAEL and the 50 mg/kg/week dose 
was considered to be the highest non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD) for tremelimumab in this study. 
6-month i.v toxicity study in cynomolgus monkey (study 2004-0150, GLP) 
The 6 month repeat-dose toxicity study was performed in compliance with GLP as a multi-site study 
with Pfizer, Kalamazoo, MI, USA as the primary site. Test formulation and analysis was performed at 
Pfizer, Chesterfield, MO. Plasma analysis at Pfizer, Richmond, VA, ADA analysis and TK, immune-
phenotyping were performed at Pfizer Groton, CT and finally the ECG analysis by an associate 
professor at Michigan University, East Lansing, MI, USA. The quality assurance statement includes 
dates of audits/inspections which cover from draft protocol across in-life phases to ECG, necropsy and 
study reporting. Individual quality assurance statement was provided for bioanalysis, toxicokinetics, 
immunophenotyping and ADA reports. No quality assurance statement was associated with the report 
of analysis of the dosing solutions. 
The plasma concentration of tremelimumab collected from the control group animals at 0.5-hour post-
dose on treatment Days 1, 29 and 176 and recovery Day 99 were less than the LLOQ (0.156 μg/mL). 
Cynomolgus monkeys were administered a solution of tremelimumab in vehicle intravenously at doses 
of 5, 15, and 50 mg/kg/week for 6 months (the same dose levels as in the 1-month study).  
Six monkeys/sex were assigned to the 0 (control) and 50 mg/kg/week groups (with 4 monkeys/sex 
designated as main study monkeys and 2 monkeys/sex designated as recovery-phase monkeys). Four 
monkeys/sex were assigned to the 5 and 15 mg/kg/week groups (no recovery-phase monkeys). 
Dosing had to be suspended in the high dose group already after 6 or 7 weeks due to persistent 
diarrhoea and what seems to be rather severe adverse skin conditions. Several of the animals failed to 
improve after suspension of dosing and had to be euthanised despite supportive treatment of fluids, 
snacks, benadryl and prednisolone. On Day 79, the remaining 50 mg/kg/week monkeys (2/sex) and 
the control monkeys originally designated as recovery monkeys (2/sex) were placed in a newly 
designated 99-day recovery phase. Mortality was observed in the low dose group, which were not 
associated with treatment (broken forearm and peracute diarrhoea due to acute infection). 
As expected from the pharmacodynamic effects of tremelimumab, changes were observed in 
hematological, immunophenotyping and clinical chemistry endpoints, such as increased numbers of 
white blood cells and lymphocytes and slightly decreased A/G ratio.

A decrease in thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) in combination with increased TSH was observed in one 
male and 1 female in each of the mid and high dose. These changes correlated with moderate to 
marked thyroid atrophy as observed microscopically at day 170 at the mid dose and at Day 42 at the 
high dose. Immune mediated hypothyroidism was observed in clinical trials. In section 4.4 in SmPC a 
recommendation of monitoring for abnormal thyroid function. Hypothyroidism is classified as a very 
common adverse effect (13.3%) in section 4.8 of SmPC. 
Tremelimumab-related histologic findings were generally consistent with the intended pharmacology of 
increased immune reactivity. All treated groups had a dose-related increase in the incidence of 
mononuclear cell infiltration and mononuclear cell inflammation in numerous organs apart from skin 
and intestinal system in which adverse effects were obvious by clinical signs.  
Dose-related mononuclear cell infiltration was present in the cecum, colon, skin, brain (choroid 
plexus), oesophagus, eye (conjunctiva), heart, liver (periportal area), kidney, skeletal muscle, 
pancreas (acinar), parathyroid, pituitary, prostate, salivary gland, thyroid, tongue and uterus of the 5, 
15, and 50 mg/kg/week groups.  
Histological evaluation of the recovery animals showed minimal inflammation of salivary gland (1/4 
animals) and skin (3/4 animals).  
NOAEL was not determined based on clinical observations that required supportive care (prednisolone, 
benadryl, IV or gavage fluids, snacks) in the 5 mg/kg/week and 50 mg/kg/week groups and 
mononuclear cell inflammation in the kidney, skin and salivary gland of all tremelimumab-treated 
groups. Exposure to tremelimumab, assessed by mean Cmax and AUC values, was largely maintained 
throughout the dosing phase despite antidrug antibodies in individual animals and there were no 
consistent gender differences in mean exposure. The maximum tolerated dose was considered to be 15 
mg/kg/week. At 15 mg/kg/week on Day 176 the combined-sex Cmax and AUCDay1-30 means were 444 
μg/mL and 212000 μg•h/mL, respectively. This is much higher than Cmax of 100 µg/ml and AUC0-28days 
of 19104 µg/mL*h in patients after a single dose of 300 mg. Exposure at 5 mg/kg/week was also 5 
times higher than in patients indicating that the dose setting in this study was too high. Mean AUC1-
30days was 94700 µg/mL*h in the monkey. AUC0-28days in patients was 19104 µg/mL*h. Hence, exposure 
margin to the lowest dose was (94700/30)/(19104/28) = ~ 5. Nevertheless, the majority of the 
findings appeared to be clinically relevant, even the palliative treatment of corticosteroids in the most 
affected animals. 
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
No genotoxicity studies were conducted with tremelimumab. 
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were conducted with tremelimumab. 
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Tremelimumab potential for influencing fertility and early embryonic development was not evaluated. 
In the 6 months toxicity study (Study 2004-0150; GLP), mammary gland, uterus, vagina, oviduct, 
cervix, ovary, epididymides, prostate, seminal vesicle and testes were included in the list of organs 
subjected to histopathology on Day 177, where the low and mid dose animals had been dosed weekly 
up until sacrifice and the high dose animals had been off dosing for 99 days. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17771/2023  
Page 39/176 
 
 
 
As for the male reproductive organs, mononuclear cell inflammation/infiltration was observed as 
minimal or mild in seminal vesicle (1/4 in High dose), testes (1/4 in Low dose and Mid dose with 1/4 
with mild inflammation in the high dose), epididymides (1/4 in control, 1/4 in Low dose, 1/4 in Mid 
dose and 2/4 in High dose). Prostate was more affected in incidence and severity compared to the 
other male reproductive organs, as one of the four high dose animals also showed moderate 
mononuclear cell inflammation. 
As for the female reproductive organs, mononuclear cell inflammation/infiltration was observed as 
minimal or mild in uterus (0/4 in control, 3/4 in low dose, 1/4 in mid dose and 3/4 in high dose). In 
vagina, this finding was dose related in incidence and severity and was found to be moderate in 1/4 in 
mid dose and 2/4 in the high dose. In mammary gland, mononuclear infiltration was mild in 1/4 in low 
and mid dose and mononuclear inflammation was present in the 3/4 of the high dose animals with one 
classified as moderate. Other findings were only present in one animal and is considered incidental. 
The embryofoetal development study of tremelimumab was a multisite study performed with Covance, 
Münster, Germany as the primary site with a comprehensive audit programme covering most phases of 
the study (2501-001). Analysis of a stock solution took place at Covance using UV absorbance. 
Bioanalysis (GLP) was conducted at Nerviano Medical Sciences, Italy and toxicokinetics (GLP) at Pfizer, 
Groton, CT. ADA analysis was decided not to be performed, since the pharmacokinetics appeared to be 
minimally affected by possible neutralising antibodies towards tremelimumab. Moreover, exposure was 
dose-related and similar to the repeat-dose toxicity studies. 
In this study, the animals were dosed once weekly with tremelimumab from day 20 to 50 of gestation 
(e.g. on days 20, 27, 34, 41, and 48 of gestation) at dose levels of 0, 5, 15 or 30 mg/kg/week. 
Toxicokinetic samples were collected: days 20 and 48 of gestation: predose, and at approximately 0.5, 
8, and 24 hours post-dose and days 27, 34, and 41, of gestation: predose and at approximately 0.5 
hours post-dose, hence exposure was well-covered throughout the study. 
All animals were observed once daily for behaviour and appearance. A second examination was 
performed on all animals later in the day as a cage side observation, including another faeces 
evaluation. Additionally, a detailed fur examination was performed at weekly intervals for each 
individual animal. 
The only clinical signs assigned to treatment was slight dose-related increase in the incidence of days 
with diarrhoea. 
Foetuses were delivered via Caesarean section and euthanised on day 100 ± 1 of gestation, followed 
by examination for weight, external, visceral, and skeletal abnormalities, and weights of selected 
organs. Placentae were examined for weight and gross appearance. 
There was no effect of treatment on the incidence of prenatal loss. There were no treatment-related 
changes in foetal body or organ weights, foetal body measurements, or placental weights among the 
live foetuses. External and visceral examination revealed several minor findings in foetuses of all 
groups including the control group. Type, frequency and pattern of those findings did not show any 
dose-relationship. 
Hence, there were no signs of tremelimumab having adverse effects on the outcome of pregnancy and 
embryofoetal development at doses up to 30 mg/kg/week during pregnancy (GD20 to GD48) in the 
monkey providing sufficient margin of exposure. 
A pre- and postnatal development study (PPND) study was not performed.  
Studies in juvenile animals were not performed.

2.5.4.7.  Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance was assessed in both single and repeat-dose toxicity studies. When changes were 
observed, these were considered procedurally related and similar in incidence and severity between 
control and tremelimumab dosed animals. 
2.5.4.8.  Other toxicity studies 
Tissue cross reactivity 
Tissue cross reactivity studies of tissue binding of a fluorosceinated version of tremelimumab to 
cynomolgus monkey and human tissues was presented in reports IM645 and IM676. The studies were 
conducted according to GLP at Pathology Associates, a Charles River Company, Maryland, USA. The 
range of tissue was sufficiently broad and covered tissues of vital organs such organs of reproduction, 
heart and lung apart from expected target organs of gastrointestinal system, thymus, pancreas and 
lymph system. Human lymphocytes and human cerebellum tissue were used as positive and negative 
control, respectively. 
The tissue binding profile of the two species was remarkably similar. The tissues binding tremelimumab 
were tonsils, lymphocytes in stomach, colon, spleen, lymph nodes and thymus in monkey. In human 
tissues it was tonsils, lymph nodes, thymus, lymphocytes in spleen, colon and small intestine with low 
binding in 1 out of three donors of thyroid. Tissue binding correlates with expected pharmacological 
effect and adverse findings in the monkey and adverse effects in patients. 
Antigenicity 
Tremelimumab did give rise to antidrug antibodies in the monkeys, however with limited impact on 
exposure. Only few animals showed decreasing exposure over time due to neutralising antidrug 
antibodies. This seems to be the case in patients as well, where 12.1% tested positive for ADAs and 
10.0% for neutralising ADAs. The presence of ADAs did not impact tremelimumab pharmacokinetics, 
and there was no apparent effect on efficacy and safety (SmPC). 
Immunotoxicity 
Tremelimumab is a product, which enhance the reactivity of the immune system by inhibiting one of 
the down-regulating functions (CTLA4). This gives rise to general inflammation (in essence 
autoimmune reactions) in a range of organs - most severely in the intestinal system and skin as 
observed from clinical signs in the monkey. The increase in general inflammation seems to be well 
documented in the studies in cynomolgus monkeys also on the cellular level but may be less obvious in 
the patient population in which leucopenia and neutropenia are very common adverse effects. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Tremelimumab is a protein, which is expected to biodegrade in the environment and not be a 
significant risk to the environment. Thus, according to the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk 
Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), tremelimumab is 
exempt from preparation of an Environmental Risk Assessment as the product and excipients do not 
pose a significant risk to the environment. 
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17771/2023  
Page 42/176 
 
 
 
It is acknowledged that tremelimumab inhibits CTLA4 and thereby activate T cells. A range of both in 
vitro, in vivo pharmacology and repeat-dose toxicity studies documents this effect, which in vivo 
translates into severe systemic inflammation and mortality after repeat-dosing. However, the lack of 
effects on Tregs ability to dampen IFN-γ production by activated T cells is a concern. According to e.g. 
Ohue, 2019, Tregs may be part of cancer tumours microenvironment to enhance tumour immunity 
providing a possibility for evading the activated T cells.  
To further explain this trait of tremelimumab not targeting the intratumoral Tregs limiting its efficacy in 
cancer treatment, a scientific discussion was provided. Depletion of Tregs is dependent on ADCC of 
which tremelimumab is not capable mainly due to lack of FcR affinity. Selby et al. demonstrated that in 
mouse tumour models surrogate antibodies with higher affinity for FcR showed both the ability of 
depleting Tregs and enhanced antitumour activity.  
There is a difference in affinity of IgG isotypes for FcR between mouse and human. IgG2a is a mouse 
isotype, with relatively potent Fc binding properties and is broadly equivalent to human IgG1. 
Additionally, human IgG2 (such as tremelimumab) has very minimal Fc binding properties and is 
broadly equivalent to mouse IgG1 (as used in the in vivo studies described below) (Stewart et al 
2014).  
This discrepancy between nonclinical and clinical findings could be summarised as translational 
challenges associated with: 1) differences between IgG isotypes across species; 2) type of effector 
cells infiltrated in tumour and expression of different FcγRs on the surface between mouse and human; 
3) varying CTLA-4 expression level on Tregs.  
To conclude, tremelimumab is not capable of performing ADCC and therefore does not reduce Tregs 
number. In the context of immune related adverse events, that property is desirable, but intratumoral 
Tregs might be potential target for more efficient therapy because reducing Tregs inside tumours is 
associated with superior antitumour activity. Tremelimumab achieves its effect by targeting CTLA-4 on 
activated effector T cells and should be administered in combination with anti-PD-L1 antibody. Results 
from nonclinical studies showed that combination is superior to monotherapy with tremelimumab in 
cancer treatment, but similar to anti-PD-L1 monotherapy. Totality of data suggest that not affecting 
Tregs might be the reason for weaker efficacy of tremelimumab. 
Key in vitro and in vivo studies highlight applicant´s statement that tremelimumab is not capable of 
affecting Tregs, however, the absence might be associated with weaker clinical outcomes and 
questionable contribution of tremelimumab in antitumour efficacy. 
This deficiency might also explain the modest effect in the in vivo mouse cancer models.  
Despite the principle of abrogating the T-cell inhibition was studied in vitro as well as in vivo, different 
results have been obtained from different animal disease models. A proof of principle specific for the 
tumour type included in the indication was not demonstrated. Thus, the relevance for the current 
proposed indication, uHCC, was not provided. According to e.g. Chulpanova et al 2020, the syngeneic 
mouse tumour models lack the complexity of the tumour microenvironment observed in patients, 
hence the translational value of the mouse model is questionable.  
Pharmacokinetics 
As expected for a monoclonal antibody, volume of distribution is mostly confined to the vascular space 
as the volume of distribution in monkey demonstrate (Vss = 54 mL/kg). The major elimination 
pathway of tremelimumab is expected to be through protein catabolism. Pharmacokinetic drug-drug 
interactions of tremelimumab with other therapeutics are not anticipated. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17771/2023  
Page 43/176 
 
 
 
 
The pharmacokinetics of tremelimumab appear to be independent of dose and providing a linear 
relation between exposure and dose within the dose range tested (0.75 to 100 mg/kg), which also is 
the case in humans over the dose range of 1 to 20 mg/kg.  
Antidrug antibodies (ADAs) were observed in several animals during the repeat-dose toxicology studies 
and in some cases appeared to increase clearance. However, the overall exposure was deemed 
sufficient securing the validity of the studies. 
Toxicology 
Repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  were  conducted  in  monkeys  of  1-  or  6-  months duration.  In  the  1-mont 
study  findings  were  consistent  with  tremelimumab  pharmacology  by  inducing  inflammation  but  not 
severe.  
In the chronic 6-month study in cynomolgus monkeys, treatment with tremelimumab was associated 
with dose-related incidence in persistent diarrhoea and skin rash, scabs and open sores, which were 
dose-limiting. These clinical signs were also associated with decreased appetite and body weight and 
swollen peripheral lymph nodes. Histopathological findings correlating with the observed clinical signs 
included reversible chronic inflammation in the cecum and colon, and mononuclear cell infiltration in 
the skin and hyperplasia in lymphoid tissues. A dose-dependent increase in the incidence and severity 
of mononuclear cell infiltration with or without mononuclear cell inflammation was observed in the 
salivary gland, pancreas (acinar), thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal, heart, oesophagus, tongue, periportal 
liver area, skeletal muscle, prostate, uterus, pituitary, eye (conjunctiva, extra ocular muscles), and 
choroid plexus of the brain. No NOAEL was found in this study with animals treated with the lowest 
dose of 5 mg/kg/week requiring supportive care. This dose provided an exposure-based safety margin 
of 1-2 to clinically relevant exposure (taking species difference in potency into account). 
Mononuclear cell infiltration in prostate and uterus was observed in repeat dose toxicity studies. Since 
animal fertility studies have not been conducted with tremelimumab, the clinical relevance of these 
findings for fertility is unknown. In reproduction studies, administration of tremelimumab to pregnant 
Cynomolgus monkeys during the period of organogenesis was not associated with maternal toxicity or 
effects pregnancy losses, foetal weights, or external, visceral, skeletal abnormalities or weights of 
selected foetal organs. 
Tremelimumab potential for influencing fertility and early embryonic development was not evaluated or 
discussed by the applicant. According to ICH S9, effects on reproductive organs from the repeat-dose 
toxicity studies can make the basis for this evaluation. 
Pre- and postnatal development studies were not performed, and this is acceptable and in line with ICH 
S9.  
No studies in juvenile animals were performed, and this is acceptable since the sought indication is 
only including adult patents.  
Tremelimumab  was  not  evaluated  for  genotoxic  potential,  and  this  is  acceptable  for  a  monoclonal 
antibody. Carcinogenic potential of tremelimumab was not evaluated, and this is acceptable given the 
indication sought in the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC). 
RMP 
The findings observed in the pivotal repeat-dose general toxicity studies of inflammation in cecum, 
colon and skin were also observed in patients. Moreover, clinical chemistry findings in patients and 
monkeys related to liver toxicity correlated to histological changes. As for toxicity to reproduction, it is 
acknowledged that the EFD study in monkeys did not give rise to concerns. However, inflammatory

markers were present in organs of reproduction of both male and female animals even after 99 days of 
recovery.

a For Study 06, an NCA was done for an interim dataset (DCO 28 February 2017). As the final dataset (DCO 19 
November 2019) only had 343 additional samples (all in the dose-expansion phase) compared to the interim, it was 
determined that an additional NCA for the final dataset was not required. This was supported by the sparse 
sampling in the dose-expansion phase patients (~2 samples per patient per treatment), which would contribute 
little to no value to a NCA, which typically relies on intense sampling in order to accurately estimate key PK 
parameters such as half-life and AUC. Therefore, only the results of the interim NCA are presented.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Tremelimumab and durvalumab are human monoclonal antibodies (mAb) that act as checkpoint 
inhibitors with distinct yet complementary mechanisms of action with respect to enhancing the 
antitumour immune response.  
In 2018 durvalumab (Imfinzi) was approved in the EU as monotherapy for the treatment of locally 
advanced, unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 on 
≥ 1% of tumour cells and whose disease has not progressed following platinum based chemoradiation 
therapy 
The applicant is currently seeking marketing approval for the use of a single priming dose of 
tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab for the treatment of patients with unresectable 
hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC).

Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to treatment with one of the following 4 treatment arms: 
- durvalumab 1500 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) (D) 
- tremelimumab 300 mg × 1 dose + durvalumab 1500 mg Q4W (T300 + D) 
- tremelimumab 75 mg Q4W × 4 doses + durvalumab 1500 mg Q4W (T75 + D) 
- sorafenib 400 mg twice daily (BID) (S) 
Patients were stratified according to macrovascular invasion (yes or no), etiology of liver disease 
(confirmed HBV vs confirmed HCV vs others), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) PS (0 
vs 1). 
The study population included adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with confirmed uHCC (based on 
histopathology) with preserved liver function (Child-Pugh Score class A), Barcelona Clinic 
Liver Cancer stage B (not eligible for locoregional therapy) or C, ECOG PS score of 0 or 1, with a life-
expectancy of ˃ 12 weeks, and no prior systemic therapy for uHCC. A total of 1324 patients were 
randomised to one of the four treatment arms in the study. 
Tremelimumab PK Results and Conclusions 
Tremelimumab PK data were available for a total of 528 patients (386 in the T300 + D arm and 142 in 
the T75 + D arm). Eighteen patients were excluded from the tremelimumab PK Analysis Set either 
because they did not receive study treatment or because they had no post-dose data.  
No formal noncompartmental analysis was conducted due to the sparse PK sampling scheme in this 
study. 
Following a single dose of tremelimumab 300 mg plus durvalumab Q4W, geometric mean 
concentrations (n, geometric CV%) were: Cycle 2 trough = 10.7 μg/mL (221, 84.7%) and follow up (3 
months) = 0.5 μg/mL (55, 140.4%) (Table 2).  
Tremelimumab PK concentrations were within the expected exposure range following a single 300 mg 
dose. 
Following tremelimumab 75 mg Q4W in combination with durvalumab Q4W, geometric mean 
concentrations (n, geometric CV%) were: Cycle 2 trough = 3.2 μg/mL (132, 67.8%); Cycle 4 trough = 
4.3 μg/mL (86, 85.4%); and follow-up (3 months) = 0.4 μg/mL (30, 106.1%) (Table 3:).  
Tremelimumab PK concentrations were within the expected exposure range following 75 mg Q4W.  
Overall, trough concentrations of tremelimumab at Cycle 2 were 3.3 times higher in the T300 + D arm 
than the T75 + D arm. In addition, similar tremelimumab exposures were observed in patients 
rechallenged with tremelimumab.

Tremelimumab PK Results and Conclusions 
In Parts 2 and 3 of the study, the PK Analysis Set comprised 319 patients (99 in the D arm,74 in the 
T300 + D arm, 66 in the T arm, and 80 in the T75 + D arm). At the final data cutoff (DCO), 603 PK 
data points from the evaluable PK population were available for a total of 216 patients following 
tremelimumab administered over 60 minutes (1 mg/kg: 81 data points from 36 patients; 10 mg/kg: 
94 data points from 33 patients; 75 mg: 134 data points from 43 patients; 300 mg: 187 data points 
from 72 patients; and 750 mg: 107 data points from 32 patients). 
Table 4 summarises the tremelimumab data.

Similar exposures were observed following the weight-based 1 mg/kg and the equivalent fixed 75 mg 
dose. Additionally, similar exposures were observed following the weight-based 10 mg/kg and the 
equivalent fixed 750 mg dose. 
Maximum serum concentration (Cmax) values were 3.3-fold (arithmetic mean) or 3.7-fold (geometric 
mean) higher following a 300 mg dose compared to a 75 mg dose. Exposures increased generally 
dose-proportionally with increasing weight-based doses from 1 to 10 mg/kg and fixed doses from 75 to 
750 mg, respectively. 
The data in Error! Reference source not found. above show that there was no observed 
accumulation of tremelimumab (Cmax or trough serum concentration [Ctrough]) following repeated dosing 
in any of the cohorts and the geometric mean of the accumulation index ranged from 0.949 to 1.17, 
where adequate data were available for assessment. The Cmax (geometric mean) for tremelimumab in 
the T300 + D arm was approximately 3.7 times that in the T75 + D arm. 
Dose rationale for tremelimumab and durvalumab in HIMALAYA 
Dose selection for tremelimumab and durvalumab in HIMALAYA was aligned with results from the 
dose-finding results of Study 22, in which 1500 mg durvalumab Q4W was administered in combination 
with tremelimumab for 4 cycles followed by durvalumab 1500 mg Q4W monotherapy. 
A fixed dose of tremelimumab 75 mg Q4W (equivalent to 1 mg/kg Q4W for an average body weight of 
75 kg) is predicted to result in similar AUC and only provide a modest difference in median peak and 
trough levels at steady state compared to tremelimumab 1 mg/kg Q4W, based on simulations in a 
Population PK model developed for tremelimumab using data from Study 10, Japan Study 02, Study 
06, BASKET, DETERMINE, and POSEIDON. The Population PK model indicated that body weight is not a 
significant covariate on the PK of tremelimumab. 
Administration of tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab has demonstrated significant 
elevations in proliferating CD4 + Ki67 + T cell quantities (Study 06 and Study 10). These elevations 
were proportional to the tremelimumab dose (Study 06). A dose of tremelimumab 1 mg/kg Q4W in 
combination with durvalumab 15 or 20 mg/kg Q4W was sufficient to achieve the significant elevation in

proliferating T cell quantities. It was hypothesised that a single high-dose of tremelimumab may 
provide a stronger pharmacodynamic effect in uHCC than tremelimumab 1 mg/kg, while potentially 
avoiding the toxicity typically observed with repeated cycles of tremelimumab administration. This led 
to the proposal of evaluating a higher dose of tremelimumab in uHCC, achieved by combining the 4 
doses of tremelimumab 1 mg/kg from the T75 + D regimen into a single priming dose of 
tremelimumab 4 mg/kg added to the first treatment cycle of durvalumab 20 mg/kg Q4W. Based on PK 
simulations, the predicted Cmax for a single dose of tremelimumab 4 mg/kg was approximately 3- to 4-
fold higher than the predicted Cmax for tremelimumab 1 mg/kg (compared to any of the 4 
tremelimumab doses in the T75 + D regimen). Based on the expectation of minor impact of body 
weight on PK exposure, a fixed dose of tremelimumab 300 mg was considered equivalent to 
tremelimumab 4 mg/kg. In Study 22, pharmacodynamic results revealed that patients receiving T300 
+ D or T demonstrated the highest peak CD8 + Ki67 + T cell counts, and this corresponded with best 
overall responses of complete or partial response. 
HIMALAYA results confirmed that durvalumab 1500 mg Q4W with tremelimumab 300 mg as a priming 
dose followed by durvalumab 1500 mg Q4W monotherapy is an appropriate dose for patients with 
uHCC by showing a clinically meaningful efficacy and manageable safety profile following this dosing 
regimen. 
Bioanalytical Methods 
Bioanalysis methods for quantitation of tremelimumab drug concentration, anti-drug antibodies (ADA), 
and neutralizing antibodies (nAb) were developed and validated. 
Population PK analyses for tremelimumab and durvalumab 
The tremelimumab population PK analysis was updated with sparse data from Study 22 and HIMALAYA 
in HCC patients and pooled with the previous dataset (Studies D4190C00002, D4190C00006, 
D4190C00010, DETERMINE, BASKET and POSEIDON). 7039 serum PK samples from 2406 patients 
administered tremelimumab were available in the final dataset for analysis of which 1801 samples 
came from HCC patients. Structurally, the final model remained the same as the previous model: a 2-
compartment model with linear CL and an additional time-dependent CL component for patients on 
combination therapy only. Residuals were described by a combined additive and proportional error 
model. The following covariates were identified as statistically significant and included in the final 
model: body weight and sex on both CL and V1; albumin, primary indication and combination therapy 
(chemotherapy vs. no chemotherapy) on CL. 
The final model was evaluated by means of non-parametric bootstrap analysis, RSEs, GOF-plots and 
pcVPCs. 
Parameter estimates of the final model for tremelimumab and selected diagnostic plots are shown in 
Table 5 and Figure 2 and Figure 3.

The final model included the following covariate effects on CL: WT, ALB, combination therapy, sex, CrCL,

Tremelimumab & durvalumab exposure-response modelling analyses 
The ER analysis for both efficacy and safety was based on patients from HIMALAYA study administered 
1500 mg Q4W durvalumab and a 300 mg single dose tremelimumab IV. 388 and 397 patients were 
included in the ER analysis for durvalumab and tremelimumab, respectively. The final 
durvalumab/tremelimumab PopPK models were used to obtains EBEs of individual PK parameters.  
Exposure-efficacy: 
The exposure-efficacy relationships in the HIMALAYA study were explored by Kaplan-Meier plots 
stratified by durvalumab and tremelimumab exposure quartiles. Several exposure metrics for 
tremelimumab and durvalumab were derived. For both efficacy outcomes, OS and PFS, Cox 
Proportional Hazard (CPH) models were developed and a stepwise covariate selection was performed 
(α = 1% and 0.1%). No significant exposure-efficacy relationships were identified for durvalumab or 
tremelimumab. The CPH models for OS suggested that AST and NLR were associated with shorter 
survival in T300+D arm as they were identified as statistically significant covariates. Maximum 
concentration following the first dose (Cmax, dose 1) for tremelimumab was also identified as a 
marginally statistically significant exposure metric (LRT: 11.92 > 10.83) but was removed due to non-
significance in the Wald test (p = 0.199), the standard error of coefficient (β) being large and the 95% 
CI of β containing the null. Likewise, trough concentration following the first dose (Cmin, dose 1) for 
tremelimumab was also identified as a marginally significant covariate within PFS based on the LRT but 
was removed for the same reasons. No other covariates were identified to be significant with PFS.  
Exposure-safety: 
Logistic regression modelling did not identify any significant impact of durvalumab or tremelimumab 
exposure on the incidence of investigated adverse effects.

QTcF modelling analysis 
Linear mixed-effects exposure-response modelling with an intercept was conducted to characterise the 
relationship of change from baseline of QTcF (ΔQTcF) with durvalumab or tremelimumab serum 
concentrations. The concentration-ΔQTcF analysis population consisted of 293 observations from 67 
patients administered durvalumab and 254 observations from 66 patients administered tremelimumab 
from Study 06. Unscheduled concentration-QTcF observations and non-central ECG records were 
excluded from the analysis.  
For durvalumab, the slope for the relationship of ΔQTcF to durvalumab concentration was 0.0048 ms 
per μg/mL (p = 0.112), with a mean intercept of 0.082 ms (p = 0.950; 90% CI: -2.07, 2.24 ms; Table 
). 
The slope for the relationship of ΔQTcF to tremelimumab concentration was -0.012 ms per μg/mL (p = 
0.531), and the mean intercept was 0.581 ms (p = 0.629; 90% CI: -1.41, 2.57 ms; Table ). 
The slope or the intercept for tremelimumab and durvalumab were not significantly different from zero.  
Table 7: Parameter estimates of durvalumab PK – ∆QTcF relationship 
Table 8: Parameter estimates of tremelimumab PK – ∆QTcF relationship 
The  upper  bound  of  the  90%  2-sided  CI  for  ΔQTcF  was  less  than  10  ms,  and  the  highest  observed 
concentration of durvalumab and tremelimumab had a predicted mean ΔQTcF of less than 5 ms (Figure 
6, Figure 7 and Table 8).

Study 22 evaluated PK parameters in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, who received a 
single IV dose of 300 mg on Day 1. In a subset of patients from this study (N=11) for whom intensive 
PK sampling was done, the estimated geometric mean volume of distribution was 7.6 L (Table ).  
Based on population PK analysis that included 1605 patients who received tremelimumab monotherapy 
or in combination with durvalumab with or without chemotherapy in the dose range of ≥ 1 mg/kg, the 
geometric mean steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) was 6.33 L.

Elimination 
Tremelimumab, as a typical mAb, is not cleared renally due to its large molecular weight. The primary 
elimination pathways are protein catabolism via the reticuloendothelial system (RES) or target-
mediated disposition. 
Based on the findings from the subset of patients from Study 22, for whom intensive PK sampling was 
done, the geometric mean clearance was 0.21 L/day and the apparent terminal half-life was 25.1 days 
(Table ). 
Based on population PK analysis, the geometric mean steady-state clearance (CLss) was 0.309 L/day 
and the geometric mean terminal half-life was approximately 14.2 days.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In a dose finding study conducted in patients with NSCLC (Study 06) an approximately dose-
proportional increase in PK exposure (Cmax and AUC0-28) of tremelimumab was observed over the dose 
range of 1 to 10 mg/kg tremelimumab Q4W when administered in combination with durvalumab (Table  
above).  
Exposure following multiple doses demonstrated accumulation consistent with PK parameters 
estimated from the first dose. The PK profile for tremelimumab is shown in Figure 8.

Intra- and inter-individual variability 
For the tremelimumab population PK model, estimates of inter-individual variability (CV%) were 32.9% 
on CL, 24.9% on V1, 46.0% on V2 and 119.2% on Tmax.   
For the durvalumab population PK model, estimates of inter-individual variability (CV%) were 29.9% 
on CL, 22.9% on V1 and 25.8% on Tmax. 
Special populations 
The effect of intrinsic factors (i.e., renal function, hepatic function, age, race, gender, and body 
weight) on the PK of tremelimumab has not been studied through specific dedicated studies.  
The effect of body weight, age, gender, race, renal and hepatic function and disease severity on the PK 
of tremelimumab has, however, been evaluated in the Population PK analysis.  
In summary, the final Population PK modeling indicated that the baseline patient characteristics of age, 
race, renal function, and hepatic function had no effect on the PK of tremelimumab. In contrast, body 
weight, ALB, gender, combination therapy and primary indication had a statistically significant impact 
on clearance. Body weight and sex had a statistically significant impact on central volume of 
distribution. However, all identified covariates changed tremelimumab population parameter estimates 
by less than or about 20% and were therefore regarded of minor clinical relevance. 
Impaired renal function 
Mild (creatinine clearance (CrCL) 60 to 89 ml/min) and moderate renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance (CrCL) 30 to 59 ml/min) had no clinically significant effect on the PK of tremelimumab. The 
effect of severe renal impairment (CrCL 15 to 29 ml/min) on the PK of tremelimumab is unknown. 
Impaired hepatic function 
Mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or bilirubin > 1.0 to 1.5 × ULN and any AST) 
and moderate hepatic impairment (bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 x ULN and any AST) had no clinically significant 
effect on the PK of tremelimumab. The effect of severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin > 3.0 x ULN and 
any AST) on the PK of tremelimumab is unknown.  
Gender  
Based on the final PopPK model of tremelimumab, gender had a statistically significant impact on CL 
and V1. However, since the impact was less than 20% this was not regarded as of clinical relevance. 
Age 
Age (range 18 to 87 years) was not identified as a significant covariate in the final PopPK model of 
tremelimumab.

Race 
Race was not identified as a significant covariate in the final Population PK model of tremelimumab, 
and race did not seem to influence PK of tremelimumab. . 
Weight 
Body weight (range 34 to 149 kg) had a statistically significant effect on CL and V1. However, since 
body weight changed tremelimumab population parameter estimates by less than 20% it was regarded 
of minor clinical relevance.  
Table  shows the simulated tremelimumab AUC, Cmax, and Cmin across body weight quartiles. At the 
highest weight quartile, the simulated geometric mean AUC, Cmax, and Cmin decreased by 7.67%, 
11.8%, and 8.88%, respectively, compared to the geometric mean of the overall population. At the 
lowest quartile, the simulated AUC, Cmax, and Cmin increased by 7.73%, 14.5%, and 7.89%, 
respectively, compared to the mean of the overall population. These differences in exposure were not 
considered clinically relevant but due to the potential concern the weight limit for body weight-based 
dosing has been increased to 40 kg.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with durvalumab or tremelimumab. PK 
drug-drug interaction of durvalumab or tremelimumab with other therapeutics is not anticipated given 
that durvalumab and tremelimumab are not primarily cleared via hepatic or renal pathways; instead, 
the primary elimination pathways are protein catabolism via reticuloendothelial system (RES) or 
target-mediated disposition.  
Durvalumab and tremelimumab are not expected to induce or inhibit the major drug metabolizing 
cytochrome P450 pathways.

Immunogenicity 
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. Immunogenicity of 
tremelimumab is based on pooled data in 2075 patients who were treated with tremelimumab 75 mg 
or 1 mg/kg and evaluable for the presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). Two-hundred fifty-two 
patients (12.1%) tested positive for treatment-emergent ADAs. Neutralising antibodies against 
tremelimumab were detected in 10.0% (208/2075) patients. The presence of ADAs did not impact 
tremelimumab pharmacokinetics, and there was no apparent effect on efficacy and safety. 
In the HIMALAYA study, of the 182 patients who were treated with Imjudo 300 mg as a single dose in 
combination with durvalumab and evaluable for the presence of ADAs against tremelimumab, 20 
(11.0%) patients tested positive for treatment-emergent ADAs. Neutralising antibodies against 
tremelimumab were detected in 4.4% (8/182) patients. The presence of ADAs did not have an 
apparent effect on pharmacokinetics or safety. 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Tremelimumab is a human IgG2 mAb directed against cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 
(CTLA-4). CTLA-4 is a critical regulatory signal for T-cell expansion and activation following an immune 
response, and it serves as a natural braking mechanism that maintains T-cell homeostasis. During T-
cell activation, T cells upregulate CTLA-4, which binds to CD80 and CD86 ligands on antigen-presenting 
cells, sending an inhibitory signal and preventing CD28-mediated T-cell co-stimulation, thus limiting T-
cell activation. Tremelimumab blocks these events, leading to prolongation and enhancement of T-cell 
activation and expansion. 
Durvalumab is a human IgG1k mAb that binds to programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) and blocks 
the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80 (B7.1). Expression of PD-L1 can be induced by 
inflammatory signals and can be expressed on both tumour cells and tumour-associated immune cells 
in the tumour microenvironment. PD-L1 blocks T-cell function and activation through interactions with 
PD-1 and CD80 (B7.1). By binding to its receptors PD-L1 reduces cytotoxic T-cell activity, proliferation, 
and cytokine production. Blockade of PD-L1/PD-1 and PD-L1/CD80 interactions releases the inhibition 
of immune responses, without inducing antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). 
Tremelimumab and durvalumab are checkpoint inhibitors with distinct yet complementary mechanisms 
of action with respect to enhancing the antitumour immune response. Tremelimumab mediated 
blockade of CTLA-4 functions early in the immune response, lowering the threshold for T cell 
activation, allowing more T cells to be activated and increasing the diversity of the T cell population. 
This increases the probability that a T cell recognizing a tumour neoantigen can become activated. 
Durvalumab blockade of PD-L1 is expected to function mainly during the effector phase of T cell 
function, once T cells enter the tumour, where it acts to block local suppression of T-cell function by 
PD-L1, enhancing the ability of activated anti-tumour T cells to target and kill tumour cells. 
Primary pharmacology  
Data from Study 06, Study 10 and Study 22 indicate that a pharmacodynamic effect exists on 
proliferating CD4+ and CD8+ T cell quantities consistent with the proposed mechanisms of action of 
both therapeutic agents.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17771/2023  
Page 72/176 
 
 
 
Data from Study 1108, Japan Study 02, Study 06 and Study 10 indicate that durvalumab treatment 
(with or without tremelimumab) reduces free Soluble Programmed Cell Death Ligand-1 (sPD-L1) in 
serum. 
No PD biomarkers are proposed for monitoring of effect. 
Secondary pharmacology 
Concentration-QTc Analysis 
Overall, concentration-QTc-analysis did not identify a significant linear relationship between 
tremelimumab or durvalumab serum concentrations and ΔQTcF. The predicted mean ΔQTcF and upper 
90% CI at the maximum observed concentration for tremelimumab or durvalumab in the dataset were 
below the threshold of clinical concern. 
Exposure-response relationships 
Assessment of an exposure-efficacy relationship was conducted using OS and PFS as efficacy 
parameters in patients from HIMALAYA, for whom the different exposure metrics could be calculated. 
For the exposure-response analysis for efficacy (OS and PFS), only the T300 + D cohort was used, but 
with the SoC cohort as a comparator in some of the analyses. The exposure-response Cox 
proportional-hazards (CPH model) for OS and PFS was developed based on durvalumab and 
tremelimumab-treated patients in the HIMALAYA study. Simulated durvalumab and tremelimumab 
serum concentration-time PK profiles, based on individual post-hoc PK parameters, were used as a 
measure of exposure after T300 + D. Of the 388 patients in this cohort, 1 did not have tremelimumab 
exposure metrics, and therefore, 387 patients were included in the E-R analysis for tremelimumab. 
Exposure-efficacy relationship 
Overall survival (OS) 
The data for OS were stratified by model-predicted exposure metrics and overlaid with data from 
patients in the SoC arm. There were 4 exposure metrics used for tremelimumab (AUCdose 1, Cmin, dose 1, 
Cmax,dose 1, and AUC0-inf). 
Figure  shows the OS Kaplan-Meier (KM) plots for exposure metrics of tremelimumab. The number of 
patients at risk is indicated below each plot. The KM plots indicated that there was no clear relationship 
between efficacy and exposure to tremelimumab, with all quartiles overlapping each other.  
Additional explorative analyses of the covariates, body weight, and ADA status indicated that there is 
no clear association between OS and body weight or ADA status. However, the results for ADA status 
must be considered with caution due to the small number of ADA-positive patients in the 
tremelimumab treatment cohort.

The covariates, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were 
identified as significant in the final model. Higher AST and NLR were associated with shorter survival in 
T300 + D arm, suggesting they are prognostic factors for OS. The OS Kaplan Meier plot stratified by 
these 2 significant covariates can be found in Figure 10. A Forest plot of the final CPH model for OS is

tremelimumab, data stratified by model-predicted exposures metrics and overlaid with data from 
patients in the SoC arm (Cmin, dose 1, AUC0-inf). The number of patients at risk is indicated below the plot. 
These plots indicated no clear efficacy relationship to tremelimumab exposure, with all quartiles 
overlapping each other. 
Overall, no covariate was identified to be related with PFS in this analysis. 
Additional explorative analyses of the covariates, body weight, and ADA status for tremelimumab 
exposure did not indicate any clear trend between PFS and body weight or ADA status. However, the 
small number of ADA-positive patients after tremelimumab treatment mean that the Kaplan-Meier 
plots for ADA status should be interpreted with caution.

Exposure-safety relationship 
For assessment of an exposure-safety relationship, the evaluated safety endpoints were Grade 3 and 
above treatment-related AEs from HIMALAYA, Grade 3 and above AESIs, and AEs leading to 
durvalumab treatment discontinuation.  
Grade 3 and above treatment-related AEs 
The probability of AEs calculated in quartiles of the AUCdose 1 exposure metrics for durvalumab and 
tremelimumab is shown in Figure 13. This figure summarises the logistic regression results assessing 
the impact of exposure on the probability of AEs. The p-values associated with exposure effects were 
relatively large, indicating that the relationship was not statistically significant.

Figure 14: Relationship between the probability of having Grade 3 and above treatment-
related AESIs and AUC, dose 1 for durvalumab and tremelimumab 
Note: The black solid circles are the observed AEs, and the open squares with error bars are the observed 
probability of response at each exposure quartile. The black lines are the logistic regression between two 
variables, and the gray area represents the associated confidence interval. 
Abbreviations: AE, adverse event; AUC, area under the serum concentration-time curve. 
In conclusion, none of the tremelimumab or durvalumab exposure metrics in a logistic regression 
analysis were identified to have an influence on safety events defined as Grade 3 and above 
treatment-related AEs, Grade 3 and above AESIs, or AEs leading to durvalumab treatment 
discontinuation.  
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of tremelimumab was assessed for Imjudo as monotherapy and in 
combination with durvalumab. 
The PK of tremelimumab was studied in patients with doses ranging from 75 mg to 750 mg or 10 
mg/kg administered intravenously once every 4 or 12 weeks as monotherapy, or at a single dose of 
300 mg. PK exposure increased dose proportionally (linear PK) at doses ≥ 75 mg. Steady state was 
achieved at approximately 12 weeks. Based on population PK analysis that included patients who 
received tremelimumab monotherapy or in combination with other medicinal products in the dose 
range of ≥ 75 mg (or 1 mg/kg) every 3 or 4 weeks, the estimated tremelimumab clearance (CL) and 
volume of distribution (Vd) were 0.309 l/day and 6.33 l, respectively. The terminal half-life was 
approximately 14.2 days. 
HIMALAYA assessed the efficacy and safety of durvalumab and tremelimumab in combination versus 
durvalumab alone and sorafenib as SoC. In the two arms of the study that included tremelimumab 
treatment, tremelimumab was administered either as a single dose of 300 mg (in combination with 
durvalumab 1500 mg Q4W) or as 4 doses of 75 mg tremelimumab Q4W (in combination with 
durvalumab 1500 mg Q4W).  
Tremelimumab PK concentrations were within the expected exposure range following a single 300 mg 
dose as well as following four doses of 75 mg Q4W.

Overall, trough concentrations of tremelimumab at Cycle 2 were 3.3 times higher in the T300 + D arm 
than the T75 + D arm. In addition, similar tremelimumab exposures were observed in patients 
rechallenged with tremelimumab. 
Furthermore, PK profiles of durvalumab were overall similar between patients treated in the D arm and 
those in the T300 + D and T75 + D arms, suggesting that tremelimumab did not have an impact on 
the PK of durvalumab when administered in combination. 
Study 22 evaluated the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of durvalumab and tremelimumab 
administered as monotherapy, or durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab or bevacizumab in 
subjects with advanced unresectable HCC, similar exposures were observed following a weight-based 
dosing of 1 mg/kg and the equivalent fixed 75 mg dose. Additionally, similar exposures were observed 
following a weight-based dose of 10 mg/kg and the equivalent fixed 750 mg dose. 
No accumulation of tremelimumab was observed following repeated dosing in any of the cohorts in 
Study 22. In contrast, accumulation of durvalumab was observed following repeated dosing at 1500 
mg. Overall, durvalumab PK parameters were similar between patients treated with durvalumab 
monotherapy and those treated with durvalumab and tremelimumab combination therapy. 
The PK of tremelimumab could be described by a 2-compartment model with linear CL and an 
additional time-dependent CL component for patients on combination therapy only. Body weight, 
albumin, sex, combination therapy and primary indication were identified as statistically significant 
covariates on CL. Body weight and sex were identified as statistically significant covariates on V1. The 
effect of body weight was allometrically scaled with estimated exponents of 0.384 and 0.467 for CL 
and V1, respectively, indicating that the effect of body weight was less than proportional. Low-to-high 
inter-individual variability (%CV) was identified on CL (32.9%), V1 (24.9%), V2 (46.0%) and Tmax 
(119.2%). The adequacy of the model was confirmed based on the GOF-plots but some deviation was 
observed in the DV vs. IPRED plot. The same deviation was present in the previous model which 
suggests this deviation is not specific to HCC patients. In general, the model seems able to describe 
the overall tendency of the experimental data and parameters were estimated precisely.  
Age (18–87 years), body weight (34-149 kg), gender, positive anti-drug antibody (ADA) status, 
albumin levels, LDH levels, creatinine levels, tumour type, race or ECOG/WHO status had no clinically 
significant effect on the PK of tremelimumab. 
The exposure-efficacy relationships in the HIMALAYA study were explored by Cox Proportional Hazard 
(CPH) models. The assumption of proportional hazards of OS analysis are not fully supported for AST 
and the utilisation of the CPH model with this covariate should be interpreted with caution.  
The clinical pharmacology programme in special populations is considered adequate and typical for a 
monoclonal antibody product being administered intravenously. The effect of hepatic and renal 
impairment was not formally tested in dedicated clinical trials, and data from patients with severe renal 
impairment are too limited to draw conclusions on this population. Based on pop PK analyses, age, 
gender, race, mild/moderate renal impairment, or mild hepatic impairment had no impact on the 
exposure of tremelimumab. Accordingly, no dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild or 
moderate renal impairment and patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). 
No dose adjustment is required for elderly patients (≥ 65 years of age) (see section 5.2). Data on 
patients aged 75 years of age or older are limited. 
The use of systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants before starting tremelimumab, except 
physiological dose of systemic corticosteroids (≤ 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent), is not 
recommended because of their potential interference with the pharmacodynamic activity and efficacy 
of tremelimumab. However, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants can be used after 
starting tremelimumab to treat immune related adverse reactions (see section 4.4).

No formal pharmacokinetic (PK) drug drug interaction studies have been conducted with 
tremelimumab. Since the primary elimination pathways of tremelimumab are protein catabolism via 
reticuloendothelial system or target mediated disposition, no metabolic drug-drug interactions are 
expected. 
Assessment of an exposure-efficacy relationship was conducted using OS and PFS as efficacy 
parameters in patients from HIMALAYA. OS and PFS were explored by Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates 
and analyzed by Cox proportional-hazards models.  
For OS the KM plots indicate that there was no clear relationship between efficacy and exposure to 
tremelimumab, with all quartiles overlapping each other.  
The covariates, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were 
identified as significant in the final model. Higher AST and NLR were associated with shorter survival in 
T300 + D arm, suggesting they are prognostic factors for OS. 
For PFS the KM plots indicate no clear efficacy relationship to tremelimumab exposure, with all 
quartiles overlapping each other. Overall, no covariate was identified to be related with PFS in this 
analysis. 
Additional explorative analyses of the covariates, body weight, and ADA status for tremelimumab 
exposure did not indicate any clear trend between OS or PFS and body weight or ADA status. However, 
the small number of ADA-positive patients after tremelimumab treatment mean that the Kaplan-Meier 
plots for ADA status should be interpreted with caution. 
For assessment of an exposure-safety relationship, the evaluated safety endpoints were Grade 3 and 
above treatment-related AEs from HIMALAYA, Grade 3 and above AESIs, AEs leading to durvalumab 
treatment discontinuation.  
None of the tremelimumab or durvalumab exposure metrics in a logistic regression analysis were 
identified to have an influence on safety events defined as Grade 3 and above treatment-related AEs, 
Grade 3 and above AESIs or AEs leading to durvalumab treatment discontinuation. In the HIMALAYA 
study, no patients received BW
based dosing of tremelimumab (4 mg/kg).  
There appeared to be no clear trend between increasing body weight and the probability of AEs. 
‑
In terms of immunogenicity, the prevalence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and neutralizing antibodies 
(nAb) as well as incidence of ADA for tremelimumab in HIMALAYA were higher in the T75 + D arm than 
in the T300 + D arm. This could be related to the different number of tremelimumab doses in the 2 
treatment arms. 
The development of treatment-emergent ADA to tremelimumab did not have any apparent effect on 
serum concentrations of tremelimumab, efficacy or safety.  
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Considering the nature of the product, the pharmacology package is considered adequate.    
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The current marketing authorisation application for tremelimumab is based on efficacy data from 
HIMALAYA, a randomised, open-label, multicentre Phase III study in patients with unresectable 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) not eligible for locoregional therapy and with no prior systemic therapy

Figure 9: HIMALAYA study design 
Patient numbers shown correspond to the actual enrollment. 
Enrollment into the T75+D arm was closed following protocol edition 4.0 (29 November 2018). Patients randomised 
to T75+D prior to protocol amendment 3 could continue on their assigned study treatment, provided the 
Investigator and patient agreed this was in the patient’s best interest. Patients randomised to T75+D arm who had 
not completed or started all 4 doses of tremelimumab could either complete the full schedule or continue with 
durvalumab monotherapy only

DNA ≤ 2000 IU/mL) prior to enrollment. Patients were to remain on antiviral therapy for the study 
duration and for 6 months after the last dose of study treatment. Patients who tested positive for HBc 
with undetectable HBV DNA (< 10 IU/mL or under the limit of detection per local or central laboratory 
standard) did not require antiviral therapy prior to enrollment. These patients were tested at every 
cycle to monitor HBV DNA levels and antiviral therapy initiated if HBV DNA was detected (≥ 10 IU/mL 
or above the limit of detection per local or central laboratory standard). HBV DNA detectable patients 
were to initiate and remain on antiviral therapy for the study duration and for 6 months after the last 
dose of study treatment.

Treatments 
Table 7: Study treatments 
The proposed dosing regimen for the relevant arm for this procedure (T300+D, arm C) is new and 
encompasses one single initial dose of tremelimumab 300 mg in combination with durvalumab 1500 
mg and thereafter, durvalumab monotherapy iv Q4W until PD or unacceptable toxicity.  
The relevant comparator arm for the current procedure is the standard of care arm (SOC, arm D), 
which contains sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily as standardly dosed, and treatment should also be 
given until PD or unacceptable toxicity. No cross-over was allowed. 
The two other treatment arms with D (durvalumab 1500 mg Q4W, arm A) and T75+D (tremelimumab 
75 mg Q4W × 4 doses + durvalumab 1500 mg Q4W, followed by durvalumab 1500 mg Q4W, arm B) 
are not of relevance for this procedure. 
It is noted that although the combination of a CTLA-4 inhibitor, such as tremelimumab, and an 
immunecheckpoint inhibitor such as durvalumab is not new, it is the first time that the anti-CTLA-4 is 
given only as an induction dose and then monotherapy with durvalumab is continued until PD.

Moreover, the already approved combination therapy with ipilimumab + nivolumab differs as 
nivolumab is PD-1 inhibitor, while durvalumab is a PD-L1 inhibitor. 
The applicant claims that pharmacodynamic results reported for tremelimumab and durvalumab in 
Study 006 suggest that the pharmacodynamic effects of anti-CTLA-4 are mainly associated with the 
first dosing cycle and subside in subsequent cycles regardless of dose. Moreover, these results led to 
the hypothesis that a single dose of tremelimumab might accomplish similar pharmacodynamic effects 
as seen in Study 006 and also seen for ipilimumab, while also limiting the toxicity associated with the 
second (and subsequent) anti-CTLA-4 dosing cycles.

Sample size 
This study will screen approximately 1650 patients, with no prior systemic therapy for hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) and not eligible for locoregional therapy, in order to randomise approximately 1310 
patients. (This includes 1155 patients randomised to Arms A (Durvalumab monotherapy), C (T300+D), 
D (S) with 385 per arm; and approximately 155 patients in Arm B (T75+D), randomised prior to the 
closure of this arm). The study is sized to characterize the OS benefit of Arm C vs. Arm D (T300+D vs 
S).  
Assessment report

The sample size estimation assumes an exponentially distributed OS and a 2-month delay in 
separation of the OS curves for Arm C vs. Arm D. A non-uniform accrual of patients with a duration of 
22 months is assumed when estimating the analysis times. 
For the efficacy comparisons, the median OS for sorafenib (Arm D) is assumed to be 11.5 months, with 
an 18-month OS rate of 33.8%. 
Durvalumab 1500 mg plus tremelimumab 300 mg × 1 dose (Arm C) versus sorafenib 400 mg BID 
(Arm D) (OS in FAS [ITT]) 
The assumed OS treatment effect is an average HR of 0.70 for Arm C versus Arm D. This translates to 
an increase in median OS from 11.5 months to 16.5 months, and in the 18-month OS rate from 33.8% 
to 46.8% in Arm C versus Arm D. Final analysis of OS will be performed when approximately 515 
events in Arm C and Arm D combined (~67% maturity) have occurred. This number of OS events will 
provide 97% power to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in OS at a 2-sided 4.25% 
significance level. The smallest treatment difference that could be observed as statistically significant 
at the final analysis is an average HR of 0.84 (an increase in median OS from 11.5 months to 13.7 
months in Arm C versus Arm D). 
No formal sample size calculations were associated with the analyses planned for IA1. However, global 
enrollment was required to be completed prior to the DCO for IA1. 
There were 2 IAs and a FA planned for HIMALAYA. Any major changes to the planned analyses were 
addressed in protocol amendments finalised prior to the date of the first DCO for Interim analysis 1 for 
ORR (02 September 2019). These changes were informed by the open-label Study 22 and study read-
outs from external studies in the same disease area, including KEYNOTE-240 and CheckMate-459. No 
HIMALAYA data were available for use to modify the protocol design or statistical analysis plan. 
The sample size calculations were updated several times while the study was ongoing. Major changes 
were implemented in the Protocol version 4 (29 Nov 2018) and in Protocol version 6 (20 Aug 2019). In 
protocol version 4, the arm durvalumab + tremelimumab 75 mg was closed due to unfavourable 
results obtained in the supportive Study 22. At this point, the sample size for the remaining arms was 
increased to 385 and the number of required events at the second interim analysis and at the final 
analysis was changed. In protocol version 6, the median OS and 18-month OS rate for sorafenib was 
increased from 10 months and 28.7 % to 11.5 months and 33.8 %, respectively. The required number 
of events at the second interim analysis and at the final analysis were also changed.  
The applicant claimed that the changes made in the protocol and SAP were solely informed by external 
data including Study 22 and KEYNOTE-240 and CheckMate-459. Nevertheless, changes in the sample 
size while the study is ongoing can jeopardise the interpretation of the results since they may alter the 
behaviour of study participants and personnel. The changes were implemented between 1 and 2 years 
from study start, and one month before the first interim analysis (2 Sep 2019). Therefore, the sample 
size calculations are not considered relevant and the study results will be assessed based on the size of 
the confidence intervals.

Protocol amendment 4 closed enrolment to Arm B. As a result of protocol amendment 4, subjects will 
be randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to Arm A, Arm C and Arm D. Subjects randomised to Arm B prior to 
amendment 4 can remain on study as planned until discontinuation criteria are met at the discretion of 
the investigator. 
Randomisation will be stratified according to macrovascular invasion (yes versus no), aetiology of liver 
disease (hepatitis B virus [confirmed HBV] versus hepatitis C virus [confirmed HCV] versus others), 
and ECOG PS (0 versus 1). 
A randomisation list was produced for each of the randomisation stratum. A blocked randomisation was 
generated, and all centres used the same list in order to minimise any imbalance in the number of 
patients assigned to each treatment arm. 
The study was open-label. Measures were in place to ensure that the Study team was blinded to 
treatment assignment and results from the interim analyses. An IDMC assessed safety data ongoing 
and performed the interim analyses.

Statistical methods 
Full analysis set 
The full analysis set (FAS) was to include all randomised patients, including patients who were 
randomised in error. The FAS will be used for all efficacy analyses (including PROs). Treatment arms 
were to be compared on the basis of randomised study drug(s), regardless of the study drug(s) 
actually received. Patients who were randomised but did not subsequently go on to receive study 
drug(s) were included in the analysis in the treatment arm to which they were randomised. 
For IA1 an additional analysis set will be defined: FAS subjects with an opportunity for 32 weeks of 
follow up at the time of IA1 (FAS-32w, i.e., randomised ≥ 32 weeks prior to IA1 DCO). 
The primary analysis was performed using the FAS, which includes all randomised patients. For the 
first IA, only subjects who had the opportunity to attend at least 32 weeks of follow-up were included. 
The results of the first IA are not related to the primary objectives of the study.

Overall survival 
The primary OS endpoint was to be analysed using a stratified log-rank tests adjusting for aetiology of 
liver disease (confirmed HBV versus confirmed HCV versus others), ECOG (0 versus 1), and 
macrovascular invasion (yes versus no) for generation of the p-value and using rank tests for 
association as the testing approach, which corresponds to Cox regression with the Breslow approach 
for handling ties (Breslow, 1974).  
The effect of Arm C vs. Arm D treatment was to be estimated by the HR from stratified Cox 
proportional hazards model (with ties=Efron and stratification variables as listed above) together with 
its corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) calculated using a profile likelihood approach. The 
stratification variable used the values recorded in the randomisation system (IWRS).  
If there is >10% discordance in stratification factors as recorded in IWRS versus the Case Report Form 
(CRF), then a sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint OS were to be performed using CRF based 
stratification factors. 
Secondary OS analyses were to be performed using the same methodology as for primary analysis 
described above. 
Censoring rules for OS 
Any subject not known to have died at the time of analysis will be censored based on the last recorded 
date on which the subject was known to be alive 
Assumptions of Proportionality 
The assumption of proportionality of hazard was to be assessed first by examining plots of 
complementary log-log (event times) versus log (time) and, if these raise concerns, by fitting a time-
dependent covariate to assess the extent to which this represents random variation. If a lack of 
proportionality of hazard is evident, the variation in treatment effect will be described by presenting 
piecewise HR calculated over distinct time periods. The Grambsch-Therneau test and Schoenfeld 
residuals may also be used to check violation of the proportional hazards assumption. As a lack of 
proportionality is expected (due to delayed effect in IO agents), a three-component stratified 
MaxCombo test will be used as a sensitivity analysis with the same stratification factors as the primary 
analysis. The Restricted Mean Survival Time (RMST) will also be analysed up to the minimum of the 
largest observed event time in each of the two arms and /or suitable clinically relevant timepoint. In 
addition, an area-under-the-curve approach (Kaplan-Meier method) and Royston-Parmar model 
(Royston and Parmar 2011, 2013) may also be used. 
Sensitivity analysis  
•  Censoring patterns: A sensitivity analysis for OS will examine the censoring patterns to rule 
out attrition bias, achieved by a Kaplan-Meier plot of time-to-censoring where the censoring 
indicator of OS is reversed. 
• 
• 
Impact of switching (crossover outside of this study) to other immunotherapies (or other 
potentially active investigational agents) on OS analyses: Exploratory analyses of OS adjusting 
for the impact of subsequent switching of immunotherapy or the investigational treatment may 
be performed, if a sufficient proportion of subjects switch. 
Effect of COVID-19: A sensitivity analysis will be conducted to assess for the potential impact 
of COVID deaths on OS. This was to be assessed by repeating the OS analysis except that any 
subject who had a death with primary/secondary cause as COVID-19 Infection will be censored 
at their COVID infection death date.

• 
Effect of covariates on the HR estimate: Cox proportional hazards modelling was to be 
employed to assess the effect of pre-specified covariates on the HR estimate for the primary 
OS treatment comparisons. As an exploratory analysis, the covariates from the model in the 
primary analysis and the model containing additional covariates may be presented. 
OS12, OS18, OS24, and OS36 
OS12, OS18, OS24, and OS36 were to be defined as the Kaplan-Meier estimate of OS at 12 months, 
18 months, 24 months, and 36 months. OS12, OS18, OS24, and OS36, along with their 95% CI, will 
be summarised (using the Kaplan- Meier curve) and presented by treatment arm. An analysis of OS36 
will be performed to compare Arm C vs. Arm D using a stratified chisquare test for the difference in KM 
estimators (cloglog transformed) for Arms C and D at a fixed time point (36 months). The test will be 
conducted using the methods described in (Klein et al., 2007), including cloglog transformation on KM 
estimators, with randomisation stratification factors (macrovascular invasion, etiology of liver disease, 
and ECOG). Note that the adjustment for the stratification factors will be applied only if there are 
sufficient number of events and subjects at risk available in each strata at 36 months. Otherwise, an 
unstratified chisquare test will be used to compare the difference in KM estimators at 36 months. 
OS was analysed using a stratified log-rank tests adjusting for the factors used at randomisation: 
etiology of liver disease (confirmed HBV versus confirmed HCV versus others), ECOG (0 versus 1), and 
macrovascular invasion (yes versus no). The HR will be estimated using a stratified Cox model. The 
fulfilment of the proportional hazard assumption was investigated using a graphical approach and a 
maxcombo test. Sensitivity analyses were planned to explore the impact of treatment switch, covid 19 
and effect of covariates. Censoring pattern were examined using the reverse Kaplan-Meier method. 
Patients not known to have died were censored at the last observation date.  
The statistical method implemented to analysis OS is overall endorsed. The applicant has clarified that 
he concordance rate between stratification factors entered in the IWRS vs eCRF at screening and 
baseline is high and due to <10% discordance rate, the threshold for triggering the sensitivity analysis 
was not met. Hence, no sensitivity analysis for primary efficacy analysis of OS adjusted for eCRF 
stratification factors at baseline has been conducted, which is acceptable. 
Objective response rate based on Investigator assessment (ORR) 
Data obtained up until progression, or the last evaluable assessment in the absence of progression, will 
be included in the assessment of ORR. Subjects who go off treatment without progression, receive a 
subsequent therapy, and then respond will not be included as responders in the ORR. ORR based on at 
least one confirmed response will also be derived and reported in CSR. 
Logistic regression models adjusting for the same factors as the primary endpoint (etiology of liver 
disease, ECOG, and macrovascular invasion) will be fitted. The results of the analysis will be presented 
in terms of an odds ratio together with its associated profile likelihood 95% CI (e.g. using the option 
‘LRCI’ in SAS procedure GENMOD) and p-value (based on twice the change in log-likelihood resulting 
from the addition of a treatment factor to the model). 
Additionally, at IA2 and FA a stratified Cochran Mantel–Haenszel (CMH) test will be performed using 
randomisation stratification factors (macrovascular invasion, etiology of liver disease, and ECOG). CMH 
test results will include odds ratios and p-values. 
Progression Free Survival by Investigator (PFS) 
Analysis of PFS (time to first progression) will be performed to compare Arm C vs. Arm D and Arm A 
vs. Arm D using the same methodology as for OS. Exploratory analyses will compare Arm A vs. Arm C.

Interim analyses 
Two interim analyses and a final analysis are planned as described below: 
Interim Analysis 1 (IA1): The first interim analysis will be performed after approximately 100 subjects 
per treatment arm have had the opportunity for 32 weeks of follow-up and not prior to the last subject 
enrolled. The objective is to evaluate the efficacy of Arm A and Arm C in terms of ORR and DoR. The 
analysis set for ORR and DoR will be the FAS-32wA BICR of radiological scans will be performed on all 
subjects included in IA1 who have been randomised and have had the opportunity for at least 32 
weeks follow-up. Both Investigator (using RECIST 1.1) and BICR (using RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST) 
assessments are planned for IA1. Therefore, ORR and DoR (for both confirmed and unconfirmed 
responses) according to both Investigator using RECIST 1.1 and BICR using RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST 
will be reported for IA1. 
Interim Analysis 2 (IA2): The second interim analysis will be performed when approximately 404 OS 
events in Arm C and Arm D combined (~52% maturity), approximately 30 months after the first 
subject is randomised. The goal is to evaluate the efficacy of Arm C vs. Arm D (for superiority) and 
then Arm A vs. Arm D (for non-inferiority, then superiority) in terms of OS. It is anticipated that 
approximately 453 OS events will have occurred across Arms A and D combined (~59% maturity) at 
the time of the DCO for IA2. 
Final Analysis (FA): The final analysis is expected to be performed when approximately 515 OS events 
in Arm C and Arm D combined (~67% maturity), approximately 37.5 months after the first subject is 
randomised. The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of Arm C vs. Arm D in terms of OS for 
superiority. The key secondary objectives are to assess the efficacy of Arm A vs. Arm D in terms of OS 
(for non-inferiority, then superiority). It is anticipated that approximately 560 OS events will have 
occurred across Arms A and D combined (~73% maturity) at the time of the DCO for the final analysis. 
Efficacy data for Arm B (which was closed for enrollment with Amendment 4) will be summarised 
descriptively, however will not be formally analysed. 
Multiplicity 
To strongly control the familywise error rate (FWER) at the 5% level (2-sided), an alpha level of 0.1% 
will be spent on the interim ORR analysis (IA1) while the remaining 4.9% alpha level will be spent on 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17771/2023  
Page 95/176 
 
 
 
 
 
  
all OS analyses. The primary objective of OS will be tested (H1: Arm C vs. Arm D) with 4.9% for this 
comparison. 
Since two analyses of OS are planned (Interim Analysis, Final Analysis), the Lan DeMets approach (Lan 
and DeMets 1983) that approximates the O’Brien and Fleming spending function will be used to 
maintain an overall 2-sided 4.9% type I error across the two planned analyses of OS (Interim and 
Final) for the primary comparison (H1: Arm C vs. Arm D). 
If all the OS analyses (H1, H2, and H3) are considered successful (superiority tests are statistically 
significant and non-inferiority is achieved), the 4.9% alpha level will be passed to test the difference in 
the three-year survival rates (OS36) between Arm C and Arm D; Otherwise the test will not be 
conducted. The study will be considered positive (a success) if the primary OS analysis result is 
statistically significant at either IA2 or FA. If significance is achieved at IA2, it does not need to be 
tested again at FA. 
Figure 16: Multiple testing strategy 
The MAH planned to perform 2 interim and 1 final analyses. The first interim analysis was planned to 
be performed after 100 subjects per treatment arm have had the opportunity for 32 weeks of follow-
up. The objective is to evaluate the efficacy of Arm A and Arm C in terms of ORR and DoR. This 
analysis was not related to the primary objective of the study. The second interim analysis was related 
to OS and planned to be performed after 404 OS events were observed (~52% maturity). The final OS 
analysis was planned to be performed after 515 OS events (~67% maturity) had been observed. The 
MAH implemented a hierarchical approach to protect the type I error due to multiple hypotheses being 
tested (OS superiority for T300+D vs S, OS non-inferiority for D vs S, OS superiority D vs S). An 
inflation of the type I error due to multiple looks was avoided using an alpha spending function.  
The implemented strategy to control the type I error is endorsed. Of note, the results presented in the 
CSR corresponds to the final analysis for OS. 
Changes to Planned Analyses 
Changes to the statistical analyses planned are shown in Table . The AstraZeneca study team was 
responsible for all changes to the planned statistical analyses. All major changes were made prior to 
the DBL for the final analysis (DCO: 27 August 2021) (data not shown). Minor changes to the 
algorithms for counting the number of dose delays for S and for determination of analysis windows for 
T and D were made after the SAP was finalised.

Of 1950 patients enrolled in the pivotal study, 61 were rescreened and 1324 were randomised to 1 of 
the 4 original treatment arms. The applicant has clarified that of the 687 non-randomised patients, 654 
did not fulfil eligibility criteria and 33 were not randomised due to other reasons. The screen failure 
reasons of these 33 patients as collected as free text field in CRF are summarised in Table : 10/33 
patients were not randomised due to inability to complete screening procedures within the 28-day 
window, 6/33 withdrew informed consent or failed to return to clinic, 2/33 were unable to provide the 
required tumour tissue sample, and 2/33 died prior to randomisation. In addition, 9/33 did not report 
more specific screen failure reasons. Other reasons were reported in 1 patient each and included 
insurance coverage issues, incorrect screening, inability to verify eligibility, or local issues with 
sorafenib supply. The clarification is accepted and the screen failure reasons are in line with what could 
be expected for a clinical trial with the targeted patient population.  
•  Recruitment 
The first patient was enrolled on 11 October 2017 and the last patient on 19 June 2019. The median 
follow-up for OS at DCO (27 August 2021) was ~33 months in the T300+D arm and ~32 months in 
the S arm.

a 
In HIMALAYA, patients were enrolled only if they had BCLC Stage B (not eligible for locoregional therapy) or Stage C. In 
Study 22, BCLC Stage was not specified in the inclusion criteria and collection of BCLC scores was not mandated at 
screening until protocol amendment 3 (20 July 2017); as a result, baseline BCLC scores were missing for some patients in 
Part 2A (see Section 9.2.2, Study 22 CSR, Module 5.3.5.2). 
Includes all patients with “MVI = Yes and EHS = No/Missing,” “MVI = No/Missing and EHS = Yes,” and “MVI = Yes 
b 
and EHS = Yes.” 
c 
PD-L1 expression level was defined as “Positive” if PD-L1 staining of any intensity in tumour cell membranes and/or 
tumour-associated immune cells covered ≥ 1% of tumour area (TIP ≥ 1%), and “Negative” if PD-L1 staining of any 
intensity in tumour cell membranes and/or tumour-associated immune cells covered < 1% of tumour area (TIP < 1%). 
d 
Per inclusion criteria, no patients in HIMALAYA received prior systemic therapy for HCC (first-line setting only). In Study 
22, patients were required to be immunotherapy-naïve and had either progressed on, were intolerant to, or have refused 
treatment with sorafenib or another approved VEGFR TKI (first-line and second-line settings).

Prior cancer therapy 
Per inclusion criteria, no patients in HIMALAYA received prior systemic therapy for HCC (first-line 
setting only). Overall, the most common disease-related medical procedures prior to study entry, 
including ablative therapy, therapeutic embolisation, regional chemotherapy, and HCC-related surgery, 
were similar across treatment arms and consistent with that typically seen in the target patient 
population. 
In study 22, the prior anticancer treatment modalities reported were prior treatment with 
sorafenib/VEGFR TKI (55/75 patients, 73.3%). Most patients had undergone prior TACE or RFA Per 
protocol, all patients were immunotherapy-naïve.

The HR was calculated using a Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for treatment arm, etiology of liver disease (HBV vs 
HCV vs all others), ECOG (0 vs 1), and MVI (yes vs no). An HR < 1 favors either the T300+D arm or the D arm compared with 
the S arm in terms of being associated with a longer OS. 
T300+D vs S (primary objective in HIMALAYA). Statistical significance for T300+D vs S was based on a 2-sided interim 
p < 0.0419 (overall alpha 4.9%), as defined in the MTP. 
D vs S (key secondary objective in HIMALAYA). The non-inferiority margin for D vs S was 1.08, as defined in the MTP. 
The analysis was performed using a stratified log-rank test adjusting for treatment arm, etiology of liver disease (HBV vs HCV 
vs all others), ECOG (0 vs 1), and MVI (yes vs no). 
Calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. 
Patients confirmed alive in follow-up or on active study treatment at the time of final analysis reported “study completion” on 
the disposition CRF. 
Includes patients with unknown survival status or patients who were lost to follow-up. 
Median for duration of follow-up is the arithmetic median. 
Calculated using the reverse Kaplan-Meier technique (with censor indicator reversed).

Patients who had not progressed or died, or who progressed or died after 2 or more missed visits, were censored at the latest 
evaluable RECIST 1.1 assessment, or Day 1 if there were no evaluable visits. Patients who have no evaluable visits or baseline 
data were censored at Day 1 unless they died within 2 visits of baseline. Patients who die without tumour progression will be 
censored at the time of death. 
Progression determined by Investigator assessment. Lost to follow-up is defined as patients who have no RECIST 1.1 progression or 
death at the time of the DCO and have a termination status of 'Lost to follow-up' from the Disposition module. Withdrawn consent is 
defined as patients who have no RECIST 1.1 progression or death at the time of DCO and whose termination status is 'Withdrawn 
consent' on the Disposition module. The analysis methods used to obtain the hazard ratio, confidence interval, and 2-sided p-value 
are the same as for the primary OS analysis. 
A hazard ratio of < 1 favours IO treatment arms to be associated with a longer progression-free survival than sorafenib.

Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) 
Patient-reported symptoms, function, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were collected in the 
HIMALAYA study using the EORTC QLQ C30 and its HCC module (EORTC QLQ HCC18). At baseline, 
patient-reported symptoms, functioning, and HRQoL scores were comparable between the HIMALAYA 
study arms.

HR < 1 favors the IO treatment arm. 
HR and 95% CI were estimated from an unstratified Cox proportional hazards model with treatment as the only covariate and 
using the Efron method to control for ties. 
HR and 95% CI were estimated from a Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for treatment, etiology of liver disease (HBV 
vs HCV vs others), ECOG performance status (0 vs 1), and MVI (yes vs no). 
PD-L1 expression level is based on the TIP score method as: PD-L1 Positive (TIP ≥ 1%) or PD-L1 Negative (TIP < 1%). The TIP 1% 
cut-off is the only validated cut-off at which HIMALAYA patient samples were read. Additional PD-L1 TIP cut-offs of 5% and 10% 
should be interpreted in an exploratory manner.

Sensitivity analyses 
Figure 22: Complementary log-log(event) vs log(time) to assess assumptions of 
proportionality of hazards for OS (FAS) 
Inversed Censoring 
The reverse KM survival curve shown in Figure  is constructed by reversing the “censor” and “event” of 
the standard KM curve (data not shown). Figure 8 shows that the curves for arms D, T300+D and S 
remain close to 1 for the first 26 months post randomisation, indicating nearly complete follow-up for 
this period of time. No meaningful difference in the length of follow-up among arms D, T300+D and S 
can be seen in the figure, which is also evidenced by similar median follow-up times in censored 
patients (D: 31.61 months, T300+D: 32.36 months, and S: 30.36 months).

Additional sensitivity analyses following inaccurate survival information at site 6208  
GCP findings from the PMDA concerning the HIMALAYA trial, indicated that survival information was 
inaccurate for 4 subjects at site 6208. Following question regarding this issue, the supplementary 
analysis of OS with the corrected data was provided.  
In total the site 6208 enrolled 14 patients in HIMALAYA study. Overall survival data for 4/14 enrolled 
patients was affected, and no discrepancies in survival information were identified for the remaining 
10/14 patients after onsite review.

Figure 24: KM plot of OS by removing site 6208 (full analysis set) 
The applicant has provided the requested sensitivity analysis, using the most conservative approach by 
removing all 14 patients enrolled at this site and this showed that the OS HR was of 0.77 (95%CI: 
0.65, 0.91) for T300+D vs. S comparison, which is the main scope of the current procedure. There is 
overall consistency between the sensitivity analysis and the primary analysis, which is considered 
reassuring.

2.6.5.4.  In vitro biomarker test for patient selection for efficacy 
PD-L1 testing 
The relationship between PD-L1 expression level and clinical outcomes (eg, OS, PFS, and ORR) was 
investigated, and the results are presented by treatment arm. 
PD-L1 expression was determined by the analytically validated VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) assay using 
the TIP score method. The TIP score was defined as the total percentage of the tumour area covered 
by tumour cells with PD-L1 membrane staining at any intensity and/or tumour-associated immune cells 
with any pattern of PD-L1 staining at any intensity. Two PD-L1 expression subgroups were defined: 
• 
• 
PD-L1 TIP ≥ 1% (Positive): PD-L1 staining of any intensity in tumour cell membranes and/or 
tumour-associated immune cells covering ≥ 1% of the tumour area 
PD-L1 TIP < 1% (Negative): PD-L1 staining of any intensity in tumour cell membranes and/or 
tumour-associated immune cells covering < 1% of the tumour area. 
Collection of patient samples for analysis of PD-L1 expression 
Patients were strongly encouraged to provide a fresh tissue biopsy for the purpose of PD-L1 expression 
analyses at screening. The tumour specimen submitted to the central laboratory for PD-L1 expression 
analysis should be of sufficient quantity and quality (with pathology quality control) to allow for PD-L1 
immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses. Newly acquired or archived specimens with limited tumour 
content and fine needle aspirates were not acceptable for defining tumour PD-L1 expression. 
•  MANDATORY: Provision of a tumour biopsy, formalin fixed and embedded in paraffin, for the 
purpose of PD-L1 expression analyses (and for enabling exploratory analyses as described in 
the proceeding section). A newly acquired tumour biopsy (<3 months) was strongly preferred; 
however, if not feasible with an acceptable clinical risk, an archival sample taken ≤3 years prior 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17771/2023  
Page 127/176 
 
 
 
 
 
to screening could have been submitted. Note: the tumour biopsy was optional for the China 
cohort. 
•  Samples should have been collected via an image-guided core needle (at least 18 gauge) or an 
excisional archival tumour biopsy sample. Where institutional practice, in this setting, uses a 
smaller gauge needle, samples should have been submitted with tissue adequate to ensure 
that a valid result can be achieved (ie, total tissue quantity submitted should have been similar 
to core needle or excisional biopsy requirements). 
•  When fresh tissue was obtained, 2 cores should have been placed in formalin and processed to 
a single paraffin-embedded block. It was anticipated that 4 passes of an 18 gauge core needle 
would provide sufficient tissue for both PD-L1 analyses and exploratory analyses as described 
below. Tumour lesions used for fresh biopsies should not have been the same lesions used as 
RECIST 1.1 TLs, unless there were no other lesions suitable for biopsy, and in this instance, 
only core needle (not excisional/incisional) biopsy was allowed. For patients with a single TL, if 
screening biopsy was collected prior to screening imaging for baseline tumour assessment, 
allowed approximately 2 weeks before imaging scans were acquired. 
•  OPTIONAL: Additional archived tumour tissue block (formalin fixed and paraffin embedded), 
where such samples exist in a quantity sufficient to allow for analysis. Tumour tissue block was 
preferred. If a tissue block was unavailable, unstained sections from the tissue block may be 
submitted.  
•  OPTIONAL: Tumour biopsy at the time of progression was requested 
•  OPTIONAL: Additional tumour biopsies collected as part of clinical care (eg, for mixed 
responses or upon PD) could have been submitted for further analysis. 
•  Additional archived tissue not intended for PD-L1 testing, and optional biopsies obtained at the 
time of progression or part of clinical care were not to be collected in China. Additionally, China 
study sites were not to submit tumour tissue blocks and only unstained sections from the 
tissue block were to be submitted for analysis. 
• 
The Ventana SP263 IHC assay was to be used to determine PD-L1 expression in all available 
specimens. To meet the requirement of the United States Food and Drug Administration for 
approval of a companion diagnostic, sections of the tumour were to be retained at Ventana 
and/or at the Investigation Use only testing laboratory for potential additional studies to 
support potential test approval. 
The Ventana SP163 PD-L1 assay was validated as an appropriate method for the selection of patients 
who would obtain benefit from durvalumab monotherapy in the PACIFIC trial, whose outcome led to 
the PD-L1 restricted indication of this anti-PD-L1 product in the locally advanced unresectable NSCLC 
setting after chemoradiotherapy. Thus, the choice of PD-L1 assay is acceptable.

Following protocol amendment 5, enrollment into the T75+D arm in Part 3 was closed. Patients already randomised to T75+D could 
continue on assigned study treatment (provided the Investigator and patient thought it in the best interests of the patient) until 
confirmed progressive disease or any other discontinuation criteria were met. Weight-based dosing regimen was used in Parts 2A; 
fixed-dosing regimens were used in Part 2B and Part 3 (durvalumab only).

Study 22 was a randomised, multicentre, international, open-label, multipart study designed to 
evaluate the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of durvalumab and tremelimumab administered as 
monotherapy, and durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab or bevacizumab, in patients with 
advanced HCC. The study was comprised of multiple parts but only Parts 2 and 3 of Study 22 are 
relevant for this procedure.   
The primary objectives of Parts 2 and 3 were to: 
•  Assess the safety and tolerability of durvalumab and tremelimumab administered as 
monotherapy and durvalumab administered in combination with tremelimumab to subjects 
with advanced HCC.  
The secondary objectives were to: 
• 
• 
Evaluate the efficacy of durvalumab and tremelimumab administered as monotherapy and 
durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab in subjects with advanced HCC. 
Evaluate the relationship between baseline and pharmacodynamic biomarkers and measures of 
clinical outcomes of durvalumab and tremelimumab administered as monotherapy, and 
durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab in subjects with advanced HCC. 
The final analysis of data in all study parts was performed 12 months after the first dose of 
investigational product was given to the last patient enrolled in the study (DCO: 06 November 2020). 
Patient population 
In Study 22, eligible patients were aged ≥ 18 years (≥ 20 years for Japanese patients) with advanced 
HCC confirmed pathologically or with non-invasive methods. This study enrolled immunotherapy-naïve 
patients who progressed on, were intolerant to, or refused treatment with sorafenib or another 
approved VEGFR TKI. Patients with co-infection of viral hepatitis B and hepatitis C, active or prior 
documented GI bleeding within 12 months, ascites requiring non-pharmacologic intervention within 6 
months, hepatic encephalopathy within 12 months before the start of treatment, and active or prior 
documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders were excluded.

In Part 2A of Study 22, eligible patients were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to each of the following 
3 treatment arms: D: Durvalumab 20 mg/kg Q4W; T: Tremelimumab 10 mg/kg Q4W × 7 doses 
followed by Q12W; T75+D: Tremelimumab 1 mg/kg Q4W × 4 doses + durvalumab 20 mg/kg Q4W, 
followed by durvalumab 20 mg/kg Q4W 
Part 2B was a safety run-in for the combination regimen consisting of a single, priming dose of 
tremelimumab (300 mg) added to durvalumab Q4W. Part 3 was a dose expansion cohort of patients 
enrolled in Parts 2A and B. Eligible patients were randomised in a 2:2:1:2 ratio to each of the following 
4 treatment arms: D: Durvalumab 1500 mg (20 mg/kg) Q4W; T300+D: Tremelimumab 300 mg (4 
mg/kg) × 1 dose + durvalumab 1500 mg (20 mg/kg) Q4W; T: Tremelimumab 750 mg (10 mg/kg) 
Q4W × 7 doses followed by Q12W; T75+D: Tremelimumab 75 mg (1 mg/kg) Q4W× 4 doses + 
durvalumab 1500 mg (20 mg/kg) Q4W, followed by durvalumab 1500 mg (20 mg/kg) Q4W. 
In Part 2A, patients were stratified based on viral status (uninfected, HCV infected, or HBV infected) 
and PD-L1 expression (positive, negative, or non-evaluable). In Part 3, patients were stratified based 
on viral status (uninfected, HCV infected, or HBV infected) and sorafenib-based therapy (refusers or all 
others). 
Table 42: Previous disease-related treatment modalities in Parts 2 and 3 (FAS) 
Results 
A total of 326 (98.2%) patients in the FAS of Parts 2 and 3 received study treatment. At the final DCO, 
93.3% of patients across all treatment arms discontinued study treatment. The most frequently 
reported reason for discontinuing study treatment was HCC disease progression in 66.6% of patients; 
11% of patients discontinued due to AEs. The rate of study treatment discontinuation due to PD or AEs 
was similar across the T300+D and D treatment arms. 
The number of patients in Parts 2 and 3 with important protocol deviations with the potential to affect 
the analyses was low (13 patients overall [3.9%]).

Overall Survival (Part 2 Only) 
A total of 125 patients were randomised/allocated to treatment in Part 2: 40 in the D arm, 10 in the 
T300+D arm, 36 in the T arm, and 39 in the T75+D arm. At the final DCO, 81.6% of patients in part 2 
had died (FAS): 80.0% in the D arm, 70.0% in the T300+D arm, 80.6% in the T arm, and 87.2% in the 
T75+D arm. The percentage of patients alive at the final DCO and in survival follow-up (including those 
still receiving study treatment) was highest in the T300+D arm (30.0%) compared to the other 3 arms 
(10.3% to 17.5%). 
The  Kaplan-Meier  estimate  of  median  OS  was  highest  for  patients  receiving  T300+D  (28.06  months) 
compared to patients receiving D (11.78 months), T (17.05 months), or T75+D (13.34 months).  
Overall Survival (Part 3 Only) 
Part 3 included the following number of patients per treatment arm: 64 in D arm; 65 in T300+D arm; 
33 in T arm; 45 in T75+D arm. Median OS was higher for patients in the T300+D (16.16 months) and T 
arms (17.54 arms) compared to D (13.57 months) and T75+D (11.30 months). 
ADA Response to tremelimumab (in Parts 2 and 3) 
At the final DCO, immunogenicity data for tremelimumab were available for 56.9% of patients evaluable 
for ADA.  
ADA prevalence for tremelimumab was 12.7% in the T300+D arm, 15.6% in the T arm, and 7.3% in the 
T75+D  arm  and  the  majority  of  ADA-positive  patients  were  classified  as  treatment-emergent  ADA 
positive.  ADA  incidence  for  tremelimumab  appeared  to  be  numerically  higher  in  the  T  treatment  arm 
(15.6%) relative to the T300+D (7.3%) and T75+D (7.3%) arms ( 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17771/2023

Table ). However, due to the small number of ADA-positive patients in all treatment arms (≤ 5 in all 
arms), it is not possible to draw a definitive conclusion. 
All 12 of the tremelimumab treatment-emergent ADA positive patients in the study were classified as 
persistently ADA positive. However, 11 of these were classified as such due to the last ADA assessment 
being positive, rather than based on the duration of the ADA response being ≥ 16 weeks.

(safety analysis set) 
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The efficacy of the new active substance, tremelimumab (T), in combination with the already approved 
PD-L1 inhibitor durvalumab (D) for the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC) is 
primarily based on the pivotal Himalaya study. This was a randomised, open-label, multicentre 
Phase III study in patients with uHCC not eligible for locoregional therapy. Patients were recruited from 
181 sites across 16 countries, mostly from countries with an EU-like population. No prior systemic 
therapy was allowed and only patients with mild or no symptoms pertaining to the HCC and/or liver 
cirrhosis were eligible, which is not considered reflective of the general patient population with uHCC. 
However, the inclusion and exclusion criteria are reflected in the SmPC section 5.1, so this is 
acceptable. 1324 patients were randomised to 4 arms, durvalumab monotherapy (D, n=389); 
tremelimumab single dose 300 mg + durvalumab (T300+D, n=393); Tremelimumab 75 mg x 4 + 
durvalumab (T75+D, n=153); and sorafenib (S, n=389). Randomisation was stratified according to 
macrovascular invasion (yes versus no), etiology of liver disease (hepatitis B virus [confirmed HBV] 
versus hepatitis C virus [confirmed HCV] versus others), and ECOG PS (0 versus 1). The stratification 
factors are considered clinically relevant as they are important prognostic factors for the outcome of 
uHCC. Other important prognostic factors could have been added, such as AFP levels; however, 
considering the size of the pivotal trial, it is considered appropriate to limit the number of stratification 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17771/2023  
Page 134/176 
 
 
 
 
 
 
factors to three. Additional supportive evidence of clinical efficacy was provided from study 22, a 
randomised, phase I/II, open-label study. 
The overall design of the pivotal Himalaya study is endorsed as it allows to assess the efficacy of the 
proposed dosing of tremelimumab single dose 300 mg + durvalumab 1500 mg iv followed by 
durvalumab monotherapy 1500 mg iv Q4W (T300+D) versus standard of care (Sorafenib - S) in the 
proposed first-line setting. Moreover, the applicant included a durvalumab monotherapy arm and an 
arm with another combination regimen of T75+D, which was abolished after some time.  
Baseline characteristics for patients included in the Himalaya study showed that the median age in the 
relevant arms (T300+D vs the S arm vs the T300+D arm of study 22) were 65 vs 64 vs 66 years of 
age; however, approximately half of the patients were <65 years of age and the vast majority of the 
patients were male (83.2% vs 86.6% vs 86.7%) and of white (46.3% vs 46% vs 36%) or Asian 
(49.6% vs 48.6% vs 58.7%) race.  Alcohol use was only registered in the pivotal Himalaya study and 
it is noted that a large proportion was never users (~40%) or former users (~45%). The baseline 
characteristics are well balanced between the arms, but only approximately 46% of the study 
population are considered EU like according to region and race characteristics. Moreover, the alcohol 
use in the study population is considered lower than for the EU population. 
Disease characteristics showed that most patients were ECOG PS 0 (~60%) and of advanced Barcelona 
Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage C (~80%). Additionally, macrovascular invasion and/or extrahepatic 
spread was observed for many (~65%). However, the poor prognostic factor of AFP >400 ng/ml was 
observed in approximately a third of the patients, which is also reflected by the distribution of the 
Child-Pugh score categories, showing that many of the included patients have a favourable prognosis.  
It is noted that only a third of the included patients had tumours that were PD-L1 positive (TIP≥1%) 
and that there were ~13% of the patients in the D+T containing arms, who had missing data on PD-L1 
status. Overall, the important disease characteristics are well distributed between the treatment arms. 
Regarding the level of poor prognostic factors, it is considered that these are lower than expected for 
the targeted patient population, which should be kept in mind when interpreting the results of the 
studies.   
The primary objective of the pivotal Himalaya study was to assess superiority of efficacy of T300+D vs 
standard of care (sorafenib) regarding OS for the ITT population. The two key secondary objectives of 
the trial were to assess non-inferiority of the efficacy of durvalumab monotherapy versus SoC 
(sorafenib) regarding OS and superiority of the efficacy of durvalumab monotherapy versus SoC 
(sorafenib) regarding OS. Other important secondary endpoints are PFS and overall response rate plus 
duration of response. The current MAA for tremelimumab is based on efficacy results from the primary 
objective of the pivotal study. The primary objective and key secondary objectives pertain to overall 
survival, and this is endorsed, considering the targeted patient population and the robustness of OS as 
an endpoint.  
Although it does not preclude a benefit/risk assessment, the overall conduct of the study is considered 
suboptimal due to the changes in primary endpoints and sample size especially considering the open 
label design.  Additionally, interpretation of radiological assessments of tumour response is hindered 
because of the lack of blinded central review of the assessments in the final analysis.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The pivotal Himalaya study: 
The primary objective was met as treatment with T300+D showed a statistically significant and 
clinically relevant improvement in OS compared to standard of care, sorafenib. Median OS was 
improved from 13.77 months to 16.43 months, HR 0.78 (96.02% CI: 0.65, 0.92). The analysis was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17771/2023  
Page 135/176 
 
 
 
performed after ~33 months of follow up and 66.7% of events in the T300+D arm and 75.3% events 
in the S arm, respectively, so the OS data are considered mature. The KM curves begin to separate 
after 4 months of therapy and stay separated.   
It is acknowledged that Himalaya was primarily designed to demonstrate superiority of T300+D vs S in 
terms of OS and was amended to demonstrate non-inferiority of D vs S for OS as the next analysis in 
the hierarchical testing. Moreover, the study design allowed for assessment of the contribution of 
tremelimumab to the combination regimen, through prespecified exploratory analyses of T300+D vs D, 
which showed an HR of 0.90 (95%CI: 0.76, 1.07) for OS, which was 16.43 months vs 16.56 months, 
respectively. The applicant has further argued that due to the complementary mechanisms of action of 
tremelimumab and durvalumab, the reduction in risk of death, more patients achieving a BOR of CR 
plus more durable responses in the T300+D arm that the addition of tremelimumab is justified. 
Additionally, a post-hoc analysis calculating piecewise constant treatment effects favoured T300+D 
independent of selected time interval when compared to either S or D, further illustrating the OS 
benefit offered by T300+D compared with D. . However, there are remaining uncertainties regarding 
the optimal dosing regimen e.g. would more than one single dose of tremelimumab have had a 
significant contribution to added efficacy compared to T300+D and is 300 mg the optimal dose or could 
the same efficacy and maybe a better safety profile have been obtained with several but lower doses 
of tremelimumab.  
The secondary endpoint of ORR by investigator was 20.1% for the T300+D arm compared to 5.1% in 
the sorafenib arm, while 3.1% of the patients in the T300+D arm had a complete response (CR) vs no 
patients in the S arm. Confirmed ORR by BIRC was slightly lower in the T300+D arm (18.8%), but this 
is not directly comparable with ORR by Investigator, since the evaluation was only done in a subset of 
patients. The improvement of the response rate both by INV and by BIRC is considered borderline 
clinically meaningful in its magnitude; however, the responders in the T300+D arm (n=79) had 
durable responses with a median DoR of 22.34 months. 
The PFS analyses were not in the testing hierarchy, so they are not controlled for multiplicity. PFS by 
investigator was not clinically significantly improved, since the median PFS was 3.78 months in the 
T300+D arm versus 4.07 months in the S arm; HR 0.90 (95%CI: 0.77, 1.05). The PFS analyses are 
mature with 85.2% and 84.1% events in the T300+D and S arms, respectively and the KM curves do 
not clearly separate at any time. This finding is considered consistent with the pattern of efficacy 
generally observed for immunotherapy, where PFS benefit is often lacking or of a small magnitude, 
while OS is often clinically significantly improved. Hence, this could be considered an acceptable result 
as the primary endpoint was OS, and that an OS benefit has been shown for the proposed treatment 
regimenT300+D vs S. 
However, there are uncertainties when interpreting PFS and ORR considering that the final analysis in 
an open label setting was done by investigators. Additionally, assessments were performed using 
RECIST 1.1. although in the immunotherapy setting, irRECIST may have been more appropriate/more 
informative. Nevertheless, rate of possible pseudoprogression of HCC with CTLA-4/PD-L1 inhibition is 
currently unknown, which creates uncertainty around PFS and ORR data, since patients with confirmed 
PD (according to RECIST 1.1) were discontinued from IP. Confirmation of PD required a follow-up scan 
evaluated by Confirmation of Radiological Progression criteria preferably at the next scheduled visit 
and no earlier than 4 weeks after the initial assessment of PD. In the HIMALAYA study, confirmation of 
PD was not mandatory as RECIST 1.1 used for final analysis does not require confirmation of 
progression and therefore was not done in the study. The lack of data on potential pseudoprogression 
is of concern as patients could be denied potentially beneficial treatment. This issue remains to be 
answered in clinical practice.

Additionally, assessments by BICR were performed only on a subset of patients evaluable for 32 weeks 
of follow up (for interim analysis 1), and included RECIST 1.1, irRECIST, and mRECIST. Following 
interim analysis 1, no further BICR assessments were performed. In view of the robustness of the 
primary endpoint (OS) the applicant’s approach regarding PFS can be accepted.  
The study design of Himalaya allowed for assessment of the contribution of tremelimumab to the 
combination regimen, through prespecified exploratory analyses of T300+D vs D, which showed an HR 
of 0.90 (95%CI: 0.76, 1.07) for OS, which was 16.43 months vs 16.56 months, respectively. The 
applicant has also provided a rationale for the addition of tremelimumab to durvalumab for the HCC 
indication, which is primarily based on the following: The combined blockade of CTLA-4 and PD-(L)1 to 
increase effector T-cell response through two distinct yet complementary mechanisms of action and an 
approximately 10% reduction in the average risk of death was observed with T300+D versus D. 
Moreover, while the objective response rates with T300+D and D were similar in HIMALAYA (20.1% vs. 
17.0%), twice as many BORs of CR were observed in HIMALAYA with T300+D (12 [3.1%]) compared 
to D (6 [1.5%]). 
The provided arguments are acknowledged and it is accepted that the applicant seeks an approval for 
the T300+D regimen. However, there remains to be unanswered questions to what would have been 
the optimal dosing regimen e.g. would more than one single dose of tremelimumab have had a 
significant contribution to added efficacy compared to T300+D and is 300 mg the optimal dose or could 
the same efficacy and maybe a better safety profile have been obtained with several but lower doses 
of tremelimumab. This remains to be unknown. 
PRO data was collected as a secondary endpoint. Since the pivotal study was open-label and PRO 
endpoints were not multiplicity-protected, clinical meaningfulness of PRO data is not considered 
relevant and the applicant has agreed to delete them from the SmPC. 
No additional information on changes in AFP were provided as these data were not collected in the 
HIMALAYA study.  
Relevant subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint of OS show that the benefit of T300+D vs S is 
maintained across important subgroups of age of less than or ≥ 65 years, HBV or other reasons for 
liver disease, ECOG performance status, macrovascular invasion (MVI), AFP at baseline and BCLB score 
C.  
The supportive Study 22: 
The supportive study 22 was a randomised, multicentre, open-label, multipart study designed to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of durvalumab and/or tremelimumab in patients with advanced HCC in 
the 2L+ setting. The study was comprised of multiple parts, but the results from the T300+D arm is 
considered of most relevance for the proposed indication (n=75), although the study randomised 
patients to 4 treatment arms. Patients were immunotherapy-naïve patients with advanced HCC, who 
had progressed on, were intolerant to, or refused treatment with sorafenib or another approved 
Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) TKI. Due to different stratification factors in Parts 
2A and 3 and lack of randomisation altogether in Part 2B, pooling of efficacy data is inappropriate. 
Fortunately, OS data from Part 2 and 3 is available separately as well. Although there were no interim 
analyses planned in the Original Protocol (09 April 2015), in the end 6 interim analyses were 
performed (and added through Protocol Amendments). 
Baseline data for the T300+D arm showed that the median age was 66 years and the vast majority of 
the patients were male (86.7%) and of white (36%) or Asian (58.7%) race. Disease characteristics 
show that the vast majority of patients were ECOC PS 0 (61.3%) and disease of advanced BCLC stage 
C (77.3%) plus macrovascular invasion and/or extrahepatic spread (77.3%).

In conclusion, Study 22 is an early phase, exploratory study that was amended several times. The 
primary objective of the study was to assess the safety and tolerability, whereas efficacy was a 
secondary objective and there was no hierarchical testing procedure or correction for multiplicity. The 
efficacy data quality should be viewed in this light. Moreover, out of the 75 patients in Study 22, who 
were treated with T300+D, only 55 patients had received prior treatment with sorafenib and were thus 
truly ‘second line’. Due to the lack of a SoC comparator arm in Study 22, there is no benchmark for the 
results of the T300+D study arm, as there is insufficient understanding of the relevance of the efficacy 
as observed in the other study arms. In addition, the exploratory design of Study 22 and in particular 
the lack of a SAP that would provide for formal comparisons between the study arms, hampers both 
the contextualisation and interpretation of the efficacy results obtained in these 55 patients. As a 
consequence, the time-to-event endpoints cannot be interpreted adequately. It is noted that the ORR 
in these 55 patients was only 20%, which cannot be considered dramatic (EMA/CHMP/205/95 Rev.5). 
The final analysis showed a median OS of 17 months (65.3% events) for patients who received the 
proposed dosing regimen of T300+D, while the ORR was 24% and the duration of response (DoR) was 
18 months. The applicant compares this result to durvalumab monotherapy; however, this is not 
approved for or is standard of care (SOC) in the 2L+ setting, so this comparison is not considered 
relevant for the current application. Since none of the arms of Study 22 contained any SOC, the results 
for the T300+D arm are considered supportive of efficacy for the proposed dosing regimen in the first-
line setting. 
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The results from the pivotal Himalaya study show a statistically significant and clinically relevant OS 
benefit over standard of care in the first-line setting of unresectable HCC.

The pivotal safety dataset used to characterise the safety profile of durvalumab in combination with 
tremelimumab in the proposed indication was derived from pooled data from HIMALAYA and Study 22. 
The populations in the HCC-tumour pools are described below: 
•  HCC T300+D pool: This population consists of all patients who have received at least 1 dose of 
durvalumab  given  at  a  dose  of  1500mg  IV  Q4W  (or  equivalent)  in  combination  with 
tremelimumab 300 mg IV x 1 dose (or equivalent) for HCC.

received high-dose corticosteroid treatment (at least 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day). Nine 
patients also received other immunosuppressants. Treatment was discontinued in 10 patients. 
Resolution occurred in 13 patients. 
- immune-mediated colitis or diarrhoea occurred in 31 (6.7%) patients, including Grade 3 in 17 (3.7%) 
patients. The median time to onset was 23 days (range: 2-479 days). All patients received systemic 
corticosteroids, and 28 of the 31 patients received high-dose corticosteroid treatment (at least 40 mg 
prednisone or equivalent per day). Four patients also received other immunosuppressants. Treatment

- immune-mediated rash or dermatitis (including pemphigoid) occurred in 26 (5.6%) patients, 
including Grade 3 in 9 (1.9%) patients and Grade 4 in 1 (0.2%) patient. The median time to onset was 
25 days (range: 2-933 days). All patients received systemic corticosteroids and 14 of the 26 patients 
received high-dose corticosteroid treatment (at least 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day). One 
patient received other immunosuppressants. Treatment was discontinued in 3 patients. Resolution 
occurred in 19 patients.  
Immune-mediated type 1 diabetes mellitus was observed in patients receiving Imjudo in combination

2.6.8.10.  Post marketing experience 
Tremelimumab is not yet approved for use in any country. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety population of interest are patients with unresectable HCC (uHCC), who have received the 
proposed dosing regimen of a single dose of Tremelimumab 300 mg + durvalumab in combination 
followed by durvalumab monotherapy (T300+D), which consists of 388 patients from the pivotal 
Himalaya study and 74 patients from the supportive study 22, in total 462 patients.  
The median treatment duration in the Himalaya study were 5.5 months, while the median treatment 
duration was 4.1 months in the Sorafenib arm (n=374). In the HCC pool, the median duration of 
exposure was 20 weeks and approximately 50% of patients received at least 24 weeks of treatment at 
DCO, while ~28% had 52 weeks of treatment. Hence, the exposure to the proposed regimen and the 
size of the safety database are considered sufficient for a safety assessment. 
Almost all patients in the HCC pool, who received T300+D, experienced at least one adverse event 
(AE) (97.6%), and 51.9% experienced a grade 3 or 4 AEs. For the Himalaya study, a similar pattern 
was observed in T300+D arm: 97.4% experienced at least one AE, 50.5% experienced a grade 3 or 4 
AE, and SAEs were observed in 40.5% of the patients, noting 7.7% had an SAE leading to death. The 
discontinuation rate due to AEs was 13.7%. In comparison, 95.5% of the patients in the Sorafenib arm 
also experienced at least one AE, and 52.4% experienced a grade 3 or 4 AE. SAEs were observed in 
29.7% of the patients, of which 7.2% had an SAE leading to death, while the discontinuation rate due 
to AEs was 16.8%.  
Treatment-related AEs or adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the T300+D arm of the pivotal Himalaya 
study were rash (19.6%), pruritus (17%), diarrhoea (16.5%), and hypothyroidism (10.8%). In 
comparison, common ADRs in the Sorafenib arm were diarrhoea (38.8%), palmar-plantar 
erythrodysaesthesia (PPE) (43.9%), hypertension (15%), and fatigue (14.7%). The most common 
grade 3 or 4 ADRs in the T300+D arm were increased lipase (4.4%), diarrhoea (3.4%), amylase 
increased (2.6%) and ASAT increased (2.3%). Common grade 3 or 4 ADRs in the S arm were PPE 
(8.8%), hypertension (5.3%), and diarrhoea (4%), so in comparison there are more high-grade 
toxicity with sorafenib in favour of T300+D.  
Adverse events of special interest for T300+D include immune-mediated AEs (imAEs) and as 
expected, the occurrence of imAEs are much more common in the HCC pool vs the Sorafenib arm 
(36.1% vs 7.5%), and these were of grade 3 or 4 in 13.4% vs 2.4% of the patients, respectively. 
Serious imAEs are considered common (10.2% vs 1.1%) and 6 patients (1.3%) died from these, while 
a quarter of the patients need systemic corticosteroids in the HCC pool versus only 4% in the Sorafenib 
arm. Moreover, many patients needed endocrine therapy, when treated with T300+D vs Sorafenib 
(14.9% vs 3.5%). It is noted that very few patients had to discontinue treatment due to imAEs (5.6% 
vs 1.6%), which is reassuring. Other common imAEs with T300+D were hepatic events (7.4%) and 
diarrhoea/colitis (6.5%). Grade 3 or 4 hepatic events (5%) and diarrhoea/colitis (3.7%) were the most 
frequent high-grade events, and these are difficult to manage in the clinic, so it is important that this is 
clear from the SmPC section 4.4, which is the case. Overall, imAEs were frequently reported and the 
number of AESIs and imAEs significantly differ for dermatitis/rash, pancreatic events, hepatic events, 
diarrhoea/colitis, hypothyroid and hyperthyroid events, pneumonitis. Some imAEs such as 
endocrinopathies, hepatotoxicity, dermatitis/rash are expected to be more manageable than others, 
such as diarrhoea/colitis, pancreatic events and pneumonitis. The latter are more difficult to manage, 
often require hospitalisation, and might not be assumed as immune-mediated events by clinicians.

Events of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients 
treated with PD-1 inhibitors and CTLA-4 inhibitors. Patients should be monitored for signs and 
symptoms of rash or dermatitis and managed through dose interruption, treatment discontinuation 
and/or corticosteroid treatment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Patients should be monitored for alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, 
and alkaline phosphatase levels prior to initiation of treatment and prior to each subsequent infusion. 
Additional monitoring is to be considered based on clinical evaluation. Patients should be monitored for 
abnormal renal function tests prior to and periodically during treatment. Patients should also be 
monitored for signs and symptoms of immune-mediated pancreatitis and myocarditis. Immune 
mediated hepatitis, nephritis, pancreatitis and myocarditis should be managed through dose 
interruption, treatment discontinuation and/or corticosteroid treatment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the 
SmPC). 
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Suspected pneumonitis should 
be confirmed with radiographic imaging and other infectious and disease-related aetiologies excluded, 
and managed through dose interruption, treatment discontinuation and corticosteroid treatment (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of colitis/diarrhoea and intestinal perforation and 
managed through dose interruption, treatment discontinuation and/or corticosteroid treatment (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Patients should be monitored for abnormal thyroid function tests prior to and periodically during 
treatment and as indicated based on clinical evaluation. Immune-mediated hypothyroidism, 
hyperthyroidism, and thyroiditis should be managed through dose interruption, symptomatic treatment 
or thyroid hormone replacement as clinically indicated (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Immune mediated adrenal insufficiency occurred in patients receiving Tremelimumab AstraZeneca in 
combination with durvalumab. Patients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of adrenal 
insufficiency. For symptomatic adrenal insufficiency, patients should be managed through dose 
interruption, corticosteroid treatment and hormone replacement (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the 
SmPC). 
Immune mediated type 1 diabetes mellitus, which can first present as diabetic ketoacidosis that can be 
fatal if not detected early, occurred in patients receiving tremelimumab in combination with 
durvalumab and chemotherapy. Patients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of type 1 
diabetes mellitus. For symptomatic type 1 diabetes mellitus, patients should be managed via treatment 
with insulin as clinically indicated (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC). 
Patients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of hypophysitis or hypopituitarism. For 
symptomatic hypophysitis or hypopituitarism, patients should be managed as recommended through 
dose interruption and corticosteroid treatment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Given the mechanism of action of tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab, other potential 
immune mediated adverse reactions may occur. The following immune-related adverse reactions have 
been observed in patients treated with tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab: myasthenia 
gravis, myositis, polymyositis, meningitis, encephalitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, immune 
thrombocytopenia and cystitis noninfective. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms and 
managed through dose interruption, treatment discontinuation and/or corticosteroid treatment (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Although the rate of imAEs with the T300+D is considered high, these are considered generally clinically 
manageable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17771/2023  
Page 167/176 
 
 
 
Patients should also be monitored for signs and symptoms of IRRs. IRRs should be managed through 
dose interruption, treatment discontinuation, prophylaxis and appropriate treatment (see sections 4.2 
and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) were very common in the T300+D arm vs the S arm in Himalaya 
study (40.5% vs 29.7%) and it is noted that 10% less SAEs were observed with durvalumab 
monotherapy, suggesting that the addition of the single dose of 300 mg tremelimumab significantly 
adds toxicity. The most frequent SAEs in the T300+D arm vs the S arm were diarrhoea (2.3% vs 
1.6%), sepsis (2.1% vs 0), and pneumonia (1.8% vs 2.1%). Overall, the high level of SAEs with 
T300+D is worrisome although the targeted patient population is previously untreated patients and 
this may influence the tolerability in the general patient population in the first-line setting. Of note, 
diarrhoea and colitis are important identified risks of the anti-CTLA-4 agent ipilimumab, which has a 
similar mechanism of action as tremelimumab. Moreover, the targeted patient population from the 2L+ 
setting is expected to have even more serious toxicity.   
AEs leading to death occurred in 34 patients (7.4%) in the HCC T300+D pool and 30 patients (7.7%) 
in the T300+D arm of the Himalaya study.  
The overall discontinuation rate due to AEs in the HCC pool was 13.6%, while it was 13.7% of the 
patients in the pivotal Himalaya study. Most commonly the patients discontinued treatment due to AST 
increased and diarrhoea, which reflects the safety profile of T300+D. Dose delays were very common 
in the patients who had T300+D in the HCC pool (32.3%) and mostly due to diarrhoea and increased 
liver enzymes. 
Laboratory findings showed that the changes in haematological parameters were mostly of low 
grade and pertaining to a decrease in lymphocytes ≥grade 2 for 20% of the patients and grade 3 or 4 
in 11.8%. This is in line with the findings in the pivotal Himalaya study. Laboratory shifts for clinical  
chemistry parameters were rare and mostly to low grade events. It is noted that increased glucose was 
common in the HCC pool (19.4%) and that grade 3 or 4 were observed in 14.6% of the patients. New 
onset diabetes mellitus was identified in 39 (8.4%) of 462 patients in the T300+D HCC pool and 30 
(6.1%) of 492 patients in the D monotherapy HCC pool. Eight (1.7%) SAE reports of hyperglycaemia 
occurred in the T300+D HCC pool and most patients did not receive therapy for the hyperglycaemic 
event and the reported events were resolved in 21 (4.5%) of the patients in the T300+D HCC pool. 
One patient with hyperglycaemia and one patient with T2DM discontinued treatment. Liver toxicity was 
very often observed regarding elevated hepatic laboratory parameters in the HCC pool. Potential Hy’s 
law cases were reported for 57 patients (12.3%) in the HCC pool and the narratives for the 4 patients, 
who met the Hy’s law criteria in the T300+D arm of the pivotal Himalaya study are all agreed.  
Increased toxicity with increasing age was observed in the HCC pool, as the incidence of ADRs were 
72.1% in the patients of <65 years of age vs 79.8% in patients of 65-75 years of age and 85.7% in 
those of ≥75 years of age. A trend towards more discontinuations with increasing age was also 
observed.  
Safety and tolerability profiles were similar in patients with ADAs and in those without ADAs. According 
to the applicant, there were no new types of events or events clearly suggestive or indicative of 
infusion reactions or immune complex disease. 
Overall, the toxicity observed in the first-line study Himalaya was significantly less than what was 
observed for the entire HCC pool, which is to be expected for the included study population, who was 
previously systemically untreated patients, who are usually more fit and able to tolerate toxicities. The 
toxicity observed with Sorafenib is similar to the toxicity level observed in the HCC pool and in some 
cases worse than what was observed for the T300+D arm of the Himalaya study. However, the toxicity

profiles of T300+D and Sorafenib differs due to different mechanisms of action mainly between 
immune checkpoint inhibition and a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The toxicity of the proposed dosing regimen of T300+D is considerable, since approximately half of the 
patients experience grade 3 or 4 adverse events and 40% of the patients have serious adverse events, 
mostly pertaining to diarrhoea and immune-mediated adverse events. The discontinuation rate is 
however relatively low (~13%) and most of the toxicity observed is clinically manageable and the 
toxicity profile of T300+D is not considered significantly worse than that of Sorafenib, the current 
standard of care.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 21.10.2022. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
A justification to consider the package leaflet user testing report for the POSEIDON MAA 
(EMEA/H/C/004650) as relevant for this application has been provided. This is considered acceptable 
on the basis of the similarities in the text of both package 
2.9.2.  Labelling exemptions  
A request to use minimum particulars on the labelling as per Art.63.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC has 
been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group. However the QRD 
Group would like the applicant to take note of the following remarks: 
•  Vial label: The short pharmaceutical form can be used as proposed on the multilingual label. 
However on the single language labels the full pharmaceutical form should be used. If not 
possible, ‘after dilution’ should be added next to the route of administration, i.e. “IV after 
dilution”. 
•  Outer carton: The statement “Keep out of the sight and reach of children” can be grey-shaded 
in Annex IIIA, and there is no need to print it on the actual carton as the product will be 
handled by healthcare professionals only. This will leave more space on the carton to improve 
readability of the rest of information. 
2.9.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Imjudo (tremelimumab) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU; 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of

new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The approved therapeutic indication is: 
IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab is indicated for the first line treatment of adults with advanced 
or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 
The aim of the applied dosing regimen of tremelimumab plus durvalumab (T300+D) in comparison to 
Sorafenib (SOC) in the targeted population is to prolong overall survival (OS). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The first-line treatment of uHCC includes sorafenib (a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor - TKI) based on OS 
benefit when compared to placebo (10.7 vs 7.9 months) and lenvatinib, another TKI, which is non-
inferior when compared to sorafenib (median OS 13.6 vs 12.3 months). Atezolizumab (a PD-L1 
inhibitor) in combination with bevacizumab (a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor) has 
also been approved in the first-line setting, based on the Phase III IMbrave150 study showing 
improvements of OS and PFS compared to sorafenib i.e. the median OS was 19.2 months with 
atezolizumab + bevacizumab vs 13.4 months with Sorafenib (HR, 0.66 [95%CI: 0.52, 0.85]), while the 
PFS by blinded review was 6.9 vs. 4.3 months (HR 0.65 [95%CI: 0.53, 0.81]).  
Despite recent advances in treatment options, patients with uHCC continue to have a short life 
expectancy and the underlying liver disease and portal vein hypertension increase the risk of 
gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be potentially life-threatening. Currently available therapies 
provide only a modest improvement in survival with safety profiles that require management due to 
adverse events such as diarrhoea, hypertension, and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia (PPE). 
Treatment with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab also carries a higher incidence of bleeding, including 
fatal bleeding, despite attempts to exclude patients at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding from the pivotal 
study. Moreover, the underlying liver cirrhosis may result in moderate liver dysfunction, which may 
exacerbate the toxicity of systemic therapies such as TKIs. Hence, additional therapeutic options are 
needed, including options for patients with uHCC, who are at higher risk of bleeding events, so there 
exist an unmet medical need for better and more tolerable treatment options for patients with uHCC. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The pivotal study Himalaya is a randomised, open-label, multicentre Phase III study in patients with 
unresectable HCC not eligible for locoregional therapy, which compared tremelimumab + durvalumab 
(T300+D) to standard of care, sorafenib, in the first-line setting. The primary endpoint was OS in the 
ITT population.  
Additional supportive evidence of clinical efficacy was provided from Study 22, a randomised, phase 
I/II, open-label study conducted in the 2L+ setting, comparing the efficacy of T300+D and durvalumab 
monotherapy.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary endpoint for the Himalaya study was met as treatment with T300+D showed a statistically 
significant improvement in overall survival (OS) compared to standard of care, Sorafenib.  
•  At data cutoff 27 August 2021 and after ~33 months of follow up, 66.7% OS events had 
occurred in the T300+D arm versus 75.3% OS events in the Sorafenib arm, treatment with 
T300+D showed a statistically significant survival benefit as compared with SoC: Median OS 
was improved from 13.77 months to 16.43 months, HR 0.78 (96.02% CI: 0.65, 0.93). 
• 
• 
The secondary endpoint of ORR by investigator was 20.1% for the T300+D arm compared to 
5.1% in the sorafenib arm, and the median duration of response was 22.34 months in the 
T300+D arm vs 18.43 months in the sorafenib arm. 
The PFS analyses were not controlled for multiplicity. PFS by investigator was not significantly 
improved, since the median PFS was 3.78 months in the T300+D arm versus 4.07 months in 
the S arm; HR 0.90 (95%CI: 0.77, 1.05). The event rates were 85.2% and 84.1% in the 
T300+D and S arms, respectively. 
•  Relevant subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint of OS show that the benefit of T300+D 
vs S is maintained across important subgroups of age of less than or ≥ 65 years, HBV or other 
reasons for liver disease, ECOG performance status, macrovascular invasion (MVI), AFP at 
baseline and BCLB score C. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
None.    
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety populations of interest are the 388 patients from the pivotal Himalaya study and the patients 
included in the HCC pool (n=462), which also contains patients from the supportive study 22. The 
median treatment duration in the Himalaya study were 5.5 months, while the median treatment 
duration was 4.1 months in the Sorafenib arm (n=374).  
Almost all of the patients in the HCC pool, who received T300+D, experienced at least one adverse 
event (AE) (97.6%), and 51.9% experienced a grade 3 or 4 AE. For the Himalaya study, a similar 
pattern was observed.  
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the T300+D arm of the pivotal Himalaya study were rash , 
pruritus , diarrhoea , and hypothyroidism. In comparison, common ADRs in the Sorafenib arm were 
diarrhoea, palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia (PPE), hypertension, and fatigue. The most common 
grade 3 or 4 ADRs in the T300+D arm were increased lipase, diarrhoea, amylase increased and ASAT 
increased. Common grade 3 or 4 ADRs in the S arm were PPE, hypertension, and diarrhoea.  
Adverse events of special interest for T300+D include immune-mediated AEs (imAEs) and as 
expected, the occurrence of imAEs are much more common in the HCC pool vs the Sorafenib arm 
(36.1% vs 7.5%), and these were of grade 3 or 4 in 13.4% vs 2.4% of the patients, respectively. 
Serious imAEs were observed in 10.2% vs 1.1% and 6 patients (1.3%) died from these.  
The most common serious adverse reactions in the T300+D HCC pool are colitis (2.6%), diarrhoea 
(2.4%), pneumonia (2.2%), and hepatitis (1.7%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17771/2023  
Page 172/176 
 
 
 
In the pivotal Himalaya study, 6.1% of the patients in the T300+D arm died from an adverse event, 
while it was 7.4% in the HCC pool.  
The overall discontinuation rate due to ADRs was 6.5%. Most commonly the patients discontinued 
treatment due to ADRs of hepatitis (1.5%) and aspartate aminotransferase increased/alanine 
aminotransferase increased (1.3%).  
Laboratory findings showed that the changes in haematological parameters and clinical chemistry 
were mostly to low grade events. It is noted that increased glucose was common in the HCC pool 
(19.4%) and that grade 3 or 4 were observed in 14.6% of the patients. Liver toxicity was often 
observed regarding elevated hepatic laboratory parameters in the HCC pool and potential Hy’s law 
cases were reported for 57 patients (12.3%) in the HCC pool.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There are very limited safety data on elderly aged 75 years and older (see section 4.8 of the SmPC).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The proposed dosing regimen of tremelimumab + durvalumab provides a statistically significant and 
clinically meaningful survival benefit compared to the current standard of care, sorafenib, in a head-to-
head comparison from the pivotal Himalaya study, in a population of patients with unresectable 
hepatocellular carcinoma, who had not received prior systemic treatment. The ORR was also 
significantly improved; however, the magnitude of patients who had an objective response with 
T300+D is still low (~20%). The few objective responses were durable (~22 months), which is 
considered clinically significant. Hence, the efficacy of T300+D in the first-line setting could be 
considered shown.  Supportive evidence for the application comes from Study 22, which compared 
T300+D to durvalumab monotherapy in the 2L+ setting. 
The safety profiles of T300+D versus sorafenib are distinct as they have different mechanisms of 
action (immune checkpoint inhibition vs TKI) and the toxicity does not seem worse than sorafenib 
regarding grade 3 or 4 AEs (50.5% vs 52.4%), AEs leading to discontinuation (13.7% vs 16.8%), and 
AEs leading to death (7.7% vs 7.2%) as reported in the pivotal Himalaya study. The safety profile of 
tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab in the HCC setting is serious and has to be weighed 
against the seriousness of palliative setting and individual patient (ECOG status, age, comorbidities). 
This is of particular importance since a significant proportion of the immune-mediated adverse events 
observed with the T300+D regimen were serious (e.g. diarrhoea/colitis, pancreatitis and pneumonitis), 
expected to be less manageable and often require hospitalisation. Immune-mediated AEs have 
therefore been included as important identified risks in the list of safety concerns for tremelimumab. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The shown overall survival benefit and the fact that the safety profile of T300+D is not worse than that 
of standard of care, sorafenib, support a positive benefit-risk balance in the first-line treatment setting 
of advanced, unresectable HCC.

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit /risk balance of tremelimumab + durvalumab in the first line treatment of uHCC is 
positive, subject to the conditions stated in section ‘Recommendations’.

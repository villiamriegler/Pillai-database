Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for lenalidomide, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
The signal of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) was raised by the 
PRAC in the previous PSUR. Cumulatively, the review performed by the MAH retrieved 56 cases of 
DRESS, all serious, none fatal, mainly in multiple myeloma (MM) indication (76.8%), from post 
marketing reporting (50.0%). The event resolved/was resolving in 73.2% of cases and impacted 
lenalidomide treatment in 89.2 % of cases. Using the RegiSCAR criteria, 23 of the 56 cases (41.1%) 
were probable (score 4-5) or definite DRESS syndrome (score >5) and 16 cases (28.6%) were 
considered possible DRESS (score 2-3). 31 cases reported organ involvement (55.3%). Two (2) of the 
56 cases reported a positive rechallenge, despite confounding factors. Among the 54 remaining cases, 
a total of 36 cases reported positive dechallenge. Despite confounding prior/concomitant treatment 
reported in 33 of the total 56 cases (including sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (39.3%) and allopurinol 
(18.0%)), 4 of the 36 cases with positive dechallenge were highly suggestive for causal relationship 
with lenalidomide, considering diagnosis criteria, suggestive time to occurrence, absence of alternative 
root cause reported, and concurrent HHV-6 reactivation. Regarding both cases from clinical studies, 
one was highly confounded by co-suspect strontium renalate treatment. In the second case, with 
concurrent co-suspect allopurinol, the causal relationship between lenalidomide and DRESS cannot be 
excluded in this well documented case. No further significant information was raised from the 
remaining 16 cases providing insufficient information. 
Based on the high number of cases, all serious, 40% of cases with diagnosis according to the 
RegiSCAR criteria and the causal relationship with lenalidomide being highly probable, including cases 
with positive rechallenge / dechallenge this signal is considered confirmed and the Product Information 
shouldbe updated accordingly.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for lenalidomide the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing lenalidomide is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

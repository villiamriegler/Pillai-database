Section 4.4 
Section 4.5 
CYP2C9 substrates 
Berotralstat is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9 increasing the 
Cmax and AUC of tolbutamide by 19% and 73%, 
respectively. No dose adjustment is recommended for 
concomitant use of medicines that are predominantly 
metabolised by CYP2C9 (e.g. tolbutamide) (see section 
5.2). 
The effect of berotralstat on the CYP2C9 conversion of 
desogestrel to etonogestrel (active metabolite) was 
negligible. No dose adjustment is recommended for 
concomitant use of desogestrel. 
For more information, please refer to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics and PL changes.

1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Introduction  
Menveo is a quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine containing serogroups A, C, W135, and Y 
(henceforth referred to as MenACWY).  MenACWY uses pre-sized oligosaccharides from each of the 
primary pathogenic serogroups (A, C, W135, and Y) conjugated to the CRM197 protein carrier. The final 
formulation contains 10-5-5-5 μg per oligosaccharide of N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y 
respectively, without an adjuvant. 
MenACWY is currently indicated for active immunization of children, adolescents (from 2 years of age) 
and adults at risk of exposure to Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W135 and Y, to prevent invasive 
disease. The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.  
The vaccine is presented in the form of one vial containing the lyophilised MenA conjugate component 
plus excipients, and one syringe or one vial containing the liquid MenCWY conjugate component plus 
excipients. The pharmaceutical form is powder and solution for solution for injection. An additional 
immediate packaging for MenCWY liquid finished product (3mL glass vial with a 13 mm stopper and 
flip-off) in addition to the approved syringe was approved in March 2011. 
A number of Scientific Advices were held with EMA to discuss the clinical development of Menveo, 
including the development in infants from 2-23 months of age. In May 2009 the latest Scientific Advice 
was received from CHMP (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/288055/2009). The main outcomes for the clinical 
program in this population were: 
1. 
2. 
The safety database was considered acceptable in accordance with the guideline on clinical 
evaluation of new vaccines. 
The overall primary endpoint hSBA titre of >1:8 should be considered for initially seronegative 
subjects, whereas a fourfold rise in hSBA titre should be considered as primary endpoint for 
initially seropositive subjects. Novartis agreed to the pre-existing immunity in the evaluation of 
seroresponses in subjects 2 years and above but not infants and toddlers for which Novartis 
argued that pre-existing antibodies measured using the hSBA were either of maternal origin (in 
infants at 2 months of age) or non-existing (in older infants and toddlers). For this younger 
age group, this approach was also taken to align with requests from other regulatory agencies. 
3. 
CHMP recommended using an active comparison with MenC Conjugate vaccine in this age 
group. Accordingly, a new EU infant/toddler study (V59P22) was included in the Menveo clinical 
program. The revised proposed program in subjects below 2 years of age was considered 
acceptable. 
4. 
Previously, it was also indicated that at 12 months of age rapid waning of bactericidal 
antibodies was considered a major concern and was requested to be addressed in the infant 
program. This evaluation of the persistence of bactericidal antibodies is ongoing and is an 
integral part of the Menveo clinical development program as well as an assessment of the need 
for, and timing of, a booster dose. 
1.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP.

1.3.  Clinical aspects 
1.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The MAH stated that trials were performed with the ethical principles that are consistent with Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) and according to the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) 
guidelines. The MAH has also provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside 
the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
In May 2012 the CHMP was informed of GCP issues identified for one study site included in study 
V59P22. An updated Clinical Study Report was submitted in June 2012. The safety data collected at 
one site was not in line with expectations as only very few adverse events were reported. Moreover, 
diary cards appeared unused. The outcome of an EMA inspection (for different study and 
investigational product, study V70P5) was that use of the data from that site was not recommended. 
Consequently, the MAH decided to exclude all data from the affected site from the analysis in the study 
report also for study V59P22.  
Further to this, the MAH informed CHMP in November 2012 of further GCP issues with a site 
participating in the other three phase III studies included in this submission (V59P14, V59P21, 
V59P23). The problems concerned the source documentation and that specifically the rates of diary 
card return & recall were ‘much lower’ than what was communicated verbally during the study. This 
concerned the reporting of reactogenicity alone and the reporting of unsolicited adverse events was not 
affected, according to the MAH. As a result the MAH decided to remove information on solicited 
adverse events from this site from the analyses. 
The MAH confirmed that all study sites in the present submission were monitored for GCP compliance. 
In addition, internal audits took place in line with the audit program and audit certificates were 
provided as part of the submission. Based on these activities, the MAH confirmed that other than the 
instances noted to EMA or in the Clinical Study Reports, the studies were conducted in compliance with 
GCP.

1.3.2.  Clinical efficacy 
1.3.2.1.  Dose response studies 
The dose-response studies were submitted and assessed with the initial MAA. A short summary of the 
main findings is provided below. 
Studies V59P2, V59P4, V59P7 
The selection of the MenACWY 10-5-5-5 dose was based on the results of study V59P2. This study 
planned to enrol 600 toddlers aged 12 to 16 months into one of six vaccination groups. Four groups 
received one injection of aluminium phosphate-adjuvanted MenACWY with the dose of each serogroup 
ranging from 2.5 μg to 10 μg. Based on preclinical data indicating the possibility of interference 
between the serogroup A antigen and the other serogroups, the study included a fifth group, which 
was administered MenCWY containing 10 μg of three serogroups C, W, and Y (MenCWY 10-10-10), 
while the control group was administered monovalent meningococcal serogroup C CRM197 conjugate 
vaccine Menjugate (MenC). A subset received a second vaccination of the previously received dose.  
There was no evidence of interference or reduction in immunogenicity of the ACWY10 vaccine against 
any of the four serogroups by reason of the presence of the A antigen. 
Study V59P4 planned to enrol 225 toddlers (aged 12 to 16 months) to evaluate the immunogenicity 
and safety of MenACWY 5-5-5-5 formulated with and without aluminium phosphate adjuvant and non-
adjuvanted MenACWY 10-10-10-10. In addition, a licensed polysaccharide meningococcal ACWY 
vaccine (Menomune) was administered to a planned group of 75 children aged 3 to 5 years as an 
immunogenicity comparator group. hSBA geometric mean titres (GMTs) were used in study V59P4 to 
assess the impact of the inclusion of the adjuvant. Baseline hSBA GMTs were very low or undetectable 
in all groups. One month after vaccination, no statistically significant (p> 0.05 in each pairwise test) 
difference in hSBA GMTs between the non-adjuvanted and adjuvanted groups was observed. Regarding 
the tolerability and safety, no noteworthy differences between the adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted 
MenACWY vaccine were seen. Both formulations were well tolerated. 
Study V59P7 planned to enrol 600 subjects: 400 children aged 12 to 35 months were to receive 
MenACWY 10-5-5-5 formulated with or without adjuvant and 200 subjects aged 36 to 59 months were 
to receive either non-adjuvanted MenACWY 10-5-5-5 or a meningococcal polysaccharide ACWY vaccine 
(Mencevax). All subjects were to receive a second vaccination of adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted 
MenACWY 10-5-5-5 at 1, 6, or 12 months after the first injection. Baseline hSBA GMTs were very low 
or undetectable in all groups. One month after vaccination no statistically significant difference in hSBA 
GMTs between the non-adjuvanted and adjuvanted groups was observed. Both MenACWY Ad+ and Ad- 
were well tolerated with a lower local reactogenicity profile compared to polysaccharide MenACWY. No 
unexpected unsolicited or otherwise clinically significant adverse events (AEs) related to the vaccines 
administered were reported in this study. No deaths occurred in the study. 
In conclusion, the final formulation contains 10-5-5-5 μg of oligosaccharide of N. meningitidis 
serogroups A, C, W, and Y, respectively, without an adjuvant. 
Study V59P5, infant dosing regimen 
V59P5 was a phase 2, randomised, open label, controlled, multicenter trial conducted in the UK and 
Canada during 2004-2006 to assess the tolerability and immunogenicity of either 2 doses (at 2 and 4 
months) or 3 doses of Menveo administered concomitantly with routine infant immunization schedules 
in the UK (at 2, 3, 4 months of age) and Canada (at 2, 4, 6 months of age). Additionally, subjects were 
evaluated for the persistence of antibodies at 12 months of age and received either no further 
Assessment report

vaccinations, another dose of investigational meningococcal conjugate vaccine or a reduced dose 
(1/5th of the total quantity) of a meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (Menomune) (MPSV4) as an 
“immunologic probe” for demonstration of memory. Overall, 601 subjects were enrolled in the study 
and received at least 1 vaccination. 
Originally the formulation used in this trial was 10-5-5-5 µg with an aluminium phosphate adjuvant 
(Ad+). After regulatory feedback during the course of the trial, the study was amended to also include 
non-concurrently enrolled groups to receive the formulation 10-5-5-5 µg without adjuvant. Not all 
schedules were repeated with the unadjuvanted formulation (e.g., no group received the unadjuvanted 
final formulation vaccine at 2, 4, and 6 months of age). Ultimately, no clinically meaningful benefit was 
observed with inclusion of the adjuvant with similar immune responses for all serogroups when 
administered with the same dosing regimen. For this reason, in order to provide a complete analysis of 
dosing regimen selection, the text below includes discussion of study groups that received either the 
adjuvanted or the unadjuvanted formulation.  
Immunogenicity results 
The decision to pursue a dosing regimen of Menveo administration at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age 
was based on the following results from study V59P5: 
•  Higher percentages of infants achieved an hSBA ≥ 1:8 at one month after vaccination at 2, 4, and 
6 months of age (76% for serogroup A, 98% for C, 96% for W, 89% for Y) than at one month after 
vaccination at 2 and 4 months of age (49% for A, 89% for C, 92% for C, and 86% for Y). 
•  At 12 months of age, infants who had received three doses of Menveo at 2, 4 and 6 months 
showed better persistence of response (hSBA 1:8: 23% for A, 65% for C, 73% for W, 77% for Y) 
than did those who had received 2 doses at 2 and 4 months (hSBA  1:8: 3% for A, 25% for C, 
54% for W, 53% for Y). 
• 
For both regimens, a further dose at 12 months of age boosted hSBA 1:8 responses to between 
86% and 100% for all serogroups. 
The 3-dose primary course thus provided more protection over the second 6 months of life than did 
the 2-dose regimen, where responses waned considerably, especially against the A serogroup. In both 
cases, a 12-month dose then boosted responses to high levels. 
Study V59P5 involved more vaccine groups than described above.  As previously mentioned, most of 
the vaccine groups in study V59P5 received MenACWY Ad+. However one group (UK 2,4-) received 
Menveo without adjuvant (but with polysorbate) at 2, 4 and 12 months and another group received 
Menjugate at the same time points. Since this study provides only one comparison between 
monovalent conjugated MenC vaccine and Menveo for the infant primary series these results are 
presented in the table below.

1.3.2.2.  Main studies 
Three of the phase III studies were efficacy studies – V59P14, V59P21 and V59P22. Even though the 
specific study designs, objectives and the populations under study varied, the basic methodology for 
the clinical development plan for MenACWY was consistent across all studies. 
Methods 
Study Participants 
Male and female subjects had to be in good health, born after full term pregnancy with an estimated 
gestational age ≥37 weeks and a birth weight ≥2.5 kg, and should not have received any prior 
vaccination against meningococci of groups ACWY or have any history of meningococcal infections. Age 
ranges in specific (immunogenicity) studies are presented in the following table: 
Table 3.  Age ranges included in phase III studies

V59P21 
V59P22 
2 months old (55 – 89 days, inclusive) 
7 to 9 months old 
6 to 8 months old, inclusive 
In study V59P14 subjects should not have received childhood vaccines under investigation (DTP, IPV, 
OPV, Hib, Pneumococcal) or have had previous suspected or confirmed disease caused by, or were 
exposed to person with laboratory confirmed infection with, infectious agents in above named 
vaccines.  In study V59P21 subjects should have received complete primary vaccination with 
recommended licensed vaccines, vaccination with rotavirus vaccine Rotateq was not required for study 
entry. In study V59P22 subjects should have received three doses of both heptavalent conjugate 
pneumococcal (Prevenar) and DTaP-Hib-HBV-IPV (Infanrix-hexa) vaccines at least 30 days before 
study entry. 
Treatments 
In the different phase III studies subjects were randomised to receive MenACWY according to different 
dosing schedules, with different concomitant vaccines, or to receive a comparator vaccine (CRM197 
conjugated monovalent meningococcal serotype C vaccine Menjugate (MenC)). 
Objectives 
Primary objectives for the different studies were: 
V59P14: 
—  To assess the immunogenicity of four doses of MenACWY given to infants at 2, 4, 6 and 
12 months of age as measured by the percentage of subjects with serum bactericidal activity 
using human complement (hSBA) ≥1:8, directed against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W 
and Y (US subjects, group Ia). 
—  To compare the immunogenicity of the fourth dose of MenACWY given at 12 months of age in 
subjects who previously received three doses of MenACWY given at 2, 4 and 6 months of age 
to the immunogenicity of a single dose of MenACWY given to naïve subjects at 12 months of 
age, as measured by the ratio of GMTs, directed against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, 
and Y (US subjects).

V59P21: 
—  To compare the immune responses of measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine 
(ProQuad) when concomitantly administered with MenACWY vaccine to that of ProQuad vaccine 
when given alone to healthy young children aged 12 months, as measured by seroconversion 
rates to measles, mumps, and rubella, as well as seroprotection rates for varicella.  
—  To compare the immune responses of two doses of MenACWY given to healthy young children 
at 7 to 9 and 12 months of age, when MenACWY is either concomitantly administered with 
ProQuad vaccine given at 12 months of age or when MenACWY is given alone, as measured by 
percentage of subjects with serum bactericidal activity using human complement (hSBA) ≥1:8 
directed against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y. 
—  To assess the immunogenicity of two doses of MenACWY given to healthy young children at 
7 to 9 and 12 months of age as measured by the percentage of subjects with serum 
bactericidal activity using hSBA ≥1:8 directed against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135, 
and Y. 
V59P22: 
—  To assess and compare the immunogenicity of one dose of MenACWY to one dose of MenC 
given to healthy toddlers at 12 months of age as measured by the percentage of subjects with 
serum bactericidal activity using human complement (hSBA) ≥1:8 against N. meningitidis 
serogroup C.  
Secondary objectives included: 
—  To assess the immunogenicity of childhood vaccines (incl. boosters) given concomitantly or 
without MenACWY (non-inferiority) or Menjugate (V59P22) at different ages. 
—  To assess the persistence of bactericidal antibodies (up to 6-18 months). 
—  To assess the immunogenicity of MenACWY vs Menjugate as measured by rSBA (GMTs, 
fourfold increase, % with rSBA ≥ 1:128 and rSBA ≥ 1:8). 
—  To assess and compare the immunogenicity of two doses of MenACWY given to infants at 6 to 
8 and 12 months of age to a single dose of MenC given to toddlers at 12 months of age as 
measured by hSBA GMTs, percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 and hSBA ≥1:4, directed 
against N. meningitidis serogroup C. 
In general, the safety objective of the different studies was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 
MenACWY and concomitant vaccines in all study subjects. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The following endpoints were included in the analyses of all pivotal studies conducted to support 
MenACWY licensure in this application: 
—  hSBA ≥ 1:8; 
—  hSBA Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs); 
—  Reverse Cumulative Distribution Function (RCDF) curves 
Two of the pivotal studies used also ‘adequacy’ of immune response for estimating the immune 
response to the 4-dose MenACWY series in infants (V59P14) and to 2-dose series in older infants 
(V59P21).

Sample size 
Sample size calculations differed for each study, considering dependent on the randomisation ratio and 
stratification of enrolment. 
Randomisation 
In study V59P22 subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the vaccination groups 
following a randomisation list.  
For study V59P14 randomisation was done in a 2:1 ratio (MenACWY + routine infant vaccines: routine 
infant vaccines only). Within each region (US and Latin America), two randomisation lists were utilised, 
one for immunogenicity and one for safety. Each of the four randomisation lists was stratified by study 
site. 
In V59P21 subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either Group I or II. Simultaneously, subjects 
who were 12 months old at the time of enrolment were entered into the open label Group III. 
Blinding (masking) 
All studies were designed as open-label studies; both the study personnel and the subject (subject's 
guardian(s)) knew which vaccine was being administered. The serological laboratories were blinded to 
study group in studies V59P21 and V59P22.

Statistical methods 
Analysis Populations 
In pivotal studies the analysis populations were defines as: 
•  All Enrolled Population: all subjects who signed an informed consent, underwent screening 
procedures and were randomised (V59P14, V59P21, V59P22). 
•  Exposed Population: all enrolled subjects who actually received a study vaccination (V59P14, 
V59P21, V59P22). 
•  Modified Intention-to-treat (MITT) Population:  
− 
Immune Response One Month after Vaccination at 12 Months of Age: all subjects in the ITT 
population who actually received a study vaccination, and provided at least one evaluable 
serum sample after vaccination (V59P22). 
−  Antibody Persistence: all subjects in the ITT population who actually received a study 
vaccination, and provided at least one evaluable serum sample after vaccination, and provided 
an evaluable serum sample at 6-12 months after vaccination at 12 months of age (V59P22). 
− 
− 
Immunogenicity – MMRV analysis: all subjects who actually received a study vaccination, 
provided at least one evaluable serum sample before and after vaccination, and were 
seronegative at baseline for any of the four antigens (V59P21). 
Immunogenicity – MenACWY analysis: all subjects who actually received a study vaccination 
and provided at least one evaluable serum sample after vaccination (V59P21). 
• 
Per-protocol (PP) Population: 
− 
− 
Immune Response one Month after Vaccination at 12 Months of Age: all subjects in the MITT 
population who received all the relevant doses of vaccine correctly, and  provided evaluable 
serum samples at the relevant time points, and had no major protocol deviation prior to 
database lock (V59P22). 
Immunogenicity: all subjects in the MITT population, who received all the relevant doses of 
vaccine correctly, provided evaluable serum samples at the relevant time points, had no major 
protocol deviation prior to database lock (V59P14). For study V59P21 subjects also had to be 
seronegative at baseline for any of the four antigens (MMRV analyses only). 
−  Antibody Persistence: all subjects in the MITT population, who received all the relevant doses 
of vaccine correctly, provided evaluable serum samples relevant time point, and had no major 
protocol deviation prior to database lock (V59P22). 
•  Safety population: all subjects in the exposed population who provided post-baseline safety data. 
If a subject received an entirely wrong vaccine schedule, the subject was to be analysed for safety 
according to the group the subject actually followed.  
All immunogenicity analyses in this application were performed on the per protocol (PP) population. 
Comparisons (please also see section on endpoints) 
The primary criteria for immunogenicity in study V59P22 was that the lower limit of the two-sided 95% 
confidence interval (CI) was greater than -10% for the difference between one dose of MenACWY and 
Menjugate, as measured by the percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 for serogroup C at 1 month 
following the vaccination at 12 months of age (Group II vs. Group III). 
Assessment report  
EMA/322985/2013  
Page 16/67 
 
 
 
 
The GMTs, GMRs, two-sided 95% CIs, and median, minimum and maximum values were calculated for 
each vaccine group within each serogroup. The GMTs, GMRs and two-sided 95% CIs were constructed 
by exponentiation (base 10) of the least square means of the logarithmically transformed (base 10) 
titres and their 95% CIs obtained from a two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with vaccination group 
and study centre as factors. Titres below the limit of detection were set to half that limit for the 
purposes of the analysis. 
In study V59P14 the percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 and associated two-sided 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) were computed for each serogroup in US1A. The criterion for assessment was the lower 
limit of the two-sided 95% CI be greater than or equal to 80%, 85%, 85% and 85% for MenA, MenC, 
MenW and MenY, respectively. The second primary criteria for immunogenicity was that the lower limit 
of the two-sided 95% CI for the ratio of the GMT of a fourth dose at 12 months of age after receiving 
MenACWY at 2, 4, and 6 months of age compared to the GMT of a single dose at 12 months of age 
(GMTUS1A / GMTUS2) is ≥ 2.0. 
In study V59P21 the immune response to measles, mumps, rubella and varicella at six weeks following 
vaccination with one dose of MMRV given concomitantly with MenACWY was considered non-inferior to 
the immunogenicity of MMRV administered alone if the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI of the 
difference in the percentage of subjects with seroconversion for measles, mumps, and rubella, and 
seroprotection for varicella at 6 weeks after MMRV vaccination was greater than -5% for measles, 
mumps and rubella and was greater than –10% for varicella (Group I vs. Group III). The immune 
response of MenACWY given concomitantly with MMRV (Group I) was considered non-inferior to the 
immunogenicity of MenACWY administered alone (Group II) if the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI 
around the difference of the percentage of subjects with hSBA≥1:8 at 6 weeks after the second dose of 
MenACWY given to 12-month old toddlers was greater than -10% for each serogroup (Group I vs. 
Group II at Visit 4). 
To show adequacy of immune response for the two-dose MenACWY series, the lower limit of the two-
sided 95% CI for the percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 at 6 weeks following the second dose of 
MenACWY needed to be greater than 85% for serogroups C, W, or Y and greater than 65% for 
serogroup A.

Conduct of the study 
V59P22 
In total there were 5 protocol amendments, 4 of which were after start of enrolment. Major changes 
included extension of the enrolment age to 6-8 months, addition of study sites in Australia, increase of

the sample size from 600 to 660, inclusion of rSBA analyses. In addition, an ad hoc analysis was 
performed on the primary endpoint taking into account serostatus at baseline.  
Following the identification of GCP issues at one site  the MAH decided to exclude all data from the 
affected site from the analysis and submitted a revised Clinical Study Report for study V59P22. As 
there were clear doubts regarding the reliability of data from this centre, the decision to not to take 
into account in the analysis the data from this site was supported by the CHMP. The main findings and 
conclusions of the trial remained unaffected, namely non-inferiority to a monovalent conjugated MenC 
vaccine could not be demonstrated. Findings from study V59P22 remain valid. The questioned study-
site was only used for studies V59P22 and V59P22e1. The scientific discussion will include the analysis 
of data after removal of the data from the concerned site from both studies. 
V59P14 
There were 7 protocol amendments. Major amendments resulted from regulatory feedback and 
included the addition of a second primary endpoint (dated 03/04/2007) to assess the response to a 4 
dose schedule (2, 4, 6 and 12 months), and a revision of primary endpoints (dated 27/05/2008) for all 
serogroups to evaluate the percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 one month post-4th dose instead of 
one month post-3rd dose. With the revision of the primary endpoint to support a 4 dose series, the 
control arms (US4 and LA6) were revised to delay the first administration of MenACWY to 13 months, 
providing a control group through one month after the completion of the series. In a later amendment 
(dated 07/08/2011) subjects in groups US4 and LA6 were to receive their 1st MenACWY at 18 months 
(US4C and LA6C). 
In US immunogenicity subjects (US1A, US1B, US1 and US2) 52% to 65% reported major protocol 
deviations with US2 subjects reporting highest percentages (mostly subjects not providing a baseline 
blood sample). In the LA immunogenicity subjects 26% - 49% of subjects reported at least one major 
protocol deviation (highest in LA2). Many subjects (up to 25%) had their blood draw out of window at 
visit 6 which was considered to be a major protocol deviation. 
V59P21 
There were 5 protocol amendments, 4 after start of enrolment. The most significant changes occurred 
due to an interruption in ProQuad supply, which suspended study enrolment for nearly six months. The 
delayed study timelines resulted in extreme difficulty in completing enrolment once study enrolment 
resumed, allowing M-M-R II and Varivax as substitution for ProQuad administration (protocol 
amendments 3 and 4). Study enrolment was subsequently terminated on 18 December 2009 prior to 
fully enrolling 610 subjects into each group (actual numbers enrolled were 504, 510, and 616 into 
Groups I, II, and III, respectively). The primary change in amendment 5 (dated 04/03/2010) was 
addition of a main analysis to facilitate regulatory filing once the final immunogenicity data have been 
completed. 
Enrolment at two sites was terminated prematurely:  
•  At one site pending implementation of appropriate corrective action plans by the Investigator to 
address issues of GCP compliance identified during the conduct of another Novartis Vaccines trial;  
•  At another site due to concerns regarding appropriate payment of subjects for study visits. 
Major protocol deviations were recorded in 365 subjects: 139 [28%] in the MenACWY + MMRV group, 
133 [26%] in the MenACWY group and 93 [15%] in the MMRV group. Differences in the number of 
protocol deviations were related to different study procedures and number of visits for the different 
groups.

females were similar across all groups. The mean age was 8.5 ± 0.8 months in the MenACWY + MMRV 
and MenACWY groups where the first vaccination was at 7 to 9 months of age and it was 12.1 ± 
0.3 months in the MMRV group where the first vaccination was at 12 months of age. Weight and height 
were similar between MenACWY + MMRV and MenACWY groups, and were greater in MMRV group 
where the children were older.

A total of 662 subjects were enrolled and randomized (219 in Group I, 228 in Group II and 215 in 
Group III). Overall, 68 subjects enrolled in site 18 (23 subjects in Group I, 23 subjects in Group II and 
22 subjects in Group III) were excluded from safety and immunogenicity analyses. One subject from 
Group 1 withdrew consent prior to study vaccination. 
Study V59P14 
For the US immunogenicity groups the PP population included 323 subjects from the infant series and 
267 subjects after toddler vaccination. The MITT and PP populations for the infant series differed by 
not more than 5% while the MITT and PP populations for toddler vaccination differed by not more than 
10%. A total of 900 subjects were enrolled in the immunogenicity groups LA1, LA2, LA3 and LA4. The 
PP population included 825 subjects from the infant series and 629 subjects after toddler vaccination. 
The MITT and PP populations for the infant series differed by not more than 4% while the MITT and PP 
populations for toddler vaccination differed by more than 10%. The difference was mainly due to many 
(up to 25%) subjects having their post-toddler vaccination blood draw out of window (visit 7 blood 
draw for the LA4 group, and visit 6 blood draw for all other groups) which was in turn due to several 
amendments affecting the sampling time points.

For MenACWY to be found non-inferior to MenC (Menjugate) the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the 
difference between the percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 for serogroup C had to be greater than –10%. 
Results from this analysis demonstrate that the lower limit of the 95% CI group difference was not greater than -
10%, therefore the primary endpoint was not met. 
In order to provide a more complete understanding of the immune response to the investigational 
vaccine, and to provide comparative data to other studies conducted by the MAH and other sponsors, 
an additional secondary objective to test a subset of sera using the bactericidal assay with rabbit 
complement was added prior to database lock. The key immunogenicity analysis for rabbit SBA (i.e., a 
four-fold rise) did not achieve the non-inferiority criteria but again elicited relatively similar results for 
the two study groups. After MenACWY vaccination (1 dose, 140 subjects), 91% (86-95%) achieved a 
four-fold rise in rSBA; after MenC (1 dose, 139 subjects), 96% (92-99%) achieved a four-fold rise. The 
difference between the groups (-5%) had a 95% CI range of -11% to 1% and thus did not achieve 
non-inferiority. The rSBA GMTs were robust for both groups but higher after a single dose of MenC 
than after a single dose of MenACWY (266 versus 131).

Following the Month 12 vaccination, the GMT increased in both vaccine groups (in Group II to 22 and 
in Group III to 31), with corresponding GMRs of 10 and 13, respectively. This response is consistent 
with typical primary immune response. The percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥1:4 towards 
serogroups C was 90% in Group II (95% CI: 85-94) and 97% in Group III (95% CI: 93-99). 
Comparative immunogenicity of 2 doses of MenACWY (at 6-8 months and at 12 months) vs. 1 dose of 
MenC given at 12 months was assessed as a secondary objective.

Immunogenicity of MenACWY 
4 dosing schedule in infants: study V59P14 
The key primary objective to support the efficacy of MenACWY in infants was that at one month after 
the final dose in the 4-dose series, the LL of the 2-sided 95% CI of the proportion of subjects with 
hSBA ≥ 1:8 was at least 80% for serogroup A and 85% for serogroups C, W and Y. This objective was 
tested in the US immunogenicity subjects of the pivotal study V59P14 and in the immunogenicity 
subjects enrolled in Latin America. For the US subjects, at 1 month after the fourth dose of MenACWY, 
the LL of the 2-sided 95% CI around the percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:8 was 87% for 
serogroup A and ranged between 92% and 96% for serogroups C, W, and Y. Similarly, 95-100% of 
subjects in Latin America (Group LA3A) achieved hSBA ≥ 1:8 one month after the 4th dose given at 16

2 dosing schedule in older infants: studies V59P14, V59P21, V59P22, V59P7 
Data in support of a 2 dosing schedule in older infants (>6-12 months) comes from studies V59P21 
and V59P22. 
A co-primary objective of study V59P21 assessed the “adequacy” of the immune response following a 
2-dose series given at 7-9 and 12 months, defined as the LL of the 2-sided 95% CI of the proportion of 
subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:8 was at least 65% for serogroup A and 85% for serogroups C, W, and Y at 
one month after the second dose. Subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:8 following the 2-dose series were 88-
100%. The LL of the 2-sided 95% CI around the percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:8 was 84% for 
serogroup A and ranged between 93% and 98% for serogroups C, W, and Y. 
Secondary objectives in study V59P22 included assessments of the immunogenicity of 2 doses of 
MenACWY given to infants at 6 to 8 and 12 months of age, as measured by percentages of subjects 
with hSBA ≥1:8 and hSBA GMTs one month after the second vaccination. It was concluded by the MAH 
that 2 doses were able to induce a satisfactory immune response against all 4 serotypes. 
Data in support of the efficacy of MenACWY in toddlers following a 2-dose series in the second year of 
life mainly comes from the pivotal study V59P14 subjects in Latin America and additionally from the 
supportive study V59P7. 
At baseline, the percentage of V59P14 Latin America subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:8 ranged between 0 and 
5% across the four serogroups. After the second vaccine dose these percentages were 97% for 
serogroup A and 100% for serogroups C, W and Y. The LL of the 2-sided 95% CI around the 
percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:8 ranged between 92% and 96%.  
In study V59P7, at baseline, the percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:8 ranged between 0 and 1% 
across the four serogroups. The immune responses observed at 1 month after the first dose of 
MenACWY in toddlers 12-24 months of age were modest for all four serogroups (percentage of 
subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:8, for serogroup A, 56%; for serogroup C, 35%; for serogroup W, 66%; for 
serogroup Y, 52%). Following a second dose, 6 months after the first, the proportion of subjects with 
an hSBA ≥ 1:8 was 86% (95% CI: 68-96) for serogroup A, and 100% (95% CI: 88-100) for 
serogroups C, W, and Y. Study V59P7 was not formally powered to meet the statistical criteria for 
‘adequacy of immune response’ used in study V59P14.

Concomitant vaccination 
In Infants (study V59P14): DTaP-IPV-HBV, Hib, and Pneumococcal Conjugate vaccines 
Subjects in the US1 and LA3 group received routine infant vaccinations concomitantly with three doses 
of MenACWY at 2, 4 and 6 months of age (infant series). Subjects in the US2 and LA4 group received 
the routine infant vaccinations without infant series MenACWY vaccination. In all of these groups, 
serum samples were collected at 7 months (one month after infant series).  
One month post-infant series vaccination, the ratio of GMCs (GMCUS1 / GMCUS2) for the pertussis 
antigens ranged from 1 to 1.04 for the groups US1/US2, and from 0.8 to 0.93 for the groups LA3/LA4. 
The lower limit of two sided 95% CI was greater than 0.67 for the US subjects (US1 non-inferior to 
US2). The lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI was greater than 0.67 for the LA subjects (LA3 non-
inferior to LA4) for PT and FHA and 0.66 for pertactin (non-inferiority not achieved). For LA subjects 
the ratio of GMCs (GMCLA3 / GMCLA4) or GMTs (poliovirus only) for the other antigens ranged from 
0.75 to 1.07 with the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI being greater than 0.50 (LA3 non-inferior to 
LA4). 
In Toddlers (studies V59P22, V59P21 and V59P14): Infanrix Hexa, Prevenar, MMRV, DTaP 
and Hib booster 
Infanrix Hexa booster (study V59P22) 
The endpoint percentage of subjects with anti-diphtheria toxoid (DT) antibody concentration ≥0.10 
IU/mL was 100% in all three vaccine groups. The percentage of subjects with anti-DT antibody 
concentration ≥1.0 IU/mL was 98-99% across vaccine groups. The percentage of subjects with 
antibody concentrations above ≥0.10 IU/mL against the tetanus toxoid (TT) was 100% in all three 
vaccine groups. The percentage of subjects with TT antibody concentration ≥1.0 IU/mL was 96-97% 
across the three vaccine groups. The percentage of subjects with response towards pertussis antigens 
(FHA, PRN, PT) was between 91% - 97% for FHA, 98-99% for PRN and 95-97% for PT. Differences 
between three vaccine groups were small. There were 99-100% of subjects in each of the three 
vaccine groups who had titres ≥1:8 against the polio antigens. There were 99% of subjects across the

three vaccine groups who had an antibody concentration 0.10 IU/mL against the Hepatitis B surface 
antigen. The percentages of subjects positive for Hib pre-vaccination (visit 3) were the reflection of 
pre-existing immunity due to prior routine vaccination with HIB containing vaccine. The percentages 
were much higher for the cut off level of 0.15 µg/mL that was established for the evaluation of 
responses after the primary series. 
No obvious differences were observed between the groups in regards to immune response to Infanrix 
Hexa booster indicating no interference with concurrent meningococcal vaccines received at the 12 
month visit. 
Prevenar (study V59P22) 
Immune responses against antigens of the 7 serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae varied among the 
strains, but responses were similar across the vaccine groups for the majority of the pneumococcal 
antigens. 
MMRV (study V59P21) 
The immune response to measles, mumps, rubella and varicella at six weeks following vaccination with 
one dose of MMRV given concomitantly with MenACWY (Group I) was to be considered non-inferior to 
the immunogenicity of MMRV administered alone (Group III) if the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI 
of the difference in the percentage of subjects with seroconversion for measles, mumps, and rubella, 
and seroprotection for varicella at 6 weeks after MMRV vaccination was greater than -5% for measles, 
mumps and rubella and greater than -10% for varicella. The results satisfied the protocol-specified 
non-inferiority criterion for each of these four antigens. 
This was confirmed with the immune response of MMRV as measured by GMTs for measles, mumps, 
rubella, and varicella for the PP population. GMTs were non-inferior in the MenACWY + MMRV group as 
compared to the MMRV group for all four antigens: the largest difference was observed for mumps 
(vaccine group ratio = 1.2, 95% CI: (1.06, 1.35)) and measles (vaccine group ratio = 1.11, 95% CI: 
(0.99, 1.25)) where the concomitant administration of MenACWY and MMRV had higher GMTs than the 
group which received MMRV alone. GMTs were consistently higher in the MenACWY + MMRV group as 
compared to the MMRV group for measles (4049 vs. 3632) and mumps (97 vs. 81) and were similar 
for rubella (57 vs. 56) and for varicella (19 vs. 18). 
DtaP, Hib booster (study V59P14) 
A subset of Latin American subjects of study V59P14 received the ActHib (Hib) and Infanrix (DTaP) 
booster vaccination at 16 months of age with (LA3A) and without (LA3B) concomitant 4th dose of 
MenACWY. The immune response to diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and Hib for the group receiving 
concomitant MenACWY vaccination was non-inferior to that when routine vaccines were given alone 
except for the FHA antigen of pertussis as measured by the seroresponse rate. However, for GMC 
ratios non-inferiority was achieved for all antigens including FHA, for which the GMC ratio (95% CI) for 
LA3A vs. LA3B was: 1.14 (0.9, 1.44) i.e. above the pre-specified non-inferiority level of 0.67 for the LL 
of the 95% CI. 
Persistence of MenACWY antibodies 
Study V59P14 
Persistence of bactericidal antibodies was observed for all serogroups at 12 months of age in US 
subjects, just prior to the fourth dose: the proportion of subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:8 for serogroups A, C, 
Assessment report

W, and Y, respectively, was 12%, 52%, 69%, and 60%. Antibody persistence at 16 months of age 
prior to the fourth MenACWY dose in the subjects in Latin America, expressed as the proportion of 
subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:8, was for serogroups A, C, W, and Y, 15%, 26%, 63%, and 52%, 
respectively.

6 Months - PP Population, Group LA3, Study V59P14 
Study V59P22 
A secondary objective in study V59P22 was to assess the persistence of immune response against 
meningococcal serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y or C alone at 6-18 months after vaccination with either 
one or two doses MenACWY or one dose of Menjugate as measured by hSBA GMTs and percentage of 
subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:8 and hSBA ≥ 1:4 directed against N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135, 
and Y (only for subjects enrolled in Australia). 
Assessment report  
EMA/322985/2013  
Page 36/67 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This objective was assessed in all three vaccine groups that had subjects enrolled in Australian sites, 
and had blood drawn at Visit 6. The actual mean time period was approximately 7 months (mean 
205.5 +/- 12.9 days).   
Table 24.  Percentage of Subjects with Human SBA ≥1:8, ≥1:4, GMT and GMR (95% CI), at 6-18 
Months Following the 12-Month Vaccination, Serogroup C Persistence PP Population 
The percentages of subjects maintaining bactericidal antibodies were lower than the rates found one 
month after the Month 12 dose (Month 13). For serogroup Y, the percentage of subjects with hSBA 
≥1:8 increased in Group II from 33% responders at one month following the Month 12 dose to 79% 
responders at 7 months  following the Month 12 dose.  This trend was not seen in Group I; the 
percentage of responders at one month following the Month 12 dose was 100% and this decreased to 
79% at the 7 month post-12 month dose time point.   
Only the percentage of subjects with serogroup A bactericidal antibodies declined in Groups I and II. 
GMTs also declined several-fold, although the decline was less obvious in Group II for serogroups A, C 
and W. However, observed GMTs in Group II increased for serogroup Y. Due to small sample sizes, 
only limited conclusions should be drawn from these results. 
Study V59P22e1 (Extension study) 
This was a Phase 3, open-label, multi-centre, extension study designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, 
and antibody persistence at 22 to 45 months of age (13 to 33 months after last vaccination) with one 
or two doses of meningococcal ACWY conjugate vaccine or one dose of meningococcal C conjugate 
vaccine in children who participated as infants in study V59P22. A total of 205 subjects were enrolled 
and all subjects completed the study. At one site (site 18), several GCP findings were identified 
Assessment report  
EMA/322985/2013  
Page 37/67 
 
 
 
 
 
therefore data from all subjects enrolled at this site (total 65 subjects [21 subjects in group 1, 22 
subjects in group 2 and 22 subjects in group 3]) were excluded from both immunogenicity and safety 
analyses. Of note, the V59P22 site in Australia provided persistence data already as part of the V59P22 
study (at 6-18 months after vaccination with either one or two doses MenACWY or one dose of MenC, 
see section above).  
For the analysis subject data were clustered into periods lapsed since last vaccination: 23 months or 
less, 24 to 31 months, and 32 months and longer from the last vaccination. The persistence of 
immunity was measured as hSBA titers as a function of time elapsed since the last vaccination. A blood 
sample was collected before the booster dose to determine the level of bactericidal antibodies that 
were present. All subjects received a booster dose of MenACWY (visit 7). A blood sample to determine 
the booster response was collected 28 days post vaccination (visit 8). 
The results of this extension study V59P22e1 demonstrate relatively modest to poor persistence of 
bactericidal antibodies to vaccine antigens in children 22 to 45 months of age at 13 to 33 months after 
previous vaccinations, consisting of one dose of MenACWY conjugate vaccine at 12 months of age 
(group 2), or two doses of MenACWY conjugate vaccine at 6 to 8 months and 12 months of age (group 
1), or one dose of MenC conjugate vaccine at 12 months of age (group 3) in study V59P22.

Booster response (Study V59P22e1, see description above) 
One month after the booster dose of MenACWY in study V59P22e1 (visit 8), hSBA GMTs and the 
percentages of subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y were 
markedly increased in both groups compared to visit 7 [serogroup A (hSBA ≥1:8 96% to 98% vs. 7% 
to 13%; GMT 182 to 214 vs. 2.52 to 2.82), serogroup C (hSBA ≥1:8 100% vs. 25% to 27%; GMT 541 
to 968 vs. 3.91 to 3.92), serogroup W (hSBA ≥1:8 100% vs. 50% to 63%; GMT 799 to 1267 vs. 9.37 
to 12), and serogroup Y (hSBA ≥1:8 100% vs. 39% to 40%; GMT 650 to 676 vs. 6.04 to 6.79)]. 
Induction of immunologic memory 
In study V59P14, the bactericidal antibody response to a fourth dose at 12 months greatly exceeded 
that following a first dose at 12 months. hSBA GMTs achieved in US1A subjects were approximately 5-
fold (serogroup A) to 37- and 38-fold (serogroups W and Y) higher than those observed in US2 
subjects, suggesting that the three doses of MenACWY administered at 2, 4, and 6 months of age 
during infancy induced immunologic memory.  
In study V59P9, subjects received a single dose of MenACWY at 6 months of age. The responses to the 
first dose at 6 months were low, with hSBA GMTs ranging between 2.96 for serogroup A to a high of 
25 for serogroup C. In contrast, when these same subjects received a second dose at 12 months, the 
hSBA GMTs ranged from 44 for serogroup A, to 302 for serogroup C.  
Study V59P16 investigated the ability to correlate levels of antigen-specific memory B-cells assessed at 
5 months with antibody titres or levels of antigen-specific B- or plasma cells after vaccination with 
MenACWY up to 13 months of age. However, few subjects had detectable specific memory B-cells at 
5 months, therefore correlations were unlikely to be reliably identified. Even though memory-specific 
B-cells were not easily detected at 5 months, evidence of their existence in this population was 
demonstrated following the 3rd vaccination by robust increases in circulating plasma cells and 
increased hSBA titres. Following this vaccination, ≥92% of subjects had hSBA titer ≥1:8 towards 
serogroups A and C, and 100% of subjects had hSBA titres ≥1:8 towards serogroups W and Y.

1.3.2.3.  Supportive studies 
Study V59P9 
Methods 
This study was designed as a phase 2, partially randomised, open-label multicentre study primarily 
designed to evaluate a 2-dose MenACWY series administered at 6 and 12 months of age. The study 
enrolled: (i) healthy infants 6 months of age; and (ii) toddlers 12 months of age, which differed both in 
terms of vaccines received and vaccination schedules applied. Overall, a total of 175 subjects were 
enrolled, including 125 infants and 50 toddlers. 
Infant subjects in group I (n=64) were administered MenACWY at 6 and 12 months of age, while in the 
other group (n=61) they received only one dose of MenACWY at 12 months of age. Routine paediatric 
vaccines, as per Canadian vaccination schedule, were administered to all subjects, including 
concomitantly administered Pentacel (DTaP-IPV-Hib), and Prevenar at 6 months of age and toddler 
Prevnar at 12 months of age. 
Relevant immunogenicity assessments/endpoints for the infant study groups were:  
• 
• 
immune response at 1 month after the 2-dose MenACWY series administered at 6 and 12 months 
of age (primary immunogenicity analysis: assessment made in terms of hSBA ≥ 1:4; secondary 
immunogenicity analysis: assessment made in terms of hSBA ≥ 1:8 and hSBA GMTs); 
immune response at 1 month after one dose of MenACWY administered at 12 months of age 
(secondary immunogenicity analysis);  
Results 
The immunogenicity results are presented for hSBA ≥ 1:8. At baseline, the percentage of subjects with 
hSBA ≥ 1:8 ranged between 0 and 4% for the four serogroups. For all four serogroups, the immune 
responses observed at 1 month after the 2-dose MenACWY series administered at 6 and 12 months of 
age were consistently higher than those observed at 1 month after a single dose of MenACWY 
administered at 12 months of age (percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:8, for serogroup A, 84% vs. 
60%; for serogroups C and W, 100% vs. 93%, for serogroup Y, 100% vs. 67%, all respectively). This 
was confirmed by the results observed in the hSBA GMT analyses. 
Study V59P16 
Methods 
Study V59P16 was designed to assess whether the frequency of meningococcal serogroup A, C, W-135 
and Y specific memory B cells, measured 1 month after a 2, 4-month vaccination course with 
MenACWY, predicts the specific serum bactericidal activity using human complement (hSBA) of 
(respectively) serogroup A, C, W-135 and Y at 12 months of age (primary objective). Secondary 
objectives included the evaluation of the predictive value of these specific memory B cells measured at 
1 month after a 2,4 month course of MenACWY for 1-2) serogroup A, C, W-135 and Y specific memory 
B cells and IgG concentrations and hSBA titers 1 month after a booster dose of MenACWY administered 
at 12 months, and at 12 months of age; 3) the rise from pre-booster levels in (respectively) serogroup 
A, C, W-135 and Y specific IgG, and memory B-cell concentration and hSBA titers 1 month after a 
booster dose of MenACWY administered at 12 months of age; and 4) the concentration of 
(respectively) serogroup A, C, W-135 and Y specific plasma cells and memory B-cells and specific IgG 
and hSBA titers in the week following a booster dose of MenACWY administered at 12 months of age.

Other secondary objectives included evaluating the possible interference with a pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine, the kinetics of the appearance of serogroup A, C, W-135 and Y specific memory B 
cells, plasma B cells, hSBA and IgG in blood, evaluating the role of demographic factors on 
meningococcal serogroup A, C, W-135 and Y specific memory B cells and IgG concentrations and hSBA 
titers at different time points, and evaluating the effect of genetic polymorphisms on immune response 
to the MenACWY vaccine. 
The study enrolled 216 healthy 2-month-old infants, who were assigned in a 2:1:1 ratio to one of the 
following vaccination groups: 
•  Group I – received MenACWY at 2, 4 and 12 months of age, together with a 2, 3, 4- month course 
of DTaP-Hib-IPV, and a 2, 4, 13-month course of PCV. MMR and a booster dose of Hib were offered 
at 13 months of age. 
•  Group II & Group III – received MenACWY at 2, 4 and 12 months of age, together with a 2, 3, 4-
month course of DTaP-Hib-IPV, and a 2, 4, 12-month course of PCV. MMR and a booster dose of 
Hib were offered at 13 months of age. Infants enrolled in Group II had an additional blood drawn 
at the time of enrolment, and infants enrolled into Group III had an additional blood drawn 6-7 
days following the 12 months (3rd) dose of MenACWY to assess the peak frequency of 
plasmablasts to the third vaccination.  
For all children, a blood sample was taken 30 days following the last immunisation of the primary 
phase, immediately before the 3rd immunisation with MenACWY at 12 months of age and 1 month 
following this immunisation. A blood sample was taken from the mothers of all infants at the time of 
enrolment into the study. 
Results 
The correlation coefficients between memory B cells found at 5 months of age and hSBA titers at 
12 months of age, suggested little or no correlation for serogroups A (-0.08) and C (0.31), a 
correlation of 0.40 for serogroup Y, and a correlation of 0.45 for serogroup W-135. The R-square 
indicates that for serogroups W and Y the level of titres at 12 months of age could be predicted, but for 
serogroups A and C the level of titres at 12 months could not be predicted. From the analysis of the 
primary objective it could be concluded that the prediction of hSBA titers at 12 months using only the 
frequency of meningococcal serogroup A, C, W-135 and Y specific memory B cells measured 1 month 
following a 2,4, month course of MenACWY will have large, or very large, prediction errors. 
Overall, few subjects had detectable specific memory B cells at 5 months, therefore correlations were 
unlikely to be reliably identified. Due to the age of the infants during this study, the ability to isolate 
memory B cells at 5 months of age may have been limited by the small blood volumes collected  
(≤ 5 mL), and the fact that blood samples were divided for many immune response parameters. 
However, even though memory-specific B cells were not easily detected at 5 months, evidence of their 
existence was demonstrated following the 3rd vaccination by robust increases in the number of 
circulating plasma cells and several-fold increases in hSBA titers. Following this vaccination, ≥92% of 
subjects had hSBA titer ≥1:8 towards serogroups A and C, and 100% of subjects had hSBA titers ≥1:8 
towards serogroups W and Y. 
Kinetics of the immune response suggested that following a primary vaccination with MenACWY at 
2 and 4 months of age, generally, memory B cells peak approximately 7 days following vaccination and 
that hSBA titers peak approximately 14 days following vaccination.

1.3.2.4.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The pivotal studies included infants from the age of 2 months. Although study V59P14 included 
subjects at 2 months of age, several groups in this study received their first dose of MenACWY at age 
12 months. 
Considering different infant vaccination schedules in the EU it is possible that MenACWY will be co-
administered with conjugated pneumococcal vaccines, DtaP possibly combined with Hib, hepatitis b, 
and inactivated polio vaccine, measles, mumps, rubella vaccine (possibly combined with varicella 
vaccine), and in certain countries rotavirus vaccine and BCG1. All these vaccines except for BCG have 
been included in the clinical development program. Note that BCG is mostly given shortly after birth, 
and in some countries at older ages (6+ years), making concomitant administration with BCG and 
MenACWY unlikely, although possible. With regards to the schedules evaluated, the most strict and 
challenging schedule of vaccination at 2,3,4 months is not included in the assessments. Data 
generated with less condensed schedules cannot be extrapolated to this tighter schedule. However, as 
this schedule appears to be no longer used for meningococcal vaccines in the EU this forms no issue 
for the present variation application. 
GCP issues were identified at one site from study V59P22, following which the MAH decided to exclude 
data from this site from the primary analysis. As such the power of the study has been reduced. 
However, the main findings and conclusions of the trial remain unaffected, namely non-inferiority to a 
monovalent MenC vaccine could not be demonstrated. Of note, the upper limit of 95% confidence 
interval is still negative. As the decrease in power did not change the findings from study V59P22, the 
CHMP concluded that study still contributes to the PIP and although the number of children included in 
the study is lower than what was agreed in the PIP the study findings remain valid. 
In relation to study V59P22 the primary criteria for immunogenicity against serogroup C was that the 
lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the difference between one dose of MenACWY and one dose of 
Menjugate in the percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 at 1 month following a single vaccination at 
12 months of age was greater than -10%. The (clinical) relevance of non-inferiority margins has not 
been discussed. A decrease in immunogenicity is expected to translate into a decrease in effectiveness 
and could potentially lead to a drop in the protection levels in the population possibly affecting 
transmission. An acceptance of lower immunogenicity of MenACWY to Menjugate should be explained 
in this context. A critical discussion of the difference in immune response between MenACWY and 
Menjugate would be essential if the MAH was to decide to apply for the indication for children aged 2-
23 months.  
Concerning study V59P14, the study design was drastically altered after the study was started, in order 
to evaluate a four dose schedule as the primary objective. In addition, a relatively large proportion of 
subjects in the US immunogenicity groups experienced major protocol deviations. 
In this study, in both regions the baseline demographic characteristics appear well balanced between 
the different treatment arms. The US immunogenicity subjects appear slightly younger, heavier and 
longer than the LA immunogenicity subjects, however, differences are numerically small and this is not 
observed for the safety subjects.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Dose response studies 
The results obtained from study V59P5 are in line with the results observed in the pivotal studies and 
the supportive studies: lower response and more rapid decay of bactericidal antibodies for serogroup A 
compared to the others, need for three doses in the primary series to infants (2,4,6 months) and good 
booster response at 12 months. 
Comparative Immunogenicity of MenACWY vs. MenC 
Regarding study V59P22, the primary objective was not met, i.e. it has not been demonstrated that 
MenACWY is non-inferior to Menjugate with respect to the response to serogroup C when applying a 
non-inferiority margin of 10%. This finding provides indication that MenACWY could be less 
immunogenic as compared to monovalent conjugated MenC vaccines which poses a risk concerning 
herd immunity against MenC. This confirms earlier observations from V59P5. 
Comparative immunogenicity of 1 dose MenACWY vs 1 dose Menjugate at 12 months was also 
assessed for GMTs and percentage of subjects with hSBA≥1:4. The findings are in line with the 
primary outcome, i.e. 1 dose of MenACWY appears less immunogenic than 1 dose of Menjugate in 
children aged 12 months.  
Comparative immunogenicity of 2 doses of MenACWY (at 6-8 months and at 12 months) vs 1 dose of 
Menjugate given at 12 months was assessed as a secondary objective. Clearly the immune response 
following 2 doses of MenACWY given at 6 -8 months and at 12 months of age is improved compared to 
a single dose given at 12 months, in particular when considering the GMTs. The comparison of two 
doses of MenACWY given at 6/8 months and 12 months vs a single dose of Menjugate given at 12 
months shows a higher response after two doses of Menveo. 
If Menveo is to replace monovalent conjugated MenC vaccines in childhood vaccination programs, the 
comparison between the vaccines for the response against serogroup C in infants is of importance.  
The scientific advice given in 2009 states (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/288055/2009): “It is important to have 
sufficient data showing that Menveo in the group < 1 year after the primary immunizations gives an 
equal protection compared to the monovalent conjugated C vaccine.  A small decline in the protection 
against type C would possibly undermine a small gain achieved by adding types A, W and Y.” 
The clinical program does not include a direct comparative study versus the MenC conjugate in infants 
from 2 months of age. The only comparison between Menveo and conjugated MenC vaccine performed 
in infants is in study V59P5.  One group received Menveo without adjuvant (but with polysorbate) at 2, 
4 and 12 months and another group received Menjugate at the same time points. Although the number 
of subjects in the two groups were different, the large difference in bactericidal antibodies at all time 
points and the low percentage of subjects with hSBA≥1:8 at month 12 for the UK 2,4- (MenACWY) 
group indicates that the vaccines are not equivalent.  
As non-inferiority of one dose MenACWY vs. one dose MenC in older infants / toddlers has not been 
demonstrated, non-inferiority can not be claimed in infants. Of note, according to the label Menjugate 
is given as 2 doses for infants aged 2 to 12 months with a booster dose following official 
recommendations and as one dose in children over 12 months of age. More doses are generally 
recommended for MenACWY, which is given as four doses for infants aged 2-6 months and two doses 
for 6-23 months (disregarding the exceptional dosing recommendation for children “at risk of 
exposure” between 12 and 23 months). In conclusion, there is no evidence of non-inferiority of 
MenACWY to a conjugated monovalent MenC vaccine in infants covered by the different MenC 
vaccination programmes (i.e. those who have not received a primary series of MenC vaccine).

Dosing schedules 
The MAH evaluated different dosing regimens in infants: a four dose schedule in infants from 2 to 6 
months of age (at 2,4,6,12-16 months), a 2 dose schedule in infants/toddlers aged 6-23 months and a 
one dose schedule in toddlers aged 12-23 months at risk. 
Results from study V59P14 showed that the fourth dose is clearly needed to achieve sufficient 
immunoresponse for serogroup A in infants in US groups. The response following the 3rd dose for MenA 
is higher in LA subjects as compared to US subjects, but that could not be explained by higher baseline 
titres.  
In older infants (>6-12 months), clearly 2 doses are required to amount to an adequate immune 
response, especially for serogroup A but also serogroups W and Y. The response post dose 1 in V59P21 
for serogroups W and Y is lower than the response in study V59P22, however the response post dose 2 
is similar. The observation could possibly be explained by a “ceiling effect”. 
In the different studies there was considerable variability in immune response to the different 
serogroups, for which there is no clear explanation. The MAH argued that host and environmental 
factors might explain some of the variability between studies. 
The response after a single dose in children from 12 to 23 months is quite modest against serogroups 
A, W and Y – but also against C in study V59P7. It is striking that there is large variability in the 
response between the studies. For example, the response against serogroup W varies from 58% to 
93%, and against MenC from 35% to 93%. The GMTs also show varation in response between studies, 
with the responses being at the higher end in study V59P9 (not for MenA and MenY). This large degree 
in variation is also seen between the different studies in infants after a single dose. The variation 
between the studies with the same presentation was equally large or possibly larger than the variation 
between studies with different presentations, indicating that potential differences in presentations 
could not explain the variability and other, currently unidentified factors play an important role.  
The MAH mentions that the low response seen in the study V59P7 could be a combination of host and 
environmental factors rather than inherent low immunogenicity of the vaccine. In study V59P14 the 
effect of several cofactors, including baseline serostatus, gender, race and breastfeeding status, were 
evaluated however no clear relations could be found (also due to a lack of power in some cases).  
Concomitant administration 
In Infants (study V59P14), there is no clear evidence of interference of MenACWY with the immune 
response to conjugated pneumococcal vaccine, polio, hepatitis B, Hib, diphtheria and tetanus. 
However, response to several pneumococcal antigens is somewhat decreased when administered 
concomitantly with MenACWY. The clinical relevance of this observation is unclear.  With regards to the 
response to pertussis antigens, non-inferiority of concomitant vaccination with MenACWY to 
vaccination without MenACWY could not be demonstrated for LA subjects for pertactin only. However, 
as this could be demonstrated for US subjects, and for PT/FHA, and no statistically significant 
difference was found considering seroresponse rates, this finding is unlikely to be important. It is 
agreed with the MAH that these data show that MenACWY can be administered concomitantly with 
routine infant vaccines without impact on the response to the concomitant vaccine antigens. 
In toddlers (studies V59P21, V59P14), there was no evidence of interference of MenACWY with MMR-V, 
Hib booster and Tdap in toddlers. It is agreed with the MAH that MenACWY can be administered 
concomitantly with routine toddlres vaccines without impact on the response to the concomitant 
vaccines antigens.

Persistence data 
Persistence data has been presented for up to 5 months after completion of 3 doses in the primary 
series (2,4,6 months) in infants and up to 7 months after a two-dose schedule in older infants and 
toddlers (very limited number of subjects).  The weak point is the serogroup A component where a 
very rapid drop in bactericidal antibodies was observed.  In the US part of study V59P14 (Group US1) 
only 12% of subjects had hSBA≥1:8 against serogroup A before the fourth dose at 12 months, 
compared to 52% for serogroup C, 69% for serogroup W and 60% for serogroup Y.  The drop for 
serogroup A was from 67% 1 month after the third dose to 12% just before the fourth dose. In the 
Latin-America (LA) part of study V59P14 the fourth dose was given at month 16 which means that 
persistence was observed for up to 9 months after the sampling at month 7 (after dosing at 2,4,6 
months). Again, serogroup A was down to 15% with hSBA≥1:8, serogroup C down to 26%, serogroup 
W 63% and serogroup Y 52%.  This means there is a risk that in a time window after the third dose a 
majority of subjects are below the protective level of bactericidal antibodies. A period of 10 months 
between the third and fourth dose is considered too long to ensure that most subjects are protected.  
A secondary objective in study V59P22 was to assess the persistence of immune response against 
meningococcal serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y or C alone at 6-18 months after vaccination with either 
one or two doses MenACWY or one dose of Menjugate as measured by hSBA GMTs and percentage of 
subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:8 and hSBA ≥ 1:4 directed against N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135, 
and Y (only for subjects enrolled in Australia). It is agreed with the MAH that due to small sample sizes 
limited conclusions can be drawn from this data. Serogroup A dropped to 31% with hSBA≥1:8 in group 
I (2 doses MenACWY at 6-8 months and 12 months) and to 7% in group II (1 dose MenACWY at 12 
months), confirming observations from other studies that the persistence of bactericidal antibodies 
against serogroup A is weak. 
The results of an extension study of V59P22 demonstrated limited persistence of bactericidal 
antibodies at 22 to 45 months of age (13 to 33 months after the primary vaccinations). Percent of 
subjects with hSBA.1:8 directed against serogroups C, W, and Y were higher than those for serogroup 
A in the respective all study groups. These results show 14% to 55% of subjects having hSBA≥1:8 at 
24 to 31 months after one or two doses of MenACWY for serogroups C, W and Y. 
In study V59P22e1 robust hSBA responses to booster vaccination with MenACWY were demonstrated 
for all groups 13 to 33 months after the primary vaccination. In addition, the study demonstrated that 
MenACWY can effectively boost the response to serogroup C in subjects primed with MenC conjugate 
(group 3), which was comparable to the booster response in groups primed with MenACWY (groups 1 
and 2). 
During the MAA rapid waning of bactericidal antibodies, especially for serogroup A was considered of 
major concern. Moreover, in the initial Scientific Advice based on the data from study V59P5 it was 
noted that the SBA response rates in the MenACWY groups (both adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted 
formulations) were significantly lower when compared to Menjugate at 12 months of age. In this study, 
the persistence of Menjugate (given at 2 & 4 months) was better, with 90% hSBA ≥1:4 at 12 months 
compared to 30-73% for the different MenACWY groups. This was considered of great concern and it 
was requested that this was to be addressed in the infant program. The MAH has failed to do so 
adequately: The present data from groups US1 and group LA3 again points towards modest 
persistence at 12 or 16 months of age following 3 doses given at 2, 4 and 6 months, depending on the 
serogroup (ranging from 12/15% for MenA to 63/69% for MenW). The limited comparison for 
persistence of bactericidal antibodies with licensed MenC vaccines in this age group point towards 
similar persistence for serogroup C compared to Menjugate, however this comparison is made upon 
only very few subjects in each arm (17, 14, 13) which is too little to make firm conclusions. 
Extrapolations of data from older subjects cannot be made, as the immune system of an infant and 
Assessment report

toddler cannot be compared to that of an adolescent or of adults. Study V59P14e1, which is ongoing, 
shall provide persistence data up to 60 months; however these data are currently not available.  
Immunologic memory 
It has become increasingly clear that for diseases with rapid clinical progression, such as 
meningococcal disease, sustained bactericidal antibodies are important for individual protection. Ability 
to induce T-cell-dependent immunity is a fundamental property that defines a conjugate vaccine, and 
evidence showing that MenACWY can induce immunologic memory is important, as it has broader 
implications for characterizing the vaccine. 
The results of studies V59P14, V59P9 and V59P16 (please see section ‘Induction of immunologic 
memory’) demonstrate that immunologic memory was induced in young infants when exposed to 
MenACWY in the first year of life not only after exposure to three MenACWY doses, but also after a 
single MenACWY dose.  
Although persistence of bactericidal antibodies is recognised as the key determinant of long term 
protection against meningococcal disease due to the fact that disease has such fast onset that 
anamnestic immune response is sometimes too late to protect the individual, the demonstration of the 
ability of MenACWY to induce immunologic memory is also important, contributing to the overall 
confidence that MenACWY possesses the broad characteristics of a glycoconjugate vaccine. In an 
ongoing extension study of V59P14, study V59P14E1, it is planned to evaluate persistence of 
bactericidal antibodies to 40 and 60 months of age with an assessment of immunologic memory at 60 
months of age. 
The discussed studies provide some evidence of the induction of immunologic memory therefore 
exhibiting the characteristics of a glycoconjugate vaccine. However, it is more relevant to have good 
persistence of bactericidal antibodies.  
Supportive studies 
Study V59P9 clearly supports a 2 dose schedule over a 1 dose schedule in infants aged over 6 months. 
Data from study V59P16 indicated that subjects could be protected 14 days after vaccination, which 
could direct a recommendation for travellers (i.e. the optimal immune response in infants is achieved 
around 14 days following vaccination), however this cannot be extrapolated to adults and older 
children.  
1.3.2.5.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The MAH submitted three large phase III trials (V59P14, V59P21 and V59P22) and several phase II 
studies in support of this variation application, initially submitted to extend the indication for MenACWY 
to include children aged 2 to 23 month. The data point out that MenACWY elicits an immune response 
in infants and toddlers. Four doses at 2, 4, 6 and 12-16 months resulted in a seroresponse (% with 
hSBA ≥ 1:8, 95%CI) at one month after the last dose of 94% (87,98), 98% (92,100),  100% (96,100) 
and 100% (96,100) for serogroup A, C, W and Y respectively. One month following a two dose 
schedule in infants aged 6 to 9 months (with the second dose given at 12 months) 88-90%, 96-100%, 
96-100%, 92-96% of subjects achieved hSBA ≥1:8 for serogroups A, C, W and Y respectively. One 
month following one dose in children from 12-23 months of age, 49-75%, 35-93%, 58-93%, and 49-
72% of subjects achieved hSBA ≥1:8 for serogroups A, C, W and Y respectively across the different 
subjects.

There is no evidence of non-inferiority of MenACWY to a conjugated monovalent MenC vaccine in 
infants and toddlers covered by the different MenC vaccination programmes (i.e. those who have not 
received a primary series of MenC vaccine), which has implications for the use of this vaccine in the EU 
setting. 
A one dose schedule as previously proposed for children “at risk of exposure” from 12 – 23 months is 
not supported by the data. 
There is paucity in comparative persistence data with a monovalent conjugate MenC vaccine 
demonstrating equal persistence for MenC and no long term persistence data for all serogroups (12 
months at the minimum). Moreover, persistence for serogroup A is poor. A warning concerning this has 
been included in the SmPC following variation II/17. 
Furthermore, the data indicate that there is a period between the third and fourth dose when a 
substantial proportion of subjects have no protective levels of bactericidal antibodies. A period of 6 to 
10 months between the third and fourth dose in the infant schedule, as is currently recommended, is 
thus considered too long to ensure sufficient levels of protection. 
The above mentioned issues remain unsolved and therefore valid, if the new indication was still 
requested. During the procedure the MAH applied for a change in the scope of the variation, requesting 
only update of the SmPC with results from studies conducted in line with the agreed PIP.

b Control subjects: 2, 4, 6 controls for infant dosing. 4-dose controls are the subset of control subjects who did not 
receive MenACWY until after the 4th study vaccination (Study V59P14: Groups US4b, US4c, LA6b, LA6c) or who 
never received MenACWY (V59P23)’.Control subjects during the infant series who had visits where they were to 
receive MenACWY during their toddler year at either 12 and 15 months of age or 13 and 15 months of age. The 12 
months of age dose was given concomitantly with ProQuad, Prevnar, and Havrix and the 15 months of age dose 
was given concomitantly with Infanrix and ActHIB. 
c V59P14: 4-dose series given at 2-4-6-12 (US 1a, US3, LA5), 2-4-6-13 (US1b), 2-4-6-16 (LA3a), or 2-4-6-17 
(LA3b) months of age. V59P23: 4-dose series given at 2-4-6-12 months of age. V59P14: 3-dose series given at 2-
6-12 (LA1a) or 2-6-13 (LA1b) months of age. V59P5 and V59P16: 3-dose series given at 2-4-12 months of age.

Solicited Adverse Events 
Reactogenicity 
For the infant subjects, the percentages of subjects who experienced local or systemic reactions after 
any vaccination were very similar between the 4-dose MenACWY series and 4-dose control groups. The 
percentage of older infant/toddler subjects reporting any severe reactogenicity appears lower after 2-
dose (12%) or 1-dose (16%) MenACWY compared to MenC (27%) (any vaccination). In this age group 
there was no difference in local reactogenicity between the three groups (51%, 50%, 51%, 
respectively). There was a higher percentage reporting systemic reactions in the MenC group (80% 
any, 25% severe) in comparison to the 2-dose (64% any, 11% severe) and 1-dose (72% any, 14% 
severe) MenACWY groups. 
The percentages of infants, older infants and toddlers who experienced any local or systemic reaction 
following each vaccination are presented in the tables below.

Moderate+Severe induration/erythema: > 50 mm; severe fever: ≥ 39.0oC. Rash not included in summary because 
severity is not assessed. 
For infants, the percentages of subjects who experienced reactions were very similar between the 
MenACWY and control groups after vaccinations at 2 months, 4 months, and 6 months of age, and in 
the toddler year. The greatest difference (7%) was found in the percentage of subjects experiencing 
any local reactions in the 6-month MenACWY group (46%) and 6-month control group (53%). Also, the 
percentages decreased after each vaccination in both the MenACWY and control groups. The 
percentages of older infant/toddler subjects who experienced any local or systemic reactions were 
higher following the first dose (72%) than after the second dose (62%). This was also true for local 
reactions (41% and 36% following dose 1 and dose 2, respectively), systemic reactions (55% and 
45%), and analgesic use (32% and 24%). In the integrated analysis, subjects who received a single 
vaccination with MenC experienced more reactions (90%), more local (53%), and more systemic 
reactions (80%) than those that received MenACWY, and they also experienced more severe reactions 
(27%), more moderate+severe local reactions (5%), and more severe systemic reactions (25%). 
Local Reactogenicity 
In general, the percentages of infant subjects who experienced particular local reactions (tenderness, 
erythema, and induration) 1 to 7 days after any vaccination were somewhat lower in the 4-dose 
MenACWY group than in the 4-dose control group. A similar picture is seen when considering local

reactions after each vaccination in this age group. The percentages of older infants/toddlers who 
experienced particular local reactions (tenderness, erythema, and induration) 1 to 7 days after any 
vaccination were similar between the 2-dose and 1-dose MenACWY groups. Those that received MenC 
experienced less tenderness, about the same erythema, and more induration than the MenACWY 
subjects.  
The percentages of older infants/toddlers who experienced any tenderness 1 to 7 days after each 
vaccination were similar between the MenACWY dose 1 group (23%), MenACWY dose 2 group (22%), 
and the MenC group (25%), though severe tenderness was higher in the MenC group (4%) than both 
MenACWY groups (1% in both). A higher percentage of subjects experienced erythema in the MenC 
group (38%) than in the MenACWY dose 1 and dose 2 groups (27% and 24%, respectively). Severe 
erythema was ≤ 1% in all groups. A higher percentage of subjects experienced induration in the MenC 
group (26%) than in the MenACWY dose 1 (13%) and dose 2 groups (10%).  
Systemic Reactogenicity 
Overall, the percentages of infant subjects who experienced particular systemic reactions after any 
vaccination were very similar between the 4-dose series and 4-dose control groups. The most 
commonly reported systemic reaction was irritability (69% and 72% in the 4-dose MenACWY and 4-
dose control groups, respectively), followed by sleepiness (66% and 67%), and persistent crying (55% 
and 58%). The percentages of severe reactions were low, never exceeding 5% for any solicited 
reaction in the MenACWY vaccine group, and 5% in the control group. Fever was experienced by 
similar percentages across groups (range: 24-26%); fever ≥ 40oC occurred in < 1% of subjects in 
both groups across vaccinations. Most reactions occurred within 1-3 days after vaccination. 
During the 7-day reporting period following any vaccination, in the 2-dose MenACWY group, the most 
commonly reported systemic reactions after any vaccination were irritability (45%), sleepiness (33%), 
and persistent crying (25%) in older infant/toddler subjects. In the 1-dose MenACWY group, the most 
commonly reported systemic reactions were irritability (44%), sleepiness (41%), and change in eating 
habits (26%). In the MenC group, the most commonly reported systemic reactions after any 
vaccination were irritability (45%), sleepiness (46%), and persistent crying (43%). Fever occurred in 
41% of MenC subjects compared to 23% and 17% in the MenACWY dose 1 and dose 2 subjects. Fever 
≥ 40oC was experienced by ≤ 1% of subjects in all groups. This discrepancy may be due to the fact 
that a majority of the MenC subjects were in study V59P22 which measured temperature rectally as 
opposed to the axillary method used in all other studies. In that study the comparison of fever ≥ 38oC 
after one dose of MenACWY and MenC at 12 months of age was unremarkable: 29% versus 25% for 
MenACWY and MenC, respectively. Most reactions occurred within 1-3 days after vaccination. 
The percentages of older infant/toddler subjects reporting systemic reactions, 1-7 days after each 
vaccination are presented by severity in the table below.

Unsolicited Adverse Events 
For the infant series (2 to 7 months of age), 68% and 67% of subjects experienced treatment-
emergent AEs in the MenACWY and control groups, respectively. The most common AEs during this 
period were upper respiratory tract infections (20% and 18% in MenACWY and control groups, 
respectively), otitis media (12% and 11%), nasopharyngitis (6% and 8%), and bronchiolitis (7% and 
8%). Twenty eight (28) percent of older infants/toddler subjects experienced any AE following 1 dose 
of MenACWY. The most common AEs for this one month time period were otitis media (4%), teething 
(3%), and upper respiratory infection (3%). In the MenC group 43% of subjects experienced any AE in 
the one month following vaccination. The most common AEs in this group were pyrexia (6%) and 
induration (5%). 
A summary of all possibly or probably related treatment-emergent AEs and possibly or probably 
related severe AEs for infant subjects who received MenACWY is presented in the table below.

During the infant series of vaccinations, 8.7% (540/6215) of subjects who received MenACWY 
experienced AEs that were deemed to be possibly or probably related to vaccinations. The majority of 
these subjects experienced AEs that belonged to the SOC “General Disorders & Administration Site 
Conditions” and within this category the most common preferred terms were malaise, irritability, 
pyrexia, and induration. Nine (9) subjects experienced 16 severe AEs that were deemed to be possibly 
or probably related to MenACWY, the majority of which were solicited events (1 diarrhoea, 1 vomiting, 
1 injection site pain, 3 irritability, 1 tenderness, 2 pain in extremity, 1 complex partial seizure, 1 
crying, 2 somnolence, 2 eating disorders, and 1 rash). In the 1 month following the first toddler dose, 
4.3% (232/5445) of subjects who received MenACWY experienced AEs that were deemed to be 
possibly or probably related to vaccinations. The most common AEs by preferred term were malaise, 
irritability, and pyrexia, again all in the category of solicited events. Fourteen (14) subjects (0.3%) 
experienced 17 severe AEs during this time period that were deemed to be possibly or probably related 
to the vaccinations (4 diarrhoea, 1 vomiting, 4 irritability, 1 pyrexia, 3 crying, 2 febrile convulsion, 1 
somnolence, 1 eating disorder). 
For the older infants/toddler subjects, 5.2% (141/2715) of subjects who received MenACWY 
experienced AEs that were deemed to be possibly or probably related to vaccinations in the 1 month 
time period following dose 1. The most common preferred terms were irritability, eating disorder, and 
diarrhea. Six (6) subjects experienced 9 severe AEs that were deemed to be possibly or probably 
related to MenACWY (1 diarrhoea, 1 vomiting, 1 hyperpyrexia, 1 injection site pain, 2 irritability, 1 
tenderness, 1 crying, 1 urticaria). In the 1 month following dose 2, 5.5% (113/2031) of subjects who 
received MenACWY, experienced AEs that were deemed to be possibly or probably related to 
vaccinations. The most common preferred terms were irritability and rash. Five (5) subjects (0.2%) 
experienced severe AEs during this time period that were deemed to be possibly or probably related to 
the vaccinations (1 pyrexia, 1 viral rash, and 3 eating disorders). 
1.3.3.4.  Serious adverse events and deaths 
Deaths 
Five (5) subjects died during the study period in the 8 studies included for the proposed indication 
(infants/toddlers): 3 in V59P14 (auto accident, lung infection, sepsis of undetermined origin) and in 2 
in V59P23 (cardiorespiratory failure probably due to congenital cardiopathy, acute bronchopneumonia). 
Additional 7 subjects died (6 in study V59P23; septic shock, respiratory failure, sudden death 
(pneumonitis), cardiac arrest, anomalous pulmonary venous connection, head injury due to fall - and 1 
in V59P36; cardiac arrest -  were reported to MAH after the interim cutoff) but were outside of the 
dataset included in this submission. None of the deaths were assessed as possibly or probably related 
to the MenACWY vaccine. 
Serious adverse events 
During the infant series 3.0% and 2.6% of subjects experienced any SAEs in the MenACWY and control 
groups, respectively. In the period between the infant series and the toddler dose 2.6% and 3.0% of 
subjects experienced any SAEs in the MenACWY and control groups, respectively. Less than 1% of 
subjects in both groups experienced any SAEs after the toddler dose. For the follow-up period about 
1% in both groups experienced any SAEs. The percentages of older infant/toddler subjects who 
experienced any SAEs 1 month post dose 1 was 0.4% and 0.9% in the MenACWY and MenC groups, 
respectively. For the infants, the most common SAEs for all 4 time periods included ailments 
consolidated into a category called “wheezing” followed by “pneumonia”. The older infant/toddler 
subjects experienced very few SAEs.

a Consolidated Terms derived from any subject with the following MedDRA Preferred Terms: 
A total of 16 suspected related SAEs were reported in the studies contributing to the provided 
Summary of Clinical Safety, of which 15 were possibly related to MenACWY. These included four cases 
of febrile convulsion (3 in V59P14, 1 in V59P23), one case of complex partial seizure (V59P14), one 
case of epilepsy (V59P23), one case of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (V59P23), groin abscess 
(V59P23),  hospitalisation due to diarrhoea, vomiting and pyrexia (V59P22), pyrexia (V59P23) and 
three cases of kawasaki’s disease (1 in V59P14 and 2 in V59P23). Two possibly related SAEs were 
reported with the adjuvanted formulations in study V59P5 (supraventricular tachycardia and idiopathic 
thrombocytopenic purpura). 
Kawasaki’s disease is discussed in the section on immunological disorders. 
1.3.3.5.  Laboratory findings 
Not applicable. 
1.3.3.6.  Safety in special populations 
Analysis of reactogenicity by gender 
Overall, no major differences in the reactogenicity profiles after MenACWY vaccination were observed 
between the genders in infants and in older infant/toddler subjects. The percentages of subjects who 
experienced any, any severe, any local, any local moderate and severe, any systemic, any severe 
systemic, and any other reactions differed by no more than 2% in female and male infant subjects 
after any vaccination, and no more than 3% in older infant/toddler subjects. Differences between the 
genders were not unidirectional. 
Analysis of reactogenicity by race 
There were some differences in the percentages of infant subjects who experienced any reactions when 
the data was analysed by race, however these were generally small and sample sizes for especially the 
control groups in the different race strata were relatively small. In older infant/toddler subjects almost 
all of the subjects who received MenC were Caucasian, making it difficult to compare AE rates by race. 
Analysis of reactogenicity by geographic location 
After the first vaccination at 2 months, more subjects in both the MenACWY and control groups in Latin 
America experienced tenderness, erythema, and induration than did the V59P14 US and V59P23 US 
Assessment report

subjects. Higher percentages of the LA subjects experienced erythema after the 4-month and 6-month 
vaccinations. The MenACWY group had a similar or lower incidence of these local reactions compared 
to the control group, within a study after each vaccination. The percentages of subjects who 
experienced severe reactions following vaccination at the 4 time periods were low and similar between 
the groups, although severe tenderness was more commonly experienced in the LA groups than in the 
US groups following the 2-month and 4-month vaccinations. These differences were not apparent 
following subsequent vaccinations. 
There were differences in the percentages of subjects who experienced any systemic reactions 
between the US and LA subjects. Overall, fewer LA than US subjects experienced change in eating 
habits, persistent crying, sleepiness, and irritability. More Latin American subjects experienced rash 
and fever compared to the US subjects. The percentages of subjects who experienced severe systemic 
reactions following vaccination were low and similar between the groups within a study as well as 
across studies. 
1.3.3.7.  Immunological events 
One case of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), an immune mediated disease of the brain, 
was reported. A 13 month old boy enrolled in study V59P23 developed acute disseminated 
encephalomyelitis 35 days following receipt of a fourth dose of MenACWY. No evidence was found of an 
active infection. At the time of preparation for the submission the case had not recovered. 
Kawasaki’s disease (KD) 
There were 7 cases of Kawasaki in the clinical studies for the MenACWY. Of these, 6 occurred in 
infants/toddlers and one in a 3 year old who received an adjuvanted formulation (>3 months after 
vaccination). For this latter case, MAH’s clinical experts felt the evidence did not support a diagnosis of 
Kawasaki’s disease. 
Of the 6 cases in infants three were judged to be possibly related to vaccination, as they occurred 
within 30 days following vaccination. The remaining cases were not judged to be related as in two 
cases onset was more than 3 months after vaccination and in one case the subject did not receive 
MenACWY. 
A conservative calculation of the incidence of KD in children up to 2 years of age who received the final 
formulation of MenACWY in clinical studies is 38 in 100,000 (6 cases in more than 13,000 subject-
years of surveillance for all studies). This is not inconsistent with the range of estimates for Kawasaki’s 
disease of between 9 and 100 per 100,000 person-years from surveillance studies2. The MAH argued 
that it should also be considered that the intensity and completeness of surveillance within a vaccine 
study for adverse events such as Kawasaki’s disease might be higher than within routine epidemiologic 
studies. Other vaccine studies, notably the recent rotavirus prelicensure studies, have identified similar 
or higher rates of Kawasaki’s disease than routine surveillance studies have found. For example, a rate 
of 54/100,000 with Rotarix has been reported3.  
Finally, higher disease rates are well-known to occur in Asian countries and in children of Asian 
ancestry. An incidence rate of 146 per 100,000 person-years in infants below 1 year of age is reported 
from Taiwan4. Although only 795 infants of the 7744 subjects from study V59P23 were enrolled in 
Taiwan, 3 of the 6 cases of Kawasaki’s disease were reported from that country.

The MAH conclusion was that considering all the known facts about Kawasaki’s disease and the cases 
from the MenACWY program, including the randomisation ratio of the studies, the lack of consistent 
temporal relationship to vaccination, the geographical clustering of the cases and the comparison of 
overall rates to those reported in the literature, this does not represent an increased risk of Kawasaki’s 
disease in MenACWY recipients. According to the MAH, this conclusion was also supported by similar 
findings obtained in the pivotal registration and post-marketing studies for other recent infant vaccines 
such as Prevnar, Rotateq, and Rotarix. 
1.3.3.8.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No vaccine-vaccine interactions in terms of solicited reactions or unsolicited AEs were observed. 
1.3.3.9.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Overall, for the infants 0.7% (40/5563) of subjects in the 4-dose MenACWY group and 0.5% (8/1623) 
in the 4-dose control group experienced treatment-emergent AEs that led to withdrawal from the study 
in which they occurred. For the older infants/toddlers, 0.1% (3/2180) of subjects in the 2-dose 
MenACWY group experienced AEs that led to withdrawal from the study in which they occurred, 
compared to 0.2% (1/537) in the 1-dose MenACWY group, and 0% (0/229) in the MenC group.  
A listing of the possibly/probably related treatment-emergent AEs leading to premature withdrawal 
from the study is presented in Table 41. All subjects recovered completely from the AEs that led to 
their withdrawal from the study they were participating in, except for a subject with a case of acute 
disseminated encephalomyelitis that is gradually improving.

1.3.3.10.  Post marketing experience 
MenACWY was approved for use in persons 11 years and above on March 15, 2010. MenACWY adverse 
events cases received by the MAH were analysed for a periodic safety update report (data lock point on 
14 March 2011) submitted to European authorities. The evaluations showed no increased frequency of 
listed reactions, no fatal cases, no drug interactions and no effects on pregnancy or lactation. No 
vaccine related effect has been evident in any subgroup of vaccinees.

1.3.3.11.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The provided integrated safety analysis considered 8.932 infants and toddlers aged 2 months to 23 
months received the final formulation of MenACWY, which were included in the different studies 
included in this submission. More subjects in this age group were however exposed, overall only 
subjects who received the final formulation are considered. Children receiving earlier formulations, 
including adjuvanted formulations, are not included in this discussion of safety. However, for serious 
adverse events possibly related to vaccination these will be mentioned. 
With regards to reactogenicity, it has to be noted that the majority of MenC subjects were included in 
study V59P22, where temperature was measured rectally whilst in other studies temperature was 
measured axillary. So although MenC (menjugate) seems more reactogenic, this could be skewed due 
to the different measurement methods applied in studies. As expected, reactogenicity decreased with 
age and with dose. 
Although the difference in reported fever between subjects receiving MenC (41%) and MenACWY 
(12%, 10%) could possibly be explained by a different measurement method applied in study V59P22, 
the difference with regards to other systemic reactions reported such as diarrhoea, irritability, change 
in eating habits, sleepiness and persistent crying cannot. In conclusion, reported systemic 
reactogenicity does appear higher with older infant/toddler subjects receiving MenC as compared to 
those receiving MenACWY. Systemic reactogenicity also seems lower following the second dose as 
compared to the first dose. 
With regards to possibly or probably related treatment adverse events there is very little difference 
between the older infants / toddlers and the infants receiving the full infant series. 
Kawasaki disease is the most common cause of multisystem vasculitis in childhood, a leading cause of 
acquired cardiac disease of children in the developed countries. Epidemiologic findings indicate the 
presence of considerable genetic components in the aetiology; however it is genetically complex, with 
many genes contributing modest effects to the overall risk, and no single gene “causing” the disease. 
Specific environmental triggers remain to be identified. Pronounced seasonality and clustering of cases 
has led to believe an infectious agent is involved. Recent studies indicate a potential role for 
staphylococcal and streptococcal toxins in the pathology of Kawasaki’s disease, however this remains 
controversial. Although it cannot be excluded, and Kawasaki has been reported following vaccination, a 
clear increased risk of Kawasaki’s disease associated with vaccination has not been identified5, 
although it is included in the labelling for Rotateq in the US.  
Three possibly related cases of Kawasaki disease occurred in the infants included in clinical studies. In 
their calculations the MAH remained conservative and includes all six cases in infants under the age of 
two years. This produced an incidence of 38 in 100.000, which the MAH noted to be consistent with 
reported rates in other vaccine trial settings, referring to the Rotarix trial. It is agreed with the MAH 
that geographic location is an important factor, and reported rates vary from <10 per 100.000 in the 
UK to >200 per 100.000 in Japan. In Taiwan the reported rate between 2003 and 2006 was 69 per 
100.000, with a peak in summer6, which is lower than the rate reported by Chang et al (146 per 
100.000). Considering this rate it is striking that in the 795 children included from Taiwan, 3 cases of 
Kawasaki’s disease occurred (a rate of almost 400 per 100.000). This is higher than expected, even for 
that region. A possible explanation could be the trial setting, and intensive monitoring, however it is 
thought that an epidemiological study with the aim of estimating the incidence of Kawasaki disease 
should be able to pick up all the majority of cases as well, especially considering the severity of the 
disease. It has to be noted that these Taiwanese cases occurred 20 and 149 days after receiving

MenACWY, and the third case did not receive any MenACWY. Therefore only one case considered here 
is possibly related (in a 12 week old girl who received Infanrix and Prevnar along with MenACWY). 
It is agreed with the MAH that there is currently no clear evidence for an increased risk of Kawasaki 
associated with vaccination with MenACWY. However, the situation should be monitored carefully, 
especially in areas where subjects seem more genetically disposed to Kawasaki’s (such as Japan, 
Korea, Taiwan etc), as there are few cases that are considered possibly related to vaccination it cannot 
be excluded that MenACWY is capable of triggering Kawasaki disease. 
With regards to discontinuation, the cases leading to discontinuation are limited to the subjects in the 
studies that are included in the integrated safety analysis of the MAH for this variation application. Not 
all data of for example study V59P23 is included, and only subjects who received the final formulation 
have been considered. 
1.3.3.12.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
MenACWY was well tolerated and had a comparable safety profile compared to comparator vaccines in 
these 8,932 infants and toddlers (12-23 months) included in the provided integrated safety analysis. 
Expectedly, reactogenicity decreased with age and with dose. The majority of local and systemic 
reactions reported after MenACWY occurred within the first 3 days post-vaccination; they were mostly 
of mild to moderate severity and transient duration. There were no increases in adverse events as 
compared to comparator vaccines included in the different studies. Reported systemic reactogenicity 
appeared higher following MenC compared to MenACWY in older infants/toddlers.  
Except for the cases of Kawasaki disease, there are no other concerns regarding adverse events or 
serious adverse events.   
It is agreed with the MAH that there is currently no clear evidence for an increased risk of Kawasaki 
associated with vaccination with MenACWY. However, Kawasaki is a serious disease, and based on the 
current data a potential association with MenACWY cannot be fully excluded. Therefore the situation 
should be monitored carefully, especially in areas where subjects seem more genetically disposed to 
Kawasaki’s (such as Japan, Korea, Taiwan etc), as there are few cases that are considered possibly 
related to vaccination it cannot be excluded that MenACWY is capable of triggering Kawasaki disease. 
Based on available information, update of Product Information or other regulatory action, however, is 
currently not deemed required.

The MAH should provide to the CHMP also results of Study V59_53 (co-administration of Menveo with 
travellers vaccines), which were due by the end of 2012. 
1.4.  Update of the Product information 
Following major objections raised by the CHMP to the initially proposed extension of the therapeutic 
indication, the MAH change the scope of the variation. Taking into account the requirement to reflect 
results of studies conducted in line with the agreed PIP, while maintaining the SmPC useful for 
healthcare professionals and not unduly promotional, the CHMP proposed the following changes to the 
Product Information (PI), to which the MAH agreed: 
Summary of Product Characteristics 
4.2 Posology and method of administration 
Paediatric population (under 2 years of age) 
The safety and efficacy of Menveo in children under 2 years of age has not yet been 
established.  Currently available data are described in section 5.1 but no recommendation on a 
posology can be made. 
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties 
Available data in children 2 to 23 months of age 
The immunogenicity of Menveo in children 2 to 23 months of age was evaluated in several 
studies. Although a high percentage of subjects achieved hSBA titres above 1:8 following 4-
dose series of Menveo, with lower percentages in studies of 2-dose series and of a single dose, 
Menveo was compared to another meningococcal vaccine in only one pivotal study, where it 
failed to show a response at least equivalent to a monovalent conjugated serotype C vaccine 
(after a single dose at the age of 12 months). Currently available data are not sufficient to 
establish the efficacy of Menveo in children under 2 years of age. See section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use. 
Initially proposed changes in SmPC sections 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8 were not supported, as they would be 
appropriate only in case if extension of the indication was supported. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current QRD template.

2.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Due to the low incidence rates of MenACWY disease it is not considered feasible to generate clinical 
efficacy data for licensing, therefore the evaluation of efficacy was based on the measurement of 
functional antibodies using rSBA and, mainly, hSBA assays. An hSBA titre of 1:4 has been established 
as a correlate for protection for serogroup C, which is considered a confident measure for clinical 
protection. From this correlate the value of the immune response for other serogroups is inferred, for 
which no official correlate has been established. 
Beneficial effects 
In Europe, cases of meningococcal disease occur sporadically, but occasionally outbreaks can be an 
important cause of illness and death. Serogroups B and C cause the majority of reported cases in 
Europe, North and South America, while serogroup A causes the majority of disease in Africa and Asia. 
The total number of laboratory confirmed cases in the 29 EU/EEA countries of invasive meningococcal 
disease caused by serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y in the year 2007 was 918 (10 serogroup A, 684 
serogroup C, 105 serogroup W-135 and 119 serogroup Y). The fatality rate is highest for serogroup C 
and Y (14%), as compared to W-135 (7-8%).  
An effective vaccine could potentially prevent ~1000 cases of invasive meningococcal disease and save 
~125 lives in the EU/EEA countries annually. Menveo also has the potential to protect subjects who 
travel to other continents against serogroups that are rare in Europe (A and W-135).  
The highest incidence of meningococcal disease is seen among infants < 1 year, followed by children 
1-4 years.  Thus, the potential to save lives and prevent serious disease is especially large in the age 
group of 2-23 months.   
The possible benefits of MenACWY over currently available vaccines are the presence of additional 
serogroups, in order to provide broader protection (to A, W and Y) in settings where this would be 
necessary. Secondly, plain polysaccharide vaccines are known to be less effective compared to 
conjugated vaccines in infants and young children and they do not mount a booster response. After 
repeated injections the response is less than for the first primary response, a term referred to as 
hyporesponsiveness. Moreover, plain polysaccharidal MenACWY vaccines are indicated from 2 years 
onwards only. 
The MAH proposed different dosing schedules for infants (2-6 months), older infants and toddlers (6-
23 months) and toddlers who are “at risk of exposure”(12-23 months). 
For infants aged 2 months four doses at 2, 4, 6 and 12-16 months were proposed. The seroresponse 
(% with hSBA ≥ 1:8, 95%CI) after four doses was 94% (87,98), 98% (92,100),  100% (96,100) and 
100% (96,100) for serogroup A, C, W and Y respectively (PP population, US1a & US2 V59P14). 
A 2 dose schedule was proposed for older infants and toddlers (>6 - 23 months).  Following one dose 
given between 6 and 9 months of age, 24-50%, 78-88%, 37-68%, 31-68% of subjects achieved hSBA 
≥1:8 for serogroups A,C,W and Y respectively. A second dose given at 12 months increased the 
response to 88-90%, 96-100%, 96-100%, 92-96% with hSBA ≥1:8. In study V59P14 a first dose of 
MenACWY given at 12 months of age resulted in a seroresponse (% with hSBA ≥ 1:8) one month after 
vaccination of 74%, 91% 79% and 72% for serogroup A, C, W and Y respectively. A second dose given 
at 15 months of age increased the seroresponse to 97%, 100%, 100% and 100% for serogroups A, C, 
W and Y.

A one dose schedule was proposed for children from 12-23 months of age, in “emergency situations”. 
The data from different studies show that the response after one dose is moderate and variable 
between studies ranging from 49-75% for serogroup A, 35-93% for serogroup C, 58-93% for 
serogroup W, 49-72% for serogroup Y.   
In the different phase III trials co-administration with childhood vaccines was evaluated. There was no 
evidence of clinically relevant interference of MenACWY with diphteria, tetanus, IPV, HBV, and Hib in 
infants (2-6 months) or with MMRV, Tdap and Hib booster in toddlers.  
Persistence of bactericidal antibodies was measured in study V59P14 and study V59P22. Study V59P14 
provided data to show persistence for 6 and 10 months. The percentage of US subjects with hSBA≥1:8 
six months after their 3rd dose for serogroups A, C, W & Y was 12%, 52%, 69% and 60% respectively. 
After ten months, in LA subjects, this was 15%, 26%, 63% and 52% respectively. Study V59P22 
provided limited persistence data up to 6-18 months (mean: 7 months) for two doses of MenACWY 
given at 6-8months and 12 months of age (group I), one dose of MenACWY given at 12 months of age 
(group II) and one dose of Menjugate given at 12 months of age (Group III). The percentage of 
subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 6-18 months after their last dose for serogroup A was 31% and 7%, for 
serogroup W 75% and 71%, and for serogroup Y 79% anfd 79% 69% and 60% respectively for group 
I and II respectively. For serogroup C the percentage with hSBA≥1:8 was 71%, 64% and 54% for 
group I, II and III respectively, indicating similar or better persistence with MenACWY compared to 
Menjugate. 
There was evidence of the induction of immunologic memory therefore it can be concluded that 
MenACWY exhibits the characteristics of a glycoconjugate vaccine. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
No data on prevention of meningococcal disease have been generated for MenACWY. There is no data 
on efficacy and safety in children with complement disorders or with functional or actual asplenia. 
Non-inferiority of MenACWY to a conjugated monovalent MenC vaccine has not been demonstrated. 
One comparative trial with a conjugated monovalent MenC vaccine (V59P22) failed to demonstrate 
non-inferiority of MenACWY over the monovalent MenC vaccine. Results of this study were further 
weakened by identification of GCP issues at one of the sites included in this study, following which 
results from this site had to be excluded and power of the study decreased.  
Across the studies there was considerable variability in the immune response to MenACWY.  
There was also seen a risk of subjects being unprotected in the window after the third infant dose and 
before the fourth dose.  The levels of bactericidal antibodies against serogroup A and to some extent 
serogroup C were rapidly declining in that interval.   
In the different phase III trials co-administration with childhood vaccines was evaluated. Co-
administration of conjugate pneumococcal vaccine with MenACWY led to a somewhat decreased 
response to several pneumococcal antigens. The relevance of this decreased response is unknown. 
With regards to the response to pertussis antigens, non-inferiority of concomitant vaccination with 
MenACWY to vaccination without MenACWY could not be demonstrated for LA subjects for pertactin 
only. However, as this could be demonstrated for US subjects, and for PT/FHA, and no statistically 
significant difference was found considering seroresponse rates, this finding is unlikely to be 
significant. 
Long-term follow up in ongoing clinical studies would provide more persistence data in the future.

There is insufficient comparative data with a monovalent conjugate MenC vaccine demonstrating equal 
persistence for MenC and no long term persistence data for all serogroups in this age group. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
MenACWY was well tolerated and had a comparable safety profile compared to comparator vaccines in 
these 8,978 infants and toddlers (12-23 months) included in the integrated safety analysis. As 
expected, reactogenicity decreased with age and with dose. The majority of local and systemic 
reactions reported after MenACWY occurred within the first 3 days post-vaccination; they were mostly 
of mild to moderate severity and transient duration. There were no increases in adverse events as 
compared to comparator vaccines included in the different studies. Reported systemic reactogenicity 
appeared higher following MenC compared to MenACWY in older infants/toddlers. Except for the cases 
of Kawasaki disease, there are no other concerns regarding adverse events or serious adverse events. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The unfavourable effects, including the reactogenicity, have been precisely described. However, by 
introducing Menveo in to a larger population including subjects with co-morbidities, rare conditions 
may occur that could be related to vaccine use. 
There is currently no clear evidence for an increased risk of Kawasaki associated with vaccination with 
MenACWY. However, Kawasaki is a serious disease, and based on the current data a potential 
association with MenACWY cannot be excluded. Therefore the situation should be monitored carefully, 
especially in areas where subjects seem more genetically disposed to Kawasaki’s (such as Japan, 
Korea, Taiwan etc), as there are few cases that are considered possibly related to vaccination it cannot 
be excluded that MenACWY is capable of triggering Kawasaki disease. However, update of the SmPC in 
this regard is not currently warranted. 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Presence of additional serogroups compared to monovalent conjugated meningococcal C vaccines is of 
limited benefit within the EU, as only very few cases of invasive disease due to serogroups A, W and Y 
are registered in the EU annually in comparison with cases caused by serogroup C. Protection against 
these additional serogroups is more important to those children at increased risk of exposure due to 
travel or in situation of an outbreak. A potential loss in immunity to serogroup C as a result of reduced 
immunogenicity of MenACWY as compared to conjugated monovalent MenC vaccines would possibly 
undermine this small gain achieved by adding types A, W and Y. Moreover, it is considered quite 
important that when a child is vaccinated optimal protection is achieved. 
In any case the optimal dosing regimen should be identified, which is especially important in those 
settings where children are at increased risk of exposure. 
The possible risk of Kawasaki disease is considered an important unfavourable effect; however it is not 
possible to determine whether the association between MenACWY and Kawasaki disease is causal or 
coincidental.

Benefit-risk balance 
Loss in protection against serogroup C should be balanced against the gain achieved by adding types 
A, W and Y. It is unclear whether optimal protection is achieved under the proposed dosing regimens. 
Consequently a proportion of vaccinated subjects could be unprotected in their first year of life (i.e. in 
between the 3rd and 4th dose of the infant schedule), and a relatively large proportion of vaccinated 
toddlers who are at increased risk of exposure could be unprotected following the single dose 
recommendation. Therefore, since the above described concerns raised by the CHMP have not been 
adequately addressed, a positive risk balance in children aged 2 – 23 months cannot be established. 
Since the efficacy concerns are specific to the age group of 2 – 23 month and no new major safety 
concerns have been identified, this do not affect the benefit-risk balance in the currently approved 
indication, which remains positive. 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
The MAH changed the scope of the requested variation from extension of the indication (to include 
children aged 2-23 months) to update of the SmPC with results from studies conducted in this age 
group. Major objections identified through the assessment of this data remain unsolved, however they 
are specific to the age group of 2-23 months, therefore do not affect the benefit-risk balance in the 
currently approved indication. It is, however, supported to summarise the available data in section 5.1 
of the SmPC, and make corresponding changes in section 4.2. 
GCP issues were identified at one of the study sites of study V59P22, following which it was decided to 
remove the data generated at this site from the final analysis of results. In the agreed PIP it was 
stated that at least 660 infants would be enrolled and randomized in study V59P22. Due to the GCP 
issues, data from only 594 infants is included in the analysis, limiting the power of the study. However, 
the main findings and conclusions of the trial remained unaffected, namely non-inferiority to a 
monovalent conjugated MenC vaccine could not be demonstrated. Findings from study V59P22 
therefore remain valid and should be reflected in the SmPC, and the study still contributes to the PIP. 
Therefore and The CHMP is of the opinion that the studies conducted are in conformity with the agreed 
paediatric investigation plan P/93/2011. 
Finally, the CHMP concludes that changes to the SmPC as described above are acceptable.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Daurismo is indicated, in combination with low-dose cytarabine, for the treatment of newly diagnosed
de novo or secondary acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in adult patients who are not candidates for 
standard induction chemotherapy. 
2
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Daurismo should only be prescribed by or under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use
of anticancer medicinal products.
Posology
The recommended dose is 100 mg glasdegib once daily in combination with low-dose cytarabine (see 
section 5.1). Glasdegib should be continued as long as the patient is deriving clinical benefit.
Delayed or missed doses of glasdegib
If a dose is vomited, a replacement dose should not be administered; patients should wait until the next 
scheduled dose is due. If a dose is missed or not taken at the usual time, then it should be taken as soon 
as the patient remembers unless more than 10 hours have passed since the scheduled dosing time, in 
which case the patient should not take the missed dose. Patients should not take 2 doses at the same 
time to make up for a missed dose. 
Dose modifications
Dose modifications may be required based on individual safety and tolerability. If dose reduction is 
necessary, then the dose of glasdegib should be reduced to 50 mg taken orally once daily. 
Dose modification and management guidelines for specific adverse reactions are provided in Tables 1, 
2, 3 and 4.
No starting dose adjustments are required on the basis of patient age, race, gender, or body weight (see 
section 5.2).
Assessment and monitoring of laboratory and QT abnormalities 
Complete blood counts, electrolytes, renal, and hepatic function should be assessed prior to the 
initiation of Daurismo and at least once weekly for the first month. Electrolytes and renal function 
should be monitored once monthly for the duration of therapy. Serum creatine kinase (CK) levels 
should be obtained prior to initiating Daurismo and as indicated clinically thereafter (e.g., if muscle 
signs and symptoms are reported). Electrocardiograms (ECGs) should be monitored prior to the 
initiation of Daurismo, approximately one week after initiation, and then once monthly for the next 
two months to assess for QT corrected for heart rate (QTc) prolongation. ECG should be repeated if 
abnormal. Certain patients may require more frequent and ongoing ECG monitoring (see section 4.4). 
Abnormalities should be managed promptly.

Dose modification for concomitant use with moderate CYP3A4 inducers
Concomitant use of Daurismo with moderate CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided. If concomitant use 
of moderate CYP3A4 inducers cannot be avoided, the dose of Daurismo should be increased as 
tolerated as shown in Table 5. After the moderate CYP3A4 inducer has been discontinued for 7 days, 
the Daurismo dose taken prior to initiating the moderate CYP3A4 inducer should be resumed (see 
section 4.5).

Special populations
Hepatic impairment
No dose adjustments are recommended in patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment
(see section 5.2).
Renal impairment
No dose adjustments are recommended for patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment.
No data are available in patients requiring haemodialysis (see section 5.2).
Elderly (≥ 65 years of age)
No dose adjustment in elderly patients is required (see section 5.2).
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Daurismo in the paediatric population (< 18 years of age) have not been 
established. Daurismo should not be used in the paediatric population because there is no expected 
significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for paediatric patients (see section 5.1).
Method of administration 
Daurismo is for oral use. It may be taken with or without food.
Patients should be encouraged to take their dose at approximately the same time each day.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Embryo-foetal toxicity
Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal embryo-foetal developmental toxicity 
studies, Daurismo can cause embryo-foetal death or severe birth defects when administered to a 
pregnant woman. Pregnant women should be advised of the potential risk to the foetus (see section 
4.6). 
Daurismo should not be used during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using 
contraception. The pregnancy status of female patients of childbearing potential should be verified 
prior to initiating treatment with Daurismo. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to 
always use effective contraception during treatment with Daurismo and for at least 30 days after the 
last dose (see section 4.6).
Males
Glasdegib may be present in semen. Male patients with female partners should be advised of the 
potential risk of exposure through semen and to always use effective contraception, including a 
condom (with spermicide, if available), even after vasectomy, to avoid exposure of a pregnant partner 
or a female partner of childbearing potential during treatment with Daurismo and for at least 30 days 
after the last dose (see section 4.6).
If a female patient or female partner of a male patient becomes pregnant, or suspects a pregnancy 
during treatment with Daurismo or during the 30 days after the last dose, they must inform their 
healthcare provider immediately (see section 4.6).
7
Based on non-clinical safety findings, glasdegib has the potential to impair reproductive function in
males. Men should seek advice on effective fertility preservation prior to initiating treatment with 
Daurismo (see section 4.6).
QT interval prolongation 
In a randomised study (Study 1) of patients with AML and high-risk MDS (myelodysplastic 
syndrome) treated with Daurismo with low-dose cytarabine vs. low-dose cytarabine alone, Grade 3/4 
ECG QT prolonged was reported in 3.5% of patients treated with Daurismo with low-dose cytarabine
compared to 2.4% of the patients treated with low-dose cytarabine alone.
Electrolytes should be assessed prior to initiation of Daurismo, at least once weekly for the first 
month, and then once monthly for the duration of therapy. Electrolyte abnormalities should be 
corrected.
Concomitant medicinal products should be assessed. For medicinal products that have known 
QT prolonging effects and/or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor potential, alternatives should be considered.
ECGs should be monitored prior to the initiation of Daurismo, approximately one week after initiation, 
and then once monthly for the next two months to assess for QTc prolongation. In patients with 
congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, electrolyte abnormalities, or those who are 
taking medicinal products with known QT prolonging effects, more frequent ECG monitoring is 
recommended. ECG should be repeated if abnormal. Abnormalities should be managed promptly, and 
dose modifications should be considered (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).
Muscle-related adverse events
In Study 1, muscle spasms were observed in 22.6% of patients treated with Daurismo with low-dose 
cytarabine compared to 4.8% of the patients treated with low-dose cytarabine alone.
All patients starting therapy with Daurismo must be informed of the risk of muscle-related adverse 
events. They must be instructed to report promptly any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or 
weakness occurring during treatment with Daurismo or if symptoms persist after discontinuing 
treatment.
Serum CK levels should be obtained prior to initiating Daurismo and as clinically indicated thereafter 
(e.g., if muscle signs and symptoms are reported). Management of high-grade CK elevation based on 
current standards of medical practice and following appropriate treatment guidelines is recommended. 
Dose modification or management recommendations should be followed (see section 4.2).
Renal impairment
Patients with pre-existing renal impairment or risk factors for renal dysfunction should be monitored 
closely. Renal function should be assessed prior to initiation of therapy and at least once weekly for 
the first month of therapy with Daurismo. Electrolytes and renal function should be monitored once 
monthly for the duration of therapy (see section 4.2). 
Excipients
Lactose intolerance
Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or 
glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.
Sodium content
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
'sodium-free'.

4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Effects of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of glasdegib
In vitro, CYP3A4 is responsible for the majority of glasdegib depletion and contributed to the 
formation of other minor oxidative metabolites, with CYP2C8 and UGT1A9 playing a minor role in 
the metabolism of glasdegib. 
Substances that may increase glasdegib plasma concentration
CYP3A4 inhibitors
Ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, dosed at 400 mg once daily for 7 days, increased the 
mean area under the curve (AUCinf) by ~2.4-fold and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) by 40% 
of a single 200 mg oral dose of glasdegib in healthy subjects. Caution should be used when 
administering concomitantly with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., boceprevir, cobicistat, conivaptan, 
itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, telaprevir, troleandomycin, voriconazole, ritonavir, 
grapefruit or grapefruit juice) as an increase in glasdegib plasma concentration may occur. If possible, 
alternate concomitant medicinal product with no or minimal CYP3A4 inhibition potential is 
recommended (see section 4.4).
Gastric pH altering medicinal products
Coadministration of a single 100 mg glasdegib dose under fasted condition with multiple doses of the 
proton-pump inhibitor (PPI), rabeprazole, resulted in no change in glasdegib plasma exposure (AUCinf
ratio: 100.6%). Concomitant administration of glasdegib with acid-reducing agents (including PPIs, 
H2-receptor antagonists, and locally acting antacids) is permitted.
Substances that may decrease glasdegib plasma concentration
CYP3A4 inducers
Rifampicin, a strong inducer of CYP3A4, administered at a dose of 600 mg once daily for 11 days, 
reduced the mean AUCinf by 70% and Cmax by 35% of a single 100 mg dose of glasdegib in healthy 
subjects. Concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampicin, carbamazepine, 
enzalutamide, mitotane, phenytoin and St. John’s Wort) should be avoided, as this is likely to decrease 
glasdegib plasma concentrations. 
Simulations using physiologic-based pharmacokinetic modelling suggested that coadministration of 
efavirenz (a moderate inducer of CYP3A4) with glasdegib decreased glasdegib AUCinf by 55% and 
Cmax by 25%. Concomitant use of moderate CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., bosentan, efavirenz, etravirine, 
modafinil, nafcillin) should be avoided as they may also reduce glasdegib plasma concentrations (see 
section 4.4). If concomitant use of moderate CYP3A4 inducers cannot be avoided, the dose of 
Daurismo should be increased (see section 4.2).
Effect of glasdegib on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products
Pharmacodynamic interactions
Medicinal products known to prolong QT interval
Glasdegib may prolong QT interval. Therefore, the concomitant use of glasdegib with other medicinal 
products known to prolong QT interval or induce Torsades de Pointes should be carefully considered 
(see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Pharmacokinetic interactions
Drug transporters
In vitro studies indicated that glasdegib may have the potential to inhibit P-glycoprotein (P-gp, 
gastrointestinal [GI] tract) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, systemically and at the GI 
tract) mediated transport at clinically relevant concentrations. Therefore, narrow therapeutic index 
substrates of P-gp (e.g., digoxin) or BCRP should be used with caution in combination with glasdegib. 
9
In vitro studies of transporter inhibition
In vitro studies indicated that glasdegib may have the potential to inhibit (MATE)1 and MATE2K at 
clinically relevant concentrations.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females
If Daurismo is used in women of childbearing potential, they should be advised to avoid becoming 
pregnant. The pregnancy status of female patients of childbearing potential should be verified prior 
to initiating treatment. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking Daurismo, the patient should be 
apprised of the potential hazard to the foetus.
Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal embryo-foetal developmental studies, 
Daurismo can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing
potential who are receiving this medicinal product should always use effective contraception during 
treatment with Daurismo and for at least 30 days after the last dose. If a female patient becomes 
pregnant, or suspects a pregnancy, during treatment with Daurismo or during the 30 days after the last 
dose, she must notify her healthcare provider immediately (see section 4.4).
Males
Glasdegib may be present in semen. Male patients should not donate semen during treatment with 
Daurismo and for at least 30 days after the last dose. Male patients with female partners should be 
advised of the potential risk of exposure through semen and to always use effective contraception, 
including a condom (with spermicide, if available), even after a vasectomy, to avoid exposure of a 
pregnant partner or a female partner of childbearing potential during treatment with Daurismo and for 
at least 30 days after the last dose. Male patients must inform their healthcare provider immediately if 
their female partner becomes pregnant during treatment with Daurismo or during the 30 days after the 
last dose (see section 4.4).
Pregnancy
There are no data on the use of Daurismo in pregnant women. Based on its mechanism of action and 
findings in animal embryo-foetal developmental toxicity studies, glasdegib can cause foetal harm 
when administered to a pregnant woman (see section 5.3). Daurismo should not be used during 
pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception (see section 4.4). 
Breast-feeding
No studies have been conducted in humans to assess the effect of glasdegib on milk production, its 
presence in breast milk, or its effects on the breast-fed child. It is unknown whether glasdegib and its 
metabolites are excreted in human milk. Given the potential for serious adverse reactions in 
breast-feeding children from glasdegib, breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment with 
Daurismo and for at least one week after the last dose (see section 5.3). 
Fertility
Based on non-clinical safety findings, glasdegib has the potential to impair reproductive function in 
males. Men should seek advice on effective fertility preservation prior to initiating treatment with 
Daurismo. Based on its mechanism of action, Daurismo may impair female fertility (see section 5.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Daurismo has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, patients 
experiencing fatigue or other symptoms (e.g., muscle cramps, pain, nausea) affecting the ability to 
react normally while taking Daurismo should exercise caution when driving or operating machines.
10
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The overall safety profile of Daurismo is based on data from clinical studies, including Study 1 in

Description of selected adverse reactions
Muscle spasms
In Study 1, muscle spasms (all grades) were reported in 22.6% of patients in the Daurismo with low-dose 
cytarabine arm compared to 4.8% in the low-dose cytarabine alone arm. Grades 3 and 4 muscle spasms 
were reported in 4.7% of patients in the Daurismo with low-dose cytarabine arm compared to none in 
the low-dose cytarabine alone arm.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
There is no specific antidote for Daurismo. Management of Daurismo overdose should consist of 
symptomatic treatment and ECG monitoring. 
Glasdegib has been administered in clinical studies up to a dose of 640 mg/day. The dose-limiting
toxicities reported were nausea, vomiting, dehydration, hypotension, fatigue, dizziness, hypoxia, 
pleural effusion and peripheral oedema.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XJ03
Mechanism of action
Glasdegib is an inhibitor of the Hedgehog (Hh) signal transduction pathway that binds to Smoothened 
(SMO), a transmembrane protein, leading to decreased Glioma-Associated Oncogene (GLI) 
transcription factor activity and downstream pathway signalling. Hh pathway signalling is required for 
maintaining a leukaemic stem cell (LSC) population thus, glasdegib binding to and inhibiting SMO 
reduces GLI1 levels in AML cells and the leukaemic initiating potential of AML cells. Hh pathway 
signalling is also implicated in resistance to chemotherapy and targeted therapy. In a preclinical model 
of AML, glasdegib in combination with low-dose cytarabine inhibited increases in tumour size to a 
greater extent than glasdegib or low-dose cytarabine alone. However, mechanism of action of the 
combination is not fully understood.
Cardiac electrophysiology
Heart rate corrected QT (QTc) interval prolongation has been observed in patients treated with 
Daurismo at a supratherapeutic dose of > 270 mg. The effect of glasdegib administration on corrected 
QT interval was evaluated in a randomised, single-dose, double-blind, 4-way crossover, placebo- and 
open-label moxifloxacin controlled study in 36 healthy subjects. At therapeutic plasma concentrations 
(achieved with a 150 mg single dose), the largest, placebo and baseline-adjusted corrected QT interval 
change was 8.03 msec (90% CI: 5.85, 10.22 msec). At approximately twice the therapeutic 
concentration (supratherapeutic, achieved with a 300 mg single dose), the QTc change was 13.43 msec 
13
(95% CI: 11.25, 15.61 msec). Moxifloxacin (400 mg), used as a positive control, showed a mean QTc 
change from baseline of 13.87 msec. None of the subjects met categorical criterion of absolute 
corrected QT interval of ≥ 480 msec or increase from baseline in corrected QT interval ≥ 30 msec after 
receiving any treatment. None of the ECG abnormalities were considered clinically significant or 
reported as adverse events by the investigator (see section 4.4).
Additionally, serial, triplicate ECGs were collected following a single and multiple dosing to evaluate 
the effect of single agent glasdegib on the corrected QT interval in 70 patients with advanced cancer 
(5 mg to 640 mg once daily). Based on the exposure-response analysis, the estimated mean change 
from baseline in QTc was 5.30 msec (95% CI: 4.40, 6.24 msec) at the mean observed Cmax at steady 
state following administration at the recommended 100 mg once daily dose of glasdegib.
Clinical efficacy and safety
Daurismo in combination with low-dose cytarabine was investigated in a multicentre, randomised, 
open-label Phase 2 study (Study 1) in a total of 132 patients, which included 116 patients with 
previously untreated de novo or secondary AML who were not eligible to receive intensive 
chemotherapy as defined by meeting at least one of the following criteria: a) age > 75 years, b) severe 
cardiac disease, c) baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 2, or 
d) baseline serum creatinine > 1.3 mg/dL. Patients were randomised 2:1 to receive Daurismo (100 mg 
orally once daily) with low-dose cytarabine (20 mg SC twice daily on days 1 to 10 of the 28-day 
cycle) (n=78) or low-dose cytarabine alone (n=38) in 28-day cycles until disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity. Patients were stratified at randomisation by prognostic risk factor 
(good/intermediate or poor) based on cytogenetics.
The baseline demographic and disease characteristics are shown in Table 7. The two treatment arms 
were generally balanced with respect to the baseline demographics and disease characteristics. Across 
both arms, 40% of the AML patients had poor cytogenetic risk and 60% had good/intermediate 
cytogenetic risk.
Efficacy was established by an improvement in overall survival (OS defined from the date of 
randomisation to death of any cause) in the Daurismo with low-dose cytarabine arm, compared to 
low-dose cytarabine alone. After a median follow-up of approximately 20 months with 81% deaths 
observed, the Daurismo with low-dose cytarabine arm was superior to low-dose cytarabine alone in 
AML patients (Figure 1). The efficacy results are shown in Table 8.

Improvement in OS was consistent across pre-specified subgroups by cytogenetic risk. 
Based on investigator reported response, a numerically higher complete response (CR) rate (defined as 
absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1000/μl, platelet count ≥ 100,000/μl, < 5% bone marrow blasts, 
16
transfusion independent, and no extramedullary disease) was achieved for AML patients in the 
Daurismo with low-dose cytarabine arm (17.9% [95% CI: 9.4%, 26.5%]) vs the low-dose cytarabine 
alone arm (2.6% [95% CI: 0.0%, 7.7%]).
Paediatric population
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Daurismo in all subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of AML (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption 
Following a single 100 mg dose of glasdegib, peak concentration in plasma is rapidly reached with the 
median Tmax of 2 hours. Following repeat 100 mg once daily dosing to steady state, glasdegib median 
Tmax ranged from approximately 1.3 hours to 1.8 hours.
Food effect
After oral administration of glasdegib tablets, the mean absolute bioavailability is 77.1% compared to 
intravenous administration. Administration of glasdegib with a high-fat, high-calorie meal resulted in 
16% lower exposure (AUCinf) compared to overnight fasting. The impact of food on the 
pharmacokinetics of glasdegib is not considered clinically relevant. Glasdegib may be administered 
with or without food.
Following 100 mg once daily glasdegib dosing, the mean (coefficient of variation, %CV) of glasdegib 
Cmax was 1,252 ng/mL (44%) and AUCtau was 17,210 ng•hr/mL (54%) in patients with cancer.
Distribution
Glasdegib is 91% bound to human plasma proteins in vitro. The mean (%CV) apparent volume of 
distribution (Vz/F) was 188 (20) L following a single dose of 100 mg glasdegib in patients with 
haematologic malignancies.
Biotransformation
The primary metabolic pathways for glasdegib were comprised of N-demethylation, glucuronidation, 
oxidation, and dehydrogenation. In plasma, the N-desmethyl and N-glucuronide metabolites of 
glasdegib accounted for 7.9% and 7.2% of the circulating radioactivity, respectively. Other 
metabolites in plasma individually accounted for < 5% of circulating radioactivity.
In vitro interaction studies
In vitro CYP inhibition and induction
In vitro studies indicated that glasdegib is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5 at clinically relevant concentrations. In vitro studies indicated 
that glasdegib is not an inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4 at clinically relevant 
concentrations.
In vitro studies of UGT inhibition 
In vitro studies indicated that glasdegib is not an inhibitor of uridine-diphosphate 
glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)1A4, UGT1A6, UGT2B7, and UGT2B15 at clinically relevant 
concentrations. Glasdegib may have the potential to inhibit UGT1A1, and possibly UGT1A9, 
however, clinically relevant drug-drug interactions are not expected.
17
In vitro studies of organic anion and cation transporter inhibition
In vitro studies indicated that glasdegib is not an inhibitor of organic anion transporting polypeptide 
(OATP)1B1, OATP1B3, organic anion transporter (OAT)1, OAT3, organic cation transporter 
(OCT)2, at clinically relevant concentrations.
Elimination
The mean ( SD) plasma half-life of glasdegib was 17.4  3.7 hours after a single dose of 100 mg 
glasdegib in patients. The geometric mean oral clearance after multiple dosing was 6.45 L/hr. 
Following oral administration of a 100 mg radiolabeled dose of glasdegib to healthy subjects, mean 
48.9% and 41.7% of the radioactivity dosed was recovered in urine and faeces, respectively. The 
overall mean mass balance of the dosed radioactivity in the excreta was 90.6%. Unchanged glasdegib 
was the major component of human plasma, accounting for 69.4% of the total drug-related material. 
Unchanged glasdegib recovered in the urine and faeces accounted for 17.2% and 19.5% of the dose, 
respectively.
Linearity/non-linearity
The steady state systemic glasdegib exposure (Cmax and AUCtau) increased in a dose-proportional 
manner over the dosing range of 5 mg to 600 mg once daily.
Special populations
Hepatic impairment
Data from a dedicated pharmacokinetic trial have shown that plasma exposures for total glasdegib 
(AUCinf and Cmax) were similar between subjects with normal hepatic function and subjects with
moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), whilst geometric mean AUCinf and Cmax values 
were 24% and 42% lower, respectively, for subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 
Class C), compared to the normal hepatic function group. The glasdegib unbound exposure (unbound 
AUCinf) is increased by 18% and 16% in subjects with moderate and severe impairment, respectively, 
relative to subjects with normal hepatic function. Peak glasdegib unbound exposure (unbound Cmax) 
increased by 1%, for moderate hepatic impairment and decreased by 11% for severe hepatic 
impairment, relative to subjects with normal hepatic function. These changes are not considered to be 
clinically relevant.
Renal impairment
Data from a dedicated pharmacokinetic trial in subjects with varying degrees of renal function
impairment indicate that total glasdegib exposure (AUCinf) increased by 105%, and 102 % with 
moderate (30 mL/min ≤ eGFR < 60 mL/min), and severe (eGFR < 30 mL/min) renal impairment, 
respectively, relative to subjects with normal (eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min) renal function. Peak glasdegib 
exposure (Cmax) increased by 37%, and 20% for subjects with moderate, and severe renal impairment, 
respectively, relative to subjects with normal renal function. These changes are not considered to be
clinically relevant.
Elderly 
In patients assigned to treatment with Daurismo with low-dose cytarabine (n=88; Study 1), 97.7% of 
the patients were aged 65 or older and 60.2% of the patients were aged 75 or older. Study 1 did not 
include a sufficient number of patients younger than age 65 to determine differences in adverse 
reactions reported from patients older than 65.
Age, race, gender, and body weight 
There are limited data in patients younger than 65 years of age. Population pharmacokinetic analyses 
in adult patients (n=269) indicate that there are no clinically relevant effects of age, gender, race, body 
weight on the pharmacokinetics of glasdegib.
18
5.3
Pre-clinical safety data
The primary target organ findings following repeat oral administration of glasdegib in rats and dogs 
for up to 26 and 39 weeks in duration, respectively, included the kidney (degeneration/necrosis) in rat 
and dog, the liver (necrosis/inflammation) in dog only, and the testis (degeneration), growing incisor 
teeth (necrosis/broken), growing bone (partial to full closure of epiphysis), and peripheral nerve 
(axonal degeneration) in rat only. Additional clinical observations of alopecia, weight loss, and muscle 
tremors/twitching, known class effects of SMO inhibitors, were observed in both species. These 
systemic toxicities were generally dose-dependent and observed at exposures ranging from 
approximately < 0.03 to 8-times the clinically relevant exposure based on nonclinical to clinical 
comparison of the observed unbound AUC at the recommended clinical dose of 100 mg once daily.
Complete reversibility of toxicities to the kidney (degeneration/necrosis), peripheral nerve (axonal 
degeneration), seminiferous tubule (testicular degeneration), and the clinical observations of muscle 
tremors/twitching was demonstrated following up to 16-week recovery, whereas partial recovery was 
demonstrated in the liver (necrosis/inflammation). The observation of alopecia, bone and teeth effects, 
and testicular hypospermatogenesis did not recover. In addition, QTc prolongation was identified in 
telemetered dogs at unbound Cmax exposures approximately 4-times the observed unbound Cmax
exposure at the recommended clinical dose of 100 mg once daily.
Glasdegib was not mutagenic in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay and was not 
clastogenic in the in vitro chromosome aberration assay in human lymphocytes. Glasdegib was not 
clastogenic or aneugenic in the rat micronucleus assay.
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with glasdegib.
In repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats, findings observed in the male reproductive tract included 
adverse testicular changes with glasdegib at doses  50 mg/kg/day, and consisted of minimal to severe 
hypospermatogenesis characterised by partial to complete loss of spermatogonia, spermatocytes and 
spermatids and testicular degeneration. Hypospermatogenesis did not recover whereas testicular 
degeneration did recover. The dose at which adverse testicular effects were observed in male rats was 
identified as 50 mg/kg/day with corresponding systemic exposures that were approximately 8-times 
those associated with the observed human exposure at the 100 mg once daily dose (based on unbound 
AUC in respective species). Safety margin for NOAEL (10 mg/kg/day) is 0.6, hence lower than 
clinically relevant.
In embryo-foetal developmental toxicity studies conducted in rats and rabbits, glasdegib was severely 
toxic to the conceptus as evidenced by complete resorption and/or abortion of foetuses, and 
teratogenic effects at lower dose levels. Teratogenic effects included craniofacial malformations, 
malformed limbs, paws/digits, trunk and tail, dilation of brain, malpositioned/malformed eyes, 
misshapen head, small tongue, absent palate, teeth and viscera, diaphragmatic hernia, oedema, 
persistent truncus arteriosus, heart defects, absent lung, absent trachea, rib and vertebral abnormalities, 
and malformed or absent structures in the appendicular skeleton (notably the long bones). Severe 
developmental malformations were observed at maternal systemic exposures lower than the relevant 
human exposure at the recommended dose of 100 mg once daily.

1. What Daurismo is and what it is used for
Daurismo is a cancer medicine containing the active substance glasdegib.
Daurismo is used with another cancer medicine, cytarabine, to treat adults newly diagnosed with a 
blood cancer called acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). 
How Daurismo works
In AML, cancer cells called stem cells constantly make new leukaemic cancer cells. Daurismo works 
by blocking a key process in these stem cells, called the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway. This reduces their 
ability to make new cancer cells. By blocking the Hh pathway, Daurismo can also make cancer cells 
more sensitive to a cancer medicine, cytarabine, used to treat AML. Combining Daurismo with the
medicine cytarabine may increase how long patients are likely to live by decreasing growth of the 
cancer and possibly by increasing cancer cell death. 
If you have any questions about how Daurismo works or why this medicine has been prescribed for 
you, ask your doctor.

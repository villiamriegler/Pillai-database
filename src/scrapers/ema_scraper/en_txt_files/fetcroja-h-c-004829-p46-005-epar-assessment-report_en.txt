2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that Study 1802R2135: A Single-arm, Open-label Study to Assess the Safety, 
Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Single and Multiple Doses of Cefiderocol in Hospitalized Paediatric 
Subjects 3 Months to <18 Years of Age with Suspected or Confirmed Aerobic Gram-negative Bacterial 
Infections is part of an agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan (EMEA-002133-PIP01-17-M02, Decision 
number EMA/PDCO/8222/2022).  
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The pharmaceutical formulation used in the study is the same as that commercially available.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
Study 1802R2135: A Single-arm, Open-label Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, and 
Pharmacokinetics of Single and Multiple Doses of Cefiderocol in Hospitalized Paediatric Subjects 3 
Months to <18 Years of Age with Suspected or Confirmed Aerobic Gram-negative Bacterial Infections 
The chemical structure of cefiderocol is similar to third- to fourth-generation cephalosporins 
ceftazidime and cefepime, but with the additional presence of a catechol group, resulting in the ability 
of cefiderocol to act as a siderophore and to be transported across the outer cell membrane of Gram-
negative bacteria. As a result, cefiderocol overcomes mechanisms of antibiotic resistance resulting 
from porin channel mutations or efflux-pump overproduction and demonstrates enhanced stability to 
hydrolysis by all known classes of BLAs, including serine-carbapenemases and metallo-beta-
lactamases. Cefiderocol is being developed to address the unmet medical need to treat carbapenem-
resistant infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae and non-
fermenters, such as P. aeruginosa, S. maltophilia, and A. baumannii. 
In 2019, Fetcroja received marketing authorisation in the EU for treatment of infections due to aerobic 
Gram-negative organisms in adults with limited treatment options. 
The paediatric development plan for Fetcroja as per the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan (EMEA-
002133-PIP01-17-M02, Decision number EMA/PDCO/8222/2022) comprises one quality measure, one

non-clinical juvenile toxicity study and two paediatric clinical studies (of which the first concerns this 
submission), alongside a modelling and simulation study and an extrapolation measure.  
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study 1802R2135: A Single-arm, Open-label Study to Assess the Safety, 
Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Single and Multiple Doses of 
Cefiderocol in Hospitalized Paediatric Subjects 3 Months to <18 Years of 
Age with Suspected or Confirmed Aerobic Gram-negative Bacterial 
Infections 
Description 
The primary purpose of the study was to provide safety data commensurate with the intended duration 
of treatment and obtain pharmacokinetic (PK) data to confirm dosing recommendations supporting the 
safe and effective use of cefiderocol in paediatric participants 3 months to <18 years of age with 
suspected or confirmed aerobic Gram-negative infections. The PK data for cefiderocol from this study 
will be used for the planned modelling and simulations, to estimate the probability of target attainment 
(PTA) and determine the efficacious dose (and dosing regimen) of cefiderocol for this age range. The 
clinical efficacy of cefiderocol is established from the PK/PD data package and as such this study was 
not designed to conclude on paediatric clinical efficacy.  
Methods 
Study participants 
Hospitalised paediatric participants 3 months to < 18 years of age (in 4 separate cohorts) with a 
suspected or confirmed aerobic Gram-negative pathogen, including but not limited to complicated 
urinary tract infections (cUTI), complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI), hospital-acquired 
pneumonia (HAP)/ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP), and sepsis or bloodstream infection (BSI), 
caused by a suspected or confirmed aerobic Gram-negative pathogen requiring systemic antibiotics for 
an expected 5 to 14 days. 
Premature babies were not restricted but must have had an adjusted or postnatal age of 3 months. 
As discussed and agreed with the EMA’s PDCO, Cohort 1 (adolescents) did not participate in the 
Multiple-dose Phase because adolescent PK data may be extrapolated from available and adequate 
adult PK data. 
Main inclusion criteria 
•  Hospitalised participants 3 months to < 18 years of age. 
•  Suspected or confirmed infection (including but not limited to cUTI, cIAI, HAP/VAP, sepsis, or 
BSI) that required hospitalisation for treatment with IV antibiotics.  
The suspected or confirmed aerobic Gram-negative infection type (including but not limited to cUTI, 
cIAI, HAP/VAP, and sepsis or BSI) was specified and recorded in the electronic case report form 
(eCRF):  
o  Complicated urinary tract infection was defined as a clinical syndrome characterised by 
pyuria and a microbial pathogen in the urine in the context of the following underlying 
features: recurrent urinary tract infections (2 or more in a 12-month period); obstructive 
uropathy; a functional or anatomical abnormality of the urinary tract, including anatomical

presence of a new or progressive infiltrate on a chest radiograph in a patient hospitalised for 
more than 48 hours or developing within 7 days after discharge from a hospital. Patients with 
HAP may or may not require intubation and mechanical ventilation.  
o  Ventilator-associated pneumonia was defined as an acute infection of the pulmonary 
parenchyma associated with clinical signs and symptoms, such as fever or hypothermia, chills, 
rigors, purulent respiratory secretions, and increased oxygen requirements. These signs and

If the participant’s infection was confirmed to be Gram-negative before starting treatment, 
monotherapy with cefiderocol was allowed.  
In special circumstances, treatment beyond 14 days was allowed. 
Single-dose Phase (Cohorts 1, 2, 3, and 4), normal renal function or mild renal impairment.  
The dose of cefiderocol was determined based on body weight; the maximum dose to be administered 
did not exceed 2000 mg. On Day 1 of the Single-dose Phase, participants were administered a single 
dose of cefiderocol infused IV over 3 hours at any time during the SOC treatment. After review of data 
from administration of cefiderocol in the Single-dose Phase, dosing recommendations for cefiderocol 
may have been adjusted by the sponsor prior to administration in the Multiple-dose Phase or for the 
next subsequent cohort based on ongoing assessment of PK data. All revised dosing recommendations 
were provided by the sponsor, discussed with the investigator, and documented.  
Multiple-dose Phase (Cohorts 2, 3, and 4).  
The dose of cefiderocol administered to each participant was based on both body weight and renal 
function, not exceeding 2000 mg of cefiderocol.

o  Clinical Cure: Resolution or substantial improvement of baseline signs and symptoms 
of cUTI, or return to pre-infection baseline if known, such that no antibiotic therapy 
was required for the treatment of the current infection. 
o  Clinical Failure: No apparent response to therapy; persistence or worsening of baseline 
signs and/or symptoms of cUTI; or reappearance of signs and/or symptoms of cUTI; 
development of new signs and/or symptoms of cUTI requiring antibiotic therapy other 
than, or in addition to, study treatment therapy; or death due to cUTI.

not be made.  
o  HAP/VAP/cIAI 
o  Clinical Cure: Resolution or substantial improvement of baseline signs and symptoms 
of pneumonia/cIAI. 
o  Clinical Failure: No apparent response to therapy; persistence or worsening of baseline 
signs and/or symptoms of pneumonia/cIAI; reappearance of signs and/or symptoms of 
pneumonia/cIAI; development of new signs and/or symptoms of pneumonia/cIAI 
requiring antibiotic therapy other than, or in addition to, study treatment therapy; 
progression of chest radiographic abnormalities; or death due to pneumonia/cIAI.

o 
Indeterminate: Lost to follow-up such that a determination of clinical cure/failure could 
not be made. 
Microbiological Response  
Determined at the Posttreatment Visit (7 [± 4] days) following EOT and EOS (if available) for each 
baseline Gram-negative pathogen. Emergent (ie, non-baseline) pathogens were considered separately, 
and did not affect the per-participant microbiological outcome.  
o  Complicated Urinary Tract Infection  
o  Eradication: A urine culture showed the baseline Gram-negative uropathogen found at 
entry at ≥ 105 colony forming units (CFU)/mL was reduced to < 103 CFU/mL.  
o  Persistence: A urine culture showed that the baseline Gram-negative uropathogen 
found at entry at ≥ 105 CFU/mL remained at ≥ 103 CFU/mL.  
o 
Indeterminate: No urine culture obtained or additional antibiotic therapy for the 
treatment of the current infection including missed sampling. 
o  HAP/VAP/cIAI and BSI/Sepsis 
o  Eradication: Absence of the baseline Gram-negative pathogen from an appropriate 
clinical specimen. If it was not possible to obtain an appropriate clinical culture and the 
participant had a successful clinical outcome, the response was presumed to be 
eradication.  
o  Persistence: Continued presence of the baseline Gram-negative pathogen from an 
appropriate clinical specimen.  
o 
Indeterminate: No culture obtained from an appropriate clinical specimen or additional 
antibiotic therapy for the treatment of the current infection including missed sampling.  
Sample size 
This primary purpose of this study was to assess the PK and safety of cefiderocol in paediatric 
participants 3 months to < 18 years of age with suspected or confirmed aerobic Gram-negative 
infections. Therefore, the sample size calculation did not consider efficacy endpoints.  
Overall, at least 54 evaluable paediatric participants were planned to be enrolled in the study across all 
4 cohorts.

For Enterobacter cloacae complex, 1 isolate was resistant to cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and 
ciprofloxacin. Thirteen E. coli isolates were sensitive to most antibiotics tested but resistant to 
ceftriaxone (2, 15.4%), ciprofloxacin (3, 23.1%), and piperacillin/tazobactam (1, 7.7%). All Klebsiella 
pneumoniae (2) and Salmonella (1) isolates were susceptible to all antibiotics tested. The 
interpretation of susceptibility results using EUCAST guidelines generally aligned with CLSI for majority 
of the antibiotics. 
Assessor's comment: 
Baseline demographics for the ITT and MITT Populations were similar to those of the Safety 
Population, with the exception of eGFR grading groupings. In the MITT Population, the eGFR 
distribution was more skewed towards severe moderate to severe renal impairment, with 11.1% 
with ≥ 120 mL/min/1.73m2, 50.0% with 90 to ≤ 120 mL/min/1.73m2, and 38.9% with 60 to < 90 
mL/min/1.73m2. 
In the Single-dose Phase, infection type at baseline was primarily cIAI (41.7%), cUTI (20.8%), BSI 
(12.5%), and other infection type (16.7%). In the Multiple-dose Phase, infection type at baseline 
was primarily cIAI (48.3%) and cUTI (34.5%). This was similar between Safety and ITT Populations. 
For the MITT Population of the Multiple-dose Phase, infection types at baseline were cUTI (38.9%), 
cIAI (38.9%), HAP/VAP (11.1%), BSI (5.6%), and sepsis (5.6%).  
Number analysed 
In the Multiple-dose Phase, all 29 participants were included in the ITT and Safety Populations. The 
MITT Population comprised 18 (62.1%) of these 29 participants. Eleven (37.9%) participants were 
excluded from the MITT population who did not have a Gram-negative pathogen at baseline (5 
[41.7%] participants in Cohort 2; 3 [27.3%] in Cohort 3; and 3 [50.0%] in Cohort 4). The PKC and the 
PKCS Populations were identical, and each included 28 (96.6%) of the 29 enrolled participants.

Safety results 
Adverse events were classified by System Organ Class and preferred term using the Medical Dictionary 
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Version 23.0. 
In the Safety Population of the Multiple-dose Phase, the median extent of exposure was 8.0 days 
(range: 2 to 15 days); 86.2% of participants received 5 to 14 days of treatment. The median total 
number of doses received was 24.0 (range: 6 to 42 doses). The longest exposure to cefiderocol was in 
Cohort 3 (2 to < 6 years) at a median of 27.0 doses over 9.0 days.  
Adverse events 
In the Single-dose Phase, a total of 5 (20.8%) participants experienced 12 TEAEs, including 1 
participant (1 event) in Cohort 2, 3 participants (7 events) in Cohort 3, and 1 participant (4 events) in 
Cohort 4. No SAEs were reported. 
In the Multiple-dose Phase, a total of 7 (24.1%) participants experienced 10 TEAEs, including 2 
participants (2 events) in Cohort 2, 1 participant (1 event) in Cohort 3, and 4 participants (7 events) in 
Cohort 4.

One participant in Cohort 4 (3 months to <2 years) of the Multiple-dose Phase experienced the SAEs of 
urinary tract infection and Staphylococcal bacteraemia.  
Assessor's comment: 
The safety database provided by this study is small. However, the TEAEs reported are consistent 
with the underlying condition, comorbidities and known safety profile of cefiderocol as established in 
adults. No new safety concerns are identified. 
The narrative provided for the participant with cUTI (administered cefiderocol + 
piperacillin/tazobactam as SOC) who reported multiple SAEs during the multiple-dose phase 
describe SAEs of UTI (urinalysis positive, urine culture negative) and Staphylococcal bacteraemia 
reported days 34-37 and days 38-44, respectively.  
Urine culture from Screening grew Klebsiella pneumoniae. Study drug treatment was concluded day 
6. The participant was recorded as Clinical Cure at both EOT and EOS assessment timepoints.  
There was a complex medical background (hydronephrosis, motor dysfunction, Noonan syndrome, 
thrombocytosis, recurrent urinary tract infection, vesicoureteric reflux), concurrent active 
pneumonia and concomitant medications of cefdinir and nitrofurantoin. Both SAEs were moderate in 
severity, resolved by the end of the study and considered by the investigator to be unrelated to 
study drug. This is agreed considering the reported events do not seem to represent a failure of 
study treatment/ lack of efficacy.

Clinical laboratory tests 
No clinically significant changes in clinical laboratory test values were identified in this study, with the 
exception of the liver events described below. 
One participant in Cohort 4 of the Multiple-dose Phase (cefiderocol + SOC) experienced liver events 
that were not considered to be related to cefiderocol by the investigator. The participant was a 5.0-
month-old Asian male with a history of choledochal cyst. At baseline (Day -1), prior to cefiderocol 
administration, ALT was 80 U/L (normal range: 5 to 33 U/L); ALP was 243 U/L (normal range: 134 to 
518 U/L); AST was 56 U/L (normal range: 20 to 67 U/L); and bilirubin was 0.35 mg/dL (range: 0.05 to 
0.68 mg/dL) (Listing 16.2.8.1.8.2). On Day 3, ALP was 526 U/L. On Day 34, ALT was 233 U/L and AST

was 50 U/L. At EOS, ALT was 233 U/L with no abnormal symptoms. The participant was referred to a 
follow-up hepatologist, and at the last visit a further decline in AST (51 U/L) and ALT (50 U/L) levels 
was reported. 
Assessor's comment: 
The narrative provided for the participant who experienced significant liver events during the 
multiple-dose phase of the study indicates a complex medical history (including and not limited to 
anomalous pulmonary venous connection, bacterial urinary tract infection, choledochal cyst, 
hydronephrosis, patent ductus arteriosus, pneumonia, vesicoureteric reflux) and confounding 
concomitant medicants including ertapenem and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. The adverse event 
of elevated ALT occurred on day 34, whereas study drug treatment had concluded on day 3. The 
investigator considered the AE of increased ALT as mild and not related to study drug. There are no 
factors identified from the narrative to suggest a causative relationship to cefiderocol.  
Other 
No abnormal findings in vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and temperature) or 
physical examinations were observed in the Single-dose or Multiple-dose Phases. 
PK results 
Plasma cefiderocol concentrations from the single-dose phase and multiple-dose phase, respectively, 
are summarised below. Pharmacokinetic parameters including maximum observed plasma 
concentration (Cmax), area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), and half-life (t1/2) will be 
estimated in the planned population PK analysis and reported separately. 
Single-dose Phase 
All 24 (100%) enrolled participants in the Single-dose Phase were included in the PKC and PKCS 
Populations (Table 11-1). Plasma cefiderocol concentrations are summarised in Table 11-10. Mean 
plasma concentration-time profiles for the PKCS Population are shown in Figure 11-1 on linear and 
semi-logarithmic scales. 
The plasma cefiderocol concentration profiles after the single dose were similar among the 4 cohorts. 
The geometric mean concentrations at 3 hours after the start of infusion (the end of infusion) and 8 
hours after the start of infusion were 72.7 to 97.1 and 7.86 to 10.8 μg/mL, respectively, in the 4 
cohorts.

Multiple-dose Phase 
In the Multiple-dose Phase, the PKC and the PKCS Populations included 28 (100%) participants (Table 
11-1). Plasma cefiderocol concentrations are summarised in Table 11-11. Mean plasma concentration-
time profiles for the PKCS Population are shown in Figure 11-2 on linear and semi-logarithmic scales.

The plasma cefiderocol concentration profiles after the multiple doses were similar among the 4 
cohorts. The geometric mean concentrations at 3 hours after the start of infusion (the end of infusion) 
and 8 hours after the start of infusion (before the next infusion) were 88.8 to 106 and 9.64 to 18.1 
μg/mL, respectively, in the 4 cohorts.

Assessor's comment: 
The cefiderocol pharmacokinetics has been studied across the age range of 3 months to 18 years. 
The summarised plasma concentrations display fairly similar concentrations across the 4 age 
cohorts. It is noted that in the multiple-dosing phase cohort 2 (6 to <12 years) seem to have 
slightly lower concentrations than cohort 3 and 4.  
The primary PK endpoints, Cmax, AUC, and t1/2, will be reported separately in a population PK 
analysis report. This is accepted. However, a full report is expected at the application for a paediatric 
indication, including reporting of the actual dosing levels and exposure comparison with the adult 
reference population. 
Efficacy results 
Clinical outcome 
All participants in the ITT and MITT Populations were treated with cefiderocol + SOC (i.e. no participant 
received cefiderocol alone).  
At EOT, Posttreatment, and EOS, respectively, clinical cure was achieved by 29 (100%), 25 (86.2%), 
and 27 (93.1%) participants in the ITT Population and 18 (100%), 16 (88.9%), and 18 (100%) of the 
MITT Population.  
All participants with infections due to Enterobacter cloacae complex (1 participant), K. pneumoniae (2 
participants), N. meningitidis (1 participant), and Salmonella (1 participant) at baseline achieved 
clinical cure at EOT, Posttreatment, and EOS. For the 13 participants with E. coli at baseline, clinical 
cure was achieved by all 13 (100%) participants at EOT, 11 participants (84.6%) Posttreatment (with 
2 participants indeterminate or missing), and all 13 participants (100%) at EOS. 
Microbiological outcome 
At EOT, Posttreatment, and EOS, respectively, eradication was achieved by 12 (66.7%), 13 (72.2%), 
and 14 (77.8%) of the MITT Population. All participants with infections due to K. pneumoniae, N. 
meningitidis, and Salmonella at baseline achieved eradication at EOT and Posttreatment. For 
participants with E. coli at baseline, eradication was achieved by 69.2% at EOT and 61.5% 
Posttreatment. For the participant with Enterobacter cloacae complex at baseline, the outcome was 
indeterminate at EOT and eradication at Posttreatment. 
Assessor's comment: 
This small safety and PK study was not designed to conclude on clinical efficacy in the paediatric 
population, which is derived from the PK/PD data package rather than from clinical efficacy 
outcomes. As such, the data are purely descriptive. Furthermore, all patients received other 
concomitant antibiotics according to local standard of care, making it impossible to isolate the 
clinical effect of cefiderocol. Rates of clinical and microbiological cure seen in this study were 
comparable with those seen in the pivotal/ registration study for cefiderocol.  
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Study 1802R2135 was a PK and safety study and as such was not designed to permit efficacy analyses 
beyond summary statistics. Rates of clinical and microbiological cure seen in this study were 
comparable with those seen in the pivotal/ registration study for cefiderocol, but it should be noted

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

that all participants received concomitant antibiotics according to local standard of care, this the effect 
of cefiderocol cannot be isolated. 
The required number of patients for PK characterisation have been included in all age groups. The 
summarised cefiderocol plasma concentration data indicate that the plasma concentrations are in 
general similar across age groups and similar to the concentrations in adults with normal or mild renal 
function (CREDIBLE-CR study). The primary PK endpoints, Cmax, AUC, and t1/2, have not been reported. 
Thus, a full report is expected at the application for a paediatric indication. 
The Safety Population was small, comprising just 24 patients enrolled to the single-dose phase and 29 
patients enrolled to the multiple-dose phase. Cefiderocol was generally well-tolerated when 
administered alone and in combination with SOC to treat a suspected or confirmed aerobic Gram-
negative bacterial infection in hospitalised paediatric participants 3 months to < 18 years of age, with 
reported adverse events consistent with the known safety profile in adults, and with the underlying 
condition and comorbidities. No new safety concerns are identified. However, the study was not large 
enough to detect rare adverse events.  
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
Study 1802R2135, a safety and PK study, forms part of an agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan (EMEA-
002133-PIP01-17-M02, Decision number EMA/PDCO/8222/2022) for cefiderocol and was conducted to 
support extension of the authorised indication to the paediatric population. 
Not all measures as described in the agreed PIP (EMEA-002133-PIP01-17-M02, Decision number 
EMA/PDCO/8222/2022) are complete. The agreed PIP completion date is May 2025.  
The study was not designed to conclude on clinical efficacy. Safety data were limited but consistent 
with the known safety profile of cefiderocol in adults, and with the underlying condition and 
comorbidities. The summarised plasma concentrations indicate in general similar concentrations across 
all age groups.  
An application to extend the authorised adult indication to the paediatric population is expected to be 
submitted following completion of the necessary modelling and extrapolation studies, as specified in 
the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan (EMEA-002133-PIP01-17-M02, Decision number 
EMA/PDCO/8222/2022).  
There are no issues arising from assessment of this completed study that otherwise require regulatory 
action at this time. 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

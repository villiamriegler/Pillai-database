SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION  
1.1.  About the product and Problem statement 
The  active  substance  of  Lyrica,  pregabalin,  is  a  gamma-aminobutyric  acid  analogue  ((S)-3-
(aminomethyl)-5-methylhexanoic  acid).  Pregabalin  binds  to  an  auxiliary  subunit  (α2-δ  protein)  of 
voltage-gated calcium channels in the central nervous system, potently displacing [3H]-gabapentin. 
With this type II variation, the MAH applied for a new indication in the treatment of fibromyalgia in 
adults. Subsequently, the MAH changed the claimed indication to treatment of fibromyalgia in adults 
experiencing moderate to severe pain.   
The  clinical  pharmacology  of  oral  pregabalin  was  investigated  in  21  phase  I  studies  included  in  the 
original application for pregabalin capsules. No new clinical pharmacology studies were carried out to 
support this application for treatment of fibromyalgia. 
Pregabalin  is  currently  registered  for  the  treatment  of  1)  peripheral  and  central  neuropathic  pain  in 
adults; 2) as adjunctive therapy in adults with partial seizures with or without secondary generalisation 
and 3) treatment of generalised anxiety disorder in adults.  
1.2  Development programme and scientific advice 
Fibromyalgia is a complex disorder that is characterized by pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and impaired 
cognitive and physical function. The CHMP gave scientific advice for Lyrica in the proposed indication 
of fibromyalgia in 2005. The CHMP agreed to the diagnostic criteria of fibromyalgia according to the 
criteria of the American College of Rheumatology. However, the CHMP considered fibromyalgia an 
ill  defined  and  extremely  heterogeneous  condition  without  universal  consensus  on  its  characteristic 
and  diagnostic  features  and  no  objective  investigations  to  aid  diagnosis.  It  was  noted  that  there  are 
geographical  differences  in  the  way  in  which  fibromyalgia  is  perceived,  diagnosed  and  managed, 
making studies in the EU population recommendable in view of an approval for the European market. 
The endpoints for this complex disorder were also discussed and the CHMP concluded at the time that 
pain  alone  was  insufficient  and  should  be  complemented  by  an  effect  on  aspects  of  fibromyalgia 
beyond pain.  
The  CHMP  adopted  a  negative  opinion  on  the  sought  indication  on  23  April  2009.  The  MAH 
requested a re-examination of the CHMP opinion on 6 May 2009 and submitted the grounds for re-
examination on 22 June 2009.  
During the re-examination procedure, the CHMP sought experts’ opinion via the Scientific Advisory 
Group (SAG) for Clinical Neuroscience (CNS) to consolidate its evaluation.  
The clinical development programme for the applied indication consisted of 5 double-blind, placebo-
controlled  studies  (1008-105,  A0081056,  A0081077,  A0081100  and  A0081059)  and  4  open-label 
extension studies (A0081057, A0081078, A0081101 and 1008-033/1008-197). In total 2068 patients 
with  fibromyalgia  were  randomised  and  treated  in  these  trials  (see  tables  1  and  2).  The  number  of 
patients was sufficient to assess the efficacy and safety of pregabalin in patients with fibromyalgia.

1.3.  Clinical aspects 
1.3.1 Pharmacokinetics 
No changes to the pharmacokinetic or interaction data within the product information were proposed 
with this submission. It is expected that the pharmacokinetics are similar for fibromyalgia patients as 
for patients with neuropathic pain, epilepsy or generalised anxiety disorder. Therefore, no additional 
pharmacokinetic studies were considered necessary. 
1.3.2 Clinical efficacy 
Study design 
Studies 105, 1056, 1077 and 1100 were double blind studies that consisted of a baseline phase, a dose 
escalation phase, and a fixed dose phase (Table 3). During the baseline phase subjects were screened 
for eligibility to enter the double-blind phase of the study.

The run in phase was single blind. The subsequent double-blind treatment phase included an initial 1- 
or 2-week dose escalation period followed by a 7-week (Study 105) or 12-week (Studies 1056, 1077, 
1100)  fixed-dose  period.  Patients  who  completed  the  double-blind  phase  could  elect  to  continue  in 
open-label extension studies or discontinue treatment; those who did not continue in open-label were 
seen  for  a  follow-up  visit  1  week  later.  In  trial  1077  and  1100  patients  who  demonstrated  a  high 
response  (≥30%  decrease  on  the  pain  visual  analogue  scale  (VAS))  to  placebo  during  the  baseline 
phase were not randomised at the end of that phase. Exclusion of these patients in principle results in a 
selected study population. As the patient population of study 1077/100 differs from the other studies, 
the pooling of the results over all studies is questionable. 
Study 1059  was  designed  as  a  maintenance  of  treatment  effect  study,  in  which  responders  to  open-
label  treatment  at  6 weeks  were  randomized  in  a  double-blind  fashion  to  continue  pregabalin  or  to 
receive placebo treatment for 6 months. This study is further discussed later in this report. 
Patient population 
The main inclusion criteria were:  
-  At  screening  (Visit  1),  subjects  met  the  American  College  of  Rheumatology  (ACR)  criteria  for 
fibromyalgia (i.e., widespread pain present for at least 3 months and pain in at least 11 of 18 specific 
tender point sites). 
- At screening (Visit 1) and randomization (Visit 2), subjects had a score of ≥40 mm on the Pain VAS. 
-  At  randomization  (Visit  2),  subjects  had  at  least  4  pain  diaries  completed  satisfactorily  within  the 
previous 7 days with an average pain score ≥4. 
The main exclusion criteria were: 
-  Subjects  with  ≥30%  decrease  on  the  VAS  at  randomization  (Visit  2)  as  compared  with  screening 
(Visit 1).  (For study 1077 and 1100 only). 
- Subjects with severe pain due to other conditions [e.g., diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) or post 
herpetic  neuralgia  (PHN)]  that  may  have  confounded  assessment  or  self-evaluation  of  the  pain 
associated with fibromyalgia. 
-  Subjects  with  any  widespread  inflammatory  musculoskeletal  disorders,  widespread  rheumatic 
diseases other than fibromyalgia, active infections, or untreated endocrine disorders. 
-  Subjects  with  severe  depression  that  in  the  judgment  of  the  investigator  made  the  subject 
inappropriate for entry into this trial. 
5 of 24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
-  Subjects  using  prohibited  pain/sleep  medications  (including  antidepressants,  sedatives,  hypnotics, 
NSAIDs, opiates, muscle relaxants) in the absence of appropriate washout periods 
Rescue medication 
Aspirin and Acetaminophen were allowed as rescue medication. 
Aspirin: up to 1 aspirin tablet (≤ 325 mg) daily for myocardial infarction and stroke prophylaxis 
Acetaminophen (i.e paracetamol): up to 4 g/day as needed for pain relief 
Baseline characteristics 
The patient population of the efficacy trials is summarised in table 4. As expected, many more females 
were included in the studies compared to male patients.The age group of 65 years and older was small 
(<10%). Baseline characteristics were equally distributed over the different study arms in each study. 
Of  note,  only  280  patients  from  the  European  Union  (all  in  study  1100)  were  randomised  and  took 
study medication.

Endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint in each of the 8-14 week studies was the change from baseline in mean 
pain score The Patient Global Impression of Change and change from baseline in the total score on the 
Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) were co-primary endpoints in studies 1056 and 1077.  The 
Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) was co-primary endpoint in study 1100.  
The two key secondary endpoints included change from baseline in the total score on the Fibromyalgia 
Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) and improvement in sleep as assessed with the Medical Outcomes Study 
(MOS)  Sleep  Scale  Sleep  Disturbance  subscale.  Other  secondary  endpoints  included  assessments  of 
sleep, fatigue, mood disturbance, additional assessments of pain, health status, and functioning.  
Pain 
(cid:131) 
Pain was assessed with a daily pain diary which uses an 11 point numeric rating scale from 0 (no pain) 
to 10 (worst possible pain). In Study 1059, pain was assessed at each visit with the self-administered 
Pain Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).  
Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)  
(cid:131) 
Global  assessment  was  conducted  with  the  Patient  Global  Impression  of  Change  (PGIC),  a  patient-
rated instrument that measures change in patient’s overall status on a scale ranging from 1 (very much 
improved) to 7 (very much worse). The PGIC is a measure of the overall perception of the advantages 
and disadvantages of the treatment. The PGIC was scored by patients at study termination. 
Function – Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) 
(cid:131) 
The  Fibromyalgia  Impact  Questionnaire  (FIQ)  is  a  20  item  patient-reported  outcome  instrument 
designed to assess health status, progress, and outcomes. It contains 10 subscales, which are combined 
to yield a total score.  
Sleep 
(cid:131) 
The MOS-SS is a self reporting survey which yields a subscale score for sleep disturbance as well as 6 
other parameters and a 9-item overall Sleep Problems Index.  Because sleep disturbance is considered 
a key aspect of the constellation of fibromyalgia symptoms, the MOS-SS Sleep Disturbance subscale 
is the sleep parameter of prominence in this application. 
Statistics 
All  primary  and  secondary  analyses  were  performed  using  data  from  the  full  analysis  set  (FAS) 
population,  defined  as  all  randomized  patients  who  took  at  least  1  dose  of  study  medication.  The 
intention  to  treat  (ITT)  and  FAS  were  considered  equivalent  by  the  MAH.  This  was  agreed  by  the 
CHMP given the limited loss of patients in the randomized population and the FAS population. 
All  statistical  testing  was  2-sided  and  compared  each  treatment  arm  of  pregabalin  to  placebo.  The 
primary  analysis  compared  the  endpoint  mean  pain  score  between  the  treatment  groups  using  an 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment and centre in the model and the baseline mean pain 
score as covariate in the FAS population. For the comparison of the dose arms Hochberg’s approach 
was  used  to  protect  the  Type  I  error  rate  at  the  0.05  level.  Because  the  second  objective  required  2 
measures to be significant, the PGIC was tested at the α = 0.05 for each dose, without adjustment for 
multiple comparisons to placebo. Interpretation focused on those doses that demonstrated a significant 
efficacy in endpoint mean pain. Secondary measures were assessed in the following order: firstly, the 
Sleep  Disturbance  domain  from  the  MOS-Sleep  Scale,  then  the  FIQ  total  score,  and  then  all  other 
secondary endpoints. All supplemental analyses based on the pain diary, and all secondary analyses, 
were tested at the α = 0.05 for each dose, without adjustment for multiple comparisons to placebo. 
Endpoint analysis, including the primary analysis, used the last observation carried forward (LOCF) 
imputation. Additional analyses, including mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) and analysis of 
duration  adjusted  average  change  (DAAC)  were  conducted  to  assess  the  robustness  of  the  primary 
analysis and potential impact of missing data.

Results for individual short-term efficacy studies 
(cid:131) 
Primary endpoint - Pain score: 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean pain scores for pregabalin treatment compared with those 
for  placebo  treatment  in  the  FAS  population.  Mean  Pain  Scores  were  calculated  from  the  last 
7 available  scores  while  on  study  medication,  up  to  and  including  day  after  last  dose.  Results  are 
summarised in table 5.

In study 1100, the mean baseline pain score was 6.65 (SD 1.36) and the mean difference in pain scores 
with  placebo  for  the  450mg  pregabalin  dose  is  -0.54.  This  is  the  only  dose  statistically  significant 
different from placebo in this study. For US studies 1056 and 1077, the results showed a statistically 
significant improvement of pain scores and are consistent within the three doses. However, the mean 
difference  in  pain  scores  with  placebo  was  1  point  or  less  on  an  11-point  pain-scale,  which  is 
considered a small magnitude of effect.

When the >50% responder rate is considered for each individual studies, it was higher for pregabalin 
300 and 450 mg/day than for placebo treatment. Although this difference was statistically significant 
in 2 studies out of 3, the responder rates differ only of about 8-12% (study 1100 and 1077), as shown 
in table 6.

PGIC results were consistent. However, the placebo effect is important in all studies and the difference 
in  responder  rates  between  placebo  and  pregabalin  treatment  effect  are  small,  which  questions  the 
clinical relevance of the  effect: in study 1056 a total of 56.2 % of the patients in the placebo group 
improved whereas 68.6 % to 72.3% of the patients in the pregabalin treated group improved. In study 
1077 a total of 47.6 % of the patients in the placebo group improved whereas 66.1 % to 77.8% of the 
10 of 24 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
   
  
  
 
 
   
 
    
   
 
   
 
    
   
 
patients in the pregabalin treated group improved. In study 1100 a total of 56.2 % of the patients in the 
placebo  group  improved  whereas  66.7  %  to  73.3%  of  the  patients  in  the  pregabalin  treated  group 
improved. Taking into account only the patients who improved “much” or “very much”, the treatment 
effect remains small.

Results were inconsistent across trials and doses, and were not statistically significant in study 1056. 
Inconsistency across doses suggests a lack of a dose-response relationship which is not supportive of a 
treatment  effect.  Again,  the  magnitude  of  the  placebo  effect  in  all  studies  and  the  difference  in 
responder  rates  between  placebo  and  treatment  groups  make  the  numerical  results  of  questionable 
clinical relevance.

Results on pain 
The  proportion  of  50%  pain  responders  when  pooling  data  is  shown  in  table  11.  A  statistically 
significant difference in the proportion of 50% responders was demonstrated in each treatment group.  
When pooling data, results for pain show that the 50% responder rates difference between pregabalin 
all  dose  treatment  groups and  placebo  is  of  8.6%.  Whether  this  difference  is  clinically  significant  is 
questionable.

Results on FIQ 
Results on the FIQ in individual short-term studies were inconsistent and of little magnitude compared 
to placebo. In the pooled analysis, at least for the 450 mg/day dose, the results in the overall FIQ score 
and even the results for the different subscales were more or less consistent (table 12).  
Using the minimal clinical important criteria difference (MCID) definition of 8.05 points, each of the 
pregabalin treatment groups achieved the minimal clinically important difference, with mean changes 
from  baseline  of  -11.95,  -14.18,  and  -12.46  for  the  300,  450,  and  600  mg/day  pregabalin  groups,

respectively.  However,  the  difference  in  the  placebo  group  (-9.93)  is  also  well  above  the  MCID. 
Hence  as  the  differences  versus  placebo  are  2.02,  4.25,  and  2.53  points  for  PGB300,  PG450  and 
PG600 respectively, the clinical significance of the results on FIQ is questionable.

Results on SF-36 Vitality score and sleep quality 
Assuming that the SF-36 Vitality score is indicative for fatigue and functional outcome, and assuming 
that a 10 point reduction is clinically important, SF-36- responder rates of 39%, 46%, 45% and 43% 
for placebo, PGB300, PGB450 and PGB600 respectively hardly point at relevant differences despite 
statistical significance. 
Concerning the effect on sleep, the results were consistent. All three pregabalin treatment groups (300, 
450, and 600 mg/day) showed a statistically significant improvement for each of these measures, both 
in  the  pooled  data,  with  p-values  <0.0001,  and  in  each  individual  study.  However,  somnolence  is  a 
well-known adverse event of pregabalin and it is unclear as to how this might have impacted on the 
results.

Sub-analysis  looking  at  the  independence  between  pain  response  and  response  in  multiple 
symptom domain  
The CHMP was concerned that the effect on multiple symptoms domain could be driven by the effect 
on pain, especially as the functional improvement remains doubtful in clinical terms. To address this 
concern,  the  MAH  presented  the  results  obtained  from  an  analysis  with  Spearman’s  correlation 
coefficients.  It  was  shown  that  there  is  a  moderate  correlation  (0.4≤  correlation  coefficient  <0.7) 
between  PGIC  and  changes  in  mean  pain  score,  and  between  PGIC  and  changes  in  FIQ  total  score. 
PGIC correlations with changes in MOS-Sleep Disturbance Subscale were weak (<0.4). In addition, a 
Venn diagram analysis evaluating the contributions of pain and sleep improvements to PGIC response 
(and performed with the SF-36 Vitality subscale being evaluated in the place of FIQ total score) was 
also  presented.  The  CHMP  acknowledged  that  altogether,  the  data  presented  suggest  that  patient 
global assessment might be impacted by more than just reduction in pain. 
Results in the EU population 
The  number  of  subjects  from  European  Union  and  the  extrapolation  of  results  to  the  European 
population were of concern to the CHMP, especially as the perception of fibromyalgia, diagnosis and 
medical management of this condition might differ across regions.  
The  MAH  analysed  the  results  for  the  European  population  and  concluded  that  European  patients 
demonstrated  statistically  significant  and  clinically  meaningful  responses  to  pregabalin  treatment 
across  multiple  symptom  domains  of  fibromyalgia,  including  PGIC  (figure  1),  composite  response 
(table 13), function (table 14) and sleep disturbance (table 15).

Table 15. Endpoint Mean MOS-SS Sleep Disturbance Score by Dose – European Patients 
The CHMP observed that results on pain of study 1100, with the EU subpopulation were inconsistent 
with  those  of  the  US  studies,  and  especially  when  compared  to  study  1077  having  a  selected 
population  as  well  (Table  5).  In  study  1100,  the  size  effect  is  considered  to  be  very  small  on  the 
European  population.  The  mean  baseline  pain  score  was  6.65  (SD  1.36)  and  the  mean  difference  in 
pain scores with placebo for the 450 mg pregabalin dose is -0.54, and this is the only dose statistically 
significant different from placebo in this study. It is even lower when the EU population is analysed 
separately (-0.49). This represents half of the result obtained in study 1077 for the same dose (-0.98). 
When the 30% and 50% responder analyses are concerned (see table 6), the differences between the 2 
studies  are  respectively  of  11.4%  (49.5%  in  study  1077  and  33.1%  in  study  1100,  with  statistical 
significance of the 450 mg/day vs placebo in both studies) and 9.2% (27.4% in study 1077 and 18.2% 
in study 1100, with statistical significance of the 450mg/day vs placebo in both studies). Of note, the 
50%  responder  rate  difference  between  the  450mg/day  dose  and  placebo  is  9%  in  study  1100 
(although statistically significant). The clinical relevance of such a difference is therefore doubtful. 
As  regards  PGIC,  the  results  show  better  consistency  between  the  2  studies  (see  table  7).  For  the  
450 mg dose, the difference of percentage of patients with improvement is 4.5%. However, when the 
differences between PGB 450 mg and placebo are concerned, the difference in study 1077 is of 30.2% 
and 17.7% in study 1100 (the difference is statistically significant in both studies). It is acknowledged 
15 of 24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that  the  placebo  effect  is  important  in  the  “European  study”  as  compared  to  study  1077  (56.2%  vs. 
47.6%). 
As far as functional outcome is concerned, the same remarks as for PGIC can be drawn (see table 9).  
The  MAH  also  provided  a  pooled  analysis  of  study  results  by  region,  which  showed  similarity  of 
effect for multiple domains of fibromyalgia. However, the CHMP noted the substantial difference in size 
effect  between  the  US  and  the  European  population.  The  impact  of  variability  in  the  magnitude  of 
effect  was  further  assessed  by  the  MAH  by  comparing  individual  study  results  (Figure  2).  For 
instance, endpoint mean pain scores (placebo-corrected) appear similar for pregabalin 450 mg/day in 
the  United  States  (Study  1056;  -0.47)  and  Europe  (-0.50).  However,  the  European  results  were  not 
statistically significant and of limited effect size (-0.50).  
Figure 2. Improvement in Pain by Dose and Study, and in European Patients 
Overall, the CHMP concluded that for the EU population, the differences in mean pain score and FIQ, 
and  to  a  lesser  extent  in  PGIC  between  placebo  and  pregabalin  are  not  considered  consistently 
clinically meaningful as regards short term efficacy of Lyrica in the claimed indication in Europe. 
Consulted  by  the  CHMP,  the  SAG  CNS  agreed  that  the  results  from  the  US  studies  could  not  be 
extrapolated to the EU population taking into account the differences in results. Patients in the studies 
were  not  phenotypically  well  defined  and  therefore  overlap  with  other  syndromes  and  symptoms 
cannot be excluded. The SAG was not convinced that the MAH has set up the studies to ensure similar 
balance of patients in different geographic regions. The different result in the EU population cannot be 
overlooked and further studies might be required in a population that is ensured to be phenotypically 
equivalent. 
Results on maintenance of treatment effect – Study 1059 
Study 1059  was  designed  as  a  maintenance  of  treatment  effect  study,  in  which  responders  to  open-
label  treatment  at  6 weeks  were  randomized  in  a  double-blind  fashion  to  continue  pregabalin  or  to 
receive placebo treatment for 6 months. All patients enrolled in Study 1059 were given pregabalin at 
their optimized dose (optimized during the first 3 weeks of open-label treatment) through the end of a 
6-week open-label treatment phase. For randomization, patients were required to meet the definition of 
a responder (≥50% reduction in pain from baseline as assessed on VAS and a PGIC rating of “much 
improved”  or  “very  much  improved”  during  Weeks 4  or  5  and  6).  Eligible  patients  were  then 
16 of 24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
randomly assigned to continue treatment with pregabalin at their optimized dose or to receive placebo.  
Patients  randomized  to  placebo  treatment  were  tapered  off  pregabalin  in  a  blinded  manner  over  the 
first  week  of  double-blind  treatment.  Double-blind  treatment  continued  up  to  6 months  or  until 
patients met the study exit criteria which defined the loss of therapeutic response (LTR). 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the time to loss of therapeutic response, which was based on the 
Pain  VAS  or  investigator  judgment.  The  secondary  objectives  were:  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of 
pregabalin  compared  with  placebo  treatment  to  relieve  pain  and  to  improve  global  assessment, 
functional status, sleep, and fatigue associated with fibromyalgia. Results for the primary endpoint are 
illustrated in table 15 and figure 3. 
Table 16: Summary of Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to loss of therapeutic response for VAS pain.  
Figure 3: Kaplan-Meier plot of time (days) to loss of therapeutic response. 
During  the  6-month  double-blind  maintenance  phase,  time  to  loss  of  therapeutic  response  was 
significantly  longer  for  subjects  treated  with  pregabalin  compared  with  those  treated  with  placebo 
(p<0.0001).  Based  on  Kaplan-Meier  estimates  of  time-to-event,  25%  of  placebo-treated  subjects 
recorded loss of therapeutic response at day 7. On day 34, 25% of pregabalin treated subjects reported 
loss of efficacy. A total of 174/287 (61%) placebo-treated patients lost therapeutic response compared 
with 90/279 (32%) of pregabalin-treated patients over the 6 months.  
The  CHMP  observed  that  the  rapid  fall  of  proportion  of  the  subjects  without  LTR  under  pregabalin 
does not substantiate the maintenance of effect despite the fact that for placebo this fall was even more 
rapid. After this initial drop of the Kaplan-Meier curves, there is almost no additional failure either in 
the placebo or in the pregabalin group. This and the lack of further divergence of the Kaplan-Meier 
curves,  i.e.  worsening  under  placebo,  are  implausible.  The  placebo  group  was  expected  to  further 
deteriorate.  However,  the  placebo  effect  appears  to  be  considerable  in  this  particular  population. 
17 of 24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During the re-examination, the MAH argued that a possible factor in the initial rate of LTR following 
randomization is that patients were aware of the randomization to double-blind treatment at the end of 
the  open-label  phase,  with  50%  of  patients  receiving  placebo  from  that  point  onward.  Therefore, 
patients may have been more likely at that time to perceive any change in symptoms as being due to a 
switch  to  placebo  treatment,  potentially  affecting  their  perception  of  pain  symptoms.  By  contrast, 
patients  who  had  participated  in  the  double-blind  phase  for  a  longer  period  of  time  were  aware  that 
their  treatment  had  not  been  changed  recently,  and  therefore  were  less  likely  to  perceive  symptom 
changes as resulting from a change in treatment. The MAH also pointed out that similar Kaplan-Meier 
response profiles are observed across the pain randomized withdrawal design in pain (tramadol in the 
treatment  of  fibromyalgia),  anxiety  (GAD  Lyrica),  and  depression  (relapse  prevention  studies) 
literature. 
The SAG agreed that the early loss of effect is difficult to explain and it is unclear as to how physical 
and psychological features might have influenced the loss of efficacy. The SAG expressed concerns 
over the blinding and how it could affect psychiatric comorbidities. Beside, a nocebo effect cannot be 
excluded if patients believed to have been put on placebo arm (again proving the high placebo effect). 
The SAG also noted that responders to active treatment were randomised to continue active treatment 
or receive placebo. This creates a rather enriched and compliant population which is not representative 
of the fibromyalgia population.  
Finally, as study 1059 was performed in the US maintenance of the effect in the EU population has 
therefore not been established. This is even more unfortunate in view of the lack of demonstration of 
consistent and clinically relevant short term effect of Lyrica in the treatment of fibromyalgia, as shown 
by the rather small effect size on pain and functional improvement, especially on EU patients. 
Proposed indication in treatment of fibromyalgia in adults experiencing moderate to severe pain 
The original indication claimed within the present application was treatment of fibromyalgia in adults.  
The  MAH  suggested  a  modified  indication  specific  to  the  clinical  trial  population  studied  in  the 
pregabalin fibromyalgia clinical development program. Although the MAH support the position that 
pregabalin should be indicated for treatment of fibromyalgia, they believed that this modified version 
of  the  indication  would  be  consistent  with  the  clinical  trial  population  in  which  significant  relevant 
benefit has been demonstrated. Asked about whether pain in fibromyalgia might be from neuropathic 
origin,  the  SAG  CNS  concluded  that  there  is  no  evidence  of  a  primary  neurological  cause  for 
fibromyalgic pain. It is not excluded that the pain might be nociceptive in origin but this is not proven. 
A subset of patients might have had pain of neuropathic origin in spite of the exclusion criteria of the 
study, but this would not be valid for the general fibromyalgia population. Based on the above and the 
known  modulator  effect  of  pregabalin  on  neuropathic  pain,  the  CHMP  disagreed  with  the  modified 
indication proposed by the MAH. 
1.3.3 Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
In the combined controlled and uncontrolled studies in patients with fibromyalgia, 3446 patients were 
exposed to pregabalin of whom 2081 (60.4%) prematurely withdrew from treatment. The disposition 
of subjects in the controlled studies is summarized in table 17.

The overall frequency of adverse events reported in the pregabalin treatment group was higher than that in 
the  placebo  treatment  group  and  this  frequency  increased  with  increasing  dose.  The  most  common 
treatment-emergent adverse events experienced by pregabalin-treated patients were dizziness, somnolence, 
headache  and  weight  increased.  As  regards  dose  distribution,  the  respective  percentages  for  the  300

Serious adverse events and deaths 
Overall,  34  (1.6%)  of  the  2068 pregabalin-treated  patients  (controlled  studies)  experienced  serious 
adverse events compared to 11 (1.6%) of the 689 placebo-treated patients. Four deaths were reported 
in the clinical studies but none was related to pregabalin treatment. The rate of severe adverse events is 
also reduced when a lower dose range of pregabalin 300-450 mg/day (as opposed to 300-600 mg/day) 
is considered. Across the pregabalin doses, the frequency of severe adverse events generally increased 
with  increasing  dose  from  12.9%  (150  mg/day)  to  15.6%  (300  mg/day),  to  13.8%  (450  mg/day),  to 
16.8% (600 mg/day). 
Laboratory findings 
The overall pattern of changes in clinical laboratory values was similar among the controlled and the 
combined controlled and uncontrolled studies and no new clinical laboratory findings of concern were 
identified with longer-term pregabalin treatment. However, there were four cases of pregabalin-treated 
patients  participating  in  controlled  studies  who  discontinued  treatment  due  to  abnormal  clinical 
20 of 24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
laboratory test i.e. elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT; 71 IU/L under pregabalin 600 mg daily, 
possibly  related),  elevated  levels  of  aspartate  aminotransferase  (AST)  and  ALT  (pregabalin  600  mg 
daily,  possibly  related),  abnormally  high  liver  function  tests  (AST=77 IU/L,  ALT=98 IU/L,  on 
pregabalin  600 mg  daily,  although  possibly  related)  and  mild  neutropenia  (Pregabalin  150-mg, 
recovered).  
Safety in special populations 
The  safety  profile  of  pregabalin  among  elderly  patients  with  fibromyalgia  participating  in  the 
controlled  studies  was  generally  comparable  with  that  among  younger  patients,  with  some  adverse 
events reported at higher frequencies among elderly patients (eg, dizziness, edema peripheral, fatigue, 
vision  blurred,  balance  disorder,  tremor)  and  some  adverse  events  reported  at  higher  frequencies 
among  non-elderly  patients  (e.g.  disturbance  in  attention,  euphoric  mood,  memory  impairment, 
anxiety, depression, disorientation). 
Discontinuation due to AES 
Discontinuation rate due to adverse events in pregabalin-treated patients was higher in the combined 
controlled  and  uncontrolled  studies  (25.1%)  than  that  in  the  controlled  studies  (20.4%).  In  the 
controlled  studies,  the  frequency  of  withdrawals  among  pregabalin-treated  patients  (20.4%)  was 
approximately double that among placebo-treated patients (10.9%). Of note, it is currently mentioned 
under section 4.8 of the approved SPC for Lyrica that in all controlled studies, the discontinuation rate 
due  to  adverse  reactions  was  13%  for  patients  receiving  pregabalin  and  7%  for  patients  receiving 
placebo.  This  rate  is  lower  than  in  fibromyalgia  studies.  Therefore,  the  MAH’s  conclusion  that 
fibromyalgia  patients  have  a  similar  likelihood  of  discontinuing  due  to  adverse  events  relative  to 
placebo as compared with the other indications treated with pregabalin is questionable. However, this 
incidence maybe considered high due to the fact that fibromyalgic patients are more reactive to stress 
and have a spontaneously high rate of complaints which might impact negatively on their motivation 
to remain in a clinical study environment. This is also observed to a lesser extent in the placebo treated 
patients. As regards dose distribution, the discontinuations rates were 10.4%, 8.3%, 16.4%, 20.2% and 
28.2% for placebo, pregabalin 150 mg/day, 300 mg/day, 450 mg/day and 600 mg/day respectively. 
During pregabalin treatment phase in the 6-month maintenance of effect Study 1059, the frequency of 
patient discontinuations due to adverse events (25.0%), treatment-related adverse events (20.9%), and 
serious  adverse  events  (1.0%)  were  almost  identical  to  those  in  the  combined  controlled  and 
uncontrolled studies. Events with a withdrawal rate ≥1% were Dizziness (5.9%), Somnolence (3.5%), 
Weight  increase  (1.7%),  Nausea  (1.5%),  Fatigue  (1.2%),  Headache  (1.2%)  and  disturbances  in 
attention (1.1%). 
Although  similar  in  nature  to  those  observed  in  previously  approved  indications,  the  CHMP  has 
expressed concern over the rate of withdrawals due to adverse events in the fibromyalgia studies. The 
overall safety and tolerability data indicate that fibromyalgia patients are likely to discontinue due to 
adverse  effects  when  treated  with  pregabalin  at  rates  consistent  with  that  for  other  approved 
indications. Fibromyalgia patients appear more prone to discontinue due to adverse events even when 
treated  with  placebo.  When  the  discontinuation  rates  due  to  adverse  events  with  pregabalin  are 
examined  relative  to  the  incidence  rates  with  placebo  treatment,  the  relative  rates  are  similar  across 
indications (figure 4).

The  overall  safety  profile  does  not  appear  very  different  for  fibromyalgia  patients  than  for  patients 
treated  with  pregabalin  for  neuropathic  pain,  epilepsy  and  anxiety.  During  the  re-examination,  the 
MAH proposed a new dose range of pregabalin 300-450 mg/day, excluding the 600 mg/day dose to 
allow for a lower incidence of adverse events compared with pregabalin 600 mg/day. It is uncertain 
that all adverse events are dose dependent but it appears that with respect to the three most commonly 
reported ADRs (dizzines, somnolence and weight gain) the ADR rates are lower over the dose range 
of 300-450 mg/day vs. 600 mg/day. 
Risk Management plan 
The  MAH  submitted  an  updated  version  of  the  RMP  (version  4.0,  dated  March  2008).  However,  as 
this indication was not approved, the assessment of the updated RMP is not relevant. 
User testing  
A  user  testing  performed  by  the  MAH  was  submitted  with  this  extension  of  indication  application. 
However, as this indication was not approved, the assessment of the user testing is not relevant. 
However,  the  MAH  indicated  that  the  same  key  safety  issues,  same  dosing  scheme,  route  of 
administrations, contra-indications, warnings and side effects apply to the indication fibromyalgia as 
for  the  other  approved  indications,  and  these  issues  have  already  been  tested  in  the  leaflet  with 
reference to the currently approved indications. Therefore, the CHMP agreed with the MAH that no 
new user testing round is considered necessary.  
1.3.4 Conclusions and Benefit / Risk Assessment  
Four  pivotal  short-term  studies  and  a  long-term  maintenance  study  were  provided  to  support  this 
application. 
In the pooled results, the 50% responder rates difference between pregabalin all dose treatment groups 
and placebo is of 8.6%. Whether this difference is clinically significant is questionable.  
When the results on primary efficacy analyses of each individual study are concerned, the size effect is 
considered  to  be  inconsistent  and  small.  The  US  Studies  1056  and  1077  show  a  consistent  dose 
response effect which is not observed in study 1100, the only study containing European patients .

In study 1100, the mean baseline pain score was 6.65 (SD 1.36) and the mean difference in pain scores 
with  placebo  for  the  450  mg  pregabalin  dose  is  -0.54.  This  is  the  only  dose  statistically  significant 
different from placebo in this study.  
For  2  of  the  3  US  studies  (studies  1056  and  1077),  the  results  showed  a  statistically  significant 
improvement  of  pain  scores  and  are  consistent  within  the  3  doses.  However,  the  mean  difference  in 
pain scores with placebo was 1 point (only for the 600 mg dose that is no more proposed by the MAH) 
or less for the other doses on an 11-point pain-scale. This is considered a small magnitude of effect.  
When the >50% responder rate is considered for each individual studies, it was higher for pregabalin 
300 and 450 mg/day than for placebo treatment. Although this difference was statistically significant 
in 2 studies out of 3, the responder rates differ only about 8-12% (study 1100 and 1077).  
The  CHMP  is  of  the  opinion  that  stringent  consistency  of  secondary  measures  with  the  primary 
outcome variables was not demonstrated, especially on the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), 
the functional outcome of fibromyalgia. The significant differences in mean pain score, PGIC and FIQ 
between  placebo  and  pregabalin  are  not  considered  clinically  meaningful.  Pregabalin  is  already 
recognized for having an effect on neuropathic pain. However, it was not demonstrated that there is a 
short-term effect (pain and functional outcome) in the specific indication of fibromyalgia.  
The  CHMP  also  considered  that  a  clear  dose  response  effect  was  not  observed.  On  the  primary 
efficacy analysis, pregabalin dose of 450 mg/day was statistically significant different from placebo in 
the three pivotal studies. A statistically significant reduction in pain scores was demonstrated with the 
dose of 300 mg/day in two of the four studies and with the 600 mg/day dose. For the 600 mg dose, 
results are inconsistent across the studies, especially in the study including EU patients. In addition, on 
the  functional  aspect  of  the  indication, the  results  of  the  pivotal  studies  in  the overall  FIQ  score  are 
more or less consistent for the 450 mg/day dose. These results were even less consistent for pregabalin 
300 and 600 mg/day.  No dose response relationship could be shown. It is however acknowledged that 
the  MAH  proposed  to  remove  the  600  mg  dose  as  a  dosing  regimen  option  and  put  the  maximum 
optimal dose at 450 mg/day. 
An additional concern was the lack of a demonstrated maintenance of the effect. 
As far as the EU population is concerned, the differences in mean pain score and FIQ and to a lesser 
extent in PGIC between placebo and pregabalin are not considered consistently clinically meaningful 
as  regards  short  term  efficacy  of  Lyrica  in  the  claimed  indication.  Furthermore,  maintenance  of  the 
effect in the EU population has not been established. It is therefore considered that proof of efficacy of 
pregabalin specifically in the European fibromyalgia population has not been demonstrated.  
The  known  safety  profile  of  pregabalin,  the  high  discontinuation  rate  due  to  adverse  events  and  the 
considerable  placebo  effect  in  the  overall  development  programme  for  fibromyalgia  appearing  to be 
somewhat  related  to  this  specific  population,  are  not  counterbalanced  by  a  significantly  clinical 
meaningful effect of the product in the claimed indication.  
The MAH’s grounds for re-examination, provided by the MAH on 22 June 2009, were divided into 5 
major parts, according to the grounds for refusal adopted on 23 April 2009. These were related to the 
short-term efficacy, the dose-response relationship, the maintenance of effect, the safety and efficacy 
in a representative EU population, the known adverse  events and the clinical relevance of the effect 
size and overall benefit/risk. 
The above-mentioned information could not change the previous view of the CHMP.

II.  CONCLUSION 
On 23 July 2009 the CHMP considered this Type II variation not to be acceptable on the following 
grounds:  
− 
− 
− 
− 
the short-term efficacy of Lyrica in the claimed indication, treatment of fibromyalgia in adults 
experiencing moderate to severe pain, has not been sufficiently demonstrated since no consistent 
and clinically relevant benefit for patients has been shown in pain and functional improvement; 
the maintenance of effect has not been convincingly demonstrated; 
the efficacy and safety of Lyrica in a representative EU-population with fibromyalgia have not 
been demonstrated. The US population cannot be extrapolated to the EU population taking into 
account the differences in practices, consistency in phenotypes and results; 
the known adverse events and doubtful clinical relevance of the effect size observed renders the 
overall benefit/risk negative; 
Therefore, on the basis of the current available efficacy and safety data, the CHMP considered that the 
benefit/risk of Lyrica in the treatment of fibromyalgia in adults experiencing moderate to severe pain 
is unfavourable.

Introduction 
SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
Kivexa,  which  contains  600  mg  abacavir  and  300 mg  lamivudine  in  each  film-coated  tablet,  is 
intended for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection in adults.  
Kivexa is a new fixed dose combination of previously known active substances. Medicinal products 
containing lamivudine (150 mg, 300 mg film-coated tablets and 10 mg/ml oral solution) and abacavir 
(300  mg  film-coated  tablets  and  20  mg/ml  oral  solution)  have  already  been  approved  via  the 
centralised  procedure  for  the  treatment  of  HIV  infection.  The  recommended  dose  for  lamivudine  is 
either 150 mg twice daily or 300 mg once daily in adults. For abacavir the approved dose was initially 
only  300  mg  twice  daily  but  a  once  daily  dosing  regimen  has  just  been  recommended  (600  mg 
abacavir  once  daily).  In  addition,  two  fixed  dose  combinations  have  already  been  approved  via  the 
centralised procedure: the first one consisting of lamivudine 150 mg and zidovudine 300 mg as film-
coated  tablets  and  the  second  one  consisting  of  300  mg  abacavir,  150 mg  lamivudine  and  300 mg 
zidovudine as film-coated tablet. 
In  the  context  of  a  chronic  disease  where  non-adherence  is  a  critical  problem  with  potential 
consequence in term of risk of emergence of resistance, the development of a fixed combination with a 
once daily administration could be a way in alleviating the constraints of patients.  
The  approved  indication  is:  “Kivexa  is  a  fixed-dose  combination  of  two  nucleoside  analogues 
(abacavir  and  lamivudine).  It  is  indicated  in  antiretroviral  combination  therapy  for  the  treatment  of 
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age. 
The demonstration of the benefit of the combination abacavir/lamivudine as a once daily regimen in 
antiretroviral  therapy,  is  mainly  based  on  results  of  one  study  performed  in  primarily  asymptomatic 
treatment-naïve adult patients”.

Part II: Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Introduction 
Kivexa is formulated as a film-coated tablet containing 600 mg of abacavir (corresponding to 702 mg 
of abacavir sulfate) and 300 mg of lamivudine, as active substances.  
The other ingredients include microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycolate type A, magnesium 
stearate  and  Opadry  orange  [hypromellose,  titanium  dioxide  (E171),  macrogol  400,  polysorbate  80, 
sunset yellow aluminium lake (E110)]. 
It  is  presented  either  in  opaque  white  polyvinyl  chloride  (PVC)/polyvinylidene  chloride  (PVdC)/ 
aluminium (alu) blisters or in high-density polyethylene (HPDE) bottles with a child-resistant closure. 
Active Substance  
No  change  has  been  made  to  abacavir  and  lamivudine  active  substances  already  approved  through 
centralised  procedures  either  as  individual  active  substances  (abacavir  EU/1/99/112/001-003, 
lamivudine  EU/1/96/15/001-003  and  EU/1/99/114/001-003)  or  as  part  of  fixed  combinations 
(lamivudine/zidovudine  EU/1/98/05/001-002  and  lamivudine/abacavir/zidovudine  EU/1/00/156/001-
003).

Pharmaceutical Development 
This  fixed  combination  with  a  once  daily  administration  has  been  developed  as  a  more  convenient 
presentation to support patient adherence to treatment by reducing daily pill burden. 
The  pharmaceutical  development  was  based  on  the  already  authorised  formulations  (see  active 
substance). The formula and the direct compression manufacturing process are thus purposely similar 
to  those  of  tablet  formulations  containing  only  abacavir  or  lamivudine  as  active  substance. 
Compatibility of the active substances with the excipients is supported by forced degradation studies 
on  the  individual  active  substances,  on  the  triple  combination  product  and  on  abacavir-lamivudine 
tablets.  
Formulation  and  process  optimisation  studies  together  with  manufacturing  experience  indicated  that 
acceptable  blend  uniformity  and  key  finished  product  characteristics  are  obtained  when  using 
constituents  having  a  particle  size  within  normal  range  as  procured  by  suppliers.  Both  active 
substances are soluble, and the physical characteristics are the same as those already authorised on an 
individual basis. 
All the excipients selected are of PhEur quality except sunset yellow, which is adequately controlled 
according  to  a  different  standard.  The  colouring  materials  (sunset  yellow  and  titanium  dioxide) 
comply  with  the  European  directive  relating  to  colouring  matters  that  may  be  added  to  medicinal 
products  and  they  conform  with  the  purity  criteria  stipulated  by  the  European  directive  concerning 
colours for use in foodstuff. 
Regarding the TSE risk, the formulation does not include any components of ruminant origin. 
Satisfactory  specifications  have  been  provided  for  the  opaque  PVC/PVdC/alu  blister  and  for  the 
HDPE bottle. Compliance with European regulation on plastic materials and articles intended to come 
into contact with foodstuffs has been confirmed. 
The  bioequivalence  batch  and  clinical  trial  batches  were  manufactured  using  the  commercial 
formulation and process (at both pilot scale and full-scale) at the commercial manufacturing site. 
• 
Manufacture of the Product 
The manufacturing process consists of a standard direct compression process comprising the following 
operations: weighing, sieving, blending, tablet compression, and aqueous film-coating. 
The  maximum  holding  time  for  the  unpreserved  film-coating  suspension  has  been  satisfactory 
validated based on microbiological data.  
Process validation data provided for 4 production scale batches (including the biobatch) and one pilot 
scale batch manufactured at the commercial manufacturing site showed that the manufacturing process 
is robust and well controlled.  
• 
Product Specification 
The  product  specification  includes  tests  controlled  by  validated  methods  for  appearance,  identity  of 
abacavir and lamivudine (HPLC and TLC), identity of titanium dioxide and sunset yellow aluminium 
lake, assay (HPLC), uniformity of content (PhEur), impurity content, dissolution, microbial limit tests 
(PhEur non routine test). 
As single-point  dissolution test specification has been selected for abacavir/lamivudine tablets based 
on  dissolution  characteristics  of  the  bioequivalence  batch  (see  bioequivalence  and  bioavailability 
studies). 
A  low  water  activity  has  been  shown  for  abacavir/lamivudine  tablets.  Therefore,  microbiological 
contamination can be considered unlikely, and thus a routine microbial limit test not necessary.

Batch  analysis  data  provided  for  3  full-scale  batches  manufactured  according  to  the  proposed 
commercial process at the proposed commercial manufacturing site meet the specification at the time 
of release and confirm the robustness and reproducibility of the manufacturing process. 
• 
Stability of the Product 
24-month  data  under  long-term  conditions  (30°C/60%  RH  -  bottle  and  blister  intended  for 
commercialisation) and 6-month data under accelerated conditions (40ºC/75 % RH – bottle and blister 
intended for commercialisation) have been provided for 2 production scale batches and 1 pilot-scale 
batch.  12-month  data  under  long-term  conditions  (30°C/60%RH  -  bottle  and  blister  intended  for 
commercialisation) and 6-month data under accelerated conditions (40ºC/75 %RH – bottle and blister 
intended  for  commercialisation)  have  been  provided  for  1  production  scale  batch.  A  photostability 
study has also been performed and shows that the product is not light-sensitive. 
The results presented support the proposed shelf life and storage conditions defined in the Summary of 
Product Characteristics. 
• 
Bioequivalence and bioavailability studies 
Bioequivalence 
A single bioequivalence study (CAL10001) was conducted to assess the bioequivalence between the 
fixed  dose  combination  of  abacavir/lamivudine  (600 mg/300 mg)  and  the  single  entity  products 
abacavir 2 x 300 mg and lamivudine 2 x 150 mg under fasted and fed conditions. The results indicate 
satisfactory bioequivalence (for further information see clinical section). 
Dissolution and in vivo bioavailability  
In the bioequivalence study, both abacavir and lamivudine were detected in the plasma of 100% of the 
subjects  within  30  minutes  post-oral  administration.  The  same  batch  of  abacavir/lamivudine  tablets 
showed  complete  in  vitro  release  after  30  minutes.  Therefore,  the  dissolution  method  may  be 
considered to be indicative of in vivo performance. 
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
No  unauthorised  change  has  been  made  to  abacavir  and  lamivudine  active  substances  already 
authorised  via  the  centralised  procedure.  The  pharmaceutical  form  selected  is  adequate  taken  into 
account  the  properties  and  the  stability  of  the  active  substances  and  it  is  a  well-accepted 
pharmaceutical  form  for  oral  administration.  The  excipients  are  commonly  used  for  this  kind  of 
formulation  and  the  packaging  material  is  well  documented.  The  manufacturing  process  allows 
obtaining reproducible finished product batches. Stability tests under ICH conditions indicate that the 
product is stable for the proposed shelf life.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion there were no remaining quality issues.

Part III: Toxico-pharmacological aspects 
Introduction 
Abacavir  and  lamivudine  are  nucleoside  reverse  transcriptase  inhibitors  that  have  been  shown  to  be 
have  an  antiviral  activity  against  HIV.  No  specific  preclinical studies have  been performed with the 
fixed dose combination. The applicant has provided an overview of the comprehensive information on 
each active substance together with a summary of findings from a mitochondrial toxicity study with 
abacavir  and  lamivudine  in  CCRF-CEM  cells  that  had  not  been  previously  submitted.  Previous 
findings  with  the  individual  components  in  relation  to  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and 
toxicology are summarised in the below sections.

Pharmacology 
• 
Primary pharmacodynamics (in vitro/in vivo) 
Abacavir,  a  guanosine  analogue,  and  lamivudine,  a  cytosine  analogue,  are  nucleoside  reverse 
transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Both agents are metabolised sequentially by intracellular kinases to 
the  respective  5’-triphosphate  (TP)  active  forms.  Carbovir-TP  (the  active  triphosphate  form  of 
abacavir)  and  lamivudine-TP  inhibit  the  activity  of  the  HIV-1-RT  by  competing  with  the  natural 
nucleotide substrate and its incorporation into viral DNA. The lack of 3’-OH group in the incorporated 
nucleoside analogue prevents the formation of the 5’ to 3’ phosphodiester linkage essential for DNA 
chain elongation and therefore the viral DNA growth is terminated. 
In vivo the intracellular half-life of carbovir-TP is 20.64 hours whereas the one for lamivudine-TP is 
10 to 15.5 hours. 
Antiviral activity 
Abacavir 
Abacavir  has  been  shown  to  inhibit  replication  of  laboratory  strains  and  clinical  isolates  of  HIV  in 
transformed  T  cell  lines,  monocyte/macrophage  derived  lines  and  primary  cultures  of  activated 
peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and monocytes/macrophages. IC50s (the concentration inhibiting 
viral replication by 50%) ranged from 0.26 to 7.5 µM depending on virus strain and host cell type.  
Lamivudine 
Lamivudine has been shown to inhibit replication of several laboratory strains and clinical isolates of 
HIV-1  and  HIV-2  in  one  of  a  number  of  different  lymphocyte  or  monocyte  cell  lines  or  in  fresh 
human PBLs. IC50s were in the range 2 nM to 15 µM.  
Combination 
The  in  vitro  activity  of  abacavir  in  combination  with  lamivudine  was  investigated  in  clinical  virus 
isolates, along with abacavir in combination with various other anti-HIV agents (Daluge et al., 1997). 
Abacavir  in  combination  with  lamivudine  exhibited  additive  anti-HIV activity,  and  all  other 
combinations were additive or synergistic.  None of the combinations were antagonistic. 
Resistance 
Viral resistance to abacavir develops relatively slowly in vitro and in vivo requiring multiple mutations 
to  reach  a  8-fold  increase  in  IC50  over  wild-type  virus.  Isolates  resistant  to  abacavir  may  also  show 
reduced  sensitivity  to  lamivudine,  zalcitabine,  tenofovir,  emtricitabine  and/or  didanosine  but  remain 
sensitive  to  stavudine  and  zidovudine.  Abacavir-resistant  isolates  of  HIV-1  selected  in  vitro  are 
associated  with  specific  genotypic  changes  in  the  RT  codon  region  (M184V,  K65R,  L74V  and 
Y115F). The first abacavir-resistance mutation detected is generally a change at codon 184, conferring 
a 2-3-fold decrease in HIV-1 susceptibility to abacavir.  
Viral strains resistant to lamivudine also possess a mutation at codon 184 (M184I or V).  
Cross-resistance studies with abacavir-associated mutations in HIV-1 strain HXB2 revealed reductions 
in  sensitivity  to  didanosine  and  lamivudine.  In  clinical  samples,  lamivudine  resistant  HIV  remained 
susceptible  to  zidovudine.  Furthermore,  the  M184V  mutation,  in  the  context  of  several  zidovudine-
associated mutations, restores zidovudine sensitivity to some degree.  
• 
Secondary pharmacodynamics 
Lamivudine is also active against hepatitis B virus and has been approved for the treatment of HBV 
infection at the dose of 100 mg once daily. Abacavir has also shown anti-HBV activity.

Safety pharmacology 
4/29 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Abacavir  had  no  major  effects  on  organ  systems  at  doses  up  to  1000  mg/kg  administered  orally  in 
mice and at doses up to 100 mg/kg administered intravenously in rats.  
Lamivudine  administered  in  mouse  with  oral  doses  up  to  300  mg/kg  did  not  have  any  effect  on 
intestinal  transport.  There  were  no  effects  on  respiratory  system  nor  on  cardiovascular  system 
including blood pressure, heart rate and electrocardiogram with doses up to 100 mg/kg by intravenous 
route in anaesthetised cats and up 600 mg/kg by oral route in dogs.  
• 
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
No specific interaction studies have been carried out. 
Pharmacokinetics 
• 
Absorption- Bioavailability 
Abacavir 
After  oral  administration  to  rats,  mice  and  monkeys  abacavir  was  rapidly  absorbed  leading  to  an 
exposure proportional to the dose. The bioavailability in mice and monkeys was greater than 76% and 
the  pharmacokinetic  parameters  after  single  or  repeated  administration  were  similar.  Systemic 
exposure  was  similar  after  oral  dosing  in  pregnant  and  non-pregnant  rats,  as  well  as  in  infant  and 
mature rats. 
Lamivudine 
After oral administration, lamivudine was rapidly absorbed in rats and dogs with a bioavailability of 
60 % and 80 % respectively. The limiting factor of  bioavailability in dogs was metabolism while in 
the rat it was absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. After repeated doses in the rat, the relationship 
between  dose  and  concentration  of  lamivudine  in  plasma  was  linear,  and  in  general  there  was  no 
change  in  systemic  exposure  over  a  dosing  period  of  up  to  6  months.    Repeated  administration  of 
lamivudine to the dog for up to 12 months caused an increase in systemic exposure. 
• 
Distribution 
Abacavir 
Abacavir  distributed  extensively  to  tissues.  Measurable  concentrations  were  found  in  cerebro-spinal 
fluid and brain in mice (CSF:blood ratios ranging from 0.36-0.51 and brain:blood ratios ranging from 
0.09-0.11). In monkeys micromolar concentrations of abacavir were measured in both CSF and plasma 
after  dosing.  In  pregnant  rabbits  and  rats,  abacavir-related  material  crossed  the  placenta  and  was 
excreted in maternal milk. The protein binding in mice, monkeys and humans is low to moderate (19-
49 %). It binds extensively to melanin-containing tissues but ocular toxicity was not observed.  
Lamivudine  
Lamivudine distributed widely and rapidly through the rat tissues. It crossed the placenta in rats and 
rabbits and was excreted in maternal milk. There were no signs of accumulation. The protein binding 
was moderate to low (35-50 % to <10 %) and it did not bind to melanin in pigmented rats.  
• 
Metabolism (in vitro/in vivo) and excretion 
Abacavir  
Abacavir is mainly cleared by hepatic route. Only 10-13 % of mice or monkeys dose and 2 % of the 
human  dose  undergo  urinary  excretion  unchanged.  Metabolism  seems  to  occur  mainly  through 
alcohol/aldehyde  dehydrogenase  and  glucoronidation  pathways,  with  less  involvement  of  CYP450 
isoenzymes in humans and monkeys. The metabolic profile is qualitatively similar in mice, monkeys 
and  humans.  The  two  main  metabolites  in  monkeys  and  humans  are  a  5’-glucoronide  and  a  5’-
carboxylic  acid.  Minor  metabolites  were  also  identified  carbovir  and  139U91  representing  less  than 
2.5 % of the abacavir concentrations.  
5/29 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Lamivudine 
Lamivudine is almost entirely excreted via renal elimination in rats with an active tubular secretion, 
but  without  metabolism.  Following  oral  administration,  about  60  %  of  lamivudine  was  recovered  in 
urine as unchanged. Two minor metabolites (< 5 %) were detected. The remaining was recovered in 
faeces  indicating  incomplete  absorption.  In  dogs,  lamivudine  excretion  involves  in  the  same 
proportion  both  renal  elimination  without  tubular  secretion  and  metabolism.  Quantitatively  two 
metabolites have been identified: trans-sulphoxide metabolite of lamivudine and a cytosine metabolite 
representing 40 % of the intravenous dose and 52 % of the oral dose. The kinetics in humans is closer 
to that occurring in rats.  
Interaction 
• 
In  vitro  studies  using  human  liver  microsomal  preparations  showed  no  evidence  for  inhibition  or 
induction of CYP450 activity at clinically relevant concentrations of abacavir and of lamivudine.   
In  vitro  studies  showed  that  abacavir  metabolism  was  not  altered  by  ethanol,  but  ethanol  inhibited 
abacavir  metabolism.  In  an  in  vitro  human  liver  slice model, abacavir metabolism was not inhibited 
when co-incubated with amprenavir, which is a substrate of human microsomal CYP3A4. However in 
repeated  dose  studies  in  mice  slight  increases  in  the  activity  of  some  CYP450  isoenzymes  were 
observed, suggesting a weak enzyme inducing potential. 
Lamivudine  transport  across  Caco-2  cell  monolayers  was  not  affected  by  zidovudine,  zalcitabine, 
didanosine,  acyclovir,  probenecid,  trimethoprim,  sulfamethoxazole,  ranitidine  or  cimetidine.  In  the 
same  model,  lamivudine  did  not  affect  the  transport  of  didanosine,  zalcitabine  or  zidovudine.  In 
isolated  perfused  rat  kidney  the  elimination  of  lamivudine  was  not  affected  by  zidovudine  but 
zalcitabine  slightly  reduced  its  secretion.  The  only  interaction  observed  was  with  lamivudine  and 
trimethoprim. 
No interaction between abacavir and lamivudine at the level of the kinases for initial phosphorylation 
is expected, as the enzymes involved are different.  
Toxicology 
• 
Single dose toxicity 
Abacavir 
Abacavir had a low potential for toxicity in mice and rats. The median lethal doses were more than 
100 times higher than the dose of 600 mg once daily (12 mg/kg/day for a 50 kg person). 
Lamivudine 
Single doses of lamivudine up to 2000 mg/kg i.v. in rats and mice or 2 x 2000 mg/kg orally in mice 
were well tolerated without signs of target organ toxicity. 
• 
Repeat dose toxicity  
Abacavir 
Studies  were  conducted  in  mice  with  doses  up  to  708 mg/kg/day  for  1  and  6  months,  and  in 
cynomolgus monkeys with doses up to 297 mg/kg/day for 1, 3 and 12 months.  In addition, a 3-month 
study was performed in Wistar Han rats with doses up to 375 mg/kg/day.  The majority of repeat-dose 
toxicity studies were performed using the succinate salt of abacavir; however, all doses are expressed 
in terms of the base.  
The primary target organ for toxicity of abacavir is the liver in mice, rats and monkeys. There was an 
increase in liver weight at the dose of 234 mg/kg/day in mice and 200 mg/kg/day and above in rats.  
This  was  associated  with  mild  hepatocellular  hypertrophy,  increased  pigment  deposits  in  the 
centrilobular hepatocytes and/or Kupffer-cells in both species at these dosages. All treatment-related 
findings reversed following the recovery period or showed evidence of regression within 4 weeks of 
6/29 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the  cessation  of  treatment.  Slight  increase  in  some  CYP450  enzymes  activity  was  observed  after  
6-month  administration  to  rodents.  In  monkeys,  there  were  minor  changes  in  serum  triglyceride 
concentrations and equivocal increases in alanine aminotransferase were seen at 297 mg/kg/day.   
Abacavir caused changes in the haemapoietic system. In rats these changes, occasionally noted at all 
doses,  included  minimal  decrease  in  red  blood  cell  parameters  and  increased  leucocytes  count 
(especially  lymphocytes).  There  was  no  evidence  of  an  effect  on  bone  marrow.  These  changes 
reversed in the recovery period. In monkeys, the haematological changes noted at all doses were mild 
(approximately  15  %)  and  corresponded  to  slight  decrease  in  red  blood  cell  counts  occasionally 
accompanied by decreased haemoglobin concentrations and haematocrit. 
In  the  3-month  study  in  rats,  germ  cell  loss  in  the  testis was seen in males with the highest dose of 
452 mg/kg/day.  The reversibility of the finding was not investigated, but the no effect level for this 
finding was 96 mg/kg/day, at which systemic exposure was 13 times higher than in humans following 
a once daily 600 mg dose.   
Lamivudine 
The toxicity of lamivudine was assessed in rats with doses up to 2000 mg/kg twice daily in studies of 
1, 3 and 6 months duration, and in the dogs with doses up to 1500 mg/kg twice daily in studies of 14 
days, 3 and 12 months duration.  For all these studies, lamivudine was administered as a solution in 
acetate buffer (pH 3.7) by oral gavage. 
Lamivudine  caused  changes  to  the  haematopoietic  system.  In  dogs,  a  decrease  in  red  blood  count, 
accompanied by increases in mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular haemoglobin was noted 
at  all  doses.  The  same  changes  were  noted  in  rats but less  pronounced (not exceeding 10%) than  in 
dogs.  
Changes in the caecum were observed in rats.  In the 6-month study, these changes noted at the dose 
of  2000 mg/kg  twice  daily  comprised  slight  to  moderate,  diffuse,  mucosal  hyperplasia,  with  local 
inflammatory cell infiltration and slight sub-epithelial eosinophilia.  In recovery animals, some slight 
sub-epithelial eosinophilia was still present, but the other features had regressed.  These changes could 
be  considered  as  a  result  of  low  grade  irritation  to  the  caecum  produced  by  very  high  oral  doses  of 
lamivudine.   
• 
Reproductive and developmental studies 
Abacavir 
Abacavir did not cause any adverse effects on the mating performance or fertility of rats with doses up 
to  427  mg/kg/day.  At  this  dose,  which  was  maternally  toxic,  there  was  evidence  of  toxicity  to  the 
developing embryo and foetus (increased resorptions and decreased foetal body weights).   
In  rabbits  no  embryofoetal  toxicity  was  observed  even  at  materno-toxic  doses.  In  an  embryofoetal 
study in rats, there was evidence of toxicity corresponding to decreased body weight, foetal oedema, 
early intra-uterine deaths and skeletal malformations and variations at the maternally toxic dose of 648 
mg/kg/day. The AUC0-24 at the lowest no effect level (seen in the rat fertility and embryofetal study) 
was 118 µg.h/ml, which is approximately 10 times the daily AUC in humans at the therapeutic dose of 
600 mg once daily. 
Abacavir  at  500  mg/kg/day  showed  peri-post  natal  toxicity  either  maternal  or  to  the  progeny  with 
reduced body weight in offspring F1 during lactation and throughout the remainder of post-natal life, 
through mating to birth of the F2 litters.  
Lamivudine 
Lamivudine  did  not  impair  the  overall  reproductive  performance  in  rats.  There  was  no  evidence  of 
teratogenic  potential  in  rats  (at  doses  up  to  2000  mg/kg  BID)  or  rabbits  (at  doses  up  to  500  mg/kg 
BID)  and  it  did  not  induce  peri-post  natal  toxicity  in  rats.  The  dams  and  offspring  showed 
swollen/reddened  anus/rectum  during  lactation  period  correlated  with  histological  inflammatory 
changes at the ano-rectal junction. The findings were attributed to prolonged exposure of caecal region 
to  large  amounts  of  irritating  agent.  In  the  juvenile  animals  mild  microcytic  anaemia  was  observed, 
7/29 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
similar to adult animals in repeat dose studies. Reduction of testis weights with histological changes 
corresponding to slight to moderate dilation of the seminiferous tubules was observed in high dosed 
males (2000 mg/kg/day). Testicular findings were not found in adult animals suggesting that the effect 
is related to testicular immaturity/developing status. The safety margin for this finding versus 300 mg 
daily human dose was higher than 80.    
• 
Genotoxicity in vitro and in vivo  
Abacavir 
Abacavir was not mutagenic in the presence or absence of metabolic activation at concentrations up to 
3540 µg/plate in different S. typhimurium strains, or at concentrations up to 5086 µg/plate in several E. 
coli  strains.  Mutagenicity  was  observed  in  the  mouse  lymphoma  assay  with  doses  up  to  177 µg/ml, 
which produced 6-fold increase in mutant frequency, compared to controls. 
In  human  lymphocytes  chromosomal  aberrations  were  observed  in  the  presence  or  absence  of  S9 
metabolic activation after 3 hours exposure at doses of 2800 µg/ml and above (the result obtained in 
absence of S9 was not reproducible). Chromosomal aberrations were also observed in the absence of 
S9 after 50 hours exposure to concentrations of 100µg/ml or higher. This concentration corresponds to 
around 20 times the Cmax expected in human with 600 mg at a once daily regimen. There was no effect 
using 27 hours treatment period. These results may be related to the overwhelming of the specificity to 
virally-encoded reverse transcriptase versus mammalian cell polymerase enzymes.  
Abacavir  was  clastogenic  in  vivo  in  the  mouse  bone  marrow  micronucleus  test  assay.  It  induced  a 
significant  increase  of  micronucleated  polychromatic  erythrocytes  in  male  mice  at  the  dose  of  708 
mg/ml, corresponding to a systemic exposure of 104.9 µg/ml, which is around 8.5 times higher than 
the  AUC  expected  in  human  after  600  mg  dose  once  daily  with  the  fixed  combination.  The 
corresponding Cmax was 41.2µg/ml, which is around 10 times higher than the expected in humans. 
Lamivudine  
Lamivudine was not mutagenic in the Ames test at concentrations up to 5000 µg/plate and fluctuation 
test  using  E.  coli  tester  strains.  In  the  mouse  lymphoma  assay,  small  increases  in  mutant  frequency 
were observed with concentrations from 1000 µg/ml.  In human peripheral lymphocytes, lamivudine 
showed clastogenicity at the highest concentrations of 300 µg/ml without S9 and 2292.5 µg/ml in the 
presence of S9. The concentration of 300 µg/ml is 150 times higher than the mean steady-state Cmax at 
the 300 mg once daily clinical dose. 
In mouse embryo cells lamivudine did not induce morphological transformation at concentrations up 
to 320 µg/ml without S9 or 5000µg/ml with S9.  
In vivo, lamivudine was not clastogenic in the rat bone marrow metaphase analysis assay, the rat bone 
marrow  micronucleus  assay  or  the  rat  liver  UDS  assay  following  oral  doses  of  up  to  2000  mg/kg. 
Plasma levels in the bone marrow metaphase analysis assay were around 30 to 40 times higher than 
clinical levels. 
• 
Carcinogenicity  
The carcinogenic potential of abacavir and lamivudine was evaluated individually in life-span studies 
in rats and mice. 
Abacavir  
An increased incidence of malignant and non-malignant tumours was noted, including in both species 
carcinoma  in  the  preputial  gland  of  males  and  in  the  clitoral  gland  of  females.  In  female  rats, 
carcinoma in the liver,  urinary bladder, lymph nodes and subcutis hemangiosarcoma were observed. 
These  neoplastic  findings  occurred  at  the  highest  doses  tested:  330  mg/kg/day  in  mice  and 
600 mg/kg/day in rats, with the exception of preputial gland carcinoma in male mice which occurred 
8/29 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
at 110 mg/kg/day. These doses gave a systemic exposure of respectively around 24 fold and 33 fold 
higher than the expected in humans treated with 600 mg/day. The non-effect dose levels were  
55 mg/kg/day in mice which corresponds to 3 times the AUC in humans, and 120 mg/kg/day in rats, 
which corresponds to 7 times the AUC in humans.  
Lamivudine 
Lamivudine was neither carcinogenic in mice with doses up to 2000 mg/kg/day (corresponding to 17-
fold the clinical exposure) nor in rats with doses up to 2000 mg/kg/day in males and 3000 mg/kg/day 
in females (corresponding to 60-90 fold the human exposure respectively).  
• 
Local tolerance  
Separate studies performed with lamivudine and abacavir did not reveal any skin/eye irritancy nor skin 
sensitising or antigenic potential.  
• 
Other toxicity studies 
Abacavir and lamivudine showed a very low cytotoxic potential.  
The potential for mitochondrial toxicity of lamivudine, abacavir and other NRTIs, alone or in different 
associations, was studied. Abacavir and carbovir showed low potential for inhibition of human DNA 
polymerases.  Abacavir  did  not  change  the  mitochondrial  content  in  a  human  leukaemic  cell  line. 
Lactate  production,  cell  growth,  glucose  consumption  and  LDH  leakage  were  not  changed  by  up  to 
54.2 µM abacavir in CCRF-CEM cells for 4 days. 
Lamivudine  did  not  significantly  induce  damage  to  mitochondrial  DNA  in  presence  of  normal 
functioning DNA repair mechanisms. Cell growth, lactate production, glucose consumption and LDH 
leakage were not affected by lamivudine in CCRF-CEM cells treated or 4 days with up to 32.5µM (3.6 
times the expected human Cmax following the fixed dose combination).  
The in vitro mitochondrial toxicity of abacavir and lamivudine as single agents, both in combination 
and in combination with other NRTIs have been investigated in CCRF-CEM human lymphoblastoid 
cells.  No synergetic effects due to the combination have been observed in comparison with abacavir 
and lamivudine as single agents. 
No new impurities are present in the fixed combination compared to the individual formulations and 
therefore no further studies were necessary.  
• 
Environmental risk assessment 
Based on an analysis of the environmental risk posed by the use of lamivudine, abacavir individually 
and  in  the  fixed  combination,  no  significant  risk  to  the  environment  related  to  the  use  of  Kivexa  is 
anticipated. 
Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Abacavir  and  lamivudine  are  nucleoside  reverse  transcriptase  inhibitors  that  have  been  shown  to  be 
potent  selective 
inhibitors  of  HIV-1.  No  specific  pharmacodynamic,  pharmacokinetic  and 
toxicological studies have been performed with the fixed dose combination but the applicant provided 
an overview of the comprehensive information on each active substance.  
HIV-1 resistance to lamivudine involves the development of a M184V amino acid change close to the 
active  site  of  the  viral  RT.  For  abacavir,  the  viral  resistance  involves  the  development  of  specific 
genotypic changes in the reverse transcriptase (RT) codon region (codons M184V, K65R, L74V and 
Y115F).  With  respect  to  safety  pharmacology  no  related  adverse  effects  were  seen  with  either 
compound.

The  pharmacokinetics  studies  showed  both  compounds  are  rapidly  absorbed  and  that  the 
bioavailability was for abacavir greater than 76% in monkeys and mice and for lamivudine 60% in rats 
and 80% in dogs respectively.  The in vitro binding was low for both compounds. Abacavir is mainly 
excreted  by  hepatic  clearance  with  the  main  routes  of  metabolism  were  alcohol/aldehyde 
dehydrogenase  and  the  glucuronation  pathways.  Lamivudine  is  almost  entirely  excreted  via  renal 
elimination with an active tubular secretion, but without metabolism.  
Both  abacavir  and  lamivudine  have  low  acute  toxicity.  In  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  with  abacavir 
and lamivudine, the most sensitive target organ was the haemopoietic system. The other target organs 
identified  were  the  liver  and  testis  for  abacavir  and  the  gastrointestinal  tract  for  lamivudine.  The 
clinical  relevance  of  increased  liver  weights  associated  with  abacavir  is  unknown  and  there  is  no 
evidence  from  clinical  studies  that  abacavir  is  hepatotoxic.  Lamivudine  and  abacavir  crossed  the 
placenta.  In  rats,  abacavir  demonstrated  a  potential  toxicity  to  the  developing  of  embryo  and  fœtus, 
however, no embryofoetal toxicity was observed in rabbits. Lamivudine was not teratogenic. In rats, 
abacavir  and  lamivudine  had  no  effect  on  male  or  female  fertility.  Neither  abacavir  nor  lamivudine 
were mutagenic in bacterial tests, but like many nucleoside analogues they show activity in the in vitro 
mammalian  tests  such  as  the  mouse  lymphoma  assay.  Lamivudine  did  not  show  any  carcinogenic 
potential but abacavir showed an increase in the incidence of malignant and non-malignant tumours in 
mice  and  rats.  With  respect  to  the  in  vitro  mitochondrial  toxicity,  no  synergetic  effects  due  to  the 
combination have been observed in comparison with abacavir and lamivudine as single agents. 
With  respect  to  toxicokinetics,  either  the  Cmax  or  the  AUC  values  of  both  abacavir  or  lamivudine 
reached  in  the  toxicology  studies  were  in  excess  to  those  expected  in  human  with  the  fixed  dose 
combination. Only in mice the Cmax of abacavir at the end of 6 months repeat-dose studies presented 
similar magnitude to the human expected Cmax, but in the carcinogenicity study in the same species an 
excess  of  2  or  more  could  be  obtained  at  the  end  of  the  study.  In  this  perspective,  the  individual 
studies can be considered as appropriate to support the individual non-clinical safety of abacavir and 
lamivudine at the doses included in the application. Interactions between abacavir and lamivudine are 
not expected on intracellular phosphorilation pathways, intestinal transport metabolism or excretion. 
Clinical  experience  with  the  administration  of  lamivudine  and  abacavir,  using  the two substances  in 
association  as  well  as  in  the  triple  fixed  dose  combination  of  abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine  is 
available, although there are no extensive experience using abacavir as single 600 mg daily dose.  
It was agreed that animal data with lamivudine and abacavir administered as fixed dose combination 
would not be expected to add any relevant information.   
On  this  basis,  and  considering  the  extensive  clinical  experience  with  the  association,  the  CHMP 
agreed that toxicological investigations with the combination were not necessary. This is also in line 
with the Note for Guidance on Fixed Combination Medicinal Products (CPMP/EWP/240/95). 
A concern was raised however for potential increased genotoxicity with combination antiretroviral 
treatment with NRTIs.  Indeed combination of zidovudine and didanosine have been reported to 
potentiate genetic damage in human cells in vitro [Meng, 2000] and in CD-1 mice in vivo [Bishop, 
2004]. The applicant undertook therefore to conduct an oral rat micronucleus study to evaluate 
whether co-administration of abacavir with lamivudine has the potential to synergistically enhance the 
in vivo clastogenicity of abacavir, the results of which will be submitted as part of the follow-up 
measures to be fulfilled post-authorisation. 
The information on the individual compounds relevant for the fixed combination have been mentioned 
in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

Part IV: Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
the  applicant  focused 
Since the two active substances of Kivexa have already been approved for the treatment of HIV in the 
the  demonstration  of 
EU, 
bioequivalence  between  the  fixed  dose  combination  of  abacavir/lamivudine  (600/300  mg)  and  the 
individual  compounds,  administered  separately  at 
the  same  dose  (study  CAL10001).  The 
pharmacokinetic  programme  was  also  supported  by  a  study  of  intracellular  pharmacokinetics  of  the 
major abacavir active intracellular metabolite, carbovir-triphosphate (study CNA10905).  
the  clinical  development  programme  on 
At the time of the submission of the application the 600 mg once daily regimen for abacavir was not 
yet  approved.  Therefore  the  clinical  programme  included  a  study  which  compared  abacavir  600  mg 
once  daily  versus  abacavir  300  mg  twice  daily,  when  used  in  combination with  lamivudine  300  mg 
once  daily  and  efavirenz  600  mg  once  daily  over  48  weeks  in  antiretroviral  naive  patients  (study 
CNA30021).  
Subsequently, the applicant further substantiated the dossier by providing preliminary 24 weeks data 
of  two  new  phase  III  studies  in  antiretroviral  experienced  patients  using  abacavir/lamivudine  as  the 
fixed dose combination: studies CAL 30001 and ESS 30008.  
In  terms  of  clinical  efficacy,  previous  data  had  included  an  assessment  of  the  efficacy  of  the  two 
actives  when  administered  concurrently  as  part  of  antiretroviral  regimens  since  the  original  clinical 
development of abacavir was mainly supported by studies involving these two nucleoside analogues 
within multitherapies (e.g. studies CNAAB 3003 and CNAAB 3005).  
Four clinical studies were submitted using the antiretroviral association with abacavir and lamivudine 
administered twice daily, however these were considered only as supportive considering that the fixed 
combination is only suitable for a once daily administration and therefore will not be summarised in 
this report (studies CNA30024, ESS40001, APV30001 and APV30002).  
The applicant claimed that all studies were performed according to Good Clinical Practices. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics profile of abacavir and lamivudine as individual compounds have already been 
assessed.  The  pharmacokinetic  programme  for  the  fixed  dose  combination  focused  therefore  on  the 
demonstration  of  the  bioequivalence  between  abacavir  600  mg/lamivudine  300  mg  fixed  dose 
combination  formulation  to  the  individual  compounds  administered  at  the  same  doses  (study 
CAL10001).  In  addition  a  study  aiming  at  characterising  the  intracellular  pharmacokinetics  of  the 
major abacavir intracellular metabolite, carbovir triphosphate, was provided to support the once daily 
regimen of abacavir (study CNA1095). 
A brief summary of the major pharmacokinetic parameters for each individual compound is presented 
for reference.

Abacavir 
Following oral administration, abacavir is rapidly and well absorbed. The mean time (tmax) to maximal 
serum concentrations of abacavir is about 1-2 hours and the absolute bioavailability is about 83 %. At 
therapeutic  dosages  (300 mg  twice  daily)  in  patients,  the  mean  (CV)  steady  state  Cmax  and  Cmin  of 
abacavir  in  plasma  are  approximately  3.0 µg/ml  (30 %),  and  0.01 µg/ml  (99  %),  respectively.  The 
mean (CV) AUC over a dosing interval of 12 hours is 6 µg.h/ml (29 %). Food delays absorption and 
decreased Cmax but does not affect overall plasma concentrations (AUC).  
Following intravenous administration, the apparent volume of distribution is about 0.8 l/kg, indicating 
that abacavir penetrates freely into body tissues. In vitro, abacavir binds only low to moderately (~ 49 
%) to human plasma proteins at therapeutic concentrations.  
Abacavir is primarily metabolised by the liver with approximately 2 % of the administered dose being 
renally  excreted  as  unchanged  compound.  The  primary  metabolism  pathways  are  by  alcohol 
dehydrogenase  and  by  glucuronidation  to  produce  the  5’-carboxylic  acid  and  5’-glucuronide  which 
account for about 66 % of the dose. These metabolites are excreted in the urine. The mean half-life of 
abacavir  is  about  1.5 hours.  Following  multiple  oral  doses  of  300  mg  twice  a  day,  there  is  no 
significant accumulation of abacavir. The metabolites and unchanged abacavir account for about 83% 
of the administered dose in the urine, the remaining being eliminated in the faeces. 
An  open-label  single  arm,  pharmacokinetic  study  (study  CNA10905)  was  conducted  to  characterise 
the pharmacokinetics profile of intracellular anabolite carbovir triphosphate following administration 
of an abacavir 300 mg BID containing regimen in HIV infected patients. This study demonstrated that 
in vivo carbovir-TP has a long half-life of 20.6 h. 
Lamivudine  
Lamivudine is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and the bioavailability of oral lamivudine 
in  adults  is  normally  between  80  and  85 %.    Following  oral  administration,  the  mean  time  (tmax)  to 
maximal serum concentrations (Cmax) is about 1 hour. At therapeutic dose of 150 mg twice daily, mean 
(CV) steady-state Cmax and Cmin of lamivudine in plasma are 1.2 µg/ml (24%) and 0.09 µg/ml (27%), 
respectively.    The  mean  (CV)  AUC  over  a  dosing  interval  of  12  hours  is  4.7  h.µg/ml  (18%).    At  a 
therapeutic dose of 300 mg once daily, the mean (CV) steady-state Cmax, Cmin and 24h AUC are 2.0 
µg/ml (26%), 0.04 µg/ml (34%) and 8.9 h.µg/ml (21%), respectively. Food delays tmax and a lowered 
Cmax  (decreased  by  47 %),  but  the  extent  (based  on  the  AUC)  of  lamivudine  absorbed  is  not 
influenced.   
From intravenous studies, the mean volume of distribution is 1.3 l/kg.   
Lamivudine  exhibits  linear  pharmacokinetics  over  the  therapeutic  dose  range  and  displays  limited 
binding to the major plasma protein albumin (< 16 % - 36 % to serum albumin in in vitro studies).  
The active moiety, intracellular lamivudine triphosphate, has a prolonged terminal half-life in the cell 
(16 to 19 hours) compared to the plasma lamivudine half-life (5 to 7 hours).   
Metabolism  is  a  minor  route  of  elimination  of  lamivudine.  It  is  predominately  cleared  by  renal 
excretion  as  unchanged  compound.  The  extent  of  hepatic  metabolism  is  very  low  (5  -  10%).  The 
observed  lamivudine  half-life  of  elimination  is  5  to  7  hours.  The  mean  systemic  clearance  is 
approximately 0.32 l/h/kg, with predominantly renal clearance (> 70 %) as unchanged compound via 
the organic cationic transport system.  
Bioequivalence 
Study CAL10001 was a single-center, open-label, randomised, single-dose, three-way crossover study 
aiming  at  evaluating  the  bioequivalence  of  the  combined  formulated  tablet  (600 mg/300 mg 
abacavir/lamivudine)  compared  to  the  individual  formulations  of  abacavir  (2  X  300  mg  tablets)  and 
lamivudine  (2  X  150 mg  tablets)  administered  concurrently.  The  effect  of food  on the absorption of 
the combined formulation compared to the individual formulations was also assessed.  
Thirty  healthy  adults  subjects  were  enrolled  (males  (87%)  -  females  (13%))  and  25  completed  the 
study.  The  reasons  for  premature  discontinuation  for  5  subjects are the following: 2 due  to protocol 
violations, 2 withdrew consent, and 1 withdrawn at the investigator's discretion.

Subjects received one of the three treatments, at each period in a randomised, balanced fashion, using 
a random code based on two 3 X 3 Latin squares. There was a washout period of 5 to 10 days between 
each dose. 
-  Treatment A = Fixed dose combination of abacavir/lamivudine (600 mg/300 mg) following an 
overnight fast 
-  Treatment  B  =  abacavir  2  x  300 mg  tablet  and  lamivudine  2  x  150  mg  tablet  sequentially 
following an overnight fast 
-  Treatment C = Fixed dose combination of abacavir/lamivudine (600 mg/300 mg) five minutes 
following a standardized breakfast 
Bioequivalence and food effects were assessed from Geometric Least Squares (GLS) mean ratios and 
associated 90% confidence intervals (CI) of primary pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax and AUC) for 
treatment  comparisons  using  standard  bioequivalence  criteria,  where  the  90  %  CI  of  the  GLS  mean 
ratio is within the range of 0.80-1.25. The analytical methods used were adequate and validated. 
Results 
The  results,  displayed  in  table  1,  demonstrated  that  in  a  fasted  state,  the  fixed  dose  combination 
provides  lamivudine  and  abacavir  exposures  equivalent  to  those  provided  with  the  individual 
formulations  given  sequentially  (90%  CI  for  the  ratio  of  treatment  A/treatment  B  of  AUC  and  Cmax 
comprised within the predefined hypothesis of bioequivalence (range of 0.80-1.25)).

As  it  has  been  previously  described  for  the  individual  formulations  of  lamivudine  and  abacavir,  the  
co-administration  of  food  resulted  in  a  delayed  Tmax  and  a  lower  Cmax,  significant  for  abacavir  (see 
Table 2). However, the abacavir and lamivudine exposures were not influenced by food: AUClast and 
AUC∞   remained  unchanged  whenever  the  fixed  dose  combination  of  abacavir/lamivudine  (600 
mg/300  mg)  was  administered  at  the  fasted  state  or  with  breakfast  (90%  CI  for  the  AUC  ratio 
treatment A/treatment C comprised within the predefined hypothesis of bioequivalence (range of 0.80-
1.25)). 
The fixed combination can therefore be taken with or without food as highlighted in the Summary of 
Product Characteristics.

Renal  impairment:  Whilst  no  dosage  adjustment  of  abacavir  is  necessary  in  patients  with  renal 
impairment,  a  dose  reduction  of  lamivudine  is  required  due  to  a  decreased  clearance.  Therefore  the 
fixed  combination  of  abacavir/lamivudine  is  not  recommended  for  use  in  patients  with  a  creatinine 
clearance < 50 ml/min. 
Hepatic  impairment:  The  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  lamivudine  is  not  significantly  affected  in 
patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment.  
For abacavir, in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5-6) receiving a single 600 
mg  dose,  there  was  a  mean  increase  of  1.89  fold  [1.32;  2.70]  in  the  abacavir  AUC,  and  1.58  [1.22; 
2.04] fold in the elimination half-life. No recommendation on dosage reduction is possible in patients 
with mild hepatic impairment due to substantial variability of abacavir exposure. No data are available 
in  patients  with  moderate  hepatic  impairment.  In  view  of  the  above,  the  fixed  combination  of 
abacavir/lamivudine can be used in patients with mild hepatic impairment but is not recommended in 
patients with moderate hepatic impairment unless judged necessary. In both cases, as mentioned in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics, a close monitoring is required, and if feasible,  a monitoring of 
abacavir  plasma  levels  is  recommended.  The  fixed  combination  is  contraindicated  in  patients  with 
severe hepatic impairment. 
Children: The fixed combination of abacavir/lamivudine is not recommended for treatment of children 
less than 12 years of age as the necessary dose adjustment cannot be made.  
• 
Interaction studies 
No  specific  study  has  been  performed  with  this  fixed  dose  combination  tablet,  however  no  new 
interactions compared to the ones already known with the individual compounds are expected. 
The information on the individual compounds relevant for the fixed combination has been mentioned 
in the Summary of Product Characteristics.  
Pharmacodynamics 
No data pertaining to the pharmacodynamics of the fixed combination of abacavir/lamivudine has 
been provided. 
The antiviral activity and mutation pattern of the two individual compounds has been well identified 
in vitro and in vivo. No specific virological data have been provided except substantial genotyping and 
phenotyping  analysis  performed  with  antiretroviral  naive  patients  receiving  abacavir/lamivudine  and 
efavirenz as a once daily in study CNA30021 (see section on clinical efficacy).

At  the  submission  of  the  application  there  was  no  specific  clinical  study  performed  to  support  the 
efficacy and safety of the fixed dose combination tablet.  
In  addition,  the  once  daily  dose  of  abacavir  was  not  approved.  The  demonstration  of  the  antiviral 
activity  of  the  fixed  combination  abacavir  with  lamivudine  as  a  once  daily  regimen  was  therefore 
mainly based on study CNA30021 which compared abacavir 600 mg once daily versus abacavir 300 
mg twice daily, when used in combination with lamivudine 300 mg once daily and efavirenz 600 mg 
once daily over 48 weeks in antiretroviral naive patients. 
Subsequently the applicant completed the clinical dossier by providing preliminary 24 weeks data of 
two  new  phase  III  studies  in  antiretroviral  experienced  patients  using  the  fixed  dose  combination 
(studies CAL 30001 and ESS 30008). 
• 
Main study(ies)  
Study CNA30021 
This was a randomised, double-blind, multicentre clinical trial comparing abacavir 600 mg once daily 
versus  abacavir  300  mg  twice  daily,  when  used  in  combination  with  lamivudine  300  mg  once  daily 
and efavirenz 600 mg once daily over 48 weeks in antiretroviral naive patients.  
Methods 
•  Study Participants  
Male  or  female  adults  ≥18  years  of  age  with  documented  HIV-1  infection  who  were  antiretroviral 
(ART) naïve (defined as less than 7 days of any approved or experimental ART) or had 14 days or less 
of zidovudine monotherapy exposure were eligible. Patients were required to have a screening plasma 
HIV-1  RNA  level  >  400  copies/ml  and  a  CD4+  cell  count  >50  cells/mm3  on  at  least  one  occasion 
within 21 days of study entry. 
•  Treatments 
Patients who permanently discontinued randomised (assigned) study treatment (abacavir once daily or 
abacavir  twice  daily)  due  to  an  adverse  event  (AE)  were  permitted  to  substitute  other  authorised 
antiretroviral medicinal products and continue in the study; for analysis purposes, these patients were 
considered  as  treatment  failures  at  the  time  of  switch.    Patients  could  substitute  other  authorised 
antiretroviral  medicinal  products  for  background  (non-assigned)  study  compounds  (lamivudine  or 
efavirenz)  due  to  an  AE  and  continue  in  the  study.  A  switch  of  background  study  agents  was  not 
considered a treatment failure; however, an intensification of study treatment by addition of a fourth 
active antiretroviral agent was defined as a treatment failure. 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  efficacy  measure  was  the  comparison  of  the  proportion  of  patients  with  plasma  HIV-1 
RNA  levels  <  50  copies/ml  at  Week  48  and  adjusted  by  the  randomisation  strata  (screening  plasma 
HIV-1 RNA < 100,000 copies/ml versus >100,000 copies/ml).  
The  analysis  for  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  based  on  the  Intent-To-Treat  (ITT)-Exposed 
Population, which included patients exposed to at least one dose of study treatment. The evaluation of 
non-inferiority was based on two-sided 95 % CI stratified by baseline HIV-1 RNA. A responder at 48 
weeks was defined as a patient who had achieved confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/ml and 
had  not  yet  lost  the  virological  response  by  Week  48  as  defined  by  the  time  to  loss  of  virological 
response (TLOVR) algorithm.  
•  Sample size and statistical methods 
15/29 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
A  total  of  730  subjects  with a 1:1 randomisation stratified by screening HIV-1 RNA would provide  
90  %  power  to  assess  the  non-inferiority  of  abacavir  once  daily  compared  with  the  standard  twice 
daily dose of abacavir at the 0.05 level of significance. This sample size calculation assumed identical 
50 % success rates in the treatment groups at 48 weeks.  Non-inferiority was defined as a two-sided  
95 % CI adjusted for randomisation strata that excluded differences as large as 12 % in the direction of 
inferiority of the abacavir once daily group. 
Results 
•  Patient disposition 
The population enrolled had a median age of 36 years old mainly, was mostly White (54 %) and male 
(81%).  The  mean  viral  load  at  baseline  was  of  4.91  (3.05-6.99)  log  copies/ml,  including  44  %  of 
patients  with  a  viral  load  >  100  000  copies/ml)  and  31%  with  a  CD4  cell  count  at  baseline  
< 200 cell/mm3 (mean CD4 cell count: 262 (21-918)). Within this treatment naïve patient population, 
20% (133/770) of the patients had symptomatic HIV-1 infection and only 7% (53/770) had AIDS. 
The  number  of  patients who  discontinued and the reasons  for discontinuation were  overall  balanced 
between the two groups as displayed in table 3.

Results  are  in  accordance  with  the  predefined  hypothesis  of  non-inferiority  between  both  daily 
regimens  (lower  limit  of  the  95  %  CI  of  the  difference  between  ABC  OD  and  BID  in  terms  of 
proportion of patients with Plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/ml at Week 48 greater than –12 %). 
The distribution of patients in both arms in the subcategory of viral load <100 000 copies/ml (50-
1000; 1000-10 000 and 10 000-100 000) was well balanced, which further substantiated the non-
inferiority demonstration between abacavir once and twice daily regimen. 
There was no significant difference in terms of CD4 cell count change from baseline between the once 
or twice daily regimen.  
The  virologic  failure  rate  or  failure  due  to  lack  of  efficacy  was  low  and  comparable  in  both  groups 
(abacavir  OD  group  10  %  (38/384)  compared  with  8%  (32/386)  in  the  abacavir  twice  daily  group). 
Genotype data at baseline and post-baseline were available for 31 patients with virological failure with 
viral loads > 500 copies/ml (16 in abacavir OD group and 15 in abacavir BID group).  
There  was  a  high  proportion  of  patients  with  any  treatment  emergent  mutations  in  both  groups: 
abacavir OD: 81% (13/16) and abacavir BID: 67% (10/15), p = 0.433. 
There was a trend towards  a higher  number  of NRTI emerging mutations  in the abacavir OD group 
compared with the abacavir BID group (11/16 (69 %) versus 5/15 (33 %), p = 0.0076).  
Among  the  patients  with  virus  harbouring  no  mutations  at  baseline,  7/11  (63%)  patients  in  the 
abacavir  OD  group  versus  3/13  (23%)  in  the  abacavir  BID  patients  presented  on-therapy  NRTI 
mutations.  Even  if  there  is  a  trend  in  favour  of  a  higher  rate  of  emergence  of  resistance  in  the  OD 
regimen, the sample size of the genotypic analysis warrants particular precaution in the interpretation 
of  the  data,  the  more  so  as  similar  virologic  suppression  was  observed  between  abacavir  once  and 
twice daily regimen. 
Although the results in term of percentage of patients with virological response were compatible with 
a non-inferiority margin, there was a concern about the potential loss of chance for patients in relation 
to the change in the daily regimen from twice to once daily. Therefore, the applicant was requested to 
discuss  what  represented  the  8.4%  in  the  ITT  analysis  in  term  of  fraction  of  the  efficacy  that  was 
expected to be contributed by abacavir in the tritherapy. In the absence of available bitherapy studies 
with  lamivudine  +  efavirenz  allowing  direct  evidence  of  the  contribution  of  abacavir  to  a  regimen 
containing abacavir, lamivudine, efavirenz, the applicant reviewed historical comparative data of triple

therapy  including  dual  NRTI  and  double  NRTI  therapy.  Given  the  evolution  of  HIV  treatment 
strategies,  this  indirect  approach  was  considered  valid.  According  to  this  analysis,  the  range  of 
treatment differences was approximately 30 – 60% for the various triple versus dual regimens, with an 
average benefit of triple therapy over double therapy of 45 %. Despite the inherent limitations in the 
historical comparisons especially in the evolving field of HIV infection, it appears that 8.4 % would 
account  for  approximately  20  %  (8.4/45),  of  the  overall  activity  (45  %  in  average)  expected  to  be 
provided  by  abacavir  within  a  triple  combination.  This  is  expected  to  be  counterbalanced  by  the 
potential improvement in term of adherence resulting from a simplified schedule regimen, especially 
when  considering  that  in  general  non-adherence  represents  a  critical  cause  of  failure  to  anti-HIV 
treatment.  
In terms of duration of response, a total of 163 and 162 patients were treated for at least 72 weeks in 
the  once  daily  and  twice  daily  groups  respectively.  Over  this  extended  follow-up,  the  efficacy  of 
abacavir OD was comparable to abacavir BID as shown by the a Kaplan Meier estimate based on the 
TLOVR  algorithm  and  on  review  of  the  proportions of patients with  undetectable viral load  at each 
timepoint. 
Study CAL 30001 
This  is  a  randomised,  open-label,  parallel,  multicenter  study  to  evaluate  treatment  with  fixed-dose 
combination  of  abacavir/lamivudine  (600 mg/300 mg)  once-daily  versus  abacavir  (300 mg)  twice 
daily and lamivudine (300 mg) once daily in combination with tenofovir (TDF) once-daily and a new 
protease  inhibitor  (PI)  or  non-nucleosidic  reverse  transcriptase  inhibitor  (NNRTI)  for  48  weeks  in 
antiretroviral (ART)-experienced HIV-1 infected patients. 
Methods 
•  Study Participants 
The  study  enrolled  male  or  non-pregnant  female  HIV-1  infected  adults  (≥  18  years)  who  are  ART 
experienced  but  TDF  naïve  patients  currently  receiving  a  stable  regimen  containing  3  NRTIs,  or  2 
NRTIs + 1 PI or 2 NRTIs + 1 NNRTI for at least 3 months and having ≤ 3 NRTI-associated mutations 
(including  M184V),  but  without  K65R,  L74V,  69S  insertion,  Q151M,  M41L,  L210W,  OR  ≥  3 
thymidine analogues mutations (TAMs).  
Patients were required to have HIV-1 RNA level > 1000 copies/ml and CD4 cell count > 50 cells/mm3 
on at least one occasion within 21 days of study entry. 
•  Treatments 
Patients were stratified at baseline according to plasma HIV-1 RNA level (< 5000 copies/ml and ≥ 
5000 copies/ml) and genotype (with or without mutation M184V). 
Patients  who  either  met  the  definition  of  virologic  failure  or  had  an  insufficient  virologic  response 
according  to  the  investigator’s  opinion  or  had  an  adverse  event  that  required  permanent 
discontinuation of any of the study agents could change their study regimen during the study. 
Patients  had  the  choice  either  to  continue  randomised  study  agents  and  continue  background  ARV 
agents,  or  to  continue  randomised  study  agents  and  substitute  the  background  PI  or  NNRTI  with 
another,  or  to  permanently  discontinue  randomised  study  agents  and  substitute  with  any  other 
authorised ARV agents. Patients who switched to the last option were considered as treatment failure 
at the time of change.

•  Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy measure was to test the non-inferiority of abacavir in a fixed dose combination 
(FDC) tablet administered OD versus abacavir administered BID with lamivudine OD over 24 and 48 
weeks, based on the comparison of plasma HIV-1 RNA average area under the plasma HIV-1 RNA 
curve minus baseline (AAUCMB) in the two arms through week 24 and adjusted by the randomised 
strata.  
•  Sample size and statistical methods 
A sample size of 83 patients per arm with a 1.1 allocation stratified by screening plasma HIV-1 RNA 
and  genotype  was  required  to  test  the  non-inferiority  between  the  two  treatment  groups  for 
approximately  90%  power  and  α  =  0.05  in  the  two-sided  confidence  interval.  This  sample  size 
calculation assumed that the expected difference in the median time-weighted change in plasma HIV-
1-RNA defined as AAUCMB was 0.0 log10 copies/ml and that the common standard deviation was 
0.80 log10 copies/ml. The non-inferiority margin was defined as 0.4 log10 copies/ml in the direction 
of inferiority of the FDC OD group. 
Results 
•  Patient disposition 
A  total  of  186  patients  were  enrolled  and  randomised.  The  demographic  characteristics  were  well-
balanced  between  the  two  arms.  Patients  included  were  approximately  38  years  old,  mainly  White 
(66%) and male (76%). 
At baseline there was an imbalance between both arms with respect to median viral load (3.92 log10 
copies/ml in OD arm versus 4.22 in the BID). In terms of previous medications, 63 % patients in the 
OD arm and 53 % in the BID have already been treated with lamivudine prior to the study. Abacavir 
containing regimens were used prior to study entry in 12 (13 %) and 15 (17 %) patients in the OD and 
BID arms respectively.  
In  terms  of  background  therapy  the  most  commonly  used  4th  product  was  lopinavir/ritonavir  and 
efavirenz.

Results are in accordance with the predefined hypothesis of non-inferiority (upper limit of the 95 % CI 
of  the  difference  in  terms  of  AAUCMB  between  both  treatment  arms  being  inferior  to  0.4  log10 
copies/ml). This was also seen in the overall analyses on the as-treated population.  
Nevertheless,  this  study  has  some  limitations  and  therefore  the  results  should  be  interpreted  with 
caution. Firstly, the population enrolled was likely in second or third line therapy when referring to the 
high rate (60%) of patients with no TAMs mutation at baseline. Moreover, the patients enrolled were 
receiving  a  quadritherapy  whereas,  in  clinical  practice,  the  re-sort  to  a  quadritherapy  would  be 
particularly unlikely in non heavily pretreated patients. Secondly the use of AAUCMB as a primary 
endpoint, even if acceptable, is not an optimal endpoint as compared to the more clinically meaningful 
percentage of patients with undetectable viral load. Finally there was a noticeable imbalance in the rate 
of discontinuation (17% versus 7% respectively in the BID and OD regimens) and in term of baseline 
viral load (lower viral load in the OD arm).  
In  term  of  adherence,  there  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  between  groups  during  the 
randomised  follow-up  period  in  term  of  total  satisfaction  scores.  There  was  a  trend  toward  greater 
adherence with the FDC over the control arm (pill count overall adherence 55 % versus 37 %).

Methods 
•  Study participants 
This study enrolled male or non-pregnant female HIV-1 infected adults (≥18 years), treated with an 
initial ARV regimen containing abacavir 300 mg BID and lamivudine 150 mg BID in combination 
with either a PI or NNRTI for ≥ 24 weeks were eligible. 
Patients were required to have plasma HIV-1 RNA < 400 copies/ml for 3 months immediately 
preceding screening and at study entry and CD4+ cell count ≥ 50 cells/mm3. 
•  Treatment 
Patients were stratified according to PI or NNRTI use at entry and randomised 1:1. 
•  Outcome/endpoints 
The primary objective is to establish that abacavir/lamivudine FDC administered OD is virologically 
non-inferior  to  the  individual  tablets  administered  BID  (proportion  of  non  virologic  failures 
(responders).  Virologic  failure  was  defined  as  plasma  HIV-1  RNA  ≥  1265  copies/ml  (0.5  log10 
copies/ml  increase  over  400  copies/ml)  on  two  consecutive  occasions,  at  least  2-4  weeks  apart. 
Patients  who  did  not  have  two  consecutive  plasma  HIV-1  RNA  values  ≥  1265  copies/ml  were 
considered responders or “non-virologic failures” for the purposes of the primary endpoint.

A  total  of  240  patients  (120  per  treatment  group)  would  provide  at  least  80%  power  (α=0.05)  to 
establish  the  non-inferiority  via  a  lower  95 %  confidence  bound  (equivalent  to  a  two  sided  90% 
confidence  interval)  for  the  difference  in  proportions  of  the  two  treatment  groups.  This  sample  size 
calculation  assumes  a  0.85  success  rate  for  each  treatment  group  at  48  weeks  and  a  non-inferiority 
margin of –12% for the OD treatment group minus BID treatment group difference. 
Results 
•  Patients disposition 
A  total  of  260  were  enrolled  and  randomised.  Patients  were  approximately  38  years  old  and  the 
majority was male (82%). The population consisted mainly in asymptomatic well-controlled patients 
(80  %).  The  mean  baseline  HIV  RNA  was  1.73  log10  copies/ml  (±  0.216)  and  the  mean  CD4  cell 
counts  was  554  cells/mm3  (89-1638).  Patients  were  mainly  treated  with  NNRTI  (65  %)  with 
approximately 60% consisting in efavirenz containing HAART. Ritonavir and fosamprenavir were the 
most frequent combined protease inhibitor in both groups (20% and 16% in the abacavir + lamivudine 
arm, respectively, and 20 % and 18 % in the FDC OD arm, respectively). 
Patients  were  well  balanced  in  term  of  prior  exposure  to  abacavir  (the  median  time  of  exposure  to 
abacavir and lamivudine prior to study entry was 22 and 23 months for the abacavir + lamivudine BID 
and FDC OD treatment groups respectively).

Clinical safety 
The  safety  of  both  abacavir  and  lamivudine  has  been  established  in  adults  and  children  in  multiple 
controlled clinical trials and corroborated by several years of post-marketing experience. 
More than 36,700 subjects have been exposed to abacavir containing products in clinical trials and the 
worldwide  estimated  cumulative  patient  exposure  to  abacavir  containing  products,  since  first 
marketing approval is estimated to be approximately 508,958 patient-years of treatment up to the end 
of December 2003.  
Approximately  2.64  million  patient-years  of  post-marketing  experience  with  lamivudine  containing 
products authorised to treat HIV infection have been generated during the past 7 years. 
The evaluation of the safety profile of abacavir/lamivudine as fixed dose combination tablet focused in 
assessing whether: 
• 
the once daily dose of abacavir (600 mg) had a similar safety profile to twice daily dose (2 x 300 
mg); 
22/29 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
the  incidence  and/or  presentation  of  abacavir  hypersensitivity  was  not  altered  by  dosing  it  once 
daily instead of twice daily; 
abacavir and lamivudine provided an NRTI backbone with an acceptable safety profile when used 
with a variety of antiretrovirals from all three ART classes. 
Therefore the safety data derived mainly from the study CNA30021 which provides a minimum of 48-
week  data  on  the  safety  of  abacavir  600  mg  OD  or  300  mg  BID  with  lamivudine  300  mg  OD.  In 
addition, data from five studies have been provided to support the safety and tolerability of abacavir 
and lamivudine used together as a backbone (CNA30024, EPV40001 using OD regimen, ESS40001, 
APV30001, and APV30002). Relevant safety data can also be found in historical studies CNAA2001, 
CNAB2002 and CNAB3001 where up to 600 mg of abacavir was administered twice or three times 
daily. 
Finally,  preliminary  24  weeks  data  have  also  been  submitted  from  the  two  Phase  III  trials  in 
antiretroviral experienced patients using the fixed dose combination. 
Study CNA30021 
The incidence of AES, related to treatment or not, was similar in both treatment groups (incidence of 
Grade 2 to 4 adverse events ABC OD 70% vs ABC BID 72%).  Psychiatric disorders (ABC OD : 
35 % vs ABC BID : 36%), nervous system disorders (ABC OD : 32% vs ABC BID : 28%) and 
gastrointestinal disorders (ABC OD : 30% vs ABC BID : 29%) were the most frequent treatment-
related adverse events. Psychiatric and nervous system disorders were more likely due to efavirenz. 
No new safety concerns were therefore identified with abacavir once daily dose. 
With  regard  to  hypersensitivity  reactions,  which  is  the  most  significant  adverse  reaction  associated 
with abacavir there was no sign of increased risk with ABC 600 mg administered once daily, although 
there was a trend for higher rate of hypersensitivity reaction in the OD group (36/384; 9%) versus BID 
group (28/386; 7 %). 
Study CAL30001 
The  incidences  of  adverse  reactions  are  generally  comparable  between  treatment  groups  (47%  of 
patients  in  the  FDC  OD  group and  45 % in the  ABC  BID +  LAM  OD  group)  with the  exception  of 
fatigue and hypersensitivity reaction which were reported in a higher number of patients in the FDC 
OD group than in the ABC BID + LAM OD group, as shown in the table 10:

There were more patients in the FDC OD group (11%) than in the ABC BID + LAM OD group (6%) 
who had adverse events leading to permanent discontinuation of treatment. For both groups, the most 
commonly reported adverse event that resulted in the permanent discontinuation was hypersensitivity, 
all related to ABC. 
23/29 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Serious adverse events, none fatal, were reported in 14% of subjects in the FDC OD group and 8% in 
the ABC BID + LAM OD group. This difference was driven mainly by hypersensitivity. 
A total of nine patients (10%) in the FDC OD group experienced a  serious adverse reaction compared 
with four (4%) in the ABC BID + LAM OD group. The only other drug-related serious adverse event 
reported was increased blood creatinine phosphokinase, which was reported in one patient only in the 
FDC OD group. 
Study ESS30008 
The number of patients experiencing at least one adverse reaction was higher in the FDC OD group in 
comparison with the abacavir + lamivudine BID group [(15/130 (12 %) versus 6/130 (5 %)], but this 
might be related to the open label design, with investigators more likely notifying AEs in a treatment 
arm  consisting  in  a  new  schedule  regimen  with  a  new  fixed  combination.  There  was  no  report  of 
hypersensitivity reactions.  
Hypersensitivity reaction 
Hypersensitivity  reaction  is  the  key  safety  concern  associated  with  abacavir.  It  is  a  recognisable 
syndrome occurring in approximately 5 % of patients and is characterised by the presence of multiple 
symptoms that indicated involvement of several organs or systems. Rechallenge can be more severe 
and in some cases life-threatening or fatal. 
A concern was raised nevertheless by the CHMP as in the pivotal study CNA 30021, the incidence of 
cases of hypersensitivity reaction with abacavir once daily were higher (9%) than expected (5 % of 
subjects exposed to abacavir in clinical trials according to cumulative data from the last PSUR of 
abacavir and in line with the current SPC).  
A new abacavir hypersensitivity reaction case report form (HSR CRF) module was used. However in 
study CAL 30001 in antiretroviral experienced patients, the rate of HSR was higher in the OD regimen 
(9 %) of abacavir than the BID regimen (4 %). Even if it cannot be ruled out that some factors might 
have  artificially  led  to  such  finding  (e.g  higher  rate  of  combined  NNRTI  in  the  abacavir  OD  arm, 
known confusion factor for HSR diagnosis, open-label design) the CHMP agreed that this should be 
further investigated (especially in term of biological plausibility). No HSR was reported in ESS30008 
which  could  be  explained  by  the  fact  that  the  patients  were  treated  for  at  least  24  weeks  prior  to 
inclusion (of note, median time for occurrence of HSR is 11 days). It is assumed that treated patients 
who had experienced HSR were not present at the time of inclusion. 
The applicant addressed this concern showing that when data are pooled from all studies that used the 
HSR  CRF  module,  the  incidences  of  HSR  are  8.1%  and  7.6%  for  once  and  twice  daily  dosing 
respectively. In addition the combination with efavirenz might have also contributed to the increased 
rate of HSR observed in these studies (rash induced by efavirenz could have been a confusion factor in 
the  HSR  diagnosis).  This  issue  is  under  assessment  to  revise  the  general  description  of  HSR  in  the 
SPC  of  medicinal  products  containing  abacavir.  Moreover,  the  applicant  provided  complementary 
analysis showing that the difference observed is much more likely the result of an artificial finding in a 
small open label study. An updated multivariable risk factor analysis provided evidence that ABC OD 
was not a predictor of HSR. As a matter of fact, as underlined in published literature (Naisbitt and al; 
2003) ABC HSR reaction has typical clinical features of an immune-mediated reaction considered as 
dose-independent.  More  recently,  a  strong  association  has  been  shown  between  ABC  HSR  and 
haplotype including HLA-B57.

When  developing  the  fixed  dose  combination  of  abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine,  the  applicant 
conducted  an  interaction  study  to  evaluate  the  pharmacokinetics  of  abacavir  (600  mg),  lamivudine 
(150 mg) and zidovudine (300 mg) when each compound was given alone and when any two or three 
compounds were given concurrently. The results of this study together with the clinical experience of 
abacavir  in  association  with  lamivudine  showed  that  there  is  no  clinically  significant  interaction 
between abacavir and lamivudine. In addition due the different mechanisms of elimination, there is no 
rationale for pharmacokinetic interaction. 
There  are  no  pharmacokinetics  data  with  the  fixed  combination.  The  pharmacokinetic  profile  of 
abacavir  and  lamivudine,  as  individual  compounds  have  already  been  assessed  in  the  context  of  the 
development of the single agents. 
As  a  prerequisite  to  support  this  fixed  dose  combination,  study  CAL10001  established  the 
bioequivalence  between  the  fixed  dose  combination  tablet  of  abacavir/lamivudine  (600  mg/300  mg) 
and the same doses of abacavir and lamivudine administered as separate formulations. 
In  view  of  these  data,  no  further  pharmacokinetic  study  with  the  fixed  combination  was  considered 
necessary. The pharmacokinetics information on the individual components which are relevant for the 
fixed  dose  combination  have  been  included  in  the  SPC.  However  to  further  support  the  once  daily 
regimen of ABC the applicant undertook to provide post-authorisation comparative pharmacokinetics 
data between abacavir OD and BID. In addition the study will address the issue of the potential gender 
difference  in  the  phosphorylation  capacity,  as  reported  in  for  several  NRTIs  in  recent  publications 
(Anderson et.al AIDS 2003; 17:2159-2168 Antiviral dynamics and sex differences of zidovudine and 
lamivudine  triphosphate  concentrations  in  HIV-infected  individuals,  Harris  et  al  AIDS  2002;  16: 
1196-1197 Intracellular carbovir-triphosphate levels in patients taking abacavir once a day). 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The  efficacy  of  lamivudine  and  abacavir  as  individual  compounds  have  already  been  assessed  and 
authorised, including data on their use in association together with other antiretroviral agents. 
At  the  time  of  the  submission  of  the  application  the  once  daily  regimen  for  abacavir  was  not  yet 
authorised  and  therefore  clinical  data  were  submitted  to  support  this  regimen  since  the  fixed 
combination is intended for once daily dose only. 
The  pivotal  randomised  double  blind  study  CNA  30021  compared  abacavir once (n=384) and  twice 
daily (n=386) regimen within triple combination involving lamivudine and efavirenz in antiretroviral 
naïve  patients.  The  primary  endpoint  of  this  study  was  the  proportion  of  patients  with  undetectable 
viral load using  the  Time to Lost of Virological Response (TLOVR) algorithm (composite of safety 
and  antiviral  activity).  At  48  weeks,  in  the  ITT  exposed  population,  the  proportion  of  patients  with 
virological  response  was  of  66%  in  the  OD  regimen  versus  68  %  in  the  BID  regimen  of  abacavir 
[point  estimate  for  treatment  differences  –1.7;  95 %  CI  of  the  difference  in  the  percentages  (-8.4%; 
4.9%)] and 87 % versus 86 % respectively for the OD and BID regimens of abacavir in the As treated 
population [95 % CI of the difference in the percentages (-5.4; 6.2%)]. These results were compatible 
with  the  predefined  12%  non-inferiority  margin  and  the  applicant  presented  confirmatory  analyses 
demonstrating that the potential difference is sufficiently small to draw an overall conclusion of non-
inferiority of abacavir OD over abacavir BID. 
The fact that the clinical development of abacavir OD and thereby the fixed combination only targeted 
the population of antiretroviral naïve patients was also perceived as a concern by the CHMP. 
The  applicant  subsequently  submitted  the  preliminary  data  of  two  new  phase  III  studies  in 
antiretroviral experienced patients (CAL 30001 and ESS 30008) using the fixed dose combination. 
In  study  CAL  30001,  preliminary  data  at  24  weeks  showed  that  the  fixed  combination 
abacavir/lamivudine  once  daily  was  non-inferior  to  the  abacavir  BID  +  lamivudine  OD  group. 
However  due  to  the  limitations  of  the  studies  in  terms  of  design,  patients  disposal  as  previously 
highlighted,  results  should  be  taken  with  caution.  In  study  ESS30008  preliminary  data  at  24  weeks 
showed the non-inferiority between patients who switched to the fixed dose combination or continued 
their  treatment  with  abacavir  BID  and  lamivudine  taken  concurrently  as  part  of  an  initial  triple 
therapy. 
The  applicant  undertook  to  submit  the  final  reports  from  these  studies  as  part  of  the  follow-up 
measures to be fulfilled post-authorisation. 
25/29 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
The applicant undertook also to provide all comparative resistance data between abacavir OD and BID 
regimen as part of the follow-up measures to be fulfilled post-authorisation. 
The  safety  profile  of  abacavir  and  lamivudine  as  individual  components  have  already  been  well 
defined.  The  study  CNA30021  did  not  reveal  any  increased  risk  with  the  OD  regimen  of  abacavir 
versus  BID,  although  there  was  a  trend  for  higher  rate  of  hypersensitivity  reaction  in  the  OD  group 
(9%)  versus  BID  group  (7  %).  A  concern  was  raised  nevertheless  as  in  this  study,  the  incidence  of 
cases  of  hypersensitivity  reaction  were  slightly  higher  than  expected  (5 %  of  subjects  exposed  to 
abacavir in clinical trials according to cumulative data from the last PSUR of abacavir and in line with 
the current SPC). This trend was also seen in study CAL 30001 in antiretroviral experienced patients, 
where the rate of HSR was higher in the OD regimen (9 %) of abacavir than the BID regimen (4 %). 
This raised a concern over a potential deterioration of the safety profile associated with a once daily 
regimen  of  abacavir,  which  was  especially  critical  since  the  benefit  in  terms  of  adherence  was  felt 
insufficiently substantiated. The applicant was therefore requested to discuss the biological plausibility 
of an increased risk of HSR associated with a change in the dosing regimen of abacavir. The applicant 
performed a retrospective analysis which supported that the strongest predictor for reporting an ABC 
HSR was the use of a new abacavir case report form module, as HSR is more readily identified by the 
study  investigator.  In  addition  the  applicant  provided  complementary  analysis  showing  that  the 
difference observed is much more likely the result of an artificial finding in a small open label study 
since ABC dosing frequency (OD versus BID) is not risk factor for HSR.  
A  concern  was  raised  in  term  of  adherence.  Data from  all these studies suggest that ABC OD is no 
more sensitive to missed doses than ABC BID. In addition, there was a trend in CAL30001 to suggest 
that  ABC/LAM  FDC  OD  may  improve  adherence  relative  to  ABC  BID  +  LAM  and  that  this  trend 
may  lead  to  some  improvements  in  efficacy.  Although  it  was  poorly  substantiated  (not  explored  in 
study performed in antiretroviral naïve patients, conflicting results observed in other studies…), it has 
to be recognized that such a benefit is difficult to capture within isolated studies because of the large 
sample  size  that  is  required.  In  addition  it  has  been  demonstrated  within  the  published  scientific 
literature accumulated so far that a reduction of the pill burden and/or of frequency of intake could be 
translated into improved adherence.

Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation 
Quality 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. There are 
no unresolved quality issues, which have a negative impact on the Benefit Risk balance of the product. 
Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology 
Abacavir  and  lamivudine  are  nucleoside  reverse  transcriptase  inhibitors  that  have  been  shown  to  be 
effective.  No  specific  pharmacodynamic,  pharmacokinetic  and  toxicological  studies  have  been 
performed  with  the  fixed  dose  combination.  The  safety  of  abacavir  and  lamivudine  has  been 
investigated  separately  during  extensive  preclinical  programmes  and  the  applicant  provided  an 
overview of the comprehensive information gathered on each active substance.  
With respect to toxicokinetics, either the Cmax or the AUC values reached in the toxicology studies of 
both  abacavir  or  lamivudine  were  in  excess  to  those  expected  in  human  with  the  fixed  dose 
combination. Only in mice the Cmax of abacavir at the end of 6 months repeat-dose studies presented 
similar magnitude to the human expected Cmax, but in the carcinogenicity study in the same species an 
excess  of  2  or  more  could  be  obtained  at  the  end  of  the  study.  In  this  perspective,  the  individual 
studies can be considered as appropriate to support the individual non-clinical safety of abacavir and 
lamivudine at the doses included in the application. Interactions between abacavir and lamivudine are 
not expected on intracellular phosphorilation pathways, intestinal transport metabolism or excretion.

Clinical  experience  with  the  administration  of  lamivudine  and  abacavir,  using  the two substances  in 
association  as  well  as  in  the  triple  fixed  dose  combination  of  abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine  is 
available, although there are no extensive experience using abacavir as single 600 mg daily dose.  
It was agreed that animal data with lamivudine and abacavir administered as fixed dose combination 
would not be expected to add any relevant information.   
Overall  the  CHMP  agreed  that  the  toxicological  data  available  were  sufficient  and  that  further 
toxicological  investigations  with  the  fixed  combination  were  not  warranted.  This  is  in  line  with  the 
CHMP Note for Guidance on Fixed Combination Medicinal Products (CHMP/EWP/240/95). 
Because  the  combination  of  zidovudine  and  didanosine  have  been  reported  to  potentiate  genetic 
damage in human cells in vitro [Meng, 2000] and in CD-1 mice in vivo [Bishop, 2004], the applicant 
will conduct an oral  rat micronucleus study.   This study will evaluate whether co-administration of 
abacavir  with  lamivudine  has  the  potential  to  synergistically  enhance  the  in  vivo  clastogenicity  of 
abacavir,  the  results  will  be  submitted  as  part  of  the  follow-up  measures  to  be  fulfilled  post-
authorisation. 
The information on the individual compounds relevant for the fixed combination have been mentioned 
in the Summary of Product Characteristics.  
Efficacy 
Pharmacokinetics 
The  pharmacokinetics  profile  of  the  fixed  combination  has  not  been  assessed  however  the 
pharmacokinetic  profile  of  abacavir  and  lamivudine  have  already  been  assessed  as  individual 
compounds. There is no clinically significant interaction between abacavir and lamivudine.  
As  a  prerequisite  to  support  this  fixed  dose  combination,  study  CAL10001  established  the 
bioequivalence  between  the  fixed  dose  combination  tablet  of  abacavir/lamivudine  (600  mg/300  mg) 
and same dose of abacavir and lamivudine administered as separate tablets. 
In  view  of  these  data,  no  further  pharmacokinetic  study  with  the  fixed  combination  was  considered 
necessary. The pharmacokinetics information on the individual components which are relevant for the 
fixed dose combination has been included in the Summary of Product Characteristic. 
However  to  further  support  the  once  daily  regimen  of  abacavir  the  applicant  undertook  to  provide 
post-authorisation comparative pharmacokinetics data between abacavir OD and BID.  
Clinical efficacy 
The  efficacy  of  lamivudine  and  abacavir  as  individual  compounds  have  already  been  assessed, 
including data on their use in association together with other antiretroviral agents. 
At the time of the submission of the application however the once daily regimen for abacavir was not 
yet  authorised  and  therefore  clinical  data  were  submitted  to  support  this  regimen  as  the  fixed 
combination is intended for once daily dose only. 
The  pivotal  randomised  double  blind  study  CNA  30021  compared  abacavir once (n=384) and  twice 
daily (n=386) regimen within triple combination involving lamivudine and efavirenz in antiretroviral 
naïve patients. At 48 weeks, in the ITT exposed population, the proportion of patients with virological 
response based on plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml was 66% in the OD regimen versus 68 % in the 
BID  regimen  [95 %  CI  of  the  difference  in  the  percentages  (-8.4%;  4.9%)].  In  the  As  treated 
population the proportion accounted for 87 % versus 86 % respectively for the OD and BID regimens 
of abacavir [95 % CI of the difference in the percentages (-5.4; 6.2%)]. These results were compatible 
with  the  predefined  12%  non  inferiority  margin  and  the  applicant  presented  confirmatory  analyses 
demonstrating that the potential difference is sufficiently small to draw an overall conclusion of non-
inferiority of abacavir OD over abacavir BID.

The fact that the clinical development of abacavir OD and thereby the fixed combination only targeted 
the  population  of  antiretroviral  naïve  patients  was  also  perceived  as  a  concern.  The  applicant 
subsequently  submitted  the  preliminary  24  weeks  data  of  two  new  phase  III studies in antiretroviral 
experienced  patients  (CAL  30001  and  ESS  30008)  using  the  fixed  dose  combination.  In  study 
CAL3001, at 24 weeks the fixed combination abacavir/lamivudine once daily was non-inferior to the 
abacavir BID + lamivudine OD group. In ESS 30008, at 24 weeks there was non-inferiority between 
patients  who  switched  to  the  fixed  dose  combination  or  patients who continued their treatment with 
abacavir  BID  and  lamivudine  taken  concurrently  as  part  of  an  initial  triple  therapy.  The  applicant 
undertook  to  submit  the  final  reports  from  these  studies  as  part  of  the  follow-up  measures  to  be 
fulfilled  post-authorisation  to  confirm  these  preliminary  results.The  applicant  undertook  also  to 
provide all long-term data (> 48 weeks) of abacavir once daily from studies in antiretroviral naïve and 
experienced patients as well as comparative resistance data between abacavir OD and BID regimen as 
part of as part of the follow-up measures to be fulfilled post-authorisation. 
A  concern  was  raised  in  term  of  adherence.  Although  it  was  poorly  substantiated  (not  explored  in 
study performed in antiretroviral naïve patients, conflicting results observed in other studies…), it has 
to be recognized that such a benefit is difficult to capture within isolated studies because of the large 
sample  size  that  is  required.  In  addition  it  has  been  demonstrated  within  the  published  scientific 
literature accumulated so far that a reduction of the pill burden and/or of frequency of intake could be 
translated into improved adherence.   
Clinical safety 
The  safety  profile  of  abacavir  and  lamivudine  as  individual  components  have  already  been  well 
defined. The adverse reactions reported with Kivexa were consistent with the known safety profiles of 
abacavir and lamivudine given separately. Hypersensitivity reaction is a key safety concern associated 
with  abacavir.  In  clinical  studies,  approximately  5  %  of  patients  receiving  abacavir  developed  a 
hypersensitivity reaction.Analyses showed that HSR risk is not linked to Cmax or dose. Indeed abacavir 
HSR  is  very  likely  to  be  classified  among  immune-mediated  reactions  considered  as  dose-
independent. The risk factor analyses of HSR showing that ABC dosing frequency (OD versus BID) is 
not  a  risk  factor  further  support  this  conclusion.  Therefore,  the  higher  frequency  of  HSR  observed 
with  the  OD  regimen  of  abacavir  in  the  CAL  30001  study  especially,  seems  rather  the  result  of  an 
artificial  finding  in  a  small  open  label  study.  Moreover,  when  pooling  the  results  of  the  available 
studies comparing abacavir OD and BID within multitherapies, the HSR incidences were comparable. 
The applicant is committed to pursue the educational programme initiated since the original marketing 
authorisation of abacavir to ensure a safe use of the abacavir containing products as well as to pursue 
to closely monitor of HSR post-authorisation.  
Benefit/risk assessment 
Given  the  prior  approval  of  the  two  active  substances  and  the  fact  that  there  is  no  evidence  of  a 
pharmacodynamic  or  pharmacokinetic  interaction  that  might  be  detrimental  for  patients  safety  and 
efficacy,  the  combination  tablet  seems  to  represent  a  benefit  in  terms  of  convenience  for  selected 
patients.  However,  as  a  mandatory  prerequisite  to  support  this  fixed  combination,  the  applicant  has 
performed  a  single  dose  bioequivalence  study  demonstrating  that  the  fixed  dose  combination  of 
abacavir/lamivudine (600/300 mg) provides an equivalent lamivudine and abacavir exposures as both 
substances administered separately. 
Overall, considering that:  
•  There are no major concern raised on the quality and non clinical aspects of the dossier 
submitted to support the approval of this fixed combination,  
•  The  bioequivalence  has  been  demonstrated  between  both  medicinal  products  used 
separately or in the fixed combination 
•  The pivotal study CNA 30021 has provided efficacy and safety data with abacavir and 
lamivudine as a once daily regimen in antiretroviral naïve patients, 
•  Preliminary  data  in  antiretroviral  experienced  patients  indicate  non-inferiority  of  the 
fixed dose combination versus the abacavir BID plus lamivudine.

•  There is no deterioration of the safety profile (increased risk of HSR) with a change in 
the dosing regimen of abacavir. 
•  The  applicant  is  committed  to  pursue  the  educational  programme  initiated  since  the 
original  Marketing  Authorisation  of  abacavir  to  ensure  a  safe  use  of  the  abacavir 
containing  products  and  to  pursue  its  close  monitoring  of  HSR  post-authorisation 
(HSR being the unique significant limiting factor of the use of abacavir).  
•  Simplified  schedule  regimens  are  especially  critical  when  considering  that  HIV 
infection has become a chronic disease and that non-adherence negatively impacts on 
response to treatment. Abacavir/lamivudine encompassing not only the advantage of a 
fixed dose combination but also of a once daily regimen has the potential to simplify 
the daily life of patients.

Recommendation 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by 
consensus that the benefit/risk ratio of Kivexa in the treatment of HIV infection was favourable and 
therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation in the following indication: 
“Kivexa is a fixed-dose combination of two nucleoside analogues (abacavir and lamivudine). 
It is indicated in antiretroviral combination therapy for the treatment of Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age. 
The demonstration of the benefit of the combination abacavir/lamivudine as a once daily 
regimen in antiretroviral therapy, is mainly based on results of one study performed in 
primarily asymptomatic treatment-naïve adult patients.”

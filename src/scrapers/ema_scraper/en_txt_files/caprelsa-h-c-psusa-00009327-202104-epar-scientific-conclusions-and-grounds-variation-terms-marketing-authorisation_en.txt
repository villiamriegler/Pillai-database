Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for vandetanib, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data regarding vandetanib including non-clinical data suggesting that vandetanib 
slows wound healing in an animal model and clinical data, mainly 23 cases in connection with an 
abnormal healing including 5 cases occurring in patients with surgical wounds and in light of a potential 
mechanism of action for drugs inhibiting VEGF pathway and a potential class effect, the PRAC 
concluded that the product information for vandetanib should be updated to reflect the risk of wound 
healing complications. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for vandetanib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing vandetanib is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

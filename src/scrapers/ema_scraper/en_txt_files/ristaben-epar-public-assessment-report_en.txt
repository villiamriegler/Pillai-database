1.    BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE PROCEDURE 
1.1 
Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd. submitted on 2 October 2009  an application for Marketing 
Authorisation  to  the  European  Medicines  Agency  for  Ristaben,  through  the  centralised  procedure 
under Article 3 (2) (a) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised  procedure 
was agreed upon by the CHMP on 23 July 2009. 
The  legal  basis  for  this  application  refers  to  Article  10(c)  of  Directive  2001/83/EC,  as  amended  – 
relating  to  informed  consent  from  a  marketing  authorisation  holder  Merck  Sharp  &  Dohme  Limited 
for  an  authorised  medicinal  product  Januvia  (EU/1/07/383/001-018).  The  applicant  Merck  Sharp  & 
Dohme  Ltd.  previously  obtained  a  Marketing  Authorization  for  the  multiple  application  Xelevia 
(EU/1/07/382/001-018) on 21 March 2007 and Tesavel (EU/1/07/435/001-018) on 11 January 2008.  
The  application  submitted  is  a  dossier  composed  of  administrative  information,  quality,  non-clinical 
and clinical data with a letter from a MAH Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd. allowing the cross reference to 
relevant quality, non-clinical and/or clinical data. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
For patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, Ristaben is indicated to improve glycaemic control: 
as monotherapy 
•  in  patients  inadequately  controlled  by  diet  and  exercise  alone  and  for  whom  metformin  is 
inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance. 
as dual oral therapy in combination with 
• metformin when diet and exercise plus metformin alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
• a sulphonylurea when diet and exercise plus maximal tolerated dose of a sulphonylurea alone do not 
provide adequate glycaemic control and when metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or 
intolerance. 
• a PPARγ agonist (i.e. a thiazolidinedione) when use of a PPARγ agonist is appropriate and when diet 
and exercise plus the PPARγ agonist alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
as triple oral therapy in combination with 
•  a  sulphonylurea  and  metformin  when  diet  and  exercise  plus  dual  therapy  with  these  agents  do  not 
provide adequate glycaemic control. 
•  a  PPARγ  agonist  and  metformin  when  use  of  a  PPARγ  agonist  is  appropriate  and  when  diet  and 
exercise plus dual therapy with these agents do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
Ristaben is also indicated as add-on to insulin (with or without metformin) when diet and exercise plus 
stable dosage of insulin do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
The  European  Medicines  Agency  agreed  on  a  PIP  granting  a  deferral  and  a  waiver  for  Januvia 
(EMEA-000470-PIP01-08). The waiver applies to children of less than 10 years on the grounds that 
type  2  diabetes  mellitus  hardly  occurs  in  the  specified  paediatric  subset.  A  clinical  trial  in 
children/adolescents 10 to 18 years was agreed upon and should be completed by October 2017. 
Scientific Advice 
The applicant did not seek scientific advice at the CHMP. 
Licensing status: 
The initial product, Januvia, has been given a Community Marketing Authorisation on 21 March 2007.

SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
3.1 
Introduction 
This application has been submitted as an informed consent application in accordance with Article 10c 
of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended.   
The  MAH  for  Januvia  provided  consent  to  make  use  of  the  pharmaceutical,  preclinical  and  clinical 
documentation contained in the file of Januvia, assessed and approved.  
As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of Ristaben are identical to the up to date quality, safety 
and efficacy profile of Januvia. The application for Ristaben concerns the strengths of 25mg, 50 mg 
and 100 mg of film-coated tablets with pack sizes identical to those approved for Januvia and consists 
only of Module 1 information. 
As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of Ristaben medicinal product are identical to the up-to-
date quality, safety and efficacy profile of Januvia.  
Information on the scientific discussions can be found in the Januvia CHMP assessment reports and in 
the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
The Ristaben informed consent application concerns only the 25mg, 50 mg and 100 mg strengths of 
Januvia. The Summary of Product Characteristics for Ristaben appropriately reflects this.  
The approved indication is:  
For patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, Ristaben is indicated to improve glycaemic control: 
as monotherapy 
•  in  patients  inadequately  controlled  by  diet  and  exercise  alone  and  for  whom  metformin  is 
inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance. 
as dual oral therapy in combination with 
• metformin when diet and exercise plus metformin alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
• a sulphonylurea when diet and exercise plus maximal tolerated dose of a sulphonylurea alone do not 
provide adequate glycaemic control and when metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or 
intolerance. 
• a PPARγ agonist (i.e. a thiazolidinedione) when use of a PPARγ agonist is appropriate and when diet 
and exercise plus the PPARγ agonist alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control.

as triple oral therapy in combination with 
•  a  sulphonylurea  and  metformin  when  diet  and  exercise  plus  dual  therapy  with  these  agents  do  not 
provide adequate glycaemic control. 
•  a  PPARγ  agonist  and  metformin  when  use  of  a  PPARγ  agonist  is  appropriate  and  when  diet  and 
exercise plus dual therapy with these agents do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
Ristaben is also indicated as add-on to insulin (with or without metformin) when diet and exercise plus 
stable dosage of insulin do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
The active substance of Ristaben is sitagliptin phosphate monohydrate, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-
4) inhibitor. DPP-4 inhibition reduces the cleavage and inactivation of the active (intact) form of the 
incretin  hormones,  including  glucagon-like  peptide  1  (GLP-1)  and  glucose  dependent  inhibitory 
peptide (GIP), producing an elevation of incretin concentrations that lead to enhancement of glucose-
dependent insulin secretion and a reduction in glucagon release. 
The  benefit  of  Ristaben  is  a  demonstrated  reduction  in  baseline  HbA1c  at  24  weeks  in  combination 
with  metformin,  or  a  PPARγ  agonist,  or  a  sulphonylurea,  or  a  sulphonylurea  and  metformin,  or  a 
metformin and PPARγ agonist (54 weeks study), or a insulin with or without metformin. It has also 
shown  a  reduction  in  fasting  plasma  glucose  (FPG).  The  most  common  side  effect  when  taking 
Ristaben with metformin is nausea. When taking Ristaben with pioglitazone, they are low blood sugar, 
flatulence and foot swelling. The most common side effect when taking Ristaben with a sulfonylurea 
is low blood sugar. When taking Ristaben with metformin and a sulfonylurea the most common side 
effects  are  low  blood  sugar  and  constipation.  When  taking  Ristaben  with  metformin  and  PPARγ 
agonist  the  most  common  side  effects  are  headache,  vomiting,  low  blood  sugar,  foot  swelling  and 
diarrhoea. When taking Ristaben alone, the most common side effects are low blood sugar, headache, 
stuffy or runny nose and sore throat. When taking Ristaben with insulin with or without metformin the 
most  common  side  effects  are  headache,  low  blood  sugar  and  infuenza.  Additional  adverse 
experiences reported regardless of causal relationship to medication that occurred more frequently in 
patients  treated  with  Ristaben  included  osteoarthritis  and  pain  in  extremity.  During  post-marketing 
experience  of  the  reference  product  the  following  additional  side  effects  have  been  reported 
(frequency not known): hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria, 
cutaneous  vasculitis,  and  exfoliative  skin  conditions 
including  Stevens-Johnson  syndrome, 
pancreatitis. 
Ristaben should not be used in individuals below 18 years of age. 
3.2  Quality aspects 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Januvia application, the quality data in support of 
the Ristaben application are identical to the up-to-date quality data of the Januvia dossier , which have 
been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures).  
3.3  Non-clinical aspects 
Since Ristaben application is an informed consent of the Januvia application, the non-clinical data in 
support  of  the  Januvia  application  are  identical  to  the  up-to-date  non-clinical  data  of  the  Januvia 
dossier, which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). 
3.4 Clinical aspects 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Januvia application, the clinical data in support of 
the Ristaben application are identical to the up-to-date clinical data of the Januvia dossier, which have 
been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). No additional clinical studies 
are provided.

3.5 Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system (version 6.0) as described by the applicant 
fulfils the legislative requirements.    
Risk Management Plan 
The MAA submitted a risk management plan (version 2.0) identical with that for Januvia.  
The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application,  is  of  the  opinion  that  no 
additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information. 
PSURs 
As requested by the MAH and agreed by the CHMP, the PSUR cycle of informed consent application 
will correspond to the one attributed to the product, [anuvia, unless otherwise specified. 
3.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Januvia application, the CHMP considered that the 
risk-benefit  balance  of  Ristaben  was  favourable  and  therefore  recommended  the  granting  of  the 
marketing authorisation by consensus for the following indication:  
For patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, Ristaben is indicated to improve glycaemic control: 
as monotherapy 
• in patients inadequately controlled by diet and exercise alone and for whom metformin is 
inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance. 
as dual oral therapy in combination with 
• metformin when diet and exercise plus metformin alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
• a sulphonylurea when diet and exercise plus maximal tolerated dose of a sulphonylurea alone do not 
provide adequate glycaemic control and when metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or 
intolerance. 
• a PPARγ agonist (i.e. a thiazolidinedione) when use of a PPARγ agonist is appropriate and when diet 
and exercise plus the PPARγ agonist alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
as triple oral therapy in combination with 
•  a  sulphonylurea  and  metformin  when  diet  and  exercise  plus  dual  therapy  with  these  agents  do  not 
provide adequate glycaemic control. 
•  a  PPARγ  agonist  and  metformin  when  use  of  a  PPARγ  agonist  is  appropriate  and  when  diet  and 
exercise plus dual therapy with these agents do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
Ristaben is also indicated as add-on to insulin (with or without metformin) when diet and exercise plus 
stable dosage of insulin do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
•  User consultation 
A justification for not conducting a user testing for this application was provided, in view of the fact 
that  a  readability  test  had  been  performed  at  the  time  of  the  original  MAA  for  Januvia.  Since  the

content  of  the  package  leaflet  is  identical  to  the  latest  approved  leaflet  of  Januvia  and  therefore  no 
further testing is warranted.

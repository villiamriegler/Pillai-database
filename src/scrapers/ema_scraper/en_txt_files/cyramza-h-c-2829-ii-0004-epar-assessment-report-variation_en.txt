1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Type II variation 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. submitted 
to the European Medicines Agency on 27 February 2015 an application for a variation.  
The following variation was requested:

Extension of Indication to include a new indication for Cyramza, in combination with FOLFIRI 
(irinotecan, folinic acid, and 5-fluorouracil), for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic 
colorectal cancer (mCRC) with disease progression on or after prior therapy with bevacizumab, 
oxaliplatin and a fluoropyrimidine; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of 
the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. In addition, the Marketing 
authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to correct minor editorial mistakes. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
CYRAMZA was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/03/12/1004 on 4 July 2012. CYRAMZA 
was designated as an orphan medicinal product in the following indication: Treatment of gastric cancer  
The new indication, which is the subject of this application, does not fall within any orphan condition. 
According to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council 
on orphan medicinal products, it is not possible to combine an orphan indication and a non orphan 
indication in the same marketing authorisation. Consequently, the MAH has requested the withdrawal 
of the orphan designation from the Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products. 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
CW/1/2011 on the granting of a class waiver.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
About the disease 
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in men and the second most common cancer 
in women worldwide (Globocan 2012). In Europe, CRC is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and 
the second leading cause of cancer death. The stage of disease at the time of diagnosis represents the 
most relevant prognostic factor. Five-year survival rates range from 93% for stage I disease to less 
than 10% for stage IV (Ferlay J et al.). 
Surgery, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy in certain cases, represents the standard therapeutic 
approach for patients with loco-regional disease. However, approximately 25% of patients present with 
metastases at initial diagnosis and almost 50% of patients with CRC will develop metastases, 
contributing to the high mortality rates reported for CRC. The CRC-related 5-year survival rate 
approaches 60% (Van Cutsem et al.) 
For most patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC), treatment is palliative rather than curative. The goals 
of systemic treatment in these patients are to prolong survival and to maintain quality of life for as 
long as possible.  
The backbone of first-line palliative chemotherapy alone, as well in combination with targeted agents, 
consists of a fluoropyrimidine (FP) [intravenous (i.v.) 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or the oral FP capecitabine] 
in various combinations and schedules. These consist essentially in combination chemotherapy with 5-
FU/LV/oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) or 5-FU/LV/irinotecan (FOLFIRI).  
The combination of capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (CAPOX) and the combination of capecitabine plus 
irinotecan (CAPIRI) are alternatives. Fluoropyrimidine based regimens are given as first or second line 
therapy (ESMO guideline). Second-line chemotherapy is expected to be offered to patients with good 
performance status and adequate organ function. 
Monoclonal antibodies (bevacizumab) or proteins (aflibercept) against vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF) and against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in combination with 
chemotherapy can be considered in patients with mCRC, since they have been shown to improve the 
outcome of mCRC (see EPAR Avastin and EPAR Zaltrap, respectively). Bevacizumab is indicated in 
combination with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy for treatment of adult patients with metastatic 
carcinoma of the colon or rectum.  
Zaltrap is indicated in combination with irinotecan/5-fluorouracil/folinic acid (FOLFIRI) chemotherapy in 
adults with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) that is resistant to or has progressed after an 
oxaliplatin-containing regimen. The efficacy and safety of Zaltrap were evaluated in a randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who had previously 
been treated with an oxaliplatin-based treatment with or without prior bevacizumab. The difference in 
median OS was 1.44 months in favour of the aflibercept arm, 13.50 months (95.34% CI:12.517 to 
14.949) in the aflibercept arm compared to 12.06 months (11.072 to 13.109) in the placebo arm (see 
Zaltrap SmPC). 
In patients with RAS wild-type mCRC, the anti- EGFR monoclonal antibodies cetuximab or 
panitumumab can also be administered as monotherapy or in combination with FP-based regimens 
(see EPAR Erbitux and EPAR Vectibix).

Regorafenib, an orally available multikinase inhibitor is also available in EU for the for the treatment of 
adult patients with mCRC who have been previously treated with, or are not considered candidates for, 
available therapies including fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy, an anti-VEGF therapy and an anti-
EGFR therapy (see EPAR Stivarga).  
About the product 
Ramucirumab is a human receptor-targeted monoclonal antibody that specifically binds VEGF Receptor 
2,  which  is  the  primary  receptor  of  transmitting  VEGF  signals  downstream  in  endothelial  cells.  The 
binding  of  ramucirumab  to  VEGF  Receptor  2  prevents  interaction  with  activating  ligands  (VEGF-A, 
VEGF-C,  and  VEGF-D).  As  a  result,  ramucirumab  inhibits  activation  of  VEGF  Receptor  2  and  thereby 
the  VEGFR-2  signalling  pathway.  The  VEGFR-2  signalling  pathway  is  crucial  for  angiogenesis  by 
bringing  about  the  effects  of  VEGFs  including  vasodilatation,  endothelial  cell  migration  and 
proliferation.  
Ramucirumab was firstly approved in EU on 19 December 2014 for the following indications:  
Cyramza in combination with paclitaxel is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced 
gastric  cancer  or  gastro-oesophageal  junction  adenocarcinoma  with  disease  progression  after  prior 
platinum and fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy (see section 5.1).  
Cyramza monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced gastric cancer or 
gastro-oesophageal  junction  adenocarcinoma  with  disease  progression  after  prior  platinum  or 
fluoropyrimidine  chemotherapy,  for  whom  treatment  in  combination  with  paclitaxel  is  not  appropriate 
(see section 5.1). 
The  recommended  dose  of  ramucirumab  for  the  already  approved  indication  in  gastric  cancer  is  8 
mg/kg every 2 weeks as monotherapy or in combination with paclitaxel. 
For the use of Cyramza in combination with paclitaxel, the approved dosing is 8 mg/kg on day 1 and 
15 of a 28 days cycle indications, prior to paclitaxel infusion. As single agent the recommended dose of 
ramucirumab  is  8  mg/kg  every  2  weeks.  Treatment  should  be  continued  until  disease  progression  or 
until unacceptable toxicity has occurred.  
The  MAH  applied  to  extend  the  indication  as  follows:  “Cyramza,  in  combination  with  FOLFIRI 
(irinotecan,  folinic  acid,  and  5-fluorouracil),  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with 
metastatic  colorectal  cancer  (mCRC)  with  disease  progression  on  or  after  prior  therapy  with 
bevacizumab, oxaliplatin and a fluoropyrimidine”. 
The recommended dose of ramucirumab in patients with mCRC is 8 mg/kg on day 1 of a 14 day cycle 
prior to FOLFIRI administration. Prior to chemotherapy, patients should have a complete blood count. 
Criteria to be met prior to FOLFIRI are provided in the SmPC section 4.2 (Table 2). 
The MAH received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on 20 May 2010 (EMEA/H/SA/1505/2/2010/II). The 
Scientific Advice pertained to clinical aspects of the dossier. In particular, the CHMP discussed the 
inclusion criteria and agreed that there was no scientific rationale for limiting the study to patients with 
KRAS mutated disease. The use of FOLFIRI as background chemotherapy was considered acceptable. 
The CHMP agreed that due to the relatively short prognosis for patients progressing after 1st line 
treatment (1 year) the overall survival was the most direct measure of clinical benefit and the 
appropriate endpoint. Since extensive immunogenicity testing was planned in 7 Phase II studies and 2 
Phase III studies in other indications, it was considered acceptable that for this study in MCRC patients 
routinely immunogenicity testing was not incorporated.

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP.  
No animal studies have been performed to test ramucirumab for potential of 
carcinogenicity or genotoxicity (see SmPC section 5.3 and EPAR). Carcinogenicity and genotoxicity are 
safety concerns included in the RMP under missing information (see RMP).  
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No ERA was submitted. 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Antibodies, as other peptides and proteins, are exempted from environmental risk assessment (ERA) 
based on the EMA 2006 Guideline on Environmental Risk Assessment (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00). 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  clinical  pharmacology  package  comprised  ramucirumab  PK  data  from  4 new  studies  (RAISE, 
REACH,  JVCB,  and  JCDB).  Data  from  the  previously  submitted  Study  JVBY,  a  Phase  1b  trial  in  which 
Japanese patients with metastatic colorectal cancer whose disease had progressed during or following 
first-line  combination  therapy  with  bevacizumab,  oxaliplatin,  and  a  fluoropyrimidine  received 
ramucirumab  in  combination  with  FOLFIRI,  were  also  presented.  In  addition,  an  updated  PopPK 
analysis integrating the data from RAISE was provided (RAISE PopPK).

PopPK analysis 
In the updated PopPK analysis for RAISE (RAISE PopPK), ramucirumab PK data from RAISE (Study 
JVBB) and supporting studies were integrated with the data previously analysed in REVEL (REVEL 
PopPK) and RAINBOW (RAINBOW PopPK). The final dataset for the RAISE PopPK included 11 studies 
(RAISE, REACH, REVEL [JVBA], REGARD [JVBD], JVBJ, JVBW, JVBX, JVBY, JVCA, JVCC, and RAINBOW 
[JVBE]). The final analysis included 6427 evaluable ramucirumab concentrations obtained from 1639 
patients. 
The PK of ramucirumab was described by a linear two-compartment model with zero-order input and 
first-order elimination. None of the covariates investigated including age (range 19-87), gender (male 
N=1125, female=587), race (white N=1125, Asian N=433), cancer type (gastric, NSCLC, mCRC, HCC), 
hepatic function, renal function (including 6 subjects with severe renal impairment), and body weight 
(range  30-139  kg)  were  found  to  satisfy  the  predefined  criteria  (reduction  in  the  objective  function 
value  [MOF]  of  at  least  10.828  points  (p>0.001)  and  reduction  in  inter-patient  variability  [IIV]  of  at 
least 5%). Therefore, the final model contained no covariates (see Table below).

Table 3: Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Final Population Model for ramucirumab
PopPK estimated mean volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) was 5.4 L (CV=15%).  
Ramucirumab PopPK estimated clearance was 0.015 L/hour (CV=30%) and elimination half-life (t1/2) 
longer, i.e., 14 days (CV=20%).  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In phase 3 study RAISE, samples for determination of serum ramucirumab concentrations were 
scheduled prior to infusion (trough or Cmin) at Doses 1, 3, and 5 and optionally at Doses 9, 13, and 17. 
Additional optional samples were scheduled at 1 hour following the end of infusion (approximate 
Cmax) for Doses 3, 5, 9, 13, and 17. PK analyses derived from descriptive statistics following 
ramucirumab administrations are shown in the table below.

Special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
Effect  of  hepatic  function  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  ramucirumab  was  investigated  in  the  REACH 
study  in  patients  with  HCC.  REACH  was  a  global,  randomized,  placebo-controlled,  double-blind, 
multicenter  Phase  3  study  that  compared  ramucirumab  with  placebo  in  patients  with  HCC  who  had 
disease  progression  during  or  following  first-line  therapy  with  sorafenib  or  who  were  intolerant  to 
sorafenib. 
Samples  for  determination  of  ramucirumab  serum  concentrations  were  scheduled  prior  to  infusion 
(trough or Cmin) and 1 hour following the end of infusion (approximate Cmax) for Doses 1, 4, and 7, with 
an additional sample scheduled at the 30-day follow-up visit. In the ramucirumab treatment arm (317 
patients treated), PK data were available for 315 patients throughout the study. PK data were available 
for 276 patients in the Child-Pugh A Group and 39 patients in the Child-Pugh B Group. 
The  geometric  mean  trough  concentrations  prior  to  Dose  4  and  Dose  7  (minimal  concentrations 
following Dose 3 and Dose 6) for patients with baseline Child-Pugh Class A were 42.5 µg/mL and 55.5 
µg/mL,  respectively  and  for  patients  with  baseline  Child-Pugh  Class  B  45.4  µg/mL  and  53.3  µg/mL, 
respectively.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In Study JVCB potential interaction between ramucirumab and FOLFIRI was investigated; intensive PK 
sampling was performed.  
Study JVCB was designed to assess the effect of concomitant ramucirumab on the pharmacokinetics of 
irinotecan  and  its  metabolite  SN-38  when  coadministered  with  folinic  acid  and  5-FU  in  patients  with 
advanced  malignant  solid  tumours  resistant  to  standard  therapy  or  for  whom  no  standard  therapy  is 
available.  The  PK  of  5-FU  was  not  assessed  owing  to  its  very  short  half-life  (approximately  11-15 
minutes)  when  administered  intravenously.  Irinotecan,  as  part  of  the  FOLFIRI  regimen  and  without 
ramucirumab,  was  administered  in  Cycle  1;  in  Cycle  2,  ramucirumab  was  administered  prior  to  the 
administration of FOLFIRI, with a 60-minute observation period in between ramucirumab and FOLFIRI. 
Blood samples for the assessment of irinotecan and SN-38 PK were collected at 0, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 
6,  8,  10,  22,  25,  28,  31,  34,  48,  72,  96,  and  168  hours  after  the  start  of  the  infusion  in  Cycle  1 
(FOLFIRI  alone)  and  Cycle  2  (FOLFIRI  plus  ramucirumab).  Blood  samples  for  the  assessment  of 
ramucirumab PK were collected at -2, -1, -.5, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 25, 48, 72, 96, 168, 264, and 336 
hours (this timing is relative to the start of the irinotecan infusion which occurs at t=0, after a 1-hour 
ramucirumab infusion and subsequent 1 hour observation period) in Cycle 2. 
Table 6 displays the results of the statistical analysis evaluating the effect of concomitant ramucirumab 
on PK of irinotecan and SN-38. Dose-normalized AUC (0-inf) and Cmax of irinotecan and SN-38 in Cycle 
2 when administered with ramucirumab were similar to those when FOLFIRI was administered alone in 
Cycle 1. For PK of irinotecan, the ratios of geometric LS means and 90% CI are 0.93 (90% CI: 0.83, 
1.05)  for  AUC(0-inf),  and  1.04  (90%  CI:  0.97,  1.12)  for  Cmax.  For  PK  of  SN-38,  the  ratios  of 
geometric  LS  means  and  90%  CI  are  0.95  (90%  CI:  0.88,  1.04)  for  AUC(0-inf)  and  0.97  (90%  CI:

0.85,  1.12)  for  Cmax.  These  results  support  the  conclusion  that  coadministration  of  FOLFIRI  with 
ramucirumab is unlikely to have an effect on the PK of irinotecan and SN-38.

Table 6. Statistical Analysis of Dose-Normalized PK Parameters for Irinotecan and SN-38 in Study JVCB 
(DDI Population) 
To assess whether coadministration of FOLFIRI had any effect on ramucirumab PK, pharmacokinetics 
of ramucirumab in combination with FOLFIRI study JVCB were compared with pharmacokinetics of 
ramucirumab monotherapy from study JVCA. Results are shown in Table 7. Ramucirumab exposure 
appears to be comparable regardless of concomitant FOLFIRI based on this cross study comparison in 
patients with solid tumours. These results show that coadministration of FOLFIRI is unlikely to have 
any effect on ramucirumab PK.

Exposure-response analysis 
Exposure-response  (E-R)  analyses  based  on  RAISE  were  performed  to  characterize  the  relationship 
between ramucirumab exposure and selected measures of efficacy and safety in RAISE.  
- Efficacy 
Exposure-response  analyses  indicated  that efficacy  of  ramucirumab  was  correlated  with  ramucirumab 
exposure.  Better  efficacy,  as  measured  by  OS  and  PFS,  was  associated  with  increasing  ramucirumab 
exposure  over  the  ranges  of  exposures  achieved  by  a  dose  of  8  mg/kg  ramucirumab  (see  Figure  1). 
From  the  lowest  to  the  highest  ramucirumab  exposure,  median  OS  increased  from  11.5  to  16.7 
months.  Median  OS  in  the  placebo  plus  FOLFIRI  arm  was  12.4  months.  Median  progression  free

months.

metastasis,  carcinoembryonic  antigen,  sex,  and  combined  prior  bevacizumab  use)  that  could  be 
prognostic  between  the  treatment  arms  within  each  exposure  group,  matched  case-control  analysis 
and  univariate  -  multivariate  Cox  regression  analyses  were  performed  to  evaluate  the  exposure 
efficacy  relationship  for  efficacy  endpoints  OS  and  PFS.  Cox  regression  analysis  (Table  8)  showed  a 
statistically  significant  positive  association  between  OS  or  PFS  and  Cmin,ss  in  the  univariate  analysis. 
This  relationship  remained  statistically  significant  after  adjusting  for  prognostic  factors  found  to  be 
significantly associated with OS or PFS in RAISE.

Efficacy Analysis  
– Safety 
The  E-R  analysis  for  safety,  evaluated  Grade  ≥3  neutropenia  (consolidated  term),  hypertension, 
fatigue (consolidated term), and diarrhoea. There was no relationship between ramucirumab exposure 
and the risk of Grade ≥3 hypertension, Grade 3 fatigue, or Grade ≥3 diarrhea but the risk of Grade ≥3 
neutropenia was increased with increasing ramucirumab exposure. Additional covariate analyses found 
age at study entry, sex, and Asian race to be significant predictors for risk of neutropenia in metastatic 
CRC patients. The model-predicted risk of neutropenia (Grade ≥3) for 5th to 95th percentile range of 
Cmin,ss  in  RAISE  is  shown  below  in  Figure  2  for  male  and  female,  Asian  and  non-Asian  patients  of 
representative  ages.  The  likelihood  of  experiencing  Grade  3  or  greater  neutropenia  increased  with 
age.  The  shape  and  trend  of  the  curves  for  neutropenia  between  male  and  female  patients  of  both 
Asian  and  non-Asian  race  were  similar,  with  female  Asian  patients  in  both  the  placebo  plus  FOLFIRI

arm  and  ramucirumab  plus  FOLFIRI  arm  exhibiting  the  greatest  risks  of  Grade  ≥3  neutropenia.  The 
higher risk of  neutropenia observed in Asian patients relative to non-Asian patients is independent of 
treatment arm.

Figure  3  shows  that  patients  with  higher  ramucirumab  exposure  had  higher  incidences  of  dose 
modifications  (dose  delays,  dose  reductions,  and  dose  omissions)  of  components  of  FOLFIRI  as 
compared to patients with lower exposure. Higher incidence of 5-FU dose discontinuation was observed

ramucirumab exposure and dose reduction, dose omission, or dose discontinuation of ramucirumab.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  irinotecan  and  its  active  metabolite,  SN-38,  were  not  affected  when  co-
administered with ramucirumab (see SmPC section 4.5). 
No dose finding study for the combination of ramucirumab in combination with FOLFIRI was conducted. 
The  same  dose  8  mg/kg  and  frequency  of  ramucirumab  every  two  weeks  as  for  the  approved 
indication of metastatic gastric cancer has been selected. In the dose finding studies for ramucirumab 
monotherapy  no  clear  dose  effect  relation  was  apparent  and  no  MTD  was  established  for  the  every 
other  week  or  every  three  week  dose  administration  up  to  20  mg/kg.  It  should  be  noted  that  for 
gastric  cancer  the  CHMP  had  a  concern  that  the  8  mg/kg  may  not  be  the  optimal  dose,  and  a  post-
approval dose optimisation study is to be conducted (see Study 14T-MC-JVDB in Annex II). Based on 
popPK analysis, pharmacokinetics of ramucirumab appeared similar in patients with CRC as with other 
cancer  types.  Non-compartmental  analysis  of  a  PK  rich  single  dose  study  of  ramucirumab  exposure 
with FOLFIRI suggested a time-dependency in pharmacokinetics of ramucirumab.  Based on available 
data, the contribution of target mediated clearance at the dose of 8 and 10 mg/kg ramucirumab seems 
to be limited. Results from study JVCZ (ramucirumab 8 mg/kg + docetaxel vs ramucirumab 12 mg/kg

EMA/CHMP/69143/2016  
Page 22/73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
+  docetaxel),  a  2-arm  study  that  will  compare  safety  and  PK  of  the  currently  approved  dose  and 
regimen  of  ramucirumab  (8  mg/kg  every  2  weeks)  plus  paclitaxel  with  another,  higher  dose  of 
ramucirumab (12 mg/kg every 2 weeks) plus paclitaxel, may provide further information on the dose 
dependency of the target mediated clearance. The MAH is recommended to submit the results of this 
study as soon as available (REC). 
Results from univariate and multivariate analysis of OS and PFS with ramucirumab exposure in RAISE 
suggest that with the 8 mg/kg ramucirumab dosing, higher ramucirumab exposure is associated with 
improved  efficacy.  The  relationship  between  exposure  and  efficacy  remained  after  adjusting  for  the 
baseline prognostic factors.  
In RAISE the incidences of grade ≥3 neutropenia were increased in the ramucirumab with FOLFIRI arm 
compared to the placebo with FOLFIRI arm and incidence of grade ≥3 neutropenia was correlated with 
ramucirumab exposure. More patients with high ramucirumab exposure discontinued treatment with 5-
FU  but  continued  with  irinotecan  and  ramucirumab  treatment.  Patients  in  the  ramucirumab  arm 
experienced a worse quality of life (see also clinical safety). 
Higher  doses  of  ramucirumab  may  be  more  efficacious  but  ramucirumab  seems  to  increase  FOLFIRI 
related  toxicity  in  RAISE  (see  clinical  safety),  therefore  higher  dosing  of  ramucirumab  when  given  in 
combination FOLFIRI appears not justified. Since analyses suggest the exposure response relationship 
is  very  similar  across  indications,  results  from  Study  14T-MC-JVDB  (see  Annex  II  condition)  may 
provide a better insight about the optimal dose regimen in patients with mCRC. 
Ramucirumab  exposure  was  higher  in  patients  with  higher  bodyweight.  However,  no  increase  in 
incidences  of  Grade  ≥  3  AEs  or  dose  modifications  were  observed  in  patients  in  the  highest  baseline 
body  weight  quartile  group.  Based  on  these  data,  no  dose  modification  is  necessary  for  patients 
weighing >85 kg. There are no safety and efficacy data in patients > 139 kg. 
PopPK  analyses  did  not  identify  any  specific  patient  groups  that  were  associated  with  low  or  high 
ramucirumab  exposure,  thus  no  dose  recommendations  can  be  made  for  certain  subpopulations. 
However,  the  ramucirumab-OS  Kaplan-Meier  curve  indicated  that  subjects  with  low  ramucirumab 
exposure  had  worse  OS  compared  to  FOLFIRI  treatment,  suggesting  an  imbalance  in  baseline 
characteristics/prognostic  factors  in  the  low  ramucirumab  exposure  group.  Nevertheless,  tumour 
related  factors  such  as  lactate  dehydrogenase  (LDH),  carcinoembryonic  antigen  (CEA),  Eastern 
Cooperative  Oncology  Group  performance  status  (ECOG  PS),  number  of  metastatic  sites,  and  VEGF 
Receptor  2  expression  level  in  tumour  tissues  had  no  significant  effect  on  pharmacokinetics  of 
ramucirumab in popPK analysis. Patients with low CEA levels (≤10 ng/ml) appeared to derive more OS 
benefit  of  ramucirumab  treatment  HR  0.679  (0.498,  0.924)  than  patients  with  higher  baseline  CEA 
levels  (>10  ng/ml)  OS  HR  0.903  (0.764,  1.068).  However,  the  treatment  effect  on  PFS  was  similar 
across  the  different  baseline  CEA  quartile  groups.  Therefore,  CEA  baseline  levels  are  not  considered 
useful as a marker for treatment effect of ramucirumab. 
Based  available  data,  no  specific  dose  recommendations  are  considered  necessary  in  the  elderly  and 
the general recommendations in SmPC section 4.2 and 4.5 are considered to also apply to the mCRC 
population. 
Only 6 patients with severe renal impairment were included in the popPK analysis. This is not sufficient 
for  dose  recommendations.  Patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  have  often  more  co-morbidities  / 
other medications and may have a different safety profile. Only limited efficacy and safety experience 
is available in patients with severe renal impairment (see SmPC sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2).  
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/69143/2016  
Page 23/73 
 
 
 
 
 
The  PK  of  ramucirumab  was  similar  between  Child-Pugh  Class  A  and  Class  B  patients.  Therefore,  no 
dose  adjustments  are  required  in  patients  with  mild  or  moderate  hepatic  impairment  (see  SmPC 
section 4.2). There are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 
5.2). 
The safety and efficacy of Cyramza in children and adolescents (<18 years) has not been established. 
No  data  are  available.  There  is  no  relevant  use  of  ramucirumab  in  the  paediatric  population  for  the 
indications of adenocarcinoma of the colon and rectum (see SmPC section 4.2). 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Exposure of ramucirumab in mCRC is consistent with the exposure in patients with gastric cancer or 
non-small cell lung cancer. Exposure effect relationships revealed that both efficacy (OS and PFS) and 
safety (grade 3 neutropenia) were related to ramucirumab exposure but patients treated with 
ramucirumab in combination with FOLFIRI experienced a worse quality of life than treatment with 
FOLFIRI alone (see discussion on clinical efficacy and clinical safety).  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
No dose response study was submitted (see discussion on clinical pharmacology). 
2.4.2.  Main study 
Study RAISE 
RAISE was a global, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter Phase 3 study that 
evaluated the efficacy of ramucirumab versus placebo, each in combination with FOLFIRI, in patients 
with mCRC whose disease had progressed during or after first-line combination therapy of 
bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, and a fluoropyrimidine.  
Methods 
Study participants 
Main in- and exclusion criteria: 
Patients were eligible for the study if they met any of the following criteria: 
1.  The patient had histologically or cytologically confirmed CRC, excluding primary tumours of 
appendiceal origin. Patients were eligible to enrol irrespective of KRAS mutation status. 
2.  The patient had confirmed metastatic CRC (Stage IV). 
3.  The KRAS mutation status (wild-type versus mutant) of the patient was known prior to 
randomization. 
4.  The patient had received 1st line combination therapy of bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, and a 
fluoropyrimidine for metastatic disease and: 
a.  experienced radiographic disease progression during 1st line therapy, or 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/69143/2016  
Page 24/73 
 
 
 
 
 
b.  experienced radiographic disease progression ≤6 months after the last dose 
c.  of 1st line therapy, or 
d.  discontinued part or all of first-line therapy due to toxicity and experienced radiographic 
disease progression ≤6 months after the last dose of first-line therapy. 
Note that a patient was required to have received a minimum of 2 doses of bevacizumab as part of 
a 1st line regimen containing chemotherapy. In addition, a patient must have received at least 1 
cycle of 1st line therapy that included bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, and a fluoropyrimidine in the same 
cycle. 
Note that a patient must not have received more than 2 different fluoropyrimidines as part of a 1st 
line regimen; disease progression was not an acceptable reason for discontinuing one 
fluoropyrimidine and starting a second fluoropyrimidine. 
5.  The patient had metastatic disease that was not amenable to potentially curative resection in the 
opinion of the investigator. 
6.  The patient had received no more than 2 prior systemic chemotherapy regimens in any setting 
(only 1 prior regimen for metastatic disease was permitted). For patients with rectal cancer, 
sequential neo-adjuvant and adjuvant therapy was counted as a single systemic regimen. Note 
that rechallenge with oxaliplatin was permitted and was considered part of the 1st line regimen for 
metastatic disease. Both the initial oxaliplatin treatment and the subsequent rechallenge were 
considered as 1 regimen. 
7.  The patient had measurable or nonmeasurable disease based on the Response Evaluation Criteria 
in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST v. 1.1). 
Patients were excluded from the study if they met any of the following criteria: 
1.  The patient had received bevacizumab ≤28 days prior to randomization. 
2.  The patient had received chemotherapy ≤21 days prior to randomization. 
3.  The patient had received wide-field (full-dose pelvic) radiotherapy ≤28 days prior to randomization 
or had received any radiotherapy ≤14 days prior to randomization. 
4.  The patient had received any investigational therapy for a non-oncology clinical indication ≤28 
days prior to randomization. 
5.  The patient had received any previous systemic therapy, other than a combination of 
bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, and a fluoropyrimidine, for first-line treatment of mCRC. 
6.  The patient had a history of uncontrolled hereditary or acquired bleeding or thrombotic disorders. 
7.  The patient had an uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including, but not limited to uncontrolled 
hypertension, symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF), unstable angina pectoris, symptomatic 
or poorly controlled cardiac arrhythmia, psychiatric illness/social situations, or any other serious 
uncontrolled medical disorders in the opinion of the investigator. 
8.  The patient had experienced any arterial thrombotic or arterial thromboembolic events, including, 
but not limited to myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, or cerebrovascular accident, 
≤12 months prior to randomization. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/69143/2016

9.  The patient has a history of inflammatory bowel disease or Crohn’s disease requiring medical 
intervention (immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive medications or surgery) ≤12 months prior 
to randomization. 
10. The patient has an acute or subacute bowel obstruction or history of chronic diarrhoea which was 
considered clinically significant in the opinion of the investigator. 
11. The patient had experienced a Grade 3 or higher bleeding event ≤3 months prior to randomization. 
12. The patient had either peptic ulcer disease associated with a bleeding event, or known active 
diverticulitis. 
13. The patient experienced any of the following during first-line therapy with a bevacizumab-
containing regimen: an arterial thrombotic/thromboembolic event, Grade 4 hypertension, Grade 3 
proteinuria, a Grade 3-4 bleeding event or bowel perforation. 
Treatments 
Patients  were  randomized  (1:1)  to  receive  either  ramucirumab  (8  mg/kg  q  2)  plus  FOLFIRI 
(Irinotecan: 180 mg/m2 D1 q cycle; followed by folinic acid 400 mg/m2 D1 q cycle; 5-FU 400 mg/m2 
bolus  [over  2-4  minutes]  followed  by  5-FU  2400  mg/m2  48-hour  infusion)  on  D1  and  2  of  q  2-week 
cycle weeks) or placebo plus FOLFIRI.  
•  Ramucirumab (8 mg/kg) or placebo (equivalent volume), administered as an 60-min intravenous 
[I.V.] infusion on Day 1 of each cycle followed by a 1- hour observation period (cycle 1 and 2) 
followed by the FOLFIRI regimen.  
• 
FOLFIRI 
o 
Irinotecan: 180 mg/m2 administered IV over 90 (±10) minutes, 1 hour after the end of the 
infusion of ramucirumab/placebo (or immediately after the infusion of 
ramucirumab/placebo if no observation period is required) on Day 1 of each cycle; followed 
by Folinic acid: 400 mg/m2 administered IV over 120 (±10) minutes on Day 1 of each 
cycle (alternatively, FA could be administered [via separate infusion lines] concurrently 
with IRI); followed by 
o  5-Fluorouracil (5-FU): 400 mg/m2 bolus over 2 to 4 minutes administered IV immediately 
following completion of the FA infusion on Day 1 of each cycle (infusions of up to 15 
minutes in duration were permitted at the discretion of the investigator in order to comply 
with institutional guidelines); followed by 
o  5-FU: 2400 mg/m2 administered IV over 46 to 48 hours (continuously) on Days 1 and 2 of 
each cycle. 
Patients who discontinued one or more components of treatment because of an adverse event were 
permitted to continue therapy with the other treatment component(s) until disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of RAISE was to show superiority of ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI in terms of OS 
by comparing ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI with placebo plus FOLFIRI in patients with mCRC progressing 
after prior 1st line 5FU, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab containing combination treatment. 
Secondary objectives were to compare ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI treatment with placebo plus FOLFIRI 
treatment for: progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), patient-reported 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

outcome (PRO) measures (using European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 
[EORTC] QLQ-C30 and EuroQol EQ-5D), safety profile, assessment of anti-ramucirumab antibodies 
(immunogenicity), assessment of serum levels of ramucirumab. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
•  Overall survival, defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of death from 
any cause. If the patient was alive at the end of the follow-up period (or was lost to follow-up), OS 
data were censored for analysis on the last date the patient was known to be alive. 
Secondary endpoints 
• 
PFS, defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of objectively determined 
progressive disease (according to RECIST v. 1.1, as assessed by the investigator) or death due to 
any cause, whichever was first. Patients who died without a reported prior progression were 
considered to have progressed on the day of their death. Patients who did not progress or were 
lost to follow-up were censored at the day of their last radiographic tumor assessment. 
•  ORR was equal to the proportion of patients achieving a best overall response of partial or 
complete response (PR + CR). Response assessments were undertaken every 6 weeks (±3 days) 
through Week 36, then every 12 weeks (±3 days) thereafter, as calculated from the first dose of 
study therapy. Patients were evaluated for response according to RECIST, v 1.1 guidelines 
(Eisenhauer et al. 2009). 
• 
PRO measures (using European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC] QLQ-
C30 and EuroQol EQ-5D). 
•  Safety profile 
•  Assessment of anti-ramucirumab antibodies (immunogenicity) 
•  Assessment of serum levels of ramucirumab 
Exploratory endpoints 
•  Assessment of the association between biomarkers and clinical outcome. The biomarker plan for 
RAISE included investigation of those markers deemed most likely to show a relationship with 
ramucirumab activity (e.g. VEGF 2 receptor expression, blood vessel density, circulating factors 
related to VEGF mediated signalling etc), and the markers analysed were prioritized by availability 
of samples and assays. 
Sample size 
Sample  size  was  calculated  using  group  sequential  analysis  methodology  based  on  the  following 
assumptions:  the  1-sided  overall  significance  level  is  0.025  (2-sided  0.05);  Power  85%;  The  median 
overall survival is 10 months in the control arm (based on review of literature (Tourigand 2004, Malbro 
2006,  Bidard  2009))  and  12.5  months 
in 
the  active 
treatment  arm;  hazard 
ratio, 
experimental/control=0.8;  The  randomization  ratio  is  1:1;  2  interim  futility  analyses  with  beta 
spending  will  be  based  on  Pocock  (1977);  The  accrual  rate  per  month  would  be  5  (Months  1-2),  10 
(Month 3), 20 (Month 4), 30 (Month 5), 40 (Month 6+); Overall discontinuation rates are assumed to 
be 5% in both active treatment as well as the control arm. 
Seven hundred and fifty six (756) OS events (deaths) were needed for the final analysis. To allow for 
censoring due to data cut-off and drop-outs, a total of 1050 patients will be randomized.

Based on actual accrual during the first 10 months of the study, sample size may be increased to 
observe the required number of events within the estimated study duration of approximately 40 
months. Increasing sample size based on the accrual in the first 10 months does not affect type I error 
as 1) it is not evaluating the effect size and 2) it is not the number of patients but the number of 
deaths that counts for the hypothesis test and the latter is kept the same.  
Randomisation 
Randomization (on a 1:1 basis) was conducted. Randomisation was stratified by geographic region, 
tumour KRAS status (mutant or wild type), and time to disease progression (TTP) after commencing 
first line treatment (<6 months versus ≥ 6 months). 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study.  
Statistical methods 
Primary analysis: OS was analysed in the ITT population, consisting of all randomized patients, using 
the p-value from a log-rank test stratified by geographic region (North America vs. Europe vs. all other 
regions), KRAS status (mutant vs. wild-type), and time to disease progression after beginning first-line 
treatment (<6 months vs. ≥6 months).  
Survival curves and hazard ratio were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier methodology and stratified 
Cox regression model, respectively.  
OS will not be censored in cases where study treatment results in tumour regression allowing for 
potentially curative surgical resection and/or radiofrequency ablation.  
Supportive analysis: restricted mean difference in OS between the treatment groups and its 95% CI, 
with the area under the Kaplan-Meier survival curve calculated up to the minimum across treatment 
arms of the maximum observed (i.e., event or censored) time. 
Interim analyses and DMC: There will be 2 interim futility analyses. The first one, based on PFS, will be 
performed when 122 PFS events are observed among approximately 250 patients. The second one, 
based on OS, will be performed when 30% (227) of the OS events are observed. Although no stopping 
for efficacy will be allowed, formally alpha=0.00001 (one-sided) will be spend at the futility analysis of 
OS, so that the final OS analysis will be at one-sided significance level 0.02499.  
An independent DMC with statistician other than the trial statistician will perform these interim 
analyses and additional analysis for safety. Efficacy data provided only consists of Kaplan-Meier curves 
and hazard ratios (PFS, OS), and estimated difference with 95%-CI (ORR, DCR). 
The comparison of PFS using the same method as that for the primary analysis of OS was considered 
confirmatory only in case of significant results for OS analysis (that is, as a gatekept analysis so as not 
to inflate the type I error rate). The comparison of ORR was also considered confirmatory only in case 
of significant results for OS and PFS analysis.

Population 
Recruitment 
Enrolment  started  on  13  December  2010  and  the  last  patient  was  randomized  on  23  August,  2013, 
who completed study treatment on 14 June, 2014. The data cut-off date was 17 July 2014. Follow-up 
for survival was scheduled for up to 24 months from randomization. 
Conduct of the study 
The database was locked on 22 August 2014. The original protocol was issued on 22 July 2010. The 
protocol was amended 5 times (before first patient in trial: 05 August 2010; 07 October 2010; during 
recruitment: 31 May 2011; 25 September 2012; three months before the last patient completed study 
treatment: 26 March 2014).  
Patients were enrolled under all Protocol Versions: (a) to (e). Only the main changes are described. 
• 
Protocol Amendment (a) (05 August 2010) 
Sponsor of the study was changed; References to the investigator’s brochure (IB) were clarified by 
specifying the ramucirumab IB. 
• 
Protocol Amendment (b) (07 October 2010) 
As originally written, the protocol mandated that blood chemistries be determined by a central 
laboratory. The protocol was revised to permit the use of local chemistry laboratories to make on-
study dosing decisions; The use of NCI-CTCAE v. 4.02 was revised to NCI-CTCAE v. 4.0; Consistent 
with RECIST 1.1, two sections of the protocol were updated to reflect that radiographic confirmation of 
complete response and partial response with repeat confirmatory radiographic imaging was not 
required.

• 
Protocol Amendment (c) (31 May 2011) 
Section 5 was changed to include additional nonclinical data that provided proof-of-concept for the 
conduct of study I4T-MC-JVBB; Inclusion Criterion [4] was changed to permit use of up to 2 
fluoropyrimidines as part of the first-line treatment for metastatic disease; Provisions for windows 
around study treatment infusion times and to allow dose capping; according to a maximum patient 
body surface area were added to Section 9.1; ; Section 9.5.1 was changed to clarify the dose 
modifications of investigational drug in response to Grade 3 and Grade 4 AEs; update the definition of 
febrile neutropenia in order to make it consistent with the latest version of the NCI-CTCAE; The 
baseline radiographic disease assessment was changed from within 14 days to within 21 days of 
randomization; The storage time for plasma and whole blood samples was changed; The pre-specified 
subgroup analysis of route of administration of fluoropyrimidine during first-line treatment was 
removed in accordance with revisions to inclusion criterion 4; Attachment 3 (Clinical Laboratory Tests) 
was revised to permit collection of an automated white blood cell differential. 
• 
Protocol Amendment (d) (25 September 2012) 
Based on the independent DMC recommendations from the ramucirumab CP12-0919 study, 
information on liver injury/liver failure was added; a ramucirumab discontinuation criterion and an 
exclusion criterion were included; Information concerning congestive heart failure, surgery and wound 
healing, and reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome were added due to emerging data 
during the development of ramucirumab; The thyroid-stimulating hormone test was added to collect 
information on thyroid function during ramucirumab treatment. 
• 
Protocol Amendment (e) (26 March 2014) 
The biomarker and analysis endpoints were moved from “Secondary Objectives,” and listed separately 
in “Other Objectives”. Gatekeeping was added in the Statistical Methods section for OS, PFS, and ORR. 
The type I error control was extended from OS to OS, PFS, ORR (three months before the last patient 
had the last dose).

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint - Overall Survival  
At the time of the data cut-off, a total of 769 death events (71.7%) had occurred, 372 in the 
ramucirumab+FOLFIRI arm and 397 in the placebo+FOLFIRI arm (Table below). Ramucirumab in 
combination with FOLFIRI reduced the risk of death in this population by 15.6% (HR = 0.844; 95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 0.730, 0.976; p=0.0219; (two-sided 0.04998)) (Figure 5), resulting in a 1.6-
month longer median survival (13.3 months vs. 11.7 months).

Patient-Reported Outcomes 
Overall, the score for global health decreased from 67.6 at baseline to 57.3 at the summary visit for 
patients in the ramucirumab +FOLFIRI arm and from 67.5 to 58.7 in the placebo+FOLFIRI arm. The 
Summary Visit was ≤7 days after the documentation of PD, cessation of treatment due to toxicity, 
withdrawal of consent, or other treatment discontinuation criteria were met.

constipation) and were statistically significantly different.  
The time to deterioration regarding global health was 1.5 months shorter for the 
ramucirumab+FOLFIRI arm (2.50 vs. 3.98 months; Figure 11). As observed in the response analysis 
described above, after the first 2 post baseline assessments, the percentage of patients with reported 
stable or improved scores were similar between arms, suggesting that the initial decrease in QoL in the 
ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI treatment arm was transient. Therefore, a post-hoc alternate definition of 
deterioration in QoL was explored, as “time to sustained deterioration”. Median time to sustained 
deterioration was similar between arms (7.69 (6.31- 8.61 versus 7.52 ( 6.51, 8.15) months. There 
was a statistically significant difference for only 3 scales: emotional functioning, fatigue, and appetite 
loss.

Baseline scores for the index and visual analog scale were similar between treatment arms. On-
therapy scores were relatively unchanged except for greater decreases at the first protocol-scheduled 
assessment for patients in the ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI arm, which returned to baseline at the next 
assessment.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The evidence of efficacy of ramucirumab in patients with mCRC is based on the results of one pivotal 
study, the RAISE study. According to EMA guidelines, the exceptional event of authorising based on 
one single pivotal study is acceptable (CPMP/EWP/2330/99), but the study has to be particularly 
compelling with respect to internal and external validity, clinical relevance, statistical significance, data 
quality, and internal consistency.  
RAISE was a global, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter Phase 3 study that 
evaluated the efficacy of ramucirumab versus placebo, each in combination with FOLFIRI, in 1072 
patients with mCRC whose disease had progressed during or after first-line combination therapy of 
bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, and a fluoropyrimidine. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/69143/2016  
Page 46/73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The choice of control (placebo+FOLFIRI) is considered appropriate, since an irinotecan-based regimen 
can be considered at the time of start of the RAISE study to reflect the clinical practice as a second line 
treatment after an oxaliplatin-based regimen for patients with mCRC, whose disease progressed after 
combination treatment with bevacizumab, oxaliplatin and a fluoropyrimidine. Because the patients 
studied in RAISE were still eligible for treatment with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy along with 
anti-VEGF therapy, these patients are not candidates for treatment with regorafenib. For patients with 
KRAS wild-type tumour, these patients will need to be treated with an anti-EGFR inhibitor, such as 
cetuximab, before they meet the eligibility for regorafenib.  
Overall, the statistical methods were considered standard for time to event endpoints and acceptable. 
With regards to protocol amendments, the first two protocol amendment (a and b) were before entry 
of the first patient in the trial and are therefore considered not to have affected the conduct or analysis 
of the trial. Amendment c (31 March 2011) included the change of inclusion criterion 4 to permit use of 
up to 2 fluoropyrimidines as part of first line treatment for metastatic disease. Since the number of 
lines of first line treatment potentially impacts survival for patients with mCRC, this modification may 
have influenced the outcome. Other protocol amendments were not considered to affect the conduct or 
outcome of the study. Since all of the changes conducted regarding important endpoints were before 
database lock and unblinding, hence without knowledge of the data, this is considered acceptable. 
Nevertheless, extending type I error control from OS to OS, PFS, ORR (hierarchical testing) so late in 
the trial is noteworthy.  
OS was the primary endpoint of the study, which is considered appropriate. Secondary endpoints were 
PFS (according to investigator), ORR and patient-reported quality-of-life outcomes and also considered 
acceptable. 
Overall, 43.8% of patients were randomized in Europe, 26.7% in North America, and 29.5% in other 
regions. The majority of patients (76.3%) had disease progression ≥6 months after beginning first-line 
therapy. The stratification factors were evenly distributed between both arms. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics and prior treatment appeared largely comparable between 
the two study arms, except for sex (more females [46.1% vs. 39.2%] in the ramucirumab+FOLFIRI 
arm), the number of patients with ≥3 metastases (lower [29.3% vs. 34.0%] in the 
ramucirumab+FOLFIRI arm) and for age (more patients [9.7% vs. 7.9%] in the ramucirumab+FOLFIRI 
arm were 75 years of age or older).  
Patients with ECOG score ≥2 were excluded from the pivotal study, therefore the safety and efficacy of 
Cyramza in this patient population is unknown (see Section 5.1). 
No information was provided about the number of first line treatments received as a repeat treatment 
after lasting response to initial palliative treatment. The number of treatment cycles was not recorded 
but only the duration of first line treatment. The median duration of treatment to 1st line therapy 
appeared balanced between the two study arms (254 days in the Cyramza containing arm versus 241 
days in the population in the control arm of RAISE). However, the median duration of 1st line 
treatment in RAISE was almost double as could be expected based on the standard first line treatment, 
showing that the patients tested must have had generally relatively non-aggressive disease. The 
difference between the median duration of disease (as defined by the interval between the moment of 
initial diagnosis and randomisation) in the two arms in RAISE was 1.32 months in favour of 
ramucirumab (median duration of disease: 14.3 versus 13.0 months; mean duration 20.4 versus 19.4 
months, for ramucirumab versus placebo group, respectively). However, sensitivity analyses adjusting 
for baseline prognostic factors did not reveal major differences in the treatment effect associated with 
ramucirumab.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Ramucirumab in combination with FOLFIRI reduced the risk of death in this population by 15.6% (HR 
= 0.844; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.730, 0.976; p=0.0219), resulting in a 1.6-month longer 
median survival (13.3 months vs. 11.7 months).  
Pre-specified analyses for OS and PFS by stratification factors were performed. The HR of OS was 0.82 
(95% CI: 0.67 to 1.0) in patients with a KRAS wild type tumour, and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.73 to 1.09) in 
patients with a KRAS mutant tumour. For patients with TTP ≥ 6 months after commencing first-line 
treatment the HR of OS was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.73 to 1.01), and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.64 to 1.13) in patients 
with TTP < 6 months after commencing first-line treatment.  
Pre-specified subgroup analyses for both PFS and OS according to age (<65 and ≥65 years), gender, 
race, ECOG PS (0 or ≥ 1), number of organs involved, liver metastases only, site of primary tumour 
(colon or rectum), carcinoembryonic antigen levels (<200μg/mL, ≥200μg/mL), all showed a treatment 
effect favouring Cyramza plus FOLFIRI treatment over placebo plus FOLFIRI.  
In 32 of the 33 pre-specified sub-group analyses for OS, the HR was < 1.0. The one sub-group with 
HR > 1 was for patients with disease progression from start of first-line bevacizumab treatment of < 3 
months (HR 1.02 [95% CI: 0.68 to 1.55]). This one sub-group is a group which can be considered to 
have aggressive disease that is relatively refractory to first-line treatment (see SmPC section 5.1). 
In addition, subgroup results showed that the estimate of treatment effect favours the ramucirumab 
plus FOLFIRI arm, although the effect for patients recruited in Europe (the largest region in the RAISE 
study) was not statistically significant (HR 0.893; CI 0.724-1.103). A causal and clear link between 
lack of efficacy with any of the subgroups assessed is difficult to establish, apart from early treatment 
in aggressive disease.  
Furthermore, the relevance of KRAS mutation status remains uncertain as differences in outcome were 
reported (2.5 and 1.4 months for KRAS wt and mutant), respectively.  
High VEGF and/or VEGFR expression have been associated with poor prognosis in a variety of cancers. 
However, VEGF and VEGFR expression in RAISE have not been reported. 
A causal link between lack of efficacy with any of the subgroups assessed is difficult to establish. This 
raises the question whether benefit can be increased by further selection of the patients, in particular 
on the basis of biomarkers. Therefore, in order to investigate the potential correlation between 
biomarker measures (VEGF-C. VEGF-D, sVEGFR1, sVEGFR2 and sVEGFR3 from plasma, VEGFR2 IHC, 
additional KRAS, NRAS and BRAF mutations) and efficacy outcome (PFS, OS), the MAH will submit the 
results of a biomarker assay from the RAISE translational research population (see Annex II 
condition). In view of the uncertainty to address, the conduct of this study is considered a post 
authorisation efficacy study (PAES) in accordance with the following criteria from the Commission 
Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 357/2014 “c) uncertainties with respect to the efficacy of a medicinal 
product in certain sub-populations that could not be resolved prior to marketing authorisation and 
require further clinical evidence.” 
Overall, the observed OS gain is modest but could be considered of potential clinical relevance.  
More than half of the patients (55.0%) received at least 1 additional systemic anticancer therapy after 
discontinuation from study therapy (54.1% in the ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI arm and 56.0% in the 
placebo plus FOLFIRI arm). Since the use of Post discontinuation anticancer treatments were balanced 
and the usage of specific anticancer treatments was similar between treatment arms, the use of post-

Page 48/73 
 
 
 
 
 
discontinuation anticancer therapy is unlikely to have had an important effect on the OS benefit 
observed in favour of the ramucirumab+FOLFIRI arm. 
Since a high proportion of patients (21.7%) in the ramucirumab+FOLFIRI arm suffered from 
neutropenia and half of these patients discontinued treatment (FOLFIRI mostly), the MAH was 
requested to provide OS results stratified by the presence of neutropenia. In both treatment arms, 
patients who experienced neutropenia had a longer median OS compared to patients who did not 
experience neutropenia. The median OS in patients with any-grade neutropenia was greater in the 
ramucirumab (16.1 months) than in the placebo arm (12.6 months). Median OS in patients who did 
not experience neutropenia was 10.7 months in both arms (see SmPC section 5.1). 
Treatment results for PFS were consistent with the OS results. Treatment with ramucirumab plus 
FOLFIRI resulted in a statistically significant improvement in PFS (HR = 0.793; 95% CI: 0.697, 0.903; 
p=0.0005), corresponding 1.2 months increase in median PFS (Median PFS 5.7 vs. 4.5 months). No 
difference between arms was observed for ORR or disease control rate.  
The statistical significance, magnitude of treatment effect, and robustness of the main PFS analysis 
results were supported by pre-specified sensitivity analyses.  
The results of subgroup analyses of PFS consistently favour the ramucirumab+FOLFIRI arm. This was 
also observed for patients with time from bevacizumab first dose to disease progression <3 months, 
although the effect size suggested a small benefit (HR 0.952 (CI 0.646-1.404). Also, in contrast to the 
subgroup result for OS, a significant effect on PFS was also observed for patients recruited in Europe 
(HR 0.804; CI 0.666-0.971). 
No difference in the ORR was observed between the two treatment arms.  
Regarding quality of life, a shorter time to deterioration of 1.5 months in global health was observed 
for patients in the ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI arm as assed by the EORTC QLC-30. This observation 
was confirmed by EQ5D assessments.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The OS results showed a statistically significant improvement in OS for the ramucirumab + FOLFIRI 
arm resulting in a 1.6-month longer median survival (13.3 months vs. 11.7 months). The OS benefit 
was supported by modest but statistically significant improvement in median PFS by 1.2 months. 
A causal link between lack of efficacy with any of the subgroups assessed is difficult to establish. This 
raises the question whether benefit can be increased by further selection of the patients, in particular 
on the basis of biomarkers. 
Due to the above uncertainties with respect to the efficacy of Cyramza in certain sub-populations, the 
CHMP considers that following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
Post authorisation efficacy study (PAES): In order to investigate the potential correlation between 
biomarker measures (VEGF-C. VEGF-D, sVEGFR1, sVEGFR2 and sVEGFR3 from plasma, VEGFR2 IHC, 
additional KRAS, NRAS and BRAF mutations) and efficacy outcome (PFS, OS), the MAH should submit 
the results of a biomarker assay from the RAISE translational research population.  
- Correlation with VEGF-C. VEGF-D, sVEGFR1, sVEGFR2 and sVEGFR3 from plasma, VEGFR2 IHC will 
be submitted by 30 June 2016 
- Correlation with additional KRAS, NRAS and BRAF mutations will be submitted by 30 September 2016

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
In the second line treatment of advanced gastric carcinoma or gastro-oesophageal junction 
adenocarcinoma, the overall safety profile of ramucirumab (Cyramza) monotherapy was more or less 
consistent across studies and in line with other agents targeting inhibition of the VEGF/VEGFR axis, 
Hypertension, proteinuria, gastrointestinal symptoms being most prominent, whereas haematological 
toxicities were limited. In combination with paclitaxel, a higher incidence of fatigue, leukopenia, 
neutropenia, neuropathy, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, peripheral oedema, hypertension, epistaxis and 
stomatitis were observed. AE grade ≥3 events, occurring in at least 10% of patients and at a higher 
rate in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm were leukopenia, neutropenia, hypertension and fatigue in 
the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm as compared to paclitaxel. 
Patient exposure 
Table 21. Completed Studies Included in the Summary of Clinical Safety 
Overall, 660 patients with mCRC were exposed to ramucirumab in company-sponsored trials at a dose 
of 8 mg/kg every 2 wks, 529 of which participated in the pivotal RAISE study (Table 21), in which 
treatment with ramucirumab was combined with FOLFIRI. In addition to a number of small phase 2 
trials including patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, the Applicant included patients with 
hepatocellular carcinoma participating in a phase 3 trial in the safety database. Previously conducted 
studies, including the pivotal studies conducted in patients with advanced gastric cancer or gastro-
esophageal junction adenocarcinoma and in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), were not included in the safety database for unknown reasons. 
Of 1072 patients randomized to treatment in RAISE, 1057 (98.6%) received at least 1 dose of any 
study therapy (529 of 536 patients randomized to receive ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI and 528 of 536

randomized to receive placebo plus FOLFIRI). Fifteen randomized patients (1.4%) did not receive any 
treatment (8 [1.5%] patients in the ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI arm and 7 [1.3%] patients in the 
placebo plus FOLFIRI arm, for reasons listed in Figure 4). Thus, the safety population consisted of 529 
patients in the ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI arm and 528 patients in the placebo plus FOLFIRI arm. The 
median duration of treatment (all components of study treatment) received was similar between 
treatment arms (20.4 weeks for the ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI arm with a median of 9.0 infusions 
received vs. 18.3 weeks for the placebo plus FOLFIRI arm with a median of 8.0 infusions received 
(Table 22).

As of the data cutoff date (17 July 2014), 33 patients (17 patients [3.2%] in the ramucirumab plus 
FOLFIRI arm and 16 patients [3.0%] in the placebo plus FOLFIRI arm) were receiving study treatment. 
The majority of patients discontinued treatment due to disease progression (63.1% in the 
ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI arm; 77.8% in the placebo plus FOLFIRI arm). The percentage of patients 
who discontinued treatment (any study drug) due to AEs was 29.1% for the ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI 
arm and 13.3% for the placebo plus FOLFIRI arm.

Adverse events of special interest 
The AESIs are potentially associated with other agents that inhibit VEFG- or VEGF Receptor 2- 
mediated angiogenesis, or that were observed in preclinical or earlier clinical studies of ramucirumab. 
The following AEs are considered to be AESIs for ramucirumab: IRRs, hypertension, proteinuria, ATEs, 
VTEs, bleeding/hemorrhagic events, GI perforation, CHF, wound healing complications, fistula, liver 
failure/liver injury, and reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS). 
Hypertension 
Both any grade (25.7% vs. 8.5%) and ≥grade 3 hypertension (10.8% vs. 2.8%) occurred more 
frequently in the ramucirumab+FOLFIRI arm, whereas 62.2% of patients in the ramucirumab+FOLFIRI 
arm and 54.2% in the placebo+FOLFIRI arm received concomitant treatment with antihypertensives. A 
total of 22 patients (4.2%) in the ramucirumab+FOLFIRI arm had dose modifications or 
discontinuations, compared to 1 (0.2% in the placebo arm. 
Proteinuria 
Treatment-emergent adverse events of proteinuria occurred at a higher incidence in the ramucirumab 
plus FOLFIRI arm than in the placebo plus FOLFIRI arm (17.0% vs. 4.5%, respectively). The incidence 
of Grade 3 proteinuria was higher in the ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI arm than the placebo plus FOLFIRI 
arm (2.8% vs. 0.2%, respectively). Nephrotic syndrome was reported in 3 patients (2 patients with 
Grade 3 proteinuria and 1 patient with Grade 4 proteinuria [reported as an SAE]), all in the 
ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI arm. 
Nineteen patients (3.6%) in the ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI arm had dose modifications or 
discontinuations of any study drug due to proteinuria, compared to 6 patients (1.1%) in the placebo 
plus FOLFIRI arm. Of these, 8 patients (1.5%) in the ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI arm and 2 patients 
(0.4%) in the placebo plus FOLFIRI arm discontinued any study drug due to a TEAE of proteinuria. 
Independent of treatment arm, a higher incidence of any-grade proteinuria was observed in Asian 
patients than in White patients. The incidence of any grade proteinuria in Asian patients was 38.2% in 
the ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI arm versus 10.7% in the placebo plus FOLFIRI arm. The incidence of 
any grade proteinuria in White patients was 11.3% in the ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI arm versus 2.7% 
in the placebo plus FOLFIRI arm. This higher incidence of proteinuria in Asian patients compared to 
White patients was primarily due to Grade 1 and Grade 2 events. The incidence of Grade 3 proteinuria 
was lower in both groups (6.4% vs. 0 for Asian patients and 2.0% vs. 0.2% for White patients for 
ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI vs. placebo plus FOLFIRI treatment arms, respectively). Of note, there

were 3 events of nephrotic syndrome reported in Asian patients, of which 1 event was reported as 
Grade 4 (although not defined in CTCAE V4.0), in the ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI arm. There were no 
events of nephrotic syndrome reported in White patients in the ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI arm. 
Neutropenia/Febrile Neutropenia and Infection 
Neutropenia was among the most frequently reported AEs in both treatment arms, with a higher any-
grade incidence observed in the ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI arm (311 patients [58.8%] vs. 241 
patients [45.6%], respectively). The majority of neutropenia TEAEs, regardless of treatment arm, were 
Grade 3 or Grade 4 events. The incidence of Grade 3 neutropenia was higher in the ramucirumab plus 
FOLFIRI arm than in the placebo plus FOLFIRI arm (28.2% vs. 14.6%, respectively). The incidence of 
Grade 4 was similar between the ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI arm and the placebo plus FOLFIRI arm 
(10.2% vs. 8.7%, respectively). There were no Grade 5 events. Treatment-emergent adverse events 
under the SOC of infections and infestations, any grade, were reported for 37.4% of patients in the 
ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI arm and 29.2% of patients in the placebo plus FOLFIRI arm. The incidences 
of Grade ≥3 infection events were 8.3% in the ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI arm and 7.4% in the 
placebo plus FOLFIRI arm. The percentage of patients with a hospitalization due to febrile neutropenia 
was also low in both treatment arms (2.3% in the ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI arm vs. 1.5% in the 
placebo plus FOLFIRI arm), suggesting that the clinical impact on safety as result of the increased rate 
of neutropenia in the ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI arm was limited. However, the proportion of patients 
discontinuing any study drug due to neutrophil count decreased or neutropenia was higher in the 
ramucirumab+FOLFIRI arm (7.0% vs. 3.4% and 5.5% vs. 1.9%, respectively).  
Thrombocytopenia 
The incidence of thrombocytopenia was higher in the ramucirumab+FOLFIRI arm (28.4% vs. 13.6%), 
although the incidence of grade≥3 thrombocytopenia was rather low (3.0% vs. 0.8%). More dose 
adjustments and discontinuations occurred in the ramucirumab+FOLFIRI arm. The frequency of 
patients experiencing any drug dose adjustment was 8.5% in the ramucirumab group vs. 3.2% in the 
placebo group (regardless of causality).  
Infusion related reactions (IRR) 
Any-grade IRR was reported for 31 (5.9%) patients in the ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI arm and 16 
(3.0%) patients in the placebo plus FOLFIRI arm. Four patients (0.8%) experienced Grade 3 events in 
the ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI arm and 2 patients (0.4%) experienced Grade 3 IRR in the placebo plus 
FOLFIRI arm. There were no patients with Grade 4 or Grade 5 IRRs in either treatment arm. 
Bleeding/Haemorrhage Events 
In RAISE, a higher percentage of patients experienced bleeding events (any grade) in the 
ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI arm than the placebo plus FOLFIRI arm (43.9% vs. 22.7%, respectively). 
The incidence of Grade 3 or higher bleeding events was low in both treatment arms (2.5% vs. 1.7%). 
The majority of bleeding events in the ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI arm and the placebo plus FOLFIRI 
arm were epistaxis (33.5% and 15.0%, respectively). There were no Grade ≥3 epistaxis events in 
either arm. 
A higher incidence of any grade GI haemorrhage events occurred in the ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI 
arm than the placebo plus FOLFIRI arm (12.3% vs. 6.8%, respectively). The incidence of severe 
(Grade ≥3) GI haemorrhage events was low in both treatment arms (1.9% in the ramucirumab plus 
FOLFIRI arm and 1.1% in the placebo plus FOLFIRI arm). Fourteen patients (2.6%) in the

ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI arm and 6 patients (1.1%) in the placebo plus FOLFIRI arm had dose 
modifications or discontinuations (referred to as dose adjustments in the table) of any drug due to any 
bleeding/ hemorrhage events. 
Table 26. Gastrointestinal Haemorrhage Events, Safety Population, RAISE study 
The overall incidence of GI perforation in the study was low in both treatment arms (. Grade 3 or 
higher GI perforation events were identified in both treatment arms (see Table 27).

Table 27. Gastrointestinal Perforations, study RAISE 
In the Phase 2 combination studies, low-grade epistaxis and other bleeding events were observed in 
Study JVCB and in Study JVBH. One patient in Study JVBH had a Grade 3 bleeding/haemorrhage 
event. In Study JCDB, 24 of 52 patients in the ramucirumab plus mFOLFOX-6 arm had Grade 1-2 
events and 1 patient had Grade 3 bleeding/haemorrhage events. In the mFOLFOX-6 only arm, 9 
patients had bleeding/haemorrhage events (all Grade 1-2 events). No patients in any of the Phase 2 
combination studies had Grade 4 or Grade 5 bleeding/haemorrhage events. In the Phase 2 
combination studies, only in study JCDB, one patient in the mFOLFOX-6 only arm had a Grade 1-2 GI 
perforation.  
In REACH, any grade bleeding events were observed at a higher incidence in the ramucirumab arm 
than the placebo arm; however, the incidence of Grade ≥3 events was similar between treatment 
arms. The most frequently reported bleeding event in the ramucirumab arm was epistaxis, and its 
incidence was higher than in the placebo arm. No Grade ≥3 epistaxis events occurred in either 
treatment arm. In patients with chronic liver disease, there is a potential increased risk of GI 
haemorrhage. The ramucirumab and placebo arms were similar in the incidence of GI haemorrhage 
events of any grade or Grade ≥3. In the ramucirumab arm, 1 patient had a Grade 4 bleeding event (GI 
haemorrhage) and 1 patient had a Grade 5 bleeding event (oesophageal varices haemorrhage). In the 
placebo arm, 1 patient had a Grade 5 bleeding event (oesophageal varices haemorrhage). No events 
of GI perforation were observed. 
Liver failure/liver injury 
In RAISE, the overall incidence of any-grade liver-related events (laboratory and clinical) was similar 
between treatment arms (11.5% vs. 9.5%). The incidence of Grade ≥3 liver failure/liver injury, 
including clinical and laboratory events, was higher in the ramucirumab+FOLFIRI arm (4.9% vs. 
3.9%). In the Phase 2 combination studies, 2 of 25 patients in Study JVCB had liver failure/liver injury 
events (both reported as Grade 1-2). In Study JVBH, 6 of 48 patients in the ramucirumab plus 
mFOLFOX-6 arm had liver failure/liver injury events. Two patients had Grade 3 events and 1 patient 
had a Grade 4 liver failure/liver injury event (gamma-glutamyltransferase increased). In Study JCDB, 7 
of 52 patients in the ramucirumab plus mFOLFOX-6 arm had Grade 1-2 events and 1 patient had a 
Grade 3 liver failure/liver injury event (aspartate aminotransferase increased; blood bilirubin 
increased). In the mFOLFOX-6 only arm, 5 patients had Grade 1-2 events and 2 patients had a Grade 
3 liver failure/liver injury event (AST increased; blood bilirubin increased). In REACH, the incidence of 
any-grade clinical and laboratory liver failure/liver injury events was higher in the ramucirumab arm 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/69143/2016  
Page 57/73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
than in the placebo arm; however, when adjusted for duration of exposure to study treatment, there 
was no difference between treatment arms. There was no difference in the incidence of Grade 3-4 liver 
failure/injury in the ramucirumab arm compared with the placebo arm. Five of 140 patients in the 
ramucirumab arm and 3 of 103 patients in the placebo arm had a Grade 5 liver failure/injury event. 
Fistula 
In RAISE, the overall incidence of fistula was low in both treatment arms (0.8% vs. 0.4%) and there 
were no Grade ≥3 events reported in either treatment arm. No events of fistula were observed in the 
Phase 2 studies (Studies JVCB, JVBH, and JCDB) or in the Phase 3 study (REACH). 
Wound Healing Complications 
In RAISE, the overall incidence of wound healing complications was low in both treatment arms (1.3% 
vs. 0.2%). All but one wound healing complication event (Grade 3 wound dehiscence in the 
ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI arm) were Grade 1-2. In the Phase 2 combination studies, no events of 
wound healing were observed in Studies JVCB and JCDB. In Study JVBH, 1 patient treated with 
ramucirumab plus mFOLFOX-6 arm had Grade 1-2 impaired healing.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Similar percentages of patients in the ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI arm and the placebo plus FOLFIRI 
arm, respectively, had any-grade TE-SAEs (35.7% vs. 31.1%) and Grade ≥3 TE-SAEs (30.6% vs. 
26.7%). The most frequently reported TE-SAEs in the ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI arm compared to the 
placebo plus FOLFIRI arm, respectively, were diarrhea (3.6% vs. 3.2%), intestinal obstruction (3.0% 
vs. 2.5%), and febrile neutropenia (2.8% vs. 1.5%) (Table 28a).  
Overall, deaths that occurred while on treatment and up to 30 days after the last dose of study 
treatment occurred at similar frequency in both treatment arms (4.3% in the ramucirumab plus 
FOLFIRI arm vs. 5.5% in the placebo plus FOLFIRI arm). The incidence of deaths due to AE was low 
and similar in the ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI arm and the placebo plus FOLFIRI arm (2.5% vs. 3.4%, 
respectively). The most common causes of Grade 5 (fatal) TEAEs by SOC were GI disorders (10 in the 
ramucirumab+F and 4 in the placebo+F group), infections and infestations (4 and 3), and cardiac 
disorders (1 and 6).

Laboratory findings 
Analysis of the laboratory shift tables indicated that decreases in the neutrophil and platelet counts, 
and increases in AST, ALT, and bilirubin were observed, consistent with the incidence of neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia, and abnormal laboratory terms for the AESI Liver Failure/Liver Injury in the study.  
Safety in special populations 
Age 
A similar proportion of patients with >= 1 TEAE was observed between patients <65 years and 
patients ≥65 years of age, but more patients ≥65 years had >=grade 3 TEAE (83.7% vs. 68.4%) 
compared to patients <65 years (75.9% vs. 58.2%). 
Adverse events in Asian patients 
A higher frequency of ≥grade 3 AEs was observed in Asian compared to white patients (88.2% vs. 
76.8%); Most notable were hypertension and neutropenia and proteinuria. The overall incidence of 
hypertension in Asian patients was higher (39.1%) compared to White patients (22.5%) but similar in 
the placebo plus FOLFIRI arm (Asian [10.7%] vs. White [8.0%] patients. Independent of treatment 
arm, a higher incidence of any grade neutropenia (consolidated term) was observed in Asian patients. 
The incidence of neutropenia any grade in Asian patients in the ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI arm vs. 
placebo plus FOLFIRI arm was 80.0% vs. 59.2%, respectively. The incidence and magnitude of 
difference of Grade 3 neutropenia was also higher in Asian (46.4%vs. 26.2%) patients as compared to 
White (24.0% vs. 11.9%) patients. A higher rate of discontinuations of treatment was also observed in 
Asian patients (45.5% vs. 21.4%) compared to white patients (25.3% vs. 11.7%). Patients who had a 
known history or clinical evidence of Gilbert’s Syndrome, or was known to have any of the following 
genotypes: UGT1A1*6/*6, nUGT1A1*28/*28, or UGT1A1*6/*28, known to be related to toxicity for 
irinotecan in Asian patients, were not eligible for participation in the RAISE study.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
As noted above, the percentage of patients who experienced at least 1 TEAE leading to discontinuation 
of any study drug was higher in the ramucirumab + FOLFIRI arm, although FOLFIRI was usually 
discontinued and ramucirumab rarely (Table 23).

Table 32. Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuations of Study Therapy Occurring in ≥1% of 
Patients in the Ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI arm RAISE 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The presented safety database included few small phase 2 studies in patients with mCRC and the 
pivotal RAISE study. It should be noted that almost all patients in the pivotal study received another 
VEGF inhibitor in the 1st line (bevacizumab) that has led to a pre-selection of patients favouring the 
safety of ramucirumab. This reflects the applied indication (see SmPC section 4.1). 
In the RAISE study, the median duration of treatment (all components of study treatment) received 
was 20.4 weeks for the ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI arm and 18.3 weeks for the placebo+FOLFIRI arm.  
Treatment with ramucirumab+ FOLFIRI resulted in a similar frequency of patients with ≥1 TEAE. 
However, a higher frequency of Grade ≥3 TEAEs was observed (79.0% vs. 62.3%, respectively). Also, 
the percentage of patients who experienced at least 1 TEAE leading to discontinuation of any study 
drug was higher in the ram+FOLFIRI arm (29.1% vs. 13.3%), although FOLFIRI was usually 
discontinued and ramucirumab rarely. 
Overall, the most common adverse reactions observed in ramucirumab-treated patients were 
diarrhoea (59.7%), nausea (49.5%), fatigue (46.7%), decreased appetite (37.4%), neutropenia 
(35.5%), epistaxis (33.5%) and stomatitis (30.8%). The most common ≥grade 3 AEs were 
neutropenia (21.7%), neutrophil count decreased (17.4%), diarrhoea (10.8%) and hypertension 
(10.8%).  
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/69143/2016  
Page 62/73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The most notable adverse events occurring at a higher frequency compared to the placebo+FOLFIRI 
arm were epistaxis (+19%), hypertension (+17%), proteinuria (+12%), peripheral oedema (+11%), 
stomatitis (+10%), decreased appetite (+10%). Neutropenia (+10%) and hypertension (+8%) were 
the most notable ≥grade 3 AEs occurring with a higher frequency in the ramucirumab+FOLFIRI arm. 
This toxicity profile is comparable with that observed in the pivotal study supporting marketing 
authorization of Cyramza for advanced gastric cancer in combination with paclitaxel, although the 
difference in discontinuations due to adverse events was smaller (31.2% vs. 24.3%) and in the pivotal 
study submitted to obtain marketing authorization for non-small cell lung cancer in combination with 
docetaxel (9.3% vs. 5.2%). An AE with a substantially higher frequency (+7%), not previously 
reported with ramucirumab use was Palmar-plantar-erythrodysesthesia (PPE).  
It is noted that a substantially more favourable toxicity profile was observed when ramucirumab was 
used as monotherapy in the REGARD trial, where the frequency of neutropenia amounted to only 
3.8%. 
The incidence of serious related AEs, such as gastrointestinal bleeding events (12.3% vs. 6.8% for any 
grade; 1.9% vs. 1.2% for ≥grade 3), GI perforations (9 [1.7%] vs. 3 [0.6%] ≥grade 3 AE, of which 4 
[0.8%] vs. 0 were grade 5 events) and fistula (4 [0.8%] vs 2 [0.4%] for any grade and no ≥grade 3 
AE observed), was also increased in the ramucirumab+ FOLFIRI arm. The incidence of Grade 3 
neutropenia was higher in the ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI arm than in the placebo plus FOLFIRI arm 
(28.2% vs. 14.6%, respectively) and a higher frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events under 
the SOC of infections and infestations, any grade, were reported in the ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI arm 
(37.4% vs. 29.2%), although the percentage of patients with a hospitalization due to febrile 
neutropenia was low in both treatment arms (2.3% vs. 1.5%). Nonetheless, the proportion of patients 
discontinuing any study drug due to neutropenia was higher in the ramucirumab+FOLFIRI arm (12.5% 
vs. 5.3%).  
Ramucirumab is an antiangiogenic therapy and may increase the risk of gastrointestinal perforations. 
Cases of gastrointestinal perforation have been reported in patients treated with ramucirumab in study 
RAISE including four lethal perforations. Severe gastrointestinal haemorrhage, including fatal events, 
were also reported in patients with mCRC treated with ramucirumab in combination with FOLFIRI. 
These events are adequately covered in the current SmPC of Cyramza (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8).  
Stomatitis was reported in 30.8% in the ramucirumab arm versus 20.8% in the placebo arm. The 
SmPC has been revised to reflect that an increased incidence of stomatitis was reported in patients 
receiving ramucirumab in combination with chemotherapy as compared to patients treated with 
placebo plus chemotherapy. Symptomatic treatment should be instituted promptly if stomatitis occurs 
(see SmPC section 4.4). 
The proportion of patients discontinuing treatment due to any AE was also substantially higher in the 
ramucirumab+FOLFIRI arm (29.1% vs. 13.3%), suggesting limited tolerability of the study treatment, 
although FOLFIRI was generally discontinued rather than ramucirumab. Although the toxicity of the 
combination may be managed by adapting the dose and content of the FOLFIRI treatment or even 
discontinuation, there is an increase in drop-outs in the ramucirumab arm. Posology adjustments for 
ramucirumab are already included in section 4.2 of the SmPC. In addition, dose reductions for 
individual components of FOLFIRI may be made for specific toxicities. Dose modifications of each 
component of FOLFIRI should be made independently and are provided in Table 4 of the SmPC. Table 
5 of the SmPC provides details of dose delays or dose reductions of components of FOLFIRI at the next 
cycle based on maximum grade of specific adverse events (see SmPC section 4.2, Table 4 and Table 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/69143/2016  
Page 63/73 
 
 
 
 
 
5). Furthermore, prior to chemotherapy, patients should have a complete blood count. Criteria to be 
met prior to FOLFIRI are provided in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Asian patients suffered from a higher frequency of adverse events and also a higher frequency of 
discontinuations from treatment due to AE. Although higher incidence of hypertension, neutropenia, 
and proteinuria was observed in Asian patients, the majority of the events were manageable and did 
not lead to any significant clinical consequences. 
There appears to be a relationship between safety and exposure (see discussion on clinical 
pharmacology). 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, the observed safety profile is in line with that previously observed when ramucirumab was 
used in combination with paclitaxel in gastric cancer. The occurrence of adverse events related to 
inhibition of the VEGFR axis was increased, with hypertension being the most notable adverse event. 
The ramucirumab+FOLFIRI combination also resulted in a higher proportion of ≥grade 3 AE and in AEs 
resulting in discontinuation of treatment, suggesting that ramucirumab amplifies the toxicity induced 
by FOLFIRI. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
The  PRAC  considered  that  the  RMP  version  6.0  (dated  26  February  2015)  is  acceptable,  with  minor 
revisions  required  at  the  time  of  submitting  the  next  PSUR  (submission  due  in  December  2015),  as 
detailed in the PRAC endorsed PRAC Rapporteur updated assessment report dated 11 June 2015. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice. 
The MAH provided feedback in relation to the changes in the RMP requested by PRAC and CHMP. 
The PRAC considered that the MAH’s proposed updates to the RMP version 6.0, to be implemented in 
the  next  PSUR  (submission  due  in  December  2015),  are  acceptable.  The  PRAC  endorsed  PRAC 
Rapporteur  assessment  report  dated  10  September  2015  is  attached.  However,  the  RMP  required 
updating on time for this CHMP opinion in relation to the post-authorisation efficacy development plan. 
The CHMP endorsed the RMP version 6.1 with the following content:

been updated. Particularly, a new warning with regard to stomatitis has been added to the product 
information. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to correct minor editorial 
mistakes. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The evidence of efficacy of ramucirumab in patients with mCRC is based on the results of one pivotal 
study, the RAISE study. The proposed ramucirumab dose regimen is 8 mg/kg i.v. every 2 weeks. 
RAISE was a global, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter, Phase 3 study that 
evaluated the efficacy of ramucirumab versus placebo, each in combination with FOLFIRI, in 1072 
patients with mCRC whose disease had progressed during or after first-line combination therapy of 
bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, and a fluoropyrimidine. 
The OS results, based on 769 events (71.7%), showed a statistically significant improvement in OS for 
the ramucirumab + FOLFIRI arm (HR = 0.844; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.730, 0.976; 
p=0.0219), resulting in a 1.6-month longer median survival (13.3 months vs. 11.7 months). The OS 
benefit is supported by modest but statistically significant improvement in median PFS by 1.2 months 
(from 4.5 to 5.7 months median; HR = 0.793; 95% CI: 0.697, 0.903; p=0.0005). 
Numerically the OS was improved by 1.4 and 2.5 months (1.6 in the ITT pop) and the PFS was 
improved by 1 and 1.3 months (1.2 in the ITT pop), in KRASmut and KRASwt population, respectively. 
Differences between KRAS wt and mutant may also be clinically relevant. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
No dose finding study for the combination of ramucirumab in combination with FOLFIRI was conducted. 
The same dose (8 mg/kg) and frequency of ramucirumab (q2w) as for the treatment of metastatic 
gastric cancer was applied. Exposure-effect relationships revealed that both efficacy (OS and PFS) and 
safety (grade 3 neutropenia) were related to ramucirumab exposure. PopPK analyses did not identify 
any specific patient groups that were associated with low or high ramucirumab exposure. However, 
data suggested an imbalance in baseline characteristics/prognostic factors in the low ramucirumab 
exposure group. When taking into account the substantially improved efficacy (PFS and OS) related to 
the occurrence of AE, in particular neutropenia, appropriate dose finding may be even more important 
as this phenomenon may be exposure related. At the time of initial marketing authorisation it was 
agreed that an alternative dosing regimen may be explored for ramucirumab in second line gastric 
adenocarcinoma (study 14T-MC-JVDB) as reflected in Annex II. Since analyses suggest the exposure 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/69143/2016  
Page 67/73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
response relationship is very similar across indications, results from Study 14T-MC-JVDB may provide 
useful information to further explore the optimal dose regimen in patients with mCRC. 
Although clinically relevant, the benefit is limited. Assessment of benefit shows variability in response 
as is seen more often in these patients.  No benefit of ramucirumab was shown in patients that showed 
PD within 3 months of onset of bevacizumab containing 1st line treatment (see SmPC section 5.1).  
The possible impact of biomarkers (e.g. VEGF-C, VEGF-D, soluble VEGFR1, sVEGFR2 and sVEGFR3, 
tissue expression of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2) is difficult to determine because data appear not available 
from all patients included in study RAISE. A more complete analysis is anticipated in 2016 (see Annex 
II condition).   
Although the downstream signalling pathway of VEGFR2 seems intertwined with those related to EGFR 
the consequences of mutations in genes defining the latter may also influence the inhibition of VEGFR2 
(Pyne & Pyne, Nature Reviews Cancer 10, 489-503 (2010)). The OS benefit in the RAISE study was 
observed without complete knowledge of RAS mutation status (including NRAS), making it difficult to 
generalize the study results to patients seen in current practice at this time. RAISE was performed 
prior to the knowledge on the influence of the NRAS mutation status on the biology of mCRC. More 
extensive analyses on biomarkers are anticipated in 3Q 2016 (see Annex II condition). 
No information was provided about the number of first line treatments received as a repeat treatment 
after lasting response to initial palliative treatment. A difference between the median duration of 
disease (defined by the interval between the moment of initial diagnosis and randomisation in RAISE) 
in the two arms in RAISE was 1.32 months in favour of ramucirumab. Therefore, the distribution of 
patients considered suffering from relatively more aggressive disease over the two study arms might 
have favoured the ramucirumab containing arm of RAISE (see SmPC section 5.1).  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Overall, the safety profile of ramucirumab (Cyramza) was consistent across studies and in line with the 
already known toxicity for Cyramza known from registration studies REGARD and RAINBOW for the 
indication gastric cancer. However, combined with FOLFIRI, Cyramza was less tolerated by patients, as 
observed in almost one third of patients (29.1% vs. 13.3% in the placebo+FOLFIRI arm) discontinuing 
study treatment due to adverse events (in 27% of patients this referred to discontinuation of FOLFIRI).  
In mCRC patients treated with ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI, the most frequent (≥1%) ADR that led to 
the discontinuation of ramucirumab was proteinuria (1.5%). The most frequent (≥1%) ADRs leading to 
discontinuation of one or more components of FOLFIRI were: neutropenia (12.5%), thrombocytopenia 
(4.2%), diarrhoea (2.3%) and stomatitis (2.3%). The most frequent component of FOLFIRI to be 
discontinued was the 5 FU bolus (see SmPC section 4.8). Cases of gastrointestinal perforation have 
been reported in patients treated with ramucirumab in study RAISE (see SmPC section 4.4). 
An increase in the incidence of palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (hand-foot syndrome), 
not previously reported with ramucirumab use, was observed in the RAISE study (see SmPC section 
4.8).  
The other adverse events occurring at a substantially higher percentage in the ramucirumab+FOLFIRI 
arm such as epistaxis, hypertension, proteinuria, peripheral oedema, stomatitis, decreased appetite 
and neutropenia were also observed when ramucirumab was combined with paclitaxel.  
The incidence of neutropenia was particularly higher in the ramucirumab arm (28.2% vs. 14.6% for 
grade 3 and 10.2% vs. 8.7% for grade 4 AEs). Neutropenia rarely resulted in febrile neutropenia 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/69143/2016  
Page 68/73 
 
 
 
 
 
necessitating hospitalisation (2.3% vs. 1.5%) and no deaths due to neutropenia were observed. 
However, the frequency of discontinuation of treatment due to neutropenia was high (12.5% compared 
to 5.3% in the placebo arm).  
Regarding quality of life, a 1.5 months shorter time to deterioration (defined as >10 points change 
from baseline on a scale from 0-100) in global health was observed for patients in the ramucirumab 
plus FOLFIRI arm as assessed by the EORTC QLC-30, which was confirmed by EQ5D results. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
There is no new uncertainty to reflect regarding the unfavourable effects of ramucirumab.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Although the benefit in terms of OS and PFS improvement is limited and there was a lack of supportive 
improvement in ORR, it is considered clinically relevant in this patient population with progressive 
metastatic CRC (mCRC) after 1st line of palliative treatment. 
Side effects of ramucirimab are related to its mechanism of action. Tolerability appears to be a 
problem for ramucirumab, in particular concerning haematological and gastrointestinal toxicities, when 
given in combination with FOLFIRI. Well known side effects of FOLFIRI, such as neutropenia and 
infections were enhanced by the combination with ramucirumab. This may partially explain the 
observed decrease in quality of life.  
The toxicity of the combination was manageable mainly by adapting the dose and content of the 
FOLFIRI treatment or even discontinuation.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Since the benefit is statistically significant although modest and toxicity limited when the right 
precautions are taken, the benefit/risk balance of Cyramza, in combination with FOLFIRI (irinotecan, 
folinic acid, and 5-fluorouracil), for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer 
(mCRC) with disease progression on or after prior therapy with bevacizumab, oxaliplatin and a 
fluoropyrimidine, is considered positive.  
Nevertheless, the question whether the benefit/risk could be enhanced by further patient selection, in 
particular on the basis of biomarkers remains unresolved. The apparent  difference, albeit small,  in 
magnitude of benefit in KRASmut and KRASwt  and data external to the registration study justify  
further studies, including the possible influence of NRAS and BRAF mutation status.  
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
For all patients with progressive metastatic CRC (mCRC) after 1st line of palliative treatment, further 
systemic treatment is palliative rather than curative. The goals of systemic treatment in these patients 
are to prolong survival while maintaining quality of life, by reducing disease related symptoms and 
limit treatment related toxicity, for as long as possible. Therefore, overall survival is considered the 
most important endpoint.

It is noted that the patient population recruited in the pivotal study was highly selected regarding 
performance status, lack of co-morbidities and risk for toxicities from anti VEGF targeting agents (e.g. 
no disturbances in coagulation function or with a recent history of bleeding events). This has been 
adequately reflected in the SmPC (see SmPC section 5.1).  
Efficacy may depend on KRAS mutations in exons currently known to harbour mutations. Information 
on the actual mutation status and related efficacy of ramucirumab in mCRC is lacking. Similarly, the 
impact of currently recognized importance of mutations in NRAS (overall, mutations within the RAS 
genome) as well as in BRAF in CRC on the efficacy of ramucirumab is yet unclear. KRAS, BRAF, and 
NRAS mutations are considered mutually exclusive.  The MAH committed to retrospectively analyse 
samples from patients with KRAS wild-type tumours for additional KRAS mutations and NRAS and 
BRAF mutations and evaluate the efficacy of ramucirumab in this population (see Annex II condition). 
High VEGF and/or VEGFR expression have been associated with poor prognosis in a variety of cancers. 
VEGF and VEGFR expression in RAISE have not been reported sufficiently yet but will be evaluated 
retrospectively together with the other potential biomarkers. The MAH committed to submit biomarker 
analysis of the entire RAISE population by the end of 2016.  
Regarding the issue of the relationship between exposure and the benefit/risk of ramucirumab, it 
should be considered that this issue was also raised in relation to the currently approved indication of 
gastric carcinoma, where a similar dose was used, resulting in a requirement of an additional dose-
response study after registration (see Study 14T-MC-JVDB in Annex II). These results might provide 
valuable exploratory information for the mCRC indication. Depending on the outcome of this study 
further data might be requested to the applicant. 
Due to the above uncertainties with respect to the efficacy of Cyramza in certain sub-populations, the 
CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy (see Annex II 
condition): 
In order to investigate the potential correlation between biomarker measures (VEGF-C. VEGF-D, 
sVEGFR1, sVEGFR2 and sVEGFR3 from plasma, VEGFR2 IHC, additional KRAS, NRAS and BRAF 
mutations) and efficacy outcome (PFS, OS), the MAH should submit the results of a biomarker assay 
from the RAISE translational research population.  
- Correlation with VEGF-C. VEGF-D, sVEGFR1, sVEGFR2 and sVEGFR3 from plasma, VEGFR2 IHC will 
be submitted by 30 June 2016 
- Correlation with additional KRAS, NRAS and BRAF mutations will be submitted by 30 September 
2016. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends by consensus the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, 
concerning the following change:

colorectal cancer (mCRC) with disease progression on or after prior therapy with bevacizumab, 
oxaliplatin and a fluoropyrimidine; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of 
the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Furthermore, Annex II has been 
updated to include an obligation for the MAH to conduct a Post Authorisation Efficacy Study (PAES). In 
addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to correct minor editorial 
mistakes and to align Annex II to the QRD version 9.1. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and 
to the Risk Management Plan (RMP)(final version 6.1). 
This CHMP recommendation is subject to the following amended condition:

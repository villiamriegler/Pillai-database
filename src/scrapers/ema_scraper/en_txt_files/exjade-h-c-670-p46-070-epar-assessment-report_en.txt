1.  Introduction 
On 30 September 2016, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Exjade, in accordance 
with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study CICL670AIT14 “retrospective data collection study to assess the long term 
renal safety of deferasirox in patients with transfusional hemosiderosis who were enrolled into the 
registration studies” is a stand-alone study. This study is a retrospective chart review of patients from 
sites located in Italy who took part in the deferasirox registration studies (CICL670A0105,106,107,108 
and 109) and were treated with at least one dose of DFX. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study<ies> 
Exjade is brand name for deferasirox presented as dispersible tablets in 3 doses strengths: 125, 250 
and 500mg. The investigational drug was available as tablets at dosage strengths of 125 mg, 250 mg 
and 500 mg, packaged in high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with an induction seal and child 
resistant closure. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The orally active, tridentate iron chelator deferasirox (company research code: ICL670) is the active 
ingredient in Exjade® dispersible tablets. Exjade is currently approved in over 100 countries. In the 
European Union, it was approved on 28-Aug-2006 for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to 
frequent blood transfusions (≥7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) in patients with beta 
thalassaemia major aged 6 years and older. 
EXJADE is also indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions when 
deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in the following patient groups: 
- in paediatric patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload due to frequent blood 
transfusions (≥7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) aged 2 to 5 years, 
- in adult and paediatric patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload due to infrequent 
blood transfusions (<7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) aged 2 years and older, 
- in adult and paediatric patients with other anaemias aged 2 years and older. 
Since 20 December 2012, Exjade has been also indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload 
requiring chelation therapy when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in patients 
with nontransfusion- dependent thalassaemia syndromes aged 10 years and older.

2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study  CICL670AIT14  “  retrospective  data  collection  study  to  assess  the 
long  term  renal  safety  of  deferasirox  in  patients  with  transfusional 
hemosiderosis who were enrolled into the registration studies” 
Description 
This study is a retrospective chart review of patients from sites located in Italy who took part in the 
deferasirox registration studies (CICL670A0105,106,107,108 and 109) and were treated with at least 
one dose of DFX. 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
Primary objective 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the trend of serum creatinine over time in patients 
who were treated with at least one dose of deferasirox during registration studies CICL670A0105, 
A0106, A0107, A0108 and A0109. 
Secondary objectives 
The secondary objectives of the study were to evaluate: 
-  Renal function parameters over time in patients who had been treated with only deferasirox 
and no other chelators since enrollment in the registration studies. 
- 
The frequency of renal adverse events from the time of completion/discontinuation of the 
registration study to the end of the retrospective study. 
- 
The frequency of notable renal function parameters from the time of 
completion/discontinuation of the registration study to the end of the retrospective study. 
-  Renal function over time in patients who were on multiple chelators and other single chelators 
(deferoxamine, deferiprone, etc.) except deferasirox during the retrospective period. 
-  Renal function in patients who reported renal Adverse Events (AE) or confirmed notable renal 
laboratory values in the registration studies. Renal function in patients who reported renal AEs 
or confirmed notable renal laboratory values in the registration studies by underlying disease.

The exploratory objective of the study was to evaluate the role of serum ferritin levels and concomitant 
medications with known nephrotoxic effect on notable renal laboratory values and adverse events 
collected during retrospective data collection. 
Study design 
This was a retrospective chart review conducted at Italian investigational sites that enrolled 
transfusion-dependent patients in the deferasirox registration studies. Reviews were carried out on 
patients who were treated with deferasirox at least once during these studies. The first renal 
assessment in which serum creatinine, urinary protein and urinary creatinine values were available was 
collected for each quarter. The urinary protein/urinary creatinine ratio was collected directly from the 
patient chart if available or calculated using urinary protein and creatinine values. Data were 
retrospectively collected beginning from the time of completion of, or discontinuation from the 
registration studies until the patient assessment occurring at the site before enrollment. Written 
informed consent was provided giving permission for data to be included in this retrospective study. 
Study population /Sample size 
Patients who were treated with at least one dose of DFX during the registration studies and had renal 
function parameters available (below and above 18 years-old). The estimated sample size was 366 
patients. The study enrolled 292 patients (80%) but due to screening failure in 10 patients, data for 
282 patients were collected and analysed. 
Inclusion criteria 
1. Male or female subjects who had participated in deferasirox registration studies 
CICL670A0105, A0106, A0107, A0108 or A0109. Some patients were still aged below 18 
years at the time of enrollment. 
2. Treatment with at least one dose of deferasirox while enrolled in one of the above - 
mentioned deferasirox registration studies/their extensions. 
3. At least one post-baseline serum creatinine value from participation in the registration 
studies. 
4. Available medical records after discontinuation from registration studies. 
5. Written informed consent provided prior to any screening procedure.  
Exclusion criteria 
None 
Treatments 
In the registration studies, the investigational study drug used in the course of this study 
was deferasirox (ICL670). This study did not require a specific ongoing treatment; patients 
may have been treated with iron chelators or any other medication at the Investigator’s 
discretion and according to local prescribing information.

All iron chelation therapy administered during the retrospective study, along with the corresponding 
dose and duration were recorded. All medications and significant non-drug therapies (including 
physical therapy, herbal/natural medications and blood transfusions) administered during the 
observation period were recorded on the Case Report Form (CRF). 
CHMP comment 
Patients enrolled in the registration studies (and receiving at least one dose of deferasirox) are 
followed during retrospective period but can be treated with either other iron chelators (mono of 
multiple therapies) or any other medications at the investigator’s discretion. Therefore, the long term 
renal safety of deferasirox will be difficult to assess based on these data, especially as only 5 patients 
have been treated with deferasirox during the retrospective period. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The purpose of this study was to assess the long-term renal safety of deferasirox in patients with 
transfusional hemosiderosis. Renal adverse events and renal laboratory parameters were collected on a 
quarterly basis. The primary variable was serum creatinine (SCr). SCr, urinary protein and creatinine, 
urinary protein/creatinine ratio, creatinine clearance (if available), hemoglobin levels and serum ferritin 
were collected quarterly during the retrospective period. 
The endpoints were the trends in renal parameters serum creatinine, urine protein and urine 
protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) over time, starting from baseline value of the registration studies, 
worst value in the registration studies (data from the registration studies were already available) and 
then values collected quarterly in the retrospective study. The primary variable was serum creatinine. 
Renal adverse events and abnormal laboratory values were collected also. 
Statistical Methods 
All statistical analyses were produced using SAS® release 9.4 or later (SAS Institute Inc., Cary NC, 
USA). 
No formal statistical hypothesis was stated and therefore all the analyses are descriptive. 
All analyses were performed on the Safety Set. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Two hundred ninety-two patients (292) were enrolled in the study and 282 patients were evaluated 
(10 were screening failures). Sixty-five (23.05%) patients were aged ˂18 years at Quarter 1 of data 
collection. 
More than 90% of both the total population and pediatric population were observed for at least seven 
years following the completion of/discontinuation from the previous registration trials. The percentage 
of patients observed after the seventh year decreases progressively until Q1 of year 13, when data 
was collected for only one patient.

All 282 patients of the Safety Set took at least one dose of deferasirox in the registration period and 
215 took at least one dose in the retrospective period. 
Treatment duration in the safety set, calculated as the time in years elapsed from the date of the first 
dose of deferasirox until the date of the last dose was equal to 3.45 ± 1.59 years (range 0.02 – 6.36

years) in the registration period and 6.11 ± 2.84 years (range 0.002 – 13.36 years) in the 
retrospective period. 
In patients under 18 years of age (at Q1), treatment exposure was equal to 3.57 ± 1.46 years (range 
0.03 – 5.41 years) in the registration period and 6.56 ±2.27 years (range 0.07 – 12.66 years) in the 
retrospective period. 
In patients 18 or over, treatment exposure was equal to 3.42 ± 1.63 years (range 0.02 – 6.36 years) 
and 5.96 ± 3.00 years (range 0.00 – 13.36 years) in the registration and retrospective periods 
respectively. 
Overall, treatment duration was 7.88 ± 4.25 years (range 0.03 – 14.14 years) in the safety set, 8.72 
± 4.18 years (range 0.03 – 12.94 years) in patients under 18 years of age and 7.63 ± 4.26 years 
(range 0.08 – 14.14 years) in patients 18 or over. (Note: overall treatment duration was calculated 
excluding the time period elapsed between the last dose of deferasirox in the registration trials and the 
first dose of deferasirox in the retrospective trial. Temporary interruptions in treatment during the 
registration and retrospective periods were not excluded from the calculation). 
The recommended initial daily dose of dispersible tablet is 20 mg/kg body weight. In the safety set, 
average daily dose was in mean 1,032.19 ± 438.77 mg with a range between 166.86 and 2,810.13 mg 
in the registration period and 1,385.59 ± 499.98 mg (ranging between 215.18 and 2,629.94 mg) in 
the retrospective period. 
In the under 18 population, average daily dose was in mean 697.80 ± 326.46 mg (range 191.36 – 
1635.44 mg) and 1,214.86 ± 420.69 mg (range 279.74 – 2,236.22 mg) in the registration period and 
retrospective period respectively. 
In patients over 18, average daily dose was in mean 1,132.35 ± 418.51 mg (range 166.86 – 2,810.13 
mg) in the registration period and 1,441.79 ± 512.28 mg (range 215.18 – 2,629.94 mg) in the 
retrospective period. 
CHMP comment 
It will be difficult to analyse the renal safety profile compared with the treatment duration based on the 
data provided by the MAH: indeed, the methodology used was not detailed enough by the MAH. For 
instance, the MAH did not discuss why temporary interruptions in treatment during the registration and 
retrospective periods were not excluded from the calculation.  The MAH should provide a clear 
justification of the methodology used for the treatment duration calculation with the reason why 
temporary interruptions in treatment during the registration and retrospective periods were not 
excluded from the calculation and should provide an accurate estimation of the treatment duration with 
deferasirox (in patient-year) for the safety set (respectively for adults and paediatric patients).

During the retrospective period, 179 patients (63.48% of the Safety Set) took at least one other iron-
chelating therapy. Thirty-eight (38) of these patients were under the age of 18 (58.46% of the ˂18 
population). The most common chelating agents were deferoxamine (reported by 56.03% of the 
patients of the Safety Set) and deferiprone (reported by 48.23% of the patients of the Safety Set). The 
other chelators were in most cases given sequentially, but in some cases concomitantly with 
deferasirox. 
CHMP comment 
A majority of patients (63%) followed during the retrospective period have been treated with other 
iron chelators (in mono or multiple therapies). Therefore, the long term renal safety of deferasirox will 
be difficult to assess based on these data. A safety subgroup (N°1) included all patients receiving only 
deferasirox have been analyzed: unfortunately, only 5 patients were included in this subgroup and no 
conclusion can be drawn. 
Baseline data 
Patient distribution according to participation in the previous registration trials is shown in Table 5-1. 
Most patients (63.08% of patients < 18 years of age and 49.77% of patients ≥ 18) participated in 
study CICL670A0107/E.

Demographic data by age group are shown in Table 5-2. 
Medical history was obtained from data collected during the registration studies. Almost all the patients 
(92.31% of patients ˂18 years and 98.16% of those ≥ 18 years at Q1) reported at least one relevant 
condition. Congenital, familial and genetic disorders (75.38% in ˂ 18 and 63.59% in ≥ 18), 
metabolism and nutrition disorders (61.54% and 48.39%), endocrine disorders (9.23% and 47%) and 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (9.23% and 41.94%) were the most frequent ongoing 
System Organ Classes (SOC) affecting patients in both age groups at the start of the registration 
studies. 
Efficacy results 
Efficacy was not assessed in the study CICL670AIT14. 
Safety results 
The primary objective was to evaluate the trend of SCr over time in patients who were treated with at 
least one dose of deferasirox during registration studies CICL670A0105, 106, 107, 108 and 109.

Adverse events 
1-  Subgroup analysis 
Safety set- Subgroup 1 
No meaningful analysis could be performed since only five patients were treated with only deferasirox 
and no other chelators since enrollment in the registration studies. 
CHMP comment 
One of the 2nd objectives is to evaluate renal function parameters over time in patients who had been 
treated with only deferasirox and no other chelators since enrollment in the registration studies 
(subgroup 1). However, this 2nd objective is not reached as only few patients (only 5) were classified in 
subgroup 1 and no comprehensive analysis was performed.  
Safety set- Subgroup 2 
Subgroup 2 (N=62) was made up of all patients who did not take deferasirox during the retrospective 
period. These patients were on multiple chelators (sequentially or in combination) or other single 
chelators (deferoxamine, deferiprone, etc.) other than deferasirox during the retrospective period.  
The mean changes in SCr vs. worst value of the registration studies were again quite stable during the 
retrospective period and fluctuated between -15 and -25 (μmol/l). No conclusions can be drawn from 
the comparison of the two age groups given their small size (12 patients under 18 years). 
Nevertheless, younger patients did have lower mean values in comparison with patients aged 18 years 
or older during the first quarters of collection.

CHMP comment 
One of the 2nd objectives is to evaluate renal function over time in patients who were on multiple 
chelators and other single chelators (deferoxamine, deferiprone, etc.) except deferasirox during the 
retrospective period. It seems that no deterioration of renal function during the retrospective period 
was noted with therapies other than deferasirox in this safety subgroup N°2 as the mean changes in 
SCr is relatively stable.  
However, the MAH did not provide the justification for having chosen mean change vs worst value 
instead of baseline value. This should be done and detailed interpretation should be provided.  
However, instead of having the mean change in absolute value vs worst value, it would have been 
more appropriate to have the percentage of SCr change compared to baseline at registration 
enrollment for each quarter. This should be done also for CrCl changes. 
No significative difference between paediatric population and total population has been identified. 
Safety set-Subgroup 3 
Safety Set – Subgroup 3 (N=197) comprised of patients with renal AEs or confirmed notable renal 
laboratory values in the registration studies. Forty-three were less than 18 years of age at Q1 (66.15% 
of the ˂18 population). 
Mean SCr at baseline of the registration studies for the safety set was 53.23 ± 13.72 μmol/l (range 
26.10 – 87.96 μmol/l) while the mean worst value collected was equal to 82.95 ± 21.11 μmol/l (range 
41.50 – 156.50 μmol/l). In patients ˂ 18 years, baseline and worst values were 40.10 ± 7.84 μmol/l 
(range 26.10 – 62.32 μmol/l) and 67.16 ± 13.67 μmol/l (range 41.50 – 107.80 μmol/l) respectively.

As in the full safety set, mean/median values were higher than baseline value but lower than worst 
value. The mean/median values were slightly higher than values of the Safety Set (around 62 μmol/l in 
mean vs. 60 μmol/l in mean) and remained stable until Quarter 43, when only 11 patients (2 less than 
18 years of age) were still under observation and mean/median values started to fluctuate. Mean 
values in patients ≥ 18 years were consistently higher, but similar to those reported for patients < 18 
years of age. 
CHMP comment 
One of the 2nd objectives is to evaluate renal function in patients who reported renal Adverse Events 
(AE) or confirmed notable renal laboratory values in the registration studies. A description of renal 
function in patients who reported renal AEs or confirmed notable renal laboratory values in the 
registration studies by underlying disease was also made. Almost all patients had beta-thalassemia. 
Similarly, it seems that no deterioration of renal function was noted in this safety subgroup N°3 as the 
mean changes in SCr is relatively stable. However, instead of having the mean change in absolute 
value vs worst value, it would have been more appropriate to have the percentage of SCr change 
compared to baseline at registration enrollment. No significative difference between paediatric 
population and total population has been identified. 
In addition, the interpretation of these data is difficult as of these 197 patients, we do not known the 
percentage of patients taking deferasirox (monotherapy / sequential / concomitant) during the 
retrospective period. The MAH should clarify and discuss if any renal deterioration is observed in each 
subgroup taking deferasirox (monotherapy / sequential / concomitant) compared with baseline. 
Safety set- Subgroup 4 
Subgroup 4 (N=165) comprised of patients with renal AEs or confirmed notable renal laboratory values 
during the retrospective period.  
A notable value for serum creatinine was defined as an increase ≥ 33% from baseline and > upper 
normal limit at two consecutive measurements at least 7 days apart (for this reason the parameter 
does not apply to Q1). Very few adult patients (1-3 per quarter) presented notable values and only one 
notable value was collected for patients <18 years of age (Q28). 
One to 15 patients per quarter had a notable urinary protein value (≥ 300 mg/day). 
A notable urinary protein/creatinine ratio was defined as one ≥ 1.0. The very few values available were 
almost all normal.  
Finally, it is worth pointing out that many of the clinically notable laboratory values occurred 
concomitantly with the use of medications with potentially nephrotoxic effects. 
CHMP comment 
Of the 165 patients included in subgroup 4, no patient experienced acute renal failure or end stage 
renal disease. A total of 87 patients (52.41% of subgroup 4) were affected by renal AEs in the 
retrospective period including 18 paediatric patients (<18 years-old). No details were provided on the 
nature of renal AEs in this subgroup. In addition a discrepancy was noted with table 14.3.1-6 where a 
total of 86 patients experienced renal AE (52.12%). The MAH should clarify.

One of the 2nd objectives is to evaluate the frequency of renal adverse events and notable renal 
function parameters from the time of completion/discontinuation of the registration study to end of the 
retrospective study. 
It would be appreciated that the MAH performed a comprehensive safety analysis in this subgroup n°4 
with a description of renal AEs and notable renal function parameters by type of patients (i.e patients 
on deferasirox only, on multiple chelators (by different combinations), other single chelators 
(deferoxamine, deferiprone). 
2-  Renal adverse events 
A summary of patients who experienced one or more renal adverse events during the retrospective 
period is presented in Table 5-3.  
Renal AEs were reported in 30.50% of the overall safety set, in 26.15% of the patients under 18 years 
of age and in 31.80% of those 18 or older. The total number of renal AEs was however much higher in 
patients aged 18 or older than in patients under 18 years of age (164 vs. 40 for total renal AEs and 
110 vs. 27 for renal AEs respectively). 
Eight patients (2.84%) had at least one serious renal AE (7 in group “ ≥ 18 years” and 1 in group “<18 
years”), seven (2.48%) had a renal AE of severe intensity (6 in group “≥ 18 years” and 1 in group 
“<18 years”), 5 (1.77%) discontinued treatment with deferasirox due to renal AE (all in group “≥ 18 
years”) and 33 patients (11.70%) had at least one renal AE suspected of being related to deferasirox. 
The most common AEs were nephrolithiasis in both age groups (11.52% of patients aged 18 or older 
and 9.23% of patients under 18 years of age), renal colics, especially among patients aged 18 or 
older (11.52 % in group “≥ 18 years” and 4.62% in group “< 18 years”), followed by 
abnormal/increased urine protein/creatinine ratios, abnormal/increased blood creatinine, 
and proteinuria.  
Serious renal AEs 
Eight patients (2.84% of Safety Set) had serious renal adverse events, only one under the age of 18 at 
Q1 (Patient 02_020), had at least one serious renal adverse event. No causal relationship was 
suspected between these SAEs and treatment with deferasirox.

Brief narratives of the serious adverse events occurred during the retrospective period are provided as 
follows. 
 
Patient, underlying condition: beta thalassemia, SAE: acute kidney injury.  
the 1st date on her chart review after participation in study CICL670A0107/E was 17 August 2008. , 
the patient was hospitalized for acute kidney injury occurring during the course of acute 
pancreatitis. Deferasirox, which the patient had been taking regularly during the retrospective period, 
was temporarily interrupted while she was being treated. The event was considered resolved on 22

on the same day. No action was taken concerning the study drug (deferasirox) and no causal 
relationship was suspected between study drug and event. 
 
Patient, underlying condition: MDS, SAE: blood creatinine increased.  
the first date on his chart review after participation in study CICL670A0108/E was 14 October 2004. No 
iron chelators were used by this patient during the retrospective period. The patient was hospitalized 
due to an increase of creatinine above the upper limit of normal. The event was then considered 
resolved on 22 April 2005.

right hydronephrosis.  
the first date on her chart review after participation in study CICL670A0107/E was 4 January 2007. 
The patient used deferoxamine or deferiprone but not deferasirox as iron chelator during the 
retrospective period. , the patient was hospitalized due to hydronephrosis and colic of the right kidney 
along with anuria. She was discharged from the hospital two weeks later on 16 January. On 31 March 
2011, the patient was diagnosed with renal failure. She was hospitalized for a nephrectomy of the left 
kidney, which was found to be atrophic (in 2007, the patient had been diagnosed with “massive 
nephrolithiasis of the left kidney”). 
Renal AEs suspected to be related to deferasirox 
Thirty-three patients (11.70% of the Safety Set) were affected by renal adverse events suspected of 
being related to treatment with deferasirox. Ten of these patients were under the age of 18 years at 
Q1 (15.38% of the patients ˂18)  
(A summary of these AEs is provided by System Organ Class and Preferred Term in Table 10-15.

Proteinuria (3.08% and 3.23%), abnormal/increased urine protein/creatinine ratio (9.23% and 3.69%) 
and blood creatinine increased (3.08% and 2.76%) were the most frequently reported events in both 
patients under 18 years of age and patients aged 18 or older respectively. None of these events was 
serious and four were considered of severe intensity: patient presented a severe increase of urine 
protein/creatinine ratio, patient presented a severe increase of urine protein/creatinine ratio and 
proteinuria, and patient was affected by severe glycosuria. In most cases, deferasirox was temporarily 
interrupted or dosage was adjusted and no further action was required. 
Renal AEs leading to drug discontinuation 
Five patients (1.77%), all aged 18 years or older, did however discontinue treatment with deferasirox 
permanently due to renal adverse events. No patients under the age of 18 years permanently 
discontinued treatment due to renal adverse events. 
Eighty-seven patients (52.41% of Subgroup 4) were affected by renal adverse events in the 
retrospective period. Eighteen of these patients were under the age of 18 years (52.94% of Subgroup 
4 ˂ 18 years).

Of the 87 patients experiencing a renal adverse event, 34 (39.08%) were in the ≥ 1000 ug/L and 
<2500 ug/L ferritin level group, 25 (28.74%) were in the ≥ 500 ug/L and <1000 ug/L group and 17 
(19.54%) were in the ≥2500 ug/L group. Ten of the 87 patients (11.49%) were in the < 500 ug/L 
group and one (1.15%) did not have a ferritin value Ten of the 27 patients (37.04%) with SF < 500 
ug/L, 25 of the 46 patients (54.35%) with SF ≥ 500 ug/L and <1000 ug/L, 34 of the 58 patients 
(58.62%) with SF ≥1000 ug/L and <2500 ug/L, and 17 of the 34 patients (50%) with SF ≥ 2500 ug/L 
had a renal adverse event. 
In patients under 18 years of age, 1 of the 2 patients (50.00%) with SF < 500 ug/L, 5 of the 8 patients 
(62.50%) with SF ≥ 500 ug/L and <1000 ug/L, 8 of the 16 patients (50.00%) with SF ≥1000 ug/L and 
<2500 ug/L, and 4 of the 8 patients (50.00%) with SF ≥ 2500 ug/L had a renal adverse event. 
CHMP comment : One of the 2nd objectives of this study is to evaluate the frequency of renal adverse 
events from the time of completion/discontinuation of the registration study to the end of the 
retrospective study. 
The most common AEs were nephrolithiasis in both age groups (11.52% of patients aged 18 or older 
and 9.23% of patients under 18 years of age), renal colics, especially among patients aged 18 or older 
(11.52 % in group “≥ 18 years” and 4.62% in group “< 18 years”), followed by abnormal/increased 
urine protein/creatinine ratios, abnormal/increased blood creatinine, and proteinuria. Eight patients 
(2.84% of Safety Set) experienced serious renal AE including one child (patient 02_020).  
Of note, among the serious renal AEs, there were 2 nephrolithiasis, 2 renal colics, and blood creatinine 
increased, acute kidney injury, haematuria (in a paediatric patient), hydronephrosis, renal failure and 
urethral stenosis (each one). Renal colics, one case of nephrolithiasis, one acute kidney injury in a 
context of pancreatitis and one haematuria occurred within a therapy included deferasirox. No new 
safety concern emerges from these data. 
The MAH should clarify the definition of “distinct renal AEs by LLT” and clarify what is the difference 
with the total number of renal AEs.

No new safety concerns emerges from these descriptive data. However, the interpretation of these 
data is difficult as we do not known the percentage of patients taking deferasirox (monotherapy / 
sequential/concomitant) during the retrospective period. 
Deaths 
Sixteen patients died during the retrospective period (after completion/discontinuation of the 
registration trial). No information regarding date or cause of death was collected in the database. 
Renal parameters were collected for these patients but no information regarding date or cause of death 
was collected in the database. 
CHMP comment 
Age of deceased patients is between 20 and 86 years-old (at Q1). Main deaths occurred in patients 
enrolled in study 108/E (9/16 ; 56%). We regret that no information of the cause of death was 
collected in the database for this retrospective study. This cannot allow to conclude if any renal AE had 
a fatal outcome. 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
The collection of individual AEs/SAEs was not required for this type of retrospective study. Only renal 
adverse events and abnormal laboratory values or test results were collected. 
Serum creatinine 
In the Safety Set, the SCr mean baseline value for the registration studies was 53.39 ± 13.45 μmol/l 
(range: 20.35 – 87.96 μmol/l) while the worst value was on average 79.73 ± 20.19 μmol/l (range: 
35.40 – 156.50 μmol/l). During the retrospective period, mean/median values were slightly higher 
than baseline values but lower than worst values. SCr values remained quite stable (around 60 μmol/l 
in mean) until Quarter 43, when the number of observed patients began to drop considerably (37 or 
less) and mean/median values started to fluctuate. 
Mean/median values for patients aged ≥18 years were slightly higher than those reported for patients 
aged less than 18 years

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/244743/2017

In the pediatric group, mean baseline and worst values were equal to 41.30 ± 9.73 μmol/l (range 
20.35 – 69.84 μmol/l) and 65.73 ± 13.23 μmol/l (range 41.50 – 107.80 μmol/l) respectively. 
Mean/median values during the retrospective period were stable (mostly between 50 and 60 μmol/l in 
mean) and slightly lower than the ones reported for adults. Since SCr was recorded as absolute value, 
the slightly higher values in the adult population reflect the normal absolute increase in SCr related to 
growth and muscle mass. 
CHMP comment 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the trend of serum creatinine over time in patients 
who were treated with at least one dose of deferasirox during registration studies. There was no 
primary efficacy analysis for this study. 
During the retrospective period, mean/median SCr values were slightly higher than baseline values but 
lower than worst values and relatively stable (around 60 μmol/l in mean) until Quarter 43, when the 
number of observed patients began to decrease notably. No significative difference was observed 
between paediatric and adults group. 
No firm conclusions on the long term safety of deferasirox could be drawn from these descriptive data 
as the safety set contains only 5 patients treated with deferasirox. The other patients could receive 
either deferasirox with other chelators (sequential/ concomitant) or monotherapies of other chelators.  
Urinary Protein

Mean baseline and worst values for urinary protein during the registration studies were equal to 0.13 ± 
0.08 g/day (range 0.00 – 0.60 g/day) and 0.46 ± 0.72 g/day (range 0.08 – 11.26 g/day) respectively, 
with mean baseline value considered within normal range. Less than 25% of data in the retrospective 
period were available, but mean/median values were in any case mostly higher than values at baseline 
but lower than worst values for the registration studies and within normal range. The marked spike in 
the graph at Q51 reflects the results in only two patients. (Figure 5-8) 
The separate analyses of the two age groups (<18 years and ≥18 years) were inconclusive due to the 
small size of the groups.  
Mean baseline and worst values for urinary protein during the registration studies were equal to 0.13 ± 
0.08 g/day (range 0.04 – 0.49 g/day) and 0.44 ± 0.33 g/day (range 0.13 – 1.74 g/day). Quarterly 
values were consistently below mean worst value and mostly ≤ 0.15 g/day, occasionally reaching 
values between 0.16 and 0.19 g/day. 
CHMP comment 
Based on the figure 5-8, Urine protein values seems to be relatively stable. However, these results 
should be taken with caution as only based on 25% of values available in the retrospective period.  
Urinary creatinine 
Mean baseline value (of the registration trials) for the safety set was equal to 8.40 ± 3.70 mmol/day 
with a range between 1.90 and 25.50 mmol/day, and mean worst value (i.e. the highest urinary 
creatinine collected during the registration studies) equal to 16.83 ± 5.79 mmol/day (min. 6.70

mmol/day and max. 38.00 mmol/day). During the retrospective period, less than 15% of the data 
were collected, even at Quarter 1 (41 out of 282 patients had non - missing data), and no graphs were 
therefore produced. Values were around 9-10 mmol/day, higher than mean baseline value and lower 
than mean worst value. 
In the pediatric population, mean baseline and worst value of the registration studies were equal to 
7.11 ± 3.08 mmol/day (range 1.90 – 16.40 mmol/day) and 13.96 ± 5.11 mmol/day (range 7.10 – 
29.30 mmol/day) respectively. Quarterly values in the retrospective period were mostly between 7 and 
10 mmol/day. 
CHMP comment 
Urinary creatinine values during the retrospective period are between the baseline and worst values 
observed in registration studies. However, these results are based on only 15% of values available in 
the retrospective period and should be taken with caution.  
Urinary protein/creatinine ratio 
The mean baseline and worst urinary protein/creatinine ratios for the safety set were equal to 0.15 ± 
0.12 (range 0.00 – 1.53) and 0.53 ± 1.47 (range 0.10 – 24.48) respectively. As for urinary protein 
and urinary creatinine, few data were available during the retrospective period (more than 85% of the 
data were missing). The highest mean values were 0.47 ± 1.44 (range 0.00 -7.67) at Quarter 5 (mean 
calculated on 42 patients) and 0.96 ± 1.55 (range 0.08 – 4.38) at Q46 (mean calculated on 7 patients) 
(Figure 5-10). 
In patients under 18 years of age, mean baseline value and worst value in the registration studies 
were equal to 0.17 ± 0.07 (range 0.05 – 0.36) and 0.53 ± 0.41 (range 0.13 – 2.17) respectively. 
Quarterly values for mean/median urinary protein/creatine during the retrospective period were mostly 
near baseline value of the registration study. 
CHMP comment 
Similarly, no conclusion can be drawn from these UPCR results as more than 85% of the UPCR values 
are missing.  
Creatinine clearance 
In clinical practice, Creatinine Clearance (CrCl) is estimated based on SCr using the Cockcroft-Gault or 
Schwartz Equation for monitoring renal function. The study protocol mandated documentation of SCr 
but did not mandate to document serum creatinine clearance. CrCl was collected only if available, in 
addition to SCr and UPCR, to provide further indications about renal function during the retrospective 
period of this chart review. The weight of patients was not available in the same time of SCr value to 
calculate the clearance. When analyzing the data however, only few creatinine clearance values were 
available in the database, and therefore no reliable considerations could be drawn. 
CHMP comment 
We regret that Creatinine clearance values were not available as it is a good parameter to assess renal 
function. 
Hemoglobin

Mean hemoglobin values during the retrospective period were very low and persistently lower than 100 
g/l considering the quarters with a meaningful number of data collected. 
Serum ferritin 
Median serum ferritin at Q1 was 1,829.00 μg/l (range 155.00 – 14,258.00 μg/l) in the safety set and 
2,055.00 μg/l (range 360.00 – 7,446.00 μg/l) in patients under 18 years of age. Levels tended to drop 
initially and then fluctuate slightly from quarter to quarter. 
CHMP comment 
Serum ferritin values varies similarly in both total population and paediatric population. However, the 
impact of ferritin on serum creatinine variations cannot be established based on these descriptive data. 
Long-term use 
This study assessed the renal function of patients enrolled in the registration studies up to 13 years 
later and confirmed the non-progressive nature of these serum creatinine observations. The primary 
objective of the study was to evaluate the trend of serum creatinine over time in patients previously 
treated with at least one dose of deferasirox during the previous registration studies and found that 
the serum creatinine was stable throughout the retrospective study. The efficacy and safety data from 
this study are consistent with the long -term pivotal studies up to 5 years.

According to the MAH, recently submitted data from two long-term observational studies with 3-year 
follow-up in pediatric and adult patients, and 5-year follow-up in pediatric patients (studies 
CICL670A2301 and A2411 respectively) confirm these conclusions; no unexpected safety findings were 
observed regarding AEs or laboratory abnormalities, and the overall safety profile of deferasirox was 
consistent with the approved label. Notable increases in SCr were observed in some patients and the 
overall SCr increase was consistent with that of a growing pediatric patient. No over-proportioned 
progressive increase in SCr was observed. 
In the 5-year registry with deferasirox DT (CICL670A2411) in children aged 2 to less than 6 years, the 
overall safety profile of deferasirox was consistent with that described in the approved SmPC at 
enrollment, and it suggests that deferasirox does not impact overall growth or sexual development in 
observed in pediatric patients. 
The findings observed from this study were consistent with the five-year renal data from the pivotal 
registration study, Study CICL670A0107, indicating no progressive worsening of the renal function 
over time. 
CHMP comment 
Overall, no unexpected safety findings have been identified in the study 2301, in comparison to the 
overall safety profile of Exjade® described in the approved label. For serum creatinine, creatinine 
clearance and ALT, which are specific endpoints of the primary objective of this study, the MAH provide 
boxplot by quarter for all patients enrolled in the Safety Set which permit to have an idea of the trend 
of these values over the three years of treatment with deferasirox. Globally, the evolutions of these 
biological markers are reassuring. Similarly, based on the results of the study A2411, there were no 
unexpected safety findings observed regarding the long term use of Exjade®. 
The retrospective study AIT14 is the 1st study with a large follow-up of patients enrolled in registration 
studies (up to 13 years later). More than 90% of both the total population and pediatric population 
were observed for at least seven years following the completion of/discontinuation from the previous 
registration trials. This study did not reveal any new safety concern regarding renal parameters (in 
adults/paediatric patients). However, these results should be taken with caution due to the nature 
“retrospective” and “descriptive” of the study.  
Safety conclusion 
A total of 282 patients were included in the Safety Set  including 23.05% of paediatric patients at Q1 
of data collection. The duration of treatment with deferasirox was 3.45 ± 1.59 years (range: 0.02 – 
6.36 years) in the registration studies and 6.11 ± 2.84 years (range: 0.002 – 13.36 years) in the 
retrospective period. More than 50% of the patients were treated with deferasirox for at least 7 years 
during the retrospective period. Overall, the treatment duration was 7.88±4.25 years (range: 0.03 – 
14.14 years); more than 50% of the patients were treated with deferasirox for at least 9 years. 
The mean baseline and worst urinary creatinine values during registration were 8.40 ± 3.70 mmol/day 
and 16.83 ± 5.79 mmol/day respectively, and between 9.00 and 10.00 mmol/day during retrospective 
collection.

Renal AEs were reported in 30.50% patients of the overall safety set, in 26.15% of the patients under 
18 years of age and in 31.80% of those 18 or older. Eight patients (2.84%) had at least one serious 
renal AE (seven patients aged ≥ 18 years and one patient aged less than 18), none of which were 
suspected of being related to treatment with deferasirox. Seven (2.48%) patients had a renal AE of 
severe intensity (Six patients aged ≥ 18 years and one patient aged less than 18) and five (1.77%) 
discontinued treatment with deferasirox due to renal AEs (all aged 18 years or older). 
Almost 60% of the patients experiencing a renal AE during the retrospective period took one 
concomitant medication with nephrotoxic effect within 6 months prior to the occurrence of the first 
event between renal adverse event and notable renal laboratory value. 
Thirty-three patients (11.70%) had at least one AE suspected of being related to deferasirox. 
None of the deferasirox-related AEs were serious, all but three were mild to moderate in intensity, and 
in most cases deferasirox was temporarily interrupted or dosage was adjusted and no further action 
was required. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
This study is a retrospective chart review of patients with transfusional hemosiderosis enrolled in the 
deferasirox registration studies (CICL670A0105,106,107,108 and 109) and were treated with at least 
one dose of DFX. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the trend of serum creatinine 
over time in those patients. The long term renal safety is also one of this study’s objectives. 
According to the MAH, SCr was stable throughout the retrospective study until Q42, the last quarter 
with a meaningful amount of available data, and mean values of SCr were around 60 μmol/l, slightly 
higher than the mean baseline value but lower than the mean worst value of the registration studies. 
These results, in patients exposed to deferasirox an average of roughly 10 years, further substantiates 
the reversibility and non-progressive nature of treatment effect on renal function. Within the limits of 
this study related to the lack of data, other renal parameters (urinary protein, urinary creatinine, 
urinary protein/creatinine ratio) also appeared to be stable throughout the retrospective period, with 
values below the worst value reported in the registration studies. It seems, based on the data 
provided, that no significative difference was observed between paediatric and adults groups.  
Finally, only eight patients (2.84%) had at least one serious renal AE, none of which was suspected of 
being related to treatment with deferasirox. Thirty-three patients (11.70%) had AEs suspected of 
being related to deferasirox, which in most cases were mild to moderate in intensity and were 
managed without the need to discontinue treatment permanently. The deferasirox clinical trial program 
reported increases in SCr and renal adverse events in patients treated with deferasirox, concluding 
however that the changes in SCr were dose - dependent and non-progressive with up to 5 years of 
follow-up, and that renal events were manageable with monitoring and dose adjustments and were 
reversible upon discontinuation.

We acknowledge that this retrospective chart review was a unique opportunity to collect historical data 
from patients enrolled in registration studies, especially as more than 90% of the population were 
observed for at least 7 years after completion of registration studies. However, interpretation of these 
data is difficult due to limitations such as the nature “retrospective” and “descriptive” of the study, the 
lack of data available for key renal parameters such as UPCR and CrCl, the methodology used for 
treatment duration calculation. Also, data from safety set cannot allow to assess the role of deferasirox 
on the variation of renal parameters over time as patients received either multiple iron chelators 
(sequential/concomitantly) or other iron chelators (deferoxamine, deferiprone,..). 
Also the main secondary objectives to evaluate renal function parameters in patients who had been 
treated with only deferasirox could not be reached due to the lack of patients in this subgroup (n=5). 
Therefore no conclusion could be drawn on the long term safety of deferasirox based on the results of 
this study. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
This study is a retrospective chart review of patients with transfusional hemosiderosis enrolled in the 
deferasirox registration studies (CICL670A0105,106,107,108 and 109) and were treated with at least 
one dose of DFX. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the trend of serum creatinine 
over time in those patients. The long term renal safety is also one of this study’s objectives.

4.  Additional clarification requested 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this 
procedure: 
1-  The MAH should provide a clear justification of the methodology used for the treatment 
duration calculation with the reason why temporary interruptions in treatment during the 
registration and retrospective periods were not excluded from the calculation and should

provide an accurate estimation of the treatment duration with deferasirox (in patient-year) for 
the safety set (respectively for adults and paediatric patients).  
2-  The MAH should justify for having chosen mean change vs worst value instead of baseline 
value. This should be done and detailed interpretation should be provided.  
3-  Instead of having the mean change in absolute value vs worst value, it would have been more 
appropriate to have the percentage of SCr changes compared to baseline at registration 
enrollment for each quarter. The MAH should provide such data for SCr changes (as well as 
CrCl changes) for each quarter for safety subgroups 2, 3 and 4. A subanalysis for respectively 
for adults and paediatric patients should be also provided. 
4-  Of the 197 patients in safety subgroup 3, we do not known the percentage of patients taking 
deferasirox (monotherapy / sequential/concomitant) during the retrospective period. The MAH 
should clarify and discuss if any renal deterioration is observed in each subgroup taking 
deferasirox (monotherapy / sequential / concomitant) compared with baseline. A subanalysis 
for respectively for adults and paediatric patients should be also provided. 
5-  In the safety subgroup 4, a total of 87 patients (52.41% of subgroup 4) were affected by renal 
AEs in the retrospective period including 18 paediatric patients (<18 years-old). No details 
were provided on the nature of renal AEs in this subgroup. In addition a discrepancy was noted 
with table 14.3.1-6 where a total of 86 patients experienced renal AE (52.12%). The MAH 
should clarify. 
6-  It would be appreciated that the MAH performed a comprehensive safety analysis in the safety 
subgroup n°4 with a description of renal AEs and notable renal function parameters by type of 
patients (i.e patients on deferasirox only, on multiple chelators (by different combinations), 
other single chelators (deferoxamine, deferiprone). A subanalysis for respectively for adults 
and paediatric patients should be also provided. 
7-  The MAH should clarify the definition of “distinct renal AEs by LLT” and clarify what is the 
difference with the total number of renal AEs. 
The timetable is a 30 day response timetable with clock stop.

5.  MAH responses to Request for supplementary information 
1-  The MAH should provide a clear justification of the methodology used for the 
treatment duration calculation with the reason why temporary interruptions in 
treatment during the registration and retrospective periods were not excluded from 
the calculation and should provide an accurate estimation of the treatment duration 
with deferasirox (in patient-year) for the safety set (respectively for adults and 
paediatric patients).  
MAH’s response 
As a retrospective analysis of patients first exposed to deferasirox in the registration trials and their 
open-label extensions, this study was designed to measure the long-term renal safety in patients on 
deferasirox therapy regardless of exposure time and in real treatment practice.  
In real treatment practice, patients are typically on iron chelation as a life-long, chronic therapy, where 
treatment interruptions are common and patients may be on and off treatment. Therefore, the true, 
long-term implications of deferasirox treatment on renal safety would not be reflective how patients 
are actually being treated in practice if the treatment interruptions were excluded from the calculation 
for treatment duration. 
Additionally, as a non-interventional chart review, a specific ongoing treatment was not required; 
patients may have been treated with iron chelators or any other medication at the physician’s 
discretion and according to local prescribing information. During the retrospective period patients have 
been exposed to iron chelators other than deferasirox, on and off, either as single agent or in 
combination treatment. As no single contribution to renal safety can be assessed, this time is also 
included in treatment duration. 
Temporary interruptions are not normally excluded when calculating treatment duration. It should be 
noted that in all of the registration studies and their extensions (CICL670A105, 106, 107, 108, and 
109), temporary interruptions were included as exposure. The calculations for treatment duration in 
Study AIT14 have remained consistent with the previously used statistical methodology during the core 
and extension phase of the respective registration studies. Further, temporary interruptions would not 
significantly impact the overall long-term treatment duration of up to 13 years, particularly in the 
context of assessing the long term renal safety of deferasirox with any exposure. Therefore, an 
analysis including interruption of deferasirox would not derive a new conclusion. 
CHMP comment 
The MAH has clarified that iron chelation is a long term therapy with patients under different types of 
iron chelators. Some of them may be on or off treatment in real life, depending of the disease 
evolution. The MAH cannot provide accurate estimation of the treatment duration with deferasirox in 
the patients enrolled in this study. 
Therefore, the MAH has provided some clarifications but no accurate estimation of treatment duration 
with deferasirox could be obtained for the safety set limiting the interpretation of long term data.

2-  The MAH should justify for having chosen mean change vs worst value instead of 
baseline value. This should be done and detailed interpretation should be provided.  
MAH’s response 
The primary objective of this study was to observe the long-term trends of serum creatinine (SCr) in 
patients exposed to at least one dose of deferasirox during the registration studies. Presenting the 
quarterly changes from the worst value reported during these studies is considered as appropriate in 
an effort to further substantiate the reversibility and non progressive nature of treatment effect on 
renal function. 
See also response to question 3 for requested analysis and interpretation of renal parameters. 
CHMP comment 
The MAH has clarified the fact to have chosen mean change vs worst value is due to further 
substantiate the reversibility and non progressive nature of treatment effect on renal function. In our 
point of view, mean changes vs baseline value could be also useful to follow these renal parameters’ 
evolution.  
3-  Instead of having the mean change in absolute value vs worst value, it would have 
been more appropriate to have the percentage of SCr changes compared to baseline 
at registration enrollment for each quarter. The MAH should provide such data for 
SCr changes (as well as CrCl changes) for each quarter for safety subgroups 2, 3 and 
4. A subanalysis for respectively for adults and paediatric patients should be also 
provided. 
MAH’s response 
Analyses have been carried out to present the quarterly changes of SCr from baseline of the 
registration studies instead of from worst values. The results for safety groups 2, 3 and 4 are 
presented separately for adult and pediatric patients. As mentioned in the clinical study report, only 
few creatinine clearance values were available and no reliable considerations could be drawn from 
them. Therefore, the CrCl by quarterly changes from baseline cannot be provided as requested. 
Available CrCl were provided in table 14.3.2.5 of the study AIT14 CSR. 
Study subgroup 2: Patients (N=62 ) who were on multiple chelators (concomitantly or at 
different times) and other single chelators (deferoxamine, deferiprone, etc.) except 
deferasirox during the retrospective period 
The mean changes from baseline in serum creatinine (SCr) collected quarterly in the retrospective 
period for the overall, adult and pediatric populations are collected and shown in Figure 2-1. 
The mean baseline SCr value was 56.44 ± 10.62 μmol/l overall (range 33.15 – 78.08 μmol/l), 58.69 ± 
9.98 μmol/l (34.45 – 78.08 μmol/l) for patients 18 years or older, and 47.06 ± 7.96 μmol/l (33.15 – 
62.32 μmol/l) for patients under 18 years of age. Given that 50 of the 62 patients in this subgroup 
were adults, the results of this age class closely reflect those of the overall subgroup. 
During the retrospective period, the trend in mean SCr values in the adult population was essentially 
stable until Quarter 45, after which only six patients at most were still under observation and 
mean/median values fluctuated considerably.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

Mean SCr values were slightly higher than baseline (60-65 μmol/l) from Q1 to Q20, with mean changes 
from baseline of around 2-5 μmol/l. Percent changes from baseline ranged from 6% to 13% from Q1 
to Q13 and from 2% to 3% from Q14 to Q20, except for a small negative change from baseline (-1.26 
μmol/l – -0.99%) at Q19. SCr values were then slightly lower than baseline (53 -60 μmol/l) from Q21 
to Q45, with negative mean changes mostly between 0 and -4 μmol/l (0% to -10%). Twelve (12) 
patients made up the pediatric population in this subgroup (patients less than 18 years old at Q1). 
Until Q12, mean creatinine values were mostly between 50 -55 μmol/l, with an increase from baseline 
of around 2-5 μmol/l (7-17%), except at Q3, during which SCr values presented a mean negative 
change from baseline (-2.18 μmol/l – -3.12%). From Q13 on, mean values were slightly higher (54 
and 60 μmol/l) with percent changes from baseline mostly between 14% and 30%. According to the 
MAH, these higher values may, however, reflect the normal proportional increase in SCr absolute 
values related to the greater body muscle mass as pediatric subjects grew over the observation period. 
According to the MAH, these trends suggest that the administration of at least one dose of deferasirox 
during the registration studies, followed by a single chelator other than deferasirox (deferoxamine, 
deferiprone, etc.) or by combinations of iron chelators other than deferasirox (concomitantly or at 
different times) during the retrospective period, did not have a general long -term effect on renal 
function.

Study subgroup 3: Patients (N=197) who reported renal Adverse Events (AE) or confirmed 
notable renal laboratory values during the registration studies. 
The mean changes from baseline in serum creatinine collected quarterly in the registration period for 
the overall, adult and pediatric populations are collected and shown in Figure 2-2.  
Mean SCr at baseline of the registration studies was 53.23 ± 13.72 μmol/l overall (range 26.10 – 
87.96 μmol/l), 56.90 ± 12.74 μmol/l (range 30.95 – 87.96 μmol/l) in adults (N=154), and 40.10 ± 
7.84 μmol/l (range 26.10 – 62.32 μmol/l) in pediatric patients (N=43). Until Q28 of the retrospective 
period, mean SCr values in the adult population were consistently between 62-67 μmol/l, with mean 
change from baseline between 5 and 10 μmol/l, corresponding to a percent change of 12-
21% (except for a spike at Q5: mean value 69.44 μmol/l and change from baseline 12.83 μmol/l – 
27.15%). From Q29 to Q41, mean values then fell progressively, reaching values close to or equal to 
baseline (change from baseline 0-4 μmol/l – 0-9%) before starting to vary considerably due to the 
small number of subjects still under observation. 
The trend for the ˂18 age class of this subgroup was also quite constant, with mean SCr values 
between 50 and 56 μmol/l and a change from baseline of 10-16 μmol/l (27-42%), although Quarters 
26-29 presented slightly greater changes (17-20 μmol/l – 44-54%). These trends indicate that renal 
adverse events occurring during the registration studies overall did not provoke irreversible or 
progressive long-term effects on renal function.

The mean changes from baseline in serum creatinine collected quarterly in the retrospective period for 
the overall, adult (N=132) and pediatric (N=33) populations are collected in Table 14.3-2.21 of the 
Appendix 1- ICL670AIT14-Tables and Figures document and are shown in Figure 2-3.

Mean SCr at baseline of the registration studies was 54.85 ± 13.31 overall (range 28.30 – 87.96 
μmol/l), 58.01 ± 12.37 μmol/l (range 30.95 – 87.96 μmol/l) in adults, and 42.21 ± 8.70 μmol/l (range 
28.30 – 67.18 μmol/l) in patients ˂18 years. 
As in subgroup 2 and subgroup 3, there were no marked changes in the SCr values of adults over the 
retrospective period, at least until the last quarters of data collection c haracterized by few available 
data. Mean SCr values were around 65-67 μmol/l with a change from baseline of 7-9 μmol/l (11-18%) 
until Q13, with a small spike of 69.22 μmol/l (change from baseline 11.30 μmol/l – 23.6%) at Q5. 
Values were then slightly lower and consistently between 62 and 63 μmol/l, with a change from 
baseline of 4-5 μmol/l (9-13%) between Q14 and Q30, and even lower between Q31 and Q36 (60-62 
μmol/l – change from baseline 1-3 μmol/l = 3-8%), before rising slightly in the subsequent quarters. 
Mean values in the pediatric population were stable and around 49-51 μmol/l, with changes from 
baseline of 8-9 μmol/l (17-29%) until Q20. Small spikes are visible in the graph at Q7, Q12 and Q13 
and correspond to values of 52-53 μmol/l with change from baseline of 10-11 μmol/l (29-33%). These 
latter values were again observed between Q21 and Q25. Mean changes after Q25 tended to be higher 
(13-16 μmol/l – 36-40%) until Q29, only to return to values between 6 and 16 μmol/l between Q30 
and Q37. The overall slight trend to higher absolute SCr values over years in time is in line with the 
physical development of a growing pediatric population. 
SCr changes versus baseline were comparable between total subgroup 4 with renal AEs, occurring 
during the retrospective period, and total subgroup 3 and 2, with all of them showing overall stability.

As requested, the MAH has provided figures with SCr changes (with percentage of change) compared 
to baseline at registration enrollment for each quarter in each safety subgroups 2, 3 and 4.

Unfortunately, such data are not available for CrCl changes. Subanalysis for adults and paediatric 
patients have been also provided.  
In summary, in the 3 safety subgroups above, overall stability of SCr mean changes is observed with 
mean changes between -10% to +21% compared with mean baseline values in overall population. 
However, it seems that in sub group 2, mean SCr changes return to baseline (mean) values or even 
less (-10% to 0 % of changes), although in subgroups 3 and 4 (with renal AEs in registration studies 
or during the retrospective period); SCr mean changes is still around +10% compared with mean 
baseline values.  
In the paediatric population, percentage of mean SCr changes is between 7 to 42% depending of 
subgroups but these figures should be taken with caution as the number of children is smaller 
compared with adults and SCr values could change with the physical development of children.  
Issue partially addressed. 
4-  Of the 197 patients in safety subgroup 3, we do not known the percentage of 
patients taking deferasirox (monotherapy / sequential/concomitant) during the 
retrospective period. The MAH should clarify and discuss if any renal deterioration is 
observed in each subgroup taking deferasirox (monotherapy / sequential / 
concomitant) compared with baseline. A subanalysis for respectively for adults and 
paediatric patients should be also provided. 
MAH’s response 
It should be emphasized again, that the focus of this study was to measure the long-term renal safety 
in patients on deferasirox therapy, regardless of exposure time and in real treatment practice. With the 
goal of the study to mimic real-life exposure, it was more clinically meaningful to observe these 
patients as a single group, where patients may have been on and off treatment and using iron 
chelators other than deferasirox, on and off both as single agents, or as combination therapy. 
Over time, the patients in safety subgroup 3 (who reported renal adverse events (AEs) or confirmed 
notable renal values in the registration period) might have had periods of monotherapy, sequential 
therapy, and concomitant administration of deferasirox and other iron chelators, considering that 
treatments were as per physician prescription, and not on a specific schedule. None of the patients had 
only sequential therapy or concomitant therapy exclusively and there was no single treatment pattern 
over time. Thus, it is not possible to identify or differentiate patients as being in a single treatment 
group (monotherapy, sequential therapy, or concomitant therapy), especially in a way that would be 
clinically meaningful. It is known, however, that five patients were treated exclusively with deferasirox 
and no other iron chelators since enrollment in the registration studies (and not only in the 
retrospective period). For completeness, brief narratives of these patients and related renal events are 
presented below: 
 subject had participated in study CICL670A0105 and its extension, and had β –thalassemia 
major as underlying disease. Among the concomitant medications administered during the 
retrospective period, the subject was on enalapril maleate for hypertension between November 2007 
and June 2010. 
Six (6) renal adverse events were reported for this patient between October 2010 and February 2015: 
renal colic – right renal lithiasis, renal colic – right ureteral stone, 2 cases of renal colic and 2 cases of

nephrocalcinosis. All the events were mild in severity, none was suspected of being related to 
deferasirox and no particular action was required except for the use of concomitant medication in some 
cases. Serum creatinine values were stable over the retrospective period (Q1-Q30) and between 0.75-
1 mg/dl. Creatinine clearance values were available only for Q28 (72 ml/min) and Q29 (91 ml/min). 
Urinary protein/creatinine ratios were also steady and between 0.08 and 0.35. 
 subject had participated in study CICL670A0108 and its extension and had myelodysplastic 
syndrome (MDS) as underlying disease. The subject was treated with lenalidomide and steroids for 
myelodysplastic syndrome and subsequently with thioguanine, cytarabine and hydroxyurea for 
progression of MDS to acute myeloid leukemia in March 2008. No iron chelation treatment was 
implemented during the retrospective period. 
No renal adverse events were reported for this patient. Serum creatinine values were available only 
from Q1 to Q8 and were between 0.65 and 0.89 mg/dl. Creatinine clearance and urinary protein data 
were not available. 
 The subject had participated in study CICL670A0108 and its extension, and had myelodysplastic 
syndrome secondary to non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) as underlying disease. NHL was treated first 
with vincristine and prednisone and subsequently with vinblastine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and 
prednisone. The subject also took ramipril for hypertension and metildigoxin, amiodarone and 
carvedilol for atrial arrhythmia. Iron chelation treatments were not administered to this subject during 
the retrospective period. 
The subject was hospitalized due to an increase of creatinine above the upper limit of normal. This 
serious adverse event (SAE) was considered resolved on 22 April 2005 and not related to deferasirox. 
Serum creatinine values were available only from Q1 to Q5 and were between 0.9 and 1.4 mg/dl. 
Creatinine clearance was 61 ml/min at Q1 and Q2, 41-42 ml/min at Q3 and Q4, and 64 ml/min at Q5. 
Urinary protein values were not available.

syndrome as underlying disease. The following concomitant medications were reported for this subject: 
eutirox for hypothyroidism, fosinopril for hypertension, clonazepam as antiepileptic, aspirin as 
antithrombotic agent and hydroxycarbamide for progression of MS. The subject did not take any iron 
chelators during the retrospective period. 
No renal adverse events were reported for this subject and renal laboratory data were available only 
sporadically (Q1, Q8, Q10, Q12, Q14 and Q15). Serum creatinine was 0.6 - 1.0 mg/dl and only 4 
values were available for creatinine clearance: 79.5 ml/min at Q1, 85.9 ml/min at Q8, 54.9 ml/min 
(below lower limit of normal) at Q12 and 39.1 ml/min (below lower limit of normal) at Q15. In the 
Investigator’s judgment, the reductions in creatinine clearance were compatible with weight loss (from 
63 to 46 kg). Urinary protein data were not available.

CHMP comment 
The MAH cannot provide the subanalysis requested. They have argued that the study focuses to 
“measure” the long-term renal safety in patients on deferasirox therapy, regardless of exposure time 
and in real treatment practice. Also, they cannot identify or differentiate patients as being in a single 
treatment group (monotherapy, sequential therapy, or concomitant therapy), especially in a way that 
would be clinically meaningful. 
The deferasirox impact’s on long term renal effects cannot be analysed accurately. Therefore, we 
consider that no reliable conclusion can be drawn from these descriptive data.  
5-  In the safety subgroup 4, a total of 87 patients (52.41% of subgroup 4) were 
affected by renal AEs in the retrospective period including 18 paediatric patients 
(<18 years-old). No details were provided on the nature of renal AEs in this 
subgroup. In addition a discrepancy was noted with table 14.3.1-6 where a total of 
86 patients experienced renal AE (52.12%). The MAH should clarify. 
MAH’s response 
Subgroup 4 (N=165) was made up of patients with reported renal AEs or confirmed notable renal 
laboratory values during the retrospective period. Eighty-six (86) of the 165 patients (52.12%) in 
subgroup 4 reported at least one renal adverse event during the retrospective period: 69 out of the 
132 (52.27%) adult patients and 17 out of the 33 (51.52%) pediatric patients reported at least one 
renal AE. Table 2-1 shows the number of patients affected by renal adverse events by MedDRA System 
Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT). Nephrolithiasis was the most common AE in both age 
groups and was reported in 18.94% (N=25) of patients aged 18 or older and in 18.18% (N=6) of 
patients under 18 years of age. Renal colics were the next most frequent event, espe cially among 
patients aged 18 or older [18.94% (N=25) in adults and 9.09% (N=3) in pediatric patients], followed 
by abnormal urine protein/creatinine ratios (4.55%, N=6 adults and 15.15%, N=5 under 18), 
increased urine protein/creatinine ratios (2.27%, N=3 adults and 6.06%, N=2 under 18) and increased 
blood creatinine (6.82%, N=9 adults and 6.06%, N=2 under 18).

The MAH confirms the total number of 86 patients with at least one renal AE during the retrospective 
period. Details of renal events were provided: main renal events were nephrolithiasis, renal colic and 
UPCR abnormal or increased and SCr increased. 
Clarifications have been given. Issue addressed.

the safety subgroup n°4 with a description of renal AEs and notable renal function 
parameters by type of patients (i.e patients on deferasirox only, on multiple 
chelators (by different combinations), other single chelators (deferoxamine, 
deferiprone). A subanalysis for respectively for adults and paediatric patients should 
be also provided.

(monotherapy, sequential therapy, or concomitant therapy), especially in a way that would be clinically 
meaningful. It is known, however, that 98 patients were treated exclusively with deferasirox for 
various periods of time and no other iron chelators in the retrospective period. For completeness, a 
summary and analysis of these patients showing the percentage of serum creatinine (SCr) changes 
compared to baseline are presented below:  
An additional analysis was performed to assess serum creatinine in patients (N=98) who took only 
deferasirox for iron chelation during the retrospective period. Seventy-one of these patients were 
adults, and 27 were under the age of 18 at Q1. Of note, patients ≥ 18 years had a mean treatment 
duration of 91.25 months with a mean dosage of 1443.12 mg, and patients <18 years were on 
treatment for a mean of 84.73 months with a mean dose of 1431.66 mg. Mean baseline SCr was 50.05 
± 13.69 μmol/L overall (range: 20.35 – 80.00), 54.79 ± 12.25 μmol/L in patients ≥ 18 years (range 
30.95 – 80.00) and 37.57 ± 8.49 μmol/L in patients under ≤18 (range: 20.35 – 59.23). As shown in 
Figure 2-4, SCr values were stable throughout the retrospective period in the adult population and in 
mean between 60-65 μmol/L, corresponding to a 15-20% increase from baseline in most cases. 
It should be noted the majority (71 of the 98 patients) in this overall subgroup were adults, and since 
the total is dominated by the larger adult subpopulation, the modest increase in >18 years between Q1 
and Q30 is reflective of the age distribution and normal growth. Specifically, the median age of the 27 
pediatric patients was 14 years at Q1, with a median age at the time of consensus of 21 years. 
SCr was also quite constant in the pediatric population, with values between 50-55 μmol/L from Q1 to 
Q22 and between 55-60 μmol/L from Q23 to Q32. Compared to baseline, SCr values increased at Q1-
Q23 and slightly more until Q32. The trend of SCr over time is comparable between subgroup 4 
(patients with renal AE occurring during the retrospective study period) and subgroup 2 (patients 
talking chelators other than deferasirox). While a slightly higher absolute change of SCr from baseline 
can be observed in subgroup 4, absolute values of SCr in both subgroups remain generally within the 
limits of normal.

CHMP comment 
The MAH cannot provide the subanalysis requested. They have argued that the study focuses to 
“measure” the long-term renal safety in patients on deferasirox therapy, regardless of exposure time 
and in real treatment practice. Also, they cannot identify or differentiate patients as being in a single

treatment group (monotherapy, sequential therapy, or concomitant therapy), especially in a way that 
would be clinically meaningful. 
The MAH performed an additional analysis on SCr changes for 98 patients who were treated exclusively 
with deferasirox for various periods of time and no other iron chelators in the retrospective period. SCr 
values were stable throughout the retrospective period corresponding to a 15-20% increase from 
baseline in most cases. 
The deferasirox impact’s on long term renal effects cannot be analysed accurately. Therefore, we 
consider that no reliable conclusion can be drawn from these descriptive data.  
7-  The MAH should clarify the definition of “distinct renal AEs by LLT” and clarify what is 
the difference with the total number of renal AEs. 
MAH’s response 
In this study, patients ≥ 18 reported a total of 164 AEs whereas patients <18 reported a total of 40 
events. In this case, all the events were counted even if the same event occurred more than once in 
the same patient when they were younger than 18, and thereafter, when they were older than 18. 
These patients reported 110 vs. 27 different types of AEs by MedDRA low level term (LLT), 
respectively, and the numbers are lower than the ones expressed previously because each LLT is 
counted only once for each patient. Adult patients therefore reported both a greater number of events 
and a greater number of types of events. 
CHMP comment 
Clarifications have been given. Issue addressed. 
6.  Rapporteur’s overall updated conclusion and 
recommendation 
This study is a retrospective chart review of patients with transfusional hemosiderosis enrolled in the 
deferasirox registration studies (CICL670A0105,106,107,108 and 109) and were treated with at least 
one dose of DFX. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the trend of serum creatinine 
over time in those patients. The long term renal safety is also one of this study’s objectives. 
We acknowledge that this retrospective chart review was a unique opportunity to collect historical data 
from patients enrolled in registration studies, especially as more than 90% of the population were 
observed for at least 7 years after completion of registration studies. However, interpretation of these 
data is difficult due to some limitations such as the nature “retrospective” and “descriptive” of the 
study, the lack of data available for key renal parameters such as UPCR and CrCl, the methodology 
used for treatment duration calculation. Also, data from safety set cannot allow to assess the role of 
deferasirox on the variation of renal parameters over time as patients received either multiple iron 
chelators (sequential/concomitantly) or other iron chelators (deferoxamine, deferiprone,..). 
Also the main secondary objectives to evaluate renal function parameters in patients who had been 
treated with only deferasirox could not be reached due to the lack of patients in this subgroup (n=5).

The MAH reminded that the concept of this study would be to observe the long-term trends of overall 
renal function from patients charts of those who were enrolled into the deferasirox registration studies 
and it was recommended (in Apr 2014 after ANSM consultation meeting with the CHMP vice chairman) 
to include data from patients not treated with deferasirox during the retrospective period in order to 
differentiate disease from chelation effects. In real-life practice, patients are on iron chelation as a 
long-life, chronic therapy where treatment interruption are frequent and patients may be on and off 
treatment. Therefore, no accurate estimation of deferasirox exposure can be calculated. 
As requested, the MAH performed an analysis of SCr mean change vs baseline value (instead of worst 
value). Despite an overall stability of mean SCr values, the mean SCR changes are between [-10% to 
+21%]. In sub group 2, mean SCr changes return to baseline (mean) values or even less (-10% to 0 
% of changes), although in subgroups 3 and 4; SCr mean changes is still around +10% compared with 
mean baseline values. 
According to the MAH, this study focuses to “measure” the long-term renal safety in patients on 
deferasirox therapy, regardless of exposure time and in real treatment practice. Also, they cannot 
identify or differentiate patients as being in a single treatment group (monotherapy, sequential 
therapy, or concomitant therapy), especially in a way that would be clinically meaningful.  
The clarifications data provided by the MAH cannot allow to better characterize the impact of 
deferasirox therapy on the long term renal safety profile of these patients.  
Therefore we maintain that no reliable conclusion could be drawn on the long term safety of 
deferasirox based on this study’s results.

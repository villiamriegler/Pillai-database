Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for nintedanib, the scientific conclusions 
of CHMP are as follows:  
Scientific conclusions and grounds for variation to the terms of the marketing authorisations  
Medicines that block vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) such as nintedanib might be 
associated with an increased risk of bleeding. In the 2 main studies with nintedanib, more patients 
treated with nintedanib than with placebo had bleeding events (10.3 % versus 7.8%). 
In the postmarketing period a total of 91 individual case safety reports of haemorrhage (74 from the 
patient support programme and 17 from spontaneous sources) were reported with nintedanib. Twenty-
nine (29) cases (31.9%) were serious, 62 (68.1%) were non-serious. One case (1.1%) was fatal. Of the 
29 serious cases reporting a haemorrhagic event, epistaxis was the most common event. Of the 91 
reported cases 29 patients were on concomitant anticoagulant or antithrombotic therapy (11 serious 
cases and 18 non serious), 14 patients were on concomitant therapy that could cause bleeding and 48 
cases contained no data on this type of therapy. There was also one case with positive re-challenge with 
no concomitant drugs reported. 
Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR, the PRAC considered that changes to the 
product information of medicinal products containing nintedanib (respiratory indication) were warranted.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for nintedanib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing nintedanib is favourable subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied.

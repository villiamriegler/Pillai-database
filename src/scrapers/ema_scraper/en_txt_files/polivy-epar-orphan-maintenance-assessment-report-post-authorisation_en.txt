2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2017 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing polatuzumab vedotin was 
considered justified based on clinical observations supporting improved survival in 
relapsed/refractory patients when the proposed treatment is added on to other existing 
treatments; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to involvement of single or multiple nodal or extra nodal 
sites, including the gastrointestinal tract and bone marrow and life-threatening with 5-year survival 
rates reported as low as approximately 25% for high risk patients; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 4.3 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made. 
although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition exist in the European Union, the 
sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal product 
containing polatuzumab vedotin will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. The 
sponsor has provided non-clinical and preliminarily clinical observations in relapsed/refractory 
patients supporting add-on effects in terms of clinical response and survival, when the product is 
combined with other existing treatments. The Committee considered that this constitutes a 
clinically relevant advantage. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
type II variation 
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common histological subtype of non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma (NHL) in adults. It comprises a group of aggressive lymphoid malignancies histologically 
characterised by dense proliferation of neoplastic B-cells. 
DLBCL arises from a mature B-cell and is usually comprised of cells resembling large centroblasts or 
immunoblasts, two distinct types of activated B-cells. These cells typically express the B-cell markers 
CD19 and CD20 as well as other surface markers characteristic for B-cell lineage (Martelli et al., 2013). 
The molecular pathogenesis of DLBCL is complex and includes both genetic lesions that are relatively 
specific for this disease (i.e., rearrangements of BCL6) and molecular alterations that are shared with 
other NHL variants. In addition to occurring de novo, DLBCL can arise through the transformation of 
many different types of low-grade B-cell lymphomas, including B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia 
(e.g., Richter's transformation), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, marginal zone 
(MALT) lymphoma, and splenic marginal zone lymphoma. 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000074173 
Page 4/12 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients with DLBCL often present with single or multiple rapidly enlarging symptomatic masses, with 
up to 40% occurring at extra-nodal sites (Martelli et al., 2013). The disease usually affects adults, 
especially around the age of 60 to 70 years, but also rarely occurs in adolescents and children. 
In 2016, the WHO updated the previous 2008 classification of lymphoid neoplasms to include 2 sub-
types of DLBCL based on cells of origin (GCB and ABC) as well as recognising co-expression of MYC 
and BCL2 as double-expressor lymphoma (DEL) (Swerdlow, Blood 2016; 127: 2375-2390). A new 
category of ‘high grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC, BCL2 and/ or BCL6 translocations’ (HGBL-DH and 
HGBL-TH) was created for all double- or triple hit lymphomas (DHL/THL) other than follicular 
lymphomas or lymphoblastic lymphomas. Overall, HGBL-DH/TH represented about 8% of cases of 
DLBCL (Scott et al., 2018). Despite these changes in sub-classifications, the condition DLBCL is still 
considered a suitable orphan condition. 
The approved therapeutic indication “Polivy in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin, and prednisone (R-CHP) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously 
untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)’’ falls within the scope of the designated orphan 
condition “Treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk (B/R) assessment of the CHMP. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
The sponsor discussed the severity of the disease and noted that the clinical course of DLBCL can be 
chronically debilitating due to constitutional symptoms, local symptoms of lymphadenopathy, end-
organ damage from disease involvement, and bone marrow failure that may lead to infections, 
anaemia, and thrombocytopenia. 
The sponsor also discussed the life-threatening nature of the disease with a median survival of less 
than one year if left untreated. The International Prognostic Index (IPI) for aggressive NHL identifies 
five factors obtained at diagnosis that are prognostic for outcomes including progression-free survival 
(PFS) and overall survival (OS). Patients with higher IPI scores, combined with biologically defined 
higher-risk patients (including the ABC, DHL, and DEL subtypes of DLBCL), represent the subset of 
patients with the poorest outcomes with current therapies. For example, patients with IPI 3-5 have a 
5-year PFS ranging from 39% to 54% (Zhou et al., 2014). Furthermore, of the patients who proceed 
to transplant, only 30 to 40% will be cured (Gisselbrecht et al., 2010; Crump et al., 2017). However, 
most patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) DLBCL are ineligible for autologous stem cell 
transplantation (ASCT) due to their age, co-morbidities or chemotherapy insensitive disease and the 
treatment approach for such patients in the second line setting as well as for all patients beyond 
second line is a palliative approach. New therapies and regimens represent considerable progress in r/r 
DLBCL, but the outcome of patients treated in each subsequent lines of therapy is progressively 
poorer, and most patients either do not respond or do not have a durable response to these 
treatments (Sehn et al., 2021). 
The COMP agreed that the condition remains chronically debilitating due to constitutional symptoms, 
local symptoms of lymphadenopathy, end-organ damage from disease involvement, and bone marrow 
failure that may lead to infections, anaemia, and thrombocytopenia, and life-threatening in patients 
with r/r disease who do not respond to treatment.

Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor performed a review of epidemiological data to establish the prevalence of DLBCL in 
Europe. Published data on prevalence for DLBCL were directly extracted from the population-based 
cancer registries for the Nordic countries (NORDCAN: Denmark, Faroe Islands, Finland, Greenland, 
Iceland, Norway, and Sweden; 2019 data), the Integraal Kankercentrum Nederland (IKNL, The 
Netherlands; 2021 data), the Italian Association of Cancer Registries (AIRTUM, Italy; 2020 data), the 
national Slovenian Cancer Registry (2018 data), the German cancer registry Robert Koch Institute 
(2018 data), the Spanish Registry (REDECAN; 2020 data), and the Belgium Cancer Registry (2018 
data). Prevalence data for non-EU countries were also obtained from the two population-based cancer 
registries the Haematological Malignancy Research Network (HMRN: Yorkshire region in the UK; 2004-
2016 data), and the Surveilance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program in US (representing 
28% of the US population; 2018 data) as points of reference. The prevalence estimates (per 10,000) 
extracted from these databases with cancer statistics in the 27 EU countries (EU27), UK and USA are 
presented in Table 1. 
The sponsor argued that not all patients who have ever been diagnosed with DLBCL and are alive 
today should be considered a “DLBCL patient” because firstly, after approximately 2 years post 
diagnosis, the rate of observed survival in DLBCL patients reflects the rate of expected survival in the 
background population (statistical cure); and second, even if patients do have a late relapse and have 
a survival outcome that matches the background population, the probability of relapse for any incident 
cohort peaks at 7 years at around 28-30%. The sponsor considered that to reflect all the groups of 
patients who would be considered in the non-cured pool (i.e., due to diagnosis, treatment as new case 
or relapsed, and various modes of monitoring), the affected population would be better reflected using 
a 10-year limited duration for the prevalence estimate and based on Europe sources only. 
Based on these assumptions and the review of the epidemiological data sources found, the sponsor 
concluded on an average 10-year prevalence for DLBCL of 4.28 per 10,000 persons in the EU.

9 The EU27 estimate for the year 2022 is based on the latest observed data. Each prevalence estimate for the 
EU27 is an average based on population-based registry data available. 
The COMP agreed with the sponsor’s proposal and concluded that the prevalence is 4.3 in 10,000 
persons in the European community based on most recent publications and updated registries. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
The sponsor referred to the latest ESMO guidelines for DLBCL, which describe some of the treatment 
strategies available to these patients in Europe and outlined the current standard of care (SOC) in the 
first-line setting based on European and American treatment guidelines as summarised below (Tilly et 
al., 2015; NCCN 2021) (Figure 1). An overview of the existing agents used as part of the regimens in 
the EU for the treatment of DLBCL was also provided in Table 2. The indications for the approved 
agents (except for rituximab) among patients in the first-line setting are not specific for DLBCL, but 
rather for NHL. The ESMO guidelines therefore provide further clarity as to what treatments are used 
for patients with DLBCL among the approved agents.

Polivy (polatuzumab vedotin) was approved in the EU (Procedure No. EMEA/H/C/004870) on 16-Jan-
2020 and is authorised in combination with bendamustine and rituximab for the treatment of adult 
patients with r/r DLBCL who are not candidates for haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (SCT). 
This extension of the indication for Polivy in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin, and prednisone (R-CHP) is intended to include treatment of adult patients with previously 
untreated DLBCL in the first-line setting. The sponsor argued that rituximab in combination with 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (R-CHOP) remains the prevailing SOC 
regimen for the intended patient population. This was supported by efficacy outcomes reported for 
other regimens compared to R-CHOP. According to the current ESMO guidelines, R-CHOP is considered 
a satisfactory method of treatment relevant for a discussion on the significant benefit of Polivy in 
previously untreated DLBCL. The COMP agreed with the sponsor that the only satisfactory method of 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000074173 
Page 9/12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
treatment for the target DLBCL population of this new Polivy indication is R-CHOP, the SOC in first line 
therapy. 
Significant benefit 
The sponsor argued that polatuzumab vedotin represents an important new therapeutic option for 
adult patients with previously untreated DLBCL and claimed significant benefit in terms of improved 
efficacy based on a substantive improvement in both PFS and event-free survival (EFS) over the SOC 
first line R-CHOP regimen, which has been the SOC for these patients for two decades. The sponsor did 
not seek protocol assistance for the justification of significant benefit. 
The primary data supporting the efficacy and safety of polatuzumab vedotin (pola) in the proposed 
extension of indication are obtained from a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
phase 3 study called GO39942 (hereafter referred to as POLARIX). The study is designed to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of pola in combination with R-CHP versus R-CHOP in previously untreated 
patients with DLBCL. A schematic representation of the study design is shown in Figure 2. 
Figure 2.  Overview of the Design of Study GO39942 
DLBCL: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; ECOG PS: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status; IPI: 
International Prognostic Index; Q21D: every 21 days; R: randomization; R-CHOP: rituximab plus 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone; R-CHP: rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, 
and prednisone. 
The primary objective of study GO39942 was to evaluate the efficacy of pola+R-CHP compared with R-
CHOP with respect to PFS as determined by the investigator. The primary endpoint PFS is defined as 
the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression or relapse as determined by 
the investigator, or death from any cause, whichever occurs earlier. Key secondary efficacy endpoints 
were included in a hierarchical testing procedure in the following order: EFS as determined by the 
investigator, CR rate at end of treatment by FDG-PET as determined by BICR, and OS. 
A reduction in relative risk of disease progression, relapse, or death by 27% was observed in newly 
diagnosed patients with DLBCL treated in the pola+R-CHP arm (stratified HR: 0.73 [95% CI: 0.57, 
0.95]; two-sided log-rank p-value=0.0177, two-sided α=0.05), with a minimum of 24 months from 
study enrolment in both treatment arms. The results of all sensitivity analyses were consistent with the 
results of the primary analysis of PFS in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Moreover, a significant 
reduction in the risk of occurrence of disease by 25% was observed in patients treated in the pola+R-
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000074173 
Page 10/12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CHP arm compared to patients treated in the R-CHOP arm (stratified HR: 0.75 [95% CI: 0.58, 0.96, 
p=0.0177]). 
The sponsor emphasised that the pivotal phase 3, comparative study POLARIX met its primary efficacy 
endpoint and demonstrated a statistically significant PFS improvement with the combination of 
polatuzumab vedotin and R-CHP over R-CHOP in the ITT population, inclusive of the high-risk 
subpopulations with poor prognostic factors. The study design stipulated that all patients were followed 
for at least 24 months after treatment initiation, which covers the period when most of the disease 
relapses occur, thus ensuring that the observed treatment benefits of polatuzumab vedotin are 
reliable, particularly with respect to the primary endpoint of PFS. At the 2-year mark, treatment with 
polatuzumab vedotin plus R-CHP resulted in a higher proportion of patients alive and progression-free 
compared to R-CHOP (76.7% versus 70.2%, respectively). Consistent with the study results on the 
primary endpoint, in the randomized comparison, polatuzumab vedotin plus R-CHP showed a 
statistically significant improvement in the formally tested key secondary efficacy endpoint EFS. 
The COMP concluded that the results from the pivotal, comparative study POLARIX can justify the 
claim of significant benefit of the combination of polatuzumab vedotin and R-CHP based on improved 
PFS and EFS over the well-established SOC regimen R-CHOP for adult patients with previously 
untreated DLBCL.

4.  COMP position adopted on 25 March 2022 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product. 
the prevalence of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was 
estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be 4.3 in 10,000 persons in the 
European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to constitutional symptoms, local symptoms of 
lymphadenopathy, end-organ damage from disease involvement, and bone marrow failure that 
may lead to infections, anaemia, and thrombocytopenia, and life-threatening in patients not 
responding to treatment; 
although satisfactory methods for the treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union, the assumption that Polivy may be of potential significant benefit in patients with 
previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma still holds. This is based on an improvement in 
progression free survival and event free survival when Polivy is used in combination with 
rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (R-CHP) as compared to standard of 
care regimen (R-CHOP). The COMP considered that the product offers a clinically relevant 
advantage. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Polivy, polatuzumab vedotin, for 
treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (EU/3/18/2013) is not removed from the Community 
Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

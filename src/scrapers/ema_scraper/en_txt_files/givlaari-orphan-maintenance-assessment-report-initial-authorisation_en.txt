2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2016 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing synthetic double-stranded 
siRNA oligonucleotide directed against delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 mRNA covalently linked 
to a ligand containing three N-acetylgalactosamine residues was considered justified based on 
preclinical data demonstrating a significant reduction of levels of aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and 
porphobilinogen (PBG) in the serum; 
the condition is life-threatening due to paralysis and respiratory arrest during an attack and 
chronically debilitating due to attacks, which are causing pain, nausea, seizures and skin blistering; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 0.1 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made; 
in addition, although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in 
the European Union, the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the 
medicinal product containing synthetic double-stranded siRNA oligonucleotide directed against 
delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 mRNA covalently linked to a ligand containing three N-
acetylgalactosamine residues will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition.  The 
sponsor has provided preclinical data that demonstrate a faster downregulation of the neurotoxic 
intermediate metabolites, aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen, in the serum as compared to 
the authorised product.  Additionally, a single administration of the product resulted in a lasting 
response, which is not achievable by the use of the authorised product.  The Committee considered 
that this constitutes a clinically relevant advantage. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
The sponsor did not report any change to the classification of the condition or changes in diagnostic 
criteria. The condition remains acceptable as it was at the time of the initial orphan designation. 
The approved therapeutic indication “'Treatment of Acute Hepatic Porphyria (AHP) in adults and 
adolescents aged 12 years and older” falls within the scope of the designated orphan condition 
“treatment of acute hepatic porphyria”. 
Acute hepatic porphyria (AHP) is a family of rare, serious, and severely debilitating genetic disorders of 
liver heme synthesis.  Symptoms are due to the accumulation of the neurotoxic heme formation 
products aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG), caused by increased expression of the 
delta-aminolevulinate synthase 1 (ALAS1) enzyme.  
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report 
Page 4/12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There are 4 AHP subtypes, each involving a defect in a distinct heme pathway enzyme: acute 
intermittent porphyria (AIP) caused by mutations in hydroxymethylbilane synthase gene (HMBS; also 
known as PBG deaminase), hereditary coproporphyria (HCP) caused by mutations in 
coproporphyrinogen oxidase gene, variegate porphyria (VP) caused by mutations in 
protoporphyrinogen oxidase gene, and ALA dehydratase (ALAD) deficient porphyria (ADP) caused by 
mutations in ALA dehydratase gene (Anderson, Bloomer et al. 2005) (Bissell and Wang 2015). AIP is 
the most common AHP subtype, occurring in approximately 80% of cases. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP (see 
EPAR). 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
There have been no changes to the life-threatening and chronically debilitating nature of the condition 
since the orphan drug designation in 2016.  There have there been no newly approved therapies since 
that time. 
Acute porphyria attacks typically require urgent medical attention in a healthcare setting, and some 
attacks with progressive motor weakness, paralysis, or respiratory failure require prolonged 
hospitalization and rehabilitation, and neurologic damage can be permanent. An attack is often serious, 
and carries potential for permanent disability, and where specific treatment is delayed or not available, 
attacks can be life-threatening. Up to 65% of AHP patients suffer impaired physical functioning and 
ongoing symptoms between attacks, of which chronic pain is the most common one.  
Long-term complications and comorbidities of AHP include chronic kidney disease, depression, anxiety, 
hypertension, irreversible neuropathy sometimes leading to quadriplegia, and liver disease. More than 
50% of AHP patients have hypertension and chronic kidney disease. 
AHP continues to be a chronically debilitating and potentially life-threatening condition. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor performed a literature search and identified a number of publications reporting the 
incidence of AHP and also referred to patient registries, which are a source of prevalence estimates.

European Countries 
Abbreviations:  AIP=acute intermittent porphyria; HCP=hereditary coproporphyria; N/A=not applicable; UK=United 
Kingdom; VP=variegate porphyria. 
Adapted from Elder et al. 2013 which reports data from the European registry for porphyria 
aPrevalence calculated by multiplying the incidence by a multiplier.  Per Elder et al., 45 was used as the multiplier 
for AIP and 40 for VP; multiplier of 40 assumed for HCP.  Overall prevalence described above is calculated from ‘all 
countries above’ for AIP, VP and HCP and is converted to incidence per 100,000. 
Based on the calculated prevalence of 0.101 per 10,000, and the most recent EU population estimate 
(January 2015) of 508.2 million people, the estimated number of patients with AHP is 5,133. This 
confirms that the prevalence of AHP has not changed since the initial designation. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
Anderson et. al. (2005) lay down recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of the acute 
porphyria, which were based on the clinical experience of the experts on acute porphyria and their 
review of the literature.   
In patients experiencing acute attacks or those patients who fail to respond to supportive measures, 
treatment with IV hemin (3-4 mg/kg/day × 3-5 days) is recommended.  Hemin therapy is approved as 
Normosang® (Normosang SmPC 2017) (heme arginate) in the EU.  Hemin is a blood-derived product 
that has been marketed since 1999 in the EU.  Normosang is indicated for the treatment of acute 
attacks of hepatic porphyria (AIP, HCP, and VP). 
While hemin is currently only approved for the use during acute attacks, in some patients with a 
history of severe or recurrent attacks, it is administered prophylactically (e.g., given every 1 to 2 
weeks) off-label by some specialists, as an attempt to prevent attacks.  However, prospective 
confirmatory studies regarding the use of hemin as prophylaxis are lacking. Data from a prospective, 
international, observational study in 112 patients with Acute Hepatic Porphyria with Recurrent Attacks 
(EXPLORE study), showed that 46% still suffered from attacks despite the chronic treatment with   
hemin prophylaxis.

Significant benefit 
Alnylam received advice from the COMP on demonstrating significant benefit in the study program. 
COMP agreed that a single pivotal placebo-controlled Phase 3 study (ALN-AS1-003; ENVISION) could 
be sufficient to establish significant benefit for the purpose of orphan drug maintenance, specifically 
the final advice letter noted: 
“In case the CHMP decides that the benefit/risk assessment is in favour for givosiran and if the 
Applicant can demonstrate a patient relevant/clinically significant reduction in acute severe attacks as 
well as a good safety profile, the data of the proposed single pivotal Phase 3 study could be sufficient 
to maintain orphan status.” 
The primary endpoint was a composite endpoint AAR (annualised attack rate, including non-
overlapping porphyria attacks requiring either hospitalization, or requiring urgent healthcare visit, or 
porphyria attacks requiring IV hemin administration at home in AIP patients over the 6-month 
treatment period.  
Pivotal Study 003 met its primary endpoint, demonstrating that 2.5 mg/kg once monthly givosiran 
treatment led to statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction of 74% in the AAR 
(Annualized Attack Rate of the composite primary endpoint) compared to placebo in AIP patients (rate 
ratio=0.26, p<0.0001). Further, givosiran resulted in a 73% reduction in AAR compared to placebo in 
the overall AHP patient population (rate ratio=0.27, p=1.356×10-8), a secondary endpoint (Table 2).

aNegative binomial regression analysis was not performed for this component because <10 patients had this type of 
attack. 
Note: Composite attacks were attacks that required hospitalization, urgent healthcare visit, or IV hemin 
administration at home.  The mean AAR, rate ratio, and the corresponding 95% CI for comparing 2.5 mg/kg 
givosiran versus placebo were calculated if ≥10 patients had an attack using the negative binomial regression 
model with treatment group and stratification factors (prior hemin prophylaxis status and historical attack rates) as 
fixed effects and the logarithm of the follow-up time as an offset variable. A rate ratio <1 represents a favorable 
outcome for 2.5 mg/kg givosiran. 
In AIP patients who had at least 1 composite attack, the median composite AAR was significantly lower 
in the givosiran treatment arm, than in the placebo arm. 
During the 6-month DB period, patients with AIP treated with givosiran had a rapid and sustained 
decrease in attacks, as defined by the composite primary endpoint, after the first dose compared to 
placebo. For placebo patients, the attack rate remained stable over time.

Note: Month 0 represents 6 months prior to randomization, and the estimate is calculated as total number of 
attacks/total duration in months. Month 1 and beyond were categorized relative to the first dose of study drug, and 
the estimate was calculated as total number of attacks/total number of patients reached that month. One month = 
28 days was used in categorization. 
Givosiran also demonstrated a statistically significant reduction on secondary endpoints such as 
biomarker ALA (aminolevulinic acid) and PBG (porphobilinogen) levels, and hemin use, and daily worst 
pain (Table 4), supporting the clinical relevance of the treatment effect.

In conclusion, the data obtained with the use of givosiran in prevention of attacks, which cannot be 
achieved with hemin, and the significant reductions in annualised attack rate and reduced use of 
hemin, supports the claim of significant benefit over current treatment options.

The COMP concluded that:  
•

• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of acute hepatic porphyria (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was 
estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be 0.1 in 10,000 persons in the 
European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the  condition  is  life-threatening  due  to  paralysis  and  respiratory  arrest  during  an  attack  and 
chronically debilitating due to attacks, which are causing pain, nausea, seizures and sometimes skin 
blistering; 
although satisfactory methods for the treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union, the assumption that Givlaari may be of potential significant benefit to those 
affected by the orphan condition does hold. The sponsor demonstrated in the pivotal clinical trial in 
patients that Givlaari significantly reduced the rate of severe attacks and consequently reduced the 
need for the use of hemin. The committee considered that this constitutes a clinically relevant 
advantage.  
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Givlaari, synthetic double-
stranded siRNA oligonucleotide directed against delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 mRNA, covalently 
linked to a ligand containing three N-acetylgalactosamine residues, givosiran for treatment of acute 
hepatic porphyria (EU/3/16/1731) is not removed from the Community Register of Orphan Medicinal 
Products.

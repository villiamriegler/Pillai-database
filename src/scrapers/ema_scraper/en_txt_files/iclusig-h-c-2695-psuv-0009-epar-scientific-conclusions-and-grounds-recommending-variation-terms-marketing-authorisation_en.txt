Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Iclusig, the scientific conclusions of 
PRAC are as follows:  
The PRAC reviewed a new safety analysis submitted with the PSUR, which was based on additional data 
from the pivotal trials, providing updated incidences of adverse reactions reported with ponatinib, and 
showing that updated frequency categories for a number of adverse reactions already labelled in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC and relevant section of the Package Leaflet needed revisions. Consequently, 
an increase in the frequency category was proposed for: upper respiratory tract infection, insomnia, 
dizziness, eyelid oedema, aspartate aminotransferase increased, dermatitis exfoliative, muscle 
spasms, pain. 
Therefore, in view of available data, the PRAC considered that changes to the product information were 
warranted.    
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Iclusig, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance PONATINIB is favourable subject to 
the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

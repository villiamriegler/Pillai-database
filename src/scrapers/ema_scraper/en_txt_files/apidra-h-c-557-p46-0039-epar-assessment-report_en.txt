Description 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
Primary 
• 
To observe the proportions of patients who achieved HbA1c level < 8% in children aged 6-
12 years and < 7.5 % in adolescents aged 13-17 years, at 6 and 12 months of treatment. 
The target HbA1c was chosen to meet the American Diabetes Association (ADA) age-
specific recommendations. 
Secondary 
• 
To observe changes from baseline in HbA1c levels at 6 and 12 months of insulin glulisine 
treatment

• 
• 
To observe changes from baseline in daily dose of insulin glargine and insulin glulisine at 6 
and 12 months of treatment 
To observe the monthly rate of hypoglycaemia events per patient reported from the 
baseline to the end of the study. 
Study design 
This was a national, multi-centre, non-comparative, open-label, prospective phase IV study, 
conducted between 17 May 2011 (date first patient enrolled) and 18 October 2012 (date last 
patient completed the study). The study was conducted in 8 centres in Russia. 
The total duration of study participation for each patient was approximately 12 months, including 
the following 2 periods: 
• A screening period of 1-2 weeks 
• A treatment observation period of 12 months. 
Study population /Sample size 
Number of subjects 
Originally 210 subjects were planned for enrolment in the study. However, samples of insulin 
glulisine were provided to patients during the study and during the study it became apparent that 
insulin glulisine was not included in the Federal reimbursement list as it was expected before the 
study start. In Russia all patients with T1 Diabetes have status of invalids and receive insulin free 
of charge mostly through the Federal Reimbursement list. Therefore, it was a common decision of 
the team (Medical, CSU) to limit the number of patients up to 100 to avoid further switching to 
another insulin after the study end and focus on enrolment only in regions where patients were 
capable to receive insulin glulisine after the study end. This study adjustment was approved by 
independent National Ethical Committee 
Diagnosis and criteria for inclusion 
Children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years, with T1DM of duration of more than 1 year and 
inadequate glycaemic control (8% ≤ HbA1c ≤ 10%) were enrolled in the present study. Patients 
were treated, before the start of the study, with insulin glargine and any short acting insulin as a 
basal-bolus regimen; they were able to perform self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) as 
requested by the study protocol; and they had a signed consent form.

Dose regimen: 
Patients were treated with insulin glargine and insulin glulisine in basal-bolus regimen. 
Insulin glargine: continued titration according to recommendations of treatment children and 
adolescents. The administration of insulin glargine was done once daily through a subcutaneous 
injection. The dose of insulin glargine was individually adjusted. 
Insulin glulisine: the initial dose of insulin glulisine was selected individually. Physicians were 
advised to use the calculation based on carbohydrate counting. The administration of insulin 
glargine was done before meal (0-15) minutes, or within 20 minutes after a meal start. Dose was 
titrated in accordance with the algorithm to achieve the following targets: 
Plasma glucose levels before meals: 
Children 6-12 years including 5-10 mmol / L; 
Children 13-17 years old 5-7,3 mmol / L; 
Plasma glucose levels at bedtime / night: 
Children 6-12 years including 5,6-10 mmol/ L; 
Children 13-17 years old 5-8,4 mmol / L; 
Assessment of the treatment regimen compliance  
The treating physician analysed the detailed information about the precise dose and the time to 
administrate insulin on days when the glycaemic profile was conducted. This information was 
inserted in the patient’s self-control diary. 
Dose titration was based on the results of the patient’ own monitoring of glucose level. For this 
purpose patients used glucose meters to define the plasma glucose. The latter were provided by 
the sponsor at the beginning of the study. 
No extra assessment of the treatment regimen compliance was conducted. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy 
Primary endpoint 
• 
The proportions of patients who achieved HbA1c level < 8% in children aged 6-12 years 
old, and < 7.5 % in adolescents aged 13-17 years old, at 6 and 12 months of treatment. 
Secondary endpoints 
•  Mean change from baseline in HbA1c levels at 6 and 12 months of treatment in the overall 
population and in each age subgroup (i.e. children and adolescents) 
•  Mean change from baseline in daily dose of insulin glulisine at 6 and 12 months of 
treatment in the overall population and in each age subgroup. 
Safety 
Safety was assessed through recording the monthly rate of hypoglycaemia events per patient from 
baseline to the end of the study; all adverse events (AEs) including serious adverse events (SAE) 
at each visit; and assessment of vital signs, physical examination (including body weight) and 
laboratory results.

Hypoglycaemic events were categorised based on the following definitions: 
•  Symptomatic hypoglycaemia was defined as event with typical symptoms of hypoglycaemia 
following blood glucose change ≤ 3.9 mmol/L 
•  Nocturnal hypoglycaemia was defined as event, which happened during the sleep time 
(after falling asleep or before wakeup) 
•  Severe hypoglycaemia was defined as an event with clinical symptoms that are considered 
to result from hypoglycaemia, requiring the assistance of another person for active 
administration of carbohydrate, glucagon or other countermeasure because the patient 
could not treat her/himself. 
Statistical Methods 
The study was aimed to observe the proportions of patients who achieved HbA1c target during the 
study period. It did not test any specific hypothesis. 
All the studied populations were described using descriptive statistics. 
Efficacy 
The efficacy population was defined as population of patients who received at least one dose of 
insulin glulisine, signed an informed consent, and had no inclusion/exclusion criteria violations 
(modified ITT population). 
Safety 
Safety population was defined as population of patients who received at least one dose of insulin 
glulisine as reported in the case report form (CRF).  
Hypoglycemic events were collected during the study treatment. Treating physicians collected 
information recorded in patient’s “Self-control diary” and reported it in the CRF. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Overall, 100 patients were enrolled in the study, of whom 90 patients were treated and analysed in 
the mITT population. The remaining 10 patients were excluded due to protocol non-compliance 
linked to the Investigational Product (insulin glargine): During the monitor’s call it was noticed that 
the investigator in one study centre provided to these 10 enrolled patients insulin cartridges 
through a federal reimbursement program (like real practice) rather than the study samples of 
insulin.  
In addition, one patient (age group from 6 to 12 years old) was lost to follow-up after refusal to 
take part on study visit 13.  
A total of 89 patients completed the study. 
Baseline data 
The efficacy analysis population (mITT) included 44/90 (48.9%) female and 46/90 (51.1%) male 
patients.

The median age was 12.5 years: 45 patients were in range 6 -12 years old (50%) and the other 45 
were in range 13 -17 years old (50%).  
The mean ±SD diabetes mellitus duration was 5.51±3.08 years (median = 5 years).  
Mean ±SD weight was 48.9±16.6 kg; mean ±SD body mass index (BMI) was 19.5±3.2 kg/m2. 
Efficacy results 
Primary efficacy analysis: 
Patients 6-12 years old 
In this subgroup, 22/45 (48.9%) of patients and 23/45 (51.1%) of patients achieved HbA1c < 8% 
at 6 and 12 months of treatment, respectively.  
14/45 patients (31.1%) achieved HbA1c < 8% at 12 months of treatment without symptomatic 
hypoglycaemia episodes. 
Patients 13-17 years old 
In this subgroup, 10/45 (22.2%) of patients and 14/45 (31.1%) of patients achieved HbA1c < 
7.5% at 6 and 12 months of treatment respectively.  
6/45 patients (13.3%) achieved HbA1c < 7.5% at 12 months of treatment without symptomatic 
hypoglycaemia episodes. 
Assessor’s Comments: 
Patients recruited into Study APIDR_L_04884 had ‘poor glycaemic control’ as defined by ‘8% ≤ 
HbA1c ≤ 10%’. No details or discussion are provided by the MAH as to the potential reasons for 
their previous poor glycaemic control. Compliance in this study was assessed by review of entries 
in the patient’s self-control diary. 
On review of the percentage of patients that achieved age-specific pre-specified Hba1C levels, 
these are generally in-keeping with those seen in the previously conducted pivotal trial 
(HMR1964D-3001 – parallel-group controlled study) in paediatric subjects supporting the variation 
to extend the indication for Apidra to adolescents and children aged 6 years and above that was 
approved in 2008.   
Secondary efficacy analysis: 
Dynamics of the glycated (HbA1c) evaluation 
Assessment of the dynamics of the level of HbA1c against the background of the conducted insulin 
therapy was carried out in each age group after 3 (visit 6), 6 (visit 10), 9 (visit 14) and 12 (visit 
18) months since the beginning of therapy.

Assessor’s Comments: 
At 12 months, in both age groups, a clinically relevant reduction in mean Hba1c levels was seen. 
Reductions in HbA1c levels were apparent at the 3 month visit and continued through to 12 
months. 
Analysis of the insulin dosage dynamics in the course of the treatment 
Insulin Glargine 
At baseline mean ±SD insulin glargine dose was 17.0±8.2 IU (median= 15.5 IU) or 0.3 IU/kg. 
After 6 months of the therapy mean ±SD insulin glargine dose was 17.9±8.1 IU (median = 17 IU). 
At 12 months mean ±SD insulin glargine dose was 18.4±8.2 IU (median =18IU) or 0.4 IU/kg 
(p=0,80). Most of all patients used insulin glargine at bedtime. 
Insulin Glulisine 
At baseline mean ±SD insulin glulisine dose was 23.8 ± 10.3 IU (median= 22 IU) or 0. 5 IU/kg. 
After 6 months of the therapy mean ±SD insulin glulisine dose was 24.5 ± 11.4 IU, (median = 22 
IU). At 12 months mean ±SD insulin glulisine dose was 25.9±11.6 IU (median =24.0 IU) or 0.6 
IU/kg. Mean SD dose change from baseline was not statistically significant (p=0, 65) 
Insulin dosage calculated by body weight 
The average daily insulin glargine dosage calculated by body weight on visit 2 (baseline) was 0.349 
IU/kg. By visit 18 (end of study) it increased to 0.388 IU/kg. 
The average daily insulin glulisine dosage calculated by body weight on visit 2 (baseline) was 0.5 
IU/kg. By visit 18 (end of study) it further increased to 0.599 IU/kg. 
Insulin dosage calculated by body weight (IU/kg) 
The average total daily insulin dosage by body weight was 0.85 IU/kg at baseline. By Visit 18 (end 
of study) it increased to 0.94 IU/kg. 
Assessor’s Comments: 
The increases in rapid acting and basal insulin requirements are in-line with those seen during the 
6 month period of study HMR1964D-3001. 
Analysis of glycaemic profile 
Analysis of the weekly glycaemic profile 
The glycemic profile was analyzed with all the patients in the course of the conducted treatment. 
The self-monitoring of the glucose level was performed by all the patients of both age groups. The

glucose level before breakfast, before the main meal and 2 hours later after the main meal was 
assessed on each day of the therapy. 
Dynamics of the weekly glycaemic profile in the age group 6-12 years old group: 
Dynamics of the weekly glycaemia profile in the 13-17 years old group: 
Analysis of the plasma glucose profile by 3 points 
The glucose profile analysis was conducted at the same time. This analysis was carried out taking 
into account the following 3 points (before breakfast, before the main meal and 2 hours after the 
main meal). The variables were recorded during 3 different days of the week prior to each visit. 
The dynamics of the average daily plasma glucose level was also analysed with all the included 
patients.

Safety results 
Adverse events 
Summary of the adverse event profile 
Adverse events were reported with 53 (58.9%) patients, with a total of 182 adverse events.  
Three patients experienced 10 AE each; 22 (24.4%) of patients experienced 3 tо 9 AEs; 12 
(13.3%) patients experienced 2 AEs: and 16 patients (17.7%) experienced only 1 AE during the 
overall treatment period. 
The most frequently reported AEs in terms of System Organ Class (SOC) were systemic general 
state disturbances (85/182 events, 46.7%), followed by nervous system disorders (23/182 events, 
12.6%), then infections and invasions (18/182 events, 9.9%). 
The most frequently reported AEs in terms of Preferred Terms (PT) were flu-like symptoms (83/182 
cases, 45.6%), headache (16/182 cases, 8.8%), and acute rhinitis (10/182 cases, 5.5%). Acute 
pharyngitis and vomiting were each reported in 5/182 cases (2.7%). 
The majority of the cases were of mild and mild-to-moderate severity. 
Serious adverse events were reported with 5 patients (5.56%), with a total of 7 serious AEs. 
Hospitalization was necessary in 7/182 (3.84%) of reported adverse events. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Overall 7 serious adverse events were reported with 5 patients. There were no fatal cases reported 
Serious adverse events 
• 
• 
Patient 1- serious hypoglycaemia. The cause of hypoglycaemia was not mentioned by the 
investigator. 
Patient 2- diabetic ketoacidosis. The investigator didn’t associate the SAE with the 
investigational product. Same patient– 2 episodes of serious hypoglycaemia. In both cases 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/229285/2015

the investigator associated the SAE with the investigational product (insulin glargine). 
Patient continued to receive insulin glargine. 
• 
• 
• 
Patient 3 - chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopathy. The investigator didn’t 
associate the SAE with the investigational product.  
Patient 4 - epileptic seizure. Assessed by the investigator as related to insulin glargine and 
evaluated as life-threatening. The study drug was discontinued. 
Patient 5- serious hypoglycaemia. The investigator didn’t associate the SAE with the 
investigational product. 
Assessor’s Comments: 
The number of patients that reported a serious adverse event was low. Only one patient 
discontinued the study drug – in this case the patient had an epileptic seizure that was assessed as 
related to insulin glargine. 
No deaths were reported in the study. 
No new safety signals were identified. 
Analysis of hypoglycaemia events 
Overall 1866 events of hypoglycaemia were reported in 77/90 (85.6%) patients. The distribution of 
the hypoglycaemia events was analysed and three categories were reported: symptomatic, 
asymptomatic, and severe hypoglycaemia. Testing hypoglycaemia incidence difference by group 
was not planned in the safety analysis. 
The highest frequency of hypoglycaemia events was reported for symptomatic hypoglycaemia with 
1844 (98.8%) events versus 22 (1.2%) events of asymptomatic hypoglycaemia. 
In total, 1672 (90.7%) events of symptomatic hypoglycaemia were reported during daytime and 
172 (9.3%) at night time. All 22 events of asymptomatic hypoglycaemia occurred during daytime. 
A total of 53 (2.84%) events of severe hypoglycaemia were reported. 
Thirteen (14.4%) patients did not report any episode of hypoglycaemia during the study period. 
Overall 20.7 events per patient per year were reported during the study. Overall, 4 serious 
hypoglycaemia events were reported. In all these cases patients had to be hospitalized; in 3 out of 
4 cases the reason for serious hypoglycaemia according to the physician was intensive physical 
activity, and in one case the reason was not provided. 
In total hospitalisation was required in 5 (0.3%) of the hypoglycaemia episodes. 
Assessor’s Comments: 
The percentage and incidence of hypoglycaemic events is in-keeping with that seen previously. 
The number of severe hypoglycaemic events was low and within that seen previously.

Laboratory variables 
Laboratory variables assessment was conducted after 6 and 12 months since the beginning of 
therapy. Values were available for all 90 patients at baseline and 6 months, data was available for 
89 patients at 12 months. 
AST, ALT and creatinine 
There were no clinically significant changes in the mean variables of transaminase during the 
overall treatment period. The mean ± SD AST level did not change between baseline (16.8 ± 9.5 
IU/l) and end of study (16.8 ± 8.7 IU/l). The mean ± SD ALT levels did not change between 
baseline (13.1 ± 6.7 IU/l) and end of study (13.6 ± 7.7 IU/l). 
The mean ± SD serum creatinine levels during the treatment period slightly increased from 
59.5±16.8 mmol/l at baseline to 61.2±18.8 mmol/l at end of study, but this small change was not 
clinically significant. 
Blood pressure, body weight and waist-hip circumference 
Blood pressure, body weight and waist-hip circumference were measured at baseline, 6 and 12 
months. 
Blood pressure 
The mean ± SD systolic blood pressure at baseline was 105.97 ± 10.62 mmHg, and diastolic blood 
pressure was 63.26±6.35 mmHg. Blood pressure median was 110/60 mmHg. 
At study end (visit 18), the mean ± SD systolic blood pressure was 107.82 ± 9.67 mmHg, diastolic 
blood pressure was 63.66 ± 7.16 mmHg. Blood pressure median was 110/60 mmHg. 
Body weight 
The mean ± SD weight of the patients in the overall population was 48.88 ± 16.59 kg on Visit 1. 
On the final visit (visit 18) the mean ± SD weight increased to 52.43±15.97 kg. No significant 
weight increase in the course of the therapy was detected by the ANOVA statistical test. 
Waist-hip circumference 
Waist circumference, measured on all patients, was 68.0 ± 10.8 cm (median, 67.0 cm) at baseline 
and increased to 69.9 ± 11.0 cm (median, 69.0 cm) at the end of study. Waist-hip circumferences 
ratio (WHR) was 0.80 ± 0.064 at baseline, and did not change (0.81±0.09) at end of study.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspect 
This was an open-label, stand-alone study with no comparator arm in inadequately controlled 
children and adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes. Originally it was planned to enrol 210 subjects in 
the study. However, during the study it became apparent that insulin glulisine was not included in 
the Federal reimbursement list. Therefore, a decision was made to limit the number of patients up 
to 100 to avoid subjects having to switch to another insulin after the study end and focus on 
enrolment only in regions where patients were capable to receive insulin glulisine after the study 
end.  
There are a number of limitations to this study, including the open-label non-comparator design, 
the number of patients enrolled and the lack of details on the reasons for subjects having poor 
glycaemic control prior to inclusion in the study – for example whether this was due to previous 
poor compliance. 
However, notwithstanding above, the improvements seen in Hba1c levels seen in children aged 6-
12 years and 13-17 years are generally in-keeping with those seen in the previous pivotal clinical 
trial in children and adolescents. 
There were no deaths during the study. The number of serious adverse events and serious 
hypoglycaemic events was low. The percentage and event rate for hypoglycaemia is within that 
seen previously. No new safety signals were identified in this trial.

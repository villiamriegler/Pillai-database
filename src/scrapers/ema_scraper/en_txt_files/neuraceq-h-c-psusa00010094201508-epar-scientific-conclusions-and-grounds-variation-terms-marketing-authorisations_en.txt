Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for florbetaben (18f), the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
During this PSUR procedure the ADRs “injection site erythema” and “application site erythema” were 
merged and their frequencies were modified from ‘uncommon’ to ‘common’ in section 4.8 of the summary 
of product characteristics. This change was also reflected in the package leaflet.  
In addition the overall safety profile of Neuraceq was updated as it is now based on data from 1090 
administrations of Neuraceq, an increase from 978 previously used. This modification was accepted by 
the PRAC. 
Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR, the PRAC considered that the changes to 
the product information of Neuraceq (18F-florbetaben) were warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for 18F-florbetaben the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing 18F-florbetaben is unchanged subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

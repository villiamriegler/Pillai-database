2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The initially applied indication for Locametz was, after radiolabelling with gallium-68, as a radioactive 
diagnostic agent for the identification of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive lesions 
by positron emission tomography (PET) in adult patients with prostate cancer. 
The finally approved indication for Locametz, after radiolabelling with gallium-68, is for the detection of 
prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive lesions with positron emission tomography (PET) 
in adults with prostate cancer (PCa) in the following clinical settings: 
• Primary staging of patients with high-risk PCa prior to primary curative therapy, 
• Suspected PCa recurrence in patients with increasing levels of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 
after primary curative therapy, 
• Identification of patients with PSMA-positive progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate 
cancer (mCRPC) for whom PSMA-targeted therapy is indicated. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death among men in the US 
(Siegel et al 2020) and the third leading cause of cancer-related death in Europe (Malvezzi et al 2019). 
In addition to the mortality burden, prostate cancer results in a significant negative impact on quality 
of life (Diels et al 2015, Lloyd et al 2015). In the USA, approximately 191,930 new cases of PC and 
33,330 deaths were estimated for 2020 (American Cancer Society 2020), and in Europe, the 
corresponding estimates were 473,344 new cases and 108,088 deaths (International Agency for 
Research on Cancer 2020). 
EMA/871509/2022 
Page 9/116 
 
 
 
  
 
 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Prostate-specific membrane antigen is a type II transmembrane protein, also known as folate 
hydrolase I or glutamate carboxypeptidase II, and is a biological target for diagnostic imaging and 
therapy in PCa (Silver et al 1997, O’Keefe et al 2018). PSMA is highly expressed in nearly all prostate 
cancers, including adenocarcinoma, but has restricted and several hundred-fold lower expression in 
some normal tissues such as the duodenal mucosa, renal proximal tubules, and salivary glands 
(Bostwick et al 1998, Sokoloff et al 2000, Chang 2004, Ghosh and Heston 2004). The differential 
expression of PSMA from tumour to non-tumour tissue allows for targeted localization of PCa and its 
metastases by means of 68Ga-PSMA-11. Expression of PSMA is also an independent predictor of poor 
prognosis (Chang 2004, Hupe et al 2018) with significantly shorter survival and a higher risk of disease 
recurrence reported in patients with high levels of PSMA expression (Ross et al 2003, Cimadamore et 
al 2018, Hupe et al 2018, Nagaya et al 2020).  
The binding of a high affinity ligand to PSMA leads to internalization through endocytosis, and a 
sustained retention of the ligand and its bound radioactive cargo within the cancer cell (Rajasekaran et 
al 2003, Benešová et al 2015). This functional feature of PSMA in addition to its expression pattern 
allows for the development of low-molecular weight targeted radiopharmaceuticals with favourable 
pharmacokinetic and tumour penetration properties (Haberkorn et al 2016). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The clinical picture of PCa is variable and may range between asymptomatic, microscopic, well-
differentiated tumour that may never become clinically significant to the rarer screen detected, or 
clinically symptomatic aggressive, high-grade cancer that causes metastases, morbidity, and death. 
Diagnostic work-up of PCa is complex. Diagnostic tools include PSA testing, digital rectal palpation, 
transrectal ultrasound (TRUS), prostate biopsy, and histopathologic examination (Schwarzenböck et al 
2012, Smith et al 2016, Prasad et al 2016). Additionally, further imaging techniques such as, magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI), bone scintigraphy, computer tomography (CT), and positron emission 
tomography (PET)/CT with [18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose, [18F]Choline, [11C]Choline and the more 
recently approved [18F]fluciclovine are used (Schwarzenböck et al 2012; Nanni et al 2016, Odewole et 
al 2016).  
Two main pivotal time-points in terms of decision-making on treatment strategy are primary staging of 
PCa, that takes place in the patients with confirmed PCa, before the first definitive therapy is started, 
and confirmation of PCa recurrence and staging in the patients who developed increased PSA after 
curative treatment of PCa (i.e., patients with so called biochemical recurrence – BCR). In both cases, 
gained information can direct clinical decision-making and may have impact on subsequent treatment 
strategy and clinical outcomes, such as patients’ survival.  
The joint guideline on diagnosis and management of prostate cancer from European Association of 
Urology (EAU), European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM), European Society for Therapeutic 
Radiology and Oncology (ESTRO), European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) and International 
Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG) (Mottet et al., 2020) and the latest guideline from ESMO (Parker 
et al., 2020) recommend that for primary staging the patients with intermediate-risk disease are 
staged for metastases using MRI or CT (abdomen and pelvis) and bone scan and those with high-risk 
disease using CT (chest, abdomen and pelvis) and bone scan. Mottet et al., state that in the primary 
staging “PSMA PET/CT is more accurate for staging than CT and bone scan for high-risk disease but to 
date no outcome data exist to inform subsequent management” (level of evidence: 1b) and that 
“When using PSMA PET or whole body MRI to increase sensitivity, be aware of the lack of outcome data 
EMA/871509/2022 
Page 10/116 
 
 
 
  
 
of subsequent treatment changes.” (strength rating: strong). In this setting ESMO recommends not to 
base clinical decision-making on the outcomes of 68Ga-PSMA PET, as impact of this diagnostic tool on 
clinical outcomes has not been evaluated (Parker et al., 2020).  
In the BCR population 68Ga-PSMA PET is recommended in the patients after radical prostatectomy only 
if the results may influence subsequent therapy (strength rating: “weak”) and in the patients after 
radiotherapy if they are fit for curative salvage treatment (strength rating: “strong”). Also, choline 
PET/CT, fluciclovine PET/CT, multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) are being recommended depending on the 
specific patient population (Mottet et al.). 
Overall, the experts acknowledge, that CT and MRI display poor sensitivity in diagnostics of 
PCa/Staging and that choline, fluciclovine and PSMA PET display better sensitivity. 
In relation to use of 68Ga-PSMA PET for selection of patients for PSMA-targeted therapy, evidence is 
limited to the studies investigating 177Lu-PSMA-617 treatment in the “PSMA-positive” population with 
metastasised castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), selected for treatment by means of 68Ga-
PSMA PET (Note: the studies include the VISION study conducted by the Applicant). This is reflected in 
the Joint Guideline on PCa (Mottet et al., 2022), that recommends that 177Lu-PSMA-617 is offered to 
“pre-treated patients with mCRPC with one or more metastatic lesions, highly expressing PSMA 
(exceeding the uptake in the liver) on the diagnostic radiolabelled PSMA PET/CT scan”. (strength 
rating: strong). 
2.1.5.  Management 
Depending on the stage (primary localised/locally advanced, recurrent PCa, metastatic/non-metastatic, 
etc.), patient’s age (estimated life-expectancy), condition of a patient, risk profile (low-, intermediate-, 
high-risk PCa), etc., watchful waiting, active surveillance, or different treatment strategies (e.g., 
focal/systemic, definitive/palliative, surgical/non-surgical) can be utilized. Typically, in patients with 
primary high-risk PCa radical prostatectomy with or without lymph node dissection or radiation therapy 
are utilised with curative intent. However, immediate systemic treatment with androgen deprivation 
therapy (ADT) to palliate symptoms and reduce the risk for potentially serious sequelae of advanced 
disease (spinal cord compression, pathological fractures, ureteral obstruction) is recommended if 
presence of metastatic disease (M1) has been confirmed and a patient is symptomatic. ADT as part of 
the adjuvant therapy is also recommended after radical prostatectomy in the patients with cancer-
positive lymph nodes (LN1). In the patients with suspected recurrence of PCa focal or systemic therapy 
options exist, including salvage radiation therapy, brachytherapy, etc., depending on the staging, type, 
prior treatment received, patient’s condition, etc. (Mottet et al., 2022). Correct decision-making is 
heavily dependent on the accuracy of the diagnostic methodology used.  
The current standard of care in metastatic prostate cancer (mPC) is based on chemotherapy, androgen 
deprivation by different mechanisms of action on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, and 
adrenal-androgen receptor signaling. Standard ADT and NAADs (i.e. abiraterone acetate or 
enzalutamide) can stabilize metastatic castration-sensitive PCs (mCSPC) for many years. However, 
most patients eventually progress to mCRPC, which remains challenging to treat. One of the options 
available for the patients with mCRPC is 177Lu-PSMA-617 therapy. This PSMA-targeted radio-ligand 
therapy utilizes a radiolabeled small-molecule ligand that binds with high affinity to PSMA, resulting in 
internalization and retention within the targeted prostate cancer cell (Ghosh and Heston 2004, 
Benešová et al 2015), delivering therapeutic radiation dose to cancer cells via PSMA while minimizing 
radiation-related side effects in the patients with PSMA-positive mCRPC. Identification of patients with 
PSMA-positive mCRPC prior to start of such therapy is a clinically relevant objective for 68Ga-labelled 
PSMA-based PET. Notably, 177Lu-PSMA-617 treatment has been approved in the US since 2021 and is

2.2.  About the product 
Gozetotide (PSMA-11) is constructed using a urea-based targeting ligand and the gallium chelating 
moiety HBED CC (Eder et al 2012, Eder et al 2014). The radioisotope gallium-68 (68Ga) utilized with 
PSMA-11 is a β+ emitting radionuclide with a 68-minute physical half-life, and a high emission yield, 
that makes it a suitable PET imaging agent (Fendler et al 2017b). 68Ga-labelled gozetotide ([68Ga]Ga-
PSMA-11) after intravenous administration specifically binds to prostate specific membrane antigen 
(PSMA), allowing identification of PSMA-expressing tissues with PET, including PCa. The differential 
expression of PSMA from tumour to non-tumour tissue allows for targeted localization of PCa and its 
metastases by means of 68Ga-PSMA-11. 
[68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 was developed at the German Cancer Research Center (Deutsches 
Krebsforschungszentrum) and University Hospital Heidelberg for the purpose of diagnostic imaging in 
patients with prostate cancer and has been under formal clinical development by Endocyte, and, 
subsequently, Advanced Accelerator Applications (AAA)/Novartis, since 2017. 
The proposed commercial formulation of PSMA-11 (gozetotide; Tradename: Locametz) is a one-vial 
multi-dose kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation which must be reconstituted and radiolabeled with a 
sterile solution of 68Ga in HCl coming from a cGMP-grade 68Ge/68Ga generator to obtain [68Ga]Ga-
PSMA-11 radiolabeled solution for injection. The obtained 68Ga-PSMA-11 radiolabeled solution is 
complying with the frame given by the Ph. Eur. Monograph (3044) for “Gallium (68Ga) PSMA-11 
Injection”. The PSMA-11 kit is intended for use in a radiopharmacy after radiolabeling with gallium-68. 
This medicinal product should only be administered by trained healthcare professionals with technical 
expertise in using and handling nuclear medicine imaging agents and only in a designated nuclear 
medicine facility. 
Posology: The recommended dose of gallium (68Ga) gozetotide is 1.8-2.2 MBq/kg of body weight, with 
a minimum dose of 111 MBq up to a maximum dose of 259 MBq. 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals, other diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals 
for tumour detection, ATC code: V09IX14. 
In this document, the radiolabeled compound gallium (68Ga) gozetotide or [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 
(company research code: AAA517) may be referred to as 68Ga-PSMA-11, and the therapeutic agent 
lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan (AAA617 / [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617) is referred to as 177Lu-PSMA-
617. 
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
A scientific advice from the EU Scientific Advice Working Party was received on 10-Apr-2019 on non-
clinical and clinical development package. 
At the time of the scientific advice development of the product as a specific diagnostic tool for selection 
of patients for treatment with 177Lu-PSMA-617 (MAA submitted as EMEA/H/C/5483) was intended, that 
was under development for the indication ‘metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer post NAAD 
and post taxane-containing chemotherapy’. Both investigational products 68Ga-PSMA-11 and 177Lu-
PSMA-617 were to be tested in the same clinical study, that has now been submitted under the name 
of VISION (PSMA-617-01) study. The CHMP stated that within the context of the narrow indication 
(use of 68Ga-PSMA-11 for patient selection of 177LU-PSMA-617 treatment) “in conjunction with a 
positive benefit/risk of the therapeutic product 177Lu-PSMA-617 in the population selected by use of 
EMA/871509/2022 
Page 12/116 
 
 
 
  
 
68Ga-PSMA-11 as determined in the VISION trial, convincing technical performance (see “Reader 
agreement” below)” needed to be demonstrated.” No dedicated large clinical studies were requested 
considering the envisaged restricted use of gozetotide. 
The currently claimed indication covers prostate cancer (PCa) diagnostics in various clinical situations: 
primary staging, diagnosis of cancer after biochemical recurrence (BCR) and selection of the PSMA-
positive patients for PSMA-targeted therapy. Thus, the requirements outlined in the CHMP advice only 
partly apply and the recommendations of relevant guidelines on diagnostic products 
(CHMP/EWP/1119/98 REV1 and CHMP/EWP/321180/2008) are to be followed. 
The Applicant has conducted one international, prospective, open-label, multicenter, randomized Phase 
III study (study PSMA-617-01 - VISION) to evaluate efficacy of 177Lu-PSMA-617 in the treatment of 
patients with progressive PSMA-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), in 
which 68Ga-PSMA-11 was used for patient selection. Additionally, a reviewer variability study was 
conducted using the 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET images from VISION study and dosimetry calculations based 
on the raw data collected by Sandgren et al. (2019) have been performed. The remaining evidence to 
substantiate this submission is provided from published literature.  
Some requirements for the relevant guidance have not been addressed. Specifically, impact on clinical 
outcomes remains unknown. However, this limitation has been mentioned in the product information. 
Notably, the final to-be-marketed product under the MAA has not been tested in humans and no 
dedicated bridging study has been conducted, based on the rationale that no bioequivalence studies 
are required for water-soluble i.v. formulations containing the same active substance in accordance 
with the EMA guideline on bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr).  
The proposed pH specification is lower than foreseen by the Pharmacopeia monograph “Gallium (68Ga) 
PSMA-11 Injection” (Eur. Ph. 3044) and more, or different type of injection site reactions (e.g., 
injection site pain) than currently documented are expected. The Applicant refers to another diagnostic 
product with similarly low pH (pH 3.2 – 3.8) SomaKit TOC (by Advanced Accelerator Applications; 
EMEA/H/C/004140; approved in 2016), that has been approved and is in use with a single adverse 
drug reaction (ADR) - “injection site pain” - reported thus far. Osmolality of 68Ga-Locametz may not be 
similar to the products applied in the published studies. However, this is estimated to be roughly within 
the range of 600-800 mOsm/kg, which is below the threshold of tolerability of 1000 mOsm/kg 
acknowledged for i.v. small volume (≤100 mL) injections (Wang et al., 
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2015.05.069). Thus, the bridging to the products used in the 
published studies is considered established, with some remaining uncertainty regarding the frequency 
of injection site reactions. 
2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation containing 25 micrograms 
of gozetotide (PSMA-11).  
The kit has to be radiolabelled and prepared to an injection in combination with a solution of 
[68Ga]Gallium in diluted hydrochloric acid provided by a 68Ge/68Ga radionuclide generator to obtain 
[68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 solution for injection (so called [68Ga]gallium-PSMA-11 solution for injection), being

the radiolabelled imaging product, which can be directly injected to the patient. The radionuclide is not 
part of the kit. 
Other ingredients of the kit are: gentisic acid, sodium acetate trihydrate, and sodium chloride. 
The product is available in 10 mL type I Plus glass vial closed with a rubber stopper and sealed with a 
flip-off cap as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.4.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Gozetotide (PSMA-11) is a synthetic ligand that contains 2 ureido-linked amino acids (Glu and Lys), the 
linker Ahx is bound to the side chain amino acid group of the Lys residue and the chelator HBED-CC. 
Gozetotide (PSMA-11) is isolated as non – stoichiometric Gozetotide (PSMA-11) – trifluoro acetate 
compound. 
Gozetotide (PSMA-11) is a cold chemical precursor dedicated to be radiolabelled with the radionuclide 
“gallium-68” to form the clinical relevant active substance [68Ga]Gallium-gozetotide used for diagnostic 
radiopharmaceutical for Positron Emission Tomography (PET). 
In a kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation the cold non-radiolabelled active substance is per 
definition the active substance to be declared for the kit.  
The chemical name of gozetotide is (2S)-2-[[(1S)-1-carboxy-5-[6-[3-[3-[[2-[[5-(2-carboxyethyl)-2-
hydroxyphenyl]methyl-(carboxymethyl)amino]ethyl-(carboxymethyl)amino]methyl]-4-
hydroxyphenyl]propanoylamino]hexanoylamino]pentyl]carbamoylamino]pentanedioic acid 
corresponding to the molecular formula C44H62N6O17. It has a relative molecular mass of 947 g/mol and 
the following structure:

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Gozetotide (PSMA-11) is manufactured by one manufacturer. 
Detailed information on the manufacturing has been provided in the restricted part of the ASMF and it 
was considered satisfactory. 
Gozetotide is synthesized in 5 main steps: synthesis of PSMA building block, solid phase peptide 
synthesis including HBED-CC -ligand coupling, cleavage from solid support, deprotection and isolation 
of crude peptide, chromatographic purification and filtration and final lyophilization using well defined 
starting materials with acceptable specifications.  
During the whole manufacturing process, the formation and purge of product related impurities such as 
by-products  of  the  synthesis,  unreacted  starting  materials,  or  degradation  products  is  monitored  by 
analytical RP-HPLC and MS in the course of several in-process control 
(IPC) steps. RP-HPLC as well as MS are adequate analytical methods to detect product related impurities.  
Limits for the Class II solvents acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, and dichloromethane are defined 
according to the respective Ph. Eur. general monograph for chemical precursors for 
radiopharmaceutical preparations 2902 (class 2 solvents ≤ 0.5 %) 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised.  
Specification 
Gozetotide (PSMA-11) specification includes tests for appearance (visual), identification (IR, MS), 
assay (peptide content, net peptide content), impurities (RP-HPLC, GC-MS), residual organic solvents 
(GC), counter ion content TFA (IC or GC), water content (GC), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), 
microbial contamination/bioburden (Ph. Eur.). 
EMA/871509/2022 
Page 15/116 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
During the assessment the CHMP requested as Major Objection (MO) that the impurity specifications of 
the active substance gozetotide should be justified or should otherwise reduce the specification limits 
for impurities. The impurity specifications were justified by the applicant and this was considered 
satisfactory. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data (3 commercial scale batches) of the active substance are provided. The results are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 5 batches of gozetotide (PSMA-11) from the manufacturer stored in the intended 
commercial package for up to 36 months (1 batch) and 24 months (4 batches) under long term 
conditions (-20 ± 5°C) and for up to 24 months under accelerated conditions (+5 ± 3°C), according to 
the ICH guidelines were provided.  
The following parameters were tested: appearance, identity, mass spectrometry, counter ion content 
TFA, water content, net peptide content, peptide related substances/impurities, bacterial endotoxins 
and microbial contamination/bioburden. 
No significant changes in the quality of the chemical precursor are detected under long-term and 
accelerated conditions. 
A temperature excursion study in one batch is performed to evaluate the identified critical stability 
parameters of the active substance under ICH storage conditions of +25 ± 2°C and 60± 5% RH). The 
appearance, identity and purity of the peptide, as well as the water content are monitored. Results 
indicate that under storage conditions of +25 °C ± 2°C over a period of 30 days no significant changes 
occur in the quality of the active substance.  
According to the ICH guideline Q1B, a photostability study is performed in one batch. Based on the 
results of the study the active substance is photolabile and is to be stored protected from light. 
To determine the stability under various stressing conditions (stability in acidic, basic, oxidative, and 
oxidative-basic solutions), an accelerated aging study is performed in one batch. Results show that it 
remains within specification at acidic conditions for at least 48 hours. The product is unstable under 
basic, oxidative and oxidative basic conditions.  
The stability results indicate that gozetotide (PSMA-11) manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months stored at -20°C 
± 5°C and protected from light in the proposed container.

2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a sterile white lyophilised powder presented as a kit for radiopharmaceutical 
preparation. 
The physico-chemical properties of PSMA-11 have been considered when choosing the manufacturing 
process for the powder vial in order to achieve the intended dosage form. Being the solubility of the 
PSMA-11 with water determined by the active substance manufacturer and being the active substance 
intended to be directly dissolved in aqueous solution and at much lower concentration than those 
investigated by the active substance manufacturer, no additional physico-chemical characterization of 
the active substance was performed for the purpose of the finished product development. 
The compatibility of the active substance with the excipients used in the finished product has 
been demonstrated through the development studies during the selection of suitable excipients for this 
dosage form, and has been confirmed later by batch analyses and the stability data. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards except gentisic acid which complies with “In House” specifications. There are no novel 
excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of 
the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The proposed commercial finished product was developed as a sterile lyophilized powder formulation 
provided in a 1-vial kit. The finished product was developed as a multidose product to be used in 
combination with a solution of gallium-68 in diluted hydrochloric acid provided by a 68Ge/68Ga 
radionuclide generator to obtain 68Ga-PSMA-11 solution for injection, being the kit prepared 
radiolabelled imaging product for intravenous administration. 
The compatibility of the kit was tested using two commercially available 68Ge/68Ga radionuclide 
generators. Both generators are currently approved radionuclide generators in the EU/EEA.  
The powder for solution for injection has proved to be compatible for reconstitution and radiolabelling 
with Gallium [68Ga] in diluted hydrochloric acid solutions, and is therefore kept constant, irrespectively 
which of both as suitable proven radionuclide of the generator is used. 
Both in the SmPC described radionuclide generators are pharmaceutical grade generators with own 
marketing authorisations in the EU/EEA providing the eluate compliant 
with the current Ph. Eur. Monograph (2464) for “Gallium Chloride (68Ga) Solution for Radiolabelling”. 
In the case that in the future additional 68Ge/68Ga radionuclide generators possessing their own 
marketing authorisation are available the suitability of Gallium Chloride (68Ga) Solution for 
Radiolabelling deriving from these new radionuclide generators with the kit Locametz should be 
demonstrated before these new radionuclide generators are added to the SmPC of Locametz by a 
variation procedure.  
The formulation development has been performed with the aim of identifying the reaction mixture 
composition able to allow a simple radiolabelling of PSMA-11 with Gallium-68 by metal - complexation  
with the eluate from commercially available 68Ge/68Ga generators without any processing of the eluate 
or any additional purification step. 
The development work includes the relevant studies performed for the selection of the active 
ingredient amount and appropriate excipients and their suitable quantities. The applicant used as 
reference when selecting the active substance amount, the draft Ph. Eur. Monograph (3044) for 
“Gallium (68Ga) PSMA-11 Injection” which prescribes for the active ingredient PSMA-11 an amount of 
not more than 30 μg. 
EMA/871509/2022 
Page 17/116 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Following the Ph. Eur. recommendation, preliminary tests were conducted using different quantities s 
of PSMA 11 without exceeding 30 μg as recommended by Ph. Eur. in order to confirm what is the 
suitable active substance quantity sufficient to obtain 68Ga-PSMA-11 solution with high radiochemical 
purity in consistent way. 25 μg was selected as final PSMA-11 amount to ensure a margin 
around the target value still falling within the range of proven radiolabelling efficiency, without 
exceeding the limit prescribed by the reference Ph. Eur. Monograph. 
During the very early development stages, the radiolabelling procedure parameters regarding 
the reaction time and temperature  were defined based on 
well-known conditions described in literature. 
The testing results demonstrated the radiolabelling procedure is robust and the radiolabelled 
imaging product is stable providing results fully compliant with the proposed quality 
specification. 
Because of the short shelf – life of Ga-68 radiolabelled products of only few hours Ga-68 
radiopharmaceuticals are typically radiolabelled at the nuclear medicine department. With the 
68Ge/68Ga radionuclide generators a 24 hours / 7 days source of the radionuclide precursor Ga-68 
chloride solution for radiolabelling is available in the nuclear medicine departments. The most 
convenient way for the user to obtain a Ga-68 radiolabelled medicinal product is a “one pot” and “one 
step” reaction where the Ga-68 chloride solution for radiolabelling is added to a vial containing all 
components to obtain directly without additional manufacturing steps a ready to use solution for 
injection in a quality in compliance with the corresponding pharmacopeia monograph without further 
purification steps. 
Therefore, a manufacturing process was developed leading to a lyophilizate powder containing the cold 
chemical precursor PSMA-11 together with suitable excipients filled as sterile product in a vial which 
forms after addition of the Ga-68 chloride solution for radiolabelling the ready to use solution for 
injection. 
The necessary manufacturing process of the lyophilizate involves the preparation of an aqueous bulk 
solution containing the cold precursor PSMA-11 and the excipients which is sterilised by filtration, 
dispensed in single sterile product vials where the solution is lyophilised under sterile conditions. This 
manufacturing process is not specific for radiopharmaceuticals and common methods of 
pharmaceutical technology are used. 
It was developed a container closure system which can not only protect the lyophilizate during the 
shelf-life period but tolerate the radiolabelling reaction of PSMA-11 with Ga-68 chloride solution too. 
The primary packaging is type I Plus glass vial closed with a rubber stopper and sealed with a flip-off 
cap. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure 
system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured by one manufacturing site. 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  6  main  steps:  solution  compounding,  sterile  filtration,  aseptic 
filling and partially stoppering of vials, lyophilization, sealing of vials, and visual inspection, labelling and 
packaging. The process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process (sterile filtration, filter integrity, bacterial viability, bacterial 
retention, aseptic filling, lyophilisation, sealing of the vials, sterilization of container closure system and 
holding times) have been validated using three full-scale production batches which have been processed 
in the same manufacturing facilities, using the same process and the same equipment as for the batches 
intended for commercial supply. All three batches fully met the quality control specifications. With the 
in-process data and the additional testing it has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is 
EMA/871509/2022 
Page 18/116 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
robust and consistently yields product capable of meeting the pre-defined quality characteristics. The in-
process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process.  
Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form:  appearance  of  the  lyophilisate  (visual),  container  closure  integrity  (visual),  reconstitution  time 
(visual), appearance of the reconstitution solution (visual), sub-visible particles (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of 
dosage units (mass variation) (Ph. Eur.), residual moisture (water content) (KF), pH (pH meter), PSMA-
11  assay  (HPLC),  PMSA-11  identification  (HPLC-UV-DAD),  gentisic  acid  assay  (HPLC),  gentisic  acid 
identification (HPLC), related substance (HPLC), sterility (Ph. Eur.), and bacterial endotoxins (HPLC). 
For radiolabelled product: appearance of 68Ga-PSMA-11 solution (visual), pH of 68Ga-PSMA-11 solution 
(pH meter), radiochemical purity 68Ga-PSMA-11 (sum of two isomers) (HPLC), radiochemical purity: free 
68Ga (HPLC), and radiochemical purity: 68Ga non-complexed specie (TLC).  
There are no specified identified or specified unidentified degradation products based on forced 
degradation studies performed on the finished product. Any unspecified degradation product detected 
in the finished product is controlled with limit of not more than 1.0% as per ICH Q3B (R2) guideline. As 
described in the Ph. Eur. Monograph for Gallium (68Ga) PSMA-11 injection (3044), the radiochemical 
impurities are assessed into radiolabelled finished product. 
According to the guideline for elemental impurities (ICH Q3D) elemental impurities may arise from 
several sources. Elemental impurities can be excluded as no metal catalysts are used. Results from 
validation batches showed that all elemental metals potentially present are far below the allowed limits 
of 100 ppm/metal impurity. Summarizing all data and information for metals it is concluded that no 
significant amount of heavy metals is present. Therefore, it is not considered necessary to test for 
heavy metals on a regular basis. 
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product 
has been performed (as requested) considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the 
“Questions and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the 
Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal 
products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation 
EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based 
on the information provided, it is accepted that there is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the active 
substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no specific control measures are deemed 
necessary 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for  testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 3 commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
EMA/871509/2022 
Page 19/116 
 
 
 
  
 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of finished product stored for up to 12 months under long 
term conditions (25°C / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40°C / 75% RH) 
according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The  batches  of  the  medicinal  product  are  identical  to 
those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Stability data was also provided from 3 commercial batches stored for up 12 months under refrigerated 
conditions at 5 ± 3°C to evaluate if temperatures lower than normal storage temperature could cause 
changes in chemical/radiochemical or physical aspects for radiopharmaceutical preparation and at 30 ± 
2°C / 75% RH ± 5% RH to prove that the finished product is stable throughout its shelf-life storing at 
30 ± 2°C. 
Samples were tested for appearance of the lyophilisate, container closure integrity, reconstitution time, 
appearance  of  the  reconstitution  solution,  sub-visible  particles,  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (mass 
variation), residual moisture (water content), pH, PSMA-11 assay, PMSA-11 identification, gentisic acid 
assay, gentisic acid identification, related substance, sterility, and bacterial endotoxins. 
For  radiolabelled  product, samples  were tested  for  appearance  of  68Ga-PSMA-11  solution,  pH  of  68Ga-
PSMA-11 solution, radiochemical purity 68Ga-PSMA-11 (sum of two isomers), radiochemical purity,  free 
Ga-68, and radiochemical purity, andGa-68 non-complexed specie.  
The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
All chemical and physical data generated under aforementioned stability conditions meet specifications 
and therefore, the data demonstrate good stability profile for the finished product. 
In-use stability of the radiolabelled finished product was assessed during a study conducted on the three 
batches at room temperature up to 6 hours. Full physical and chemical product testing was conducted, 
initially and after 6 hours. The same validated and stability-indicating methods routinely employed during 
the long-term stability studies were used. No significant changes were observed in any of the physical 
and  chemical  parameters  and  all  remained  within  specification,  thus  demonstrating  6  hours  in-use 
stability of the radiolabelled imaging product. 
A multipiercing in-use stability study was performed on three validation batches at room temperature 
up  to  6  hours  in  order  to  support  the  suitability  of  the  finished  product  kit  for  radiopharmaceutical 
preparation for being a multidose product. No significant changes were observed in any of the physical, 
chemical  and  microbiological  parameters  tested.  All  tested  parameters  remained  within  specification, 
thus demonstrating the suitability of the kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation, for being a multidose 
product.  
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New  Drug  Substances  and  Products.  All  results  complied  with  the  specifications.  The  results  of 
photostability study demonstrated that light exposure does not result in unacceptable change in chemical 
and physical characteristics. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 1 year (unopened) stored bellow 25°C as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
After reconstitution and radiolabelling, chemical and physical in-use stability have been demonstrated 
for 6 hours at 30°C. Store upright. 
From a microbiological point of view, unless the method of opening, reconstitution, radiolabelling, or 
dilution precludes the risk of microbial contamination, the product should be used immediately.

Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
One MO had been raised about that the impurity specifications of the active substance gozetotide 
should be justified or should otherwise reduce the specification limits of impurities. The impurity 
specifications were justified by the applicant, and this was considered satisfactory. Overall, during the 
procedure the information of the dossier has been updated and improved as requested. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.4.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
PSMA is a type II transmembrane protein, also known as folate hydrolase or glutamate 
carboxypeptidase II or N-Acetyl-L-aspartyl-L-glutamate peptidase (NAALADase), and has been 
confirmed as a biological target for diagnostic imaging in prostate cancer. 
The non-clinical program has been designed according to CHMP Guideline on the nonclinical 
requirements for radiopharmaceuticals (EMA/CHMP/SWP/686140/2018). 
Pivotal toxicology and safety pharmacology studies as well as validation of bioanalytical methods were 
performed in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) in test facilities that were part of an EU 
or an OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) Mutual Acceptance of Data 
(MAD) GLP monitoring programme. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Based on the submitted literature, the mechanism of action of the radiodiagnostic agent 68Ga-PSMA-11 
is two-fold. On the one hand, its PSMA-11 core binds to PSMA with high affinity leading to 
internalisation through endocytosis and a sustained retention of 68Ga-PSMA-11 within the targeted

prostate cells was found to be in a low nanomolar range (Ki = 12.0±2.8 nM). On the other hand, the 
positron emission from Ga-68 allows for PET imaging. PSMA-positive PC-3 PIP human prostate cancer 
cells took up approximately 55-70% 68Ga-PSMA-11, and approximately 10% to 15% of the total added 
radioactivity was internalised. The uptake of 68Ga-PSMA-11 into PSMA-negative PC-3 flu human 
prostate cancer cells was lower than 0.5% showing PSMA-specific uptake and internalisation. Similar 
results were obtained in vivo in a mouse model. Uptake of 68Ga-PSMA-11 in PSMA-positive PC-3 PIP 
tumours was high, whereas the uptake in PSMA-negative PC-3 flu tumours was not visible in the 
PET/CT scan of the animals. Most normal tissues did not accumulate radioactivity, except for kidneys, 
where 68Ga-PSMA-11 was clearly retained at 2 h post-dose. 
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
At the concentration of 10 μM, PSMA-11 was found not to interact with a panel of 87 potential different 
targets (receptors, ion channels, enzymes and transporters). This concentration is 1000-fold higher 
than the theoretical clinical Cmax of PSMA-11 in patients after a single administration of microdose of 25 
μg (Study FR095-0019091). PSMA-11 did not affect cell viability of PSMA-positive (22RV1, prostate 
cancer) or PSMA-negative (KB, cervical papilloma) human cancer cell lines at the concentrations up to 
10 μM suggesting no direct pharmacological activity of the PSMA-moiety itself (Study 0587). 
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
PSMA-11 at the concentrations of 1, 10 and 100 μM inhibited hERG tail current by 8±4%, 15±4%, and 
17±5%, respectively as assessed in stably transfected HEK-293 cells utilising a patch-clamp technique. 
Given the theoretical clinical Cmax of 10 nM (the highest assay concentration is 10000-fold higher), no 
clinically relevant hERG blockade is expected.  
In vivo GLP safety pharmacology studies were performed in rats and minipigs. As has been shown by 
Rovenska et al. (2008), PSMA target is expressed in rats, minipigs and humans, is highly conserved 
and has similar enzymatic activity in these species. Therefore, rats and minipigs are considered 
pharmacologically relevant species. PSMA-11 had no effect on general behaviour parameters (Irwin 
test) in male Sprague-Dawley rats after single intravenous administration at doses of 0, 0.08, 0.25 and 
0.75 mg/kg (N = 5 for each group). Intravenous PSMA-11 did not influence respiratory function of the 
conscious male Sprague-Dawley rats at doses of 0, 0.08, 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg (N = 8 per group). No 
effects on cardiovascular system were observed in conscious telemetered minipigs at doses of 0, 0.03, 
0.09 and 0.29 mg/kg (N = 2, 4, 6, 8, respectively). 
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were conducted, as gallium gozetotide is highly specific 
and selective for PSMA and PSMA shows overexpression in prostate cancer (see discussion on non-
clinical aspects). 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
• Methods of analysis 
The analytical methods for quantification of PSMA-11 in vehicle by LC-UV, in Tyrode’s solution by 
HPLC-UV and in rat plasma by LC-MS/MS were developed and validated under GLP conditions. 
EMA/871509/2022 
Page 22/116 
 
 
 
  
 
• Absorption 
The classical pharmacokinetics of PSMA-11 was investigated in a toxicokinetic study as a part of the 
GLP extended single dose toxicity study in rats. 
• Distribution 
The in vitro plasma protein binding of PSMA-11 to plasma of various species is moderate (33% for 
human, 36–44% for rat, and 38–41% for minipig plasma). PSMA-11 did not preferentially distribute to 
red blood cells as the mean blood-to-plasma ratios for PSMA-11 were below 1 (0.54 for mouse, 0.43 
for rat, 0.71 for minipig and human). 68Ga-PSMA-11 injected intravenously in mice was quickly 
eliminated from the blood, resulting in very high tumour-to-blood ratios after 2 h. Therefore, the 
accumulation of radioactivity in PSMA-positive PC-3 PIP tumours was high. In contrast, the uptake in 
the PSMA-negative PC-3 flu tumours was approximately 300-fold lower. The radioactivity level was low 
in most normal tissues, except kidneys where radioactivity was retained 2 h post-dose. Even at this 
timepoint tumour-to-kidney ratio was clearly below 1.  
• Metabolism 
PSMA-11 is metabolically stable in human, rat and minipig plasma (for 2 h) and in liver and kidney S9 
fractions (for 60 min) of the same species at physiological temperature. The non-radioactive natGa-
PSMA-11 was found to be stable in human, mouse, rat and minipig plasma up to 24 h at 37 °C. 
• Excretion 
Tissue biodistribution studies in a mouse model revealed renal excretion as a primary elimination 
route, which is consistent with clinical data. 
• Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
In vitro studies of PSMA-11 potential to inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes in human liver microsomes 
revealed that PSMA-11 is not a reversible or time-dependent inhibitor of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 
2C19, 2D6, and 3A4, as the IC50 values could not be determined. 
In vitro experiments indicated that PSMA-11 induced CYP1A2, 2B6 and 3A4 metabolic activity with the 
EC50 values of 1.58, 46.4 and 15.4 μg/mL, respectively. This corresponds to 1.67, 49.0 and 16.26 μM, 
which exceeds the theoretical clinical Cmax of 10 nM more than 150-fold. Therefore, no clinical 
relevance is expected.  
In vitro drug interaction studies with transporters showed that PSMA-11 is not an inhibitor of P-gp, 
BCRP, BSEP, MATE1, MATE2-K, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3. PSMA-11 was 
found to be not a substrate of P-gp, BCRP, MATE1, MATE2-K, OCT2, OAT1, and OAT3. 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
The toxicology of the unlabelled PSMA-11 was assessed in an extended GLP-compliant single bolus 
intravenous dose toxicity study in male and female rats (SD) including an observation period of 1 day 
(10M + 10F) or 2 weeks (5M + 5F), at doses of 0, 0.67 and 1.33 mg/kg. 
No mortalities occurred during the extended single dose toxicity study of unlabelled PSMA-11 in rats. 
Some statistically significant changes in haematological and biochemical parameters occurred within 
the study duration in the high dose groups (mainly in males) and were still present on day 15. These 
EMA/871509/2022 
Page 23/116 
 
 
 
  
 
changes did not correlate with histopathological changes, were not dose-related and not consistent 
between sexes. These findings are considered of limited relevance for the clinical situation.  
Organ weights of liver, kidney, brain and testes were still higher compared to the control on day 15 at 
the highest dose tested. Microscopically, minimal, multifocal inflammatory cell foci were seen in the 
liver, and minimal hyaline casts in the cortex of the kidney, in males and females. Since these findings 
were already present in the control group, these changes are not considered adverse. 
Remarkable were the changes at the injection site on day 2. Preferable male animals exhibited chronic 
inflammation, mainly characterised by the presence of mononuclear cells (lymphocytes, macrophages, 
and plasma cells) and accompanied by necrosis. On day 15 only one high-dosed female animal 
exhibited thrombosis as adverse reactions at the injection site.  
The extended single dose toxicity study revealed a NOAEL of 1.33 mg/kg that corresponds to a safety 
factor of 530 based on body surface area which is in accordance with the appropriate guidelines. 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
No repeat-dose toxicity studies with 68Ga-PSMA-11 or the PSMA-11 precursor were submitted (see 
discussion on non-clinical aspects).  
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
No genotoxicity studies were performed (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).  
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with 68Ga-PSMA-11 or the PSMA-11 precursor. 
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
No reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have been conducted with 68Ga-PSMA-11 or the 
PSMA-11 precursor. 
2.5.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
The toxicokinetic analysis demonstrated that PSMA-11 toxicokinetics was similar in males and females, 
with systemic exposure and peak plasma concentrations increasing with the dose level. 
2.5.4.7.  Local Tolerance  
No specific local tolerance studies have been conducted with 68Ga-PSMA-11 or the PSMA-11 precursor. 
However, examination of the injection site was included in the extended single dose toxicity study in 
the rat. 
2.5.4.8.  Other toxicity studies 
No toxicological qualification of drug substance related impurities of degradation products was 
performed, which is acceptable given the fact that PSMA-11 is a peptide and having in mind that the 
EMA/871509/2022 
Page 24/116 
 
 
 
  
 
max. specified single impurity level is 2% which in this case is far below the TTC for mutagenic 
impurities and acceptable for a product usually used as single dose.   
In silico SAR evaluation of PSMA-11 was performed with a rule-based and a statistical-based prediction 
software and did not predict any potential mutagenic structures in PSMA-11. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An ERA Phase I for the active ingredient Gozetotide/68Ga-PSMA-11 was provided. 
Regarding the PBT assessment, the provided literature is not acceptable as substitute for a logKow 
study. Nevertheless, a new study is not deemed necessary, as a logKow above the threshold value for a 
PBT assessment is highly unlikely and the most environmentally relevant property of 68Ga-PSMA-11 is 
its radioactivity, which is already addressed in the SPC. 
The PECsurfacewater calculation represents an unrealistic worst-case as the treatment regime was not 
considered. Assuming one treatment per year the PECsurfacewater can be reduced by 1/365 resulting 
in 3.4×10−7 µg/L. Consequently, it can be confirmed that a Phase II assessment is not necessary.

2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacodynamics 
PSMA is highly expressed in prostate cancer in contrast to other tissues. 68Ga-PSMA-11 is a diagnostic 
radiopharmaceutical for PET imaging of prostate cancer lesions. Its mechanism of action relies on high 
affinity binding to PSMA and on positron emission from radioactive Ga-68, which enables PET imaging. 
68Ga-PSMA-11 was shown to specifically accumulate in PSMA-positive prostate cancer cells in vitro and 
in PSMA-positive tumours in vivo. Accumulation in other organs in a mouse model was low except for 
kidneys. PSMA-11 exhibited no off-target activity further confirming its high selectivity for PSMA. 
Unlabelled PSMA-11 was not cytotoxic in PSMA-positive and PSMA-negative cells suggesting no 
pharmacological activity of the peptide itself. PSMA-11 did not inhibit hERG tail current in vitro and had 
no effects on central nervous, cardiovascular and respiratory systems in rats and minipigs that are 
EMA/871509/2022 
Page 25/116 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
considered pharmacologically relevant models. 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were conducted, which is considered acceptable, as 
gallium (68Ga) gozetotide is highly specific and selective for PSMA and PSMA shows overexpression in 
prostate cancer. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The analytical methods for quantification of PSMA-11 in vehicle by LC-UV, in Tyrode’s solution by 
HPLC-UV and in rat plasma by LC-MS/MS are considered acceptable. For the methods to determine 
PSMA-11 content in vehicle and Tyrode’s solution, linearity was shown in a narrower concentration 
range than the quantification range of the method. The in vitro plasma protein binding of PSMA-11 was 
moderate. PSMA-11 did not preferentially distribute to red blood cells as the mean blood-to-plasma 
ratios for PSMA-11 were below 1. After intravenous administration, 68Ga-PSMA-11 quickly accumulated 
within PSMA-positive PC-3 PIP tumours but not in PSMA-negative PC-3 flu tumours in mice. The 
radioactivity level was low in most normal tissues, except kidneys where radioactivity was retained 2 h 
post-dose. Even at this timepoint, tumour-to-kidney ratio was clearly below 1. The applicant explains 
that high kidney concentrations (higher than tumour concentrations) of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 could be 
expected, due to the high expression of PSMA and the fact that kidneys are the primary route of 
excretion of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11.Nevertheless, the diagnostic characteristics of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 
(short half-life and no emission of DNA-reactive beta particles) limit the safety implications for exposed 
tissues including the kidney. In addition, no indications of renal toxicity were observed in either the 
preclinical single dose toxicity study or the adverse event profile (see Clinical safety). The distribution 
study in a mouse model revealed renal excretion as a primary elimination route. PSMA-11 was 
metabolically stable in human, rat and minipig plasma and in liver and kidney S9 fractions of these 
species. PSMA-11 is not a reversible or time-dependent inhibitor of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 
2D6, and 3A4. PSMA-11 slightly induced CYP1A2, 2B6 and 3A4 metabolic activity but not to a clinically 
relevant extent. The experimental setting was not in line with the EMA guideline on the investigation of 
drug interactions (CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev. 1 Corr. 2**). One batch of hepatocytes from different 
donors, i.e. a mixture of hepatocytes from different donors, was used, although the guideline specifies 
that the induction results should be evaluated separately for each donor. The applicant argues that, 
despite using a mixture of hepatocytes from different donors, the results of the positive controls 
indicate that assay sensitivity and performance were sufficient. Although the assessors consider the 
mixing of donors not an ideal test setup, it is agreed that the response of the positive controls is 
sufficiently high in this situation to accept it. Overall, PSMA-11 is not a substrate, inhibitor or inducer 
of cytochrome P450 enzymes. PSMA-11 is not an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, BSEP, MATE1, MATE2-K, 
OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3. PSMA-11 was found to be not a substrate of P-gp, 
BCRP, MATE1, MATE2-K, OCT2, OAT1, and OAT3 (see SmPC section 5.2). It was not investigated 
whether PSMA-11 is a substrate of OCT1, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3, but this is acceptable given 
primarily renal elimination of the drug. In conclusion, based on the in vitro interaction studies, PSMA-
11 is not expected to have any clinically significant interaction with other medicinal products (see 
SmPC section 4.5).  
Toxicology 
The extended single dose toxicity study of unlabelled PSMA-11 in rats showed that the test item was 
well tolerated. Statistically significant changes were noted in terms of haematological and biochemical 
parameters. However, these changes were rather incidental than adverse. All animals (test and 
control) exhibited chronic inflammation at the injection site. Since only one female animal of the high 
dose group showed thrombosis at the injection site at the end of the recovery period changes are 
considered not relevant for the clinical setting. This highest dose tested provides a safety margin based 
on body surface area conversion of approximately 530-fold relative to the potential maximum human 
EMA/871509/2022

mass dose (25 μg) in a 1.7 m2 patient. 
No genotoxicity, carcinogenicity and long-term repeat-dose toxicity studies have been conducted with 
68Ga-PSMA-11 or the PSMA-11 precursor as they are not required for this type of radioactive oncology 
diagnostic product according to the appropriate guidelines: CHMP Guideline on the nonclinical 
requirements for radiopharmaceuticals (EMA/CHMP/SWP/686140/2018) and Microdose 
Radiopharmaceutical Diagnostic Drugs: Nonclinical Study Recommendations (Guideline for Industry, 
FDA August 2018), repeat-dose toxicity studies are not required for a microdose radiodiagnostic. For 
PSMA-11, the non-radioactive part of 68Ga-PSMA-11, a structure-activity alert relationship (SAR) 
evaluation for bacterial mutagenicity did not find any alert for potential mutagenic structural features 
in PSMA-11. 
No reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have been conducted with 68Ga-PSMA-11 or the 
PSMA-11 precursor as they are not required according to the relevant guidelines 
(EMA/CHMP/SWP/686140/2018).  
Section 4.6 of the SmPC reflects that Locametz is not indicated for use in females. There are no data 
on the use of gallium (68Ga) gozetotide in females, or on the effects on the breast-fed newborn/infant 
or on milk production, and on human fertility. 
Radiation has the potential to induce mutagenic effects on gonads and germ cells. The binding and 
internalization of 68Ga-PSMA-11 at the level of the prostate could theoretically lead to DNA damage 
during spermatogenesis and impairment of male fertility or effects on embryofoetal development. 
However, the testes radiation exposure after a [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 scan is expected to be 52-fold lower 
than the threshold of temporary infertility of 150 mGy. Therefore, no effects on spermatogenesis and 
male fertility are expected. 
Conclusions on ERA 
Locametz PEC surfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L. and is not a PBT substance as log 
Kow does not exceed 4.5. Therefore, it is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Locametz is a radiodiagnostic agent for localisation of PSMA-positive prostate  cancer lesionsby PET 
imaging. Gozetotide was evaluated in safety pharmacology and single dose toxicity studies. Non-
clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology and single dose toxicity. Mutagenicity studies and carcinogenicity studies have not been 
carried out with gallium (68Ga) gozetotide. This is in accordance with the relevant guidelines. In 
conclusion, the non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology have been adequately 
characterised in vitro and in vivo.

Additionally, the Applicant re-calculated dosimetry from the data of one published study (Sandgren et 
al.) to provide the full dosimetry dataset. The biodistribution of 68Ga-PSMA-11 was analysed in patients 
with prostate cancer. The number of patients enrolled in each study ranged from 4 to 9. 
The published pharmacokinetic data of 68Ga-PSMA-11 in blood are very limited. Sandgren et al. 
reported a rapid clearance of 68Ga-PSMA-11 from blood based on the activity measurements in blood 
samples withdrawn 45–245 min p.i. Sandgren et al. determined a bi-exponential function describing 
the time-activity curve in blood. It consisted of a fast component at the early time-points post-
injection, followed by a slow component with a half-life of 4.4 h. The latter reflected the biologic 
clearance of 68Ga-PSMA-11 from blood. Radiopharmaceutical 68Ga-PSMA-11 accumulated preferably in 
kidneys, liver, spleen, salivary glands and lacrimal glands. This was observed consistently by all 
authors. The uptake in these regions was determined based on PET/CT (or PET/MRI in the study by 
Pfob et al.) partial- or whole-body scans performed at different time-points after administration (latest 
time-point at 300 min p.i. in the study by Afshar-Oromieh et al.). Green et al. collected additionally 
urine samples and Sandgren et al. collected venous blood as well as urine samples to define and 
quantify the blood clearance and the urinary excretion of 68Ga-PSMA-11. All authors observed that 
radiopharmaceutical 68Ga-PSMA-11 is primarily excreted via kidney-urinary pathway. Green et al. 
reported that until approximately 120 minutes post-injection about 14% of administered activity of 
68Ga-PSMA-11 was excreted in urine. 
Based on the terminal elimination half-life of 4.4 h and considering that the physical half-life of Ga-68 
is 68 min, the resulting effective half-life of 68Ga-PSMA-11 is 54 min. 
In the absence of a reported Cmax, the highest anticipated injected total peptide concentration in 
plasma would be 0.01 µg/ml (10 nM) assuming the 25 µg microdose [SBP], a plasma volume of 2.5 L 
and the molecular weight of PSMA-11 of 947.0 g/mol. 
Dosimetry 
68Ga-PSMA-11 showed notable uptake in kidneys, liver, spleen and salivary glands. This was consistent 
within all studies and these organs were considered source regions in dosimetry calculations. Uptake in 
lacrimal glands was analysed by all authors except Pfob et al. Afshar-Oromieh et al. did not consider 
salivary and lacrimal glands as distinct source regions and attributed activity of 68Ga-PSMA-11 
accumulated in these organs to source region body remainder. All authors confirmed a predominantly 
renal excretion of 68Ga-PSMA-11 and urinary bladder contents was a source region in dose calculations 
done by all authors. The assumed voiding intervals / voiding times were not specified in some of the 
studies. Sandgren et al. also calculated TIAC for blood based on the measured activity of 68Ga-PSMA-
11 in blood samples withdrawn up to 245 min p.i. and subsequently used this value in dosimetry. 
All studies except the one by Sandgren et al. employed the software OLINDA/EXM for the calculation of 
absorbed organ dose coefficients. The effective dose coefficients were derived according to the 
formalism and the tissue weighting factors of the ICRP Publication 60 (1991). Sandgren et al. used the 
software IDAC-Dose 2.1 for dosimetry and computed the effective dose coefficients with the formalism 
and tissue weighting factors recommended in the ICRP Publication 103 (2007). 
Sandgren et al. additionally applied Monte Carlo methods to include lacrimal glands as a source region 
in dosimetric calculations. 
Initially, the applicant selected the study by Demirci et al. as a key publication. However, methodology 
utilized by Sandgren et al. was considered more adequate, and replacement of data by Demirci et al. 
with Sangren et al. was requested by the CHMP.

Tissue dosimetry was similar across studies for 68Ga-PSMA-11 with high levels in kidney, salivary and 
lacrimal glands, spleen and liver. 
Sandgren et al. reported the dose coefficients for a limited number of organs.  
The Applicant has gained access to raw data collected by Sandgren et al. and re-calculated all 
absorbed dose coefficients (for the organs published by the authors and for those missing in the 
publication) using a methodology similar to the original one described by Sandgren et al. The 
intermediate results (Time-integrated activity coefficients, organ blood masses, and lacrimal gland S-
Value) as published in the Sandgren et al. and received as supplementary data from the sponsor of the 
study (Umea University), were assumed to be valid, and the recalculation started with these 
intermediate results. 
Approximately 75% of the organ absorbed doses originally reported by Sandgren et al. were 
reproduced to within ± 5%, and the remaining 25% of the organ absorbed doses were reproduced to 
within ± 10%. The effective dose was reproduced to within less than 1% of the Sandgren et al. 
reported value (see below).

using blood corrected TIACs derived from the published TIACs, 3) using the blood corrected TIACs 
derived from the supplemental data supplied, 4) using the median values of the reported and blood

Two bridging studies in Japanese and Chinese population are currently planned. The gallium (68Ga) 
gozetotide dosimetry data from the Japanese study (CAAA617A11201) are expected to be available in 
approximately 4-6 patients in Q3 2024. The gallium (68Ga) gozetotide dosimetry assessments in this 
study are not mandatory but optional according to the protocol. 
The gallium (68Ga) gozetotide dosimetry data from the Chinese study (CAAA617A12201) are expected 
to be available: 
• 
• 
in approximately 4-6 patients in Q2 2027 (interim results) 
in approximately 4-6 additional patients in Q3 2028 (final results) 
Once available, the Applicant will report the results within the PSUR. 
Elimination 
Results from in vitro metabolism studies showed that 68Ga-PSMA-11 was metabolically stable against 
the enzymatic degradation by human liver and kidney S9 fraction for up to 1 hour, indicating negligible 
metabolism in human (see Non-clinical section). 
PSMA-11 showed high rates of renal excretion and excretion into the urinary bladder (Pfob et al 2016). 
Cumulative urinary excretion after 120 minutes post-injection of 68Ga-PSMA-11 accounted for 14% of 
the administered dose (Green et al 2017). In the studies evaluating dosimetry of 68Ga-PSMA-11 no 
transfer of activity to alimentary tract was reported. 
The inter- and intra-subject variability in 68Ga-PSMA-11 PK, biodistribution, and dosimetry related to 
the differences in the formulation was not assessed. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
No data were provided. 68Ga-PSMA-11 is dosed based on MBq/kg body weight, therefore, the 
administered dose/radioactivity depends on the body weight. 
Special populations 
Studies in special populations have not been submitted. Subgroup analyses to test the possible effects 
of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on safety were performed on the data in PSMA-617-01 clinical studies 
and did not reveal considerable effects (refer to section Clinical safety).  
Given the low micro-dose, fast elimination and short effective half-life of less than an hour, renal 
impairment was regarded unlikely to have a clinical impact on PK or biodistribution of 68GaPSMA 11 
EMA/871509/2022 
Page 36/116 
 
 
 
  
 
 
with respect to safety or the imaging performance and no dose adjustment is proposed for patients 
with renal impairment. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No clinical drug-drug interaction studies were submitted. 68Ga-PSMA-11 is a single, microdose 
administration exerting no pharmacological effect, and a short biological half-life which suggests the 
risk for drug-drug interactions is minimal. 
In vitro metabolism and interaction studies with transporters and plasma protein binding 
measurements performed on 68Ga–SMA-11 indicate that the compound has a very low risk for clinically 
relevant drug-drug interactions. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials  
Please refer to section on non-clinical aspects.  
Different formulations and bridging 
The proposed commercial formulation of the product was not tested in a clinical study and differs from 
the 11 formulations of 68Ga-PSMA-11 applied in the single clinical trial conducted by the Applicant 
(Study PSMA-617-01), as well as in the studies from published literature. No bioequivalence or 
bridging studies were provided. 
pH and osmolality 
The range of pH of the commercial parenteral solution  and the PSMA-617-01 study formulations  
differ. The targeted pH specification is in line with the pH of another authorized diagnostic medicinal 
productNo direct comparison between the proposed commercial formulation (AAA) and the 
formulations used in the PSMA-617-01 study was performed, as no osmolality result was available for 
the formulations used in the PSMA-617-01 study. The estimated osmolality of 68Ga-Locametz is 
roughly within the range of 600 to 800 mOsm/kg. 
Peptide mass 
The 25 µg peptide amount in the proposed kit (22.5 - 27.5 µg /vial) is in line with the 
recommendations of the Ph. Eur. Monograph (3044) for “Gallium (68Ga) PSMA-11 Injection”.  
Saturation effects at the lesion level is regarded highly unlikely based on the following: An estimated 
total peptide concentration in plasma (Cmax) is 0.01 µg/mL (10 nM); Experiments in a mouse model 
showed that a 16-fold excess of PSMA-11 mass, achieved by varying the specific activity of the 100 µCi 
administration, did not translate into a marked change in tumor uptake (Pillarsetty et al 2016); A 100-
fold increase in the mass of co-administered PSMA-11 did not impact the uptake of 177Lu-PSMA-617 in 
PSMA-positive xenografts (Kalidindi et al 2021).  
Kit used in PSMA-617-01 study and proposed commercial formulation 
The kit-based process has been used in the PSMA-617-01 study to prepare 68Ga-PSMA-11 doses, in 
addition to the more commonly used automatic module-based process. It has been shown that 
automated synthesis module and sterile cold kit for 68Ga-PSMA-11 do not show differences in PET/CT 
image quality (Calderoni et al 2020).

2.6.2.1.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
68Ga-PSMA-11 as a radioactive diagnostic agent is designed for molecular imaging and does not exert 
any pharmacodynamic effect. 68Ga PSMA 11 has high affinity for PSMA, which is usually overexpressed 
in prostate cancer lesions, in cancerous lymph nodes and other metastases and bone lesions. 
Competitive cell binding assays determined the binding affinity of 67Ga-PSMA-11 in PSMA positive 
LNCaP cells to be 12.0 ± 2.8 nM. Biochemical studies revealed the inhibition potency of natGa-PSMA-
11, the non-radioactive surrogate, using an enzyme-based NAALADase assay with recombinant human 
PSMA to be 7.5 ± 2.2 nM (Eder et al 2012).  
Cell uptake and internalization studies of 68Ga-PSMA-11 were conducted with PC-3 PIP [+] and [-] flu 
cells after incubation for 2 and 4 h, respectively. The uptake of 68Ga-PSMA-11 into PSMA-positive PC-3 
PIP cells was approximately 55% to 70%, whereas the internalized fraction was about 10% to 15% of 
total added activity. The uptake dropped to < 0.5% when PSMA-negative PC-3 flu cells were used, 
which demonstrates PSMA-specific uptake/internalization of 68Ga-PSMA-11 (Umbricht et al 2017). 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Pharmacodynamical effects of 68Ga-PSMA-11 were reported in multiple published studies. Results from 
two studies are summarised in this section (Prasad et al. 2016 and Afshar-Oromieh et al. 2013). 
Higher median uptake of PSMA ligands in prostate tumours compared to normal prostate was shown 
by means of calculating standard uptake values (SUV) in various organs and tissues in the patients 
with PCa by Prasad et al 2016. In this study highest uptake (median/IQR/range) of the tracer was 
found in the kidneys (49.6/40.7–57.6/2.7–97.0) followed by the submandibular glands (17.3/13.7–
21.2/7.5– 30.4), parotid glands (16.1/12.2–19.8/5.5–30.9) and duodenum (13.8/10.5–17.2/5.8–
26.9). The best cut-off value for differentiating physiological uptake in the primary tumour from that in 
the prostate was found to be an SUVmax of 3.2. The median SUVmax in the primary tumour (n=35), 
locally recurrent PCA (n=8), lymph node (n=166), bone (n=157) and other metastases (n=3) were 
10.2, 5.9, 6.2, 7.4 and 3.8, respectively. The best cut-off values for differentiating non-pathological 
uptake in lymph nodes and bones from tumour uptake were found to be SUVmax of 3.2 and 1.9, 
respectively. Patients with PSA G2 had significantly lower SUVmax in bone metastases as compared to 
patients with PSA ≥2 (pG 0.01).

Metastases and recurrent PC, as well as lesions suspicious for prostate carcinoma, presented with 
excellent contrast at 1 h post injection of 68Ga-PSMA-11 leading to an excellent detection rate of 
lesions suspicious for cancer even at low PSA levels (Afshar-Oromieh et al 2013). Median tumour to 
background ratios were 18.8 (2.4–158.3) in early images and 28.3 (2.9–224.0) in late images (after 3 
h).

2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
68Ga-PSMA-11 is administered via i.v. injection and its bioavailability is 100%. No food effects have 
been studied, which is acceptable given the administration route. 
Distribution of the substance has been adequately studied and characterised. 68Ga-PSMA-11 is rapidly 
and extensively distributed with uptake being highest in kidneys, liver, spleen, salivary glands and 
lacrimal glands. 68Ga-PSMA-11 showed a bi exponential profile in blood consisting of a fast component 
early time-points (6.5 min) after injection, followed by a slow component with a half-life of 4.4 h. The 
slow component reflected the biologic clearance of 68Ga-PSMA-11 from blood. The half-life of the fast 
component estimated by Sandgren et al. is associated with a substantial uncertainty and cannot be 
well characterised due to a lack of experimental data at the early time-points. Effective half-life of 
68Ga-PSMA-11 is 54 min. At 120 min post injection 14% of administered substance was excreted. 
In the absence of a reported Cmax, the highest anticipated injected total peptide concentration in 
plasma would be 0.01 µg/ml (10 nM) assuming the 25 µg microdose, which is low. This is in the same 
range as the in vitro binding affinity constants for PMSA-11 (7.5-12 nM) (see non-clinical 
pharmacology) and, therefore, target binding is unlikely to be saturated. 
The substance is not metabolised and non-clinical studies did not reveal potential for drug interactions, 
therefore, no PK drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted, which is agreed.  
Kidney is the organ receiving the highest absorbed dose because of the predominantly urinary 
excretion of 68Ga-PSMA-11 and the physiological expression of PSMA in renal proximal tubules. Three 
other organs receiving the next highest absorbed doses are lacrimal glands, salivary glands and 
urinary bladder wall, the latter mainly through the activity of 68Ga-PSMA-11 in urine.  
Initially, for dosimetry assessments, the applicant selected the study by Demirci et al. as a key 
publication. However, there are several limitations that this study carries and study by Sandgren et al. 
appears more adequate as the “key” source of dosimetry information. This opinion is based on the 
following:  
- Software OLINDA/EXM used by Demirci et al. does not provide absorbed dose coefficients for the 
complete list of target regions as specified for the current ICRP reference phantoms, in contrast to the 
EMA/871509/2022 
Page 40/116 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
software IDAC-Dose 2.1 used by Sandgren et al. The effective dose coefficients were calculated by 
Demirci et al. (and all other authors except Sandgren et al.) according to the formalism and the tissue 
weighting factors of the ICRP Publication 60 (1991). The current recommendations of the ICRP 
(Publication 103 from 2007) employ a different formalism and updated values of the tissue weighting 
factors. The effective dose coefficients reported by Sandgren et al. were computed using the new 
tissue weighting factors from the ICRP Publication 103 (2007). Note that according to the ICRP 
Publication 103, the effective dose is to be calculated as an average value between men and women. 
However, 68Ga-PSMA-11 is administered to patients with prostate cancer, and, thus, only one 
component of the effective dose from 68Ga-PSMA-11 can be calculated – for adult males. 
- Although the activity of 68Ga-PSMA-11 in blood can be attributed to body remainder for dose 
calculations, considering blood as an explicit source region provides a more realistic distribution of 
68Ga-PSMA-11 activity and, thus, its contribution to absorbed doses of body organs and tissues. Blood 
was treated as an explicit source region only in the article by Sandgren et al. 
- The comparison of data across conducted studies revealed substantial differences in TIACs for various 
organs between the work of Demirci et al.and the work of Sandgren et al.. The total number of 
documented disintegrations differ notably, with Demirci et al. accounting for only nearly half of the 
disintegrations reported by Sandgren et al. The discrepancies in TIACs for liver, spleen, salivary glands 
and lacrimal glands were probably caused by the different assumed organ masses used to scale the 
measured activity concentrations to the activities in whole organs, besides the possible inter-patient 
variability in measured activity concentrations. The TIACs in urinary bladder contents as well as the 
total number of disintegrations are highly affected by the assumptions made regarding the bladder 
voiding. Sandgren et al. assumed conservatively 3.5 hours voiding intervals. Demirci et al. did not 
report which voiding intervals / voiding times were considered. The lower values reported by Demirci 
et al. might be explained by shorter voiding intervals assumed than those in Sandgren et al. 
Considering the above, the dose coefficients for organ doses and the effective dose obtained by 
Sandgren et al. are considered more robust and complete than those described by Demirci et al., and 
are therefore included in the SmPC. Furthermore,  since the dose coefficients for 11 organs were not 
reported in the publication by Sandgren et al., the Applicant has gained access to raw data collected 
and re-calculated dosimetry in accordance with a methodology closely similar to the one described in 
the publication. The presented approach for choice of the methodology for recalculation is supported. 
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to estimate the robustness of the data and absorbed doses per 
administered activity of the organs presented in the original publication were compared to the re-
calculated values. These analyses showed that the maximum difference between the re-calculated 
values and the original data-set did not differ by more than 10% and that the re-calculated and 
original effective doses did not differ relevantly either. It is agreed that the differences observed 
between the re-calculated and original data are not clinically relevant which  supports adequacy of the 
methodology applied for dosimetry calculation for missing organs. The dosimetry table included in the 
SmPC includes a combination of the original data and the re-calculated dosimetry results for 27 organs 
including effective dose which is considered appropriate.  
Studies in special populations were not submitted. Subgroup analyses to test the possible effects of 
intrinsic and extrinsic factors on safety were performed on the data in PSMA-617-01 clinical study but 
did not reveal relevant impact on safety profile of the product. Although, these analyses are not 
considered adequate to replace a proper study in special populations, different effects in special 
populations (e.g., race, hepatic impairment) are considered unlikely. Gender effects and studies in 
children are not relevant given the intended use only in adult males. Also, doses and effects in older 
and elderly (Typical population) is sufficiently characterised. The risk of increased local radiation 
exposure and potential impact on renal function (given that kidney is the main elimination pathway) is 
EMA/871509/2022 
Page 41/116 
 
 
 
  
 
regarded negligible due to the micro dosing regimen and short physical half-life of 68Ga. Based on the 
same arguments, dose adjustment in the patients with renal impairment is considered not necessary. 
Inter- and intra-patient variability was not assessed, as in the studies, several sources of variability 
(i.e., disease state, dose, imaging acquisition time, equipment, data collection, data analysis) were 
present and no proper assessment of true inter-subject variability is possible. This is acceptable. 
The Applicant’s proposed commercial product was not used in any study. In lieu of bioequivalence 
studies, quality evidence was referenced (see Quality section) in order to bridge the proposed 
commercial product to the formulations used in Study PSMA-617-01 as well as to the literature. 
Notably, composition of the majority of the used formulations in the study is unknown. This, however, 
is not seen as blocking issue, as the majority of the 68Ga-PSMA-11 products applied in the published 
studies would be expected to comply with the pharmacopeia monograph (Eur. Ph. 3044) and no 
interactions between excipients and 68Ga-PSMA-11 would be expected.  
Concerns regarding the higher presence of “cold” PSMA-11 in Locametz was raised, because the dose 
is based on the amount of (bound) Gallium, but the protein content could be higher. This could have 
implications for its sensitivity compared to the literature. However, this was resolved based on the pre-
clinical evidence (Kalidindi et al., 2021), that suggests that no relevant difference in the uptake of 
68Ga-PSMA-11 would be expected with up-to 1000 fold increase of “cold” PSMA in the administered 
solution. 
The proposed pH specification is lower than foreseen by the Pharmacopeia monograph “Gallium (68Ga) 
PSMA-11 Injection” (Eur. Ph. 3044). This may be a safety issue. However, another diagnostic product 
with similarly low pH has been authorised and in use (pH 3.2 – 3.8; SomaKit TOC by Advanced 
Accelerator Applications; EMEA/H/C/004140; approved in 2016) with a single injection site reaction – 
“injection site pain” – reported as an adverse event (AE) related to low pH. Thus, similar safety risks 
can be expected from 68Ga-Locametz. 
It is acknowledged that high osmolality may be relevant for local tolerability of an i.v. formulation. 
Osmolality of the 68Ga-PSMA-11 formulations applied in VISION and published studies is unknown. The 
Applicant has introduced an additional mandatory dilution prior to the administration of 68Ga-labeled 
Locametz (see SmPC section 12) in order to reduce osmolality of the to-be-injected solution. The 
osmolality of 68Ga-Locametz at the time of injection is now estimated to be roughly within the range of 
600 to 800 mOsm/kg (see section Quality aspects), which is below the acknowledged threshold of 
tolerability of 1000 mOsm/kg for i.v. small volume (≤100 mL) injections (Wang et al., 2015) and 
acceptable from the safety/tolerability point of view.  
Gentisic acid (the single excipient not included in comparator formulations) is applied to stabilize the 
68Ga-PSMA-11 complexes. Thus, worsening in the diagnostic performance is not expected. The same 
excipient is also used in already approved products (e.g. TechneScan and Octreoscan) in quantities 
that are similar or higher than the amount (i.e. 1 mg) present in the proposed formulation. Thus, no 
concerns regarding the safety/tolerability, or potential impact on efficacy are being raised in regards to 
this excipient. 
In conclusion, the bridging to the products used in the published studies can be considered established, 
except for some remaining uncertainty regarding the frequency of injection site reactions, which 
cannot reliably be estimated currently. However, this is not regarded as a major issue.  
In vitro metabolism and interaction studies with transporters and plasma protein binding 
measurements performed on 68Ga-PSMA-11 indicate that the compound has a low risk for clinically 
relevant drug-drug interactions.

Pharmacodynamics 
PSMA 11 was shown to have high affinity for PSMA, which is usually overexpressed in prostate cancer 
lesions, in cancerous lymph nodes and other metastases and bone lesions. Administration of 68Ga-
labelled PSMA-11 made these tissues detectable with PET visually and by means of semi-
quantitative/quantitative measurement methods (e.g., standardised uptake value (SUV)). The most 
appropriate cut-off value for differentiating physiological uptake in the primary tumour from that in the 
prostate was found to be an SUVmax of 3.2. The most appropriate cut-off values for differentiating 
non-pathological uptake in lymph nodes and bones from tumour uptake were found to be SUVmax of 
3.2 and 1.9, respectively (Prasad et al.). Increase in tracer uptake in tumour was observed after 3 
hours post-injection as compared to 1 h. However, uptake at 1 h was already high enough to suffice 
for good detectability (Afshar-Oromieh et al.) that supports the proposed imaging time. PD effects are 
thus sufficiently characterized. 
Notably, the tracer also binds to healthy tissues. This may lead to mistakes in image interpretation, 
especially in pelvic area due to interference with activity in urine bladder. The latter is an 
acknowledged issue and has been addressed in section 4.4 of the SmPC with recommendation to let 
patient void prior to PET imaging.  
No PD interactions were studied in humans given the low dose administered, single application and 
lack of potential of interaction. This is in general accepted. However, while no PD interactions in the 
classical sense are expected, some concomitant medications may have impact on efficacy/diagnostic 
and technical performance of the product. E.g., Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and other 
therapies targeting the androgen pathway, such as androgen receptor antagonists, have been reported 
to modulate PSMA expression. Impact of these therapies on diagnostic performance of 68Ga-gozetotide 
has been reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC. Furosemide is commonly used as a concomitant 
medication during injection of 68Ga-PSMA to reduce the extent of signal scatter from the urinary 
bladder on 68Ga-PSMA-PET images through increased voiding. However, firm evidence sufficient for 
recommendation of furosemide use is currently lacking, therefore this is not a recommended in the 
SmPC.  
Across the published literature from studies of varying size, aim and design, high sensitivity and 
specificity were achieved for 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET, supporting the confidence in the performance of 68Ga-
PSMA-11 PET to select patients with PSMA-expressing prostate cancer lesions. 
No clinical data on secondary pharmacology were submitted. In nonclinical studies addressing the risk 
for QT interval prolongation, no signs of interference were observed. 
No clinical data on secondary pharmacology are available. In nonclinical studies addressing the risk for 
QT interval prolongation, no signs of interference were observed. This is considered acceptable. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In conclusion, pharmacokinetics of PSMA-11 in humans has not been comprehensively studied and 
described (e.g., excretion, dose proportionality, PK in the patients with hepatic or renal impairment). 
However, given the micro-dose applied and single application mode, the presented data package is 
acceptable. Bridging to other formulations utilized in the published literature and VISION study can be 
considered established, even though some uncertainty regarding local tolerability remains. The clinical 
PK and PD data package for 68Ga-PSMA-11 is acceptable. At the chemical concentrations used for 
diagnostic examinations, 68Ga-PSMA-11 does not have any pharmacodynamic activity. No dose 
adjustment is required in older patients, in patients with renal impairment or in patients with hepatic 
impairment. No clinically significant interactions with other medicinal products are expected. Initially, 
EMA/871509/2022 
Page 43/116 
 
 
 
  
 
the applicant selected the study by Demirci et al as a key publication. On request of the CHMP 
dosimetry data by Sandgren et al. have now been applied in the SmPC.   
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The Applicant submitted data from two own studies and a large number of published evidence to 
support efficacy claims. Own studies and two publications were presented as main evidence.  
Note: Throughout the clinical dossier the Applicant refers to the PSMA-11 products approved in the 
USA recently (NDA 212642 and 212643 from UCLA and UCSF). For these products, data cited in the 
labels or FDA assessment reports cannot be utilized, as, irrespective of the legal basis of the 
application, assessment reports such as the EPAR for EU marketing authorisations or similar summary 
reports from competent authorities inside and outside the EU which are made publicly available by 
competent authorities for reasons of transparency, cannot be considered to meet the requirements of 
Annex I of Directive 2001/83/EC. Therefore, the respective citations and data have not been 
considered and included into this report. 
2.6.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No dedicated dose-response study has been submitted. 
The recommended dose of 68Ga-PSMA-11 is 1.8-2.2 MBq/kg of body weight (0.049 - 0.059 mCi/kg), 
with a minimum dose of 111 MBq (3 mCi) up to a maximum dose of 259 MBq (7 mCi). This dose range 
comprises the proposed radioactivity dose of 1.8 - 2.2 MBq per kg recommended by the Joint EANM 
and SNMMI procedure guideline for prostate cancer imaging (Fendler et al 2017b) and also in line with 
the recently approved 68Ga PSMA-11 labels (Gallium Ga 68 PSMA-11 USPI 2020a, Gallium Ga 68 
PSMA-11 USPI 2020b). Lower doses than 1.8 MBq/kg were shown to adversely affect image quality 
and lesion detectability in a simulation experiment (Rauscher et al 2020).  
In Study PSMA-617-01, 68Ga-PSMA-11 was planned to be administered intravenously at a dose of 111-
185 MBq (3 - 5 mCi) which is within the range of the intended dose of 1.8-2.2 MBq per kg. The actual 
dose administered to patients in Study PSMA-617-01 ranged from 92.8 MBq (2.5 mCi) to 287.5 MBq 
(7.8 mCi), with a corresponding body weight adjusted dose range of 0.9-3.7 MBq per kg (median 
dose: 1.9 MBq/kg). Overall, 149 patients received activity injected-decay corrected dose exceeding 5 
mCi (> 185 MBq) with a mean dose of 2.3 MBq/kg in Study PSMA-617-01. 
From a safety perspective, dose of 1.8-2.2 MBq/kg results in an effective radiation dose of 2.37- 
3.87 mSv for an administered activity of 150 MBq (Fendler et al (2017b), Afshar-Oromieh et al (2016), 
Demirci et al (2018), Green et al (2017), Pfob et al (2016), Sandgren et al (2019)). This level of 
radioactivity is lower than other PET agents used for prostate cancer imaging and well within the 
effective dose from a diagnostic CT. For a 7 mCi (259 MBq) dose, at the maximum end of the proposed 
commercial dose range, the effective dose would be 6.68 mSv. This radiation exposure is in range with 
other standard of care radio-diagnostic procedures (e.g. a diagnostic CT scan would lead to 
approximately 15-20 mSv) (McCollough et al 2015, Martí-Climent 2017, Akin et al 2017).  
Maximum volume of up to 10 ml of 68Ga-Locametz is recommended to be administered.  
Amount of the PSMA-11 
In terms of mass dose, one dose of 68Ga PSMA 11 prepared from PSMA-11 Sterile Cold kit contains not 
more than 25 µg total mass.  
Imaging time

Based on the use of 68Ga-PSMA-11 in Study PSMA-617-01, as well as published clinical experience and 
the Joint EANM and SNMMI procedure guideline for prostate cancer imaging (Fendler et al 2017), the 
recommended imaging time is at 50-100 minutes after the i.v. administration of 68Ga-PSMA-11. 
Afshar-Oromieh et al (2013) showed that metastases and recurrent prostate cancer were visualized 
with adequate contrast at 1 h p.i. of the 68Ga PSMA 11, contributing to a good detection rate of lesions 
suspicious for cancer even at low PSA levels. This was supported by the observation that all of the 65 
lesions suspicious for cancer were clearly seen in 1 h p.i. images.

Hofman et al (2020) conducted a prospective, multicenter, two-arm, randomized, Phase 3 study in 
men with high-risk, biopsy-proven PCa, who were being considered for radical prostatectomy or 
radiotherapy with curative intent. The trial aimed to investigate whether PSMA PET-CT had improved 
accuracy when compared with the combination of CT and bone scan. The diagnostic utility of PSMA 
PET-CT as a replacement for conventional imaging was explored. 
Cross-over imaging was done within 14 days of the first-line imaging. Results of first-line imaging were 
available when reporting second-line imaging. Imaging was interpreted by experienced radiologists and 
nuclear medicine specialists, some of whom were further involved with the trial. At 6 months repeat 
imaging as per randomised group was done. 
The primary outcome of the trial was accuracy (assessed by the area under the curve (AUC) of the 
receiver operating characteristic curve) of first-line imaging for identifying either pelvic nodal or distant 
metastatic disease. The AUC was calculated as the mean of the estimated sensitivity and specificity.  
The reference standard was determined by each site’s principal investigator at 6 months using a 
predefined composite criteria. Cases were considered positive if one of the hard or at least three soft 
criteria were met. 
Table 5: Hard and soft criteria for definition of SOT/composite SOT 
The reference standard was defined separately for pelvic nodal and distant metastases. All available 
imaging and follow-up including second-line imaging, if done, was used to define hard and soft criteria. 
Intended management and change in patient management was collected prospectively at baseline, 
after first-line and second-line imaging. Management decisions were considered in the setting of 
support from multi-disciplinary genitourinary oncology teams in participating academic centres. 
Management change was defined by a change in treatment intent (e.g., curative to palliative), addition 
EMA/871509/2022 
Page 48/116 
 
 
 
  
 
 
or removal of a treatment modality, or change in surgery or radiotherapy technique. Change was 
classified as high (change in management intent or modality), medium (change in modality delivery), 
low (management plan was not altered), or potential effect ignored (management plan not altered 
despite findings showing distant metastatic disease). 
PSMA PET-CT images were reviewed also by a central imaging laboratory of expert readers (blinding 
not reported).  
Statistics: a sample size of 300 patients (150 per group) was calculated to achieve a power of 0·85 
using the following pragmatic assumptions: (1) conventional imaging has a true underlying AUC of 
0·65, consisting of a sensitivity of 0·65 and a specificity of 0·65; (2) PSMA PET-CT has a true 
underlying AUC of 0·9, consisting of a sensitivity of 0·9 and a specificity of 0·9; (3) the proportion of 
patients with pelvic nodal or distant metastatic disease is 25%; (4) a margin of 10% improvement 
(absolute) in AUC is required to declare PSMA PET-CT superior; (5) a two sided type I error of 10%; 
and (6) allow for a 10% patient dropout. The initial sample of 200 patients was based on an estimated 
proportion of cases of 40%, that was later revised to 25% (without reviewing study data).  
For the primary endpoint, all participants with first-line imaging and reference standard were included 
in the analysis. Lesions rated as equivocal were considered negative for metastatic disease. The 
primary analysis was a patient-level analysis. The p-value for the null hypothesis that the AUC for 
PSMA PET-CT is 10% greater (absolutely) than the AUC in the conventional imaging group. 
The analyses of the primary objective were repeated for nodal and distant metastatic groups and 
sensitivity analysis was done in which equivocal lesions were considered positive for metastases. 
For secondary outcomes, the proportion of patients with management effect and equivocal findings 
were compared using Fisher’s exact test. Radiation exposure was compared using Student’s unpaired 
t-test. Reporter agreement between local and central readers were assessed using Cohen’s weighted κ. 
To assess the incremental accuracy of second-line imaging, the proportion of patients who were 
upstaged by identification of nodal or distant metastases was calculated; the number of patients who 
were accurately or inaccurately upstaged using the 6-month reference standard was also calculated. 
Results: A total of 302 men (median age, IQR: 69.0 years, 63.0-73.5) were recruited. 293 (98%) men 
had tumour of ISUP grade group 3 or more, 65 (22%) with PSA concentration of 20 ng/mL or more 
(half with less than 10 ng/mL), and 82 (27%) men with clinical stage T3–4. Data from a total of 150 
patients from the conventional imaging group and 145 patients from the PSMA PET-CT group were 
used in the primary endpoint analysis. 
Mean (SD) dose of 162.8 (39.6) for first-line imaging and mean (SD) time from injection to start of 
scan of 62.6 (19.0) min was reported. Patient populations in the two arms were roughly similar. 
Compared to conventional imaging with CT and bone scan, PSMA PET-CT demonstrated greater 
accuracy (92%; 95% CI: 88–95% vs. 65%; 95% CI: 60–69%; p < 0.0001), higher sensitivity (85%; 
95% CI: 74–96% vs. 38%; 95% CI: 24–52%), and higher specificity (98%; 95% CI: 95–100% vs. 
91%; 95% CI: 85–97%) at the patient-level. There were also fewer equivocal results (7%; 95% CI: 
4–13% vs. 23%; 95% CI: 17–31%, p < 0.001) and lower radiation exposure (8.4 mSv; 95% CI: 8.1–
8.7 vs.19.2 mSv; 95% CI: 18.2–20.3). A sensitivity analysis in which lesions that were rated as 
equivocal were considered positive instead of negative for metastatic disease, as well as subgroup 
analyses on patients with pelvic nodal and distant metastatic disease, showed consistently superior 
results for PSMA PET-CT with respect to accuracy. Level of agreement of two central readers with local 
readers was high with PSMA PET-CT for nodal (Cohen’s weighted κ = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.81–0.94) and 
distant metastatic disease (0.88, 95% CI: 0.84–0.92).

Management change was more frequently reported after PSMA PET-CT compared to conventional 
imaging, for both first-line PSMA PET-CT (28%; 95% CI: 21–36% vs. 15%; 95% CI: 10–22%, p = 
0.008), and second-line PSMA PET-CT (27%; 95% CI: 20–35 vs. 5%; 95% CI: 2–10). Compared with 
the reference standard, changes in staging were correct in 26 patients (18%; 95% CI: 12–25%) for 
PSMA PET-CT vs. 3 patients (2%; 95% CI: 0–6%) for conventional imaging. Transition from curative

to palliative intent treatment was identified in 14% of patients and change in treatment approach was 
found in another 14%. 
van Kalmthout et al (2020) conducted a prospective, multicenter study to evaluate the diagnostic 
accuracy of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in detection of lymph node metastasis during primary staging before 
external pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND) in newly diagnosed PC patients. A total of 103 
intermediate (n=11) to high risk (n=92) PC patients (median age, range: 70 years, 53-82) were 
included. All patients had biopsy-proven PC, a negative bone scan, and were at > 10% risk for lymph 
node metastasis, according to the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) risk criteria. An 
intravenous dose of 1.5 MBq/kg of 68Ga-PSMA-11 was administered; PET scans were acquired 60 
minutes after injection. 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT scans were first assessed by nuclear medicine physicians, 
whose readings was used for the assessment of impact in patient management and then assessed in a 
second round of review by 2 independent blinded reviewers who rated suspicious pathology findings in 
the prostate region, regional and nonregional lymph nodes, and osseous and visceral lesions according 
to a 5-point scale. A third independent reviewer was used in case of discrepancies. The sensitivity, 
specificity, PPV, and NPV of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT were calculated per patient and per resection template. 
Histopathology after ePLND was used as the reference standard. Change in management was 
recorded. 
Out of 97 patients that underwent ePLND, 41 (42.3%) had histologically identified 85 lymph node 
metastases, with positive PET scans for 17 patients. Patient-level sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV 
of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT were 41.5% (95% CI: 26.7-57.8), 90.9% (95% CI: 79.3-96.6), 77.3% (95% CI: 
54.2-91.3), and 67.6% (95% CI: 55.6-77.7), respectively. Template-based sensitivity, specificity, PPV, 
and NPV 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT were 35.1% (95% CI: 23.2-48.9), 96.4% (95% CI: 93.5-98.1), 64.5% 
(95% CI: 45.4-80.2), and 89.0% (95% CI: 85.0-92.0), respectively.  
Median diameter of the PET-avid regional lymph node metastasis was 7.0 mm (range 0.3 to 35.0). Of 
the 41 lymph node metastases that were missed in 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT readings, the median 
metastatic deposit was 3.0 mm (range 0.5 to 35.0). The difference between the median sizes of 
detected vs. missed lymph node metastases was significant (7.0 vs. 3.0 mm, p = 0.04). 
Agreement was moderate (κ = 0.58) among the nuclear medicine physicians examining the images. 
Interreader agreement was substantial (κ = 0.67) for the 2 independent blinded readers in the second 
scan review. A third reviewer reached consensus in 45 discordant imaging reports. 
Based on PET findings and subsequent tumor board discussions on these findings, a treatment change 
occurred in 13 patients (12.6%): the ePLND template was extended in 6 cases and canceled in another 
6 cases; and 5.8% of patients avoided having to undergo an unnecessary invasive operation due to 
distant metastasis. 
Yaxley et al (2019) conducted a retrospective study in 208 patients (median age, range: 68 years, 44-
80) with intermediate (n=85) and high risk (n=123) PC to assess the ability of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT 
in predicting pelvic lymph node metastasis before pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) and radical 
prostatectomy. The primary objective of the study evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV 
of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging on a per patient and per nodal basis. Histopathology was used as the 
standard of truth by which to compare the imaging results for both primary tumor and lymph node 
metastasis; all pathology findings were reviewed by 3 experienced uropathologists. The average 
injected dose of 68Ga-PSMA-11 was 200 MBq, with a minimum uptake time of 45-60 minutes following 
injection. PET scans were read by experienced nuclear physician radiologists. Primary staging of 
patients, using 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT, was implemented prior to PLND and radical prostatectomy, and 
pre-treatment values for PSA (median, range: 7.6 ug/l, 1.5-51), Gleason score 4 + 5, and ISUP score 
(median: 5) were collected.

Primary prostate tumors were detected in 95.2% of the patients, with a standardized uptake value 
(SUV) of ≥ 3. The median long axis diameter of malignant nodes identified on histology was 4.8 mm 
(range 0.2 to 40). The median long axis diameter of malignant nodes identified as positive by PSMA in 
concordance with histology was 6.8 mm (range 0.2 to 40). Only 14.6% of histologically confirmed 
positive lymph nodes with a long axis < 5 mm in diameter were identified by 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT prior 
to PLND. On a per patient basis, 177 patients had negative findings with 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT, while 
34 of these patients showed histological evidence of lymph node metastasis, resulting in an NPV of 
80.8% (95% CI 74.2-86.3). Twenty-one patients were histologically confirmed as positive for lymph 
node metastasis (out of 31 patients with positive 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging), resulting in a PPV of 
67.7% (95% CI 48.6-83.3). Twenty-one out the 55 patients with histologically-confirmed metastasis 
were positively identified with 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT for a patient-level sensitivity of 38.2% (95% CI: 
25.4-52.3). Out of 153 patients with histologically confirmed negative lymph nodes, 143 were negative 
with 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT for a patient-level specificity of 93.5% (95% CI: 88.3-96.8). Per patient 
sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 54.5% (95% CI: 23.4-83.3%), 95.9% (95% CI: 88.6-
99.2%), 66.7% (95% CI: 29.9-92.5%), and 93.4% (95% CI: 85.3-97.8%), respectively, for 
intermediate risk PC (ISUP 2-3); these values were 34.1% (95% CI: 20.5-49.9%), 91.1% (82.6-
96.4%), 68.2% (95% CI: 45.1-86.1%), and 71.3% (95% CI: 61.4-79.9%), respectively, for high risk 
PC (ISUP 4-5). 
Per nodal analysis of a total of 2,960 dissected lymph nodes revealed a sensitivity of 24.4% (95% CI: 
18.2-31.5%; 42 lymph nodes positively identified by 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT out of 172 histologically 
confirmed lymph nodes) and specificity of 99.5% (95% CI: 99.2-99.7%; 2764 negatively identified 
lymph nodes by 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT out of 2788 histologically confirmed negative lymph nodes). 
PPV per node was 75% (95% CI: 61.6-85.6%) and NPV per node was 95.5% (95% CI: 94.7-96.2%). 
Hope et al. (2021) conducted a prospective, multicenter, open-label single-arm phase 3 trial in men 
with intermediate or high-risk biopsy-proved PC. The purpose of the study was to assess the accuracy 
of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET imaging for the detection of pelvic nodal metastases compared with 
histopathology at time of radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection. The primary 
objective analyzed the sensitivity and specificity for the detection pelvic lymph nodes compared with 
histopathology on a per-patient basis using nodal region correlation. 
A total of 764 men (median age, IQR: 69 years, 63-73) underwent [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET imaging for 
primary staging, and 277 of 764 (36%) subsequently underwent prostatectomy with lymph node 
dissection (efficacy analysis cohort). Based on pathology reports, 75 of 277 patients (27%) had pelvic 
nodal metastasis. 
Each [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET study was read locally by board certified nuclear medicine physicians with 
access to all medical information to generate clinical reports. The [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET images and 
report were sent to the referring physician, and treatment decisions were allowed to be based on the 
PET results. Each imaging study of the primary efficacy population (patients who underwent radical 
prostatectomy) was read by 3 blinded independent central readers, not involved in study design and 
data acquisition. In total, 6 blinded readers were used from outside institutions and were required to 
complete a training on 30 cases from a previously published data set. For analysis, a centralized per-
region majority rule was generated by the local investigators. In patients who underwent 
prostatectomy after imaging, the surgical pathology report was obtained. The surgical approach was 
not standardized, and no resection template was required. The investigators coded the histopathology 
reference standard as negative or positive for pelvic lymph node metastasis. 
Of the 277 in the surgical cohort, median age was 67 (IQR 61-71).  49 (18%) men had intermediate 
risk PC and 225 (81%) had high-risk PC, with a median PSA of 11.1 ng/mL (IQR 6.5-18.0) and 
220/277 (79.4%) had an ISUP grade group ≥3. A total of 75 of 277 patients (27%) had regional pelvic

node metastasis found on pathology (pN1). The median (IQR) size of the largest positive lymph node 
on pathology per patient was 6 (3-10) mm. 
On a per-patient level, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET based on the 
majority reads were 0.40 (95% CI, 0.34-0.46), 0.95 (95% CI, 0.92-0.97), 0.75 (95% CI, 0.70-0.80), 
and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.76-0.85). 
In a post hoc retrospective analysis, they determined if PSA level, Gleason score, D’Amico risk, and 
node size were associated with the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET. 
Larger pelvic lymph node metastasis size (>10 mm) was associated with higher sensitivity of 
[68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET (0.59 (95% CI 0.41, 0.75) for the detection of pelvic nodal metastases. True-
positive and FN pelvic lymph node metastasis measured an average of 1.1 cm and 0.6 cm, respectively 
(p = .01). There was insufficient evidence to conclude that Gleason score, PSA level (categorized) and 
D’Amico risk were associated with sensitivity. 
The study did not meet the predefined threshold sensitivity of 0.65. 
2.6.5.2.2.  Impact on patient management – primary staging of PCa 
A summary of the data showing the impact of the 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET on PC management is provided in 
table below. 
In primary staging, 21% to 67% of patients were re-staged due to findings from 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT 
(Hruby et al 2018, Roach et al 2018, Basha et al 2019, Sonni et al 2020). In the four studies focused 
on primary staging of patients, the intended change in patient management ranged from 21% to 28% 
(Roach et al 2018, Hofman et al 2020) and implemented change in patient management in 12.6% to 
43% of patients (Sonni et al 2020, van Kalmthout et al 2020).

Fendler et al (2019) 
(Note: part of the data in this publication formed part of the UCLA data contribution to the FDA 
submitted application that was approved in December 2020 and also overlaps with Fendler et al 
(2020)).  
This was a prospective, multicenter, single-arm study, designed to assess the accuracy of 68Ga-PSMA-
11 PET imaging in localizing recurrent PC. Patients with biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer after radical 
surgical treatment and/or radiation therapy (RT) with increased levels of PSA (0.2 ng/mL or greater 
measured during 6-13 weeks post-surgery, or Nadir equal or greater than 2 ng/mL after RT).  
The key endpoint used to evaluate accuracy was the PPV of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET on a per-patient and 
per region basis. Lesions were validated by histopathologic analysis (primary endpoint) and a 
composite reference standard (secondary endpoint). A combination of histopathologic analysis, 
imaging (including CT, MRI, and/or bone scan), and PSA follow-up after local/focal therapy was used 
(in descending priority) as the composite reference standard. Other secondary endpoints included 
sensitivity (per-patient and per-region), detection rate (stratified by PSA levels and PSA doubling 
time), inter-reader agreement, and safety. Patients received an average of 5.1 (SD: 1.1) mCi of 68Ga-
PSMA-11 and 20 mg of furosemide at a mean (SD) 64 (13) min before the scan. Furosemide was given 
to 588 (93%) of 635 patients to minimize pelvic scatter artifacts. 
Image interpretation: 9 independent readers reviewed the 68Ga-PSMA-11 scans, with each patient scan 
read by 3 partially blinded readers. Data sets for reader interpretation included whole-body PET 
(attenuation corrected and non-corrected), whole-body post-contrast CT, or whole-body post-
gadolinium T1 and pelvic T2 MRI. Readers were provided recent PSA level and type of primary therapy 
(prostatectomy vs radiation therapy), but were blind to all other information. Presence of prostate 
cancer (positive vs negative) was recorded for 4 regions (prostate bed, pelvic nodes, extra-pelvic non-
bone, bone) and a total of 21 sub-regions. Pelvic lymph nodes (LN) were grouped in 7 sub-regions: R/L 
obturator, R/L external iliac, R/L internal iliac and other. Majority vote was used in cases of reader 
disagreement. 
Validation of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET findings was based on histology or follow-up (3-12 months): 
• 
PSMA-avid LNs (3-12 months follow-up): True positives (TP) were defined as the PSMA-avid LNs, 
which decrease in more than 30% in size on CT or MRI (treated patients), or increase by more 
than 20% in short axis diameter (min 3 mm change), OR if, in patients with solitary LN, PSA 
decreased by more than 50% after targeted treatment (i.e., external beam radiation) and LN do 
not change in size. False positive (FP) LNs were defined as LNs with >30% decrease in size on 
follow-up imaging without treatment at this site, or those not meeting the above criteria for TP or 
FP. 
• 
PET-positive Visceral lesions (3-12 months follow-up): as TP were regarded the lesions with >30% 
decrease in size on targeted therapy, or >20% increase in largest diameter. FP were the lesions 
with >30% decrease in size without systemic or targeted therapy at the site, or those not meeting 
the other TP or FP criteria. 
•  Bone lesions: TP were defined as those with corresponding sclerotic lesion on the CT portion of 
68Ga-PSMA-11 PET in the same location, or focal uptake observed on baseline bone scan, or on 
MRI, or if follow-up (12 months) CT, MRI, or bone scan show changes suggestive of bone lesion. FP 
was defined as all PET-positive bone lesions not meeting the criteria of TP. 
• 
Prostate bed lesions: TP was defined in the similar way as TP for visceral lesions (change in size) 
and LNs (change in PSA) but based on 12 months follow-up. FP was defined similar to those of LN 
and visceral lesions.

No true negative (TN) cases were defined. 
Statistics: The null hypothesis was that the true PPV is 0.50, whereas the alternative hypothesis was 
that the true PPV is at least 0.70.  
Enrollment was completed when 114 patients had biopsy and/or surgery follow-up, fulfilling protocol 
requirements for analysis of the per-patient–based primary endpoint (≥107 patients with biopsy 
and/or surgery follow-up, 90% power, 1-sided .01 significance level).  
Secondary endpoints were per-patient and per-region PPV confirmed by composite validation, per-
patient and per region sensitivity (SE) confirmed by histopathologic validation, per-patient detection 
rate stratified by PSA and PSA doubling time, inter-reader agreement, and safety. Detection rate was 
defined as proportion of patients with PSMA PET positive results, independent of the reference 
standard. Inter-reader agreement was determined by Fleiss’ κ and interpreted by criteria of Landis and 
Koch.  
Results: A total of 635 patients (median age, range: 69 years, 44-95) were included in the study who 
had biochemically recurrent PC after prostatectomy (n = 262, 41%), radiation therapy (n = 169, 
27%), or both (n = 204, 32%). Due to exclusion of 46 patients (as a result of location mismatch 
between PET and follow-up, or absence of PC on PET and histological examination), the efficacy 
analysis consisted of 223 patients with composite validation and 93 with histopathologic validation. 
Table 8: Baseline characteristics of the patients included (Fendler et al (2019)) 
On a per-patient basis, the PPV was 0.84 (95% CI: 0.75-0.90) by histopathologic validation (n = 87) 
and 0.92 (95% CI: 0.88-0.95) by the composite reference standard (n = 217). On a per-region basis, 
the PPV was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.76-0.91) by histopathologic validation (n = 90) and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.88-

0.95) by the composite reference standard (n = 249). Sensitivity by histopathologic validation was 
0.92 (95% CI, 0.84-0.96) on a per-patient basis, and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.82-0.95) on a per-region basis.

a PET positive. 
b PET negative. 
Overall, PET false-positive lesions were reported in few patients, most in the prostate or prostate bed 
(11 of 17 patients [65%]).  
Overall, the detection rate of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET (PSMA PET positive results, independent of the 
reference standard) was 75%. Detection rates significantly increased with PSA: 38% for < 0.5 ng/mL 
(n = 136), 57% for 0.5 to < 1.0 ng/mL (n = 79), 84% for 1.0 to < 2.0 ng/mL (n = 89), 86% for 2.0 to 
< 5.0 ng/mL (n = 158), and 97% for ≥ 5.0 ng/mL (n = 173), p < 0.001. No significant association was 
observed between detection rate and PSA doubling time or PSA nadir after prostatectomy.  
Eight PET-negative regions were confirmed positive on biopsy/surgery which were triggered by local 
reads based on faint focal uptake (n = 4, mean SUVmax= 5.1), CT/MRI lesions (n = 3; mean size, 0.9 
cm), or clinical suspicion (n = 1). 
PET-directed focal therapy led to a PSA decline of ≥ 50% in 31 of 39 (80%) patients (PET true-
positive).

2.6.5.4.  Evidence of efficacy – 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET for patient selection prior to PSMA-
targeted treatment 
PSMA-617-01 - VISION: An international, prospective, open label, multicenter, randomized 
Phase 3 study of 177Lu-PSMA-617 in the treatment of patients with progressive PSMA-
positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) 
Methods 
EMA/871509/2022 
Page 60/116 
 
 
 
  
 
[Study PSMA-617-01] was a Phase III, open-label, international, randomized study to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of 177Lu-PSMA-617 in patients with progressive PSMA-positive mCRPC, when 
administered in addition to Best supportive care/best standard of care (BSC/BSoC) as compared to 
BSC/BSoC alone.  
68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT was applied in the study with the aim to select study participants with PSMA-
positive PCa for the subsequent PSMA-targeted treatment with 177Lu-PSMA-617. 
Figure 7: Design of Study PSMA-617-01 
•  Study Participants  
Study participants were adult male patients who had a histological, pathological, and/or cytological 
confirmation of PC, progressive mCRPC (based on any one of the following as defined by the prostate 
cancer clinical trials working group 3 (PCWG3) criteria for clinical trial entry: serum PSA progression, 
soft-tissue progression, or progression of bone disease), had received at least 1 novel androgen axis 
drug (NAAD), were previously treated with at least 1 but no more than 2 prior taxane regimens and 
had a positive 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scan, as determined by the Sponsor’s central reader. 
Patients with previous treatment with any of the following within 6 months of randomization: 
strontium-89, samarium-153, rhenium-186, rhenium-188, radium-223, or hemi-body irradiation or 
previously treated with PSMA-targeted targeted radioligand therapy (RLT), or any systemic anti-cancer 
therapy (e.g. chemotherapy, immunotherapy or biological therapy) within 28 days prior to day of 
randomization were excluded.  
Baseline 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scan was done within 4 weeks (+ 2 weeks) prior to C1D1 but not 
within 6 days prior C1D1.  
The Sponsor’s central reader review of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scans determined eligibility for study 
inclusion based upon the following criteria: 
1. At least one 68Ga-PSMA-11 positive lesion. A PET/CT "positive" lesion was defined as having uptake 
greater than normal liver parenchyma, whereas a "negative" lesion were those tumours with uptake 
less than or equal to liver uptake. 
2. All lymph nodes that measured ≥ 2.5 cm in short axis had to be 68Ga-PSMA-11 positive.  
EMA/871509/2022 
Page 61/116 
 
 
 
  
 
   
 
3. All bone metastases with soft tissue component ≥ 1.0 cm in short axis had to be 68Ga-PSMA-11 
positive (patients with PSMA-negative osseous metastases without a soft tissue component, were not 
to be excluded). 
4. All solid organ metastases (e.g. lung, liver, adrenal glands, etc) ≥ 1.0 cm in short axis had to be 
68Ga-PSMA-11 positive. 
Only patients with at least one PSMA-positive lesion identified on PSMA-PET (i.e. criterion 1) and no 
negative lesions (i.e. criteria 2-4) were to be enrolled in the study, provided all other 
inclusion/exclusion criteria were met.  
Definition of PSMA scan-positive and PSMA scan-negative lesions were: 
•  A lesion was considered PSMA scan-positive if the uptake was greater than that observed in the 
normal liver by visual assessment. The lesion could be present in any organ system (e.g. lymph 
nodes, skeleton, lung, liver). There was no minimum size requirement for the lesion. 
•  A lesion was considered PSMA scan-negative if the activity was equal to or less than the normal 
liver by visual assessment. 
An independent imaging review took place. 
•  Treatments 
68Ga-PSMA-11 was used only once during screening to select patients for inclusion into the study, as a 
single i.v. injection over 10-20 seconds at a dose of 111-185 MBq (3-5 mCi) followed by a saline 
infusion. Low-dose CT transmission scans, in accordance with site’s standard of care, were performed 
in conjunction with the PET scans. The recommended anatomical coverage of the images was skull 
base to mid-thigh. Patients were imaged 50-100 minutes post 68Ga-PSMA-11 injection. At some 
centers, furosemide administration was the standard of care to promote elimination of any residual 
activity in the urinary system. 
Different processes were used in the preparation of 68Ga-PSMA-11 doses (one kit-based process and 
the others as an automatic module-based process) resulting in multiple formulations of 68Ga-PSMA-11 
prepared as ready-to-use solutions for injection in the USA, and in Europe. 
68Ga-PSMA-11 doses were supplied: 
•  Via kits from ANMI/Telix/Kyzeo  
•  Via IND held by institutions for 68Ga-PSMA-11 
•  Via IMPD held by institutions for 68Ga-PSMA-11 
As study (anti-neoplastic) treatments the patients received 177Lu-PSMA-617 in addition to BSC/BSoC or 
BSC/BSoC alone. 177Lu-PSMA-617 was administered as a slow i.v. injection at a dose of 7.4 GBq 
(±10%) once every 6 weeks (±1 week) for a maximum of 6 cycles. BSC/BSoC was prescribed by each 
patient’s physician and reflected standard interventions available to clinicians. BSC/BSoC regimen 
could be adapted. 
•  Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of PSMA-targeted treatment - 177Lu-
PSMA-617 added to BSC/BSoC compared with patients treated with BSC/BSoC alone in patients with 
progressive PSMA-positive mCRPC. No specific objective in relation to 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET was defined. 
It was assumed, that in case of positive outcome for 177Lu-PSMA-617 successful selection of patients 
by means of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET could be concluded. 
EMA/871509/2022 
Page 62/116 
 
 
 
  
 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy in the traditional sense (e.g., diagnostic performance, technical performance) of 68Ga-PSMA-11 
PET was not evaluated in this study. Positive outcome of the study was to be indirectly concluded as a 
successful patient selection by means of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET. Efficacy of 177Lu-PSMA-617 in the study 
was assessed based on the two alternate endpoints (primary endpoint), radiographic progression-free 
survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS) and compared 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC versus BSC/BSoC 
only. 
Exposure and safety data were collected directly for 68Ga-PSMA-11. 
A 68Ga-PSMA-11 treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) was defined as an AE occurring on the 
date of 68Ga-PSMA-11 dosing and/or up to 6 days after the date of 68Ga-PSMA-11 dosing as long as 
prior to the first dose of 177Lu-PSMA-617 for the investigational arm and Cycle 1 Day 1 for the best 
supportive/best standard of care-only arm. AEs reported as at least “possibly” related to 68Ga-PSMA-
11 after the 6-day reporting window but before the initiation of randomized treatment were also 68Ga-
PSMA-11 TEAEs. 
For patients who were dosed with 68Ga-PSMA-11 but were not randomized, AE monitoring continued 
up to and including 6 days after administration of 68Ga-PSMA-11. 
•  Sample size 
No sample size calculation in relation to the 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET has been done. 
•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Eligible patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive treatment with either 177Lu-PSMA-617 plus 
BSC/BSoC or BSC/BSoC alone. All patients underwent 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET. This was an open-label 
study. 
•  Statistical methods 
PSMA-11 Safety Analysis Set was used for the analyses of 68Ga-PSMA-11 data (exposure and safety) 
and included all patients who received a dose of 68Ga-PSMA-11, including those not randomised. 
Exposure and safety were summarized in descriptive manner.

Out of 1179 screened patients, 1003 underwent a 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scan (between 50-100 
minutes post-injection of a mean dose of 167 MBq (4.5 mCi), ranging from 92.8-287.5 MBq (2.5-7.8 
mCi)), and 831 patients, who fulfilled the scan interpretation criteria for eligibility (i.e., with 68Ga-
PSMA-11 PET/CT positive for eligibility) plus met all other inclusion/exclusion criteria and were 
randomized to Study PSMA-617-01.  
•  Recruitment 
First patient first visit occurred on 29-May-2018 with 1179 patients screened at 82 sites in 10 
countries. 
•  Conduct of the study 
In total 8 protocol amendments (Amendments 1.1, 1.2, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3), partly specific for 
individual countries were introduced. Relevant protocol Amendment for this application was the 
amendment 4.0 (08-Jul-2019): 
• 
Additional imaging analyses details were added for 68Ga-PSMA-11 scan data and the role of 
the Independent Review with reviewer variability assessment, as well as Quantitative Analysis was 
added to assess tumour burden and tumour characteristics with rPFS, OS, and other response 
measures, as determined by PCWG3 criteria. 
• 
Further clarification on the start and end timing for 68Ga-PSMA-11 TEAEs, 177Lu-PSMA-617 
TEAEs and BSC/BSoC dosing and intervention TEAEs. 
On 20-Sep-2020, a global clinical services provider was impacted by a cyber-security incident. This 
presented a potential GCP serious breach as certain safety alerts were not being sent to sites, e.g. 
Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (e-CSSRS) and cardiac safety alerts. Novartis conducted an 
independent impact assessment of the incident and concluded that this incident did not have an impact 
on patient safety, data integrity or data privacy. As a result, Novartis did not consider this incident a 
serious breach. 
•  Baseline data 
Overall, a total of 831 patients were randomized and included in the FAS population; 75.3% of whom 
were ≥ 65 years and 92.4% had an ECOG PS score of 0-1. The median time since initial diagnosis was 
7.4 years (range: 0.7, 28.9), almost all (96.3%) had at least one PC-related surgery (including 
biopsies), and 43.2% had received therapeutic surgery. The majority of patients (76.1%) also had at 
least one PC-related radiotherapy, and 79.1% had received more than 3 different regimens of prior 
systemic therapy. All patients had received prior taxane treatment and a prior AR pathway inhibitor. 
There was a low representation of patients who were Black or African American (6.6% of patients 
overall) or Asian (2.4%). However, this was balanced between the two treatment arms. Baseline 
demographic characteristics were similar across treatment groups. 
Baseline disease characteristics for the FAS population are presented in table below.

The study met its primary objective, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in rPFS 
based on BICR per PCWG3 criteria for patients receiving 177Lu-PSMA-617+BSC/BSoC compared to 
patients receiving BSC/BSoC only (PFS-FAS; stratified log-rank test p < 0.001, one-sided). There was 
an estimated 60% risk reduction of radiographic disease progression or death in the 177Lu-PSMA-
617+BSC/BSoC arm compared with the BSC/BSoC only arm (HR=0.40; 99.2% CI: 0.29, 0.57).  
Data on exposure and safety (AEs) for 68Ga-PSMA-11 are summarised in the safety part of this report. 
PSMA-617-01 Reviewer study 
Study PSMA-617-01 Reviewer Variability was an independent study of the Study PSMA-617-01 scans 
to assess the extent of inter-reader variability and intra-reader reproducibility of the 68Ga-PSMA-11 
PET/CT scans that were used in Study PSMA-617-01 (VISION study).  
Statistics 
This study was designed to test the null hypothesis that the Fleiss’ Kappa agreement rate between the 
three independent readers was ≤ 0.52 (Table below, Landis and Koch 1977). The power and sample 
size calculations were conducted using the KappaSize R package. Based on a 2-sided alpha = 0.05 
significance level, a sample size of 125 subjects would provide approximately 85% power, assuming 
the true Kappa agreement rate was approximately 0.70. Out of the 125 cases, 50 (40%) were 
exclusion cases, and 75 (60%) were inclusion cases, which deviated from the approximately 85% 
inclusion case distribution in VISION study. This was intended as, otherwise, the same distribution 
would have resulted in less than 20 exclusion cases in the study, which was considered inadequate to 
generate robust outcomes. The selected inclusion/exclusion prevalence distribution resulted in simple 
agreement rates of 0.77 and 0.85 for the Kappa agreement rates of 0.52 and approximately 0.70, 
respectively. In the Fleiss Kappa analysis, an overall average agreement rate (Pbar) was also 
calculated by taking the average of the agreement rate among the three readers for each of the 125 
cases. 
Table 12: Interpretation of Fleiss’ Kappa
Reading procedures 
Visual assessment was retrospectively performed in a blinded fashion by three independent and 
experienced readers on a subset of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scans and corresponding diagnostic CT/MRI 
scans from Study PSMA-617-01.  
During the blinded read, each reader was assigned a unique randomized read order and instructed to 
record his visual assessment of each image using the eCRF, resulting in the assessment of each case 
as either eligible (inclusion case) or ineligible (exclusion case) for enrollment. The criteria used for 
patient selection in VISION study (see above) were applied. 
EMA/871509/2022 
Page 69/116 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Accordingly, the following 5 questions were to be responded by each reader during image 
interpretation: 
1. Does the subject have at least one PSMA positive lesion (greater than the liver)? (Yes/No)  
2. Is there at least one lymph node ≥2.5 cm (25 mm) in short axis that is PSMA-negative? (Yes/No) 
3. Is there at least one bone lesion metastasis with soft tissue component ≥1.0 cm (10 mm) in short 
axis that is PSMA-negative? (Yes/No) 
4. Is there at least one solid organ metastasis ≥1 cm (10 mm) in short axis that is PSMA negative? 
(Yes/No) 
5. Does the subject meet the criteria: Is there at least one PSMA positive-lesion and no PSMA-negative 
lesion of evaluable size? (Yes/No) 
A total of 125 cases were randomly selected, including 75 cases from enrolled patients (inclusion 
cases) and 50 cases from patients who were excluded from enrollment based on the Study PSMA-617-
01 read criteria (exclusion cases). Twenty of the 125 [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scans (including 12 
inclusion and 8 exclusion cases) and corresponding diagnostic CT/MRI scans were randomly selected 
and recoded for repeat reads in preparation of the intra-reader reproducibility assessment. 
Results  
Overall inter-reader variability 
Among the 125 cases, the three independent readers completely agreed on the assessment of 96 
cases (77%), of which 76 (79%) were scored as inclusion cases and 20 (21%) were scored as 
exclusion cases. Disagreement was found in 29 cases (23%), with varying combination of concordance 
observed between the three readers. 
Of the 29 discordant cases, the readers differed in their assessment on lymph node in 6 cases, bone 
metastasis, liver, or cases with no positive lesion in 5 cases each. The remaining 9 cases included 
lesions in prostate and other locations. Some cases belonged to multiple categories of disagreement. 
Fleiss’ Kappa statistical analysis was performed to assess inter-reader variability (Fleiss 1971). The 
overall average agreement rate (Pbar) between all three readers was 0.85. The Kappa value was 0.60 
(95% CI, 0.50 to 0.70), indicating moderate to substantial agreement (Landis and Koch 1977). 
Notably, the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval observed (0.50) represents the midrange of 
moderate agreement (0.41-0.60), whereas the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval (0.70) 
represents the midrange of substantial agreement (0.61-0.80). 
In addition, an agreement rate of 88% was observed among inclusion cases, compared to 60% among 
exclusion cases. 
Pairwise inter-reader variability analysis 
Cohen’s Kappa statistical analysis was performed to assess the pairwise inter-reader agreement. The 
agreement rate of each pairwise analysis was 0.82, 0.88 and 0.84, and the corresponding Cohen’s 
Kappa was 0.54 (95% CI, 0.38-0.71), 0.67 (95% CI, 0.52-0.83) and 0.59 (95% CI, 0.43-0.75) 
respectively. The observed Cohen’s Kappa values represented moderate to substantial agreement 
between all three pairs of readers, consistent with the results of the Fleiss’ Kappa statistics in the 
overall inter-reader variability analysis. 
Intra-reader reproducibility analysis 
EMA/871509/2022 
Page 70/116 
 
 
 
  
 
Of the 125 cases, a randomly selected subset of 20 cases were recoded and read twice by all three 
readers. Cohen’s Kappa statistical analysis was performed to assess the agreement between the 
repeated reads for each reader. The agreement rate was 0.90, 0.90 and 0.95, and the corresponding 
Cohen’s Kappa was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.49-0.99), 0.76 (95% CI, 0.46-0.99) and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.67-
0.99) respectively. The observed Cohen’s Kappa values represented substantial to almost perfect 
agreement for all three readers (Landis and Koch 1977). 
Comparison of reader variability study read results and VISION eligibility read results 
The reader variability study read results from the three independent readers were compared to the 
VISION eligibility read results used to determine patient enrollment into the study. Agreement rate was 
defined as the percentage of actual inclusion cases in VISION out of the cases assessed as inclusion by 
each reader in the variability study. The agreement rate observed for each reader was 0.76, 0.80 and 
0.76 respectively (Table below)

PSMA-617-01 - Quantitative analysis of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET images 
Association between imaging data from quantitative PSMA imaging parameters at baseline [68Ga]Ga-
PSMA-11 PET/CT scans of patients who had received [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 and their clinical outcomes 
was assessed.  
Imaging data meeting quality requirements were analyzed. PSMA expression was quantified by 5 PET 
parameters: PSMA+ lesions by anatomical region, mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean), 
maximum SUV (SUVmax), PSMA+ tumor volume, and tumor load (PSMA+ tumor volume × SUVmean). 
These parameters were extracted from different anatomical regions for each patient, including bone, 
liver, lymph nodes and soft tissues. Imaging data for the whole body was represented by the 
combination of all segmented lesions. 
Association between PET parameters and radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), overall survival 
(OS), objective response rate (ORR), and prostate–specific antigen 50 (PSA50) response was 
assessed. 
Most patients (92.7%) had PSMA uptake in bone. In both the whole-body and regional analyses, 
statistically significant associations of PSMA PET parameters to clinical outcomes were observed. 
Higher whole-body SUVmean was associated with improved clinical outcomes; patients in the highest 
SUVmean quartile had a median rPFS and OS of 14.1 and 21.4 months, vs 5.8 and 14.5 months for 
those in the lowest quartile, respectively. Absence of PSMA+ lesions in bone, liver, and lymph node, 
and lower PSMA+ tumor load, were indicators of good prognosis.

2.6.5.6.  Clinical studies in special populations 
There were no studies performed in renal or hepatic impaired patients, or in children. The target 
population is older and elderly subjects, which were included in the clinical trials. Subgroup analyses 
per age for safety is described in the Clinical safety section. 
2.6.5.7.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Perera et al (2020) performed a meta-analysis of studies evaluating the utility of 68Ga-PSMA PET in the 
detection of metastatic disease in high-risk and advanced prostate cancer for primary (prior to 
EMA/871509/2022 
Page 82/116 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
definitive therapy) or secondary staging (biochemical recurrence following definitive therapy). The 
mean age from the collective studies ranged from 61-74 years. Across 37 studies that met the 
relevance criteria, 5 studies reported on the predictive ability of PSMA-PET imaging for primary staging 
purposes with respect to histology-proven disease. For these 5 studies, summary sensitivity and 
specificity were calculated as per-lesion and per-patient analyses: summary sensitivity of 75% and 
summary specificity of 99% (per-lesion analysis); and summary sensitivity 77% and summary 
specificity 97% (per-patient analysis). 
68Ga-PSMA PET improves detection of metastases with biochemical recurrence, particularly at low pre-
PET PSA levels of > 0.2 ng/ml (33%) and 0.2–0.5 ng/ml (45%). 68Ga-PSMA-PET produces favorable 
sensitivity and specificity profiles on meta-analysis of pooled data. This analysis highlighted different 
anatomic patterns of metastatic spread according to PSMA PET in the primary and biochemically 
recurrent settings. 
Hope et al (2019) performed a systematic review and meta-analysis involving 4149 prostate cancer 
patients (mean age range: 62-80 years) from 41 publications summarizing studies of staging or 
restaging with 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT or PET/MRI in patients with either localized or metastatic 
prostate cancer. They further determined the imaging test accuracy of the 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT or 
PET/MRI method using tissues samples obtained through biopsy or surgery as the reference standard. 
The meta-analysis of 68Ga-PSMA-11 at initial staging demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity of 0.74 
(95% CI: 0.51–0.89) and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.85–0.99), respectively, using nodal pathology at 
prostatectomy as a gold standard. At biochemical recurrence, the PPV was 0.99 (95% CI: 0.96–1.00). 
The detection rate was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.55–0.70), with a PSA of less than 2.0 and 0.94 (95% CI: 
0.91–0.96) with a PSA of more than 2.0. Doses and uptake times were in similar ranges across 
studies, with most studies using a dose of 120-230 MBq of 68Ga-PSMA-11 and an imaging time starting 
approximately 60 min after injection. 
Across studies of varying size, aim and design, high sensitivity and specificity were achieved for 68Ga-
PSMA-11 PET, suggesting that expanding experience is yielding consistent results among historical and 
more recent reads. 
Perera et al (2016) performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of reported predictors of positive 
68Ga-PSMA-11 PET and corresponding sensitivity and specificity profiles. The analysis included 1309 
patients with prostate cancer from 16 articles. The median age from the collective studies ranged from 
62-73 years. 
The overall percentage of positive 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET among patients was 40% (95% CI: 19–64%) for 
primary staging and 76% (95% CI: 66–85%) for BCR. Positive 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET scans for BCR 
patients increased with pre-PET PSA. For the PSA categories 0–0.2, 0.2–1, 1–2, and > 2 ng/ml, 42%, 
58%, 76%, and 95% scans, respectively, were positive. Shorter PSA doubling time increased 68Ga-
PSMA-11 PET positivity. On per-patient analysis, the summary sensitivity and specificity were both 
86%. On per lesion analysis, the summary sensitivity and specificity were 80% and 97%, respectively. 
In the setting of BCR prostate cancer, pre-PET PSA predicts the risk of positive 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET. 
Pooled data indicated favorable sensitivity and specificity profiles compared to choline-based PET 
imaging techniques.

2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
This is essentially a literature-based application. The Applicant addressed around 30 publications in the 
summary of clinical efficacy.  
EMA/871509/2022 
Page 85/116 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The updated indication targets 3 clinical situations: primary staging of patients with PCa prior to 
curative treatment, diagnosis of BCR and selection of patients with metastasized PCa prior to 
treatment with PSMA-based therapy.  
To support the efficacy claims, the Applicant has submitted two study reports describing own clinical 
data, both based on the same Phase III clinical study PSMA-617-01, and large number of published 
studies in BCR setting and in primary staging. Additionally, quantitative analysis of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET 
images has been provided. Use of literature data in this submission is acceptable. Overall, the amount 
of the data submitted, and the contents addressed, are acceptable.  
General requirement towards new diagnostic methodologies is that these are compared to the available 
alternatives e.g., in terms of diagnostic performance (Reference is made to the EMA guideline on 
diagnostic agents CPMP/EWP/1119/98/Rev. 1 and Appendix EMEA/CHMP/EWP/321180/2008). 
According to the updated indication wording, 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET is expected to be used as imaging 
prior to curative intent therapy in primary staging,  as an alternative to choline, and fluciclovine PET in 
the diagnosis of PCa recurrence in patients with BCR, and as a identification tool for PSMA-based 
therapy in patients with metastasized PCa. Respective comparative data of 68Ga-PSMA-11 against the 
other PET tracers have been provided.   
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The submitted clinical studies were designed as prospective or retrospective single, or multiple-site 
clinical studies, mostly with single treatment arm and not utilizing comparator. Standard of truth 
(SOT)/standard of reference in the studies in primary staging of PCa was mostly histopathology, which 
is a universal SOT and accepted. In the studies in BCR mostly composite SOT based on clinical follow-
up, findings in other imaging, histopathology, etc. was applied. Depending on the chosen criteria, 
composite SOTs are acceptable. 
Assessment of efficacy was based on evaluating the following aspects: diagnostic performance 
(sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy in primary staging, sensitivity and PPV in BCR 
diagnostics), technical performance (inter-reader variability, semi-quantitative measurements, e.g., 
SUVmax), and impact on patient management. These are acceptable and in line with the requirements 
of relevant guideline.  
Limitations detected are as follows: all but 3 studies (Fendler et al, Hofman et al and Hope et al) were 
planned as exploratory studies, validation of impact on patient management did not take place in 
majority of the studies, methodology of assessment of inter-reader variability in the own study 
(VISION) is deficient, impact on clinical outcomes has not been evaluated, clinical value of the data 
from VISION study is limited (diagnostic performance not evaluated, quantitative analysis provides 
exploratory, partly contradictory, evidence).  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Dose finding 
No dedicated dose-response/dose-finding studies were conducted, and the proposed dosing regimen is 
based on the experience from the majority of the published studies in patients with PCa and the joint 
recommendations of the EANM and SNMMI procedure guideline for prostate cancer imaging (Fendler et 
al 2017). This approach is acceptable. 
EMA/871509/2022 
Page 86/116 
 
 
 
  
 
 
The proposed dose of 68Ga-PSMA-11 is 1.8-2.2 MBq/kg of body weight (0.049-0.059 mCi/kg), with a 
minimum dose of 111 MBq (3 mCi) and up to a maximum dose of 259 MBq (7 mCi), administered by 
intravenous injection. The recommended imaging time is at 60 min post injection, with a range of 50 
to 100 min post injection. 
A standard and maximum recommended activities (150 MBq and 259 MBq) of 68Ga-PSMA-11 result in 
the effective doses (2.37-3.87 mSv and 6.68 mSv) which are lower than those of other PET agents 
used for prostate cancer imaging and well within the effective dose from a diagnostic CT. Additionally, 
the maximum 25 µg mass dose is in the microdose range, as it is ≤ 100 μg and ≤ 1/100th of the 
nonclinical NOAEL (FDA 2018, EMA 2018). Proposed timing of PET scan (50-100 min after tracer 
injection) is also in line with the data in the literature.  
The minimum and maximum total doses defined correspond to the weight range of 50.5 kg to 144 kg 
when calculated for the 1.8-2.2 MBq/kg dosing. Depending on the actual time from production of 
68GaCl3 required for labelling of gozetotide, large amount of the labelled solution (and respectively 
higher amount of mass) may be required to achieve adequate activity at the time of injection. Upper 
limit for the injected volume is, however specified in the SmPC (section 12), that should prevent 
excessive exposure to gozetotide. 
The proposed dose regimen was tested in the study conducted by the Applicant (VISION) and no major 
safety occurrences have been observed (see clinical safety). The proposed dosing is, thus, acceptable.     
Diagnostic performance and impact on patient management - primary staging of PCa 
The Applicant has submitted 9 published studies reporting diagnostic performance of 68Ga-PSMA-11 
PET in patients with confirmed primary PCa. 
The population included in these studies represented the patients with biopsy-confirmed predominantly 
high-risk PCa scheduled for undergoing primary staging with subsequent curative intent treatment 
(prostatectomy with or without PLND/ePLND or radiotherapy). This is a typical population that is 
subjected to primary staging prior to the start of treatment and the key target of staging is to find out 
whether the cancer has spread to LN, and/or metastasised to other systems/organs and distant 
locations.  
Hofman et al. conducted a prospective controlled multicentre confirmatory study. The primary outcome 
was accuracy of the 68Ga-PSMA PET compared to conventional imaging (CT and bone scan) in 
identifying either pelvic nodal or distant metastatic disease in the patients with biopsy-confirmed PCa. 
Statistical planning and sample size calculation appear acceptable. The study was powered for 
superiority. Standard of reference was defined based on histopathology or bone scan (hard criteria), or 
large number of soft criteria (11 in total).  
The study showed high levels of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy in detection of pelvic nodal and 
distant metastases with 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET. Compared to conventional imaging with CT and bone 
scanning, PSMA PET-CT showed significantly greater accuracy and sensitivity and numerically higher 
specificity in patient-level analysis. The difference in the accuracy was driven by better sensitivity, 
particularly in detection of pelvic LN metastases. 
Additionally, 68Ga-PSMA PET-CT had fewer equivocal results and lead to lower radiation exposure than 
CT and bone scan. Impact on patient management in almost third of the population was reported. 
Whether or not the latter lead to positive clinical outcome is difficult to judge, as validation was 
missing/no survival analyses was done. 
EMA/871509/2022 
Page 87/116 
 
 
 
  
 
 
The key limitation of this study is the use of histopathology (reliable SOT) in only 18 of 300 patients. 
In the remaining patients the combination of soft criteria (composite SOT) was applied. The latter 
creates uncertainty in the study outcomes as some of the criteria raise concerns in terms of objectivity 
or robustness. The criteria, such as, typical appearance of multi-focal metastatic disease, appearance 
of a metastatic lesion on an imaging modality other than the one performed as the index scan and 
localised treatment for metastasis are not regarded sufficiently objective, or robust to be part of the 
SOT definition. Especially if used in combination with each other. As, concretely which combinations of 
soft criteria lead to which results have not been presented, the extent of possible bias on study results 
from these questionable criteria is difficult to assess.  
Further, validation of the findings on first-line imaging (by means of SOT or composite SOT) took place 
after 6 months follow-up. This time period might have been too short, particularly for adequate 
assessment of the hard SOT criterion based on bone scan. 
Also, either the comparator, or the 68Ga-PSMA PET (repeated imaging) itself was applied for 
confirmation of the diagnosis which is against the recommendations of the EMA guideline on diagnostic 
agents.  
Evaluation of the images took place in an open-label manner, which may be less appreciated from 
methodological point of view, but probably reflects the clinical situation more realistically. 
Overall, the study provided supportive evidence despite the above mentioned shortcomings 
questioning the robustness of the data.  
Additional evidence was presented from the remaining studies Yaxley et al. and van Kalmthout et al. 
which appear more robust. Strengths of these studies are the use of histopathology as SOT and 
acceptable blinded reading procedures. In these studies, diagnostic performance of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET 
was quite similar and showed rather low levels of sensitivity and high degree of specificity, with more 
variable moderate PPV and NPV (sensitivity: 38.2% and 41.5%, specificity; 93.5% and 90.9%, PPV: 
67.7% and 77.3%, and NPV: 80.8% and 67.6%). These data are not quite consistent with the 
literature data (Mottet et al., Hofman et al.), which report higher levels of sensitivity.  
The large study conducted by Hope et al., did not reach primary objective. However, diagnostic 
performance of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET was similar to that reported in van Kalmthout et al., and Yaxley et 
al, with sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 0.40 (95% CI, 0.34-0.46), 0.95 (95% CI, 0.92-0.97), 
0.75 (95% CI, 0.70-0.80), and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.76-0.85) and the study can be considered supportive.  
Overall, none of the studies provided can be considered pivotal, but proof of diagnostic 
efficacy/diagnostic performance in the primary staging is based on the totality of the data. It is 
assumed, that the study conducted by van Kalmthout et al., has evaluated diagnostic performance of 
68Ga-PSMA-11 PET most accurately, since this was a prospective study, that utilized strong SOT, 
adequate reading procedures and the population consisted of high-risk PCa patients in the majority 
(90%).  
The impact of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET (utilized for primary staging) on patient management was evaluated 
in 4 clinical studies Hofman et al., van Kalmthout et al., Roach et al., and Sonni et al.,). Notably, Sonni 
et al., is considered a flawed study, as 77% of follow-up information was collected from electronic 
charts and the patients themselves leading to study bias. Actual change in treatment took place in 
12.6% - 43% of the cases and intended change in treatment was described in 21-28% of the cases.  
Concerns have been raised on use of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET for primary staging of PCa (Parker et al., 
2020 – recommendations of European Society of Medical oncology – ESMO, Cornford P, et al.2020), as 
68Ga-PSMA-11 PET in this setting has not been shown to improve clinical outcomes and the evidence 
is not adequate to make a recommendation concerning its use. In the recommendations from ESMO it 
EMA/871509/2022 
Page 88/116 
 
 
 
  
 
is stated: “Patients with localized disease on routine imaging should not be denied radical local 
treatment solely because metastatic lesions are identified on novel imaging techniques.” Cornford P, et 
al. state that “the rapid introduction of PSMA PET/CT into clinical pathways without robust data that 
compare outcomes with standard imaging might alter the paradigm of patient management from data-
driven protocols to one driven by tentative and exploratory data […]. The concern is that greater 
numbers of men will be subjected to life-long ADT, particularly when PSMA PET/CT is applied to a 
standard high-risk definition […] without evidence of a survival benefit. Authors have reported a 
change in management […] but although it is clear this will happen we do not have any outcome data 
for this new subgroup to justify these choices. […] prospective studies on survival outcomes when 
using PSMA PET for staging need to be conducted.” These authors also recommend not to base 
treatment decisions on direct evidence of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET in this setting. In order to address the 
raised concerns, the respective information and the warning, that findings on 68Ga-Locametz PET 
should always be interpreted in conjunction with and be confirmed by other diagnostic methods, before 
subsequent change in patient management is initiated, was added in section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
Notably, studies in primary staging included patients with intermediate and high-risk PCa, which high-
risk patients constituting majority of the studied populations. Intermediate and high-risk PCa 
population are not regarded similar in terms of expected 68Ga-PSMA-11 efficacy/accuracy. No 
separate subgroup analysis of efficacy in the patients with intermediate-risk PCa was possible. 
Therefore, and also in light of the lack of data on long-term clinical outcomes, the indication was 
restricted to high-risk PCa patients in the primary staging setting.   
Overall, the totality of the evidence presented is considered sufficient to substantiate the use of 68Ga-
Locametz in the indication of primary staging in the patients with high-risk PCa with limitations of 
available data adequately reflected in the SmPC.  
Diagnostic performance and impact on patient management - BCR 
In total 5 clinical studies from literature were submitted to provide data on diagnostic performance of 
68Ga-PSMA-11 PET in the patients with BCR. Impact on patient management/clinical outcome was 
evaluated in own clinical study (VISION) and additionally presented through data in the literature. 
Key evidence of diagnostic performance of 68Ga-PSMA-11-PET can be derived from Fendler et al. This 
was a large confirmatory study in the patients with confirmed prostate cancer and BCR. The study 
methodology (especially clearly defined criteria for TP and FP lesion definition) is considered 
acceptable. True negative cases were not defined. This is plausible at subject level analyses (as all 
patients would be expected to have cancer). However, at region/sub-region and lesion level analyses 
true negative cases could have been identified and specificity (and NPV) could have been calculated.  
Efficacy analysis set excluded 46 patients “based on PET vs follow-up location mismatch (on a sub-
region basis) or absence of prostate cancer both on PET and histopathologic analysis”). Scientific 
rationale behind and relevance of this decision is not fully clear. Bias on study outcomes cannot be 
excluded.  
A combination of histopathologic analysis, imaging (including CT, MRI, and/or bone scan), and PSA 
follow-up after local/focal therapy was used (in descending priority) as the composite reference 
standard. This is an acceptable approach in this patient population. 
The study showed good levels of diagnostic performance (PPV) at patient and region analyses as 
compared to histopathology (84% each) and the composite SOT (92% each). Lower bound of 95% CIs 
were consistently above the pre-specified value of 0.70. Thus, the primary endpoint was met. 
EMA/871509/2022 
Page 89/116 
 
 
 
  
 
Also, the reported sensitivities reached clinically relevant levels of 92% and 90% at patient and region 
levels.  
Detection rate for 68Ga-PSMA-11-avid lesions was 75% and showed significant relationship with PSA 
levels with higher detection rates observed in the patients with higher PSA. This is a common finding 
also with other imaging modalities.   
Overall, this study was a large, well-designed and conducted positive confirmatory study in typical 
population with BCR. It cannot be excluded, that the patients removed from efficacy analysis might 
have impacted assessments of diagnostic efficacy. Therefore, there is some uncertainty around the 
size of the effects observed, which reached clinically relevant levels. Nonetheless, the study is 
regarded as supportive. 
Ceci et al., conducted a mid-sized prospectively planned study in the patients with persisting PSA after 
RP, first time BCR without salvage therapy and BCR after salvage therapies. Acceptable composite SOT 
(clinical follow-up) was utilized. Overall detection rate of lesions was 53.6% (95% CI 48.1%–59.1%), 
which is rather low, given that all patients are considered to have cancer in the presence of PSA. On 
the other hand, patients displayed low levels of PSA, that could have impacted rather poor detection 
rates.  
PET-positive patients had higher mean PSA values compared to those in PET-negative patients, which 
is not unexpected and is in line with other findings in the literature. 
Comparison to other imaging methods (choline PET/CT, pelvic multiparametric (mp)-MRI and bone 
scintigraphy) showed that 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT was positive in 82% of cases, in which the correlative 
imaging also detected lesions. Whereas only 15% (22/147 cases) of the cases with positive 68Ga-
PSMA PET had positive findings in other imaging. These findings suggests that 68Ga-PSMA-PET is more 
sensitive in detecting lesions in BCR setting than other imaging techniques. However, the detected 
differences were not validated, and presence of false positive cases cannot be excluded, which creates 
some uncertainty.  
Deandreis et al. conducted an observational study with open-label reading procedures in a single 
centre, in a specific population of the patients with HSPC and low levels of PSA. Subgroups of patients 
with either persistent or recurrent PSA (BCP and BCR) were investigated. In principle, these subgroups 
including the low levels of PSA, were roughly similar to those presented in Ceci et al. Overall, detection 
(positivity) rate of lesions was also low (39.9%), with lesions mostly detected in pelvic area (23%) 
rather than in distant locations (extra pelvic lymph nodes, bone or visceral - 16.6%). The authors 
explained the low detection rates with the challenging study population composed exclusively by HSPC 
patients, ADT-free, presenting with low PSA levels and eligible for salvage therapy. Majority of the 
patients were with early recurrence and low burden of the disease (oligometastatic disease).  
Most importantly, part of the PET-positive findings could be validated in this study (via histopathology 
in 17 cases or follow-up in 48 cases). All these cases were confirmed as true positive. These findings 
are regarded relevant in support of the proposed indication in the BCR setting. 
Changes in the treatment were reported in 34.5% of patients overall, which suggests considerable 
impact. 
Study by Hamed et al., reported high levels of lesion detection and sensitivity (87.8% and 98.8%) with 
68Ga-PSMA-11 PET in the patients with rising PSA after definitive therapy (prostatectomy and/or 
radiation therapy). Interestingly, the authors also calculated specificity based on follow-up information 
(e.g. negative imaging after 1 year), which cannot be fully understood, as at patient level no true 
negative findings would be expected in this population. Therefore, specificity and accuracy values 
which were calculated by the authors are disregarded in this assessment. 
EMA/871509/2022

There is a lack of clarity in regard to the chosen SOT in the Lawhn-Heath et al. and the data are 
difficult to interpret. 
To summarize, the evidence provided by the Applicant in the indication of BCR includes one well-
designed study by Fendler et al., and several exploratory studies, which all display limitations, one of 
them being inconsistency of diagnostic performance across the studies. Although data on diagnostic 
performance are variable, this may be explained with variable patient population, study designs and 
imaging procedures conducted. While more consistency in study outcomes would have been preferred, 
the data can be accepted as sufficient supportive evidence to substantiate use of 68Ga-Locametz in 
diagnostics of the PCa recurrence in patients with BCR.  
Efficacy in PSMA-positive lesion detection – selection of patients for PSMA-targeted therapy 
The Applicant claims that VISION study offers proof of clinical impact on patient outcome, as the study 
showed efficacy of the PSMA-based treatment (i.e., 177Lu-PSMA-617) in the patients selected with 
68Ga-PSMA-11 PET. This statement is not fully supported, as information regarding potential 
treatment of scan-negative patients was missing (as such patients were excluded). The diagnostic 
performance can be affected by the size of malignant lymph nodes leading to false negatives (as 
shown by histological examinations in primary staging), so that these patients would have missed 
potentially effective treatment. However, it is agreed that patients with a positive scan were good 
candidates for 177Lu-PSMA-617 treatment, and the evidence for 177Lu-PSMA-617 treatment is built 
upon a positive Ga-scan and Ga-PSMA-11 can be used to confirm that there is at least one lesion that 
would be reached by PSMA-targeted therapy.  
Quantitative testing analyses that were conducted to evaluate inter-dependencies between degree of 
PSMA uptake and response to 177Lu-PSMA-617 treatment produced partly discrepant results, which are 
difficult to interpret. Furthermore, the inter/intra-reader variability study has its limitations (see 
below).      
However, data collected in the diagnostics of PCa are considered sufficient to support this indication. 
There is sufficient evidence showing the ability of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET to detect PSMA-positive lesions 
to recommend its use for patient selection for PSMA-targeted therapy with appropriate warnings in the 
SmPC (section 4.4) that 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET is recommended to be used in conjunction with other 
diagnostic methods, including histopathology.  
Notably, the targeted indication is broad and is not restricted to the compounds containing 177Lu, or 
PSMA-11/PSMA-617 ligands. Recently published expert opinion (Fanti et al., 2022) is that PSMA 
PET/CT tracers are not equivalent and diagnostic efficacy cannot be extrapolated across different 
tracers. It is assumed, that the same applies to the tracers used for PSMA-based therapy. Since the 
submitted evidence is currently limited to the VISION study and 177Lu-PSMA-617, this limitation has 
been reflected in the indication by restricting to the population similar to the one studied in VISION 
study. Furthermore, section 4.4 of the SmPC informs that experience of patient selection is limited to 
treatment with 177Lu-PSMA-617. 
Reviewer variability 
Inter-reader and intra-reader variabilities are relevant parameters, as these suggest how reliable and 
reproducible assessments of the tested diagnostic tool are. For 68Ga-PSMA PET data from VISION 
study and those from published literature have been presented.  
EMA/871509/2022 
Page 91/116 
 
 
 
  
 
The study conducted by the Applicant failed to meet the primary endpoint. Moderate to high levels of 
inter and intra-reader agreement were observed. However, these data are questioned, and the study 
cannot be accepted as a supportive (even as exploratory) evidence. The reason is that the readers 
were asked to focus on PET-negative lesions primarily (notably, clinical reality requires detection of 
PET-positive lesions at first place) and detection of only one PET-positive lesion was sufficient to qualify 
an image as PSMA-positive. Features like number of lesions, location, size, etc., i.e., parameters 
relevant for e.g., monitoring of disease progression/treatment effects, were not evaluated. Detection of 
at least one PET-positive lesion in a patient with BCR and high levels of PSA is not regarded a 
challenging task, that would be sensitive enough to reliably detect differences in the reads (if such 
were present). Given the above, good agreement across the readers in this study is not considered of 
value, even as exploratory evidence.  
Inter-reader variability was evaluated in a number of published studies and agreements ranged 
between good and almost excellent across the readers. Notably, these studies showed good level of 
inter-reader agreement when analysis was done by location and type of lesion. Bone metastases were 
detected with less inter-reader variability and visceral metastases led to lower level of agreement. 
Most importantly, the data were collected in primary staging and the recurrent PCa setting. Few 
studies specifically included images with different known pitfalls, typically leading to image 
misinterpretations. These data are overall encouraging and supportive for all three indications. Good 
agreement is suggestive of reproducibility of the image reads and reliability of the diagnostic method. 
Important point to be emphasised is, that the readings were performed by highly experienced 
specialists, who had undergone special training to read 68Ga-PSMA PET images and who partially 
followed pre-defined image interpretation rules/recommendations. In order to limit readers’ mistakes 
the warning that only doctors with special training in 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET should conduct analysis of 
68Ga-Locametz PET images, has been included in the SmPC section 4.4. Additionally, description of 
most relevant concomitant conditions/clinical situations, which may lead to misinterpretation of the 
images has been added in section 4.4 of the SmPC, in order to adequately inform the doctors. 
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
From the submitted data it can be concluded, that 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT may contribute to the 
diagnostics of PCa during primary staging and diagnosis of PCa recurrence in patients with BCR, as well 
as act as a screening tool for patient selection for PSMA-targeted treatment. The initially applied 
indication was too broad and insufficiently substantiated by the submitted evidence, i.e. identification 
of PSMA positive lesions by PET in adult patients with prostate cancer. During the assessment 
procedure, the wording was revised based on the submitted evidence to reflect three distinct clinical 
settings for the indication of Locametz:  
- Primary staging of patients with high-risk PCa prior to primary curative therapy, 
- Suspected PCa recurrence in patients with increasing levels of serum PSA after primary curative 
therapy, 
- Identification of patients with PSMA-positive progressive mCRPC for whom PSMA-targeted therapy is 
indicated. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
The primary source of safety data is Study PSMA-617-01 in which 1003 patients with mCRPC 
underwent a 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/computed tomography (CT) scan. This study is the largest source of 
EMA/871509/2022

solicited, prospectively collected safety data for the compound. The study is ongoing and the safety 
data for this study were presented up to a cut-off date of 27-Jan-2021.  
Articles with potential supportive safety information were identified from the scientific literature 
database Medline up to a cut-off date of 20-Feb-2021. The largest 5 articles reporting the safety of 
68Ga PSMA 11 had data in over 3000 patients and are briefly summarized.  
68Ga-PSMA-11 is intended for single-use administration and long-term safety has not been specifically 
studied. 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
PSMA-617-01 study (VISION): 
Patients (N=1003) received a mean (standard deviation) activity injected-decay corrected dose of 
167.1 (23.1) MBq and 2.0 (0.4) MBq/kg as a single i.v. injection. A dose of > 185 MBq was 
administered in 149 patients and was separately evaluated on safety, as this activity exceeded the 
recommended dose in the study. 
Published studies: 
More than 3000 patients with PCa received mean single doses of 150 to 227 MBq (4.05 to 6.14 mCi) 
(range 66-400 MBq) of 68Ga-PSMA-11 in the published studies.

2.6.8.2.  Adverse events 
PSMA-617-01 study (VISION): 
AEs in connection with 68Ga-PSMA-11 were collected within the timeframe of 6 days after PET 
procedure. To avoid interferences, patients were not to receive radiotherapy within 6 days prior to or 
after administration of 68Ga-PSMA-11. Other concomitant treatments were continued without a break.    
Very few patients (29/1003; 2.9%) received radiotherapy within 6 days prior to or during 68Ga PSMA-
11 administration and nearly half (475/1003; 47.4%) of the patients had other imaging procedures 
within 6 days prior to or after 68Ga-PSMA-11 administration.  
Causal relationship of AEs specifically to 68Ga-PSMA-11 administration was not collected.  
The most frequently reported TEAEs (in at least 0.5% patients overall) in the PSMA-11 Safety Analysis 
Set (6-days time-period) presented by preferred term (PT) were fatigue (1.2%), asthenia (0.9%), back 
pain (0.8%), nausea (0.8%), anaemia (0.7%), lymphopenia (0.6%), oedema peripheral (0.6%), 
constipation, decreased appetite and vomiting (0.5% each).  
To enable a closer comparison of AE data from Study PSMA-617-01 with the supportive data sources, 
an analysis of TEAEs was performed limiting the time window to the day of or the day after 68Ga-
EMA/871509/2022

PSMA-11 injection. Within this shorter time window 20 patients (2.0%) had TEAEs, all events were 
reported in less than 0.5% of patients, were of Grade 1-2 severity except for 1 Grade 3 (fatigue) and 1 
Grade 5 (SDH) event.

None of these SAEs occurred on the day or the day after 68Ga-PSMA-11 injection, except for SDH. 
None of these SAEs were causally related to 68Ga-PSMA-11. 
Overall, SAEs were reported for 16 (1.6%) patients. All SAEs were reported in a single patient, except 
for spinal cord compression reported in 2 patients. Three SAEs (cardio-respiratory arrest, left 
ventricular dysfunction and subdural haemorrhage) had fatal outcomes as discussed further. None of 
the SAEs including the fatal events were considered to be causally related to study drug except for one 
event of Grade 3 hyponatremia that resolved in 5 days. According to the detailed information reported 
to the safety database, this SAE of hyponatremia with onset 7 days after administration of 68Ga-PSMA-
11 was attributed to enzalutamide and not to 68Ga-PSMA-11.

Deaths 
In Study PSMA-617-01, 3 deaths were reported during the treatment-emergent period (from dosing 
and up to 6 following days).  
• 
A 72-year-old male presented to the emergency department (ED) after being found 
unresponsive two days after 68Ga-PSMA-11 administration. He died the next night following 
cardiopulmonary arrest. The patient was known to have had a pulmonary embolism previously and 
concomitant medications included warfarin, as well as antidiabetics (metformin and glipizide). The 
Investigator assessed the event of cardiopulmonary arrest as probably not related to 68Ga-PSMA-11 or 
BSoC (leuprorelin). 
• 
A 64-year-old patient was hospitalised one day after the 68Ga-PSMA-11 administration, after 
being found unresponsive. A computed tomography (CT) scan of head showed massive right subdural 
hematoma (SDH) and significant subfalcine herniation. Despite intensive care treatment, he died the 
same day due to SDH. No head trauma was known, but the patient had reported intermittent 
headaches. Gosrelin had last been administered 100 days previously. Other concomitant medication 
included rosuvastatin for hypercholesterolemia. The Investigator assessed the SDH as definitely not 
related to 68Ga-PSMA-11. 
• 
A 76-year-old patient was hospitalised due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction, secondary to 
known coronary ischaemia and hypertension, 4 days after 68Ga-PSMA-11 administration. He was 
assessed as having a hypertensive crisis and pulmonary oedema, treated with unspecified beta 
blockers and furosemide, and discharged with a plan for further follow-up. Seven days following event 
onset he passed away at home. The Investigator assessed the fatal event of left ventricular 
dysfunction as definitely not related to 68Ga-PSMA-11. 
The investigator did not attribute any of these fatal events to the study. Review of the cases do not 
reveal any evidence that would establish causal relationship to 68Ga-PSMA-11. 
No deaths were reported in any of the supportive safety publications. 
Other significant AEs 
Designated medical events: acute kidney injury in 1 patient and bicytopenia in a second patient were 
reported. Both were Grade 3 events, unrelated to 68Ga-PSMA-11. 
Safety topics of interest: The treatment-emergent safety topics of interest for the radioactive 
diagnostic agent 68Ga-PSMA-11 included the potential risk of hypersensitivity as well as routine safety 
assessments of QT prolongation and hepatotoxicity. A safety topic such as AESI is a grouping of AEs 
that are of scientific and medical interest, and may represent a potential concern for 68Ga-PSMA-11. 
These groupings were defined using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terms, 
Standard MedDRA Queries (SMQs), Higher Level Group Terms (HLGTs), Higher Level Terms (HLT) and 
PTs. Customized SMQs (Novartis MedDRA Query [NMQ]) were also used. A NMQ is a customized group 
of search terms which defines a medical concept for which there is no official SMQ available or the 
available SMQ does not completely fit the need. It may include a combination of single terms and/or an 
existing SMQ, narrow or broad. The groups defined are shown in table below.

The AESI groups were reported at low incidences in the following order: fatigue (2.2%), 
myelosuppression (1.7%), nausea and vomiting (1.3%), dry mouth (0.4%), and renal effects (0.1%). 
Review of the standard safety topics of hepatotoxicity (incidence of 0.6%) and QTc prolongation 
(incidence of 0.1%) did not reveal concern for any relationship with 68Ga-PSMA-11. 
The topic of hypersensitivity was a broad MedDRA search for allergic events but also of signs and 
symptoms that may be suggestive of hypersensitivity. There were no 68Ga-PSMA-11 AEs of 
hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions, and the retrieved event of rash was a single low-grade 
event that did not occur on the same day as administration of 68Ga-PSMA-11, or the following day, and 
is unlikely to present a sign of hypersensitivity to the compound. 
2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
Laboratory values were not collected. 
2.6.8.5.  Safety in special populations 
TEAE, Serious TEAE, Grade 3/4/5 TEAE, Drug-related TEAE, Serious drug-related TEAE, Drug-related 
grade 3/4/5 TEAE, and Fatal TEAE were compared in various subgroups of patients to identify possible 
intrinsic and extrinsic factor effects. 
TEAEs were analysed with respect to subgroups of the following intrinsic factors: 
•  Age (< 65; ≥ 65-<75; ≥75 years) 
• 
• 
eGFR level (normal vs. mild impairment vs. moderate impairment).  
Proteinuria (≥100mg/dl, “Positive”, “2+”, “3+” and “4+” vs. all others).  
EMA/871509/2022

• 
• 
• 
eGFR and proteinuria (eGFR <90 mL/min and proteinuria (≥100mg/dl  “Positive”, “2+”,“3+” 
and “4+” ) vs. (eGFR ≥90 mL/min ULN or proteinuria not in (≥100mg/dl, “Positive”, “2+” and 
“3+”, “4+”)).  
Patients with renal impairment based on medical history (Yes vs No) 
Presence of liver metastases at screening (based on CRF data) (Yes vs. No), defined as at least 
one target and/or non-target liver lesion on or before the date of 68Ga-PSMA11 
administration- and within 28 days of date of 68Ga-PSMA11 administration as captured on 
either the target or non-target lesion CRF pages. 
•  Screening liver parameters (elevated (ALT or AST >ULN) and BILI > ULN vs. non-elevated 
(ALT and AST ≤ULN) or BILI ≤ ULN). 
• 
Patients with hepatic impairment based on medical history (Yes vs No) 
Effect of elevated screening liver parameters and of hepatic impairment based on medical history on 
incidence of TEAEs could not be evaluated as there were no such patients included in the study.  
Results of the remaining subgroup analyses did not suggest that any of the subgroups influenced the 
likelihood or severity of AEs. Exposure to 68Ga-PSMA-11 was similar between patients in all the intrinsic 
factor subgroups with no meaningful difference between them.

Safety Analysis Set) 
Incidence of TEAEs were analysed with respect to subgroups of the below extrinsic factors: 
•  Region (North America vs. Europe) 
• 
Imaging procedures within 6 days prior to or after 68Ga-PSMA-11 administration (Yes vs No)  
•  Radiotherapy within 6 days prior to or after 68Ga-PSMA-11 administration (Yes vs No)  
•  BSC/BSoC within 6 days prior to or after 68Ga-PSMA-11 administration (Yes vs No)  
•  NAADs within 6 days prior to or after 68Ga-PSMA-11 administration (Yes vs No)  
•  Dose (“Dose ≤ 185 MBq ”, “Dose > 185 MBq ”) 
Incidence of TEAEs (15.2% vs. 10.9%) and drug-related TEAEs (8% vs. 4.5%) was numerically higher 
in patients from Europe (N=289) compared to those in North America (N=714). Similar incidences 
EMA/871509/2022

were reported also in the subgroups with (N=290) vs without (N=713) NAADs within 6 days to or after 
68Ga-PSMA-11 administration (TEAEs: 14.8% vs. 11.1% and drug-related TEAEs: 8.6% vs. 4.2%, 
respectively). 
Large differences between the incidences of TEAEs (partly including all types of TEAEs) were reported 
in the subgroups with and without radiotherapy or BSC/BSoC within 6 days prior to or after 68Ga-
PSMA-11 administration for all types of TEAEs analysed.

68Ga-PSMA-11 Treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) = any AE within 6 days of 68Ga-PSMA-11 
dosing or any treatment related AE > 6 days from 68Ga-PSMA-11 dosing as long as prior to first dose 
of randomized treatment. Relatedness was not distinguished between 68Ga-PSMA-11 and BSC/BSoC. 
Coded using MedDRA version 23.1 and NCI CTCAE version 5.0. 
The incidence of TEAEs was similar in patients who received a dose ≤185 MBq (n=854) and those who 
received > 185 MBq (n=149) (12.9% vs. 8.1%). The incidence of SAEs, Grade 3/4/5 TEAE, and related 
TEAEs, was also similar between the subgroups. The single serious related TEAE, all 4 related Grade 
3/4/5 TEAEs, and all three fatal TEAEs were reported in patients who received ≤185 MBq.

2.6.8.8.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scan was done only once and therefore no AE leading to discontinuation was 
collected. However, 2 patients were not enrolled to the randomized treatments due to AEs. One had a 
grade 3 SAE of pain that lasted 13 days and led to initial or prolonged hospitalization. The patient 
recovered without sequelae, and the event was not assessed as related to study treatment. The other 
had a grade 3 SAE of bicytopenia that lasted 11 days and led to initial or prolonged hospitalization. The 
patient recovered without sequelae, and the event was not assessed as related to study treatment. 
2.6.8.9.  Post marketing experience 
The product was recently authorized in the US (23-March-2022). No post-marketing data have been 
provided. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In total, safety data on single dose of 68Ga-PSMA-11 for 1003 patients with mCRPC from the clinical 
study PSMA-617-01 have been submitted. The actual dose administered in this study ranged from 
92.8 MBq (2.5 mCi) to 287.5 MBq (7.8 mCi), with a corresponding body weight adjusted dose range of 
0.9-3.7 MBq per kg (median dose: 1.9 MBq/kg) that covers the dose range proposed in the SmPC and 
is in line with the range utilized in majority of the published studies. Additional information from more 
than 3000 patients published in the literature has been also submitted. Overall, the size of tested 
population for assessment of safety is regarded adequate. 
Data collected in the Study PSMA-617-01 (VISION) suggest that the safety profile of 68Ga-PSMA-11 is 
favourable. However, the provided information is seriously flawed, as systemic concomitant treatments 
were allowed and no placebo control was included, so that it is difficult to draw robust conclusions on 
safety of 68Ga-PSMA-11 from the provided information.  
The incidence of TEAEs did not appear to be influenced by any of the intrinsic factors including age, 
race or renal impairment (normal, mild or moderate impairment as per eGFR, proteinuria, GFR and 
proteinuria, or renal impairment in anamnesis – yes/no), based on various subgroup analyses. 
Notably, the analysis did not consider ADRs of special interest (e.g., which could be assumed to be 
triggered by radiation exposure of healthy tissues, effects on kidneys, liver, etc.) which would have 
been more relevant. However, overall number of such events was very low and analysis of AEs for the 
subgroups at reported or preferred term level would not be meaningful.  
The subgroup analyses considering extrinsic factors showed that TEAEs were more frequently reported 
in Europe than in US, and severe and serious AEs were somewhat more frequent in the patients 
without other imaging procedure within 6 days prior to or after 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET. These differences 
were small and are not considered meaningful. In the subgroups with and without concomitant 
treatment with radiotherapy, NAAD or BSC/BSoC within the 6 days interval prior to, or after PET 
imaging, the patients with treatment had clearly higher frequency of TEAEs reported, especially in the 
group with radiotherapy (37.9 vs 11.4%, respectively). This finding is plausible, given that cancer 
treatments and especially radiotherapy are often associated with AEs.   
Finally, the subgroups of patients receiving higher and lower doses of 68Ga-PSMA-11 (cut-off value 185 
MBq, corresponding to the dose for 84-103 kg body weight, depending on the per kg dose 
recommended) were compared and those with lower doses reported higher frequency of TEAEs, than 
those at higher doses (12.9% vs 8.1% respectively) (data not shown). This is not plausible and seems 
to be confounded by various interfering factors in the study, such as large observation window for AEs 
EMA/871509/2022 
Page 103/116 
 
 
 
  
 
(6 days prior to or after 68Ga-PSMA-11 injection) combined with use of concomitant treatments and the 
vulnerable patient population with multiple complaints related to the background disease. To 
summarize, these subgroup analyses are considered confounded and less informative. 
Laboratory values were not monitored in the PSMA-617-01 study. Given the micro-dose range of used 
68Ga-PSMA-11, this is acceptable. 
No major safety issues have been reported in supportive literature following extensive use of 68Ga-
PSMA-11 (>3000 patients). One AE “Injection site pruritus” reported by Fendler et al., is considered as 
possibly causally related to 68Ga-PSMA-11 and was added to the product information.  
Currently, the following ADRs are listed in the PI: Nausea, Constipation, Vomiting, Diarrhoea, Dry 
mouth, Fatigue, Injection site reactions and Chills. These are acceptable. 
Given the low pH of 68Ga-PSMA-11 formulation and based on clinical experience with another low-pH 
medicinal product (SomaKit TOC), it is expected that injection site pain may emerge after 
administration of 68Ga-Locametz. It is considered sufficient at this stage to include the overarching 
term “injection site reactions” in the SmPC to inform prescribers.  
The risks related to radiation exposure for medical personnel were not addressed. However, given the 
relatively low/moderate dose of 68Ga-PSMA-11, short physical half-life of Ga-68 and the fact, that the 
product will be applied by trained medical personnel, no increased radiation risks are expected 
compared to other nuclear diagnostics. In addition, instructions for reconstitution and radiolabeling of 
the product are adequately reflected in the PI. Therefore, no further risk minimisation measures are 
deemed necessary in this regard.   
The product is not intended to be used in women. Therefore, no special requirements are foreseen for 
pregnancy and lactation, which is agreed. 
The paediatric use is also not intended due to specificities of the disease. This is adequately reflected in 
the PI. 
Gallium (68Ga) gozetotide uptake is not specific to prostate cancer and may occur in other types of 
cancers, non-malignant processes and normal tissues. Detailed knowledge of the exact characteristics 
of gallium (68Ga) gozetotide is crucial for correct interpretation of gallium (68Ga) gozetotide PET 
images.  
Considering that PET imaging interpretation errors and incorrect image interpretation still happen in 
clinical practice, with the level of such risk varying with experience and training of staff, educational 
material in the form of HCP reader training on imaging and interpretation is needed to minimise this 
(see RMP). 
To summarize, the safety analysis in the single arm Study PSMA-617-01 is heavily confounded by 
concomitant use of BSC/BSoC, background disease and the lack of targeted collection of safety 
information. Data in the literature are difficult to interpret given the lack of control and/or detailed 
information that would help establish causal relationship. The to-be-marketed formulation is not 
compliant with the Pharmacopeia and has not yet been tested in humans. However, only a micro-dose 
of Locametz will be administered to the patients, PSMA-11 has no known on-target or off-target PD 
effects, and no major safety risks are expected with Locametz administration, and acidity of the 
formulation is not seen as a major safety concern, in spite of some uncertainty related to absence of 
clinical data with Locametz. Data collected in sizable patient population (about 4000 patients) do not 
raise any specific safety concerns and suggest favourable safety profile and, therefore, safety is 
considered sufficiently substantiated in this Application.

2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
In conclusion, a single administration of 68Ga-PSMA-11 as an i.v. injection over 10-20 seconds at a 
dose of 3-7 mCi (111-259 MBq) is considered to have a favourable safety profile, given low number of 
safety reports in the literature and in VISION study and mostly mild severity of the reported AEs. 
Overall, the safety profile appears acceptable.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 23.03.2022. The new EURD list entry will

therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to SomaKit TOC. The bridging report submitted by the 
applicant has been found acceptable. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Locametz (gozetotide) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Locametz, after radiolabelling with gallium-68, is indicated for the detection of prostate-specific 
membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive lesions with positron emission tomography (PET) in adults with 
prostate cancer (PCa) in the following clinical settings: 
• 
Primary staging of patients with high-risk PCa prior to primary curative therapy, 
•  Suspected PCa recurrence in patients with increasing levels of serum prostate-specific antigen 
(PSA) after primary curative therapy, 
• 
Identification of patients with PSMA-positive progressive metastatic castration-resistant 
prostate cancer (mCRPC) for whom PSMA-targeted therapy is indicated (see section 4.4). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The joint guideline on diagnosis and management of prostate cancer from European Association of 
Urology (EAU), European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM), European Society for Therapeutic 
Radiology and Oncology (ESTRO), European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) and International 
Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG) (Mottet et al., 2022) acknowledges poor sensitivity of the 
available conventional diagnostic imaging, such as CT, MRI, bone scan.  
The guideline states that in the primary staging “PSMA PET/CT is more accurate for staging than CT 
and bone scan for high-risk disease but to date no outcome data exist to inform subsequent 
management” (level of evidence: 1b) and that “When using PSMA PET or whole body MRI to increase 
sensitivity, be aware of the lack of outcome data of subsequent treatment changes.” (strength rating: 
strong). In this setting ESMO recommends not to base clinical decision-making on the outcomes of 
68Ga-PSMA PET, as impact of this diagnostic tool on clinical outcomes has not been evaluated (Parker 
et al., 2020).  
In the BCR population, 68Ga-PSMA PET is recommended in patients after radical prostatectomy only if 
the results may influence subsequent therapy (strength rating: “weak”) and in patients after 
radiotherapy if they are fit for curative salvage treatment (strength rating: “strong”). Also, choline 
PET/CT, fluciclovine PET/CT, multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) are being recommended depending on the 
specific patient population (Mottet et al.). 
In relation to use of 68Ga-PSMA PET for selection of patients for PSMA-targeted therapy, as several 
treatments are in development (e.g. 177Lu-PSMA-617)), and no similar diagnostic product has been 
licenced yet, an unmet medical need can be assumed. 
68Ga-PSMA-11 adds value to the diagnostic landscape of PCa by detecting PSMA-positive lesions in 
patients with primary and recurrent PCa, as well as for targeted patient selection prior to start of a 
PSMA-based treatment.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This submission is primarily literature-based.  
EMA/871509/2022 
Page 108/116 
 
 
 
  
 
The [PSMA-617-01 Reviewer Variability Study] was an independent study of the Study PSMA-617-01 
scans to assess the extent of inter-reader variability and intra-reader reproducibility of the 68Ga-PSMA-
11 PET/CT scans that were used in Study PSMA-617-01. The study is not regarded supportive due to 
the questionable methodology applied and as it failed primary objective. The main evidence of efficacy 
has been provided from:  
Primary staging 
-  One (n=103) exploratory, prospective, 2-center, single-arm study in men with predominantly 
high-risk (89%), biopsy-proven PCa, with negative bone scan, who were being considered for 
candidates for extended pelvic lymph node dissection (van Kalmthout et al., 2020). The trial 
aimed to investigate diagnostic performance of PSMA PET-CT in detection of pelvic LN 
metastases.  
-  One large (n=277) exploratory, prospective, 2-center, single-arm, Phase 3 study in men with 
intermediate and high-risk PCa, who were considered for prostatectomy (Hope et al., 2021). 
Aim of the study was to assess diagnostic accuracy of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET for the detection of 
pelvic nodal metastases. 
BCR 
One large (n=316) confirmatory, prospective, multicenter, single-arm study, designed to assess the 
accuracy of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET imaging in localizing recurrent PC (Fendler et al., 2019). Patients with 
biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer after radical surgical treatment and/or radiation therapy (RT) with 
increased levels of PSA (0.2 ng/mL or greater measured during 6-13 weeks post-surgery, or Nadir 
equal or greater than 2 ng/mL after RT). The key endpoint used to evaluate accuracy was the PPV of 
68Ga-PSMA-11 PET on a per-patient and per region basis. Lesions were validated by histopathologic 
analysis (primary endpoint) and a composite reference standard (secondary endpoint). 
Patient selection for PSMA-targeted therapy 
68Ga-PSMA-11 was used for patient selection in the Applicant’s clinical VISION study (Study PSMA-617-
01). However, these data are of very limited relevance as the setting of VISION covers only a small 
part of the proposed indication, no data are provided about the fate of scan-negative subjects, 
validation of 68Ga-PSMA-11 findings by means of SOT/surrogate SOT was not done, comparative 
analysis to other imaging options has not been conducted, no AE reporting focused on assessment of 
68Ga-PSMA-11 safety was performed and the Applicant’s own product was not used in the trial. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The mode of action is considered established. PSMA is expressed in more than 90% of primary 
tumours when imaging occurs before initial therapy. 
Key evidence of favourable effects of 68Ga-PSMA-11 has been investigated in two settings which are 
part of the proposed indication: primary staging and diagnosis of PCa recurrence in BCR. 
-  Good diagnostic performance was observed in the main studies: 
Primary imaging: 
Positron emission tomography patient-based sensitivity of 41.5% (95% CI 26.7-57.8), specificity of 
90.9% (95% CI 79.3-96.6), and positive and negative predictive values of 77.3% (95%CI 54.2-91.3) 
and 67.6% (95% CI 55.6-77.7), respectively, for detecting LN metastases (van Kalmthout et al.).  
EMA/871509/2022 
Page 109/116 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Patient based sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for pelvic 
nodal metastases were 0.40 (95%CI, 0.34-0.46), 0.95 (95%CI, 0.92-0.97), 0.75 (95%CI, 0.70-0.80), 
and 0.81 (95%CI, 0.76-0.85), respectively (Hope et al.). 
BCR: 
On a per-patient basis, the PPV was 0.84 (95% CI: 0.75-0.90) by histopathologic validation (n = 87) 
and 0.92 (95% CI: 0.88-0.95) by the composite reference standard (n = 217). On a per-region basis, 
the PPV was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.76-0.91) by histopathologic validation (n = 90) and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.88-
0.95) by the composite reference standard (n = 249). Sensitivity by histopathologic validation was 
0.92 (95% CI, 0.84-0.96) on a per-patient basis, and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.82-0.95) on a per-region basis. 
-  Relevant impact on patient management was reported: 
Primary imaging:  
Impact on patient management ranged from 12.6% to 43%. 
BCR: 
Impact on patient management ranged from 28.6% to 78%. 
-  Moderate/good/very good agreement in image reads. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
• 
68Ga-PSMA-11 is dosed based on bodyweight. Supportive evidence (dose-finding studies) for this 
body-weight based dosing was not provided. However, there is large evidence available of effective 
use of the substance in the recommended dose.  
• 
• 
Impact of 68Ga-PSMA-11 on clinical outcome in the setting of primary staging is unknown. 
However, lack of this information is reflected in the SmPC section 4.4. 
Evidence of use for patient selection for treatment with PSMA-based therapy is limited to data from 
VISION study, including the specific and narrowly defined patient population, and treatment with 
177Lu-PSMA-617. Respective information has been added in the SmPC section 4.4 to inform the 
doctors accordingly. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Nausea, constipation, vomiting, diarrhoea, dry mouth, fatigue, injection site reactions (injection site 
haematoma, injection site warmth and injection site pruritus) and chills are considered as ADRs of 
68Ga-PSMA-11. Injection site pain may also occur given the low pH of the to-be-administered solution.  
In the study conducted by the Applicant 12.2% of patients had AEs in the defined treatment-emergent 
period in the days following 68Ga-PSMA-11 administration. The most frequent event was fatigue 
(1.2%), all other events were reported in less than 1.0% of patients. 1.6% of patients had at least one 
SAE, 2.1% had AEs of grade ≥ 3 in severity and 5.5% AEs considered as drug-related by the 
investigator. None of the SAEs or deaths was considered causally related to 68Ga-PSMA-11. The 
incidence of AEs in Study PSMA-617-01 was higher compared to the supportive literature. 
Few additional AEs were reported in the literature describing more than 3000 patients. 
EMA/871509/2022 
Page 110/116 
 
 
 
  
 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
• 
In the VISION study methodology of AE collection was flawed and use of concomitant systemic 
treatment was allowed, so that assessment of causal relationship is difficult. However, additional 
safety data from the literature do not suggest any specific and worrisome safety risks. 
•  Commercial formulation of gozetotide has not yet been tested in humans and it is unclear what will 
be its tolerability, also given the lower pH specification, than foreseen by the Pharmacopeia 
monograph “Gallium (68Ga) PSMA-11 Injection” (Eur. Ph. 3044). However, this is not expected to 
lead to critical safety findings based on clinical experience with  another product  with similarly low 
pH. Also, a warning about potential tolerability issues has been added in the product information 
(SmPC section 4.4).  
•  Safety in patients with severe renal impairment has not been studied. Absence of these data is 
adequately reflected in the product information.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Generally, poor sensitivity and low accuracy are acknowledged as weaknesses of currently used 
conventional imaging (e.g., CT, MRI, bone scan) and it is recognised that availability of more sensitive 
non-invasive diagnostic tool would be important to guide the doctors in decision-making on 
treatment/patient management in PCa. Submitted data suggest, that 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT may offer 
improvements in diagnostics of PCa during primary staging and diagnosis of PCa recurrence in patients 
with BCR, as well as a screening tool for patient selection for PSMA-targeted treatment.  
The assessment of impact of patient management showed considerable effects and moderate to high 
levels of inter-reader agreement are suggestive of reliability of the image read.  
These are all relevant effects, which could translate into clinical benefit, if sufficient risk-minimisation 
measures are put in place, if the target populations are correctly defined and if the SmPC includes 
adequate warnings in order to inform health care professionals. All these conditions are met by the 
current version of the SmPC.  
No critical findings (risks/unfavourable effects) were detected in relation with 68Ga-PSMA-11. Overall, 
safety profile of the product appears acceptable. There is a remaining uncertainty regarding the local 
EMA/871509/2022 
Page 112/116 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
tolerability of the to-be-marketed formulation, that has not been tested in humans yet. However, this 
uncertainty is not relevant enough to negatively impact the safety profile. Safety will be monitored 
post marketing with routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT may contribute to the diagnostics of PCa during primary staging and diagnosis 
of PCa recurrence in patients with BCR, as well as act as a screening tool for patient selection for 
PSMA-targeted treatment. Given the low number of safety reports in the literature and in the VISION 
study and mostly mild severity of the reported AEs, it can be concluded that the benefits outweigh the 
risks. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Locametz is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
Divergent position is appended to this report. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by majority 
decision that the benefit-risk balance of Locametz is favourable in the following indication(s): 
Locametz, after radiolabelling with gallium-68, is indicated for the detection of prostate-specific 
membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive lesions with positron emission tomography (PET) in adults with 
prostate cancer (PCa) in the following clinical settings: 
• 
• 
Primary staging of patients with high-risk PCa prior to primary curative therapy, 
Suspected PCa recurrence in patients with increasing levels of serum prostate specific-antigen 
(PSA) after primary curative therapy, 
• 
Identification of patients with PSMA-positive progressive metastatic castration-resistant 
prostate cancer (mCRPC) for whom PSMA-targeted therapy is indicated (see section 4.4).  
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
•  Periodic Safety Update Reports 
EMA/871509/2022 
Page 113/116 
 
 
 
  
 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
•  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
•  Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to launch of Locametz in each Member State, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) must 
agree about the content and format of the educational programme, including communication media, 
distribution modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with the National Competent 
Authority (NCA). 
The educational programme is aimed to reduce the risk of PET imaging interpretation errors. 
The MAH shall ensure that, in each Member State where Locametz is marketed, medical practitioners 
qualified to interpret PET scans in their country who are expected to use gallium (68Ga) gozetotide 
have access to the self-training educational material. 
The Locametz educational material for HCPs [gallium (68Ga) gozetotide imaging interpretation training]

Not applicable. 
These conditions fully reflect the advice received from the PRAC. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that gozetotide is to be qualified 
as a new active substance in itself as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously 
authorised within the European Union. 
Refer to Appendix on new active substance (NAS).

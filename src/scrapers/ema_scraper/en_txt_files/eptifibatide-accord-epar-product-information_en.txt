CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Eptifibatide Accord is intended for use with acetylsalicylic acid and unfractionated heparin. 
Eptifibatide Accord is indicated for the prevention of early myocardial infarction in adults presenting 
with unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, with the last episode of chest pain occurring 
within 24 hours and with electrocardiogram (ECG) changes and/or elevated cardiac enzymes. 
Patients most likely to benefit from Eptifibatide Accord treatment are those at high risk of developing 
myocardial  infarction  within  the  first  3-4  days  after  onset  of  acute  angina  symptoms  including  for 
instance  those  that  are  likely  to  undergo  an  early  PTCA  (Percutaneous  Transluminal  Coronary 
Angioplasty) (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
This product is for hospital use only. It should be administered by specialist physicians experienced in 
the management of acute coronary syndromes. 
Eptifibatide Accord solution for infusion must be used in conjunction with Eptifibatide Accord 
solution for injection. 
Concurrent administration of heparin is recommended unless this is contraindicated for reasons such as 
a history of thrombocytopenia associated with use of heparin (see ‘Heparin administration’, section 4.4). 
Eptifibatide Accord is also intended for concurrent use with acetylsalicylic acid, as it is part of standard 
management of patients with acute coronary syndromes, unless its use is contraindicated. 
Posology 
Adults ( 18 years of age) presenting with unstable angina (UA) or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction 
(NQMI) 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The recommended dosage is an intravenous bolus of 180 microgram/kg administered as soon as possible 
following diagnosis, followed by a continuous infusion of 2 microgram/kg/min for up to 72 hours, until 
initiation  of  coronary  artery  bypass  graft  (CABG)  surgery,  or  until  discharge  from  the  hospital 
(whichever occurs first). If Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) is performed during eptifibatide 
therapy, continue the infusion for 20-24 hours post-PCI for an overall maximum duration of therapy of 
96 hours. 
Emergency or semi-elective surgery 
If the patient requires emergency or urgent cardiac surgery during the course of  eptifibatide therapy, 
terminate the infusion immediately. If the patient requires semi-elective surgery, stop the eptifibatide 
infusion at an appropriate time to allow time for platelet function to return towards normal. 
Hepatic impairment 
Experience in patients with hepatic impairment is very limited. Administer with caution to patients with 
hepatic impairment in whom coagulation could be affected (see section 4.3, prothrombin time). It is 
contraindicated in patients with clinically significant hepatic impairment. 
Renal impairment 
In patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 30 - < 50 ml/min), an intravenous 
bolus  of  180 microgram/kg  should  be  administered  followed  by  a  continuous  infusion  dose  of 
1.0 microgram/kg/min for the duration of therapy. This recommendation is based on pharmacodynamic 
and  pharmacokinetic  data.  The  available  clinical  evidence  cannot  however  confirm  that  this  dose 
modification  results  in  a  preserved  benefit  (see  section  5.1).  Use  in  patients  with  more  severe  renal 
impairment is contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of eptifibatide in children aged below 18 years have not been established, due 
to lack of available data. 
Method of administration 
Intravenous use. 
For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Eptifibatide Accord must not be used to treat patients with: 
- 
-   evidence  of  gastrointestinal  bleeding,  gross  genitourinary  bleeding  or  other  active  abnormal 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1:

known history of intracranial disease (neoplasm, arteriovenous malformation, aneurysm); 
-   history of stroke within 30 days or any history of haemorrhagic stroke; 
- 
-   major surgery or severe trauma within past 6 weeks; 
-   a history of bleeding diathesis; 
-  
-   prothrombin time > 1.2 times control, or International Normalized Ratio (INR)   2.0; 
-  
thrombocytopenia (< 100,000 cells/mm3); 
severe  hypertension  (systolic  blood  pressure  >  200 mm  Hg  or  diastolic  blood  pressure 
> 110 mm Hg on   antihypertensive therapy); 
severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) or dependency on renal dialysis; 
-  
-   clinically significant hepatic impairment; 
-   concomitant or planned administration of another parenteral glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitor. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Bleeding 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Eptifibatide Accord is an antithrombotic agent that acts by inhibition of platelet aggregation; therefore, 
the patient must be observed carefully for indications of bleeding during treatment (see section 4.8). 
Women,  the  elderly,  patients  with  low  body  weight  or  with  moderate  renal  impairment  (creatinine 
clearance > 30 - < 50 ml/min) may have an increased risk of bleeding. Monitor these patients closely 
with regard to bleeding. 
An  increased risk  of  bleeding  may  also  be  observed  in  patients  who  receive  early  administration  of 
eptifibatide (e.g. upon diagnosis) compared to receiving it immediately prior to PCI, as seen in the Early 
ACS trial. Unlike the approved posology in the EU, all patients in this trial were administered a double 
bolus before the infusion (see section 5.1). 
Bleeding  is  most  common  at  the  arterial  access  site  in  patients  undergoing  percutaneous  arterial 
procedures. All potential bleeding sites, (e.g., catheter insertion sites; arterial, venous, or needle puncture 
sites;  cutdown  sites;  gastrointestinal  and  genitourinary  tracts)  must  be  observed  carefully.  Other 
potential bleeding sites such as central and peripheral nervous system and retroperitoneal sites, must be 
carefully considered too. 
Because Eptifibatide Accord inhibits platelet aggregation, caution must be employed when it is used 
with other medicinal products that affect haemostasis, including ticlopidine, clopidogrel, thrombolytics, 
oral  anticoagulants,  dextran  solutions,  adenosine,  sulfinpyrazone,  prostacyclin,  non-steroidal  anti-
inflammatory agents, or dypyridamole (see section 4.5). 
There is no experience with eptifibatide and low molecular weight heparins. 
There is limited therapeutic experience with eptifibatide in patients for whom thrombolytic therapy is 
generally  indicated  (e.g.  acute  transmural  myocardial  infarction  with  new  pathological  Q-waves  or 
elevated ST-segments or left bundle branch block in the ECG). Consequently, the use of Eptifibatide 
Accord is not recommended in these circumstances (see section 4.5). 
Eptifibatide  Accord  infusion  should  be  stopped  immediately  if  circumstances  arise  that  necessitate 
thrombolytic  therapy  or  if  the  patient  must  undergo  an  emergency  CABG  surgery  or  requires  an 
intraortic balloon pump. 
If serious bleeding occurs that is not controllable with pressure, the Eptifibatide Accord infusion should 
be stopped immediately and any unfractionated heparin that is given concomitantly. 
Arterial procedures 
During  treatment  with  eptifibatide  there  is  a  significant  increase  in  bleeding  rates,  especially  in  the 
femoral artery area, where the catheter sheath is introduced. Take care to ensure that only the anterior 
wall of the femoral artery is punctured. Arterial sheaths may be removed when coagulation has returned 
to normal (e.g. when activated clotting time (ACT) is less than 180 seconds (usually 2-6 hours after 
discontinuation of heparin). After removal of the introducer sheath, careful haemostasis must be ensured 
under close observation. 
Thrombocytopenia and Immunogencity related to GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors 
Eptifibatide Accord inhibits platelet aggregation, but does not appear to affect the viability of platelets. 
As demonstrated in clinical trials, the incidence of thrombocytopenia was low, and similar in patients 
treated with eptifibatide or placebo. Thrombocytopenia, including acute profound thrombocytopenia, 
has been observed with eptifibatide administration post-marketing (see section 4.8) 
The  mechanism,  whether  immune-  and/or  non-immune-mediated,  by  which  eptifibatide  may  induce 
thrombocytopenia  is  not  fully  understood.  However,  treatment  with eptifibatide was  associated  with 
antibodies  that  recognise  GPIIb/IIIa  occupied  by  eptifibatide,  suggesting  an  immune-mediated 
mechanism. Thrombocytopenia occurring after first exposure to a GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor may be explained 
by the fact that antibodies are naturally present in some normal individuals. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Since either repeat exposure with any GP IIb/IIIa ligand-mimetic agent (like abciximab or eptifibatide) 
or  first-time  exposure  to  a  GP  IIb/IIIa  inhibitor  may  be  associated  with  immune-mediated 
thrombocytopenic responses, monitoring is required, i.e. platelet counts should be monitored prior to 
treatment,  within  6 hours  of  administration,  and  at  least  once  daily  thereafter  while  on  therapy  and 
immediately at clinical signs of unexpected bleeding tendency. 
If  either  a  confirmed  platelet  decrease  to  <  100,000/mm3  or  acute  profound  thrombocytopenia  is 
observed, discontinuation of each treatment medication having known or suspected thrombocytopenic 
effects, including eptifibatide, heparin and clopidogrel, should be considered immediately. The decision 
to use platelet transfusions should be based upon clinical judgment on an individual basis. 
In  patients  with  previous  immune-mediated  thrombocytopenia  from  other  parenteral  GP  IIb/IIIa 
inhibitors, there are no data with the use of eptifibatide. Therefore, it is not recommended to administer 
eptifibatide in patients who have previously experienced immune mediated thrombocytopenia with GP 
IIb/IIIa inhibitors, including eptifibatide. 
Heparin administration 
Heparin  administration 
thrombocytopenia associated with use of heparin) is present. 
is  recommended  unless  a  contraindication  (such  as  a  history  of 
UA/NQMI: For a patient who weighs   70 kg, it is recommended that a bolus dose of 5,000 units is 
given, followed by a constant intravenous infusion of 1,000 units/hr. If the patient weighs < 70 kg, a 
bolus dose of 60 units/kg is recommended, followed by an infusion of 12 units/kg/hr. The activated 
partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) must be monitored in order to maintain a value between 50 and 70 
seconds, above 70 seconds there may be an increased risk of bleeding. 
If  PCI  is  to be  performed in the setting  of  UA/NQMI,  monitor the activated  clotting  time  (ACT)  to 
maintain  a  value  between  300-350  seconds.  Stop  heparin  administration  if  the  ACT  exceeds 
300 seconds; do not administer until the ACT falls below 300 seconds. 
Monitoring of laboratory values 
Before  infusion  of  Eptifibatide  Accord,  the  following  laboratory  tests  are  recommended  to  identify 
preexisting  haemostatic  abnormalities:  prothrombin  time  (PT)  and  aPTT,  serum  creatinine,  platelet 
count,  haemoglobin  and  haematocrit  levels.  Haemoglobin,  haematocrit,  and  platelet  count  are  to  be 
monitored as well within 6 hours after start of therapy and at least once daily thereafter while on therapy 
(or more often if there is evidence of a marked decrease). If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm3, 
further platelet counts are required to rule out pseudo thrombocytopenia. Discontinue  unfractionated 
heparin. In patients undergoing PCI, measure the ACT also. 
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains 172 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 8.6% of the WHO recommended 
maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.  
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Warfarin and dipyridamole 
Eptifibatide did not appear to increase the risk of major and minor bleeding associated with concomitant 
use of warfarin and dipyridamole. Eptifibatide -treated patients who had a prothrombin time (PT) > 14.5 
seconds and received warfarin concomitantly did not appear to be at an increased risk of bleeding. 
Eptifibatide and thrombolytic agents 
Data  are  limited  on  the  use  of  eptifibatide  in  patients  receiving  thrombolytic  agents.  There  was  no 
consistent evidence that eptifibatide increased the risk of major or minor bleeding associated with tissue 
plasminogen activator in either a PCI or an acute myocardial infarction study. Eptifibatide appeared to 
increase the risk of bleeding when administered with streptokinase in an acute myocardial infarction 
study.  The  combination  of  reduced  dose  tenecteplase  and  eptifibatide  compared  to  placebo  and 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
eptifibatide  significantly  increased  the  risk  of  both  major  and  minor  bleeding  when  administered 
concomitantly in an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction study. 
In an acute myocardial infarction study involving 181 patients, eptifibatide (in regimens up to a bolus 
injection of 180 microgram/kg, followed by an infusion up to 2 microgram/kg/min for up to 72 hours) 
was administered concomitantly with streptokinase (1.5 million units over 60 minutes). At the highest 
infusion rates (1.3 microgram/kg/min and 2.0 microgram/kg/min) studied, eptifibatide was associated 
with  an  increased  incidence  of  bleeding  and  transfusions  compared  to  the  incidence  seen  when 
streptokinase was given alone. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data from the use of eptifibatide in pregnant women. 
Animal  studies are insufficient  with respect  to effects  on  pregnancy,  embryonal/foetal  development, 
parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown.  
Eptifibatide Accord should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether eptifibatide is excreted in human milk. Interruption of breast-feeding during the 
treatment period is recommended. 
Fertility 
No human data on the effect of drug substance eptifibatide on fertility are available.  
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Not relevant, as Eptifibatide Accord is intended for use only in hospitalised patients. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
The  majority  of  adverse  reactions  experienced  by  patients  treated  with  eptifibatide  were  generally 
related to bleeding or to cardiovascular events that occur frequently in this patient population. 
Clinical Trials 
The  data  sources  used  to  determine  adverse  reaction  frequency  descriptors  included  two  phase  III 
clinical studies (PURSUIT and ESPRIT). These trials are briefly described below. 
PURSUIT: This was a randomized, double-blind evaluation of the efficacy and safety of eptifibatide 
versus placebo for reducing mortality and myocardial (re)infarction in patients with unstable angina or 
non-Q-wave myocardial infarction. 
ESPRIT:  This  was  a  double-blind,  multicentre,  randomized,  parallel-group,  placebo-controlled  trial 
evaluating the safety and efficacy of eptifibatide therapy in patients scheduled to undergo non-emergent 
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent implantation. 
In PURSUIT, bleeding and non-bleeding events were collected from hospital discharge to the 30 day 
visit. In ESPRIT, bleeding events were reported at 48 hours, and non-bleeding events were reported at 
30 days. While Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction TIMI bleeding criteria were used to categorize 
the incidence of major and minor bleeding in both the PURSUIT and the ESPRIT trials, PURSUIT data 
was collected within 30 days while ESPRIT data was limited to events within 48 hours or discharge, 
whichever came first. 
The undesirable effects are listed by system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are defined as very 
common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to 
< 1/1000);  very  rare  (< 1/10,000);  not  known  (cannot  be  estimated  from  available  data).  These  are 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
absolute  reporting  frequencies  without  taking  into  account  placebo  rates.  For  a  particular  adverse 
reaction, if data was available from both PURSUIT and ESPRIT, then the highest reported incidence 
was used to assign adverse reaction frequency. 
Note that causality has not been determined for all adverse reactions. 
Blood and Lymphatic System Disorder 
Very common 
Bleeding (major and minor bleeding including femoral artery access, CABG-
related, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, retroperitoneal, intracranial, 
haematemesis, haematuria, oral/oropharyngeal, haemoglobin/haematocrit 
decreased and other). 
Thrombocytopenia. 
Uncommon 
Nervous System disorders 
Uncommon 
Cardiac Disorders 
Common 
Cerebral ischaemia. 
Cardiac arrest, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, congestive heart 
failure, atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation. 
Vascular Disorders 
Common 
Shock, hypotension, phlebitis. 
Cardiac arrest, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, and shock, which are 
commonly reported events from the PURSUIT trial, were events related to the underlying disease. 
Administration of eptifibatide is associated with an increase in major and minor bleeding as classified 
by the criteria of the TIMI study group. At the recommended therapeutic dose, as administered in the 
PURSUIT  trial  involving  nearly  11,000 patients,  bleeding  was  the  most  common  complication 
encountered  during  eptifibatide  therapy.  The  most  common  bleeding  complications  were  associated 
with cardiac invasive procedures (coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)-related or at femoral artery 
access site). 
Minor  bleeding  was  defined  in  the  PURSUIT  trial  as  spontaneous  gross  haematuria,  spontaneous 
haematemesis, observed blood loss with a haemoglobin decrease of more than 3 g/dl, or a haemoglobin 
decrease  of  more  than  4  g/dl  in  the  absence  of  an  observed  bleeding  site.  During  treatment  with 
eptifibatide  in  this  study,  minor  bleeding  was  a  very  common  complication  (> 1/10,  or  13.1 %  for 
eptifibatide  versus  7.6 %  for  placebo).  Bleeding  events  were  more  frequent  in  patients  receiving 
concurrent heparin while undergoing PCI, when ACT exceeded 350 seconds (see section 4.4, heparin 
use). 
Major bleeding was defined in the PURSUIT trial as either an intracranial haemorrhage or a decrease in 
haemoglobin concentrations of more than 5 g/dl. Major bleeding was also very common and reported 
more frequently with eptifibatide than with placebo in the PURSUIT study (> 1/10 or 10.8 % versus 
9.3 %), but it was infrequent in the vast majority of patients who did not undergo CABG within 30 days 
of inclusion in the study. In patients undergoing CABG, the incidence of bleeding was not increased by 
eptifibatide compared to the patients treated with placebo. In the subgroup of patients undergoing PCI, 
major bleeding was observed commonly, in 9.7 % of eptifibatide -treated patients vs. 4.6 % of placebo-
treated patients. 
The incidence of severe or life threatening bleeding events with  eptifibatide was 1.9 % compared to 
1.1 % with placebo. The need for blood transfusions was increased modestly by eptifibatide treatment 
(11.8 % versus 9.3 % for placebo). 
Changes during eptifibatide treatment result from its known pharmacological action, i.e., inhibition of 
platelet  aggregation.  Thus,  changes  in  laboratory  parameters  associated  with  bleeding  (e.g.  bleeding 
time) are common and expected. No apparent differences were observed between patients treated with 
eptifibatide or with placebo in values for liver function (SGOT/AST, SGPT/ALT, bilirubin, alkaline 
phosphatase) or renal function (serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen).

Post-marketing experience 
Blood and lymphatic system disorders 
Very rare 
Fatal bleeding (the majority involved central and peripheral nervous 
system disorders: cerebral or intracranial haemorrhages); pulmonary 
haemorrhage, acute profound thrombocytopenia, haematoma. 
Immune system disorders 
Very rare 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Very rare 
Anaphylactic reactions. 
Rash, application site disorders such as urticaria. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are 
asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
The experience in humans with overdose of eptifibatide is extremely limited. There was no indication 
of severe adverse reactions associated with administration of accidental large bolus doses, rapid infusion 
reported  as  overdose  or  large  cumulative  doses.  In  the  PURSUIT  trial,  there  were  9  patients  who 
received bolus and/or infusion doses more than double the recommended dose, or who were identified 
by the investigator as having received an overdose. There was no excessive bleeding in any of these 
patients, although one patient undergoing CABG surgery was reported as having had a moderate bleed. 
Specifically, no patients experienced an intracranial bleed. 
Potentially, an overdose of eptifibatide could result in bleeding. Because of its short half-life and rapid 
clearance, the activity of eptifibatide may be halted readily by discontinuing the infusion. Thus, although 
eptifibatide can be dialysed, the need for dialysis is unlikely. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agent (platelet aggregation inhibitors excl. heparin), ATC 
code: B01AC16 
Mechanism of action 
Eptifibatide, a synthetic cyclic heptapeptide containing six amino acids, including one cysteine amide 
and  one  mercaptopropionyl  (desamino  cysteinyl)  residue,  is  an  inhibitor  of  platelet  aggregation  and 
belongs to the class of RGD (arginine-glycine-aspartate)-mimetics. 
Eptifibatide  reversibly  inhibits  platelet  aggregation  by  preventing  the  binding  of  fibrinogen,  von 
Willebrand factor and other adhesive ligands to the glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptors. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Eptifibatide  inhibits  platelet  aggregation  in  a  dose-  and  concentration-dependent  manner  as 
demonstrated by ex vivo platelet aggregation using adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and other agonists to 
induce platelet aggregation. The effect of eptifibatide is observed immediately after administration of a 
180 microgram/kg intravenous bolus. When followed by a 2.0 microgram/kg/min continuous infusion, 
this regimen produces a > 80 % inhibition of ADP-induced ex vivo platelet aggregation, at physiologic 
calcium concentrations, in more than 80 % of patients. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Platelet  inhibition  was  readily  reversed,  with  a  return  of  platelet  function  towards  baseline  (>  50 % 
platelet  aggregation)  4  hours  after  stopping  a  continuous  infusion  of  2.0  microgram/kg/min. 
Measurements  of  ADP-induced  ex  vivo  platelet  aggregation  at  physiologic  calcium  concentrations 
(Dphenylalanyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine  chloromethyl  ketone  anticoagulant)  in  patients  presenting  with 
unstable angina and Non Q-Wave Myocardial Infarction showed a concentration-dependent inhibition 
with an IC50 (50 % inhibitory concentration) of approximately 550 ng/ml and an IC80 (80 % inhibitory 
concentration) of approximately 1,100 ng/ml. 
There is limited data with regards to platelet inhibition in patients with renal impairment. In patients 
with moderate renal impairment, (creatinine clearance 30 - 50 ml/min) 100 % inhibition was achieved 
at 24 hours following administration of 2 microgram/kg/min. In patients with severe renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) administered 1microgram/kg/min , 80 % inhibition was achieved in 
more than 80 % of patients at 24 hours. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
PURSUIT trial 
The pivotal clinical trial for Unstable Angina (UA)/Non-Q Wave Myocardial Infarction (NQMI) was 
PURSUIT.  This  study  was  a  726-center,  27-country,  double-blind,  randomised,  placebo-controlled 
study  in  10,948  patients  presenting  with  UA  or  NQMI.  Patients  could  be  enrolled  only  if  they  had 
experienced cardiac ischemia at rest ( 10 minutes) within the previous 24 hours and had: 
 
either ST-segment changes: ST depression > 0.5 mm of less than 30 minutes or persistent ST 
elevation > 0.5 mm not requiring reperfusion therapy or thrombolytic agents, T-wave 
inversion (> 1 mm), 
  or increased CK-MB. 
Patients  were  randomised  to  either  placebo,  eptifibatide  180 microgram/kg  bolus  followed  by  a 
2.0 microgram/kg/min  infusion  (180/2.0),  or  eptifibatide  180 microgram/kg  bolus  followed  by  a 
1.3 microgram/kg/min infusion (180/1.3). 
The infusion was continued until hospital discharge, until the time of coronary artery bypass grafting 
(CABG) or for up to 72 hours, whichever occurred first. If PCI was performed, the eptifibatide infusion 
was continued for 24 hours after the procedure, allowing for a duration of infusion up to 96 hours. 
The 180/1.3 arm was stopped after an interim analysis, as prespecified in the protocol, when the two 
active-treatment arms appeared to have a similar incidence of bleeding. 
Patients  were  managed  according  to  the  usual  standards  of  the  investigational  site;  frequencies  of 
angiography, PCI and CABG therefore differed widely from site to site and from country to country. Of 
the  patients  in  PURSUIT,  13 %  were  managed  with  PCI  during  eptifibatide  infusion,  of  whom 
approximately 50 % received intracoronary stents; 87 % were managed medically (without PCI during 
eptifibatide infusion). 
The vast majority of patients received acetylsalicylic acid (75-325 mg once daily). 
Unfractionated heparin was administered intravenously or subcutaneously at the physician’s discretion, 
most commonly as an intravenous bolus of 5,000 U followed by a continuous infusion of 1,000 U/h. A 
target aPTT of 50-70 seconds was recommended. A total of 1,250 patients underwent PCI within 72 
hours after randomisation, in which case they received intravenous unfractionated heparin to maintain 
an activated clotting time (ACT) of 300-350 seconds. 
The primary endpoint of the study was the occurrence of death from any cause or new myocardial 
infarction (MI) (evaluated by a blinded Clinical Events Committee) within 30 days of randomisation. 
The component MI could be defined as asymptomatic with enzymatic elevation of CK-MB or new Q 
wave. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Compared to placebo, eptifibatide administered as 180/2.0 significantly reduced the incidence of the 
primary endpoint events (table 1): this represents around 15 events avoided for 1,000 patients treated:

a: Pearson’s chi-square test of difference between placebo and eptifibatide. 
Results on the primary endpoint were principally attributed to the occurrence of myocardial infarction. 
The reduction in the incidence of endpoint events in patients receiving eptifibatide appeared early during 
treatment (within the first 72-96 hours) and this reduction was maintained through 6 months, without 
any significant effect on mortality. 
Patients most likely to benefit from eptifibatide treatment are those at high risk of developing 
myocardial infarction within the first 3-4 days after onset of acute angina. 
According to epidemiological findings, a higher incidence of cardiovascular events has been 
associated with certain indicators, for instance: 
-   age 
-   elevated heart rate or blood pressure 
-   persistent or recurrent ischemic cardiac pain 
-   marked ECG changes (in particular ST-segment abnormalities) 
-   raised cardiac enzymes or markers (e.g. CK-MB, troponins) and 
-   heart failure 
PURSUIT was conducted at a time when the standard of care of managing acute coronary syndromes 
was  different  from  that  of  present  times  in  terms  of  thienopyridine  use  and  the  routine  use  of 
intracoronary stents. 
ESPRIT trial 
ESPRIT  (Enhanced  Suppression  of  the  Platelet  IIb/IIIa  Receptor  with  eptifibatide  Therapy)  was  a 
double-blind,  randomised,  placebo-controlled  trial  (n=  2,064)  for  nonurgent  PCI  with  intracoronary 
stenting. 
All patients received routine standard of care and were randomised to either placebo or eptifibatide (2 
bolus doses of 180 microgram/kg and a continuous infusion until discharge from hospital or a maximum 
of 18-24 hours). 
The first bolus and the infusion were started simultaneously, immediately before the PCI procedure and 
were  followed  by  a  second  bolus  10  minutes  after  the  first.  The  rate  of  infusion  was  2.0 
microgram/kg/min for patients with serum creatinine ≤ 175 micromols/l or 1.0 microgram/kg/min for 
serum creatinine > 175 up to 350 micromols/l. 
In the eptifibatide arm of the trial, virtually all patients received aspirin (99.7 %), and 98.1 % received 
a  thienopyridine,  (clopidogrel  in  95.4  %  and  ticlopidine  in  2.7  %).  On  the  day  of  PCI,  prior  to 
catheterization, 53.2 % received a thienopyridine (clopidogrel 52.7 %; ticlopidine 0.5 %) – mostly as a 
loading dose (300 mg or more). The placebo arm was comparable (aspirin 99.7 %, clopidogrel 95.9 %, 
ticlopidin 2.6 %). 
The ESPRIT trial used a simplified regimen of heparin during PCI that consisted of an initial bolus of 
60 units/kg, with a target ACT of 200 - 300 seconds. The primary endpoint of the trial was death (D), 
MI, urgent target vessel revascularisation (UTVR), and acute antithrombotic rescue with GP IIb/IIIa 
inhibitor therapy (RT) within 48 hours of randomisation.

MI was identified per the CK-MB core laboratory criteria. For this diagnosis, within 24 hours after the 
index PCI procedure, there had to be at least two CK-MB values   3 x the upper limit of normal; thus, 
validation by the CEC was not required. MI could also be reported following CEC adjudication of an 
investigator report. 
The primary endpoint analysis [quadruple composite of death, MI, urgent target vessel revascularisation 
(UTVR)  and  thrombolytic  bail-out  (TBO)  at  48  hours]  showed  a  37  %  relative  and  3.9  %  absolute 
reduction in the eptifibatide group (6.6 % events versus 10.5 %, p=  0.0015). Results on the primary 
endpoint  were  mainly  attributed  to  the  reduction  of  enzymatic  MI  occurrence,  identified  as  the 
occurrence of early elevation of cardiac enzymes after PCI (80 out of 92 MIs in the placebo group vs. 
47  out  of  56  MIs  in  the  eptifibatide  group).  The  clinical  relevance  of  such  enzymatic  MIs  is  still 
controversial. 
Similar results were also obtained for the 2 secondary endpoints assessed at 30 days: a triple composite 
of death, MI and UTVR, and the more robust combination of death and MI. 
The reduction in the incidence of endpoint events in patients receiving eptifibatide appeared early during 
treatment. There was no increased benefit thereafter, up to 1 year. 
Prolongation of bleeding time 
Administration  of  eptifibatide  by  intravenous  bolus  and  infusion  causes  up  to  a  5-fold  increase  in 
bleeding  time. This increase  is readily  reversible upon  discontinuation  of the  infusion  with  bleeding 
times returning towards baseline in approximately 6 (2-8) hours. When administered alone, eptifibatide 
has no measurable effect on prothrombin time (PT) or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). 
EARLY-ACS trial 
EARLY  ACS  (Early  Glycoprotein  IIb/IIIa  Inhibition  in  Non-ST-segment  Elevation  Acute  Coronary 
Syndrome) was a study of early routine eptifibatide versus placebo (with delayed provisional use of 
eptifibatide in the catheterization laboratory) used in combination with antithrombotic therapies (ASA, 
UFH,  bivalirudin,  fondaparinux  or  low  molecular  weight  heparin),  in  subjects  with  high-risk  NSTE 
ACS. Patients were to undergo an invasive strategy for further management after receiving study drug 
for  12  to  96  hours.  Patients  could  be  medically  managed,  proceed  to  coronary  artery  bypass  graft 
(CABG), or undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Unlike the approved posology in the 
EU, the study used a double bolus of study drug (separated by 10 minutes) before the infusion. 
Early routine eptifibatide in this high-risk NSTE-ACS optimally-treated population who were managed 
with an invasive strategy did not result in a statistically significant reduction in the composite primary 
endpoint of rate of death, MI, RI-UR, and TBO within 96 hours compared with a regimen of delayed 
provisional eptifibatide (9.3 % in early eptifibatide patients vs. 10.0 % in patients assigned to delayed 
provisional  eptifibatide;  odds  ratio=0.920;  95 %  CI=0.802-1.055;  p=0.234).  GUSTO  severe/life 
threatening  bleeding  was  uncommon  and  comparable  in  both  treatment  groups  (0.8 %).  GUSTO 
moderate  or  severe/life  threatening  bleeding  occurred  significantly  more  often  with  early  routine 
eptifibatide (7.4 % vs. 5.0 % in delayed provisional eptifibatide group; p <0.001). Similar differences 
were noted for TIMI major haemorrhage (118 [2.5 %] in early routine use vs. 83 [1.8 %] in delayed 
provisional use; p=0.016). 
No  statistically  significant  benefit  of  early  routine  eptifibatide  strategy  was  demonstrated  in  the 
subgroup of patients who were managed medically or during the medical management periods prior to 
PCI or CABG. 
In  a  post  hoc  analysis  of  the  EARLY  ACS  trial  the  risk  benefit  of  dose  reduction  in  patients  with 
moderate renal impairment is inconclusive. The primary endpoint event rate was 11.9 % in patients who 
received a reduced dose (1microgram/kg/min) vs 11.2 % in patients who received the standard dose 
(2 microgram/kg/min) when eptifibatide was administered in the early routine fashion (p=0.81). With 
delayed provisional eptifibatide administration, the event rates were 10 % vs 11.5 % in patients who 
received reduced dose and standard dose respectively (p=0.61). TIMI major bleeding occurred in 2.7 % 
of patients who received a reduced dose (1microgram/kg/min) vs 4.2 % of patients who received the 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
standard dose (2 microgram/kg/min) when eptifibatide was  administered in the early routine fashion 
(p=0.36). With delayed provisional eptifibatide administration, the TIMI major events were 1.4 % vs 
2.0 % in patients who received reduced dose and standard dose respectively (p=0.54).There were no 
notable differences observed with GUSTO severe bleeding rates. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
The pharmacokinetics of eptifibatide are linear and dose proportional for bolus doses ranging from 90 
to 250 microgram/kg and infusion rates from 0.5 to 3.0 microgram/kg/min.  
Distribution 
For a 2.0 microgram/kg/min infusion, mean steady-state plasma eptifibatide concentrations range from 
1.5  to  2.2  microgram/ml  in  patients  with  coronary  artery  disease.  These  plasma  concentrations  are 
achieved rapidly when the infusion is preceded by an 180microgram/kg bolus.  
Biotransformation 
The  extent  of  eptifibatide  binding  to  human  plasma  protein  is  about  25  %.  In  the  same  population, 
plasma elimination half-life is approximately 2.5 hours, plasma clearance 55 to 80 ml/kg/hr and volume 
of distribution of approximately 185 to 260 ml/kg. 
Elimination 
In  healthy  subjects,  renal  excretion  accounted  for  approximately  50 %  of  total  body  clearance; 
approximately 50 % of the amount cleared is excreted unchanged. In patients with moderate to severe 
renal  insufficiency  (creatinine  clearance  <  50 ml/min),  the  clearance  of  eptifibatide  is  reduced  by 
approximately 50 % and steady-state plasma levels are approximately doubled. 
No  formal  pharmacokinetic  interaction  studies  have  been  conducted.  However,  in  a  population 
pharmacokinetic study there was no evidence of a pharmacokinetic interaction between eptifibatide and 
the  following  concomitant  medicinal  products:  amlodipine,  atenolol,  atropine,  captopril,  cefazolin, 
diazepam,  digoxin,  diltiazem,  diphenhydramine,  enalapril,  fentanyl,  furosemide,  heparin,  lidocaine, 
lisinopril, metoprolol, midazolam, morphine, nitrates, nifedipine, and warfarin. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Toxicology studies conducted with eptifibatide include single and repeated dose studies in the rat, rabbit 
and monkey, reproduction studies in the rat and rabbit, in vitro and in vivo genetic toxicity studies, and 
irritation, hypersensitivity and antigenicity studies. No unexpected toxic effects for an agent with this 
pharmacologic profile were observed and findings were predictive of clinical experience, with bleeding 
effects being the principal adverse event. No genotoxic effects were observed with eptifibatide. 
Teratology studies have been performed by continuous intravenous infusion of eptifibatide in pregnant 
rats at total daily doses of up to 72 mg/kg/day (about 4 times the recommended maximum daily human 
dose on a body surface area basis) and in pregnant rabbits at total daily doses of up to 36  mg/kg/day 
(about  4  times  the  recommended  maximum  daily  human  dose  on  a  body  surface  area  basis).  These 
studies revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the foetus due to eptifibatide. 
Reproduction studies in animal species where eptifibatide shows a similar pharmacologic activity as in 
humans  are  not  available.  Consequently  these  studies  are  not  suitable  to  evaluate  the  toxicity  of 
eptifibatide on reproductive function (see section 4.6). 
The carcinogenic potential of eptifibatide has not been evaluated in long-term studies.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Eptifibatide Accord is intended for use with acetylsalicylic acid and unfractionated heparin. 
Eptifibatide Accord is indicated for the prevention of early myocardial infarction in adults presenting 
with unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, with the last episode of chest pain occurring 
within 24 hours and with electrocardiogram (ECG) changes and/or elevated cardiac enzymes. 
Patients most likely to benefit from Eptifibatide Accord treatment are those at high risk of developing 
myocardial  infarction  within  the  first  3-4  days  after  onset  of  acute  angina  symptoms  including  for 
instance  those  that  are  likely  to  undergo  an  early  PTCA  (Percutaneous  Transluminal  Coronary 
Angioplasty) (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
This product is for hospital use only. It should be administered by specialist physicians experienced in 
the management of acute coronary syndromes. 
Eptifibatide Accord solution for injection must be used in conjunction with Eptifibatide Accord 
solution for infusion. 
Concurrent administration of heparin is recommended unless this is contraindicated for reasons such as 
a history of thrombocytopenia associated with use of heparin (see ‘Heparin administration’, section 4.4). 
Eptifibatide Accord is also intended for concurrent use with acetylsalicylic acid, as it is part of standard 
management of patients with acute coronary syndromes, unless its use is contraindicated. 
Posology 
Adults ( 18 years of age) presenting with unstable angina (UA) or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction 
(NQMI) 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The recommended dosage is an intravenous bolus of 180 microgram/kg administered as soon as possible 
following diagnosis, followed by a continuous infusion of 2 microgram/kg/min for up to 72 hours, until 
initiation  of  coronary  artery  bypass  graft  (CABG)  surgery,  or  until  discharge  from  the  hospital 
(whichever occurs first). If Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) is performed during eptifibatide 
therapy, continue the infusion for 20-24 hours post-PCI for an overall maximum duration of therapy of 
96 hours. 
Emergency or semi-elective surgery 
If the patient requires emergency or urgent cardiac surgery during the course of eptifibatide therapy, 
terminate the infusion immediately. If the patient requires semi-elective surgery, stop the eptifibatide 
infusion at an appropriate time to allow time for platelet function to return towards normal. 
Hepatic impairment 
Experience in patients with hepatic impairment is very limited. Administer with caution to patients with 
hepatic impairment in whom coagulation could be affected (see section 4.3, prothrombin time). It is 
contraindicated in patients with clinically significant hepatic impairment. 
Renal impairment 
In patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 30 - < 50 ml/min), an intravenous 
bolus  of  180 microgram/kg  should  be  administered  followed  by  a  continuous  infusion  dose  of 
1.0 microgram/kg/min for the duration of therapy. This recommendation is based on pharmacodynamic 
and  pharmacokinetic  data.  The  available  clinical  evidence  cannot  however  confirm  that  this  dose 
modification  results  in  a  preserved  benefit  (see  section  5.1).  Use  in  patients  with  more  severe  renal 
impairment is contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of eptifibatide in children aged below 18 years have not been established, due 
to lack of available data. 
Method of administration 
Intravenous use. 
For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Eptifibatide Accord must not be used to treat patients with: 
- 
- 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1; 
evidence  of  gastrointestinal  bleeding,  gross  genitourinary  bleeding  or  other  active  abnormal 
bleeding within the previous 30 days of treatment; 
history of stroke within 30 days or any history of haemorrhagic stroke; 
known history of intracranial disease (neoplasm, arteriovenous malformation, aneurysm); 
- 
- 
-  major surgery or severe trauma within past 6 weeks; 
- 
-

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Bleeding 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Eptifibatide Accord is an antithrombotic agent that acts by inhibition of platelet aggregation; therefore 
the patient must be observed carefully for indications of bleeding during treatment (see section 4.8). 
Women,  the  elderly,  patients  with  low  body  weight  or  with  moderate  renal  impairment  (creatinine 
clearance > 30 - < 50 ml/min) may have an increased risk of bleeding. Monitor these patients closely 
with regard to bleeding. 
An  increased risk  of  bleeding  may  also  be  observed  in  patients  who  receive  early  administration  of 
eptifibatide (e.g. upon diagnosis) compared to receiving it immediately prior to PCI, as seen in the Early 
ACS trial. Unlike the approved posology in the EU, all patients in this trial were administered a double 
bolus before the infusion (see section 5.1). 
Bleeding  is  most  common  at  the  arterial  access  site  in  patients  undergoing  percutaneous  arterial 
procedures. All potential bleeding sites, (e.g., catheter insertion sites; arterial, venous, or needle puncture 
sites;  cutdown  sites;  gastrointestinal  and  genitourinary  tracts)  must  be  observed  carefully.  Other 
potential bleeding sites such as central and peripheral nervous system and retroperitoneal sites, must be 
carefully considered too. 
Because Eptifibatide Accord inhibits platelet aggregation, caution must be employed when it is used 
with other medicinal products that affect haemostasis, including ticlopidine, clopidogrel, thrombolytics, 
oral  anticoagulants,  dextran  solutions,  adenosine,  sulfinpyrazone,  prostacyclin,  non-steroidal  anti-
inflammatory agents, or dypyridamole (see section 4.5). 
There is no experience with eptifibatide and low molecular weight heparins. 
There is limited therapeutic experience with eptifibatide in patients for whom thrombolytic therapy is 
generally  indicated  (e.g.  acute  transmural  myocardial  infarction  with  new  pathological  Q-waves  or 
elevated ST-segments or left bundle branch block in the ECG). Consequently, the use of Eptifibatide 
Accord is not recommended in these circumstances (see section 4.5). 
Eptifibatide  Accord  infusion  should  be  stopped  immediately  if  circumstances  arise  that  necessitate 
thrombolytic  therapy  or  if  the  patient  must  undergo  an  emergency  CABG  surgery  or  requires  an 
intraortic balloon pump. 
If serious bleeding occurs that is not controllable with pressure, the Eptifibatide Accord infusion should 
be stopped immediately and any unfractionated heparin that is given concomitantly. 
Arterial procedures 
During  treatment  with  eptifibatide  there  is  a  significant  increase  in  bleeding  rates,  especially  in  the 
femoral artery area, where the catheter sheath is introduced. Take care to ensure that only the anterior 
wall of the femoral artery is punctured. Arterial sheaths may be removed when coagulation has returned 
to normal (e.g. when activated clotting time (ACT) is less than 180 seconds (usually 2-6 hours after 
discontinuation of heparin). After removal of the introducer sheath, careful haemostasis must be ensured 
under close observation. 
Thrombocytopenia and Immunogencity related to GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors 
Eptifibatide Accord inhibits platelet aggregation, but does not appear to affect the viability of platelets. 
As demonstrated in clinical trials, the incidence of thrombocytopenia was low, and similar in patients 
treated with eptifibatide or placebo. Thrombocytopenia, including acute profound thrombocytopenia, 
has been observed with eptifibatide administration post-marketing (see section 4.8) 
The  mechanism,  whether  immune-  and/or  non-immune-mediated,  by  which  eptifibatide  may  induce 
thrombocytopenia  is  not  fully  understood.  However,  treatment  with eptifibatide was  associated  with 
antibodies  that  recognise  GPIIb/IIIa  occupied  by  eptifibatide,  suggesting  an  immune-mediated 
mechanism. Thrombocytopenia occurring after first exposure to a GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor may be explained 
by the fact that antibodies are naturally present in some normal individuals. 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Since either repeat exposure with any GP IIb/IIIa ligand-mimetic agent (like abciximab or eptifibatide) 
or  first-time  exposure  to  a  GP  IIb/IIIa  inhibitor  may  be  associated  with  immune-mediated 
thrombocytopenic responses, monitoring is required, i.e. platelet counts should be monitored prior to 
treatment,  within  6 hours  of  administration,  and  at  least  once  daily  thereafter  while  on  therapy  and 
immediately at clinical signs of unexpected bleeding tendency. 
If  either  a  confirmed  platelet  decrease  to  <  100,000/mm3  or  acute  profound  thrombocytopenia  is 
observed, discontinuation of each treatment medication having known or suspected thrombocytopenic 
effects, including eptifibatide, heparin and clopidogrel, should be considered immediately. The decision 
to use platelet transfusions should be based upon clinical judgment on an individual basis. 
In  patients  with  previous  immune-mediated  thrombocytopenia  from  other  parenteral  GP  IIb/IIIa 
inhibitors, there are no data with the use of eptifibatide. Therefore, it is not recommended to administer 
eptifibatide in patients who have previously experienced immune mediated thrombocytopenia with GP 
IIb/IIIa inhibitors, including eptifibatide. 
Heparin administration 
Heparin  administration 
thrombocytopenia associated with use of heparin) is present. 
is  recommended  unless  a  contraindication  (such  as  a  history  of 
UA/NQMI: For a patient who weighs   70 kg, it is recommended that a bolus dose of 5,000 units is 
given, followed by a constant intravenous infusion of 1,000 units/hr. If the patient weighs < 70 kg, a 
bolus dose of 60 units/kg is recommended, followed by an infusion of 12 units/kg/hr. The activated 
partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) must be monitored in order to maintain a value between 50 and 70 
seconds, above 70 seconds there may be an increased risk of bleeding. 
If  PCI  is  to be  performed in the setting  of  UA/NQMI,  monitor the activated  clotting  time  (ACT)  to 
maintain  a  value  between  300-350  seconds.  Stop  heparin  administration  if  the  ACT  exceeds 
300 seconds; do not administer until the ACT falls below 300 seconds. 
Monitoring of laboratory values 
Before  infusion  of  Eptifibatide  Accord,  the  following  laboratory  tests  are  recommended  to  identify 
preexisting  haemostatic  abnormalities:  prothrombin  time  (PT)  and  aPTT,  serum  creatinine,  platelet 
count,  haemoglobin  and  haematocrit  levels.  Haemoglobin,  haematocrit,  and  platelet  count  are  to  be 
monitored as well within 6 hours after start of therapy and at least once daily thereafter while on therapy 
(or more often if there is evidence of a marked decrease). If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm3, 
further  platelet  counts  are  required  to  rule  out  pseudothrombocytopenia.  Discontinue  unfractionated 
heparin. In patients undergoing PCI, measure the ACT also. 
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains 34.5 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 1.7% of the WHO recommended 
maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.  
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Warfarin and dipyridamole 
Eptifibatide did not appear to increase the risk of major and minor bleeding associated with concomitant 
use of warfarin and dipyridamole. Eptifibatide -treated patients who had a prothrombin time (PT) > 14.5 
seconds and received warfarin concomitantly did not appear to be at an increased risk of bleeding. 
Eptifibatide and thrombolytic agents 
Data  are  limited  on  the  use  of  eptifibatide  in  patients  receiving  thrombolytic  agents.  There  was  no 
consistent evidence that eptifibatide increased the risk of major or minor bleeding associated with tissue 
plasminogen activator in either a PCI or an acute myocardial infarction study. Eptifibatide appeared to 
increase the risk of bleeding when administered with streptokinase in an acute myocardial infarction 
study.  The  combination  of  reduced  dose  tenecteplase  and  eptifibatide  compared  to  placebo  and 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
eptifibatide  significantly  increased  the  risk  of  both  major  and  minor  bleeding  when  administered 
concomitantly in an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction study. 
In an acute myocardial infarction study involving 181 patients, eptifibatide (in regimens up to a bolus 
injection of 180 microgram/kg, followed by an infusion up to 2 microgram/kg/min for up to 72 hours) 
was administered concomitantly with streptokinase (1.5 million units over 60 minutes). At the highest 
infusion rates (1.3 microgram/kg/min and 2.0 microgram/kg/min) studied, eptifibatide was associated 
with  an  increased  incidence  of  bleeding  and  transfusions  compared  to  the  incidence  seen  when 
streptokinase was given alone. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data from the use of eptifibatide in pregnant women. 
Animal  studies are insufficient  with respect  to effects  on  pregnancy,  embryonal/foetal  development, 
parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown.  
Eptifibatide Accord should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether eptifibatide is excreted in human milk. Interruption of breast-feeding during the 
treatment period is recommended. 
Fertility 
No human data on the effect of drug substance eptifibatide on fertility are available.  
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Not relevant, as Eptifibatide Accord is intended for use only in hospitalised patients. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
The  majority  of  adverse  reactions  experienced  by  patients  treated  with  eptifibatide  were  generally 
related to bleeding or to cardiovascular events that occur frequently in this patient population. 
Clinical Trials 
The  data  sources  used  to  determine  adverse  reaction  frequency  descriptors  included  two  phase  III 
clinical studies (PURSUIT and ESPRIT). These trials are briefly described below. 
PURSUIT: This was a randomized, double-blind evaluation of the efficacy and safety of eptifibatide 
versus placebo for reducing mortality and myocardial (re)infarction in patients with unstable angina or 
non-Q-wave myocardial infarction. 
ESPRIT:  This  was  a  double-blind,  multicentre,  randomized,  parallel-group,  placebo-controlled  trial 
evaluating the safety and efficacy of eptifibatide therapy in patients scheduled to undergo non-emergent 
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent implantation. 
In PURSUIT, bleeding and non-bleeding events were collected from hospital discharge to the 30 day 
visit. In ESPRIT, bleeding events were reported at 48 hours, and non-bleeding events were reported at 
30 days. While Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction TIMI bleeding criteria were used to categorize 
the incidence of major and minor bleeding in both the PURSUIT and the ESPRIT trials, PURSUIT data 
was collected within 30 days while ESPRIT data was limited to events within 48 hours or discharge, 
whichever came first. 
The undesirable effects are listed by system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are defined as very 
common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to< 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to 
< 1/1000);  very  rare  (< 1/10,000);  not  known  (cannot  be  estimated  from  available  data).  These  are 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
absolute  reporting  frequencies  without  taking  into  account  placebo  rates.  For  a  particular  adverse 
reaction, if data was available from both PURSUIT and ESPRIT, then the highest reported incidence 
was used to assign adverse reaction frequency. 
Note that causality has not been determined for all adverse reactions. 
Blood and Lymphatic System Disorder 
Very common 
Bleeding (major and minor bleeding including femoral artery access, 
CABG-related, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, retroperitoneal, 
intracranial, haematemesis, haematuria, oral/oropharyngeal, 
haemoglobin/haematocrit decreased and other). 
Thrombocytopenia. 
Uncommon 
Nervous System disorders 
Uncommon 
Cardiac Disorders 
Common 
Cerebral ischaemia. 
Cardiac arrest, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, 
congestive heart failure, atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation. 
Vascular Disorders 
Common 
Shock, hypotension, phlebitis. 
Cardiac arrest, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, and shock, which are commonly 
reported events from the PURSUIT trial, were events related to the underlying disease. 
Administration of eptifibatide is associated with an increase in major and minor bleeding as classified 
by the criteria of the TIMI study group. At the recommended therapeutic dose, as administered in the 
PURSUIT  trial  involving  nearly  11,000patients,  bleeding  was  the  most  common  complication 
encountered  during  eptifibatide  therapy.  The  most  common  bleeding  complications  were  associated 
with cardiac invasive procedures (coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)-related or at femoral artery 
access site). 
Minor  bleeding  was  defined  in  the  PURSUIT  trial  as  spontaneous  gross  haematuria,  spontaneous 
haematemesis, observed blood loss with a haemoglobin decrease of more than 3 g/dl, or a haemoglobin 
decrease  of  more  than  4  g/dl  in  the  absence  of  an  observed  bleeding  site.  During  treatment  with 
eptifibatide  in  this  study,  minor  bleeding  was  a  very  common  complication  (> 1/10,  or  13.1 %  for 
eptifibatide  versus  7.6 %  for  placebo).  Bleeding  events  were  more  frequent  in  patients  receiving 
concurrent heparin while undergoing PCI, when ACT exceeded 350 seconds (see section 4.4, heparin 
use). 
Major bleeding was defined in the PURSUIT trial as either an intracranial haemorrhage or a decrease in 
haemoglobin concentrations of more than 5 g/dl. Major bleeding was also very common and reported 
more frequently with eptifibatide than with placebo in the PURSUIT study (> 1/10 or 10.8 % versus 
9.3 %), but it was infrequent in the vast majority of patients who did not undergo CABG within 30 days 
of inclusion in the study. In patients undergoing CABG, the incidence of bleeding was not increased by 
eptifibatide compared to the patients treated with placebo. In the subgroup of patients undergoing PCI, 
major bleeding was observed commonly, in 9.7 % of eptifibatide -treated patients vs. 4.6 % of placebo-
treated patients. 
The incidence of severe or life threatening bleeding events with eptifibatide was 1.9 % compared to 
1.1 % with placebo. The need for blood transfusions was increased modestly by eptifibatide treatment 
(11.8 % versus 9.3 % for placebo). 
Changes during eptifibatide treatment result from its known pharmacological action, i.e., inhibition of 
platelet  aggregation.  Thus,  changes  in  laboratory  parameters  associated  with  bleeding  (e.g.  bleeding 
time) are common and expected. No apparent differences were observed between patients treated with 
eptifibatide or with placebo in values for liver function (SGOT/AST, SGPT/ALT, bilirubin, alkaline 
phosphatase) or renal function (serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen).

Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Very rare 
Anaphylactic reactions. 
Rash, application site disorders such as urticaria. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are 
asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
The experience in humans with overdose of eptifibatide is extremely limited. There was no indication 
of severe adverse reactions associated with administration of accidental large bolus doses, rapid infusion 
reported  as  overdose  or  large  cumulative  doses.  In  the  PURSUIT  trial,  there  were  9  patients  who 
received bolus and/or infusion doses more than double the recommended dose, or who were identified 
by the investigator as having received an overdose. There was no excessive bleeding in any of these 
patients, although one patient undergoing CABG surgery was reported as having had a moderate bleed. 
Specifically, no patients experienced an intracranial bleed. 
Potentially, an overdose of eptifibatide could result in bleeding. Because of its short half-life and rapid 
clearance, the activity of eptifibatide may be halted readily by discontinuing the infusion. Thus, although 
eptifibatide can be dialysed, the need for dialysis is unlikely.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agent (platelet aggregation inhibitors excl. heparin), ATC 
code: B01AC16 
Mechanism of action 
Eptifibatide, a synthetic cyclic heptapeptide containing six amino acids, including one cysteine amide 
and  one  mercaptopropionyl  (desamino  cysteinyl)  residue,  is  an  inhibitor  of  platelet  aggregation  and 
belongs to the class of RGD (arginine-glycine-aspartate)-mimetics. 
Eptifibatide  reversibly  inhibits  platelet  aggregation  by  preventing  the  binding  of  fibrinogen,  von 
Willebrand factor and other adhesive ligands to the glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptors. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Eptifibatide  inhibits  platelet  aggregation  in  a  dose-  and  concentration-dependent  manner  as 
demonstrated by ex vivo platelet aggregation using adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and other agonists to 
induce platelet aggregation. The effect of eptifibatide is observed immediately after administration of a 
180 microgram/kg intravenous bolus. When followed by a 2.0 microgram/kg/min continuous infusion, 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
this regimen produces a > 80 % inhibition of ADP-induced ex vivo platelet aggregation, at physiologic 
calcium concentrations, in more than 80 % of patients. 
Platelet  inhibition  was  readily  reversed,  with  a  return  of  platelet  function  towards  baseline  (>  50 % 
platelet  aggregation)  4  hours  after  stopping  a  continuous  infusion  of  2.0  microgram/kg/min. 
Measurements  of  ADP-induced  ex  vivo  platelet  aggregation  at  physiologic  calcium  concentrations 
(Dphenylalanyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine  chloromethyl  ketone  anticoagulant)  in  patients  presenting  with 
unstable angina and Non Q-Wave Myocardial Infarction showed a concentration-dependent inhibition 
with an IC50 (50 % inhibitory concentration) of approximately 550 ng/ml and an IC80 (80 % inhibitory 
concentration) of approximately 1,100 ng/ml. 
There is limited data with regards to platelet inhibition in patients with renal impairment. In patients 
with moderate renal impairment, (creatinine clearance 30 - 50 ml/min) 100 % inhibition was achieved 
at 24 hours following administration of 2 microgram/kg/min. In patients with severe renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) administered 1microgram/kg/min , 80 % inhibition was achieved in 
more than 80 % of patients at 24 hours. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
PURSUIT trial 
The pivotal clinical trial for Unstable Angina (UA)/Non-Q Wave Myocardial Infarction (NQMI) was 
PURSUIT.  This  study  was  a  726-center,  27-country,  double-blind,  randomised,  placebo-controlled 
study  in  10,948  patients  presenting  with  UA  or  NQMI.  Patients  could  be  enrolled  only  if  they  had 
experienced cardiac ischemia at rest ( 10 minutes) within the previous 24 hours and had: 
 
either ST-segment changes: ST depression > 0.5 mm of less than 30 minutes or persistent ST 
elevation > 0.5 mm not requiring reperfusion therapy or thrombolytic agents, T-wave 
inversion (> 1 mm), 
  or increased CK-MB. 
Patients  were  randomised  to  either  placebo,  eptifibatide  180 microgram/kg  bolus  followed  by  a 
2.0 microgram/kg/min  infusion  (180/2.0),  or  eptifibatide  180 microgram/kg  bolus  followed  by  a 
1.3 microgram/kg/min infusion (180/1.3). 
The infusion was continued until hospital discharge, until the time of coronary artery bypass grafting 
(CABG) or for up to 72 hours, whichever occurred first. If PCI was performed, the eptifibatide infusion 
was continued for 24 hours after the procedure, allowing for a duration of infusion up to 96 hours. 
The 180/1.3 arm was stopped after an interim analysis, as prespecified in the protocol, when the two 
active-treatment arms appeared to have a similar incidence of bleeding. 
Patients  were  managed  according  to  the  usual  standards  of  the  investigational  site;  frequencies  of 
angiography, PCI and CABG therefore differed widely from site to site and from country to country. Of 
the  patients  in  PURSUIT,  13 %  were  managed  with  PCI  during  eptifibatide  infusion,  of  whom 
approximately 50 % received intracoronary stents; 87 % were managed medically (without PCI during 
eptifibatide infusion). 
The vast majority of patients received acetylsalicylic acid (75-325 mg once daily). 
Unfractionated heparin was administered intravenously or subcutaneously at the physician’s discretion, 
most commonly as an intravenous bolus of 5,000 U followed by a continuous infusion of 1,000 U/h. A 
target aPTT of 50-70 seconds was recommended. A total of 1,250 patients underwent PCI within 72 
hours after randomisation, in which case they received intravenous unfractionated heparin to maintain 
an activated clotting time (ACT) of 300-350 seconds. 
The primary endpoint of the study was the occurrence of death from any cause or new myocardial 
infarction (MI) (evaluated by a blinded Clinical Events Committee) within 30 days of randomisation. 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The component MI could be defined as asymptomatic with enzymatic elevation of CK-MB or new Q 
wave. 
Compared to placebo, eptifibatide administered as 180/2.0 significantly reduced the incidence of the 
primary endpoint events (table 1): this represents around 15 events avoided for 1,000 patients treated:

a: Pearson’s chi-square test of difference between placebo and eptifibatide. 
Results on the primary endpoint were principally attributed to the occurrence of myocardial infarction. 
The reduction in the incidence of endpoint events in patients receiving eptifibatide appeared early during 
treatment (within the first 72-96 hours) and this reduction was maintained through 6 months, without 
any significant effect on mortality. 
Patients most likely to benefit from eptifibatide treatment are those at high risk of developing 
myocardial infarction within the first 3-4 days after onset of acute angina. 
According to epidemiological findings, a higher incidence of cardiovascular events has been 
associated with certain indicators, for instance: 
-   age 
-   elevated heart rate or blood pressure 
-   persistent or recurrent ischemic cardiac pain 
-   marked ECG changes (in particular ST-segment abnormalities) 
-   raised cardiac enzymes or markers (e.g. CK-MB, troponins) and 
-   heart failure 
PURSUIT was conducted at a time when the standard of care of managing acute coronary syndromes 
was  different  from  that  of  present  times  in  terms  of  thienopyridine  use  and  the  routine  use  of 
intracoronary stents. 
ESPRIT trial 
ESPRIT  (Enhanced  Suppression  of  the  Platelet  IIb/IIIa  Receptor  with  eptifibatide  Therapy)  was  a 
double-blind,  randomised,  placebo-controlled  trial  (n=  2,064)  for  nonurgent  PCI  with  intracoronary 
stenting. 
All patients received routine standard of care and were randomised to either placebo or eptifibatide (2 
bolus doses of 180 microgram/kg and a continuous infusion until discharge from hospital or a maximum 
of 18-24 hours). 
The first bolus and the infusion were started simultaneously, immediately before the PCI procedure and 
were  followed  by  a  second  bolus  10  minutes  after  the  first.  The  rate  of  infusion  was  2.0 
microgram/kg/min for patients with serum creatinine ≤ 175 micromols/l or 1.0 microgram/kg/min for 
serum creatinine > 175 up to 350 micromols/l. 
In the eptifibatide arm of the trial, virtually all patients received aspirin (99.7 %), and 98.1 % received 
a  thienopyridine,  (clopidogrel  in  95.4  %  and  ticlopidine  in  2.7  %).  On  the  day  of  PCI,  prior  to 
catheterization, 53.2 % received a thienopyridine (clopidogrel 52.7 %; ticlopidine 0.5 %) – mostly as a 
loading dose (300 mg or more). The placebo arm was comparable (aspirin 99.7 %, clopidogrel 95.9 %, 
ticlopidin 2.6 %). 
The ESPRIT trial used a simplified regimen of heparin during PCI that consisted of an initial bolus of 
60 units/kg, with a target ACT of 200 - 300 seconds. The primary endpoint of the trial was death (D), 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MI, urgent target vessel revascularisation (UTVR), and acute antithrombotic rescue with GP IIb/IIIa 
inhibitor therapy (RT) within 48 hours of randomisation. 
MI was identified per the CK-MB core laboratory criteria. For this diagnosis, within 24 hours after the 
index PCI procedure, there had to be at least two CK-MB values ≥ 3 x the upper limit of normal; thus, 
validation by the CEC was not required. MI could also be reported following CEC adjudication of an 
investigator report. 
The primary endpoint analysis [quadruple composite of death, MI, urgent target vessel revascularisation 
(UTVR)  and  thrombolytic  bail-out  (TBO)  at  48  hours]  showed  a  37  %  relative  and  3.9  %  absolute 
reduction in the eptifibatide group (6.6 % events versus 10.5 %, p = 0.0015). Results on the primary 
endpoint  were  mainly  attributed  to  the  reduction  of  enzymatic  MI  occurrence,  identified  as  the 
occurrence of early elevation of cardiac enzymes after PCI (80 out of 92 MIs in the placebo group vs. 
47  out  of  56  MIs  in  the  eptifibatide  group).  The  clinical  relevance  of  such  enzymatic  MIs  is  still 
controversial. 
Similar results were also obtained for the 2 secondary endpoints assessed at 30 days: a triple composite 
of death, MI and UTVR, and the more robust combination of death and MI. 
The reduction in the incidence of endpoint events in patients receiving eptifibatide appeared early during 
treatment. There was no increased benefit thereafter, up to 1 year. 
Prolongation of bleeding time 
Administration  of  eptifibatide  by  intravenous  bolus  and  infusion  causes  up  to  a  5-fold  increase  in 
bleeding  time. This increase  is readily  reversible upon  discontinuation  of the  infusion  with  bleeding 
times returning towards baseline in approximately 6 (2-8) hours. When administered alone, eptifibatide 
has no measurable effect on prothrombin time (PT) or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). 
EARLY-ACS trial 
EARLY  ACS  (Early  Glycoprotein  IIb/IIIa  Inhibition  in  Non-ST-segment  Elevation  Acute  Coronary 
Syndrome) was a study of early routine eptifibatide versus placebo (with delayed provisional use of 
eptifibatide in the catheterization laboratory) used in combination with antithrombotic therapies (ASA, 
UFH,  bivalirudin,  fondaparinux  or  low  molecular  weight  heparin),  in  subjects  with  high-risk  NSTE 
ACS. Patients were to undergo an invasive strategy for further management after receiving study drug 
for  12  to  96  hours.  Patients  could  be  medically  managed,  proceed  to  coronary  artery  bypass  graft 
(CABG), or undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Unlike the approved posology in the 
EU, the study used a double bolus of study drug (separated by 10 minutes) before the infusion. 
Early routine eptifibatide in this high-risk NSTE-ACS optimally-treated population who were managed 
with an invasive strategy did not result in a statistically significant reduction in the composite primary 
endpoint of rate of death, MI, RI-UR, and TBO within 96 hours compared with a regimen of delayed 
provisional eptifibatide (9.3 % in early eptifibatide patients vs. 10.0 % in patients assigned to delayed 
provisional  eptifibatide;  odds  ratio=0.920;  95 %  CI=0.802-1.055;  p=0.234).  GUSTO  severe/life 
threatening  bleeding  was  uncommon  and  comparable  in  both  treatment  groups  (0.8 %).  GUSTO 
moderate  or  severe/life  threatening  bleeding  occurred  significantly  more  often  with  early  routine 
eptifibatide (7.4 % vs. 5.0 % in delayed provisional eptifibatide group; p <0.001). Similar differences 
were noted for TIMI major haemorrhage (118 [2.5 %] in early routine use vs. 83 [1.8 %] in delayed 
provisional use; p=0.016). 
No  statistically  significant  benefit  of  early  routine  eptifibatide  strategy  was  demonstrated  in  the 
subgroup of patients who were managed medically or during the medical management periods prior to 
PCI or CABG. 
In  a  post  hoc  analysis  of  the  EARLY  ACS  trial  the  risk  benefit  of  dose  reduction  in  patients  with 
moderate renal impairment is inconclusive. The primary endpoint event rate was 11.9 % in patients who 
received a reduced dose (1microgram/kg/min) vs 11.2 % in patients who received the standard dose 
(2 microgram/kg/min) when eptifibatide was administered in the early routine fashion (p=0.81). With 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
delayed provisional eptifibatide administration, the event rates were 10 % vs 11.5 % in patients who 
received reduced dose and standard dose respectively (p=0.61). TIMI major bleeding occurred in 2.7 % 
of patients who received a reduced dose (1microgram/kg/min) vs 4.2 % of patients who received the 
standard dose (2 microgram/kg/min) when eptifibatide was administered in the early routine fashion 
(p=0.36). With delayed provisional eptifibatide administration, the TIMI major events were 1.4 % vs 
2.0 % in patients who received reduced dose and standard dose respectively (p=0.54).There were no 
notable differences observed with GUSTO severe bleeding rates. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
The pharmacokinetics of eptifibatide are linear and dose proportional for bolus doses ranging from 90 
to 250 microgram/kg and infusion rates from 0.5 to 3.0 microgram/kg/min.  
Distribution 
For a 2.0 microgram/kg/min infusion, mean steady-state plasma eptifibatide concentrations range from 
1.5  to  2.2  microgram/ml  in  patients  with  coronary  artery  disease.  These  plasma  concentrations  are 
achieved rapidly when the infusion is preceded by an 180microgram/kg bolus.   
Biotransformation 
The  extent  of  eptifibatide  binding  to  human  plasma  protein  is  about  25  %.  In  the  same  population, 
plasma elimination half-life is approximately 2.5 hours, plasma clearance 55 to 80 ml/kg/hr and volume 
of distribution of approximately 185 to 260 ml/kg. 
Elimination 
In  healthy  subjects,  renal  excretion  accounted  for  approximately  50 %  of  total  body  clearance; 
approximately 50 % of the amount cleared is excreted unchanged. In patients with moderate to severe 
renal  insufficiency  (creatinine  clearance  <  50 ml/min),  the  clearance  of  eptifibatide  is  reduced  by 
approximately 50 % and steady-state plasma levels are approximately doubled. 
No  formal  pharmacokinetic  interaction  studies  have  been  conducted.  However,  in  a  population 
pharmacokinetic study there was no evidence of a pharmacokinetic interaction between eptifibatide and 
the  following  concomitant  medicinal  products:  amlodipine,  atenolol,  atropine,  captopril,  cefazolin, 
diazepam,  digoxin,  diltiazem,  diphenhydramine,  enalapril,  fentanyl,  furosemide,  heparin,  lidocaine, 
lisinopril, metoprolol, midazolam, morphine, nitrates, nifedipine, and warfarin. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Toxicology studies conducted with eptifibatide include single and repeated dose studies in the rat, rabbit 
and monkey, reproduction studies in the rat and rabbit, in vitro and in vivo genetic toxicity studies, and 
irritation, hypersensitivity and antigenicity studies. No unexpected toxic effects for an agent with this 
pharmacologic profile were observed and findings were predictive of clinical experience, with bleeding 
effects being the principal adverse event. No genotoxic effects were observed with eptifibatide. 
Teratology studies have been performed by continuous intravenous infusion of eptifibatide in pregnant 
rats at total daily doses of up to 72 mg/kg/day (about 4 times the recommended maximum daily human 
dose on a body surface area basis) and in pregnant rabbits at total daily doses of up to 36 mg/kg/day 
(about  4  times  the  recommended  maximum  daily  human  dose  on  a  body  surface  area  basis).  These 
studies revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the foetus due to eptifibatide. 
Reproduction studies in animal species where eptifibatide shows a similar pharmacologic activity as in 
humans  are  not  available.  Consequently  these  studies  are  not  suitable  to  evaluate  the  toxicity  of 
eptifibatide on reproductive function (see section 4.6). 
The carcinogenic potential of eptifibatide has not been evaluated in long-term studies.

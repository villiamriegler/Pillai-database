Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for cobicistat / elvitegravir / 
emtricitabine / tenofovir alafenamide, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Based on two reports received of altered mental state with impairment in speech, gait, tremor although 
with limited information (both reporting potential cobicistat FDC and lurasidone interaction), a 
contraindication with lurasidone due to CYP3A inhibition with cobicistat was identified in medicinal 
products containing cobicistat / elvitegravir / emtricitabine / tenofovir alafenamide and therefore the 
PRAC agreed that the product information should be updated accordingly.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for cobicistat / elvitegravir / emtricitabine / tenofovir 
alafenamide, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product 
containing cobicistat / elvitegravir / emtricitabine / tenofovir alafenamide is unchanged subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation should be varied.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Mucopolysaccharidosis  type  IV,  Morquio  A  syndrome  (MPS  IVA)  is  a  rare,  inherited  disorder 
caused by mutations of the gene that codes for the lysosomal enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine-
Assessment report  
EMA/357933/2014 
Page 10/65 
 
  
  
 
 
6-sulfatase (GALNS), which is an enzyme that degrades glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) including 
keratan  sulfate  (KS)  and  chondroitin-6-sulfate.  With  insufficient  GALNS,  GAGs  progressively 
accumulate in multiple body organs and tissues.  
The  most  common  features  of  patients  with  MPS  IVA  are  progressive  skeletal  dysplasia, 
frequent surgical procedures mostly related to musculoskeletal or respiratory dysfunction and 
a significant limitation in mobility, endurance, and respiratory function. Many patients end up 
using scooters, wheelchairs or other devices by their teen years. All patients have a profound 
skeletal  dysplasia,  which  commonly  results  in  severe  short  stature  and  malformations  of 
knees,  chest,  and  spine.  The  skeletal  dysplasia,  short  stature,  and  joint  abnormalities 
contribute  to  patient’s  restricted  mobility.  Patients  may  also  experience  both  restrictive  lung 
disease  due  to  thoracic  deformity  and  obstructive  disease  due  to  laryngeal  narrowing  and 
tracheal and bronchial abnormalities. These mechanical impediments often result in dyspnoea 
and recurrent respiratory infections, and potentially progress to respiratory failure. Additional 
symptoms  include  hearing  loss,  cataracts,  corneal  clouding,  and  heart  valve  disease,  among 
others.  Survival  in  patients  with  rapidly  progressing  phenotypes  is  limited  to  the  second  or 
third decade of life. Rarely, patients with slowly progressing forms of the disorder have been 
reported to survive beyond 60 years. Mortality commonly occurs due to cardio-respiratory or 
central  nervous  system  complications  (i.e.  spinal/cervical  cord  compression  [SCC]). 
Obstructive  and  restrictive  lung  disease  predisposes  patients  to  developing  fatal  pneumonia 
and respiratory failure. Regardless of rate of disease progression, all patients have serious and 
debilitating morbidities. 
MPS IVA is a rare disorder, with incidence estimated to range from 1 in 76,000 to 1 in 640,000 
live  births  in  different  populations.  For  the  purposes  of  European  Union  (EU)  Orphan 
Designation, the mean prevalence was estimated to be 0.06 in 10,000 live births, which leads 
to  an  approximation  of  1300  MPS  IVA  patients  in  the  EU.  There  is  currently  no  standard 
accepted  or  otherwise  authorised  treatment  for  MPS  IVA  in  the  EU  or  in  any  other  country 
other  than  supportive  care.  Limited  experience  indicates  that  bone  marrow  transplantation 
(BMT)  has  not  resulted  in  improvement  in  biochemical  or  clinical  disease  manifestation. 
Supportive  care  has  included  both  medications  and  surgical  interventions.  Nonsteroidal  anti-
inflammatory drugs have been administered for joint pain, antibiotics for pulmonary infection, 
and  oxygen  supplementation  for  pulmonary  compromise  and  obstructive  sleep  apnoea. 
Surgical interventions include cervical spine fusion or decompression, femoral osteotomies for 
straightening of the legs, and corrective knee surgery for severe genu valgum deformity. 
Enzyme  replacement  therapy  (ERT)  with  recombinant  human  N-acetylgalactosamine-6-
sulfatase (rhGALNS, elosulfase alfa) is a potential new treatment option for patients with MPS 
IVA.  Elosulfase  alfa  is  administered  by  intravenous  infusion,  allowing  cellular  uptake  by  the 
mannose  6  phosphate  receptor  and  translocation  to  lysosomes.  Elosulfase  alfa  is  a 
recombinant form of human N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase (rhGALNS), and is identical to 
the naturally occurring human lysosomal enzyme in terms of the amino acid sequence and N-
linked  glycosylation  sites.  The  uptake  of  acetylgalactosamine  into  lysosomes  is  most  likely 
mediated  by  the  binding  of  mannose-6-phosphate-terminated  oligosaccharide  chains  of  N-
acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase  to  the  cation-independent  mannose-6-phosphate  receptor 
(CI-M6PR). The rationale for elosulfase alfa therapy is to increase the catabolism of KS in MPS 
IVA affected tissues by providing exogenous enzyme. No elosulfase alfa degradative effects on 
Assessment report

other GAGs or on KS outside of the lysosomal compartment are anticipated due to the lack of 
elosulfase  alfa  activity  at  physiological  pH,  its  CI-M6PR-targeted  delivery  to  the  lysosomal 
compartment. 
The indication for Vimizim, as applied for by the applicant is: 
Vimizim  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  mucopolysaccharidosis,  type  IVA  (Morquio  A 
Syndrome, MPS IVA). 
The indication for Vimizim, as adopted by the CHMP is: 
Vimizim  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  mucopolysaccharidosis,  type  IVA  (Morquio  A 
Syndrome, MPS IVA) in patients of all ages. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The  active  substance  recombinant  human  N–acetylgalactosamine  6–sulfatase  (rhGALNS, 
elosulfase  alfa)  is  a  single-chain  glycosylated  enzyme  involved  in  the  lysosomal  degradation  of 
the  glycosaminoglycans  (GAGs)  keratan  sulfate  (primary  natural  substrate),  chondroitin  sulfate 
and dermatan sulfate. As elosulfase alfa is an exohydrolase, it does not hydrolyse sulfate groups 
internal to  GAG  chains.  Complete  degradation of  keratan  sulfate  in the lysosome  requires  other 
lysosomal  enzymes.  An  absence  of  these  hydrolytic  enzymes  results  in  the  abnormal  lysosomal 
accumulation  of  unhydrolysable  GAGs.  Elosulfase  alfa  is  taken  up  and  translocated  to  the 
lysosomes by target cells through the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor. 
Elosulfase  alfa  contains  eight  cysteine  residues,  six  of  which  are  involved  in  intramolecular 
disulfide bridges. One cysteine residue is unpaired. The last cysteine residue (C53) resides in the 
active  site;  it  is  post-translationally  modified  to  formylglycine  iin  the  endoplasmic  reticulum  of 
the  production  cell.  The  presence  of  formylglycine  is  a  necessary  condition  for  the  sulfatase 
activity of elosulfase alfa. 
Elosulfase alfa contains two consensus N-glycosylation sites (N178 and N397). The predominant 
glycans are mannose structures with or without phosphorylation. 
Elosulfase alfa is produced in a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line transfected with rhGALNS 
cDNA and secreted as the mature monomer (496-amino acid protein, 55.4 kDa), which 
spontaneously forms a non-covalent dimer in solution. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Manufacture 
The  active  substance  is  manufactured  at  BioMarin  Pharmaceutical,  Inc.,  Galli  Drive  Facility,  46 
Galli Drive, Novato, CA 94949, USA. 
Development genetics 
The elosulfase alfa- cell bank used in the manufacture was derived from a CHO-K1 cell line.  
The expression plasmid was constructed using the cDNA of rhGALNS and fused with the human 
cytomegalovirus promoter and selection was provided with a resistance marker.  
Following transfection in the host cell line, a stable pool was generated by selection and the pool 
was limited-dilution cloned for single cell clones producing elosulfase alfa. One clone was selected 
Assessment report  
EMA/357933/2014 
Page 12/65 
 
  
  
 
 
 
from the stable clones based upon titer and viability, and was selected to use in creation of the 
master  cell  bank  (MCB).  The  resistance  marker  was  removed  from  the  culture  process  prior  to 
preparation of the development bank, and was not utilised during generation of the MCB. 
Cell banking system 
A  two-tiered  cell  banking  system  of  MCB  and  Working  Cell  Bank  (WCB)  was  developed  and 
maintained in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and ICH guidelines. 
The MCB  was prepared from a single vial of the research bank stored in liquid nitrogen. WCB-1 
was prepared using the same methodology as the MCB. Procedures followed for the preparation 
of  the  MCB,  WCB  were  described.  An  extensive  range  of  tests  was  performed  for  their 
characterisation, in accordance to ICH guidelines, including identity, viability, stability, presence 
of adventitious agents. 
Fermentation process 
Frozen  cells  from the  MCB  or  WCB  are  thawed  and  inoculated  into  cell  culture  flasks  containing 
growth media.   
When  the  target  density  is  reached,  a  series  of  expansion  steps  is  initiated.    Bioreactors  are 
inoculated  according  to  a  parallel  or  sequential  seeding  procedure.    When  the  target  density  is 
reached,  the  harvested  cell  culture  fluid  (HCCF)  is  collected,  sampled  for  analysis,  and  stored 
until the first step of the purification process is initiated. 
Purification process 
RhGALNS  is  purified  in  a  sequence  of  chromatography,  viral  inactivation  and  filtration,  and 
ultrafiltration/diafiltration steps.  
Formulation to 3 mg/mL for frozen storage (≤-25 ºC) of the bulk active substance (BDS) can be 
used  as  an  optional  hold  step.  The  BDS  is  thawed  when  needed  for  further  processing  and 
adjusted to a concentration of 1 mg/mL, producing the formulated bulk active substance (FBDS). 
Alternatively, the process fluid may be formulated directly to FBDS. 
The FBDS is stored at 2–8 °C. The FBDS containers are shipped to the fill site under cold chain 
conditions using a validated shipping configuration. 
Although this dossier is not considered as a Quality by Design application, certain elements of an 
enhanced approach were applied. Controls of critical steps and intermediates are achieved 
through process monitoring and in process testing. The control strategy is traditional and was 
developed around the critical quality attributes (CQAs) which were defined for elosulfase alfa and 
roughly comprise all test parameters of the FBDS specification. A systematic process 
characterisation risk assessment (PCRA) approach was used to evaluate the risk for each 
particular step in the process, linking process variables with their failure mode if operated outside 
the normal operating ranges (NORs) or proven acceptable ranges (PARs), their current control 
and the inherent control capability, classification as critical process parameter/key process 
parameter (CPP/KPP) or process parameter, potential impact on CQAs, the resulting risk 
prioritisation, justification, and if applicable, any additional process characterisation studies 
required.  
The Applicant has identified KPPs and CPPs as follows:  
-  KPPs  are  defined  as  process  parameters  for  which  operating  outside of  the  proven  acceptable 
range  will  have  an  impact  on  the  manufacturing  process  (i.e.  yield,  process  time,  throughput) 
but will not directly impact product quality. 
-  CPPs  are  parameters  for  which  operating  outside  of  the  proven  acceptable  range  will  have  a 
direct  impact  to  product  quality  attributes  (e.g.  bioreactor  temperature,  intermediate  hold 
times). 
Other parameters are also considered for monitoring of the manufacturing process.

The process experience leading to establishing the PARs of S.2.2 and S.2.4 originates from 
various levels such as in-depth process characterisation studies, manufacturing experience from 
the clinical and commercial scale phase, parallel small scale validation studies representative of 
the process, and process experience from a similar BioMarin-process where applicable. For 
particular process variables the PARs were directly derived from the manufacturing campaigns in 
2010 and 2011, while PARs may have additionally been enlarged based on further process 
characterisation studies/range-finding studies, small scale validation studies and experience 
taken over from the similar process. 
Process validation 
Satisfactory validation data have been provided for three qualification lots manufactured at the 
Galli site with the current commercial process. Validation studies were designed to demonstrate 
the acceptability, robustness and reproducibility of the defined manufacturing process. 
Manufacturing process development 
The active substance is manufactured using a standard fermentation and purification process.  A 
number of changes were made during product development, which can be grouped in four 
categories: 
- Cell culture: the cell culture process was scaled up prior to Phase 3, and adapted to the planned 
commercial process. A WCB was introduced. 
- Purification: modifications were made to the purification process, including optimisation of 
chromatography steps, increasing the diameters of the chromatography columns, and 
optimisation of storage conditions for 3 mg/mL BDS. 
Formulation: the formulation was optimised after Phase 1/2 to enhance product stability. 
Facility: the process was moved to the commercial facility during Phase 3 manufacture. 
Characterisation 
The protein and carbohydrate structure, potency, strength and purity of clinical and commercial 
lots of elosulfase alfa have been characterised, and these data have been presented. 
1. Elucidation of structure and other characteristics: 
The protein and carbohydrate structure, potency, strength and purity of clinical and commercial 
lots of elosulfase alfa have been characterised, and these data have been presented. 
1.1. Physicochemical characterisation: 
Protein structure 
Molecular  mass  of  the  glycosylated  protein  was  determined  by  electrospray  ionisation  time  of 
flight mass spectrometry (ESI-TOF MS).  
SEC-HPLC  and  multi-angle  laser  light  scattering  (MALLS)  further  supported  the  findings  that 
elosulfase alfa is in a dimeric form in solution. 
The primary structure of elosulfase alfa was confirmed by peptide mapping. Peptide maps were 
also  prepared  without  prior  reduction  and  alkylation  in  order  to  confirm  the  three  disulphide 
bridges in the elosulfase alfa molecule. 
The  N-terminal  amino  acid  sequence    of  elosulfase  alfa  has  been  identified  by  Edman 
degradation.  The  observed  major  sequence  is  consistent  with  the  expected  primary  structure. 
One truncated N-terminal variant was identified. On the basis of the arguments provided by the 
Applicant, it was considered unlikely that the observed degree of truncation would affect clinical 
safety or efficacy of the product.   
The  evaluation  of  charge  heterogeneity,  primarily  determined  by  the  glycosylation  of  elosulfase 
alfa, was performed.   
Assessment report  
EMA/357933/2014 
Page 14/65 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Determination of disulphide linkages demonstrated the presence of three disulphide bridges and 
one free sulphydryl per polypeptide chain. The results are consistent with the crystal structure of 
elosulfase alfa. 
Structural  characterisation  also  included  peptide  mapping,  C-terminal  sequence  identification, 
circular dichrosim spectroscopy, and analytical ultracentrifugation. 
Glycosylation 
The  consistency  of  occupancy  of  the  two  consensus  N-glycosylation  sites  (N178  and  N397)  was 
assessed by both peptide mapping (testing for unmodified peptides containing the glycosylation 
site) and using ESI-TOF MS. 
Phosphorylation  and  mannose  content  of  the  glycans  was  assessed.    The  dominant  glycans 
attached  to  elosulfase  alfa  are  BisP-Man7  and  BisP-Man6  and  non-phosphorylated  mannose-9 
(Man9)  and  Man8.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  phosphorylated  mannose  glycans  are 
attached to N178, while the neutral mannose glycans are attached to N397. 
Monosaccharide  composition  analysis  using  hydrolysis  was  also  used  to  determine  if  any 
monosaccharide  other  than  mannose  and  N-acetylglucosamine  can  be  detected.  This  confirmed 
that predominantly high mannose structures are attached to elosulfase alfa. 
The oligosaccharide profile analysis did not detect any complex or hybrid glycans or other sialic 
acid containing glycans in elosulfase alfa lots. Results show the same dominant glycans for both 
the Phase 1/2 and Phase 3 lots tested. 
Other data were used to characterise the elosulfase alfa molecule. 
1.2. Biological characterisation: 
Activity  of  elosulfase  alfa  is  measured  using  an  HPLC  method  using  D-galactose-6-sulfate  (Gal-
6S)  as  the  substrate.  The  assay  was  also  utilized  to  characterise  the  kinetic  parameters  of  the 
enzymatic activity.  
Activity is also measured by monitoring the level of formylglycine conversion. 
Cellular uptake of elosulfase alfa was measured.  
2. Impurities 
Detection and quantification of host cell proteins (HCPs) was performed. 
DNA was measured in the eluate of the chromatography step known to remove DNA. DNA levels 
were below the limit of detection for all samples demonstrating consistency of DNA clearance. 
Other potential process-related impurities were investigated. 
Specification 
Specifications  were  provided  for  the  formulated  active  substance  and  pooled  FBDS.  FBDS  lots 
may  be  pooled  or processed  as  individual  lots.  Each  FBDS  lot  must  meet  release  specifications, 
prior to pooling. After pooling the pooled lot must meet all FBDS pooled release specifications. 
Qualification  data  for  the  reference  material  used  to  date  including  release  as  well  as 
characterisation  data  were  submitted.  Preparation  and  qualification  of  established  and  future 
reference materials is sufficiently described.  
Stability 
The  Applicant  has  performed  real-time  and  accelerated  stability  studies  designed  in  accordance 
with  ICH  guidelines  to  monitor  the  time–temperature  stability  of  cGMP  lots.  The  characteristics 
included in stability testing were chosen based on method validation results and characterisation

studies.  The  appropriateness  of  the  methods  for  indicating  the  stability  of  elosulfase  alfa  FBDS 
has been further supported by forced-degradation studies. The active substance is stored either 
as FBDS (1 mg/ml) or BDS (3 mg/ml). 
For  FBDS,  the  Applicant  claims  shelf  life  of  12  months  when  stored  at  long-term  (5±3°C) 
conditions.  For  the  stability  batches  the  storage  conditions  included  are  5±3°C,  25°C/  60%  RH 
and 40 °C/ 75% RH for study durations of up to 24 months. 
For  FBDS,  12  months  stability  when  stored  at  long-term  (5±3°C)  conditions  are  currently 
concluded.  
Based on the studies provided, the proposed storage time of the BDS intermediate of 36 months 
at ≤ -25°C can be accepted.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product, referred to as  elosulfase alfa, is a sterile solution for infusion, packaged in 
a  container  closure  system  consisting  of  a  Type  1  borosilicate  glass  tubing  vial,  butyl  rubber 
stopper  and  aluminium  seal  with  flip  off  cap.  Each  vial  is  filled  to  a  target  volume  of  5.3  mL  of 
solution, which allows the withdrawal of 5.0 mL deliverable volume.  Elosulfase alfais formulated 
with  a  target  pH  of  5.4.  The  visual  appearance  of  the  finished  product  is  clear  to  slightly 
opalescent, and colorless to pale yellow.  
The active substance is formulated with sodium acetate trihydrate, sodium phosphate monobasic 
monohydrate, L-arginine hydrochloride, sorbitol, polysorbate 20 and water for injections. All the 
excipients meet Ph. Eur. requirements.  
For administration to patients, elosulfase alfa is diluted with 9 mg/mL (0.9%) sodium chloride 
solution. 
formulation  was  selected  based  on 
The  commercial 
the  results  of  pre-formulation 
characterisation  studies  conducted  to  enhance  elosulfase  alfa  stability  by  optimising  pH  and 
buffer composition. The commercial formulation was initially implemented in the pivotal Phase 3 
and extension studies. 
The  container  closure  system  was  selected  based  on  demonstrated  compatibility  with  the  liquid 
formulation. The vials and stoppers meet Ph. Eur. requirements.  
Adventitious agents 
Potential  adventitious  agent  contamination  in  elosulfase  alfa  finished  product  is  controlled 
through  appropriate  sourcing  and  screening  of  raw  materials,  testing  of  the  cell  banks, 
appropriate cleaning, and a robust system of inactivation, removal, and in-process testing during 
the  manufacturing  process.  The  controls,  precautions,  testing,  and  demonstrated  clearance  of 
multiple  virus  types  in  the  manufacturing  process  collectively  demonstrate  that  the  elosulfase 
alfa  manufacturing  process  is  robust  and  reproducible,  and  provides  adequate  protection  of 
elosulfase alfa FBDS against contamination by adventitious agents. 
Elosulfase alfa finished product does not contain any animal-derived ingredients. Polysorbate 20 
is used as a stabiliser, and is vegetable derived. 
Virus  removal  studies  were  performed  for  the  elosulfase  alfa  manufacturing  process.  The 
combination  of  steps  evaluated  for  each  model  virus  demonstrates  that  the  manufacturing 
process  provides  separate  methods  and  mechanisms  for  viral  clearance.  The  column 
chromatography, membrane chromatography and filtration steps evaluated provide clearance by 
removal of virus, while the low pH step provides clearance by inactivation.

Manufacture of the product 
The finished product is manufactured at Vetter Pharma-Fertigung GmbH & Co. KG, Germany. 
The solution is sterile filtered as the FBDS is filled into the vials. Satisfactory validation data has 
been  provided  to  give  assurance  regarding  the  sterile  filtration,  filling,  and  capping  procedures.  
Media fill data support the aseptic process, and media fills are performed routinely. The fill facility 
is operated under cGMP. 
Product specification 
Most of the analytical methods are identical to those used for the active substance.  
All  tests  described  by  the  Ph.  Eur.  for  parenteral  solutions  are  included  in  the  specification. 
Specifications monitor quality attributes including identity, potency protein concentration, purity, 
and safety.  
A  number  of  finished  product  release  limits  were  calculated  based  on  a  combination  of  BDS, 
FBDS, and finished product results.  
Stability of the product 
Real-time  and  accelerated  stability  studies  were  initiated in  accordance  with  ICH  guidelines  and 
per  protocol  to  monitor  the  time-temperature  stability  of  cGMP  lots  of  elosulfase  alfa  drug 
product. For finished product manufactured at the originally qualified site, long term storage (5 ± 
3°C)  of  commercial  scale batch  data  (for  three  batches)  up  to  30  months  and  pilot  scale  batch 
data up to 36 months (one batch) are provided. For finished product manufactured at the more 
recently  qualified  fill  site,    long  term  storage  (5  ±  3°C)  of  commercial  scale  batch  data  (three 
batches) and pilot scale batch (one batch) data up to 12 months are provided.  
At  long  term  storage  all  batch  data  remain  within  the  pre-defined  acceptance  limits  of  the 
finished product shelf life specification. 
Based on the data provided, finished product stability is concluded to be 36 months when stored 
at 5 ± 3°C. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Active substance 
Origin, source, and history of the cells, characterisation and testing 
The generation of the host cell line and the cell banking system is described in satisfactory detail. 
Comprehensive information on the cloning and establishment of the master cell bank (MCB) and 
working cell bank (WCB) has been provided. The Applicant has adequately tested the MCB, WCB 
and end-of-production cells for identity and the absence of infectious extraneous agents. 
Manufacturing process  
The single steps of the active substance manufacturing process are adequately described.  
The  set  of  process  parameters  defined  throughout  the  manufacturing  process  covers  various 
levels and input control points and as such adequately addresses the process performance at the 
operational level and consequently ensures process consistency. 
Process validation 
The process validation data show, overall, that the process is running consistently regarding the 
parameters/attributes  investigated  resulting  in  FBDS  meeting  pre-defined  product  quality 
specifications and active substance comparability to reference and historical material.  
Validation data provided also support the pooling concept.  
Assessment report

The Applicant has provided adequate data from small scale and commercial scale to support the 
hold times. Validation studies were performed at small scale to confirm the chromatography resin 
use-life for each of the three chromatography resins with satisfactory results.  
Removal  of  impurities  has  adequately  been  demonstrated  and  is  ensured  through  in  process 
qualification studies, small-scale spiking studies and/or routine in process and release testing.  
Manufacturing process development 
All changes implemented to the manufacturing process were described with sufficient detail and 
supported by product comparability studies that ensured that the changes had no impact on the 
product characteristics. 
Characterisation 
A comprehensive characterisation has been performed by analytical evaluation of elosulfase alfa 
lots  representative  for  phase  1/2,  phase  3  and  commercial  manufacturing  process  at  the  BDS 
and the FBDS manufacturing stage. The selection of elosulfase alfa lots used for characterisation 
studies is considered appropriate. 
Control of active substance – specifications 
The choice of the test methods is adequate to verify the identity, heterogeneity, protein content, 
biological activity, purity, and formulation (including microbial control) of the active substance. A 
formal  specification  for  the  identity  has  been  added  for  pooled  FBDS.  A  number  of  limits  were 
tightened and brought in line with the phase 3 clinical studies and commercial batches.  
The enzymatic conversion of the cysteine residue in the active site (C53) into formylglycine (FGly 
53) is required for sulfatase activity of elosulfase alfa. The variability of the amount of rhGALNS 
with  a  retained  cysteine  residue,  measured  in  the  active  substance  and  finished  product,  was 
initially raised as a Major Objection. The additional information and justification provided by the 
Applicant  during  the  evaluation  procedure  were  satisfactory  and  this  issue  was  considered 
resolved.  However,  the  Applicant  is  recommended  to  continue  their  efforts  to  understand  and 
improve the consistency of FGly conversion in elosulfase alfa where possible. 
On  request,  the  Applicant  has  included  adequate  acceptance  criteria  for  degradation  products 
and product-related impurities detectable using certain tests, and modified the specifications for 
other  characteristics.  The  revised  specifications  are  considered  acceptable  and  adequately 
confirm  the  quality  of  the  active  substance.  As  the  current  number  of  batches  manufactured  at 
commercial scale is limited, the Applicant is recommended to re-evaluating the active substance 
specifications when results for 50 commercial lots are available.  
Analytical procedures and validation of analytical procedures 
Analytical methods used for the control of the active substance have been adequately described 
and validated. However, the Applicant is recommended to further evaluate certain factors of FGly 
measurements allowing for determination of the true process variability.  
Furthermore,  the  current  cellular  uptake  assay  is  variable  and  the  CHMP  recommends  further 
efforts  to  reduce  the  variability  and  to  replace  it  by  an  improved  cell  based  bioassay  using  a 
variation procedure. 
Stability 
The  design  of  the  stability  program,  including  the  testing  intervals  and  temperature  storage 
conditions, are in accordance to current guidelines. The tests chosen are a subset of tests from 
the release specifications selected for stability-indicating properties. 
On the basis of the stability data provided, the acceptable shelf life for the bulk active substance 
(BDS) is 36 months when stored at less than -25°C and 12 months for the formulated bulk active 
substance (FBDS) when stored at 5±3°C. 
The Applicant is recommended to put an additional lot of BDS on stability per ICH Q5C.

In  accordance  to  EU  GMP  guidelines,  any  confirmed  out-of-specification  result,  or  significant 
negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA. 
Finished product 
Development 
Comprehensive  pre-formulation  physicochemical  characterisation  studies  as  well  as  excipient 
selection and optimisation studies were conducted to identify the optimum formulation. 
Manufacture 
The  manufacturing  process  of  the  finished  product  is  adequately  described  with  appropriate 
controls  in  place.  Process  validation  of  the  finished  product  manufacturing  process  was 
performed  in  accordance  with  applicable  international  regulatory  guidelines  to  demonstrate  the 
acceptability, robustness, and reproducibility of the manufacturing process.  
Control of finished product – specifications 
The  list  of  test  parameters  presented  in  the  finished  product  release  specification  is  considered 
adequate to control finished product quality.  
However,  the  CHMP  recommends  to  further  re-evaluate  certain  finished  product  specifications 
when 50 commercial lots are available. It should be noted that the re-evaluation should be based 
on  finished  product  release  data  only,  unless  it  is  demonstrated  that  the  results  of  active 
substance, FBDS and finished are comparable for all parameters tested. 
Stability 
Real-time and accelerated stability studies were initiated in accordance to ICH guidelines and per 
protocol to monitor the time-temperature stability of cGMP lots of finished product. On the basis 
of the data provided, the acceptable shelf-life for the finished product is 36 months at 5 ± 3°C.  
In  accordance  to  EU  GMP  guidelines,  any  confirmed  out  of  specification  result,  or  significant 
negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
Overall,  the  quality  of  Vimizim  is  considered  to  be  in  line  with  the  quality  of  other  approved 
therapeutic enzymes manufactured by recombinant DNA technology. The different aspects of the 
chemical,  pharmaceutical  and  biological  documentation  comply  with  existing  guidelines.  The 
fermentation  and  purification  of  the  active  substance  are  adequately  described,  controlled  and 
validated.  The  active  substance  is  well  characterised  with  regard  to  its  physicochemical  and 
biological characteristics, using state-of the-art methods, and appropriate specifications are set. 
The  manufacturing  process  of  the  finished  product  has  been  satisfactorily  described  and 
validated.  The  quality  of  the  finished  product  is  controlled  by  adequate  test  methods  and 
specifications.  Viral  safety  and  the  safety  concerning  other  adventitious  agents  including  TSE 
have been sufficiently assured. 
The overall quality of Vimizim is considered acceptable. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific 
progress, the CHMP recommended further points for investigation.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The  recombinant  human  N-acetylgalactosamin-6-sulfatase  (rhGALNS,  elosulfase  alfa)  is 
intended for treatment of patients suffering from mucopolysaccharidosis type IV A (MPS IV A) 
also  known  as  Morquio  disease.  Morquio  A  disease  is  an  inherited  autosomal  recessive 
lysosomal  storage  disorder  caused  by  GALNS  deficiency.  GALNS  is  a  lysosomal  enzyme 
hydrolysing glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) such as keratan sulfate (KS) and chondroitine sulfate 
(CS). Reduced GALNS activity results in accumulation of KS in several tissues including growth 
plate,  articular  cartilage  and  cornea.  Patients  are  suffering  on  skeletal  dysplasia  and  corneal 
cloudiness,  as  well  as  frequently  heart  valve  disease,  restrictive  lung  disease,  and 
hepatomegaly.  Vimizim  is  intended  as  chronic  enzyme  replacement  therapy.  It  is  assumed, 
that  the  intravenously  administered  enzyme  will  be  taken  up  by  the  Cation  Independent 
Mannose  6-phosphate  [CI-M6PR]  transporter  into  cells  and  subsequently  into  the  lysosomal 
compartment.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In  primary  pharmacology  experiments  in  a  human  Morquio  fibroblast  cell  line  GM593,  it  was 
shown that elosulfase alfa is taken up by cells via the CI-M6PR receptor. Intracellular half-life 
in this cell line was estimated at 5-7 days. 
The  applicant  has  performed  in  vitro  experiments  to  characterise  the  intended  properties  of 
elosulfase  alfa.  Primary  human  Morquio  chondrocyte  cell  lines  were  established  using  cells 
from two Morquio patients. These cells showed signs of abnormal skeletal matrix development 
and/or  remodelling,  as  gene  expression  of  chondrocyte  markers  (including  sox9  and  MMP3) 
was  altered  compared  to  normal  chondrocytes.  Morquio  cells  also  showed  no  detectable 
GALNS activity and accumulation of KS in the cells, and therefore thought to be an appropriate 
in  vitro  model  to  evaluate  the  pharmacological  activity  of  elosulfase  alfa.  A  reduced  rate  of 
proliferation compared to normal cells was also observed. 
Most in vitro experiments were performed with up to 10 nM (555 ng/ml) elosulfase alfa, which 
is  considered  to  be  a  clinically  relevant  concentration,  since  the  Cmax  in  patients  at  the 
intended dose of 2 mg/kg is around 2000 ng/ml. Internalization of  elosulfase alfa and some 
localization into the lysosome was shown by immunofluorescent detection, both in fresh cells 
and cultured cells containing accumulated KS. Although the localization seems rather limited, 
treatment  of  Morquio  chondrocytes  with  10  nM  elosulfase  alfa  restored  GALNS  activity  and 
reduced stored KS to levels comparable to normal chondrocytes, which is considered to be the 
most  important  parameter  for  proof  of  concept.  Further  analyses  were  conducted  on  gene 
expression  to  examine  whether  there  is  an  effect  of  elosulfase  alfa  treatment  on  Morquio 
chondrocyte  phenotype.  As  stated  by  the  applicant,  elosulfase  alfa  treatment  led  to  partial 
normalization of the chondrogenic gene expression profile in Morquio chondrocytes. However, 
of  the  five  markers,  only  sox  9  and  Collagen  I  showed  an  expression  similar  to  normal  cells 
Assessment report  
EMA/357933/2014 
Page 20/65 
 
  
  
after treatment, and this only applies to cells from patient 2. These data show that the gene 
expression in Morquio chondrocytes is variable among patients, which is also evident from the 
variable patient phenotypes. To restore gene expression to normal levels in cell culture, longer 
duration of treatment of the cells might be necessary, and other external factors which could 
influence the physiology of the cell are likely to be important.  
These  in  vitro  experiments  show  that    elosulfase  alfa is  taken  up  into  the  cells,  and  restores 
enzyme  activity  in  human  Morquio  chondrocytes.  This  is  a  clinically  relevant  model  and  thus 
the principle of this treatment has been sufficiently shown.  
No  in  vivo  studies  have  been  performed  with  elosulfase  alfa  to  show  the  pharmacodynamic 
activity, due to the lack of an appropriate animal model. Since relevant morphological effects 
are  not  anticipated  by  the  treatment  with  GALNS  in  small  laboratory  animals,  further  studies 
would not provide relevant information at this stage of development.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No  secondary  pharmacodynamics  studies  were  conducted  as  elosulfase  alfa  is  a  large 
molecular protein drug that targets specific receptor. Consequently, no effect of elosulfase alfa 
unrelated to its desired therapeutic target is expected. This was acceptable to the CHMP. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
In safety pharmacology studies, single dose treatment of rats with up 20 mg/kg did not have 
any  effect  on  central  nervous  system  parameters  as  measured  in  the  modified  Irwin 
neurological  assessment,  or  on  respiratory  system  parameters.  Single  dose  treatment  of 
cynomolgus  monkeys  with  up  20  mg/kg  did  not  have  any  effect  on  cardiovascular  system 
parameters. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No  pharmacodynamic  drug  interaction  studies  have  been  performed  as  these  are  not 
anticipated based on the structure of the drug substance (recombinant human glycoprotein). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Analytical  methods:  The  electrochemiluminescence  assays  to  measure  elosulfase  alfa  in  rat, 
monkey  and  rabbit  plasma  and  in  rat  breast  milk  were  sufficiently  validated  with  accuracy  and 
precision  at  the  LOQ  of  <25%  in  plasma  and  <30%  in  milk.  An  immunoassay  was  used  to 
determine the total anti-elosulfase alfa antibody in rat, rabbit and monkey serum. The presence 
of  low  concentrations  of  elosulfase  alfa  (10  ng/ml)  interfered  with  antibody  detection  and 
therefore  samples  were  drawn  prior  to  the  new  dose.  The  signal  from  quality  controls  was 
reproducible  across  multiple  plates  and  analysts,  indicating  acceptable  intermediate  precision. 
The assay was robust and stability was demonstrated. Furthermore, an ELISA was developed to 
detect  antibodies  in  rat  and  monkey  serum  inhibiting  binding  of  elosulfase  alfa  to  CI-M6PR  and 
thus preventing uptake. The assay was specific for elosulfase alfa and was sufficiently validated. 
The  presence  of  low  concentrations  of  elosulfase  alfa  (10  ng/ml)  interfered  with  antibody 
detection  and  therefore  samples  were  drawn  prior  to  the  new  dose.  The  CrossLaps  ELISA  was 
used for the quantitation of degradation products from the C-terminal telopeptide region of type I

collagen. The ELISA was sufficiently validated with accuracy and precision ≤ 25%. An LC-MS/MS 
assay was developed for the analysis of keratansulfate in rat and monkey plasma by measuring 
the two degradation products of keratansulfate Galβ1-4GlcNAc(6S) and Gal(6S)β1-4GlcNAc(6S). 
Accuracy  and  precision  are  ≤25%.  The  LOQ  for  Galβ1-4GlcNAc(6S)  was  0.038  µg/mL  in  rat 
plasma  and  0.011  µg/mL  in  monkey  plasma.  The  LOQ  for  Gal(6S)β1-4GlcNAc(6S)  was  0.237 
µg/mL in rat plasma and 0.114 µg/mL in monkey plasma.  
No  separate  pharmacokinetics  studies  were  performed.  Pharmacokinetics  was  investigated  as 
toxicokinetics  in  single  and  repeated  dose  toxicity  studies.  In  all  these  studies    elosulfase  alfa 
was administered once weekly via the clinically intended IV route. The dose levels chosen were 
0,  1,  6  and  20  mg/kg  b.w.  In  general,  in  rats  and  monkeys  mean  t 1/2  increases  with  dose  and 
repeated  doses.  In  the  rat  the  smallest  t1/2  value  was  seen  after  the  lowest  dose  of  1  mg/kg 
b.w.in the first week (t 1/2 = 2 min) and the largest t1/2 value was observed at the highest dose of 
20  mg/kg  b.w.  at  week  26  (t 1/2  =  26  min).  Half-life  values  of    elosulfase  alfa  increased  in  the 
cynomolgus monkey from around 10 minutes at Dose 1 for all dose levels (1 – 20 mg/kg b.w.) to 
30  to  40  minutes  for  1  mg/kg  and  6  mg/kg,  and  to  96  minutes  for  20  mg/kg  b.w.  In  general, 
with  increasing  dose  increases  in  Cmax  and  AUC  in  rats  and  monkeys  were  greater  than 
proportional.  These  more  than  dose  proportional  increases  were  even  more  pronounced  after 
repeated dosing (in the monkey up to about 17 times above dose proportionality between 1 and 
20 mg/kg b.w. doses). No clear gender differences were observed. 
Calculated volume of distribution is small in rats and increases with time. This indicates that the 
distribution  to  organs  is  slow.  Distribution  studies  indicated  that    elosulfase  alfa  migrates  from 
the blood stream to the target organs. Overall these data indicate that  elosulfase alfa is mainly 
present  in  blood  and  the  target  organs.  Volume  of  distribution  and  therefore  also  the  half-life 
increased with increasing dose and number of doses.  
An  in  vivo  study  was  performed  to  evaluate  the  tissue  distribution  of  elosulfase  alfa  in  mice.  It 
was shown that the enzyme distributes to the heart (mitral valves, atrium and septum), growth 
plate,  articular  cartilage,  bone,  bone  marrow,  and  sinusoidal  and  Kupffer  cells  of  the  liver. 
Further analyses revealed localization into the lysosomal compartment of heart cells. An in vivo 
study in rabbit showed that elosulfase alfa is able to pass the placenta and into milk . Elosulfase 
alfa  is  a  recombinant  form  of  human  N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase  and  is  identical  to  the 
naturally  occurring  human  enzyme  in  terms  of  the  amino  acid  sequence  and  N-linked 
glycosylation  sites.  Elosulfase  alfa  will  therefore  be  metabolised  like  the  natural  occurring 
enzyme. Thus, no metabolism studies are warranted. Based on the structure and molecular size 
of elosulfase alfa, no transporter studies are warranted. Elosulfase alfa is most likely excreted in 
the  same  way  as  the  natural  enzyme  and  thus,  the  absence  of  excretion  studies  to  urine,  bile, 
and faeces is justified. Elosulfase alfa is excreted into milk of rat after IV administration. Because 
of its molecular structure and size, elosulfase alfa is not likely to be a substrate for or inhibitor of 
drug transporters and CYP and conjugation enzymes involved in the transport and metabolism of 
drugs.  
The  CHMP  noted  that  due  to  the  mechanism  of  action  of  elosulfase  alfa,  which  requires  an 
appropriate  lysosomal  pH,  drugs  affecting  lysosomal  pH  are  expected  to  impair  proper 
functioning of elosulfase alfa. The applicant acknowledged that the physiologic effects of potential 
drug  interaction  in  the  lysosome  are  not  well  documented  in  vivo.  In  regards  to  elosulfase  alfa 
activity  in  the  lysosome,  changes  in  lysosomal  pH  could  potentially  decrease  maximal  activity 
Assessment report

depending on the degree of lysosomal pH increase. However, elosulfase alfa intracellular half-life 
in  the  lysosome  is  5  to  7  days  enabling  sulfate  cleavage  of  the  endogenous  substrates  at  less 
than optimal enzyme activity as long as the pH stays below neutral pH. Elosulfase alfa is active in 
the acidic lysosomal compartment as pH ranges of 4.8 – 5.3. In addition, drugs known to change 
lysosomal pH under in vitro experimental conditions would not reasonably achieve concentrations 
high  enough  under  approved,  prescribed  conditions to  alter the  lysosomal  pH outside  of  the  pH 
range  in  which  GALNS  is  active.  Therefore,  no  pharmacokinetic  drug  interaction  studies  were 
conducted and this is agreed by the CHMP. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The following toxicology studies were conducted: single dose toxicity study in rats, repeated dose 
toxicity studies of 26 weeks duration in rats and of 52 weeks duration in monkeys, with a 4 week 
recovery phase, each, a 4 week toxicity study in monkeys in which 3 different lots of elosulfase 
alfa  were  compared  and DART  studies.  The  general  toxicity  studies  were  designed  as  combined 
toxicology/pharmaco-(toxico-)kinetics  studies.  The  single  dose  toxicity  study  in  rats  was  in 
addition a combined CNS-safety study. The studies are summarised in the following table.

Single dose toxicity 
A  study  was  conducted  to  evaluate  the  toxicity  and  determine  the  TK  parameters  of  elosulfase 
alfa  when  administered  as  a  single  dose  via  slow  push  bolus  IV  injection  to  SD  rats.  This  was 
followed  by  a  two-week  recovery  period  to  assess  the  reversibility,  persistence,  or  delayed 
occurrence  of  any  effects.  Blood  and  urine  samples  were  taken  for  haematology,  coagulation, 
clinical  chemistry,  and  urinalysis  from  fasted  animals  prior  to  scheduled  euthanasia  on  day  15, 
when  a  full  necropsy  was  performed  and  a  subset  of  organs  (adrenals,  brain,  epididymides, 
Assessment report

heart, kidneys, liver, lungs, ovaries, pituitary gland, prostate, mandibular salivary gland, seminal 
vesicle,  spleen,  testes,  thymus,  thyroid  with  parathyroid,  and  uterus)  were  weighed.  Brain, 
heart,  injection  sites,  kidneys,  lesions  (if  present),  liver,  lungs,  and  spleen  were  examined  by 
histopathology.  There  were  no  elosulfase  alfa  -related  changes  in  the  clinical  signs  and  body 
weight.  No  injection  site  reactions  or  elosulfase  alfa  -related  changes  in  clinical  pathology 
parameters,  absolute  or  relative  organ  weight,  or  macroscopic  or  microscopic  pathology  were 
observed. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeated  dose  toxicity  of  elosulfase  alfa  was  evaluated  in  rats  after  26  weekly  doses,  and  in 
cynomolgus  monkeys  up  to  52  weeks  of  dosing.  In  rats,  expected  anaphylactoid-type  reactions 
were observed across all doses, which were attenuated by pre-treatment with diphenhydramine 
(DPH). Other findings were limited to urinary changes, e.g. increased urine volume and pH and 
decreased specific gravity; decreased ALP in males at all doses, and decreased spleen weight in 
high  dose  females.  As  these  changes  are  only  minor,  and  not  seen  in  the  monkeys,  their 
toxicological relevance is questionable. The NOAEL in the rat was established as 20 mg/kg/week 
after 26 weeks of dosing.  
In  the  28-day  repeated  dose  study  with  cynomolgus  monkeys,  4  weekly  20  mg/kg  infusions  of 
three  different  batches  were  compared.  Two  batches  represented  a  formulation  used  in  the 
phase  3  studies,  and  one  represented  a  batch  used  in  phase  1  and  2  trials.  No  significant 
toxicological  findings  were  observed  in  this  study,  and  the  difference  between  the  batches  was 
not apparent. 
Elosulfase alfa was further evaluated in monkeys with 39 to 52 weekly infusion up to 20 mg/kg. 
The  material  used  in  this  study  was  a  formulation  used  in  phase  1  and  2  trials.  The  monkeys 
were  2-3  years  old  at  study  initiation  and  represented  the  juvenile  population  intended  to  be 
treated. Special attention was paid to the bones of the animals, since this is the target organ of 
the  elosulfase  alfa  pharmacodynamic  effect.  No  anaphylactoid-type  reactions  or  any  other 
treatment-related effects were observed in these monkeys. Exposure in terms of AUC was above 
the human exposure at the intended clinical dose. 
Genotoxicity 
No  genotoxicity  studies  were  performed  and  the  conduct  of  such  studies  is  not  considered 
necessary due to the protein structure and the enzymatic activity of the drug substance, which is 
acceptable to the CHMP. 
Carcinogenicity 
No  carcinogenicity  studies  were  conducted  since  the  risk  for  carcinogenic  potential  is  not 
anticipated  for  a  biological  molecule  that  lacks  immunomodulatory  or  cellular  proliferation 
activity.  The  enzymatic  activity  of  elosulfase  alfa  is  restricted  to  the  lysosomal  compartment 
where it specifically degrades KS and this mode of action does not raise concern of a potential for 
neoplasm  induction  or  tumor  promotion.  No  proliferative  or  neoplastic  lesions  were  observed  in 
repeat-dose  elosulfase  alfa  toxicology  studies.  In  addition,  no  carcinogenic  potential  in  clinical 
studies has been observed in other marketed enzyme replacement therapies. This justification is 
adequate.

Reproduction Toxicity 
Four developmental and reproductive toxicity studies were conducted to characterise the effects 
of  elosulfase  alfa  on  fertility,  embryo-foetal  and  peri/postnatal  development  after  daily 
administration. These studies included a combined fertility/embryo-foetal development rat study, 
a developmental and peri/postnatal reproduction rat study, and dose range-finding and definitive 
embryo-foetal development rabbit studies (see table below).

 ELOSULFASE ALFA-treated animals received 10 mg/kg DPH, IP, 10 to 20 min prior to elosulfase alfa administration from the 
first dose onward to mitigate an expected anaphylactoid-type reaction. An additional vehicle-treated group was given 10 mg/kg 
DPH, IP, 10 to 20 min prior to elosulfase alfa administration to control for DPH administration. 
Elosulfase  alfa  was  evaluated  in  rats  up  to  20  mg/kg/day  for  effects  on  fertility  and 
embryo/foetal development. Due to anaphylactoid-type reactions in the rats seen in the repeated 
dose study, animals were treated with DPH prior to dosing and a DPH control group was added. 
Some effects still remained in male and female F0 rats, but these are probably due to the daily 
dosing  regimen.  There  was  no  major  effect  on  the  fertility  parameters  in  males  or  females.  A 
non-significant reduction in sperm motility was seen at the 6 mg/kg/day dose, and was therefore 
not  considered  treatment-related.  Effects  on  reproduction,  namely  increased  resorption,  post-

implantation  loss  and  incomplete  ossification,  were  likely  to  occur  due  to  DPH  treatment,  since 
they were also seen in the DPH control group. Thus, no elosulfase alfa related effects on embryo-
fetal development in rats up to 20 mg/kg/day were observed.  
In the dose rage finding (DRF) rabbit embryo/foetal development study, dams had pitted areas 
in the liver at doses from 6 mg/kg/day. This is likely due to a non-specific reaction to the protein 
in these animals. Body weight gain was reduced at the high dose, which coincided with reduced 
foetal body weight at this dose. The main study used doses up to 10 mg/kg/day. The high dose 
caused  pitted  areas  in  the  liver  of  the  dams,  as  seen  in  the  DRF  study.  No  other  effects  were 
observed,  and  therefore  the  NOAEL  of  BMN  for  embryo/foetal  development  in  rabbits  is  10 
mg/kg/day  in  this  study.  Since  no  anaphylactoid-type  reactions  were  observed  in  this  species, 
DPH was not administered to any of the animals.  
Pre-  and  postnatal  development  was  evaluated  in  rats,  which  were  dosed  up  to  20  mg/kg/day, 
up  to  lactation  day  20.  All  animals  were  also  dosed  with  DPH  to  counteract  anaphylactoid-type 
reactions,  and  a  DPH  control  group  was  added.  Effects  related  to  the  DPH  treatment  included 
scabs,  ulcerations  and  an  increased  duration  of  gestation.  Effects  related  to  elosulfase  alfa 
treatment  were  limited  to  a  reduction  in  body  weight  during  the  gestation  period  in  high  dose 
dams, corresponding to a decreased foetal weight up to lactation day 4. An increase in stillborn 
pups was also observed at the mid and high dose ranges. This effect was not seen in any other 
reproduction  toxicity  study.  There  were  no  other  effects  on  any  of  the  reproduction  or 
development parameters in the F1 and F2 generations. Elosulfase alfa is secreted in rat milk at a 
dose of 6 mg/kg/day or higher, but not at 1 mg/kg/day. 
Nevertheless,  it  is  difficult  to  interpret  these  toxicological  findings  due  to  the  simultaneously 
administration of DPH and evidence of any effects on pre– and postnatal development at doses 
up  to  20  mg/kg  cannot  be  excluded.  Thus,  the  CHMP  requested  to  include  and  appropriate 
statement in the SmPC informing the prescriber that animal studies are of limited relevance. As a 
precautionary  measure,  it  is  preferable  to  avoid  the  use  of  Vimizim  during  pregnancy,  unless 
clearly necessary.  
Toxicokinetic data 
The  toxicokinetics  of  elosulfase  alfa  was  studied  after  single  and  repeated  IV  administration  to 
male and female Sprague Dawley rats in general toxicity studies as discussed above. 
Local Tolerance  
The  intended  clinical  route  of  administration  is  IV  infusion.  Repeated  dose  and  safety 
pharmacology studies have been performed with IV administration, therefore no additional local 
tolerance studies are considered necessary. No local tolerance studies have been performed. 
Other toxicity studies 
Due  to  the  nature  of  the  compound  elosulfase  alfa  and  its  mechanism  of  action,  no  additional 
studies on antigenicity, immunotoxicity, dependence, metabolites or impurities were performed. 
This is considered acceptable.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Elosulfase  alfa 
is  a  recombinantly  generated  glycosylated  protein  being  administered 
parenterally.  It  is  expected  that  elosulfase  alfa  is  easily  biologically  degradable  and  that  an 
increase  in  the  concentration  of  intact  elosulfase  alfa  in  the  environment  is  highly  unlikely.  An 
environmental  risk  assessment  is  not  considered  necessary.  Elosulfase  alfa  is  not  expected  to 
pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The  in  vitro  pharmacology  experiments  were  performed  in  clinically  relevant  models,  and  this 
supports the use of elosulfase alfa in Morquio patients. Based on FDA advice, rat was chosen as 
additional  toxicology  species  next  to  the  monkey.  It  is  to  be  noted  that  at  least  three  types  of 
KS, termed KSI, KSII and KSIII exist in the human body. Apart from small differences between 
the  subtypes,  it  is  the  way  in  which  the  KS  proteoglycan  chain  is  attached  to  its  core  proteins 
that distinguishes the subtypes from each other. KSII seems to be the most important subtype, 
as  humans  affected  with Morquio  syndrome  are  most  affected by  abnormalities  in  cartilage  and 
bones, the sites which predominantly express KSII. As is stated by the applicant, rodents do not 
express  KSII,  which  further  complicates  the  matter  on  species  relevancy.  However,  in  view  of 
data  acceptance  across  multiple  regions,  studies in rats  have  been  performed.  Although  the  rat 
studies  are  considered  of  limited  relevance  and  the  non-clinical  programme  could  have  been 
reduced, the rationale of the applicant with regard to their global product development program 
is acceptable to the CHMP. 
No  secondary  pharmacodynamic  and  pharmacodynamics  drug  interaction  studies  were 
performed.  The  possibility  that  drugs  affecting  lysosomal  pH  could  impair  proper  functioning  of  
elosulfase  alfa  has  been  discussed  and  it  was  concluded  that  substances  able  to  change 
lysosomal  pH  would  not  achieve  concentrations  reasonably  high  to  alter  and  elevate  the 
lysosomal pH to levels when the elosulfase alfa activity would be hampered. 
The  investigations  of  elosulfase  alfa  kinetic  parameters  show  that  its  half-life  is  short  in  the 
animal  species,  but  the  interpretation  of  these  data  in  relation  to  the  distribution  to  the  target 
cells  is  limited.  The  short  half-life  could  indicate  the  enzyme  is  eliminated  or  distributed,  or  a 
combination of the two. The volume of distribution in rats is small. Overall, there is a high inter-
individual  variability.  The  distribution  study  in  mice  was  exploratory.  It  was  shown  that 
fluorophore-labelled  elosulfase  alfa  distributed  in  mice  to  well  vascularized  severely  affected 
tissues,  such  as  liver,  and  the  heart  valve  and  growth  plate  of  long  bones,  representing  the 
poorly  vascularized  severely  affected  target  tissue.  As  a  similar  cellular  uptake  was  shown  of 
fluorophore-labelled  and  unlabelled-elosulfase  alfa  in  rabbit  synoviocytes,  it  is  likely  that  the 
labelling  will  not  have  affected  tissue  distribution.  Overall,  the  non-clinical  pharmacokinetic 
results do not significantly contribute to the overall profile of elosulfase alfa. The clinical studies 
are considered of greater relevance. 
The single dose toxicity study in rats did not reveal any toxicological findings with elosulfase alfa 
doses up to 20 mg/kg. Repeated dose toxicity was evaluated in rats after 26 weekly doses, and 
in  cynomolgous  monkeys  up  to  52  weeks  of  dosing.  In  rats,  expected  anaphylactoid-type 
reactions were observed across all doses and were attenuated by pre-treatment with DPH. Other 
Assessment report

findings were limited to urinary changes and decreased ALP in males at all doses, and decreased 
spleen  weight  in  high  dose  females.  These  changes  were  not  seen  in  monkey  and  their 
toxicological  relevance  is  questionable.  Similarly,  no  toxicological  findings  were  observed  in 
repeated dose studies in monkeys. 
No  genotoxicity  or  carcinogenicity  studies  have  been  performed.  The  CHMP  considered  this 
acceptable,  since  due  to  the  nature  of  the  product,  carcinogenic  or  genotoxic  effects  are  not 
expected. 
Elosulfase  alfa  was  evaluated  in  rats  for  effects  on  fertility  and  embryo-foetal  development. 
There  was  no  significant  effect  on  fertility  parameters  in  males  or  females.  A  non-significant, 
treatment-nonrelated  reduction  in  sperm  motility  was  only  seen  at  the  6  mg/kg/day  dose.  In 
rabbits, pitted areas in the liver of dams were observed at doses from 6 mg/kg/day, which were 
linked to a non-specific reaction to the protein in these animals. No anaphylactoid-type reactions 
were observed. Pre- and  postnatal development was evaluated in rats,  which were dosed up to 
20 mg/kg/day, up to lactation day 20. Effects related to elosulfase alfa treatment were limited to 
a  reduction  in  body  weight  during  the  gestation  period  in  high  dose  dams,  corresponding  to  a 
decreased foetal weight up to lactation day 4. An increase in stillborn pups was also observed at 
the mid and high dose. This effect was not seen in any other reproduction toxicity study. There 
were  no  other  effects  on  any  of  the  reproduction  or  development  parameters  in  the  F1  and  F2 
generations.  At  the  dose  of  20  mg/kg/day,  the  exposure  was  27-fold  higher  than  the  human 
exposure at the intended clinical dose. 
The active substance is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter the concentration or 
distribution  of  the  substance  in  the  environment.  Therefore,  elosulfase  alfa  is  not  expected  to 
pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
There  are  no  major  objections  to  the  granting of  a marketing  authorization  for  Vimizim,  from  a 
non-clinical point of view. The applicant has clarified issues regarding the relevance of the non-
clinical  species  and  the  rationale  behind  the  non-clinical  programme,  as  well  as  the  unlikely 
appearance  of the  effects on  lysosomal  pH due  to other  drugs.  The  SmPC  adequately  describes 
the  non-clinical  profile  of  Vimizim  and  important  observations  were  included  in  the  information 
for prescribers and patients.   
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This  is  an  application  for  marketing  authorisation  for  Vimizim  through  the  centralised 
procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. 
Vimizim  was  designated  an  orphan  medicinal  product  EU/3/09/657  on  24  July  2009  in  the 
following indication: treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis, type IVA (Morquio A syndrome). The 
applicant  applied  for  the  following  indication:  “Vimizim  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of 
mucopolysaccharidosis, type IVA (Morquio A Syndrome, MPS IVA) (see section 5.1)”

At  the  time  of  MAA  submission,  the  applicant  provided  data  from  6  clinical  studies.  These 
included  2  studies  that  were  completed  (MOR-002;  MOR-004),  and  4  studies  that  were 
ongoing  (MOR-100;  MOR-005;  MOR-007;  MOR-008).  For  MOR-008,  only  safety  results  were 
presented,  due  to  limited  exposure  at  the  time  of  data  cut-off.  A  further  ongoing  phase  2 
study, MOR-006, was not included since enrollment was ongoing and exposure at data cut-off 
was very limited.  
The  pivotal  trial  for  this  application  is  considered  to  be  the  phase  3  study  MOR-004.  Thus 
study was initiated in January 2011 and was completed in August 2012. Furthermore, patients 
who  completed  this  trial  were  given  the  opportunity  to  enroll  in  extension  study  MOR-005, 
which was initiated July 2011. 
The applicant also initiated a natural history study MOR-001 (MorCAP) and data from the first 
visit of 325 patients have been included in the MAA.  
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics  of  elosulfase  alfa  was  assessed  in  3  in  vitro  non-clinical  studies  and  in  the  2 
completed  clinical  trials  MOR-002  and  MOR-004.  Additional  assessments  are  planned  for  the 
ongoing clinical studies MOR-005 and MOR-008. Immunogenicity was or will be assessed in all 6 
clinical trials (MOR-002, MOR-004, MOR-005, MOR-100, MOR-007, MOR-008).

Stability has been proven for the storage conditions of the majority part of the subject samples. 
Excluding  the  study  samples  for  which  stability  has  not  yet  been  proven  from  the 
pharmacokinetic analysis, it was shown that this had not a major effect on the pharmacokinetics. 
As  indicated  by  the  applicant,  long  term  stability  evaluation  is  on-going  to  address  the  storage 
integrity of the remaining fifty samples stored at -35 to -45°C for approximately 105 days and -
60  to  -80°C  for  approximately  82  days  and  ninety-five  samples  at  -60  to  -80°C  for  longer 
periods. The results are expected to be available in Q3 2014. The CHMP requested the applicant 
to provide the data when available, as stated in section 2.4.5. 
Absorption  
Studies on absorption are not applicable since elosulfase alfa is administered intravenously.  
Distribution 
The mean Vdss for elosulfase alfa in patients receiving 2 mg/kg/qw was about 650 ml/kg. Organ 
distribution  studies  were  not  performed.  Uptake  into  lysosomes  is  most  likely  mediated  by  the 
binding  of  mannose-6-phosphate-terminated  oligosaccharide  chains  of  elosulfase  alfa  to  the 
cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-M6PR). Its distribution to and subsequent 
uptake  by  tissues/target  cells  is  receptor-driven.  Plasma  protein  binding  studies  are  considered 
not  applicable  for  elosulfase  alfa,  as  it  is  a  protein  and  thus,  does  not  expect  to  significantly 
interact with plasma proteins. 
Elimination 
The elosulfase alfa plasma concentrations fell rapidly with a short mean t 1/2  of about 7.5 min at 
the end of infusion after the recommended dose of 2 mg/kg/qw at week 0 and of about 36 min 
at week 22. The clearance value was about 7.1 ml/min/kg. The rapid clearance of elosulfase alfa 
from  plasma  is  consistent  with  the  uptake  of  elosulfase  alfa  into  lysosomes  via  CI-M6PR. 
Elosulfase  alfa  is  a  protein,  which  is  considered  to  be  degraded  into  small  proteins  and  single 
amino  acids  by  well-known  mechanisms.  As  such,  metabolite  studies  were  not  performed.  The 
lack of further evaluation of the elimination of elosulfase alfa is acceptable, since this is a protein 
expected  to  be  degraded  similarly  as  any  endogenous  enzymes  to  smaller  proteins  and  amino 
acids. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Pharmacokinetics increased more than dose proportional over the 0.1 to 2 mg/kg/qw dose range. 
Clearance  decreased  from  about  10.2  ml/min/kg  to  7.5  ml/min/kg,  as  observed  in  study  MOR-
002. Patient data indicate that at higher doses exposure increases more than dose proportional. 
At  steady  state,  AUCt  increased  by  a  factor  of  about  3.5.  This  reflects  saturation  of  uptake  in 
lysosomes and in addition saturation in metabolism.  
Considering  the  rapid  decline  in  plasma  levels,  no  accumulation  is  expected  in  case  of  weekly 
dosing. Elosulfase alfa shows time dependent pharmacokinetics, i.e. pharmacokinetics at steady 
state increased more than expected based upon single dose data. This is likely to be explained by 
saturation of uptake into lysosomes resulting in a higher systemic plasma exposure.

With  respect  to  the  patients  with  impaired  renal  function,  no  data  were  submitted  by  the 
applicant  regarding the  evaluation  of  pharmacokinetics  in  patients  with  impaired  renal  function. 
Considering  that  elosulfase  alfa  is  a  protein,  no  clinically  relevant  effect  of  an  impaired  renal 
function 
is  expected.  Furthermore,  no  data  were  submitted  regarding  evaluation  of 
pharmacokinetics in patients with impaired hepatic function. Elosulfase alfa is a protein and thus, 
no clinically relevant effect of an impaired hepatic function is expected.  
In  study  MOR-004,  the  effect  of  gender  on  the  clearance  of  elosulfase  alfa  was  evaluated. 
Although  some  difference  were  observed  at  week  0  and  at  week  22,  the  differences  are 
considered not clinically relevant. The CHMP noted that no clear gender effect on the clearance of 
elosulfase alfa is observed.  
In study MOR-004, the effect of race on the clearance of elosulfase alfa was evaluated. Due to a 
limited  number  of  subjects,  only  two  categories  of  races  were  used  in  the  analysis:  white  and 
non-white.  At  week  0,  clearance  appeared  to  be  higher  in  white  subjects  than  non-white 
subjects,  but  this  was  not  observed  at  week  22.  Thus,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  after  multiple 
dosing  at  week  22  at  qow  and  qw  dose,  no  effect  of  race  on  the  clearance  of  elosulfase  alfa  is 
observed.  The  effect  of  body  weight  on  the  clearance  of  elosulfase  alfa  was  also  evaluated.  At 
week 0, clearance appeared to decrease with increase in body weight, but this was not observed 
at week 22. Thus, the CHMP concluded that after multiple dosing, no effect of body weight on the 
clearance of elosulfase alfa can be observed. This accounts for the week 22 qow and qw dose.  
The CHMP noted that no elderly patients were included in the main clinical trials. However, this is 
expected, since most patients diagnosed with Morquio disease may not reach the age above 60 
years.  Nevertheless,  study  MOR-004  evaluated  the  effect  of  age  on  the  clearance  of  elosulfase 
alfa. At week 0, clearance appeared to decrease with age increase, but this was not observed at 
week 22. Importantly, after multiple dosing, no effect of age on the clearance of elosulfase alfa is 
observed. This accounts at week 22 for the qow and qw dose.  
Overall,  after  multiple  dosing,  at  week  22  for  the  qow  and  qw  dose,  no  effect  of  gender,  age, 
body weight and race (white vs non-white) on the clearance of elosulfase alfa is observed. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No  PK  interaction  studies  have  been  conducted.  The  lack  of  in-vitro  and  in-vivo  interaction 
studies  would  usually  be  acceptable  for  a  compound  similar  to  an  endogenous  protein,  but  the 
mechanism  of  action  for  elosulfase  alfa  requires  an  appropriate  lysosomal  pH,  as  already 
discussed  in  the  chapter  on  Non-clinical  aspects.  However,  as  stated  by  the  applicant,  the 
development  of  an  assay  in  primary  human  chondrocytes  for  in  vitro  characterization  of 
elosulfase alfa activity was not successful. In addition, in vitro assessments may not be reflective 
of in vivo changes involving tissue and cellular distribution.

Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
No pharmacokinetic studies using human biomaterials have been conducted. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Elosulfase  alfa  is  taken  up  to  the  cells  by  cation-independent  mannose-6-phosphate  receptors, 
and hydrolyses the sulphate ester bonds from N-acetyl-galactosamine-6-sulphate or galactose-6-
sulphate  on  the  non-reducing  ends  of  KS.  Elosulfase  alfa  does  not  cleave  sulphate  groups 
internal  to  GAG  chains  and  thus,  cannot  further  degrade  GAGs  without  the  participation  of  all 
enzymes in the degradation pathway. Elosulfase alfa has a narrow pH optimum between pH 4.8 
and 5.3 for enzyme activity and shows no enzymatic activity at neutral pH. Elosulfase alfa is not 
anticipated to degrade other GAGs or KS outside of the lysosomal compartment due to its lack of 
activity  at  neutral  pH,  its  targeted  delivery  to  the  lysosomal  compartment,  and  its  substrate 
specificity.  
Mechanism of action 
In  the  absence  of  a  relevant  disease  model  for  MPS  IVA,  the  pharmacological  activity  of 
elosulfase  alfa  was  evaluated  in  vitro  in  primary  human  Morquio  chondrocytes  and  a  Morquio 
fibroblast cell line. Elosulfase alfa cellular uptake, trafficking to the lysosomal compartment, and 
pharmacological activity were confirmed in primary human Morquio chondrocytes. Internalisation 
of  elosulfase  alfa was  confirmed  within  in  vitro  studies  in  human  Morquio  fibroblasts.  In  human 
Morquio fibroblasts, the intracellular t½ was estimated to be 5 to 7 days in these same cells and 
support  the  every  other  week  and  weekly  dosing  regimens  used  in  the  Phase  3  studies.  The 
distribution  of  elosulfase  alfa  to  MPS  IVA  target  tissues  (growth  plate,  liver,  and  heart  valves) 
and its subsequent trafficking to the lysosomal compartment was demonstrated in BALB/c wild-
type mice after single or repeat dose bolus IV injections of elosulfase alfa via the tail vein.  
Overall,  the  in  vitro  studies  in  patient  chondrocytes  demonstrated  that  elosulfase  alfa  is 
transported  from  outside  the  cell  into  the  lysosome.  In  the  lysosome,  the  accumulation  of 
keratan sulfate was cleared. At a higher dose, elosulfase alfa was able to restore the expression 
of  at  least  some  of  the  chondrogenic  genes.  The  mechanism  of  action  of  elosulfase  alfa  is 
considered adequately established.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Pharmacodynamic effects of elosulfase alfa in humans were estimated by measuring urine KS as 
a  marker  of  biologic  effect.  Urine  KS  levels  decreased  rapidly  in  all  5  studies  (MOR-002/MOR-
100,  MOR-004/MOR-005,  MOR-007)  following  treatment  with  elosulfase  alfa,  and  these 
decreases  were  sustained  throughout  the  duration  of  each  study  or  at  data  cut-off  in  on-going 
trials.  The  data  indicate  that  elosulfase  alfa  is  capable  of  breaking  down  accumulated  KS.  In 
study MOR-004, treatment with elosulfase alfa led to a rapid and sustained reduction of urine KS 
in both treatment arms at week 24. In the extension study MOR-005, an additional 24 weeks of 
treatment  sustained  the  reduction  in  urine  KS.  Sensitivity  analyses  performed  on  the  PP 
population up to week 48 yielded results consistent with those described for the ITT population. 
In  study  MOR-002,  elosulfase  alfa  for  72  to  84  weeks  resulted  in  decreases  in  urine  KS  levels, 
which  were  generally  sustained  through  the  extension  MOR-100  in  which  all  participants  are 
receiving 2.0 mg/kg/qw. In study MOR-007 in children < 5 years of age mean normalised urine 
Assessment report

KS  values  showed  a  comparable  decline  as  observed  in  older  children  and  adults.  No  dedicated 
secondary pharmacology studies were conducted, which is acceptable for an endogenous protein-
like compound. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
With  respect  to  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  elosulfase  alfa,  the  pharmacokinetic  data  are 
adequate  for  this  application  given  that  pharmacokinetic  data  are  of  limited  value  to  predict 
efficacy and safety of this product.  
The  mechanism  of  action  of  elosulfase  alfa  is  adequately  established.  Enzyme  replacement 
therapy  has  been  used  successfully  to  treat  lysosomal  storage  disorders  by  administering  the 
enzyme  systemically  and  by  promoting  the  uptake  into  appropriate  cells  and  tissues  through 
specific 
targeting  mechanisms.  Elosulfase  alfa 
is 
intended 
to  provide  exogenous 
N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulphatase. 
Pharmacodynamic effects of elosulfase alfa in humans were estimated by measuring urine KS as 
a  marker  of  biologic  effect; 
the  glycosaminoglycan  KS 
is  normally  degraded  by 
N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulphatase.  Urine  KS  decreased  rapidly  in  all  5  studies  and  these 
decreases were sustained throughout studies. The data indicate that elosulfase alfa is capable of 
breaking  down  accumulated  KS.  However,  the  relationship  of  urinary  KS  to  other  measures  of 
clinical  response  remains  to  be  established  in  clinical  practice.  The  data  support  the  use  of 
elosulfase alfa at 2.0 mg/kg/qw.  
No  data  on  secondary  pharmacology,  drug-drug  or  drug-disease  interaction,  or  on  genetic 
differences  in  pharmacodynamic  response  have  been  provided,  which  is  acceptable  for  a 
compound alike to an endogenous protein.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  CHMP  considered  the  provided  non-clinical  and  clinical  data  adequate  to  support  the 
marketing  authorisation  application 
for  Vimizim.  Pharmacodynamic  studies 
in  patient 
chondrocytes  demonstrated  that  elosulfase  afa  is  transported  from  outside  the  cell  into  the 
lysosome. In the lysosome the accumulation of keratan sulfate was cleared. In patients suffering 
from  MPS  IVA  elosulfase  alfa  is  able  to  decrease  the  urine  keratan  sulfate,  suggesting  the 
clearance of the accumulated keratan sulfate from the lysosomes. This can be considered a proof 
of concept. The clinical relevance of this effect remains to be demonstrated in clinical practice. 
The  CHMP  considers  the  following  measures  necessary  to  address  issues  related  to  clinical 
pharmacokinetics:

periods. The applicant should submit these 
results if available. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The applicant provided data from six clinical studies, as listed in section 2.4.1: two studies have 
been  completed  (MOR-002;  MOR-004)  and  four  are  on-going  (MOR-100;  MOR-005;  MOR-007; 
MOR-008). For MOR-008 only safety results have been included due to limited exposure at time 
of data cut-off. Another on-going phase 2 study, MOR-006, has not been included as enrollment 
was on-going at the time of submission and exposure at data cut-off was very limited.  
The  pivotal  trial  for  this  application  is  the  phase  3  study  MOR-004,  initiated  January  2011  and 
completed August 2012; patients who completed this trial were given the opportunity to enroll in 
extension study MOR-005 initiated July 2011. 
The  applicant  has  also  initiated  a  natural  history  study  MOR-001  or  MorCAP  and  data  from  the 
first  visit  of  325  patients  have  been  included  in  the  application  at  the  time  of  submission.  The 
population is estimated to include approximately 10% of the global MPS IVA patient population. 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
Doses of elosulfase alfa for the pivotal trial were selected based on the results of study MOR-002, 
a dose-escalation study conducted in 20 patients aged 5 to 18 years, as well as on the results of 
the non-clinical and in vitro studies with elosulfase alfa. Clinical and non-clinical data reported for 
other ERTs were also considered.  
In  study  MOR-002,  endurance  as  measured  by  6MWT  declined  at  weeks  6,  12,  and  18 
(0.1 mg/kg/qw),  while  the  6MWT  distance  increased  at  weeks  24  (1.0 mg/kg/qw)  and  36 
(2.0 mg/kg/qw)  with  mean  changes  from  baseline  (± SD)  of  about  16 m  (72)  and  14 m  (63), 
respectively.  After  decreasing  the  dose  to  1.0 mg/kg/qw  in  the  continuation  period,  the  mean 
changes  from  baseline  (± SD)  at  weeks  48  and  72  were  -5 m  (65)  and  4 m  (87),  respectively. 
The median changes from baseline in 6MWT at  weeks 12, 24, 36, 48 and 72  were -1 m, 34 m, 
18 m,  0 m,  and  0.5 m,  respectively.  Mean  changes  from  baseline  (± SD)  in  the  3MSCT  were 
0 stairs/min  (14)  at  week  12,  6 stairs/min  (9)  at  week  24,  8 stairs/min  (14)  at  week  36,  and 
10 stairs/min (14) at week 72. The median changes from baseline in 3MSCT at weeks 12, 24, 36, 
48  and  72  were  1 stairs/min,  2 stairs/min,  6 stairs/min,  6 stairs/min,  and  2 stairs/min, 
respectively. The mean percent changes from baseline (± SD) in FVC were 3% (11) at week 12, 
0%  (17)  at  week  24,  11%  (21)  at  week  36,  and  13%  (15)  at  week  72.  The  median  percent 
changes  from  baseline  in  FVC  at  weeks  12,  24,  36,  and  72  were  3%,  0%,  11%,  and  14%, 
respectively.  Mean  changes  from  baseline  (± SD)  in  normalised  urine  KS  were  -7 µg/mg  (7)  at 
week 12, -9 µg/mg (8) at week 24, -13 µg/mg (9) at week 36, and -10 µg/mg (7) at week 72. 
The  median  changes  from  baseline  in  normalised  urine  KS  at  weeks  12,  24,  36,  and  72  were  -
7 µg/mg,  -9 µg/mg,  -13 µg/mg,  and  -8 µg/mg,  respectively.  Mean  and  median  changes  from 
baseline in urine KS increased again in patients continuing treatment in the extension trial MOR-
100 at a dose of 2.0 mg/kg/qw instead of 1.0 mg/kg/qw used from week 36 onwards in the base

study  MOR-002.  Mean  and  median  changes  from  baseline  in  normalised  urine  KS  were  -
14 µg/mg  at  weeks  24  and  60  with  standard  deviations  of  the  mean  of  8  and  11 µg/mg, 
respectively,  supporting  the  hypothesis  that  urine  KS  reduction  is  more  closely  related  to  dose 
than to time on treatment. 
Overall, although many efficacy measures showed improvements in median values from baseline 
at the end of the 1.0 mg/kg/qw dose interval (week 24), the data appear to be in favour of the 
2.0 mg/kg/qw dose. 
Although  the  CHMP  acknowledged  that  the  results  of  study  MOR-002  are  heterogeneous  and 
interpretation is limited by the dose-escalating design, it is agreed that overall, the available data 
appear  to  be  in  favour  of  the  2.0 mg/kg/qw  dose  and  the  rational  for  including  an  alternative 
dose of 2.0 mg/kg/qow into the pivotal trial MOR-004 is agreed. 
2.5.2.  Main study 
The  main  clinical  efficacy  and  safety  data  are  derived  from  the  pivotal  trial,  MOR-004,  titled  “A 
Phase  3,  Randomized,  Double-Blind,  Placebo-Controlled,  Multinational  Clinical Study  to  Evaluate 
the  Efficacy  and  Safety  of  2.0  mg/kg/qw  and  2.0  mg/kg/every  other  week  elosulfase  alfa  in 
Patients  with  Mucopolysaccharidosis  IVA  (Morquio  A  Syndrome).”  The  trial  was  conducted 
between  January  2011  and  August  2012  by  34  principal  investigators  at  33  study  centres  in 
Argentina,  Brazil,  Canada,  Colombia,  Denmark,  France,  Germany,  Italy,  Japan,  Portugal,  Qatar, 
Saudi  Arabia,  South  Korea,  Taiwan,  Netherlands,  the  United  Kingdom,  and  the  United  States  of 
America. Participants who completed this trial were eligible to continue treatment in the currently 
ongoing  extension  study  MOR-005.  Thus,  the  following  sections  of  this  report  will  discuss  the 
conduct and results of this clinical trial. 
Title of Study 
MOR-004: A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Multinational Clinical 
Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of 2.0 mg/kg/qw and 2.0 mg/kg/every other week 
elosulfase alfa in Patients with Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA (Morquio A Syndrome). 
Methods 
Study Participants  
The study included participants > 5 years of age, with documented clinical diagnosis of MPS IVA 
based  on  clinical  signs  and  symptoms  of  MPS  IVA  and  documented  reduced  fibroblast  or 
leukocyte  N-acetylgalactosamine  6  sulfatase  enzyme  activity  or  genetic  testing  confirming 
diagnosis of MPS IVA; had an average Screening 6MWT distance ≥ 30 and ≤ 325 meters; were 
willing to use an acceptable method of contraception during the study (if sexually active); were 
expected  to  be  able  to  comply  with  the  treatment  schedule;  and  had  never  received 
hematopoietic  stem  cell  transplant  or  had  major  surgery  within  3  months  of  study  entry.  The 
CHMP was of the opinion that the included patient population is characteristic for a population of 
patients suffering from Morquio disease.  
Treatments 
Assessment report  
EMA/357933/2014 
Page 37/65 
 
  
  
Subjects randomised to the active drug treatment arms in study MOR-004 received intravenous 
(IV) infusions of elosulfase alfa at a dose of either 2.0 mg/kg/week or 2.0 mg/kg/qow. Subjects 
randomised  to  the  2.0  mg/kg/qow  arm  received  infusions  of  placebo  on  alternating  weeks,  to 
mask  active  drug  weeks.  The  CHMP  noted  that  the  treatment  duration  is  relatively  short  and 
thus, only acute effects can be expected to be observed. Long-term efficacy and maintenance of 
effect cannot be assessed using this pivotal study. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of MOR-004 study was to evaluate the ability of 2.0 mg/kg/week and 2.0 
mg/kg/ every other week (qow) elosulfase alfa, compared with placebo, to enhance endurance in 
subjects  with  mucopolysaccharidosis  IVA,  as  measured  by  increase  in  meters  walked  in  the  6-
minute walk test (6MWT) from Baseline to Week 24. 
The secondary objectives of the study were the following: 
• 
• 
to evaluate the ability of 2.0 mg/kg/week and 2.0 mg/kg/qow elosulfase alfa, compared 
with placebo, to enhance endurance in subjects with MPS IVA, as measured by increase 
in  stairs  climbed  per  minute  in  the  3-minute  stair  climb  test  (3MSCT)  from  Baseline  to 
Week 24. 
to evaluate the ability of 2.0 mg/kg/week and 2.0 mg/kg/qow elosulfase alfa, compared 
with placebo, to reduce normalized urine keratan sulfate levels in subjects with MPS IVA, 
as measured by decrease in urine keratan sulfate levels from Baseline to Week 24. 
The tertiary objectives of the study were: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
to  determine  the  PK  parameters  of  2.0  mg/kg/week  elosulfase  alfa  and  2.0  mg/kg/qow 
elosulfase alfa administered IV in a subset of subjects with MPS IVA. 
to evaluate the ability of 2.0 mg/kg/week and 2.0 mg/kg/qow elosulfase alfa, compared 
with  placebo,  to  improve  respiratory  function  as  measured  by  percentage  increase  in 
pulmonary function tests from Baseline to Week 24. 
to evaluate the effect of 2.0 mg/kg/week and 2.0 mg/kg/qow elosulfase alfa, compared 
with  placebo,  on  biochemical  markers  of  inflammation  and  bone  and  cartilage 
metabolism.  
to evaluate the effect of 2.0 mg/kg/week and 2.0 mg/kg/qow elosulfase alfa, compared 
with placebo, on quality of life as assessed by the MPS HAQ. 
to evaluate the effect of 2.0 mg/kg/week and 2.0 mg/kg/qow elosulfase alfa, compared 
with placebo, on hearing as measured by audiometry. 
to evaluate the effect of 2.0 mg/kg/week and 2.0 mg/kg/qow elosulfase alfa, compared 
with placebo, on cardiac valve function as measured by echocardiogram (ECHO). 
to evaluate the effect of 2.0 mg/kg/week and 2.0 mg/kg/qow elosulfase alfa, compared 
with placebo, on corneal clouding as assessed by physical examination. 
The  safety  objective  of  the  study  was  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  elosulfase  alfa 
infusions, at doses of 2.0 mg/kg/week and 2.0 mg/kg/qow, over a 24-week period.

The CHMP considered that the whole set of the objectives is acceptable to aim for determining a 
reasonable impression of the short-term effects of elosulfase alfa in the indicated patient group.

Sample size 
It was calculated that in study MOR-004, approximately 162 patients were to be enrolled, 54 per 
treatment group, to have  over 90% power for the primary analysis to detect a difference of 40 
meters  in  mean  change  in  the  6MWT  distance  between  the  active  treatment  groups  and  the 
placebo  group,  assuming  that  the  common  standard  deviation  was  65  meters  with  an  overall 
0.05 two-sided significance level with Hochberg method for multiplicity adjustment. The standard 
deviation  of  65  meters  was  considered  conservative  compared  to  the  standard  deviation 
associated  with  the  similar  population  subset  found  in  the  MOR-002  study  (45  to  61  meters  at 
weeks 24 through 48).

Randomisation 
In study  MOR-004, subjects were randomized (1:1:1) for 24 consecutive weeks to one of three 
treatment groups:  
• 
• 
• 
elosulfase alfa 2.0 mg/kg/week, or  
elosulfase alfa 2.0 mg/kg/qow and placebo infusions on alternate weeks, or  
placebo  
Blinding (masking) 
Patients, investigators, and site personnel were blinded to treatment assignment throughout the 
study  and  until  the  final  analysis  was  complete.  The  randomisation  schedule  was  developed  by 
an  independent  third  party  to  ensure  blinding.  Elosulfase  alfa  and  placebo  were  identical  in 
appearance and the placebo solution consisted of the same excipients included in the elosulfase 
alfa  formulation.  Study  drugs  were  labelled  with  the  study  number  and  a  unique  identification 
number. For unblinding in cases of serious or life-threatening AEs formal written approval of the 
applicant’s medical monitor was required. 
Statistical methods 
The  primary  analysis  change  in  6MWT  between  active  treatment  and  placebo  was  compared 
using an analysis of covariance model with baseline 6MWT distance and age group as covariates; 
the Hochberg method was be used for multiplicity adjustment to maintain the overall type I error 
rate  of  0.05.  In  addition,  a  repeated  measure  model  and  a  responder  analysis  were  used  as 
supportive analyses methods together with several sensitivity analyses. The secondary endpoints 
(number  of  stairs  climbed  per  minute  in  the  3MSCT  and  normalized  urine  KS  were  analysed 
similarly. The averages of duplicate 6MW test and 3MSCT results at screening were used as the 
baseline  values.  The  statistical  analyses  for  tertiary  endpoints  were  descriptive.  The  PK 
parameters  were  evaluated  by  non-compartmental  methods  using  nominal  dose  levels,  actual 
infusion duration, and blood sampling times for all calculations.  
The statistical methods were considered adequate and in line with the CHMP protocol assistance.

Participant flow 
Denominators are based on ITT. 
PK samples were drawn from a subset of 65 patients from selected sites. 
Qow: every other week; PP: per-protocol; ITT: intent-to-treat 
a ITT population with no important protocol deviations. 
b All placebo patients PK parameters were not estimable. An elosulfase alfa 2.0 mg/kg/qw patient (1024-4033) had only one 
PK sample, a predose sample at week 0, hence had no estimable PK parameters. 
Recruitment 
The  trial  was  conducted  between  01  February  2011  (first  patient enrolled)  and  16  August  2012 
(last  dose  given).  Patients  who  completed  the  trial  were  eligible  to  enroll  into  extension  study 
MOR-005 initiated July 2011. 
The  study  protocol  was originally  approved  on  10  June  2010  and  amended once  on  04  October 
2010  prior  to  the  start  of  the  trial;  all  patients  were  enrolled  after  this  amendment.  The 
amendment concerned the incorporation of a third treatment arm of 2.0 mg/kg/qow in order to 
evaluate a dose level and regimen with a lower cumulative exposure and more convenience for 
patients, possibly leading to improved patient compliance. 
Based  on  scientific  advice  received  from  CHMP  on  31  May  2012  and  Type  C  meeting  feedback 
received  from  FDA  on  09  July  2012  regarding  the  proposed  statistical  analyses,  the  applicant 
modified  several  of  the  analysis  methods,  and  documented  the  final  analysis  methods  in  the 
Statistical Analysis Plan prior to data unblinding on 19 October 2012. No unscheduled unblindings 
occurred during the study. The proportion of patients with at least one major deviation and the 
categories of deviations seen were similar across treatment groups. The most common deviation 
category pertained to “out of window” infusion times, which was almost exclusively infusion rate 
escalations  of  less  than  13  minutes’  duration  (27.1%  placebo,  25.4%  elosulfase  alfa  2.0 
mg/kg/qow,  25.9%  elosulfase  alfa  2.0  mg/kg/qw).  Upon  clinical  review,  it  was  concluded  that 
these  protocol  deviations  did  not  impact  the  rights,  safety,  or  welfare  of  the  patients  or  the 
integrity of the data.

Baseline data 
There  were  no  relevant  differences  between  groups  in  demographic  baseline  characteristics; 
patients  in  the  elosulfase  alfa  2.0 mg/kg/qw  group  were  slightly  younger  than  in  the  other 
groups with a higher percentage in the 5 to 11 years age group. Baseline disease characteristics 
were  similarly  distributed  across  treatment  groups,  but  the  6MWT  distance  at  baseline  was 
higher in the placebo group compared to both elosulfase alfa groups. The proportion of patients 
with  the  stratification  factor  6MWT  ≤ 200  m  and  > 200  m  was  balanced.  The  number  of  stairs 
climbed per minute in the 3MSCT at baseline was lower in the elosulfase alfa qow group than in 
the placebo or elosulfase alfa qw group, while it was comparable between placebo and elosulfase 
alfa qw groups. Also the proportion of patients who used walking aids at baseline was higher in 
the elosulfase alfa qow group compared to placebo or elosulfase alfa qw. Medical history findings 
were similarly distributed across groups. Prior medication use of glucocorticoids was higher in the 
placebo  group  compared  to  both  elosulfase  alfa  groups.  Compliance  was  high  throughout  the 
trial, with similar mean number of infusions and mean number of incomplete infusions.  
Numbers analysed 
The  ITT  population  consisted  of  all  patients  randomised  and  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of 
study  drug.  The  primary  efficacy  analyses  for  all  efficacy  endpoints  were  based  on  the  ITT 
population and data were analysed according to the treatment assigned at randomisation. The PP 
population was used to perform sensitivity analyses for the primary, secondary, composite, and 
MVV  endpoints.  The  PP  population  was  defined  as  the  subset  of  the  ITT  population  who  were 
compliant with the protocol. The PP populations (% of ITT) were 55 (93.2%) in the placebo, 55 
(93.2%)  in  the  elosulfase  alfa  2.0 mg/kg/qow,  and  52  (89.7%)  in  the  elosulfase  alfa 
2.0 mg/kg/qw  group.  Please  see  figure  above.  The  number  of  patients  excluded  from  the  PP 
analysis was comparable between treatment groups. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
In  the  elosulfase  alfa  2.0  mg/kg/qw  dosing  group,  a  statistically  significant  mean  change  from 
baseline  to  week  24  in  the  6MWT  distance  compared  with  placebo  occurred;  the  change  from 
baseline  was  not  statistically  different  from  placebo  in  the  2.0 mg/kg/qow  group.  The  model 
based  estimated treatment  effect  at  week  24  compared  with  placebo  was  22.5 m  (95%CI:  4.0, 
40.9;  p = 0.0174)  for  the  2.0  mg/kg/qw  regimen  and  0.5 m  (95%CI:  -17.8, 18.9;  p = 0.9542) 
for the 2.0 mg/kg/qow regimen. The effect was already evident at week 12 in the elosulfase alfa 
2.0  mg/kg/qw  dosing  group;  the  mean  changes  from  baseline  (±SD)  at  week  12  were  23.7 m 
(42.2),  13.5 m  (38.4),  and  12.7 m  (35.8)  for  the  elosulfase  alfa  2.0 mg  qw,  elosulfase  alfa 
2.0 mg qow, and placebo group, respectively. Results for the PP population were similar to those 
for the ITT population.

Number and proportion of patients who did not complete 1 of the duplicate tests at baseline or 
week  24  were low  and  comparable  across  groups. The  proportion  of  patients  who  used  walking 
aids  during  the  6MWT  at  any  measurement  was  highest  in  the  elosulfase  alfa  2.0 mg/kg  qow 
group (≈27%), compared with weekly dosing (≈16%), and placebo (≈19%). 
A repeated-measures ANCOVA analysis supported the week 24 findings of the primary analysis. 
An  improvement  in  walking  distance  was  seen  at  week  12  in  all  groups,  at  which  time  point 
improvement  in  the  placebo  and  elosulfase  alfa  2.0  mg/kg/qow  groups  stabilised  at  a  similar 
level.  Results  for  the  PP  population  were  similar  to  those  for  the  ITT  population.  A  responder 
analysis  of  the  estimated  cumulative  distribution  function  showed  a  clear  separation  of  the 
weekly  treatment  group  from  the  placebo  group  across  various  response  thresholds,  while  the 
results for the elosulfase alfa every other week group were similar to placebo. In addition results 
of pre-specified supportive analyses, sensitivity analyses, and subgroup analyses were consistent 
with the primary analysis. 
Part  of  the  difference  in  treatment  response  between  the  two  elosulfase  alfa  dosing  groups  as 
measured by the 6MWT might be attributable to the difference in the proportion of patients using 
walking  aids  during  the  6MWT  at  any  measurement;  this  was  about  27%  in  the  elosulfase  alfa 
every  other  week  group,  compared  to  about  16%  with  weekly  dosing,  and  about  19%  in  the 
placebo  group.  This  does  not  question  the  effect  of  elosulfase  alfa  2.0 mg/kg  every  week  in 
patients with MPS IVA compared to placebo but might have led to a false negative effect in the 
every other week group. On the other hand the responder analysis showed a clear separation of 
the  elosulfase  alfa  weekly  treatment  group  from  the  placebo  group  across  various  response 
thresholds,  while  for  the  elosulfase  alfa  every  other  week  group  results  were  comparable  to 
placebo.

Overall,  the  available  data  show  a  statistically  significant  and  clinically  relevant  effect  of 
elosulfase alfa once a week on the distance walked in the 6MWT compared to placebo, while the 
effects of elosulfase alfa every other week on the primary endpoint are more difficult to interpret. 
Secondary endpoints 
3-Minute Stair-Climb Test 
The  3MSCT  at  week  24  compared  to  baseline  was  only  slightly  and  not  statistically  significantly 
improved in the elosulfase alfa 2.0 mg/kg/qw group (4.8 stairs/min [25.7%]); the difference to 
placebo  was  3.6  stairs/min  (11.4%).  No  difference  compared  to  placebo  at  week  24  was 
observed  in  the  elosulfase  alfa  2.0  mg/kg/qow  group.  At  week  12  improvement  in  the  3MSCT 
was higher in both elosulfase alfa groups compared to placebo [placebo 2.9 stairs/min (10.1%), 
elosulfase  alfa  qow  3.6  stairs/min  (22.7%),  elosulfase  alfa  qw  3.6  stairs/min  (16.6%)]  with 
further  improvement  at  week  24  for  the  elosulfase  alfa  once  a  week  group.  The  number  and 
proportion of patients who did not perform one or both of the duplicate tests at baseline or week 
24 were low and similar across groups. In the placebo group, the same 3 patients (5.1%) did not 
perform  both  baseline  and  both  week  24  tests,  in  the  elosulfase  alfa  every  other  week  group 1 
patient (1.7%) did not perform both baseline tests and a different patient did not perform both 
week 24 tests, and in the elosulfase alfa once a week group 3 patients (5.2%) did not perform 
both  baseline  tests,  and  2  of  these  (3.4%)  did  not  perform  both  week  24  tests  while  the  third 
patient did not perform the early termination test. In all cases the reported reason was that the 
patients  were  physically  unable  to  perform.  The  model  based  estimated  treatment  effects  at 
week 24 compared with placebo were 1.1 stairs/min (95%CI: -2.1, 4.4; p = 0.4935) for the 2.0 
mg/kg/qw  regimen  and  -0.5  stairs/min  (95%CI:  -3.7,  2.8;  p = 0.7783)  for  the  2.0  mg/kg/qow 
regimen. Results for the per protocol population were similar.  
Urine keratan sulfate 
The mean change and mean percent change in the reduction of urine KS from Baseline to Week 
24  were  both  greater  in  the  elosulfase  alfa  treatment  groups  compared  with  placebo.  Mean 
changes  (±SD)  in  the  ITT  population  from  Baseline  at  Week  24  were  -2.8  μg/mg  (±8.0)  for 
placebo,  -12.2  μg/mg  (±16.3)  for  elosulfase  alfa  2.0  mg/kg/qow,  and  -12.6  μg/mg  (±9.5)  for 
elosulfase  alfa  2.0  mg/kg/week.  Treatment  with  elosulfase  alfa  led  to  a  rapid,  sustained,  and 
dose-dependent reduction of urine KS with both elosulfase alfa treatment regimes.  
Tertiary endpoints 
As  regards  the  tertiary  endpoints,  treatment  with  elosulfase  alfa  led  to  a  not  statistically 
significant  improvement  in  the  Maximum  Voluntary  Ventilation  (MVV)  percent  change  from 
baseline compared with placebo at week 24 of about 10% in the elosulfase alfa once a week and 
about 3% in the every other week group; these results were supported by responder analyses. A 
z-score  of  a  composite  measure  comprising  6MWT,  3MSCT,  and  MVV  showed  a  positive 
treatment  effect  compared  with  placebo  at  week  24  for  the  elosulfase  alfa  once  a  week  group 
and  none  in  the  every  other  week  group,  thus  supporting  the  efficacy  of  elosulfase  alfa  once  a 
week  in  patients  with  MPS  IVA.  The  proportions  of  patients  with  improvement  in  2  or  more 
measures were about 16%, 30%, and 42% and the proportions of patients with improvement in 
3 measures were about 0%, 2%, and 10% in the placebo and elosulfase alfa every other week 
and  once  a  week  groups,  respectively.  Treatment  with  elosulfase  alfa  led  to  a  small  numerical 
improvement  in  the  Forced  Vital  Capacity  (FVC)  per  cent  change  from  baseline  compared  to 
placebo  at  week  24,  while  the  effect  on  Forced  Expiratory  Volume  in  1  Second  (FEV1),  Forced 
Assessment report  
EMA/357933/2014 
Page 44/65 
 
  
  
Inspiratory  Vital  Capacity  (FIVC),  and  Forced  Expiratory  Time  (FET)  are  considered  negligible. 
Treatment with elosulfase alfa did not lead to statistically significant changes from baseline in the 
Self Care Domain, the Caregiver Assistance Domain, or the Mobility Domain score compared with 
placebo at week 24. In post-hoc analyses of the MPS HAQ to assess questions about wheelchair 
or  walking  aid  use  yes  or  no,  6,  3,  and  2,  patients  in  the  placebo,  elosulfase  alfa  every  other 
week,  and  once  a  week  groups,  respectively,  subsequently  required  a  wheelchair  at  week  24, 
while  of  those  requiring  a  wheelchair  at  baseline  1,  3,  and  2  patients,  respectively,  no  longer 
required it at week 24; thus the number of patients using a wheelchair at week 24 increased by 
5 in the placebo and 0 in both elosulfase alfa groups as compared to baseline. These differences 
were  not  seen  for  effects  on  walking  aid  use.  Both  dosing  regimens  had  a  positive  treatment 
effect  on  normalised  standing  height  and  growth  rate  z-scores  in  male  patients  ≤ 18  years  and 
female  patients  ≤ 15  years  of  age.  No  meaningful  treatment  effects  were  observed  in 
audiometry,  echocardiogram,  corneal  clouding,  or  lower  extremity  long  bone  length.  elosulfase 
alfa treatment was not associated with reduction of TNFα or change in PIIANP or CTX1 levels.  
Ancillary analyses 
Safety analyses 
None  of  the  176  subjects  who  initiated  dosing  in  this  trial  withdrew  or  discontinued  treatment 
due  to  an  AE  and  >99%  of  subjects  completed  the  study.  The  mean  (±SD)  total  duration  of 
elosulfase  alfa  exposure  was  24.00  (±0.188)  weeks  for  the  2.0  mg/kg/qow  regimen  and  23.57 
(±3.029) weeks for the 2.0 mg/kg/week regimen and few infusions were missed (<2%). Nearly 
all  subjects  reported  at  least  one  treatment-emergent  AE  while  on  study.  The  most  common 
System  Organ  Classes  (SOCs)  for  AEs  in  elosulfase  alfa  -treated  subjects  were  infections  and 
infestations  (66.1%  placebo,  71.2%  elosulfase  alfa  2.0  mg/kg/qow,  and  67.2%  elosulfase  alfa 
2.0 mg/kg/week), general disorders and administration site conditions (62.7%, 67.8%, 65.5%), 
and  gastrointestinal  disorders  (69.5%,  67.8%,  63.8%).  Most  AEs  were  mild  to  moderate  in 
severity.  Study  drug-related  AEs  occurred  in  61.0%  placebo,  71.2%  elosulfase  alfa  2.0 
mg/kg/qow,  and  72.4%  elosulfase  alfa  2.0  mg/kg/week-treated  subjects.  The  most  common 
drug-related  AEs  in  the  placebo,  elosulfase  alfa  2.0  mg/kg/qow,  and  elosulfase  alfa  2.0 
mg/kg/week  treated  subjects,  respectively,  included  pyrexia,  vomiting,  headache  and  nausea, 
and were mild to moderate. Most subjects experienced at least one infusion associated reaction 
(IAR),  (91.5%  placebo,  94.9%  elosulfase  alfa  2.0  mg/kg/qow,  89.7%  elosulfase  alfa  2.0 
mg/kg/week).  Most  IARs  were  mild  to  moderate  in  severity.  Further  safety  analyses  are 
discussed in section 2.6.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
At the time of application for marketing authorisation, only the phase 1/2 trial MOR-002 and the 
pivotal trial MOR-004 were finalised and thus, a comparison of efficacy results across trials is 
limited. Data were summarised for the phase 1/2 study MOR-002 and its extension MOR-100, as 
well as the phase 3 study MOR-004 and its extension MOR-005. Because of the differences in 
trial design, patient populations, study drug dosage, and exposure between the phase 1/2 
programme and the phase 3 programme, efficacy data from studies MOR-002 and MOR-100 was 
not integrated with data from trials MOR-004 and MOR-005. The integrated analyses for the pairs 
of parent and extension studies have been reported in the CSR’s of the relevant extension 
studies MOR-005 and MOR-100, as discussed below in section on Supportive studies.  
Clinical studies in special populations 
Initially, it was reported that the number of subjects using a wheelchair at Week 24 increased by 
5 (8.8%) in the placebo group, and 0 (0%) in both elosulfase alfa treatment groups. In response

to the CHMP’s major objection posed during the assessment, additional data on QoL and clinical 
improvements were submitted, which discuss the lack of evidence for actual clinical benefit for a 
patient.  There  also  appears  to  be  a  benefit  in  the  incidence  of  orthopaedic  surgery  in  favour  of 
the  elosulfase  alfa  treated  patients.  After  72  weeks  treatment,  about  8%  of  the  patients  on 
elosulfase  alfa  treatment  and  about  18%  on  placebo  had  undergone  orthopaedic  surgery.  A 
further analysis of the ADL items from the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) showed some 
improvement  after  24  weeks  treatment  with  most  notably  the  improved  ability  to  dress,  go  to 
the toilet, independent eating and drinking and the ability to get on and off furniture.  
Supportive studies 
Study  MOR-005:  In  this  ongoing  extension  of  study  MOR-004,  the  proportion  of  patients  who 
used  walking  aids  at  baseline  was  higher,  about  twice,  in  the  elosulfase  alfa  qow  group.  There 
were  also  imbalances  between  the  placebo-switch  cohorts  in  endurance  measures  and  age  at 
baseline; the  re-randomisation  was  not  stratified  by  age or  6MWT  categories.  Patients  switched 
from  placebo  to  elosulfase  alfa  qow  had  a  higher  6MWT  and  3MSCT  and  a  lower  baseline  urine 
KS  level,  than  those  switched  to  elosulfase  alfa  qw.  This  indicates  that  patients  switched  from 
placebo  to  the  elosulfase  alfa  every  week  group  had  more  progressed  or  more  severe  disease 
than  those  switched  from  placebo  to  the  every  other  week  group.  Continued  treatment  with 
elosulfase  alfa  showed  a  further  increase  in  6MWT  distance  in  the  QW-QW  cohort  at  week  36 
from  baseline  of  MOR-004,  but  this  improvement  was  not  maintained  in  the  ITT  population  at 
week  48,  where  6MWT  distance  was  comparable  to  that  of  week  24.  Confidence  intervals  were 
widely overlapping and only about half of the patients per treatment group reached the week 48 
assessment during part 1 of study MOR-005. 
In both elosulfase alfa groups, the effects on the reduction of urine KS from study MOR-004 were 
sustained  at  weeks  36  and  48  and  the  reduction  was  higher  in  the  qw  group.  Evaluation  of 
effects on respiratory function tests is limited, but the available data appear to indicate sustained 
effects  on  respiratory  function.  The  results  of  anthropometric  measurements  suggest  that  the 
treatment  effects  on  normalized  standing  height  and  growth  rate  z-scores  in  males  ≤  18  years 
and  females  ≤  15  years  are  maintained  with  longer  term  treatment  in  the  once  a  week  group, 
but standard errors were large. Antibody development occurred in all treated patients but clinical 
efficacy appeared not to have been influenced by total antibody titres. In patients switched from 
placebo,  the effect  of elosulfase  alfa  on  the  6MWT  distance  and on  the  3MSCT  was  significantly 
more pronounced in the qow group, but this might be attributable to the differences in baseline 
characteristics.  
In summary the available data from the ongoing extension trial MOR-005 indicate a sustained 
effect of elosulfase alfa 2.0 mg/kg/qw in patients with MPS IVA. 
Study  MOR-002:  Efficacy  data  from  study  MOR-002  indicate  a  dose  related  response  of 
elosulfase  alfa.  As  regards  the  distance  walked  in  the  6MWT,  after  initially  declining  with  the 
lower  doses  of  elosulfase  alfa  at  weeks  6,  12,  and  18,  it  increased  with  the  elosulfase  alfa 
2.0 mg/kg/qw  dose,  but  after  decreasing  the  dose  to  1.0 mg/kg/qw  in  the  continuation  period, 
the mean change from baseline decreased again. Similarly, in the 3MSCT, the mean stair climb 
rate  only  increased  significantly  with  a  dose  of  elosulfase  alfa  2.0 mg/kg/qw.  The  mean  values 
for  most  of  the  respiratory  function  tests  increased  from  baseline  during  the  36-week  dose-
escalation period, with continued increase through the continuation period. There was a minimal 
change of unclear significance in the mean HAQ category scores during the course of the study.

The bone biomarker procollagen type IIA N-propeptide, a marker reflecting synthesis of type IIA 
collagen,  increased  throughout  the  trial,  while  bone  specific  alkaline  phosphatase,  osteocalcin, 
and PTH remained within normal limits. 
Study  MOR-100:  In  the  ongoing  extension  of  study  MOR-002,  study  MOR-100,  patients  receive 
elosulfase alfa 2.0 mg/kg/qw. Additional 84 weeks of treatment led to sustained improvements in 
the  6MWT  distances  during  the  first  36  weeks,  but  were  more  heterogeneous  thereafter; 
confidence  intervals  were  wide  at  all  time-points.  The  reduction  in  normalised  urine  KS  was 
comparable  to  the  effect  seen  with  elosulfase  alfa  2.0  mg/kg/qw  during  study  MOR-002.  The 
effects on respiratory function tests were generally maintained during study MOR-100. 
Study  MOR-007:  In  the  ongoing  trial  MOR-007,  no  patient  completed  the  52-week  primary 
treatment phase at the time of application. In the 8 patients who completed week 26, elosulfase 
alfa 2.0 mg/kg/qw led to sustained reductions in normalised urine KS.  
Study MOR-001/MorCAP: A natural history study in the MPS IVA population, MorCAP / MOR-001, 
was ongoing at the time of submission of this MAA. The trial started in 2008. Only 325 patients 
were enrolled. These 325 patients were recruited from 10 countries, ranging in age from 1 to 66 
years  with  79%  being  18  years  and  younger;  the  median  age  at  baseline  was  14.5  years.  The 
MorCAP  population  is  estimated  to  include  approximately  10%  of  the  global  MPS  IVA  patient 
population,  enabling  characterization  of  symptoms  and  disease  progression  that  are 
generalizable  to  all  patients.  The  mean  urine  KS  was  higher  in  patients  ≤  18  years  when 
compared to patients >18 years, which may reflect the expected decrease in cartilage formation 
as patients reach puberty and bone growth plates fuse. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  application  is  based  on  one  pivotal  trial,  study  MOR-004.  The  doses  used  in  this  trial  were 
based  on  results  of  study  MOR-002  together  with  non-clinical  data  and  experiences  with  other 
medicinal products for ERTs. The results of study MOR-002 are heterogeneous and interpretation 
is  limited  by  the  dose-escalating  design;  patients  receiving  doses  of  1.0 mg/kg  or  2.0 mg/kg 
were  not  naïve  to  treatment.  The  available  data  are  overall  in  favour  of  the  2.0 mg/kg  every 
week  dose.  The  rational  for  including  an  alternative  dose  group  of  2.0 mg/kg  every  other  week 
into  the  pivotal trial  MOR-004  based on  experiences  with  other  ERTs  is  endorsed  by  the  CHMP. 
Since  there  is  currently  no  causal  treatment  available  for  patients  with  MPS  IVA  the  chosen 
placebo  comparator  is  adequate.  The  design  of  study  MOR-004  and  the  inclusion  and  exclusion 
criteria  to  select  study  participants  are  acceptable.  The  chosen  objectives  are  considered 
adequate  to  investigate  efficacy  and  safety  of  elosulfase  alfa  in  patients  with  MPS  IVA  and  the 
selected  endpoints  are  considered  suitable  for  the  objectives  of  this  trial.  The  primary  endpoint 
was  discussed  during  the  CHMP  protocol  assistance  in  2012  (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/381641/2012). 
The discriminatory ability of the 6MWT for this patient population and whether clinically relevant 
differences in this parameter can be expected in a 24 weeks’ time frame for this condition were 
questioned, but it is agreed that no other single endpoint that would be more sensitive could be 
identified  at  the  present  time.  The  proposed  secondary  and  tertiary  analyses  are  considered 
helpful in order to support the clinical relevance of elosulfase alfa efficacy.

The sample size calculation is adequate and the study population is large relative to other phase 
3  studies  for  ERTs.  The  randomisation  strategy  and  blinding  were  appropriate.  The  statistical 
methods  are  acceptable  and 
in 
line  with 
the  CHMP  protocol  assistance 
in  2012 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/381641/2012).  The  protocol  amendments  are  not  considered  to  affect  the 
outcome  of  this  trial  in  a  negative  way.  Protocol  deviations  appear  to  be  equally  distributed 
across  study  groups  and  no  critical  protocol  deviations  have  been  identified.  No  unscheduled 
unblindings  occurred  during  the  trial  and  only  1  patient  in  the  elosulfase  alfa  2.0 mg/kg  every 
week group discontinued the study. No patient discontinued the study drug permanently while in 
the trial. 
The  combination  of  study  populations  in  the  elosulfase  alfa  clinical  development  programme 
appears to encompass the spectrum of age and disease severity of the overall patient population 
diagnosed with Morquio A syndrome. More specifically, the inclusion of patients based on genetic 
typing  as  conducted  in  MOR-004  trial,  results  in  an  attenuated  population  which  is  more 
comparable  with  the  population  expected  to  be  treated.  Disease  characteristics  appear 
representative  of  the  range  of  disease  symptoms  reported  in  the  literature  and  are  similar  to 
characteristics of MPS IVA subjects in the natural history study MorCAP (MOR-001). Since study 
MorCAP  represented  approximately  10%  of  the  overall  patient  population,  results  from  the 
elosulfase  alfa  clinical  studies  are  anticipated  to  be  generalizable  to  the  overall  MPS  IVA 
population.  The  results  of  the  natural  history  study,  including  clinical  milestones  like  time  to 
wheelchair  dependency  or  respiratory  assist  or  corrective  surgery  or  death,  might  be  used as  a 
reference population; however, this information is currently not available. The long term efficacy 
and safety of elosulfase alfa could not be established within the current clinical programme and 
remains  to  be  confirmed  in  clinical  practise.  The  CHMP  was  in  agreement  with  the  set-up  of  a 
disease  specific  registry  for  patients  diagnosed  with  Morquio  disease,  who  are  treated  with 
Vimizim. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The results of the dose escalating study MOR-002 including PK data, urinary KS data, preliminary 
efficacy  indicators  (6MWT,  3MSCT),  and  various  respiratory  function  tests  suggest  that  the 
highest  clinical  activity  lies  with  2.0  mg/kg/qw  elosulfase  alfa.  In  general,  the  results  were 
sustained through the extension period (study MOR-100).  
Within  the  pivotal  study  MOR-004,  baseline  and  disease  characteristics  were  comparable 
between  the  treatment  groups.  A  large  variation  was  seen  in  the  baseline  levels  of  6MWT, 
varying  between  36  meters  and  321  meters.  This  can  however  be  expected,  given  the 
heterogeneity  of  the  disease.  Treatment  with  elosulfase  alfa  at  2  mg/kg/qw  dose  led  to 
improvements  in  6MWT,  whereas  no  effect  was  observed  at  dose  2  mg/kg/qow.  The  mean 
difference with placebo in the primary endpoint 6-MWT was 22.5 meters at week 24 and this was 
statistically significant. The clinical relevance of this difference can be derived from the secondary 
parameters and additional information on clinically important events. Given the improvement in 
3MSCT, MVV, wheelchair dependency, orthopaedic surgery and ADL function, the observed effect 
of  the  6MWT  can  be  considered  clinical  relevant.  The  reduction  in  urine  KS  observed  for  both 
dosing regimens suggests a reduction in overall accumulated body and tissue storage of KS, and 
indicates an activity of the enzyme on a lysosomal level.

As the disease impacts different organs, multiple clinically relevant endpoints are of importance 
in  terms  of  providing  further  support  for  clinical  efficacy.  Overall,  secondary  endpoints  show  a 
trend  for  improvement.  The  results  of  the  3MSCT  support  the  efficacy  of  weekly  injections  in 
contrast  to  the  every  other  week  injections.  Other  endpoints  like  respiratory  function  and 
anthropometric  measures  also  showed  an  improvement  with  2.0  mg/kg/qw  elosulfase  alfa, 
supporting  the  primary  outcome.  This  was  further  supported  by  results  of  the  MPS  Health 
assessment questionnaire, although not all domains showed an improvement.  
Additional  analyses  showed  an  increase  in  wheelchair  use  observed  in  the  placebo  group  (n=5) 
that  was  not  seen  in  the  treated  arms  (n=0)  at  week  24.  Additional  data  on  QoL  and  clinical 
improvements indicate a benefit. Further the incidence of orthopaedic surgery is in favour of the 
elosulfase alfa treated patients. After 72 weeks treatment about 8% of the patients on elosulfase 
alfa treatment and about 18% had undergone orthopaedic surgery. A further analysis of the ADL 
items from the HAQ showed some improvement after 24 weeks treatment with most notably the 
improved ability to dress, go to the toilet, independent eating and drinking and the ability to get 
on and off furniture. 
The  long-term  effects  have  not  been  demonstrated  yet.  Although  most  data  suggest  that  the 
treatment-effect is sustained in the long-term, overall interpretation is hampered by the limited 
number  of  patients  in  the  clinical  trials.  Given  the  heterogeneity  of  the  disease  severity  and 
progression of disease, clinically relevant efficacy should be supported by sufficient data obtained 
over a longer period before robust conclusions on patient benefit can be drawn. Thus, the CHMP 
imposed a disease-specific registry to be set up and followed in the post-authorisation phase to 
collect such clinical results.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Treatment  of  Morquio  A  patients  with  elosulfase  alfa  in  the  proposed  dose  regimen  (2.0 
mg/kg/weekly) results in a statistically significant improvement of the 6MWT, which was agreed 
to  be  the  primary  endpoint.  This  effect  is  supported  by  a  trend  for  improvement  in  various 
secondary endpoints. A benefit appears to be present in the incidence of orthopaedic surgery in 
favour of the elosulfase alfa treated patients. A further analysis of the ADL items from the HAQ 
showed some improvement after 24 weeks treatment with most notably the improved ability to 
dress,  go  to  the  toilet,  independent  eating  and  drinking,  and  the  ability  to  get  on  and  off 
furniture. Furthermore, a reasonable number of patients should be treated over the various years 
given the chronic condition and the time necessary to observe differences in the clinical relevant 
endpoints  (e.g.  wheelchair  dependency,  respiratory  assist,  corrective  surgery  and  death). 
Moreover, the treated patients will be followed up for up to 5 years via enrolment into a registry, 
not  only  for  efficacy  but  also  for  safety  reasons.  As  formal  commitment  it  is  part  of  the  CHMP 
imposed post-authorisation measures.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy and 
safety: 
The Applicant should set up an MPS IVA disease registry to assess the long term safety and 
efficacy of elosulfase alfa: The number of subjects enrolled in the clinical studies is small and 
adverse reactions with a frequency of uncommon or less may not have been detected. To 
overcome some of the limitations of the safety database including detection of adverse reactions

(ARs) due to prolonged exposure, ARs with a long latency or AEs due to cumulative effects, the 
applicant is requested to set up a disease registry. Furthermore, in light of the potentially life 
long treatment with elosulfase alfa, additional long term efficacy data are considered key for 
continued benefit risk assessment. 
The applicant committed to setting up this registry within an agreed timeline. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The clinical safety database of elosulfase alfa includes results from six clinical trials in 235 
subjects with MPS IVA between the ages of 0.8 and 57.4 years, who were exposed to elosulfase 
alfa. The combination of study populations encompasses the spectrum of age and disease 
severity of the overall patient population. Subjects were exposed for up to 169.7 weeks of 
continuous treatment. Exposure to study drug has been nearly maximal in the 6 studies with 
≥98% of the infusions performed on schedule.  
In the Proposed Dose Population, a total of 222 subjects were treated with elosulfase alfa at the 
dose of 2.0 mg/kg/week for periods ranging from 1 week to 100.1 weeks. The mean (± SD) total 
elosulfase alfa dose per subject was 56.8 (± 54.89) mg/kg. In the Proposed Dose Population with 
Long Term Exposure, a total of 52 subjects were treated with elosulfase alfa at the dose of 2.0 
mg/kg/week for periods ranging from 49.0 weeks to 100.1 weeks. Total elosulfase alfa dose per 
subject ranged from 84.6 mg/kg to 193.5 mg/kg.  
Adverse events 
The most common AEs observed during the treatment with elosulfase alfa were associated with 
infusions and included vomiting, pyrexia, and headache, as summarised in the table below.

Each dosing weeks column only contains events starting within that duration interval; Data in the >48 week 
column contains data from weeks 49 to 100. 
Mapping was based on MedDRA version 15.0. 
Most  subjects  experienced  at  least  1  infusion  associated  reactions  (IAR).  Although  some  AEs 
during infusion required slowing or stopping of the infusion and, medical intervention, all subjects 
received and tolerated subsequent infusions. IARs tended to occur less frequently with duration 
of treatment. In general, safety data are available from 86 subjects who have been exposed to 
elosulfase  alfa  for  more  than  48  weeks,  including  52  subjects  who  have  been  exposed  at  the 
proposed  dose  of  2.0  mg/kg/week  for  more  than  48  weeks.  Analyses  of  these  data  show  that 
elosulfase  alfa  continues  to  be  well  tolerated  with  longer-term  exposure.  When  examining  AE 
profiles  over  time  on  an  annualized  basis,  the  majority  of  events  decreased  over  time  or 
remained  stable.  The  mean  annualized  frequencies  of  AEs  including  related  AEs  and  IARs 
decreased over time. In addition, the mean annualized frequencies of SAEs and Hypersensitivity 
AEs did not increase over time. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  and  hypersensitivity  AEs  occurred  infrequently.  Most  SAEs  were 
related to the underlying disease or to intravenous administration of the investigational product. 
No deaths occurred until the data cut-off dates of the relevant trials. In the pivotal study MOR-
004,  the  incidence  of  SAE  was  highest  elosulfase  alfa  2.0 mg/kg/qw  group  and  lowest  in  the 
placebo  group.  Comparisons  of  individual  SAEs  between  placebo  and  elosulfase  alfa  is  not 
possible since most SAEs occurred only once except for pneumonia with 2 events.

Immunological events 
Hypersensitivity reactions were reported for about 20% of the patients in the elosulfase alfa 2.0 
mg/kg/week.  Due  to  hypersensitivity  reactions,  two  2  infusions  had  to  be  interrupted  and  one 
infusion could not be completed. The hypersensitivity reactions appear not dose dependent. The 
incidence  of  the  hypersensitivity  reactions  does  not  change  over  time.  In  the  Proposed  Dose 
Population,  infusion  associated  reactions  (IARs)  were  reported  for  71.2%  subjects.  There  were 
decreases  with  duration  of  treatment  in  the  mean  subject-year  frequencies  of  IARs  and  IARs 
during  infusion.  The  most  common  infusion  associated  reactions  (IARs)  by  incidences  (and 
annualized  frequencies)  were  pyrexia,  26.1%  (0.77  IAR  events/subject  year),  vomiting  23.0% 
(1.06),  and  headache,  22.5%  (1.37).  The  frequencies  of  IARs  were  generally  higher  during  the 
first  12  weeks  of  treatment  than  during  subsequent  treatment  duration  intervals,  and  the  IARs 
tended to occur less frequently with time. In the Proposed Dose Population, 13.96% of subjects 
had AEs during infusion that required infusion interruption or discontinuation as well as medical 
intervention  to  treat  the  event.  Infusions  interrupted  due  to  an  AE  which  also  required  medical 
intervention  were  reported  for  11.26%  of  total  subjects;  infusions  discontinued  due  to  an  AE 
which  also  required  medical  intervention  were  reported  for  4.50%  of  total  subjects.  Across 
studies, IARs related to elosulfase alfa infusion were generally mild to moderate in severity and 
manageable  with  symptomatic  treatment  and/or infusion  rate  modification.  A  minority  (<0.8%) 
of  infusions  in  the  All  Exposed  Population  were  interrupted  or  discontinued  and  also  required 
medical intervention.

Laboratory findings 
No clinically relevant changes in laboratory findings (haematology, blood chemistry, liver or 
kidney function, urinalysis) have been noted. No clinically significant abnormal ECG findings have 
been noted. In study MOR-004, no clear effect of elosulfase alfa on cardiac function was seen in 
echocardiogram (ECHO) data, but the trial was limited to 24 weeks and from the extension study 
MOR-005 no ECHO data are available. However, in study MOR-002, where relevant long-term 
ECHO data are available, no patient had clinically significant abnormal ECHO findings. The 
incidence of both mitral and aortic regurgitation increased from baseline over the study, but the 
applicant explained that this effect is consistent with the progression of MPS.  
Safety in special populations 
Information  on  safety  in  special  populations,  e.g.  in  children  below  5  years  of  age,  are  limited; 
the relevant paediatric study MOR-007 is on-going in line with the agreed PIP. The limited data 
from this trial indicate that the incidence of vomiting and pyrexia is higher in this population than 
in  previous  elosulfase  alfa  studies  in  patients  older  than  5  years  of  age.  Incidences  of  SAEs 
decreased  in  the  age  groups  over  11  years  of  age,  while  mean  annualized  frequencies  of 
hypersensitivity AEs and IARs were similar between age groups. 
There was no relevant effect of gender or ethnicity on AEs. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No drug-drug or drug-disease interaction studies were performed and no data on safety related 
to drug-drug or other interactions have been provided.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
After  initiation  of  mandatory  premedication  for  patients  in  order  to  manage  IARs,  no  patient 
experienced an AE that resulted in permanent discontinuation of study drug or withdrawal from 
study as of the respective data cut-off. 
Post marketing experience 
Vimizim  has  not  been  marketed  in  any  country  at  the  time  of  application  and  thus,  data  from 
post-marketing use are not available. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  applicant  has  provided  safety  data  from  6  clinical  studies  in  235  patients  with  MPS  IVA 
exposed to elosulfase alfa including the finalised pivotal trial MOR-004, the only study providing 
placebo-controlled  safety  data.  Although  this  safety  database  is  limited  due  to  the  size  of  the 
clinical studies, it is considered adequate for a rare disease MAA. In the placebo controlled study 
MOR-004 most AEs were graded mild to moderate in severity. The most commonly reported AEs 
were vomiting, pyrexia, and headache. These were also the most common AEs considered study-
drug related. No deaths occurred until the data cut-off dates of the relevant trials.  
In  study  MOR-004  the  incidence  of  SAE  was  highest  elosulfase  alfa  2.0 mg/kg/qw  group  and 
lowest  in the  placebo  group.  SAEs  appear  to  be  either  infusion  or  procedure related,  or  are  not 
distinguishable  from  complications  of  the  underlying  disease  including  knee  deformity,  poor 
venous access, otitis media, and lower respiratory tract infection.  
Assessment report  
EMA/357933/2014 
Page 56/65 
 
  
  
The  risk  of  hypersensitivity  reactions  is  adequately  described  in  the  SmPC  together  with 
recommendations  on  how  to  treat  reactions.  After  initiation  of  mandatory  premedication  for 
patients  to  manage  IARs  no  patient  experienced  an  AE  that  resulted  in  permanent 
discontinuation  of  study  drug  or  withdrawal  from  study  as  of  the  respective  data  cut-off.  Most 
patients  had  at  least  one  infusion  associated  reaction  (IAR)  and  the  most  common  IARs  were 
headache,  vomiting,  and  pyrexia.  IARs  led  more  than  twice  as  often  to  infusion  interruption  in 
the  elosulfase  alfa  groups  as  in  the  placebo  group.  The  SmPC  includes  an  adequate  warning  to 
the physicians as well as advice on how to deal with cases of IAR. All patients in the clinical trials 
became anti-elosulfase alfa total antibody (TAb) positive; about 80% showed anti-elosulfase alfa 
specific  neutralizing  antibodies  (NAb)  and  about  10%  developed  anti-elosulfase  alfa  IgE.  For 
neither  TAb  nor  NAb  a  clear  association  with  loss  of  efficacy  was  observed.  Higher  TAb  or  NAb 
titres have not been associated with increased incidence or severity of hypersensitivity AEs and 
IgE positivity has not consistently been associated with hypersensitivity AEs or drug interruption 
or discontinuation. No clinically relevant changes in laboratory findings have been noted.  
Information on safety in children below 5 years of age is limited, as the relevant paediatric study 
MOR-007  is  on-going,  in  line  with  the  agreed  PIP.  The  SmPC  reflects  the  currently  available 
information  in  paediatric  patients.  The  majority  of  patients  who  received  Vimizim  during  clinical 
studies were in the paediatric and adolescent age range (5 to 17 years). The treatment of young 
children < age 5 years might be started, although this population was not included in the pivotal 
study, but further data are expect to become available with the progress of study MOR-007. It is 
also important to start the treatment of these patients as soon as possible. The CHMP considered 
it reassuring that the safety results to date in 15 patients less than 5 years of age are consistent 
with  results  observed  in  patients  5  to  57  years  old  and  no  unexpected  events  were  noted.  The 
CHMP requested an amendment of the proposed indication in order to emphasize that Vimizim is 
indicated for treatment of patients of all ages. 
The indication for Vimizim, as adopted by the CHMP is:  
Vimizim  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  mucopolysaccharidosis,  type  IVA  (Morquio  A 
Syndrome, MPS IVA) in patients of all ages. 
Overall, the number of subjects enrolled in the clinical studies is small and adverse reactions with 
a  frequency  of  uncommon  or  less  may  not  have  been  detected.  To  overcome  some  of  the 
limitations of the safety database including detection of adverse reactions (ARs) due to prolonged 
exposure,  ARs  with  a  long  latency  or  AEs  due  to  cumulative  effects,  the  CHMP  requested  the 
applicant  to  set  up  a  disease-specific  registry.  Furthermore,  in  light  of  the  potentially  life  long 
treatment  with  elosulfase  alfa,  additional  long  term  efficacy  data  are  considered  key  for 
continued benefit risk assessment. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included 
in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The most common side effects observed with Vimizim treatment are infusion reactions, including 
anaphylaxis,  hypersensitivity  and  vomiting.  These  and  other  safety  issues  have  generally  been 
adequately  addressed  in  the  PI.  The  safety  database  is  too  limited  to  draw  robust  conclusions, 
Assessment report  
EMA/357933/2014 
Page 57/65 
 
  
  
with  52  subjects  being  exposed  to  the  proposed  dose  for  more  than  48  weeks.  However,  the 
applicant has committed to set up a registry and to follow Morquio A patients up to 10 years and 
for  safety  as  well  as  for efficacy  reasons.  Furthermore,  a  reasonable  number  of  patients  should 
be treated over various years given the chronic condition.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
MPS  IVA  is  a  rare,  inherited  disorder  caused  by  mutations  of  the  gene  that  codes  for  the 
lysosomal  enzyme  N-acetyl-galactosamine  6-sulfatase  (GALNS).  The  most  common  features  of 
patients  with  MPS  IVA  are  progressive  skeletal  dysplasia,  frequent  surgical  procedures  mostly 
related  to  musculoskeletal  or  respiratory  dysfunction  and  a  significant  limitation  in  mobility, 
endurance,  and  respiratory  function.  Currently  treatment  options  are  limited  to  treatment 
alleviation  of  the  signs  and  symptoms  (treatment  of  infections,  corrective  surgery,  wheelchair 
etc.).  Vimizim  (elosulfase  alfa)  is  a  recombinant  form  of  human  N-acetylgalactosamine-6-
sulfatase  (rhGALNS),  and  is  identical  to  the  naturally  occurring  human  lysosomal  enzyme.  The 
enzyme reaches the lysosome and exerts its function there.

Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
For  the  primary  endpoint  6  minute  walk  test  (6MWT)  statistical  significance  was  shown  in  the 
pivotal  study  for  the  every  week  regimen  with  a  mean  difference  with  placebo  in  the  primary 
endpoint  6-MWT  of  22.5  meters  at  week  24.  For  most  secondary  endpoints  improvement  was 
seen although none of the differences reached statistical significance. Treatment with the every 
other week regimen resulted in walking distances comparable to placebo. 
Data from MOR-002 and on-going studies (MOR-005, MOR-100, MOR-007, and MOR-008) further 
supported the efficacy of elosulfase alfa when administered intravenously at 2.0 mg/kg/week in 
subjects  with  MPS  IVA.  Treatment  with  elosulfase  alfa  was  shown  to  be  effective,  albeit  not 
always statistically significant, in improving performance in endurance tests (6MWT and 3MSCT), 
respiratory  function  tests  (FVC,  MVV,  forced  expiratory  volume  in  1  second  [FEV1],  forced 
inspiratory vital capacity [FIVC]), anthropometric measurements (standing height, length, sitting 
height, and weight), and in reducing urinary KS. Further, additional data show that the number 
of  subjects  using  a  wheelchair  at  Week  24  increased  by  5  (8.8%)  in  the  placebo  group,  and  0 
(0%) in both elosulfase alfa treatment groups.  
Additional  data  on  QoL  and  a  reduction  in  the  incidence  of  orthopaedic  surgery  in  favor  of  the 
elosulfase  alfa  treated  patients  further  indicate  clinical  improvement.  After  72  weeks  treatment 
about 8% of the patients on elosulfase alfa treatment and about 18% in the placebo group had 
undergone orthopaedic surgery. A further analysis of the ADL items from the HAQ showed some 
improvement  after  24  weeks  treatment  with  most  notably  the  improved  ability  to  dress,  go  to 
the  toilet,  independent  eating  and  drinking  and  the  ability  to  get  on  and  off  furniture. 
Improvements in efficacy measures and decreases in urine KS were maintained in the presence 
of  sustained  positive  anti-  elosulfase  alfa  antibody  results,  and  there  was  no  apparent 
relationship  between  TAb  titer,  or  the  presence  of  neutralizing  receptor  binding  antibody,  and 
efficacy outcomes. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Assessment  of  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  observed  effects  for  the  overall  population  is 
hampered by the large variability seen in the mean change in 6MWT from baseline. This probably 
relates  to  the  heterogeneity  of  the  patient  population  included  which  varied  considerably  with 
patients  being  able  to  walk  between  36  and  322  meter  in  the  6MWT.  A  reasonable  number  of 
patients should be treated over various years given the chronic condition and the time necessary 
to observe differences in the clinically relevant endpoints (among others wheelchair dependency, 
respiratory  assist,  corrective  surgery  and  death).  It  is  unclear  whether  an  increase  in  the  dose 
could  enhance  the  efficacy.  The  applicant  has  committed  to  follow  up  on  the  patients  up  to  5 
years, not only for efficacy but also for safety reasons. A disease-specific registry will thus be set 
up in the post-authorisation phase. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The clinical safety database includes safety results from 6 clinical trials in 235 subjects with MPS 
IVA  exposed  to  elosulfase  alfa,  and  includes  subjects  between  the  ages  of  0.8  and  57.4  years. 
Assessment report

The  combination  of  study  populations  in  the  elosulfase  alfa  clinical  development  program 
encompasses  the  spectrum  of  age  and  disease  severity  of  the  overall  patient  population. 
Subjects  were  exposed  for  up  to  169.7  weeks  of  continuous  treatment  (overall  mean  [SD]) 
duration of exposure was 50.2 [±37.03] weeks), with 52 subjects being exposed to the proposed 
dose  for  more  than  48  weeks.  Most  adverse  events  (including  SAE)  were  infusion  associated 
reactions  (IARs)  or  could  be  considered  disease  related.  Limited  long-term  safety  data  suggest 
that the frequency of IARs decreases over time.  There were no clinically meaningful changes in 
laboratory values, ECGs, or ECHOs. Across studies, IARs related to elosulfase alfa infusion were 
generally  mild  to  moderate  in  severity  and  manageable  with  symptomatic  treatment  and/or 
infusion rate modification.  
Hypersensitivity reactions were reported for about 20% of the patients in the elosulfase alfa 2.0 
mg/kg/week. In the Proposed Dose Population, IARs were reported for 71.2% subjects. 13.96% 
of subjects had AEs during infusion that required infusion interruption or discontinuation as well 
as medical intervention to treat the event. Infusions interrupted due to an AE which also required 
medical intervention were reported for 11.26% of total subjects; infusions discontinued due to an 
AE which also required medical intervention were reported for 4.50% of total subjects. From the 
total of infusions, <0.8% in the All Exposed Population were interrupted or discontinued and also 
required medical intervention 
There  was  no  apparent  increase  in  incidence  of  AEs,  study  drug  related  AEs,  or  SAEs  with 
increasing  dose  or  increasing  treatment  duration.  The  majority  of  SAEs  were  consistent  with 
events expected in untreated patients with MPS IVA disease. 
All  subjects  treated  with  elosulfase  alfa  developed  a  persistent  anti-  elosulfase  alfa  antibody 
response.  TAb  titer  levels  were  sustained  in  all  subjects  over  the  course  of  treatment  and  Nab 
antibodies  were  commonly  detected.  Despite  the  high  incidence  of  anti-  elosulfase  alfa 
antibodies,  decreases  in  urinary  KS  and  improvements  in  efficacy  measures  were  sustained  in 
treated  subjects.  No  correlations  were  found  between  higher  TAb  titers or  higher  NAb  positivity 
and hypersensitivity AEs in elosulfase alfa treated subjects. Hypersensitivity AEs did not increase 
in incidence or severity with time of treatment or with development of anti-drug antibodies. Anti- 
elosulfase  alfa  IgE  was  detected  in  6.8%  and  8.6%  of  the  2.0  mg/kg/qow  and  2.0  mg/kg/qw 
subjects  in  MOR-004,  respectively.  Anti-  elosulfase  alfa  IgE  positivity  has  not  been  associated 
with hypersensitivity AEs or treatment withdrawal, with the exception of one subject in MOR-002. 
The  reason  for  increased  clinical  relevance  of  IgE  positivity  in  the  early  study  may  have  been 
related  to  the  unique  dose  escalation  treatment  schedule  in  MOR-002  and/or  the  lack  of  pre-
treatment with anti-histamines in this early subject. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The  safety  database  is  too  limited  to  draw  robust  conclusions.  Further  a  reasonable  number  of 
patients should be treated over various years. The applicant has committed to follow up on the 
patients  up  to  10  years,  not  only  for  efficacy  but  also  for  safety  reasons.  A  disease-specific 
registry will thus be set up in the post-authorisation phase. 
Assessment report  
EMA/357933/2014 
Page 62/65 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Benefit-risk balance 
The  observed  statistically  significant  increase  in  6-MWT  translates  into  a  clinical  benefit  for  the 
patient population. Maintenance of effect and long-term clinical important improvements need to 
be  demonstrated  in  a  long-term  follow-up  study.  Further  the  short-term  safety  profile  appears 
manageable. The safety database, however, is limited both in duration and in actual numbers.  
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
An effects table summarising the benefits and risks is provided below. 
There  is  a  clear  rationale for  the  product in  the  proposed disease,  where  treatment  options  are 
limited.  The  shown  effectiveness  indicates  benefit  to  the  patient  with  a  clear  clinically  relevant 
effect.  Effect  size  might  also  differ  based  on  baseline  disease  status.  Effects  on  more  functional 
endpoints,  including  MPS  HAQ  appear  small  but  consistent.  Again,  this  may  be  due  to  the 
heterogeneity of the population. Clinically important milestones (for example start of wheelchair 
dependency or start of respiratory aids), could provide additional support for efficacy taking into 
account  the  baseline  disease  characteristics  of  the  patients,  but  it  is  recognised  that  this  might 
be difficult before licensing.   
Although  the  limited  safety  database  is  of  concern,  preliminary  data  appear  promising  due  the 
lack  of  frequent  serious  adverse  events.  Further  data  will  be  collected  during  the  post-
authorisation phase through the spontaneous notification and the disease specific registry.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Available  information  strongly  suggests  that  the  increase  in  6-MWT  results  obtained  with  once-
weekly  dosing  of  Vimizim  is  accompanied  by  other  clinically  relevant  endpoints  and  therefore 
translates into a benefit for the patient population with an acceptable AE profile. Therefore, the 
benefit-risk balance is positive. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The clinical efficacy of Vimizim will be further supported by additional long term clinically relevant 
milestones  such  as  delay  of  wheelchair  dependence,  delay  in  time  to  respiratory  assistance, 
fewer and more simple corrective operations or improvement of other events that has a serious 
impact on the QoL of the patient. The applicant has committed to assess through the set-up of a 
registry  which  is  imposed  as  a  condition  to  the  marketing  authorisation.  Currently,  the  safety 
information  is  limited,  nevertheless,  data  so  far  available  do  not  indicate  a  major  safety  issue. 
The  enzyme  as  such  does  introduce  surprisingly  little  agent  specific  adverse  events  except  for 
infusion related reactions. All infusion associated reactions can be treated with interruption of the 
infusion, or medical intervention or both, as reflected in the SmPC.

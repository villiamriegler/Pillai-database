CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1. Therapeutic indications
Treatment of adult patients with acromegaly who have had an inadequate response to surgery and/or 
radiation therapy and in whom an appropriate medical treatment with somatostatin analogues did not 
normalise IGF-I concentrations or was not tolerated.
4.2. Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of 
acromegaly.
Posology
A loading dose of 80 mg pegvisomant should be administered subcutaneously under medical 
supervision. Following this, SOMAVERT 10 mg reconstituted in 1 ml of solvent should be 
administered once daily as a subcutaneous injection.
Dose adjustments should be based on serum IGF-I levels. Serum IGF-I concentrations should be 
measured every four to six weeks and appropriate dose adjustments made in increments of 5 mg/day in 
order to maintain the serum IGF-I concentration within the age-adjusted normal range and to maintain 
an optimal therapeutic response.
Assessment of baseline levels of liver enzymes prior to initiation of SOMAVERT
Prior to the start of SOMAVERT, patients should have an assessment of baseline levels of liver tests 
(LTs) [serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), serum total bilirubin 
(TBIL), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP)]. For recommendations regarding initiation of SOMAVERT 
based on baseline LTs and recommendations for monitoring of LTs while on SOMAVERT, refer to 
Table A in Special warnings and precautions for use (4.4).
The maximum dose should not exceed 30 mg/day.
For the different dose regimens, the following strengths are available: SOMAVERT 10 mg, 
SOMAVERT 15 mg, SOMAVERT 20 mg, SOMAVERT 25 mg and SOMAVERT 30 mg.
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of SOMAVERT in children aged 0 to 17 years have not been established. No 
data are available.
Elderly
No dose adjustment is required.
Hepatic or renal impairment
The safety and efficacy of SOMAVERT in patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency has not been 
established.
Method of administration
Pegvisomant should be administered by subcutaneous injection.
3
The site of injection should be rotated daily to help prevent lipohypertrophy.
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.
4.3. Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
4.4. Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Growth hormone-secreting tumours
As growth hormone-secreting pituitary tumours may sometimes expand, causing serious 
complications (e.g. visual field defects), it is essential that all patients be carefully monitored. If 
evidence of tumour expansion appears, alternative procedures may be advisable.
Serum IGF-1 monitoring
Pegvisomant is a potent antagonist of growth hormone action. A growth hormone deficient state may 
result from administration of this medicinal product, despite the presence of elevated serum growth 
hormone levels. Serum IGF-I concentrations should be monitored and maintained within the 
age-adjusted normal range by adjustment of the pegvisomant dose.
ALT or AST elevations
Prior to the start of SOMAVERT, patients should have an assessment of baseline levels of liver tests 
[serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), serum total bilirubin 
(TBIL), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP)].
Evidence of obstructive biliary tract disease should be ruled out in patients with elevations of ALT and 
AST or in patients with a prior history of treatment with any somatostatin analogue. Administration of 
pegvisomant should be discontinued if signs of liver disease persist.
For recommendations regarding initiation of SOMAVERT, based on baseline liver tests (LTs) and 
recommendations for monitoring of liver tests while on SOMAVERT, refer to Table A.

for periodic monitoring of LTs during SOMAVERT treatment
Baseline LT Levels
Recommendations
Normal
Elevated, but less than or
equal to 3 times ULN
Greater than 3 times ULN
 May treat with SOMAVERT. 
 Serum concentrations of ALT and AST should be 
monitored at 4- to 6-week intervals for the first 6 months 
of treatment with SOMAVERT, or at any time in patients 
exhibiting symptoms suggestive of hepatitis.
 May treat with SOMAVERT; however, monitor LTs 
monthly for at least 1 year after initiation of therapy and 
then bi-annually for the next year.
 Do not treat with SOMAVERT until a comprehensive 
workup establishes the cause of the patient’s liver 
dysfunction.
 Determine if cholelithiasis or choledocholithiasis is 
present, particularly in patients with a history of prior 
therapy with somatostatin analogs. 
 Based on the workup, consider initiation of therapy with 
SOMAVERT. 
 If the decision is to treat, LTs and clinical symptoms 
should be monitored very closely.
Abbreviations: ALT = alanine aminotransferase; AST = aspartate transaminase; LT = liver test; 
ULN = upper limit of normal.
If a patient develops LT elevations, or any other signs or symptoms of liver dysfunction while 
receiving SOMAVERT, the following patient management is recommended (Table B).
Table B. Clinical recommendations based on abnormal liver test results while on SOMAVERT
Recommendations
 May continue therapy with SOMAVERT. However, monitor 
LTs monthly to determine if further increases occur.
 May continue therapy with SOMAVERT. However, monitor 
LTs weekly to determine if further increases occur (see 
below).
 Perform a comprehensive hepatic workup to discern if  an 
alternative cause of liver dysfunction is present. 
 Discontinue SOMAVERT immediately.
 Perform a comprehensive hepatic workup, including serial 
LTs, to determine if and when serum levels return to normal.
 If LTs normalise (regardless of whether an alternative cause 
of the liver dysfunction is discovered), consider cautious 
reinitiation of therapy with SOMAVERT, with frequent LT 
monitoring.
 Immediately perform a comprehensive hepatic workup. 
 If liver injury is confirmed, the drug should be discontinued. 
LT Levels and Clinical 
Signs/Symptoms
Elevated, but less than or equal to 
3 times ULN
Greater than 3 but less than 5 times 
ULN (without signs/symptoms of 
hepatitis or other liver injury, or 
increase in serum TBIL) 
At least 5 times ULN, or transaminase 
elevations at least 3 times ULN 
associated with any increase in serum 
TBIL (with or without 
signs/symptoms of hepatitis or other 
liver injury)
Signs or symptoms suggestive of 
hepatitis or other liver injury (e.g., 
jaundice, bilirubinuria, fatigue, 
nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant 
pain, ascites, unexplained oedema, 
easy bruisability) 
Hypoglycaemia
The study conducted with pegvisomant in diabetic patients treated either by insulin or by oral 
hypoglycaemic medicinal products revealed the risk of hypoglycaemia in this population. Therefore, 
5
in acromegalic patients with diabetes mellitus, doses of insulin or hypoglycaemic medicinal products 
may need to be decreased (see section 4.5).
Improved fertility
The therapeutic benefits of a reduction in IGF-I concentration which results in improvement of the 
patient’s clinical condition could potentially also improve fertility in female patients (see section 4.6).
Pregnancy
Acromegaly control may improve during pregnancy. Pegvisomant is not recommended during 
pregnancy (see section 4.6). If pegvisomant is used during pregnancy, IGF-I levels should be closely 
monitored and pegvisomant doses may need to be adjusted (see section 4.2) based on IGF-I values.
Sodium content
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose. Patients on low sodium 
diets can be informed that this medicinal product is essentially ‘sodium-free’.
4.5.
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed. It should be considered whether to continue treatment 
with somatostatin analogues. The use of this medicine in combination with other medicinal products 
for the treatment of acromegaly has not been extensively investigated.
Patients receiving insulin or oral hypoglycaemic medicinal products may require dose reduction of 
these active substances due to the effect of pegvisomant on insulin sensitivity (see section 4.4).
Pegvisomant has significant structural similarity to growth hormone which causes it to cross-react in 
commercially available growth hormone assays. Since serum concentrations of 
therapeutically-effective doses of this medicine are generally 100 to 1000 times higher than the actual 
serum growth hormone concentrations seen in acromegalics, measurements of serum growth hormone 
concentrations will be spuriously reported in commercially available growth hormone assays. 
Pegvisomant treatment should therefore not be monitored or adjusted based on serum growth hormone 
concentrations reported from these assays.
4.6. Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There are limited amount of data from the use of pegvisomant in pregnant women. Animal studies are 
insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
SOMAVERT is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using 
contraception.
If pegvisomant is used during pregnancy, IGF-I levels should be closely monitored, especially during 
the first trimester. It may be necessary to adjust the dose of pegvisomant during pregnancy (see section 
4.4).
Breast-feeding
The excretion of pegvisomant in breast milk has not been studied in animals. Clinical data are too 
limited (one reported case) to draw any conclusion on the excretion of pegvisomant in human breast 
milk. Therefore, pegvisomant should not be used in breast-feeding women. However, breast-feeding 
may be continued if this medicine is discontinued: this decision should take into account the benefit of 
pegvisomant therapy to the mother and the benefit of breast-feeding to the child.
6
Fertility
For pegvisomant no data on fertility are available.
The therapeutic benefits of a reduction in IGF-I concentration which results in improvement of the 
patient’s clinical condition could potentially also improve fertility in female patients.
4.7. Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
4.8. Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The list below contains adverse reactions seen in clinical trials with SOMAVERT.
In clinical studies, for patients treated with pegvisomant (n=550), the majority of adverse reactions to 
pegvisomant were of mild to moderate intensity, of limited duration and did not require 
discontinuation of treatment.
The most commonly reported adverse reactions occurring in  10% of patients with acromegaly 
treated with pegvisomant during the clinical trials were headache 25%, arthralgia 16% and diarrhoea 
13%.

Description of selected adverse reactions
Most injection site reactions characterised as localised erythemas and soreness, spontaneously
resolved with local symptomatic treatment, while pegvisomant therapy continued. Occurrence of 
injection site hypertrophy has been observed, including lipohypertrophy.
The development of isolated low-titre anti-growth hormone antibodies was observed in 16.9% of 
patients treated with pegvisomant. The clinical significance of these antibodies is unknown.
Systemic hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, laryngospasm, 
angioedema, generalised skin reactions (rash, erythema, pruritus, urticaria) have been reported in post 
marketing use. Some patients required hospitalization. Upon re-administration, symptoms did not 
re-occur in all patients.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9. Overdose
There is limited experience of overdose with pegvisomant. In the one reported incident of acute 
overdose, where 80 mg/day was administered for 7 days, the patient experienced a slight increase in 
fatigue and dry mouth. In the week following discontinuation of treatment the adverse reactions noted 
were: insomnia, increased fatigue, oedema peripheral, tremor, and weight gain. Two weeks after 
stopping treatment, leukocytosis and moderate bleeding from injection and vein puncture sites was 
observed which were considered possibly related to pegvisomant.
In cases of overdose, administration of this medicine should be discontinued and not resumed until 
IGF-I levels return to within or above the normal range.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1. Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other anterior pituitary lobe hormones and analogues, ATC code: 
H01AX01.
Mechanism of action
Pegvisomant is an analogue of human growth hormone that has been genetically modified to be a 
growth hormone receptor antagonist. Pegvisomant binds to growth hormone receptors on cell surfaces, 
where it blocks growth hormone binding, and thus interferes with intracellular growth hormone signal 
transduction. Pegvisomant is highly selective for the GH receptor, and does not cross-react with other 
cytokine receptors, including prolactin.
Pharmacodynamic effects
Inhibition of growth hormone action with pegvisomant leads to decreased serum concentrations of 
insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), as well as other growth hormone-responsive serum proteins such 
as free IGF-I, the acid-labile subunit of IGF-I (ALS), and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 
(IGFBP-3). 
Clinical efficacy and safety
Acromegalic patients (n=112) have been treated in a 12-week, randomised, double-blind, multicentre
study comparing placebo and pegvisomant. Dose-dependent, statistically significant reductions in 
mean IGF-I (p<0.0001), free IGF-I (p<0.05), IGFBP-3 (p<0.05) and ALS (p<0.05) were observed at 
all post-baseline visits in the pegvisomant treatment groups. The serum IGF-1 was normalised at the 
end of the study (week 12) in 9.7%, 38.5%, 75% and 82% of subjects treated with placebo, 10 mg/day, 
15 mg/day or 20 mg/day pegvisomant respectively. 
Statistically significant differences from placebo (p<0.05) were observed for improvements in the total 
signs and symptoms score for all dose groups compared to placebo.
A cohort of 38 acromegalic subjects has been followed in a long-term, open-label, dose-titration study 
for at least 12 consecutive months of daily dosing with pegvisomant (mean = 55 weeks). The mean 
IGF-I concentration in this cohort fell from 917 ng/ml to 299 ng/ml on pegvisomant, with 92% 
achieving a normal (age-adjusted) IGF-I concentration.
In different studies and also in Acrostudy, pegvisomant normalised IGF-1 levels in a high percentage 
of patients (>70%) and significantly decreased fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and fasting plasma 
insulin (FPI) levels.
Pegvisomant also improves insulin sensitivity, this is likely due to a blockade of the GH receptors on 
tissues, mainly the liver and also adipose tissue, kidneys, and skeletal muscles, thereby removing the 
detrimental effect of GH on insulin signaling, lipolysis, and gluconeogenesis. However, the 
mechanism of action of all these effects is not known with certainty. A decrease in doses of insulin or 
hypoglycaemic medicinal products may be needed in acromegalic patients with diabetes mellitus (see 
sections 4.4 and 4.5).
10
5.2. Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption
Absorption of pegvisomant following subcutaneous administration is slow and prolonged, and peak 
serum pegvisomant concentrations are not generally attained until 33-77 hours after administration. 
The mean extent of absorption of a subcutaneous dose was 57% relative to an intravenous dose.
Distribution
The apparent volume of distribution of pegvisomant is relatively small (7-12 L).
Biotransformation
The metabolism of pegvisomant has not been studied.
Elimination
The mean total body systemic clearance of pegvisomant following multiple doses is estimated to be 
28 ml/h for subcutaneous doses ranging from 10 to 20 mg/day. Renal clearance of pegvisomant is 
negligible and accounts for less than 1% of total body clearance. Pegvisomant is slowly eliminated 
from serum, with mean estimates of half-life generally ranging from 74 to 172 hours following either 
single or multiple-doses.
Linearity/non-linearity
After single subcutaneous pegvisomant administration no linearity is observed with rising doses of 
10, 15 or 20 mg. Approximately linear pharmacokinetics is observed at steady state in the population 
pharmacokinetic studies. The data from 145 patients in two long-term studies who received daily 
doses of 10, 15, or 20 mg, demonstrate pegvisomant mean serum concentrations (± SD) of 
approximately 8800 ± 6300, 13200 ± 8000 and 15600 ± 10300 ng/ml, respectively.
The pharmacokinetics of pegvisomant are similar in normal healthy volunteers and acromegaly 
patients, although heavier individuals tend to have a higher total body clearance of pegvisomant than 
lighter individuals, and may thus require greater doses of pegvisomant.
5.3. Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on studies of repeated dose toxicity in 
rat and monkey. However, due to the marked pharmacological response in monkey, systemic 
exposures higher than those achieved in patients at therapeutic doses have not been studied. 
Malignant fibrous histiocytomas associated with fibrosis and histiocytic inflammation were observed 
at injection sites in males in the rat carcinogenicity study at exposure levels equivalent to three times 
the human exposure based on mean plasma concentrations in two long-term studies at a daily dose of 
30 mg. The relevance of this response for humans is currently unknown. The increased incidence of 
injection site tumours was most probably caused by irritation and the high sensitivity of the rat to 
repeated subcutaneous injections.
Early embryonic development and embryo-foetal development studies were conducted in pregnant 
rabbits with pegvisomant at subcutaneous doses of 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day. There was no evidence of 
teratogenic effects associated with pegvisomant administration during organogenesis. At 
10 mg/kg/day (6 times the maximum human therapeutic dose based on body surface area), an increase 
in post-implantation loss was observed in both studies. No fertility study has been conducted.

6.6. Special precautions for disposal and other handling
The syringe and safety needle used to administer the injection are provided with the medicinal
product.
Before attaching the supplied safety needle the syringe cap will need to be removed from the pre-filled 
syringe. This is achieved by snapping it off. The syringe should be kept upright to avoid leakage and 
the end of the syringe should not be allowed to contact anything.
The powder should be reconstituted with 1 ml solvent. When adding the solvent from the syringe the 
vial and syringe should held at an angle as shown in the diagram below.
Add the solvent to the vial of powder. The solvent should be emptied into the vial slowly to avoid the 
possibility of a foam forming. This would make the medicine unusable. Gently dissolve the powder 
with a slow, swirling motion. Do not shake vigorously, as this might cause denaturation of the active 
substance.
After reconstitution, the reconstituted solution should be inspected visually for extraneous (or for any 
foreign) particulate matter or any variation in physical appearance prior to administration. In the event 
of either being observed, discard the medicinal product.
13
Before withdrawing the dissolved SOMAVERT invert the vial with the syringe still inserted into it 
and ensure the gap in the stopper can be seen as shown in the diagram below:
Pull the needle down so that the needle tip is at its lowest point in the liquid. Slowly withdraw the 
plunger in the syringe to withdraw the medicine from the vial. If air is seen in the syringe, tap the 
barrel to float the bubbles to the top, and then gently push the bubbles out into the vial.
Before disposing of the syringe and needle fold the needle guard over the needle and ensure it clicks 
into place. The syringe and needle should never be reused.
For single use only. Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in 
accordance with local requirements.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What SOMAVERT is and what it is used for
SOMAVERT is used for the treatment of acromegaly, a hormonal disorder resulting from the 
increased secretion of growth hormone (GH) and IGF-I (Insulin-like growth factors), which is 
characterised by overgrowth of bone, soft tissue swelling, heart disease and related disorders.
The active substance in SOMAVERT, pegvisomant is known as a growth hormone receptor 
antagonist. These substances decrease the action of GH and levels of IGF-I circulating in the blood.
2. What you need to know before you use SOMAVERT
Do not use SOMAVERT

If you are allergic to pegvisomant or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using SOMAVERT.
-
-
-
-
If you experience disturbed vision or headaches you must contact your doctor immediately.
Your doctor or nurse will monitor the levels of IGF-I (Insulin-like growth factors) circulating in 
the blood and adjust the dose of SOMAVERT if necessary.
Your doctor should also monitor your adenoma (benign tumour).
Your doctor will conduct tests of your liver function before starting and during treatment with 
SOMAVERT. If these test results are not normal, your doctor will discuss treatment options 
with you. Once treatment begins, your doctor or nurse will monitor the level of liver enzymes in 
60
the blood every 4-6 weeks for the first 6 months of treatment with SOMAVERT. Administration 
of SOMAVERT should be discontinued if signs of liver disease persist.
If you are diabetic, your doctor may need to adjust the amount of insulin or other medicines you 
are using.
Fertility in women patients may be increased as the disease improves. The use of this medicine 
in pregnant women is not recommended and women of childbearing age should be advised to 
use a contraception. See also the section about Pregnancy below.
-
-
Other medicines and SOMAVERT
You must tell your doctor if you have previously used other medicines for the treatment of acromegaly
or medicines for the treatment of diabetes.
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using or have recently used any other medicines.
As part of your treatment you may be given other medicines. It is important to keep using all your 
medicines as well as SOMAVERT unless you are told otherwise by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility
The use of SOMAVERT in pregnant women is not recommended. If you are a women of childbearing 
age, a contraception should be used during treatment.
It is not known if pegvisomant passes into breast milk. You should not breast-feed while taking 
SOMAVERT unless your doctor has discussed this with you.
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
Driving and using machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
SOMAVERT contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per dose i.e. essentially ‘sodium-free’.
3.
How to use SOMAVERT
Always inject this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure.
A starting dose of 80 mg of pegvisomant will be given subcutaneously (just under the skin) by your 
doctor. Following this, the usual daily dose of pegvisomant is 10 mg, which is given by subcutaneous 
injection (just under the skin).
Every four to six weeks your doctor will make appropriate dose adjustments, made in increments of 
5 mg pegvisomant/day, based on your so-called serum IGF-I levels to maintain an optimal therapeutic 
response. 
Method and route of administration
SOMAVERT is injected under the skin. The injection can be self-administered or given by another 
person, for example your doctor or his/her assistant. The detailed instructions on injection procedure 
provided at the end of this leaflet must be followed. You should continue to inject this medicine for as 
long as instructed by your doctor.
This medicine must be dissolved before use. The injection must not be mixed in the same syringe or 
vial as any other medicine.
61
Fatty tissue of the skin can build-up at the site of injection. To avoid this, use a slightly different place 
for your injection each time, as described in Step 2 of the ‘instructions for preparing and giving an 
injection of SOMAVERT’ section of this leaflet. This gives your skin and the area under your skin 
time to recover from one injection before it receives another one in the same place.
If you have the impression that the effect of this medicine is too strong or too weak, talk to your 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
If you inject more SOMAVERT than you should
If you accidentally inject more SOMAVERT than told to by your doctor it is unlikely to be serious, 
but you should contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately.
If you forget to use SOMAVERT
If you forget to give yourself an injection you should inject the next dose as soon as you remember 
and then continue to inject SOMAVERT as prescribed by your doctor. Do not inject a double dose to 
make up for forgotten individual doses.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

67
2.
Getting ready
Before you start:





Only mix SOMAVERT and the solvent when you are ready to inject your dose.
Remove a single SOMAVERT pack from the refrigerator and allow it to come to room 
temperature naturally in a safe place.
Wash your hands with soap and water, and dry thoroughly. 
Peel open the packaging of the syringe and safety needle to make it easier to pick up each

Do not use the syringe or vial if: 
o they are damaged or faulty; 
o the expiration date has passed; 
o it has been frozen, even if it has now thawed (syringe only).
3.
Choose injection area




Choose a different location within an area for each injection. 
Avoid bony areas or areas that are bruised, red, sore or hard, or areas that have scars or 
skin conditions. 
Clean the injection area with the alcohol swab as instructed by your healthcare provider.
Allow the injection area to dry.
68
4.
Remove vial cap


Remove the cap from the vial.
Throw the cap away; it is not needed again.
Caution: Do not let anything touch the vial stopper.
5.
Remove syringe cap



Snap off the syringe cap. It may take more effort to snap off than you might expect.
Throw the syringe cap away; it is not needed again.
Keep the syringe upright to avoid leakage.
Caution: Do not let the end of the syringe touch anything when the syringe cap is off.
69
6.
Attach safety needle

Twist the safety needle firmly onto the syringe as far as it will go.
7.
Remove needle cover



Fold the needle guard out of the way of the needle cover.
Carefully pull the needle cover straight off.
Throw the needle cover away; it is not needed again.
Caution: Do not let the needle touch anything.
70
8.
Insert needle


Push the needle through the centre of vial stopper, as shown.
Support the syringe while the needle is in the vial stopper to prevent bending the needle.
9.
Add liquid




Tilt both the vial and syringe at an angle, as shown.
Push the plunger rod down slowly until all the liquid has emptied into the vial.
Caution: Do not squirt the liquid directly onto the powder, as this creates foam. Foam 
makes the medicine unusable.
Do not withdraw the needle yet.
71
10.
Swirl vial



Support both the syringe and vial in one hand, as shown.
Gently swirl the liquid, sliding the vial in a circular motion on a flat surface.
Continue swirling the liquid until all the powder has fully dissolved.
Note: This may take up to 5 minutes.
11. Check medicine


Keeping the needle in the vial, look carefully at the medicine. It must be clear and free of 
particles.
Do not use if:
o
o
o
the medicine is cloudy or hazy;
the medicine has any colour at all;
there are any particles or there is a layer of foam in the vial.
72
12. Reposition needle



Turn the vial so that you can see the stopper gap, as shown.
Pull the needle down so that the needle tip is at the lowest point in the liquid. This will 
help you to draw off as much liquid as possible.
Check that the plunger rod has not moved—if it has, then push it back all the way into the 
syringe. This ensures that all air is removed from the syringe before you draw off the 
dose.
13. Draw off dose


Slowly pull back the plunger rod to withdraw as much medicine as possible from the vial.
Note: If you see air in the syringe, tap the barrel to float the bubbles to the top, and then 
gently push the bubbles out into the vial.
Pull the needle out of the vial.
73
14.
Insert needle


Gently pinch the skin at the site of injection. 
Insert the needle to its full depth into the pinched skin.
15.
Inject medicine


Push the plunger rod down slowly until the barrel is empty.
Note: Make sure you keep the needle in at full depth.
Release the pinched skin and pull the needle straight out.
74
16. Make needle safe


Fold the needle guard over the needle.
Gently apply pressure using a hard surface to lock the needle guard in place.
Note: You will hear a click when the needle guard has been locked.
17. Dispose

The syringe and needle should NEVER be reused. Dispose of the needle and syringe as 
instructed by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist and in accordance with local health and 
safety laws.
75
18. After injection


If necessary, use a clean cotton ball and press lightly on the injection area.
Do not rub the area.
QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
What should I do if anything has accidentally touched the vial stopper?

Clean the vial stopper with a fresh alcohol wipe, and leave it to dry completely. If you are 
unable to clean the stopper, do not use the vial.
What should I do with the syringe if it has been dropped?

Do not use it—even if it looks undamaged. Dispose of the syringe in the same way as a 
used syringe. You will need a replacement syringe.
How many times can I safely insert the needle into the vial stopper?

Once only. Withdrawing and reinserting greatly increases the risk of needle damage, and 
will blunt the needle. This can cause discomfort and increases risk of skin damage and 
infection. There is also a risk you may lose some of the medicine.
Is it OK to shake the vial if the powder is not dissolving?

No—never shake the vial. Shaking can destroy the medicine and create foam. The 
powder may take a few minutes to dissolve fully, so continue swirling the vial gently 
until the liquid is completely clear.
How can I tell if there is any foam in the vial?
•
Foam looks like a mass of small bubbles that float as a layer to the top of the liquid. Do 
not inject SOMAVERT if it has foamed.
76
How can I prevent the medicine from foaming?

Press the plunger very slowly so that the liquid gently runs down the inside of the vial. 
Do not spray the liquid directly onto the powder, as this creates foam. This technique will 
also reduce the swirling time and allow more of the medicine to be drawn off.
I can see some air in the syringe. Is this OK?

Tiny air bubbles in the liquid are normal and are safe to inject. However, it is possible to 
accidently draw air into the syringe, which should be removed before injecting. Bubbles 
or air gaps that float to the top of the liquid should be pushed back out into the vial.
Why can’t I get all of the medicine out of the vial?

The shape of the vial means that a very small amount of the medicine will be left behind 
in the vial. This is normal. To ensure that only a trace of medicine remains, make sure the 
needle tip is as low as it can be in the vial when drawing off your dose.
What should I do if I have any doubts about my medicine?

All questions should be handled by a doctor, nurse or pharmacist familiar with 
SOMAVERT.

Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Lonquex 
lipegfilgrastim 
On 23 June 2022, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion 
recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Lonquex. 
The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Teva B.V. 
The CHMP adopted an extension to an existing indication to include use in children 2 years of age and older. 
For information, the full indication for Lonquex will therefore be as follows:2 
Lonquex is indicated in adults and in children 2 years of age and older for reduction in the 
duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients treated with cytotoxic 
chemotherapy  for  malignancy  (with  the  exception  of  chronic  myeloid  leukaemia  and 
myelodysplastic syndromes). 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report (EPAR) 
and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to the marketing 
authorisation has been granted by the European Commission. 
1 Summaries of positive opinion are published without prejudice to the Commission decision, which will normally be issued 67 
days from adoption of the opinion

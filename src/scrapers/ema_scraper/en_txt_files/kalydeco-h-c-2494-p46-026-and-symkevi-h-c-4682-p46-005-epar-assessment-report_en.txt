1.  Introduction 
On 06 February 2019, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study Study VX16-661-114 for 
Symkevi (tezacaftor/ivacaftor) 100 mg/150 mg film coated tablets in a combination regimen with 
ivacaftor 150 mg tablets, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
Study VX16-661-114 involved the use of two authorised medicinal products held by Vertex 
Pharmaceuticals (Ireland) Limited:  
- Symkevi (tezacaftor/ivacaftor) 100 mg/150 mg film coated tablets.  
- Kalydeco (ivacaftor) 150 mg film-coated tablets  
The same Article 46 submission has therefore been submitted in parallel for Kalydeco.  
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
Study VX16-661-114 is a Phase 3b, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Parallel Group 
Study to Assess the Safety, Efficacy, and Tolerability of Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor (TEZ/IVA) in an Orkambi-
experienced Population Who Are Homozygous for the F508del-CFTR Mutation.  In the EU, TEZ/IVA is 
approved as a combination regimen of Symkevi® with IVA 150-mg tablets (Kalydeco®) for the 
treatment of patients with CF 12 years of age and older who are homozygous for the F508del-CFTR 
mutation or who are heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation and have 1 of the following 
mutations in the CFTR gene: P67L, R117C, L206W, R352Q, A455E, D579G, 711+3A→G, S945L, S977F, 
R1070W, D1152H, 2789+5G→A, 3272-26A→G, and 3849+10kbC→T. 
Vertex initiated a postmarketing study on respiratory safety (Study 114) in CF subjects 12 years of age 
and older, homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. Respiratory safety was evaluated based on the 
incidence of respiratory adverse events of special interest (RAESIs), which include 7 Preferred Terms 
(PTs) predefined to explore selected adverse events (AEs) within the respiratory system. These terms 
are the same as those summarized in the Orkambi SmPC as “respiratory adverse reactions.”  
In addition, conventional CF endpoints were evaluated to assess the safety and efficacy of TEZ/IVA in 
CF subjects homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation and who discontinued treatment with Orkambi 
due to respiratory symptoms considered related to treatment. Evaluation of AEs, clinical parameters 
(laboratory assessments, vital signs, physical examinations, and pulse oximetry), and post-dose 
spirometry provided further measures of safety. Spirometry and the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-
Revised (CFQ-R) were used to assess efficacy. 
Orkambi (LUM/IVA) was registered before Symkevi in CF subjects homozygous for the F508del-CFTR 
mutation.  In LUM/IVA, there was a decline in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second 
(ppFEV1) observed within 4 hours of LUM/IVA dosing in Phase 1 studies with healthy subjects. Post-
dose spirometry was not assessed in Phase 3 studies with LUM/IVA, but the incidence of respiratory 
symptoms (i.e., chest discomfort, dyspnea, and respiration abnormal) was 22.0% in subjects who 
received the commercialized dose of the LUM/IVA and 13.8% in subjects who received placebo. Post-
marketing data for Orkambi suggested that patients discontinued treatment due to respiratory events.  
Study VX16-661-114, is a stand-alone study. A line listing is not provided as Study VX16-661-114 is 
not part of a development program for Symkevi or Kalydeco.

2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study<ies> 
No new paediatric formulation was evaluated in Study 114. The test product was the same as the 
commercially approved product, Symkevi, for patients 12 years of age and older (TEZ 100-mg/IVA 
150-mg fixed-dose combination tablets). The test product was administered to study subjects orally at 
a dose of TEZ 100-mg once daily (qd)/IVA 150-mg every 12 hours (q12h), which is also the 
commercially approved dose of Symkevi. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
VX16-661-114: Phase 3b, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Parallel Group Study to 
Assess the Safety, Efficacy, and Tolerability of Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor (TEZ/IVA) in an Orkambi-
experienced Population Who Are Homozygous for the F508del-CFTR Mutation. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study  
VX16-661-114: Phase 3b, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Parallel Group Study to 
Assess the Safety, Efficacy, and Tolerability of Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor (TEZ/IVA) in an Orkambi-
experienced Population Who Are Homozygous for the F508del-CFTR Mutation.  
Dates of Study: 
Study initiation: 24 May 2017 (date first eligible subject signed the informed consent form) 
Study completion: 09 August 2018 (date last subject completed the last visit) 
Description 
This was a Phase 3b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter study in 
CF subjects 12 years of age and older who are homozygous for F508del and who discontinued Orkambi 
due to respiratory symptoms considered related to treatment. This study was designed to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of TEZ/IVA. 
At the time this study initiated, Orkambi was the only modulator therapy approved for CF subjects 
homozygous for F508del. Tezacaftor, an experimental CFTR corrector, in combination with IVA, was 
being evaluated in several Phase 3 studies in CF subjects who are either homozygous for F508del or 
heterozygous for F508del with other CFTR mutations. Since subjects entering this study were not 
taking corrector/potentiator therapy, the use of placebo in this study was deemed ethical and 
necessary to adequately assess the benefit of TEZ/IVA treatment.

Removal/Replacement of Subjects 
Subjects could have withdrawn from the study at any time at their own request.  
A subject will be withdrawn from study drug treatment for any of the following reasons: 
−  A female subject or a female partner of a male subject has a confirmed pregnancy.  
−  Treatment unblinding by the investigator.  
−  Development of a life-threatening AE or a serious AE (SAE) that places him/her at immediate 
risk, and discontinuation of study drug treatment and withdrawal from the study are deemed 
necessary. 
− 
Following randomization, the screening CFTR genotype results does not confirm study 
eligibility. The subject will undergo ETT and/or Safety Follow-up Contact and will then be 
discontinued from the study. After discontinuation of study drug treatment, the subject will not 
undergo any further assessments other than those performed at the ETT and/or Safety Follow-
up Contact. 
A subject may be withdrawn from study drug treatment after a discussion between the investigator 
and the medical monitor for any of the following reasons:

−  Development of a medical condition that requires prolonged concomitant therapy with a 
prohibited medication or prolonged interruption of the study drug.  
−  Noncompliance with study requirements.  
−  An increase in liver function  
−  Development of a cataract or lens opacity. 
Rapporteurs’ comments 
The inclusion criteria are compliant with the indication. The inclusion criterion ‘discontinuation of 
Orkambi within approximately 12 weeks due to a respiratory sign or symptom related to Orkambi’ 
complies with the objective of this study. Therefore, the inclusion criteria are justified.  
The exclusion criteria are similar to the initial studies performed for Symkevi, and are acceptable.  
Prior and Concomitant Medications 
• Subjects remained on a stable medication (including supplements and inhaled antibiotics) regimen 
for their CF from 28 days before Day 1 through the Safety Follow-up Contact. A stable medication 
regimen was defined as the current medication regimen for CF that subjects had been following for at 
least 28 days before Day 1.  
• There were no restrictions on the concomitant use of corticosteroids. 
• Information about bronchodilator use during the study was collected and documented. Subjects who 
were using a bronchodilator had their spirometry assessments performed according to the guidelines. 
Rapporteurs’ comments 
Definition of prior and concomitant medication is acceptable.  
Additional Dietary Restrictions/Prohibited Medications 
Prohibited medications and certain foods were not allowed in this study (Screening Period through the 
Safety Follow-up Contact:  
- moderate and strong CYP3A inhibitors (except ciprofloxacin),  
- moderate and strong CYP3A inducers ,  
- certain fruits and fruit juices (Grapefruit, grapefruit juice, Seville oranges, marmalade).  
Commercially available CFTR modulators (e.g., Kalydeco, Orkambi, or others) were not allowed within 
28 days or 5 terminal half-lives before screening, whichever was longer through the Safety Follow-up 
Contact.  
Rapporteurs’ comments 
Additional dietary restrictions and prohibited medication are in line with the recommendations for 
Symkevi.

Table 2 Study VX16-661-114: Treatment Period, ETT, and Safety Follow-up Contact 
Assessments 
AE: adverse event; CFQ-R: Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised; ETT: Early Termination of Treatment; ICF: 
informed consent form; PE: physical exam; IWRS: interactive web response system; SAE: serious adverse event 
a All assessments were performed before dosing unless noted otherwise. 
b On Day 3, there was a telephone contact to collect AEs. 
c If the subject prematurely discontinued study drug treatment, an ETT Visit was scheduled as soon as possible 
after the decision to terminate study treatment. Subjects who prematurely discontinued study drug treatment 
were also required to complete the Safety Follow-up Contact, approximately 28 (± 7) days after their last dose of 
study drug. If the ETT Visit occurred 3 weeks or later following the last dose of study drug, then the ETT Visit 
replaced the Safety Follow-up Contact, and a separate Safety Follow-up Contact was not required. 
d Telephone contact was acceptable. A clinic visit was required at the discretion of the investigator. 
e Randomization occurred after all inclusion and exclusion criteria were met and before the first dose of study drug. 
Randomization was done through IWRS. Randomization occurred on Day -1. 
f The CFQ-R was completed as the first assessment at each visit. 
g Pre-dose spirometry was performed before dosing and prebronchodilator at all visits. Post-dose spirometry was 
performed at 2 hours (± 30 minutes) and 4 hours (± 30 minutes) after dosing on Day 1 only. 
h Vital signs (pulse rate, blood pressure, and respiration rate) and pulse oximetry were collected after the subject 
had been at rest in the seated or supine position for at least 5 minutes. Vital signs and pulse oximetry were 
collected pre-dose at all visits. 
i In addition to the complete PEs indicated, symptom-targeted PEs occurred at any time during the study if 
triggered by AEs or if deemed necessary by the investigator. 
j Includes serum chemistry, hematology, coagulation and urinalysis. 
k Fat-containing food such as a “standard CF” high-fat, high-calorie meal or snack was provided at the site to 
subjects after all pre-dose assessments occurred. 
l On days of scheduled visits, the morning dose of study drug was administered at the site after pre-dose 
assessments had been completed. 
m For enrolled subjects who did not have a Safety Follow-up Contact, AEs and SAEs were collected through the 
earliest of either 28 days after the last dose of study drug, or the ETT Visit (if that visit was 3 weeks or later 
following the last dose of study drug).

Spirometry 
Spirometry was performed according to the ATS/ERS guidelines.  
Pre-bronchodilator spirometry was defined as spirometry testing performed for subjects who had 
• withheld their short-acting bronchodilators for more than 4 hours before the spirometry assessment; 
• withheld their twice-daily, long-acting bronchodilator for more than 12 hours before the spirometry 
assessment;  
• withheld their once-daily, long-acting bronchodilator for more than 24 hours before the spirometry 
assessment. 
The parameters, FEV1 (L), Forced vital capacity (FVC) (L), FEV1/FVC (ratio), Forced expiratory flow 
25% to 75% (L/s) were normalized using the standards of Wang et al. (for female subjects aged 12 to 
15 years [inclusive] and male subjects aged 12 to 17 years [inclusive]) or Hankinson et al. (for female 
subjects aged 16 years and older and male subjects aged 18 years and older): 
Post-dose spirometry assessment was performed 2 hours (± 30 minutes) and 4 hours (± 30 minutes) 
after dosing on Day 1.  
In the event that a subject forgets to withhold bronchodilator(s), spirometry should be performed 
according to the following: 
− 
− 
If a subject’s Day 1 spirometry is performed prebronchodilator, but on a subsequent visit the 
subject does not withhold bronchodilator, a postbronchodilator spirometry will be obtained for 
that visit only, and the visit will not be rescheduled. 
If a subject does not withhold his/her dose of bronchodilator on Day 1, spirometry at that visit 
and at all subsequent visits (according to the schedule of assessments detailed in Table 3-2) 
should be performed postbronchodilator.  
−  Each spirometry assessment will be recorded in the source documents as pre- or 
postbronchodilator.  
Rapporteurs’ comments 
Spirometry is performed according to ATS/ERS criteria.  
Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised 
Subjects completed the CFQ-R in their native language before the start of any other assessments. 
Subjects who were <14 years of age at Day 1 completed the CFQ-R child version themselves, and their

parents/caregivers completed the CFQ-R Parent version, at all visits, regardless of whether the subject 
subsequently turned 14 years of age during the study. Subjects 14 years of age and older at Day 1 
completed the adolescent/adult version of the questionnaire themselves at all visits. 
Rapporteurs’ comments 
Different CFQ-R for the age groups is according to standard practice.  
Pulse Oximetry 
Arterial oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was assessed following at least a 5-minute rest (seated or 
supine).  
Ophthalmologic Examination 
Subjects <18 years of age who did not have an ophthalmological examination prior to starting Orkambi 
underwent an ophthalmologic examination if they had not had an ophthalmologic examination within 6 
months before the Screening Period. Additional ophthalmologic examinations were conducted at the 
discretion of the investigator. 
Statistical Methods 
Sample size calculation 
Sample size calculation was based on the key secondary endpoint of absolute change in ppFEV1 to the 
average of the Day 28 and Day 56 measurements. 
A Bayesian approach was used to assess the treatment effect on the change in ppFEV1. The study was 
considered successful if the posterior probability that the treatment difference between TEZ/IVA and 
placebo was greater than 0 was at least 80%, using a non-informative prior distribution. Assuming a 
3.0 percentage points mean treatment difference between TEZ/IVA and placebo and a SD of 6.0 
percentage points, with 45 TEZ/IVA subjects and 45 placebo subjects, the Bayesian power to achieve 
the posterior probability criterion was at least 90% (92.6%). After adjusting for an assumed dropout 
rate of 5%, a total sample size of 90 subjects was needed. 
The above assumptions were based on the results of Study VX14-661-106 (beyond that of the 
reported primary output) in which the mean within-group absolute change from baseline to 8 weeks 
for TEZ/IVA was 3.0 percentage points for subjects with a baseline ppFEV1 <40%. This subgroup best 
approximates the population that was expected to enrol in Study VX16-661-114. 
The SD of the primary endpoint in Study VX14-661-106 was ~5% based on 6 post-baseline 
observations. Given that this study averaged only 2 post-baseline observations, it was reasonable to 
expect the SD to be slightly higher, and, therefore, the SD for this study was set at 6.0%. 
Subjects were stratified by age at the Screening Visit (<18 versus ≥18 years old), sex (male versus 
female), and percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV1) severity determined 
during the Screening Visit (<40% versus ≥40% predicted), and then randomized (1:1) to 1 of the 
following 2 treatment groups: 
• Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor: TEZ/IVA 100/150 mg tablet once each morning + IVA 150 mg tablet once each 
evening 
• Placebo: placebo regimen with visually matched tablets

Regarding the sample size, the MAH choose a Bayesian ‘success’ criterion for the trial instead of a 
frequentist one. Theoretically this could have led to a smaller trial than for a more usual frequentist 
comparison. However,  if the Applicant had chosen to obtain 90% power for detecting statistical 
significance at the 0.05 level when the underlying assumptions are the same (a difference of 3 percent 
points with a standard deviation of 6 percent points), then 15 subjects per group would have been 
needed. Thus, the method did not lead to a smaller trial.  
However, the Applicant did not specify what kind of non-informative prior was used. Therefore the 
results of the Bayesian analysis will be compared to that of a frequentist one in the assessment later 
on.  
On the choice of the criterion itself, the criterion means that the 60%-credible interval of the mean is 
above 0 (assuming that the credible interval is symmetric which is considered reasonable given the 
normalizing influence of taking the average of the week 28 and 56 measurement and taking the 
change from baseline). Here the credible interval is the Bayesian counter part of the frequentist 
confidence interval. This reformulation also makes clear that the choice of this criterion is somewhat 
arbitrary, because the 60% is not justified, and there is no particular argument in favour or against 
this choice.  
Analysis Sets 
The following analysis sets were defined: All Subjects Set, Randomized Set, Full Analysis Set (FAS), 
and Safety Set. 
The All Subjects Set was defined as all subjects who had been randomized or had received at least 1 
dose of study drug. This analysis set was used in subject listings and the disposition summary table, 
unless otherwise specified. 
The Randomized Set was defined as all subjects who had been randomized. 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) was defined as all randomized subjects who carried the intended CFTR 
allele mutation and had received at least 1 dose of study drug. 
The Safety Set was defined as all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. 
Statistical Analyses 
Continuous variables were summarized using the following descriptive summary statistics: the number 
of subjects (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum value (Min), and maximum value 
(Max). 
Categorical variables were summarized using counts and percentages. 
Baseline Value, unless otherwise specified, was defined as the most recent non-missing measurement 
(scheduled or unscheduled) collected prior to or on the first dose of study drug. 
Change (absolute change) from baseline was calculated as Post-baseline value - Baseline value. 
Relative change from baseline was calculated and expressed in percentage as 100 × (Post-baseline 
value - Baseline value) / Baseline value. 
Treatment-emergent (TE) Period was defined in the following way: 
• 
For subjects who completed the Safety Follow-up Contact, the TE period included the time from 
the first dose of the study drug to the Safety Follow-up Contact.

Page 17/50 
 
 
 
 
• 
For subjects who discontinued and had an ETT Visit but no Safety Follow-up Contact, the TE 
period included the time from the first dose of the study drug until the ETT visit. 
• 
For subjects who withdrew consent, the TE period included the time from the first dose of the 
study drug until withdrawal. 
• 
For subjects who enrolled in Study VX14-661-110 (EU only) or in the EAP (US only), the TE 
period in this study (Study 114) included the time from the first dose of study drug in Study 
114 until the earlier of last study participation day OR until 28 days after the last dose of the 
study drug in Study 114. 
• 
For all other subjects, including those who did not have a Safety Follow-up Contact, the TE 
period included the time from the first dose of the study drug until the earlier of last study 
participation day OR until 28 days after the last dose of the study drug. 
Unscheduled Visits: Unscheduled visit measurements were included in the following: 
1.  Derivations of measurements at scheduled visits per specified visit windowing rules below; 
2.  Derivations of baseline/last on-treatment measurements; 
3.  Derivations of the Max/Min on-treatment values and Max/Min changes from baseline values for 
safety analyses; 
4.  Data listings where appropriate. 
Visit Windowing Rules: The windows were applied based on the rules included in Appendix 16.1.9/SAP 
Version 1.0/Section 7.1. 
Incomplete/Missing data were not be imputed, unless otherwise specified. 
Outliers: No formal statistical analyses were performed to detect or remedy the presence of statistical 
outliers, unless otherwise specified. 
Primary Safety Endpoint 
Respiratory safety of TEZ/IVA was the primary objective of this study and was assessed in terms of 
incidence, including the following respiratory adverse events of special interest (RAESIs) while subjects 
were on treatment: Chest discomfort , Dyspnea (shortness of breath), Respiration abnormal (chest 
tightness), Asthma, bronchial hyperreactivity, bronchospasm, wheezing 
Respiratory adverse events of special interest were also summarized by PT for the following treatment 
intervals: 
• 0 to 1 Week: [Day 1, Day 7] 
• >1 to 4 Weeks: [Day 8, Day 28] 
• >4 to 8 Weeks: [Day 29, Day 56] 
• >8 Weeks: [Day 57, end of TE period] 
Data Monitoring 
An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC), as defined in a separate document (IDMC  
Charter), was formed before study initiation. The IDMC conducted regular planned safety reviews of 
study data as outlined in the IDMC Charter and IDMC Analysis Plan. The first IDMC analysis was 
performed when approximately 50% of subjects completed their Day 56 visit.

Important Protocol Deviations 
Important protocol deviations (IPDs) were a subset of protocol deviations that may have significantly 
impacted the completeness, accuracy, and/or reliability of the study data or that may have significantly 
affected a subject’s rights, safety, or well-being. Important protocol deviation rules were developed 
and finalized before database lock. 
Important protocol deviations (from the clinical database or from the site deviation log) were 
summarized descriptively based on the FAS and presented by treatment. Additionally, IPDs were 
provided as a subject data listing. 
Changes in Conduct of Study 
The Study 114 protocol was amended 2 times, and there were US- and French-specific versions. The 
major changes in each protocol version are summarized below. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Ninety-eight subjects were randomized: 47 subjects in the placebo group and 51 subjects in the 
TEZ/IVA group. One subject in the TEZ/IVA group was judged not clinically stable by the principal 
investigator (PI) at the Day 1 visit and did not receive any study drug. 
Of the 97 subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug (Full Analysis Set [FAS]), 93 (95.9%) 
completed dosing. The number of subjects who prematurely discontinued study drug treatment due to 
any reason was low and similar in both treatment groups (TEZ/IVA: 2 subjects [4.0%]; placebo: 2 
subjects [4.3%]). (Table 3)

Table 3 Subject Disposition, All Subjects Set 
Rapporteurs’ comments 
Discontinuation is low (4.1%) and is comparable in both arms. In the placebo arm in total 2 patients 
discontinued treatment of which one patient discontinued because of an AE. In TEZ/IVA arm two 
patient discontinued treatment, both patients because of an AE. (for details see further in the safety 
section).  
Baseline data 
Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic parameters were similar between the TEZ/IVA and placebo groups. The majority of 
subjects were White (86.6%) and not Hispanic or Latino (83.5%); 62.9% of subjects were female. The 
overall mean age was 33.8 years (range: 15 to 59 years).

Table 4 Subject Demographics, Full Analysis Set 
Characteristics such as age, height, spirometry measures, and use of prior medications were similar 
across treatment groups at baseline. 
The highest proportion of subjects had a baseline ppFEV1 value <40 (49.5%). The mean (SD) ppFEV1 
was 44.6 (16.1) in the TEZ/IVA group and 48.0 (18.1) in the placebo group. 
Before the first dose of study drug, the majority of subjects used any bronchodilator (99.0%), dornase 
alfa (73.2%), and any inhaled antibiotic (67.0%).

Rapporteurs’ comments 
There is a small imbalance for ppFEV1. More patients in the placebo group had a ppFEV1 ≥ 70% (9 
versus 4 for placebo and TEZ/IVA respectively) and less patients have ppFEV1 < 40% (21 versus 27 
for placebo and TEZ/IVA respectively). Therefore, overall patients in the TEZ/IVA group had overall 
more severe CF.  
Furthermore, there is an imbalance in use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS); more patients in the 
placebo group used ICS (70.2% and 42% for placebo and TEZ/IVA, respectively). This could be an 
indication for concomitant asthma.  
Medical history 
The most common medical history conditions (incidence ≥15% of subjects by PT in the FAS) are 
summarized in

Rapporteurs’ comments 
More patients in the placebo group had asthma (31.9% and 16% for placebo and TEZ/IVA, 
respectively). As asthma is one of the RAESI, this imbalance can be a confounder.  Moreover, asthma 
symptoms overlap with CF symptoms; this imbalance can also be a confounder for these overlap 
symptoms.  
Prior Medications 
The most common prior medications (used by ≥ 30% of subjects in any treatment group) were 
dornase alfa (TEZ/IVA: 74.0%; placebo: 72.3%), sodium chloride (TEZ/IVA: 68.0%; placebo: 70.2%), 
pancreatin (TEZ/IVA: 60.0%; placebo: 68.1%), salbutamol (TEZ/IVA: 56.0%; placebo: 55.3%), 
azithromycin (TEZ/IVA: 54%; placebo: 51.1%), colecalciferol (TEZ/IVA: 42.0%; placebo: 42.6%), 
tobramycin (TEZ/IVA: 34.0%; placebo: 31.9%), salbutamol sulfate (TEZ/IVA: 32.0%; placebo: 
27.7%), aztreonam lysine (TEZ/IVA: 30.0%; placebo: 21.3%), ursodeoxycholic acid (TEZ/IVA: 26.0%; 
placebo: 36.2%), and fluticasone propionate; salmeterol xinafoate (TEZ/IVA: 20.0%; placebo: 
38.3%).  
Concomitant Medications 
All subjects used medication concomitantly with the study drug. The most common concomitant 
medications (used by ≥30% of subjects overall in the FAS) during the study period were for CF 
management and included dornase alfa (74.2%), sodium chloride (71.1%), pancreatin (63.9%), 
salbutamol (58.8%), azithromycin (51.5%), colecalciferol (44.3%), tobramycin (37.1%), aztreonam 
lysine (30.9%), salbutamol sulfate (30.9%), and ursodeoxycholic acid (30.9%).  
Concomitant medications used by ≥15% of subjects are summarized in Table 7.

Notes: Medications were coded using WHO-DD, Version March 2018, format B3. Preferred Names are sorted in 
descending order of frequency based on the TEZ/IVA column. A subject with multiple medications within a category 
was counted only once within that category. 
Rapporteurs’ comments 
Concomitant medications were balanced except for specific asthma medication. Asthma medication 
was higher in the placebo group in line with the imbalance of the asthma between the two treatment 
groups. 
Measurements of Treatment Compliance 
The majority of subjects in both treatment groups had ≥ 80% study drug compliance (resulting in a 
mean compliance of 99.9% in the TEZ/IVA group and 99.6% in the placebo group based on study drug 
exposure). One subject in the TEZ/IVA group and 2 subjects in the placebo group had <80% drug 
compliance.

An IPD was defined as a deviation that had the potential to affect the interpretation of study results 
(i.e., completeness, accuracy, and/or reliability of the study data) and/or to significantly affect a 
subject’s rights, safety, or well-being. 
Important protocol deviation involving inclusion/exclusion criteria 
Three (3.1%) subjects (1 in the TEZ/IVA group and 2 in the placebo group) were enrolled despite 
violation of inclusion and exclusion criteria; no safety issues were identified for these subjects: 
• One subject (TEZ/IVA group) was randomized to TEZ/IVA study drug and dosed on Day 1 before 
reporting a change in therapy, the initiation of ciprofloxacin due to recent microbiology results positive 
for Pseudomonas. The Vertex medical monitor provided permission for this subject to continue in the 
study. The subject completed the study. 
• One subject (placebo group) was on a restricted medication (CYP3A inhibitor, itraconazole) for the 
duration of the study. The subject completed the study. 
• One subject (placebo group) had a PEx after screening and prior to randomization to placebo study 
drug. The Vertex medical monitor provided permission for this subject to continue in the study. The 
subject completed the study. 
Important protocol deviation involving study drug compliance and missed or incorrect doses 
Three (3.1%) subjects (1 in the TEZ/IVA group and 2 in the placebo group) had <80% compliance 
with study drug. It is not likely that these IPDs impacted the ability to interpret the overall study 
results, given their limited number and magnitude: 
• One subject (TEZ/IVA group) had 77% study drug compliance during the Treatment Period and was 
assessed as overall noncompliant to TEZ/IVA administration  
• One subject (placebo group) had a 73.7% study drug compliance based on FDC and mono tablets 
taken  
• One subject (placebo group) had 78% study drug compliance between the Day 28 and Day 56 visits; 
subject could not recall which dates and/or doses were missed  
Two (2.1%) subjects (1 in the TEZ/IVA group and 1 in the placebo group) missed doses. The subject in 
the TEZ/IVA group returned buffer packages during the Day 15 visit and ran out of study drug 5 days 
before the Day 56 visit. In total, the subject missed 5 doses of TEZ/IVA and 7 doses of IVA although a 
total of 56 days of treatment had taken place. The subject in the placebo group returned buffer 
packages during the Day 15 visit and therefore ran out of study drug 3 days before the Day 56 visit. In 
total, the subject missed 3 doses of placebo although a total of 56 days of treatment had already taken 
place. 
One subject in the TEZ/IVA group inadvertently received an incorrect dosage kit (placebo). The subject 
took 2 doses from the incorrect kit before a new kit was provided. 
Other IPDs 
One subject in the placebo group had no spirometry completed on the Day 28 visit as the spirometry 
machine did not work. 
One subject in the TEZ/IVA group did not sign the ICF before study assessments at the rescreening 
visit. The ICF was signed on Day 1 of the Treatment Period. 
There were no safety laboratory hematology results for 1 subject in the TEZ/IVA group due to 
specimen hemolysis.

One subject in the placebo group took rescue medication (Albuterol) less than 4 hours prior to the 
spirometry tests on Days 14, 32, and 57. 
Rapporteurs’ comments 
The MAH did not define a population without major protocol deviations, as per protocol set (PPS).  
In this study, safety is the primary objective. For safety, it is important to analyse the full set and 
results of the safety set/FAS is most relevant.  
For efficacy, a PPS would be of interest for efficacy. However, efficacy is a secondary objective. 
Therefore it is considered acceptable that no efficacy analyses are performed on a PPS.   
EFFICACY RESULTS 
Rapporteurs’ comments 
Efficacy was the secondary objective. 
All efficacy analyses were based on the FAS, which included 97 subjects who were randomized and 
received at least 1 dose of study drug (50 subjects received TEZ/IVA and 47 subjects received 
placebo). 
Primary analysis: the actual Bayesian posterior probability 
The primary analysis of the key secondary efficacy variable, the actual Bayesian posterior probability 
calculated for a > 0 treatment effect difference in absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 to the 
average of the Day 28 and Day 56 measurements, was met (Table 8). The probability for a >0 
treatment effect difference in mean ppFEV1 change between TEZ/IVA and placebo was 0.9991 
(posterior mean difference: 2.7; 95% Credible Interval: 1.0, 4.4).

Rapporteurs’ comments 
From Table 9  it can be calculated (t-test on changes from baseline to average of day 28 and 56) that 
the 95%-CI is from 1.09199 to 4.50801; that the 0.99943 of the CI lies above 0. Therefore, the results 
from the Bayesian analysis are close to a frequentist analysis, which addresses the question whether 
the prior (claimed to be non-informative) is sufficiently non-informative. As this is the case, the 
analysis can be trusted upon. This is also confirmed by the Applicant’s own frequentist analysis 
(below). 
Secondary Analysis: Absolute Change in ppFEV1 From Baseline to the Average of the Day 28 and Day 
56 Measurements 
The mean treatment difference between the TEZ/IVA and placebo groups from baseline to the average 
of the Day 28 and Day 56 measurements was 2.7 percentage points (95% CI: 1.0, 4.4). The mean 
treatment difference between the TEZ/IVA and placebo groups in the absolute change from baseline in 
ppFEV1 was 2.0 percentage points (CI: 0.4, 3.6) at Day 15, 2.2 percentage points (CI: 0.3, 4.1) at 
Day 28, and 3.5 percentage points (CI: 1.8, 5.1) at Day 56. 
The within-group difference in mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline to the average of the 
Day 28 and Day 56 measurements was 2.2 percentage points (SD: 4.8) in the TEZ/IVA group and -0.6 
percentage points (SD: 3.4) in the placebo group.

Rapporteurs’ comments 
The mean treatment difference between the TEZ/IVA and placebo groups from baseline to the average 
of the Day 28 and Day 56 measurements was 2.7 percentage points (95% CI: 1.0, 4.4), being lower 
than the marketing application (MA) study VX16-661-106 in which a difference of 4.0 (3.1, 4.8) had 
been observed.  
Summary statistics of the within-group difference in mean absolute change in ppFEV1 is 2.2% for the 
TEZ/IVA group, being lower compared to the MA study while the difference in placebo was comparable 
to the decrease in ppFEV1 (-0.6%) at 24 weeks in the placebo group.

The MAH provided the absolute difference from baseline to Day 56 which allowed for a more direct 
comparison with the MA study VX16-661-106. The mean difference of 3.5 pp (95 CI: 1.8, 5.1) is more 
similar to that found in study 106 (4.0; 95% CI: 3.1; 4.8). The difference from baseline to Day 56 is 
based on 48 and 44 subjects in the TEZ/IVA and placebo groups respectively. Even though it is difficult 
to follow what has been done and how calculations have been performed (as it appears that for the 
calculation of the average at day 28 and day 56, values obtained at unscheduled visits may have been 
used), no further issues are raised in this respect. 
An MMRM analysis was requested for ppFEV1 for the absolute difference from baseline to Day 56.  No 
MMRM analysis was provided. Although the justications of the MAH can be questioned, it is considered 
that the MMRM will not mean fully give more information and can therefore be omitted. 
In this study VX16-661-114, patients with lower ppFEV1 (FEV1>25%) were allowed to participate 
compared to the MA study (FEV1>40%). However, some patients were included in study 106 with a 
ppFEV<40%. In study 106, the treatment effects are comparable among the subgroups of baseline 
ppFEV1 ≥70% (3.7 [95% CI, 2.2, 5.2]), ≥40% to <70% (4.2 [95% CI, 3.1, 5.2]), and <40% (3.5 
[95% CI, 1.0, 6.1]).  
Overall, we consider that the effects seen in study 114 might be numerically lower, but these 
differences cannot be considered statistically significant or clinically relevant. 
Secondary Analysis: Relative change in ppFEV1  
The mean treatment difference between the TEZ/IVA and placebo groups from baseline to the average 
of the Day 28 and Day 56 measurements was 6.7% (95% CI: 2.5, 10.9). The mean treatment 
difference between the TEZ/IVA and placebo groups in the relative change from baseline in ppFEV1 
was 4.9% (CI: 1.2, 8.6) at Day 15, 5.7% (CI: 1.0, 10.4) at Day 28 and 8.3% (CI: 4.4, 12.2) at Day 
56. 
Rapporteurs’ comments 
The difference between the two groups in relative change in ppFEV1 was 6.7% confirming the 
treatment favour of TEZ/IVA. 
Secondary Analysis: Absolute Change in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain Score From Baseline to the 
Average of the Day 28 and Day 56 Measurements 
The CFQ-R is a validated instrument; the respiratory domain assesses subject reported changes in 
respiratory-related quality of life. The pooled CFQ-R “Children Ages 12 and 13” Version and 
“Adolescents and Adults” Version were used for the analysis. 
The absolute change in CFQ-R respiratory domain score between the TEZ/IVA and placebo groups from 
baseline to the average of the Day 28 and Day 56 measurements was 1.1 points (95% CI: -4.9, 7.0). 
The within group difference from baseline to the average of the Day 28 and Day 56 measurements was 
5.7 points (SD: 14.2) for the TEZ/IVA group and 4.7 points (SD: 15.4) for the placebo group. 
Summary statistics for the analysis of the change from baseline in the respiratory domain of the CFQ-R 
are shown in Table 10.

Rapporteurs’ comments 
The mean difference is 1.1 points in CFQ-R after 8 weeks compared to the MA study 5.1, however, this 
difference was observed after 24 weeks.  
SAFETY RESULTS 
Rapporteurs’ comments 
Safety was the primary objective of the study. 
Extent of Exposure 
Ninety-seven subjects received at least 1 dose of study drug during the TE Period. The mean exposure 
was 7.7 weeks in the TEZ/IVA group and 7.9 weeks in the placebo group. The majority of subjects 
received >4 weeks and ≤8 weeks of treatment (60.0% subjects in the TEZ/IVA group and 53.2% 
subjects in the placebo group). Table 11 provides summary statistics for study drug exposure.

Rapporteurs’ comments 
A total of 40 patients had an exposure duration of > 8 weeks. According to the design the treatment 
Period (Day 1 through Day 56) is 8 weeks. Patients that had an exposure duration > 8 weeks, did pass 
this 8 week treatment duration due to a plus or minus 5-day window for the Day 56 Visit  
Primary Safety Endpoint 
Respiratory Adverse Events of Special Interest 
The RAESIs are a group of 7 PTs pre-defined to explore select AEs within the respiratory system. The 
RAESIs were defined as AEs with any of the following PTs: 
• Asthma 
• Bronchial hyperreactivity 
• Bronchospasm 
• Wheezing 
• Chest discomfort 
• Dyspnea 
• Respiration abnormal 
Seventeen (17.5%) subjects had at least 1 RAESI: 7 (14.0%) subjects in the TEZ/IVA group and 10 
(21.3%) subjects in the placebo group. In most subjects who had RAESIs, in both treatment groups, 
the events were considered either mild or moderate in severity; no severe or life-threatening RAESIs 
occurred. No subjects interrupted or discontinued treatment due to an RAESI, and there were no 
RAESIs that were considered serious or led to death.

regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended  
EMA/CHMP/401041/2019

The most common RAESI (incidence ≥10% of subjects in any treatment group) was dyspnea 
(TEZ/IVA: 5 [10.0%] subjects; placebo: 5 [10.6%] subjects). 
Most RAESIs were considered unlikely related or not related to study drug. Five subjects (5.2%) had 
RAESIs which were considered possibly related (1 in TEZ/IVA; 4 in placebo). No RAESIs were 
considered related to study drug. 
The greatest incidence of RAESIs were during >0 to ≤1 week (TEZ/IVA: 6.0%; placebo: 10.6%) and 
>1 to ≤4 weeks (TEZ/IVA: 4.0%; placebo: 12.8%).

Rapporteurs’ comments 
A total of 17 patients (17.5%) had a respiratory adverse event of specific interest. The number of 
patients is low, and it will be difficult to draw a robust conclusion. Overall, more patients in the placebo 
group experienced a RAESI. However, more patients in the placebo group were diagnosed with 
asthma. Asthma symptoms overlap with CF symptoms. An imbalance in asthma can act as a 
confounder for these overlap symptoms. Therefore, the most equal distribution of the events could 
have been confounded by this imbalance in asthma. However, for most of the RAES none of the 
patients in the TEZ/IVA had an event. Only respiration abnormal was experience more frequently in 
the TEZ/IVA group. The most common RAESI dyspnoea was balanced (TEZ/IVA: 5 [10.0%] subjects; 
placebo: 5 [10.6%] subjects). However, dyspnoea is symptom in CF as well as in asthma.  
Most RAESIs were considered unlikely related or not related to study drug with no significant 
differences between the two groups. 
Most events started within the first 4 weeks.  
In conclusion, on face value the observed RAESIs do not lead to a specific pattern or signal in the 
group treated with TEZ/IVA, although it should be emphasized that the interpretation of the safety 
data is based on the limited number of patients and any statistical substantiation is lacking. 
Adverse events 
Seventy-six (78.4%) subjects had at least 1 AE, including 37 (74.0%) subjects in the TEZ/IVA group 
and 39 (83.0%) subjects in the placebo group. 
The majority of subjects had AEs that were considered either mild (37.1%) or moderate (35.1%) in 
severity; 5.2% of subjects had severe AEs. One life-threatening AE occurred in the TEZ/IVA group. 
Fourteen (14.4%) subjects had an SAE, including 5 (10.0%) subjects in the TEZ/IVA group and 9 
(19.1%) subjects in the placebo group. No SAEs were considered related to study drug in the TEZ/IVA 
group, and only 1 (2.1%) was considered related in the placebo group. There was 1 AE that led to 
death in the TEZ/IVA group.

Adverse events that led to treatment discontinuation occurred in 2 (4.0%) subjects in the TEZ/IVA 
group (1 subject had malaise, and 1 subject had  sepsis) and 1 (2.1%) subject in the placebo group 
(pleuritic pain). Adverse events that led to treatment interruption occurred in 1 (2.0%) subject in the 
TEZ/IVA group (gastrointestinal) and 1 (2.1%) subject in the placebo group. 
The majority of subjects had AEs that were considered not related or unlikely related. Twenty-six 
(26.8%) subjects had at least 1 AE considered possibly related or related to study drug, including 10 
(20.0%) subjects in the TEZ/IVA group and 16 (34.0%) subjects in the placebo group. Table 13 
summarizes the percentage of subjects with AEs. 
Table 13 Overview of Adverse Events, Safety Set 
Rapporteurs’ comments 
Overall, the frequency of AEs, SAE, and TEAE were comparable between the placebo and TEZ/IVA 
groups. Moreover, compared to the initial MA studies, the pattern of AEs appeared to be similar. No 
new safety signal for TEZ/IVA became apparent.  
Analysis of Common Adverse Events 
The most common AEs by PT (incidence ≥10% of subjects overall) were infective PEx of CF (20.6%), 
cough (17.5%), headache (13.4%), and dyspnoea (10.3%). 
Adverse events that occurred in ≥ 5% of subjects by PT in any treatment group were more common in 
the placebo group than in the TEZ/IVA group except the following: nasopharyngitis (TEZ/IVA: 12.0%

The majority of subjects had AEs that were considered mild (37.1%) or moderate (35.1%) in severity. 
The 1 subject who had a life-threatening AE was in the TEZ/IVA group. This event was also an SAE.  
Table 15 Incidence and Severity of Adverse Events, Safety Set 
Table 16 summarizes all Grade 3/4 (i.e., severe and life-threatening) AEs. No Grade 3/4 AE by PT 
occurred in more than 1 subject in either treatment group.

Rapporteurs’ comments 
One patient experienced a life-threatening AE. This patient was treated with TEZ/IVA. However, 
numbers of patients and events are low. Moreover, the event was considered unrelated to the 
medication.  Therefore, no conclusions can be drawn based on these numbers.  
Relationship of Adverse Events 
The majority of AEs were considered not related or unlikely related to study drug. Twenty-six (26.8%) 
subjects had AEs considered possibly related or related to study drug; including 10 (20.0%) subjects in 
the TEZ/IVA group and 16 (34.0%) subjects in the placebo group.

Table 17 Incidence and Relationship to Study Drug of Adverse Events, Safety Set 
Overall, the most common related and/or possibly related AEs (incidence ≥2 subjects total) were 
abdominal pain upper (5 subjects), cough (5 subjects), headache (3 subjects), diarrhoea (2 subjects), 
nausea (2 subjects), increased viscosity of bronchial secretion (2 subjects), and dyspnoea (2 subjects). 
The incidence of these AEs was generally similar between treatment groups. 
The AEs related to treatment that were more frequently present in TEZ/IVA group were: 
−  abdominal pain upper 4 (8.0) versus 1 (2.1) 
−  Constipation 1 (2.0) versus 0  
−  Distal intestinal obstruction syndrome 1 (2.0) versus 0  
− 
Flatulence 1 (2.0) versus 0 
−  Respiration abnormal 1 (2.0) versus 0  
−  Headache 2 (4.0) versus 1 (2.1)  
−  Pyrexia 1 (2.0) versus 0 
Rapporteurs’ comments 
Overall, there were more treatment related AEs in the TEZ/IVA group compared to the placebo group. 
These concerned possibly related AE (15(31.9%) versus 10 (20%)). These could be mainly found in 
the SOC Gastrointestinal disorders. Overall, these types of adverse events were already detected in the 
MA studies. 
Adverse Events Associated With Elevated Transaminases 
No subjects in the TEZ/IVA group and 1 (2.1%) subject in the placebo group had at least 1 AE 
associated with elevated transaminases. The events were mild in severity and did not lead to 
treatment discontinuation, treatment interruption, or death. 
Deaths 
There was 1 death in the study. One subject, who received TEZ 100 mg/IVA 150 mg, died as a result 
of life-threatening SAEs on Day 46 of the study, following influenza viral infection. The subject received 
study drug from Days 1 to Day 29 and discontinued from study drug. The SAEs with a fatal outcome

were assessed by the investigator as not related to study drug. A narrative for this event was 
provided. 
Rapporteurs’ comments 
One patient experienced a life-threatening AE resulting in the death of this patient. This patient was 
treated with TEZ/IVA. The investigator considered the AEs and death to be unrelated to study drug.  
This is accepted as this death seems to be cause by an influenza viral infection 
Other Serious Adverse Events 
The percentage of subjects who had at least 1 SAE was lower in the TEZ/IVA group (5 subjects, 
10.0%) than in the placebo group (9 subjects, 19.1%). By PT, the most common SAE overall was 
infective PEx of CF, which occurred in 3 (6.0%) subjects in the TEZ/IVA group and 7 (14.9%) subjects 
in the placebo group. All other SAEs occurred in 1 subject in 1 of the treatment groups by PT. The 
majority of SAEs had an outcome of recovered/resolved. 
Only 1 subject had an SAE (pleuritic pain) that was considered by the investigator to be related or 
possibly related to study drug (in the placebo group), which resolved with.

disorders. Overall, numbers of patients and events are low.  Therefore, no conclusions can be drawn 
based on these numbers.  
Adverse Events That Led to Discontinuation of Study Drug or That Led to Interruption of Study Drug  
Three (3.1%) subjects had AEs that led to treatment discontinuation: 2 (4.0%) subjects in the 
TEZ/IVA group (Malaise, Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome/ Sepsis) and 1 (2.1%) subject in the 
placebo group (Pleuritic pain). All AEs that led to treatment discontinuation occurred in 1 subject each. 
None of the AEs that led to treatment discontinuation were RAESIs. 
Two (2.1%) subjects had AEs that led to treatment interruption: 1 (2.0%) subject in the TEZ/IVA 
group (GI symptoms) and 1 (2.1%) subject in the placebo group. 
Rapporteurs’ comments 
Overall, the frequency of AEs that led to treatment discontinuation/treatment interruption was 
comparable between the placebo and TEZ/IVA groups. Due to low number, no specific conclusions can 
be drawn. 
Liver Function Test 
The mean values for LFT parameters were generally within normal ranges in both treatment groups at 
all visits during the TE Period. No clinically meaningful trends were observed. 
No subjects in either the placebo or TEZ/IVA groups had AST or ALT elevations >3 × ULN in 
association with bilirubin >2 × ULN. 
Adverse events associated with elevated transaminases were assessed as mild in severity and did not 
lead to treatment interruption, treatment discontinuation, or death. 
Rapporteurs’ comments 
There were no important finding in liver functions tests.  
Other Serum Chemistry 
For other clinical chemistry parameters no clinically meaningful trends were observed.  
Overall, no clinically meaningful trends attributable to TEZ/IVA were observed. All AEs related to other 
chemistry findings occurred at an incidence of 1 (1.0%) subject in either treatment group, including 1 
subject in the TEZ/IVA group with blood creatine phosphokinase increased; 1 subject in the placebo 
group with blood glucose increased, 1 subject in the placebo group with blood bilirubin increased; and 
1 subject in the placebo group with blood Liver parameters increased. 
All AEs related to other chemistry findings were mild and did not lead to treatment interruption or 
discontinuation. Two of the AEs related to other chemistry findings in the placebo group (liver 
parameters increased) were considered possibly related to study drug and were ongoing at the end of 
the study. 
Haematology 
No clinically meaningful trends in mean haematology parameter values and changes from baseline 
were observed. No clinically meaningful trends attributable to treatment with TEZ/IVA were observed. 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted in accordance with article 46 of 
regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended

One AE related to haematology findings, reticulocyte count increased, occurred in 1 (2.1%) subject in 
the placebo group. The AE was considered mild, unlikely related to study group, and did not lead to 
treatment interruption or discontinuation. 
Coagulation 
No clinically meaningful trends in mean coagulation parameter values and changes from baseline were 
observed. 
All AEs related to coagulation occurred at an incidence of 1 (1.0%) subject, and all occurred in subjects 
in the placebo group. Two AEs occurred concurrently in 1 (2.1%) subject in the placebo group and 
included coagulation parameters. One additional AE related to coagulation, activated partial 
thromboplastin time prolonged, occurred in 1 subject in the placebo group. The AEs were all 
considered mild and did not lead to treatment interruption or discontinuation. Two of the AEs on 
coagulation parameters were considered possibly related to study drug. 
Urinalysis 
All AEs related to urinalysis occurred at an incidence of 1 (1.0%) subject in either treatment group, 
including 1 subject in the placebo group with urine calcium increased (considered not related to study 
drug) and 1 subject in the placebo group with crystal urine present (considered unlikely related to 
study drug). Both AEs were not serious and did not lead to changes in treatment. 
Vital Signs 
Overall, there were no major differences in vital signs between treatment groups, and no clinically 
meaningful trends were observed over time. Overall, there were no clinically meaningful trends 
attributable to treatment with TEZ/IVA, with the percentage of subjects meeting any given criterion 
being generally similar across treatment groups. 
Adverse events related to vital signs findings included hypotension in 1 (2.0%) subject in the TEZ/IVA 
group; blood pressure decreased, pericardial effusion, and tachycardia in 1 (2.1%) subject each in the 
placebo group. One event, pericardial effusion, was considered an SAE. Among these events, none led 
to treatment interruption or discontinuation. One AE, blood pressure decreased in the placebo group, 
was considered by the investigator to be possibly related to study drug. 
Rapporteurs’ comments 
There were no important findings in chemistry, haematology coagulation, urinalysis and vital signs.  
Pulse Oximetry 
Mean pulse oximetry results and changes from baseline were similar across treatment groups and 
showed no clinically meaningful trends over time. 
No clinically meaningful trends attributable to treatment with TEZ/IVA were observed in the shift 
analysis of pulse oximetry results. Of the 57 subjects who had a normal (oxygen saturation >95%) or 
missing baseline oxygenation value, 21 subjects had a shift to low (oxygen saturation ≤ 95%) during 
the TE Period: 9/50 (18.0%) subjects in the TEZ/IVA group and 12/47 (25.5%) subjects in the placebo 
group. 
There were no AEs related to pulse oximetry findings.

The mean absolute changes in ppFEV1 from pre-dose to post-dose on Day 1 were -0.6 percentage 
points in the TEZ/IVA group at 2 hours post-dose and 0.3 percentage points in the placebo group; -0.8 
percentage points in the TEZ/IVA group at 4 hours post-dose and 0 percentage points in the placebo 
group. Threshold analysis of ppFEV1 from pre-dose to post-dose revealed that no subjects in either 
treatment group had a post-dose decline ≥ 10 percentage points 2 hours post-dose. One subject in the 
TEZ/IVA group had a post-dose decline of ≥10 percentage points 4 hours post-dose. 
One subject, a, had a ppFEV1 decline of 21.3 percentage points at 4 hours post-dose on Day 1. Other 
spirometric parameters showed a drop in FVC, an increased FEV1/FVC ratio, and a flow-volume loop 
consistent with a poor inspiratory effort. On the same day, the subject had a mild AE of respiratory 
chest tightness (PT: respiration abnormal), which had resolved by Day 6 without having required 
treatment. No other complaints or AEs were reported. The subject completed the study with a positive 
response (ppFEV1, CFQ-R) to study drug (TEZ/IVA).

Rapporteurs’ comments 
The mean absolute changes in ppFEV1 from pre-dose to post-dose on Day 1 were -0.6 percentage 
points in the TEZ/IVA group at 2 hours post-dose and 0.3 percentage points in the placebo group and 
at 4 hours post-dose -0.8 percentage points in the TEZ/IVA group at 4 hours post-dose and 0 
percentage points in the placebo group. These differences are not clinically relevant.  
There was 1 patient with a post-dose decrease of ppFEV1 of >20%. It is agreed with the Company that 
this is probably because of a poor effort. On top of this patient, 3 patients had a decrease between 5-
10% in ppFEV1 in TEZ/IVA group and 1 patient in placebo group.  
In conclusion, post dose decrease in ppFEV1 was minimal.    
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
This study was a Phase 3b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter 
study in CF subjects 12 years of age and older who are homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation 
who discontinued treatment with Orkambi due to respiratory symptoms considered related to 
treatment. The study was designed to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of TEZ/IVA. Efficacy 
was evaluated as a secondary objective. The treatment period was 56 days.  
Study population  
Of the 97 subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug (Full Analysis Set [FAS]), 93 (95.9%) 
completed dosing. All efficacy analyses were based on the FAS: 50 subjects received TEZ/IVA and 47 
subjects received placebo). Only one adolescent was included, who was randomised to placebo. The 
number of subjects who prematurely discontinued study drug treatment due to any reason was low in 
both treatment groups (TEZ/IVA: 2 [4.0%] subjects; placebo: 2 [4.3%] subjects). 
Overall the population was balanced for most demographics and characteristics, prior and concomitant 
medication. There was a small imbalance for ppFEV1 resulting that patients in the TEZ/IVA group had 
overall more severe CF. Furthermore, more patients in the placebo group had asthma (31.9% and 
16% for placebo and TEZ/IVA, respectively). As asthma is one of the RAESI, this imbalance can be a 
confounder. Moreover, asthma symptoms overlap with CF symptoms; this imbalance can also be a 
confounder for these overlap symptoms.  
The sample size calculation was based, on the Bayesian ‘success’ criterion approach, targeting an 
efficacy parameter. 
Efficacy 
The primary analysis of the key secondary efficacy variable, the actual Bayesian posterior probability 
calculated for a >0 treatment effect difference in absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 to the 
average of the Day 28 and Day 56 measurements, was met. The probability for a >0 treatment effect 
difference in mean ppFEV1 change between TEZ/IVA and placebo was 0.9991 (posterior mean 
difference: 2.7; 95% Credible Interval: (1.0, 4.4) in line with the frequentist analysis).  
The mean treatment difference between the TEZ/IVA and placebo groups from baseline to the average 
of the Day 28 and Day 56 measurements was 2.7 percentage points (95% CI: 1.0, 4.4), which was  
lower than in the marketing application (MA) study VX16-661-106 (difference of 4.0 (3.1, 4.8).  
Summary statistics of the within-group difference in mean absolute change in ppFEV1 is 2.2% for the 
TEZ/IVA group, being lower compared to the MA study while the difference in placebo was comparable 
to the decrease in ppFEV1 (-0.6%) at 24 weeks in the placebo group. In this study VX16-661-114,

patients with lower ppFEV1 (FEV1>25%) were allowed to participate compared to the MA study 
(FEV1>40%).However, some patients were included in study 106 with a ppFEV<40%.  In study 106, 
the treatment effects are comparable among the subgroups of baseline ppFEV1 ≥70% (3.7 [95% CI, 
2.2, 5.2]), ≥40% to <70% (4.2 [95% CI, 3.1, 5.2]), and <40% (3.5 [95% CI, 1.0, 6.1]). Overall, we 
consider that the effects seen in study 114 might be numerically lower, but these differences cannot be 
considered statistically significant or clinically relevant. 
The mean treatment difference between the TEZ/IVA and placebo groups in absolute change from 
baseline in CFQ-R respiratory domain score to the average of Day 28 and Day 56 was 1.1 points (95% 
CI: -4.9, 7.0). 
As only one adolescent was included, who was randomised to placebo, results on the paediatric 
population are not available.    
Safety  
Ninety-seven subjects received at least 1 dose of study drug during the TE Period. The mean exposure 
was 7.7 weeks in the TEZ/IVA group and 7.9 weeks in the placebo group. A total of 40 patients had an 
exposure duration of > 8 weeks. According to the design the treatment Period (Day 1 through Day 56) 
is 8 weeks. Patients that had an exposure duration > 8 weeks, did pass this 8 week treatment duration 
due to a plus or minus 5-day window for the Day 56 Visit. 
The primary safety endpoint was incidence of RAESI. RAESI were: asthma, bronchial hyperreactivity, 
bronchospasm, wheezing, chest discomfort, dyspnoea, respiration abnormal.  
Seventeen (17.5%) subjects had at least 1 RAESI: 7 (14.0%) subjects in the TEZ/IVA group and 10 
(21.3%) subjects in the placebo group. All RAESIs were mild or moderate in severity and there were 
no severe or life-threatening RAESIs. No RAESIs were serious or led to treatment discontinuation in 
either treatment group. The most common RAESI by PT (incidence ≥10% subjects in any treatment 
group) was dyspnoea, with similar incidence between the 2 treatment groups. However, more patients 
in the placebo group were diagnosed with asthma. Asthma symptoms overlap with CF symptoms. 
Therefore, the most equal distribution of the events could have been confounded by this imbalance in 
asthma. However, for most of the RAES none of the patients in the TEZ/IVA had an event. Only 
respiration abnormal was experience more frequently in the TEZ/IVA group (3 patients). The most 
common RAESI dyspnoea was balanced (TEZ/IVA: 5 [10.0%] subjects; placebo: 5 [10.6%] subjects). 
However, no conclusion can be drawn because dyspnoea is symptom in CF as well as in asthma. 
Moreover, the number of patients is low.  
Most RAESIs were considered unlikely related or not related to study drug. Five subjects (5.2%) had 
RAESIs which were considered possibly related (1 in TEZ/IVA; 4 in placebo). No RAESIs were 
considered related to study drug. However, the sample size calculation was based on the efficacy and 
endpoint and not to detect differences in the RAESIs. Therefore it is questionable whether differences 
could be detected. Overall, more patients in the placebo group experienced a RAESI. More patients in 
the placebo group were diagnosed with asthma. Asthma symptoms overlap with CF symptoms; this 
imbalance can also be a confounder for these overlap symptoms. The most equal distribution of the 
events could have been confounded by this imbalance in asthma. However, for most of the RAES none 
of the patients in the TEZ/IVA had an event. Only respiration abnormal was experience more 
frequently in the TEZ/IVA group. The most common RAESI dyspnoea was balanced (TEZ/IVA: 5 
[10.0%] subjects; placebo: 5 [10.6%] subjects). However, dyspnoea is symptom in CF as well as in 
asthma.  
Most RAESIs were considered unlikely related or not related to study drug with no significant 
differences between the two groups.

Seventy-six (78.4%) subjects had at least 1 AE, with 37 (74.0%) subjects in the TEZ/IVA group and 
39 (83.0%) subjects in the placebo group. The majority of subjects had AEs that were considered 
either mild (37.1%) or moderate (35.1%) in severity. One subject in the TEZ/IVA group had life-
threatening AEs concerning sepsis  that led to death. The events with a fatal outcome were considered 
by the investigator to not be related to TEZ/IVA. The majority of subjects had AEs that were 
considered not related or unlikely related to study drugs. Twenty-six (26.8%) subjects had AEs that 
were considered possibly related or related to study drugs, including 10 (20.0%) subjects in the 
TEZ/IVA group, and 16 (34.0%) in the placebo group. 
Consistent with expected CF clinical manifestations, the most common AEs by PT (incidence ≥10% of 
subjects overall) were infective PEx of CF (20.6%), cough (17.5%), headache (13.4%), dyspnoea 
(10.3%). 
Fourteen (14.4%) subjects had at least 1 SAE. The number of subjects with at least 1 SAE was 5 
(10.0%) subjects in the TEZ/IVA group and 9 (19.1%) subjects in the placebo group. No SAEs were 
considered related to study drug in the TEZ/IVA group, and only 1 SAE was considered possibly related 
in the placebo group (2.1%). 
No clinically meaningful trend was identified for LFT results.  
The mean absolute changes in ppFEV1 from pre-dose to post-dose on Day 1 were -0.6 percentage 
points in the TEZ/IVA group and 0.3 percentage points in the placebo group at 2 hours post-dose and -
0.8 percentage points in the TEZ/IVA group and 0 percentage points in the placebo group at 4 hours 
post-dose. No subject in either treatment group had a post-dose decline ≥10 percentage points 2 
hours post-dose. One subject in the TEZ/IVA group had a post-dose decline ≥20 percentage points 4 
hours post-dose most likely related to a poor effort.  
Overall, TEZ/IVA was generally safe and well tolerated for up to 56 days of treatment in patients who 
discontinued Orkambi due to treatment-related respiratory symptoms. No new safety concerns were 
identified. In conclusion, based on the limited number of patients, the observed RAESIs do not lead to 
a specific pattern or a safety signal. No conclusion can be drawn because the number of patients is 
low, and the groups are not equally balanced for an important concomitant disease asthma.  
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The primary safety endpoint was the incidence of RAESIs while subjects were on treatment. In this 
small study tezacaftor/ivacaftor did not result numerically in an increased rate of RAESIs compared to 
placebo in subjects who discontinued Orkambi due to treatment-related respiratory symptoms. Overall, 
a slightly higher number of patients in the placebo group experienced a RAESI. Most events started 
within the first 4 weeks. For most of the RAES none of the patients in the TEZ/IVA had an event. Only 
respiration abnormal was experience more frequently in the TEZ/IVA group. However, more patients in 
the placebo group were diagnosed with asthma. As asthma symptoms overlap with CF symptoms, the 
more or less similar distribution in events could have been confounded by this imbalance in asthma. 
Dyspnoea is symptom in CF as well as in asthma. Descriptively, the most common RAESI dyspnoea 
was balanced (TEZ/IVA: 5 [10.0%] subjects; placebo: 5 [10.6%] subjects).  The AEs were mostly 
expected manifestations of CF disease; no new safety concerns were identified. The incidence of 
treatment discontinuation due to AEs was low and similar in both treatment group. 
In conclusion, on face value the observed RAESIs do not lead to a specific pattern or signal in the 
group treated with TEZ/IVA, although no confirmatory conclusion could be drawn. The interpretation of 
the safety data is based on the limited number of patients, imbalances in asthma were observed in

favour of the TEZ/IVA group and any statistical pre-assumption/substantiation of the safety objective 
is lacking. 
For the key secondary efficacy endpoint of absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 to the average of 
Day 28 and Day 56, the mean treatment difference for TEZ/IVA compared to placebo was 2.7 
percentage points (95% CI: 1.0, 4.4). 
For the secondary efficacy endpoint of absolute change from baseline in CFQ-R respiratory domain 
score to the average of Day 28 and Day 56, the mean treatment difference for TEZ/IVA compared to 
placebo was 1.1 points (95% CI: -4.9, 7.0).  
As only one adolescent was included, and who was randomised to placebo, results on the paediatric 
population are not available.  
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required. 
4.  Additional clarification requested 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this 
procedure: 
1.  The sample size calculation was based, following a Bayesian ‘success’ criterion approach, on an 
efficacy parameter. It is therefore questioned whether the sample size was large enough to 
detect any clinically relevant differences in the RAESIs, the predefined primary objective of this 
study. The MAH is requested to discuss.  
2.  Summary statistics are provided for the absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline to the 
average of the Day 28 and Day 56 values. The MAH is requested to provide the absolute 
change from baseline to Day 56 for comparative purposes. In addition, a MMRM analysis of the 
absolute change from baseline though Day 56 in pppFEV1 vs. the placebo group and the 
corresponding treatment difference together with a discussion of the results is requested.    
3.  The mean treatment difference between the TEZ/IVA and placebo groups from baseline to the 
average of the Day 28 and Day 56 measurements was 2.7 percentage points (95% CI: 1.0, 
4.4), which was lower than in the marketing application (MA) study VX16-661-106 (difference 
of 4.0 (3.1, 4.8) and also lower than in subjects enrolled in study 106 with ppFEV1 below 40 
pp. In the current study VX16-661-114, patients FEV1 < 40% were allowed to participate. In 
total, 48 (49.5%) of the patients had ppFEV1 < 40%.  The MAH is requested to provide a 
subanalysis comparing patients with FEV1 ≥ 40% and patients with FEV1 < 40%. In addition, 
a discussion is requested for the comparison of the results with the results of study 106.  
4.  Ninety-seven subjects received at least 1 dose of study drug during the TE Period. A total of 40 
patients had an exposure duration of > 8 weeks. According to the design the treatment Period 
(Day 1 through Day 56) is 8 weeks. It is not understood how/why these patients had an 
exposure duration > 8 weeks. The Company is requested for an explanation.

MAH responses to Request for supplementary information 
Question 1:  
The sample size calculation was based, following a Bayesian ‘success’ criterion approach, on 
an efficacy parameter. It is therefore questioned whether the sample size was large enough 
to detect any clinically relevant differences in the RAESIs, the predefined primary objective 
of this study. The MAH is requested to discuss.  
Response MAH: 
The primary objective of Study 114 was to evaluate the respiratory safety of tezacaftor/ivacaftor 
(TEZ/IVA) in subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF) homozygous for F508del and who discontinued 
treatment with Orkambi due to respiratory symptoms considered related to Orkambi. Study 114 was 
not designed to detect a statistically significant difference in the incidence of respiratory adverse 
events of special interest (RAESI) between the TEZ/IVA and placebo groups. However, the sample size 
was considered large enough to identify any association in RAESIs and treatment (TEZ/IVA or 
placebo). In addition, as typical for interpretation of safety data, the assessment and conclusions are 
based on the totality of the data. 
In Study 114, the incidence of RAESIs in the TEZ/IVA group (14.0%) was comparable to that in the 
placebo group (21.3%). In addition, the incidence of RAESIs in the TEZ/IVA group from Study 114 
(14.0%) was comparable to that observed in the TEZ/IVA group from Study 106, a larger pivotal 
Phase 3 study: 13.1% in the TEZ/IVA group (n = 251) compared to 15.9% in the placebo group (n = 
258). These data demonstrate that TEZ/IVA is not associated with an increased risk of RAESIs. 
Moreover, in contrast to respiratory events associated with Orkambi, there were no RAESIs in Study 
114 that were serious adverse events (SAEs) or that led to interruption or discontinuation of TEZ/IVA. 
Assessment 
It is acknowledged that the safety and identification of any association in RAESIs and treatment is 
typically assessed on the totality of data. However, the MAH did NOT provide arguments for their 
statement that “the sample size was considered large enough to identify any association in RAESIs and 
treatment (TEZ/IVA or placebo)”. It can be said that with 47-50 patients events with a prevalence of 
3% of more can be detected (i.e. if the true prevalence of an RAESI is >3% then there is 78% chance 
that one would see it in at least 1 patient. However, even taking this into account,  it can still be 
questioned whether the sample size of study 114 is large enough to detect a clinically relevant 
difference in this trial, Although the incidence of RAESIs is indeed considered numerically comparable 
to the larger 106 study. , the current study 114 is not specifically powered with clinically acceptable 
pre-specified safety margins. Therefore, we consider that no robust conclusion can be drawn from 
study 114 on this matter  Issue unresolved, but not further pursued. 
Question 2  
Summary statistics are provided for the absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline to the 
average of the Day 28 and Day 56 values. The MAH is requested to provide the absolute 
change from baseline to Day 56 for comparative purposes. In addition, a MMRM analysis of 
the absolute change from baseline though Day 56 in pppFEV1 vs. the placebo group and the 
corresponding treatment difference together with a discussion of the results is requested. 
Response MAH: 
As requested, the absolute change in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV1) 
from baseline to Day 56 in Study 114 is provided in Table 1. The results are consistent with the pre-
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted in accordance with article 46 of 
regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended  
EMA/CHMP/401041/2019

specified analysis of the absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline to the average of Day 28 and Day 56 
(Table 1). 
In Study 114, the pre-specified analysis for ppFEV1 in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) was 
descriptive summary statistics along with 95% CI. Because of the low dropout rate (2 subjects in the 
TEZ/IVA group and 2 subjects in the placebo group) in this study, the results from an MMRM analysis, 
i.e., the estimated treatment difference and its 95% CI, will be similar to the results shown in Table 1. 
Therefore, a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) analysis of the absolute change from 
baseline through Day 56 in ppFEV1 was not performed. 
Assessment 
Regarding the change from baseline to Day 56 in ppFEV1, the mean difference of 3.5 pp (95 CI: 1.8, 
5.1) is more similar to that found in study 106 (4.0; 95% CI: 3.1; 4.8). The difference from baseline to 
Day 56 is based on 48 and 44 subjects in the TEZ/IVA and placebo groups respectively. What the 
Applicant does not provide in their answer is the study ID of subjects for whom ppFEV1 values were 
not available and at which visits data were lacking. A simple comparison of the number of subjects 
available for each of the analyses above shows that at day 56, ppFEV1 was not available for 2 subjects 
in the TEZ/IVA group while apparently values for these subjects were available at day 28. Similarly, for 
the placebo group at day 56 data were not available for 2 subjects while apparently these data were 
available at day 28. A subject in the placebo group is not counted in any of the analyses as the subject 
prematurely discontinued the study. Even though it is difficult to follow what has been done and how 
calculations have been performed (as it appears that for the calculation of the average at day 28 and 
day 56, values obtained at unscheduled visits may have been used), no further issues are raised in this 
respect.  
The MMRM analysis has not been performed and this is justified because the dropout rate is low (2 
subjects in each group). While this may be acceptable what would have been useful (as previously 
said) is that the Applicant had identified the subjects for whom data are not available and the exact 
visits when data on ppFEV1 are missing. Furthermore, even in the context of no missing data, the 
MMRM analysis would use not only the baseline and day 56 data, but also the measurements at day 15 
and 28. In particular the correlation between the repeated measurements would increase precision and 
therefore lead to a more precise estimate (smaller 95%-CI) of the difference. Therefore, the MAH’s 
argument of low drop-out seems irrelevant. What can be argued, however, is that the difference 
between both arms has already a 95%-CI above 0. Thus, the MMRM analysis will only make the 95%-

CI smaller and despite it may change the point estimate (center of the 95%-CI) and thus the location 
somewhat, it is likely that the 95%-CI will still be above 0. Therefore, it is considered that the MMRM 
will not mean fully give more information and can therefore be omitted. 
No further questions are raised on any of the issues above as the regulatory impact is expected to be 
low with no changes requested for the SmPC based on study 114 which is primarily a safety study 
although (Bayesian) sample size estimation uses an efficacy variable (please refer to Question 1). 
Question 3 
The mean treatment difference between the TEZ/IVA and placebo groups from baseline to the average 
of the Day 28 and Day 56 measurements was 2.7 percentage points (95% CI: 1.0, 4.4), which was 
lower than in the marketing application (MA) study VX16-661-106 (difference of 4.0 (3.1, 4.8) and 
also lower than in subjects enrolled in study 106 with ppFEV1 below 40 pp. In the current study VX16-
661-114, patients FEV1 < 40% were allowed to participate. In total, 48 (49.5%) of the patients had 
ppFEV1 < 40%.  The MAH is requested to provide a subanalysis comparing patients with FEV1 ≥ 40% 
and patients with FEV1 < 40%. In addition, a discussion is requested for the comparison of the results 
with the results of study 106. 
Response MAH: 
Vertex acknowledges that the observed treatment effect of 2.7 in Study 114 is numerically lower than 
that observed in the pivotal Phase 3 Study 106, which is 4.0. Despite this lower value, the treatment 
effect seen in Study 114 was statistically significant. The 95% CI of the treatment effect in Study 114 
(1.1 to 4.4) substantially overlapped with that seen in Study 106 (3.1 to 4.8), indicating that there is 
no statistical reason to believe that the overall treatment effect between Studies 114 and 106 would be 
different. Similarly, as the 95% CI of the treatment effect in Study 114 (1.1 to 4.4) also overlapped 
substantially with that of the Study 106 subgroup of baseline ppFEV1 below 40% (1.0, 6.1), the 2 
treatment effects from respective studies are not statistically different. More important, in Study 106, 
the treatment effects are comparable among the subgroups of baseline ppFEV1 ≥70% (3.7 [95% CI, 
2.2, 5.2]), ≥40% to <70% (4.2 [95% CI, 3.1, 5.2]), and <40% (3.5 [95% CI, 1.0, 6.1]). Therefore, 
these results from Studies 106 and 114 collectively support the conclusion that all subjects will benefit 
from TEZ/IVA treatment regardless of the baseline ppFEV1. 
Assessment 
This question was asked to see whether the more severely affected population (with ppFEV1 <40%) 
perceived less benefit of TEZ/IVA, and could be the reason for the numerically lower effect as seen in 
study 114. The MAH did not provide the requested data on the patients with FEV1 ≥40% and patients 
with FEV1 <40%, but did provide a discussion on the comparison of the data with pivotal study 106.  
Overall, taking also the analysis provided in question 2 into account, we consider that the effects seen 
in study 114 might be numerically lower, but that these differences cannot be considered statistically 
significant or clinically relevant.  
Issue resolved

Period (Day 1 through Day 56) is 8 weeks. It is not understood how/why these patients had 
an exposure duration > 8 weeks. The Company is requested for an explanation. 
Response MAH: 
In Study 114, the exposure duration is defined as the date of last dose of study drug minus the date of 
the first dose plus 1 day. There was a plus or minus 5-day window for the Day 56 Visit. Therefore, 
exposure exceeded 8 weeks (56 days) for subjects who completed the actual Day 56 Visit between 1 
and 5 days after 56 days in the Treatment Period (Day 57 to Day 61). 
Assessment 
The MAH sufficiently explained the exposure duration of > 8 weeks in some of the patients.

Extension of indication to include the treatment of 
adult patients with moderately to severely active 
ulcerative colitis (UC) who have had an inadequate 
response, lost response, or were intolerant to either 
conventional therapy or a biologic agent for Zeposia; 
as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 
and 5.2 of the SmPC and Annex IID are updated. 
The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. In 
addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) 
took the opportunity to implement editorial changes 
throughout the product information. Version 2.1 of 
the RMP has been approved. 
C.I.4 
Update of sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC in order 
to update the current SmPC description about PK 
interaction with BCRP inhibitors based on the study 
report from a drug interaction study with 
cyclosporine l(RPC-1063-CP-001).  
The group of variations leads to amendments to the 
Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and 
Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan 
(RMP).

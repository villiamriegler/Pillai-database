are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Labelling and 
white blood cell count (uncommon); anaphylactic shock 
consideration data from clinical studies and post-
marketing experience. The Package Leaflet has been 
updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to implement minor editorial changes in 
PL 
(frequency not known); heart rate decreased (common); 
oropharyngeal pain (rare); rhinorrhoea (rare); blood urine 
present (uncommon). In addition, certain already labelled

SmPC section 4.6 was updated to clarify that no studies 
have been performed to evaluate the effect of topical ocular 
administration of Azarga on human fertility. The changes to 
sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC were very minor and/or 
editorial.  
The Package Leaflet was updated to emphasise (in line with 
the SmPC) that the use of the product should be 
discontinued if signs of serious reactions or hypersensitivity 
occur, and to highlight that increase in pupil size when 
taking Azarga and adrenaline (epinephrine) together has 
been reported occasionally.

order to update the safety information of Azarga eye 
II and PL 
The MAH undertook a review of the available data 
drops, following a review of the available clinical data 
supporting the safety of the product. The Package 
Leaflet was updated accordingly. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
supporting the safety profile of Azarga (10 mg/ml 
brinzolamide + 5 mg/ml timolol) eye drops. No new clinical 
trial data were evaluated for the purpose of this review, 
which was based on data from previously completed clinical 
studies and post-marketing experience with the product.  
Practical instructions about the tamper evident snap collar 
were included (“After the cap is removed, if the tamper 
evident snap collar is loose, remove before using product”)

data available from clinical trials, post-marketing studies 
and PL 
and spontaneous reports as well as the scientific literature, 
the CHMP concluded that there were no major changes to 
the known benefits and safety concerns associated with 
Azarga when used in the approved indication. The CHMP 
therefore concluded that the benefit/risk balance of Azarga 
to decrease intraocular pressure (IOP) in adult patients 
with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension for whom 
monotherapy provides insufficient IOP reduction remained 
favourable and recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity.

size 
In summary, the text on possible occurrence of allergic 
reactions for both active ingredients of Azarga, was 
strengthened, since systemic absorption of these might 
occur. For the same reason, the text in relation to class 
effects for medicines called sulphonamides (one ingredient 
of Azarga is a sulphonamide) to inform on the risk of 
metabolic acidosis in patients at risk of renal impairment, 
and for beta-blockers (one other ingredient of Azarga is a 
beta blocker) to inform on the risk of muscle weakness was 
improved.  
The CHMP considered the proposals for the SmPC and the 
PL to be acceptable and overall improve the text of the 
prescribing and patient information.

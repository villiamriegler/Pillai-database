1.  Introduction 
On 24 October 2022, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Zinplava (Study P001), in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that Study P001 (a Phase 3, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-
site, double-blind trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and efficacy of a single 
infusion of bezlotoxumab in paediatric participants from 1 to <18 years of age receiving antibacterial 
drug treatment for Clostridioides difficile Infection (CDI)) is part of a clinical development programme. 
An extension application consisting of the full relevant data package (i.e. containing several studies) is 
expected to be submitted by Q1/2023. A line listing of all the concerned studies is annexed. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Paediatric participants in P001 were administered bezlotoxumab identical in formulation to 
commercially available bezlotoxumab: 
Zinplava 25 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion. Each mL of concentrate contains 25 mg 
bezlotoxumab. One 40 mL vial contains 1,000 mg of bezlotoxumab. 
CHMP comment 
The planned variation will also include an update to the smaller volume single does vial containing 625 
mg/25 mL (25mg/mL). The vial size contains the same concentration of the currently marketed vial 
(1000mg/ mL) [25mg/ mL)] with the only difference between the smaller and larger vials being the 
total volume held (25mL and 40mL, respectively). 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for Study P001. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study  
Study P001: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety, 
Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Efficacy of a Single Infusion of Bezlotoxumab (MK-6072, Human 
Monoclonal Antibody to C. difficile Toxin B) in Children Aged 1 to <18 Years Receiving Antibacterial 
Drug Treatment for C. difficile Infection (MODIFY III) 
 
Description 
Methods 
Study participants 
Male and female participants aged 1 to <18 years with C. difficile infection (CDI) (confirmed presence 
of C. difficile toxin in stool) and receiving antibacterial drug treatment were eligible to participate. 
Treatments 
Bezlotoxumab 10 mg/kg or placebo. 
Objective(s) 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Participants were followed for 12 weeks for PK and immunogenicity collections, monitoring of safety 
and tolerability parameters, and efficacy outcomes 
 
Sample size 
The planned sample size was 192 participants, which was reduced to a minimum of 140 participants 
based on a review of blinded safety data that supported the determination that enrolment of additional 
 
participants was not needed to characterize the safety and tolerability of MK-6072 in paediatric 
patients.  
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Eligible participants were stratified by age at randomization (Age Cohort 1: 12 to <18 years of age, 
Age Cohort 2: 1 to <12 years of age). 
Statistical Methods 
The primary population for noncompartmental PK analysis was the per-protocol population (PP), which 
consisted of a subset of 91 participants who received bezlotoxumab and who had at least 4 post-dose 
PK samples. AUC0-inf data were natural log transformed and compared to historical adult data using 
an analysis of variance model with a factor for group (paediatric participants and adults). Separate 
models were used for each paediatric cohort. A point estimate of the GMR (pediatric 
participants/adults) of bezlotoxumab AUC0-inf with 90% confidence interval (CI) was generated from 
the model for each cohort. The 90% CIs of the GMRs were compared using prespecified clinical 
comparability bounds (0.6, 1.6), to determine if the AUC0-inf of bezlotoxumab in each cohort was 
similar to the AUC0-inf in adults. 
Safety analyses were performed on the APaT population, which included all randomized participants 
who received study intervention. The primary safety objective was addressed by the Tier 2 endpoints: 
proportion of participants with any adverse event (AE), any intervention-related AE, any serious 
adverse event (SAE), any intervention-related SAE, infusion-related reactions; the proportion of 
participants who discontinued study intervention due to an AE; AE (specific preferred terms), system 
organ classes with frequency ≥12 participants in the bezlotoxumab arm and or ≥2 participants in the 
placebo arm. These analyses were performed using the Miettinen and Nurminen asymptotic method 
(1985) and 95% CIs were provided. 
Secondary efficacy analyses were performed using a 2-sided 95% CI based on the Miettinen and 
Nurminen method stratified by age cohort (12 to <18 years of age, 1 to <12 years of age) using a 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel weight to evaluate the treatment differences for (1) CDI recurrence, (2) 
sustained clinical response, and (3) CDI recurrence among participants at high risk of CDI recurrence 
within 12 weeks of study medication infusion. 
 
 
Results 
Participant flow 
Baseline data 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were generally comparable between study intervention 
groups.  
Six participants 1 to <2 years of age were enrolled; 4 received a single IV infusion of bezlotoxumab 
 
 
Pharmacokinetics 
To address the primary objective of the study, the PK of bezlotoxumab 10 mg/kg was characterized in 
paediatric participants in 2 age cohorts. 
Serum samples of bezlotoxumab were collected following a single IV dose from samples at Day 1, Day 
10, Week 4 (±3 days), and Weeks 8 and 12 (±5 days) after the end of infusion and analysed using a 
validated assay to measure bezlotoxumab concentration. Exposure (AUC0-inf) in paediatric participants 
were considered to be similar to those in adults if the observed GMR (paediatric participants/adults) for 
AUC0-inf of bezlotoxumab contained in the clinical comparability bounds of (0.6, 1.6). Other PK 
endpoints of interest were Cmax, Tmax, t1/2, Vd and CL. PK sampling was planned for all participants 
(Panels A and B) and confirmation of dose selection for paediatric patients (1 to <18 years) was based 
on the final PK analysis population, including those evaluated in each of the IAs. The recommended 
adult dose of 10 mg/kg was initially evaluated for both age cohorts in Panel A of P001. Once Panel A 
was completed for each age cohort, an interim PK analysis was performed to confirm the dose for 
Panel B.  
 
The results of this analysis supported the use of the 10 mg/kg dose in Panel B. The 90% CI of 
paediatric/adult GMR AUC0-inf was within the prespecified clinical comparability bounds (0.6, 1.6) for 
each age cohort in Panel A. At the completion of the study, PK across Panels A and B was assessed 
relative to the clinical comparability bounds established for AUC0-inf in adults. The 90% CIs of 
paediatric/adult GMRs serum bezlotoxumab AUC0-inf were within the prespecified clinical comparability 
bounds of (0.6, 1.6) for each of the paediatric age cohorts, supporting the primary hypothesis that 
AUC0-inf in paediatric participants is similar to that in adults following administration of a 10 mg/kg 
dosage regimen [Table 2.5: 2]. 
The recommended adult dose of 10 mg/kg was initially evaluated for both age cohorts in Panel A of 
P001. Once Panel A was completed for each age cohort, an interim PK analysis was performed to 
confirm the dose for Panel B. The results of this analysis supported the use of the 10 mg/kg dose in 
Panel B. The 90% CI of paediatric/adult GMR AUC0-inf was within the prespecified clinical 
comparability bounds (0.6, 1.6) for each age cohort in Panel A. At the completion of the study, PK 
across Panels A and B was assessed relative to the clinical comparability bounds established for AUC0-
inf in adults. The 90% CIs of paediatric/adult GMRs serum bezlotoxumab AUC0-inf were within the 
prespecified clinical comparability bounds of (0.6, 1.6) for each of the paediatric age cohorts, 
supporting the primary hypothesis that AUC0-inf in paediatric participants is similar to that in adults 
following administration of a 10 mg/kg dosage regimen [Table 2.5: 2]. PK data and non-
compartmental PK analysis indicate a slightly lower exposure in each paediatric age cohort compared 
to the adult population. This is likely to be attributed to the higher weight-normalized clearance in 
children (see figures below). 
 
 
 
 
Immunogenicity: 
Two participants (2%) had a low magnitude titre (≤25x) ADA positive response to bezlotoxumab and 
no samples were positive for Nab. 
Efficacy results 
Efficacy outcomes were secondary endpoints in P001; the study was not powered for formal hypothesis 
testing of between-intervention group comparisons The efficacy analyses for this study were conducted 
using the mITT population [Table 2.5:1]. The main analysis for CDI recurrence was based on a subset 
of the mITT population consisting of participants who achieved an initial clinical response. 
The percentage of participants in the mITT population with initial clinical response who had CDI 
recurrence was low and comparable between intervention groups [Table 2.5: 3].  
No clinically meaningful differences were observed in the percentage of participants with CDI 
recurrence when analysed across subgroups (i.e., subgroups of age cohort, sex, race, primary 
treatment for baseline CDI episode, or adjunctive treatment [metronidazole IV] for baseline CDI 
episode) compared with the overall population. 
Further findings were: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The percentage of participants in the mITT population with initial clinical response who had CDI 
recurrence was comparable between intervention groups (bezlotoxumab: 11.2%); placebo: 
14.7%). 
The percentage of participants in the mITT population who had sustained clinical response was 
comparable between intervention groups (bezlotoxumab: 83.7%; placebo: 82.9%). There were 
no clinically meaningful differences observed in sustained clinical response across the 
subgroups analysed compared with the overall population 
The percentage of participants in the mITT population with initial clinical response who had CDI 
recurrence and were at high risk for CDI recurrence was comparable between intervention 
groups (bezlotoxumab:12.1%; placebo: 15.2%). 
The percentage of participants in the mITT population with sustained clinical response and 
were at high risk for CDI recurrence was comparable between intervention groups 
(bezlotoxumab: 82.5%; placebo: 82.4%). 
 
 
Assessor’s comment 
Efficacy outcomes were secondary endpoints in P001: the study was not powered for formal hypothesis 
testing of between-intervention group comparisons. Nevertheless, the outcome is unexpected and 
sheds some doubts on the efficacy in the target population and the validity of the assumed 
extrapolation concept that is based on exposure matching. The data will be scrutinised in the context 
of the forthcoming type II variation. 
Safety results 
The evaluation of safety and tolerability of bezlotoxumab compared with placebo following a single 
infusion through 12 weeks was a primary objective of the study. 
Safety and tolerability were evaluated by collection of AE data, clinical laboratory evaluations, and vital 
sign measurements. Safety analyses were performed on the APaT population. These analyses were 
performed using the M&N asymptotic method (1985).  
All participants who received study intervention completed a single infusion of either 10 mg/kg 
bezlotoxumab or placebo, therefore the extent of exposure was the same for all participants.  
Adverse events 
Most participants experienced AEs during the 12-week follow-up period and most of these AEs were 
considered not related to study intervention by the investigator [Table 2.5: 4]. 
A higher observed incidence of AEs considered related to study intervention by the investigator was 
reported for the participants in the bezlotoxumab group (15.9%) compared with the placebo group 
 
 
(8.3%), with a 95% CI for the treatment difference that included zero. Most of these intervention-
related AEs were mild in intensity and resolved.  
The most frequently reported AEs (reported for ≥20% participants in either intervention group) were: 
febrile neutropenia (bezlotoxumab: 21.5%, placebo: 30.6%), pyrexia (17.8%, 30.6%), headache 
(14.0%, 22.2%), and vomiting (13.1%, 22.2%) [Table 12-2]. 
The most frequently reported AEs considered related to study intervention by the investigator in the 
bezlotoxumab group were ALT increased, AST increased, and headache (each for 3 [2.8%] 
participants). The most frequently reported intervention-related AE in the placebo group was headache 
(2 [5.6%] participants) 
 
 
No participant discontinued study intervention due to an AE. 
Serious adverse events and death 
The most frequently reported SAEs (reported for ≥5% in either intervention group) were febrile 
neutropenia (bezlotoxumab: 20.6%; placebo: 30.6%), pyrexia (3.7%; 8.3%), C. difficile colitis (0.9%; 
5.6%), and urinary tract infection (2.9%; 5.6%) [Table 14.3-12]. 
 
Six participant deaths occurred due to AEs that began during the 12-week study period (5 in the 
bezlotoxumab group, 1 in the placebo group). None of the deaths were considered related to study 
intervention by the investigator. 
There were 2 intervention-related SAEs (both in the bezlotoxumab group); intussusception and nausea 
(each reported in 1 participant) and both events resolved. 
Two participants (1 in each intervention group) experienced a protocol-defined infusion related 
AE; both AEs were of decreased blood pressure, were mild in intensity and resolved. 
No participant discontinued study intervention due to an AE. 
Laboratory findings 
No participants had laboratory values that met the predefined ECI criteria for hepatic test 
abnormalities requiring additional evaluation of an underlying aetiology.  
 
The percentage of participants who had chemistry and haematology laboratory findings that met 
predetermined criteria was generally comparable between intervention groups [ Table 14.3-14, 14.3-
15]. There were no clinically meaningful findings in vital sign measurements for either intervention 
group.  
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The primary objective of the study was to characterize bezlotoxumab PK in children and adolescents (1 
to < 18 years).  
 
 
Secondary efficacy endpoints were analysed from study intervention through the 12-week follow-up 
(Day 85 ± 5 days). The study was not powered for formal hypothesis testing of between-intervention 
group comparisons. 
The exposure (AUC0-inf) of bezlotoxumab, following a single IV infusion of 10 mg/kg in paediatric 
patients (1 to <18 years of age) is comparable to that in adult patients. Non-compartmental PK 
analysis and statistical analysis indicate that the observed GMR (paediatric participants/adults) for 
AUC0-inf of bezlotoxumab in different paediatric age groups was not exceeding the clinical 
comparability bounds of (0.6, 1.6). There was a trend in decreasing exposure with decrease in age, 
that might plausibly be attributed to the increase in weight-normalised clearance.  Thus, the MAH 
concluded that the results are supporting the determination that the efficacy conclusion in adults can 
be extrapolated to the paediatric population (1 to <18 years of age). This conclusion cannot be shared. 
In principle, given the results of the pk evaluation it could be expected that the paediatric patients 
show the clinical results as the adult patients. However, all clinical endpoints showed comparable 
results between the groups. The study failed to demonstrate clinical efficacy of bezlotoxumab in 
paediatric patients with Clostridium difficile infection. Although the study was not powered for formal 
hypothesis testing of between-intervention group comparisons, the outcome is unexpected. This sheds 
some doubts on the efficacy in the target population and on the validity of the assumed extrapolation 
concept that is currently based on exposure matching and exposure/response similarity between adults 
and paediatric subjects at all age groups. The data will be scrutinised in the context of the forthcoming 
type II variation. 
The evaluation of safety and tolerability of bezlotoxumab compared with placebo following a single 
infusion through 12 weeks was a primary objective of the study.  
A higher observed incidence of AEs considered related to study intervention by the investigator was 
reported for the participants in the bezlotoxumab group (15.9%) compared with the placebo group 
(8.3%), with a 95% CI for the treatment difference that included zero. There was a lower incidence of 
SAEs in the bezlotoxumab (53.3%) group compared with the placebo (80.6%) group, with a 95% CI 
for the treatment difference that excluded zero. Most SAEs were considered not related to study 
intervention. SAEs considered related to study intervention by the investigator were reported for 2 
participants (intussusception and nausea, 1 participant each, both in the bezlotoxumab group). Given 
the above, the favourable safety profile of bezlotoxumab is confirmed.  
Six participant deaths occurred due to AEs that began during the 12-week study period (5 in the 
bezlotoxumab group, 1 in the placebo group). The MAH claimed that none of the deaths were 
considered related to study intervention by the investigator.  
No action is required, however the MAH intends to submit an EoI to include treatment of paediatric 
patients. The data will be scrutinised in the context of the extension of indication. Considering the 
unexpected efficacy outcome, the MAH might consider gaining further evidence to support the 
paediatric indication.  
3.  Overall conclusion and recommendation 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

INTRODUCTION 
Voriconazole  is  a  second  generation  triazole  and  is  the  result  of  a  discovery  programme  aimed  at 
improving  the  potency  and  spectrum  of  fluconazole.  In  order  to  enhance  the  spectrum,  one  triazole 
moiety with a 4-fluoropyrimidine group was substituted and an α-methyl group was added to provide 
activity against Aspergillus species and a range of other moulds. 
Voriconazole is a broad spectrum triazole antifungal agent and is indicated as follows : 
treatment of invasive aspergillosis 
treatment of fluconazole-resistant serious invasive Candida infections (including C. Krusei). 
- 
- 
-  Treatment of serious fungal infections caused by Scedosporium spp. and Fusarium spp. 
Voriconazole  should  be  administered  primarily  to  immunocompromised  patients  with  progressive, 
possibly life-threatening infections. 
The  applicant  submitted  an  application  for  a  line  extension  for  VFEND,  containing  the  active 
substance  voriconazole  via  a  Centralised  Procedure.  This  line  extension  is  a  powder  for  oral 
suspension (POS) containing 40 mg/ml voriconazole following reconstitution. 
VFEND  film  coated  tablets  50  mg  and  200  mg  and  powder  for  solution  for  infusion  200  mg 
(equivalent to 10 mg/ml) were registered via the Centralised Procedure in March 2002. 
The  high oral bioavailability (96%)  of voriconazole enables  switching between intravenous  and oral 
treatment. Current therapy using either the IV or oral tablet formulations allows flexibility in patient 
care and the possibility of prolonged treatment with a single, effective agent.  The tablet formulation, 
however,  may  not  meet  the  needs  of  all  patients,  e.g.  those  who  may  have  difficulty  in  swallowing, 
paediatric  patients,  or  those  who  dislike  taking  tablets.    This  is  of  particular  importance  considering 
the debilitated patient population experiencing serious fungal infections.  Voriconazole POS has been 
designed to fulfil this medical need.   
This  application  is  based  on  the  bioequivalence  of  the  powder  for  oral  solution  dosage  form  with 
previously authorised tablet formulation. The proposed posology for the oral suspension is similar to 
the posology of the already authorised tablets. Cross-reference is made to the non-clinical and clinical 
data previously presented in the original marketing application for the tablets.

PART II: CHEMICAL, PHARMACEUTICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ASPECTS 
2.1 
Composition 
Vfend  is  formulated  as  a  multidose  powder  for  oral  suspension  containing,  after  reconstitution,  40 
mg/ml of voriconazole as active substance. 
The other ingredients include sucrose, silica colloidal, titanium dioxide, xanthan gum, sodium citrate, 
citric acid anhydrous, sodium benzoate, and natural orange flavour. 
It  is  presented  in  a  high-density  polyethylene  (HPDE)  bottle  with  a  child-resistant  polypropylene 
closure. A 5 ml polypropylene oral syringe, calibrated with respect to volume and voriconazole dose, 
and a press-in bottle adaptor are provided. The powder is to be reconstituted with water prior first use 
by using the polypropylene cup supplied. 
2.2 
Active substance 
No change has been made to the oral grade active substance already authorised for Vfend film-coated 
tablets (EU/1/02/212/01-24).  
Voriconazole  has  a  low  aqueous  solubility,  its  maximum  solubility  being  in  acidic  conditions  (2.7 
mg/ml at pH 1.2). The particle size distribution specification acceptance criteria of the drug substance 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
used for this  new formulation  was  based  on development studies  and (see  product  development and 
finished product) is consistent with the current specification for voriconazole oral grade. 
2.3 
Other ingredients 
All the excipients comply with the Ph. Eur. requirements except the natural orange flavour, which is 
adequately controlled according to a different standard.  
Regarding the TSE risk, the oral suspension does not include any components of ruminant origin. 
Satisfactory  specifications  have  been  provided  for  the  HDPE  bottle  and  the  child-resistant 
polypropylene  closure.  The  compatibility  of  the  powder  and  of  the  constituted  suspension  with  the 
primary packaging has been satisfactorily demonstrated.  
The oral syringe and the measuring cup are CE marked and have been approved for their intended use. 
The  accuracy  and  reproducibility  of  the  volume  delivered  by  these  medical  devices  have  been 
satisfactorily demonstrated. 
2.4 
Product development and finished product 
This  new  oral  formulation  has  been  mainly  developed  for  patients  who  have  difficulties  or  dislike 
swallowing tablets, this being of particular importance considering the debilitated patient  population 
experiencing serious fungal infections.  
A  dry  powder  formulation  to  be  reconstituted  has  been  chosen  over  a  “ready-to-use”  liquid 
formulation  based  on  the  active  substance  properties:  low  solubility  and  instability  in  aqueous 
environments, and good stability in the solid state. 
It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  particle  size  of  the  active  substance  has  no  influence  on 
manufacturing  process,  suspension  properties  and  stability  of  the  finished  product.  However,  an 
apparent relationship between this parameter and in vitro dissolution was observed, but batches with a 
wide  range of  particle size  distribution have  been  shown to  be  clinically  acceptable. Based on these 
data,  an  appropriate  particle  size  specification  for  voriconazole  drug  substance  has  been  established 
(see active substance). 
All the excipients selected are commonly used. The reconstituted suspension has a pH of 4 which is 
satisfactory  for  the  stability  of  voriconazole  and  maintains  the  antimicrobial  efficacy  of  sodium 
benzoate, which has been demonstrated according to Ph. Eur. 
Development studies have investigated the potential for particle growth in the constituted suspension, 
constitution time, redispersibility and dose uniformity at first use and throughout the in-use shelf life. 
The  particle  size  did  not  change  significantly  during  the  in-use  shelf  life  of  the  finished  product. 
Following constitution or resuspension, a satisfactory dose could be withdrawn after shaking for a few 
seconds. Dose volumes  were found  to  have  uniform content  of  active substance  both  at constitution 
and throughout the in-use shelf life of the product. 
The overfill of 5 ml is suitable to allow the label claim volume to be withdrawn.  
Bioequivalence  of  the  “proposed  commercial  powder  for  oral  suspension”  formulation  versus  the 
commercial tablet formulation has been satisfactorily demonstrated.  
The  finished  product  is  produced  using  a  standard  process  comprising  the  following  steps:  initial 
blending of  the  excipients,  milling  of the excipients,  post  milling  blending, addition of  voriconazole 
and of the flavour, blending, screening, final blending and primary packaging.  
The  milling  of  the  excipients  has  been  identified  as  a  critical  step,  the  milling  speed  influencing 
particle size distribution in the excipient blend.

Specification 
The  product  specification  include  tests  for  appearance  of  powder,  identity  (IR),  assay  (HPLC,  95-
105%  release  and  end  of  shelf  life),  fill  weight,  sodium  benzoate  content  and  identity,  degradation 
products, appearance of constituted suspension, pH, viscosity, titanium dioxide, microorganism count 
(Ph. Eur.). 
No  specification  has  been  included  for  the  new  impurity  arising  due  to  an  interaction  between  a 
degradation product of voriconazole and a known degradation product of sucrose taking into account 
the non significant concentration (<10 ppm) found in samples stored under long term and accelerated 
conditions  and  the  results  of  the  genetic  toxicology  assays  (see  Part  III:  Toxico-pharmacological 
aspects). Based on the development studies, no specification has been included so far for particle size 
distribution, constitution time and redispersibility. No dissolution test is included as the performance 
of the finished  product is more appropriately assessed  by controlling the particle size distribution of 
the active substance and the viscosity of the constituted suspension. 
Batch analysis data provided for 9 batches (2 manufactured at the intended manufacturing site) met the 
specification  at  the  time  of  release  and  confirm  the  robustness  and  reproducibility  of  the 
manufacturing process. 
2.5 
Stability of the Product 
Stability of the product before reconstitution 
Under long-term conditions (5ºC - packaging intended for commercialisation), 12-month data and 6-
month data are respectively available for 1 batch produced at the intended manufacturing site and for 
three  batches  manufactured  at  another  site.  Up  to  12-month  data  are  available  under  accelerated 
conditions (25ºC/60% R.H. - packaging intended for commercialisation). Stress testing studies as well 
as  a  photostability  study  have  been  performed  and  showed  that  the  finished  product  is  not  light 
sensitive. 
The results presented support the proposed shelf life and storage conditions defined in the SPC. 
In-use stability of the reconstituted suspension 
In-use  stability  of  the  reconstituted  suspensionwas  tested  (upright  and  inverted  positions).  The 
reconstituted suspension was shown to be chemically and physically stable during the in-use period, 
either  directly  after  reconstitution  with  water  or  after  storage.  Stress  testing  studies  as  well  as  a 
photostability study have been performed and showed that the product is not light sensitive.  
The results presented support the proposed in-use shelf life and storage conditions defined in the SPC. 
2.6 
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
The  active  substance  is  well  characterised  and  documented.  The  pharmaceutical  form  selected  is 
adequate  taken  into  account  the  properties  and  stability  of  the  active  substance.  The  excipients  are 
commonly  used  in  this  kind  of  formulation  and  the  packaging  material  is  well  documented.  The 
manufacturing  process  has  been  shown  to  be  capable  of  producing  reproducible  finished  product 
batches. Stability tests under ICH conditions indicate that the product is stable for the proposed shelf 
life. At the time of the CPMP opinion there were some outstanding quality issues which had no impact 
on the benefit/risk profile. The applicant committed to provide the necessary information as follow-up 
measures within an agreed timeframe, and to submit variations if required following the evaluation of 
this additional information.

PART III: TOXICO-PHARMACOLOGICAL ASPECTS 
3.1 
Pharmacology 
The pharmacology has been thoroughly characterized and presented to support the oral and IV Vfend 
formulations. As the new formulation is not expected to affect the pharmacology of voriconazole, no 
new studies have been performed. 
3.2 
Pharmacokinetics 
As  pharmacokinetics  have  been  thoroughly  characterized  and  presented  to  support  the  oral  and  IV 
Vfend formulations, no new pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted with voriconazole powder 
oral suspension (POS).  
The  new  pharmaceutical  form,  POS,  may  potentially  affect  absorption  rate  and  therefore  show 
different  pharmacokinetics.  Bioequivalence,  however,  was  studied  in  humans  and  is  assessed  in  the 
Clinical  Critical  Assessment  Report.  It  is  therefore  accepted  that  no  new  pharmacokinetic  studies 
were performed in animals. 
3.3 
Toxicology 
The  toxicology  profile  has  been  thoroughly  characterized  and  presented  to  support  the  oral  and  IV 
Vfend  formulations.  The  only  additional  toxicology  data,  to  those  included  in  the  previous 
voriconazole  submissions,  are  two  genotoxicity  studies  conducted  with  UK-519,140,  which  was  not 
present in the original voriconazole formulations: 
-  Microbial reverse mutation assay at 0.06 mg/plate (Study No. 02-2532-01) 
-  Mouse micronucleus assay mice at 2 mg/kg (Study No. 02-2532-02)

In  voriconazole  POS,  UK-51,060  is  the  primary  degradation  product  of  voriconazole,  while  5-
hydroxymethylfurfuraldehyde  (5-HMF)  is  a  potential  degradation  product  of  the  sucrose  excipient. 
UK-51,060  has  been  qualified  in  the  previous  voriconazole  submission  and  5-HMF  is  a  recognized 
impurity  in  a  number  of  food  products  (e.g.  caramel,  jam,  preserved  fruit)  at  concentrations  up  to  1 
mg/g. A safe oral dose of 5-HMF is reported to be 2 mg/kg (cited in Ulbricht et al, 1984). 
The two degradation products (UK-51,060 and 5-HMF) have been found to react in stressed samples 
of  voriconazole  POS  to  form  an  impurity  UK-519,140.  However,  further  testing  demonstrated  no 
significant  concentration  (<10  ppm)  of  UK-519,140  in  samples  stored  at  5°C  (long  term  storage)  or 
25°C/60%RH  (accelerated  storage).  UK-519,140  was  not  present  in  voriconazole  tested  in  the 
toxicology program for the original filing. 
The applicant demonstrated that a new impurity, UK-519,140, may be formed in stressed samples of 
voriconazole POS. In accordance with ICH Q3B, the applicant was prompted to perform genotoxicity 
testing  when  a  substituted  vinyl  ketone  was  identified  as  a  structural  alert  for  genotoxicity.  The 
6 
 
 
 
  
applicant performed a microbial reverse mutation assay and an oral in vivo micronucleus assay 
in mice. This is considered an acceptable screen for genotoxic potential of a new impurity. 
The  toxicology  of  voriconazole  has  been  previously  assessed  in  the  Marketing  Authorisation 
Application  for  Vfend  IV  and  tablet  formulations.  Compared  to  the  marketed  formulations  the  only 
toxicological issue regards the formation of  UK-519,140 in stressed samples of the POS formulation. 
The  repeat  dose  toxicity  of  this  impurity  has  not  been  addressed  by  the  applicant.  However,  as  the 
level  of  this  impurity  remains  below  10  ppm  when  stored  under  refrigerated  conditions,  as  is 
prescribed,  the  lack  of  such  studies  is  accepted.  The  applicant  identified  a  structural  alert  for 
genotoxicity in UK-519,140, which prompted the applicant to perform a genotoxicity screen for this 
impurity consisting of a microbial reverse mutation assay and an in vivo micronucleus assay in mice. 
Both  studies  were  negative,  but  the  bacterial  assay  is  considered  less  adequate  as  only  one 
concentration  was  tested  (0.06  mg/plate),  whereas  the  OECD  guidelines  indicate  that  a  range  of 
concentrations  should  be  tested  with  a  maximum  of  5  mg/plate,  and  the  micronucleus  assay  is 
considered inconclusive, since exposure of the target tissue was not demonstrated. Nevertheless, UK-
519,140 is considered of no toxicological concern in view of the negative findings in the studies 
performed and the lack of significant concentration (<10 ppm) of UK-519,140 in samples stored 
at 5°C (long term storage) or 25°C/60%RH (accelerated storage). 
3.4 
Discussion on toxico-pharmacological aspects 
Considering that a favorable safety profile has been previously established for Vfend for the treatment 
of  fungal  infections  and,  in  view  of  the  negative  results  of  the  two  additional  genetic  toxicology 
studies conducted, informations given are acceptable. There is no need for more studies. 
The proposed wording of  the sections 4.3, 4.6, 4.9, 5.1 (non-clinical data), and 5.3 of the Summary of 
Product  Characterisics  is  identical  to  the  concurrent  sections  of  the  SPC  for  Vfend  oral  tablet 
formulation, and is agreed. 
4. 
PART IV: CLINICAL ASPECTS 
4.1 
Clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacodynamics 
Voriconazole  is  a  second  generation  triazole  with  a  close  structural  similarity  to  fluconazole.  Like 
other  azole  antifungals,  voriconazole  acts  by  inhibiting  the  cytochrome  P450-dependent  14-α-sterol 
demethylase  required  for  ergosterol  biosynthesis.  Fungi  are  therefore  depleted  of  ergosterol  and 
accumulate  14-α-methylated  sterols  that  are  thought  to  disrupt  membrane  structure  and  function, 
thereby inhibiting fungal growth.  
Pharmacokinetics 
• 
Bioequivalence studies 
Three bioequivalence studies were conducted, one pivotal study (A1501028) using two batches of the 
proposed  commercial  POS  formulation  (these  two  batches  differed  only  in  terms  of  particle  size 
distribution  of  the  in  going  drug  substance),  and  two formulation  development  studies  [A1501019 
(using a similar suspension formulation compared with the to be marketed formulation, but the volume 
of  water  used  for  constitution  of  the  proposed  marketed  formulation  was  changed)  and  150-248 
(research  formulation;  this  latter  study  was  submitted  with  the  original  marketing  application)]. 
Reference was the marketed 200 mg voriconazole tablet.    
Study  150-248:  In  this  study  14  healthy  male  volunteers  (aged  20  –  29  years,  13  homozygote 
extensive metabolisers (EM) and one homozygote poor metaboliser (PM)) were included. There were 
2 treatment periods. Each subject received at day one 400 mg BID voriconazole and at the subsequent 
5.5 days 200 mg BID voriconazole. Plasma samples (obtained at the last day of the treatment period) 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
were analysed for voriconazole by a validated HPLC method with a quantitation limit of 10 ng/ml and 
a  calibration  curve  of  10  –  3000  ng/ml.  The  results  at  steady  state  showed  bioequivalence  for  Cmax 
(ratio 1.02, 90% confidence interval 0.89 – 1.18) and AUCτ (ratio 1.04, 90% confidence interval 0.97 
– 1.12). 
The research powder for oral suspension formulation is bioequivalent with the tablet formulation. 
Study  A1501028:  In  this  study  45  healthy  males,  aged  18  –  35  years  were  included.  Each  subject 
received  at  day  one  400  mg  BID  voriconazole  and  at  the  subsequent  5.5  days  200  mg  BID 
voriconazole in the fasted state (2 treatment periods, reference tablet and test suspension). In a third 
period, subjects received also the suspension, but from another batch. Plasma samples (obtained at last 
day  of  each  treatment  period)  were  analysed  for  voriconazole  by  a  validated  HPLC  method  with  a 
quantitation limit of 10 ng/ml and a calibration curve of 10 – 3000 ng/ml. The results at steady state 
and the statistical analysis are shown in table PK 1.

The  suspension  formulation  to  be  marketed  and  the  marketed  tablet  formulation  are  bioequivalent 
with regard to the rate and extent of absorption. 
Study A1501019: In this study 26 healthy volunteers (15 males and 11 females, aged 18 – 43 years 
were  included.  Pharmacokinetics  were  obtained  from  24  subjects.  Each  subject  received  at  day  one 
400 mg BID voriconazole and at the subsequent 5.5 days 200 mg BID voriconazole in the fasted state 
(2 treatment periods). In a third period, subjects received the suspension in the fed state (high fat meal, 
dose  taken  within  5  min  of  completing  the  meal).  Plasma  samples  (obtained  at  last  day  of  each 
treatment  period)  were  analysed  for  voriconazole  by  a  validated  HPLC  method  with  a  quantitation 
limit of 10 ng/ml and a calibration curve of 10 – 3000 ng/ml. The results at steady state showed that 
bioequivalence between the suspension and the tablet formulation (fasting) could only be proven for 
AUCτ (ratio 0.99, 90% confidence interval 0.94 – 1.05), and not for Cmax (ratio 1.15, 90% confidence 
interval 1.04 – 1.27). 
In addition, food decreased the rate (Cmax) and extent (AUC) of absorption of voriconazole from the 
suspension with 58 and 37%, respectively. 
In  study  A1501019  bioequivalence  could  not  be  proven  for  Cmax.  ,  including  a  total  of  24  male  and 
female  subjects.  Also  bioequivalence  could  not  be  proven  in  the  subgroup  of  15  male  subjects. 
However, in study A1501028, in which a similar dosing scheme was used as in study A1501019, but 
including  a  much  higher  number  of  subjects  (45  male  subjects)  bioequivalence  could  be  proven  for 
AUC and Cmax. The results of the latter study prevail, as the power of this study is higher.  
In conclusion, the tablet and suspension are bioequivalent with regard to Cmax and AUC.  
• 
Conclusion on pharmacokinetics 
The to be marketed suspension is bioequivalent with the marketed tablet formulation. Food decreased 
the rate and extent of absorption from the suspension with 58 and 37%, respectively. This effect was 
more pronounced than observed for the tablet formulation (34 and 24%, respectively). The food effect 
was  not  studied  with  the  to  be  marketed  formulation.  However,  taken  into  account  the  similarity 
between  the  suspension  used  in  the  food  interaction  study  and  the  to  be  marketed  suspension,  it  is 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
considered  that  the  results  obtained  in  the  food  interaction  study  can  be  extrapolated  to  the  to  be 
marketed suspension. 
Overall, the SPC is in accordance with that of the tablet formulation. However, the oral suspension 
should be taken at least one hour before, or two hours following a meal, whereas the tablet should 
be taken at least one hour before or one hour following a meal. 
Based upon the earlier studies for the tablets and IV formulation, children have a higher elimination 
capacity  than  adults  on  a  body  weight  basis.  Therefore,  to  achieve  exposures  in  children  consistent 
with  those  of  adults  higher  doses  will  be  required.  The  applicant  committed  in  March  2002  then 
(post  approval  commitment  number  13)  to  conduct  a  paediatric  trial  to  investigate  the 
pharmacokinetics of higher doses of voriconazole. The results of the latter trial are awaited in 3-
4Q 2004. 
4.2 
Clinical efficacy  
No efficacy studies have been conducted using voriconazole POS.  Efficacy is claimed on the basis 
of bioequivalence with the previously approved voriconazole tablets. 
4.3 
Clinical safety 
Extensive safety data for subjects exposed to voriconazole have been submitted previously to support 
the approval of the intravenous and oral formulations. The current application contains the safety data 
of the three POS bioequivalence studies. 
Patient exposure 
A total of 88 healthy volunteers (77 males, 11 females; age range 18-43 years) received at least one 
dose of voriconazole in the three open label, cross-over bioequivalence studies.  Eighty-five subjects 
received at least one dose of POS whilst 84 received the commercial tablet. The dosing regimen for 
voriconazole POS and tablet was the same for all three bioequivalence studies, i.e. 400mg bid on Day 
1 followed by 200mg bid for 5.5 days.

Across all three studies, the treatment related adverse events occurring in ≥10% of subjects receiving 
POS  were  abnormal  vision,  headache,  photophobia,  taste  perversion,  dizziness  and  abnormal 
dreams;  and  the  treatment  related  events  occurring  in  ≥10%  of  subjects  receiving  the  commercial 
tablet were photophobia, abnormal vision, headache and abnormal dreams.  
Since  the  experience  with  voriconazole  (tablets  /  iv)  in  paediatric  patients  is  limited,  the  applicant 
should  provide  a  safety  update  in  paediatric  patients  for  voriconazole  as  was  committed  during  first 
registration (postapproval commitment number 20). The applicant informed us that it would provide a 
paediatric  safety  update  using  data  from  the  two  competed  paediatric  IV  studies  (150-249  and 
A1501007)  which  were  already  submitted  with  the  main  filing,  and  the  new  paediatric  IV  and  POS 
study (A150137) when this study is completed. The applicant should commit to provide Reports of the 
paediatric trials 150-249, A1501007 and A1501037 by 3-4Q 2004. 
Although  the  pattern  of  events  was  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  of  voriconazole,  the 
frequency of adverse events in these bioequivalence studies was higher than in the previously reported 
trials.  The  scientific  discussion  of  VFEND  (CPMP/4049/01)  reported  the  following  percentages  of 
treatment related adverse events in 1 946 subjects (patients and volunteers) treated with voriconazole: 
abnormal vision 22.6%, headache 5.4% and photophobia 5.0%.  
Since the Powder for Oral Suspension (POS) was studied in healthy volunteers, the applicant provided 
a  comparison  between  the  frequency  of  adverse  events  in  the  POS  studies  and  the  MAA  Clinical 
Pharmacology population (N=289). The frequencies of treatment emergent, treatment related adverse 
events  reported  in  at  least  3  subjects  (≥  4%)  of  the  POS  population  are  compared  with  those  in  the 
MAA Clinical Pharmacology population below:

The  applicant  appropriately  considered  the  occurrence  of  taste  perversion  related  to  the  oral 
suspension  and  the  SPC  was  changed  accordingly.  All  gastrointestinal  disorders  included  a  waxy 
sensation in the mouth. The incidence was 9% for the POS and 5% for the tablet, so apparently there is 
no clear relation with the POS. Abnormal dreams and urinary frequency were reported in the POS 
trials in both groups the POS and tablet group in comparable percentages, which makes it unlikely that 
these adverse events could be attributed to the POS. The higher frequency compared to the previous 
reported frequency is most likely caused by a higher reporting rate during the POS trials. The same is 
likely to be true for the incidence of dry skin, although the frequency in the POS group seemed a little 
higher (8% vs 4% for POS vs. tablet, respectively). 
Palpitations  were  only  reported  for  the  POS.  As  mentioned  in  the  day  70  assessment  report 
arrhythmia’s have been observed previously in the voriconazole programme, in particular associated 
with the intravenous formulation. From the description of the present cases it seemed that the relation 
of the occurrence of palpitations with the voriconazole suspension is remote or unlikely. 
Several  events  occurred  more  frequently  with  the  POS  compared  to  the  tablet:  headache,  taste 
perversion,  palpitations,  dizziness,  insomnia,  gastrointestinal  disorders  and  nausea.  All  except 
headache (26% vs. 17% for POS vs. tablet, respectively) were sufficiently discussed by the applicant 
at  the  time  of  the  submission  of  the  dossier.  Therefore,  the  applicant  discussed  the  difference  in 
frequency of headache between POS and tablets in its response to the List of Questions adopted in 
July 2003. 
According to Table 6 of Module 2.7.4 Summary of Clinical Safety, the frequency of treatment related 
headache for  the POS was 26% (22/84 subjects) compared with 17% (14/84 subjects) for the tablet. 
This table,  however,  does not take  into account that,  for Studies  A1501019 and A1501028, subjects 
were exposed to the POS for two treatment periods and the tablet for only one treatment period. The 
frequency  of  treatment  related  headache  during  each  individual  POS  study  is  presented  in  the 
following table: 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  apparent  increase  in  frequency  of  headache  in  the  summary  of  frequency  across  all  three  POS 
studies combined is due to the way the data are presented, as some subjects contributed twice to the 
number of events in the POS arms of studies A1501019 and A1501028 but only once to the overall 
subject numbers. No correction for duration of exposure was made in the overall presentation. 
Furthermore, the incresed frequency of central nervous system adverse events associated with the POS 
formulation raises some concern, Considering the limited number of subjects assessed for safety, the 
applicant should commit to closely monitor CNS events in the subsequent PSURs. 
Serious adverse events and deaths  
No subjects died during the bioequivalence studies. 
One  serious  adverse  event  was  reported.  A  female  subject  in  Study A1501019  experienced 
palpitations  on  Days  3  and  7  of  POS  dosing  in  the  fed  state  (her  first  treatment  period).    Her  ECG 
taken  on  Day  3  was  normal  with  no  evidence  of  arrhythmia,  however,  telemetry  on  Day  7  showed 
ventricular  extrasystoles  (with  no  prolongation  of  the  QT  interval).    Dosing  was  permanently 
discontinued  due  to  the  extrasystoles,  and  the  event  was  considered  to  have  resolved  approximately 
15 minutes  after  the  extrasystoles  had  been  detected.    The  investigator  attributed  the  event  to 
voriconazole  and  the  sponsor  could  also  not  exclude  a  causal  association.    The  subject  did  not 
experience  any  further  episodes  of  palpitation,  and  Holter  monitoring  at  the  final  follow  up  visit 
showed no ventricular ectopic beats.   
Arrhythmia’s have been observed previously in the voriconazole programme, in particular associated 
with the intravenous formulation. From the description of the present cases it seems the relation with 
the voriconazole suspension is remote or unlikely. Currently a type II variation has been adopted for 
the  tablets  and  IV  solution  to  add  QT  interval  prolongation  to  section  4.8.  Therefore,  “torsade  de 
pointes,  QT  interval  prolongation”  are  added  in  the  Vfend  POS  SPC  as  rare  adverse  events  in 
section 4.8. 
Laboratory findings 
Overall, the rate of laboratory abnormalities was low for all formulations of the POS and for the tablet 
formulation.    Only  one  abnormality,  raised  alanine  transaminase  (ALT)  led  to  discontinuation  of 
dosing for one subject receiving tablets. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
A total of seven subjects discontinued from the three studies. Two subjects discontinued due to safety 
reasons.  A  female  subject  was  discontinued  because  she  experienced  ventricular  extrasystoles  (see 
serious adverse events).  A male subject from Study A1501028 was discontinued on Day 5 of his first 
dosing  period  (commercial  tablet  formulation)  due  to  raised  ALT,  which  was  considered  to  have 
resolved  after  discontinuation  of  dosing.    The  other  five  discontinued  due  to  reasons  unrelated  to 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
safety (two subjects due to protocol violation, two subjects were no longer willing to participate and 
one subject had to leave the country due to family emergency). 
Post-marketing experience 
In  addition  to  the  three  equivalence  studies  completed  for  the  POS  formulation,  the  applicant  has 
submitted postmarketing data for the tablet formulation.  
These data consist of the first periodic safety update report (PSUR) for VFEND tablet and powder 
for solution for infusion. The PSUR covered the period from 1 March 2002 to 31 August 2002. The 
assessment  report  from  the  rapporteur  circulated  in  January  2003  and  was  adopted  at  the  January 
meeting of the CPMP. 
It  is  estimated  that  875  patients  received  voriconazole  in  clinical  trials  during  the  reporting  period 
Using  unit  sales  trends  and  average  days  of  therapy  trends  from  the  2002  voriconazole  Baseline 
Launch Tracking Study (July 2002), an estimated 2,147 patients were exposed to all formulations of 
voriconazole during the reporting period.  Some of these patients may have been exposed to both the 
oral and intravenous formulations.  There were 21 voriconazole cases (containing 53 events) included 
in  the  PSUR,  nineteen  of  which  were  classified  as  serious.  The  safety  experience  with  all  cases 
indicated  that  most  of  the  frequently  reported  events  were  labelled  or  were  label  compatible.  
Approximately  one-half  of  the  total  events  were  contained  in  four  body  systems  (body  as  a  whole, 
gastrointestinal, liver/biliary and skin/appendages).  Based on a review of these cases, no changes to 
the core data sheet were necessary. 
Discussion on clinical safety 
In the three bioequivalence studies, the treatment related adverse events occurring in ≥10% of subjects 
receiving  oral  suspension  (powder  for  oral  suspension:  POS)  were  abnormal  vision,  headache, 
photophobia,  taste  perversion,  dizziness  and  abnormal  dreams.  Although  the  safety  profile  of  both 
products (POS and tablets) was consistent with the known safety profile of voriconazole the frequency 
of adverse events was higher in these three trials compared to previous submitted trials. This was most 
likely caused by a difference in reporting rate that in an actual difference. The overall safety profile 
of POS appeared comparable to the tablets. However, several events occurred more frequently with 
the  POS  compared  to  the  tablet:  taste  perversion,  palpitations,  dizziness,  insomnia,  gastrointestinal 
disorders  and  nausea.  14%  of  the  subjects  receiving  POS  reported  taste  perversion,  while  it  was 
reported by none of the subjects receiving tablets. As taste perversions appeared to be an adverse 
event  obviously  related  to  the  oral  suspension,  it  is  mentioned  in  the  SPC  (section  4.8). 
Three female  subjects  experienced  palpitations  during  POS  dosing,  and  one  of  these  subjects  also 
experienced  ventricular  extrasystoles.  Arrhythmia’s  have  been  observed  previously 
the 
voriconazole  programme,  in  particular  associated  with  the  intravenous  formulation.  From  the 
description  of  the  present  cases  it  seems  the  relation  with  the  voriconazole  suspension  is  remote  or 
unlikely. CNS adverse events will be closely monitored in the subsequent PSURs. 
The suspension appeared to be bioequivalent to the tablet, because the oral tablet is already authorised 
for children aged 2 to 12 years and the suspension did not contain excipients, which could be harmful 
for children, the suspension can also be authorised for children aged 2 to 12 years. Furthermore, 
the applicant informed the rapporteur that it would provide a paediatric safety update using data from 
the two completed paediatric IV studies (150-249 and A1501007) which were already submitted with 
the  main  filing,  and  the  new  paediatric  IV  and  POS  study  (A150137)  when  this  study  is 
completed in the 3-4Q 2004.

OVERALL CONCLUSIONS, BENEFIT/RISK ASSESSMENT AND 
5. 
RECOMMENDATION 
5.1 
Quality 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
Viral  Safety  and  Batch  to  batch  consistency  has  been  documented  and  the  relevant  test  will  be 
performed according to the agreed specifications 
5.2 
Preclinical pharmacology and toxicology 
Overall, the primary pharmacokinetics studies provided adequate evidence that tablet and suspension 
are bioequivalent.  
Overall,  the  toxicology  programme  revealed  that  a  favorable  safety  profile  has  been  previously 
established for Vfend for the treatment of fungal infections. 
This information has been included in the SPC.  
5.3 
Efficacy 
The  bioequivalence  of  tablets  and  suspension  allows  concluding  on  the  efficacy  of  Vfend  for  the 
treatment of fungal infections. 
5.4 
Safety 
The overall safety profile of POS appeared comparable to the tablets. Because the oral tablet is already 
authorised for children aged 2 to 12 years and the suspension did not contain excipients, which could 
be harmful for children, the suspension can also be authorised for children aged 2 to 12 years. 
5.5 
Benefit/risk assessment 
Based  on  the  CPMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CPMP  considered  that  the 
benefit/risk  profile  of  Vfend  40  mg/ml  powder  for  oral  suspension  in  the  treatment  of  invasive 
aspergillosis,  treatment  of  fluconazole-resistant  serious  invasive  Candida  infections  (including  C. 
krusei) and treatment of serious fungal infections caused by Scedosporium spp. and Fusarium spp. was 
favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.

1.  Introduction  
On 11 December 2014, the MAH has submitted fifteen completed paediatric studies for EXJADE, in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. The 15 clinical study reports 
are issued from local studies with deferasirox that enrolled pediatric patients (defined as patients aged 
< 18 years):  four interventional and eleven observational studies.  
Responses to the list of questions of the updated assessment report are provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that the 15 local studies described in this assessment report are stand-alone studies. A 
line listing of all the concerned studies is annexed in section 2.3.1. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in studies 
Exjade is brand name for deferasirox presented as dispersible tablets in 3 doses strengths: 125, 250 
and 500mg. The investigational drug was available as tablets at dosage strengths of 125 mg, 250 mg 
and 500 mg.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The orally active, tridentate iron chelator deferasirox (company research code: ICL670) is the active 
ingredient in Exjade® dispersible tablets. Exjade is currently approved in over 100 countries. In the 
European Union, it was approved on 28-Aug-2006 for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to 
frequent blood transfusions (≥7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) in patients with beta 
thalassaemia major aged 6 years and older. 
EXJADE is also indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions when 
deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in the following patient groups: 
- in paediatric patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload due to frequent blood 
transfusions (≥7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) aged 2 to 5 years, 
- in adult and paediatric patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload due to 
infrequent blood transfusions (<7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) aged 2 years and 
older, 
- in paediatric patients with other anaemias aged 2 years and older. 
Since 20 December 2012, Exjade has been also indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload 
requiring chelation therapy when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in patients 10 
years and older with non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes. 
The MAH submitted the final reports for the fifteen clinical studies (4 interventional and 11 
observational studies) and a clinical overview of these studies.  
These 15 studies were performed for multiple purposes, for example to better characterize the 
prevalence and the magnitude of iron overload in a specific country or a region, or to confirm the

2.3.2.  Clinical studies 
CHMP’s comment 
As a general comment, the investigation of paediatric use was not a primary objective of these studies 
and the majority of them did not analyze the paediatric patients separately. 
Various parameters were used in the interventional or non-interventional studies to measure efficacy, 
such as change from baseline in regular time intervals in cardiac iron overload (by using myocardial 
MRI T2*), cardiac function endpoints (LVEF), liver iron concentration (by using liver MRI T2*), serum 
ferritin, transferrin saturation. These are acceptable variables. Of note, 2 studies did not report any 
efficacy information (CICL670ABR01 and CICL670ATR01). 
As a reminder, these clinical study reports were submitted in the context of article 46 of Regulation 
(EC) No1901/2006, as amended, on medicinal products for paediatric use.  
Therefore, the lack of a clear description of patient exposure and dose interruption data   by age group 
in order to compare paediatric and adult population renders difficult an assessment of the benefit risk 
for the pediatric population. 
2.3.2.1. Interventional studies 
2.3.2.1.1. Study number CICL670AAU01: A study of Magnetic Resonance Imaging Assessment of 
Cardiac and Liver Iron Load in patients with Haemoglobinopathies, Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) 
or other anaemias treated with Exjade® (deferasirox) - The MILE Study 
Description 
Two-cohort single arm open label study over a 53 week period, to evaluate the change in cardiac iron 
load measured by MRI T2* sequence technique. This study was performed in Australia. 
Period of study: 28-Nov-2007 (First patient enrolled) to 08-Sep-2011 (Last patient completed).   
Methods 
Objectives  
Primary objectives of this trial are to evaluate the change in cardiac iron load and cardiac ejection 
fraction by MRI after 53 weeks of Exjade treatment in the following: 
• Transfused patients with haemoglobinopathies (thalassaemia-major and SCD) and a serum ferritin of 
> 500 µg/L. 
• Myelodysplasic Syndrome (MDS) and other rare anaemias (e.g. Myeloproliferative Disease (MPD), 
Diamond-blackfan anaemia [DBA]) patients who demonstrate evidence of transfusional iron overload 
by a serum ferritin of > 1,000 µg/L. 
Primary Endpoints 
The primary endpoint, change in cardiac iron load from baseline to 53 weeks, was defined as the log 
ratio of cardiac T2* at 53 weeks to baseline, ln (T2*53/T2*0). 
Secondary objectives of this trial are to evaluate the following: 
• Change in LVEF values, left ventricular volume and mass measured by cardiac MRI from baseline 
values after 53 weeks of Exjade treatment.

• Change in cardiac T2* from baseline to 53 weeks in the MDS and other anaemias subgroup, 
compared to the thalassaemia subgroup. 
• Changes in serum ferritin from baseline values to 53 weeks. 
• Changes in Liver Iron Concentration (LIC) by MRI of the Proton Transverse Relaxation Rate (R2-MRI) 
from baseline values to 53 weeks. 
• The relationship between the dosing regimen of Exjade and changes in cardiac T2* and LIC R2 MRI. 
• Change in Blood Magnetic Susceptibility Blood magnetic susceptibility (BMS), from baseline to 53 
weeks of Exjade.  
• The safety and tolerability of Exjade therapy from baseline to 53 weeks. 
Secondary Endpoints 
• Left ventricular size and function 
• serum ferritin, liver iron concentration, blood magnetic susceptibility, ALT,AST and serum creatinine. 
Study design 
Safety and tolerability of Exjade in the study population were captured at the clinic visits by 
assessments which consisted of collecting all AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), with their severity 
and relationship to study drug, and pregnancies. They included the regular monitoring of haematology, 
blood chemistry and urine performed at (study centre / central laboratory), electrocardiograms (ECGs), 
echocardiograms, regular assessments of vital signs, physical condition and body weight and 
documentation of concomitant medications/therapies. The Study Management Committee also 
reviewed the safety data regularly. 
Study population /Sample size 
The study population consisted of 53 patients with transfusional iron overload enrolled in two cohorts, 
of patients with either  haemoglobinopathy (thalassaemia-major or SCD) or other inherited or acquired 
anaemia (MDS, MPD, DBA and other rare anaemias) who required regular blood cell transfusions. The 
originally planned sample size of 120-150 was revised after a planned interim analysis. 
Overall, patients had a mean age of 36.3 years, and most patients were female (60.4%) and 
Caucasian (67.9%). The remaining patients were classified as Oriental (17.0%) or Other (15.1%). 
Proportions of patients in terms of gender and race for the 2 largest groups, patients with thalassemia 
major/SCD (n=42) or MDS/anaemia (n=9), were similar.

Changes in planned analysis 
During the course of the study, analyses were undertaken for three conferences. For these 
presentations, it was required to create four cohorts, rather than the original two. Although the 
protocol planned to recruit patients into two cohorts, each with various disease substates, the 
expectation was that there would be multiple patients within each of the disease substates providing a 
homogenous estimate of treatment effect for each of the two planned cohorts. However, at the end of 
recruitment there were two patients, one DBA and one bone marrow transplantation (BMT), who, if 
included in the corresponding main cohort would severely distort the estimates of treatment effect. It 
was determined for clinical reasons that these two patients would remain in their own single patient 
cohorts. 
Treatments 
Exjade was supplied as 125 mg, 250 mg and 500 mg tablets which were dispersed.  
For  patients  who  were  not  receiving  Exjade  prior  to  study  entry,  the  recommended  initial  daily  dose 
was 20 mg/kg/day. A starting dose at 30 mg/kg/day could be allowed for some patients, depending on 
the therapeutic goals or transfusional iron intake.  Initial dose of 10 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks (followed 
by 20 mg/kg/day) was allowed in order to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal disturbances, especially in 
the elderly. 
Patients  were  allowed  to  enter  the  study  if  already  receiving  Exjade  at  doses  ranging  from  20  to  40 
mg/kg/day.  For  patients  who  were  receiving  Exjade  prior  to  study  entry  and  were  not  adequately 
controlled with doses of 30 mg/kg (e.g. serum ferritin levels persistently above 2500 μg/L for at least 3 
months and not showing a decreasing trend over time), escalation to 40 mg/kg could be considered at 
study  entry.  Patients  experiencing  AEs  due  to  Exjade  treatment  were  permitted  dose  adjustments  in 
order  to  continue  on  the  drug.  These  dose  adjustments  could  be  interruptions  in  dosing  and/or 
reductions  in  the  dose  being  administered.  Refer  to  the  study  protocol  for  the  guidelines  for  dose 
reductions and delays. Doses above 40 mg/kg/day were not allowed in this study. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Protocol Deviations were detected during the first 30 months of the study (total = 28; low starting 
dose = 14; concomitant illnesses = 12; lab value out of range at enrolment = 1; concomitant use 
ofinvestigational drug = 1).

Statistical Methods 
All analyses were planned to be performed for all subjects in the full analysis population, irrespective of 
the disease state and were to be repeated by patient cohort (transfused patients with 
haemoglobinopathies and other anaemias). Descriptive statistics (for continuous variables, namely n, 
mean, median, minimum, maximum and SD) or frequencies and percentages (for categorical 
variables) were planned to be presented by visit for all efficacy and safety variables assessed in this 
study (except AEs). AEs were planned to be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) and summarized by system organ class and also by preferred term as then 
number (and percentage) of patients experiencing at least one event in each category during the 
study. 
A detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) was prepared prior to inspection of any data by the 
biostatistician and prior to database lock in which all aspects of data analysis were defined in detail. 
Safety population 
All patients who received at least one dose of study drug were included in the safety population. The 
safety population were used to produce all listings, summaries and analyses of safety data.

Safety results (safety population) 
Forty-seven (88.7%) patients in the Safety population experienced at least one treatment-
emergent AE during the study and nine (17.0%) patients reported serious AEs. Three 
(5.7%) patients discontinued the study because of AEs. 
A total of 284 treatment-emergent AEs were recorded throughout the study period, 77 of which were 
considered treatment related. Fourteen of the AEs were recorded as serious (in 9 patients), 12 
were recorded as severe serious AEs, 7 were severe nonserious AEs and 4 AEs resulted in permanent 
discontinuation of the study drug (in 4 patients). 
The most common preferred terms (≥ 10%) included diarrhoea in 15 (28.3%), patients, upper 
respiratory tract infection in 14 (26.4%) patients, nausea in 11 (20.8%), patients, blood creatinine 
increased in 11 (20.8%) patients, abdominal pain in 8 (15.1%), patients, ALT increased in 8 (15.1%) 
patients, back pain in 7 (13.2%) patients, abdominal pain upper in 6 (11.3%) patients, and urinary 
tract infection in 6 (11.3%), patients. Rates of treatment-emergent AEs by patient group were 88.1% 
in patients with, thalassemia major/SCD, 100% in patients with MDS/anaemia or Bone marrow 
transplantation (BMT), and none in the 1 patient with Diamond-blackfan anaemia (DBA).

The most common treatment-emergent AEs in terms of System Organ Class were  gastrointestinal 
disorders in 34 (64.2%) patients, infections and infestations in 33 (62.3%) patients, investigations in 
21 (39.6%) patients, general disorders and administrative site conditions in 14 (26.4%) patients, 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders in 12 (22.6%) patients, and respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorders in 11 (20.8%) patients. 
There were 6 treatment-related treatment-emergent AEs that occurred in ≥ 5% of patients overall. 
These were diarrhoea in 14 patients (26.4%), nausea in 8 patients (15.1%), blood creatinine increased 
in 8 patients (15.1%), rash in 4 patients (7.5%), abdominal pain in 3 patients (5.7%), and vomiting in 
3 patients (5.7%). 
The majority of AEs were mild, with 88.7% of patients experiencing mild, 49.1% experiencing 
moderate, and 15.1% experiencing severe AEs. No severe AEs occurred in more than 2 patients 
(3.8%), and the only severe AE occurring in 2 patients was diarrhoea. One moderate AE (diarrhoea) 
occurred in 6 patients (11.3%), and no other moderate AE occurred in more than 3 patients (5.7%). 
These moderate and severe events of diarrhoea were considered to be related to study treatment. 
Seven patients (13.2%) experienced SAEs. Of these patients, 4 had thalassemia major/SCD and 3 had 
MDS/anaemia. No SAE occurred in more than 1 patient. SAEs included diarrhoea, rectal haemorrhage, 
vomiting, chest pain, pyrexia, sickle cell anaemia with crisis, lobar pneumonia, neutropenic sepsis, 
wrist fracture, bone pain, musculoskeletal pain, mania, and renal colic. Diarrhoea and vomiting 
were the only SAEs considered related to treatment.

Discussion on clinical aspects 
In this study ten patients discontinued  prematurely; 4 withdrew due to AEs (2 AEs of diarrhoea and 2 
AEs of blood creatinine increased), 3 due to protocol violations, 2 due to withdrawal of consent, and 1 
due to lack of efficacy. Seven patients experienced SAEs during the study (diarrhoea, rectal  
haemorrhage, vomiting, chest pain, pyrexia, sickle cell anaemia with crisis, lobar pneumonia, 
neutropenic sepsis, wrist fracture, bone pain, musculoskeletal pain, mania, and renal colic; all n=1 
event each). All patients had a complete recovery from those events. Two of the cases had suspected 
relationship to study drug (diarrhoea and vomiting). 
No statistically significant changes were seen over time in serum creatinine and AST levels for the 
overall patient population, nor when patients were stratified by subgroup (haemoglobinopathy/MDS). 
ALT was the only parameter that showed a statistically significant change over time (i.e. reduction), 
and that was limited to the MDS subgroup (p=0.01). 
The change in safety markers for patients receiving a mean dose of Exjade >30mg/kg/day did not 
show statistical difference when End of Study values were compared with baseline (p=0.4, 0.2 and 0.7 
for serum creatinine, ALT and AST respectively; results extracted from the statistical model based on 
the overall patient population). 
CHMP's comments:  
Change in cardiac iron load from baseline to end of study was provided for the overall population 
(pediatric and adult). 
No specific analyses of the efficacy in paediatric patients have been conducted.  
The assessment of drug safety was only a secondary objective in this study. Initially the 
patients<18years old were not included in this study but with an amendment, 5 patients ≥16 years 
old were included but the safety data are presented globally, without details on the pediatric patients. 
Research in the line listing find 5 patients <18 years old: 1 adolescent with beta thalassemia, 1 
adolescent with thalassemia Major, 1 adolescent with thalassemia Major, 1 adolescent with SCD and 1 
adolescent with DBA. All of them received Deferasirox before entry in this study. Research in the 
adverse event listing find 4 drug related adverse events for these patients: 1 gastrointestinal disorder 
(vomiting), 2 renal and urinary disorders (hematuria) and 1 musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorder (back pain). All of these DRAE are mild. 
2.3.2.1.2. Study number CICL670ABR03: Deferasirox for the treatment of transfusional iron 
overload in sickle cell anemia: a 2-year prospective study 
Description:  An open-label, non-comparative trial Phase IV with deferasirox in patients with SCD and 
transfusional iron overload was carried out in one center in Brazil.

Period of study: 24/08/2007 (First patient enrolled) to 15/08/2008 (Last patient completed)   
Methods 
Objectives: Objectives of this trial were  to evaluate the iron overload status, before and after two 
year-treatment with deferasirox, using liver iron concentration by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
hepatic, MRI cardiac (Cardiac T2*, ms), serum ferritin (SF, μg/L), and to evaluate the safety and 
tolerability of deferasirox. Safety was evaluated on a monthly basis according to the incidence and type 
of adverse events and measurement of laboratory parameters, including serum creatinine and liver 
enzyme levels. 
Study design: This trial was a unicenter, prospective, non-randomized, open-label phase IV study of 1 
year duration in Brazil. 
Study population /Sample size:  Male and female patients aged >2 years with SCD and 
transfusional iron overload were enrolled. Iron overload was defined as the use of ≥ 20 units of RBC 
units and/or SF levels ≥ 1000 μg/L confirmed by ≥ measurements during the previous 6 months of 
enrollment. Patients with active hepatits B and C were excluded from participating in this study. 
31 pediatric (age >2y) and adult (age < 65y) patients with SCD and iron overload were enrolled. 13 
patients <20 years old (In Table 1 Patient demographic and selected clinical parameters). 
Treatments 
All eligible patients who had been previously treated with deferoxamine discontinued this drug and 
entered a 7-day washout period. All patients, regardless of their baseline LIC, commenced deferasirox 
at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day. Dose adjustments of 5-10 mg/kg/day (range of 5 g/kg/day up to 30 
mg/kg/day), which were possible only after 12 weeks of study treatment, were done every 3 months if 
necessary.  
The dose of deferasirox was reduced by one dose level and not re-escalated for patients 15 years of 
age and older if serum creatinine increased >33% above  baseline on two consecutive occasions. 
Deferasirox was interrupted for moderate or severe skin rash and reinstituted at half the initial dose, 
and dose reescalation was permitted. Treatment was continued for 2 years and was only interrupted at 
the discretion of the investigator for intercurrent illness or adverse events.

Outcomes/endpoints 
The main efficacy endpoint were the change in LIC and serum ferritin from baseline assessed at 2-yr 
period. The assessment of safety was based mainly on the frequency of adverse events and on the 
number of laboratory values that fell outside the predetermined ranges.  
Statistical Methods 
Testing for statistics significance for differences between baseline and end-of-study for each treatment 
group was performed using Student’s t-test. Using a two-sided test, P-values <0.05 were considered 
to be statistically significant. 
Results 
A total of 31 pediatric (age >2y) and adult (age < 65y) patients with SCD and iron overload, defined 
as the use of ≥ 20 units of RBC units and/or two SF levels ≥ 1000 μg/L during the 6 months preceding 
enrollment, received starting dose of 20mg/kg/day of deferasirox. Two patients discontinued treatment 
at 8 and 9 months, due to pregnancy and moving to other city, respectively. One patient died at 18 
months due to pulmonary infection and hemorrhagic stroke. Deferasirox was interrupted in 3 (10.3%) 
patients due to confirmed serum ferritin levels <500 μg/L. Twenty-five patients completed 2-year 
treatment. Mean ± SD and median (range) age 26.9 ± 12.5y and 25.0y (9-49), <20 years 13 patients 
41.9% 20 to 30 8 patients 25.8%. 
Efficacy results  
No specific analyses of the efficacy in paediatric patients have been conducted. 
Reduction in body iron in SCD patients from a BL mean SF of 2344.5 ng/ml to 2113 ng/ml at 12 
months and 1986.3 ng/ml at 24 months. 
Safety results (safety population) 
The most common drug-related Adverse Events were mild, transient diarrhea (7 patients), headache 
(7 patients), nausea (5 patients) and vomiting (3 patients). Maculo-papular skin rash and serum 
creatinine increases upper limit of normal were observed in 2 (6.5%) patients. Three patients (9.5%) 
had two consecutive increases in serum creatinine that were both >33% above baseline and above the 
upper limit of normal (ULN); there were no progressive increases. This adverse event occurred 
most frequently in those patients older than 25 years of age and all of them responded to dose 
reduction with stabilization or normalization of this parameter. Two patients (6.5%) experience two 
consecutive serum creatinine increases >33% above baseline that exceeded the (ULN), never ≥ 2 
times the ULN. No patient experienced progressive increases in serum creatinine or renal failure. In 
both these individuals, deferasirox was interrupted and, after normalization of the serum creatinine 
level that occurred in both patients the drug was rechallenged without recurrence of the creatinine 
increase. Reversible increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were seen in 2 (6.5%) patients. No 
patient experience ALT levels >3x ULN. Reversible increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were 
seen in 2 (6.5%) patients. No patient experience ALT levels >3x ULN.

Discussion on clinical aspects 
According to the MAH, this trial confirms that deferasirox is effective in reducing body iron burden in 
transfused patients with SCD, well tolerated in pediatric and adult patients and with a clinically 
manageable safety profile. Over 2 years of deferasirox treatment showed no evidence of progressive 
increases in serum creatinine in patients with SCA, who have tendency to develop progressive renal 
disease. No severe adverse event occurred in this study.  
CHMP's comments:  
The mean reduction SF is provided for the overall population (ie pediatric and adult). No specific 
analyses of the efficacy in paediatric patients have been conducted.  
In this trial, pediatric population >2 years old was included but the number of children in this study is 
not clear. The adverse events are not distributed by age but seems to be more frequent in the oldest 
patients >25 years. 
2.3.2.1.3. Study number CICL670ARU01: Open-label multi-center study of Exjade (deferasirox) for 
treatment of transfusional iron overload in MDS, thalassemia and other anemia patients. 
Description:  Open-label  multi-center  prospective  non  randomized  study.  Reference  therapy  was  not 
used.

1. Assess the clinical implications of post-transfusion iron overload in the patients suffering from 
Myelodysplastic syndrome, thalassemia, and other kinds of anemia 
2. Assess the target lesions when there is an occurrence of evident post-transfusion iron overload 
3. Assess acceptability/safety of Exjade by observing the patients suffering from the post transfusion 
iron overload; 
Study design: Open-label multicenter non randomized study 
Study population/sample size: Adult patients suffering from Myelodysplastic Syndrome (presenting 
with low or intermediate-1 IPSS risk) and patients aged >2 y.o with thalassemia or rare anemias 
(Diamond-Blackfan anemia, Fanconi’s anemia, Sideroblastic anemia, Red cell aplasia). A target patient 
group consisting of 120 people was formed. 
Treatments: All the patients participating in the investigation were prescribed Exjade® (deferasirox). 
A combination of dispersible tablets 125, 250 and 500mg was used to adjust the dosage. Patients got 
the drug in the initial dosage depending on the extent of iron overload and transfusion therapy: 
•  30 mg/kg/ day provided that the Ferritin level >2500 μg/l and more than 4 transfusions of a 
donor erythrocytes is received per month 
•  10 mg/kg/day provided that the Ferritin level <1500 μg/l and less than 2 transfusions of a 
donor erythrocytes is received per month 
•  20 mg/kg/day in other cases 
The treatment was administered as recommended by the marketing authorization. The treatment 
duration was 12 months. 
Outcomes/endpoints for safety assessment:  
Safety assessment was carried out by means of monitoring and registration of all the adverse events 
and serious adverse events (SAE) (together with assessment of severity level and relation to the study 
drug intake), cardiac function assessment, regular clinical and  biochemical blood and urine analyses, 
vital signs assessment and physical examination including weight measurements and functional class 
determination. 
Regular monitoring of clinical and biochemical blood and urine analyses, creatinine clearance, 
procedures to assess cardiac function (ECG, Echo-CG), US of the abdominal cavity organs, an optician 
and an ENT doctor examination, audiogram were all conducted in the local laboratories of the research 
centers. 
All the SAEs, AEs, the results of the cardiac function assessment, as well as all the results of laboratory 
tests were registered in the patients’ case report forms (CRF). 
Statistical methods: For evaluation of safety parameters, taking into consideration the non-
comparative nature of the investigation, the frequency of AEs is presented in a descriptive way, and 
the analysis of variance (ANOVA) is applied to the results of biochemical analysis. 
Results: 
Recruitment/Number analyzed: 111 patients were recruited for the investigation, 3 were excluded 
for protocol violations, then 108 were analyzed.

Baseline data: All the patients were divided into a group of adults (>18 y.o.), a group of adolescents 
(from 13 to 17 y.o.) and a group of children (from 2 to 12 y.o.). The teenage group was 13 patients; 
children-30 patients. 
• 
In children from 2 to 12 years old, there were 13 boys and 17 girls, and the median of age was 
6 years old. The primary diagnosis was Beta-thalassemia (15 patients), Diamond-Blackfan 
anemia (8 patients), genetic megalocytic hemolytic anemia (1), Fanconi's anemia (1), 
myelodysplastic syndrome (1), genetic dyserythropoietic anemia (1), pure red cell aplasia (1), 
acquired aplastic anemia (1) and hemolytic anemia with  abnormal HbC (1). While the children 
group anamnesis data was being analyzed, it was made clear that 20 out of 30 children had 
already been taking chelating therapy. Most of them had been taking Desferal®-14 (46,7%) 
and  6 (20%) children had been taking Exjade®. 
• 
In adolescents (from 13 to 17 years old), there were 4 boys and 9 girls, with an average age of 
15 years old. The principal diagnosis was: Beta-thalassemia (4 patients), Diamond-Blackfan 
anemia (3 patients), genetic megalocytic hemolytic anemia (2), Fanconi's anemia (1), 
myelodysplastic syndrome (1), hemoglobinopathiy (1), genetic hemolytic anemia (1). 10 
(77%) out of 13 patients had been taking chelating therapy. 6(46%) patients had been taking 
Desferal®, 3 patients had been taking Exjade® and the last deferiprone.  
The initial dose of Exjade, the patient exposure duration were not presented by age groups. 
Efficacy results 
No specific analyses of the efficacy in paediatric patients have been conducted. 
Reduction in mean SF was reported for all patients from BL of 3837.2 ng/ml to 2269.2ng/ml at 12 
months. 
Safety results 
1.  Overall experience of adverse events: Data of 108 patients were used to conduct the 
statistical analysis. Adverse events were recorded with 85 patients (78.5%). 219 cases of 
adverse events development were detected with these patients. 23 (10.5%) cases of AEs were 
referred to as serious. The most frequent reasons for AEs development were the 
gastrointestinal tract disorders-35 cases (16%) and different infections-35 cases (16%). 23 
(10.5%) cases of AEs developed as a result of a general disorder and laboratory data 
deviations. Less frequent were the blood and lymphatic system disorders 22 cases (10%).

The most frequent laboratory and clinical AEs against the background of the drug intake were the 
increase in transaminase level, hyperbilirubinemia-17 cases (7.8%), urinary tracts infections- 11 cases 
(5%), influenza symptoms appearance-11 cases (5%), sicchasia-9 cases (4.1%). The most frequent 
adverse events appearing against the background of Exjade treatment are gastrointestinal tract 
disorders (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, pain in the stomach), hives sometimes together with liver 
transaminase rise, creatinine level in blood serum rise. The most of the adverse events are dosage 
connected. 
2.  Deaths, other serious and significant adverse events: Clinically relevant AEs were 
considered those which demanded the reduction of the investigational drug dosage or 
temporary/permanent discontinuation of the treatment. 23 (10.5%) cases AEs were considered 
serious, among them 10 (4.6%) cases resulted in death. Not a single fatal case of AEs 
development was connected with the investigational drug intake. The cause of deaths was  :  
•  myelodysplastic syndrome progression (3 cases).  
• 
• 
• 
• 
transformation of myelodysplastic syndrome into acute leukemia with thrombocytopenia (1 
case). This patient had experienced 2 significant AEs. One of them was erythema multiform 
of the 4th severity degree. The researcher deduced the connection between this AE and the 
study drug intake. This led to the Exjade therapy discontinuation and supplementary drug-
induced therapy. 
progression of a unspecified oncological disease (1). This patient had experienced one AE-
proteinuria of the first severity degree according to NCI CTC scale. This AE was not 
significant and didn’t demand the study drug modification or supplementary drug-induced 
therapy.

temporary/constant discontinuation of its intake or supplementary therapy. In two cases (0.9%) 
researches made a decision to discontinue the patient's participation in the trial due to SAE 
development. Only in 1 case the patient discontinued the participation in the trial due to the clinically 
significant AE. The allergic reaction to the study drug which firstly resulted in the dose reduction but 
then led to complete termination of its use occurred only with 1 patient.

3.  Laboratory values: The analysis of the peripheral blood data the statistically relevant 
differences weren’t discovered. The basic biochemical blood variables (ALT, AST, bilirubin, 
creatinine, glucose) were monitored as safety criteria on Visits. When conducting the analysis 
of variances (ANOVA) the statistically relevant variables weren’t detected, except ALT level 
decrease. One of the reasons can be the patients with hepatic malfunction discontinued the 
participation in the study. 
4.  Vital signs: During the examinations weight, blood pressure, Respiration rate, Heart rate 
levels, temperature were measured. During the investigation and statistical analysis 
meaningful differences weren’t detected. 
5.  Other safety evaluations: At the beginning and at the end of the investigational drug intake 
all the patients had the following instrumental tests conducted: X-ray examination of thoracic 
cage organs, US of abdominal cavity organs, ECG, EchoCG, audiographics. All the patients 
were examined by an optician and an ENT specialist on Visit 0 and Visit12. Clinically significant 
differences in the results weren’t detected. 
CHMP's comments:  
The mean reduction SF is provided for the overall population (ie pediatric and adult). No specific 
analyses of the efficacy in paediatric patients have been conducted. 
The assessment of drug safety was only a secondary objective in this study. Patients were divided into 
age groups (adults, adolescents and children) but the safety data are presented globally, without 
details on the pediatric patients. Adverse events were not differentiated from adverse drug reactions 
(ADR). We noticed that among the serious adverse events, the drug was interrupted in two cases of 
toxic hepatitis and a causal relationship was retained for these two cases; but we don't know 
whether these cases involved children or not.

Study design 
Thirty patients with abnormal T2, but normal cardiac function were to be enrolled into an open-label, 
single-arm pilot trial. The screening period was to last up to 4 weeks. All patients were to initiate 
treatment with 30 mg/kg/day deferasirox for 77 weeks in the core study. Patients whose T2* had 
improved over the 18 months on the core study, but had not yet reached 20ms, may have continued 
on a 6-month extension phase. 
Study population /Sample size 
The total number of patients planned for this study was 30. The total number of patients recruited was 
28. There were 28 patients in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population and 27 patients in the safety 
population. There were 22 patients in the completer population. Eleven of these patients formally 
continued in the extension phase (PT-Table 14.1-1.1). One patient enrolled in the extension phase 
discontinued participation early due to a withdrawn consent. 
Demographic and background characteristics: 
The mean (± SD) patient age was 22.6 (± 8.67) years, ranging from 10 to 44 years. Five patients 
were aged 10 to <16 years (17.9%). 
Treatments 
Dispersible tablets of the investigational agent, deferasirox were to be supplied in dosage strengths of 
125mg, 250mg and 500mg per tablet. The starting dose chosen for all patients in this study was 
30mg/kg/day. Patients who were currently on > 30 mg/kg/day of deferasirox could have continued on 
their pre-existing dose at study entry. Previous experience with deferasirox has shown that net 
negative iron excretion can occur at doses of 20 to 30 mg/kg/day. The mean dose of deferasirox taken 
over the 77 and 101-week (extension phase patients only) study periods was 30.87 mg/kg/day and 
34.77 mg/kg/day, respectively. 
• For daily doses of 1 to 3 g, the tablets should have been dispersed. Concomitant therapy with any 
other iron chelator was not allowed. All 27 patients indicated that they had been exposed to an iron 
chelating agent prior to the start of study drug; 26 patients (96.3%) had taken deferasirox mesilate 
before initiation of study treatment  
Patients may have been withdrawn from the study prematurely for one of the following reasons : 
adverse event(s), abnormal laboratory value(s), abnormal test procedure result(s), unsatisfactory 
therapeutic effect, condition no longer requires treatment, protocol violation, subject withdrew 
consent, lost to follow-up, administrative problems, and death. 
Any patient who discontinued study drug but refused to return for an end of study visit, must have 
been contacted for safety evaluations during the 4 weeks following the last dose of study drug. 
In patients who developed a skin rash, the following dose adjustments should have been followed.

Recruitment/ Number analysed 
There were 22 patients in the completer population. Eleven of these patients formally continued in the 
extension phase.  
Of note, patients aged >10 years-old could be enrolled in this study.  The definition of the term 
‘pediatric’ for enrollment and study conduct was in accordance with local legislation. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was change in liver iron concentration at one year as assessed by liver 
biopsy. 
Statistical Methods 
Data were summarized with respect to demographic and baseline characteristics, efficacy observations 
and measurements, drug exposure, and safety observations and measurements. Within group changes 
at each study visit versus baseline were tested using a Wilcoxon signed-rank statistic. This statistic 
tested a null hypothesis that the change from baseline was equal to 0. 
Results 
Efficacy results 
No specific analyses of the efficacy in paediatric patients have been conducted. 
There is an increase in cardiac MRI T2* from 9.92 msec at BL by 1.7 msec at week 25, 2.01 ms at 
week 49, and 2.18 msec at week 77.

Deaths, other serious adverse events and other significant adverse events 
Of the 27 patients initiating treatment with deferasirox, 17 (63.0%) experienced at least one serious or 
significant AE. This total was comprised primarily by the number patients for whom an AE lead to a 
dose adjustment or temporary interruption of deferasirox (13/27, 48.1%). Eight patients (29.6%) 
experienced at least one non-fatal SAE, and 3 patients (11.8%) discontinued study drug permanently 
due to an AE of any type. Two patients discontinued because of adverse events (abnormal laboratory 
values and adverse events, including those of a serious nature) and ultimately died.

Two patient deaths occurred following withdrawal from the trial due to SAEs. One patient died due to 
congestive heart failure, and the other patient’s death was secondary to multi-organ failure. These 
deaths, including the antecedent AEs, were not assessed as related to study drug. 
Serious adverse events 
Eight patients (29.6%) experienced one or more SAEs and include pyrexia (18.5%), abdominal pain 
(14.8%), vomiting (11.1%), dehydration (7.4%), and hypotension (7.4%).

While no patient discontinued the study due to death, two patients expired as a result of serious 
adverse events. The SAE leading to study drug discontinuation was not suspected as being related to 
deferasirox. Eight patients (29.6%) experienced SAEs, but only 1 patient (3.7%) had one or more 
SAEs considered by the investigator to be study drug-related. This patient had reported a 
moderate, suspected increase in blood creatinine on Day 174. Study drug was discontinued on Day 
174 as well. He was hospitalized for heart failure apparently prior to this time (Day 162) and expired 
sometime on/after Day 174. The most frequent serious or significant adverse event was based on 
those occurrences leading to dose adjustments or temporary dose interruptions. This occurred in 
48.1% of the treated patients. 
Clinical laboratory evaluation 
1-  Hematology 
There were two events reported as blood and lymphatic system disorders. A severe episode of 
disseminated intravascular coagulation was observed and another report was made for a case of 
severe Thrombocytopenia. These events were not suspected as related to deferasirox. 
2 
Clinical chemistry 
AST 
Seventeen out of the 27 treated patients had Grade 0 (normal) AST values at baseline. Ten patients 
had Grade 1 toxicity post-baseline. Grade 2 post-baseline toxicity was seen in 5 patients. Three 
patients experienced Grade 3 toxicity post-baseline Of these Grade 3 toxicities, 2 patients had 
abnormal toxicity at baseline and 1 patient had a normal value. No Grade 4 toxicity was reported post-
baseline. Two patients reported an adverse event of increased AST: one case was moderate in severity 
and the other case was severe 
ALT 
Eight out of the 27 treated patients reported Grade 0 (normal) ALT values at baseline. Ten patients 
had Grade 1 toxicity post-baseline. Grade 2 post-baseline toxicity was seen in 6 patients. Five patients 
experienced Grade 3 or 4 toxicity post-baseline. Of these Grade 3/4 toxicities, all patients had 
abnormal (ie, not Grade 0) toxicity at baseline. An adverse event of increased ALT was reported by two 
patients. These episodes were moderate (n = 1) and severe (n = 1) in severity. 
Creatinine Clearance 
None of the 27 treated patients reported Grade 0 (normal) creatinine clearance values at baseline. 
Sixteen patients had Grade 1 toxicity post-baseline. Grade 2 post-baseline toxicity was seen in 10 
patients. One patient experienced Grade 3 toxicity post-baseline. This patient had an abnormal value 
at baseline. No Grade 4 toxicity was reported post-baseline. 
Creatinine 
Twenty five out of the 27 treated patients reported Grade 0 (normal) creatinine values at baseline. One 
patient had Grade 1 toxicity post-baseline. Grade 2 post-baseline toxicity was seen in 1 patient. No 
patient experienced a Grade 3 or 4 toxicity post-baseline. Three patients reported an adverse event of 
increased creatinine. Two of these cases were moderate in severity and one patient had a severe 
event. One of these AEs was reported as a SAE. 
Total Bilirubin

Four out of the 27 treated patients reported Grade 0 (normal) bilirubin values at baseline. Seven 
patients had Grade 1 toxicity post-baseline. Grade 2 post-baseline toxicity was seen in 10 patients. Six 
patients experienced Grade 3 toxicity post-baseline. Of these Grade 3 toxicities, all 6 patients had 
abnormal (ie, not Grade 0) values at baseline. No Grade 4 toxicity was reported post-baseline. 
Other Serum Chemistry Values 
Hyperglycemia was reported by three patients: 2 cases of moderate severity and 1 severe case. One of 
these events was reported as an SAE. 
Ocular examinations 
Ten (37.0%) out of 27 patients had a clinically significant abnormality at baseline. Twenty-six patients 
had missing data at the Week 77 assessment and thus, no inference could be made for this time point. 
This magnitude of missing data reflected the protocol requirement that the test was to be done 
postbaseline only if clinically indicated. 
Summary of safety results 
Of the 27 patients initiating treatment with deferasirox, 17 (63.0%) experienced at least one serious or 
significant AE. A total of 8 patients (29.6%) reported an SAE, of which only 1 patient had such an 
event suspected as being related to deferasirox. and 3 patients (11.8%) discontinued study drug 
permanently due to an AE of any type. Two patients discontinued because of adverse events 
(abnormal laboratory values and adverse events, including those of a serious nature) and ultimately 
died. The AEs leading to study drug discontinuation in these patients were judged not to be related to 
study drug. 
One patient reported two severe SAEs related to blood disorders: disseminated intravascular 
coagulation and thrombocytopenia. Both of these events were not suspected as related to study drug. 
Three of the most commonly reported AEs suspected as related to study drug were gastrointestinal in 
nature: nausea (25.9%), diarrhea (18.5%), and abdominal pain (11.1%). In addition, deferasirox-
related cases of increased serum creatinine levels were reported in 11.1% of the treated patients. 
Post-baseline Grade 3 and 4 laboratory toxicity was reported for a limited number of patients among 
four clinical chemistry laboratory parameters (AST, ALT, creatinine clearance, and total bilirubin). 
Laboratory SAEs were reported for increased creatinine (n=1) and hyperglycemia (n=1). Although a 
few laboratory parameters showed statistically significant changes from baseline at various study 
visits, none of these changes were of sufficient magnitude to warrant clinical concern. Four or fewer 
patients met critical threshold values for the majority of pre-specified safety alerts; the main alert 
noted was for patients experiencing at least one post-baseline value of AST or ALT >250 U/L. This 
occurred in 14.8% of the patients receiving study drug. A treatment-emergent occurrence of 
myocardial ischemia was seen for one patient. 
CHMP's comments:  
Change in cardiac overload measured by MRI T2* was provided for the overall population (pediatric

2.3.2.2.1. Study number CICL670A1401: Drug Use Observational Study Protocol on Exjade Tablet 
for suspension 
Description: 
This post-marketing surveillance study was performed in Japan between the market launch of Exjade 
in June 2008 and March 31, 2012 (to enroll patients who started treatment with Exjade no later than 
January 31, 2012) with two studies: 
• 
• 
EXJ-1-01: drug use observational study, all treated patients surveillance, with two follow up 
periods: from the start of treatment to 0.5 year with data recorded in the CRF01 and from 0.5 
to 1 year with data recorded in the CRF02. 
EXJ-2-01 : special drug use observational study 
Methods: 
• 
EXJ-1-01 
Objectives: to confirm the safety and efficacy under actual use conditions (All cases surveillance).  
Study design: drug use observational study after the market launch of Exjade in Japan (June 16, 
2008) 
Study period: 01-Apr 2011 to 31-Mar-2012 
Study population / Sample size:  The number of patients was calculated to detect eye disorder and 
hearing impaired: the target sample size was 1000 subjects. Approximately 3000 subjects had been 
enrolled approximately 3 years after market launch to ensure that the case report forms (less than 6 
months: CRF-01, from 0.5 to 1 year: CRF-02) would be collected from 1000 subjects. 
• 
EXJ-2-01 
Objectives: to confirm the safety and efficacy of long-term use under actual use conditions. 
The special drug use observational study (EXJ-2-01) is being conducted in subjects who have been 
treated with Exjade starting in the drug use observational study (EXJ-1-01).

Treatment: The daily dose of Exjade was 14.3 ± 5.38 mg/kg/day (mean ± S.D. n=2170), showing 
that a high percentage of subjects received a lower dose than the approved dose of 20 mg/kg/day. The 
duration of treatment ranged extremely widely (mean ± S.D., 192.1 ± 144.68 days, n=2454). Early 
discontinuation of treatment (less than 60 days from the initiation) was observed (27.33%), and long-
term treatment (360 days or longer) was also observed (22.51 %). 
Outcome : Description of adverse reactions (incidence, seriousness, timing, outcome and incidence by 
factor), Incidence of serious adverse reactions by factor, laboratory values, Adverse events of interest 
(renal impairment, hepatic impairment, gastrointestinal disorder, eye disorder, hearing impaired,

Case composition in the drug use observational study: 
A total of 3372 patients were enrolled, 2588 collected case report forms (CRF), but only CRF02 for 51 
patients (excluded), therefore 2537 CRF analyzed: 2 subjects who were not treated, 12 subjects who 
could not be assessed for adverse events, and 17 subjects who were enrolled more than once were 
excluded, and the remaining 2506 subjects were included in the safety analysis: 2506 CRF01 
and 1106 CRF02.

Number of children: Children aged under 15 years accounted for 1.60% of the population = 40 
patients, without information on the therapeutic indication. 
Efficacy results 
No specific analyses of the efficacy in paediatric patients have been conducted. 
In general, treatment with Exjade resulted in a reduction in mean ferritin levels, despite large 
variability (or wide S.D.). 
After treatment with Exjade, the ferritin levels decreased in subjects without transfusion, but slightly 
increased in those with transfusion. 
Safety results 
The incidence of adverse reactions was significantly lower in children aged under 15 years than in 
adults aged 15 years and older (22.50% versus 50.43%, p=0.0006). Furthermore, the incidence was 
the lowest at 28.07% in subjects aged under 20 years. 
For the serious adverse reactions: the incidence of serious adverse reactions significantly increased 
with age (p=0.0054). The incidence of serious adverse reactions was not increased in children: 2.50% 
in children less than 15 years and 11.56% for patients aged 15 years and older. The incidence of 
serious adverse reactions was at 3.51% in patients aged under 20 years. 
A total of 15 adverse reactions were reported in 9 of 40 children. These adverse reactions included 
diarrhea (4 cases), renal impairment (3), nausea (2), abdominal pain (2), liver disorder, ALT 
increased, AST increased, and blood creatinine increased (1 case each). The adverse reactions in 
children were renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and gastrointestinal disorder, which were also 
common in adults, with no specific adverse reaction in children. 
While the exact cause of the lower incidence of adverse reactions in children is unknown, it may be 
explained by their inability to express their subjective symptoms. 
The dose in children was 17.2 ± 6.40 mg/kg (mean ± S.D.) and slightly higher than the mean dose 
(14.3 mg/kg) in the entire population, but the dose was not correlated with the incidence of adverse 
reactions. The mean body weight was 22.6 kg in children and 54.2 kg in adults, indicating that the 
approximate daily dose was 388.72 and 755.06 mg, respectively. Therefore, the lower total daily 
exposure in children than in adults may have resulted in the lower incidence of adverse reactions in 
children even though the mean dose was slightly higher in children. 
The adverse events of interest (renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and gastrointestinal disorder, 
Eye disorder and hearing impaired, decreased blood cells and agranulocytosis, as well as 
hypersensitivity and leucocytoclastic vasculitis) were not shown by age. 
EXJ-2-01  
Recruitment/number analysed 
As of October 31, 2012, 583 subjects have been enrolled in the special drug use observational study 
following 1-year treatment in the drug use observational study (EXJ-1-01). CRFs were collected from 
155 of the 583 subjects. Of the 155 subjects from whom the CRFs were collected, 145 subjects were 
included in safety analysis, excluding a total of 10 subjects: 9 subjects excluded from safety 
analysis in the drug use observational study and 1 subject who could not be enrolled.

Data from 142 CRF-01 (second year), 53 CRF-02 (third year), and 1 CRF-03 (fourth year) 
were tabulated. 
Number of children: 1 patient aged under 15 years (0,69%) and 3 patients aged less than 20 years 
(2.07%).  
Efficacy results 
No specific analyses of the efficacy in paediatric patients have been conducted. 
According to the MAH, a greater reduction in the ferritin levels was observed in the special drug use 
observational study than in the drug use observational study, indicating that the efficacy was 
highlighted due to the increased exposure after long-term treatment. 
Safety results 
Adverse reactions: none in patients under 15 years and one ADR for patients under 20 years 
The serious adverse reactions and the adverse events of interest were not detailed by age. 
CHMP's comments:  
The mean reduction SF is provided for the overall population (ie pediatric and adult). No specific 
analyses of the efficacy in paediatric patients have been conducted. 
Children under 15 account for only 1.60% of the studied population (40 cases).  
Pediatric safety data in these 40 patients did not found unexpected adverse effects or more frequent 
adverse effects than in adults. Although the number of patients has been calculated to detect eye or 
ear disorders, the adverse effects of interest and the serious adverse reactions were not shown by age. 
2.3.2.2. Study number CICL670A2418: Complications in Patients with Sickle Cell disease (SCD) and 
Utilization of Iron Chelation Therapy (ICT): A Retrospective Medical Records Review 
Description: A retrospective study of sickle cell disease complications.  
Methods 
In this study data on sickle cell complications, utilization of health care delivery to treat sickle cell 
complications, transfusion utilization, extent of patients’ Transfusional Iron Overload (TIO), and ICT 
treatment patterns were collected from patient medical charts. Outcomes were compared between 
transfused patients and non-transfused patients, and, of those patients who have been transfused, 
between patients who have undergone ICT therapy and those who have not. The study protocol, 
including the data collection form, was submitted to each Institutional Review Board (IRB) prior to 
study Initiation. 
Objectives 
The objectives of the study are to: 
(1) Compare transfused vs. non-transfused Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) patients (≥16 years) with 
respect to the following endpoints:

a. Rates of sickle cell complications (e.g.: pain, infections, stroke) 
b. Utilization of health care delivery to treat the sickle cell complications 
(2) Among transfused SCD patients (≥16 years), compare those who received ICT vs. those who did 
not with respect to the following endpoints: 
a. Rates of sickle cell complications (e.g.: pain, infections, stroke) 
b. Utilization of health care delivery to treat the sickle cell complications 
(3) Describe the utilization and reason of blood transfusions over lifetime stratified by key factors (e.g., 
age) 
(4) Describe the extent of iron overload (e.g., through SF readings, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), 
Liver Iron Concentration(LIC) in patients receiving Iron Chelation Therapy (ICT) over time, including 
utilization patterns of ICT overall and by age. 
Study design: Retrospective cohort study.  
Data were collected from patient medical charts. 254 SCD patients ≥16 years of age from the SCD 
centers were reviewed. The entire sample was divided into three cohorts based on units of blood 
transfused over lifetime and whether or not patients received ICT 
1) patients receiving < 15 units of blood transfused (Cohort 1, n=69), 
2) patients receiving ≥ 15 units of blood transfused without ICT (Cohort 2, n=91), and 
3) patients receiving ≥ 15 units of blood transfused and ICT (Cohort 3, n=94).

Study population /Sample size:  
The medical charts of 254 SCD patients ≥16 years of age from the SCD centers were reviewed. Of 
these 254 patients, 117 were from the University of Tennessee, 72 were from Tulane University, and 
65 were from Howard University. The patient observation period was at least of 6 months. 
Treatments: Among the 254 included patients, 94 transfused patients (cohort 3) received an iron 
chelating agent: deferoxamine or deferasirox. Only 78 patients received deferasirox.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
- 
Sickle cell complications (not complications associated with treatment of SCD or iron chelation 
therapy) 
-  Utilization of health care delivery to treat sickle cell complications 
-  Utilization of blood transfusions (patients with frequent transfusions only) 
- 
Burden of transfusional iron overload (patients with frequent transfusions only) 
-  Utilization of iron chelation therapy: defined as a prescription of oral suspension deferasirox or 
administration of subcutaneous deferoxamine. Data of interest included: type of chelator 
received, frequency, dosage duration : but "The specified scope of this study was not designed 
to evaluate a specific safety concern or question as in the case for post-marketing surveillance 
studies or patient registries. However, it was recognized that relevant and important safety 
information related to a Novartis drug might be discovered in the course of performing a 
retrospective review of medical records." 
Statistical Methods 
For each of the endpoints, continuous variables were summarized by mean, standard deviation, 
median, minimum, maximum (25% and 75% quartiles, as appropriate) and number of patients with 
non-missing data. Categorical variables were summarized by absolute frequencies and percentages. 
Unadjusted comparisons of results between cohorts were based on the Pearson χ2 test for categorical 
variables and two-sided Student’s t-test for continuous variables. An alpha level of 0.05 was used to 
declare statistical significance. All data manipulations and statistical analyses were performed using 
SAS version 9.2 software or more recent. 
For iron chelators: treatment patterns were assessed using the following measures: 
o total number of transfusions/units received at ICT initiation 
o SF and other laboratory test levels at ICT initiation 
o frequency, dosage, and duration ICT treatment 
o switching patterns of ICT treatment (deferasirox to deferoxamine and vice versa)

o ICT treatment interruption and discontinuation 
Results 
254 patients were reviewed for this study. Across cohorts, the average was 6.6 years for Cohort 1, 8.2 
years for Cohort 2, and 8.1 years for Cohort 3. The median age at study index date was 22 years. 
In Cohort 3, 99% of patients had at least one SF reading. The mean (sd) number of SF readings per 
patient was 12 (18) readings. Mean (sd) SF level throughout the observation period was 3,268 (2,902) 
ng/mL (range: 26-28,124 ng/mL). Liver iron concentration, considered the gold standard for 
measuring total body iron, was collected for 18 patients, 17 of whom were in Cohort 3. Each patient 
had one LIC reading, with a mean (median) of 28 (median) mg FE/g dry weight (range of 0-52 mg 
FE/g dry weight). 
Of the 94 patients in Cohort 3, 90 patients received ICT during the observation period, and four 
patients who received ICT only in the pre-index date (history) period. During the observation period, 
78 patients received deferasirox, and 29 patients received deferoxamine. Mean (sd) treatment duration 
was 180 (176) days, and the mean gap between ICT prescriptions was 86 days. Five patients switched 
from deferasirox to deferoxamine, and 12 patients switched from deferoxamine to deferasirox. Thirty 
patients interrupted deferasirox treatment, and seven interrupted deferoxamine. The length of 
treatment interruption was on average 231 days for the 7 observed deferasirox patients, and 31 days 
for the two observed deferoxamine patients. Treatment discontinuation was observed for 18 
deferasirox patients and six deferoxamine patients. At the time of ICT treatment initiation, patients 
had received an average (sd) of 31 (24) transfusions and 71 (81) units of blood. Fifty five patients had 
a SF reading within 60 days prior to ICT initiation. Among these patients, mean (sd) SF level was 
4,985 ng/mL (2,922), a level at least four times above the recommended guidelines for commencing 
ICT treatment. 
This long-term observational study examining real-world treatment patterns, SCD-related 
complications and associated resource utilization of 254 adults (≥16 years old) patients with SCD from 
three tertiary centers revealed that adult patients with SCD suffered from a significant clinical burden, 
experiencing on average 1.66 SCD-related complications PPPY among those less frequently transfused 
patients (Cohort 1) and 2.64 SCD-related complications among those frequently transfused (Cohorts 2 
and 3). In this latter group of patients, those receiving chelation therapy were less likely to experience 
complications than those who didn’t.

hematology centers from Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Panama, Peru, 
Trinidad & Tobago, and Venezuela. 
2.  The secondary objectives were : 
a.  to evaluate the severity of iron overload due to transfusion therapy in this world 
region; 
b.  to analyze the frequency of iron chelation therapy and regimens employed;  
c. 
to analyze available compliance therapy with iron-chelating therapy across different 
countries of Latin America; 
d.  to create a regional knowledge base about iron overload, correlating the main findings 
with patients’ country of origin, ethnicity, diagnosis, and local patterns of care;  
e.  and to evaluate the frequency of clinical consequences of iron overload (cardiac 
disease, diabetes, growth failure, etc.). 
Study design: As a retrospective epidemiological study, it did not test a scientific hypothesis based 
upon a specific endpoint, and treatment and patient evaluation were left to the discretion of the 
treating physicians and local standards of care, which were not influenced by this study. 
Treatment: There was no investigational drug/reference therapy. No duration of treatment available. 
Study period:  First patient enrolled: 18-Sep-2006, Last patient completed: 31-Jan-2008. 
Study population: 60/975 patients received Exjade. 
Statistical methods: All data entered into the system by participating investigators or their designees 
generated a database containing all information collected from each patient. Such data were 
summarized by means of tables. Data were analyzed to define the prevalence and clinical features as 
well as to identify and characterize treatment patterns in four subgroups defined by the primary 
diagnosis: sickle-cell anemia, thalassemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and other. Descriptive statistics 
were calculated to summarize population characteristics by subgroup and global. Categorical variables 
from these patients were compared by means of the chi square test. Continuous variables were 
compared by Student’s t tests. Mean values were reported with +/- 1 standard deviation. Median and 
interquartile range were also reported when appropriate. Alpha was set at 0.05 and all tests of 
significance were two-tailed. All statistical analyses were done using SAS® software version 9.1.3. 
No safety assessment was performed for this study. 
Results: 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Upon study completion, 975 patients were included, 15 of which were excluded from analysis, thus

Iron-chelation therapy: 442 (46.3%) patients received iron-chelation therapy and amongst them 60 
patients (13.6%) received deferasirox. 
Efficacy results 
The study did not report any efficacy information. 
Safety results  
Complications of iron-chelating therapy were presented for all treated patients (442) without 
distinction between deferoxamine and deferasirox: No adverse effects were reported in 295 patients 
(66.7%). Pain/reaction at infusion site were recorded in 83 cases (18.8%) probably related to 
deferoxamine infusion, allergic reaction in 26 cases (5.9%), gastrointestinal symptoms in 18 cases 
(4.1%), arthropathy in 2 cases (0.5%), neutropenia/agranulocytosis in 2 cases, liver dysfunction in 3 
cases (0.7%), visual abnormalities (unspecified) in 5 cases (1.1%), auditory dysfunction in 3 cases 
(0.7%), bone abnormalities in 4 cases (0.9%), growth impairment 1 case (0.2%), dermatologic 
(unspecified) in 5 cases (1.1%), other (unspecified) in 22 cases (5.0%). 
Among the main reason for discontinuation of the iron chelation therapy, treatment-toxicity was 
reported in 6 cases (1.4%).  
CHMP's comments:  
Only 60/975 patients received Exjade in this study. 
This study did not report any efficacy information. Also, this epidemiological study was not designed 
to evaluate safety data. Complications of iron-chelating therapy were presented for all patients, 
regardless of the age and the iron chelator, deferoxamine or deferasirox. So no pediatric safety data 
were available in this study. 
2.3.2.2.4. Study number CILC670ADE-04: Exjade: Post-Marketing Surveillance Study on 
Tolerability and Efficiency of Exjade® (Deferasirox) in Patients with Transfusion dependent Iron 
Overload and with Prior Chelation Therapy 
Description: This post-marketing surveillance study entitled ‘Exjange’ examined the safety and 
efficacy of the once-daily oral iron chelator Exjade® for the management of chronic iron overload 
caused by blood transfusions in 109 pre-treated patients.  
Methods: 
Objectives: to collect data on the safety and efficacy profile of the treatment with Exjade® under 
daily life treatment conditions in patients suffering from transfusion- dependent iron overload and pre-
treated with other iron chelators. 
Study design: Post-marketing surveillance study (PMS): a prospective uncontrolled open-labelled, 
multi center observational study. 
Study Population / sample size: The study was conducted among 37 physicians based in pediatric 
and haematologic-oncologic institutions in Germany. The planned observation period for each subject 
was 12 months including an initial visit at start of observation period and follow-up visits after about 2, 
4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 months.

Study period: from October 2006 to January 2009  
Treatment: Exjade® 
Outcomes/ Endpoints: During the observation period safety (adverse events and adverse drug 
reactions) and efficacy data (serum ferritin level) was being collected as generated by usual clinical 
practice. 
Statistical methods: All patients who took at least one dose of Exjade® and had any follow-up 
information after initial visit were regarded as valid for Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. 
Descriptive analyses of the data were performed using summary statistics for categorical and 
quantitative data. Continuous data were described by mean, standard deviation (SD), minimum, 1, 5, 
25, 75, 95, 99 percent quantiles, median, maximum, number of non-missing values. In addition, 
continuous data were categorized in clinically meaningful way. Categorical data including categories of 
continuous data were presented in frequency tables. 
Number of patients with missing data was presented as a separate category. Percentages were 
calculated as a proportion of each category including the category missing values. In some subgroup 
analyses percentages were calculated based on non-missing values (adjusted frequencies). 
A stratifying analysis was performed for the underlying primary disease (MDS, beta thalassemia and 
other). Incidence rates for specific adverse events were calculated as the number of specific events 
reported divided by the number of patients at risk, where the number of specific events was defined as 
the number of patients reporting the specific event and the number at risk was defined as all patients 
with consumption of Exjade® during the observation period. For multiple occurrences of a specific 
event within one patient, the event was counted only once. 
Results: 
Recruitment/Number analysed: A total of 110 patients participated in this observational study. The 
first patient entered the study on 1 October 2006, last patient last visit was on 26 January 2009. Out 
of 110 patients enrolled, 109 were included in the ITT analysis. One patient was lost to follow-up. 
Baseline data: A total of 57 male and 52 female patients with iron overload and prior chelation 
therapy were included in the ITT analysis. Patients’ ages ranged from 3 years to 88 years with a 
median of 62 years.  
44 were assigned to the MDS group (40.4%), 33 to the beta thalassemia group (30.3%) and 32 to the 
group with ‘other’ primary disease (29.4%). Among 37 patients with specification of another primary 
disease, “benign, malignant or unspecified neoplasms” was the by far most frequently mentioned 
MedDRA SOC level (n=24). The most frequently reported other primary diseases by MedDRA Preferred 
Term were: myelofibrosis (n=6), myeloproliferative disorder (n=4), acute myeloid leukaemia (n=4) 
and congenital aplastic anemia (n=4). 
Population was divided into four age groups : < 16 years, 16 to < 50 years, 50 to < 65 years, and > 
65 years. The patients < 16 years represented 7.3% of the total population but 15.2% of 
betathalassemia and 9.4% for other primary diseases.  
Patients with MDS had the highest median transfusional iron intake (0.29 mg/kg/d) with a baseline 
serum ferritin level to 2442 µg/L, while those with other primary disease had the lowest (0.15 
mg/kg/d) and a baseline serum ferritin to 2635 µg/L. For patients with beta thalassemia the lowest 
median baseline serum ferritin level was observed (1864 μg/L).

All patients had already been exposed to a prior iron chelation therapy: deferoxamine (n=99, 90.8%), 
deferiprone 28.4% and unspecified “other treatment” (1.8%). For 2 patients the type of prior 
treatment was unknown. In the beta thalassemia group prior treatment had started earlier compared 
to the other disease groups (Desferal / Ferriprox start in median years before: MDS: 2.0 / 1.3; beta 
thalassemia: 7.7 / 3.7; other: 1.6 / 2.0). MDS patients had received lower median daily doses of 
Desferal when compared to the other disease groups (median daily dosage: MDS: 16.8 mg/kg; beta 
thalassemia: 40.0 mg/kg; other: 35.0 mg/kg). 
The majority of all patients was prescribed an initial dose of 20 - < 30 mg/kg Exjade® (n=58, 53.2%). 
An initial dose of 10 - < 20 mg/kg was prescribed to 30 patients (27.5%). A dose of < 10 mg/kg or ≥ 
30 mg/kg was administered to 11 and 10 patients (10.1% and 9.2%), respectively. With respect to 
results of stratified analysis, an initial dose of < 10 mg/kg was more frequently chosen for patients 
with other primary diseases, whereas beta thalassemia patients more frequently received doses of 20 - 
< 30 mg/kg. After about 2 months of treatment, for 25.0% (n=26) of all patients was stated that it 
was necessary to adjust the Exjade® dosage. The following reasons were provided: other reasons 
(n=10), chelation to poor (n=9), occurrence of an adverse event (n=4), reason missing (n=2) and 
chelation too strong (n=1). For more than one quarter of patients (n=29, 26.6%) the Exjade® 
treatment was stopped at any time during the observation period. Reasons for discontinuation of 
therapy were (multiple responses possible): Occurrence of an adverse event (n=16, 14.7% of all 
patients), other reasons (n=11) and poor compliance (n=3). 
Efficacy results 
No specific analyses of the efficacy in paediatric patients have been conducted. 
A decrease in SF of 276 ng/ml was reported after 12 months, according to the MAH. 
Safety results 
Change in serum creatinine and creatinine clearance: For serum creatinine a median increase of 0.1 
mg/dl during the study period was observed in 85 patients. The changes in creatinine differed across 
primary disease subgroups: whereas MDS patients experienced a median increase of 0.2 mg/dl until 
final visit, beta thalassemia and other disease patients did not show any change in median of 
differences. For creatinine clearance, a median decrease of 24 mL/min was observed, but this 
parameter was calculated for only 12 patients. 
In summary, 174 adverse events (AE) were documented in 62 out of the 109 patients exposed 
(56.9%). For a total of 16 patients (14.7%) it was assessed that their events were not serious and 
there was no causality or only an unlikely causality to Exjade®. An adverse drug reaction (ADR) was 
documented in respect of 42 patients (38.5%), i.e. the causality to Exjade® was classified as certain, 
probable or possible or the causality was not assessable. For 20 patients (18.3%) at least one event 
fulfilled the criteria for a serious adverse event (SAE). For three patients (2.8%) a serious adverse 
drug reaction (SADR) was reported. 
The majority of events occurred in the System Organ Class “Gastrointestinal disorders” (n=39), 
followed by the Organ Classes “Investigations” (n=33) and “Infections and infestations” (n=18). 
On the Preferred Term level, the most commonly reported events were gastrointestinal symptoms like 
diarrhoea (n=12) and nausea (n=11) as well as blood creatinine increased (n=8). The outcome of the 
majority of events classified as ADR was assessed as resolved. Six patients died during the study. In 
none of these six cases a causal relationship to Exjade was supposed.

The three serious ADR were reported in adults: one case of diabetes mellitus (F, 44 y.o) and two cases 
of renal insufficiency (M, 74 y.o and M, 73 y.o) leading to Exjade discontinuation. 
CHMP's comments:  
Only 8 children were included in this post-marketing study.  
The mean reduction SF is provided for the overall population (ie pediatric and adult). No specific 
analyses of the efficacy in paediatric patients have been conducted.  
Pediatric safety data are not presented separately by the MAH. 
Research in the line listing of cumulative report of safety data by system organ class identified only 3 
pediatric adverse events (researched by the birth date for an inclusion between 2006 and 2009): 
- Increase of transaminases was reported in one child, 
- An adolescent  has developed a generalized rash,  
- Splenomegaly and hepatomegaly with liver disorders and treatment noncompliance with elevation of 
ferritin, and thrombosis were reported in an adolescent .

Methods: 
Objectives: The objective of this PMS study was to collect data on the safety and efficacy profile of 
the treatment with Exjade® under daily life treatment conditions in patients suffering from 
transfusion- dependent iron overload. The EXTEND study was focused on patients treated the first time 
with iron chelators. 
Study design: The observation period was up to 12 months after start of therapy with follow-up visits 
after about 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 months. The study documentation given to each physician consisted 
of a documentation folder comprising a declaration of consent to participate in the PMS study, an 
observation plan, the Summary of Product Characteristics as well as five numbered case record forms. 
The responsible sales reps collected sequentially the completed CRFs from the physicians and passed 
these onto the CRO. After receipt the pages were registered, the documentation was checked for 
adverse events and the data were entered in the study database. In the event that the data was 
incomplete or inconsistent with respect to non-documented or hidden adverse events, queries were 
sent to the physician requesting completion, checking and/or correction of the data in question. 76 
physicians participated. 
Study population/Sample size: It was planned to collect valid documentations of up to 300 
patients. 
Study period: 1 October 2006-29 January 2009 
Treatments: Exjade® was observed within the approved indication within regular practice of the 
attending physicians. No intervention in the therapeutic decisions of the investigator was allowed. 
Exjade® was prescribed in the usual manner in accordance with the terms of the marketing 
authorization. No additional diagnostic or monitoring procedures were to be applied to the patients. 
Outcomes/Endpoints: Every adverse event was to be documented in the CRF, irrespective of 
whether or not a causal relationship was established between it and Exjade® therapy. The physician 
was to specify the start and duration of the event, then evaluate the intensity and the causal 
relationship and document the outcome and any actions that were taken. A basic distinction was to be 
made between serious and non-serious adverse events. 
Statistical methods: All patients who took at least one dose of Exjade® and had any follow-up 
information after initial visit were regarded as valid for Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Descriptive 
analyses of the data were performed using summary statistics for categorical and quantitative data. 
Continuous data were described by mean, standard deviation (SD), minimum, 1, 5, 25, 75, 95, 99 
percent quantiles, median, maximum, number of non-missing values. In addition, continuous data 
were categorized in clinically meaningful way. 
Categorical data including categories of continuous data were presented in frequency tables. 
Number of patients with missing data were presented as a separate category. Percentages were 
calculated as a proportion of each category including the category missing values. In some subgroup 
analyses percentages were calculated based on non-missing values (adjusted frequencies). A 
stratifying analysis was performed for the underlying primary disease (MDS and other). Incidence rates

for specific adverse events were calculated as the number of specific events reported divided by the 
number of patients at risk, where the number of specific events was defined as the number of patients 
reporting the specific event and the number at risk was defined as all patients with consumption of 
Exjade® during the observation period. For multiple occurrences of a specific event within one patient, 
the event was counted only once. 
Results: 
Recruitment/Number analysed: A total of 230 patients participated in this observational study. The first 
patient entered the study on 1 October 2006 last patient last visit was on 29 January 2009. Out of 230 
patients enrolled, 226 were included in the ITT analysis. Patient nos. 1801, 4501, 7301 and 9603 were 
excluded since only documentation of the first visit of the corresponding CRF was available (lost to 
follow-up). 
Baseline data: Of the 226 patients included in analysis, 123 were assigned to the MDS group (54.4%) 
and 103 to the group with ‘other’ primary diseases (45.6%). Ten patients with double response in 
primary disease variable (MDS and other primary disease) were counted among the MDS group. The 
most frequently reported "other primary diseases" by MedDRA Preferred Term were: myelofibrosis 
(n=26), myeloproliferative disorder (n=11), acute myeloid leukaemia (n=11) and aplastic anaemia 
(n=10). From beta thalassemia and sickle cell anaemia suffered five and four patients, respectively. A 
total of 118 male and 106 female patients with iron overload and without pre-treatment were included 
in the ITT analysis (2 patients with missing sex). Patients’ ages ranged from 3 years to 91 years with a 
median of 69 years. No child under 16 years is recognized among MDS patients and 3 children < 16 
years (2 children < 6 years and 1 child between 6 and 12 years) with other primary disease were 
included. The most frequently reported concomitant diseases by MedDRA Preferred Term were: 
hypertension (n=58), unspecified diabetes mellitus (n=29), type 2 diabetes mellitus (n=20), coronary 
artery disease (n=17) and hyperuricaemia (n=12). Concomitant treatment was used by 60.6% of all 
patients. In accordance with the documentation of concomitant diseases, antihypertensive and 
antidiabetic medications were taken most frequently. Most often an initial dose of 20 - < 30 mg/kg 
Exjade® was prescribed (n=109, 48.4%). An initial dose of 10 - < 20 mg/kg was prescribed to 59 
patients (26.2%). A dose of < 10 mg/kg or ≥ 30 mg/kg was administered to 44 and 6 patients (19.6% 
and 2.7%), respectively. With respect to results of stratified analysis in initial dosage, no differences 
between primary disease groups were observed. After about 2 months of treatment, for 19.8% (n=44) 
of all patients was stated that it was necessary to adjust the Exjade® dosage. The following reasons 
were provided: chelation too poor (n=16), other reasons (n=14), occurrence of an adverse event 
(n=11) and reason missing (n=4). In the follow-up visits after about 4 months until final visit the rate 
of patients with need for dose adjustment was lower and ranged between 10% and 15%. Nine patients 
discontinued Exjade for adverse event. 
Efficacy results 
No specific analyses of the efficacy in paediatric patients have been conducted. 
A decreased in SF of 723 ng/ml was reported after 12 months, according to the MAH. 
Safety results:

Change in serum creatine and creatine clearance: For serum creatinine a median increase of 0.1 mg/dl 
during the study period was observed. The parameter creatinine clearance was taken only for a small 
percentage of patients. In 13 patients with pre and post measurement no change was observed. 
Hearing test: At initial and last visit, for 27 and 8 patients, respectively, the findings of a hearing test 
were documented. For none of the 7 patients with pre and post assessment a change was reported. 
Ophthalmological examination: The results of an ophthalmological examination were available for 23 
patients at initial visit and for 5 patients at final visit. For 4 out of 5 patients with pre and post findings 
no change was documented, in one patient the pathological finding (mild cataract) of the initial visit 
was converted to a normal finding according to the age of the patient at the last visit. 
Adverse events: 384 adverse events (AE) were documented in 133 out of the 226 patients exposed 
(58.8%). An adverse drug reaction (ADR) was documented in 73 patients (32.3%), i.e. the causality to 
Exjade® was classified as certain, probable or possible or the causality was not assessable. For six 
adult patients (2.7%) a serious adverse drug reaction (SADR) was reported: cataract (1), neutropenia 
(1), myocardial infarction (1), gastrointestinal hemorrhage (1), blindness (1) renal failure (1). For 
ADR, the main system organ classes were: Gastrointestinal disorders, General disorders and 
administration site conditions, Investigations, Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. For the serious 
adverse effects, the involved system organ classes were gastrointestinal disorders, Investigations, 
Blood and lymphatic system disorders, cardiac disorders, Eyes disorders and renal and urinary 
disorders. 33 patients died during the observation period (age 57 to 86 years). For the majority of 
patients the cause of death was related to worsening of their underlying primary diseases. 
CHMP's comments: 
The mean reduction SF is provided for the overall population (ie pediatric and adult). No specific 
analyses of the efficacy in paediatric patients have been conducted.  
As the pediatric data were not presented separately, the research in the line listing with the birth date 
provided the following adverse events into children: treatment interruption due to lack of compliance 
and allogenic bone marrow transplantation in one paediatric patient , ALT and AST increases in another 
young child . No information about the last child was retrieved. 
This PMS study included only 3 children under 16 years of the 226 analyzed patients, which does not 
describe the pediatric safety profile. 
2.3.2.2.6. Study number CICL670AGR01: A non-intervENtional obsERvational study assessing 
safetY of deferasirox in patients with transfusional iron overload: the ‘ENERGY’ study 
Description: A prospective uncontrolled open-labelled, multicenter observational was performed in 
Greece during a 12-month. 33% of the sites (6/18) were located in Attica while the rest 67% (12/18) 
outside Attica. The period of patient recruitment ranged from 14-July-2009 (first patient in) to 23-Dec-
2011 (last patient in). 
Methods: Safety assessments consisted of monitoring of all adverse events, monitoring and recording 
of all serious adverse events, regular monitoring of hematology and blood chemistry, as well as regular 
monitoring of growth and sexual development (weight, height, pubertal stage), ocular and auditory 
conditions, in accordance with the approved package insert. Also, the following assessment of iron

overload or cardiac function were captured: serum ferritin levels during the study and change from 
baseline, liver MRI T2*, cardiac MRI T2/T2*, LVEF, LIC. Liver MRI, cardiac MRI, LIC and LVEF were 
performed at the discretion of the physician during the study. 
Objective(s) The primary objective of the study was to assess the safety of deferasirox in patients 
with chronic iron overload related to blood transfusions applied for the treatment of anemias. Safety 
assessments consisted of monitoring of all adverse events, monitoring and recording of all serious 
adverse events, regular monitoring of hematology and blood chemistry, as well as regular monitoring 
of growth and sexual development (weight, height, pubertal stage), ocular and auditory conditions, in 
accordance with the approved package insert. 
Study design: This was a single-arm, open-label, prospective, non-interventional observational study 
with the participation of 20 hospital sites (18 hospital sites actually participated) located throughout 
Greece. The study, provided safety data collected during a 12-month period of treatment with 
deferasirox. Since this was an observational study, it did not impose a therapy protocol, 
diagnostic/therapeutic interventions or a strict visit schedule. 
Data collection was performed in daily clinical practice and in accordance with the monitoring 
recommendations for deferasirox as follows: 
• adverse events 
• serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) also known as aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 
serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), also known as alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 
creatinine, creatinine clearance, proteinuria, cystatin-C (if performed) 
• renal histology (if clinically indicated) 
• audiological and ophthalmologic assessments 
• developmental test (only for children) 
Data on concomitant medications were only collected in case of hepatic or renal AEs. 
The observance of the following rules has ensured the non-interventional character of this project: 
Deferasirox was administered according to the currently approved labeling (SPC). 
The investigators’ decision-making to administer deferasirox to a patient was based on current 
medical practice and preceded the consideration of patient’s eligibility for enrolment into the study. 
The participating patients did not undergo diagnostic or follow-up procedures other than those 
usually implemented by their treating physician. 
Physicians were only asked to collect and report AEs/SAEs during all visits. Regarding other 
assessments, physicians were encouraged to complete them only if their use constituted a part of their 
routine examination practice. 
Statistical analysis of collected data was performed with the use of appropriate descriptive statistical 
methods. 
The study was designed to follow up patients for 12 months. This time period was considered adequate 
to allow the manifestation and the documentation of the safety profile of study medication.

Study population /Sample size 
A total of 230 subjects were enrolled in the study. Of those 4 subjects were assessed as protocol 
violators. 179 (79.2%) patients completed the 12-month study follow-up, while 47 discontinued 
prematurely. 
The study population has been divided in two groups according to the participant’s age at the baseline 
visit. Groups have been defined as: 24 Pediatric patients (Age < 16 years) and 202 Adult patients (Age 
≥ 16 years). 
Thus, the population included in the final statistical analysis comprised of 226 subjects 202 of whom 
were adults (38.3±10.9 years) and 24 children (8.7±4.2 years). The mean age of the study 
participants was 35.1±13.8 years with a slight preponderance of females over males (58.0%/42.0%). 
The pediatric population had a mean age of 8.7±4.2 years and a mean height of 131.3±22.5 cm. The 
adult population had a mean age of 38.3±10.9 years and a mean BMI of 23.5±3.2 kg/m². Beta-
thalassemia major was the most frequently reported (66.8%) reason for transfusion therapy among 
the overall study population, followed by thalassemia intermedia (17.7%) and sickle cell anemia 
(9.3%). 
Treatment  
The majority of the participants (64.2%) were initiated on a dose ranging between 20 and <30 
mg/kg/day. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
During the 12-month follow-up, 34.1% of the overall population did not undergo any dose 
modifications of their deferasirox treatment, while the remaining 65.9% underwent at least one dose 
modification. Among those requiring a dose modification, 35.6% (53/149) underwent 1 modification, 
25.5% (38/149) underwent two modifications, while the remaining 38.9% (58/149) underwent 3 or 
more modifications. Treatment was permanently discontinued for 30.2% (45/149), while treatment 
was temporarily discontinued for 23.5% (35/149). In addition, the dose was only increased in 24.2% 
(36/149) of the participants, and it was only decreased in 7.4% (11/149).

The main study population consisted of the remaining 226 patients (FAS). 179 (79.2%) patients 
completed the 12-month study follow-up, while 47 discontinued prematurely. The main reason for 
discontinuation of study participation was due to AE (7.1%) followed by loss to follow-up (4.4%). 
Two pregnancies occurred during the study, both of which resulted in study discontinuation. 
The median duration of study treatment was 11.1 months (range: 0.03-13.6), while for the 47 
subjects who prematurely discontinued the study the median time to discontinuation was 6.7 months 
(0.03-12.1) 
Statistical Methods 
Analysis of baseline data and all safety analysis have been performed in the Full Analysis Set 
population. Efficacy analyses performed within the framework of this study have been based on the 
subsets of patients from FAS with available data in the study efficacy variables. The non-parametric 
Wilcoxon signed rank sum test has been applied in order to test the change from baseline visit in 
continuous variables at several time-points of the study. The McNemar’s test has been used in order to 
evaluate the change in the proportion of patients with pathological/normal levels of laboratory exams 
between baseline and postbaseline visits 
Descriptive data 
The pediatric population had a mean age of 8.7±4.2 years and a mean height of 131.3±22.5 cm. All 
subjects were Caucasian. 24 patients <16 years (10.6%) were enrolled. The pediatric population has 
been divided in three groups according to the participant’s age at the baseline visit :   
2 ≤ Age < 6  (n=8) 
6 ≤ Age < 12 (n=9) 
12≤ Age < 16 (n=7) 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Among the list of inclusion criteria, there were male or female patients with thalassemia and iron 
overload aged ≥ 6 years. Moreover, patients with iron overload and other anemias, or patients aged 2 
to 5 years or patients with beta thalassemia and a minor load of blood transfusions may receive 
deferasirox if treatment with deferoxamine is contraindicated or inadequate, according to the Summary 
of Product Characteristics. 
Baseline data 
The pre-baseline assessment for iron overload diagnosis mean serum ferritin levels was 1488.0±976.0 
for the paediatric population. At the baseline visit, the mean serum ferritin levels was 1532.7±1002.6. 
Of paediatric population, 13/22 had serum ferritin levels above 1000 ng/ml and 100 % out of 3 with 
available data had normal cardiac MRI T2* (>20 msec) prior to the baseline visit. In 75 % of the 4

patients with available data there was no pre-baseline evidence of liver iron deposition (liver MRI 
T2* >6,3 msec). A minority of paediatric participants (9/24) had received iron chelation therapy prior 
to the initiation of deferasirox. Among pediatric participants the most common prior chelation therapy 
was DFP alone received by 44.4% (4/9) participants. The mean length of the time period elapsed 
between deferasirox treatment initiation and study enrolment was 25.9 days (range: 15.0 to 56.0 
days). The majority of the paediatric participants (16/24) were initiated on a dose ranging between 20 
and <30 mg/kg/day. 
Results 
Efficacy results 
During the 12-month follow-up, among the pediatric population, all but 2 participants (91.7%) 
underwent dose modifications. The median number of dose modifications was 2 (range: 0- 7). 
The median duration of deferasirox treatment for the paediatric population was 11.7 months (range: 
0.7-14.1 months). Treatment was permanently discontinued in 36.4% (8/22) of the pediatric 
participants, for which the median time to treatment discontinuation was 5.1 months (range: 0.7-14.0 
months). 
The changes in serum ferritin levels regarding the paediatric population did not reach statistical 
significance at any visit (1446.5±1044.2 at the 12-month visit, p=0.700). The change in the 
proportion of children regarding serum ferritin values between the baseline (9/22) and the 12-month 
visit (6/11) was also not evaluated as statistically significant by the Mc Nemar’s test (p=0.317). It is 
noted that the number of patients contributing data to post-baseline assessments of serum ferritin 
levels is very small hindering appropriate statistical inference (range 8 to 18). 
By contrast, for adult participants, the mean change in serum ferritin levels from baseline reached 
statistical significance at the 12-month visit (1214.0±1008.3, p=0.009). In addition, the difference in 
the proportion of participants between the baseline visit (68/119, 57.1%) and the 12-month visit 
(51/119, 42.8%) that had serum ferritin levels >1000ng/ml was evaluated as statistically significant 
according to the Mc Nemar’s test (p-value=0.007). 
Assessment of liver and cardiac MRI, LVEF and LIC during the study was performed only for a small 
proportion of the study paediatrics participants (6 patients). The median cardiac MRI T2* was 35.0 
msec (range: 31.7-40.0 msec), while the median liver MRI was 3.6 msec (range: 2.5-26.0 msec). 
Safety results 
Main results 
The main results of the study include the safety assessment of deferasirox, consisting of all (N)SAEs as 
well of physiological levels of laboratory parameters (serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, 
proteinuria, SGOT, SGPT and cystatin C), recording of body weight, height, sexual development and 
ocular and auditory conditions. 
Assessment of laboratory tests during the study 
1 Serum creatinine levels 
The mean levels appeared to remain relatively constant throughout the study. However, when the 
mean change in the serum creatinine levels from baseline values at each visit were evaluated with the 
Wilcoxon signed rank test, slight, albeit statistical significant, increases were observed from Week 1

onwards (p-values ranging from 0.032 to <0.001). The mean serum creatinine levels remained 
relatively constant for the pediatric population with the change not reaching statistical significance at 
any time point during the study 
2 Creatinine clearance levels 
The mean serum creatinine clearance levels remained relatively constant for the pediatric population. 
The change did not reach statistical significance at any time point during the study. 
For the adult population, the decrease in the mean serum creatinine clearance levels was significant 
throughout the study (Wilcoxon signed rank sum test; p-values ranging from 0.042 to <0.001) 
3 SGOT levels 
Significant increases in the mean change were not observed at any time point of the study. A 
statistically significant decrease from baseline levels was noted at the Month 9 visit (Wilcoxon signed 
rank sum test; p=0.044). The mean SGOT levels for the pediatric population did not reach statistical 
significance at any time point during the study. 
4 SGPT levels 
The mean levels tended toward a decrease from baseline values from Week 3 onwards, with the 
change being statistically significant after the Month 5 visit (p values ranging from 0.014 to <0.001). 
Statistically significant increases in the mean change were not observed at any timepoint of the study. 
No statistically significant changes were noted in the SGPT levels for the pediatric population 
5 Serum cystatin C levels 
The mean serum cystatin C levels remained relatively constant throughout the study, with statistically 
significant increases noted at the visits of Months 2 (p=0.026), 4 (p=0.014) and 5 (p=0.016) 
compared to the baseline values using the Wilcoxon signed rank sum test. It is noted that during the 
study, only a small proportion of participants had available data for their serum cystatin C levels.  
No statistically significant changes were noted in serum cystatin C levels for the pediatric population 
according to data from 1 to 5 pediatric participants 
Pathological laboratory values observed during the study 
There were no specific trends in the frequencies of patients with pathological values of any of the 
laboratory measurements for the overall, pediatric and adult population. Pathological levels of 
proteinuria were observed in 12.5-36.4% of the pediatric study population during the study visits and 
in 8.2% to 30.8% of the adults. Notably the highest percentage of adult participants with pathological 
proteinuria levels was observed at the Week 2 visit, while the lowest frequency was observed at the 
12-month visit.

Body weight, sexual development, audiological and ophthalmologic 
Among the overall population, body weight was recorded for 67 participants during the study. 
The mean change from their baseline measurement was 0.3±3.4 kg. 
Among the 15 participants that underwent an ophthalmologic examination during the study no change 
from baseline was recorded for 93.3% (14/15), while an improvement was noted in 1 adult participant

examinations. In regards to the assessment of sexual development among the pediatric population, no 
change was noted in 6 of the 8 participants (75.0%), while an improvement was noted in the 
remaining 2 participants (25.0%). In addition, an increase in height and weight was noted in the 
pediatric population (p<0.001).  
Adverse events and adverse reactions 
The overall AE incidence during the study irrespective of seriousness and causal relationship with 
deferasirox was 50.0%; in particular the incidence of NSAEs and SAEs was 45.6% and 9.3%, 
respectively, while the relevant incidence of NSADRs was 28.8% and of SADRs 1.3%. It is worth 
mentioning that only 13 SAEs were assessed as deferasirox-related. The overall all-cause mortality 
rate was 0%.  
(N)SAE and (N) SADR resulting in study or treatment discontinuation 
The number of patients who discontinued the study due to (N)SAE was 16 (7.1%). More specifically, 
12 adults (5.3%) and 4 children (1.8%) discontinued the study due to an (N)SAE. 
The overall treatment discontinuation rate due to (N)SAE occurrence was 11.5% (26 participants). Of 
the adult population 9.7% (n=22) terminated deferasirox treatment due to (N)SAE, while the 
respective percentage for the pediatric population was 2.2% (n=5).

Discussion 
A total of 226 participants 24 of whom were children (8.7±4.2 years) comprised the study population 
analyzed, 4 children (1.8%) discontinued the study due to an (N)SAE. Treatment discontinuation due 
to (N)SAE was noted for 5 (2.2%) children.  
A total of 167 of the 356 NSAE were NSADRs (i.e. recorded as related to study medication). The 
NSADRs were reported by 65 (28.8%) participants. 141 NSADRs occurred in the adult population, 
while the remaining 26 in the pediatric population. 
Furthermore, 56 SAEs were reported by 21 participants (9.3%).The SAEs reported with a frequency 
≥1% in the adult population, were abdominal pain (1.5%) and pyrexia (1%). Of the 48 SAEs reported 
in the adult population, 39 (81.3%) were severe. A total of 8 SAEs were reported by 3 pediatric 
participants. The majority of the SAEs reported by the pediatric population were of moderate intensity 
(62.5%), while the remaining were severe (37.5%). Of the 56 SAEs, 91.1% had resolved by the end of 
the study. 
Of the 56 SAEs, 13 were assessed as related to the study medication (SADRs). Ten SADRs were 
reported by 2 adult participants, while 3 SADRS by a single participant of the pediatric population. 
CHMP's comments:  
Twenty-four (24) patients <16 years were enrolled in this observational study. The pediatric population 
had a mean age of 8.7±4.2 years. 
Efficacy data 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/CHMP/763315/2016   
Page 54/98 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The interpretation of the presented data is limited, and the results only have an observational value, 
due to: 
- The lack of paediatric results being analyzed separately, 
- The design of the study: open-label, non-randomized, non-controlled with main limitations including 
potential selection bias, missing data and lack of internal validity.  
As a reminder, the MAH submitted this clinical study report in the context of article 46 of Regulation 
(EC) No1901/2006, as amended, on medicinal products for paediatric use. A clear description of 
patient exposure and dose interruption data done by age group in order to compare paediatric and 
adult population would have been expected. 
Regarding these elements no conclusion in terms of efficacy of deferasirox in paediatric population can 
be drawn. On the contrary, from the data presented above, efficacy in reducing iron overload appears 
to be lower than in adult population. 
Safety data 
The safety result is reported by adult and pediatric population but not in sub group 2 ≤ Age < 6  ; 6 ≤ 
Age < 12  ; 12≤ Age < 16 (n=7). 
Information about the patient who developed rectal prolapse is not available. Furthermore, this AE is 
not mentioned as an adverse effect in SCP of deferasirox. 
The frequency of NSDAEs and SADRs seems higher in pediatric population 45.8% and 4.2% 
respectively rather than in adult population 26.7% and 1% respectively.

patients by MRI in Latin America (ASIMILA Study) 
Description: Evaluation of the use of MRI R2 and T2* techniques to assess iron overload in 
transfusion-dependent patients in conditions such as sickle cell disease, myelodysplastic syndrome or 
other chronic anemias. 
Methods: 
Objectives: 
• 
Primary objectives 
1. To determine the prevalence and the extension (severity) of liver and cardiac IOL in transfusion-
dependent patients with Myelodysplastic Syndromes, Aplastic Anemia, Diamond Blackfan Anemia 
(DBA), congenital sideroblastic anemia, or other rare anemias using MRI R2 and MRI T2*, respectively; 
2. To determine the prevalence and the extension (severity) of liver IOL in transfusion dependent 
patients with homozygous Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA) using MRI R2. 
•  Secondary objectives 
1. To investigate the correlation between liver IOL and serum ferritin (SF) levels; 
2. To investigate the correlation between myocardial IOL and SF levels; 
3. To assess the relationship between liver IOL and hepatic complications;

4. To assess the relationship between myocardial IOL and cardiac complications; 
5. To assess the relationship between echocardiogram and myocardial IOL; 
6. To correlate echocardiography findings and cardiac MRI findings in the subset of elderly MDS 
patients. 
Study design: This is an open, multicenter, observational study of patients with liver or cardiac IOL 
secondary to transfusion therapy for chronic anemias. This study will not test a scientific hypothesis 
based upon a specific endpoint. The treatment and patient evaluation will be left to discretion of the 
treating physicians and local standard of care. 
Study population/ Sample size: Patients with a known underlying disease related to transfusional 
IOL: homozygous Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA), low-risk and intermediate-I Myelodysplastic Syndromes 
(MDS), Aplastic Anemia (AA), Diamond Blackfan Anemia (DBA), congenital sideroblastic anemia, or 
other rare anemias. Male and female patients older than 10 years of age were eligible. Lifetime history 
of > 20 units of RBC transfusions with SF level > 2000 ng / ml OR 20 or more lifetime transfusions 
regardless of SF level. It was estimated that approximately 200 patients who met inclusion and 
exclusion criteria would be recruited from tertiary care institutions of Latin America. 
A total of 52/212 patients received Exjade, 103 patients in total were treated for iron overload. 
Study period: 01-Nov-2011 to 28-Mar-2013 
Treatments: this study did not involve study drug and also there were no recommendations or 
guidelines regarding IOL treatment. Patients should have been treated according to the local standard 
of care. 
Outcome/endpoints: Safety assessment:  
For the purposes of this study, the main focus will be on the collection of the following information for 
medication used to treat IOL: 
1. reason for dose/regimen change and/or not taking treatment as prescribed and 
2. reason for death (if any) 
The collection of this information was entered in the proper section of the eCRF. No other AE was 
solicited in this protocol. Adverse events that occurred prior to start ASIMILA protocol were processed 
as medical history. Each of the following subset of AEs will be summarized: 
• AEs reported as serious

• AEs requiring concomitant medication 
• AEs requiring hospitalization/prolonged hospitalization 
• AEs related to current treatment 
Statistical methods: Descriptive statistics for an observational study: Frequency and percentage are 
used for categorical and ordinal variables Number of non-missing values (n), mean, standard-deviation 
(SD), median, minimum and maximum values are used for continuous variables. 
Recruitment/ Number analysed: A total of 212 subjects were enrolled in the study. Thirty seven 
subjects were not included in the FAS due to: failure on inclusion or exclusion criteria (6 subjects), 
failure to perform key procedures – MRI (25), protocol deviation at visit 1 not accepted by Ethics 
Committee (4) and withdrew consent (2). One-hundred and seventy-five subjects were taking into 
account for the analysis. 
Baseline data: The mean age at study entry was 34.6 ± 17 years, 29 pediatric patients, and female 
gender was predominant (54.3%). Population was more or less evenly distributed among 3 ethnic 
groups, Caucasian 31.4%, Hispanic 31.4% and Black / African 29.1%. 103 patients in total were 
treated for iron overload. 50.3% of treated patients received Exjade, 8.6% deferoxamine and 4.0% 
used deferiprone. 
Results 
Efficacy results:  
No specific analyses of the efficacy in paediatric patients have been conducted according to the iron 
chelation therapy. 
A high percentage of patients had abnormal liver MRI (76%). In addition, a high severity score for a 
significant number of patients was observed. 
Safety results: Fourteen subjects (8.0%) have at least one adverse event (AE). There is 1 subject 
with serious AE (0.6%); 2 with grade III AE (1.1%); 1 with AE causing permanent discontinuation of 
current treatment (0.6%), 4 with AE requiring concomitant medication (2.3%), 1 with AE requiring 
hospitalization/prolonged hospitalization (0.6%) and 3 with AE related to current treatment 
Transaminases increased (1.1%) and iron overload (1.1%) are the most often reported adverse 
events. A total of 5 patients required drug discontinuation or drug treatment related to any adverse 
event, as shown below. Four patients required concomitant medication to treat the adverse event, and 
included bone marrow failure related to progression of underlying disease (1 pt), iron overload related 
to excess of transfusions to treat underlying disease (2 pts) and thrombosis (1 pt). One patient 
discontinued drug (unspecified) for AE (unspecified) affected hepatobiliary system.

CHMP's comments: 
Twenty-nine (29) children aged 10 to 18 were included in the study. However, this observational study 
was not built to assess the efficacy and safety of deferasirox in children. Furthermore, a total of 
103/212 patients received an iron chelator therapy, which 50.3 % (52) with deferasirox, but the 
proportion of treated children is not specified.  
This study did not report any efficacy results presented separately according to the iron chelation 
therapy. 
Fourteen (14) adverse events were identified but distribution by age is not available and treatment 
received by these patients is not specified. Among these 14 adverse events, 3 events were related to 
treatment but we have no information on age, treatment and drug adverse effect for these patients.

serious adverse events. 
(1) Summary of incidence of adverse events: All incidences of adverse events were 
summarized, and serious adverse events and unknown adverse events (which are not included 
in “Precaution for use”) were summarized and presented. 
(2) Incidence of adverse events by type: Incidence rate of adverse events was summarized 
and presented by system organ class based on MedDRA ver 15.1. 
(3) Trend of incidence of adverse events by factor 
- Incidence of adverse events by patient background factor 
Incidence of adverse events was summarized and presented by factors including sex, age, 
body weight, creatinine level, transfusion (total number/volume of transfusion, total years of 
transfusion), presence or absence of allergy history, presence or absence of concurrent

disease, actual duration of Exjade use, dose of Exjade, and presence or absence of concomitant 
medication, and was analyzed using Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test if possible. 
- Classification of adverse events 
Adverse events were summarized and presented by details including severity, action(s) taken, 
outcome, and relationship to the study drug. 
- Adverse events in special population Incidence of adverse events in special patient 
population, e.g., geriatric or pediatric patients, pregnant women, patients with renal 
impairment, patients with hepatic impairment, and patients with prolonged use, was analyzed 
separately. 
(4) Factors that may affect the safety 
Logistic regression analysis was performed with factors that may affect the incidence of 
adverse events, e.g. sex, age, allergy history, transfusion, past medical history, concurrent 
disease, duration of Exjade® use, dose of Exjade®, presence of absence of concomitant 
medication, as independent variables and presence or absence of adverse events as a 
dependent variable, to examine the effect of the above factors on the safety outcome. 
Results: 
Recruitment/Number analysed: Case report forms (CRFs) of 1,579 subjects were collected, 
including 209 patients ≥2 to < 12 years (13.2%). Of the collected 1,579 cases, 1,530 subjects were

CHMP's comments:  
The mean reduction SF is provided for the overall population (ie pediatric and adult). No specific 
analyses of the efficacy in paediatric patients have been conducted. 
209 pediatric patients (13.2% of the recruited patients) were enrolled in this study: this is the largest 
number of children included. Nevertheless, the report submitted for analysis is only the study's 
synopsis and pediatric results were not presented separately, while the study planned to present 
incidence of adverse events by factors including age or adverse events in special population, e.g 
pediatric patients. The objectives are not achieved. 
2.3.2.2.9. Study number CICL670ASE01: Observational study evaluating safety and efficacy of 
Exjade (deferasirox) in transfusional dependent anemias (EXTRA) 
Description: This was an open-label, non-randomized observational study in patients treated with 
Exjade® for transfusional hemosiderosis to evaluate clinical efficacy and safety. 
Methods: 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/CHMP/763315/2016   
Page 61/98 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Objectives: The overall objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Exjade® in 
transfusional dependent anemias. The primary objectives of this study were: 
• 
• 
• 
To evaluate the safety of treatment with Exjade® when used in a naturalistic setting reported 
as adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) and by collecting information on 
renal and hepatic safety (following serum creatinine and serum transaminases). 
To evaluate the clinical response to treatment with Exjade® (by following serum ferritin) 
To evaluate patient or patient’s parent/caregiver reported compliance and satisfaction with 
Exjade® treatment. 
Study design: This was an open-label, non-randomized observational study in patients treated with 
Exjade® for transfusional hemosiderosis to evaluate clinical efficacy and safety. Assessment of 
methods and parameters used in daily practice were performed at each planned visit for Exjade® 
treatment, usually every month. Patients were observed in the study for a maximum of 2 years. The 
occurrence of any AEs (including SAEs), the patients’ consumption of Exjade® (including patient 
reported compliance) and the use of concomitant medications were noted in the electronic case report 
forms (eCRFs) by center personnel. Selected laboratory data (including serum ferritin, serum 
transaminases and serum creatinine) acquired from common daily practice were recorded in the eCRFs 
after local analysis. Furthermore, the treatment satisfaction in terms of health status was assessed by 
the use of a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), if this was part of the common practice at the center. 
Study population/ Sample size: The study population consisted of patients with chronic iron 
overload due to blood transfusions:  
• 
• 
patient aged more than 6 years with beta-thalassemia major with iron overload due to 
frequent blood transfusions,  
patients with iron overload where treatment with deferoxamine is contraindicated or 
insufficient in patients : 
o  with other anemias, 
o  age 2-5.  
o  with beta-thalassemia major 
Patients without any earlier treatment for their iron overload as well as patients treated with iron 
chelators were included. The decision to treat the patient with Exjade® had to fall within the current 
practice at the hospital and had to be clearly separated from the decision to include the patient in the 
study.  
Study period: 29-Aug-2006 to 19-Sep-2012 
Treatments: Patients were treated with deferasirox (Exjade®) as prescribed by the investigator under 
the country specific regulations and in agreement with the Prescribing Information/Package Insert. 
Outcomes/Endpoints: 
•  Safety  
o  Serum transaminases and serum creatinine were recorded in the CRF. Other laboratory 
parameters were also recorded if measured in common clinical practice.

o  Tolerability/Safety assessments consisted of monitoring and recording of Adverse 
events and serious adverse events. Pregnancies were reported and measurements of 
growth (weight and height in children), ocular test and auditory test were performed 
annually. 
Statistical methods: The data from all centers were pooled and summarized with respect to 
demographic and baseline characteristics and safety and efficacy observations. Summary statistics was 
presented in total and by site. Exploratory analyses were performed using descriptive statistics. Data 
were presented for the complete intent-to-treat (ITT) population. The assessment of safety was based 
mainly on the frequency of AEs, which included all SAEs. AEs were summarized by presenting the 
number and percentage of patients having any AE, the number and percentage of patients having an 
AE specified for the various body systems and the number and percentage of patients having specific 
AEs. Any other information collected (e.g. severity) was listed as appropriate. AEs were coded using 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 16.0, and presented by System Organ 
Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT). 
Descriptive statistics for continuous variables were summarized as number of observations (n) mean 
(standard deviation [SD]), median, minimum (Min) and maximum (Max) values. Categorical values 
were presented using frequency (n) and percentage (%). 
Results: 
Recruitment/Number analysed: 60 patients were enrolled from 16 centers: one in Denmark and 15 
in Sweden. All the patients were treated with deferasirox. Of the enrolled patients, 21 (35.0%) 
completed the 24 months observation period, 32 (53.3%) discontinued and 7 (11.7%) had missing 
data. Half of the population (32 patients, 53.3%) discontinued from the study prior to 24 months 
observation mainly due to adverse events: 18 patients (56.3%) discontinued of adverse events, 12 
patients (37.5%) discontinued for other reasons (detail of other reasons: death (6), patient's decision 
(2), lost of follow up (1), bone marrow transplantation (2), discontinuation of blood transfusions (1)) 
and 2 patients (6.3%) for inefficacy. 
Baseline data: The majority of the study population was males (39 patients [65%]) and the mean 
age at baseline was 62 years (range: 10 to 93 years). There was 1 patient below the age 18 years at 
inclusion (aged 10 years). The most common diagnosis was “Other anemia” (28 patients [46.7%]) 
followed by “MDS” (23 patients [38.3%]) and “Thalassemia” (9 patients [15.0%]). No patient had 
Sickle-cell anemia (0%). At baseline previous iron chelation therapy had been administered as follows: 
Exjade® to14 patients, Desferal® to 21 patients and Ferriprox® to 18 patients. Of the 14 patients 
previously treated with Exjade®, half of them (7 patients) had experienced AEs related to the 
treatment. Among those that had received previous Exjade® treatment, the mean initial daily dose of 
Exjade® was 18.8 mg/kg. There were 51 patients (85.0%) with at least one concomitant medication. 
The most common therapeutic subgroups were “Antianemic Preparations” and “Antibacterials for 
Systemic Use” in 21 patients (35.0%) respectively followed by “Antineoplastic Agents” in 14 patients 
(23.3%). 
Efficacy results 
No specific analyses of the efficacy in paediatric patients have been conducted. 
According to the MAH, a decreased from BL in mean SF of 2977ng/ml to 1577 ng/ml after 24 months is 
noted.

•  Hematology parameters: stable over time in general. The median hemoglobin value was 
always around 90 g/L and varied from 89 (Month 15 and 18) to 92 g/L (Month 3). The median 
white blood cell count varied from 4.0 x109/L (Month 3) to 5.6 x109/L (Month 21). For 
neutrophils the median varied from 1.7 x109/L (Month 6) to 2.9 x109/L (Month 15 and 21). 
The median for platelets was between 290 x109/L (Month 21) and 138 x109/L (Month 3). 
•  Chemistry: Albuminuria was only reported for a few patients. 
•  Adverse events: A total of 247 adverse events (AEs) were reported in 49 (81.7%) patients and 
22 patients (36.7%) experienced a serious adverse event (SAE). Twelve (12) patients (20.0%) 
died due to SAEs/AEs. It should be noted that it is unknown if the AEs that resulted in death 
were reported as SAEs or not. AEs that were “Probably” related to Exjade® were reported for 
half of the population (50.0%). It was most common on a patient level to have experienced 
AEs “Unlikely” to be related to Exjade® treatment (56.7%). AEs “Possibly” related to Exjade® 
were reported for 35.0% and the relationship was “Not assessable” for 1.7%. AEs were most 
commonly reported within the following SOCs: Gastrointestinal disorders in 56.7% of the 
population, General disorders and administration site conditions and Infections and infestations 
in 28.3% of the population respectively. The most common PT among the SOC Gastrointestinal 
disorders was “Diarrhoea” in 33.3% of the population, followed by “Abdominal pain” in 14 
patients (23.3%) and “Vomiting” in 10 patients (16.7%).

Summary of Specific Adverse Events by Relationship 
•  Auditory function: Auditory tests were performed in 12 patients at baseline: 10 patients had 
normal test results whereas 2 patients had abnormal test results. But no auditory test results 
were available at 12 and 24 months of follow up. 
•  Ophthalmology: Ocular test results were reported for 10 patients at baseline and all had 
normal results. The ocular test results reported were however low and no test results were 
documented beyond baseline. 
•  Weight: The number of patients with weight measured varied from 59 patients at baseline to 
18 patients at Month 24. Moreover, one child is included which affects the mean values. The

largest changes in weight from baseline were an increased weight of 10 kg and an 8.2 kg 
weight loss. 
CHMP’s comments:  
The mean reduction SF is provided for the overall population (ie pediatric and adult). No specific 
analyses of the efficacy in paediatric patients have been conducted. 
Available data on the only child included in this study were researched in tables and figures at the end 
of the report. Case description: a child, with a weight of 15kg at baseline and 19 kg M33. The 
indication for iron chelation is "other anemia". He was previously treated with deferoxamine 
intravenously, 5 to 7 infusions per week from 01 September 2005 to 18 December 2006, and with 
deferiprone from 20 July 2006 to 11 October 2006. On 18 December 2006, Exjade was started with a 
daily dose to 25 mg/kg, increased to 35 mg/kg at M18 then 40 mg/kg at M21 for insufficient chelation. 
Adverse events reported in this child were: Blood and lymphatic system disorders, splenomegaly (but 
for both the relationship with treatment was considered as unlikely), and severe gastrointestinal 
disorders (abdominal pain and vomiting) probably related to the treatment leading to a temporary 
discontinuation of deferasirox.

Conclusions: Only child suffering from "other anemia" is included in this study, for which assessment 
of safety of Exjade® is an objective. Gastrointestinal adverse effects (= "adverse events probably 
related to the treatment") were reported in this child between M27 and M33 and lead to temporary 
discontinuation of Exjade. We also noted a decrease in GFR at M27. The dose of Exjade was increased 
to 40 mg/kg/j since M27. Auditory and ocular tests were performed at baseline but not after. 
Gastrointestinal and renal disorders were labelled in the SPC of Exjade®.  
2.3.2.2.10. Study number CICL670ATR01: A prospective, non-interventional multicenter 
multinational registry of anemia patients requiring chronic transfusional therapy who are at risk for 
transfusional hemosiderosis 
Description: In this study, data were collected on a multinational basis with the aim of creating an 
international registry to study the demographics and disease-management of chronic transfusional 
therapy-dependent anemia patients as well as iron overload and transfusional hemosiderosis.

•  Primary objectives: The primary objectives were to study the magnitude of the problem of 
iron overload in Turkey, Australia, Korea, Taiwan, Russia, Israel, Thailand, Malaysia, Hong 
Kong, Singapore, and China, gaining insight about this condition and the patterns of care 
regarding the use of iron-chelating therapy for transfusion-dependent anemias in this region. 
Other countries from the regions of Asia-Pacific, Middle East and South Africa could also be 
included into the registry. 
•  Secondary objectives: In a subset of countries/centers, some or all of the following were 
secondary objectives of this study: 
o  To describe the demographics and the disease-management of newly diagnosed 
anemia patients requiring chronic transfusional therapy who were at risk for 
transfusional hemosiderosis 
o  To investigate any correlation between clinical characteristics (including World Health 
Organization [WHO] classification and known prognostic factors) at inclusion, 
secondary iron overload due to transfusions or treatments received, and overall 
survival (censored at 3 years), time to leukemia progression, co-morbidities (including 
cardiac function), Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) or quality of life. 
o  To collect safety data on treatment with iron chelators, when applicable, including renal 
safety and liver safety. 
o  To evaluate the severity of iron overload due to transfusion therapy in this world 
region. 
o  To analyze the frequency of iron chelation therapy and regimens employed. 
o  To analyze available compliance therapy with iron chelating therapy across different 
countries in the study region. 
o  To create a regional knowledge base about iron overload, correlating the main findings 
with patients’ country of origin, diagnosis, and local patterns of care. 
o  To evaluate the frequency of clinical consequences of iron overload (cardiac disease, 
diabetes, growth failure, etc). 
Study design: This was a prospective, non-interventional study. The registry was designed to 
collect  information  about  a  large  cohort  of  patients  with  newly  diagnosed  (within  12  months  of  the 
dater of diagnosis) anemia including myelodysplastic syndrome, aplastic anemia, Blackfan-Diamond or 
other  anemias,  and  hemoglobinopathies  such  as  beta-thalassemia,  sickle-cell  anemia  and  others 
requiring chronic transfusional therapy who were at risk of transfusional hemosiderosis. Patients were 
prospectively assessed in the context of existing registries represented within the region. Patients were 
observed until death, or for a maximum of 3 years. 
Study period: 01-Dec-2008 to 29-May 2013. 
Study population/Sample size: 
A  total  of  69  centers  involving  11  countries:  Algeria  (2  centers),  China  (13  centers),  HongKong  (1 
center),  Morocco  (1  center),  Russia  (9  centers),  South  Africa  (2  centers),  South  Korea  (2  centers), 
Taiwan  (6  centers),  Thailand  (7  centers),  Tunisia  (4  centers)  and  Turkey  (22  centers)  participated  in 
the study.

The study population comprised: male and female patients over 2 years of age with newly diagnosed 
(within  12  months  of  the  date  of  diagnosis)  anemia  including  MDS  (limited  to  patients  with  low  or 
intermediate-I 
risk  MDS),  aplastic  anemia,  Blackfan-Diamond  or  other  anemias  and 
hemoglobinopathies  such  as  beta  thalassemia,  sickle-cell  anemia  or  others  requiring  chronic 
transfusional therapy.  
This  study  was  exploratory  in  nature;  thus,  the  estimated  sample  size  was  not  based  on  a  statistical 
hypothesis, but on an estimation of the number of patients diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome, 
aplastic anemia, Blackfan-Diamond or other anemias, who required chronic transfusional therapy over 
a 12-month period, in centers considered large enough to register a sufficient number of patients with 
transfusional hemosiderosis and to perform a subgroup analysis. 
The study was planned to involve approximately 62 sites. The expected number of enrolled patients at 
each site was 15; hence the expected sample size for the study was 800 to 1000 patients. 
A total of 203/564 patients in total were treated with unspecified iron chelation therapy, including 28 
paediatric patients 
Treatments: In this non-interventional observational study, no study-specific treatment was given. 
Outcomes/endpoints:  Safety assessments consisted of all AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), and 
pregnancies,  regular  measurements  of  vital  signs,  body  weight,  height,  and  an  evaluation  of  the 
patient’s  KPS.  If  available,  results  from  laboratory,  radiological  and  cardiac  assessments  were 
collected. 
Statistical methods: All analyses were performed on all patients as well as for patients aged ≤18 
years. All treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), including SAEs, were coded using MedDRA Version 16.0 to 
provide the System Organ Class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) for each AE. The incidence of all TEAEs 
was tabulated by SOC and PT. Relationship to treatment, severity of AE, and seriousness of AE were 
presented. Additional tables by maximum severity, outcome, action taken, and relationship to 
treatment was also presented. In all the tables and listings, AEs were categorized/grouped separately 
as AE onset before transfusion and after transfusion. 
All laboratory data were converted to standard units, if not already converted during the data 
management process. The tabulation of laboratory data was to include the normal ranges for each 
variable. Each value was to be classified as falling above, below or within normal limit. 
It was impossible to use a single central laboratory for all parameters and all patients; however, to 
avoid the issue of collecting hundreds of normal ranges, standard normal ranges were to be defined 
and applied for the purpose of statistical analysis. 
Laboratory shift tables were presented for each parameter to assess the change from baseline values. 
The standard normal reference ranges were not available at the time of analysis, and therefore 
laboratory data have not been classified as falling above, below or within normal limit. 
The tabulation of vital signs included the normal ranges for each variable. Each value was classified as 
falling above, below or within normal limit. Vital signs shift tables were presented for each parameter 
to assess the change from baseline values. 
Results: 
Recruitment/ Number analysed: Investigators at 69 sites in Algeria, China, Hong Kong, Morocco, 
Russia, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Tunisia, South Africa, and South Korea entered a total of 564 
patients, including 57 patients aged ≤18 years. Only 159 (28.2%) patients completed the study.

For patients aged ≤18 years: 15/57 (26.3%) patients aged ≤18 years completed the study and 18 
(31.6%) ended the study; for 24 (42.1%) patients ≤18 years, disposition information was missing. 
The primary reasons for ending the study were lost to follow-up (11 [19.3%] patients and death (5 
[8.8%] patients). No premature discontinuation for adverse events was recorded. 
Baseline data: For patients aged ≤18 years: The pediatric patient population included similar 
proportions of males and females, with a mean age of 9.8 years (range 2 to 18 years). The majority of 
patients aged ≤18 years of age were White (54.4%) or Asian (31.6%) and most patients were 
recruited from Russia (17 [29.8%,] patients), China (15 [26.3%] patients) and Tunisia (10 [17.5%] 
patients).  The majority had a diagnosis of aplastic anemia (30 [52.6%] patients), followed by beta-
thalassemia major (9 [15.8%] patients), and other anemias (7 [12.3%] patients). Only 4 (7.0%) 
patients aged ≤18 years had a primary diagnosis of MDS. Overall, 36.8% (21/57) patients ≤18 years 
were assessed as having iron overload during the study. A greater proportion of patients aged ≤18 
years receiving iron chelator (57.1% [17/28 patients]) had iron overload than patients aged ≤18 years 
not treated with iron chelator (13.8% [4/29 patients]). Time-to-event variables were difficult to 
interpret due to the low numbers of patients ≤18 years of age. The majority of patients aged ≤18 
years had a KPS score of 70 or above at each visit, and no overall difference in patient KPS scores was 
observed following treatment with an iron chelator or across the different countries who participated in 
the registry. The data from the early visits show that overall, drug therapy plus an erythrocyte 
transfusion and erythrocyte transfusion alone were being used as the treatment options of choice at 
study entry. 
Concomitant diseases reported by ≥10% of patients aged ≤18 years during at least one visit were: 
other (China, Morocco, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan, Tunisia, Turkey), liver disease 
(Russia, South Korea), renal disease (Russia), diabetes mellitus (Turkey,) cardiac insufficiency 
(Turkey), and ophthalmic conditions (Russia, South Africa). No apparent differences were observed 
between countries with regards to the type or frequency of concomitant disease reported. Concomitant 
medications were taken by 28 (100%) patients aged ≤18 years receiving iron chelator (4 of whom 
were receiving drug therapy, 13 receiving erythrocyte transfusion and 12 receiving drug therapy and 
erythrocyte transfusion). Concomitant medications were taken by 25 (86.2%) patients aged ≤18 years 
not receiving iron chelator (8 of whom were receiving drug therapy, 7 receiving erythrocyte transfusion 
and 10 receiving drug therapy and erythrocyte transfusion). Overall, concomitant medications were 
taken by a higher proportion of patients aged ≤18 years receiving iron chelator treatment, and those 
receiving treatment with drug therapy and erythrocyte transfusion. 
Efficacy results  
According to the MAH, 29.4% (166/564) patients were assessed as having IOL during the study. 
No specific analyses of the efficacy in paediatric patients have been conducted according to the iron 
chelation therapy. 
Safety results: Overall, 18 (31.6%) patients ≤18 years of age in the study reported AEs, and AE 
rates appeared lower in patients not treated with an iron chelator. Of the 28 patients ≤18 years of age 
treated with an iron chelator, 14 (50%) reported at least one AE; 3 (10.7%) had AEs that were 
considered related to transfusion (erythrocyte and iron chelator transfusion). Of the 29 patients ≤18 
years of age not treated with an iron chelator, 4 (13.8%) experienced an AE; 1 (3.5%) patient had AEs 
that were considered related to transfusion. During the study 5 (8.8%) patients aged ≤18 years died:  
2/28 (7.1%) of whom were receiving iron chelator and 3/29 (10.3%) were not receiving iron chelator).

Five (8.8%) patients experienced SAEs, a similar number of which were reported by patients treated 
with iron chelator (3 [10.7%]) than not treated with iron chelator (2 [6.9%]). All SAEs reported in 
patients aged ≤18 years occurred as single occurrences in the study. Hematology, clinical chemistry, 
vital signs, ECG and other investigations did not reveal any clinically relevant trends. 
CHMP’s comments: 
In this observational study, all patients did not receive Exjade: 203/564 patients in total were treated 
with unspecified iron chelation therapy. 
This study did not report any efficacy results presented separately according to the iron chelation 
therapy. 
The collection of safety data was part of the secondary objectives of this study. Pediatric safety data 
were presented separately. This study included 57 pediatric patients, among them 28 were treated 
with iron chelators. Furthermore, only 17 patients/28 chelated patients had iron overload. However it 
was not possible for us to identify the drug used for iron chelation in these 28 children. Under these 
conditions, the pediatric safety data cannot be attributed to deferasirox and are irrelevant.  
2.3.2.2.11. Study number CICL670ATW01: Single-arm, Observational, Safety Evaluation of Exjade 
in Patients with Transfusion Hemosiderosis 
Description: The study employs a prospective, single-arm, multi-center observational non-
interventional trial design. The study was designed to collect the safety and efficacy data during 2 
years treatment with Exjade® in target patient population of 200-300 thalassemia patients presenting 
with evidence of transfusion induced iron overload. Due to the non-comparative design of the study, 
randomization as well as blinding was not applicable. 
Methods: 
Objectives: To evaluate the safety profile of Exjade® in thalassemia treated for 2 years. 
Study design: Single arm, multi-center, open-label, Phase IV, non-comparative, observational study 
Study period: 13-Jan-2009 to 9-Dec-2011 
Study population/Sample size: A total of 127 subjects in Taiwan. 
Inclusion Criteria 
1. Patients who were diagnosed of thalassemia with chronic iron overload due to blood transfusion that 
were either naïve or previously treated with chelation therapy agent(s). 
2. Patients of either gender or age ≥ 2 years old. 
3. Patients or guardians had signed the inform consent form (ICF). 
Treatments: Exjade® (deferasirox) tablets were administered according to package insert and 
requirement for transfusional overload. The Exjade® dose was recommended to be administered 
according to package insert once daily with starting dose of 20 to 30 mg/kg/day in patients with 
thalassemia. Treatment duration: 96 weeks. The starting Exjade dose for all enrolled patients was 
made according to individual investigator’s judgement.

Outcomes/endpoints: Safety assessments performed in all patients consisted of monitoring and 
recording all adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) related to Exjade® use. 
The assessment of safety was based mainly on the frequency of adverse events. A summary of 
clinically relevant toxic events, i.e., adverse events leading to death or are serious, those with a 
suspected relationship to study medication, those leading to study drug adjustment, interruption or 
discontinuation or adverse events requiring further medication or non-drug therapies were provided. 
Hematology (included Hemoglobin, peripheral blood (WBC, differential, RBC, platelets)), blood 
chemistry (included serum creatinine, AST, ALT and urine exams) and vital signs (included height, 
body weight, sitting pulse and blood pressure) were followed. It was recommended that auditory and 
ophthalmic testing (including fundoscopy) should be performed before the start of Exjade® treatment 
and at regular intervals thereafter (every 6 months). A criteria for evaluation of efficacy was also 
collected: the percent change in serum ferritin level from baseline. Serum ferritin levels and value 
categories were summarized at baseline, each visit and end of study. 
Statistical methods: The objectives of this trial were to evaluate the safety and change of serum 
ferritin of patients with administration of Exjade®. Exploratory analyses were performed using 
descriptive statistics. All statistical analyses were using a two-sided test at the 0.05 level of 
significance. Data from all study centers was pooled for central analysis. 
Results: 
Recruitment/ Number analysed: A total of 127 subjects were enrolled from 8 centers in this study. 
105 (82.7%) patients completed the study and 22 (17.3%) withdrew from the study: Fourteen 
subjects (11.0%) withdrew their consents while 3 subjects (2.4%) terminated the study prematurely 
due to adverse events. The adverse events (drug related) led to study withdrawal included diarrhea, 
stomachache, and Fanconi syndrome. Two subjects (1.6%) discontinued the study because of 
unsatisfactory therapeutic effect, and 1 subject (0.8%) was lost to follow-up. One subject dropped out 
from the study due to death (acute heart failure) and one subject due to abnormal laboratory value 
(increased serum creatinine drug related). 
Baseline data: The number of male and female was 64 and 63 of the study. The average age at 
enrollment was 21.94 years old, in the range of 2.04 to 69.83. 
55 patients < 20 years were included: 31 males, 24 females, median age 15.8 years, 8 children (2-12 
years old) and 47 adolescents (12-<20 years old). For patients < 20 years old: 47 had a beta-
thalassemia major, 2 a beta-thalassemia intermedia and 6 an alpha-thalassemia. 50 (90.91%) of them 
have already been treated with deferasirox, 4 (7.27%) with deferoxamine and deferiprone and 
1(1.82%) with deferiprone. The most frequently reported medical condition was osteoporosis (9 – 
16.36%), hypogonadism (4 – 7.27%), rhinitis allergic (4 – 7.27%), growth retardation (3- 5.45%), 
diabetes mellitus (2- 3.63%), splenomegaly (2 – 3.63%), deafness neurosensory (2 -3.63%)… 
Exjade was the main last chelation therapy before enrolment (50). Duration of receiving transfusion 
therapy was 13.16±4.45 years, ranging from 1 to 19 years. During the last year, the mean transfusion 
number was 19.02±5.14 while the mean total amount of transfusion during the last year was 
10993.8±4230.2 mL. No data about initiation dose or regimen dose or duration of deferasirox 
treatment was presented separately for paediatric population.

Efficacy results 
Among the 55 subjects with age less than 20 years old, the geometric mean ferritin level at baseline 
and at month 24 was 1567.7 ng/ml and 1363.4 ng/ml, respectively. The geometric mean ratio had 
significant changes at month 2, 4, 7, 8, 9 ,16 , 17, and month 18, but the geometric mean ratio at 
month 24 was 0.93 without significance (p=0.3831). The number of increase and decrease of ferritin 
category were the same (11 subjects) at month 24. The percentage of subjects with ferritin level less 
than 1000 ng/mL reduced from 34.55% at baseline to 27.66% at month 24.  
By contrast, for the 72 subjects aged 20 or more, the geometric mean ferritin level changed from 
2622.8 ng/ml at baseline to 1672.3 ng/ml at month 24. Significant changes were obtained for the 
geometric mean ratio at month 2, 4, 5, and since month 7. The geometric mean ratio at month 24 was 
0.69 with significance (p<0.0001). For the 72 subjects with age greater than or equal to 20 years old, 
the number of reduction (23 subjects) was more than that of increase (9 subjects) in ferritin category. 
The percentage of subjects with ferritin level less than 1000 ng/mL increased from 15.28% at baseline 
to 27.59% at month 24. 
For all subjects, the geometric mean of ferritin level was 2098.8 ng/ml at baseline and decreased to 
1526.2 ng/ml at month 24; the geometric mean ratio from baseline was 0.92 at month 2 with 
statistically significance (p=0.0033) and thereafter significant reduction was observed until the end of 
study for all subjects; at month 24, the geometric mean ratio was 0.79 with p<0.0001. At month 24, 
ferritin category were increased for 20 subjects while 34 subjects decreased the ferritin category from 
baseline. The percentage of subjects with ferritin level less than 1000 ng/mL increased from 23.62% at 
baseline to 27.62% at month 24. 
These results (change of geometric mean ferritin level, number of subjects who improved the ferritin 
category versus those who worsened, change of percentage of subjects with ferritin level less than 
1000 ng/mL) improved more apparently in patients aged 20 or more than patients less than 20 years. 
The geometric mean change from baseline is presented as Figure below (Summary of Geometric Mean 
Profile of Ferritin Level (ng/mL)).

For all subjects, the study also showed that median change in serum ferritin level was related to the 
baseline ferritin level and mean Exjade dose. Baseline ferritin less than 1000 ng/ml with mean Exjade 
daily dose of 20 to 25 mg/kg led to slightly increasing serum ferritin, baseline ferritin 1000 to 2500 
ng/ml with mean Exjade daily dose of 30 mg/kg led to slightly decreased serum ferritin, whereas 
baseline ferritin greater or equal to 2500 ng/ml with mean Exjade daily dose of 35 mg/kg led to 
apparent reductions of serum ferritin values. 
Exjade produced a reduction in serum ferritin level that was related to the dose administered. Baseline 
dose of less than 20 mg/kg were able to maintain serum ferritin, whereas a dose between 20 to 30 
mg/kg slightly decreased serum ferritin and a dose of greater than or equal to 30 mg reduced serum 
ferritin level apparently. 
Safety results  
During the study period, 35 patients (27.56%) reported at least one adverse event related to Exjade®. 
Drug-related AEs led to study drug dosage adjustment, those required further medication, and non-
drug therapy were in 21 (16.54%), 8 (6.30%), and 0 (0.00%) patients, respectively.  
The most frequently experienced drug-related adverse events included abdominal pain upper (7 
patients, 5.51%), diarrhoea (7 patients, 5.51%), gastritis (6 patients, 4.72%), abdominal discomfort 
(4 patients, 3.15%), abdominal pain (3 patients, 2.36%), and nausea (3 patients, 2.36%). Data were 
not presented by age groups. 
There were 7 subjects (5.51%) experienced drug-related serious adverse events, which 5 were aged 
under 20 years: 
- 
- 
Acute gastroenteritis in a young adult patient , with erosions and ulcer scar over gastric fundus 
and cardiac portion were observed during panendoscopy  
A Fanconi syndrome in a young adult patient ; Exjade was permanently discontinued.

A liver abscess in an adolescent  
An urticaria with fever in an adolescent  
A transaminases increase in an adolescent , which was assessed as suspected related to study 
drug and caused temporarily interruption of Exjade®. 
For laboratory profile, statistically significant changes were seen, but the changes were not clinically 
meaningful and most of them resulted from underlying disease status and adverse events. However, 
two subjects suffered from ALT elevation which was assessed as suspected related to study drug and 
one of them reported SAE and interrupted the usage of Exjade® temporarily. Besides, elevated serum 
creatinine was reported as suspect adverse event in 3 subjects and led to study drug dosage 
adjustment or temporary interruption. Deafness neurosensory was reported as suspected adverse 
event in one subject (0.8%). 
CHMP's comments: 
Efficacy data 
The interpretation of the presented data is limited, and the results only have an observational value, 
due to: 
- The lack of paediatric results being analyzed separately, 
- The design of the study: open-label, non-randomized, non-controlled with main limitations including 
potential selection bias, missing data and lack of internal validity.  
As a reminder, the MAH submitted this clinical study report in the context of article 46 of Regulation 
(EC) No1901/2006, as amended, on medicinal products for paediatric use. A clear description of 
patient exposure and dose interruption data done by age group in order to compare paediatric and 
adult population would have been expected. 
Regarding these elements no conclusion in terms of efficacy of deferasirox in paediatric population can 
be drawn. On the contrary, from the data presented above, efficacy in reducing iron overload appears 
to be lower than in adult population. 
In addition, for the overall population, the data suggest that the level of reduction in serum ferritin 
level was proportional to the baseline ferritin level and the mean Exjade dose. At low baseline ferritin 
(less than 1000 ng/ml) and lower Exjade daily dose (20 to 25 mg/kg), serum ferritin is slightly 
increasing. The apparent reduction of serum ferritin values was observed with baseline ferritin greater 
or equal to 2500 ng/ml and a mean Exjade daily dose of 35 mg/kg. 
A subgroup analysis allowing to assess the relationship between ferritin level and exjade dose in the 
pediatric population should be provided.

Except for liver abscess and blood amylase increase, all adverse events reported were expected and 
labelled.  
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion: Deferasirox is an iron chelator indicated for long-term use in the treatment of 
chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions in pediatric patients from 2 years. The first worldwide 
marketing authorization for deferasirox was received on 02-Nov-2005 and it is currently available in 
118 countries including the 28 Member States of the European Union. In this context, the recording of 
safety data about immediate tolerability but also about the long-term safety is necessary. 
In this report, all the studies submitted by Novartis for deferasirox were conducted since February 
2006 and the latest was completed in May 2013. We remind the MAH that, according to the EMA 
website, the MAH should submit the paediatric studies within six months of its completion and 
irrespective whether or not it is part of a PIP (completed/or not yet completed) or whether it is intended 
for submission later on as part of a variation, extension or new stand-alone marketing-authorisation 
application or not. For future studies including paediatric data, the MAH should comply with the EMA 
guideline in terms of submission dates.  
These 15 studies that enrolled pediatric patients (defined as patients aged < 18 years) were submitted: 
4 interventional and 11 observational. None of them was designed specifically to collect pediatric safety 
data. However according to the guideline for Article 46, "studies should be submitted regardless of the 
region where they performed, the aim, outcome, population studied or indication". In interventional 
studies, 66 pediatric patients were enrolled on 223 total patients. In observational studies, 396 
pediatric patients were enrolled on 7709 total patients. Therefore, the proportion of paediatric patients 
enrolled in the above-mentioned studies varied from 1.3 % to 41.9 %. 
Efficacy results 
Various parameters were used in the interventional or non-interventional presented studies to measure 
efficacy, such as change from baseline in regular time intervals in cardiac iron overload (by using 
myocardial MRI T2*), cardiac function endpoints (LVEF), liver iron concentration (by using liver MRI 
T2*), serum ferritin, transferrin saturation. These are acceptable variables. Two studies did not report 
any efficacy information (CICL670BR01 and CICL670TR01). 
In the four interventional studies, various efficacy results were presented but the results on the 
paediatric patients were not presented separately. Similarly, in the 11 non-interventional studies 
identified, various efficacy results were presented but only limited efficacy data on paediatric patients 
were analyzed and reported separately: with the exception of four studies (CICL670AGR01, 
CICL670AIC02, CICL670ATR01 and CICL670ATW01), no specific analyses of the efficacy in paediatric 
patients have been conducted. 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/CHMP/763315/2016   
Page 76/98 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Only two studies are therefore considered to be relevant for the analysis of efficacy in paediatric 
patients: CICL670AGR01 and CICL670ATW01, for the reasons explained above (all patients did not 
receive Exjade in CICL670AIC02 and CICL670ATR01, without results provided separately according to 
the iron chelation therapy). 
The interpretation of the presented data in both studies (CICL670AGR01 and CICL670ATW01) is 
limited, and the results only have an observational value, due to: 
- The modest number of children enrolled (24 in CICL670AGR01 and 55 in CICL670ATW01), 
- The lack of paediatric results being analyzed separately, 
- The design of the studies: open-label, non-randomized, non-controlled with main limitations including 
potential selection bias, missing data and lack of internal validity.  
As a reminder, the MAH submitted this clinical study report in the context of article 46 of Regulation 
(EC) No1901/2006, as amended, on medicinal products for paediatric use. A clear description of 
patient exposure and dose interruption data done by age group in order to compare paediatric and 
adult population would have been expected. 
Regarding these elements no conclusion in terms of efficacy of deferasirox in paediatric population can 
be drawn. On the contrary, from the data presented above, efficacy in reducing iron overload appears 
to be lower than in adult population. 
Safety results 
Post-marketing surveillance studies were available: A1401 (Japan), ADE-04 and ADE-05 (Germany) 
and AKR01 (Korea). In some studies (AGR01, ASE01 and ATW01), the evaluation of the safety of 
treatment with Exjade was part of the primary objectives. The assessment of the safety and tolerability 
or acceptability of deferasirox was included in the secondary objectives for studies number: AAU01, 
ABR03, ARU01, AUS04, ATR01. The evaluation of safety data was not planned in the latest studies:  
A2418, ABR01, AIC02. 
In the twelve studies with available safety data, separate pediatric safety results were provided for 
three studies only (A1401, AGR01 and ATR01) and for a limited number of patients with different cut 
off of age: 40 patients under 15 years in A1401 and 24 less 16 years for AGR01 and 57 patients aged 
≤18 years for ATR01. Furthermore regarding the ATR01, only 28 pediatric patients / 57 were treated 
by iron chelator, but without specification of the used drug. The largest number of pediatric patients 
(209 patients) was recorded in the AKR01 study but only the synopsis was submitted and no detail 
about safety data was available. Finally, in the global pediatric population we found only 70 drug 
related adverse events and 10 serious drug related adverse events. The drug related adverse events 
(DRAEs) reported in the pediatric population were: gastrointestinal disorders, renal disorders, 
investigations disorders, liver disorders, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders. Fanconi syndrome is found in two pediatric patients in two different 
studies (ATW01, AUS04). We noticed that no data is provided about the follow up of ear and eye 
disorders in children, either about growth and sexual development disorders (excepted in study 
number AGR01). These sparse safety data did not found unexpected and unlabeled adverse effects 
(excepted one case of rectal prolapse and liver abscess and blood amylase increased), but the number 
of patients was too small to detect rare and unexpected adverse drug reactions. This drug is now 
marketed for 10 years and no pediatric cohort study was performed by the MAH. In these conditions, 
the submitted data are too limited to describe the pediatric safety profile of deferasirox and to justify 
an amendment of the product information.

A rapid research in the medical literature is found that some authors are interested to the pediatric 
safety of deferasirox:  
- 
- 
renal safety in child [Chuang GT, et aL. Transfusion-dependent thalassemic patients with renal 
Fanconi syndrome due to deferasirox use. Nephrology (Carlton). 2015],  
endocrine function and bone disease during long-term chelation therapy with deferasirox in 
patients with Beta-thalassemia major [Casale M et aL.  Endocrine function and bone disease during 
long-term chelation therapy with deferasirox in patients with β-thalassemia major. Am J Hematol. 
2014],  
- 
or efficacy and safety of the combination of two oral chelators deferasirox (DFX)/deferiprone (DFP) 
over deferoxamine.(DFO)/deferiprone in severely iron overload young beta-thalassemia major 
patients [Elalfy MS, et aL. Efficacy and safety of a novel combination of two oral chelators 
deferasirox/deferiprone over deferoxamine/deferiprone in severely iron overloaded young beta 
thalassemia major patients. Eur J Haematol. 2015],  
- 
follow up for a period of 36 months of the first 50 children (age 2-18 yrs) with thalassemia major 
who started deferasirox [Dhamija M et aL. Deferasirox in Indian children with thalassemia major: 3 
years experience. Indian J Med Paediatr Oncol. 2013]…   
These topics and studies are interesting and must be investigated by the MAH to progress in the 
description of the safety profile in children: to specify the pediatric renal or hepatic safety, the 
occurrence of eye and ear disorders in chronically treated children and to evaluate the long-term safety 
on the growth and the endocrine function (although the latter are also affected by iron overload), and 
the combination of iron chelators.  
In conclusion, this drug is on the market since 10 years without any major changes in formulation and 
use. An extension of indications was approved in EU in November 2012 for the treatment of chronic 
iron overload requiring chelation therapy in patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia 
syndromes aged 10 years and older. This new indication included also pediatric population. The 
submitted safety data are old and should have already taken into account during the regular 
assessment of PSURs. The data provided by the MAH in this report are insufficient and inadequate to 
describe specifically the safety profile in the pediatric population. 
Recommendation  
  Not fulfilled: 
Firstly, we remind that, according to the EMA website, the MAH should submit the paediatric studies 
within six months of its completion and irrespective whether or not it is part of a PIP (completed/or not 
yet completed) or whether it is intended for submission later on as part of a variation, extension or new 
stand-alone marketing-authorisation application or not. For future studies including paediatric data, the 
MAH should comply with the EMA guideline in terms of submission dates.  
Secondly, based on the data submitted, the safety profile and the efficacy of Exjade in pediatric 
population cannot be correctly analysed as the MAH has not distinguished the paediatric data 
separately for subgroups of children and adolescents as part of this procedure. The MAH should 
consider such presentation for future studies submitted in accordance with article 46 of regulation (EC) 
No 1901/2006, as amended.

It would be necessary to request to the MAH to provide pediatric results for safety and for efficacy 
separately for all studies and distinguish safety and efficacy data for subgroups of children and 
adolescents as part of this procedure. However, the number of children enrolled are too small to 
conclude in most studies. Therefore, in adopting a pragmatic approach, we consider that the MAH 
should provide an analysis specifically for the paediatric population 
• 
• 
From study CICL670ATW01, for efficacy data : a subgroup analysis allowing to assess the 
relationship between ferritin level and exjade dose in the pediatric population should be

presenting with transfusion induced iron overload. Patients were treated with deferasirox in accordance 
with the local deferasirox prescribing information. The study was conducted in Taiwan from 13-Jan-
2009 to 9-Dec-2011 and a total of 127 subjects were enrolled from 8 centers. 
Of those, 40 (31.4%) were paediatric patients with mean (SD) age of 13.5 (3.9) years at the study 
entry. The majority of the patients were diagnosed with Beta-thalassemia major 34 (85%), followed by 
Alpha-thalassemia 5 (12.5%) and Beta-thalassemia intermedia 1 (2.50%). Mean (SD) transfusion 
number during the last year prior the enrollment was 18.05 (4.89). The mean dose was 25.2 mg/kg 
/day and the majority of the patients (70%) were treated with <30 mg/kg/day. 
At the study entry there were 14 (35%) patients who had serum ferritin (SF) <1000 μg/L (mean (SD) 
SF 776.1 (150)), 16 (40%) with serum ferritin between 1000 and 2500 μg/L (mean (SD) SF 1718.9 
(455.1)), and 10 (25%) patients with serum ferritin greater than 2500 μg/L (mean (SD) SF 3804.2 
(1661.2)). 
Overall in the paediatric population, serum ferritin level decreased from mean (SD) baseline of 1910.2 
(1456.2) μg/L to 1568.3 (1057.4) μg/L at month 24. For 12 (30%) patients treated with <20 mg/kg 
(mean dose 15.8 mg/kg), the mean (SD) serum ferritin was reduced from 1338.8 (915.1) μg/L at 
baseline to 1107.2 (624.1) μg/L at the end of study. For 16 (40%) patients treated with 20-30 mg/kg 
(mean dose 25.5 mg/kg) the mean (SD) serum ferritin decreased from 2021.6 (1177.0) μg/L at 
baseline to 1630.6 (1257.1) μg/L at the end of study; whereas for 12 (30%) patients receiving >30 
mg/kg (mean dose 34.3 mg/kg), the mean (SD) serum ferritin was reduced from 2333.3 (2054.9) 
μg/L to 1896.0 (1004.4) μg/L. It appears that all three deferasirox dose categories showed a reduction 
in serum ferritin levels. Notably, changes in mean (SD) serum ferritin from baseline to the end of study 
were similar in patients receiving 20 to 30 mg/kg/day [-372.8(1494.3)] and > 30mg/kg/day[-
446.3(1568.1)] whereas a change in patients receiving <20 mg/kg/day was [- 76.0(1182.2)]  
When the response was analyzed by serum ferritin levels at baseline: <1000 μg/L, 1000 –2500 μg/L 
and ≥2500 μg/L, the greatest numerical reduction in mean (SD) serum ferritin from 3804.6 (1661.2) 
μg/L at baseline to 2091.2 (1693.4) μg/L at the end of study was observed in the patients who entered 
the study with ≥2500 μg/L (Figure 1-1). This was achieved with mean (SD) dose of 28 (7.9) 
mg/kg/day.

Furthermore, in patients who entered the study with baseline serum ferritin levels between 1000 and 
2500 μg/L, the mean (SD) serum ferritin level 1719 (897.6) μg/L remained unchanged at the study 
end. The mean (SD) dose for this category was 29.7 (8.5) mg/kg/day. On the contrary, patients with 
baseline serum ferritin level <1000 μg/L who were treated with a mean (SD) dose 20.9 (6.6) 
mg/kg/day had a slight increase in mean (SD) serum ferritin from baseline 776.1 (150) μg/L to 1086.1 
(528.4) μg/L at the study end. This suggests that a dose increase of deferasirox may be needed to 
maintain serum ferritin below a recommended level of 1000 μg/L. 
Of note, serum ferritin is an acute state reactant and some non-clinically significant fluctuation may be 
observed between visits. Statistical Analysis Tables are provided in [Appendix 1]. 
In summary, these findings should be interpreted with considerable caution, as they derived from an 
observational study in which the number of patients in each category is rather small to draw a 
meaningful conclusion on a relationship between serum ferritin and deferasirox dose. Additionally, 
compliance was not monitored in this study and some serum ferritin levels were not collected at the 
study visit, making the interpretation of the findings challenging. 
CHMP’s comment 
The MAH provided a subgroup analysis to assess the relationship between ferritin level baseline and 
Exjade dose in the pediatric population. However, activity of deferasirox remains unclear in patients 
who had SF <1000 µg/l at baseline. The MAH suggest that a dose increase of deferasirox may be 
needed to maintain SF below a recommended level of <1000 µg/l. The design of this study could not 
allow to draw firm conclusions about the interest of a deferasirox treatment and/or the dose needed in 
this study population. However, new efficacy data in children aged 2 to less than 6 years at enrolment 
with transfusional hemosiderosis treated with deferasirox will be assessed in the frame of the variation 
II-48.

Point solved  
Question 2: 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should provide an analysis specifically for the 
paediatric population from study CICL670AKR01 for safety data: a subgroup analysis with 
children and adolescents. Indeed, this study contains the largest population of children 
(n=209 children aged between 2 and <12 years-old and probably more between 12 and 18 
years-old). 
MAH’s Response 
CICL670AKR01 is an open-label, multicenter, single-arm, observational post-marketing surveillance 
conducted for 6 years, from 31 March 2006 to 30 March 2012. Study doctors enrolled patients with 
transfusion dependent hemosiderosis who had received at least one dose of deferasirox. 
Background: 
A total of 1,579 patients were enrolled in the study. Of those, 363 (23%) were pediatric patients <18 
years of age. The mean age of the paediatric patients was 9.51 ± 4.7 years. Within this population, 
underlying diseases were reported in 264 patients (72.7%). The majority of the patients were 
diagnosed with other neoplasms 129 (35.5%), followed by other diseases, acute lymphocytic leukemia 
(ALL) and aplastic anaemia (AA) [58 (16%), 39 (10.7%), and 34 (9.4%)] respectively ([Appendix 2] 
Table 13.1). 
Within the paediatric population, 309 (85.1%) patients were treated with concomitant medication. The 
most commonly used medication by class was anti-infectives for systemic use (199; 64% patients), 
followed by antineoplastics agents (143; 46.2% patients), and cardiovascular system and blood and 
blood forming organs (134; 43.3% patients). During the study, 152 (41.8%) pediatric patients 
discontinued treatment with deferasirox. Of those, 75 (49.3%) patients discontinued due to reasons 
reported as ‘others”, 44 (28.9%) due to “adverse events”, 18 (11.8%) due to “improvement”, 8 
(5.3%) due to “lack of efficacy” and 8 (5.3%) due to “lost to follow up”. Although, the treatment 
discontinuation was somewhat high, one should not exclude the impact of confounding factors 
including underlying hematological malignancies and concomitant use of chemotherapy. 
The mean daily dose of deferasirox was 635.92 ± 333.06 mg. Most of the patients (41.9%) were 
treated with a daily dose between 500 mg and 1000 mg. The overall mean duration of exposure was 
130.1 ± 133.2 days, with 263 (72.5%) patients receiving at least 6 months of treatment. 
For 344 evaluable paediatric patients, the mean serum ferritin was reduced from 2,346 μg/L at 
baseline to 1,670 μg/L at the end of study. The mean decrease of 676.6 μg/L was statistically 
significant (p < 0.001). 
Overall adverse events 
Overall, there were 175 (48.2%) pediatric patients with at least one adverse event (AE) regardless of 
study drug relationship. A total of 372 events were experienced by these 175 pediatric patients. The 
most commonly affected primary SOCs were Blood and lymphatic system disorders (83 patients; 
22.9%), Gastrointestinal disorders (48 patients; 13.2%) followed by Investigations (37 patients; 
10.2%). The most frequently AEs reported by ≥3% of patients by preferred term were febrile 
neutropenia 62 (17.1%), neutropenia 29 (8%), alanine aminotransferase increased (ALT) 24(6.6%),

aspartate aminotransferase increased (AST) 22(6.1%), vomiting 19 (5.2%), rash 13 (3.6%), nausea, 
pyrexia and diarrhea (12; 3.31% each), upper respiratory tract infection 11(3%). Notably, 163 ( 
93.1%) of 175 patients with AEs were receiving concomitant medication. Of those, 112 (68.7%) 
patients were treated with antiinfective and systemic use, 96 (58.7%) were treated with antineoplastic 
agents and 94 (57.7%) were treated with cardiovascular system and blood and blood forming organs 
([Appendix 2] - Table 34). 
The majority of AEs were classified as mild in severity (263 events, 70.7%), followed by moderate 
(102 events, 27.4%) and severe (7 events, 1.9%) ([Appendix 2] - Table 39). Of the total 372 reported 
AEs, 280 (75.3%) were assessed as unlikely to be related to the study drug, 68 (18.3%) with possible 
relation to the study drug and 13 (3.5%), including vomiting 6, rash 3, gastrointestinal disorder (not 
specified), blood creatinine increased, liver function test abnormal, metabolic acidosis (1; each), with 
probable/likely relation. Only one (0.27%) AE, rash, was assessed as being certainly related to the 
study drug. Causality assessment of 10 (2.7%) AEs were conditional/unclassified. ([Appendix 2]- Table 
45 and 46)  
The most common actions taken for AE management were Medical/Non-medical treatment 225 
(60.5%), permanent discontinuation 44 (11.9%) and dose modification/temporary discontinuation 29 
(7.8%). Of note, 54 (14.5%) patients with AEs did not require any actions. ([Appendix 2]- Table 41). 
Importantly, resolution was reported for the great majority of the AEs, 340 (91.4%). Whereas the 
resolution was not reported by the end of observation for 11 AEs (2.9%), including gastrointestinal 
disorder (not specified), blood creatinine increased, febrile neutropenia, encephalitis, tumour pain, ear 
pain, retinal haemorrage, deafness neurosensory, diabetes insipidus, and proteinurea (2). Of note, 17 
(4.6%) AEs were reported as improving at the study end. Four (1.1%) AEs resulted in fatality in three 
patients during the study ([Appendix 2] - Table 43 and 44). For details please refer to section “Death”. 
All cases of febrile neutropenia 96 (25.8%) and neutropenia 34 (9.1%) were assessed by the 
investigators as unlikely to be related to the study drug. The majority of febrile neutropenia and 
neutropenia were assessed as mild in severity; 69 (71.8%) and 32 (94.1%) respectively. 
Of all cases, only one of febrile neutropenia was not resolved at the study end. Importantly, 
considering underlying diseases (e.g. ALL) it is not uncommon to observe neutropenia or febrile 
neutropenia in this population, especially in patients with hematologic malignancies. 
Moreover, the effect of concomitant use of antineoplastic agents cannot be rule out since neutropenia, 
resulting from cytotoxic chemotherapy is the most common risk factor for severe infections in 
hematological malignancies. 
All cases of elevated ALTs 27 (7.2 %) and ASTs 24 (6.4%) were assessed as mild and moderate in 
severity but one patient demonstrated one ALT and one AST AE which were assessed as severe. The 
majority of ALT 14 (51.9%) and AST 13 (54.7%) increased AEs were assessed by the investigators as 
unlikely to be related to the study drug. For the rest of these events, possible relationship to 
deferasirox was reported. At the study end, greater majority of patients with ALT and AST increased 
AEs recovered from the events and only 3 of each were reported as being in a recovering stage. No 
patients with ALT and AST increased AEs were reported by the investigators as not being recovered 
from the events ([Appendix 2] - Table 40, 44 and 46). 
Of total 13(3.4%) cases of rash, 12 were assessed by the investigators as mild and one as moderate in 
severity. Of those, 5 events were assessed with possible relationship to the study drug, 4 with unlikely 
relationship to the study drug, 3 with probable/likely and only one case was assessed as having a 
certain relationship to the study drug. Importantly, all patients recovered from the event but one who

was in a recovering stage at the study end. Of total 175 patients with AEs, 65 (17.9%) were reported 
to have at least one AE suspected to be related to deferasirox, referred to as Adverse Drug Reactions 
in the study report. Within the study, total of 92 events were experienced by 65 patients. Of those, 
most frequent AEs reported by >2% of patients were 12(3.3%) vomiting, 11(3%) ALT increased, 10 
(2.8% each) AST increased and nausea, and 9 (2.5%) rash. 
Overall, 104 (28.6%) of pediatric patients experienced at least one AE during the study that was 
“unexpected”, meaning that the event term was not specifically listed in the applicable reference safety 
information. The most commonly affected primary system organ classes were Blood and lymphatic 
system disorders (63 patients; 17.4%), followed by Infections & infestations (26 patients; 7.2%) and 
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (11 patients; 3%). The most frequent unexpected AEs 
(≥3% of patients) by preferred terms were febrile neutropenia 62 (17.1%), and upper respiratory 
track infection 11 (3%). There were 184 of these events in these cases, of which 14 AEs (3.86% of the 
total event count in the paediatric population) were suspected to be related to study drug, due to a 
“possible” relationship: otitis media, 2 blood urea increased, 2 cough, 2 upper respiratory infection, 
paraesthesia, weight decrease, decrease appetite, folliculitis, hyperbillirubinaemia, metabolic acidosis, 
blood bilirubin increased. Eleven were classified as mild and three (otitis media, weight decrease and 
metabolic acidosis) as moderate in severity, and all patients recovered from the events. None of these 
events were reported to be certainly related to the study drug.  
One of them (otitis media) was reported as an SAE, see below. 
SAE: 
Serious adverse events (SAEs), irrespective of relationship to deferasirox treatment, were reported in 
18 (4.96%) patients. Overall, these 18 patients experienced 21 SAEs during the study. The most 
commonly SAEs were in the following System Organ Class (SOC): Infections and infestations (7 
patients; 1.9%) patients, General disorders and administration site conditions (4 patients; 1.1%) 
patients, followed by Gastrointestinal disorders (3 patients; 0.8%) patients. The rate (1; 0.28%) at 
which SAEs by preferred terms occurred was consistent for all reported events but for disease 
progression (2; 0.55%). For details on SAEs’ rate and frequency by preferred terms please refer to the 
[Appendix 2] - Table 20. 
All SAEs, but one (0.28%) Otitis Media were assessed as unlikely to be related to the study drug. The 
case of Otitis Media was reported as Serious Adverse Drug Reaction (SADR) with a possible 
relationship to the study drug. Of note, the patient recovered after treatment interruption and 
subsequently continued deferasirox. 
The majority of SAEs were classified as moderate in severity ([Appendix 2] - Table 21) and all patients 
recovered except for three who died during the study (see details below). 
Deaths: 
Three pediatric patients died during the observational study period. None of the deaths were suspected 
to be related to deferasirox. Brief narratives of the cases are provided below. Each of the three 
patients had underlying malignant tumours. In the third case, the cause of death was septic shock and 
there is limited information on underlying risk factors and treatment dates with deferasirox. For details 
please refer to [Appendix 3]. 
 A paediatric patient, treated with deferasirox, had a medical history of Ewing’s sarcoma. The patient 
was also treated with concomitant medications included etoposide and thiotepa. Multiple metastatic 
lesions were reported with thoracic and brain MRI. The outcome of the Ewing sarcoma disease

progression was reported as death. Deferasirox treatment was stopped approximately two weeks prior 
to the fatal event. The causality of the event was not suspected to be related to deferasirox.  
 A paediatric patient who had a medical history of malignant peripheral nerve sheath. The patient 
was treated with deferasirox as well as concomitant medication included carboplatin and ifosfamide. 
On Positron emission tomography (PET), malignant mass in the mediastinal was noted, suggesting 
disease progression. The patient died approximately 2 months later after deferasirox treatment was 
discontinued. The causality was reported as not suspected to deferasirox. 
 An paediatric patient with medical history that included neuroblastoma received deferasirox for iron 
overload. On an unknown date, gram-negative rods were isolated in blood culture. Patient developed 
septic shock and died due to the event. During the event the patient was treated with an inotropic 
drug. The causality for the event was assessed as not suspected to deferasirox by the investigator. 
Summary: 
According to the MAH, the limitation of this study was related to its design as a single arm 
observational study which did not impose a therapy protocol or diagnostic/therapeutic interventions. 
Moreover, some of the clinical data and details of underlying diseases were not available for collection.  
Less than half of the 368 pediatric patients in the study (48.2%) experienced an AE during the 
observation period. Overall, the majority of AEs were mild in severity and were assessed by the 
investigators as unlikely to be related to the study drug. 
Fourteen patients had AEs suspected to be related to study drug and “unexpected” according to the 
reference safety information, but these were mostly mild in severity and the relationship to deferasirox 
was not conclusive. 
Importantly, greater majority of patients who presented with AEs, including ALT and AST increased, 
recovered or were recovering from the events within the study. No renal safety concerns were 
observed in this observational study. Only one patient with creatinine increased did not recover by the 
end of the study period. None of the events of febrile neutropenia and neutropenia were related to the 
study drug. 
It is also important to highlight that causality of these events should be interpreted with caution as the 
presence of underlying disease and its complications as well as concomitant administration of multiple 
medications make the assessment is rather challenging. Thus, one cannot be ruled out the effect of 
mentioned confounding factors on these findings. Of all SAEs, only one was reported to be related to 
the study drug. Importantly, the event resolved after treatment interruption and patient continued the 
treatment. No death was suspected to be related to deferasirox as assessed by the investigator. 
Overall, the safety profile of paediatric patients treated with deferasirox was consistent with previous 
reports. 
CHMP’s comment 
This observational study contains only descriptive and non comparative data in real life. 
As requested, the MAH has provided a safety analysis in the paediatric population enrolled in this 
observational study. The total number of paediatric patients is 363 (or 368 in the MAH summary??) 
from 2 to 17 years-old (mean 9.5 +/- 4.72)).  
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/CHMP/763315/2016

A total of 175 paediatric patients reported 372 AEs including 21 SAEs in 18 patients (mainly infections, 
general disorders and GI disorders).  
Fatal cases:  
A total of 3 fatal cases were reported in the paediatric population of this study: 2 due to underlying 
disease progression (metastatic lesions/encephalopathy in a context of Ewing’s sarcoma and malignant 
peripheral nerve sheath) and one due to septic shock. In this last case, the circumstances of 
occurrence of septic shock were not enough detailed to conclude on the role of Exjade. One case of 
otitis media was considered as possibly related to deferasirox (compatible time to onset : 15 days, 
positive dechallenge). However, it seems that no recurrence of otitis media was noted after 
reintroduction of Exjade at the same dose. This case contains too scarce information to conclude on 
this case.  
Among the 184 unexpected AEs (in 104 patients), the main events reported are febrile neutropenia 
(96 AEs) followed by upper respiratory tract infection (11 AEs, all manageable by medical/non medical 
treatment) and cough (6 AEs). A total of 44 patients (29%) discontinued permanently Exjade due to 
AEs (mainly due to liver or renal function tests abnormal and GI disorders). 
The overall safety profile seems to be consistent with the known safety profile of Exjade and 
complications of underlying conditions. However, we consider that additional analysis are requested to 
accurately assess the data from paediatric population as this study contains the largest population of 
children (n=209 with children aged between 2 and <12 years-old) observed in real life conditions:  
Febrile neutropenia 
All events of febrile neutropenia (96 AEs) and neutropenia (34 AEs) were assessed by the investigator 
as unlikely related to deferasirox. Overall, 74 patients (including 62 paediatric patients) experienced 
one or several episodes of neutropenia (mainly were considered as mild – 71.8%). None are reported 
as serious.  
All cases of febrile neutropenia resolved except in one patient. 2 episodes of febrile neutropenia lead to 
permanent discontinuation of Exjade. The majority (95%) were manageable by medical/non medical 
treatment according to the MAH. 
However, the review of this issue by the MAH is not enough reliable as there are problems between the 
definition of events and terms used by the coding system for this same event: agranulocytosis/febrile 
neutropenia (knowing that neutropenia is defined as PNN < 1500 /mm3 and a severe neutropenia 
(<500/mm3) and an agranulocytosis is a severe febrile neutropenia (see also comment in PSUR 14 on 
this issue). The addition of the term “agranulocytosis” in EU SPC should be discussed by the MAH as 
the MAH used widely the term “febrile neutropenia” without clear definition. Also, no data on the mean 
or median PNN level (NADIR) is provided. It seems that there is a discrepancy between the nature of 
the effect and the severity/seriousness reported. 
The underlying disease for all paediatric patients is mentioned in table 13.1 of appendix 2 for 264 
patients (73%) : mainly “other neoplasm” (35.5%), followed by “other disease” (16%), ALL (11%), 
aplastic anemia (9%) and AML (6%). Based on these data, we do not know the exact underlying 
disease for around 80% of patients (289/363) : either not known or “other neoplasm” or “other 
disease”…  The MAH claims that it is not uncommon to observe neutropenia in patients with 
haematological malignancies. However, the MAH has not given relevant  information on the cases in 
their analysis to confirm this hypothesis. We can suppose that as 46.2% of children (143/309) received 
antineoplastic agents (this proportion raised 67.1% (96/143)  if we take the population who had

experienced an adverse effect and as some children experienced several episodes of neutropenia (96 
febrile neutropenia in 62 patients) the MAH hypothesis might be plausible. 
However, due to the high percentage of febrile neutropenia reports in paediatric patients (62/363 ; 
17%) in this observational study, and as peripheral blood cytopenia is an important potential risk in 
the RMP of Exjade and should be closely monitored in upcoming PSURs, and as uncertainties remains 
on the definition taken for neutropenia/febrile neutropenia/agranulocytosis and the above MAH 
hypothesis for causes of neutropenia occurrence, the rapporteur considers that a specific 
comprehensive safety review of this issue (with time to onset, medical history/underlying conditions, 
circumstances of occurrence, risk factors, action taken and therapy given…) should be performed for 
paediatric patients enrolled in this study, especially to put into perspective with the underlying 
conditions of these paediatric patients. Indeed, a large proportion of patients had “other disease” but 
we do not know what sort of disease it concerns). A tabular format could be used and cases narratives 
with details on the PNN level for each case should be provided. In this review, the MAH should discuss 
the discrepancy observed between the nature of the effect and the severity/seriousness reported. 
According to this comprehensive safety review conclusions, the MAH should also discuss the need to 
update the EU SPC (and RMP) considering the overall data on this issue available based on other 
clinical trials, spontaneous reporting and literature data.  
Long term effects 
Of note, a total of 263/363 (72.5%) received Exjade during less than 6 months. Among the 100 
patients receiving Exjade more than 6 months (27.5%), only 32 (32%) received Exjade during more 
than 1 year. A total of 33 patients (67 AEs) were reported to having at least one AE among the 100 
patients receiving more than 6 months of Exjade (33%). Similarly, 8 subjects experienced at least one 
AE among the 32 patients receiving more than 1 year of Exjade (25%). However, we don’t know the 
type of effects occurring after 6 months of treatment. 
As the long term safety in paediatric population (especially in youngest patients: 2-6 years-old) is 
listed as missing information in RMP of Exjade, we consider that the MAH should provide a more 
detailed safety analysis of paediatric patients enrolled in this study receiving Exjade for more than 6 
months (with time to onset, medical history/underlying conditions, circumstances of occurrence, risk 
factors, action taken and therapy given…). 
Of  note,  the  study  planned  to  present  incidence  of  AEs  by  factors  (including  age)  or  AEs  in  special 
population. The objectives now is partially achieved as AEs were analysed for paediatric population but 
the  MAH  has  not  performed  a  sub-analysis  by  age  categories.  As  this  study  contains  the  largest 
population  of  children  (n=209  with  children  aged  between  2  and  <12  years-old)  observed  in  real  life 
conditions the MAH provided a sub analysis of patients by age category: 2-6 years old , 7-12 years-old 
and 13- < 18 years old . 
Similarly,  a  sub-analysis  depending  of  transfusion  status  of  paediatric  patients  should  be  done.  Also, 
the MAH presented safety data depending of the dose of Exjade however, it would be more relevant to 
use dose unit in mg/kg/day (instead of mg/day) to interpret the data. All these 3 subanalysis should 
be performed.  
As a general comment, a clear improvement of the data quality in upcoming documentation is awaited 
to allow accurate assessment of reliable data. Quality check should be performed carefully by the MAH 
to avoid discrepancies in term of numbers of events/cases, identification of duplicates (which should be 
taken into account in review).

Issue partially addressed. 
Question 3 
Also, the MAH should commit to: 
 comply with the EMA guideline in terms of submission dates for future studies including 
paediatric data 
 consider to present paediatric data (efficacy and safety) separately for each future 
studies submitted in accordance with article 46 of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as 
amended. 
MAH’s Response 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 requires that any marketing authorization holder 
sponsored study which involves the use in the paediatric population of a medicinal product covered by 
a marketing authorization in EU, whether or not they are conducted in compliance with an agreed 
paediatric investigation plan, is to be submitted to the competent authority.  
Following a recent inspection finding regarding late reporting of Non-Interventional Studies which 
include paediatric patients, Novartis has prepared a remediation plan to ensure that paediatric data is 
submitted in accordance with Article 46 of the Paediatric Regulation.  
For future submissions, Novartis is committed to make all efforts: 
 to submit the final study report within six months of completion of the studies, which include 
paediatric patients treated with deferasirox and 
 to separately present the efficacy and safety data from paediatric patients treated with deferasirox, 
in all cases where sufficient data are available in paediatric patients. 
CHMP’s comment 
The MAH’s commitments are endorsed. Issue addressed. 
Recommendation  
  Not fulfilled: 
As a general comment, a clear improvement of the data quality in upcoming documentation is awaited 
to allow accurate assessment of reliable data. Quality check should be performed carefully by the MAH 
to avoid discrepancies in term of numbers of events/cases, identification of duplicates (which should be 
taken into account in review). 
In their responses’ document, the MAH committed to make all efforts: 
- 
- 
 to submit the final study report within six months of completion of the studies, which include 
paediatric patients treated with deferasirox and 
 to separately present the efficacy and safety data from paediatric patients treated with 
deferasirox, in all cases where sufficient data are available in paediatric patients.

which is acceptable for the rapporteur. 
Efficacy data requested for study CICL670ATW01 
As requested, the MAH provided a subgroup analysis to assess the relationship between ferritin level 
baseline and Exjade dose in the pediatric population. However, activity of deferasirox remains unclear 
in patients who had SF <1000 µg/l at baseline. The MAH suggest that a dose increase of deferasirox 
may be needed to maintain SF below a recommended level of <1000 µg/l. The design of this study 
could not allow to draw firm conclusions about the interest of a deferasirox treatment and/or the dose 
needed in this study population. However, new efficacy data in children aged 2 to less than 6 years at 
enrollment with transfusional hemosiderosis treated with deferasirox will be assessed in the frame of 
the variation II-48. 
Safety data requested for study CICL670AKR01 
The overall safety profile seems to be consistent with the known safety profile of Exjade and 
complications of underlying conditions in this study. However, we consider that additional analysis 
should be performed by the MAH to accurately assess the data from paediatric population as this study 
contains the largest population of children (n=209 with children aged between 2 and <12 years-old) 
observed in real life conditions (see section IV “Additional clarifications requested”).

3-  Additional analysis (by age categories, by transfusion status and by dose (in mg/kg/day)) 
The study CICL670AKR01 planned to present incidence of AEs by factors (including age) or AEs in 
special population. The objectives now is partially achieved as AEs were analysed for paediatric 
population but the MAH has not performed 3 sub-analysis :  
-  One sub-analysis by age categories:  2-6 years old , 7-12 years-old and 13- < 18 years old . 
-  One sub-analysis by transfusion status  
-  One sub-analysis by dose (in mg/kg/day) 
These 3 sub-analysis should be performed by the MAH. 
The timetable is a 30 day response timetable with clock stop. 
MAH’s responses (submitted in June 2016) 
Question 1 
Due to the high percentage of febrile neutropenia reports in paediatric patients (62/363; 
17%) in this observational study, 
•  as peripheral blood cytopenia is an important potential risk in the risk management 
plan (RMP) of Exjade and should be closely monitored in upcoming periodic safety 
update reports (PSURs), 
•  and as uncertainties remain 
•  on the definition taken for neutropenia/febrile neutropenia/agranulocytosis 
•  and the above marketing authorization holder (MAH) hypothesis for 
causes of neutropenia occurrence, 
the rapporteur considers that a specific comprehensive safety review of this issue (with 
time to onset, medical history/underlying conditions, circumstances of occurrence, risk 
factors, action taken and therapy given…) should be performed for paediatric patients 
enrolled in this study, especially to put into perspective with the underlying conditions of

Summary of MAH’s response 
Although febrile neutropenia was a common adverse event (AE) observed in this trial (62/363; 17%), 
a large confounder factor was observed in 100% of these subjects; all subjects with  febrile 
neutropenia  had  a  pre-existing  neoplasms/cancer  condition  in  association  with antineoplastic, 
cytotoxic treatment.

Patients  with  febrile  neutropenia  received  a  mean  frequency  of  10.28  (±4.21)  transfusions with a 
range between 3 to 20. The mean period of transfusion was 0.74 years (± 1.09) with a range of 0.10 
to 8  years. All patients with documented blood transfusion and febrile neutropenia received less than 
7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells (see Table 2-4). This is  consistent  with  the  assumption

that  most  of  the  children  required  blood  transfusion  in context of their underlying malignant 
disease and/or antineoplastic treatment. 
Deferasirox treatment was permanently discontinued in six subjects (3.59% of the cases). In  17  cases 
(10.18%),  no  actions  were  taken  following the occurrence  of  febrile  neutropenia 
All but one patient recovered from the condition of febrile neutropenia (see Table 2-6). For all cases, 
relationship to study drug was assessed as unlikely (not suspected) 
Cases  narratives  with  details  on  the  polymorphonuclear  neutrophil  counts  (PNN)  level  for each 
case cannot be provided, as the case report form (CRF) of study ICL670AKR01 did not mandate 
collection  of  this  information. 
In study CICL670A2301 ‘International sentinel site surveillance of patients with transfusional 
hemosiderosis treated with Exjade (deferasirox) in actual practice setting’ recently submitted in  the 
context  of  the  type  II  variation  (II-50),  febrile  neutropenia  was  not  reported  in  any of the 66 
pediatric patient aged less than 18 years during the 3-year-observation period. Pediatric patients 
enrolled  in  the  study  had  the  following  underlying  hematologic  diseases:  β- thalassemia  major 
(34  patients,  49.3%);  β-thalassemia  intermedia  (7  patients,  10.1%);  sickle cell  (24  patients, 
34.8%);  diamond-blackfan  anemia  (2  patients,  2.9%)  and  other  (2  patients, 2.9%). 
The  SmPC  adequately  describes  the  reports  of  cytopenias,  leukopenias  and  aggravation  of these 
cytopenias (section 4.4 Warning and Precautions) 
In  conclusion,  the  event  of  febrile  neutropenia  is  not  unexpected  in  this  patient  population with 
neoplasms and treated with cytotoxic agents, as those are important confounding factors known  to 
increase  risk for  febrile  neutropenia. The  current  SmPC and  RMP adequately describe the  risk of 
peripheral blood cytopenias, leukopenias and  aggravation of these cytopenias and no changes to the 
SmPC and RMP are warranted based on these data. 
CHMP’s comment 
The safety review provided shows that all pediatric patients presenting febrile  neutropenia  had  a  pre-
existing  neoplasms/cancer  condition  and were treated with antineoplastic, cytotoxic treatment 
causing neutropenia. The need for frequent transfusion in this population was the consequence of the 
severity of their malignant disease and the use of cytotoxic agents. It remains that the narratives of 
the cases have not been provided, and the numerous tables provided do not allow to have a clear view 
of the medical history and risk factors for neutropenia.  
On the other hand, it is acknowledged that neutropenia in relation to the treatment was rarely 
observed in study CICL670A2301 ‘International sentinel site surveillance of patients with transfusional 
hemosiderosis treated with Exjade (deferasirox) in actual practice setting’ recently submitted in  the 
context  of  the  type  II  variation  (II-50),  and no severe febrile neutropenia was  reported  in  any of the 
66 pediatric patient aged less than 18 years during the 3-year-observation period. Of note, the 
underlying  hematologic  diseases for the pediatric patients  enrolled  in  the  study  w e r e   β- 
thalassemia  and  sickle cell  and diamond-blackfan  anemia.  
In conclusion, even though the febrile neutropenia are likely to be driven by the underlying malignant 
diseases in these pediatric patients, the paucity of the description of these cases cannot allow to 
exclude a role of deferasirox in the aggravation of neutropenia leading to severe neutropenia.

The current wording in the SPC is considered appropriate as soon as the role of deferasirox in 
cytopenia is more precisely described. 
Point solved 
Question 2 
Long term effects 
As the long term safety in paediatric population (especially in youngest patients: 2-6 years-
old) is listed as missing information in RMP of Exjade, we consider that the MAH should 
provide a more detailed safety analysis of paediatric patients enrolled in this study 
CICL670AKR01 receiving Exjade for more than 6 months (with time to onset, medical 
history/underlying conditions, circumstances of occurrence, risk factors, action taken and 
therapy given…). 
Summary of MAH’s response 
Out  of  the  363  paediatric  patients,  100  patients  (27.55%)  were  treated  for  longer  than  24 
weeks;  slightly less patients  in  the  youngest  age  category (24.79%)  and  more  patients  in  the oldest 
age category (29.13%). The  mean  period  of  Exjade  treatment  in  the  100  pediatric  patients  who 
received  deferasirox for longer than 24  weeks  was 299.32  (±140.70) days. More  patients  in  the 
middle  age  category  were treated for a period between 9 to less than 12 months (24.24%) and for 
longer than 12 months (36.36%) compared to in the youngest (20% and 30%, respectively) and in 
the oldest category (18.92% and 29.73%, respectively). 
Out of 100 paediatric patients receiving deferasirox for longer than 24 months, 60 patients had a 
documented  current  medical  condition.  Thirty  patients  (50.00%)  had  diseases  of  the  blood and blood 
forming organs and certain disorders and 28 patients (46.67%) had a neoplasm. 
Forty-six  patients  (62.16%)  who  received  deferasirox  for  longer  than  24  months,  were  also treated 
with systemic anti-infectives (see Table 2-10), similarly to the overall pediatric population where 
64.40% received anti-infectives (see Table 14 of Appendix 2 of first response  to  question).  Less 
patients,  who  were  treated  with  deferasirox  for  longer  than  24 months,  received  cytotoxic  agents 
(37.84%)  and  hematopoeitics  (growth  factors)  (29.73%) compared to the overall pediatric 
population (45.63% and 37.54%, respectively). 
Medical/non-medical treatment was administered in 42 cases (62.69%). In 15 cases (22.39%), no 
actions were taken following occurrence of AE (see Table 2-11). More cases in the middle age  group 
(33.33%)  had  dose  modification  or  temporary  discontinuation  compared  to  the youngest  (0.00%) 
and  oldest  age  category  (3.23%).  Deferasirox  treatment  was  permanently discontinued  in  none  of 
the  patients  treated  for  longer  than  6  months  indicating  that  these patients can remain on 
deferasirox treatment with adequate monitoring. 
In the 100 patients treated for longer than 6 months, deferasirox treatment was never permanently 
discontinued  indicating  that  these  patients  can  remain  on  deferasirox  treatment with adequate 
monitoring.

Treatment conditions, medical conditions, concomitant medications and AE-driven treatment 
adaptations have been analysed according to age categories. 
Question 3 
Additional analysis (by age categories, by transfusion status and by dose (in mg/kg/day)) 
The study CICL670AKR01 planned to present incidence of AEs by factors (including age) or 
AEs in special population. The objectives now is partially achieved as AEs were analysed for 
paediatric population but the MAH has not performed 3 sub-analysis :  
-  One sub-analysis by age categories:  2-6 years old , 7-12 years-old and 13- < 18 years 
old 
-  One sub-analysis by transfusion status  
-  One sub-analysis by dose (in mg/kg/day) 
These 3 sub-analysis should be performed by the MAH. 
Summary of MAH’s response (see MAH response document for more details in Tables)  
Detailed safety analyses by age categories, transfusion status and daily dose are presented as 
follows: 
•  Serious adverse event (SAE)/ serious adverse drug reaction (SADR) 
•  Unexpected AE/adverse drug reaction (ADR) 
•  AE/ADR 
•  Details of AE by severity 
•  Details of AE by outcome 
•  Details of AE by causality 
Analyses by age categories 
The mean age of pediatric patients was 9.51 (± 4.7 years) with a range between 2 to 17 years.  
Analyses were performed for all 363 pediatric patients by age  categories:  
2 ≤ Age < 7 
7 ≤ Age< 13 
13 ≤ Age< 18 
Paediatric  patients  were  evenly  distributed  across  the  3  age  categories  with 33.3%,  31.7%  and 
34.99%  for  the  youngest,  middle  and  oldest  category  respectively. Overall  more  males  (62.26%) 
than  females  (37.74%)  were  enrolled.  The  majority  of  the pediatric  patients  were  diagnosed  with 
oncologic  conditions  such  as  other  neoplasms (35.54%), acute lymphocytic leukemia (10.74%), 
aplastic anaemia (9.37%) and acute myeloid leukemia (6.34%). Treatment discontinuations were 
similar in pediatric patients across age groups with less than half stopping chelation (41.87%). 
Adverse event was cited as reason for Exjade discontinuation  in  28.95%  of  the  cases.  There  were 
relatively  more  discontinuations  due  to AE  (38.78  %)  in  the  oldest  age  category.  In  the  younger 
age  categories,  there  were  more discontinuations  due  to  improvement  (15.69%  in  the  youngest 
and  15.38%  in  the  middle  age category).

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

There were less reports of SAE (3.31%) in the youngest age category compared to the middle 
(6.09%)  and  oldest  (5.51%)  age  groups.  The  incidence  of  unexpected  AE  is  higher  in  the 
youngest  age  group  (35.54%)  than  in  the  middle  (26.09%)  and  oldest  age  group  (24.41%). 
Unexpected  ADR,  AE  and  ADR  were  more  frequent  in  the  oldest  age  group  compared  the youngest 
age groups. Incidence of mild AE was slightly higher in the youngest (73.17%) and oldest (71.43%) 
age group compared to the middle age group (67.24%). Frequency of moderate AEs were 
comparable across age groups. There were more reports of severe AE in the middle age group. In all 
age groups, the vast majority of the AE were considered recovered (overall: 91.40%) or under 
recovery (overall  4.57 %).  In few  cases,  the  patients  did  not  recover  from the  AE  and the 
frequencies were comparable across age groups (overall 2.96%).  
In  the middle  age group, 3 patients  experienced  fatal AEs  (3.45%) and none in the  youngest and 
oldest  age  groups.  None  of  the  deaths  was  suspected  to  be  related  to  deferasirox: 1 case of septic 
shock, 1  case  of  disease  progression, 1  case  of  encephalopathy  and  same  case  of  disease 
progression.  
The causality was assessed as ‘unlikely’ for the majority of the AEs in all age groups (overall 75.27%, 
more frequently in the  youngest age  group) and possible in 18.28% of the cases.  In the oldest age 
group, there were more AE which were assessed as ‘possible’ compared to the youngest age groups. 
Rarely, the causality was assessed as ‘likely’, slightly more frequently in the  youngest  age  and  oldest 
age  groups  (4.88%  and  3.76%)  than  in  the  middle  age  group (1.72%) In the oldest age group, 
the causality for the AE of rash was assessed as certain 
Analyses by transfusion status 
There  were 302 out  of  363  pediatric patients  who  had  documented  transfusions  with  a  mean 
frequency  of  14.22  (±13.69)  and  a  range  between  1 to  188.  The  mean  period  of  transfusion was 
1.77 years (±2.15) with a range of 0.10 to 15 years. The majority of the patients (98.68%) received 
less  than  7 ml/kg/month  of  packed  red  blood  cells.  No  pediatric  patients  received blood 
transfusion  >14  ml/kg/month.  In  the  youngest  and  middle  age  groups,  all  children (100%) 
received less than 7 ml/kg/month and 96.23% (n=102) in the group of oldest pediatric patients. In 
the oldest age category, 4 patients (3.77%) received more than 7 ml/kg/month but less than 14 
ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells. 
Nearly  all  patients  (98.68%)  were  in  the  transfusion  group  of  less  than  7  ml/kg/month.  No patient 
in  the  other  transfusion  categories  experienced  an  SAE,  SADR,  unexpected  AE  or unexpected ADR. 
In the transfusion group of ≥7 to ≤14 ml/kg/month, one AE and one ADR were reported. 
In  the  transfusion  group  of  <7  ml/kg/month,  there  were  more  reports  of  mild  (67.17%)  than 
moderate (30.70%) and severe (2.13%) AEs. In the transfusion group ≥7 to ≤14 ml/kg/month, the 
single AE that was reported was considered as mild.  
In the transfusion group <7 ml/kg/month, the majority of the patients recovered from the AE 
(91.79%);  in  11  cases  (3.34%),  the  patients  did  not  recover  from  the  AE.  The  4  fatal  cases 
described above were in the transfusion group <7 ml/kg/month. In the transfusion group ≥7 to ≤14 
ml/kg/month, the single AE was considered recovered. 
In  the  transfusion  group  <7  ml/kg/month,  the  causality  was  assessed  as  ‘unlikely’for  the 
majority  of  the  AEs  (75.76%). In  the  transfusion  group  ≥7  to  ≤14 ml/kg/month,  the  causality for 
the  AE  of  rash  was  assessed  as  ‘certain’  (see  Table  25.2.2  of Appendix 1) and the severity of the 
rash event was ‘mild’ (see Table 22.2.2 of Appendix 1).

Analyses by dose 
Mean  daily  doses  of  deferasirox  were  similar  between  the  three  age  categories with confidence 
interval widely overlapping between the groups. Patients in the youngest age category received a 
slightly higher median dose (21.63 ± 5.91 mg/kg/d) compared to pediatric patients in the middle  and 
oldest age category  (18.9 ± 5.39 and 18.65 ± 5.47 mg/kg/d respectively).  In  the  youngest  age 
category,  6  patients  (4.96%)  received  daily  doses  higher than 30 mg/kg/d, 2 patients (1.75%) in 
the middle age category and 3 patients (2.36%) in the oldest age category. 
In the youngest age group, 35.54% of patients received DFX dose of 10 to <20 mg/kg/d while 58.68% 
received  20  to <30  mg/kg/d.  Only  1  patient  (0.83%)  received  doses  lower  than 10mg/kg/d.  In 
the  middle  and  oldest  age  group,  more  than  half  of  the  patients  were  treated with  doses of  10  to 
<20  mg/kg/d  (54.39%  and  55.12%,  respectively)  and  approximately one third (37.72 % and 
36.22%, respectively) received doses between 20 to <30 mg/kg/d. In these groups more patients 
received doses below 10 mg/kg/d (6.14% and 6.30%). 
Few patients were treated with doses  <10 and ≥30  mg/kg/day compared to the other  groups. In 
the  groups  of  10  to  <20  and  20 to  <30  mg/kg/day,  the  incidence  of  SAE  was  comparable (5.71 
and  5.00%,  respectively).  There  were  more  report  of  AEs  and  unexpected  AEs  in  the group of  20 
to  <30 mg/kg/day (54.38 and 38.13%)  compared to the  group of  10 to <20 mg/kg/day (44.57 and 
27.71%). 
The majority of the AE were reported as mild (70.70%) except for the group of ≥30 mg/kg/day in 
which  2  events  (66.67%) were  moderate.  In the  lowest  dose group,  there  were slightly  more  mild 
AE  report,  which  is  consistent  with  known  safety  profile  of  deferasirox. 
In all dose groups, the majority of the patients recovered from the AE (91.40%). In the group 20 
to  <30  mg/kg/day  more  patients  (3.88%)  did  not  recover  from  the  AE  compared  to  the group 
10 to <20 mg/kg/day. The 4 fatal cases described above were all in the group of patients receiving 
deferasirox at a dose between 10 to <20 mg/kg/day. 
The causality was assessed as ‘unlikely’ for the majority of the AEs in all dose groups (overall 
75.27%)  and  more  frequently  in  the  group  of  20  to  <  30  mg/kg/day.  In  the  group  <  10 
mg/kg/day,  there  were  more  AE  which  were  assessed  as  ‘possible’  compared  to  other  dose 
groups. Rarely, the causality was assessed as ‘likely’ (3.49% overall), with highest frequency in  the 
lowest  and  highest  dose  group  probably  due  to  the  low  number  of  patients  in  these groups. 
Summary 
The MAH concluded that the additional safety analyses performed for the 363 pediatric patients by 
age, transfusion and dose categories are consistent with the known safety profile of deferasirox and 
no new safety signals were identified. 
Pediatric patients were evenly distributed across the 3 age categories. Overall more males than 
females were enrolled consistently with data in pediatric malignancies in Korea. Nearly all patients 
received less than 7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells. 
Few patients were treated with doses <10 and ≥30 mg/kg/day compared to the other groups. There 
were more report of AE and unexpected AEs in the group of 20 to <30 mg/kg/day compared to the 
group of 10 to <20 mg/kg/day and in both groups the incidence of SAE was comparable. 
There  were more  discontinuations  due  to  AE in  the  oldest  age category.  In  the  youngest  age 
categories, there were more discontinuations due to improvement. This observation of efficacy is in

line with the transfusional iron burden and daily dose described below. More patients in the 
youngest  age  category  (58.68%)  were  treated  with  a  higher  daily  dose  of  20  to  <30 
mg/kg/day  of  deferasirox,  while  they  received  less  than  7  ml/kg/month  of packed red blood cells. 
These data may suggest that a shorter duration of deferasirox treatment may be associated with 
efficacy especially in children of the youngest age category who were tolerant to higher doses of 
deferasirox. 
In  the  youngest  age  category,  there  were  less  reports  of  SAE  and  more  unexpected  AE 
compared  to  the  middle  and  oldest  age  groups.  Unexpected  ADR,  AE  and  ADR  were  more frequent 
in the oldest age group compared the youngest age groups. There were more reports of  severe  AE 
in  the  middle  age  group.  In  the  transfusion  group  ≥7  to  ≤14  ml/kg/month  and oldest age group, 
the causality for one mild AE of rash was assessed as ‘certain’ in one patient receiving a daily dose 
between 20 to < 30 mg/kg of deferasirox. 
In  all  age  and  dose  groups,  the  vast  majority  of  the  AE  were  considered  recovered.  In  the 
middle age group, 3 patients, all treated with a deferasirox dose between 10 to <20 mg/kg/day, 
experienced 4 fatal AE. None of the deaths was suspected to be related to deferasirox. 
The causality was assessed as ‘unlikely’ for the majority of the AEs in all  age  groups  and all dose 
groups, with a higher frequency in the youngest age group and in the dose group of 20 to <30 
mg/kg/day. In the oldest age category and in the group <10 mg/kg/day, there were more AEs 
which  were  assessed  as  ‘possible’  than  in  the  other  age  and  dose  groups.  Rarely,  the causality 
was  assessed  as  ‘likely’  (3.49%  overall),  more  frequently  in  the  youngest  age  and oldest age 
groups as well as in the group of 30 mg/kg/day. 
The MAH concluded that the  results  obtained  from  the  additional  analyses  performed  in  the 
pediatric  patients  from study CICL670AKR01 are consistent with the associated risks of the 
underlying disease of this patient population and the known safety profile of deferasirox in pediatric 
and adult patients. 
In conclusion, the benefit to risk relationship for deferasirox remains positive for the currently 
approved indications and justifies continuation of the development program in pediatric patients. 
No  changes  to the  pediatric  information of  the  current  Exjade  (deferasirox)  Core  Data  Sheet and 
RMP are proposed as a result of these additional data, and no regulatory consequences of the 
submitted study are anticipated for the pediatric information in the EU SmPC and RMP. 
CHMP’s comment 
Overall, the conclusion drawn by the MAH are endorsed. 
A detailed analysis has been performed with 3 sub-analysis by age categories, transfusion status and 
dose. Some differences in (serious) adverse drug reaction and (serious) adverse event, have been 
observed between age categories.  
The analysis by transfusion status is poorly informative as all but 4 patients received less than 7 
ml/kg/month.  
Some difference of exposure to deferasirox were observed between age category as the patients in the 
youngest category were more frequently exposed to 20-30 mg/kg/day than the patients in the oldest 
category who received more frequently 10-20 mg/kg/day. This difference reflects the capacity of 
young patients to tolerate higher dose, leading to a shorter exposure.

There is no safety signal emerging from this analysis, nor any new safety information of interest to be 
added in the core data sheet. 
These data are also in line with the assessment of the study A2411 which has been positively assessed 
in the frame of the Procedure No. EMEA/H/C/000670/II/0048, and where the long-term safety of 
deferasirox for children aged 2 to less than 6 years at enrolment with transfusional hemosiderosis.

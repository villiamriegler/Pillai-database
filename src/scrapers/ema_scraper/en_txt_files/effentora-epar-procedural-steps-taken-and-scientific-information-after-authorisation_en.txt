Section 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC have been updated in 
following a worksharing procedure according to 
Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
1234/2008. 
Update of sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC in order 
to add a warning on the interaction of fentanyl with 
benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants including 
alcohol following an internal cumulative review. The 
Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
Update of sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC in order 
to add a warning on Hyperalgesia following an 
internal cumulative review. The Package Leaflet is 
updated accordingly. The wording proposals related 
to hyperalgesia are in line with the most recent 
CHMP opinion on PSUSA/00001369/201704. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to 
introduce editorial and format changes in the SmPC 
and PL as well as to introduce information in the PL 
for serotonin syndrome, anaphylaxis and dose review 
order to introduce a warning on the risks of concomitant 
administration with benzodiazepines or related drugs which 
may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, 
coma, and death. Additional recommendations are included 
to recommend that patients should be closely monitored for 
signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation 
in case of concomitant use of Effentora with 
benzodiazepines or related drugs. 
In addition, SmPC section 4.2 and 4.4 have been updated 
in order to indicate that in absence of adequate pain 
control, the possibility of hyperalgesia, tolerance and 
progression of underlying disease should be considered and 
to warn that in case of insufficient pain control in response 
to an increased dose of fentanyl, the possibility of opioid-
induced hyperalgesia should be considered. A fentanyl dose 
reduction or discontinuation of fentanyl treatment or 
treatment review may be indicated. The wording proposals 
related to hyperalgesia are in line with the most recent 
CHMP opinion on PSUSA/00001369/201704 from February

Respiratory depression 
As with all opioids, there is a risk of clinically significant 
respiratory depression associated with the use of fentanyl. 
Improper patient selection (e.g., use in patients without 
maintenance opioid therapy) and/or improper dosing have 
resulted in fatal outcome with Effentora as well as with 
other fentanyl products.  
Effentora should only be used for conditions specified in

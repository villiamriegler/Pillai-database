4.2  Posology and method of administration
Posology
Individuals 12 months of age or older:
Individuals 12 months or older should receive one dose at an elected date. A second dose may
be administered at least 4 weeks after the first dose in accordance with official recommendation.
The second dose is intended for individuals who did not respond to the first dose for any reason.
Infants between 9 and 12 months of age:
Immunogenicity and safety data show that M-M-RvaxPro can be administered to infants
between 9 and 12 months of age, in accordance with official recommendations or when an early
protection is considered necessary (e.g. day-care, outbreak situations, or travel to a region with
high prevalence of measles). Such infants should be revaccinated at 12 to 15 months of age. An
additional dose with a measles-containing vaccine should be considered according to official
recommendations (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).
Infants below 9 months of age:
No data on the efficacy and safety of M-M-RvaxPro for use in children below 9 months of age
are currently available.
Method of administration
The vaccine is to be injected intramuscularly (IM) or subcutaneously (SC).
The preferred injection sites are the anterolateral area of the thigh in younger children and the deltoid
area in older children, adolescents, and adults. 
The vaccine should be administered subcutaneously in patients with thrombocytopenia or any
coagulation disorder. 
For precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product, and for
instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.
DO NOT INJECT INTRAVASCULARLY.
4.3  Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to any measles, mumps, or rubella vaccine, or to any of the excipients listed in
section 6.1, including neomycin (see sections 2 and 4.4).
Pregnancy. Furthermore, pregnancy should be avoided for 1 month following vaccination (see
section 4.6).
Vaccination should be postponed during any illness with fever > 38.5 °C.
Active untreated tuberculosis. Children under treatment for tuberculosis have not experienced
exacerbation of the disease when immunised with live measles virus vaccine. No studies have been
reported to date on the effect of measles virus vaccines on children with untreated tuberculosis.
Blood dyscrasias, leukaemia, lymphomas of any type, or other malignant neoplasms affecting the
haematopoietic and lymphatic systems.
Current immunosuppressive therapy (including high doses of corticosteroids). M-M-RvaxPro is not
contraindicated in individuals who are receiving topical or low-dose parenteral corticosteroids (e.g. for
asthma prophylaxis or replacement therapy).


 

 

 
Severe humoral or cellular (primary or acquired) immunodeficiency, e.g. severe combined
immunodeficiency, agammaglobulinemia and AIDS or symptomatic HIV infection or an age-specific
CD4+ T-lymphocyte percentage in children below 12 months: CD4+ < 25%; children between
12-35 months: CD4+ < 20%; children between 36-59 months: CD4+ < 15% (see section 4.4). 
In severely immunocompromised individuals inadvertently vaccinated with measles-containing
vaccine, measles inclusion body encephalitis, pneumonitis, and fatal outcome as a direct consequence
of disseminated measles vaccine virus infection have been reported.
Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency, unless the immune competence of the
potential vaccine recipient is demonstrated.
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment should always be readily available in
case of rare anaphylactic reactions following the administration of the vaccine (see section 4.8). 
Adults and adolescents with a history of allergies may potentially be at increased risk of anaphylaxis
or anaphylactoid reactions. Close monitoring is recommended following vaccination for the early
signs of such reactions.
Since live measles vaccine and live mumps vaccine are produced in chick embryo cell culture, persons
with a history of anaphylactic, anaphylactoid, or other immediate reactions (e.g. hives, swelling of the
mouth and throat, difficulty breathing, hypotension, or shock) subsequent to egg ingestion may be at
an enhanced risk of immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions. The potential risk-to-benefit ratio
should be carefully evaluated before considering vaccination in such cases.
Due caution should be employed in administration of M-M-RvaxPro to persons with individual or
family history of convulsions, or a history of cerebral injury. The physician should be alert to the
temperature elevation that may occur following vaccination (see section 4.8).
Infants from 9 to 12 months of age vaccinated with a measles-containing vaccine during measles
outbreaks or for other reasons may fail to respond to the vaccine due to the presence of circulating
antibodies of maternal origin and/or immaturity of the immune system (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).
Thrombocytopenia
This vaccine should be given subcutaneously to individuals with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation
disorder because bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals. 
Individuals with current thrombocytopenia may develop more severe thrombocytopenia following
vaccination. In addition, individuals who experienced thrombocytopenia with the first dose of
M-M-RvaxPro (or its component vaccines) may develop thrombocytopenia with repeat doses.
Serologic status may be evaluated to determine whether or not additional doses of vaccine are needed.
The potential risk-to-benefit ratio should be carefully evaluated before considering vaccination in such
cases (see section 4.8).
Other
Vaccination may be considered in patients with selected immune deficiencies where the benefits
outweigh the risks (asymptomatic HIV patients, IgG subclass deficiencies, congenital neutropenia,
chronic granulomatous disease, and complement deficiency diseases).
Immunocompromised patients who have no contraindication for this vaccination (see section 4.3) may
not respond as well as immunocompetent patients; therefore, some of these patients may acquire
4
 
measles, mumps, or rubella in case of contact, despite appropriate vaccine administration. These
patients should be monitored carefully for signs of measles, parotitis, and rubella.
Vaccination with M-M-RvaxPro may not result in protection in all vaccinees.
Transmission
Excretion of small amounts of the live attenuated rubella virus from the nose or throat has occurred in
the majority of susceptible individuals 7 to 28 days after vaccination. There is no confirmed evidence
to indicate that such virus is transmitted to susceptible persons who are in contact with the vaccinated
individuals. Consequently, transmission through close personal contact, while accepted as a theoretical
possibility, is not regarded as a significant risk; however, transmission of the rubella vaccine virus to
infants via breast milk has been documented without any evidence of clinical disease (see section 4.6).
There are no reports of transmission of the more attenuated Enders’ Edmonston strain of measles virus
or the Jeryl Lynn™ strain of mumps virus from vaccinees to susceptible contacts.
Sodium
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 milligrams) per dose, that is to say
essentially ‘sodium-free’.
Potassium
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 milligrams) per dose, that is to say
essentially ‘potassium-free’.
Sorbitol (E 420)
This medicinal product contains 14.5 milligrams of sorbitol per dose. The additive effect of
concomitantly administered products containing sorbitol (or fructose) and dietary intake of sorbitol (or
fructose) should be taken into account. 
Interference with laboratory tests: see section 4.5.
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Immune globulin
Immune globulin (IG) is not to be given concomitantly with M-M-RvaxPro.
Administration of immune globulins concomitantly with M-M-RvaxPro may interfere with the
expected immune response. Vaccination should be deferred for at least 3 months following blood or
plasma transfusions, or administration of human immune serum globulin.
Administration of measles, mumps, or rubella antibody-containing blood products, including immune
globulin preparations, should be avoided within 1 month after a dose of M-M-RvaxPro unless
considered to be essential.
Laboratory tests
It has been reported that live attenuated measles, mumps and rubella virus vaccines given individually
may result in a temporary depression of tuberculin skin sensitivity. Therefore, if a tuberculin test is to
be done, it should be administered either any time before, simultaneously with, or 4 to 6 weeks after
vaccination with M-M-RvaxPro.
Use with other vaccines
Currently no specific studies have been conducted on the concomitant use of M-M-RvaxPro and other
vaccines. However, since M-M-RvaxPro has been shown to have safety and immunogenicity profiles
similar to the previous formulation of the combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine
manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc., experience with this vaccine can be considered.
5
 
Published clinical data support concomitant administration of the previous formulation of the measles,
mumps and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. with other childhood vaccinations,
including DTaP (or DTwP), IPV (or OPV), HIB (Haemophilus influenzae type b), HIB-HBV
(Haemophilus influenzae type b with Hepatitis B vaccine), and VAR (varicella). M-M-RvaxPro should
be given concomitantly at separate injection sites, or one month before or after administration of other
live virus vaccines.
Based on clinical studies with the quadrivalent measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine and with
the previous formulation of the combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine manufactured by
Merck & Co., Inc., M-M-RvaxPro can be given simultaneously (but at separate injection sites) with
Prevenar and/or hepatitis A vaccine. In these clinical studies, it was demonstrated that the immune
responses were unaffected and that the overall safety profiles of the administered vaccines were
similar.
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
Pregnant women should not be vaccinated with M-M-RvaxPro.
Studies have not been conducted with M-M-RvaxPro in pregnant women. It is not known whether
M-M-RvaxPro can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect
reproduction capacity. 
However, foetal damage has not been documented when measles or mumps vaccines have been given
to pregnant women. Although a theoretical risk cannot be excluded, no cases of congenital rubella
syndrome have been reported in more than 3500 susceptible women who were unknowingly in early
stages of pregnancy when vaccinated with a rubella-containing vaccine. Therefore, inadvertent
vaccination of unknowingly pregnant women with measles-, mumps-, or rubella-containing vaccines
should not be a reason for termination of pregnancy.
Pregnancy should be avoided for 1 month following vaccination. Women who intend to become
pregnant should be advised to delay.
Breast-feeding
Studies have shown that breast-feeding postpartum women vaccinated with live attenuated rubella
vaccines may secrete the virus in breast milk and transmit it to breast-fed infants. In the infants with
serological evidence of rubella infection, none had symptomatic disease. It is not known whether
measles or mumps vaccine virus is secreted in human milk; therefore, caution should be exercised
when M-M-RvaxPro is administered to a breast-feeding woman.
Fertility
M-M-RvaxPro has not been evaluated in fertility studies.
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. M-M-RvaxPro
is expected to have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8  Undesirable effects
a. Summary of the safety profile
In clinical trials, M-M-RvaxPro was administered to 1965 children (see section 5.1), and the general
safety profile was comparable to the previous formulation of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine
manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc.
6
 
In a clinical trial, 752 children received M-M-RvaxPro, either intramuscularly or subcutaneously. The
general safety profile of either administration routes were comparable, although injection site reactions
were less frequent in the IM group (15.8%) compared with the SC group (25.8%). 
All adverse reactions were evaluated in 1940 children. Among these children, the vaccine-related
adverse reactions, summarised in section b, were observed in individuals following vaccination with
M-M-RvaxPro (excluding isolated reports with frequency < 0.2%).
In comparison to the first dose, a second dose of M-M-RvaxPro is not associated with an increase in
the incidence and severity of clinical symptoms including those suggestive of hypersensitivity
reaction.
Additionally, other adverse reactions reported with post-marketing use of M-M-RvaxPro and/or in
clinical studies and post-marketing use of previous formulations of monovalent and of the combined
measles, mumps and rubella vaccines manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. without regard to causality
or frequency are available and are summarised in section b. The frequency of these adverse events is
qualified as "not known" when it cannot be estimated based on the available data. These data were
reported based on more than 400 million doses distributed worldwide. 
The most common adverse reactions reported with the use of M-M-RvaxPro were: fever (38.5 °C or
higher); injection site reactions including pain, swelling and erythema.
b. Tabulated list of adverse reactions
Adverse reactions are ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention:

c. Description of selected adverse reactions
Aseptic meningitis
Cases of aseptic meningitis have been reported following measles, mumps and rubella vaccination.
Although a causal relationship between other strains of mumps vaccine and aseptic meningitis has
been shown, there is no evidence to link Jeryl Lynn™ mumps vaccine to aseptic meningitis.
Encephalitis and Encephalopathy
In severely immunocompromised individuals inadvertently vaccinated with measles-containing
vaccine, measles inclusion body encephalitis, pneumonitis, and fatal outcome as a direct consequence
of disseminated measles vaccine virus infection have been reported (see section 4.3); disseminated
mumps and rubella vaccine virus infection has also been reported.
Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis 
There is no evidence that measles vaccine can cause SSPE. There have been reports of SSPE in
children who did not have a history of infection with wild-type measles but did receive measles
vaccine. Some of these cases may have resulted from unrecognised measles in the first year of life or
possibly from the measles vaccination. The results of a retrospective case-controlled study conducted
by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest that the overall effect of measles
vaccine has been to protect against SSPE by preventing measles with its inherent risk of SSPE.
Arthralgia and/or arthritis
Arthralgia and/or arthritis (usually transient and rarely chronic), and polyneuritis are features of
infection with wild-type rubella and vary in frequency and severity with age and sex, being greatest in
adult females and least in prepubertal children. Following vaccination in children, reactions in joints
are generally uncommon (0-3%) and of brief duration. In women, incidence rates for arthritis and
arthralgia are generally higher than those seen in children (12-20%), and the reactions tend to be more
marked and of longer duration. Symptoms may persist for a matter of months or on rare occasions for
years. In adolescent girls, the reactions appear to be intermediate in incidence between those seen in
8
 
children and adult women. Even in older women (35-45 years), these reactions are generally well
tolerated and rarely interfere with normal activities.
Chronic arthritis
Chronic arthritis has been associated with wild-type rubella infection and has been related to persistent
virus and/or viral antigen isolated from body tissues. Only rarely have vaccine recipients developed
chronic joint symptoms.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system
listed in Appendix V.
4.9  Overdose
Administration of a higher than recommended dose of M-M-RvaxPro was reported rarely and the
adverse reaction profile was comparable to that observed with the recommended dose of
M-M-RvaxPro.

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Viral vaccine, ATC code J07BD52
Evaluation of immunogenicity and clinical efficacy
A comparative study in 1279 subjects who received M-M-RvaxPro or the previous formulation
(manufactured with human serum albumin) of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine manufactured
by Merck & Co., Inc. demonstrated similar immunogenicity and safety between the 2 products.
Clinical studies of 284 triple seronegative children, 11 months to 7 years of age, demonstrated that the
previous formulation of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc.
is highly immunogenic and generally well tolerated. In these studies, a single injection of the vaccine
induced measles haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) antibodies in 95%, mumps neutralising antibodies
in 96%, and rubella HI antibodies in 99% of susceptible persons.
Evaluation of immunogenicity in children from 9 to 12 months of age at the time of first dose
A clinical study was conducted with the quadrivalent measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine
manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc., administered with a 2-dose schedule, the doses being given
3 months apart in 1,620 healthy subjects from 9 to 12 months of age at the time of first dose. The
safety profile post-dose 1 and 2 was generally comparable for all age cohorts.
In the Full Analysis Set (vaccinated subjects regardless of their antibody titre at baseline), high
seroprotection rates of > 99% were elicited to mumps and rubella post-dose 2, regardless of the age of
the vaccinee at the first dose. After 2 doses, the seroprotection rates against measles were 98.1% when
the first dose was given at 11 months compared to 98.9% when the first dose was given at 12 months
(non-inferiority study objective met). After two doses, the seroprotection rates against measles were
94.6% when the first dose was given at 9 months compared to 98.9% when the first dose was given at
12 months (non-inferiority study objective not met). 
The seroprotection rates to measles, mumps and rubella for the Full Analysis Set are given in Table 1.

The post-dose 2 geometric mean titres (GMTs) against mumps and rubella were comparable across all
age categories, while the GMTs against measles were lower in subjects who received the first dose at
9 months of age as compared to subjects who received the first dose at 11 or 12 months of age.
A comparative study in 752 subjects who received M-M-RvaxPro either by intramuscular route or
subcutaneous route demonstrated a similar immunogenicity profile between both administration
routes. 
The efficacy of the components of the previous formulation of the measles, mumps and rubella
vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. was established in a series of double-blind controlled field
trials, which demonstrated a high degree of protective efficacy afforded by the individual vaccine
components. These studies also established that seroconversion in response to vaccination against
measles, mumps and rubella paralleled protection from these diseases.
Post-exposure vaccination
Vaccination of individuals exposed to wild-type measles may provide some protection if the vaccine
can be administered within 72 hours after exposure. If, however, the vaccine is given a few days
before exposure, substantial protection may be afforded. There is no conclusive evidence that
vaccination of individuals recently exposed to wild-type mumps or wild-type rubella will provide
protection.
Effectiveness
More than 400 million doses of the previous formulation of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine
manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. have been distributed worldwide (1978 to 2003). Widespread use
of a 2-dose vaccination schedule in the United States and countries such as Finland and Sweden has
led to a > 99% reduction in the incidence of each of the 3 targeted diseases.
Non-pregnant adolescent and adult females
Vaccination of susceptible non-pregnant adolescent and adult females of childbearing age with live
attenuated rubella virus vaccine is indicated if certain precautions are observed (see sections 4.4 and
4.6). Vaccinating susceptible postpubertal females confers individual protection against subsequently
acquiring rubella infection during pregnancy, which, in turn, prevents infection of the foetus and
consequent congenital rubella injury.
10
 
Previously unvaccinated individuals older than 9 months who are in contact with susceptible pregnant
women should receive live attenuated rubella-containing vaccine (such as M-M-RvaxPro or a
monovalent rubella vaccine) to reduce the risk of exposure of the pregnant woman.
Individuals likely to be susceptible to mumps and rubella
M-M-RvaxPro is preferred for vaccination of persons likely to be susceptible to mumps and rubella.
Individuals who require vaccination against measles can receive M-M-RvaxPro regardless of their
immune status to mumps or rubella if a monovalent measles vaccine is not readily available.

To attach the needle, it should be firmly placed on the tip of the syringe and secured by rotating a
quarter of a turn (90 ).
Inject the entire content of the solvent syringe into the vial containing the powder. Gently agitate to
mix thoroughly. 
The reconstituted vaccine must not be used if any particulate matter is noted or if the appearance of the
solvent or powder or of the reconstituted vaccine differs from that described above.
After reconstitution, it is recommended to administer the vaccine immediately to minimise loss
of potency, or within 8 hours if stored in a refrigerator. 
Do not freeze the reconstituted vaccine.
Withdraw the entire content of the reconstituted vaccine from the vial into a syringe, change the
needle and inject the entire volume by subcutaneous or intramuscular route.
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local
requirements.

Package leaflet: Information for the user
M-M-RvaxPro

important information for you.

What is in this leaflet
1. What M-M-RvaxPro is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you receive M-M-RvaxPro
3. How to use M-M-RvaxPro
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store M-M-RvaxPro
6. Contents of the pack and other information
1.  What M-M-RvaxPro is and what it is used for 
M-M-RvaxPro is a vaccine containing measles, mumps and rubella viruses that have been weakened.
When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body's natural defences) will make
antibodies against the measles, mumps and rubella viruses. The antibodies help protect against
infections caused by these viruses.
M-M-RvaxPro is given to help protect you or your child against measles, mumps and rubella. The
vaccine may be administered to persons 12 months of age or older.
M-M-RvaxPro can be administered to infants from 9 to 12 months of age under special circumstances. 
M-M-RvaxPro can also be used in measles outbreaks, or for post-exposure vaccination, or for use in
previously unvaccinated persons older than 9 months who are in contact with susceptible pregnant
women, and persons likely to be susceptible to mumps and rubella.
Although M-M-RvaxPro contains live viruses, they are too weak to cause measles, mumps, or rubella
in healthy people.
2.  What you need to know before you receive M-M-RvaxPro
Do not use M-M-RvaxPro
- 
if the person to be vaccinated is allergic to any measles, mumps or rubella vaccine or to any of
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
the ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6) including neomycin 
if the person to be vaccinated is pregnant (in addition, pregnancy should be avoided for 1 month
after vaccination, see Pregnancy and breast-feeding)
if the person to be vaccinated has any illness with fever higher than 38.5 °C; however,
low-grade fever itself is not a reason to delay vaccination
if the person to be vaccinated has active untreated tuberculosis
if the person to be vaccinated has a blood disorder or any type of cancer that affects the immune
system
if the person to be vaccinated is receiving treatment or taking medicines that may weaken the
immune system (except low-dose corticosteroid therapy for asthma or replacement therapy)
35
 
- 
- 
if the person to be vaccinated has a weakened immune system because of a disease (including
AIDS)
if the person to be vaccinated has a family history of congenital or hereditary
immunodeficiency, unless the immune competence of the person to be vaccinated is
demonstrated.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to the doctor or pharmacist before the person to be vaccinated receives M-M-RvaxPro if he/she
has experienced any of the following:
- 
- 
- 
an allergic reaction to eggs or anything that contained egg
a history or family history of allergies or of convulsions (fits)
a side effect after vaccination with measles, mumps and/or rubella vaccine that involved easy
bruising or bleeding for longer than usual
- 
an infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) but do not show symptoms of HIV
disease. The vaccinated person should be monitored closely for measles, mumps and rubella
because vaccination may be less effective than for uninfected persons (see section Do not use
M-M-RvaxPro).
As with other vaccines, M-M-RvaxPro may not completely protect all persons who are vaccinated.
Also, if the person who is to be vaccinated has already been exposed to the measles, mumps, or rubella
virus but is not yet ill, M-M-RvaxPro may not be able to prevent the illness from appearing.
M-M-RvaxPro can be given to persons who have been in recent (within 3 days) contact with a case of
measles and may be incubating the disease. However, M-M-RvaxPro may not always be able to
prevent measles developing in these cases.
Other medicines and M-M-RvaxPro
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if the person to be vaccinated is taking or has recently taken any other
medicines (or other vaccines).
The doctor may delay vaccination for at least 3 months following blood or plasma transfusions, or
administration of immune globulin (known as IG). After vaccination with M-M-RvaxPro, IG should
not be given for 1 month, unless your doctor tells you otherwise.
If a tuberculin test is to be performed, it should be done either any time before, simultaneously with, or
4 to 6 weeks after vaccination with M-M-RvaxPro.
M-M-RvaxPro may be given with Prevenar and/or hepatitis A vaccine at the same visit at a separate
injection site (e.g. the other arm or leg).
M-M-RvaxPro may be given with some routine childhood vaccines that may be due to be given at the
same time. For vaccines that cannot be given at the same time, M-M-RvaxPro should be given
1 month before or after administration of those vaccines.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
M-M-RvaxPro should not be given to pregnant females. Females of childbearing age should take the
necessary precautions to avoid pregnancy for 1 month, or according to doctor’s recommendation, after
they have been given the vaccine.
Persons who are breast-feeding or intend to breast-feed should tell the doctor. The doctor will decide if
M-M-RvaxPro should be given.
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this vaccine.
Driving and using machines
There is no information to suggest that M-M-RvaxPro affects the ability to drive or operate machinery.
36
 
M-M-RvaxPro contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 milligrams) per dose, that is to say essentially
‘sodium-free’.
M-M-RvaxPro contains potassium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 milligrams) per dose, that is to say essentially
‘potassium-free’.
M-M-RvaxPro contains sorbitol (E 420)
This medicine contains 14.5 milligrams of sorbitol per dose. The additive effect of concomitantly
administered products containing sorbitol (or fructose) and dietary intake of sorbitol (or fructose)
should be taken into account. 
3.  How to use M-M-RvaxPro
M-M-RvaxPro should be injected into the muscle or under the skin either in the area of the outer thigh
or of the upper arm. Usually for injections into the muscle the thigh area is preferred in young children
whereas for older individuals the upper arm area is the preferred injection site. M-M-RvaxPro is not to
be injected directly into any blood vessel. 
M-M-RvaxPro is given as follows:
One dose is given at an elected date usually from 12 months of age. Under special circumstances, it
can be given from 9 months of age. Further doses should be administered according to your doctor’s
recommendation. The interval between 2 doses should be at least 4 weeks.
Reconstitution instructions intended for medical and healthcare professionals are included at the end of
the package leaflet.

Detailed information on this vaccine is available on the European Medicines Agency website:
http://www.ema.europa.eu.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:
Before mixing with the solvent, the powder vaccine is a light yellow compact crystalline cake. The
solvent is a clear colourless liquid. When completely reconstituted, the vaccine is a clear yellow
liquid.
To reconstitute the vaccine, use the solvent supplied.
It is important to use a separate sterile syringe and needle for each patient to prevent transmission of
infectious agents from one individual to another.
One needle should be used for reconstitution and a separate, new needle for injection.
Reconstitution instructions
Withdraw the entire content of the solvent vial into a syringe to be used for reconstitution and
injection. Inject the entire content of the syringe into the vial containing the powder. Gently agitate to
mix thoroughly. 
The reconstituted vaccine must not be used if any particulate matter is noted or if the appearance of the
solvent or powder or of the reconstituted vaccine differs from that described above.
After reconstitution, it is recommended to administer the vaccine immediately to minimise loss
of potency, or within 8 hours if stored in a refrigerator. 
Do not freeze the reconstituted vaccine.
Withdraw the entire content of the reconstituted vaccine from the vial into a syringe, change the
needle and inject the entire volume by subcutaneous or intramuscular route.
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

Read all of this leaflet carefully before you or your child is vaccinated because it contains
important information for you.

If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or your pharmacist.
If you get any of the side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible

side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.
What is in this leaflet
1. What M-M-RvaxPro is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you receive M-M-RvaxPro
3. How to use M-M-RvaxPro
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store M-M-RvaxPro
6. Content of the pack and other information
1.  What M-M-RvaxPro is and what it is used for
M-M-RvaxPro is a vaccine containing measles, mumps and rubella viruses that have been weakened.
When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body's natural defences) will make
antibodies against the measles, mumps and rubella viruses. The antibodies help protect against
infections caused by these viruses.
M-M-RvaxPro is given to help protect you or your child against measles, mumps and rubella. The
vaccine may be administered to persons 12 months of age or older.
M-M-RvaxPro can be administered to infants from 9 to 12 months of age under special circumstances. 
M-M-RvaxPro can also be used in measles outbreaks, or for post-exposure vaccination, or for use in
previously unvaccinated persons older than 9 months who are in contact with susceptible pregnant
women, and persons likely to be susceptible to mumps and rubella.
Although M-M-RvaxPro contains live viruses, they are too weak to cause measles, mumps, or rubella
in healthy people.
2.  What you need to know before you receive M-M-RvaxPro
Do not use M-M-RvaxPro:
- 
if the person to be vaccinated is allergic to any measles, mumps or rubella vaccine or to any of
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
the ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6) including neomycin 
if the person to be vaccinated is pregnant (in addition, pregnancy should be avoided for 1 month
after vaccination, see Pregnancy and breast-feeding)
if the person to be vaccinated has any illness with fever higher than 38.5 °C; however,
low-grade fever itself is not a reason to delay vaccination
if the person to be vaccinated has active untreated tuberculosis
if the person to be vaccinated has a blood disorder or any type of cancer that affects the immune
system
if the person to be vaccinated is receiving treatment or taking medicines that may weaken the
immune system (except low-dose corticosteroid therapy for asthma or replacement therapy)
43
 
- 
- 
if the person to be vaccinated has a weakened immune system because of a disease (including
AIDS)
if the person to be vaccinated has a family history of congenital or hereditary
immunodeficiency, unless the immune competence of the person to be vaccinated is
demonstrated.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to the doctor or pharmacist before the person to be vaccinated receives M-M-RvaxPro if he/she
has experienced any of the following:
- 
- 
- 
a side effect after vaccination with measles, mumps and/or rubella vaccine that involved easy
a history or family history of allergies or of convulsions (fits)
an allergic reaction to eggs or anything that contained egg
bruising or bleeding for longer than usual
- 
an infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) but do not show symptoms of HIV
disease. The vaccinated person should be monitored closely for measles, mumps and rubella
because vaccination may be less effective than for uninfected persons (see section Do not use
M-M-RvaxPro).
As with other vaccines, M-M-RvaxPro may not completely protect all persons who are vaccinated.
Also, if the person who is to be vaccinated has already been exposed to the measles, mumps, or rubella
virus but is not yet ill, M-M-RvaxPro may not be able to prevent the illness from appearing.
M-M-RvaxPro can be given to persons who have been in recent (within 3 days) contact with a case of
measles and may be incubating the disease. However, M-M-RvaxPro may not always be able to
prevent measles developing in these cases.
Other medicines and M-M-RvaxPro
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if the person to be vaccinated is taking or has recently taken any other
medicines (or other vaccines).
The doctor may delay vaccination for at least 3 months following blood or plasma transfusions, or
administration of immune globulin (known as IG). After vaccination with M-M-RvaxPro, IG should
not be given for 1 month, unless your doctor tells you otherwise.
If a tuberculin test is to be performed, it should be done either any time before, simultaneously with, or
4 to 6 weeks after vaccination with M-M-RvaxPro.
M-M-RvaxPro may be given with Prevenar and/or hepatitis A vaccine at the same visit at a separate
injection site (e.g. the other arm or leg).
M-M-RvaxPro may be given with some routine childhood vaccines that may be due to be given at the
same time. For vaccines that cannot be given at the same time, M-M-RvaxPro should be given
1 month before or after administration of those vaccines.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
M-M-RvaxPro should not be given to pregnant females. Females of childbearing age should take the
necessary precautions to avoid pregnancy for 1 month, or according to doctor’s recommendation, after
they have been given the vaccine.
Persons who are breast-feeding or intend to breast-feed should tell the doctor. The doctor will decide if
M-M-RvaxPro should be given.
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this vaccine.
Driving and using machines
There is no information to suggest that M-M-RvaxPro affects the ability to drive or operate machinery.
44
 
M-M-RvaxPro contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 milligrams) per dose, that is to say essentially
‘sodium-free’.
M-M-RvaxPro contains potassium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 milligrams) per dose, that is to say essentially
‘potassium-free’.
M-M-RvaxPro contains sorbitol (E 420)
This medicine contains 14.5 milligrams of sorbitol per dose. The additive effect of concomitantly
administered products containing sorbitol (or fructose) and dietary intake of sorbitol (or fructose)
should be taken into account. 
3.  How to use M-M-RvaxPro
M-M-RvaxPro should be injected into the muscle or under the skin either in the area of the outer thigh
or of the upper arm. Usually for injections into the muscle the thigh area is preferred in young children
whereas for older individuals the upper arm area is the preferred injection site. M-M-RvaxPro is not to
be injected directly into any blood vessel.
M-M-RvaxPro is given as follows:
One dose is given at an elected date usually from 12 months of age. Under special circumstances, it
can be given from 9 months of age. Further doses should be administered according to your doctor’s
recommendation. The interval between 2 doses should be at least 4 weeks.
Reconstitution instructions intended for medical and healthcare professionals are included at the end of
the package leaflet.

2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
Orphan medicinal product designation 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product designation in 2019 
designation was based on the following grounds: 
The sponsor Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S submitted on 26 June 2019 an application for 
designation as an orphan medicinal product to the European Medicines Agency for a medicinal product 
containing lonapegsomatropin for treatment of growth hormone deficiency (hereinafter referred to as 
“the condition”). The application was submitted on the basis of Article 3(1)(a) first paragraph of 
Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products.  
Having examined the application, the COMP considered that the sponsor has established the following:  
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing lonapegsomatropin was 
considered justified based on clinical data showing a significant effect on growth velocity in children 
affected by the condition;  
the condition is chronically debilitating due to delayed puberty and deficits in facial, dental and 
genital development, associated with reduced bone mass with increased risk of developing 
osteopenia, osteoporosis, and bone fractures. Patients also experience severe psychosocial 
problems linked to the very short stature;  
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 4 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made;  
Thus, the requirements under Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products are fulfilled.  
In addition, although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition exist in the European Union, 
the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal product 
containing lonapegsomatropin will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. The 
sponsor has provided clinical data showing significantly increased growth velocity in children affected 
by the condition compared with the currently authorized standard of care growth hormone 
treatments. The Committee considered that this constitutes a clinically relevant advantage for the 
patients affected by the condition.   
Thus, the requirement under Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products is fulfilled.  
The COMP concludes that the requirements laid down in Article (3)(1) (a) and (b) of Regulation (EC) 
No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products are fulfilled. The COMP therefore recommends the 
designation of this medicinal product, containing lonapegsomatropin as an orphan medicinal product 
for the orphan condition: treatment of growth hormone deficiency.

3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation 
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
The designated condition included both paediatric and adult forms of growth hormone deficiencies 
(GHD) and is still acceptable as an orphan condition. 
GHD is a consequence of deficient or insufficient growth hormone secretion that is generally associated 
with defects in the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus. In the paediatric population, GHD is primarily 
idiopathic, whereas in the adult population GHD more often is caused by tumours in the central 
nervous system, cranial irradiation, head trauma or organic causes. GHD in children is characterised by 
a diminished growth velocity and a markedly reduced final adult height compared to that predicted 
(Rosenfeld et al, 2001). In addition to profound growth failure, children with GHD develop the same 
physiological and cognitive abnormalities as the adult population. GHD may be present already at birth 
but is generally first discovered within the first years of childhood.  
Adult growth hormone deficiency (AGHD) is characterised by several clinical features that comprises 
general health and quality of life. If left untreated, AGHD is associated with increased body fat, 
decreased lean body mass, reduced bone mineral density, disturbed lipoprotein metabolism, reduced 
exercise capacity, increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and decreased cognition 
and psychological well-being (Alexopoulou et al, 2010; Molitch et al, 2011).  
The approved therapeutic indication “Growth failure in children and adolescents aged from 3 years up 
to 18 years due to insufficient endogenous growth hormone secretion (growth hormone deficiency 
[GHD]).” falls within the scope of the designated orphan condition “Treatment of growth hormone 
deficiency”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP, 
based on the pivotal study CT-301. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
No change in the chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature of the condition has been 
reported since the designation of the orphan medicinal product.  
The condition is associated with a wide range of neuropsychiatric, cognitive, cardiac, metabolic, 
muscular, and bone symptoms. GHD in children is characterised by a diminished growth velocity and a 
markedly reduced final adult height compared to that predicted (Rosenfeld et al, 2001). In addition to 
profound growth failure, children with GHD develop the same physiological and cognitive abnormalities 
as the adult population. If left untreated, AGHD is associated with increased body fat, decreased lean 
body mass, reduced bone mineral density, disturbed lipoprotein metabolism, reduced exercise

capacity, increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and decreased cognition and 
psychological well-being (Alexopoulou et al, 2010; Molitch et al, 2011).  
Number of people affected or at risk 
Since GHD manifests differently in children and adults due to a shift in roles of GH between these age 
groups, childhood and adult GHD populations are typically reported separately in most epidemiological 
assessments. There is only one report mentioned in this evaluation, which discusses estimates for both 
childhood and adult GHD (Stochholm 2006). 
The sponsor noted that while national registries (e.g. Dutch National Registry of GH Treatment in 
Adults) , Sponsor’s  registries (e.g. Pfizer International Growth Database [KIGS]) and international 
registries such as  Genetics and Neuroendocrinology of Short Stature International Study [GeNeSIS], 
Hypopituitary Control and Complications Study [HypoCCS], National Cooperative Growth Study 
[NCGS], NordiNet® International Outcome Study [IOS]) have been established, these databases are 
not accessible for public review. Therefore, the sponsor relied on published literature for the prevalence 
estimation. 
A systematic literature search was conducted, and twelve papers were identified that complied with the 
predefined criteria. Seven papers reported on childhood prevalence or incidence: Vimpani 1977, 
Hilken 2001, Audí 2002, Thomas 2004, Migliaretti 2006, Stochholm 2006 and Schweizer 2010. Five 
studies reported on adult prevalence or incidence: Sassolas 1999, Regal 2001, Stochholm 2006, van 
Bunderen 2011 and van Nieuwpoort 2011. 
The sponsor reviewed all these articles and conducted a meta-analysis based on the prevalence (or 
incidence) figures published. A separate meta-analysis was done for childhood GHD (Figure 1) and 
adult GHD (Figure 2). Based on these analyses, which included the higher, more conservative 
estimates from the sensitivity analyses, the best prevalence estimate for childhood GHD in the EU was 
3.8 per 10,000 children (95% CI: 2.7-.9 per 10,000) and for adult GHD in the EU was 2.5 per 10,000 
adults (95% CI: 1.0-4.0 per 10,000). 
For the purposes of this application, the highest estimates (upper 95% CI) are used for the overall 
prevalence of GHD in the EU. This corresponds to 4.9 per 10,000 children and 4 per 10,000 adults.

Meta-Analysis of Prevalence of Childhood GHD

Page 6/11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2: 
Meta-Analysis of Prevalence of Adult GHD 
Some childhood studies reported prevalence in only a subset of children; therefore, assumptions were 
made regarding the prevalence in the entire 0-18-year-old population. Expanding the prevalence to the 
0-18-year-old age group is considerably conservative as few children are diagnosed with GHD at ages 
less than 2 and greater than 13 years. 
The overall weighted prevalence of GHD in children and adults is based on the most conservative 
scenario (upper 95% confidence interval) from each meta-analysis, estimated to be 4.9 per 10,000 
and 4.0 per 10,000, respectively, for children and adults. To provide an overall estimate of GHD in 
Europe, the most recent estimates of the European population have been used. Based on 2020 data 
(https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database), the total population of Europe (27 countries) was 
447,319,916. The population aged 0-18 years was 86,511,672 and the population aged >18 years was 
360,808,244. 
Applying the estimated prevalence of childhood GHD and adult AHD to the European population, the 
total prevalence of GHD in Europe is calculated by: ((4.9 x 10-4 x 86,511,672) + (4.0 x 10-4 x 
360,808,244)) / 447,319,916. This gives an overall prevalence estimate of 4.17 per 10,000 general 
population.  
Considering that the orphan condition of growth hormone deficiency includes both adults and children 
the COMP decided that the highest prevalence estimate of 4.9 per 10,000 would be the most 
appropriate and sufficiently conservative estimate. This estimate is also in line with the one from the 
recently adopted medicinal product Sogroya, in the same condition.  
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
The standard treatment for patients with GHD (children and adults) in the EU is daily, s.c. injection 
with recombinant human GH (somatropin). The sponsor provided a list of current approved products 
for daily administration in the EU for treatment of GHD in children and adults, all of which contain 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000059751 
Page 7/11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
somatropin as active ingredient. They also include the recently authorised long acting growth hormone 
Sogroya which is approved for “replacement of endogenous growth hormone (GH) in adults with 
growth hormone deficiency (AGHD)”. 
The daily administered somatropin products are generally authorised for children which is the target 
patient population for Lonapegsomatropin. Therefore, they are considered as satisfactory methods and 
a significant benefit will have to be justified versus somatropin for daily use. 
Sogroya, on the other hand is only approved for adults and therefore Sogroya is not considered a 
satisfactory method for treatment of children with GHD.  
Significant benefit 
The sponsor argues a clinically relevant advantage based on the outcome of the pivotal study (CT-
301), which demonstrated non-inferiority and, additionally, statistical superiority for 
lonapegsomatropin in 105 patients compared to daily somatropin therapy (Genotropin, 56 patients) on 
the primary endpoint of Annualized Height Velocity (AHV) at 52 weeks. In an ANCOVA analysis of the 
ITT population, lonapegsomatropin resulted in a statistically greater AHV of 11.2 cm/year compared to 
10.3 cm/year for Genotropin (P=0.0088). Although statistical significance was reached, the CHMP 
concluded that there is insufficient evidence to conclude therapeutic superiority of lonapegsomatropin 
over daily somatropin, as the difference in the treatment effect was less than the non-inferiority 
margin of 2 cm/year which was defined prior to the study. Therefore, a significant benefit based on a 
clinically relevant advantage regarding efficacy cannot be established.  
The sponsor also argues a major contribution to patient care based on improved treatment burden, 
convenience, and satisfaction with the once weekly injection as opposed to the daily injections. 
Treatment burden among children and their parents was assessed with the Child Sheehan Disability 
Score (CSDS; 1). This decrease in CSDS scores occurred even though children may have used a pen or 
other device for their prior daily somatropin treatment versus syringe/needle for once-weekly 
lonapegsomatropin during the clinical trials.  
In CT-302, an 26 weeks open-label study in 146 paediatric GHD patients aged 6 months up to 18 years 
where the vast majority of patients was treated before with daily somatropin, the CSDS summary 
score decreased from baseline (reflecting prior daily somatropin therapy) to the end of the trial, 
indicating that treatment burden was alleviated with the switch from daily somatropin to once-weekly 
lonapegsomatropin treatment. Similarly, CSDS scores decreased for children (and their parents) who 
switched from daily Genotropin in CT-301 to once-weekly lonapegsomatropin in CT-301EXT. the 
extension phase of the pivotal trial. The data are summarised in Table 1.

The convenience and overall satisfaction domains of the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for 
Medication (TSQM-9) were completed by all parents during CT-302 and by parents of children who 
were previously in the CT-301 Genotropin arm during CT-301EXT. Treatment satisfaction refers to the 
individual patient’s appraisal of his or her experience with treatment. The summary scores range from 
0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater convenience or satisfaction. 
While global satisfaction scores remained high across timepoints, the convenience score increased 
notably upon transition to lonapegsomatropin administration via the GH Auto-Injector from either 
lonapegsomatropin administered via syringe/needle (CT-302 or CT-301 lonapegsomatropin) or daily 
somatropin administered via a pen (CT-301 Genotropin). These results suggest that both frequency 
and mode of administration factor heavily into parent’s assessment of convenience. Once-weekly 
lonapegsomatropin as administered with GH Auto-Injector was associated with relatively high 
convenience and satisfaction scores as assessed by parents.

The improved treatment burden, as assessed by the CSDS scores, confirms a statistically significant 
preference by both children and parents for the weekly treatment with Lonapegsomatropin. This is 
supported by the results from the TSQM-9 (Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication 
version 9) convenience score which also indicate a higher convenience with Lonapegsomatropin as 
opposed to the comparator. In addition, a consistent preference for once-weekly lonapegsomatropin 
relative to daily somatropin treatment was reported by children and parents in studies CT-302 and CT-
301EXT. The majority of patients preferred weekly (children 84%, parents 90%) over daily injection 
treatment (children 9%, parents 5%) after switching.  
The COMP involved a paediatric patient representative and a carer whose testimonies supported the 
findings from the study. The prospect of a once weekly GH preparation was considered to alleviate the 
daily burden of injections. This was not only considered to reduce the physical burden of injections but 
to also grant patients and their families more freedom while away from home. This was considered to 
be a great benefit by the patient representatives as carrying along the daily GH preparations requires 
optimal cooling conditions and finding a suitable place and time to inject in privacy. 
The assumption of significant benefit of lonapegsomatropin on basis of major contribution to patient 
care still holds.

5.  COMP position adopted on 15 November 2021 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of growth hormone deficiency (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was 
estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be 4.9 in 10,000 persons in the 
European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to psychosocial problems linked to the short stature, 
abdominal obesity, reduced bone mass with increased risk of developing osteopenia, osteoporosis 
and bone fractures. In children, the condition can cause episodes of hypoglycaemia and delayed 
puberty. Adults are in addition affected by decreased lean body mass, reduced muscle strength 
and exercise capacity. The condition can be life-threatening with a twofold excess in overall 
mortality compared to the general population; 
• 
although satisfactory methods for the treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union, the assumption that lonapegsomatropin may be of potential significant benefit to 
those affected by the orphan condition still holds. The sponsor provided global treatment 
satisfaction data from the pivotal clinical trial demonstrating that lonapegsomatropin (once weekly 
growth hormone) and somatropin (once daily growth hormone) are of comparable efficacy. 
However, the treatment burden for patients and the satisfaction scores were improved for 
lonapegsomatropin as compared to the somatropin control. This was considered acceptable in 
support of a major contribution to patient care. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Lonapegsomatropin Ascendis 
Pharma, lonapegsomatropin for treatment of growth hormone deficiency (EU/3/19/2213) is not 
removed from the Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

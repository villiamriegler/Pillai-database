2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
26 January 2017 
Adalimumab was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients 
with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the United States (US) in December 2002 and by the European 
Commission for the European Union (EU) countries in September 2003. 
Adalimumab has been approved in over 90 countries for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, 
including RA, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), pediatric enthesitis-related arthritis, psoriatic arthritis 
(PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), plaque Ps, pediatric plaque Ps, Crohn's disease (CD), pediatric CD, 
ulcerative colitis (UC), hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), and intestinal Behçet's disease. 
The MAH seeks to add treatment of moderate to severe nail psoriasis (Ps) to the current Ps indication for 
Humira (see proposed underlined addition to section 4.1 below). 
“Psoriasis 
Humira is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adult patients who 
are candidates for systemic therapy. 
Humira is indicated for moderate to severe nail psoriasis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic 
therapy.” 
No changes are proposed to the currently approved plaque Ps dosing regimen, dosage form, or route of 
administration of adalimumab. 
This submission is based on data from Study M13-674, a Phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, 
parallel-arm, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of adalimumab for treatment of 
nail Ps in subjects with chronic plaque Ps. 
Nail changes in psoriasis 
Psoriasis can affect the nails and produce a variety of changes in the appearance of finger and toe nails. 
Nail psoriasis occurs in 40-50% of people with psoriasis affecting the skin and has a lifetime incidence of 
80-90% in those with psoriasis arthritis. These changes include pitting of the nails (pinhead-sized 
Assessment report  
EMA/130014/2017

depressions in the nail is seen in 70% with nail psoriasis), whitening of the nail, small areas of bleeding 
from capillaries under the nail, yellow-reddish discoloration of the nails, thickening of the skin under the 
nail (subungual hyperkeratosis), loosening and separation of the nail (onycholysis) and crumbling of the 
nail. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
No dose-response studies for nail psoriasis has been performed which was accepted by the CHMP. 
2.4.2.  Main study 
The development program is composed of one pivotal ongoing study, Study M13-674, which evaluated 
the safety and efficacy of adalimumab for treatment of nail Ps in adult subjects with moderate to severe 
chronic plaque Ps.  An interim data cut-off of 19 November 2015 was applied for the safety and efficacy 
analyses at the end of the placebo-controlled initial treatment (Period A; Weeks 0 to 26) in this 
submission.  The study continues in an open-label manner for an additional 26 weeks of treatment. Those 
results have not yet been reported. 
The study includes two periods:   
Period A was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of adalimumab 40 mg every other week (eow) 
(the approved treatment regimen for adults with plaque Ps) with placebo for 26 weeks.   
Period B explores the safety and efficacy of open-label adalimumab 40 mg eow over 26 weeks.  The study 
was designed so that if body surface area (BSA) affected by Ps had increased by 25% or more over the 
Baseline measurement starting from Week 16, subjects were rolled over to the open-label extension 
period of this study (Period B) and proceeded with completing the Week 26 study visit procedures. 
Study Design Schematic 
ADA = adalimumab; BSA = body surface area 
* 
▲ 
Initial dose for subjects in ADA group was 80 mg. 
At Week 26, subjects in placebo group in Period A received a blinded dose of 80 mg adalimumab.  
Subjects in adalimumab group in Period A received matching placebo in order to maintain the blind. 
■ 
Early Escape:  Starting from Week 16, if BSA affected by Ps increased ≥ 25% over the Baseline 
measurement, subjects were to be rolled over to Period B.

Study M13-674 
A Phase 3, Multicenter, Double-Blind, Randomized, Parallel-Arm, Placebo-Controlled Study to 
Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Adalimumab for Treatment of Nail Psoriasis in Subjects 
with Chronic Plaque Psoriasis 
Methods 
Study participants 
Demographic characteristics 
A total of 217 subjects with moderate to severe nail manifestations of moderate to severe chronic plaque 
Ps were randomized in the study. At the time of data cut-off for the Study M13-674 Interim CSR (19 
November 2015), all subjects either completed Period A or discontinued from the study.  A total of 94 
subjects in the placebo group and 94 subjects in the adalimumab group completed Period A (either 
continued to Week 26 or early escaped to Week 26 per protocol requirement) and entered Period B.  
Fewer subjects in the adalimumab group early escaped to Week 26 (8 subjects in the adalimumab group 
vs. 56 subjects in the placebo group).  Fourteen subjects in the placebo group and 15 subjects in the 
adalimumab group discontinued from Period A.  All 188 subjects who entered Period B were treated with 
adalimumab eow.  Sixteen subjects have discontinued from Period B and 172 subjects have completed or 
are ongoing in Period B. 
The population evaluated in Study M13-674 was comprised of adult subjects with a diagnosis of chronic 
plaque Ps for at least 6 months and with a Physician's Global Assessment of Skin Psoriasis (PGA-S) and a 
PGA-F of at least moderate, and at least one fingernail with nail Ps (any disease duration).  Subjects were 
required to have either a BSA ≥ 10% and a target fingernail mNAPSI ≥ 8 at Baseline or a BSA ≥ 5%, a 
target fingernail mNAPSI ≥ 8, and a total mNAPSI score of ≥ 20 at Baseline.  In addition, subjects were 
to have either Nail Psoriasis Physical Functioning Severity score of > 3 or Nail Psoriasis Pain NRS score of 
> 3.

Treatments 
Adalimumab 40 mg/0.8 mL or matching Placebo: 
Subjects randomized to the adalimumab treatment group received 80 mg sc adalimumab at Baseline 
(Day 1) administered as 2 injections of 40 mg adalimumab, and then starting at Week 1 received a single 
injection of adalimumab 40 mg sc eow through Week 25. 
Subjects randomized to the placebo treatment group received 2 injections of placebo at Baseline (Day 1), 
and then starting at Week 1, received a single injection of placebo eow through Week 25. 
Adalimumab 40 mg/0.8 mL: 
At Week 26, subjects from the placebo group were to receive 80 mg sc adalimumab administered as 2 
injections of 40 mg adalimumab, while subjects from the adalimumab group were to receive 2 injections 
of matching placebo. 
Assessment report  
EMA/130014/2017 
Page 12/35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Starting at the Week 27 study visit, all subjects were to receive 1 injection of 40 mg sc of adalimumab eow 
through Week 51. No medication was to be dispensed or injected at the Week 52 study visit. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of adalimumab for treatment 
of nail Ps. 
The study was also designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of adalimumab in subjects 
with nail Ps. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects achieving a total-fingernail mNAPSI 75 
response, defined as at least a 75% reduction in total Modified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (mNAPSI) of 
all fingernails relative to Baseline at Week 26. 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint for US Regulatory Purposes 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects with a Physician's Global Assessment of 
Fingernail Psoriasis (PGA-F) of "clear" or "minimal" with at least a 2-grade improvement at Week 26. 
The ranked secondary efficacy variables were as follows: 
1. 
Percent change from Baseline in total Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) of all fingernails at 
Week 26 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
Proportion of subjects achieving mNAPSI = 0 in all fingernails at Week 26 
Change from Baseline in Nail Ps Pain Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) at Week 26 
Change from Baseline in Nail Ps Physical Functioning Severity score at Week 26 
Proportion of subjects with at least 50% improvement in the scalp component of the Brigham 
Scalp Nail Inverse Palmo-Plantar Psoriasis Index (B-SNIPI) (among subjects with Baseline scalp 
score of 6 or greater) at Week 26 
6. 
Proportion of subjects achieving PGA-F of "clear" or "minimal" with at least a 2-grade 
improvement at Week 26 
Sample size 
This study was designed to enroll 200 subjects in order to provide more than 90% power to detect a 20% 
treatment difference assuming the average mNAPSI 75 response rate in the placebo group was 5%. 
Since PGA-F is a novel endpoint, there was no clinical data to enable a robust power estimate. The current 
study had 90% power to detect a clinical meaningful treatment difference of 20% when the placebo rate 
was 10% or lower. 
Randomisation 
Subjects who were eligible based on inclusion and exclusion criteria and have had all re-randomization 
procedures performed were randomized 1:1 in a double-blinded manner to either blinded ADA 40 mg sc 
eow, or matching placebo. The randomization was stratified by center.

Statistical methods 
Standard statistical analyses were performed in Study M13-674 and are appropriate for assessing disease 
activity in subjects with Ps and nail Ps. 
Analysis of Initial Efficacy from Weeks 0 to 26 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population in Period A (ITT_A) was the primary efficacy analysis population, 
defined as all subjects who were randomized at Baseline.  Analysis of efficacy from Weeks 0 to 26 was 
performed with 108 subjects in the placebo group and 109 subjects in the adalimumab group.  The 
analysis of efficacy was based on the interim lock when all patients either entered the subsequent period 
or discontinued from the study.  This analysis is the only and final efficacy analysis for this period.  
Multiple Imputation (MI) was the primary approach to handle missing values, with sensitivity analyses of 
Non-Responder Imputation (NRI), Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF), and As Observed Case (OC) 
analysis.  Sensitivity analyses for the primary and ranked secondary endpoints were also performed in the 
Per Protocol (PP) Population in Period A (PP_A), which is a subset of the ITT_A Population that excluded 
all subjects with significant protocol deviations. 
Analysis of Maintenance of Efficacy from Week 26 up to Week 52 
The ITT Population in Period B (ITT_B) was the efficacy analysis population in Period B, defined as all 
subjects who received at least one injection of study drug in Period B.  Analysis of maintenance of efficacy 
from Week 26 up to Week 52 was performed with 94 subjects in the placebo group and 94 subjects in the 
adalimumab group. 
Analysis of Long-Term Efficacy 
The Adalimumab EOW Population (ADA_EOW) was defined as all subjects who were randomized to 
adalimumab at Week 0 (N = 109), which was used to evaluate the efficacy of long-term treatment.

28 October 2015 
Data Cut-off Date: 19 November 2015 
Conduct of the study 
A total of 217 subjects were enrolled at 32 sites in Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Greece, 
Puerto Rico and the US.  These subjects were randomized 1:1 to either placebo or adalimumab eow and 
comprised the ITT_A population. 
At the time of data cut-off for the Study M13-674 Interim CSR (19 November 2015), 94 subjects (87.0%) 
in the placebo group and 94 subjects (86.2) from the adalimumab eow group completed Period A (either 
continued to Week 26 or early escaped to Week 26 per protocol requirement) and entered Period B.  
Fewer subjects in the adalimumab eow group early escaped to Week 26 (8 subjects [7.3%] in the 
adalimumab eow group vs. 56 subjects [51.9%] in the placebo group). 
The most frequently reported primary reasons for discontinuation were due to an AE (8 subjects [3.7%]; 
5 subjects [4.6%] in the adalimumab eow group vs. 3 subjects [2.8%] in the placebo group) or

withdrawal of consent (7 subjects [3.2%]; 4 subjects [3.7%] in the adalimumab eow group vs. 3 subjects 
[2.8%] in the placebo group). 
All 188 subjects (86.6%) who entered Period B were treated with adalimumab eow.  As of the cut-off date 
for the study (19 November 2015), 16 subjects (8.5%) have discontinued from Period B and 172 subjects 
(91.5%) have completed or are ongoing in Period B. 
A total of 20 subjects who had major protocol deviations, including 5 subjects with entry criteria 
violations, were excluded from the PP Population.  These subjects did not impact the efficacy results, as 
the results were similar between the ITT_A and PP_A Populations.

Primary efficacy endpoints 
The primary efficacy variable in this study was the proportion of subjects achieving a total fingernail 
mNAPSI 75 response, defined as at least a 75% reduction in total fingernail mNAPSI relative to Baseline

at Week 26. Results from the PP_A Population were consistent with the ITT_A Population. 
Proportion of Subjects Achieving a Total Fingernail mNAPSI 75 Response at Weeks 16 and 26 (MI) 
(ITT_A Population) 
For US regulatory purposes, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects achieving a 
PGA-F of "clear" or "minimal" with at least a 2-grade improvement at Week 26, relative to Baseline (which 
is the 6th ranked secondary efficacy variable). 
A statistically significantly higher proportion of subjects in the adalimumab eow group achieved a PGA-F 
of "clear" or "minimal" with at least a 2-grade improvement from Baseline at Week 26 compared with 
placebo (48.9% versus 6.9%, P < 0.001) (see table below). The proportion of subjects achieving a PGA-F 
of "clear" or "minimal" was also higher in the adalimumab group than in the placebo group at Week 16. 
Results from the PP_A Population were consistent with the ITT_A Population.

in Period A were further analyzed for subgroups of the demographic characteristics indicated below. 
● Age category 
● Sex 
● Race 
● Weight 
● BMI category 
● Duration of Ps 
● Duration of fingernail Ps 
● Baseline hsCRP 
● Baseline total fingernail mNAPSI score 
● Baseline total fingernail NAPSI score 
● Baseline PASI score 
● Baseline BSA 
● History of PsA 
Statistically significant and clinically meaningful treatment differences were shown in all pre-specified 
subgroups, except the non-white race group due to the small sample size (n = 11). 
Similarly when analyzing PGA-F "clear" or "minimal" with at least a 2-grade improvement at Week 26 by 
demographic subgroups, statistically significant and clinically meaningful treatment differences were 
shown in all pre-specified subgroups, except the non-white race group due to the small sample size (n = 
11). 
Secondary efficacy variables 
Results of the other secondary endpoints support the primary efficacy endpoint results. 
Some of the results can be summarised: 
● The mean percent decrease from Baseline to Week 26 in total fingernail NAPSI was greater for subjects 
in the adalimumab eow group compared with subjects in the placebo group. 
● A higher proportion of subjects achieved a total fingernail mNAPSI = 0 at Week 26 in the adalimumab 
eow group compared with the placebo group. 
● The mean improvement from Baseline to Week 26 in Nail Ps Pain NRS was greater in the adalimumab 
eow group compared with the placebo group. 
Nail Ps Physical Functioning Severity Score 
All subjects rated the impact of fingernail Ps on their ability to perform physical tasks over the past 7 days, 
with 0 equaling "No Impact" and 10 equaling "Severe Impact," at all study visits except Week 25. A 
decrease in Nail Ps Physical Functioning Severity score indicates improvement. 
At Weeks 16 and 26, the mean improvement in Nail Ps Physical Functioning Severity score was larger for 
subjects in the adalimumab eow group compared with subjects in the placebo group (P < 0.001). The 
mean percent change from Baseline to Weeks 16 and 26 in Nail Ps Physical Functioning Severity Score 
was also larger in the adalimumab group than in the placebo group (Week 16 –60.3% versus –8.6%, P < 
0.001; Week 26 –67.6% versus –9.9%, P < 0.001).

Nail Ps QoL 
All subjects rated the impact of fingernail Ps on their QoL over the past 7 days, with 0 equaling "No 
Impact" and 10 equaling "Severe Impact," at all study visits except Week 25. A decrease in Nail Ps QoL 
score indicates improvement. 
At Weeks 16 and 26, the mean improvement in Nail Ps QoL score was larger for subjects in the 
adalimumab eow group compared with subjects in the placebo group (P < 0.001).

Period B 
The Study M13-674 final clinical study report (CSR) (R&D/16/0603) is provided and presents remaining 
data from open-label Period B collected through the final database lock of 27 April 2016. 
In summary: 
● The mean duration of exposure for the Safety_B Population increased from 144.6 to 177.3 days. 
Assessment report  
EMA/130014/2017 
Page 21/35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
● At the time of the final database lock (27 April 2016), 81 subjects (86.2%) in the placebo/adalimumab 
every other week (eow) group and 87 subjects (92.6%) from the adalimumab eow/eow group completed 
Period B. The most frequently reported primary reason for discontinuation was due to lack of efficacy (6 
subjects [6.4%] in the placebo/eow group and 4 subjects [4.3%] in the adalimumab eow/eow group). 
● For subjects who continued in the study to Period B, improvement in efficacy and quality of life 
measures observed in the adalimumab eow treatment group in 26 weeks of treatment in Period A was 
maintained or increased through Week 52 in Period B. Subjects who were randomized to placebo in Period 
A improved and in most measures achieved similar results when switched to eow adalimumab in Period B 
as adalimumab subjects did at the end of Period A. The data suggest that long-term treatment beyond 
Week 26 may result in further improvement of symptoms. 
● In Period B, when all subjects received eow adalimumab, the AE profile was similar for subjects who had 
received adalimumab in Period A and subjects who had received placebo in Period A. 
● The rates of study drug discontinuation due to TEAEs were relatively balanced across treatment groups 
in Period A, and no AEs led to discontinuation in Period B. No deaths or malignancies were reported in this 
study. Nine infectious SAEs were reported in 7 subjects treated with adalimumab. No opportunistic 
infections were reported. 
The Study M13-674 final PK report (R&D/16/0658) is also provided and presents data from Period A and 
open-label Period B collected through the final database lock of 27 April 2016. In summary, following 
adalimumab 40 mg eow treatment, the mean serum adalimumab steady state trough concentrations at 
Week 25 (Period A) and Week 51 (Period B) were approximately 4.5 μg/mL. The mean serum 
adalimumab concentrations trended slightly higher in mNAPSI 75 and PGA-F ("clear" or "minimal") 
responders compared to non-responders. Following 52 weeks of adalimumab 40 mg eow treatment, the 
percent of subjects testing AAA+ was 15.8% (32/203 subjects). In general, adalimumab concentrations 
were lower in AAA+ compared to AAA– subjects. The mNAPSI 75 response rate and PGA-F ("clear" or 
"minimal") response rate were slightly lower in AAA+ subjects compared to AAA–. AAA status did not 
appear to have a clinically significant impact on the safety of adalimumab. 
Ancillary analyses 
Only data from Study M13-674 weree submitted; therefore, no comparisons of results across studies 
were performed.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study M13-674 evaluated the safety and efficacy of adalimumab, as compared with placebo, for the 
treatment of nail Ps in adult subjects with chronic plaque Ps. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were 
appropriate considering the aim of the study. The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects 
achieving a total-fingernail mNAPSI 75 response, defined as at least a 75% reduction in total Modified Nail 
Psoriasis Severity Index (mNAPSI) of all fingernails relative to Baseline at Week 26. The Nail Psoriasis 
Severity Index is a validated and often used scale in clinical studies of psoriasis. In order to investigate 
efficacy in nails, the scale has been slightly modified to Modified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index by the 
Applicant. The modified NAPSI scale has been validated considered appropriate for its purpose. 
As of the date of the cut-off for this interim report, Period A has been completed (i.e., all subjects had 
completed or discontinued from Period A). Period B is ongoing.  
In Period A, a total of 217 subjects were randomized 1:1 to either placebo (N = 108) or adalimumab 40 
mg eow (N = 109) and comprise the ITT_A Population. Overall, the statistical methods and randomization 
technique are considered appropriate. The majority of subjects in the ITT_A Population were white males. 
The mean BMI was approximately 30 kg/m2 and the mean age was approximately 47 years. Baseline 
demographic and disease characteristics were consistent with the intended subject population and were 
generally balanced between the two treatment groups. The median duration of Ps was approximately 16 
years and the median duration of fingernail Ps was approximately 9 years. The mean total fingernail 
mNAPSI was approximately 58 (scale range 0 to 130). The mean target fingernail mNAPSI was 
approximately 10 (scale range 0 to 13). On a scale of 0 to 10, mean NRS nail pain was 5.4. The patients 
are considered to have moderate to severe nail Ps, with the vast majority having moderate nail Ps. There 
were no statistically significant differences between the adalimumab and placebo groups. 
All randomized subjects in Period A received at least 1 dose of study drug. There were 94 subjects in the 
placebo group and 94 subjects from the adalimumab eow group who completed Period A (either 
continued to Week 26 or early escaped to Week 26 per protocol requirement) and entered Period B. Fewer 
subjects in the adalimumab eow group early escaped to Week 26 (8 subjects in the adalimumab eow 
group versus 56 subjects in the placebo group). The most frequently reported primary reasons for 
discontinuation were due to an AE (8 subjects; 5 subjects in the adalimumab eow group versus 3 subjects 
in the placebo group) or withdrawal of consent (7 subjects; 4 subjects in the adalimumab eow group 
versus 3 subjects in the placebo group). All 188 subjects who entered Period B were treated with 
adalimumab eow. As of the cut-off date for the study (19 November 2015), 16 subjects (8.5%) have 
discontinued from Period B and 172 subjects (91.5%) have completed or are ongoing in Period B. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
All primary and ranked secondary efficacy endpoints for this study reached statistically significant 
difference between Humira and placebo (P < 0.01 or P < 0.001). 
In Period A, a statistically significantly higher proportion of subjects randomized to adalimumab eow 
achieved a total fingernail mNAPSI 75 response at Week 26 (primary efficacy endpoint), as compared 
with subjects randomized to placebo (46.6% versus 3.4%, P < 0.001). Furthermore, a statistically 
significantly higher proportion of subjects in the adalimumab eow group achieved a PGA-F of "clear" or 
"minimal" with at least a 2-grade improvement from Baseline at Week 26 compared with placebo (48.9% 
versus 6.9%, P < 0.001). 
The treatment effects across both primary endpoints were consistently seen in all pre-specified 
Assessment report  
EMA/130014/2017 
Page 26/35 
 
 
 
 
 
subgroups. 
Statistically significant improvements were observed in all ranked secondary endpoints.  Reductions at 
Week 26 in total fingernail NAPSI, target fingernail mNAPSI, Nail Ps Pain NRS, Nail Ps Physical Functioning 
Severity Score, and PASI were statistically significantly greater for subjects randomized to adalimumab 
than for subjects randomized to placebo.  Also at Week 26, statistically significantly more subjects 
randomized to adalimumab eow achieved total fingernail mNAPSI = 0 and PGA-S of "clear" or "minimal." 
During the request for information the results from the open label Phase B study was provided which 
presents data from open-label Period B collected through the final database lock of 27 April 2016. Section 
5.1 of the SmPC was therefore updated based on the long-term efficacy data for those who continued to 
receive adalimumab treatment until Week 52.  
No new safety signals for adalimumab have been identified and the original safety conclusions were not 
impacted by the additional data collected during Period B. Additionally, no new safety signals for 
adalimumab have been identified through routine Pharmacovigilance activities or from other adalimumab 
studies for other indications. 
In summary, adalimumab 40 mg eow was superior to placebo in the treatment of moderate to severe nail 
Ps in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque Ps as demonstrated by the primary endpoints 
and supported by all ranked secondary endpoints. When comparing the grade of efficacy of Humira in nail 
psoriasis versus plaque psoriasis based on labelled results (although slightly modified endpoints), it 
seems as if that the level of efficacy is less in nail psoriasis. This finding is as could be expected since 
diseases of the nails in general are difficult to treat. In the Clinical Overview, the applicant states that “In 
one recent study of patients with moderate to severe Ps, 81.8% of 373 evaluated patients had evidence 
of nail Ps at baseline, with a mean of 7.5 fingernails involved”  indicating that nail engagement is common 
in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis.  
The initially proposed extension of the indication concerned both addition of a sentence in section 4.1 
“Humira is indicated for moderate to severe nail psoriasis in adult patients who are candidates for 
systemic therapy” and a description of study M13-674 in section 5.1. Since a large proportion of psoriasis 
patients receive treatment with Humira and similar products, an efficacy on the nails is achieved in 
conjunction to beneficial effects on cutaneous symptoms. 
It is also considered that plaque psoriasis and nail psoriasis are different presentations of the same 
disease and in a large proportion of patients both coincide (up to approximately 80% of patients with 
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis have engagement of the nail). This view is also supported in the 
Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products indicated for the treatment of psoriasis 
(CHMP/EWP/2454/02 cor). This guidance states that "it is of interest to get information on the efficacy of 
the drug in psoriasis locations such as scalp, nails, palms and soles", indicating that these locations are 
different aspects of the same disease. 
Considering that treatment of plaque psoriasis with Humira already targets also the nails, a separate 
indication claim on nail psoriasis beside an inclusion of the study results in 5.1. was not accepted by the 
CHMP  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The Applicant has performed a dedicated study in patients with moderate to severe nail psoriasis.  
All primary and ranked secondary efficacy endpoints for this study reached statistically significant results 
between Humira and placebo, the differences are considered clinically relevant. 
Since a large portion of patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis have engagement of the nail 
Assessment report  
EMA/130014/2017 
Page 27/35 
 
 
 
 
and plaque psoriasis and nail psoriasis are considered manifestations of the same disease, a separate or 
extended indication wording on nail psoriasis was not agreed by the CHMP. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Adalimumab has a well-established safety profile based on clinical trial and postmarketing data accrued 
in multiple indications for greater than 10 years.  As of 31 December 2015, a total of 41,872 subjects have 
been enrolled in adalimumab trials and registry studies (33,200 treated with adalimumab with > 45,000 
PYs of exposure) in RA, JIA, pediatric enthesitis-related arthritis, PsA, CD, pediatric CD, Ps, pediatric Ps, 
UC, AS, spondyloarthritis (SpA), non-radiographic axial SpA, HS, uveitis, or intestinal Behçet's disease.  
The estimated cumulative postmarketing patient exposure since the international birth date (31 
December 2002) through 31 December 2015 is almost 4.3 million PYs.  
Patient exposure 
A total of 217 subjects comprised the Safety_A Population. The mean duration of exposure was longer in 
Period A for the adalimumab treatment group (163 days) versus the placebo treatment group (138 days) 
(see table below).

Most Frequently Reported (≥ 2%) Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events by Preferred Term (Safety_A 
Population) 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
SAEs were reported in 8 (7.3%) subjects in the adalimumab group and 5 (4.6%) subjects in the placebo 
group. Six subjects in the adalimumab group reported an AE with an action taken as discontinuation of 
study drug, compared with 3 in the placebo group. No deaths were reported in Period A. 
Laboratory findings 
No clinically meaningful changes in laboratory parameters or vital signs were noted in 
adalimumab-treated subjects. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Drug interactions were not evaluated in Study M13-674. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The most frequently reported primary reasons for discontinuation were due to an AE (8 subjects [3.7%]; 
5 subjects [4.6%] in the adalimumab eow group vs. 3 subjects [2.8%] in the placebo group) or 
withdrawal of consent (7 subjects [3.2%]; 4 subjects [3.7%] in the adalimumab eow group vs. 3 subjects 
[2.8%] in the placebo group).

Post marketing experience 
The estimated cumulative postmarketing patient exposure since the International Birth Date through 31 
December 2015 is almost 4.3 million PYs. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety results presented in the submission are consistent with the known adalimumab safety profile 
for the approved indication of plaque Ps. 
The number and proportion of subjects with AEs, SAEs, serious infectious AEs, other AESIs, and 
discontinuations due to AEs in the adalimumab and placebo groups were generally comparable.  The rates 
of these events are comparable to those in other indications for which adalimumab have been studied. 
No new safety risks associated with adalimumab administration were identified as compared with the 
existing indications for adalimumab, including Ps, as delineated in the approved adalimumab labeling. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of adalimumab observed in Study M13-674 for treating nail manifestations of 
moderate to severe chronic plaque Ps in adult subjects is consistent with the known safety profile of 
adalimumab. No new safety signals were identified. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
Adalimumab has a well-established safety profile based on clinical trial and postmarketing data accrued 
in multiple indications for more than 12 years. 
The safety profile of adalimumab 40 mg every other week observed in Study M13-674 for treating nail 
manifestations of moderate to severe chronic plaque Ps in adult subjects is consistent with the known 
safety profile of adalimumab. No new safety signals were identified. 
The CHMP accepted that no updated Risk Management Plan was provided with this application because no 
additional risks are anticipated in the adult patient population with moderate to severe nail psoriasis over 
and above those already identified for adults with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. 
There is no need for additional risk management activities beyond those already established. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
An extension of indication was not agreed by the CHMP. However 5.1 of the SmPC has been updated with 
the results of the clinical study. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Changes were also 
made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template which were reviewed by QRD and 
accepted by the CHMP. The MAH has also taken the occasion to correct some editorial mistakes in the PI 
The main relevant changes (insertions in this case) to the information in relation to nail psoriasis are as

Psoriasis Study III (REACH) compared the efficacy and safety of Humira versus placebo in 72 patients 
with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis and hand and/or foot psoriasis. Patients received an 
initial dose of 80  mg Humira followed by 40  mg every other week (starting one week after the initial 
dose) or placebo for 16  weeks. At Week  16, a statistically significantly greater proportion of patients who 
received Humira achieved PGA of 'clear' or 'almost clear' for the hands and/or feet compared to patients 
who received placebo (30.6% versus 4.3%, respectively [P = 0.014]).  
Psoriasis Study IV compared efficacy and safety of Humira versus placebo in 217 adult patients with 
moderate to severe nail psoriasis. Patients received an initial dose of 80 mg Humira followed by 40 mg 
every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) or placebo for 26 weeks followed by open-label 
Humira treatment for an additional 26 weeks. Nail psoriasis assessments included the Modified Nail 
Psoriasis Severity Index (mNAPSI), the Physician’s Global Assessment of Fingernail Psoriasis (PGA-F) and 
the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) (see Table 13). Humira demonstrated a treatment benefit in nail 
psoriasis patients with different extents of skin involvement (BSA≥10% (60% of patients) and BSA<10% 
and ≥5% (40% of patients)).

Adolescent hidradenitis suppurativa 
There are no clinical trials with Humira in adolescent patients with HS.  Efficacy of adalimumab for the 
treatment of adolescent patients with HS is predicted based on the demonstrated efficacy and 
exposure-response relationship in adult HS patients and the likelihood that the disease course, 
pathophysiology, and drug effects are substantially similar to that of adults at the same exposure levels. 
Safety of the recommended adalimumab dose in the adolescent HS population is based on 
cross-indication safety profile of adalimumab in both adults and paediatric patients at similar or more 
frequent doses (see section 5.2).

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
This extension of indication for Humira concerns inclusion of moderate to severe nail psoriasis in adult 
patients who are candidates for systemic therapy for Humira, to the psoriasis section (see below, 
proposed text is underlined). 
“Psoriasis 
Humira is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adult patients who 
are candidates for systemic therapy. 
Humira is indicated for moderate to severe nail psoriasis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic 
therapy.” 
In support of the application, the Applicant has performed a study in patients with moderate to severe nail 
psoriasis. The population evaluated was comprised of adult subjects with a diagnosis of chronic plaque Ps 
for at least 6 months and with a Physician's Global Assessment of Skin Psoriasis (PGA-S) and a PGA-F of 
at least moderate, and at least one fingernail with nail Ps (any disease duration).  Subjects were required 
to have either a BSA ≥ 10% and a target fingernail mNAPSI ≥ 8 at Baseline or a BSA ≥ 5%, a target 
fingernail mNAPSI ≥ 8, and a total mNAPSI score of ≥ 20 at Baseline.  In addition, subjects were to have 
either Nail Psoriasis Physical Functioning Severity score of > 3 or Nail Psoriasis Pain NRS score of > 3. A 
total of 217 subjects were randomized 1:1 to either placebo (N = 108) or adalimumab 40 mg eow (N = 
109) and comprised the ITT_A Population. Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were 
consistent with the intended subject population and were generally balanced between the two treatment 
groups. The median duration of cutaneous psoriasis was approximately 16 years and the median duration 
of fingernail psoriasis was approximately 9 years. The study is comprised of two periods; Period A, the 
double-blind period and Period B, the open-label extension period. An interim data cut-off of 19 
November 2015 was applied for Period A (Weeks 0 to 26). The study thereafter continues in an open-label 
manner for an additional 26 weeks of treatment.  
In Period A, a statistically significantly higher proportion of subjects randomized to adalimumab eow 
achieved a total fingernail mNAPSI 75 response at Week 26 (primary efficacy endpoint), as compared 
with subjects randomized to placebo (46.6% versus 3.4%, P < 0.001). Furthermore, a statistically 
significantly higher proportion of subjects in the adalimumab eow group achieved a PGA-F of "clear" or 
"minimal" with at least a 2-grade improvement from Baseline at Week 26 compared with placebo (48.9% 
versus 6.9%, P < 0.001). For subjects who continued in the study to Period B, improvement in efficacy 
and quality of life measures observed in the adalimumab eow treatment group in 26 weeks of treatment 
in Period A was maintained or increased through Week 52 in Period B. 
The treatment effects across both primary endpoints were consistently seen in all pre-specified 
subgroups. 
Statistically significant improvements were observed in all ranked secondary endpoints.  Reductions at 
Week 26 in total fingernail NAPSI, target fingernail mNAPSI, Nail Ps Pain NRS, Nail Ps Physical Functioning 
Assessment report  
EMA/130014/2017

Severity Score, and PASI were statistically significantly greater for subjects randomized to adalimumab 
than for subjects randomized to placebo. Also at Week 26, statistically significantly more subjects 
randomized to adalimumab eow achieved total fingernail mNAPSI = 0 and PGA-S of "clear" or "minimal." 
Humira has a well-established clinical efficacy in a number of therapeutic indications including moderate 
to severe plaque psoriasis.   
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
There are no uncertainties in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety results presented in the submission are consistent with the known adalimumab safety profile 
for the approved indication of plaque Ps. 
The number and proportion of subjects with AEs, SAEs, serious infectious AEs, other AESIs, and 
discontinuations due to AEs in the adalimumab and placebo groups were generally comparable.  The rates 
of these events are comparable to those in other indications for which adalimumab have been studied. 
There is no need for additional risk management activities beyond those already established. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
No new safety risks associated with adalimumab administration were identified as compared with the 
existing indications for adalimumab, including psoriasis, as delineated in the approved adalimumab 
labelling. 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
All primary and ranked secondary efficacy endpoints in the clinical study of patients with nail psoriasis 
reached statistically significant difference between Humira and placebo (P < 0.01 or P < 0.001). The 
results are considered important since disease engagement of the nail is common in patients with 
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (also when skin engagement is not so pronounced).   
No new safety risks were identified in the performed study and are not to be expected since the dosing 
regime, dosing formulation and route of administration is identical to the approved psoriasis indication. 
The safety risks of Humira are considered important but well characterized, since the clinical experience 
of Humira is extensive. The estimated cumulative postmarketing patient exposure since the International 
Birth Date through 31 December 2015 is almost 4.3 million PYs. 
Benefit-risk balance 
A statistically significant and clinically relevant efficacy of Humira has been observed in patients with nail 
psoriasis. The safety profile remains unchanged. The benefit-risk balance for the use of Humira in patients 
with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis with engagement of nails is considered positive. However, the 
CHMP considered that treatment of nail psoriasis to be covered by the current indication “treatment of 
plaque psoriasis” and that the appropriate place to communicate the results of the current study is in the 
SmPC section 5.1.  
The CHMP current view on wording of the therapeutic indication is that nail psoriasis is covered by the 
current indication which is consistent with recent approvals of other products indicated for the treatment

of patients with plaque psoriasis.  Therefore the applicant was requested in the course of the procedure to 
further justify an extended indication claim but decided not to pursue the claim in 4.1.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Lucentis® (ranibizumab) is a recombinant humanised immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 kappa monoclonal 
antibody fragment that binds to vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and has been developed 
for intraocular use. The binding of ranibizumab to VEGF-A prevents the interaction of VEGF-A with its 
receptors, thus blocking the effects of VEGF on vascular permeability, angiogenesis, and 
neovascularisation. Vascular endothelial growth factor is over-expressed in ocular conditions that result 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/499486/2019  
Page 4/60 
 
 
 
 
 
in ocular neovascularisation and retinal edema and lead to vision loss. VEGF-A has been shown to 
cause neovascularisation and vascular leakage in models of ocular angiogenesis. The binding of 
ranibizumab to VEGF-A prevents the interaction of VEGF-A with its receptors (VEGFR1 and VEGFR2) on 
the surface of endothelial cells, reducing endothelial cell proliferation, vascular leakage, and new blood 
vessel formation. 
Ranibizumab is currently approved in more than 100 countries worldwide for the treatment of 
neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), visual impairment due to choroidal 
neovascularisation (CNV), diabetic macular edema (DME), and macular edema secondary to branch or 
central retinal vein occlusion (RVO). In the US, ranibizumab 0.3 mg (Genentech Inc.) is also approved 
for diabetic retinopathy (DR). 
In the EU, ranibizumab intravitreal injection at a dose of 0.5 mg is currently approved for the 
treatment in adults of: 
−  neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (referred to as nAMD throughout 
the text) 
−  visual impairment due to choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) 
−  visual impairment due to diabetic macular edema (DME) 
−  visual impairment due to macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (RVO) (branch 
RVO or central RVO) 
With the present submission, Novartis seeks approval for the use of ranibizumab in adults for the 
treatment of moderately severe to severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) or proliferative 
diabetic retinopathy (PDR). 
Disease background 
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a microangiopathy that leads to hypoxia-triggered up-regulation of pro-
angiogenic, proinflammatory, and vascular permeability factors, including vascular endothelial grow 
factor (VEGF), and to the development of subsequent vessel leakage, subclinical inflammation, and 
neovascularisation in the retina. It occurs as a complication of both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes 
mellitus and is strongly associated with other microvascular complications of diabetes – and poor 
control of hyperglycemia. 
Globally, DR is a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness. The Meta-analysis for Eye Disease 
Study Group estimated that, in 2010, 35 % of adults with diabetes had some form of DR, which 
amounts to approximately 93 million individuals worldwide (Yau et al 2012). In 2017, it was estimated 
that approximately 58 million individuals in Europe had diabetes (Types 1 and 2) (International 
Diabetes Federation 2017). 
Despite best efforts to optimally control blood glucose, if DR already has developed and left untreated, 
it continues to worsen, with increasing risk of vision-threatening complications, including diabetic 
macular edema (DME), macular ischemia, and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). 
Classification of DR 
Diabetic retinopathy is classified as either non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) or PDR, based 
on the absence or presence of abnormal new vessels, respectively. NPDR is the earliest stage of DR, 
which is characterised by abnormalities visible by ophthalmoscopy that include microaneurysms, 
intraretinal hemorrhages, exudates, retinal nerve fiber layer infarcts (cotton wool spots), and, in more 
severe cases, venous beading and intraretinal microvascular abnormalities. Worsening of NPDR to PDR 
is characterised by neovascularisation and is regarded as a serious, clinically important progression of 
the pathology, as well as marking the transition of the disease to an advanced stage (Wykoff et al. 
2018). PDR is associated with a high risk of visual morbidity arising from vitreous hemorrhage, traction

retinal detachment, and neovascular glaucoma (Aiello et al. 1998, Wykoff et al. 2018). Patients can 
also develop DME at any stage during the progression of DR (Ciulla et al. 2003). 
DR pathophysiology and the role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 
Vascular endothelial growth factor has been implicated in all aspects of vascular pathology in DR 
(Campochiaro 2015). Increased levels of VEGF in vitreous were shown in animal models of diabetes, as 
well as in NPDR and PDR patients compared with control healthy subjects (Aiello et al 1994, Ambati et 
al 1997, Sone et al 1997). Vitreous VEGF levels in DR patients have been shown to correlate with the 
severity of DR (Funatsu and Yamashita 2003, Funatsu et al 2005, Funatsu et al 2006, Praidou et al 
2011). 
Current treatment options for DR 
Treatment of mild NPDR involves management of the patient’s diabetes; at this stage, intervention for 
the treatment of NPDR is in general not recommended, and NPDR is monitored annually, with the 
patient encouraged to maintain control of diabetes as well as possible (Royal College of 
Ophthalmologists 2012). Ocular therapy is warranted once progression to PDR occurs, or if a patient 
develops DME. The standard-of-care for PDR is panretinal photocoagulation (PRP), and based on AAO 
guidelines, anti-VEGF therapy and PRP are recommended for PDR with or without DME; focal and/or 
grid laser may also be used when clinically significant DME is present (Royal College of 
Ophthalmologists 2012, American Academy of Ophthalmology Retinal (AAO) 2017). 
Panretinal photocoagulation is a laser treatment, which involves applying laser burns scattered 
throughout the retina away from the macula. With the goal of reducing the risk of vision loss, PRP 
leads to tissue coagulation and subsequent regression or stabilization of the neovascularisation. 
According to the Diabetic Retinopathy Study, PRP reduced the risk of severe visual loss (visual acuity 
≤5/200 patients) by approximately 50 % over 5 years (Diabetic Retinopathy Study Research Group 
1981, Diabetic Retinopathy Study Research Group 1987). 
Typically, the PRP procedure involves the application of 1200–1600 laser burns, approximately 500 µm 
in size, applied throughout the retinal tissue but away from the macula, destroying viable areas of the 
retina. The destructive nature of this treatment is associated with ocular adverse effects (ETDRS 
Research Group 1991a, Fong et al 2007, Heng et al 2013, Reddy and Husain 2018). Consequences of 
PRP include irreversible destruction of peripheral retinal tissue, including potentially severe and 
permanent peripheral visual field loss, night blindness, loss of colour vision, reduced contrast 
sensitivity, recurrent vitreous hemorrhages, and PRP-induced DME exacerbation with central vision loss 
(Fong et al 2007, Ip et al 2012). Patients who undergo PRP may experience spatial orientation deficits 
related to peripheral vision loss, contributing to difficulties with executing activities of daily living 
(ETDRS Research group 1991a, Fong et al 2007, Royal College of Ophthalmologists 2012, Heng et al 
2013, AAO 2017). 
Vitreous surgery may be considered in patients with high-risk PDR. The risks of invasive surgical 
intervention include infection, iatrogenic cataract, and intraocular hemorrhage (Stefansson 2001, AAO 
2017).

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main study 
Protocol S 
Protocol S compared the efficacy of ranibizumab 0.5 mg with PRP in diabetic patients with PDR. It was 
a JCHR (DRCR.net) -sponsored Phase 3, multi-center, randomised, active-controlled, parallel-
assignment, non-inferiority study for which the primary efficacy analysis was at 2 years, with follow-up 
up to 5 years. Protocol S enrolled 305 patients (394 study eyes) with PDR, with or without concomitant 
DME at baseline. Patients had Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes with PDR and had not yet received PRP in at 
least one eye. One or two eligible study eyes could be enrolled. 
The sponsor designed and conducted the study and was responsible for the overall study management 
(monitoring), data management, and drug safety process for this clinical study. Genentech had an 
opportunity to review and comment the JCHR (DRCR.net) protocol. However, JCHR (DRCR.net) was 
under no obligation to incorporate those suggestions. Genentech was not involved in the conduct of 
the study but did provide ranibizumab to defray the study costs. Genentech also conducted the 
statistical analysis of the data for this report. 
Patients with one study eye were randomly assigned to either PRP or intravitreal ranibizumab 0.5 mg. 
If DME was present at baseline in eyes assigned to the PRP group, a baseline ranibizumab injection 
was administered, and PRP treatment was initiated within 14 days (Figure 1). Eyes in both treatment 
groups could receive study ranibizumab for DME at any time during the study. PRP was permitted in 
the ranibizumab group only if failure or futility criteria were met. For patients with 2 study eyes 
enrolled, 1 eye was randomly assigned to the PRP group, and the other eye was assigned to the 
ranibizumab group. 
Ranibizumab treatment initiation consisted of injections at baseline and every 4 weeks up to Week 12 
(total of 4 injections), and thereafter, treatment was given as needed based on disease activity.

Methods 
Study participants 
The study included male and female patients ≥18 years of age with either Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (according to American Diabetes Association or WHO guidelines) with and without DME, who 
had at least one eye who fulfilled the study eye criteria including presence of PDR and a BCVA score of 
24 (approximate Snellen equivalent 20/320) or greater on the day of randomisation. – Patients were 
excluded if they had received any anti-VEGF or pro-VEGF treatment within 4 months prior to 
randomisation, and who had macular edema due to a cause other than diabetes. 
Treatments 
Arm I (ranibizumab): 0.5 mg intravitreal injection at randomisation and at follow-up visits at 4, 8, 
and 12 weeks. Beginning at the 16-Week visit, eyes were evaluated for retreatment based on 
appearance of neovascularisation. Although PRP was deferred, PRP was allowed in cases of treatment 
failure. 
Arm II (PRP/laser): full session of 1200 to 1600 burns using 500 μm burns on the retina or the 
equivalent area treated when using indirect laser delivery systems or laser was completed within 56 
days of randomisation. Study eyes in the PRP group could receive supplemental PRP if 
neovascularisation worsened during the study following completion of the initial PRP session. 
Both: Eyes in both groups could receive ranibizumab as needed for diabetic macular edema (DME), at 
baseline or if DME developed during the course of the study. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the Protocol S study was to determine if visual acuity outcomes at 2 years 
in eyes with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) that received ranibizumab with deferred panretinal 
photocoagulation (PRP) were non-inferior to those in eyes that received standard prompt PRP therapy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/499486/2019  
Page 9/60 
 
 
 
 
Secondary objectives included: 
•  Comparing other visual function outcomes in eyes that received ranibizumab with deferred PRP 
with those in eyes that received prompt PRP. 
•  Determining percent of eyes that did not require PRP when ranibizumab was given in the absence 
of prompt PRP. 
•  Comparing safety outcomes between treatment groups. 
•  Comparing associated treatment and follow up exam costs between treatment groups. 
JCHR (DRCR.net) was responsible for the design and conduct of the study. Subsequent to finalization 
of the protocol, Genentech, Inc. (Genentech) identified additional diabetic retinopathy (DR) severity 
outcomes of interest:  
•  Proportion of eyes with ≥ 3-step improvement from baseline in ETDRS-DRSS at 1 year and 2 years 
•  Proportion of eyes with ≥ 2-step improvement from baseline in ETDRS-DRSS at 1 year and 2 years 
•  Proportion of eyes with ≥ 3-step worsening from baseline in ETDRS-DRSS at 1 year and 2 years 
•  Proportion of eyes with ≥ 2-step improvement from baseline in ETDRS-DRSS from PDR at baseline 
to NPDR at 1year or 2 years 
Deviating from the clinical trial protocol, the key outcomes to support this extension were: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Proportion of eyes/patients with at least 2-step improvement from baseline in DRSS 
Proportion of eyes/patients with at least 2-step worsening from baseline in DRSS 
Proportion of eyes/patients with at least 3-step improvement from baseline in DRSS 
Proportion of eyes/patients with at least 3-step worsening from baseline in DRSS 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy variable was the mean change from baseline in Best Corrected Visual Acuity 
(BCVA) score at 2 years. 
Secondary multiple efficacy variables including continuous (e.g. binocular visual acuity at 2 years), 
binary (e.g. proportion of eyes that gained at least 15 letters in BCVA score from baseline at 2 years, 
proportion of eyes with >= 2-step improvement from baseline in the ETDRS-DRSS score at 2 years), 
and time-to-event scores (e.g. development of DM through 2 years). 
Additional secondary efficacy variables included:  
1) Proportion of eyes with ≥ 3-step improvement from baseline in ETDRS-DRSS at 1 year and 2 years,  
2) Proportion of eyes with ≥ 2-step improvement from baseline in ETDRS-DRSS at 1 year and 2 years,  
3) Proportion of eyes with ≥ 3-step worsening from baseline in ETDRS-DRSS at 1 year and 2 years,  
4) Proportion of eyes with ≥ 2-step improvement from baseline in ETDRS-DRSS from PDR at baseline 
to NPDR at 1year or 2 years. 
Safety endpoints consisted of collecting all AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), with their severity 
and relationship to study treatment, pregnancies, physical examinations, laboratory tests and 
ophthalmic examinations. 
Subgroups were analysed according to the CSP for the BCVA endpoint (mean change from baseline in 
BCVA at 2 years) and ETDRS-DRSS response endpoint by baseline variables, including race, sex, 
baseline endpoint, baseline DME status, prior DME treatment, baseline DR severity, individual sites 
with at least 20 subjects enrolled, baseline OCT and additionally age (<65 vs. >= 65 years) and 
number of eyes enrolled (1 eye vs. 2 eyes). 
The primary endpoint was defined as ‘Mean change from baseline in BCVA score at 2 years’ and tested 
using a global type I error of 5 % (confidence level of 95 %). Multiple secondary efficacy endpoints 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/499486/2019  
Page 10/60 
 
 
 
were defined. Additional efficacy endpoints were added to the CSP and SAP, respectively, after the 2-
year data cut-off, but before Genentech-Roche and JHCR received any study results. 
The MAH states that the ETDRS-DRSS endpoint is not applicable in the PRP treatment group, as eyes 
that received PRP had large portions of their peripheral retinas destroyed because of iatrogenic PRP-
induced scars. These eyes could no longer achieve NPDR status (i.e. ETDRS-DRSS score less than 60) 
at any time point after PRP treatment was received. Therefore, the MAH was requested to address the 
issue of differential sensitivity to change of the ETDRS-DRSS endpoint in the PRP group, and the 
degree of bias the comparison between the ranibizumab and PRP treatment groups might show.  
In response, the company presented an analysis adjusting for this ETDRS-DRSS bias in the PRP (laser) 
group, whose response may have been affected by the truncation of the endpoint. The results were 
similar to the original result showing the non-inferior to PRP treatment vs PRP treatment.  
Adding secondary endpoints and finalising the SAP after data cut-off may be seen as a deviation from 
ICH E9, which states that in blinded studies finalising the SAP before unblinding is acceptable. 
However, subjects, investigators, and study coordinators were not masked in this double-masked 
study, and, therefore, finalising the SAP before database lock is recommended. However, since the 
MAH stated that the SAP was finalized before availability of data, this can be considered acceptable. 
The type 1 error of comparative tests of secondary endpoint is not globally controlled, which may lead 
to an inflation of type I error and over-interpretation of results. This issue may be mitigated by the fact 
that many of the secondary endpoints are expected to be correlated and show consistent results across 
independent samples (c.f. Protocol S, Novartis studies), and the observed effect size, respective 
significance levels, of the key outcomes. 
The MAH was asked to discuss the overall type I error, i.e. the risk of a false positive conclusion, 
considering multiple testing of all primary and (additional) secondary endpoints, primary and 
secondary visits, and additional contributing issues, such as lack of adjustment for correlatedness of 
eyes per subject (overdispersion), underestimation of variability by last observation carried forward 
(LOCF) imputation, differential sensitivity to change of endpoints (ETDRS-DRSS), and analysis in the 
intention-to-treat population. In response, the company presented results from the suggested analyses 
and relevant discussion of each of the raised issues, which are potentially affecting the risk of false 
positive results. The arguments and results convincingly show that this risk is controlled at an 
acceptable level at or below the pre-specified type I error level for each of the raised issues. The risk 
that all issues jointly might have caused false positive results is not expected to exceed the pre-
specified type I error either.  
Furthermore, the MAH was requested to justify the full session of 1200 to 1600 burns using 500 μm 
burns. This appears to translate into an incomplete PRP in a subset of patients, i.e. suboptimal 
treatment with markedly fewer burns compared with conventional PRP. In response, the company 
states that treatment guidelines for PRP defined the application of 1200–1600 burns with a spot size 
on the retina of approximately 500 μm using conventional laser (or equivalent when using a laser 
producing an automated pattern) given over 1 to 3 sessions. Overall, the company’s response was 
considered acceptable. 
Sample size 
The sample size estimate was computed for the primary study objective, to determine whether visual 
acuity in the ranibizumab group is non-inferior to visual acuity in the PRP group at 2 years. Based on 
the objectives of this study and the potential deleterious effects on visual function by PRP, a non-

inferiority margin of 5 letters was judged to be clinically acceptable. The sample size was calculated to 
be 177 eyes in each group. This was increased to 190 eyes per group (380 total eyes) to account for 
loss to follow-up. Assuming 20 % of study subjects have two study eyes (based on enrolment in 
previous JCHR (DRCR.net) studies), this equates with approximately 316 study subjects. The observed 
sample size was 305 patients and 394 eyes. 
Randomisation 
Subjects with one study eye were randomly assigned (stratified by site and presence or absence of 
central involved DME) with equal probability (1:1) to one of the treatment groups: 1) PRP group, 2) 
Ranibizumab group. Subjects with two study eyes (both eyes eligible at the time of randomisation), 
were  randomised with equal probability to either of the: 
• 
• 
PRP group in the eye with greater optical coherence tomography (OCT) central subfield and 
the ranibizumab group  in the eye with lower OCT central subfield thickness, 
Ranibizumab group in the eye with greater OCT central subfield and the PRP group  in the eye 
with lower OCT central subfield thickness. 
If both eyes had the same OCT central subfield thickness, the right eye was considered  the eye with 
the greater OCT central subfield thickness.  For the purpose of stratification,  the presence of DME was 
defined on OCT central subfield thickness as ≥ 250 microns  on Zeiss Stratus OCT (or equivalent 
thickness on spectral domain OCT machine). 
Subjects were randomised on the same day that treatment was to be initiated.  For  subjects with two 
study eyes that were treated with ranibizumab at baseline, both eyes could be injected on the same 
day or on separate days as long as the second eye was injected within one week of randomisation. 
Blinding (masking) 
Study monitors who reviewed all AEs were masked to the assigned treatments. The reading center 
graders who evaluated the fundus photographs and the visual acuity and OCT technicians were also all 
masked to treatment group assignments at annual visits. – Subjects, investigators, and study 
coordinators were not masked to treatment assignments because of the nature of the treatments.  
Based on Genentech’s own judgment, potential treatment group unmasking due to the ability to 
observe PRP scars on fundus photographs should not cause substantial bias or impact the 
interpretation of the overall ETDRS-DRSS results. 
The applied masking procedure is considered appropriate under the circumstances of the therapeutic 
procedures. Subjects, investigators, and study coordinators were not masked. However, based on the 
objective type of key endpoints (esp. BCVA and ETDRS-DRSS) and masking of assessors, the 
conclusion of the MAH that potential bias or impact on the interpretation on BCVA or ETDRS-DRSS 
results should not be substantial can be supported. 
Statistical methods 
The primary analysis was performed in the ITT (“randomised eyes”) population with missing values 
imputed by the “last observation carried forward” (LOCF) method. 
The null hypothesis that ranibizumab is inferior to laser treatment was tested using the primary 
endpoint “Mean change from baseline in BCVA score at 2 years” (see continuous variables below for 
statistical model), using a non-inferiority margin of 5 letters, and secondary endpoints (continuous, 
binary, time-to-event). However, selected secondary and additional secondary endpoints based on 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/499486/2019  
Page 12/60 
 
 
 
 
ETDRS-DRSS 2-step or 3-step change responder endpoints (improvement or worsening) were 
presented as key outcomes (see binary variables below for statistical model) in the marketing 
authorization application. 
For stratified analyses of continuous variables, the estimates and CIs of the mean for each 
treatment group and the difference in means between treatment groups were based on the analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) or the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model used to analyse the endpoint. For 
unstratified analyses of means, the estimates and CIs were based on the observed means, difference 
in observed means, and the Student t distribution. 
For stratified analyses of binary variables, the proportion for each treatment group and the overall 
difference in proportions between treatment groups were estimated using the weighted average of the 
observed proportions and the differences in observed proportions over the strata using the Cochran–
Mantel–Haenszel (CMH) weights. The stratification variables were the same as those used in the 
stratified test for treatment difference. CIs of the proportion for each treatment group and the overall 
difference in proportions between treatment groups (unstratified or stratified) were calculated using 
the normal approximation to the binomial distribution method. For unstratified analyses of proportions, 
the proportion for each treatment group and the overall difference in proportions between treatment 
groups were estimated using the observed proportions and the difference in the observed proportions. 
All efficacy analyses (unless otherwise noted) were stratified by baseline DME status, and number of 
study eyes enrolled. In addition to p-values for statistical tests, the point estimates and confidence 
intervals (CIs) were provided for the mean (for continuous variables) or proportion (for binary 
variables) for each treatment group and the difference in means or proportions between the two 
treatment groups. All CIs were two sided and at the 95 % level.  
Missing data was imputed by using the ‘last value carried forward’ (LOCF) method, however, additional 
sensitivity analysis for mean change from baseline in BCVA at 2 years and ETDRS-DRSS step change 
endpoints at 2 years were performed based on 1) observed data, and 2) MCMC multiple imputation. 
Safety analyses were performed in the ‘safety-evaluable eyes’ and ‘safety-evaluable subjects’ datasets. 
Safety endpoints consisted of AEs with their severity and relationship to study treatment, pregnancies, 
physical examinations, laboratory tests and ophthalmic examinations during the 2-year period up to 
and including the 2-year visit. 
The non-inferiority margin of 5 letters for the primary endpoint can be considered wide and based on 
previous CHMP advice a 3–4 letter margin would have been better justified. However, this has no 
implications as the adjusted least squares mean treatment group difference was 3.5 letters (95 % CI: 
0.2, 6.7 letters) and non-inferiority of Lucentis vs. PRP was consequently demonstrated. 
In Protocol S non-inferiority hypotheses were tested in a (modified) ITT population, which may not 
always be conservative. Therefore, the MAH was asked to also provide results of the key outcome 
parameters and key visits in a per protocol population. In response, the MAH provided results for BCVA 
and DRSS on the per protocol set of eyes which showed to be similar to the results from the analyses 
on all randomized eyes (ITT population).  
From statistical perspective, the LOCF method for imputation of missing data is in general not 
recommended. Depending on the proportion and type of missing data per treatment group, the 
method may under- or overestimate the results and underestimate variability. Here, additional 
sensitivity analysis based on observed data (valid under missing-completely-at-random assumption) 
and MCMC-based multiple imputation (valid under missing-at-random assumption) are performed, 
which showed results consistent with the primary analysis. 
Assessment report

It has not been explained why in the summary and overview the primary endpoint of visual acuity is 
presented in section on additional efficacy outcomes. 
The analysis units of the Protocol S study are eyes, which may be of the same patient and therefore 
correlated. Systematic differences between eyes from patients, which contributed one eye, and eyes 
from patients, which contributed two eyes, are modelled by the covariate or strata “one vs. two eyes”. 
However, this model does not adjust for underestimation of the variability of the outcomes because of 
the correlatedness of observations (c.f. overdispersion). Therefore, the provided confidence intervals 
may to be too narrow and lead to false positive conclusions. This issue may be aggravated by the 
combination with LOCF method, which may also underestimate variability. The MAH was asked to 
discuss this issue and provide appropriate sensitivity analyses, for example, by using a generalized 
(mixed) effects model for the primary endpoint and presented key outcomes using the patient 
identifier as random (or fixed) effects variable. In response, the company provided the results using a 
generalised linear mixed effects model, including the correlation between both eyes using imputed 
data based on LOCF or multiple imputation. The results of the estimates and 95 % confidence intervals 
were similar to the results from the original analyses, although the 95 % confidence intervals of the 
sensitivity analyses were somewhat wider (as expected).

Conduct of the study 
Amendments 
The protocol was finalised on 6 October 2011 (version 1). It was amended after enrolment of the first 
subject and finalised on 28 October 2014 (version 2). The purpose of this amendment was to extend 
the treatment schedule up to 5 years to collect long-term safety and efficacy data. 
Additional analyses 
Genentech developed a SAP that describes the analysis of the Protocol S study efficacy and safety data 
used to support the approval of ranibizumab in the treatment of DR independent of DME status. 
Genentech’s SAP describes the analysis methods used to analyse the pre-specified endpoints from the 
JCHR (DRCR.net) protocol and additional efficacy and safety outcome measures evaluated by 
Genentech, which were not identified in the JCHR (DRCR.net) protocol. In addition, there was no strict 
Type I error management plan for the proposed analyses of the Protocol S study data. 
The addition of secondary endpoints after the 2-year data cut-off is acceptable, provided that the MAH 
was not influenced by the collected data (as stated). 
While the type I error is considered controlled for the primary endpoint ‘Mean change from baseline in 
BCVA score at 2 years’, the presentation of results is primarily based on multiple ETDRS-DRSS step 
change responder endpoints and multiple visits, for which no strict type I error control is applied, 
which may lead to an inflation of type I error and over-interpretation of results (see above). 
Protocol deviations 
Major deviations with a severity classification of 1 or 2 were defined as critical deviations and typically 
involve potential significant impact to subject safety or a major effect on the evaluation of study 
outcome. A total of 23 subjects (approximately 8 %) had at least one major protocol deviation through 
2 years; 10 subjects (9.8 %) in the ranibizumab-1 study eye group, 4 subjects (3.5 %) in the PRP “1 
study eye group”, and 9 subjects (10.1 %) in the 2 study eyes group (Table 2). The most common 
deviation was ‘Injection not performed’, occurring in 5 subjects in the ranibizumab-1 study eye group, 
0 subjects in the PRP-1 study eye group and 8 subjects (9.0 %) in the 2 study eyes group. This 
deviation pertains to ranibizumab injections. One randomised subject (a subject with one study eye 
enrolled and randomised to the PRP group) had an exclusion criterion missed.

Baseline data 
In Protocol S, demographic and baseline characteristics and the baseline ocular characteristics were 
balanced across the two treatment groups (Table 3).

The mean age of enrolled patients was approximately 51 years; 44 % were women, 71 % were White, 
and 75 % had Type 2 diabetes. The mean HbA1c at baseline was similar between the ranibizumab and 
PRP groups (9.02 % vs. 9.10 %, respectively, i.e. approximately 75 mmol/ml) as was the mean 
duration of diabetes at baseline (18.0 vs. 16.6 years, respectively). 
The mean baseline visual acuity level was similar between the ranibizumab and PRP groups (75.0 vs. 
75.2 letters, respectively). A total of 88 (22.3 %) eyes had baseline DME and 306 (77.7 %) eyes did 
not have DME at baseline. 
Table 4. Baseline ocular characteristics in the study eye, randomised eyes. 
The baseline DRSS levels were balanced across the 2 treatment groups. In the ranibizumab and PRP 
groups, respectively, the most common baseline DR severity levels were moderate PDR (levels 65A-
65C) (35.6 % and 33.0 %), high-risk PDR (levels 71A-71D) (24.6 % and 26.1 %), and mild PDR 
(levels 61A-61B) (15.7 % and 15.3 %). Of note, evaluation of DR for inclusion into the study was 
determined by the investigator; DR severity was assessed by the central reading center. 
The study groups were sufficiently balanced at baseline. More than 70 % of subjects had Type 2 
diabetes. Assessed by current European treatment guidelines, the glycaemic control was poor with 
mean HbA1c levels at baseline as high as 75 mmol/mol. The company was requested to discuss the 
external validity of the results. In response, the MAH presented data that the observed mean HbA1c in 
the US population enrolled in Protocol S is similar to the European population with PDR and thus 
sufficiently representative and reflective of a generally poor glycaemic control in this population. 
Numbers analysed 
The analysis populations are summarised in Table 5. The ITT population (all randomised eyes) was the 
analysis population used for the efficacy analyses. The safety-evaluable populations, defined on the 
basis of treatment actually received, were the analysis populations used for the safety analyses; safety

evaluable eyes were used for ocular safety analyses and safety evaluable subjects were used for non-
ocular safety analyses. – 54.2 % of subjects in the comparator group received also ranibizumab (Table 
6). 
As 54.2 % of subjects in the comparator group received also ranibizumab the MAH was requested to 
present a sensitivity analysis of subgroups receiving only PRP treatment and only ranibizumab 
treatment. In response, the MAH presented sensitivity subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint 
demonstrating consistency with the original application, showing descriptively superiority of the 
‘ranibizumab only’ vs. ‘PRP only’ treatment group at multiple timepoints.

Outcomes and estimation 
Protocol S 
The majority of eyes randomised to ranibizumab (94.8 %) and PRP (94.6 %) completed the study 
through at least 1 year; through 2 years, 85.3 % of eyes in the ranibizumab group and 86.7 % of eyes 
in the PRP group completed the study. The most common reasons for discontinuation prior to 2 years 
were death and patient lost to follow-up in the ranibizumab group (5.2 % each) and patient lost to 
follow-up (5.4 %) and death (3.9 %) in the PRP group. 
Effect on visual acuity 
The main outcome of the study was the mean visual acuity letter score improvement from baseline at 
2 years, which was 2.7 letters in the ranibizumab group and -0.7 letters in the PRP group (Table 7, 
Figure 3). The adjusted least squares mean treatment group difference was 3.5 letters (95 % CI: 0.2, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/499486/2019

6.7 letters). The pre-specified non-inferiority margin for the primary endpoint was 5 letters. Non-
inferiority was thus reached. 
The finding was supported by sensitivity analyses (different methods of handling missing data) and the 
consistent results across subgroups based on the baseline characteristics (age, race sex, baseline 
BCVA, baseline DME status, prior DME treatment, baseline DR severity, number of eyes enrolled and 
baseline OCT.

A larger proportion of patients in the ranibizumab 0.5 mg group had a ≥2-step improvement in DRSS 
from baseline at 1 year and at 2 years than in the PRP treatment group. Similar results were observed 
in patients with and without DME. 
At 1 year, 41.8 % of eyes in the ranibizumab group had ≥2-step improvement in DRSS from baseline 
compared with 14.6 % of eyes the PRP group, a difference of 27.4 %. 
At 2 years, 42.3 % of eyes in the ranibizumab group had ≥2-step improvement in DRSS from baseline 
compared with 23.1 % of eyes the PRP group (19.2 % difference) (Table 8). In the ranibizumab group, 
results for ≥2-step improvement in DRSS from baseline were observed in 58.5 % of eyes with baseline 
DME and 37.8 % of eyes without DME, respectively. The consistent improvements in DRSS in the 
ranibizumab groups (overall and by baseline DME status) were supported by the proportion of eyes 
with ≥3-step improvement: 29.1 % overall (31.7 % and 28.4 % of eyes with and without baseline 
DME, respectively). 
In the ranibizumab group, at 2 years, 4 eyes (2.1 %) had ≥3-step worsening and 7 eyes (3.7 %) had 
≥2-step worsening; in the PRP group 11 eyes (5.5 %) had ≥3-step worsening of and 23 eyes (11.6 %) 
had ≥2-step worsening.

Ranibizumab treatment improved DR, with 2.7 letter gain in the mean BCVA score from baseline to 2 
years, compared with 0.7 letter loss in the PRP group. In addition, larger proportions of eyes/patients 
achieved ≥2-step or ≥3-step DRSS improvement from baseline following ranibizumab treatment 
compared with PRP. 
Comparative tests, estimates of difference and their confidence intervals between groups were initially 
not provided  for subgroups (with DME, without DME, Table 8) and for visit at year 2 (Table 8) and the 
MAH was asked to provide these additional results.  In response, the MAH provided data 
demonstrating that eyes in the ranibizumab group experienced a (at least nominally) statistically 
significant and clinically relevant benefit in terms of improvements in DRSS compared with eyes that

received PRP, consistent with results from the original application. This benefit was observed at Year 1 
and Year 2, and regardless of the presence or absence of DME at baseline. 
Additional efficacy outcomes 
Patients with NPDR without DME 
While Protocol S aimed to enrol only patients with PDR, the study population also included 23 eyes 
with moderately severe to severe NPDR without DME (9 in the ranibizumab group and 14 in the PRP 
group). Of the 9 eyes in the ranibizumab group, 7 had evaluable DRSS at 1 year, and 4 of these 7 
eyes had ≥2-step improvement; the remaining 3 eyes had <2-step worsening. Of 14 eyes in the PRP 
group, 12 had evaluable DRSS at 1 year, and only 1 of these 12 eyes had a ≥2-step improvement, 
while 11 had ≥2-step worsening. Although the number of patients with moderately severe to severe 
NPDR without DME included in Protocol S was small, these results indicate difference between 
ranibizumab and PRP groups for the proportion of patients with ≥2-step improvement. 
These data were considered limited and had methodological shortcomings e.g. the subgroup analyses 
(moderately severe NPDR, severe NPDR and PDR) were not pre-specified. While the link between 
progression on the DRSS and the risk of developing sight threatening complications is established, the 
link between an improvement in DRSS and a decreased risk for sight-threatening complications in 
patients with moderately severe to severe NPDR needs to be shown to support the targeted indication, 
as the benefit–risk profile may differ between moderately severe and severe DRSS without DME. 
Based on the feedback on the limitations of the presented dataset, the applicant decided to revise the 
indication of the application as follows by excluding NPDR: “Lucentis is indicated in adults for the 
treatment of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR)”  
Development of DME 
The time-to-development of DME in eyes without baseline DME was analysed for Protocol S. A lower 
proportion of patients in the ranibizumab group without baseline DME developed DME compared with 
the PRP group without baseline DME. At 1 year, of the ranibizumab group without baseline DME 
(n=149) and the PRP group without baseline DME (n=157), 6 % and 24 %, respectively, had 
developed DME. At 2 years, 10.5 % of the ranibizumab group without baseline DME and 28.6 % of the 
PRP group without DME had developed DME. 
Improvement from PDR at baseline to NPDR 
In the ranibizumab group, at the 1-year or 2-year visits, respectively, 48 eyes (28.2 %, 95 % CI: 21.5 
%, 35.0 %) and 46 eyes (27.1 %, 95 % CI: 20.4 %, 33.7 %) with baseline PDR (DRSS ≥60) had 
improved to NPDR (DRSS <60) as determined on fundus photographs. Improvement from PDR to 
NPDR was comparable between groups of eyes with or without DME at baseline. 
In the PRP group, due to retinal scars caused by PRP treatment, evaluation of improvement to NPDR 
(DRSS <60) in PRP-treated eyes is not possible. Therefore, in the results, this group of patients were 
classified as not applicable. 
Proportion of eyes with DR complications and eyes receiving vitrectomy 
The ranibizumab and PRP groups in Protocol S were compared for the occurrence of the following DR 
outcomes of interest: retinal detachment, vitreous hemorrhage, vitrectomy, development of 
neovascular glaucoma, and development of iris neovascularisation. The proportion of eyes with 
resolution of neovascularisation was also assessed. 
Through the 2-year visit, vitrectomy was performed in a lower proportion of eyes in the ranibizumab 
group (4.5 %) compared with the PRP group (15.9 %). The proportion of eyes with neovascular

glaucoma, neovascularisation of the iris, or vitreous hemorrhage was comparable between the 2 
treatment groups, and a numerically lower percentage of patients had retinal detachment in the 
ranibizumab group compared with the PRP group. 
At 1 year, a larger proportion of eyes in the ranibizumab group experienced resolution of 
neovascularisation compared with the PRP group (treatment difference of 13.3 %, 95 % CI: 3.1 %, 
23.4 %). At 2 years, the percentage of eyes with resolution of neovascularisation was similar between 
the groups. 
Humphrey visual field testing 
Peripheral visual function was evaluated at 2 years using the Humphrey visual field test and compared 
with PRP, ranibizumab treatment led to the preservation of peripheral visual function.

Notes 
Results of ETDRS-DRSS ≥3 step changes responder endpoints were consistent with 
ETDRS-DRSS ≥2 step changes responder endpoints. 
Key outcome endpoints were not adjusted for multiple testing, i.e. type I error is not 
controlled.  
In the PRP group, due to retinal scarring caused by PRP treatment, evaluation of improvement to NPDR 
(DRSS <60) is not possible. Therefore, this group has been classified as not applicable. 
While the type I error is considered controlled for the primary endpoint ‘Mean change from baseline in 
BCVA score at 2 years’, however, the presentation of results is much focused on multiple ETDRS-DRSS 
step change responder endpoints and multiple visits, for which no strict type I error control is applied, 
which may lead to an inflation of type I error and over-interpretation of results.  
In response to this concern, the MAH provided sensitivity analyses showing a risk at an acceptable 
level at or below the pre-specified type I error level for each of the raised issues (multiple testing, 
underestimation of variability etc). The risk that all issues jointly might have caused false positive 
results is not expected to exceed the pre-specified type I error either.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Novartis studies (D2301, D2303, D2305) 
To evaluate the potential benefit of ranibizumab treatment on the underlying DR in patients with DME, 
pooled data from three Novartis sponsored studies (D2301, D2303, and D2305) were analysed. This 
pooled dataset included patients with NPDR, which formed the population of patients with moderately 
severe NPDR or worse, together with Protocol S. 
The three studies were randomised, double-masked, active-controlled, Phase 3 studies in patients with 
visual impairment due to DME. The studies compared ranibizumab 0.5 mg intravitreal injections (plus 
sham laser), ranibizumab 0.5 mg intravitreal injections with active laser (D2301 and D2303 only), and 
laser treatment plus sham injections. 
The studies had similar designs. All had a 1-year treatment duration, and in all cases, treatment was 
to be given monthly and continued until maximum visual acuity was achieved, i.e., until the patient’s 
visual acuity was stable for 3 consecutive monthly assessments performed while on ranibizumab 
treatment. Treatment was to be resumed when monitoring indicated loss of visual acuity due to DME. 
– This treatment regimen is consistent with the approved European label in patients with visual 
impairment due to DME. 
Change in DR was investigated as a pre-planned exploratory objective in all 3 clinical studies based on 
grading of fundus colour photographs taken at Baseline, Month 6 and 1 year. Only one eye was 
selected and treated as the study eye in all 3 studies. 
The similar design of the three studies justifies the pooling of the data. The pooled data have been 
presented and assessed before in EMEA/H/C/000715/II/0069, when it was concluded that there was 
no statistical evidence of heterogeneity. However, the limited number of subjects within each study in 
the subgroup of patients with moderately severe NPDR or worse was recognised. 
In the target DR population from the Novartis studies, a larger proportion of patients in the 
ranibizumab 0.5 mg group had a ≥2-step improvement in DRSS from baseline at 1 year than in the 
laser group (48.4 % vs 14.6 %, respectively, Table 10). In addition, a smaller proportion of patients in 
the ranibizumab group than in the laser group had a ≥2-step worsening from baseline (2.1 % vs 8.1 
%, respectively). The difference between ranibizumab 0.5 mg and laser in the target DR population 
was considered clinically relevant for ≥2-step improvement using both last observation carried forward 
(LOCF) data (29.9 %, 95 % CI: 20.0, 39.7) and observed data (30.3 %, 95 % CI: 19.9, 40.8). 
Likewise, a larger proportion of patients in the ranibizumab groups had a ≥3-step improvement in 
DRSS from baseline at 1 year than in the laser group (21.9 % vs. 6.5 %, respectively). In addition, a 
smaller proportion of patients in the ranibizumab group than in the laser group had a ≥3-step 
worsening from baseline (1.0 % vs 4.9 %, respectively). 
When ≥2-step improvement in DRSS (10-point scale) from baseline at 1 year was assessed by 
baseline DRSS group for the target DR population, a larger proportion of patients in the ranibizumab 
group achieved a ≥2-step improvement from baseline at 1 year compared with the laser group for 
each DRSS grouping (Table 11). Within the ranibizumab group, the proportions of patients 
experiencing a ≥2-step improvement were high for all baseline DRSS groups; in moderately severe 
NPDR and severe NPDR, the proportions were similar, and it was higher in PDR patients.

Patients with NPDR without DME 
While Novartis studies enrolled only patients with DME, DME could resolve during the course of the 
study following treatment with ranibizumab. At 6 months, DME had resolved (central subfield thickness 
<250 µm) in 46 patients with moderately severe to severe NPDR. A post hoc analysis of DRSS change 
from 6 months to 1 year was performed. Of the 46 patients, 25 received at least 1 ranibizumab 
injection between 6 months and 1 year and 21 patients did not receive an injection within this period. 
In patients who received at least 1 injection, the proportion with ≥2-step improvement in DRSS over 6 
months was numerically larger (28.0 %, 7 patients) and twice that of patients who did not receive any 
injection (14.3 %, 3 patients). 
Although the DRSS results in patients with NPDR without DME were consistent with those observed for 
patients with NPDR with DME, or PDR regardless of the presence of DME, the numbers are few and the 
interpretation of the results is weakened by the post hoc nature of the analysis. Combined with the 
even smaller number of subjects in Protocol S, these data cannot be considered sufficient to support 
the NPDR indication by itself.

In summary, in light of the CHMP’s comments regarding the limited data in patients with moderately 
severe and severe NPDR (as well as issues related to the standard of care in this population), the MAH 
proposed to revise the indication excluding NPDR patients.  
Development of PDR 
In the subgroup of target DR patients with moderately severe to severe NPDR at baseline, at 1 year, 
a smaller proportion of patients treated with ranibizumab experienced progression from NPDR to PDR 
compared with those who received laser treatment: 10 (7.6 %) patients in the ranibizumab group and 
11 (11.8 %) patients in the laser group progressed. 
Effect on visual acuity 
In all 3 studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was met. Ranibizumab monotherapy was superior 
compared with laser therapy in the improvement of visual acuity in patients with visual impairment 
due to DME. The mean average BCVA change from Month 1 to Year 1 compared with baseline in the 
total patient population ranged from +5.9 to +6.8 letters in the ranibizumab group and +0.8 to +1.4 
letters in the laser group. 
The results from pooled data are in line with the findings of Protocol S. However, although the DRSS 
results in patients with NPDR without DME were consistent with those observed for patients with NPDR 
with DME, or PDR regardless of the presence of DME, the numbers are few and the interpretation of 
the results is weakened by the post hoc nature of the analysis. Combined with the even smaller 
number of subjects in Protocol S, this data was not considered sufficient to support the NPDR without 
DME indication. See above.

Figure 4.

For the visual acuity endpoint, the treatment effect of ranibizumab versus PRP was generally consistent 
with the overall results across the subgroups (mean change from baseline by BCVA, DME status, prior 
DME treatment, baseline ETDRS-DRSS, baseline OCT, race, sex). The additional subgroups by age and 
number of study eyes enrolled were added by Genentech. 
The results for subgroups with small sample sizes should be interpreted with caution: baseline age 65 
(18 eyes in ranibizumab group and 16 eyes in PRP group); and other race (16 eyes in ranibizumab 
group and 17 eyes in PRP group). 
Eyes with lower baseline BCVA scores (baseline BCVA <79 letters) had larger visual acuity 
improvements compared with eyes with higher baseline BCVA scores (baseline BCVA 79 letters), 
because no further improvement was possible in the eyes with better baseline vision. 
The subgroup defined by baseline DME was considered the main subgroup of interest. Table 12 shows 
the mean change from baseline in BCVA at 2 years across the subgroups by baseline DME status. Eyes 
with baseline DME (based on OCT and visual acuity criteria) had larger visual acuity improvements 
compared with eyes without DME at baseline, partly because of the limited room for improvement in 
already well-seeing non-DME eyes.

DME status (LOCF method), randomised eyes.

For the ETDRS-DRSS endpoints of the proportion of eyes with ≥3-step and ≥2-step improvement from 
baseline in ETDRS-DRSS at 2 years (Figure 5, Figure 6), the treatment effect of ranibizumab versus 
PRP was generally consistent with the overall results across the subgroups examined. 
The results for subgroups with small sample sizes should again be interpreted with caution: baseline 
age ≥65 (18 eyes in ranibizumab group, and 16 eyes in PRP group); and other race (15 eyes in 
ranibizumab group, and 16 eyes in PRP group).  
ETDRS-DRSS step improvement was associated with baseline DR severity score. Across both treatment 
groups, a higher proportion of eyes with higher baseline DR severity scores (baseline ETDRS-DRSS 
level 71) had 3-step and 2-step improvement from baseline compared with eyes with lower baseline 
DR severity scores (baseline ETDRS-DRSS level 71). 
The subgroup defined by baseline DME was considered the main subgroup of interest (Table 13). 
Efficacy was demonstrated by the percentage of eyes in the ranibizumab group achieved ≥2-step (48.8 
% and 39.9 %) and ≥3-step (31.7 % and 48.8 %) improvement in ETDRS-DRSS from baseline at 2 
years, across both subgroups with and without baseline DME. The figures in PRP group were modest.

Novartis studies (D2301, D2303, D2305) 
To assess consistency of the treatment effects across different diabetic characteristics in the target DR 
population, subgroup analyses were performed for at least 2- and 3-step changes from baseline in 
DRSS by baseline HbA1c (<8 %, ≥8 %, i.e. <64 mmol/mol, ≥64 mmol/mol) and duration of diabetes 
(time since most recent diagnosis <10 years, ≥10 years). A subgroup analysis of ≥2-step 
improvement from baseline in DRSS by race (Caucasian vs. Asian) was also performed.

Demographic factors 
Treatment response (≥2-step improvement in DRSS) was similar regardless of race (Caucasian in 
D2301 vs. Asian in D2303 and D2305). A homogeneous treatment effect with ranibizumab was 
demonstrated in the target DR population. The MAH proposes that this demonstrates that the Asian 
populations in Studies D2303 and D2305 are relevant for a global population.

Hb1Ac level 
Glycosylated HbA1c was assessed at baseline and at Months 3, 6, 9 and 12 in the Novartis studies and 
was stable and controlled over time. For the 1-year duration of the studies, glycemic control was stable 
for the pooled Novartis dataset, as demonstrated by similar and consistent mean HbA1c levels at each 
study visit across the groups as well as a nominal change from baseline in HbA1c levels (Table 14). 
To evaluate the impact of glycemic control at baseline on the change in DR severity, a subgroup 
analysis by baseline HbA1c levels (<8 %, ≥8 %) was performed in the target DR population. Results 
indicated a positive response to ranibizumab 0.5 mg treatment regardless of the baseline HbA1c level. 
Duration of diabetes 
An analysis of 2- and 3-step changes from baseline in DRSS by duration of diabetes (<10 years or ≥10 
years) was performed in the target DR population. A similar response to treatment was observed 
regardless of duration of disease. 
Across the subgroups examined, the treatment effect of ranibizumab versus PRP for mean change in 
visual acuity and the proportion of eyes with ≥2-step improvement in ETPRS-DRSS from baseline was 
generally consistent with the overall results. Results of the subgroup analysis of the proportion of eyes 
with ≥3-step improvement from baseline were similar. Regarding the pooled data set, by current 
European standards, it is debatable whether consistent levels above 7 % (>53 mmol/mol) represent 
satisfactory diabetes control. In response to this concern, the MAH presented data that the observed 
mean HbA1c in the US population enrolled in Protocol S is similar to the European population with PDR 
and thus is sufficiently representative and reflective of a generally poor glycemic control in this 
population. 
Published supportive studies (long-term data) 
Five-year efficacy data from Protocol S have been published by Gross et al. (2018) and the publication 
was submitted with this application. 2- and 3-year efficacy data are also available from the RISE and 
RIDE studies (Nguyen et al. 2012, Brown et al. 2013, Ip et al. 2015) and 5 years from Protocol I. 
Protocol S was originally planned a 2-year study, with follow-up subsequently amended up to 5 years. 
At 2 years, a response to treatment with ranibizumab 0.5 mg was observed, with improved mean 
BCVA and a larger proportion of eyes in the ranibizumab group achieving ≥2-step improvement and 
≥3-step improvement in DRSS from baseline than eyes in the PRP group. 
Efficacy was maintained across the 5-year treatment duration, as described by Gross et al. (2018). The 
5-year visit was completed for 117 (69 %) study eyes in the ranibizumab group and 123 (65 %) study 
eyes in the PRP group, excluding deaths in both groups (Figure 8).

The mean (SD) changes in visual acuity from baseline in the ranibizumab and PRP groups were 
comparable 3.1 (14.3) and 3.0 (10.5) letters, respectively (Table 15, Figure 9). Among 90 eyes in the 
ranibizumab group that had gradable colour fundus photographs at 5 years, 41 (46 %) had ≥2-step 
improvement in DRSS from baseline, including 30 (33 %) with NPDR, and 9 (10 %) with complete 
resolution of DR (ETDRS level 20 or better) on fundus photographs. In eyes without DME at baseline 
(N=192), lower rates of development of DME were observed in the ranibizumab group compared with 
the PRP group (Hazard Ratio = 0.4; 95 % CI: 0.3, 0.7; P <0.001).  
Through 5 years, the proportion of eyes with retinal detachment, neovascular glaucoma, 
neovascularisation of the iris, or vitreous hemorrhage was similar between the two treatment groups. 
There were no signs of development of tolerance or loss of efficacy following long-term administration 
of ranibizumab in Protocol S.

Although efficacy of ranibizumab was maintained during the Protocol S follow-up up to 5 years, the 
advantage of ranibizumab over PRP in visual acuity waned and the ranibizumab and PRP groups proved 
comparable with an improvement of 3.1 and 3.0 letters, respectively. The researchers correctly 
conclude that either ranibizumab or PRP are viable treatment options for patients with PDR. 
The comparator group appears to have slightly improved over time. The MAH present data on rescue 
treatment in the comparator group over time. A sensitivity analysis of PRP only compared with 
ranibizumab only should be presented. 
In response, the MAH presented a sensitivity analysis of ‘PRP only’ compared with ‘ranibizumab only’ 
treatment for mean best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) change at 2 years and Early Treatment 
Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)-DRSS ≥ 2 step at 1, 2, or 5 years after baseline was performed. , 
The results showed consistency with results from the original application, showing descriptively 
superiority of the ‘ranibizumab only’ vs. ‘PRP only’ treatment group at multiple timepoints. 
RIDE and RISE were 3-year studies in patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes with DME comparing 
the efficacy and safety of ranibizumab with sham (Ip et al 2012, Nguyen et al 2012, Brown et al 2013, 
Ip et al 2015). The studies were identically designed, randomised, Phase 3, double-masked, 
multicenter sham injection-controlled studies. After the main analyses of data at 2 years, sham-arm 
patients were allowed to crossover to the ranibizumab 0.5 mg arm, but the masked treatment period 
continued to Year 3, after which, additional analyses were performed. 
The main efficacy outcomes from RISE and RIDE for Years 2 and 3 are summarised in Ip et al. (2012) 
and Ip et al. (2015), respectively. Additionally, a post hoc analysis from Wykoff et al. (2018) evaluated 
DR outcomes through 3 years in patients with moderately severe or severe NPDR who were at the 
highest risk for progressing to PDR. The results in patients with moderately severe to severe NPDR are 
summarised below as they are proposed to be relevant to the current patient population. 
Improvement/worsening in DRSS from baseline 
Total population (Ip et al. 2012, Ip et al. 2015). Overall, patients with DR treated with 
ranibizumab 0.5 mg improved in DRSS compared with patients in the sham control groups. At 1 year, 
for the pooled RISE and RIDE population, 30.8 % of patients in the ranibizumab 0.5 mg group had ≥2-
step improvement in DRSS from baseline compared with 2.5 % in the sham treatment group; at 2 
years, 35.9 % of patients in the ranibizumab 0.5 mg group had ≥2-step improvement in DRSS from 
baseline compared with 5.4 % in the sham treatment group. 
Treatment benefits observed in the ranibizumab groups at 2 years were maintained up to 3 years. 
Sham patients who crossed over to receive ranibizumab 0.5 mg after 2 years (the sham/0.5-mg 
group) did not experience the same magnitude of benefit as those treated with ranibizumab from the 
beginning (Ip et al 2012, Ip et al 2015). 
Patients with moderately severe or severe NPDR at baseline (Wykoff et al. 2018). In patients 
with moderately severe or severe NPDR at baseline (DR levels 47/53), at 2 years, rates of ≥2-step 
improvement were greater in the ranibizumab group compared with sham control (ranibizumab 0.5 mg 
(N=74) vs. sham (N=86): 81.1 % vs. 11.6 %, respectively) (Wykoff et al 2018, [SCE-Section 
3.2.2.1]). Improvements in DRSS in the ranibizumab groups were sustained through 3 years. 
Development of PDR 
Total population (Nguyen et al. 2012, Ip et al. 2015). At 2 years, a lower proportion of patients 
in the ranibizumab 0.5 mg group compared with the sham group progressed to PDR in RIDE (3.9 % vs. 
11.5 %, p=0.0206) and in RISE (5.6 % vs. 15 %, p = 0.0114) (Nguyen et al 2012). By year 3, in the

pooled RISE/RIDE data, 17.1 % of eyes in the ranibizumab 0.5 mg group developed PDR compared 
with 39.1 % of eyes in the sham/ranibizumab 0.5 mg group (P < 0.0001) (Ip et al 2015). 
Patients with moderately severe or severe NPDR at baseline (Wykoff et al. 2018). 
Ranibizumab treatment signiﬁcantly reduced the probability of patients experiencing a new 
proliferative event (Wykoff et al 2018). By 2 years, the probability of experiencing a new proliferative 
event was 10.2 % in patients treated with ranibizumab 0.5 mg and 26.6 % in sham-treated patients, 
and by 3 years, the probability was 11.9 % in ranibizumab 0.5 mg and 35.2 % in sham/ranibizumab 
0.5 mg-treated patients. Of note, patients in the sham group who switched to receive ranibizumab 0.5 
mg from Year 2 did not experience the same magnitude of benefit as those treated with ranibizumab 
from the beginning. 
Protocol I (DRCR.net et al. 2010, Bressler et al. 2018) 
Protocol I was a Phase 3, multicenter, randomised clinical study conducted by the DRCR.net in patients 
with DME (DRCR.net et al 2010). Patients were randomised to 1 of 4 treatment groups: intravitreal 
ranibizumab 0.5 mg plus prompt focal/grid laser, intravitreal ranibizumab 0.5 mg plus deferred 
focal/grid laser, and intravitreal triamcinolone 4 mg plus prompt focal/grid laser compared with prompt 
focal/grid laser plus sham injection. Intravitreal injections were given every 4 weeks through the 12-
week visit; thereafter, retreatments were given following a retreatment algorithm specified in 
DRCR.net et al 2010. 
There was a total of 854 study eyes from 691 patients. Ranibizumab-assigned eyes received prompt 
laser at baseline or deferred laser beginning at 24 weeks if DME persisted and was no longer 
improving. The main outcome of the study was BCVA at 1 year, with follow-up planned for 3 years. 
After completion of the 3-year visit, participants were offered to extend the period of follow-up through 
5 years. Assessment of DR was performed by masked graders at a central reading center using colour 
fundus photographs obtained by certified photographer at baseline and Year 1, and annually between 
Years 3 and 5 (Bressler et al 2018). 
Among eyes with severe NPDR or worse at baseline, at 1 year, 28 % of eyes in the ranibizumab group 
and 19 % of eyes in the sham + prompt laser group had a ≥2-step improvement in DRSS from 
baseline (p=0.03) (DRCR.net et al 2010). A lower proportion of eyes in the ranibizumab group had 
worsening of ≥2-steps from baseline in DRSS than in the sham group (1 % vs. 8 %). At the 2-year 
follow-up, there were fewer eyes that had received PRP in the ranibizumab group than in the sham 
group (5 % vs. 22 %). Similarly, fewer eyes in the ranibizumab group had vitreous hemorrhage than 
in the sham group (5 % vs. 8 %). 
Post hoc analyses of the 5-year data were recently published (Bressler et al 2018). These analyses 
evaluated the change in DR severity by baseline DR severity subgroup in patients treated with 
ranibizumab. In patients with moderately severe to severe NPDR (level 47/53), improvement in DRSS 
was sustained over the 5-year follow-up period. At 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively, 40 % (n=121), 38 
% (n=103), and 42 % (n=85) of eyes had DR severity improvement. 
In RIDE and RISE studies, measured by ≥2-step improvement in DRSS patients with DR and DME 
treated with ranibizumab improved compared with patients in the sham control groups. This would be 
expected with sham control. In a post hoc analysis, similar results were obtained at 2 years in patients 
with moderately severe or severe NPDR at baseline. A lower proportion of patients in the ranibizumab 
group compared with the sham group progressed to PDR. In the post hoc analysis ranibizumab 
treatment reduced the probability of patients experiencing a new proliferative event. – Protocol I had a 
more complex design, but in patients with severe NPDR or worse at baseline, at 1 year, 28 % of eyes 
in the ranibizumab group and 19 % of eyes in the sham + prompt laser group had a ≥2-step

improvement in DRSS from baseline. – Post hoc, the effects of these studies were sustained over 3 to 
5 years. 
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Overall, the design of the main study (Protocol S) was appropriate. However, it aimed to enrol only 
patients with PDR, and not patients with NPDR. The assessment of efficacy is complicated by the fact 
that more than half of the subjects in the comparator group also received ranibizumab (Table 6). There 
were few protocol deviations, which did not have significant effect on the overall results. The original 
protocol with 2-year follow-up was extended to 5 years to gain long-term data. The 5-year follow-up 
has been published recently, with 34 % of subjects lost to follow-up.  
The majority of eyes randomised to ranibizumab completed the study through 2 years; 85.3 % of eyes 
in the ranibizumab group and 86.7 % of eyes in the PRP group. The most common reasons for 
discontinuation prior to 2 years were death and patient loss to follow-up in the ranibizumab group (5.2 
% each) and patient loss to follow-up (5.4 %) and death (3.9 %) in the PRP group. 
The pooled DME studies (D2301, D2303, and D2305) had similar design and the pooled analysis is 
considered justified, but these studies included only patients with DME. The pooled data have been 
presented and assessed before in EMEA/H/C/000715/II/0069, and some information was included in 
section 5.1. The limited number of subjects within each study in the subgroup of patients with 
moderately severe NPDR or severe NPDR without DME was recognised. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The efficacy findings from Protocol S and its follow-up and the pooled Novartis studies include: 
– 
In Protocol S, at 2 years, the primary endpoint of the study was met in the overall population, 
demonstrating non-inferiority of ranibizumab compared with PRP for visual acuity. Patient 
vision improved following ranibizumab treatment, but the mean VA ended up below baseline in 
the PRP group. After 5 years the difference had waned, and both treatment groups showed an 
improvement of ca. 3 letters in visual acuity. 
–  A ≥2-step improvement in DRSS from baseline between ranibizumab 0.5 mg- and PRP- or 
laser-treated patients were observed: 
o 
o 
In the overall population in Protocol S, in the ranibizumab group, 41.8 % and 42.3 % 
of eyes experienced a ≥2-step improvement from baseline at the 1-year and 2-year 
visits, respectively; the corresponding proportions of eyes in the PRP group were 14.6 
% and 23.1 %, respectively. Comparable results were observed by baseline DME 
status. 
In the pooled target DR population of the Novartis studies in patients with DME, 48.4 
% of patients in the ranibizumab group had a 2-step improvement in DRSS from 
baseline at 1 year, compared with 14.6 % of patients in the laser group. 
–  Greater proportions of patients in the ranibizumab treatment groups had ≥3-step improvement 
in DRSS compared with PRP or laser treatment: 28.6 % vs. 3.0 % in Protocol S at 1 year, 29.1 
% vs. 3.5 % in Protocol S at 2 years, and 21.9 % vs. 6.5 % in the pooled Novartis studies at 1 
year. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/499486/2019  
Page 38/60 
 
 
 
–  Results for additional efficacy outcomes related to DR and progression of DR add limited 
support for the efficacy of ranibizumab 0.5 mg in patients with moderately severe NPDR or 
worse. 
o 
In Protocol S, at 2 years: 
  A greater proportion of patients in the PRP group without DME developed DME 
compared with patients in the ranibizumab group without DME (28.6 % vs. 10.5 
%). 
  27.1 % of eyes (46 eyes) with baseline PDR improved to NPDR in the ranibizumab 
group. 
  Vitrectomy was performed in a lower proportion of eyes in the ranibizumab group 
(4.5 %) compared with the PRP group (15.9 %) and a numerically lower 
percentage of patients had retinal detachment in the ranibizumab group (5.9 %) 
compared with the PRP group (10.9 %). Other DR-related outcomes (retinal 
detachment, neovascular glaucoma, neovascularisation of the iris, and vitreous 
hemorrhage) occurred in similar proportions in both groups. 
o 
In the Novartis studies, at 1 year: 
  Among patients with moderately severe or severe NPDR and DME at baseline, a 
smaller proportion of patients treated with ranibizumab monotherapy experienced 
progression from NPDR to PDR compared with those who received laser treatment 
alone (7.6 % vs. 11.8 %). 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In Protocol S and the DR population from the Novartis studies, positive effects were observed with 
ranibizumab 0.5 mg, assessed by BCVA (Protocol S) and a ≥2-step improvement in DRSS, and 
supported by ≥3-step improvement in DRSS, progression to PDR, regression from PDR to NPDR, 
development of DME, and additional clinically relevant endpoints related to DR. 
What changes are clinically meaningful can be debated, and it has been suggested that a cut point for 
clinically meaningful change in patients with advanced eye disease should be higher than in healthy 
individuals (Kiser et al. 2005). In the 5-year follow-up 26 % or 52 % improved ≥15 or ≥10 letters in 
ranibizumab group, and, respectively 23 % or 41 % in the PRP group (Table 15). In this population, 
even slowing down of deterioration could be considered clinically meaningful. – All data, as presented, 
however, indicate that ranibizumab is non-inferior to PRP. The data are supported by published data 
from the RISE, RIDE, and Protocol I studies. The follow-up of Protocol S has been extended to 5 years 
at which point the ranibizumab and PRP groups proved comparable regarding visual acuity and serious 
PDR complications. The value of the follow-up results was somewhat compromised by the relatively 
high loss to follow-up. 
The pivotal study Protocol S only included patients with PDR. Data to support an effect in patients with 
NPDR is only derived from the pooling of previously performed studies in patients with DME. It is 
acknowledged that results are consistent with results of the Protocol S study, However, considering 
that PRP is not standard of care in this part of the target population, a sham controlled study would 
have been appropriate to fully evaluate the benefit of Lucentis. 
In conclusion, efficacy of ranibizumab 0.5 mg has been demonstrated in Protocol S in patients with 
PDR, while data are not sufficient to conclude on NPDR.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Ranibizumab as a 10 mg/ml solution for intravitreal injection is an established product with an 
extensive safety record. The safety of ranibizumab is monitored through Periodic Safety Update 
Reports (PSURs), the Risk Management Plan (RMP), and standard pharmacovigilance practices. Since 
the International Birth Date (30-June-2006), a cumulative patient exposure, based on the number of 
ranibizumab vials and ranibizumab pre-filled syringes (PFS) sold worldwide, of approximately 5.4 
million patient treatment-years has been recorded for the approved indications up to 31 May 2018 
[RMP v. 19.0]. 
Safety population, evaluations, and patient exposure 
Key safety population 
The demonstration of safety and tolerability for intravitreal ranibizumab 0.5 mg in patients with 
moderately severe NPDR or worse is based on 4 studies (Protocol S and Studies D2301, D2303, and 
D2305) in patients with diabetic eye disease that evaluated treatment with ranibizumab intravitreal 
injections compared with standard treatment (PRP or active laser treatment). Protocol S and the 
Novartis studies included patients with a wide spectrum of DR, including NPDR and PDR and patients 
with and without DME. 
Protocol S enrolled adult PDR patients (age ≥18 years) with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes with or without 
baseline DME. There was a total of 394 Safety Evaluable Eyes (ranibizumab: 191; PRP: 203) and 305 
Safety Evaluable Subjects: ranibizumab-1 study eye: 102; PRP-1 study eye: 114; 2 study eyes: 89 
(Table 6). 
Safety data from Protocol S are supported by data from the 3 Novartis studies (D2301, D2303, 
D2305), which comprised adults (age ≥18 years) with DME and Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes (with HbA1c 
≤10 % and on stable diabetes medications). Patients in Study D2301 were primarily Caucasian, 
whereas Studies D2303 and D2305 enrolled only Asian patients (mainly Chinese and Japanese in 
Study D2303 and Chinese patients only in Study D2305). Safety data were pooled for the Novartis 
studies for patients with moderately severe NPDR or worse (i.e., the target DR population), as the 
designs of the studies were similar (same study duration, schedules of study visits, and safety 
assessments methods). 
There was a total of 336 patients in the Safety set of the Novartis studies (ranibizumab: 204; laser: 
132). For the safety pooling, the primary focus was on ranibizumab 0.5 mg monotherapy versus laser 
monotherapy. All patients in the monotherapy treatment arms, who received at least 1 application of 
study treatment and had at least 1 post-baseline safety assessment, were included in the safety pool. 
Safety data for Protocol S and the pooled Novartis studies are presented separately. 
Part of the patients in both groups also received the other treatment (Table 6), but safety data has 
been presented only by the two original treatment groups. The MAH was requested to provide 
subgroup analyses. In response, the MAH provided analysis of ranibizumab only subgroup and PRP 
only subgroup, consistent with expected in the diabetic population and the known safety profile of 
ranibizumab.

Evaluations 
Protocol S 
In Protocol S, safety was assessed based on ocular and non-ocular AEs and serious adverse events 
(SAEs) and deaths. MedDRA version 18.1 was used for coding of study AEs, as this version was used in 
the Protocol S Clinical Study Report. Complete results for all safety variables are summarized in the 
[SCS]. 
Novartis performed several analyses in addition to the pre-planned 2-year safety analyses in Protocol 
S: 
–  Ocular and non-ocular AEs (any AE) and SAEs were summarized up to 1 year. 
–  Ocular and non-ocular AEs and SAEs suspected to be related to study drug and/or intravitreal 
injection were summarized up to 1 year and up to 2 years. 
Novartis studies (D2301, D2303, D2305) 
Safety was evaluated in the target DR population based on ocular and non-ocular AEs. Data presented 
include ocular and non-ocular AEs, SAEs, and AEs/SAEs suspected to be related to study drug and/or 
intravitreal injection, and AEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation. MedDRA version 21.0 
was used for coding of study AEs. 
The Safety set for the Novartis studies comprised patients with moderately severe NPDR or worse at 
baseline who had received at least 1 application of study treatment and had at least 1 post-baseline 
safety assessment. Patients were analysed according to the treatment received. 
Patient exposure 
Protocol S 
Treatment initiation in Protocol S consisted of injections at baseline and every 4 weeks up to Week 12 
(4 injections), after which assessment of stability of disease activity was performed which determined 
if further treatment was needed. 
Up to 1 year (Week 52 visit), the mean number of ranibizumab injections overall was 7.1. In patients 
randomised to the PRP group, the mean number of ranibizumab injections up to 1 year was 2.3. 
Up to 2 years, the mean number of ranibizumab injections in the ranibizumab group was 10.4 overall. 
In patients randomised to the PRP group, the mean number of injections was 3.4 (Table 16).

Novartis studies (D2301, D2303, and D2305) 
In the Novartis studies, treatment was given monthly up to Week 8 (3 injections). Thereafter, 
treatment was given as needed based on DME disease progression/activity leading to reduction of 
visual acuity. 
Although there was a difference of 1 injection during treatment initiation between the Novartis studies 
and Protocol S (3 vs. 4 injections, respectively), the mean (SD) number of ranibizumab injections 
administered up to 1 year was similar between the ranibizumab groups of the Novartis studies and 
Protocol S: 7.7 (2.79) in the Novartis studies and 7.1 (2.5) in Protocol S. 
Adverse events 
Adverse events 
Ocular and non-ocular AEs are presented separately for Protocol S and the pooled Novartis studies. 
AEs are summarised up to 1 year for Protocol S and the Novartis studies, and also up to 2 years for 
Protocol S. 
Most frequent adverse events 
Ocular adverse events 
Overall, the types of common ocular AEs observed across the treatment groups in Protocol S and the 
target DR population from the Novartis studies were consistent with those observed in previous studies 
in patients with DR and with the known safety profile of ranibizumab for approved indications. 
Protocol S 
At 1 year, 133 (69.6 %) eyes in the ranibizumab group and 139 (68.5 %) eyes in the PRP group had 
at least 1 ocular AE (Table 17). The most common ocular AEs in the study eyes were reported in 
similar proportions of both treatment groups: vitreous floaters (ranibizumab: 20.4 %, PRP: 18.2 %), 
followed by eye pain (ranibizumab: 11.5 %, PRP: 11.8 %). The AEs of vision blurred, vitreous 
hemorrhage, and visual acuity reduced were reported in a lower proportion of patients in the 
ranibizumab group compared with the PRP group. As expected for intravitreal injections, conjunctival 
hemorrhage was more frequently reported in the ranibizumab group (9.9 %) than in the PRP group 
(2.0 %). 
At 2 years, the most common ocular AEs occurring in either group were vitreous floaters (ranibizumab: 
28.3 %, PRP: 27.6 %) followed by vitreous hemorrhage (ranibizumab: 20.4 %, PRP: 26.6 %), and 
vision blurred (ranibizumab: 16.8 %, PRP: 26.6 %) [SCS-Table 2-2].

Novartis studies (D2301, D2303, D2305) 
In the target DR population, 68 eyes (33.3 %) in the ranibizumab 0.5 mg group and 35 eyes (26.5 %) 
in the laser group had ocular AEs up to 1 year (Table 18). The most common ocular AEs (≥5 % in 
either group) were conjunctival hemorrhage (ranibizumab: 7.8 %, laser: 5.3 %) and vitreous 
hemorrhage (ranibizumab: 3.4 %, laser 4.5 %). Cataract was reported in 5 patients (2.5 %) in the 
ranibizumab group and in 1 patient (0.8 %) in the laser group. Vitreous floaters (2.9 %) and 
intraocular pressure increased (2.5 %) were reported only in the ranibizumab treatment group. Eye 
pain was reported in 8 patients (6.1 %) in the laser group and 6 patients (2.9 %) in the ranibizumab 
group. Retinal hemorrhage (3.8 %), lacrimation increased (3.0 %), eye irritation (2.3 %), and vision 
blurred (2.3 %) were reported only in the laser group. All other ocular AEs reported were in 
comparable proportions in both treatment groups.

Overall, comparable AE frequencies were seen in both study arms, but conjunctival hemorrhage was 
more frequent in the ranibizumab group, and vitreous hemorrhage was observed more often in laser 
group. Both observations could be expected and do not raise safety concerns.

Non-ocular adverse events 
Overall, the types of common non-ocular AEs observed across the treatment groups in Protocol S and 
the Novartis studies were representative of those observed in a severe, chronic diabetic population. 
Protocol S 
At 1 year, 83 (81.4 %) patients in the ranibizumab-1 study eye group, 72 (63.2 %) patients in the 
PRP-1 study eye group, and 75 (84.3 %) patients in the 2-study eyes group had at least 1 non-ocular 
AE (Table 19). The most common non-ocular AEs in the ranibizumab-1 study eye group were 
hypertension and nasopharyngitis (both 10.8 %). In the PRP-1 study eye group, the most common 
non-ocular AE were hypertension (12.3 %) and headache (10.5 %), and in the 2-study eyes group, 
the most common non-ocular AEs were headache (16.9 %) and nasopharyngitis (12.4 %). All other 
AEs occurred in less than 10.0 % of patients. 
At 2 years, the most common non-ocular AEs in the ranibizumab-1 study eye group were hypertension

hypertension (17.5 %), headache (12.3 %), nasopharyngitis (8.8 %), and nausea (8.8 %); and in the

Novartis studies (D2301, D2303, D2305) 
In the target DR population, 111 patients (54.4 %) in the ranibizumab 0.5 mg group and 80 patients 
(60.6 %) in the laser group had non-ocular AEs up to 1 year (Table 20). The most common non-ocular 
AEs were nasopharyngitis (8.8 %) and diabetic nephropathy (5.4 %) in the ranibizumab 0.5 mg group 
and nasopharyngitis (8.3 %) and hypertension (6.1 %) in the laser group. 
A greater proportion of patients in the ranibizumab 0.5 mg group than in the laser group had events of 
diabetic nephropathy (5.4 % vs. 0.8 %). Out of the 11 cases of nephropathy, only 1 case constituted 
an SAE, and the patient required dialysis. The other 10 cases were of mild or moderate severity. 
Overall, 4 out of 11 patients with an AE of nephropathy entered the study with a documented history 
of renal insufficiency or diabetic nephropathy. At screening, all but 1 patient had an abnormal urine 
protein dip stick result of +2 or +3, 5 of whom also had elevated serum creatinine levels, indicating 
pre-existing renal conditions. Two of the diabetic nephropathy cases were suspected to be related to 
study drug by the investigator. Further discussion of the events of diabetic nephropathy is in Section 
5.7. Considering the baseline characteristics of the cases reported, this is not considered to raise a 
safety concern.

Higher incidences of cough and anemia were also reported in the ranibizumab 0.5 mg group than in 
the laser group (cough: 4.9 % vs. 0.8 %; anemia: 3.4 % vs. 0 %). Cough and anemia are listed as 
adverse drug reactions (ADRs) for ranibizumab and are observed in the labelled frequency categories 
for the DR target population. Thus, these events do not represent new safety signals. 
Other common non-ocular AE (occurring in ≥3 % of patients) occurred in similar proportions between 
the 2 treatment groups and included diabetic nephropathy, hypertension, upper respiratory tract 
infection, hyperlipidemia, insomnia, back pain, and constipation.

Adverse events suspected of being related to study drug 
Protocol S 
Ocular AEs suspected of being related to study drug 
Up to 1 year, similar proportions of patients in the ranibizumab group (14.1 %) and the PRP group 
(15.3 %) had at least 1 ocular AE suspected to be related to study drug and/or intravitreal injection. 
The ocular AEs in the study eye most commonly suspected to be related to study drug in the 
ranibizumab group were vitreous floaters (ranibizumab: 4.7 %; PRP: 1.5 %), followed by conjunctival 
hemorrhage (ranibizumab: 4.2 %; PRP: 1.0 %) and eye pain (ranibizumab: 2.6 %; PRP: 3.4 %). 
Blurred vision (3.0 %), photopsia (1.0 %), visual impairment (1.0 %), and vitreous hemorrhage (1.0 
%) were suspected to be related to study drug in the PRP group alone. All other ocular AEs suspected 
to be related to the study drug occurred in less than 1 % of study eyes in either treatment group. 
In the second year of the study, there were few additional ocular AEs in either group that were 
suspected to be related to study drug and/or intravitreal injection. The most common ocular AEs in the 
study eye that were suspected to be related to study drug were vitreous floaters (ranibizumab: 6.3 %; 
PRP: 1.5 %), conjunctival hemorrhage (ranibizumab: 4.7 %; PRP: 1.5 %), and eye pain (ranibizumab: 
3.1 %; PRP: 3.9 %). 
Conjunctival hemorrhage is an identified AE related to the route of delivery of ranibizumab. 
Non-ocular AEs suspected of being related to study drug 
Up to 1 year, no patients in the ranibizumab-1 study eye group had a non-ocular AE suspected to be 
related to study drug. Two patients in the PRP-1 study eye group had procedural headache that was 
suspected to be related to the study drug. In the 2-study eyes group, 1 patient had an unevaluable 
event that was suspected to be related to study drug by the investigator. In the second year of the 
study, no additional non-ocular AEs suspected to be related to study drug were reported. 
Novartis studies (D2301, D2303, D2305) 
Ocular AEs suspected of being related to study drug 
In the target DR population, up to 1 year, similar proportions of eyes in the ranibizumab 0.5 mg group 
(35 eyes, 17.2 %) and in the laser group (19 eyes, 14.4 %) had ocular AEs suspected of being related 
to study drug and/or intravitreal injection. In the ranibizumab 0.5 mg group, the most common AEs 
(≥2 %) suspected to be related to study drug and/or intravitreal injection were conjunctival 
hemorrhage (6.9 %), vitreous floaters (2.9 %), conjunctival hyperemia (2.5 %), eye pain (2.5 %), and 
intraocular pressure increased (2.0 %). In the laser group, the most common AEs (≥2 %) suspected to 
be related to study drug and/or intravitreal injection were conjunctival hemorrhage (5.3 %), eye pain 
(3.8 %), and conjunctival hyperemia (2.3 %). The suspected ocular AEs of vitreous floaters (2.9 %) 
and intraocular pressure increased (2.0 %) were reported only for the ranibizumab treatment group, 
and eye irritation (2 patients, 1.5 %) was reported only in the laser group. 
Non-ocular AEs suspected of being related to study drug 
In the target DR population, up to 1 year, 6 patients (2.9 %) in the ranibizumab 0.5 mg group and 4 
patients (3.0 %) in the laser group had non-ocular AEs suspected of being related to study drug and/or 
intravitreal injection. All events occurred in only 1 patient each, with the exception of diabetic 
nephropathy, which occurred in 2 patients (1.0 %) in the ranibizumab 0.5 mg group, among which 1 
of the cases had a documented medical history of diabetic nephropathy and chronic renal failure. 
In conclusion, there were only few non-ocular related AEs, which occurred in similar frequency and 
without concentration on a specific event type.

Serious adverse events, deaths and other significant events 
Protocol S 
Table 21 and Table 22 summarise deaths and serious or clinically relevant AEs up to 1 year in Protocol 
S for ocular and non-ocular events, respectively. Up to 1 year, there were 5 deaths: 2 patients (2.0 %) 
in the ranibizumab-1 study eye group, 2 patients (1.8 %) in the PRP-1 study eye group, and 1 patient 
(1.1 %) in the 2 study eyes group. In the second year of the study, an additional 9 deaths were 
reported (4 patients (3.9 %) in the ranibizumab-1 study eye group, 2 patients (1.8 %) in the PRP-1 
study eye group, and 3 patients (3.4 %) in the 2 study eyes group).

year, 34 (33.3 %), 28 (24.6 %) and 20 (22.5 %) patients in the ranibizumab-1 study eye group, PRP-
1 study eye group, and 2 study eyes group, respectively, had non-ocular SAEs Up to 2 years, 42 (41.2

group, and 2 study eyes group, respectively, had non-ocular SAEs. Up to 2 years, there were no ocular 
AEs that led to permanent discontinuation and few non-ocular AEs that led to permanent 
discontinuation. 
Novartis studies (D2301, D2303, D2305) 
There were no deaths in the target DR population, and no patient in the ranibizumab 0.5 mg group had 
an ocular SAE in the study eye (Table 23). A total of 9.8 % of patients in the ranibizumab 0.5 mg 
group had non-ocular SAEs. There were few AEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation in the 
ranibizumab 0.5 mg group (4 patients, 2.0 %; 1 patient with an ocular AE in the study eye, and 3 
patients with non-ocular AEs).

Deaths 
Protocol S 
Up to 1 year, a total of 5 deaths occurred: 2 patients (2.0 %) in the ranibizumab-1 study eye group, 2 
patients (1.8 %) in the PRP-1 study eye group, and 1 patient (1.1 %) in the 2 study eyes group (Table 
22). In the second year of the study, an additional 9 deaths were reported (4 patients (3.9 %) in the 
ranibizumab-1 study eye group, 2 patients (1.8 %) in the PRP-1 study eye group, and 3 patients (3.4 
%) in the 2 study eyes group). None of the SAEs resulting in death were considered related to the 
study drug and/or intravitreal injection by the investigator. The predominant types of SAEs leading to 
death in all treatment groups were cardiovascular events or renal complications, which are common 
comorbid conditions in a chronic diabetic population. Six deaths were due to unknown causes and were 
listed only as “death”. 
The MAH has provided appropriate narratives of the 14 fatalities. 9/14 subjects were aged over 50 
years with diabetes diagnosed 5 to 35 years earlier. 4/5 of the patients younger than 50 years had had 
diabetes diagnosed 18 to 20 years ago. The deaths were mainly due to comorbidities related to 
diabetes. 
Novartis studies (D2301, D2303, D2305) 
There were no deaths in the target DR population (Table 23).

It is noted that for ranibizumab the frequency of SAEs is almost twice as high in Protocol S than in the 
pooled data. The difference is not self-explanatory. The MAH was requested to elaborate on eventual 
differences in disease severity or comorbidities in the Protocol S population, including an additional 
analysis on SAEs in patients on receiving ranibizumab or laser.  
In the provided discussion in the response, no critical imbalances were found in the base line medical 
history for the treatment groups, and consistent with the diabetic population.  
The study procedure may well have contributed to the imbalance, with more study visits in the 
ranibizumab group compared to the Novartis group in Protocol S. As the majority of patients appear to 
have pre-existing medical conditions that can explain the cardiovascular and renal adverse events, it is 
agreed that no new safety concern is detected from these data. 
Serious adverse events 
Ocular serious adverse events 
Protocol S 
There were few ocular SAEs in any treatment group. – Up to 1 year, 2 eyes (1.0 %) in the ranibizumab 
group and 1 eye (0.5 %) in the PRP group had at least 1 ocular SAE (events of endophthalmitis, 
sudden visual loss visual impairment, and vitreous floaters in 1 eye each in the ranibizumab group and 
vitreous hemorrhage in 1 eye in the PRP group). In the second year, there were 2 additional SAEs of 
vitreous hemorrhage (1 each in the ranibizumab and PRP groups). None of the SAEs were suspected to 
be related to the study drug and/or intravitreal injection by the investigator except for the SAE of 
endophthalmitis. 
Novartis studies (D2301, D2303, D2305) 
In the target DR population, no eyes had ocular SAEs in the ranibizumab 0.5 mg group, and 2 (1.5 %) 
eyes had ocular SAEs in the laser group (both events of vitreous hemorrhage). Neither of these SAEs 
was suspected by the investigator to be related to the study drug and/or intravitreal injection. 
Non-ocular serious adverse events 
Protocol S 
Up to 1 year, 34 (33.3 %), 28 (24.6 %), and 20 (22.5 %) patients in the ranibizumab-1 study eye 
group, PRP-1 study eye group, and 2 study eyes group, respectively, had non-ocular SAEs (Table 5-6). 
Due to the more frequent visits in the ranibizumab group compared with the PRP group, there may 
have been a bias toward a higher frequency of reporting in the ranibizumab versus the PRP group. In 
the ranibizumab-1 study eye group, the most common non-ocular SAE was chest pain (6 patients, 5.9 
%), followed by asthenia, cardiac failure congestive, and dyspnea (4 patients each, 3.9 %). In the 
PRP-1 study eye group, the most common SAE was dyspnea (4 patients, 3.5 %) (all other SAEs 
occurred in 2 or fewer patients), and in the 2 study eye group, all SAEs occurred in 2 or fewer patients. 
None of the non-ocular SAEs through 1 year were suspected to be related to the study drug and/or 
intravitreal injection by the investigator. 
Up to 2 years, 42 (41.2 %), 33 (28.9 %) and 38 (42.7 %) patients in the ranibizumab-1 study eye 
group, PRP-1 study eye, and 2 study eyes group, respectively, had non-ocular SAEs. The most 
common non-ocular SAEs (>5 %) in the ranibizumab-1 study eye group were chest pain (8 patients, 
7.8 %) and cardiac failure congestive (6 patients, 5.9 %) followed by acute kidney injury, dyspnea, 
and renal failure (5 patients each, 4.9 %). In the PRP-1 study eye group, the most common non-ocular 
SAE was dyspnea (5 patients, 4.4 %) (all other SAEs occurred in fewer than 5 patients), and in the 2 
study eye group, the most common non-ocular SAE was pneumonia (4 patients, 4.5 %) (all other SAEs 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/499486/2019

occurred in fewer than 4 patients). None of the non-ocular SAEs through 2 years were suspected to be 
related to the study drug and/or intravitreal injection by the investigator. 
Novartis studies (D2301, D2303, D2305) 
In the target DR population, 20 patients (9.8 %) in the ranibizumab 0.5 mg group and 22 patients 
(16.7 %) in the laser group had non-ocular SAEs. All SAEs in the ranibizumab 0.5 mg group occurred 
in 1 patient only; in the laser group, cerebral infarction occurred in 2 patients (1.5 %). In the 
ranibizumab 0.5 mg group, the SAE of myocardial infarction (1 patient) was suspected by the 
investigator to be related to study drug and/or intravitreal injection. In the laser group, the SAEs of 
angina pectoris (1 patient), epulis (1 patient), and urinary tract infection (1 patient) were suspected by 
the investigator to be related to study drug and/or intravitreal injection. 
The SAE frequency in the treatment arm appears to be higher in Protocol S, especially in year 2 
compared with the comparator arm, and the opposite was observed in the Novartis studies. None of 
the SAEs observed in the treatment arm of Protocol S were evaluated as treatment related by the 
study investigators. The MAH was requested to discuss the observed imbalances seen in the Protocol S 
cohort in relation to baseline co-morbidities presented in treatment and control arm, taking into 
consideration the requested sub-analyses based on monotherapies.  
The response concerning the imbalance is discussed above. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Ocular adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation 
Protocol S 
Up to 2 years, there were no ocular AEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation. 
Novartis studies (D2301, D2303, D2305) 
In the target DR population, there was 1 ocular AE that led to permanent treatment discontinuation in 
the ranibizumab 0.5 mg group: vitreous hemorrhage (1 patient, 0.5 %). In the laser group, events of 
retinal hemorrhage (2 patients, 1.5 %), macular fibrosis (1 patient, 0.8 %), and vitreous hemorrhage 
(1 patient, 0.8 %) led to permanent treatment discontinuation. 
Non-ocular adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation 
Protocol S 
The incidence of non-ocular AEs that led to permanent discontinuation of study treatment was low in 
all treatment groups. Up to 1 year, 3 patients (2.9 %) in the ranibizumab-1 study eye group and 1 
patient each in the PRP-1 study eye group and the 2 study eyes group had non-ocular AEs that led to 
permanent discontinuation. All these events were serious. 
In the second year of the study, non-ocular AEs that led to permanent treatment discontinuation were 
reported in 3 patients (2.9 %) in the ranibizumab-1 study eye group, 1 patient (0.9 %) in the PRP-1 
study eye group, and 3 patients (3.4 %) in the 2 study eyes group. 
In total, within 2 years, the most common non-ocular AEs that led to permanent treatment 
discontinuation was death in all 3 groups (2 patients in each group). 
Novartis studies (D2301, D2303, D2305) 
There were few non-ocular AEs in the target DR population that led to treatment discontinuation. In 
the ranibizumab 0.5 mg group, 3 patients (1.5 %) had the following non-ocular AEs leading to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/499486/2019  
Page 50/60 
 
 
 
permanent treatment discontinuation: myocardial infarction (1 patient), metabolic disorder (1 patient), 
and bile duct cancer (1 patient). In the laser group, 5 patients (3.8 %) had the following non-ocular 
AEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation: angina pectoris (1 patient), intestinal obstruction 
(1 patient), hepatitis B (1 patient), colon cancer (1 patient), and cerebral infarction (1 patient). 
Laboratory findings 
There were no planned laboratory outcome measures in Protocol S. HbA1c was collected at baseline, 
but no further analysis was performed. 
In the Novartis studies, hematology, HbA1c, serum biochemistry, and urinalysis assessments for the 
total populations were performed; no clinically relevant differences between treatment arms were 
observed. 
Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (Novartis studies) 
In the Novartis studies, glycosylated HbA1c was assessed at baseline and at Months 3, 6, 9 and 12. In 
the target DR population, for the duration of the studies, glycemic control was stable, as demonstrated 
by a similar and consistent mean HbA1c at each study visit across the groups as well as a nominal 
change from baseline in HbA1c level. 
Long-term safety data 
Protocol S (Gross et al. 2018) 
Five-year safety data for Protocol S were recently reported by Gross et al (2018). The 5-year visit was 
completed by 184 of 277 participants (66.4 %). In the ranibizumab and PRP groups, the mean (SD) 
numbers of ranibizumab injections were 19.2 (10.9) and 5.4 (7.9), respectively. Overall, safety results 
were consistent with those reported for 1 and 2 years. No notable differences between ranibizumab 
and PRP treatment groups were observed for major systemic AEs. No new safety concerns were 
identified. 
Safety in special populations 
Study subgroups 
Intrinsic factors 
Protocol S 
In Protocol S, ocular and non-ocular AEs were analysed by baseline DME status and by subgroups on 
the basis of age (<65, ≥65 years), race (White, Black or African-American, or Other), and sex (Male, 
Female). 
The proportion and the types of common ocular AEs observed in DR patients without baseline DME 
were generally similar to those observed in DR patients with DME at baseline [SCS-Section 5.1.1]. The 
ability to make a direct comparison of ocular AEs between the 2 groups was limited due to smaller 
number of eyes/patients in the DR groups with baseline DME. 
As a result of the small sample size and low event numbers in the ≥65 year subgroup, the 
interpretation of age subgroup data is limited for ocular and non-ocular AEs. Similarly, because the 
majority of the patients were White, the interpretation of data by racial subgroup is limited for ocular 
and non-ocular AE. No notable differences in the incidence of ocular and non-ocular AEs were observed 
between sex subgroups up to 2 years, but interpretation of data is limited due to the small sample size 
and low event numbers in each subgroup. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/499486/2019  
Page 51/60 
 
 
 
Novartis studies (D2301, D2303, D2305) 
In the target DR population, subgroup analysis of ocular and non-ocular AEs was performed for age 
(<65, ≥65 years), sex, and race (Caucasian, Asian, other). As a result of the small sample size and 
low event numbers in some of the subgroups, the interpretation of this data is limited. Overall, no 
clinically relevant differences were observed in these subgroups. 
Extrinsic factors 
Due to the low systemic concentration following the intravitreal injection of ranibizumab, no 
interactions are anticipated with use of concomitant drugs, tobacco, alcohol, or food intake. 
The observed results in patients with previous retinal laser photocoagulation or with laser 
photocoagulation administered adjunctively during the study did not reveal relevant interaction with 
the intravitreal ranibizumab administration. 
Adverse drug reactions 
The safety profile of ranibizumab in diabetic patients is well-established for the treatment of visual 
impairment due to DME and is consistent with the general safety profile of ranibizumab in other 
approved indications. 
Ocular and non-ocular events in ranibizumab-treated patients with moderately severe to severe NPDR 
or PDR, observed for up to 2 years in Protocol S and up to 1 year the pooled Novartis studies, were 
consistent with what would be expected in a diabetic patient population with DR, or have been 
described with similar frequency and severity in previous clinical trials with ranibizumab. 
Ocular AEs 
Ocular AEs that occurred in >2 % of patients in the ranibizumab group over control (PRP or laser) in 
Protocol S (through 2 years) or the target DR population of the pooled Novartis studies (through 1 
year) included conjunctival hemorrhage, eye irritation, cataract subcapsular, photophobia, vitreous 
floaters, and intraocular pressure increased. These events are listed as ADRs for ranibizumab and were 
observed in the labelled frequency categories or below for patients with moderately severe NPDR or 
worse. Retinal exudates were reported at higher frequency in ranibizumab-treated eyes as compared 
with PRP (4.2 % vs. 0.5 %) only for Protocol S, while a single event of retinal exudates was reported 
for a laser-treated patient in the pooled Novartis studies. Exudates are a well-described retinal 
abnormality in patients with DR and not considered an adverse reaction due to treatment with 
ranibizumab. 
Non-ocular AEs 
The types of non-ocular AEs observed in Protocol S and the pooled Novartis studies were 
representative of those seen in a diabetic patient population with DR or have been described in 
previous studies using ranibizumab in patients with other indications. About half of the PRP treatment 
group in Protocol S also received ranibizumab in the study eye for the treatment of DME, with an 
average of 3.4 ranibizumab injections for up to 2 years [Protocol S - Section 7.1]. Therefore, there was 
no control group without ranibizumab exposure in Protocol S. In consequence and considering the 
large safety database for diabetic patients from previous clinical trials with ranibizumab (Zarbin et al 
2017), numerical imbalances across treatment groups observed only in Protocol S have not been 
accounted for in the definition of non-ocular ADRs. 
In the pooled Novartis studies, non-ocular AEs that occurred in >2 % patients of the ranibizumab 
group over laser control included diabetic nephropathy (5.4 % vs. 0.8 %), cough (4.9 % vs. 0.8 %), 
and anemia (3.4 % vs. 0 %). Cough and anemia are listed as ADRs for ranibizumab and are in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/499486/2019  
Page 52/60 
 
 
 
labelled frequency categories for the DR target population. Overall, 10 out of the 11 patients with an 
event of diabetic nephropathy in the ranibizumab group had abnormal urinalysis results at screening, 
indicating pre-existing renal conditions. 
In Protocol S, events associated with renal dysfunction were balanced across treatment groups 
(including events of nephropathy, renal failure, renal disorder, renal impairment, and proteinuria), 
though acute kidney injury was reported at higher frequency in the ranibizumab 1-study eye group 
and 2 study eye group as compared with the PRP 1-study eye group (4.9 % and 5.6 % vs. 1.8 %). 
The underlying diabetes in patients with DME is a risk factor for nephropathy, and the systemic 
exposure of ranibizumab is very low (Avery et al. 2017). Previous evaluations of renal failure, 
proteinuria, and thrombotic microangiopathy have not shown evidence of a relationship between 
ranibizumab and renal toxicity, and the safety profile of ranibizumab in diabetic patients is well 
established for a large patient population [PSUR 01-Jul-2013 to 30-Jun-2014]. A pooled analysis of 6 
randomised, controlled clinical trials from Genentech and Novartis comparing ranibizumab 0.5 mg 
versus sham injection and laser in diabetic patients with DME showed similar rates for renal failure and 
proteinuria events. Compared with this database of diabetic patients treated with ranibizumab, 
imbalances in nephropathy cases between treatment groups observed in this study does not constitute 
a new safety signal (Zarbin et al. 2017). 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Overall, safety data from Protocol S and the pooled studies indicate that the safety profile of 
ranibizumab in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is consistent with the well-
established safety profile of ranibizumab in approved indications, including DME. No new or unexpected 
safety signals were identified. The types of AEs observed were representative of those seen in a 
diabetic patient population with DR or have been described in previous ranibizumab studies in patients 
with other indications. 
Overall, comparable AE frequencies were seen in both study arms, but conjunctival hemorrhage was 
more frequent in the ranibizumab group, and vitreous hemorrhage was observed more often in laser 
group. Both observations could be expected and do not raise safety concerns. 
There were few ocular SAEs in the study eye across the four studies and only one ocular AE in the 
ranibizumab group led to permanent study discontinuation (vitreous hemorrhage). 
Common non-ocular AEs observed in the ranibizumab groups were few and typical of a diabetic patient 
population with DR, occurred in similar frequency and without concentration on a specific event type. 
A greater proportion of patients in the ranibizumab group developed diabetic nephropathy. The 
majority of these subjects had abnormal urine protein result or elevated serum creatinine levels 
already at screening, thus the finding is not considered a safety concern. 
Previous evaluations of renal failure, proteinuria, and thrombotic microangiopathy have not shown 
evidence of a relationship between ranibizumab and renal toxicity, and the safety profile of 
ranibizumab in diabetic patients is well established for a large patient population. 
Long-term safety data (2, and up to 5 years) from Protocol S were consistent with the 1-year safety 
data. 
Part of the patients in both groups also received the other treatment (Table 15), and additional safety 
analyses were performed of the ranibizumab only subgroup and PRP only subgroup. Ocular AEs were 
generally similar in reporting frequencies in both the ranibizumab only and the PRP only groups 
(78.1% vs 72.0% eyes with at least one ocular AE) whereas non-ocular AEs was slightly higher in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/499486/2019  
Page 53/60 
 
 
 
patients that received ranibizumab only compared to those treated exclusively with PRP (90.7% versus 
77.6%). However, it is agreed with MAH that the more frequent injections, and more frequent visits 
following ranibizumab treatment may have contributed to the higher proportion of non-ocular adverse 
events in the ranibizumab group compared to the PRP only group. 
It is noted that the MAH had chosen different cut-off levels from 2 to 3 to 5 % for reported adverse 
events. 
The SAE frequency in the treatment arm appears to be higher in Protocol S, especially in year 2 
compared with the comparator arm, and the opposite was observed in the Novartis studies and this 
has been sufficiently discussed by the MAH in the 1st round.   
None of the SAEs discussed were suspected by the Investigator to be causally related to treatment 
with ranibizumab and the baseline medical history at diagnoses did not reveal any critical imbalances 
across SOCs for both treatment groups. Consistent with the diabetic study population, the most 
frequently reported medical history SOCs were cardiac, vascular, and renal disorders. As diabetes is a 
known risk factor for cardiovascular and renal complications, events reflecting such complications are 
expected for this patient population and overall do not reveal a new safety concern for IVT treatment 
with ranibizumab in diabetic patients with DR. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of ranibizumab in diabetic patients is well-established for the treatment of visual 
impairment due to DME. The safety profile is consistent with the general safety profile of ranibizumab 
in other approved indications. Endophthalmitis is an identified risk, which rises with repeated 
injections. 
No new or unexpected safety signals were identified in ranibizumab-treated patients with moderately 
severe to severe NPDR or PDR, observed for or up to 24 months in Protocol S and for up to 12 months 
the pooled studies. The types of ocular and non-ocular adverse events (AEs) observed in the study 
populations were typical for this patient population. The safety data indicate that ranibizumab 
administered up to 2–5 years in this population is safe and well-tolerated. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c (7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
3.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version with this application. The proposed RMP change for the 
RMP version 19.0 compared with RMP version 17.2 is the addition of safety data from the Protocol S 
study and the diabetic retinopathy population of Novartis-sponsored clinical studies RESTORE, REVEAL 
and REFINE to support the new indication. 
The safety profile of ranibizumab in diabetic patients is well-established for the treatment of visual 
impairment due to DME and consistent with the general safety profile of ranibizumab in other approved 
indications. 
No new or unexpected safety signals were identified in ranibizumab-treated patients with moderately 
severe to severe NPDR or PDR, observed for or up to 24 months in Protocol S and for up to 12 months 
the pooled Novartis studies. 
Assessment report

There is no change in the safety concerns compared with version 17.2 of the RMP. Identified risks 
associated with intravitreal injection including infectious endophthalmitis, intraocular inflammation, 
retinal detachment and retinal tear, and intraocular pressure increase are also relevant for patients 
with moderately severe to severe NPDR and PDR. 
The list below shows the major modifications/changes for Safety RMP version 19.0 (v19.0) from RMP 
version 17.2.

Other RMP versions under evaluation 
At the time of the initial submission, there were two versions for ongoing Lucentis procedures II-74-G 
(version 18.2) and II-76 (version 19.1). During the 2nd RSI, the RMP version 18.2 was approved (July 25, 
2019) within the procedure EMEA/H/C/000715/II/0074/G (indication prematurity retinopathy).  
Subsequently, RMP version 18.2 is used as basis for the updated RMP to be submitted in response to 
2nd RSI of procedure II-76 (including the changed indication). The version of the response is thus 
numbered 20.0.

Details of the currently approved RMP: 
Version number: Version 18.2 
Approved with procedure: EMEA/H/C/000715/II/0074/G  
Date of approval (opinion date): 25 July 2019 
4.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this variation, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, and 5.1 of the SmPC are proposed to be updated 
to reflect the new indication and submitted data. The Package Leaflet (PL) is then updated accordingly. 
A positive Opinion (PO) for the ongoing parallel procedure EMEA/H/C/000715/II/0074/G (related to the 
addition of pediatric indication in Retinopathy of Prematurity) was received on 25th July 2019. Thus, the 
MAH used the final English PI for procedure II-74-G as basis for the updated PI in response to the 2nd RSI 
for procedure II-76. 
Additionally, the MAH took the opportunity of the response to the 2nd RSI for procedure II-76 to perform 
some editorial changes in the Package Leaflet. Those are administrative changes related to the update in 
the list of representatives of the MAH and do not require any linguistic review. 
4.1.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the Package 
Leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable, because the change 
introduced in the leaflet is minimal and has no impact on the legibility of the leaflet. 
5.  Benefit–Risk Balance 
5.1.  Therapeutic context 
5.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a microangiopathy that leads to hypoxia-triggered up-regulation of pro-
angiogenic, proinflammatory, and vascular permeability factors, including vascular endothelial grow 
factor (VEGF), and to the development of subsequent vessel leakage, subclinical inflammation, and 
neovascularisation in the retina. It occurs as a complication of both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes 
mellitus and is strongly associated with other microvascular complications of diabetes. 
Despite best efforts to optimally control blood glucose, if DR is left untreated, it continues to worsen, 
with increasing risk of vision-threatening complications, including diabetic macular edema (DME), 
macular ischemia, and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). 
Diabetic retinopathy is classified as either non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) or PDR, based 
on the absence or presence of abnormal new vessels, respectively. NPDR is the earliest stage of DR 
and often occurs unnoticed by patients, without significant vision loss. Optimal diabetes control, 
together with monitoring, is known to prevent progression of diabetic retinopathy, and this is the 
Assessment report

Page 56/60 
 
 
 
 
current mainstay of treatment. On the other hand, sufficient metabolic control is not always possible to 
achieve and some subjects progress even if well controlled.  
Worsening of NPDR to PDR is characterised by neovascularisation and regarded as a serious, clinically 
important progression of the pathology, as well as marking the transition of the disease to an 
advanced stage. PDR is also associated with a high risk of visual morbidity arising from vitreous 
hemorrhage, traction retinal detachment, and neovascular glaucoma (Aiello et al 1998, Wykoff et al 
2018). Patients can also develop DME at any stage during the progression of DR. 
Vascular endothelial growth factor is implicated in all aspects of vascular pathology in DR shown in 
both animal models and in NPDR and PDR patients compared with control healthy subjects. Vitreous 
VEGF levels in DR patients have been shown to correlate with the severity of DR. 
5.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The standard-of-care for PDR is panretinal photocoagulation (PRP). Focal or grid laser may also be 
used when clinically significant DME is present. Vitreous surgery may be considered in patients with 
high-risk PDR. 
There remains an unmet medical need for additional treatment options for DR. 
5.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The pivotal study was Protocol S which compared the efficacy of ranibizumab 0.5 mg with PRP in 
diabetic patients with PDR. It was a JCHR (DRCR.net) -sponsored Phase 3, multi-center, randomised, 
active-controlled, parallel-assignment, non-inferiority study for which the primary efficacy analysis was 
at 2 years, with follow-up up to 5 years. Protocol S enrolled 305 patients (394 study eyes) with PDR, 
with or without concomitant DME at baseline. Patients had Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes with PDR and 
had not yet received PRP in at least one eye. One or two eligible study eyes could be enrolled. 
In addition, the MAH has submitted results from pooled data from three Novartis sponsored studies 
(D2301, D2303, and D2305). The three studies were randomised, double-masked, active-controlled, 
Phase 3 studies in patients with visual impairment due to DME. The studies compared ranibizumab 0.5 
mg intravitreal injections (plus sham laser), ranibizumab 0.5 mg intravitreal injections with active laser 
(D2301 and D2303 only), and laser treatment plus sham injections. 
As supportive data, the RIDE and RISE studies are also referred to. They were 3-year studies in 
patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes with DME comparing the efficacy and safety of ranibizumab 
with sham. The studies were identically designed, randomised, Phase 3, double-masked, multicenter 
sham injection-controlled studies. After the main analyses of data at 2 years, sham-arm patients were 
allowed to crossover to the ranibizumab 0.5 mg arm, but the masked treatment period continued to 
Year 3, after which, additional analyses were performed. 
5.2.  Favourable effects 
In Protocol S, the main outcome was the mean visual acuity letter score improvement from baseline at 
2 years, which was 2.7 letters in the ranibizumab group and -0.7 letters in the PRP group. The 
adjusted least squares mean treatment group difference was 3.5 letters (95 % CI: 0.2, 6.7 letters). 
The pre-specified non-inferiority margin for the primary endpoint was 5 letters. Non-inferiority was 
thus reached. After 5 years the difference had waned, and both treatment groups showed an 
improvement of ca. 3 letters in visual acuity. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/499486/2019  
Page 57/60 
 
 
 
In the overall population in Protocol S, in the ranibizumab group, 41.8 % and 42.3 % of eyes 
experienced a ≥2-step improvement in DRSS from baseline at the 1-year and 2-year visits, 
respectively; the corresponding proportions of eyes in the PRP group were 14.6 % and 23.1 %, 
respectively. Comparable results were observed by baseline DME status. 
In the pooled target DR population of the Novartis studies in patients with DME, 48.4 % of patients in 
the ranibizumab group had a 2-step improvement in DRSS from baseline at 1 year, compared with 
14.6 % of patients in the laser group. 
Greater proportions of patients in the ranibizumab treatment groups had ≥3-step improvement in 
DRSS compared with PRP or laser treatment: 28.6 % vs. 3.0 % in Protocol S at 1 year, 29.1 % vs. 3.5 
% in Protocol S at 2 years. 
In the pooled DME studies, a larger proportion of patients in the ranibizumab 0.5 mg group had a ≥2-
step improvement in DRSS from baseline at 1 year than in the laser group (48.4 % vs 14.6 %, 
respectively).  
5.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
At 5 years follow-up, the advantage of ranibizumab had waned, the treatments proved to be 
comparable regarding visual acuity, absence of PDR and neovascularisation. However, the relevance of 
this finding is difficult to assess, given the fact that both the treatment and comparator arms included 
a substantial number of patients who received both treatments (as many as 54.2 % of subjects in the 
comparator group received also ranibizumab) as well as the relatively high loss to follow-up. 
5.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall, safety data from Protocol S and the pooled studies indicate that the safety profile of 
ranibizumab in patients with PDR is consistent with the well-established safety profile of ranibizumab in 
approved indications, including DME. No new or unexpected safety signals were identified. The types of 
AEs observed were representative of those seen in a diabetic patient population with DR or have been 
described in previous ranibizumab studies in patients with other indications. 
Comparable AE frequencies were seen in both study arms, but conjunctival hemorrhage was more 
frequent in the ranibizumab group, and vitreous hemorrhage more often in the laser group. Both 
observations could be expected and do not raise new safety concerns. 
Long-term safety data (2, and up to 5 years) from Protocol S were consistent with the 1-year safety 
data. 
5.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
For ranibizumab, the frequency of SAEs in Protocol S was almost twice as high as in the pooled data, 
36 vs 20 SAEs. However, the majority of patients had pre-existing medical conditions that could 
explain the reported events.

5.7.  Benefit–risk assessment and discussion 
5.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The current variation aims for an indication to use ranibizumab for the treatment of moderately 
severe/severe PDR. From a pharmacological point of view, the hypothesis of a beneficial effect may be 
considered plausible. The submitted clinical study and analysis of pooled data from studies in patients 
with DME, point to non-inferior efficacy compared with PRP/laser with respect to VA and a higher 
efficacy as evaluated by change in DRSS. The majority of analysed endpoints showed better clinical 
results for ranibizumab at 1 or 2 years, although the proportion of eyes with neovascular glaucoma,

neovascularisation of the iris, or vitreous hemorrhage was comparable between the ranibizumab and 
PRP groups. At 5 years the treatments proved to be comparable regarding visual acuity, absence of 
PDR and neovascularisation. 
The safety profile of ranibizumab in patients with diabetes is well-established and no new safety 
concerns were identified. 
5.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The data support a positive benefit-risk balance of Lucentis in patients with PDR. 
5.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit–risk balance of Lucentis remains positive and extension of indication to PDR in 
adults is supported.

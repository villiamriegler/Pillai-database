1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Gilead Sciences Ireland UC submitted on 5 June 2020 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Veklury, through the centralised procedure falling 
within the Article 3(1) and point 3 of Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the 
centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 26 March 2020. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) in adults and adolescents (aged 12 years and older with 
body weight at least 40 kg): 
• 
• 
with pneumonia who may or may not be receiving supplemental oxygen or ventilatory support, or 
who are receiving supplemental oxygen or ventilatory support.  
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application.  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical and 
clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain tests or studies. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0201/2020 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0201/2020 is not yet completed as some measures 
were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related 
to the proposed indication. 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
The applicant requested consideration of its application for a Conditional marketing authorisation in 
accordance with Article 14-a of the above-mentioned Regulation, as it is intended for the treatment of a 
life-threatening disease. In addition, the above-mentioned medicinal product is intended for use in an 
emergency situation, in response to public health threats duly recognised by the World Health Organisation 
and by the Union.  
In particular, the applicant stated that the submission was in response to the current global pandemic of 
Assessment report

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 
(CoV)-2 infection. In December 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown cause emerged in Wuhan, 
Hubei province, China {Huang 2020}. Sequencing analyses from respiratory tract samples of patients 
identified a novel CoV, which was named SARS-CoV-2 {Zhou 2020b}. Cases of the novel infectious disease 
caused by the SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, rapidly increased throughout the world. As of 18 May 2020, more 
than 4,618,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 311,000 associated deaths were reported worldwide, 
including more than 1,890,000 cases and 167,000 deaths in the European region {World Health 
Organization (WHO) 2020a}. 
Furthermore, it was claimed that remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug that has been evaluated for the 
treatment of COVID-19. Remdesivir falls within the scope of the CMA, as set out in Article 2 of the 
Regulation, because COVID-19 is a life-threatening disease and the World Health Organization (WHO) has 
declared the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern and has also 
declared COVID-19 a pandemic {World Health Organization (WHO) 2020b} {World Health Organization 
(WHO) 2020c}. 
Therefore, the applicant concluded that remdesivir satisfies the requirements for a CMA, as described in 
Article 4(1)(a) – (d) of the Regulation, through the fulfilment of an unmet medical need and the life-
threatening nature of COVID-19, the ability of the applicant to be in a position to provide comprehensive 
clinical data, a positive risk-benefit balance, and the fact that the benefit to public health upon immediate 
availability of remdesivir outweighs the risks inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance remdesivir contained in the above medicinal product to be 
considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a medicinal 
product previously authorised within the European Union. 
Scientific advice 
The applicant did not seek Scientific advice from the CHMP.

experts did not participate in the Committee’s discussions on this application, including those leading to the 
scientific opinion adopted by the CHMP. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
A novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first identified in 
December of 2019 in Wuhan, China as causing a respiratory illness designated as coronavirus disease 2019, 
or COVID-19. On 30 January 2020, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the WHO 
declared the COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern {World Health 
Organization (WHO) 2020, https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/27-04-2020-who-timeline---covid-19}. 
Since then, there has been rapid spread of the virus, leading to a global pandemic of COVID-19.  
On 2 April 2020, the EMA issued a Compassionate Use (CU) opinion on the use of remdesivir (updated on 11 
May 2020) for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients from 12 year of age weighing at least 40 kg 
requiring hospitalization  and supplemental oxygen (non-invasive ventilation, high-flow oxygen devices, 
invasive mechanical ventilation, or ECMO); due to severe COVID-19 confirmed by polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR) or  who have known contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19, with PCR pending.  
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020 
Page 9/199 
 
 
  
 
 
On 1 May 2020, the US FDA issued an emergency use authorization for remdesivir, allowing the distribution 
and use of remdesivir for the treatment of adults and children with severe COVID-19 disease defined as 
SpO2 ≤ 94% on room air, or requiring supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal 
membrane oxygenation (ECMO).  
The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare also granted an emergency regulatory approval for 
Remdesivir. National emergency authorisations for distribution of remdesivir were issued also in UK and 
other countries.  
According to current evidence, the COVID-19 virus is primarily transmitted between people through 
respiratory droplets and contact routes. Human-to-human transmission is occurring extensively. Hence, 
precautions to prevent human-to-human transmission are appropriate for both suspected and confirmed 
cases.  
Although most coronavirus infections cause only mild respiratory symptoms, infection with SARS-CoV, 
MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 can be lethal. 
Currently numerous uncertainties remain in the understanding of the spread of COVID-19 and its 
management. At the moment, there are no approved treatments specific for COVID-19. Evaluation and 
management of the disease is guided by the severity of the illness.   
Well-conducted randomized trials are critical in delineating how COVID-19 should be treated. Different trials 
from different sponsors are in progress to assess the effects of various medications as treatment or 
prevention including those such as chloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, etc. Furthermore, 
several studies are under way to develop an effective vaccine.  
In addition, because of concerns that a hyperinflammatory state may drive many of the severe 
manifestations of COVID-19, several immunomodulating therapies such as glucocorticoids, convalescent 
plasma, and anti-cytokine therapies, are also under investigation in patients with severe disease. Some 
drugs, like dexamethasone, have shown promising preliminary results. However, data to inform treatment 
remain limited and, currently, there are no medicinal products approved in the European Union (EU) with an 
indication for the treatment of COVID-191. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
On 30 January 2020, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the WHO declared the 
COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern {World Health Organization (WHO,     
https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/27-04-2020-who-timeline---covid-19) 2020c}.  
On 12 January 2020 it was announced that a novel coronavirus had been identified in samples obtained from 
cases and that initial analysis of virus genetic sequences suggested that this was the cause of the outbreak. 
This virus is referred to as SARS-CoV-2, and the associated disease as COVID-19. 
Further to the WHO declaration, on 31 January 2020, Health and Human Services declared a public health 
emergency in the United States (US) {U. S. Department of Health & Human Services (DHHS) 2020}.  
On 11 February, WHO named the syndrome caused by this novel coronavirus COVID-19 (Coronavirus 
Disease 2019) using its best practice guidance. 
Through June 20, 2020, there have been more than 8 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide and 
more than 450.000 deaths.  
1 Poland has authorised a chloroquine product (Arechin) with the therapeutic indication that includes supportive treatment of 
SARS-Cov-2 infection. However, there is no scientific evidence on the efficacy of this chloroquine that would be comparable to the 
extent of evidence on remdesivir, as discussed in this report.

2.1.3.  Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
Coronaviruses are a group of highly diverse, enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that 
belong to two subfamilies, Coronavirinae and Torovirinae, in the family of Coronaviridae. These viruses were 
first discovered in the 1960s and can be further classified into four main genera: Alphacoronavirus, 
Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus, on the basis of their phylogenetic relationships 
and genomic structures.  
Currently, there are seven strains of coronaviruses that are known to infect humans, including the recently 
identified SARS-CoV-2, human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), OC43 (HCoV-OC43), NL63 (HCoV-NL63), 
HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). 
The virus causes respiratory illness in people and can spread from person to person {Center for Disease 
Control (CDC) 2020, Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2020}.  While most people infected 
with SARS-CoV-2 have mild upper respiratory tract disease, older individuals and adults with comorbidities 
are more likely to have severe progressive pneumonia and multiorgan failure. 
Accumulating evidence has suggested that inflammatory responses play a critical role in the progression of 
COVID-19, and several markers have some tracing and detecting accuracy for disease severity (Mehta et al., 
2020, Stebbing et al., 2020, Wu C. et al., 2020). Immune-mediated lung injury and acute respiratory 
distress syndrome (ARDS) are associated with adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
Common signs of infection include fever, cough, shortness of breath, breathing difficulties, and other 
respiratory symptoms. In severe cases, SARS-CoV-2 can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory 
syndrome, kidney failure, and death {World Health Organization (WHO) 2020a}. Therefore, while most 
people with COVID-19 develop only mild or moderate disease, approximately 15% develop severe disease 
that requires oxygen support, and 5% have critical disease with complications such as respiratory failure, 
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, thromboembolism, and/or multiorgan 
failure, including acute kidney injury and cardiac injury. 
Older age, and underlying noncommunicable diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiac disease, 
chronic lung disease and cancer, have been reported as risk factors for severe disease and death. 
COVID-19 has been also associated with mental and neurological manifestations, including delirium or 
encephalopathy, agitation, stroke, meningoencephalitis, impaired sense of smell or taste, etc. 
There are few data on the clinical presentation of COVID-19 in specific populations, such as children and 
pregnant women. Although data are limited and mainly related to multiple small series and case reports, 
they generally suggest that pregnancy and childbirth do not increase the risk for acquiring SARS-CoV-2 
infection and the clinical course of COVID-19 seems not be worse compared with nonpregnant women of the 
same age. 
Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are generally milder in children compared with adults. However, most 
recently, an acute presentation with a hyperinflammatory syndrome leading to multiorgan failure and shock 
has been described named as multisystem inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19 in 
children and adolescents.  
The diagnosis of COVID-19 can be established on the basis of a suggestive clinical history and the detection 
of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory secretions. Nucleic acid tests that detect the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome 
are now widely employed to diagnose coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In addition, serological assays 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020 
Page 11/199 
 
 
  
 
measure antibody responses and determine seroconversion although they are not well suited to detect acute 
infections. 
There are currently no approved effective antivirals or vaccines available for the treatment and prevention of 
COVID-19. The availability of an effective therapeutic agent with a favourable benefit/risk profile would 
address a serious unmet medical need for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. 
2.1.5.  Management 
About the product 
Remdesivir (“RDV”, “GS-5734™”) is a novel antiviral drug that has been evaluated for the treatment of 
COVID-19. Remdesivir is a nucleotide prodrug that is intracellularly metabolized into an analog of adenosine 
triphosphate that inhibits viral RNA polymerases and has broad-spectrum activity against members of the 
CoVs (eg, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]-CoV), filoviruses (eg, Ebola 
virus, Marburg virus), and paramyxoviruses(e.g, respiratory syncytial virus, Nipah virus, Hendra virus). 
In January 2020, Gilead received a request for compassionate use of RDV to treat a 35-year-old male who 
had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT)-polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR) and whose clinical status was worsening {Holshue 2020}. Remdesivir was made available in a number 
of countries for single-patient compassionate use of RDV for treatment of COVID-19.  
There are several ongoing or planned studies on the clinical efficacy and safety of remdesivir for the 
treatment of COVID-19. 
The sought indication claimed by the applicant for remdesivir was: 
”The treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) in adults and adolescents (aged 12 years and older 
with body weight at least 40 kg): 
• 
• 
with pneumonia who may or may not be receiving supplemental oxygen or ventilatory support, or 
who are receiving supplemental oxygen or ventilatory support. “ 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The applicant requested consideration of its application for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation in 
accordance with Article 14-a of the above-mentioned Regulation, based on the following criteria: 
•  The benefit-risk balance is positive: 
According to the Applicant, a positive benefit-risk balance for remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 is 
demonstrated primarily based on evidence from the NIAID-sponsored study CO-US-540-5776 (ACTT1), 
an ongoing, Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study evaluating RDV 
versus placebo in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Supportive safety data are provided from four 
completed Phase 1 studies, two supportive ongoing Phase III studies (GS-US-540-5773, and GS-US-540-
5774), and the compassionate use program. 
The Applicant states that the available data to date indicate a positive benefit-risk balance for remdesivir 
use in the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 for which there are no approved therapeutic 
agents in the EU. 
•  It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data:

•  Unmet medical needs will be addressed:  
In the European Union (EU) there are no approved treatments for COVID-19. Treatment of severely ill 
patients with COVID-19 is primarily supportive. The COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed health care 
systems in several affected countries. According to the Applicant there is now substantial evidence that 
remdesivir will address this unmet medical need because this drug significantly shortens time to recovery, 
particularly in patients with severe COVID-19, and may improve COVID-19−related mortality. In addition, 
remdesivir has demonstrated a favourable safety profile, supporting its use in patients with COVID-19.

•  The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that 
additional data are still required: 
The Applicant considers that the overall benefit-risk balance of remdesivir in the proposed indication is 
positive and that with the current data, the benefits to public health of the immediate availability of this 
product outweigh the risks. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented in two pharmaceutical forms, as a powder for concentrate for solution for 
infusion, containing 100 mg remdesivir as active substance, or as concentrate for solution for infusion 
containing 100 mg remdesivir as active substance.  
Other ingredients in the powder for concentrate for solution for infusion are betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium, 
hydrochloric acid (to adjust pH) and, sodium hydroxide (to adjust pH). 
Other ingredients in the concentrate for solution for infusion are betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium, 
hydrochloric acid (to adjust pH), sodium hydroxide (to adjust pH) and water for injections.  
For both pharmaceutical forms, the product is available in Type I clear glass vial, an elastomeric closure, and 
an aluminium overseal with a flip-off cap. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Remdesivir is a nucleotide prodrug RNA polymerase inhibitor developed for the treatment of emerging 
viruses. The chemical name of remdesivir is 2-Ethylbutyl (2S)-2-{[(S)-{[(2R,3S,4R,5R)-5-(4-
aminopyrrolo[2,1-f] [1,2,4]triazin-7-yl)-5-cyano-3,4-dihydroxytetrahydrofuran-2-yl] methoxy}-
(phenoxy)phosphoryl]amino} propanoate. It corresponds to the molecular formula C27H35N6O8P, its relative 
molecular mass is 602.6 and it has the structure shown in Figure 1. 
Figure 1.Structure of remdesivir. 
Remdesivir is a white to off-white or yellow non-hygroscopic crystalline solid. It is soluble in ethanol and 
freely soluble in methanol. It is practically insoluble in water and its aqueous solubility is pH dependant and 
increases as the pH decreases; in water adjusted with HCl to pH 2 it is very slightly soluble. Its pKa value is 
3.3 and its LogP is 3.2.

The structure of the active substance was elucidated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, 
mass spectrometry (MS), elemental analysis, infrared spectroscopy (IR), and ultraviolet spectroscopy (UV). 
The presented data support the proposed structure of remdesivir, but a clearer presentation of NMR data is 
expected (see recommendations 2.2.6). Solid state properties were confirmed using x-ray powder diffraction 
(XRPD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). 
Remdesivir has six chiral centres and is produced as a single stereoisomer. Of the potential stereoisomeric 
impurities, two can be reasonably expected to be present in the final active substance. The manufacturing 
process for remdesivir and the control strategy for stereoisomeric impurities is described. 
Remdesivir exhibits polymorphism. The manufacturing process produces either Form II or Material 2, which 
consists of a mixture of Form II and Form IV. Form II is the most thermodynamically stable polymorph. 
Important physicochemical properties of the active substance such as equilibrium solubility and stability, and 
the resulting finished product performance, were shown to be equivalent for Form II and Material 2. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Remdesivir manufacturing process includes two synthetic steps comprising of one coupling step and one 
deprotection step. There is one isolated intermediate, the crude remdesivir, which leads through purification 
to the final remdesivir active substance. The manufacturing process has been described. The submitted 
information indicate that currently manufactured batches are of consistent quality that is appropriate and 
comparable to that of clinical development batches. However, a specific obligation (SOB) with a view to 
confirming that the quality of future batches will also remain appropriate and comparable to that of clinical 
development batches over the entire life cycle of the product is warranted in this respect. In order to ensure 
batch to batch consistency the applicant should expand the description of the active substance synthesis 
with more details regarding yields, process conditions, unambiguously specifying when each process stage is 
applicable, materials used and their specifications, and defining the batch size. Further, process parameter 
ranges should be further justified or tightened. Specifically, the process description should unambiguously 
reflect the production of the process validation batches and the manufacturing of future batches by clarifying 
when so called “optional” process steps are applied. In addition, the re-working procedures should be 
deleted, process conditions should be described in more detail and the applied process parameter ranges 
should be further justified or tightened.  
Control of materials 
The proposed starting materials are clearly stated, and the respective synthetic routes and specifications 
were presented.  
However, the designation of the proposed starting materials is not fully in line with all the principles of ICH 
Q11. The presented remdesivir synthesis from the proposed starting materials includes one bond-forming 
step and one deprotection step, while only the crude active substance and final active substance are 
isolated. Generally, the number of steps performed under GMP are limited. In addition, several of the 
impurities potentially present in the proposed starting materials could affect the final active substance 
impurity profile.  
In order to improve the impurity control strategy, lower the risk of contamination and assure comprehensive 
control throughout the lifecycle of the product, the MAH should, as agreed, redefine the starting materials of 
active substance synthesis, update all dossier documentation accordingly and implement the redefined 
starting materials. 
The applicant agreed to redefine the starting materials to a point earlier in the synthesis and committed to 
do so within an acceptable timeframe. After re-definition of the starting materials the increased number of 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020 
Page 15/199 
 
 
  
 
 
synthetic steps conducted under GMP would mitigate risks associated with contamination and/or future 
changes to the synthetic route or supplier of the starting material (reference is made to ICH Q11 Q&A 5.11). 
The applicant agrees to submit documentation on the new starting materials in August 2020 as a variation to 
the MA and all affected dossier sections will be updated accordingly. The new (redefined) starting materials 
will be implemented in the GMP manufacturing process by June 2021.  Any proposal to include additional 
starting material manufacturers will have to follow the applicable regulatory requirements including 
submission of the relevant variation(s). Considering the time required to undertake the necessary activities 
for the redefined starting material implementation and the emergency context of the current application, in 
order to ensure the supply of the medicinal product to the patients, it is deemed acceptable that the 
redefinition of the starting material is realised within the above timeframe and followed up as an SOB in the 
context of this CMA of a medicinal product to be used in an emergency situation. 
The synthetic descriptions include information on used solvents and reagents. No class 1 solvents and no 
class 1 catalysts are used. Information on materials used in the manufacture of the active substance (e.g. 
solvents, reagents) was presented.  
Further information on specifications for all solvents, recovered solvents (if applicable), reagents and 
auxiliary materials (e.g. filtration aids) used in the manufacturing process are awaited. It is expected that 
relevant information is moved from dossier section S.2.6 into the respective sections (S.2.3 and S.3). The 
synthetic scheme of the manufacturing process should be updated accordingly (see recommendation 2.2.6).  
Control of critical steps 
Critical process parameters and controls have been identified using a risk-based approach. In-process 
controls were defined. These should be supplemented with all identified critical process parameters and the 
specification for the isolated intermediate should be updated to include a test for assay (see 
recommendation 2.2.6). Process parameters have been investigated with a traditional, univariate approach 
and proven acceptable ranges (PARs) have been established. In the process description, parameters are 
defined by operating ranges. The operating ranges are however much wider than what is expected to be 
needed to operate the process and should be tightened. 
Manufacturing process development 
The manufacturing process development program summarises the differences from the current 
manufacturing process and the manufacturing process used for toxicology batch and clinical batch. The bond 
forming steps and the intermediate in the synthesis of remdesivir have not been changed. However, no 
information has been provided with regards to the manufacture of the starting materials during initial 
development work. Some solvents have been changed.  
Impurities 
Information on structures and the related downstream impurities was given for the specified impurities. The 
impurity discussion covers stereo-isomeric impurities, degradation products, residual solvents and organic 
volatile impurities, potentially mutagenic impurities, inorganic impurities originating from the manufacturing 
process and the synthesis of the (proposed) starting materials. A discussion on the carry-over of the 
specified impurities and downstream impurities was presented. All specified impurities can be detected 
downstream with the impurity method used for active substance control. However, the provided information 
concerning formation and control strategy for some potential impurities is incomplete.  
In order to further substantiate the control strategy for the active substance the MAH should further 
elaborate the impurities discussion with regard to the formation of potential impurities in the proposed and 
redefined starting materials, the representativeness of the active substance used in the toxicological 
programme versus the commercial product, the contamination of the active substance by elemental 
impurities, and the proposed justification regarding the suitability and adequateness of the proposed 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020 
Page 16/199 
 
 
  
 
controls. Further information is requested on the fate and purge experiments as well as the suitability and 
adequateness of the proposed tests and acceptance criteria to further support the control strategy. A 
discussion on potential toxicity of La and Nd and risk of contamination of the active substance with the 
elements is awaited. For the material produced for toxicological studies, chromatography has been used for 
isolation rather than crystallisation which raises a question on the representativeness of the material.   
The active substance is packaged in a double layer of polyethylene bags closed with a plastic or wire tie. The 
bags are held in a high-density polyethylene or fiberboard drum with a lid, or other suitable 
container/closure system for structural support. The specification for the primary packaging and a certificate 
of analysis should be provided including IR-spectra of the PE-foil. The conformity of the primary packaging to 
Ph. Eur. or to the EU regulation 10/2011 incl. amendments should be confirmed (see recommendation 
2.2.6).  
Specification 
Remdesivir active substance specification includes appropriate tests for appearance (visual), identification 
(IR, UPLC), clarity of solution (in-house), water content (Ph. Eur.), assay (UPLC), impurities (UPLC), residual 
solvents and organic volatile impurities (GC) and bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.). 
The control strategy for remdesivir has been developed to ensure that the critical quality attributes (CQAs) 
of the active substance are consistently attained. The CQAs identified are appearance, identity, absence of 
insoluble particles, water content, assay, impurity content (including stereoisomers), residual solvent 
content, organic volatile impurity content, inorganic impurity content, potential mutagenic impurity content, 
elemental impurity content, microbial content and endotoxin content. With regards to impurities - the 
proposed controls are generally acceptable: a few questions are raised as discussed below.  
The parameters included in the specification are acceptable. It has been sufficiently justified why “elemental 
impurities”, “inorganic impurities”, “polymorphic form”, “stereochemical purity”, “particle size”, and 
“mutagenic impurities” are not included in the specification.  
With regards to the proposed acceptance criteria, these have all been discussed and justified by the 
applicant. The limits for specified impurities are based on toxicologically qualified levels. In order to improve 
the control strategy for the finished substance the MAH should revise the active substance specification by 
including the parameter “microbial limits”, by revising the proposed limits for assay, impurities, residual 
solvents, and water in line with batch data and/ or relevant guidelines and Ph. Eur. as applicable and 
confirming that the analytical method can control two unspecified impurities.  
Analytical procedures and reference standards 
The analytical procedures are all adequately described. All in house methods are sufficiently validated in line 
with ICH Q2 guideline. The stability indicating character of the impurity method was demonstrated by forced 
degradation studies. Nevertheless, as mentioned above, it should also be shown that the impurities method 
is also validated against two impurities stated to be controlled by the limit for unspecified impurities. 
Satisfactory information on the reference working standards used has been presented. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data for 13 batches were provided in total; three lab scale batches, used for toxicology, five 
pilot scale batches used for clinical studies and stability and five production scale batches used for clinical 
studies, process validation and stability.  
The batches were tested according to the specification valid at the time. The results provide a good overview 
of the batch history and the evolution in quality of the active substance. Overall, the results demonstrate 
that the active substance can be manufactured consistently and meeting the specification. 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020

Stability 
Stability data on two commercial and two pilot scale batches stored in the intended commercial packaging 
for up to 48 months under long term conditions 30 °C/ 75% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions 40 °C/ 75% RH, was provided according to the ICH guidelines. 
Samples were tested for appearance, water content, assay, and impurity content. The results showed no 
trend or a loss in assay or increase in impurity content for up to 48 months. A small increase in water 
content was observed between the initial and three-month time points for some batches but remained 
consistent thereafter for up to 48 months.  
A photostability study were performed on one pilot scale batch according to ICH Q1B Photostability Testing 
of New Drug Substances and Products. Appearance, assay, impurity content and water content were 
evaluated. According to the results remdesivir is not photolabile. 
In order to evaluate conditions that may be experienced during shipping and handling, stress studies were 
conducted at -20 °C for one month, 50 °C /ambient humidity for two weeks, and 60 °C/ambient humidity for 
one week. Samples were tested for appearance, assay, impurity content, and water content. Little to no 
change was observed. Remdesivir is therefore considered to be stable at -20°C for a period of one month, 50 
°C for two weeks and 60 °C for one week. 
Considering the overall stability data, the proposed re-test period of 48 months for the active substance 
when stored below 30°C is acceptable but may be subject to review in relation to the pending points on 
batch size and impurity control as discussed previously. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Two pharmaceutical forms have been developed; a concentrate for solution for infusion and a powder for 
concentrate for solution for infusion. Both have been used in clinical studies at different stages of 
development. Both are intended for commercialisation. Both pharmaceutical forms exhibited similar 
pharmacokinetic performance at total remdesivir doses of 75 mg and 150 mg. The strength of both proposed 
commercial formulations is 100 mg remdesivir.  
It is noted that a 150 mg strength of both pharmaceutical forms has been used in some clinical studies but it 
is not intended for commercialisation. The only difference between 100 mg and 150 mg strengths of each 
form is the fill volume. 
2.2.3.1.  Concentrate for Solution for Infusion 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a sterile, preservative-free, clear, colourless to yellow concentrate for solution for 
infusion with a concentration of 5 mg/ml and a total content of 100 mg of remdesivir. The applicant refers to 
it as ‘Remdesivir (GS-5734TM) injection’ throughout the dossier. Instead, the EDQM standard term 
‘concentrate for solution for infusion’ should be used throughout the dossier (see recommendation 2.2.6). 
The product is filled in a single use, Type I clear glass vial, sealed with an elastomeric closure and an 
aluminium overseal with a flip-off cap. Each vial contains 6% overfill in order to allow withdrawal of the 
nominal volume (20 ml) and the complete 100 mg remdesivir dose. Remdesivir concentrate for solution for 
infusion is to be diluted to 250ml with 9mg/ml (0.9%) sodium chloride solution prior to intravenous 
administration. The qualitative and quantitative composition of the finished product was presented. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020 
Page 18/199 
 
 
  
 
composition per ml finished product solution and the amounts of ingredients without overfill should be 
presented (see recommendation 2.2.6).  
Formulation development 
Remdesivir exhibited poor oral bioavailability in preclinical models and formulation development focused on 
parenteral routes of administration. Because remdesivir is poorly soluble in water, solubilising excipients and 
pH adjusting excipients were used to achieve clinically relevant concentrations of the medicine.  
Characteristics of the active substance potentially relevant for the proposed dosage form have been 
discussed. Different polymorphic forms (Material II and Form II) have been used at different stages of 
clinical trials. Form II has been used in later clinical development and primary stability studies and is the 
designated commercial form. Nevertheless, since active substance is dissolved in WFI in the course of 
finished product manufacture the polymorphic form of the active substance is not a relevant quality 
attribute. Due to the extremely low aqueous solubility of remdesivir the substituted β-cyclodextrin betadex 
sulfobutyl ether sodium (SBECD) was selected as solubiliser for the active substance. SBECD was selected 
over various surfactants tested at various levels but contrary to SBECD they did not sufficiently improve the 
active substance solubility in order to achieve clinically relevant drug concentrations. Remdesivir is 
susceptible to hydrolytic degradation under acidic and basic conditions. Relevant oxidative and/or photolytic 
degradation has only been observed at pH 7.0, but not for the specified pH range.  
Several formulation parameters were evaluated for their influence on remdesivir solubility and solution-state 
chemical stability, including solvent composition, acid/base agents and ionic strength, and surfactant type 
and content. Additionally, prototype remdesivir solutions were screened for physical and chemical 
compatibility with intravenous infusion fluids. The data generated in these screening studies, as well as 
pharmacokinetic and safety results obtained in non-clinical animal trials, led to the first 5 mg/mL 
concentrate for solution for infusion formulation developed to support Phase 1 clinical studies. This solution 
formulation contained betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium as a solubiliser and the pH was adjusted to provide 
sufficient remdesivir solubility. Sterilisation was performed via sterile filtration. The product was stored 
refrigerated (2 to 8 °C) or frozen (-25 to -10 °C) during clinical development to minimise hydrolysis of the 
active substance. A tabulated summary of clinical development batches was presented. Clinical and 
commercial formulation are identical. 
Only known excipients of compendial quality are used. Compliance of betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium with 
Ph.Eur. (2804) should be confirmed together with the requested excipient and finished product specification 
update as detailed below in “Product specification”. The filled amount of SBECD should be justified taking 
into account the content of its genotoxic impurity 1,4-butane sultone as part of the requested process 
description update as detailed below in “Manufacture of the product”. However, considering that the 
excipients included in the finished product are used at ranges typically found in parenteral dosage forms and 
the emergency context of the present application it is acceptable to follow-up this issue as a SOB in the 
context of the CMA. No novel excipients are used. No excipients of human or animal origin are used. 
Compatibility of the active substance and excipients is inferred from stability data presented and discussed 
below in this report. 
SBECD (cyclodextrin) and sodium appear in the Annex to the European Commission guideline on ‘Excipients 
in the labelling and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use’ as excipients with known effect. 
SBECD is the main source of sodium. Amounts derived from sodium hydroxide, used for pH adjustment are 
negligible. Calculation of amounts of excipients have been performed assuming a maximum daily dose 
(MDD) of 200 mg. Additionally, calculation of sodium content has been performed applying the molecular 
mass of SBECD as referenced in the respective USP monograph. The relevant information on both excipients 
have been included in the product information in line with the above guideline.

Manufacturing process development 
Detailed information on manufacturing development history is presented. The initial remdesivir concentrate 
formulation and manufacturing process were developed at a development site and later transferred with 
scale-up to a different site to initiate manufacture of clinical supplies. Comparative information on the 
manufacturing processes at all sites that have manufactured remdesivir concentrate batches are presented. 
This includes equipment, process parameters and in-process control results as well as development test 
results of representative batches. The presented comparative data show that the manufacturing processes 
are actually similar irrespective of the manufacturing site and stage of development. 
Critical quality attributes (CQAs) have been identified and tabulated summaries were presented.  
The impact of hold time on sterility of remdesivir injection solution for infusion was evaluated in relevant 
study. However, since holding times have to be justified on a site-specific basis, they are still required to be 
supported by the process validation reports and media fill results to confirm that the outcome of the 
presented development studies apply to the proposed manufacturing sites.   
It has been demonstrated that terminal sterilisation is not feasible because the active substance is not stable 
when exposed to steam sterilisation conditions resulting in significant degradation (> 5%) of remdesivir. 
Therefore, it is sterile filtered under aseptic conditions as opposed to terminally sterilized. The selected 
sterilisation method is sufficiently justified in line with the relevant decision trees depicted in the guideline on 
sterilisation of the medicinal product, active substance, excipient and primary container 
EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/850374/2015. Bioburden is controlled prior to filtration. Finished product is tested for 
sterility and bacterial endotoxins according to Ph. Eur. 
An adsorption study of remdesivir onto different filters and vial materials informed the selection of the filters 
and containers used in manufacture and the selection of the primary packaging material. 
Compatibility  
Remdesivir concentrate is administered after dilution into intravenous infusion fluid as per SmPC 6.6. In-use 
stability studies to support physical and chemical compatibility with infusion fluids are discussed below in this 
report in “Stability”. 
A compatibility test to evaluate the potential for extractable substances was performed on representative 
infusion components at conditions intended to simulate product infusion. The remdesivir concentration is the 
same for reconstituted remdesivir powder and undiluted remdesivir concentrate. The study was performed 
with the concentrate, however, the results are relevant to the powder formulation as well because the two 
formulations contain the same components, and the 5 mg/ml solution formulation represents the worst-case 
for potential of SBECD to impact levels of extractable substances in the infusion fluids. The maximum daily 
volume of administration was used to calculate estimated daily exposures for the detected extractable 
substances. The applied threshold is in in line with ICH M7 principles. The results showed that found 
amounts of extractables are toxicologically negligible. 
Container closure system  
The container closure system for Veklury 100 mg concentrate for solution for infusion consists of a Type 1 
clear glass vial, an elastomeric closure, and an aluminium seal with a flip-off cap.  Technical drawings for all 
parts of the immediate packaging were provided. Detailed descriptions and respective specifications are 
included (parameters appearance and dimensions). Primary packaging materials comply with respective Ph. 
Eur. requirements (i.e. Ph. Eur. 3.2.1 and Ph. Eur. 3.2.9).  A development study has been performed 
regarding leachables from stoppers used in the initial clinical studies. Results show only minor, 
toxicologically negligible leaching. An additional study to test for leachables will be performed on finished 
product manufactured using the proposed commercial process and packaged in the to-be-marketed 
container closure system. Considering the performed development study and the compendial quality of 
primary packaging materials, it is acceptable that the intended leachables study for commercial stoppers is

EMA/357513/2020 
Page 20/199 
 
 
  
 
not included in the MAA Dossier. Overall, the choice of the container closure is therefore regarded as 
justified. However, the dossier should be updated to include the manufacturer of the elastomeric closures 
and Certificates of Analyses for each immediate packaging component (see recommendation 2.2.6). 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The proposed manufacturer is clearly stated. The manufacturing process of Veklury concentrate for solution 
for infusion consists of the following main steps: compounding of components, mixing, pH adjustment (with 
HCL and/or NaOH), bioburden reduction filtration, sterile filtration, vial filling, capping and product 
inspection. A manufacturing process flow chart and narrative description were provided. There are no 
isolated intermediates. However, the process description should be expanded with further details by clearly 
defining the batch size in line with process validation studies. Any change in batch size outside of the 
proposed range of the batch sizes should be applied for by submission of a variation. 
The submitted information indicate that currently manufactured batches are of consistent a quality that is 
appropriate and comparable to that of clinical development batches. However, a SOB as discussed below, 
with a view to confirming that the quality of future batches will also remain appropriate and comparable to 
that of clinical development batches over the entire life cycle of the product is warranted in this respect. In 
order to ensure batch to batch consistency of the Concentrate for Solution for Infusion the MAH should 
expand the description of the manufacture of the finished product with more  details by providing the actual 
process validation report, by justifying the level of betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium, by clearly defining the 
batch size in line with process validation studies and per manufacturing site, by defining process parameters 
and acceptance criteria, by introducing additional in-process controls and by providing additional batch data . 
More specifically the process description should further specify the conditions of sterilisation for filters, glass 
vials, rubber stoppers and flip-off seals, and in addition clearly state the type of filters (sterilising and non-
sterilising). Operating parameters and in-process controls are indicated but in addition a test for container 
closure integrity should be included as in-process control and filter integrity test acceptance criteria should 
be given. Holding times should be included in the process description too. 
Critical manufacturing steps should be referenced, and their control should be described. In addition, the 
grade of environment for the preparation of solutions as well as for the filling of the final material into bulk 
containers have been performed should be confirmed and the bioburden level before prefiltration should be 
given (see recommendation 2.2.6). The presented batch formula is in line with the composition stated 
above. Batch quantity is given based on the theoretical amount of bulk solution. The theoretical number of 
filled vials should be included in the batch formula for each described batch size (see recommendation 
2.2.6).   
Process validation 
Due to the aseptic processing step, the manufacturing process is regarded to be a non-standard process 
according to Annex II of the process validation guideline. Accordingly, process validation data for production 
scale batches should be presented in addition to the provided in-process control- and release data for 4 
production scale batches and 3 slightly smaller batches. These batches are representative for production 
scale batches manufactured by the proposed manufacturer. The submitted data indicate that the process is 
suitable to consistently manufacture finished product of specified quality. Moreover, the presented data show 
that the quality of product manufactured at the proposed commercial site and the initial clinical development 
manufacturing site is similar. Nevertheless, an actual process validation report is missing and should be 
submitted; especially information on sampling is relevant to confirm the appropriateness of the presented 
data. Additionally, it is noticed that IPC and batch release results are reported for a number of consecutive 
batches, but not for all for all batches referenced in the dossier. The reason for not reporting all the batch 
data should be stated and justified. 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020

Appropriate filter validation data were also presented. However, actual filters used in routine production are 
still to be confirmed and the filter integrity test acceptance criteria should be clarified as mentioned above. 
As discussed above, the choice of the sterile filtration/aseptic processing is considered acceptable and 
sufficiently justified in line with the relevant guideline. Media fill studies have also been conducted. In order 
to confirm the appropriateness of the aseptic processing of sterile bulk product for Concentrate for Solution 
for Infusion the MAH should submit the media fill results. Specifically results for three complete runs should 
be presented, simulating the whole manufacturing process from mixing of bulk solution to sealing of vials 
including routine and worst-case interventions. The actual holding times of each step in the study and he 
maximum processing time should be also be included in the process description as discussed above. 
Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests for appearance (visual), 
identification (UPLC, UV), assay (UPLC), degradation products content (UPLC), pH(Ph. Eur.), sterility (Ph. 
Eur.), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), particulate matter (Ph. Eur.) and volume in container (Ph. Eur.). 
The finished product specification includes all parameters relevant for the dosage form. The proposed limits 
are justified but should be revised or further justified in line with batch and stability data.  
In order to improve the control strategy for the Concentrate for Solution for Infusion product the MAH should 
revise the excipient and finished product specifications by revising the limits for assay, impurities and 
endotoxins in line with batch and stability data, relevant Ph. Eur. requirements and guidelines, as applicable. 
Specifically, the limit for assay during shelf-life should be tightened unless otherwise justified. Regarding the 
impurities, no product-specific impurities are known, therefore characterisation of impurities in the finished 
product is in-line with assessment regarding active substance. The specified limits for impurities are either 
qualified by toxicological studies or the limit (for one impurity) was set considering it is an (active) 
metabolite. However, the proposed impurity limits should also take into account batch and stability data and 
be revised accordingly. In addition, the limit for unspecified degradation products should be lowered to NMT 
0.2%. to be in line with the ICH Q3B guideline’s identification threshold (0.2%). The proposed endotoxin 
limit is acceptable when the product is used in adults, but since it is stated in the SmPC that the product is 
intended for adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older it should be further tightened to an acceptable 
endotoxin level for adolescent weighing 40 kg. 
A risk assessment for potential elemental impurities was conducted in accordance with ICH Q3D. Results 
show that content is well below the maximum allowable concentration based on the permitted daily exposure 
established for parenteral route of administration and thus no control of any elemental impurities is 
warranted.  
A risk evaluation regarding potential presence of nitrosamines has been provided and is regarded as 
acceptable.  
Analytical methods are adequately described, and validation data were provided for the in-house non-
compendial methods according to ICH Q2 guideline. Satisfactory information regarding the reference 
standards used in the routine analysis of finished product has been presented. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data was provided for three commercial scale batches from the commercial manufacturer. 
Batch data from the development sites were also provided as supportive data. All provided batch results 
comply with respective specification limits and therefore indicate consistent manufacture of the finished 
product.

Stability of the product 
Stability data for three commercial scale batches from the development site and one commercial scale batch 
from the proposed commercial site have been provided. Samples have been stored in the proposed 
packaging for up to 12 months under long term conditions 2°C – 8°C and for six months under accelerated 
conditions (25°C / 60% RH) according to current ICH guidelines.  
As pointed out above, the manufacturing processes from different manufacturing sites and the formulations 
of clinical and commercial batches are regarded as similar. Moreover, batch release data for product 
manufactured by the proposed manufacturer are similar to release data from historical development 
batches. It is expected that performance of the product will also be comparable during shelf-life. It is thus 
acceptable that the stability data presented are considered representative for the finished product 
manufactured by the proposed manufacturer. Confirmation was given that stability studies have already 
been initiated with product batches manufactured by the proposed manufacturer.  
Samples were stored in inverted and upright position and were tested for appearance, pH, assay, 
degradation products and particulate matter. Sterility and bacterial endotoxin testing were performed initial 
and 12 months of storage at long term and 6 months at accelerated conditions. The methods used are 
validated and shown to be stability indicating.  
The results for all quality attributes evaluated met the specification acceptance limit at each scheduled time 
point for up to 12 months at long term conditions. No differences are observed between the data for vials 
stored in the upright and inverted orientation. 
At accelerated conditions over the six-month study, a significant decrease in remdesivir assay and increase 
in degradation product content is observed after the three-month time-point. No changes are observed in 
appearance, pH, or particulate matter for up to six months when the vials are stored in the upright or 
inverted orientations. Bacterial endotoxins and sterility were tested at initial and 6-month time points and 
complied with the specification. The data show that the finished product can be stored at 25 °C/60% RH for 
short periods of time such as may occur during shipping. 
Photostability studies are adequately conducted and show that the proposed finished product is photostable.  
Photostability was tested according to ICH Q1B on a pilot batch. Samples were tested for appearance, pH, 
assay, degradation product content, and particulate matter. No significant changes were observed in the 
results for appearance, pH, assay, degradation product content and particulate matter. The results confirm 
that the finished product is not photolabile. 
Freeze-thaw studies were also conducted in line with the provided study protocol. Samples were analysed for 
appearance, pH, assay, degradation product content, and particulate matter and results show that the 
physicochemical properties of finished product remain unaffected by repeated freezing and thawing. 
In-use stability 
An in-use stability was performed as per the SmPC reconstitution instruction in section 6.6. The study was 
performed on the 150 mg strength (not intended for commercialisation) but this is considered acceptable 
since the 100 and 150 mg only differ in the filled volume in the vial. The diluted product was evaluated for 
appearance, pH, assay, and degradation product content. The results met the predefined criteria in the 
protocol and are deemed acceptable. The proposed in-use shelf life (SmPC 6.3) is supported. Confirmation 
was also provided that an in-use stability study will also be performed with product at the end of its shelf-
life. 
The proposed shelf-life is based on real time data as trends like decrease in assay and increase in impurity 
levels have been observed. Furthermore, according to Appendix A of ICH Q1E no extrapolation is feasible 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020 
Page 23/199 
 
 
  
 
when a product is intended to be stored in a refrigerator and significant change occur at accelerated 
condition within 3 months.  
Thus, a shelf-life of 12 months with a storage restriction “store at 2-8°C” is acceptable based on provided 
data.  
Adventitious agents 
No excipients of human or animal origin are used. 
2.2.3.2.  Powder for Concentrate for Solution for Infusion 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a sterile, preservative-free, white to off-white to yellow powder for concentrate for 
solution for infusion containing 100 mg remdesivir. The applicant refers to it as ‘Remdesivir for injection’ in 
the MA dossier. The EDQM standard term ‘powder for concentrate for solution for infusion’ should be used 
throughout the dossier (see recommendation 2.2.6). The finished product is filled in a single use, Type I 
clear glass vial, sealed with an elastomeric closure and an aluminium overseal with a flip-off cap. Each vial 
contains 5% overfill in order to allow withdrawal of the nominal volume after reconstitution (20ml). 
Remdesivir powder for concentrate for solution is to be reconstituted with 19 mL of sterile water for injection 
and immediately afterwards to be diluted to 250ml or 100ml with 9mg/ml (0.9%) sodium chloride solution 
prior to intravenous administration. Dilution to 100ml should be reserved for patients with severe fluid 
restriction, e.g. ARDS or renal failure.  Following reconstitution, each vial contains a 5 mg/ml remdesivir 
solution. The qualitative and quantitative composition of the finished product is presented. The composition 
per vial and the amounts of ingredients without overfill should be presented (see recommendation 2.2.6).  
Formulation development 
The lyophilised formulation (powder for concentrate for solution for infusion) was developed from the 
concentrate for solution for infusion described above, during Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials to enable 
room temperature storage. Most of the development studies are applicable or can be extrapolated to the 
powder product. This lyophilised formulation exhibited acceptable chemical stability. Through additional 
formulation screening studies, the concentration of SBECD in the formulation was adjusted to facilitate the 
additional (compared with the concentrate formulation) lyophilisation step. This adjustment, followed by 
adjustment to the final target pH, resulted in a shorter lyophilisation cycle and produced a stable product. 
Clinical and commercial formulation are identical. The first clinical batch of the lyophilised formulation was 
manufactured using remdesivir Material 2. All subsequent clinical lots of lyophilised product were 
manufactured using remdesivir Form II. However, as discussed previously the initial crystal form of the 
active substance has no relevance since substance is dissolved in WFI in the course of the finished product 
manufacturing. 
Only known excipients of compendial quality are used. Compliance of SBECD with Ph. Eur. (2804) should be 
confirmed together with the requested excipient and finished product specification update as detailed below 
in “Product specification”. The excipients included in the finished product are used at ranges typically found 
in parenteral dosage forms. However, the filled amount of SBECD should be justified taking into account the 
content of its genotoxic impurity 1,4-butane sultone as part of the requested process description update as 
detailed below in “Manufacture of the product”. No novel excipients are used. No excipients of human or 
animal origin are used. Compatibility of the active substance and excipients is inferred from stability data 
presented and discussed below in this report. 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020 
Page 24/199 
 
 
  
 
Manufacturing process development  
Detailed information on manufacturing development history is presented. The formulation and 
manufacturing process were additionally transferred to the proposed manufacturing sites to increase 
manufacturing capacity and support commercialization. Comparative information on the manufacturing 
processes at all sites that have manufactured remdesivir powder batches are presented. This includes 
equipment, process parameters and in-process control results as well as development test results of 
representative batches. The presented comparative data show that the manufacturing processes are actually 
similar irrespective of the manufacturing site and stage of development. It is noted that LSNE is not 
proposed as commercial manufacturer. 
Critical quality attributes (CQAs) have been identified and tabulated summaries were presented. 
The preparation of the bulk fill solution for the lyophilised product follows an analogous procedure to that 
used for the concentrate product except for the final filling and lyophilisation steps. The active substance is 
dissolved in sterile water for injection with SBECD, and the pH is adjusted using HCl and/or NaOH as 
necessary. The bulk solution is next passed through a bioburden reduction filter, then sterile-filtered and 
aseptically filled to the target fill weight. The vials are partially stoppered with fluoropolymer laminated 
rubber stoppers and lyophilized, then stoppered and capped with an aluminium overseal and flip-top cap. 
However, the impact of freezing rate and annealing time during the lyophilisation process on quality 
attributes and manufacturing efficiency should be discussed as detailed below in “Manufacture of the 
product”.  
The product is sterile filtered under aseptic conditions as opposed to terminally sterilised. It has been 
demonstrated that terminal sterilisation is not feasible because the active substance is not stable when 
exposed to steam sterilisation conditions resulting in significant degradation (> 5%) of remdesivir. It has 
also been demonstrated that terminal sterilisation (by ionising radiation) is not feasible for the powder for 
solution for infusion because the product is not stable when exposed to 25 and 36 kGy ionising radiation. 
Based on the studies presented, the selected sterilisation method is considered sufficiently justified in line 
with the relevant decision trees depicted in the guideline guideline on sterilisation of the medicinal product, 
active substance, excipient and primary container EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/850374/2015. Bioburden is 
controlled prior to filtration. 
Compatibility  
The respective study on the concentrate formulation is applicable to the powder formulation too as discussed 
above.  
Remdesivir powder concentrate for solution for infusion is administered after reconstitution with sterile water 
and subsequent dilution into intravenous infusion fluid as per SmPC 6.6. In-use stability studies to support 
physical and chemical compatibility with infusion fluids are discussed below in this report in “Stability”. 
Container closure system  
The container closure system for Veklury 100 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion consists of 
a Type 1 clear glass vial, an elastomeric closure, and an aluminium seal with a flip-off cap. Technical drawing 
for all parts of the immediate packaging were provided. Detailed descriptions and respective specifications 
are included (parameters appearance and dimensions). Primary packaging materials comply with respective 
Ph.Eur. requirements (i.e. Ph.Eur. 3.2.1 and Ph.Eur. 3.2.9). It is stated that the glass vial may include a 
hydrophobic coating to aid with the lyophilization process. The qualitative composition of the hydrophobic 
coating should be stated and unambiguously laid down in respective dossier section. The dossier should also 
be updated to include the manufacturer of the elastomeric closures and Certificates of Analyses for each 
immediate packaging component (see recommendation 2.2.6). 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020 
Page 25/199 
 
 
  
 
The applicant states that a study to test for leachables in the finished product from the container closure will 
be conducted using various screening analytical methods. This is acceptable considering the dosage form 
(solid; reconstituted product has short contact time at moderate temperature, i.e. room temperature) and 
compendial quality of primary packaging materials. Overall, the choice of the container closure is therefore 
regarded as justified. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The two proposed manufacturers are clearly stated. The manufacturing process of Veklury powder for 
concentrate for solution for infusion consists of the following main steps: compounding of components, pH 
adjustment (with HCL and/or NaOH), bioburden reduction filtration, sterile filtration, vial filling, 
lyophilisation, capping and product inspection. A manufacturing process flow chart and a narrative 
description were provided. There are no isolated intermediates. The manufacturing processes at both 
proposed sites are similar. The submitted information indicate that currently manufactured batches are of 
consistent a quality that is appropriate and comparable to that of clinical development batches. However, a 
SOB as discussed below, with a view to confirming that the quality of future batches will also remain 
appropriate and comparable to that of clinical development batches over the entire life cycle of the product is 
warranted in this respect. In order to ensure batch to batch consistency of the Powder for Concentrate for 
Solution for Infusion the MAH should expand description of the manufacture of the finished product with 
more details, by providing the actual process validation report, by justifying the level of betadex sulfobutyl 
ether sodium, by clearly defining the batch size in line with process validation studies and per manufacturing 
site, by defining process parameters and acceptance criteria and by introducing additional in-process 
controls.  
Regarding the batch size, any change in batch size outside of the proposed range of the batch sizes should 
be applied for by submission of a variation. The process description should further specify the mixer speed, 
the conditions of sterilisation for filters, glass vials, rubber stoppers and flip-off seals, and in addition, clearly 
state the type of filters (sterilising and non-sterilising). Operating parameters and in-process controls are 
indicated but a test for container closure integrity should be included as in-process control and filter integrity 
test acceptance criteria should be given. Holding times should be included in the process description too. 
Moreover, the equipment working capacity should be indicated for the lyophilisation step. With regard to the 
lyophilisation step, the impact of freezing rate and annealing time on quality attributes and manufacturing 
efficiency should be discussed and the equipment working capacity should be indicated for the lyophilisation 
step. 
Critical manufacturing steps should be referenced, and their control should be described. In addition, the 
grade of environment for the preparation of solutions as well as for the filling of the final material into bulk 
containers have been performed should be confirmed and the bioburden level before prefiltration should be 
given (see recommendation 2.2.6). The presented batch formula is in line with the composition stated 
above. Batch quantity is given based on the theoretical amount of bulk solution. The theoretical number of 
filled vials should be included in the batch formula for each described batch size (see recommendation 
2.2.6).  
Process validation 
Due to the aseptic processing step as well as the lyophilisation, the manufacturing process is regarded to be 
a non-standard process according to Annex II of the process validation guideline. Accordingly, process 
validation data for production scale batches should be presented for both proposed manufacturers. In-
process control and release data for 4 production scale batches manufactured by one of the proposed 
manufacturing sites and 8 production scale batches manufactured by the second proposed manufacturing 
site are presented. Data indicates that the processes run at both proposed sites are suitable to consistently 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020 
Page 26/199 
 
 
  
 
manufacture finished product of specified quality. Moreover, the presented data show that the quality of 
product manufactured at the two proposed commercial sites, as well as the initial clinical material from the 
development manufacturing site, is similar. Nevertheless, an actual process validation report is missing and 
should be submitted also as mentioned above; especially information on sampling is relevant to confirm the 
appropriateness of the presented data. 
Appropriate filter validation data were also presented. However, actual filters used in routine production are 
still to be confirmed and the filter integrity test acceptance criteria should be clarified also as mentioned 
above. As discussed previously the choice of the sterile filtration/aseptic processing is considered acceptable.   
In order to confirm the appropriateness of the aseptic processing of sterile bulk product for Concentrate for 
Solution for Infusion the MAH should submit the media fill results. Specifically results for three complete runs 
from each of the manufacturing site should be presented, simulating the whole manufacturing process from 
mixing of bulk solution to sealing of vials including routine and worst- case interventions. The actual holding 
times of each step in the study and the maximum processing time should be also be included in the process 
description as discussed above. 
Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests for appearance (visual), 
identification (UPLC, UV), reconstitution (time, visual), water content (Ph. Eur.), assay (UPLC), degradation 
products content (UPLC), pH of solution (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), sterility (Ph. Eur.), 
bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and particulate matter (Ph. Eur.). 
The finished product specification includes all parameters relevant for the dosage form. The proposed limits 
have been justified but should be revised or further justified in line with batch and stability data. In order to 
improve the control strategy for the Powder for Concentrate for Solution for Infusion product the MAH should 
revise the excipient and finished product specifications by revising the limits for assay, impurities and water 
content in line with batch and stability data, relevant Ph. Eur. requirements and guidelines, as applicable. 
Specifically, the limit for assay during shelf-life and for water content and should be tightened unless 
otherwise justified Regarding the impurities, no product-specific impurities are known, therefore 
characterization of impurities in the finished product is in-line with assessment regarding active substance. 
The specified limits for impurities are either qualified by toxicological studies or the limit (for one impurity) 
was set considering it is an (active) metabolite. However, the proposed impurity limits should also take into 
account batch- and stability data and be revised accordingly. In addition, the limit for unspecified 
degradation products should be lowered to NMT 0.2% to be in line with the ICH Q3B guideline’s identification 
threshold (0.2%)  
A risk assessment for potential elemental impurities in was conducted in accordance with ICH Q3D. Results 
show that content is well below the maximum allowable concentration based on the permitted daily exposure 
established for parenteral route of administration and thus no control of any elemental impurities is 
warranted.  
A risk evaluation regarding potential presence of nitrosamines has been provided and is regarded as 
acceptable.  
Analytical methods are adequately described, and validation data were provided for the in-house non-
compendial methods according to ICH Q2 guideline. Satisfactory information regarding the reference 
standards used in the routine analysis of finished product has been presented. 
Batch analysis 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020 
Page 27/199 
 
 
  
 
Batch analysis data was provided for eight commercial scale batches from the first commercial manufacturer 
and from four commercial scale batches from the second. The provided data comply with respective 
specification limits but should results should be reported for all parameters included in the specification (e.g. 
data on reconstitution time is missing) for completeness of information. In addition, and for the same 
reason, the actual numerical results should be reported instead of “traces” should be reported for the 
unspecified impurity. Overall the results indicate consistent manufacture of the finished product. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data for three commercial scale batches from the development site and one commercial scale batch 
from one of the proposed commercial sites have been provided. Samples have been stored in the proposed 
packaging for up to 12 months under long term conditions 30 °C/75% RH and for six months under 
accelerated conditions (40 °C/75% RH) according to current ICH guidelines. Confirmation was given that the 
containers used in the stability studies are the same as those proposed for routine storage. 
The stability parameters tested were appearance, reconstitution, pH, water content, assay, degradation 
product content and particulate matter. All methods used are well validated and shown to be stability 
indicating. No significant changes were observed in any of the monitored parameters under any storage 
conditions compared to the initial values. Accelerated storage showed no increase in degradation impurities 
nor decrease in assay. Therefore, the shelf-life is applicable without any storage restriction.  
Supportive data for one pilot and one commercial scale batch of the 150 mg strength (by the development 
and by one of the proposed sites respectively) for up to 36 months under long-term conditions were also 
submitted.  
From the provided data it can be shown that there is no change in assay and no increase in degradation 
products. All results comply with respective acceptance limits. Only one of the supportive batches showed an 
out of specification (OOS) result regarding assay after 6 months of long-term storage. However, this batch 
also showed an assay at the lower limit of specification limit even at T=0. During storage, decrease of assay 
is comparable to the other batch data provided.  
The submitted supportive stability results for 150 mg development strength demonstrate that the product is 
stable at any tested storage condition over the complete evaluated period of time (36 months long-term / 6 
months accelerated conditions). Long-term stability results for the proposed 100 mg strength, which are 
available for up to 12 months storage, are in line with that finding. The stability profile of product batches at 
accelerated storage conditions is similar irrespective of the manufacturing site and/or fill volume (100 mg vs 
150 mg).  The supportive stability data presented for product batches of 150 mg strength are considered to 
be representative for the 100 mg strength because the composition of both strengths is qualitatively and 
quantitatively identical, the batch release data demonstrate that the product quality is similar irrespective of 
the manufacturing site and/or fill volume and the vial of the 150 mg represents a worst case scenario in 
terms of head space volume. 
No photostability studies have been conducted with the powder presentation, but reference is made to 
studies on the concentrate presentation. This is acceptable taking into account that the concentrate 
presentation is less stable than the powder presentation. Based on the data from the concentrate 
presentation the finished product is photostable. 
In-use stability studies have been extrapolated to the powder from the concentrate presentation. This is 
acceptable taking into account that, after reconstitution, the concentration of remdesivir in solution is the 
same as the concentrate (5 mg/ml). Moreover, the same instructions for dilution, administration and storage 
are applied to both formulations. However, it is noted that according to SmPC section 6.6 the dilution 
regimen for the powder for concentrate for solution for infusion after reconstitution (dilution with 0.9% 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020 
Page 28/199 
 
 
  
 
saline solution) is different; the concentrate is diluted to 250 ml whereas the reconstituted powder solution 
may be diluted to 100 or 250 ml.  
In order to further substantiate the recommendations for reconstitution and storage of the Powder for 
Concentrate for Solution for Infusion product the MAH should submit in-use stability data for reconstituted 
Powder for Concentrate for Solution for Infusion diluted to 100ml with 0.9% saline solution. Moreover, a 
justification for the different dilution regimens for Powder for Concentrate for Solution for Infusion (dilute to 
100ml or 250ml) and Concentrate for Solution for Infusion (dilute to 250ml) should be provided. The 
potential for handling errors should be considered. Specifically, the rationale for the different dilution 
regimens for remdesivir powder for concentrate for solution for infusion and remdesivir concentrate for 
solution for infusion should be provided and the risk of handling errors should be addressed. Considering the 
current differentiated reconstitution instructions in the respective SmPCs section 6.6 and the fact that the 
product is intended for hospital use only, it is acceptable that this information is submitted post approval in 
the context of a SOB of the CMA. Furthermore, as the presented in-use stability data do not cover this 
alternative dilution regimen for the powder formulation, further data should be provided to support the 
proposed in-use conditions as stated in SmPC section 6.3.  
Based on the data for the concentrate reconstituted, diluted solution for infusion may be stored up to 4 
hours at room temperature (20-25°C) or 24 hours at refrigerated temperature (2-8°C). The reconstituted 
product should be diluted immediately. 
In conclusion, based on the totality of data presented, the proposed shelf-life of 3 years as stated in SmPC 
6.3 is accepted for the 100 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients of human or animal origin are used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The applicant has applied for conditional marketing authorisation (CMA). In the context of the current public 
health emergency situation due to COVID-19 pandemic and the development history of the proposed 
medicinal products, the submitted quality documentation is considered sufficient for CMA approval. 
Active substance 
Remdesivir is an active substance that is not subject of an official compendium. Remdesivir is a chemically 
synthesised molecule, described in a two-step GMP manufacturing process. Information on development, 
manufacture and control of the active substance has been presented in the dossier. The submitted 
information indicate that currently manufactured batches are actually of a quality that is appropriate and 
comparable to that of clinical development batches. A number of issues have been identified in relation to 
the active substance that should be followed-up post approval as Specific Obligations (SOBs) in the context 
of the CMA. These relate to the synthetic process starting materials and process description. The purpose of 
these SOBs is to provide more detail in the dossier in order to confirm that a comprehensive control strategy 
is, and will be, in place throughout the future lifecycle of the product. The proposed control strategy presents 
no major deficiencies but should be further substantiated with regard to the formation of potential impurities 
in the proposed and redefined starting materials and the suitability and adequateness of the proposed 
controls should be further justified. The control strategy should also be improved with regard to certain 
active substance specification parameters and limits that should be revised in line with the presented batch 
analysis and stability data. The analytical procedures applied during development and proposed for quality 
control are all adequately described and validated as appropriate. The primary packaging of the active 
substance has been described and the proposed retest period of 48 months if stored below 30°C is 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020 
Page 29/199 
 
 
  
 
acceptable. Additionally, recommendations are made on how to further improve the quality documentation 
(see 2.2.6). The applicant has committed to pursue these issues, listed in List 1, as they have been 
discussed above in this report and detailed in the Appendix of this report within an agreed timeframe.  
Finished product 
Two pharmaceutical forms have been developed; a concentrate for solution for infusion 100 mg (5 mg/ml) 
and a powder for concentrate for solution for infusion 100 mg (5mg/ml after reconstitution). Pharmaceutical 
development of both pharmaceutical forms was presented in detail. Clinical and commercial formulations and 
manufacturing processes are similar. Excipients are of compendial grade and common for these type of 
dosage forms. Information on manufacturers, batch formula and manufacturing process is given. The 
manufacturing processes for the finished product (both pharmaceutical forms) are non-standard. The 
submitted information indicate that currently manufactured product batches are actually of a quality that is 
appropriate and comparable to that of clinical development batches. A number of issues have been identified 
related to the finished product that should be followed-up post approval as Specific Obligations (SOBs) in 
the context of the CMA. These relate to the manufacturing process description, process validation, aspects of 
the control strategy and for the powder form only, in-use stability information. The purpose of these SOBs is 
to provide more detail in the dossier in order to confirm that a comprehensive control strategy is, and will 
be, in place throughout the entire future lifecycle of the product. Satisfactory batch analysis results of the 
process validation batches have been provided but should be complemented by the full validation reports. 
The selected sterilisation processes are sufficiently justified. Additional details regarding sterile filtration and 
aseptic processing are required. The submitted production scale IPC and batch release data indicate that the 
processes run at the proposed finished product manufacturing sites are suitable to consistently manufacture 
finished product of specified quality. The proposed control strategy presents no major deficiencies but should 
be improved to be considered comprehensive. The product specifications contain all relevant parameters 
however, proposed limits should be further adjusted in line with batch analysis and stability data, and 
process validation results. A risk assessment regarding potential nitrosamine impurities has been provided 
and is regarded as acceptable. The container closure systems are acceptable. The presented stability data 
justify the proposed shelf-lives, but additional information is required to fully justify the in-use stability of 
the powder for concentrate for solution for infusion. The above issues should be followed-up post approval as 
Specific Obligations in the context of the CMA in order to ensure batch to batch consistency and thereby 
confirm the efficacy and safety of the medicinal product over its future lifecycle. Additionally, 
recommendations are made how to further improve the quality documentation (see 2.2.6). The applicant has 
committed to pursue these issues, listed in List 1, as they have been discussed above in this report and 
detailed in the Appendix of this report within an agreed timeframe. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this medicinal product, submitted in the emergency context of the current (COVID-19) 
pandemic, is considered to be consistent and acceptable in the context of a CMA.  
Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been 
investigated and are controlled in an acceptable way. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency 
and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
from a quality perspective the product should have a satisfactory and uniform clinical performance. 
The submitted information indicate that currently manufactured product batches are actually of a quality 
that is appropriate and comparable to that of clinical development batches. However, to ensure that the 
quality of future batches will also remain appropriate and comparable to that of clinical development batches 
over the life cycle of the medicinal product these issues are expected to be addressed though fulfilment of 
specific obligations, within the defined due dates. The identified issues discussed in this report and listed in

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
Remdesivir (RDV, GS-5734) is a single diastereomer mono-phosphoramidate prodrug of the nucleoside 
analog GS-441524 that is intracellularly metabolized into an active analog of adenosine triphosphate (GS-
443902) that inhibits viral RNA polymerases and has antiviral activity against members of the filoviruses (eg, 
EBOV, MARV), coronaviruses (eg, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2), and paramyxoviruses (eg, 
respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], Nipah virus [NiV], and Hendra virus).  
The non-clinical package for remdesivir includes in vitro data and in vivo efficacy data for various 
coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, and a PK bridge to human exposure. Nonclinical in vivo studies were 
in general performed with a formulation of remdesivir in 12% (w/v) sulfobutylether B-cyclodextrin sodium 
(SBECD) in sterile water for injection, pH 3.5 +/-0.1, which is representative of the clinical formulations.  
2.3.1.  Introduction 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The primary pharmacodynamics of RDV is discussed in the clinical section (pharmacodynamics). 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Within cells remdesivir is stepwise converted by hydrolase and phosphoramidase cleavage to the nucleoside 
analog monophosphate (GS-719700) and GS-441524-monophosphate. Further phosphorylation by 
nucleotide kinases results in formation of the triphosphate GS-443902.  
RDV and the (phosphorylated active metabolite) GS-441524 were broadly profiled in a suite of in vitro 
toxicity assays. GS-441524 was devoid of any effects at high concentrations, with the exception of effects on 
the proliferation of various hematopoietic stem cells, with CC50 values ranging from 9.6 to 13.9 μM. 
However, these concentrations are still > 10-fold above the systemic levels of GS-441524 reached following 
a 200-mg IV infusion of RDV. Both RDV and the nucleoside analog GS-441524 exhibit good margins in most 
in vitro toxicity assays.  
A relatively narrow exposure margin of < 3 (i.e., ratio of in vitro CC50 and clinical free Cmax of RDV) was 
observed for the cytotoxic effects of RDV in primary human hepatocytes after a prolonged incubation for 5 
days. In addition, in a separate experiment, mitochondrial toxicity and/or cellular toxicity was detected when 
human hepatocytes were treated for 3 days with RDV (0.1 to 30 µM). Results of a mechanistic study 
performed in a 2D hepatocyte model measuring different cytotoxic endpoints indicate, that RDV appears to 
be more toxic to human than rat and monkey primary hepatocytes after 14 days exposure with IC50 values 
even below 1 µM. Major metabolites GS-704277 and GS-441524 displayed a reduced toxicity (IC50 values 
between 10 – 100 µM) as compared to RDV. In a further study conducted in a 3D hepatocyte model, these 
findings could not completely be resembled. No striking differences in toxicities on hepatocytes were 
observed between RDV and its metabolites, depending on time and concentration indications of hepatocyte 
toxicities were apparent for all compounds while in H&E tissue sections only subtle changes were observed. 
These findings might explain why hepatic findings in animals are sparse as compared to humans but do not 
allow to draw a final conclusion on the impact of each compound (RDV and/or metabolite) on observed 
human liver findings (see discussion on non-clinical aspects below).

No significant inhibition of any enzyme or receptor was evident in a limited secondary pharmacology screen 
at a single concentration of 10 µM for both the diastereomeric mixture GS 466547 and the nucleoside analog 
GS-441524. The concentration of 10 µM is considered as appropriate, it is about 10 and 20 times the free 
clinical Cmax of the diastereomeric mixture GS 466547 and the nucleoside analog GS-441524, respectively. 
Usually several hundred receptors, enzymes and ion channels are investigated. However, together with the 
broad studies on cytotoxicity, the secondary pharmacology testing program is considered sufficient. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
RDV did show only a weak inhibition in vitro of the hERG channel, IC20 and IC50 values for the inhibitory 
effect were 7.5 μM and 28.9 μM, respectively; at least 6-fold and 26-fold, respectively, above the estimated 
free drug concentration (1.1 μM) at Cmax of the currently proposed 200-mg maximum clinical dose. 
According to Redfern et al., drugs are very unlikely to be tosadogenic when there is a 30-fold margin 
between Cmax and hERG IC50. 
IV administration of RDV to male cynomolgus monkeys at dose levels up to 10 mg/kg had no effect on any 
of the cardiovascular parameters tested. The NOEL for cardiovascular effects in male monkeys was 10 mg/kg 
RDV, the highest dose level tested. The exposures measured in the study itself were very low, resulting in 
very low animal:human exposures of 0.01 for RDV and 1.3 for GS-441524.In male monkeys administered 10 
mg/kg in the 2 week repeat-dose toxicity study exposures to RDV and GS-441524 at the NOEL were 
approximately 1180 and 381 ng/mL, respectively, based on the Day 1 Cmax which corresponds to 
animal:human ratios of 0.2 for RDV and 2.5 for GS-441524. Due to the low exposure, the cardiotoxic 
potential for RDV cannot be assessed by the in vivo study. 
RDV had no effect on tidal volume or minute volume; however, respiration rates were transiently increased 
in animals administered ≥ 20 mg/kg and returned to control levels by 24 hours postdose. The NOEL for 
respiratory effects in male rats was 5 mg/kg. GS-441524 exposure at the NOEL was approximately 315 
ng/mL, based on the Day 1 Cmax in male rats administered 5 mg/kg in the 2 week repeat-dose toxicity 
study which corresponds to an animal:human ratio of 2. 
RDV had no effect on neurological function. The NOEL for male rats was 50 mg/kg. GS-441524 exposure at 
the NOEL was approximately 2750 ng/mL, based on the Day 1 Cmax in male rats administered 50 mg/kg in 
the 2 week repeat-dose toxicity study (TX-399-2003), which corresponds to an animal:human exposure 
ratio of 18. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies have not been conducted.  Some recommendations have been 
issued to further address this issue in future development studies. In addition, some recommendations have 
been introduced in the SmPC as a guidance. considering the potential risks. This section will be updated 
when new data become available. (see 2.4.4 and 2.4.5)   
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The prodrug remdesivir (GS-5734) distributes into cells, where it is subsequently metabolized to form the 
pharmacologically active nucleoside triphosphate metabolite, GS-443902.  
In vitro metabolism and stability 
Within cells remdesivir is stepwise converted by hydrolase and phosphoramidase cleavage to the nucleoside 
analog monophosphate (GS-719700) and GS-441524-monophosphate. Further phosphorylation by 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020 
Page 35/199 
 
 
  
 
nucleotide kinases results in formation of the triphosphate GS-443902. Dephosphorylation of nucleotide 
metabolites results in conversion to the major circulating metabolite GS-441524, which is not readily re-
phosphorylated. 
Formation of the pharmacologically active triphosphate, GS-443902, was observed in a number of human 
lung cell types in vitro including normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) and Calu-3 as well as in PBMC, 
macrophages, monocytes, and human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC). Once formed, GS-443902 
has a half-life in excess of 15 h in the various cell types mentioned, following incubation with remdesivir in 
vitro. 
Consistent with the presence of high esterase activity in plasma in many rodent species, remdesivir was 
unstable in rat plasma (t1/2 ≤ 0.9 min). Remdesivir was substantially more stable in non-rodent species 
with t1/2 ranging from 68.5 min in human to 630 min in dog.  
[14C]Remdesivir was metabolized by mouse, rat, monkey, and human hepatocytes, primarily via hydrolysis. 
The rate of biotransformation in mouse and rat was faster relative to monkey and human at both 1 and 10 
μM concentrations. The remaining unchanged [14C]remdesivir accounted for <10% of the total radioactivity 
in samples across all the species at 120 minutes. In all four species, most of the [14C]remdesivir-derived 
radioactivity was associated with three major metabolites; GS-704277, GS-441524, and GS-441524-
monophosphate generated via hydrolysis. GS-704277 was the predominant component. 
In vivo metabolism 
Following IV administration of 10 mg/kg [14C]remdesivir to intact and bile duct-cannulated Sprague Dawley 
rats, most of the radioactivity in plasma, bile, and urine was associated with the nucleoside analog GS 
441524. No unchanged remdesivir was detected in any of these matrices. The other major systemic 
metabolite, GS-704277, was also an abundant component in plasma and bile, contributing approximately 
19% and 20.3% of the total radioactivity exposure through 36 and 24 hours, respectively. 
Following IV administration of 10 mg/kg [14C]remdesivir to monkeys, the nucleoside analog GS-441524 was 
the only circulating component in the AUC-pooled plasma sample and accounted for 100% of the total 
radioactivity exposure through 96 hours. However, profiles of individual plasma samples showed radioactive 
peaks associated with remdesivir, GS-704277, GS-441524 and GS-441524-glucuronide. 
Following IV administration of 10 mg/kg [14C]remdesivir to rabbits, unchanged remdesivir contributed <1% 
of the total radioactivity through 96 hours in plasma. GS-441524 was the major circulating metabolite in 
plasma and accounted for approximately 45% and desamino-hydroxy-GS-441524 contributed approximately 
25% of the total radioactivity exposure through 96 hours, while profiles of individual plasma samples also 
showed peaks associated with GS-704277 
Plasma pharmacokinetics 
Plasma pharmacokinetics for remdesivir, GS-441524 and GS704277 were studied following single-dose IV 
administration in the rat, cynomolgus monkey, rhesus monkey and African green monkeys.  
The clearance of remdesivir exceeded liver blood flow in all species. In the rat remdesivir and GS-704277 
achieved maximal concentrations in plasma during the infusion and exhibited short terminal elimination half-
lives of 0.05 and 0.25 h, respectively. The nucleoside analog, GS-441524, achieved maximal concentration 
in plasma of 7.82 μM and persisted with a terminal half-life of 6.2 h. In cynomolgus monkeys remdesivir and 
GS-704277 achieved maximal concentrations in plasma during the infusion and exhibited short terminal 
elimination half-lives of 0.29 and 0.84 h, respectively. The nucleoside analog, GS-441524, achieved maximal 
concentration in plasma of 1.15 μM and persisted with a terminal half-life of around 7.2 h. Also, in the 
rhesus monkey remdesivir was rapidly eliminated followed by the sequential appearance of GS-704277 and 
GS-441524. The plasma profiles of remdesivir, GS-704277, and GS-441524, following 10 mg/kg remdesivir 
Assessment report

were consistent with those seen in cynomolgus monkeys. Plasma exposures to all metabolites showed 
roughly dose-proportional increases between 3 and 10 mg/kg following IV bolus administration. 
Intracellular (PBMC) pharmacokinetics of GS-443902 
Since all target cells relevant for SARS-CoV-2 infection are not fully understood and may not be easily 
monitored for drug levels, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were initially used as a surrogate to 
assess intracellular activation following remdesivir administration.  
The intracellular (PBMC) pharmacokinetics of remdesivir and its metabolites following a single IV 
administration of 3 or 10 mg/kg remdesivir were assessed in male rhesus monkeys, Levels of GS-443902 in 
PBMC achieved a Cmax of 33.3 μM at 2 h and had an apparent intracellular terminal elimination t1/2 of 
approximately 14 h. This is in line with the t1/2 of 15 h observed in human PBMCs and other cell types 
following in vitro incubation with remdesivir. In human subjects at clinically relevant dosing, however, the 
t1/2 in PBMCs was 43 h at steady state. In the rhesus monkey PBMC exposures to all metabolites showed 
roughly dose-proportional increases between 3 and 10 mg/kg following IV bolus administration.  
The concentration-time profile of GS-443902 in PBMC was assessed following multiple daily IV administration 
of remdesivir as either bolus or infusion at 5 mg/kg for 7 days in the Rhesus monkey. Formation of the 
pharmacologically active triphosphate, GS-443902, was observed in PBMCs, with accumulation to steady-
state concentrations achieved by day 7. No marked difference in exposure of GS-443902 in PBMCs was 
observed between bolus or infusion administration following daily dosing for 7 days. The results of iv PK 
studies conducted in rats and monkeys (Cynomolgus and Rhesus) indicate that administration of remdesivir 
results in substantial exposure to remdesivir parent compound and subsequently formed metabolites in 
plasma and tissues. Both rat and monkey formed the intermediate metabolite GS-704277 and the nucleoside 
metabolite GS-441524. Whereas in rats remdesivir is quickly (within 0.05 h) removed, metabolism in 
monkeys is somewhat slower (t ½ for remdesivir is 0.3 h) and mimics more the kinetic in human (t ½ 0.89 
h). GS-441524 is the predominant metabolite in plasma observed in all nonclinical studies, and no gender 
difference in tested animals was noted. 
In the performed iv PK studies in rats and monkeys, concentrations of GS-441524 and its phosphorylated 
metabolites were determined in PBMC at different time points. The nucleotide metabolites are rapidly formed 
and accumulate in PBMC following IV administration of remdesivir. The triphosphate analog (GS-443902) 
was the predominant metabolite in PBMCs and showed a persistent activity at 24 h.  
Distribution 
Remdesivir showed moderate protein binding in the rat, cynomolgus monkey, and rhesus monkey with a 
free fraction ranging from 8.0% in rat to 14.2% in cynomolgus monkey. The free fraction in human was 
12.1%. The metabolites GS-704277 and GS-441524 exhibited very low protein binding in plasma from all 
tested species. The blood/plasma concentration ratios for remdesivir were 0.71 and 0.76 for the rhesus 
monkey and human, respectively, and for GS-704277 1.36 and 1.19, respectively indicating some exclusion 
of remdesivir from the cellular fraction and some association with the cellular fraction for GS-441524. 
The tissue distribution following a single intravenous dose of [14C]remdesivir at 10 mg/kg to male Sprague 
Dawley (SD; non-pigmented) and Long Evans (LE; pigmented) rats was determined by quantitative whole 
body autoradiography. [14C]Remdesivir-derived radioactivity was widely distributed to most tissues by the 
first collection time point (0.167 hours postdose) in both SD and LE male rats. Distribution of radioactivity 
was similar in both SD and LE rats. Most of the tissues reached maximum concentration (Cmax) by the first 
collection time point for both SD and LE rats. Low levels of radioactivity were detected in testes, suggesting 
[14C]remdesivir-derived radioactivity crossed the blood to testes barrier. Radioactivity was eliminated from 
majority of the tissues by 96 hours postdose in both SD and LE rats. No melanin binding was observed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020

In SD rats, the tissues showing the highest maximum concentrations of radioactivity included kidney cortex, 
kidney, kidney medulla, liver, arterial wall, nonpigmented skin, cecum, urinary bladder, and esophagus. The 
tissues with the lowest Cmax values were brain medulla, spinal cord, brain cerebellum, brain cerebrum, and 
bone. Radioactivity was cleared from the majority of tissues by 96 hours postdose, with the exception of 
cecum, kidney, kidney cortex, kidney medulla, liver, nonpigmented skin, stomach, and urinary bladder. At 
168 hours postdose, radioactivity was still quantifiable in kidney, kidney cortex, kidney medulla, liver, and 
nonpigmented skin. 
In LE rats, the distribution of radioactivity was similar to SD rats, and the tissues showing the highest 
maximum concentrations of radioactivity included kidney cortex, kidney, kidney medulla, liver, cecum, 
urinary bladder, arterial wall, and pigmented skin. The tissues with the lowest Cmax values were brain 
cerebellum, brain olfactory lobe, eye lens, abdominal fat, and bone. Radioactivity was cleared from the 
majority of tissues by 96 hours postdose, with the exception of kidney, kidney cortex, kidney medulla, liver, 
and pigmented skin. At 168 hours postdose, radioactivity was still quantifiable in kidney, kidney cortex, and 
pigmented skin. No melanin binding was observed. 
The distribution of remdesivir was also determined by liquid scintillation counting following a single IV 
administration of 10 mg/kg [14C]remdesivir to male cynomolgus monkeys. Tissues showing the highest 
mean concentrations of radioactivity at 4 hours postdose, excluding GI tract, were gall bladder, kidneys, 
liver, prostate gland, salivary gland (mandibular), pancreas, and seminal vesicle(s). Notably, appreciable 
levels of radioactivity were also found in lung tissue, while some of the lowest levels were seen in bone, 
brain, eye and testis(es). Total radioactivity declined over 168 h; elimination of radioactivity was not 
complete, and radioactivity was still quantifiable in most tissues. At 168 hours, a mean of 8.26% of the 
administered dose was retained in the tissues, mostly in liver and muscle. Most of the radioactivity in select 
samples was associated with GS-441524, indicating metabolism of remdesivir. In the whole body 
autoradiography experiments in rats and radiolabel distribution study in monkeys the trace levels of 14C-
remdesivir reveal fast and widely distribution to most tissues by the first collection time point (0.167 hours). 
Distribution of radioactivity was similar in non-pigmented and pigmented rats, indicating no relevant melanin 
binding. In both species, tissues with the highest maximum concentrations of radioactivity included kidney 
and liver, at 168 hours postdose radioactivity was still quantifiable in kidney. Radioactivity were recovered in 
urine and faeces in rat and monkey, indicating renal and biliary excretion as the major routes of elimination 
in all studied animal species. 
Excretion 
The routes and extent of remdesivir excretion were determined after IV administration of 10 mg/kg 
[14C]remdesivir to Sprague-Dawley rats, rabbits and cynomolgus.  
In the rat means of 63.0% and 27.8% of the administered radioactivity were excreted in urine and faeces, 
respectively, by 168 hours postdose indicating renal and biliary excretion were the major routes of 
elimination. Mean overall recoveries of radioactivity after intravenous dosing to intact and bile duct-
cannulated rats were 95.1 and 95.3%, respectively. In the rabbit means of 67.0 and 11.9% of the 
administered radioactivity were excreted in urine and faeces, respectively, by 168 hours postdose. Overall 
mean recovery of radioactivity after IV dosing to rabbits was 91.7%. In the cynomolgus, means of 33.6% 
and 25.6% of the administered radioactivity were recovered in urine and faeces, respectively, by 168 hours 
postdose, indicating that renal and biliary excretion were the major routes of elimination. Significant 
radioactivity was recovered in cage rinses, accounting for a mean of 16.9% of the dose. Overall mean 
recovery in monkeys was 78.8%.  
Overall, the basic pharmacokinetic data obtained for remdesivir in various animal species together with the 
intracellular profiling and kinetics of phosphorylated metabolites, namely activation and persistence (up to 
24 h) of the pharmacological active triphosphate GS-443902 in bronchoepithelial and lung tissue following IV 
administration in American green monkeys, support its clinical use in lung associated virus infections.

No formal single dose toxicity studies were conducted. However, single dose PK studies in Wistar Han rat, 
cynomolgus monkey, and rhesus monkey were performed. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat-dose toxicity in rats and cynomolgus monkeys have been conducted, 2-week studies with a 4-week 
recovery period, and 4-week studies in both species. The 2-week GLP repeat dose studies incorporated a 
saline and vehicle control group. Dose levels in the 2-week GLP studies were based on single-dose IV 
pharmacokinetic studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys, and target organ toxicity observed in a non-GLP 
repeat-dose 7-day IM study in cynomolgus monkeys.  
The 2- and 4-week studies included a comprehensive battery of kidney function/injury biomarkers; the 
2-week studies also included 4-week recovery periods to assess reversibility from any observed effects. In 
most studies, blood was collected for plasma analysis of remdesivir, the nucleoside metabolite, GS-441524, 
and the intermediate metabolite, GS-704277.  
In addition, a 7-day non-GLP toxicity study with a 10-day recovery period in rhesus monkey was performed. 
An additional 7-day non-GLP study using intramuscular administration of GS-466547 (diastereomeric 
mixture) in cynomolgus monkeys was carried out.  
In the rat repeated i.v. doses of RDV for 2 weeks resulted in decreases in body weight gain and food 
consumption, and clinical pathology and microscopic findings indicative of kidney injury and/or dysfunction in 
males administered ≥ 5 mg/kg/day and in females administered ≥ 20 mg/kg/day. Effects on body weight 
gain and food consumption, and clinical pathology and microscopic findings were mainly reversible after a 4-
week recovery period. There was no NOAEL for males. The NOAEL for females was 5 mg/kg/day which 
corresponds to 0.6 x human AUC of GS-441524. 
Also in the 4-week study in rats clinical pathology and microscopic findings indicative of kidney injury and/or 
dysfunction in animals administered ≥ 3 mg/kg/day, and unscheduled deaths of 2 females and decreased 
body weight gain and food consumption at 10 mg/kg/day were seen. Based on the nature and severity of 
the kidney changes the NOAEL was 3 mg/kg/day, which corresponds to 0.4-fold (males) and 0.2-fold 
(females) the human AUC of GS-441524. 
IV administration of RDV to male rhesus monkeys for 7 days resulted in one high dose animal euthanized 
early on Day 6. The cause of morbidity was attributed to RDV-related kidney findings. These findings 
considered adverse at all dose levels consisted of increased mean urea nitrogen and increased mean 
creatinine indicating altered kidney function, with correlating histopathology findings of renal tubular atrophy 
and basophilia and casts. The kidney observations were considered adverse at all dose levels as there was a 
loss of tubules and resulting interstitial fibrosis in one recovery animal suggestive of the finding progressing 
to chronicity. Based on these results, a NOAEL cannot be assigned to any of the dose levels under the 
conditions of this study; animal:human exposure ratios were < 1 for both, RDV and GS-441524. 
Whereas, IV administration of RDV to male and female cynomolgus monkeys for 15 days or 4 weeks at 
doses up to 10 mg/kg/day did not result in any adverse findings. However, these studies are of limited 
relevance as the doses administered are not sufficient to determine toxic effects. Exposure at the highest 
dose is in the range of therapeutic exposure, in both studies. 
On the other hand, after daily IM administration of GS-466547 (diastereomeric mixture; 2.5, 7.5 and 15 
mg/kg/day) to cynomolgus monkeys for 7 days (non-GLP), kidney changes similar to those noted in rats 
were observed. At 15 mg/kg/day, animals had adverse kidney changes (proximal tubular epithelial cell

degeneration/necrosis) that were visible macroscopically as pale kidney cortices and correlated with 
increased kidney weights in animals at ≥7.5 mg/kg/day. Clinical pathology changes in the blood and urine 
were compatible with renal dysfunction. The NOAEL was set at 7.5 mg/kg/day. At 7.5 mg/kg/day, the mean 
sex combined exposures on Day 7 were: AUC0-24 of 4350 ng·h/mL for GS-466547; AUC0-24 of 3370 ng·h/mL 
for GS-441524; and AUC0-24 of 2980 ng·h/mL for GS-704277. Thus, higher systemic exposure to metabolites 
were observed after IM administration which may explain the observation of kidney toxicity. 
Taken together, in the IV repeat dose studies with RDV, toxicity findings were consistent with dose 
dependent and mainly reversible kidney injury and dysfunction at doses equal to or greater than 3 
mg/kg/day in rats and 5 mg/kg/day in rhesus monkeys. There were no observable kidney changes in 
cynomolgus monkeys administered IV RDV at 10 mg/kg/day. Animal:Human ratios at the NOAEL were ≤ 1 
in all repeated-dose toxicity studies. 
The renal toxicity in the rat, cynomolgus monkey and rhesus monkey is extensive and occurs after a very 
short time. In the 2-week rat study the effects were mainly reversible, but it is not known whether this is the 
case after a longer treatment period. It is not understood why the applicant did not include a recovery phase 
in the 4-week studies. The good tolerability in the cynomolgus monkey is relativized by the fact that the 
highest dose of 10 mg/kg leads to exposures that are in the range of therapeutic exposures. 
Based on cytotoxicity studies with HEK-293 cells overexpressing the human and rat variants of the organic 
anion transporters OAT1 and OAT3, the applicant concludes that rat nephrotoxicity is due to preferential rat 
OAT3-mediated uptake of the RDV metabolite GS-704277. According to the applicant, this toxicity is unlikely 
to occur in humans, because the HEK293 cell experiments suggest that human OAT1/3 transports GS-
704277 with much less efficiency than the corresponding rat OATs. Moreover, plasma esterase activity 
responsible for GS-704277 formation is lower in humans as compared to rats, and therefore, GS-704277 is 
formed to a much lesser extent in humans. However, the presented in vitro data cannot explain the 
nephrotoxicity observed in rhesus monkeys. In addition, the in vitro data are not considered sufficient to 
exclude nephrotoxicity in human patients for the following reasons: 
I. 
GS-704277 reaches a Cmax of 3130 ng/ml in rats after a 4-week administration of 10 mg/kg/day of 
RDV. This concentration, at which the animals develop clear signs of nephrotoxicity, corresponds to ~7.1 
µM. This, however, is ~19-fold lower than the CC50 value of GS-704277 (137.4 µM) in rat OAT3-expressing 
HEK-293 cells. Thus, unknown factors other than OAT3-mediated transport may be responsible for rat 
nephrotoxicity. 
II. 
Even if rat OAT3-mediated transport into tubular epithelial cells is the cause for rat-specific 
nephrotoxicity of GS-704277, certain patient subpopulations may show increased susceptibility for 
nephrotoxicity caused by RDV and/or metabolites for the following reasons:  
•  Certain OAT genetic variants (polymorphisms) may exist, which lead to a more efficient uptake of 
RDV metabolites into tubular epithelial cells, resulting in a higher nephrotoxicity risk. 
• 
The extrusion of RDV metabolites from tubular epithelial cells, e.g. by multidrug resistance-
associated protein (MRP)-mediated transport or other relevant transporters, has to be considered, 
too. Individual genetic variants of such transporters may lower extrusion of RDV metabolites and put 
certain patient subgroups at an increased risk of nephrotoxicity. 
As the exact mechanism of the nephrotoxicity observed in preclinical studies is currently unclear, the 
occurrence of such adverse events in human patients cannot be fully excluded. This can only be clarified by 
clinical data. However, at least caution should be applied in clinical use, and constant monitoring is required, 
specifically with regard to potential renal adverse effects. 
SBECD: The remdesivir drug product contains the excipient SBECD. According to EMA review approximately 
250 mg/kg/day of SBECD (~15 g/day based on a 60 kg human) for 6 months is safe in humans older than 2

years. The RDV drug product concentrate contains 6.36 g SBECD per vial (0.105 g RDV) and the RDV drug 
product powder contains 3.146 g SBECD per vial (0.105 g RDV). Thus, with a daily dose of 100 mg RDV, 
6360 mg or 3146 mg SBECD were administered, respectively; with a loading dose of 200 mg RDV, the twice 
amount. Hence, the limit of 15000 per day is not exceeded in the intended clinical use. However, the use of 
SBECD is contraindicated for patients with renal impairment. This is of particular importance considering the 
severe nephrotoxicity of RDV in rats and monkeys. 
Genotoxicity 
RDV and metabolite GS-441524 were negative in in vitro Ames tests. In a chromosome aberration assay in 
human peripheral blood lymphocytes RDV showed an equivocal response after metabolic activation and was 
negative without metabolic activation. In an in vivo micronucleus test performed in rats, RDV was negative 
up to doses of 50 mg/kg/d at GS-441524 exposures of about an order of magnitude higher than the 
anticipated human exposure. In conclusion, RDV and metabolite GS-441524 are not considered to be 
genotoxic. 
Carcinogenicity 
RDV is indicated for short-term use only, no carcinogenicity studies have been performed. This is agreed 
upon. 
Reproduction and developmental toxicity 
A complete program as requested by ICH M3(R2) and ICH S5 of reproductive and developmental toxicity 
studies was performed in rats and rabbits with intravenous injection of remdesivir. 
In the fertility and early embryonic toxicity study in rats, a significant reduction in number of corpora lutea, 
implantation sites and viable embryos, and lower mean ovary and uterus/cervix/oviduct weights were noted 
at doses above 3 mg/kg/day (≈0.3x clinical exposure). No adverse effects on male reproductive 
performance or on spermatogenesis data were observed. Thus, the NOAEL for male and female fertility was 
10 and 3 mg/kg/day, respectively. Furthermore, male and female systemic toxicity was noticed at 10 
mg/kg/day in the fertility study in rats. The NOAEL was at exposures below human therapeutic exposure for 
the metabolites GS-441524 and GS-704277. Remdesivir did not show any adverse effects on male 
reproductive performance and fertility at exposures about 2-fold for GS-44125, respectively 5-fold for GS-
704277, compared to human therapeutic exposures. 
In the embryo-foetal development study in rats, no remdesivir-related adverse effects were observed and 
the NOAEL for maternal toxicity and embryo-foetal development was 20 mg/kg/day. In the embryo-foetal 
development study in rabbits, maternal toxicity was observed at 20 mg/kg/day, but no remdesivir-related 
adverse effects on embryo-foetal development were identified. Thus, the NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 10 
mg/kg/day, and for embryo-foetal development 20 mg/kg/day. There were no effects of remdesivir on 
embryo-fetal development in rats and rabbits with NOAELs of 20 mg/kg/day in both studies. Remdesivir 
plasma concentrations were below the limit of quantification in rats indicating that remdesivir was rapidly 
cleared and extensively metabolised in this species. In rabbits, exposure to remdesivir was shown. The 
exposures at the NOAEL in comparison to human therapeutic exposures were about 4- to 7-times above 
human therapeutic exposures for the metabolites in the rat. In the rabbit, exposure levels at the NOAEL 
were 2-to 25-times for remdesivir and the different metabolites. 
Placental transfer studies for remdesivir or its metabolites were not conducted. 
In the rat pre- and post-natal development study, there were no adverse effects noted in any of the 
investigated parameters. Thus, the NOAELs for F0 maternal toxicity, and F1 developmental/neonatal, F1 
parental systemic, F1 reproductive, and F2 neonatal/early postnatal toxicity were all 10 mg/kg/day. 
Exposures at the NOAEL were about human therapeutic exposures for GS-441524 and 3-times human 
therapeutic exposures for GS-704277.

Remdesivir could not be detected in the blood of rat dams and pups. Dams were exposed to the metabolites 
GS-441524 and GS-704277 and exposure increased approximately with increasing doses of remdesivir. No 
accumulation was observed for the metabolites in maternal animals. Exposure to GS-441524 was shown for 
rat pups on PND 10, but concentrations of GS-704277 were not measurable. Altogether, Cmax levels of GS-
441524 were higher in maternal rats than in pups with exposure ratios of 43- to 143-times. Milk transfer of 
remdesivir and/or the metabolite GS-441524 can therefore be assumed which should be considered for 
SmPC labelling. 
Juvenile toxicity 
No juvenile studies have been conducted with remdesivir. This is in agreement with the PDCO decision.   
Local Tolerance  
Remdesivir is intended for IV administration. Dedicated local tolerance studies with remdesivir have not been 
conducted; however, evaluation of local tolerance following IV administration was conducted in the repeat-
dose GLP studies. In the 2-week rat study, remdesivir-related injection site observations included red 
discoloration of tail skin observed in males administered ≥20 mg/kg/day and females administered ≥5 
mg/kg/day. In the absence of any correlating microscopic findings, these findings were not considered 
adverse. There were no treatment-related injection site changes observed in monkeys administered 
remdesivir IV up to 10 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks. Thus, no particular concerns on local tolerance have been 
identified. In addition, remdesivir is not a dermal or ocular irritant.  
Phototoxicity 
The ultraviolet-visible absorption spectrum of remdesivir exhibits absorbance maxima at 209, 246 and 274 
nm. The molar extinction coefficients were 1.7 x 104 L mol-1cm-1 at 209 nm, 3.8 x 104 L mol-1cm-1 at 246 nm 
and 0.6 x 104 L mol-1cm-1 at 274 nm. Thus, no absorption above the threshold of 1000 L mol-1cm-1 within 
the range of natural sunlight (290 to 700 nm) is observed. In tissue distribution studies in Sprague Dawley 
and Long Evans rats following a single IV administration of [14C]-remdesivir, high concentrations of 
radioactivity were observed in skin but binding to non-pigmented and pigmented skin was similar. No 
melanin binding was observed. Thus, remdesivir does not fulfil the criteria for further phototoxicity testing 
according to the ICH S10 guideline, and there are no phototoxicity concerns.  
Immunotoxicity 
No dedicated immunotoxicity studies have been performed with remdesivir. This is considered acceptable as 
no concerns were identified by standard assessments in repeat-dose toxicology studies. 
Dependence 
No specific studies on dependency of remdesivir were conducted. This is acceptable. 
Mechanistic studies  
Studies were conducted to investigate the potential of remdesivir and its major systemic metabolites, 
GS-441524 and GS-704277, to affect primary human and animal hepatocytes using several in vitro models. 
Data from these in vitro studies demonstrated that human hepatocytes are susceptible to 
remdesivir-mediated toxicity, likely due to the high cellular permeability and effective intracellular 
metabolism of the drug. GS-441524 and GS-704277 are unlikely to contribute significantly to changes in 
liver enzymes observed in humans treated with repeated doses of remdesivir due to their low systemic 
exposure and minimal effects on hepatocytes demonstrated in several independent studies. 
Metabolites 
The metabolite GS-441524 was tested in a non-GLP reverse mutation assay and concluded as negative. 
Apart from this in vitro study, no other dedicated studies were performed with remdesivir metabolites.

GS-441524 and GS-704277 are considered toxicologically qualified in the repeat-dose and reproductive 
toxicity studies. 
Impurities 
The proposed specifications of NMT 1.50% for GS-643132, and NMT 1.00% for GS-441524, GS-711463, GS-
709194, GS-773151, GS-829104, GS-773085 and GS-772931A/B are considered acceptable based on 
toxicological qualification. In addition, the impurity GS-711463 was predicted non-mutagenic based on expert 
opinion. 
Based on the negative results of the Ames test, GS-709200 can be considered as not-mutagenic and can be 
treated as class 5 impurity according to guideline ICH M7(R1). 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
A final conclusion on potential risk of remdesivir to the environment based on the available data cannot be 
drawn right now.  
The applicant submitted an Environmental risk assessment with Phase I for Remdesivir, a pro-drug of the 
nucleoside analog GS-441524. 
Initial screening PECsurface water values of 1.0 and 0.48 μg·L-1 for remdesivir and GS-441524, respectively, 
were calculated based upon the maximum daily dose (200 mg) of remdesivir. Both values exceed the EMA 
guideline action limit of 0.01 μg·L-1 therefore the PECsurfacewater values were refined by modifying the Fpen 
based on estimated potential patient population and the fixed treatment regime of the product. COVID-19 is 
an acute disease and hence remdesivir has a short treatment period of a maximum of 10 days. For COVID-
19 reliable prevalence data is not available due to the novel nature of this disease, nor is prevalence a 
meaningful measurement for an acute disease. Instead the Applicant has estimated the patient population 
based on the latest confirmed case numbers available at time of writing. Using the modified Fpen, 
PECsurfacewater values of 0.003 and 0.0015 μg·L-1 were estimated and a Phase II assessment was not provided. 
It is agreed that COVID-19 is an acute novel disease, with a presumable limited treatment period. 
Refinement based on limited treatment period can be accepted. However, a limit of 10 treatment days has 
not yet been identified in an SmPC. It cannot be excluded that prolonged treatment periods will be 
recommended in the future. It can be accepted that the treatment will be limited to one period per year per 
patient. 
In addition, the prevalence data, or rather the number of estimated cases in the EU-population, is highly 
uncertain due to the availability / prioritizing of confirmatory testing and a daily increasing rate of confirmed 
cases. However, since the applicant considers that every confirmed case represents an individual requiring 
treatment with remdesivir a refined Fpen of 0.001 can be accepted at this moment.  
The n-octanol/water partitioning behaviour of remdesivir was investigated using the shake-flask method. 
The measured log P was 3.2. The log P of GS-441524 was estimated, using the in-silico model KOWWIN, to 
be -1.79. No study data on the n-octanol/water partition coefficient value of remdesivir have been 
submitted, for GS-441524 the value is a calculated one by using a QSAR method. According to the EMA 
guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use, the submission of data 
on a n-octanol/water partition coefficient value is part of a Phase I ERA to allow for a PBT screening. Hence, 
the log Kow should be determined experimentally. Studies performed in accordance with OECD Test 
Guidelines are preferred. A calculated value is generally not acceptable.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
The primary pharmacodynamics of RDV is discussed in the clinical section. 
The secondary pharmacology testing program performed for RDV and the nucleoside analog GS-441524 is 
considered sufficient.  
Considering the potential of RDV to affect mtDNA and induce cytotoxic liver effects slightly above 
therapeutically relevant drug concentrations ,the applicant was asked to  include the risk of hepatoxicity to 
the safety concerns of the RMP and to provide relevant information on the risk of hepatotoxicity in e.g. 
section 4.2 and 4.8 of the SmPC document. The risk of hepatoxicity has been added to the safety concerns 
of the RMP to provide relevant information on the risk of hepatotoxicity in e.g. section 4.2 and 4.8 of the 
SmPC document (see clinical section for details).In addition, the applicant  is requested to submit an 
integrated analysis of all available safety data from clinical trials investigating COVID-19 (CO-US-540-5776, 
GS-US-540-5773, GS-US-540-5774 and CO-US-540-5758) where this issue will be further evaluated.  
Safety pharmacology data (cardiovascular, respiratory, CNS) do not indicate any obvious safety concerns. 
However, the exposure margins in the cardiovascular studies were low for both RDV (∼ 0.2x) and GS-441524 
(< 3x) compared to the clinical exposure at the recommended human dose. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The results of iv PK studies conducted in rats and monkeys (Cynomolgus and Rhesus) indicate that 
administration of remdesivir results in substantial exposure to remdesivir parent compound and 
subsequently formed metabolites in plasma and tissues. Due to the very fast (within a few minutes) 
disappearance of remdesivir in rats, the PK profile observed in monkeys seem to better mimic the human 
situation. Remdesivir (metabolite) was clearly distributed throughout the respiratory tissues, however, 
similar to the results from radiolabel distribution study highest levels of GS-441524 and phosphorylated 
metabolites were in kidney and liver. 
Absorption, distribution, and metabolism studies indicate that the rat, the cynomolgus monkey, and the 
rabbit appear to be relevant species for the toxicological evaluation, at least based on the formation of most 
major metabolites. The active GS-443902 was shown to be formed intracellularly in the cynomolgus albeit 
possibly at a 3-4-fold lower rate than in humans. However, no studies on intracellular formation of GS-
443902 was presented in the rat or the rabbit. Based on the high plasma esterase activity and the low half-
life of remdesivir observed in the rat it is unclear if the active GS-443902 is formed at all in the rat. 
Formation in the rabbit has not been addressed. Therefore, the applicant should provide data on the 
intracellular formation of the active substance in the rat and the rabbit, as recommended by the CHMP. The 
pharmacokinetic studies were exclusively performed in male animals precluding any conclusions to be drawn 
on gender differences. Toxicokinetic analysis was however performed in both sexes.  
In addition, the clinical mass balance study indicates presence of an unidentified major and possible human-
specific metabolite M27 in plasma. Until M27 is identified, it is unclear if further non-clinical testing is 
warranted.  
Finally, a detailed and comprehensive evaluation of potential interactions on enzymes and transporters is 
given in the Clinical AR (pharmacokinetic interaction studies), where several concerns are raised.  
Toxicology 
The non-clinical GLP safety program is in scope consistent with the ICH M3(R2) guideline for a product with 
a proposed dosing regimen for up to 2 weeks. 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020

After repeated IV administration of remdesivir in GLP and non-GLP studies, signs of kidney injury (i.e. kidney 
tubular epithelium) and/or reduced function was evident as indicated by biomarkers at clinically relevant 
exposures in rats and rhesus monkeys. A similar kidney toxicity was seen in cynomolgus monkeys following 
IM administration of GS-466547 (racemate) but not following IV administration of remdesivir. A higher 
exposure of remdesivir and metabolites were observed after IM administration which may explain the 
presence of kidney toxicity. 
The toxicity to kidney tubular epithelium was observed after short treatment durations and at or below 
clinically relevant exposures. While a full pathological examination was performed at study terminations at 
2/4 weeks in rats and at 10 days in the rhesus non-GLP study, urine chemistry/biomarkers indicated 
functional disturbance and damage already after 4 days of treatment. Additionally, a death ascribed to renal 
toxicity was observed on Day 6 in rhesus monkeys.  
The kidney toxicity is a concern for the patient population. No mechanism for the toxicity has been proposed 
although the Applicant speculates that the toxicity may be OAT3-dependent in rats. GS-704277, but not 
remdesivir or GS-441524, is an effective substrate of rat OAT3 and exhibits rat OAT3-dependent 
cytotoxicity. Whether a similar mechanism can explain the findings in monkeys is not clear. No further 
discussion on the mechanism for renal tubular damage observed in non-clinical species and the implications 
of these nephrotoxic effects in patients has been provided. The findings are described in SmPC section 5.3 
and a warning for renal impairment is included in section 4.4. Given the limited clinical safety data, this is 
endorsed. Furthermore, administration of remdesivir is not recommended in patients with eGFR <30 mL/min 
unless the potential benefit of therapy outweighs the potential risk as the excipient betadex sulfobutyl ether 
sodium is renally cleared and accumulates in patients with decreased renal function, which may potentially 
adversely affect renal function. The risk of nephrotoxicity has been added to the safety concerns in the RMP. 
This if further discussed in the clinical section. 
Another concern is that the exposures in the repeat-dose toxicity studies were generally low. In the rat 4-
week study, the AUC exposure margins at NOAEL were 0.1/0.2-fold (males/females) for GS-441524, and 
0.2/0.4-fold (males/females) for GS-704277. In the cynomolgus monkey study, the AUC exposure margins 
at NOAEL were 0.8-fold for remdesivir, 0.9-fold for GS-441524, and 1.8-fold for GS-704277. Thus, the 
repeat-dose toxicity studies cannot inform on potential risks (than kidney toxicity) that could occur in a 
clinical situation where exposure increases above the intended range (e.g. due to kidney or liver failure, an 
accidental overdose etc). 
A complete reproductive and development toxicity program in rats and rabbits has been completed with no 
apparent findings other than adverse findings in female rats in the fertility and early embryonic development 
study. In this study, there were no effects on female reproductive performance (mating, fertility and 
conception) at any dose level. However, a significant reduction in number of corpora lutea, implantation sites 
and viable embryos, and lower mean ovary and uterus/cervix/oviduct weights were observed at the highest 
dose, 10 mg/kg/day. The Applicant is of the opinion that these adverse findings are consequences of 
stress/maternal toxicity. It is agreed that maternal toxicity was evident at this dose level. Lower mean body 
weight gains or body weight loss were noted during the pre-mating treatment period resulting in a 5.4% 
lower mean body weight on Day 27. At this dose level, lower mean maternal body weight gains were also 
noted during the gestation treatment period (GD 0-7). Food consumption was reduced accordingly. It is also 
agreed that the female reproductive system is sensitive to the stress associated with decreased food intake 
and/or decreased body weights. However, the most sensitive reproductive parameter is disturbance of the 
estrous cycle where no significant effect was noted. In addition, in the repeat-dose studies, there were no 
apparent findings (other than decreased body weights) indicating a significant stress response. Taken 
together, it cannot be agreed that the data are solid enough to conclude that the adverse effects in female 
rats are consequences of maternal stress and not human relevant as argued by the Applicant.

EMA/357513/2020

In the rat fertility and early embryonic development study, the AUC exposure margins at NOAEL were 
1.9/0.2-fold (males/females) for GS-441524, and 4.7/0.4-fold (males/females) for GS-704277. In the 
embryo-foetal development studies, the AUC exposure margins at NOAEL were 1.8-fold (rabbits) for 
remdesivir, 3.9/4-fold (rats/rabbits) for GS-441524 and 7.4/25-fold ((rats/rabbits) for GS-704277. In the rat 
pre- and postnatal development study, the AUC exposure margins at NOAEL were 1-fold for GS-441524, and 
2.6-fold for GS-704277.  
An overall concern regarding the reproductive toxicity package is that exposures to remdesivir as well as to 
the two plasma metabolites GS-441524 and GS-704277 are generally low in comparison to the clinical 
exposure. As previously discussed (see above), it is also unknown if the active intracellular GS-443902 and 
the human unidentified major metabolite M27 are formed in rat and/or rabbits. Given these limitations and 
uncertainties, the overall conclusion is that the reproductive toxicity package is currently regarded as limited 
and SmPC sections 4.6 and 5.3 are updated accordingly).  
The results of the 2D hepatocyte model indicate, that RDV appears to be more toxic to human than rat and 
monkey primary hepatocytes and that major metabolites GS-704277 and GS-441524 display a reduced 
toxicity as compared to RDV. The results of the 3D hepatocyte model do not completely resemble these 
findings. In conclusion, the data from hepatocyte (2D and 3D) models do not allow to draw a final conclusion 
on the impact of each compound (RDV and/or metabolite) on observed human liver findings. 
A final conclusion on potential risk of remdesivir to the environment based on the available data cannot be 
drawn right now.  
A list of recommendations has been issued to further address these points post-approval.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The only identified target organ of toxicity in non- clinical studies is the kidney. Kidney findings are described 
in SmPC section 5.3 and a warning for renal impairment is included in section 4.4.   
In addition, the uncertainties in the human relevance of the reproductive toxicity package are handled by a 
strict SmPC labelling.  
Finally, to characterise better the risk of hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity (in addition to the non-clinical 
data), both have been included in the RMP as safety concerns. Moreover, the applicant will submit an 
integrated analysis of all available safety data from clinical trials investigating COVID-19. 
Another issue in the non-clinical dossier is the lack of data on the unknown major human metabolite 
observed in the clinical mass balance study (M27, see section 2.3.1). Until M27 is identified, it is unclear if 
this metabolite has been adequately qualified or if further non-clinical testing is warranted. From a 
metabolism perspective, there are also unclarities on the relevance of the animal species used in the 
reproductive toxicity package. Taking into account  the emergency of the situation due to the pandemic, that 
the overall safety database available indicates a beneficial AE profile and that more data will be provided by 
the applicant post-approval (see list recommendations below), this point is considered acceptable at the 
moment pending further data. 
With regards to the missing ERA studies and data, the CHMP made some recommendations to further 
address this issue (see above, ERA discussion and list below). 
Considering the points discussed above, in the context of the obligation of the applicant to take due account 
of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP recommends the following points to be addressed: 
a.  The clinical mass balance study indicates presence of an unidentified major and possible 
human-specific metabolite M27 in plasma. It is expected that the applicant will address 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020 
Page 46/199 
 
 
  
 
whether this metabolite has been adequately covered in the nonclinical safety studies.   
b.  No studies on intracellular formation of GS-443902 was presented in the rat or the rabbit. 
Based on the high plasma esterase activity and the low half-life of remdesivir observed in the 
rat, it is unclear if the active GS-443902 is formed at all in rats. It is also unclear if the active 
metabolite GS-443902 is formed in rabbits. To resolve this unclarity, the applicant is asked 
to provide data on intracellular formation of GS-443902 in rats and rabbits.  
Additional non-clinical studies to address the identified uncertainties should be considered. 
c.  The applicant is asked to recalculate the Fpen, if necessary, once the length of the treatment 
period has been adequately established and reflected accordingly in the SmPC. In addition, 
the prevalence value (as calculated by the applicant as the fraction of confirmed COVID-19 
cases by April 8th, 2020) should be revisited by Q2/2021, taking into account the most 
recent data. If indicated by the recalculated PECsurfacewater, the ERA may need to be further 
updated with a Phase II assessment according to EMA guideline on environmental risk 
assessment (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 1*, June 2006 for both remdesivir and the 
active metabolite GS-441524. 
d.  The applicant is asked to provide suitable information on an experimentally derived n-
octanol/water partition coefficient (log Kow) for GS-441524 and the full study report for 
remdesivir in order to assess their PBT potential. The log kow studies requested can be 
submitted as post-marketing measures

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods 
RDV, GS-704277, and GS-441524 were analysed using validated LC-MS/MS methods in formic acid treated 
plasma, urine and semen. Several methods were available in plasma and urine, without cross-validation. A 
method in ammonium formate treated urine was also validated for all three analytes, due to a suspected 
instability of GS-704277 in formic acid treated urine. 
A further method was validated for the analysis of the intracellular concentration of GS-441524 and GS-
443902 in PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells). 
Absorption  
RDV has been developed for IV administration as it has insufficient hepatic stability for oral delivery.  
•  Bioavailability 
Two IV formulations of RDV have been developed (ready-to use solution formulation and lyophilised 
formulation). The absolute bioavailability of both formulations is 100%.  
The proposed clinical regimen for treatment of patients with COVID-19 is a loading dose of RDV 200 mg IV, 
followed by daily doses of 100 mg IV for up to 10 days. This regimen is being evaluated in the 
compassionate use programme and in the ongoing randomised clinical trials in patients with COVID-19. 
The PK of RDV and its metabolites GS-441524, GS-704277 and GS-443902 (pharmacologically active 
triphosphate) after administration of the applied dosing regimen to healthy subjects was examined in study 
GS-US-399-5505.  
In this study, RDV was readily detectable in plasma and reached peak concentrations at the end of infusion. 
The rapid disappearance of RDV (median t1/2 ~ 1 h) was followed by transient exposure to the intermediate 
metabolite GS-704277 (median t1/2 ~ 1.25 h) and more persistent plasma exposure to the nucleoside 
metabolite GS-441524 (median t1/2 ~ 27 h) and the PBMC-associated pharmacologically active metabolite 
GS-443902 (median t1/2 ~ 43 h).  
Peak plasma concentrations of GS-704277 and GS-441524 were observed 0.75 h and 1.5 to 2 h after start 
of the infusion, respectively. AUC and Cmax of the active triphosphate GS-443902 increased from 157 h*µmol 
and 9.8 µmol, respectively at Day 1 to 240 h*µmol and 14.6 µmol, respectively, after multiple dosing of 100 
mg RDV.

Table 3: PK parameter of RDV and its metabolites following single-dose administration of RDV 
200 mg on Day 1 and multiple-dose administration of RDV 100 mg on Day 2-10 in healthy 
subjects (study GS-US-399-5505) 
•  Bioequivalence 
The pharmacokinetics of single doses of 75 mg and 150 mg of both RDV formulations (liquid and lyophilised) 
infused over 2 h were evaluated in healthy subjects in study GS-US-399-1812.  
This study was not powered for formal bioequivalence testing between formulations. However, results show 
that plasma exposures of RDV and its metabolites GS-441524 and GS-704277 were similar between both 
formulations and dose proportional. 
• 
Influence of food 
RDV was developed for intravenous administration and thus, the food effect was not evaluated. 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020

Distribution 
After administration of multiple 100 mg doses, the mean volume of distribution of RDV was approximately 
93L confirming RDV distribution to tissues as observed in preclinical studies.  
RDV has moderate protein binding with a free fraction of 12.1% ± 0.7% in human plasma when tested at a 
final concentration of 2 µM in vitro. Protein binding for the metabolites GS-704277 and GS-441524 was 
about 1 and 2%, respectively.  
The mean whole blood/plasma concentration ratio was of 0.76 ± 0.07 for RDV, while GS-441524 showed 
some association with the cellular fraction with a ratio of 1.19 ± 0.12. The mean blood cell/plasma 
concentration ratio was of 0.42 ± 0.17 for RDV, while GS-441524 had a ratio of 1.46 ± 0.29. 
After a single IV dose of [14C]-RDV in healthy male participants, the blood-to-plasma ratio of [14C]-
radioactivity was 0.68 at 15 minutes from start of infusion and increased over time reaching a ratio of 1.0 at 
5 hours (GS-US-399-4231). 
Elimination 
RDV is extensively metabolised and then primarily eliminated in urine as the nucleoside metabolite GS-
441524. 
Based on the mass balance study (GS-US-399-4231), the mean CL of RDV was 1,171 mL/min and the mean 
renal CL was 128.5 mL /min, indicating that most of its elimination was via the nonrenal route of elimination.  
Most of the dose recovered in the urine was as GS-441524 (48.6%) confirming that CLr was a major 
pathway for elimination of this metabolite. The observed CLr was 151 mL/min for GS-441524 and 164.5 
mL/min for GS-704277. 
After a single 30-minute infusion of [14C]-RDV in healthy participants, the median terminal half-lives of RDV, 
GS-704277, and GS-441524 were approximately 1, approximately 1.3, and 27 h, respectively. 
•  Mass balance 
Study GS-US-399-4231 was a mass-balance study where RDV was administered as a single, IV dose of 
radiolabeled [14C]-RDV in 8 healthy male volunteers. Participants received a single dose of RDV 150 mg 
containing a mixture of both unlabeled and radiolabeled [14C]- RDV via IV infusion over 0.5 hour (in the 
fasted state). Blood samples, urine and faeces were collected up to at least 168 h post-dose. 
The cumulative mean (%CV) recovery of [14C] radioactivity in urine plus faeces was 92.3% (1.83%), with 
74.2% (5.833%) recovered from urine and 18.1% (22.837%) recovered from faeces. The majority of the 
radioactive dose recovery (84.5 %) in the combined matrices was achieved within 96 h post-dose. Mean 
recovery of unchanged prodrug in urine was low (10.3% of dose) and no unchanged prodrug was recovered 
in faeces.  
•  Metabolism 
In the mass-balance study, most of the identified radioactivity in plasma (approximately 44.2%) was 
attributed to [14C]-M15 (GS-441524); 14.2% was attributed to [14C]-RDV and 10.6% to an unknown 
metabolite (M27), that could not be identified due to short retention time and coelution with other matrix 
components. The previously characterized intermediate metabolite, GS-704277, was not observed. 
Additional analysis is ongoing using accelerator mass spectrometry to further inform on the circulating 
species of RDV. 
The predominant species detected in urine were GS-441524 (49%), followed by RDV (10%), GS-704277 
(2.9%) and 6 other metabolites, accounting for 6% of the total radioactive dose (each less than 2%). In 
faeces the main metabolite was [14C]- M14 (desamino-hydroxy- GS-441524 metabolite) (12%), with 0.46% 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020 
Page 52/199 
 
 
  
 
of dose recovered as [14C]- M15 (GS-441524) and the remaining unidentified species accounting for a total 
of 0.84%. 
Remdesivir is a diastereomerically pure substance. No data was provided on inter-conversion. 
The proposed biotransformation pathway of RDV based on study GS-US-399-4231 is shown in the 
figure below: 
Figure 2 Proposed intracellular metabolic pathway of RDV (GS-5734) in humans based on study 
GS-US-399-4231 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality was shown between 3 mg and 225 mg, bracketing the doses proposed for therapy in 
adult COVID-19 patients.  
Consistent with the short half-life, RDV did not accumulate upon daily dosing. The nucleoside analog 
metabolite GS-441524 reached steady-state at Day 4 and the intermediate metabolite GS-704277 at Day 1 
after daily dosing of 150 mg RDV.

Pharmacokinetic data of RDV in adult and paediatric patients with COVID-19 are not available. The applicant 
states that the PK of RDV in healthy adult participants is expected to be generalisable to SARS-CoV-2 
infected patients with normal renal or hepatic function. 
Special populations 
The influence of renal impairment on RDV PK has not been studied yet. 
The influence of hepatic impairment on RDV PK has not been studied yet. A substantial proportion of 
patients with acute Ebola virus disease who received treatment with RDV under the PALM and MEURI 
protocols had moderate to severe liver and renal abnormalities at presentation. No renal or hepatic 
abnormalities were attributed to RDV. 
The effect of gender, race or weight on the PK of RDV has not been examined.  
No PK data in elderly is available. 
The PK of RDV in pediatric patients have not been evaluated. The safety and efficacy of adolescent patients 
(12 years and older) weighing ≥ 40 kg are being evaluated in the ongoing Studies GS-US-540-5773 and GS-
US-540-5774. The proposed posology in adolescent patients ≥ 40 kg is the same as in adults and was based 
on predictions form the developed PBPK model. The disposition of RDV and metabolites is expected to be 
similar in adults and adolescents; thus, the PK in adult patients is expected to be generalizable to 
adolescents. 
PBPK modelling 
A PBPK model was developed to characterize the PK of RDV and the inactive primary circulating nucleoside 
metabolite, GS-441524, in adults. The model was verified based on its ability to describe the mean and 
variability of the adult exposures using data from the RDV Phase 1 program (GS-US-399-1812). The adult 
PBPK model was subsequently used to simulate steady-state paediatric (age range 0–18 yrs) exposures 
(AUCtau), accounting for age-dependent changes in organ volume/size (liver and kidney), esterase 
expression, plasma protein binding, and organ blood flow. 
Objective 
The objective of RDV and GS-441524 PBPK model development was to allow prediction of paediatric 
exposures (AUCtau) from adult data by incorporating the relevant physiologic and mechanistic information. 
PBPK model development 
Model development was based on the adult Phase 1 exposure data in healthy volunteers administered single 
doses of 75 mg RDV IV over 0.5 hr (lyophilized formulation) (GS-US-399-1812). The model was developed 
to estimate the exposure (AUCtau) of RDV and its metabolite, GS-441524.  
The observed, calculated or assumed model parameters that were incorporated and the physicochemical 
properties and information on the PK of each compound included in the model are described in Table 4 .

PBPK model evaluation 
The default SimCYP Normal Healthy Volunteers population model was used for adult exposure predictions. 
Ten trials of N=9 subjects per trial were simulated to match the observed Phase 1 data (GS-US-399-1812). 
The observed and predicted AUCinf of RDV and GS-441524 are depicted in Figure 3 and Figure 4, 
respectively. The developed PBPK model for RDV and GS-441524 adequately reproduces exposure mean and 
variability observed in the Phase 1 adult healthy volunteer population.

Exposure prediction in paediatric patients 
The adult PBPK model was applied to predict paediatric RDV and GS-441524 steady-state exposure after 
multiple daily IV administration of a therapeutic maintenance dose using the Paediatric Population Model in 
SimCYP and accounting for age-dependent changes in organ volume/size, enzyme expression, plasma 
protein binding, blood cell distribution, and organ blood flow. For these simulations, N=12000 subjects (0 to 
18 years of age) were simulated. 
For subjects weighing ≥ 40 kg, the adult dosage regimen was considered appropriate and as such, a loading 
dose of 200 mg RDV IV infused over 0.5 hr on Day 1, followed by daily 100 mg doses of RDV IV infused over 
0.5 hr for 9 days was simulated. For subjects weighing ≥2.5 to < 40 kg, a weight-based regimen consisting 
of a loading dose of 5 mg/kg RDV IV infused over 0.5 hr on Day 1, then daily 2.5 mg/kg RDV IV infused over 
0.5 hr for 9 days was simulated. Model-predicted systemic steady-state exposures (AUCtau) of RDV and GS-
441524 are presented in

The ability of RDV to inhibit CYP enzymes and transporters, as well as its inducing capacity, has been only 
tested in vitro and in-silico. 
An in vivo DDI study with rifampin is planned.  
Due to the likelihood of co-administration of RDV and dexamethasone in severe COVID-19, the potential for 
this interaction was specifically addressed. Members of the Department of Pharmacology at the University of 
Liverpool hosting the well-recognized website: https://covid19-druginteractions.org/  concluded the 
following: “Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically 
significant interaction is unlikely. Remdesivir is a prodrug predominantly metabolised by hydrolase, with 
some involvement (in vitro) of CYPs 2C8, 2D6 and 3A4, and is transported by P-gp. Dexamethasone is a 
moderate inducer of CYP3A4 and P-gp. Induction is dose-dependent and occurs after multiple doses. 
Dexamethasone is unlikely to have a clinically significant effect on remdesivir as remdesivir has a moderate-
high hepatic extraction ratio, and is used for a short duration in the treatment of COVID-19. Dexamethasone 
is a substrate of CYP3A4 and although remdesivir inhibits CYP3A4, due to remdesivir's rapid clearance after 
i.v administration, remdesivir is unlikely to have a significant effect on dexamethasone exposure.” This 
evaluation is supported.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Remdesivir is intracellularly metabolized to form the pharmacologically active nucleoside triphosphate 
metabolite (RDV-TP, GS-443902). Biochemical studies demonstrated that RDV-TP acts as an analog of ATP 
and competes with the natural ATP substrate to selectively inhibit viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases 
(RdRp). The primary mechanism of inhibition is incorporation of RDV-TP into nascent RNA chains by RdRp, 
causing delayed RNA chain termination during the process of viral replication. The coronavirus RdRp of 
SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV were shown to incorporate RDV-TP more efficiently than ATP (based 
on steady-state kinetic parameters for single nucleotide incorporation) with selectivity values of 0.26, 0.32, 
and 0.35, respectively, when compared with ATP. Incorporation of RDV-TP for Coronavirus RdRp was also 
more efficiently than for other viral RdRp such as those from EBOV or RSV. In contrast to classic chain-
terminators, inhibition is not seen immediately following the incorporated RDV-TP. For all three coronavirus 
RdRp complexes, a specific delayed RNA termination at position i+3 was observed. The structural reasons 
for the precise termination event remain to be elucidated.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
In vitro antiviral activity  
The in vitro activity of RDV in human airways epithelial (HAE) cells and other cell lines, as well as its 
selectivity, are described in the table below.

Table 6 In vitro activity of RDV against SARS-CoV-2 in HAE, Vero, and Huh 7 Cells 
Effect of protein binding on antiviral activity has not been investigated.  
Effect of other antiviral agents on the activity of RDV has not been investigated.  
In vitro activity against other viruses  
The in vitro antiviral activity of RDV on other viruses aside from SARS-CoV-2 has been analysed in several 
studies. RDV demonstrated potent antiviral activity for several Ebola viruses and strains (EC50s ranging from 
0.07 to 0.24 µM), Marburg virus (EC50 0.061 µM), Junin virus (EC50 0.47 µM), Lassa virus (1.65 µM), MERS 
(0.52 µM), respiratory syncytial virus A2 (EC50 0.017 µM), HCV 1b (EC50 0.097 µm), HCV 2a (EC50 0.084 
µM). It was found to be only weakly active for human rhinovirus serotype-10 (EC50 2.5 µM). It was not active 
against Chikungunya virus and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (EC50 >20 µM) as well as HIV-1 (EC50 
>50 µM) and HBV (EC50 similar to CC50).  
Viral drug resistance 
The in vitro development of resistance to RDV in CoVs has been assessed by cell culture passaging of Murine 
Hepatitis Virus (MHV), a related animal CoV, in the presence of the RDV nucleoside analogue GS-441524. 
After 23 passages, two mutations were selected: F476L and V553L, which reside within the predicted fingers 
domain of the conserved right-hand structure of the RdRp. Further studies are considered necessary to 
better characterise the resistance profile of RDV in vitro, i.e. primary HAE cells infected with SARS-CoV2 and 
in SARS-CoV2 clinical isolates.  
Introduction of the MHV resistance mutations into the corresponding residues of SARS-CoV polymerase 
(F480L and V557L) resulted in the same in vitro susceptibility changes (6-fold reduced susceptibility to 
RDV), suggesting that the conserved residues across divergent CoVs reflect conserved functions impaired by 
RDV, potentially implying common pathways to resistance across CoVs.  
Pc-540-2006: Genetic Conservation of RNA-Dependent-RNA Polymerase of SARS-CoV-2 in Patient 
Isolates 
The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the human population worldwide may result in viral diversification from 
the original common ancestor. These circulating clinical isolates could possibly include Amino acid 
substitutions positions that were previously shown to be associated with reduced susceptibility to RDV in 
vitro (SARS-CoV-2 positions F480 and V557) or other nsp12 amino acid residues that are predicted to be in 
close proximity to the binding site of RDV.  
SARS-CoV-2 full genome sequences of 1993 clinical isolates from 52 countries collected between December 
2019 and March 2020, were downloaded from public databases and compared to the references strain 
Wuhan-Hu-1 viral isolate (NC_ 045512).  
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020 
Page 63/199 
 
 
  
 
 
Sequence alignments demonstrate that nsp12 of SARS-CoV-2 reference strain (Wuhan-Hu-1 viral isolate, 
NC_ 045512) exhibits 96% sequence identity with SARS-CoV, 71% with MERS-CoV, and 66% with MHV. The 
nsp12 amino acid substitutions in MHV nsp12 F476 and V553 associated with reduced susceptibility to RDV 
were identified to correspond to F480 and V557 SARS-CoV-2 nsp12, respectively and are conserved across 
all coronaviruses.  Among n=1993 SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates from December 2019 to March 2020 
obtained from 52 countries, no amino acid substitutions were detected at the nsp12 residues F480 and V557 
that are associated with reduced susceptibility to RDV in vitro. This observation suggests a low probability of 
pre-existence resistance to RDV among circulating clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2. 
Residues located in close proximity to the binding site of RDV were identified from a model of an elongating 
SARS-CoV-2 RdRp complex as previously described (PC-540-2005). This model was used to identify amino 
acids in nsp12 that directly interact with the metal ions or RDV-TP or may contribute to the inhibitor’s 
delayed chain termination. No amino acid substitutions were observed at any of the identified residues in 
nsp12 that directly interact with the metal ions or RDV-TP or may contribute to the inhibitor’s delayed chain 
termination. Furthermore, a larger set of residues were also considered that are located within 5Å and 10Å 
from the active site and residues that are located within 7Å of the primer RNA C1’ positions. One substitution 
(A547V) within 10 Å of the active site was identified in one sequence of the 1993 clinical isolates 
investigated. 
Other amino acid substitutions within nsp12 and the overall genetic drift across full genome sequences at 
the nucleotide level were evaluated. Amino acid substitutions in nsp12 were observed at other residues in 
874/1993 (44%) clinical isolates. The most prevalent nsp12 substitution was P323L, which was observed in 
812/1993 (41%) clinical isolates from 37 of 52 countries. All other variants were observed in less than 1% of 
clinical isolates each.  
In addition, the number of nucleotide changes relative to the reference strain Wuhan-Hu-1 viral isolate (NC_ 
045512) across the full genome for each clinical isolate was calculated. There were on average eight 
nucleotide changes from the reference for 1993 SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates from December 2019 to March 
2020. 
In vivo activity (animal models) 
Rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 disease  
A rhesus macaque model was recently established by Munster et al., 2020 as a potential model of SARS-
CoV-2 infection. Eight rhesus macaques (4 males, 4 females) were inoculated with a total dose of 2.6x106 
TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 via a combination of intratracheal (1.6 × 106 TCID50), intranasal (4 x 105 TCID50), 
ocular (2 x 105 TCID50), and oral (4 x 105 TCID50) routes. The animals were observed twice daily for clinical 
signs of disease using a standardized scoring sheet, as described previously {Brining 2010}. The 
predetermined endpoint for this experiment was 3 days post inoculation (dpi) for one group of 4 animals, 
and 21 dpi for the remaining 4 animals. Clinical exams were performed on 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 17 and 
21 dpi on anaesthetized animals. On exam days, clinical parameters such as bodyweight, body temperature 
and respiration rate, nasal, throat, urogenital and rectal swabs, and blood were collected as well as ventro-
dorsal and lateral chest radiographs. 
Rhesus macaques became infected one day post inoculation (dpi) with disease lasting 8-16 days. On day one 
post inoculation (dpi), all animals showed changes in respiratory pattern and piloerection, as reflected in 
their clinical scores. Rhesus macaques became infected one day post inoculation (dpi) with disease lasting 8-
16 days. On day one post inoculation (dpi), all animals showed changes in respiratory pattern and

piloerection, as reflected in their clinical scores. Weight loss was observed in all animals; body temperatures 
spiked on 1 dpi but returned to normal levels thereafter. Under anesthesia, the animals did not show 
increased respiration; however, all animals showed irregular respiration patterns. Radiographs showed 
pulmonary infiltrates in all animals starting on 1 dpi with mild pulmonary infiltration primarily in the lower 
lung lobes. By 3 dpi, progression of mild pulmonary infiltration was noted into other lung lobes although still 
primarily in the caudal lung lobes. 
Serum was analyzed for changes in cytokine and chemokine levels at different time points after inoculation. 
Statistically significant changes were only observed on 1 dpi, with increases in IL1ra, IL6, IL10, IL15, MCP-1, 
MIP-1b, and on 3 dpi a small but statistically significant decrease in TGFα was observed. Although changes 
occurred in the levels of some of these cytokines later after inoculation, these mostly occurred in single 
animals and were thus not statistically significant. 
Virus shedding was highest from the nose; virus could be isolated from swabs collected on 1 and 3 dpi, but 
not thereafter. Viral loads were high in throat swabs immediately after inoculation but were less consistent 
than nose swabs thereafter; in one animal throat swabs were positive on 1 and 10 dpi but not on any of the 
sampling dates in between. One animal showed prolonged shedding of viral RNA in rectal swabs from 7-17 
dpi; infectious virus could not be isolated from these swabs. Urogenital swabs remained negative in all 
animals throughout the study. On 1, 3 and 5 dpi bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) were performed on the 4 
animals in the group euthanized on 21 dpi as a measure of virus replication in the lower respiratory tract. 
High viral loads were detected in BAL fluid in all animals on all three time points; infectious virus could only 
be isolated in BAL fluid collected on 1 and 3 dpi. No viral RNA could be detected in blood throughout the 
study or urine collected at 3 and 21 dpi. 
On 3 dpi, varying degrees of gross lung lesions were observed in all animals. By 21 dpi, gross lesions were 
still visible in the lungs of two of four animals. Additionally, all animals had an increased lung weight:body 
weight ratio, indicative of pulmonary edema.  
Serum was analyzed for the development of IgG against SARS-CoV spike in ELISA. By 10 dpi, all four 
animals had seroconverted to SARS-CoV-2 spike. At 21 dpi ELISA titers ranged between 1600 – 3200 for all 
four animals. Neutralizing responses also started to appear at 10 dpi and ranged from 10 – 60 at 21 dpi. 
Pc-540-2004: Topline report: Evaluation of the Efficacy of Remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 in a 
Rhesus Macaque Model 
The purpose of this study was to characterize the in vivo antiviral activity of remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 
in the rhesus macaque model described above. A topline report with preliminary results was provided. 
Additional analyses are in progress and a full manuscript describing the complete study results will follow 
this topline report. 
Twelve rhesus macaques were randomly assigned to two groups (N=6 [3M/3F] per group). All animals were 
inoculated as described previously with a total dose of 2.6 x 106 TCID50/ml dilution SARS-CoV-2 via 
intranasal (4 x 105 TCID50), oral (4 x 105 TCID50), ocular (2 x 105 TCID50), and intratracheal (1.6 × 106 
TCID50) routes.

Table 7 Design of remdesivir efficacy study against SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus macaques 
The animals were observed twice daily for clinical signs of disease, using a standardized scoring sheet as 
described previously {Brining 2010}.  
The predetermined endpoint for this experiment was 7 dpi. Clinical examinations were performed daily (1, 2, 
3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 dpi) and body weight, respiration rate, nose swabs, throat swabs and rectal swabs were 
collected on anesthetized animals.  
Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was collected on dpi 1, 3, and 7. Dorsal−ventral and lateral chest radiographs 
was collected on dpi 1, 3, 5, and 7. 
After euthanasia at 7 dpi, necropsies were performed. The percentage of gross lung lesions was scored by a 
board-certified veterinary pathologist blinded to the group assignment of the animals. 
Results: 
The preliminary results of the study demonstrated that remdesivir reduced the clinical disease signs in 
SARS-CoV-2-infected rhesus macaques. The model was non-lethal. After inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 on 
day 0, all animals were closely observed for signs of disease, and clinical scores were assigned according to 
a previously determined scoring sheet. All vehicle-treated animals displayed signs of disease, such as 
increased respiration and shortness of breath after inoculation, starting as early as 1 dpi. The clinical scores 
were assessed in blinded fashion and were statistically significantly lower in remdesivir-treated animals than 
in vehicle-treated control animals at 1 to 7 dpi ( 
Figure 7 )

Upon necropsy at 7 dpi, the area of each lung lobe affected by gross lesions was estimated by a board-
certified veterinary pathologist. The Majority of animal treated with remdesivir had no pathological findings, 
only one of six animals had <20% of area affected by gross lesions in the upper and lower parts of the right 
lung lobe. In contrast, gross lung lesions were present in several lung lobes of all the vehicle-treated control 
animals. The total area of the lungs affected by gross lesions was statistically significantly smaller in the 
remdesivir-treated animals than in vehicle-treated control animals. At 3 to 7 dpi, there were statistically 
significantly fewer infiltrates in the lungs of animals treated with remdesivir as compared to vehicle-treated 
control animals.  
At 7 dpi, all animals were euthanized, and respiratory tissues were collected for quantitative analysis of the 
levels of viral RNA by qRT-PCR. Compared to vehicle-treated control animals, remdesivir treatment resulted 
in significantly lower levels of SARS-CoV-2 replication in the lungs, with the average lung viral RNA 2.2 logs 
lower in the combined lung lobes ( 
Figure 8).

Remdesivir-treated animals had only significantly lower viral loads as measured by viral RNA copies in throat 
swabs on 4 dpi compared to vehicle-treated control animals). No difference was observed in bronchoalveolar 
lavage, nose swabs and rectal swabs, except for the nose swabs at 5 dpi where viral load was lower in 
vehicle control compared to remdesivir-treated animals.

still be isolated from the vehicle-treated animals. 
There is also evidence of activity in mice and macaque models of SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov (please see 
below), providing supportive evidence based on similar viral susceptibility and similar pathogenesis. 
Pc-399-2038: A blinded, randomized, vehicle-controlled evaluation of the efficacy of intravenous 
GS-5734 against middle east respiratory syndrome Corona Virus (MERS-CoV) in Rhesus Monkeys  
The objective of this study was to characterize the efficacy of GS-5734 in a non-human primate (rhesus 
macaque) MERS-Co V disease model. The prophylactic efficacy of GS- 5734 administered as intravenous 
slow bolus once daily for seven days beginning one day before virus exposure was tested.  
Each group received vehicle or 10 mg/kg GS-5734 via a daily bolus i.v. injection. 
At DO, all animals were challenged with a target dose of 7 x 106 tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCIDso) of 
MERS-CoV through a combination of intratracheal (4 mL), intranasal (0.5 mL each nostril), oral (1 mL) and 
ocular (1 mL) with MERS-CoV (1x106 TCID5o/mL).  
The primary endpoint for this study was viral load in lung tissue at Day 6 post-infection. Antiviral efficacy 
was measured based on the level of reduction in clinical scores, radiographic lung changes, lung pathology, 
immunohistochemical staining and viral titers in lower and upper respiratory tract tissues in GS-5734-treated 
animals compared to vehicle-treated animals. Clinical scoring and pathology were conducted in a blinded 
fashion to reduced potential bias.

Disease signs in vehicle-treated animals were attributed to MERS-CoV infection. Time weighted average 
clinical scores were significantly higher (p = 0.006, Figure 10) in vehicle-treated animals compared to GS- 
5734-treated animals. All vehicle-treated animals showed signs of respiratory disease such as hunched 
posture and increased respiration rates. These signs were not apparent in GS-5734- treated animals.

mg/kg GS-5734 Clinical scoring is based upon a selected set of parameters designed to assess 
general health of the animals and distress due to MERS-Co V infection 
All vehicle-treated animals showed evidence of lung pathology associated with MERS-CoV infection with 5 
out of 6 animals showing moderate to serious interstitial infiltrates with pathology that localized to both the 
upper and lower lobes of the lung. In contrast, GS-5734- treated animals showed reduced lung pathology 
with three out of the six treated animals showing no evidence of MERS-CoV induced lung injury. The 
remaining animals showed evidence of mild interstitial pulmonary infiltrates localized to the lower lobes of 
the lung. Viral RNA was detected in all respiratory tract tissues in vehicle-treated animals.  
Viral RNA in the lungs was significantly reduced in GS-5734-treated animals compared to vehicle controls. 
Table 8 Lung viral RNA concentrations in MERS-CoV-infected rhesus monkeys treated with vehicle 
or 10 mg/kg GS-5734 
Viral RNA was quantified in nose swabs and throat swabs at Day 1, 3, 5 and 6 post-infection. Differences in 
the time-weighted viral load between vehicle-treated and GS-5734-treated animals were not statistically 
different (p> 0.05, Mann Whitney Test). However, the duration of shedding was reduced in GS-5734- 
treated animals (5/6 animals with negative nasal swab) compared to the vehicle controls (5/6 animals with 
positive nasal swab). Viral RNA was detected in one vehicle-treated animal in the urine at Day 6 post-
infection and no viral RNA was detected in the blood.  
Animals treated with a 10 mg/kg dose of remdesivir displayed changes in serum creatinine and Blood urea 
nitrogen (BUN) suggestive of altered renal function. All animals treated with GS-5734 (CoV144-149) had 
essentially normal pulmonary tissue with no evidence of MERS-Co V associated pathology, compared to the

with MERS-Co V infection. Lesions were characterized as multifocal, mild to marked, interstitial pneumonia 
frequently centered on terminal bronchioles. Histopathology analysis showed evidence of cortical renal 
tubular changes and necrosis of the renal tubular epithelial cells. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Methods 
All analytical methods were adequately validated. For urine and plasma, two bioanalytical methods were 
validated for RDV, GS-704277 and GS-441524. Furthermore, plasma samples of study GS US 399 1954 
were analysed with two different methods, QPS-60-1560 and QPS 60-15117 (switch after run 2). The 
reasons for this is unclear, and no information on a cross-validation was provided. Therefore, the CHMP 
recommended the applicant to provide clarification on these issues. As a consequence, it has been included 
in the list of recommendations that the applicant should address post-approval.  
PBPK model analysis 
The PBPK model is mainly of importance for the paediatric investigation plan regarding dose selection. The 
PK of RDV in paediatric patients have not been evaluated. The safety and efficacy of adolescent patients (12 
years and older) weighing ≥ 40 kg are being evaluated in the ongoing Studies GS-US-540-5773 and GS-US-
540-5774.  
The PBPK model seem to adequately predict the AUC for RDV and GS-441524 in healthy adults receiving 75 
mg/day dose. It is unclear if the model can adequately predict Cmax and Cmin or if the model is able to predict 
exposures at higher doses including the 200 mg loading dose followed by 100 mg/day dosing. Additional 
information is requested to further support the adequacy of the model. 
The assumptions regarding physiochemical properties have been discussed by the applicant. There are 
uncertainties regarding those assumptions, i.e. that CES1 is the primary liver esterase involved in RDV to 
GS-441524 biotransformation but the assumptions are considered adequate at this time. It is agreed that 
the disposition of RDV and metabolites is expected to be similar in adults and adolescents. With adolescent 
population potentially weighing less than adults, the exposure in adolescents may be increased compared to 
adults.  
The applicant has used a PBPK model to predict exposure (AUC) for subjects with different body weight with 
the proposed posology. AUC at steady state is predicted to be slightly higher in 40 kg patients compared to 
70 kg patient but generally within the studied exposure range. Same posology in adolescent ≥40 kg as in 
adults is supported. The additional feedback regarding the PBPK and overall modelling strategy was provided 
by MSWP to PDCO in the PIP. 
C-QT modelling analysis  
The C-QT modelling analysis has generally been conducted according to guideline. The analysis indicates 
that RDV, GS-441524 and GS-704277 do not cause QTcF interval prolongation at the therapeutic exposure 
levels.  
The major limitation of this analysis is that higher exposure levels have not been studied. However, further 
information is requested in addition to a number of other aspects that should be addressed by the Applicant 
post -approval for a comprehensive assessment this modelling analysis.

Absorption  
Although the solution formulation and the lyophilised formulation were not formally bioequivalent in the 
comparison submitted, the results indicate that the two RDV formulations result in comparable plasma 
concentrations. 
Distribution 
The in vitro protein binding and blood distribution studies were conducted in adequate conditions, despite 
the use of only one test concentration. It is thus not known whether the protein binding of RDV is linear at 
physiological concentrations. In the absence of in vivo protein binding data, experimental data of protein 
binding at several physiologically relevant concentrations should be provided post-authorisation, supporting 
the linearity of RDV protein binding at relevant concentrations.  
RDV is moderately bound to plasma proteins, while its metabolites GS-704277 and GS-441524 are not 
bound to plasma proteins. RDV is somewhat excluded from the cellular fraction, while GS-441524 exhibits a 
tendency to associate with the cellular fraction.  
Elimination 
A single dose mass-balance study is sufficient since there are no major dose- or time- dependencies, and the 
results can be extrapolated to the suggested clinical dose. The total recovery of radioactivity was 92% of the 
dose which is above the 90% limit recommended according to the Guideline on interactions and thus 
sufficient. More than 80% of the recovered radioactivity was identified which is also in agreement with the 
recommendations in this guideline. The radiolabel was in a stable position. 
Data indicate that active renal secretion may be involved in particular for RDV but possibly also for the 
metabolites. 
The applicant has not sufficiently discussed the involvement of hepatic metabolism in the metabolism of 
RDV. The applicant should provide a discussion supporting their conclusion that the impact of CYP2C8, 2D6, 
and 3A4 on RDV disposition is expected to be minimal since RDV metabolism is predominantly mediated by 
hydrolase activity. Should the low impact of CYP2C8, 2D6, and 3A4 on RDV disposition be confirmed, the 
corresponding SmPC warning in section 4.5 may be removed.  
Data substantiating that hydrolysis is the primary route of metabolism for RDV must be provided to 
determine the risk of victim interactions. If an enzyme is responsible for more than 25% of the elimination, 
its inhibition should be studied in vivo. CES1 (carboxylesterase 1) is included in the PBPK model, but not 
discussed elsewhere. Information regarding how (which enzymes) and where the different metabolites are 
formed; the risk of clinical interaction and the possible existence of polymorphism should be explored (see 
list of recommendations). 
In the mass balance study, there appears to be a currently unknown major metabolite M27, representing 
10.6% of the drug-related exposure in plasma (and with almost the same exposure as parent drug). This is 
a concern, considering that this metabolite could potentially be a human-specific metabolite. Apart from this, 
around 30% of the radioactivity in plasma is unknown. It is somewhat surprising that the intermediate 
metabolite (GS-704277) was not observed, considering that this metabolite has been measured in plasma 
using LC-MS/MS. The applicant states that additional analysis is ongoing using accelerator mass 
spectrometry to further inform on the circulating species of RDV. The applicant should submit data from 
additional analysis of the circulating species of RDV from the human mass balance study in order to clarify 
the identity of the currently unknown major metabolite M27 and to clarify if any other major metabolites are 
present in plasma. Data on CYP inhibition by the major metabolite M27 is also required, as well as for 
potential additional major metabolites, according to requirements in the Guideline on interactions.

Finally, the applicant should provide data to support that inter-conversion to the other diastereomer does 
not occur in vivo. These aspects are included in the list of recommendations. 
• 
Pharmacokinetics of metabolites 
The main metabolite GS-441524 as well as the intermediate metabolite GS-704277 has been characterized 
in plasma. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell PK parameters of the active triphosphate metabolite GS-
443902 has also been assessed. Plasma RDV exposure as well as intracellular trough concentration of the 
active triphosphate metabolite GS-443902 in PBMCs (compared to data in rhesus monkey) is used to justify 
the suggested clinical dose. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The results of study GS-US-399-1812 indicate dose-proportionality for RDV and the metabolites GS-441524 
and GS-704277 (although the 90% CI for the slope for AUCinf for GS-441524 does not cover 1) in the dose 
range 3 to 225 mg (single dose). Dose-proportionality following multiple-dose administration has not been 
assessed. 
As expected, considering the half-life (around 1 hour), no accumulation was observed for RDV following 
multiple dosing in study GS-US-399-1954, and the PK profile was very similar when comparing day 1 to day 
7 and day 14. The metabolite GS-441524, having a longer terminal half-life of around 25 hours in this study 
(ranged from 13 to 31 hours in the single-dose study GS-US-399-1812), reached steady state by day 4 and 
the accumulation index was 1.9. AUCtau is similar to AUCinf following a 150 mg dose in the single dose study 
GS-US-399-1812 for remdesivir and GS-441524; thus, there are no indications of time-dependency. It is not 
clear why accumulation occurred for the intermediate metabolite GS-704277, since no accumulation would 
be expected considering the short half-life compared to the dosage interval. However, overall, the results do 
not indicate time-dependency. 
In study GS-US-399-5505, the suggested clinical dose regimen for COVID-19 was used (200 mg on day 1 
followed by 100 mg once daily for up to 10 days, administered as a 30 min IV infusion). Since no PK data 
from patients are available, this is the only study investigating the exposure following the suggested clinical 
dose of RDV. In absence of patient data, data from this study are relevant in order to support dose selection, 
to set cut-offs for in vitro interaction studies and to bridge to preclinical safety data. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Data regarding intra- and inter-subject variability should be presented (see list of recommendations).  
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
The applicant is encouraged to obtain PK data in patients and to further discuss potential differences in 
patients compared to healthy volunteers (see list of recommendations).  
Special populations 
PK of parent drug and active metabolites has not been documented in special populations. Thus, any effect 
of organ dysfunction or demographics on the exposure of RDV and its metabolites is currently unknown. 
The potential involvement of the liver in the metabolism of RDV is currently unknown, which is reflected in 
the SmPC (see SmPC comment). A phase 1 study in subjects with hepatic impairment (without COVID-19) is 
planned and has been included in the pharmacovigilance plan in the RMP. 
Remdesivir is not cleared unchanged in urine to any substantial extent, but its main metabolite GS-441524 
is found in urine and the metabolite levels in plasma may theoretically increase in patients with impaired 
renal function. A phase 1 study in subjects with severe renal impairment and on dialysis is planned and has 
been included in the pharmacovigilance plan in the RMP. Until data are available, the suggested wording in 
the SmPC is generally considered adequate from a pharmacokinetic perspective. 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020 
Page 73/199 
 
 
  
 
The effect of demographic factors (gender, race, age, weight etc.) on the PK of RDV should be investigated.  
It is agreed that the disposition of RDV and metabolites is expected to be similar in adults and adolescents. 
With adolescent population potentially weighing less than adults, the exposure in adolescents may be 
increased compared to adults. The applicant has used a PBPK model to predict exposure (AUC) for subjects 
with different body weight with the proposed posology. AUC at steady state is predicted to be slightly higher 
in 40 kg patients compared to 70 kg patient but generally within the studied exposure range. Same posology 
in adolescent as adults ≥40 kg is supported. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The outstanding interaction issues are regrouped into two RECs, one on the effect of other medicinal 
products on remdesivir, and one on the effect of remdesivir on other medicinal products.  
Missing data 
Data on substantiating that hydrolysis is the primary route of metabolism for RDV must be provided to 
determine the risk of victim interactions. If an enzyme is responsible for more than 25% of the elimination, 
its inhibition should be studied in vivo if possible. CES1 (carboxylesterase 1) is included in the PBPK model. 
Information regarding how (which enzymes) and where (hepatic or non-hepatic) the different metabolites 
are formed; the risk of clinical interactions and the possible existence of polymorphism should be explored.  
No in vitro CYP inhibition data have been provided for the major metabolite M27, or any other currently 
unidentified major metabolite. According to guideline, metabolites with an AUC both larger than one fourth 
of the AUC of parent drug and larger than 10% of the drug-related exposure needs to be investigated for 
CYP inhibition. M27 appears to represent more than 10% of the total radioactivity, thus data is required. If 
any further major metabolites were present in the remaining radioactivity, this would warrant further in vitro 
testing.  
Time-dependent inhibition should be studied for all CYP enzymes. The IC50 with and without preincubation 
should be compared for each enzyme.  
Several transporters have not been studied (inhibition) for RDV: OAT1, OAT3 and OCT2.  
Perpetrator 
Using the day 1 cutoff, RDV is an inhibitor of CYP2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, and 3A4 at clinically relevant 
concentrations. For some of these enzymes, the interactions may be only short-lived, as RDV has a short 
half-life. At the steady state, it is only the inhibition of CYP3A41 that is expected to result in clinically 
relevant interactions. Since CYP inhibition data is incomplete (TDI and major metabolite M27), no final 
conclusion on inhibition can be drawn at the moment. The mechanistic static model is not found applicable 
here, as RDV is both an inhibitor and potentially an inducer of CYP3A4 (see below) and its TDI potential is 
unknown. Therefore, an in vivo study with a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate (midazolam) should be performed to 
investigate the inhibition and the induction of CYP3A4 by RDV. The applicant may also consider 
implementing the aspect of the optimal delay between administration of RDV and sensitive CYP3A4 
substrates in the design of the in vivo study. Appropriate warnings are included in the SmPC until this data is 
available.  
RDV is an inhibitor of UGT 1A1, 1A3, 1A4, 1A9, and 2B7, according to the basic model with the D1 or D5 
cutoff. Nevertheless, none of the potential UGT interactions was found clinically relevant, according to the 
mechanistic static model, where AUCR for UGT1A1 inhibition by RDV was 1.22. This is calculated using the 
initially determined IC50/Ki. The new in vitro experiment however results in a lower IC50 of 1.5 μM. The 
clinical relevance of this signal is nevertheless deemed low, and by extension, the signal of the other UGTs 
that all have a higher IC50. The in vitro UGT inhibition findings should nevertheless be described in section 
5.2 of the SmPC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020 
Page 74/199 
 
 
  
 
In vitro CYP 1A2, 2B6 and 3A4 induction has been observed by either RDV or GS-704277. Since data is 
missing for inhibition of CYPs by M27, it is unclear what the net effect of these potential interactions may be. 
This is adequately covered by a general warning in the SmPC.  
The clinical relevance of induction signals by GS-704277 is considered low, as it is currently not identified as 
a major metabolite, and has a very short half-life in vivo. Furthermore, such data is not required by the GL.  
The in vitro induction assays suffered from a low stability of RDV, and the relevant concentration range was 
not covered in the assay.  
In vitro induction of CYP1A2 was observed for RDV. The applicant argued that this interaction was not 
clinically relevant, based on the mechanistic static model. It was however the theoretical and not the actual 
concentrations that were used in that calculation, which leads to an underestimation of the interaction 
potential due to RDV´s instability. The SmPC therefore contains a warning for the co-administration of 
remdesivir with substrates of CYP1A2 with a narrow therapeutic index that may be at risk of loss of efficacy. 
CYP3A4 induction data by RDV is inconclusive, due to both the instability issue, and the incompleteness of 
donor 3 data. Therefore, the applicant should include the study of CYP3A4 induction in the design of the 
midazolam study that is requested for CYP3A4 inhibition, unless new adequate in vitro data is provided. 
Awaiting these data, a warning for loss of efficacy of sensitive CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic 
index upon co-administration with remdesivir is included int the SmPC.  
RDV is an inhibitor of OATP 1B1 and 1B3 at clinically relevant concentrations. In vivo studies with sensitive 
substrates are required, unless otherwise justified. Appropriate warnings are included in the SmPC until this 
data is available.  
RDV is a weak inhibitor of BSEP at clinically relevant concentrations. 
RDV is an inhibitor of MRP4 at clinically relevant concentrations. To date, no clinically relevant interactions 
via MRP4 inhibition are known, and sensitive substrates in vivo are not available. It is therefore agreed that 
no warning in section 4.5 of the SmPC is warranted. The information is however mentioned in section 5.2.  
Substrate 
The applicant should provide a discussion supporting their conclusion that the impact of CYP2C8, 2D6, and 
3A4 on RDV disposition is expected to be minimal since RDV metabolism is predominantly mediated by 
hydrolase activity. This is required in order to understand the relevance of these pathways and the risk of 
clinically relevant interaction. Should the low impact of CYP2C8, 2D6, and 3A4 on RDV disposition be 
confirmed post-authorisation, the corresponding SmPC warning in section 4.5 may be removed.  
RDV is a substrate of OATP1B1 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp). The applicant has not commented on the extent 
of hepatic metabolism of RDV. Therefore, the risk of interaction is unclear, as is the need for in vivo studies, 
particularly considering that RDV is both a substrate and an inhibitor of OATP1B1. Until this discussion is 
available, a corresponding warning is included in the SmPC. Should post-authorisation the hepatic 
metabolism of RDV be confirmed as low, then warnings for victim interactions via OATP1B1 & PgP 
inhibition/induction may be removed from the SmPC section 4.5 and be mentioned only in section 5.2.  
Furthermore, the results of the DDI study with rifampin should be submitted as soon as they are available.  
Discussion on pharmacodynamics 
Biochemical studies demonstrated that the active triphosphate metabolite of RDV, GS-443902, acts as an 
analogue of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and competes with the natural ATP substrate to selectively inhibit 
viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp). 
Remdesivir inhibited the in vitro replication of SARS-CoV-2 in several cell types, with nanomolar EC50 and 
high selectivity index, indicating that it may serve as a direct acting antiviral in vivo. Due to the sequence 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020 
Page 75/199 
 
 
  
 
homologies of the polymerases, in vitro activity against SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov data are considered 
supportive. 
An EC50 of 0.0099 μM by RDV was shown for a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 in primary HAE cells. The 
applicant points out that comparable inhibition had been previously reported for SARS-CoV with an EC50 of 
0,069 µM, using the same experimental set-up, but with HAE cells derived from a different donor. The 
results indicate potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by RDV and are considered promising. Nonetheless, the 
database is rather limited. Besides, variability is anticipated for primary HAE cultures derived from individual 
donors. Therefore, confirmation by replicate investigations using primary HAE cells derived from another 
donor would add valuable data.  
Another study performed in Vero cells infected with a clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolate showed inhibition by RDV 
with EC50 0,137 µM and 0,750 µM (after 24 and 48 hours, respectively). In principle, these data re-affirm 
study results discussed above, however information on the study methods is limited and partly inconsistent.   
Further results of an EC50 around 0,0035 µM in Huh7 cells infected with a recombinant infectious virus 
construct (containing the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase gene, nsp12, inserted into the backbone of a recombinant 
luciferase-expressing SARS-CoV) also add valuable information on RDV antiviral activity. 
Additional studies on antiviral activity of RDV or GS-466547 against MERS and SARS virus also support the 
proposed mechanisms of action. 
In vitro data provided and discussed above on the antiviral activity of RDV comprise analysis in HAE cells, 
Vero cells, and Huh7 cells. To further substantiate information already obtained, it is considered of value to 
analyse antiviral activity of RDV in potential SARS-CoV-2 target cells expressing the ACE2 receptor and 
TMPRSS2 serine protease (e.g. Calu-3 (human lung epithelial cell), CaCo2 (colorectal epithelial cells), and 
U251 (glioblastoma cells)).  
The amount of serum protein binding on RDV has been analysed, the mean free fraction in human plasma 
was 12.1%. Nevertheless, the impact of serum protein binding on antiviral activity has not been addressed. 
The Committee has issued a recommendation to address this point. 
No analyses have been performed on the influence of other antiviral agents on the activity of RDV. In case of 
SARS-CoV-2 patients with pre-existing HIV, HBV or HCV infection, which is treated with antivirals, effect of 
these antivirals on RDV should be determined. These analyses should be explored.  
Among circulating clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2, no amino acid substitutions were observed at the highly 
conserved nsp12 amino acid residues F480 and V557 previously shown to be associated with reduced 
susceptibility of coronaviruses to RDV in vitro or for any other residues that directly interact with the metal 
ions or RDV-TP or may contribute to the inhibitor’s delayed chain termination. However, one substitution 
(A547V) was detected within 10 Å of the active site. It is important to note, that this study did not provide 
any information about development of resistance to RDV in patients receiving remdesivir treatment. Thus, 
no information about on-treatment development of resistance is available at the moment. The applicant 
should address this issue in the near future, to characterise the resistance profile of RDV. This is important, 
due to the observed increasing genetic drift of SARS-CoV-2 and the associated risk of substitutions that may 
be potentially associated with reduced susceptibility to RDV.  
In general, three substitutions were identified, A574V, P323L and A97V.  New data indicate the presence of 
at least three genetically and geographically distinct clusters of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes (Forster et al., 
PNAS, 2020). The emergent clusters have been found to be associated with signature structural changes in 
specific viral proteins, including a substitution P323L in RdRp (Bhowmik et al, preprint, bioRxiv). This 
substitution is hypothesized to rigidify the RdRp structure and potentially influence the replication of the viral 
RNA (Begum, 2020, preprint biorxiv). Substitution P323L, which was detected in more than 41% of the 
tested clinical isolates, seems to be quite frequent in clinical isolates collected in Europe, while A97V was

EMA/357513/2020 
Page 76/199 
 
 
  
 
detected more often in the Asian-pacific region. Thus, it seems that there might be different geographic 
distribution of viral strains. Further discussion should be provided by the applicant regarding the different 
geographic distribution of viral strains during the pandemic, taking current knowledge of variants A, B and C 
(https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2004999117) . Furthermore, the substitutions A574V, A97V and P323L 
should be analysed for their susceptibility to RDV preferably in HAE cells, using different clinical isolates, i.e. 
variants A, B and C to evaluate the effect of this signature mutations on RDV susceptibility. 
Mice are not suitable for evaluation of remdesivir in SARS-CoV-2 due to high levels of esterase activity that 
rapidly degrade the prodrug. In addition, knockout mice that do not degrade remdesivir rapidly lack 
expression of the human ACE2 receptor required for infection and are thus not a suitable model for SARS-
CoV-2 (Zhou et al. BiorXiv 2020). Based on this, the choice of rhesus macaques as non-human primate 
target species for establishing a SARS-CoV-2 disease model seems to be reasonable.  
The rhesus macaque model resembles a moderate COVID-19 disease, thus conclusions from this animal 
model might not be transferable to severe disease. The inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 induced a transient, 
moderate disease in rhesus macaques with signs of infection one day post inoculation (dpi) with disease 
lasting 8-16 days. All animals showed signs of respiratory disease, i.e. changes in respiratory pattern, as 
reflected in their clinical scores, detectable viral RNA in swabs from the nose and throat of all animals as well 
as in bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) and pulmonary infiltrates, a hallmark of human disease. However, 
different levels of pulmonary involvement with regard to infiltrates on x-ray and the presence of lung lesions 
on 3 dpi were observed”  
The duration of disease in rhesus macaques seems to be very short with differences also in incubation times, 
compared to the disease in humans. In addition, differences observed in pulmonary involvement, duration of 
viremia, serological and immunological responses might impact the validity of this animal disease model for 
SARS-CoV-2 in humans. 
A topline report with preliminary results of the study that evaluated the efficacy of remdesivir against SARS-
CoV-2 in a non-lethal Rhesus Macaque Model was submitted. Additional analyses are in progress and a full 
manuscript describing the complete study results will follow this topline report.  
The NIH study in rhesus macaques is currently the most advanced animal model for COVID-19. However, as 
discussed above, the model is based on an initial study, evaluating a limited number of rhesus macaques 
(N=8) and does not seem to capture all human disease characteristics. Based on current staging 
approaches, the rhesus macaque model does recapitulate moderate Phase IIA, where markers of systemic 
infections, i.e. cytokines and chemokines, are not regularly elevated (Siddiqi, 2020).  
 One of the uncertainties includes the relevance of the animal models for human COVID-19, as well as the 
fact that RDV was administered only 12 hours after viral challenge in the animal model. Considering that in 
the established model, the first evaluation of clinical symptoms was done at 1 dpi, it remains unclear, if the 
animals already developed COVID-19 symptoms when they received RDV. This is not reflective of the 
currently studied use of remdesivir in COVID—19 patients, where first administration is unusual before day 4 
of symptom onset. Thus, animals in this model may not be representative for the clinical status of patients 
that will receive RDV in clinical practice, as it rather reflects a prophylactic or post-exposure than a 
therapeutic approach. 
The preliminary results indicate that in this model RDV only has an impact on clinical aspects (e.g., active in 
reducing the amount of lesions in the lung). The data on antiviral effects are equivocal. No effect of viral 
levels in upper respiratory tract was shown. Considering that RDV is supposed to be a direct acting antiviral, 
an antiviral effect would have been anticipated.   
Mouse and rhesus macaque models of SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov are supportive of the hypothesis of efficacy. 
However, no in vivo studies have been conducted in animal models of any coronavirus infection where 
treatment was initiated later than one day after viral inoculation.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The available pharmacokinetic documentation consists of studies mainly aiming at describing the general 
pharmacokinetic properties of RDV and its metabolites in healthy volunteers. One main issue is the presence 
of a currently unknown major human metabolite as it was previously discussed. 
No PK data in patients is available, and the effect of intrinsic factors, including the effect of organ 
dysfunction and the effect of demographics on the PK of RDV has not been examined.  
In vitro antiviral activity of RDV against SARS-CoV-2 has been shown in primary HAE cells (EC50 of 0.0099 
μM).  
The resistance profile of RDV to date is considered incompletely characterized in vitro and in vivo. New data 
indicate the presence of geographically distinct clusters of viral strains, with signature structural changes in 
specific viral proteins. The observed increasing genetic drift of SARS-CoV-2, evolving viral diversity and 
different geographic distribution of virus strains might have a substantial effect on the remdesivir efficacy, 
highlighting the importance to further characterise the resistance profile of RDV.  
As discussed, one of the uncertainties includes the relevance of the animal models for human COVID-19, as 
well as the fact that RDV was administered only 12 hours after viral challenge in the animal model.  
Overall, in vitro and preclinical in vivo data support the hypothesis that RDV may provide benefit in COVID-
19. However, the currently available data on antiviral effects are limited.  Further data on the antiviral 
activity in vitro and in vivo are needed to support the classification of remdesivir as a direct acting antiviral 
and its efficacy on circulating viral strains. 
A number of issues need to be resolved post-approval (see list of RECs and addition of RI and HI study in 
RMP). There are no in vivo studies regarding interactions and several issues are raised regarding the in vitro 
interaction studies performed and the possible in vivo consequences of these findings. These requirements 
are not considered to preclude approval as appropriate warnings are included in the SmPC but constitute two 
different RECs.  
In conclusion, from a pharmacology point of view, a conditional marketing authorisation application is 
acceptable. Certain aspects should be further studied and provided after approval by the applicant 
considering the discussion above and the recommendations that the Committee agreed. In addition, 
appropriate warnings have been included in the SmPC. Some of these warnings could be removed once more 
information becomes available. 
Recommendations for future and ongoing development: 
Pharmacology: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The applicant should submit data from additional analysis of the circulating species of RDV from the 
human mass balance study in order to clarify the identity of the currently unknown major metabolite 
M27 and to clarify if any other major metabolites are present in plasma. Data on CYP inhibition by 
the major metabolite M27 should be also considered, as well as for potential additional major 
metabolites, according to requirements in the Guideline on interactions. 
The applicant should provide data to support that inter-conversion to the other diastereomer does 
not occur in vivo. 
The applicant is encouraged to obtain PK data in patients and to discuss potential differences in 
patients compared to healthy volunteers. The effect of demographic factors (gender, race, age, 
weight etc.) on the PK of RDV should also be investigated. Data regarding intra- and inter-subject 
variability should also be presented. 
Information on GCP inspections of the bioanalytical site (QPS, LLC (Newark, US)) should be provided

• 
Effect of other medicinal products on remdesivir: 
a.  Data substantiating that hydrolysis is the primary route of metabolism for remdesivir must 
be provided to determine the risk of victim interactions. If an enzyme is responsible for more 
than 25% of the elimination, its inhibition should be studied in vivo if possible. CES1 
(carboxylesterase 1) is included in the PBPK model, but not discussed elsewhere. 
Information regarding how (which enzymes) and where (hepatic or non-hepatic) the 
different metabolites are formed; the risk of clinical interactions and the possible existence of 
polymorphism should be explored. 
b.  The applicant should provide a discussion supporting their conclusion that the impact of 
CYP2C8, 2D6, and 3A4 on remdesivir disposition is expected to be minimal since remdesivir 
metabolism is predominantly mediated by hydrolase activity. This may be particularly 
relevant in the case of co-administration with the CYP3A4 inducer dexamethasone. Should 
the low impact of CYP2C8, 2D6, and 3A4 on remdesivir disposition be confirmed, the 
corresponding SmPC warning in section 4.5 may be removed.  
c.  Should the hepatic metabolism of remdesivir be confirmed as low, then warnings for victim 
interactions via OATP1B1 & PgP inhibition/induction may be removed from the SmPC section 
4.5 and be mentioned only in section 5.2.  
d.  In studies AD-399-2007 and AD-399-2008, the investigation of RDV as substrate of 
transporters was carried out using a single concentration. According to appendix 3 of the 
interaction GL, at least four concentrations covering 100-fold difference in concentration 
should be studied. No information on saturation of the transporters at the studied 
concentration is available. The applicant should discuss and motivate the use of a single 
concentration. Unless adequate justifications are provided, the studies would need to be 
redone under conditions following the GL 
• 
Effect of remdesivir on other medicinal products:  
a.  An in vivo study with a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate (midazolam) should be performed to 
investigate the inhibition of CYP3A4 by RDV. The induction of CYP3A4 by RDV should be 
studied in vivo as well, unless new adequate in vitro data is provided, with sufficient RDV 
actual concentration. The SmPC warning in section 4.5 may be removed if these studies 
show negative results. The applicant may also consider implementing the aspect of the 
optimal delay between administration of RDV and sensitive CYP3A4 substrates in the design 
of the in vivo study. 
b.  RDV is an inhibitor of OATP 1B1 and 1B3 at clinically relevant concentrations. In vivo studies 
with sensitive substrates are required, unless otherwise justified. 
c.  Time-dependent inhibition was investigated with at a single concentration. The difference in 
remaining activity between incubation with and without NADPH shows the difference 
between inhibitory effects by the parent and possible metabolites and is not the relevant 
output for the study of TDI. The IC50 with and without preincubation should be compared for 
each enzyme for RDV. The choice of probe substrate (CYP2D6) and control inhibitor (2C8, 
2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A4) should be justified. For metabolites, this data is not expressly required 
by the GL. 
d.  In vitro-studies investigating the effect of RDV as inhibitor of the following transporters 
should be submitted: OAT1, OAT3 and OCT2. 
e.  Unless adequate justifications are provided, the following studies would need to be redone 
with acceptable substrates and controls:

EMA/357513/2020

i.  CYP inhibition (AD-540-2004 and AD-540-2013): the selected enzyme marker 
reactions are in line with the GL, except for CYP2C9 and CYP2D6. While the choice of 
reaction may be acceptable, this requires justification. The same holds true for 
control inhibitors, where those used for CYP 1A2 and 2C19 differ from the GL. 
ii.  UGT inhibition: The design of study AD-540-2015 is acceptable. The choice of probe 
substrate and control inhibitor should be justified. 
iii.  Transporter assays: The applicant should justify the choice of probe substrate and 
positive control and their respective concentrations, where applicable. The applicant 
should also comment on the lack of information on non-specific binding and cell 
viability in the experiments involving cells for those studies where this information 
was missing [non-specific binding: all; cell viability: AD-399-2029, AD-399-2007, 
AD-399-2008]. 
•  DDI study with rifampicin: The results of the DDI study with rifampin should be submitted as soon as 
they are available. 
• 
• 
In the absence of in vivo protein binding data, experimental data of protein binding at several 
physiologically relevant concentrations should be provided, supporting the linearity of RDV protein 
binding at relevant concentrations. 
For urine and plasma two bioanalytical methods were validated for RDV and GS-441524. The reason 
for this is unclear. Furthermore, plasma samples of studies GS-US-399-1954 and GS-US-399-1812 
were analysed with two different methods, QPS-60-1560 and QPS 60-15117. The reason for this is 
unclear, and no information on a cross-validation is provided. The applicant should provide 
clarification on these issues and should discuss if this could have an impact on the comparability of 
results (e.g. in study GS-US-399-1812 between cohorts and formulations). Unless it can be 
motivated that no cross-validation is required, such a cross-validation should be provided. 
Pharmacodynamics: 
•  Analysis of antiviral activity using additional cells and clinical isolates; analysis of influence of other 
antiviral agents on RDV activity; provision of missing data. 
•  Analysis of antiviral activity of RDV to clinical isolates of circulating viral strains from different 
geographical regions, i.e. clinical isolates with substitutions P323L, A97V and A574V. 
•  Genotypic and phenotypic resistance analysis of clinical isolates from patients receiving RDV 
treatment.

• 
Further information on the establishment of the Rhesus macaque models should be provided, 
including the study report and a discussion of the validity of the animal disease model for SARS-CoV-
2 in humans 
Further data on study PC-540-2004 should be provided, including the final study report of study PC-
540-2004. 
•  Study report of evaluating the prophylactic and therapeutic administration of RDV in a rhesus 
macaques model of MERS-CoV should be provided. 
• 
The dose used to build the C-QT model is only 1.5-fold the proposed therapeutic maintenance dose 
(100mg) and 0.75-fold the proposed therapeutic loading dose (200mg). According to Garnett et al. 
2018 higher doses leading to at least twice as high Cmax concentrations as with the therapeutic 
doses (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.21.001628) should be investigated for appropriate C-QT 
analysis:

a.  The Applicant should include additional data for the highest investigated doses if PK and 
corresponding QT data are available. And if this is not feasible the Applicant is requested to 
critically discuss how this concern will be addressed. 
b.  Some figures for the C-QT modelling are missing/were not found and should be provided. 
c.  A figure of observed vs predicted ∆∆QTcF should be provided. 
d.  C-QTc plot (∆∆QT on y-axis, concentration on x-axis) of observed data overlaid with the 
model prediction (including confidence interval) should be provided.  
e.  The applicant should provide predictions from the C-QT model resulting from the mean 
concentrations observed in study 399-1954.  
f.  As an additional sensitivity analysis, a C-QT model that corresponds to the final model but 
omits altogether the RDV concentration and that of both metabolites should also be 
employed in order to evaluate the full treatment effect on its own avoiding post-
randomisation covariates.  
g.  The applicant should provide bootstrap confidence intervals for the C-QT model for which the 
procedure includes model building, i.e. model building steps 2-4 should be performed for 
each bootstrap sample resulting potentially in different final models for the different 
bootstrap samples.  
h.  As sample sizes were small for the C-QT analysis, the applicant should provide reassurance 
that coverage probability of the derived bootstrap confidence intervals is acceptable.  
i.  With respect to the bootstrap resampling for the C-QT analysis it should be clarified how 
stratification within visits was conducted and how this could be done when taking subject 
identifier as the unit of resampling. An additional analysis without stratification according to 
visit should be presented.  
j.  The Applicant should provide the SAP including the software and the dataset used for the C-
QT analysis (and the updated dataset including data on higher doses).

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
No dedicated dose-finding study in humans has been conducted. Selection of this dosing regimen is based on 
the PK bridge from animal data to human doses and efficacy using the results of in vivo efficacy studies 
conducted in SARS-CoV-2- and MERSCoV-infected rhesus monkeys, and available PK data in healthy rhesus 
monkeys and Phase 1 studies in healthy participants.  
PK bridge between animal models and humans and relevance for dose selection 
The basis for a PK bridge from animal data to human doses and efficacy is based on the results of studies 
conducted in healthy and MERS-infected rhesus monkeys and PK data from Phase 1 studies in healthy 
volunteers. 
For the treatment of COVID-19, the dose has been selected to target exposures (plasma and PBMC) 
associated with efficacy at 10 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg, respectively, in the MERS-infected rhesus monkeys. This 
results in a dosing regimen (based on allometric scaling) that requires a 200 mg loading dose followed by 9 
days of 100 mg once daily. 
Available PK (plasma and PBMC) data illustrating comparable PK across species are described below. 
The pharmacokinetics of 5 mg/kg daily dose (7 days) in rhesus monkeys (Study AD-399-2030) and a repeat 
doses of 100 mg (5 to 10 days) in healthy adult human volunteers (Study GS-US-399-5505), both 
administered as 30-min IV infusion revealed, that at these doses, similar systemic plasma exposures of RDV 
was achieved in both species. Additionally, the intracellular exposures of the active nucleoside triphosphate 
metabolite GS-443902 observed in rhesus monkey PBMCs receiving 5 mg/kg daily dose (7 days) were 
comparable to concentrations achieved in human PBMCS on administration of repeat doses of 100 mg RDV. 
Table 9: Pharmacokinetics of RDV in Plasma and Nucleoside Triphosphate Metabolite GS-443902 
(PBMCs) following Repeat RDV Doses (30-minute IV Infusion) to Healthy Rhesus Monkeys (5 
mg/kg) and Healthy Humans (100mg) 
In humans, RDV exhibits dose proportionality in its PK at doses from 3 mg to 225 mg (Study GS-US-399-
1812). In rhesus monkeys, dose proportional increases in RDV plasma exposure were seen across 3 mg/kg 
and 10 mg/kg (AD-399-2002 and AD-399-2022, respectively). 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020 
Page 82/199 
 
 
  
 
 
A loading dose of 200 mg in humans is required to target efficacy at the 10 mg/kg loading dose in MERS 
infected rhesus monkeys. PK (plasma and PBMC) of a single dose of 200 mg RDV in healthy volunteers has 
been examined and compared to values expected (due to dose proportionality) with 10 mg/kg in rhesus 
monkeys based on available data at 5 mg/kg. 
Table 10: Pharmacokinetics of Plasma RDV and Nucleoside Triphosphate Metabolite GS-443902 
(PBMCs) following a 200 mg Single Dose of RDV to Healthy Volunteers 
Plasma RDV exposure following a 200 mg single dose (2862.5 h*ng/mL) is similar to the expected exposure 
in rhesus monkeys; i.e., 2 x 1430 h*ng. Additionally, trough (C24h) PBMC concentrations of nucleoside 
triphosphate metabolite GS-443902 following a 200 mg dose are comparable to values seen in rhesus 
monkeys. 
Given the emergency situation due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with urgent need for causal therapies and 
the safety data available from studies in Ebola Virus disease, this approach was deemed acceptable. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
NIAID ACTT(1):  A Multicenter, Adaptive, Randomized Blinded Controlled Trial of the 
Safety and Efficacy of Investigational Therapeutics for the Treatment of COVID-19 in 
Hospitalized Adults. (Study code: CO-US-540-5776) 
Methods 
This study is an adaptive, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of novel therapeutic agents in hospitalized adults diagnosed with COVID-19. The study is a multi-
center trial that will be conducted in up to approximately 60 sites. 
Subjects were randomised 1:1 to placebo or investigational product. 
The study set-up is adaptive in terms of allowing the possibility of introducing new study arms. 
Study participants 
Adults hospitalised with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Illness of any duration, and at least one 
of the following: 
• Radiographic infiltrates by imaging (chest x-ray, CT scan, etc.), OR 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020 
Page 83/199 
 
 
  
 
 
 
• SpO2 ≤ 94% on room air, OR 
• Requiring supplemental oxygen, OR 
• Requiring mechanical ventilation. 
Notable exclusion criteria are ALT/ or AST > 5 times the upper limit of normal or estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 ml/min (including patients receiving hemodialysis. 
Randomisation was stratified by site and by severity of illness at enrolment: 
•  Severe disease: requiring mechanical ventilation, requiring oxygen, a SpO2 ≤ 94% on room air, or 
tachypnoea (respiratory rate ≥ 24 breaths/min). 
•  Mild-moderate disease: SpO2 > 94% and respiratory rate < 24 breaths/min without supplemental 
oxygen. 
Treatments 
Remdesivir (from lyophilized formulation) administered as a 200 mg intravenous (IV) loading dose on Day 1, 
followed by a 100 mg once-daily IV maintenance dose for the duration of the hospitalization up to a 10-day 
total course; or a placebo. 
Rules for concomitant medications 
If the local standard of care per written policies or guidelines for treatment for COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 
infection (i.e., not just an individual clinician decision) includes lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), 
hydroxychloroquine or other agents, (e.g. those targeting the host immune response), then continuing these 
during the study is permitted. If there are no written policies or guidelines for local standard of care, 
concomitant use of any other experimental treatment or off-label use of marketed medications intended as 
specific treatment for COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 infection are prohibited. This includes medications that 
target the host immune response. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The study started 21 Feb 2020. The initial primary endpoint was to compare subject clinical status  
(8-point ordinal scale) at Day 15. The ordinal scale is as follows: 
8. Death; 
7. Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO; 
6. Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices; 
5. Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen; 
4. Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring ongoing medical care (COVID-19 related or 
otherwise); 
3. Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - no longer requiring ongoing medical care; 
2. Not hospitalized, limitation on activities and/or requiring home oxygen; 
1. Not hospitalized, no limitations on activities 
While according to the publication, the decision to change the primary endpoint was already taken on 22 
March 2020, the approval by FDA occurred only late during the trial (mid-April 2020) according to 
clinicaltrials.gov as follows: The primary outcome is time to recovery by Day 29. Day of recovery is defined 
as the first day on which the subject satisfies criterion 1, 2 or 3 on the ordinal scale above.  
Because the primary efficacy endpoint was a time to event endpoint, this trial was powered based on the 
number of patients required to achieve 400 patients meeting recovery criteria. This was planned to provide 
85% power for detecting a hazard ratio of 1.35 (on a scale where values greater than 1.00 corresponded to 
faster recovery in the remdesivir group). The two-sided type I error rate was set at 5%. 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020 
Page 84/199 
 
 
  
 
At the same time as the change of endpoint described above, the sample size estimation was adjusted to be 
572 subjects to achieve 400 subjects with a “recovered” status (per the primary objective). The primary 
analysis was finally based on an intention-to-treat population, including 1059 randomized subjects.  
The original primary endpoint was termed a “key secondary endpoint” at this time. 
Virological investigations 
Oropharyngeal (OP) swabs and plasma and serum were to be collected on Day 1; and Days 3, 5, 8, and 11 
(while hospitalized); and OP swabs and serum on Day 15 and 29 (if attends an in- person visit or still 
hospitalized) and). The protocol states that relevant assays are not developed yet, and the ability to test 
samples at one central lab is not clear. Therefore, while viral load/shedding is thought to be an important 
endpoint, considering the limitations above, it is listed as an exploratory endpoint. 
OP swabs are preferred, but if these are not obtainable, nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs may be substituted.  
Due to limited lack of swabs and other supplies at some sites and limitations on personal protective 
equipment (PPE), the inability to obtain these samples are not considered protocol deviations and should be 
documented in the subject’s record.

As of April 28, 2020, a total of 391 patients in the remdesivir group and 340 in the placebo group had 
completed the trial through day 29, recovered, or died. Eight patients who received remdesivir and 9 who 
received placebo terminated their participation in the trial before day 29. There were 132 patients in the 
remdesivir group and 169 in the placebo group who had not recovered and had not completed the day 29 
follow-up visit.  
The analysis population included 1059 patients for whom we have at least some postbaseline data available 
(538 in the remdesivir group and 521 in the placebo group). Four of the 1063 patients were not included in 
the primary analysis because no postbaseline data were available at the time of the database freeze. 
Conduct of the study 
Enrolment was halted on April 19, 2020 after 1063 patients had been randomized.  
The statistical analysis plan pre-specified an interim analysis to be conducted by the data safety monitoring 
board (DSMB) after 200 of the 400 recoveries had been observed. This meeting was scheduled for April 27, 
2020. However, due to rapid enrolment there had already been over 400 recoveries in the analysis set 
presented to the DSMB at this meeting.  
Because this exceeded the originally planned final number of recoveries in the trial, no interim adjustment to 
significance tests or confidence intervals was applied for the DSMB analysis.  
In summary, it is understood that type 1 error control has been maintained. 
Baseline data 
Baseline demographics were reasonable well balanced between treatment group and strata. 
64% were male; Hispanics/Latinos and African/Afro-American patients made up a proportion of 
approximately 20% each. In total, 117 patients came from centres in the EU (24 moderate; 93 severe).

The study recruited patients with a broad range of ages, with a median of 59 years. Males are over-
represented, similar to the real-life population hospitalised with COVID-19.  
80% of patients were recruited in North America; 15% in Europe and 5% in Asia. 
The median patient is overweight. Nearly half of the patients have hypertension and one quarter of patients 
has type II diabetes, which is representative of common risk factors for severe disease. 
The median duration of disease at randomisation is nine days, with a very wide full range of durations.

Outcomes and estimations 
The below information is based on the publication of Beigel JH et al and two reports for the DSMB (24th and 
28th April 2020).  
As of April 28, 2020, a total of 391 patients in the remdesivir group and 340 in the placebo group had 
completed the trial through day 29, recovered, or died. Eight patients who received remdesivir and 9 who 
received placebo terminated their participation in the trial before day 29. There were 132 patients in the 
remdesivir group (24.4%) and 169 (32.4%) in the placebo group who had not recovered and had not 
completed the day 29 follow-up visit. The analysis population included 1059 patients for whom at least some 
post-baseline data available (538 in the remdesivir group and 521 in the placebo group). 
In the remdesivir arm, 180/538 (33%) participants received 10 doses of remdesivir, while 202/538 (38%) 
participants received <10 doses of remdesivir because of recovery, death or intermittent missed doses 
(31%, 4% and 2%, respectively). 100 participants (19%) were still receiving remdesivir or had missing 
treatment data as of the database freeze on April 28, 2020.  
Of those assigned to receive placebo, 185/521 (36%) participants received 10 doses of placebo, while 
172/521 (33%) participants received < 10 doses because of recovery, death or intermittent missed dose 
(23%, 5% and 5 %, respectively). 108 (21%) participants were still receiving placebo or had missing 
treatment data as of the database freeze.  
Primary outcome 
Preliminary results suggest that the median difference in time to recovery is 4 days favouring the remdesivir 
group In the primary endpoint RDV was superior to placebo in the treatment of hospitalized participants with 
COVID-19. This benefit was also observed in the key secondary endpoint of recovery by the ordinal scale at 
Day 15 (see tables below).  
Notably, the efficacy demonstration was confined to the severe stratum, whereas no effect could be shown 
in the mild-moderate stratum which only recruited approximately 120 patients.

b Ordinal Scale at Day 15 Visit is the participant’s worst ordinal scale score during the previous day. In the remdesivir 
arm, 103 participants did not have ordinal scale scores for the day 15 visit at the time of the data freeze (11 Mild-
Moderate, 92 Severe). In the placebo arm, 109 participants did not have ordinal scale scores for the day 15 visit at the 
time of the data freeze (12 Mild-Moderate, 97 Severe). Note, 2 subjects died 15 days post-randomization and are included 
in the ordinal scale but not in the 14-day mortality estimate. 
c Odds ratio and odds ratio p-values calculated using a proportional odds model. Odds ratio values > 1 indicate benefit for 
remdesivir. P-value and confidence intervals have not been adjusted for multiple comparisons.

† Recovery rate ratios and hazard ratios were calculated from the stratified Cox model; P values for these ratios were 
calculated with the stratified log-rank test. Recovery rate ratios greater than 1 indicate a benefit for remdesivir; hazard 
ratios less than 1 indicate a benefit for remdesivir. 
‡ The ordinal score at day 15 is the patient’s worst score on the ordinal scale during the previous day. In the remdesivir 
group, 103 patients did not have ordinal scale scores for the day 15 visit at the time of the data freeze (11 with mild-to-
moderate illness and 92 with severe illness). In the placebo group, 109 patients did not have ordinal scale scores for the 
day 15 visit at the time of the data freeze (12 with mild-to-moderate illness and 97 with severe illness). Two patients died 
15 days after randomization and are included in the ordinal scale scores but not in the estimate of mortality by day 14.  
Scores on the ordinal scale are as follows: 1, not hospitalized, no limitations of activities; 2, not hospitalized, limitation of 
activities, home oxygen requirement, or both; 3, hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen and no longer requiring 
ongoing medical care (used if hospitalization was extended for infection-control reasons); 4, hospitalized, not requiring 
supplemental oxygen but requiring ongoing medical care (Covid-19–related or other medical conditions); 5, hospitalized, 
requiring any supplemental oxygen; 6, hospitalized, requiring noninvasive ventilation or use of high-flow oxygen devices; 
7, hospitalized, receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); and 8, death.  
Odds ratios and P values were calculated with the use of a proportional odds model. Odds ratio values greater than 1 
indicate a benefit for remdesivir. Source: Beigel et al, NEJM ,2020 
Cumulative recovery estimates are shown in the overall population (Panel A), in patients with a baseline score of 4 on the 
ordinal scale (not receiving oxygen;Panel B), in those with a baseline score of 5 (receiving oxygen; Panel C), in those with 
a baseline score of 6 (receiving high-flow oxygen or noninvasive mechanical ventilation; Panel D), and in those with a 
baseline score of 7 (receiving mechanical ventilation or ECMO; Panel E). 
A key secondary analysis (the primary analysis according to the original protocol) used the proportional odds 
model on the 8-point ordinal scale at Day 15. The odds of improvement in the ordinal scale were higher in 
the RDV group as determined by a proportional odds model at the Day 15 visit when compared to the 
placebo group (OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.91; p = 0.001; n = 844)

Key secondary outcomes  
The Kaplan–Meier estimates of mortality by 14 days reported in the NEJM publication were 7.1% (32/538 
patients) and 11.9% (54/521 patients) in the remdesivir and placebo groups, respectively showing a hazard 
ratio for death of 0.70 (95% CI 0,47 to 1.04). An analysis with adjustment for baseline ordinal score as a 
stratification variable showed a hazard ratio for death of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.50 to 1.10). 
For reliable conclusions on mortality, the final results on 28-day mortality with complete follow-up are 
required.

Study title: A Phase 3 Randomized Study to Evaluate the Safety and Antiviral Activity of 
Remdesivir (GS-5734™) in Participants with Severe COVID-19 (GS-US-540-5773) 
Methods 
This ongoing open-label trial compared 5-day and 10-day remdesivir durations for the treatment of patients 
with severe COVID-19.  
The study has a part A and a part B, with part A constituting the sample for the inferential analysis, and part 
B an expansion cohort with broader inclusion criteria and applying the 10-day RDV regimen only. 
There was no stratification of randomisation. 
Study participants 
Included patients were aged ≥12 years, hospitalised with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR 
testing. Radiographic evidence of pulmonary infiltrates was required or SpO2 ≤94% on room air or 
requirement for supplemental oxygen.  
Exclusion criteria disallowed patients on mechanical ventilation (as of 15 Mach expanded to mechanical 
ventilation for ≥5 days, incl. ECMO), patients with multiorgan failure, ALT or AST >5 times the upper limit of 
normal, or creatinine clearance <50 mL/min. 
The most severely ill patients were excluded from this study. 
Treatments 
Remdesivir (from lyophilized formulation) was administered intravenously at a dose of 200 mg on Day 1 
followed by 100 mg on subsequent five or ten days. There was no placebo or standard of care group. 
Concomitant medications 
Concomitant use of investigational agents such as approved HIV protease inhibitors like lopinavir/ritonavir, 
chloroquine, etc. while receiving RDV was prohibited.

Outcomes/endpoints 
The pre-specified primary efficacy analysis was to examine results on a 7-point (until April 06 on a 6-point) 
ordinal scale at Day 14 using a proportional odds model. The scale used the following categories: 
1. Death;  
2. Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO;  
3. Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices;  
4. Hospitalized, requiring low flow supplemental oxygen;  
5. Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen – requiring ongoing medical care (COVID-19 related or 
otherwise);  
6. Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - no longer requires ongoing medical care (other than 
per protocol RDV administration);  
7. Not hospitalized. 
The endpoint will be derived by combining the available death, hospital discharge alive and ordinal scale 
assessment reported by the site, where death supersedes discharge alive and discharge alive supersedes the 
ordinal scale score reported by the site. 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) is the primary analysis set for efficacy analysis and includes all patients 
randomized into Part A of the study that have received at least 1 dose of RDV. 
The primary endpoint was to be analyzed using a proportional odds model including treatment as the 
independent variable and baseline score as a continuous covariate. 
Virological investigations 
SARS-CoV-2 testing may include RT-qPCR to detect or quantify SARS-CoV-2 or virus sequencing results. If 
feasible, OP, saliva, sputum, stool, and/or blood samples may be collected and assayed using RT-qPCR to 
quantify SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Pre-treatment and posttreatment samples with detectable SARS-CoV-2 may 
be sequenced for resistance monitoring of the viral polymerase gene if possible. Results have not been 
presented. 
Participant flow 
A total of 402 patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the 5-day and 10-day remdesivir groups. The 
sponsor excluded 5 patients who were randomized but not treated, and the primary analysis set included 
200 patients in the 5-day group and 197 patients in the 10- day group. Relevant information in terms of 
patient flow, such as protocol deviations, follow-up and analysis sets, are missing.

Statistical methods 
The null hypothesis being tested is whether the odds of improvement on the ordinal scale is the same for the 
two treatment groups (i.e., whether the common odds ratio is equal to 1). The odds ratio and 95% 
confidence interval will be provided. If a participant is discharged prior to Day 14, the Day 14 ordinal scale 
category is considered to be not hospitalized.

The protocol does not define a directional alternative hypothesis, but evidently only in case the 10 day 
treatment arm was superior to the 5 day treatment arm, a drug effect would have been isolated. 
No multiplicity adjustment was planned due to this interim analysis, as it comprises the primary analysis for 
Part A. 
Values for missing data were not imputed.  
The primary analysis concerning the baseline adjustment as specified in the protocol was changed in the SAP 
dated April 22, 2020. 
Conduct of the study 
As the study is ongoing, no clinical study report in line with ICH E3 (CPMP/ICH/137/95) is currently 
available.  
Comprehensive information on protocol violations has not been presented.

With the exception of male gender, it appears that baseline characteristics in terms of demographics (age, 
gender, BMI, race) and baseline comorbidities (diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, asthma) are 
relatively well balanced between treatment groups. It is unclear how many patients were recruited at sites 
within the EU. 
The overall distribution of clinical status was statistically significantly different between the RDV 5-day group 
and the RDV 10-day group (p = 0.019), with greater proportions of participants in the 2 highest disease 
severity categories (i.e., on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO and on noninvasive ventilation or high-
flow oxygen devices) for the RDV 10-day group than for the RDV 5-day group. 
The age range was 20-98 years. Adolescents were not included in the study.

Although concomitant use of drugs with potential antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 was prohibited, a 
considerable number of patients received non study antiviral drugs, i.e. (hydroxy)chloroquine, LPV/rtv, 
DRV/rtv, DRV/cobi, tocilizumab, interferon-beta, ribavirin, or oseltamivir, for some patients more than one 
agent was given. 
Table 15 Study 5773- Exposure to study drug 
In the 10-day treatment group, only 43% of the patients received remdesivir for 10 days and 27% in this 
group received only an up to 5-day course.  
The applicant notes that, given the stretched health care resources during the pandemic, it seemed 
appropriate to allow for patients to be discharged from the hospital as soon as medically indicated, 
regardless of whether they had completed the full assigned course of treatment with remdesivir. As a result, 
only 44% of patients in the 10-day treatment group completed the full course of therapy. 
Outcomes and estimations 
The primary endpoint was clinical outcome at Day 14. After adjusting for baseline clinical status, participants 
receiving a 10-day course of RDV had a similar distribution in clinical status at Day 14 as those receiving a 
5-day course (p = 0.1443; see table below)

Table 16 Study 5773 -Clinical outcomes at Day 14 
* Differences are expressed as rate differences, except in the case of time to clinical improvement, time to recovery, and 
time to modified recovery, for which differences are expressed as hazard ratios; for these time-to-event end points, the 
hazard ratio and its 95% confidence interval were estimated from a cause-specific proportional-hazards model including 
treatment and baseline clinical status as covariates. For events at prespecified time points (e.g., days 5, 7, 11, and 14), 
the difference in the proportion of subjects with an event under evaluation between treatment groups and the 95% 
confidence interval were estimated from the Mantel–Haenszel proportions adjusted according to baseline clinical status. 
† The P value was calculated from a Wilcoxon rank-sum test stratified by baseline clinical status. 
‡ Clinical improvement was defined as an improvement of at least 2 points from baseline on the 7-point ordinal scale; 
recovery was defined as an improvement from a baseline score of 2 to 5 to a score of 6 or 7; and modified recovery was 
defined as an improvement from a baseline score of 2 to 4 to a score of 5 to 7 or from a score of 5 to a score of 6 or 7. 
Cumulative incidence functions were calculated for each treatment group for days to the event under evaluation (i.e., 
clinical improvement, recovery, or modified recovery), with death as the competing risk. Data for patients not achieving 
the event under evaluation at the last assessment were censored on the day of the last clinical assessment. Patients who 
died before achieving the event under evaluation were considered to have experienced a competing event

The reported results of the primary analysis of the proportional odds model at Day 14 shows an estimated 
odds ratio (adjusted for baseline imbalances) of 0.79 on a scale with values less than 1.00 favouring the 5-
day duration, with a 95% confidence interval from 0.61 to 1.04. Thus, there was a numerical trend showing 
improved outcomes in the 5-day group, although this difference was not statistically significant.

The result of the primary analysis as specified in the protocol was not presented. The p-value of the 
unadjusted analysis (primary analysis as specified in the protocol) is p=0.035 (indicating a statistically 
significant difference between both treatments in favour of the 5-day regimen with an OR of 0.67 and a 95% 
confidence interval of (0.46, 0.97). 
The median duration of hospitalization among patients discharged on or before day 14 was 7 days 
(interquartile range, 6 to 10) for the 5-day group and 8 days (interquartile range, 5 to 10) for the 10-day 
group. Numerically more patients were discharged from the hospital in the 5-day group than in the 10-day 
group (60%, vs. 52%). 
14-day mortality was numerically lower in the 5-day vs. the 10-day group (8%, vs. 11%). 
No virological outcomes are available. 
According to the protocol, 28-day mortality data will be collected.  
Ancillary analyses 
To justify the proposed treatment duration, the applicant presented a post-hoc comparison of treatment 
arms based on day 5 status to identify groups that may benefit from an additional 5 days of therapy. Among 
patients receiving mechanical ventilation or ECMO at day 5, 40% (10 of 25) in the 5-day group had died by 
day 14, as compared with 17% (7 of 41) in the 10-day group. Comparing both treatments with respect to 
the day 14 status adjusted for IMV on day 5 (yes/no) does not yield a significant treatment effect nor a 
significant treatment-by-IMV on day 5 interaction, indicating that the different treatment effects might still 
be a chance finding. In addition, 17 patients appear to be missing in the evaluation.  
Study title: A Phase 3 Randomized Study to Evaluate the Safety and Antiviral Activity of 
Remdesivir (GS-5734™) in Participants with moderate COVID-19  
(Study Code: GS-US-540-5774) 
Interim analysis was performed based on a data cut-off 26 May 2020. The SAP was authored on 25 May 
2020 in this open-label study. Thus, the level of pre-specification of the analysis plan is unclear. 
Methods 
This is a Phase 3 randomized, open-label, multi-center study of RDV therapy in participants with moderate 
COVID-19. 
In Part A, approximately 600 participants who meet all eligibility criteria may be randomized in 1:1:1 ratio 
into one of the following treatment groups: RDV for 5 days; RDV for 10 days; standard of care alone. 
Randomization was not stratified. Part B is an expanded access protocol. 
Study participants 
Patients were adult, or aged ≥ 12 and >18 years and weighing ≥ 40 kg, hospitalized and requiring medical 
care for COVID-19, with SpO2 > 94% on room air at screening, and with radiographic evidence of 
pulmonary infiltrates. Exclusion criteria included evidence of severe hepatic impairment (ALT or AST > 5 
times ULN) or renal impairment (CrCl < 50 mL/min). 
Treatments 
Remdesivir was administered intravenously at a dose of 200 mg on Day 1 followed by 100 mg on 
subsequent days, for a scheduled 5 or 10 days depending on study arm. The control arm received standard 
of care alone. 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020 
Page 106/199 
 
 
  
 
 
Concomitant medications 
Concomitant use of investigational agents such as approved HIV protease inhibitors like lopinavir/ritonavir, 
chloroquine, interferon, etc while receiving RDV is prohibited due to lack of evidence on additive or 
synergistic effects and potential for an increased risk of transaminase elevations. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint is clinical status assessed by a 7-point ordinal scale on Day 11. The ordinal 
scale is as follows: 
1. Death 
2. Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO 
3. Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices 
4. Hospitalized, requiring low flow supplemental oxygen 
5. Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring ongoing medical care 
6. Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - no longer requires ongoing medical care 
(other than per protocol RDV administration) 
7. Not hospitalized,  
The endpoint is derived by combining the available death, hospital discharge, and ordinal scale assessment 
reported by the site, where death supersedes discharge and discharge supersedes the ordinal scale score 
reported by the site. 
Blinding, masking, randomisation and statistical methods 
Subjects who met eligibility criteria were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio; randomization was not stratified. 
Blinding of treatment assignments or data was not performed in this study. 
The primary endpoint was to be analysed using a proportional odds model, to compare each RDV  
(5-day or 10-day) group with the SOC group, including treatment as the independent variable.  
The 25 May SAP states that, for control for Type I error rate, the statistical significance of RDV treatment 
effect was to be assessed based on the Bonferroni method. Each hypothesis (5-day RDV vs. SOC and 10-day 
RDV vs. SOC) will be tested at alpha level of 0.025. This information is not found in the original protocol of 
this open-label study. 
No multiplicity adjustment was planned due to the interim analysis, as it comprises the primary analysis for 
Part A. 
The proportion of participants in each category was to be summarized by treatment group. The assumption 
of odds proportionality was to be assessed using a score test and reported.  
The primary analysis set for efficacy analysis is the Full Analysis Set (FAS), which includes all participants 
who (1) are randomized into Part A of the study and (2) have received at least 1 dose of study treatment if 
randomized to one of the RDV treatment groups. Participants in the SOC arm who have had protocol Day 1 
visit are included in the FAS. 
Values for missing data were not imputed according to the protocol. According to SAP missing data was 
replaced by last observation carried forward for the ordinal scale.

Participant flow 
Conduct of the study 
As the study is ongoing, no clinical study report in line with ICH E3 (CPMP/ICH/137/95) is currently 
available. While approximately 37% of the participants have been recruited in Europe, 44% come from the 
USA. 12 patients randomised to either of the RDV arms who were not treated, were excluded from analysis.  
No information on concomitant use of other antiviral medications was provided. 
Baseline data 
Most participants were male (61.1%), with a median age (range) of 57 (12 to 95) years; most participants 
were white (61.3%) and not Hispanic or Latino (81.9%). The most common comorbidities were hypertension 
(39.0%), hyperlipidaemia (15.4%), and cough (14.6%).

The median duration of symptoms at baseline was 9 days, similar to the NIAID-ACTT study, and the majority 
of patients did not require supplemental oxygen at baseline. 
In the 10-day treatment group, 38% of the patients received remdesivir for 10 days and almost 50% in this 
group received only an up to 5-day course.

Outcomes and estimations 
For the primary endpoint clinical status at Day 11, a statistically significant improvement in clinical status at 
Day 11 for participants receiving a 5-day course of RDV compared with those receiving SOC alone was found 
(OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.09 to 2.48; p=0.017) based on the LOCF-analysis (Table 26). Based on the Observed 
cases (OC)-analysis, as prespecified in the protocol, no difference for either RDV compared to SOC was seen 
(RDV 5d vs. SOC p=0.059). 
Data concerning the length of the hospital stay, do not indicate a positive effect of RDV (5-day: 8 days, 10-
day: 8 days; SOC: 7 days.

There was a statistically significant difference in the distribution in clinical status at Day 11 for participants 
receiving a 5-day course of RDV compared with those receiving SOC alone, while participants receiving a 10-
day course of RDV had a similar distribution as those receiving SOC alone (see table below).  
Table 21  Study -5774: Clinical Status (7 Point Ordinal Scale) on Day 11 (FAS) 
For other efficacy endpoints of interest, at Day 11, ≥ 2-point improvements in the clinical ordinal scale were 
reported in 70.2% of participants who received a 5-day course of RDV and 65.3% of participants who 
received a 10 day course of RDV compared with 60.5% of those who received SOC alone. Clinical recovery 
at Day 11 was achieved in a numerically greater proportion of participants in the RDV 5-day group (73.8%) 
than the RDV 10-day group (68.4%) and the SOC group (64.0%).

Virological endpoint 
The proportion of patients with to SARS-CoV-2 PCR negativity was an extrapolatory endpoint.  
No consistent effect of RDV with respect to cease of viral shedding was observed. 
Study title: A Phase 3 Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Multicenter Study 
to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Remdesivir in Hospitalized Adult Patients with 
Severe COVID-19. (GS-US 540-5758) 
Methods 
This was an investigator-initiated, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial performed at ten 
hospitals in Wuhan, Hubei, China. 
Study participants 
Adult patients, RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2, had pneumonia confirmed by chest imaging or had oxygen 
saturation of 94% or lower on room air or a ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired 
oxygen of 300 mm Hg or less, and were within 12 days of symptom onset. 
Assessment report

Page 113/199 
 
 
  
 
 
Exclusion criteria included hepatic cirrhosis; alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase more 
than five times the upper limit of normal; known severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration 
rate <30 mL/min per 1·73 m²) or receipt of continuous renal replacement therapy, haemodialysis, or 
peritoneal dialysis; 
Treatments 
Patients received either intravenous remdesivir (from lyophilized formulation) 200 mg on day 1 followed by 
100 mg on days 2–10 in single daily infusions) or the same volume of placebo infusions for a total of 10 
days. Blinded placebo was provided by Gilead. 
Concomitant medications 
The use of other experimental treatments for COVID-19, including lopinavir–ritonavir, was permitted. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Eligible patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to either the remdesivir group or the placebo group. 
Randomisation was stratified according to the level of respiratory support as follows: (1) no oxygen support 
or oxygen support with nasal duct or mask; or (2) high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, invasive 
ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. 
The primary clinical endpoint was time to clinical improvement within 28 days after randomisation. Clinical 
improvement was defined as a two-point reduction in patients’ admission status on a six-point ordinal scale, 
or live discharge from the hospital, whichever came first. The six-point scale was as follows:  
6=death 
5= hospital admission for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or mechanical ventilation 
4= hospital admission for noninvasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen therapy  
3= hospital admission for oxygen therapy (but not requiring high-flow or non-invasive ventilation) 
2= hospital admission but not requiring oxygen therapy  
1= discharged or having reached discharge criteria (defined as clinical recovery—ie, normalisation of 
pyrexia, respiratory rate <24 breaths per minute, saturation of peripheral oxygen >94% on room air, and 
relief of cough, all maintained for at least 72 h) 
Secondary endpoints included all-cause mortality until day 28. 
Overall, the study chronology and important milestones of clinical trial conduct are missing and conflicting 
information is available in the public domain on the change of the primary endpoint. 
The original design required a total of 325 events across both groups, which would provide 80% power 
under a one-sided type I error of 2·5% if the hazard ratio (HR) comparing remdesivir to placebo is 1·4, 
corresponding to a change in time to clinical improvement of 6 days assuming that time to clinical 
improvement is 21 days on placebo. 
Assuming an 80% event rate within 28 days across both groups and a dropout rate of 10% implied that 
about 453 patients should be recruited for this trial. 
The primary efficacy analysis was done on an intention to- treat (ITT) basis with all randomly assigned 
patients. Time to clinical improvement was assessed after all patients had reached day 28; no clinical 
improvement at day 28 or death before day 28 were considered as right censored at day 28. 
Virological investigations 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020 
Page 114/199 
 
 
  
 
NP and OP swabs, expectorated sputa as available, and faecal or anal swab specimens were collected on 
days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28 for viral RNA detection and quantification. Virological measures included 
the proportions of patients with viral RNA detected and viral RNA load (measured by quantitative RT-PCR). 
Virological testing was done at a central lab using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. At baseline, the upper 
(nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs) and lower respiratory tract specimens were tested for detection of 
E-gene, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene, and N-gene, then samples on the subsequent visits were 
quantitatively and qualitative assessed for E-gene. 
Participant flow 
158 patients were assigned to receive remdesivir and 79 to receive placebo; one patient in the placebo 
group withdrew their previously written informed consent after randomisation, so 158 and 78 patients were 
included in the ITT population.  
Conduct of the study 
Between 6 Feb 2020 and 12 March 2020, 255 patients were screened, of whom 237 were eligible. 
No patients were enrolled after March 12, because of the control of the outbreak in Wuhan and on the basis 
of the termination criteria specified in the protocol, the data safety and monitoring board recommended that 
the study be terminated, and data analysed on 29 March.  
When all the other assumptions stayed the same, with the actual enrolment of 236 participants, the 
statistical power was reduced from 80% to 58%. 
Baseline data 
Baseline characteristics were overall reasonably balanced between groups.  
Patients are somewhat older on average than in the NIAID study. As anticipated, there is a higher proportion 
of men than women, and randomisation in this small study is not fully balanced. Similar to the NIAID study, 
hypertension and type 2 diabetes are the most prevalent comorbidities. Notably, 29% and 38% of patients 
in the remdesivir and placebo arms received concomitant interferon beta, and two-thirds of patients received 
corticosteroids during the study. Such data are not available for the NIAID study, but it is likely that such 
comedications were considerably less common there. 
Median time from symptom onset to therapy is very similar to the NIAID study, whereas the proportion of 
patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline are very few in the study by Wang et al, 
compared to 26% in the NIAID study. 
Outcomes and estimations 
158 patients on RDV and 78 patients on placebo were included in the ITT-analysis. In the ITT-population, 
the time to clinical improvement in the remdesivir group was not significantly different to that of the control 
group. Time to clinical improvement was (median 21·0 days [IQR 13·0–28·0] in the remdesivir group vs 
23·0 days [15·0–28·0] in the placebo group; HR 1·23 [95% CI 0·87–1·75]. 
In an exploratory analysis in the subgroup of patients receiving remdesivir or placebo within 10 days of 
symptom onset in the ITT-population, those receiving remdesivir had a numerically faster time to clinical 
improvement than those receiving placebo (median 18·0 days [IQR 12·0–28·0] vs 23·0 days [15·0–28·0]; 
HR 1·52 [0·95–2·43], which would be in line with what is known for other antivirals in acute viral infections.  
28-day all-cause mortality was similar between the two groups (22 [14%] died in the remdesivir group vs 10 
(13%) in the placebo group; difference 1·1% [95% CI –8·1 to 10·3]).

Virological outcomes 
Of 236 patients (158 in the remdesivir group and 78 in the placebo group) who were RT-PCR positive at 
enrolment, 37 (19%) of the 196 with data available had undetectable viral RNA on the NP and OP swab 
taken at baseline. 
The mean baseline viral load of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs was 4·7 log10 copies per mL (SE 
0·3) in the remdesivir group and 4·7 log10 copies per mL (0·4) in the control group. Viral load decreased 
over time similarly in both groups. No differences in viral load were observed when stratified by interval from 
symptom onset to start of study treatment. In the 106 patients from whom expectorated sputa could be 
obtained, when adjusted for baseline sputum viral load at enrolment, the remdesivir group showed no 
significant difference at day 5 from placebo, but a slightly more rapid decline in load (p=0·0672) 
The cumulative rate of undetectable viral RNA of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs by day 28 was 
153 (78%) of 196 patients, and the negative proportion was similar among patients receiving remdesivir and 
those receiving placebo.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Basis of the Application for conditional marketing authorisation 
COVID-19 inarguably represents the most significant public health emergency of our time. There are no 
products with established efficacy and regulatory approval in the EU. There is significant unmet medical 
need. In addition, the medicinal product under assessment is intended for use in an emergency situation, in 
response to public health threats duly recognised by the WHO and the EC. 
Remdesivir exhibits in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 with nanomolar EC50’s. There are clinical effects in 
non-stringent animal models of COVID-19, as well as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV disease. These, however, 
may be understood to represent mainly post-exposure prophylaxis rather than the treatment scenario. In 
the non-lethal rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2, antiviral effects were only noted in lungs, but not in 
upper respiratory secretions. The reasons for this are not understood.  
It is important to note that the appropriate matrix for quantifying SARS-CoV-2 viral load has not been 
established. Further, there is no validated quantitative PCR, or a WHO reference standard. Therefore, the 
sensitivity of virological methods to detect antiviral activity is uncertain. Moreover, as seen in for instance 
the study by Wang et al, it is not uncommon that patients with evident COVID-19 and positive screening or 
diagnostic sample, test negative in NP or OP secretions at baseline. The clinical significance of this is not 
understood. 
The initial rolling review formally started subsequent to the announcement, on 30th April 2020, by the NIAID, 
that the ACTT(1)-study was formally positive and would now be unblinded, all patients being offered 
remdesivir. 
On 5th June 2020, the application for a conditional marketing authorisation was submitted. 
Only top line data is available for this pivotal trial, as well as for three other RCTs providing further 
information. Thus, data are presently non-comprehensive. 
Target populations and endpoints in COVID-19 
There is no regulatory guidance on SARS-CoV-2 drug development. In most large studies of drugs with a 
presumed antiviral mechanism of action, target populations have been dichotomised into the “moderate” 
(SpO2 on room air above 93-94%) and “severe” (SpO2 below this level or in need of supplementary oxygen- 
or other respiratory support). Other important potential effect modifiers include time from symptom onset to 
treatment initiation. The notion of the importance of this, is extrapolated from influenza, where this is known 
to impact the efficacy of treatment. There is presently no regulatory guidance or precedent specifying a 
particular preferred primary endpoint for studies in this indication. An impact on mortality would be the most 
clinically relevant as well as scientifically persuasive outcome of a study in COVID-19. However, this may not 
be readily demonstrated in a study program, due to its limited size and/or limited effects of the treatment 
administered. 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020 
Page 119/199 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Notably, mortality is not the only clinically relevant endpoint. In analogy with developments in the influenza 
field, an ordinal scale for classifying patient response at a given day or as a time to recovery endpoint, was 
proposed by WHO and has been used in several trials, including all four RCTs that are discussed above. 
Provided that the study is unambiguously double-blinded, these are anticipated to produced unbiased effect 
estimates.  
On the other hand, agents for the treatment of influenza have been approved based on an impact on time to 
recovery. 
The definition of recovery has been variable in the three studies assessed. In the NIAID-ACTT-study three 
categories of an ordinal scale were collapsed to provide the definition of recovery. Thus, the primary 
endpoint of the NIAID-ACTT study, pivotal to this application, could be considered to capture clinical benefit. 
The pivotal NIAID-ACTT1 study (CO-US-540-5776) 
This study is not sponsored by the applicant. No CSR or TFL are available. It has been assessed based on the 
SAP and the publication by Beigel et al, 2020 (NEJM 2020). 
This double-blinded, placebo-controlled study compared RDV for ten days with placebo in 1063 patients 
hospitalised with moderate or severe COVID-19. Severe cases dominated, and 26% of patients required IMV 
or ECMO at baseline. Of note, only 33% of the participants received the planned 10 doses of RDV. 
The study, which had a time-to-event design, was unblinded after a primary analysis indicating that RDV 
decreased median time to recovery from 15 to 11 days, with a p-value of 0.0009. The recovery rate ratio 
was 1.32 (95% CI 1.12 to 1.55; p<0.001). After adjustment for baseline imbalances, this was essentially 
unchanged with a recovery rate ratio of 1.31 (95%CI, 1.12 to 1.54, based on 1017 patients). 
The efficacy demonstration was confined to the severe stratum (patients with pneumonia and need for 
supplemental oxygen), whereas no effect could be shown in the mild-moderate stratum which recruited 
approximately 120 patients. Moreover, no difference was seen in time to recovery in patients who started 
remdesivir when they were already on mechanical ventilation or ECMO (extracorporeal membrane 
oxygenation). 
While patient follow-up is still ongoing with final outcome data missing for approximately 28% of the 
participants, it is unlikely that the final analysis of the primary endpoint could over-ride the inferential 
analysis.  
Estimated 28-day all-cause mortality was 7.1% in the RDV group and 11.9% in the placebo group, with a HR 
of 0.70 (95%CI 0.47 to 1.04). While mortality estimates in patients on low flow supplemental oxygen favour 
remdesivir, those in the subgroup of patient on IMV/ECMO at baseline, are trending in favour of placebo. The 
analysis of the full set of 28-day mortality is pending and will be submitted as soon as these data become 
available.  
Clinical status per ordinal scale at day 15 was the primary endpoint according to the original protocol. This 
also showed a statistically significant effect of remdesivir over placebo. 
There was no apparent difference in efficacy depending on whether therapy was started within or after 10 
days of symptoms. In accordance with the above, this is somewhat surprising. 
The extent of use of concomitant medications, including corticosteroids, that might impact the course of 
COVID-19 is presently not known due to limitations of available data. 
Virological endpoints were exploratory and sampling non-mandatory per protocol. The lack of mechanistic 
proof of the antiviral activity of RDV is an important limitation on the evidence base for its efficacy.

Additional clinical evidence 
Study GS-US 540 5773 is an open-label RCT and was performed in a “severe” population, but with very 
few patients on IMV/ventilator. The study failed to demonstrate a dose/duration - response relationship, 
since 10 days treatment was not better than 5 days. Noteworthy, mortality in the 10-day arm was not 
different from the mortality in the placebo arm in the NIAID-study, while severity of disease of the patients 
included was overall less. Overall, there seem to be trends in favour of 5-day therapy. It is of note that only 
a proportion of 44% in the 10-day treatment arm received a full treatment course. While the study did 
neither include a standard of care arm nor was it designed as non-inferiority study, it seems to indicate, if 
taken together with results from the placebo-controlled NIAID ACTT1-study, that a treatment course of 5 
days does not lead to any loss of efficacy. This conclusion does not apply to those requiring IMV at baseline, 
as these were not represented in the study. 
It must be noted that the overall level of evidence from this study is weak, particularly due to the lack of 
blinding and potential subjectivity in primary outcome.  
Study GS-US 540 5774 was performed in a “mild/moderate” population. Due to several flaws in study 
design (e.g. no blinding, potential subjectivity in primary outcome, potential post-hoc adjustment of primary 
analysis), it is uncertain whether this trial was positive in a statistical sense, and inferences of efficacy 
cannot presently have this study as a basis. 
The placebo-controlled study in severely ill patients (GS-US 540-5758, China severe) was underpowered 
due to its premature termination following the falling incidence of COVID-19 in Wuhan. With a remaining 
power of 58% no beneficial effect for remdesivir was shown. It is notable that, compared to the NIAID-ACTT 
study, patients received less intensive ventilatory support at baseline. However, 28-day mortality was 13% 
versus 14% for placebo- and remdesivir-treated patients, which is in the same range as the (preliminary) 
mortality figures of the NIAID-ACTT trials. 
While based on a rather similar ordinal scale (a two-point reduction in patients’ admission status), the 
primary outcome measure was different from that of the NIAID-ACTT. Study GS-US 540-5758 did not show 
any statistically significant difference for the primary endpoint (nor for mortality). Only in the subgroup of 
patients starting therapy within ten days of symptom onset, the point estimate on the primary endpoint was 
trending in favour of remdesivir.  
As yet, no in-vivo antiviral effect of remdesivir has been shown. The sensitivity of the methods used has not 
been established, and the sample sizes are limited and heterogeneous with respect to matrix. The applicant 
committed to present the virology report from the NIAID-ACTT1 study and any other virology data becoming 
available from patients with COVID-19. 
Evaluation of the evidence for efficacy 
The regulatory evaluation of RDV efficacy is presently hampered by limitations in the comprehensiveness of 
data provided, with only top line results available from the pivotal trial, and no CSR’s available for any of the 
RCT that have reported results. Still, some conclusions can be drawn. 
The results of the primary analysis in the NIAID-ACTT(1) study provides statistically compelling evidence of 
a clinically relevant impact on time to recovery. This effect was constrained to the dominant stratum of 
patients with “severe disease”, whereas no effect could be demonstrated in the stratum with mild/moderate 
disease. The CHMP considered that the benefit of remdesivir in less ill patients without hypoxia or without 
respiratory distress has not been shown. Available data from the study GS-US-540-5774 are neither 
considered to support such use. 
The supportive studies provide support for the notion that a full 10-day course is frequently not necessary 
with remdesivir. Further, only a minority of the patients in the NIAID-ACTT(1) study received the planned 10 
doses, mostly because of discharge or death. 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020 
Page 121/199 
 
 
  
 
With respect to Day-28 all-cause mortality the preliminary analysis indicated a numerical benefit for 
remdesivir. The full dataset will be submitted for a comprehensive review once they are available.  
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
Pursuant to Article 17 and 21 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0201/2020 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0201/2020 was not yet completed as some measures 
were deferred. 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional Marketing 
Authorization (CMA)  
In the framework of the conditional marketing authorisation, to complete efficacy, the applicant should fulfil, 
post-approval, the specific obligations (SOs) as referred below in the conclusion.   
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Whereas in the context of a CMA the benefit of remdesivir is considered adequately shown for patients with 
COVID-19 with pneumonia and need for supplemental oxygen; this is not the case for patients with 
mild/moderate disease (i.e. SpO2>94% without tachypnoea or symptoms of respiratory distress). 
Data from study 5773 seems to indicate that 5 days suffice for patients not requiring IMV. In addition, 
considering the results from study 5774 there was no incremental effect of 10 days of treatment over 5 
days. Therefore, considering the available data, the Committee recommended that the total duration of 
treatment should be at least 5 days and not more than 10 days. The use of remdesivir should be confined to 
healthcare facilities in which patients can be monitored closely. 
During the procedure, several major objections were raised relating to the indication and in order to further 
clarify efficacy data. With the available data up to now, the Committee agreed to restrict the indication to 
patients who need supplement oxygen as explained before. Considering that the applicant accepted the 
indication agreed by the Committee, the information provided in the responses and the measures to be 
taken by the applicant after authorisation, the major objections were therefore considered solved. 
CHMP has considered that these available data would support granting a Conditional Marketing Authorisation 
taking into account the public health emergency of international concern declared by WHO and EU.  
In conclusion, based on the current dossier, Veklury may be approved as a conditional Marketing 
Authorisation with a list of specific obligations that need to be fulfilled, as detailed in the assessment report 
(see discussion section).  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the context of 
a CMA: 
• 
• 
In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of remdesivir, the applicant should submit the final clinical 
study report (CSR) of Study CO-US-540-5776 (NIAID-ACTT1). 
In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of remdesivir in patients on IMV/ECMO, the applicant 
should submit the published final D28 mortality data by ordinal scale categories of Study CO-US-
540-5776 (NIAID-ACTT1). In addition, the applicant should discuss potential imbalance in the use of 
corticosteroids and effect modification in Study CO-US-540-5776.

The overall incidence of AEs, study drug-related AEs, study drug related SAEs, and death were similar 
between the RDV 5 day and 10-day treatment groups (see table below). 
More participants in the RDV 10-day group than the RDV 5-day group had Grade ≥ 3 AEs, SAEs, and AEs 
leading to discontinuation, likely due to the differences in baseline disease characteristics, whereby the RDV 
10-day group had significantly worse clinical status than those randomized to the RDV 5-day group (p = 
0.019; Section 4.2.2).

An exploratory analysis sought to evaluate whether the difference in AEs reported in the RDV 10-day group 
was due to the differences in baseline clinical status, the increased duration of hospitalization for receiving 
study drug, or cumulative toxicity of RDV. 
The nominal values show higher rates of grade 3/4 AE’s as well as SAE’s in the 10 day arm, also during the 
five first days when treatment was similar When comparing Days 1 through 5 and adjusting for baseline 
clinical status, there was no statistical difference in AE profile between treatment groups. 
Within the RDV 10-day group, the AE profile was then evaluated during the first 5 days of therapy and 
compared to the second 5 days of therapy. While participants experienced additional AEs during Days 6 
through 10, the proportion of participants experiencing all types of AE was lower during Days 6 through 10 
than during Days 1 through 5 (death was reported for the same number of participants in each period, table 
below).

In the PALM study, a total of 9 SAEs judged by the site investigator as not related to underlying EVD were 
reported for participants receiving RDV. Of these, an event of hypotension, which occurred during 
administration of the loading dose and led to fatal cardiac arrest, was considered related to RDV. The 
independent pharmacovigilance committee noted that the death could not be readily distinguished from 
underlying fulminant EVD.

Adverse events of special interest 
Hepatic safety 
With once-daily dosing of RDV 150 mg for 14 days (a higher dose than used in participants with COVID-19), 
transient Grade 1 or 2 elevations in ALT and transient Grade 1 elevations in AST were observed in 75% of 
healthy participants (Study GS-US-399-1954). In some participants, ALT and AST elevations were associated 
with transient Grade 1 increased prothrombin time; however, there was no other evidence of hepatic effects. 
The incidence of hepatic AEs was similar across all treatment groups in Study GS-US-540-5774.  
One participant in the RDV 10-day group had an SAE of ALT increased, that was not considered related to 
study treatment. Six participants in the RDV 10-day group and 1 participant in the RDV 5-day group 
discontinued study drug due to AEs of liver enzyme elevation.

The incidence of liver-related AEs was similar between RDV-treated participants and placebo-treated

Renal safety 
The kidney was identified as a target organ of toxicity for RDV in nonclinical studies. 
Assessment report

Notably, acute kidney injury has been commonly observed among patients with COVID-19 requiring 
hospitalization. 
The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 renal related non serious AEs was similar between the RDV and placebo 
groups. The same applies for the incidence renal-related SAE: acute kidney injury: RDV: 0.7% (4 
participants); placebo 1.3% (7 participants); glomerular filtration rate decreased: RDV: 0.6% (3 
participants); placebo 0.4% (2 participants). 
In the GS-US-540-5773, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities in serum creatinine and CrCl 
was higher in the RDV 10-day group compared to in the RDV 5-day group. In an exploratory analysis, the 
difference in incidence between the groups was already evident at Day 5 of the study, when both groups had 
received the same duration of treatment. 
In Study GS-US-540-5774, the incidence of renal-related AEs was low and similar across all treatment 
groups. There were no renal-related SAEs in the RDV 5-day or 10-day groups. One participant in the SOC 
group had an SAE of acute kidney injury. 
In Study CO-US-540-5758, the only renal-related AE reported in ≥ 2% of participants in a treatment group 
was increased blood urea nitrogen (6% of participants in both the RDV and placebo groups). There was 1 
SAE of acute kidney injury in the RDV group (not Grade 3 or 4) and no renal SAEs in the placebo group. One 
participant discontinued drug due to Grade 3 or 4 acute kidney injury in the RDV group. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Clinical studies in COVID-19 
CO-US-540-5776  
Thirty-six patients had RDV treatment discontinued before day 10 because of an AE or a SAE other than 
death. 
GS-US-540-5773 
The proportion of participants who discontinued RDV due to AEs was 4.5% (9 participants) in the RDV 5-day 
group and 10.2% (20 participants) in the RDV 10-day group, with 7.1% (14 participants) in the RDV 10-day 
group discontinuing by Day 5; the difference between treatment groups was not statistically significant once 
differences in baseline clinical status were controlled for. The AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug 
that were reported in > 1 participant overall are presented by treatment group in the table below. Additional 
AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug were reported in 1 participant each and included 
thrombocytopenia, pneumonia, blood creatinine increased, and respiratory failure in the RDV 5 day group, 
and anemia, injection site erythema, rash, septic shock, AST increased, glomerular filtration rate decreased, 
renal failure, acute respiratory failure, and respiratory disorder in the RDV 10-day group.

Single-patient compassionate use 
Overall, 13 patients (8.0%) discontinued RDV due to AEs. Most of these patients discontinued due to AEs 
associated with renal dysfunction (4 patients) or elevated liver function tests (5 patients; the sponsor notes 
that for one patient, the AEs leading to discontinuation of RDV were initially reported as hepatitis and 
worsening hepatitis, which the requesting physician clarified to be only elevated transaminases without any 
clinical demonstration of hepatitis). 
Two patients discontinued due to multiple organ failure, 1 patient due to systolic dysfunction, and 1 patient 
due to respiratory distress.  
The following AEs were also reported as leading to discontinuation of RDV: maculopapular rash in a patient 
with transaminase elevations; rash in a patient with elevated transaminases (initially reported as hepatitis 
and worsening hepatitis); and hypotension in a patient with creatinine renal clearance abnormal and renal 
failure. 
A C-QT model was developed based on the data from study GS-US-399-1954, including RDV and the two 
metabolites GS-441524 and GS-704277. In general, model development was conducted according to 
guidelines. While there is no indication of a QT-prolonging potential at therapeutic concentrations, a 
limitation is  the lack of information on the impact of supratherapeutic concentrations. Therefore, a potential 
risk of QT-prolongation cannot be completely excluded.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database for RDV is relatively large and satisfies ICH-E1 requirements. Overall, 1,467 patients 
have received RDV for up to ten days (the maximal proposed duration) within randomised clinical trials in 
COVID-19. A further 163 patients have been reported from the compassionate use program. No integrated 
summary of safety, however, has been presented, nor are there available CSR’s from any of the randomised 
controlled trials that are pivotal or supportive to the application. Therefore, in this respect, safety data are 
deemed non-comprehensive. Furthermore, the understanding of patient factors such as co-morbidities, 
drug-drug interactions or disease severity, that may impact the tolerability of RDV, is incomplete. 
Overall, RDV seems well tolerated, with less than 10% of patients discontinuing due to AE’s in the studies 
where information is available.  
The assessment of the available data from individual Phase 2/3 studies investigating COVID-19 came to the 
following observations:  
CO-US-540-5776:  
The overall rate of AEs, SAEs and discontinuation rate due to AEs was comparable between RDV and placebo 
group. Complete information about all AEs recorded is not available and needs to be presented with the 
study report at the latest. Compared to placebo group incidences of AEs after treatment with RDV were only 
slightly higher for PTs hyperglycaemia/blood glucose increased (4.1 vs. 3.3%), blood creatinine increased 
(1.5 vs. 0.8%), prothrombin time prolonged (1.5 vs. 0.8%), and hypertension (2.0 vs. 0.8%). Regards to 
SAEs only 4 events (2 out of 114 SAEs in the RDV group and 2 out of 141 SAEs in the placebo group) were 
judged by the site investigators to be related to RDV or placebo which is a very low rate. Furthermore, no 
deaths were considered to be related to treatment with RDV. 
The analysis of safety from this study is not complete, due to the limitations of available information.  
GS-US-540-5773: 
The overall rate and severity of AEs tended to be lower in the treatment group who received RDV for 5 days 
compared to the 10 days RDV group. Nausea, acute respiratory failure, ALT increased and constipation were 
the most frequently reported PTs. The rate of most reported PTs was comparable between 5 days RDV group 
and 10 days RDV group (e.g. nausea, constipation, AST increased, hypokalemia). However, for single PTs 
the rate of AEs tended to be lower in the 5 days RDV group (e.g. acute respiratory failure, acute kidney 
injury).  
The rate of study drug-related AEs (5 days RDV 17%, 10 days RDV 19%) was comparable between 
treatment groups. According to the provided interim report the most frequently reported study drug related 
AEs were nausea (5-days group 4.5 % vs. 10-days group 2.5%), ALT and AST increased (5-days group 4.5 
% vs. 10-days group 11.2%), constipation (5-days group 1.5 % vs. 10-days group 1.5%), and vomiting (5-
days group 2 % vs. 10-days group 0%). Other ADRs were single cases or cases reported twice. 
The rate of deaths was slightly higher in the RDV 10-days group (25 [12.7%]) compared to the RDV 5-days 
group (19 [9.5%]).   
The occurrence of SAEs tended to be lower in the 5-days RDV group. The most frequently reported SAE were 
acute respiratory failure (5 days group 5%, 10-days group 9.1%), respiratory failure (5 days group 2.5%, 
10-days group 5.1%), respiratory distress (5 days group 1.5%, 10-days group 2.0%), and septic shock (5 
days group 1%, 10-days group 2.5%).  
The rate of study-drug related SAEs (5-days RDV group 3 cases of transaminases increased [1.5%], 10-days 
group RDV 4 cases related to hepatic enzyme increased [2%]) was comparable between treatment groups.

More patients in the 10-days RDV group discontinued treatment due to AEs. According to the Applicant this 
difference between treatment groups was not statistically significant once differences in baseline clinical 
status were controlled for. 
Overall, the higher incidence of AEs in the 10-day arm of the 5773 study is noted; however, the difference in 
AE’s here is clearly apparent already in the first 5 days where the assigned treatment is similar. Therefore, 
this is largely driven by baseline differences in disease severity. The findings from the 5773 study are not 
replicated in the 5774 study, which also compared these durations of treatment. 
GS-US-540-5774: 
The rate of AEs was 50.8% in the RDV 5-days group, 54.9% in the RDV 10-days group and 45.0% in the 
SOC group.  
Nausea, diarrhoea, hypokalaemiae, headache, constipation and ALT increased were the most commonly 
reported AEs. The rates of most AEs were comparable between treatment groups. Hypokalaemia was more 
frequently reported in RDV 10-days group (6.7%) compared to RDV 5-days group (4.7%). Constipation (5-
days group 4.2%, 10-days group 2.6%) and rash (5-days group 3.7%, 10-days group 2.1%) were more 
commonly registered in the 5-days group. When comparing to the SOC group the following PTs were more 
frequently reported in the RDV groups: nausea, hypokalaemia, headache, hypotension and transaminase 
increased. 
Study drug-related AEs occurred in a higher frequency in RDV 5-days group (18.8%) compared to RDV 10-
days group (12.4%). There was no placebo in this open-label study  
According to the provided interim report the most frequently reported study drug related AEs were nausea 
(5-days group 6.8% vs. 10-days group 3.6%), ALT and AST increased (5-days group 6.3% vs. 10-days 
group 3.2%), headache (5-days group 2.1 % vs. 10-days group 1.6%), diarrhoea (5-days group 1.6% vs. 
10-days group 1.6%), rash (5-days group 2.6 % vs. 10-days group 0.5%) and vomiting (5-days group 0.5 
% vs. 10-days group 1.6%). Other ADRs were single cases or cases reported twice. In 6 cases (3.1%) in the 
5-days group and 5 cases (2.6%) in the 10-days group ADRs were rated as grade 3 or higher.  
The rate of deaths was comparable between RDV 5-days group (1.0%) compared to the RDV 10-days group 
(1.0%]).    
Occurrence of SAEs were comparable between RDV groups (5-days group 4.2% vs. 10 days group 3.6%). 
The rate of SAEs was higher in the SOC group (9.9%). All SAEs were single cases or appeared twice. 
In only one case the SAE was rated as study drug-related (RDV 5-days group: heart rate decreased). 
Overall, slightly more patients in the 10-days RDV group discontinued treatment due to AEs (3.6% vs. 
2.1%). The reason for discontinuation in most cases was liver enzyme elevation. 
CO-US-540-5758:  
AEs presented by the Applicant (based on publication by Wang et al. 2020) were in general comparable 
between RDV and placebo group. Only rash (7% vs. 3%) and thrombocytopenia (10% vs. 6%) were 
reported more frequently in the RDV group. SAEs were less reported in the RDV group compared to the 
placebo group. According to the publication, all deaths during the observation period were judged by the site 
investigators to be unrelated to the intervention.  
Regards to laboratory findings, overall, changes in ALT/AST, total bilirubin, haemoglobin, platelets, 
creatinine and hyperglycemia were reported after treatment with RDV.  
Overall, RDV seems to be well tolerated in clinical studies. However, a completed safety assessment of RDV 
is not currently possible based on data available.

Furthermore, the warning related to hypersensitivity reactions has been also added in line with FDA labelling 
and the respective cases discussed. 
Full clinical study reports and an integrated summary of safety should be submitted as soon as they are 
available. This is recorded as a specific obligation that the applicant must fulfil,   
Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional  
In the framework of the conditional marketing authorisation, to complete data and analysis on safety, the 
applicant should fulfil post-approval the specific obligations (SOs) described below in the conclusion. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Available data on RDV safety are non-comprehensive, due to the incompleteness of data presentation. 
Available data, however, indicates that RDV is well tolerated. Apart from a likely possibility of causing 
transaminitis, no signature toxicity has been seen. Regards to hypersensitivity reactions a warning was 
added. 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC will be updated after submitting CSRs and Module 2.7.4 with complete information 
about adverse reactions reported during clinical studies. 
An updated analysis of safety will be delivered as a specific obligation in the context of a CMA. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the context of a 
CMA: 
• 
• 
In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of remdesivir, the applicant should submit the final clinical 
study report (CSR) of Studies: CO-US-540-5776 (NIAID-ACTT1), GS-US-540-5774 and GS-US-540-
5774 (see description in conclusion on clinical efficacy)  
In order to confirm the safety profile of remdesivir, the applicant should submit in Module 2.7.4 an 
analysis of all available safety data from clinical trials CO-US-540-5776, GS-US-540-5773, GS-US-
540-5774 and CO-US-540-5758 when completed, including case narratives, detailed information 
about adverse reaction and exposure data as well as an analysis of occurrence and aggravation of 
AEs, SAEs and ADRs  associated with increasing exposure. 
2.7.  Risk Management Plan 
Safety concerns 
The applicant submitted for evaluation an RMP version 1.0 dated 24 June 2020, with the following summary 
of safety concerns: 
Important Identified Risks 
Hypersensitivity including Infusion-Related Reaction 
Important Potential Risks  
Hepatotoxicity 
Nephrotoxicity 
Missing Information 
Safety in patients with hepatic impairment 
Assessment report

Safety in patients with severe renal impairment 
Safety in pregnant and lactating women 
A certain degree of hepatic toxicity is already labelled as a transaminase increase in SmPC and severe liver 
damage cannot be excluded due to the currently low quality of safety data provided: currently no case 
narratives are available, and no adverse drug reactions analysis is available from the NIAID study. 
Therefore, there is currently significant uncertainty with regard the level and frequency of severe 
hepatotoxicity potentially caused by remdesivir in clinical practice. Consequently, hepatotoxicity has been 
included as an important potential risk in the RMP, together with measures to further assess and minimize 
this risk.  
As non-clinical data as well as case-reports from the compassionate use program showed signs of 
nephrotoxicity, and SBECD may also contribute to renal toxicity, this risk was included as an important 
potential risk in the RMP, together with measures to further evaluate and minimise it.  
Cases of hypersensitivity including infusion-related reactions following administration of RDV have been 
reported. Signs and symptoms ranged from throat itching to significant hypotension. Therefore, it was 
considered that “Hypersensitivity including infusion-related reactions" is warranted to be included in the RMP 
as an important identified risk. The potentially higher nephrotoxicity of the 'concentrate for injection 
solutions' due to the higher concentration of Betadex will be addressed within the important potential risk of 
“nephrotoxicity” prior to marketing the concentrate for solution. 
The inclusion of “Safety in patients with hepatic impairment” and “Safety in patients with severe renal 
impairment” as missing information and the proposals how to further evaluate these risks is supported.  
In addition, the inclusion of “Safety in pregnant and lactating women” as missing information is supported. 
The applicant will further evaluate this missing information within category 3 study IN-US-540-5755 as the 
patient compassionate use program allows pregnant women to request treatment with RDV.  
Having considered the data in the safety specification the CHMP considers the list of safety concerns 
appropriate. 
 Pharmacovigilance plan 
Routine pharmacovigilance measures include: 
• 
The use of Postmarketing pregnancy report forms and Postmarketing pregnancy outcome report 
forms. The Postmarketing pregnancy report form will be updated by the MAH to clearly indicate a 
request for the contact details of the healthcare professional following the pregnant woman (e.g. 
obstetrician/gynaecologist). 
•  Monthly summary safety reports submitted to EMA, including spontaneously reported data and data 
from compassionate use and expanded access programs, for the duration of the COVID-19 
pandemic.

The PRAC and CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed routine 
risk minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indication. 
Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC consider that the risk management plan version 1.0 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. The PSUR cycle is based on a 
birth date determined by the compassionate use programme for this product.  
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall submit the first PSUR for this product within 6 months 
following authorisation (DLP 01/10/2020).  
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of remdesivir with active substances contained in authorised medicinal 
products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture of isomers, 
complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers remdesivir to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: considering 
the limited amount of time available during the evaluation of this procedure the company will be conducting 
a user consultation shortly after the marketing authorisation has been issued to fulfil the relevant legal 
requirement. CHMP recommends conducting and submit the readability testing as soon after authorisation as 
possible. 
2.10.2.  Labelling exemptions  
A request to omit certain particulars from the labelling as per Art.63.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC has been 
submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following reasons: 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020 
Page 160/199 
 
 
  
 
The justification of the company was based on the fact that the vial labels used for both remdesivir 
formulations are too small to accommodate full labelling particulars. Moreover, the full labelling particulars 
will be included on the carton label which will contain only 1 vial per carton for single use only and which 
once opened is to be used immediately. Additionally, the medicinal product is not intended to be delivered 
directly to the patient and is administered to the patient by the healthcare professional who will have the 
information and knowledge on correct and safe use of the product. On the basis of the above the Group 
accepted the request to use minimum particulars for the 20ml vial label of both Remdesivir 100mg 
concentrate for solution for infusion, and Remdesivir 100 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion. 
2.10.3.  Quick Response (QR) code 
A request to include a QR code in the labelling and package leaflet for the purpose of providing statutory 
information in all EU languages has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable. 
The following elements have been agreed to be provided through a QR code:  
1. A public section which will contain the following public domain information in the local language: 
- SmPC 
- PL with HCPL attached 
- where required the blue box information, 
2. A HCP section which will contain the following information in the local language: 
- SmPC 
- PL with HCPL attached. 
2.10.4.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Veklury (remdesivir) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU and it is approved under a conditional marketing authorisation. 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The human disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been designated COVID-19. In most (~80%) cases, COVID-
19 presents as a mild-to-moderately severe, self-limited acute respiratory illness with fever, cough, and 
shortness of breath. Symptoms are thought to appear 2 to 14 days after exposure. COVID-19 can be severe, 
resulting in pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, hypercoagulation, kidney failure, and death. 
There is no regulatory guidance on SARS-CoV-2 drug development. With regards to endpoints, an impact on 
mortality would be the most clinically relevant as well as scientifically persuasive outcome of a study in 
COVID-19. However, this may not be readily demonstrated in a study program, due to its limited size and/or 
limited effects of the treatment administered. 
Notably, mortality is not the only clinically relevant endpoint. In analogy with developments in the influenza 
field, an ordinal scale for classifying patient response at a given day or as a time to recovery endpoint, was 
proposed by WHO, and has been used in several trials, including all four RCTs that are relevant to this 
application. Provided that the study is efficiently double-blinded, these are anticipated to produce unbiased 
effect estimates.  
Anti-influenza agents have been approved based on an impact on time to recovery. Such endpoints are 
considered to capture clinical benefit for COVID-19 also, both in terms of the alleviation of symptoms and 
suffering, as well as in terms of saving public health resources.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Currently, there are no medicinal products for the treatment of COVID-19 approved in the European Union 
(EU) 2. Patients with this condition are treated with relevant supportive care, including e.g., oxygen, 
mechanical ventilation and other life support, as required.  
Several immunomodulating therapies such as glucocorticoids, convalescent plasma, and anticytokine 
therapies, are also currently under investigation in patients with severe disease. In this context, an impact of 
dexamethasone treatment on mortality in patients with hypoxia has recently been reported. It remains 
however that there is no medicinal product authorised in the EU for the treatment of COVID-19  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
There are presently (top-line) data from four RCTs to inform on the clinical efficacy and safety of remdesivir 
(RDV). There are no CSRs for either of these studies.  
The four trials include: 
•  A Multicenter, Adaptive, Randomized Blinded Controlled Trial of the Safety and Efficacy of 
Investigational Therapeutics for the Treatment of COVID-19 in Hospitalized Adults (CO-US-540-
5776) 
2 A nationally authorised chloroquine product in Poland (Arechin) has the therapeutic indication that includes supportive treatment 
of SARS-Cov-2 infection. However, such authorisation does not exist in other member states and there is no scientific evidence on 
the efficacy of this chloroquine that would be comparable to the extent of evidence on remdesivir, as discussed in this report.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
The pivotal NIAID-ACTT(1) (GS-US 540 5776) study is a randomised, double-blinded and placebo-
controlled study conducted in hospitalised patients with COVID-19, with evidence of lower respiratory tract 
involvement. Treatment with remdesivir/placebo was for up to 10 days. The primary endpoint was the time 
to recovery (defined as no longer being hospitalised or being hospitalised but no longer requiring medical 
care). At the time of the primary analysis, 1063 patients had been randomised. The analysis population 
included 1059 patients for whom the authors had at least some post-baseline data available (538 in the 
remdesivir group and 521 in the placebo group). 
According to the inferential analysis, the median difference in time to recovery is 4 days favouring the 
remdesivir group. In the primary endpoint remdesivir was hence superior to placebo in the treatment of 
hospitalized participants with COVID-19 (HR: 1.32, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.55; p<0.001). This effect is evident 
regardless of whether the duration of symptoms at treatment initiation was more or less than 10 days.  
In the stratum of patients with “severe disease” (with pneumonia and need for supplemental oxygen), 
representing approximately 90% of patients in the study, the difference in median time to recovery was 12 
versus 18 days, The RR was 1.36 (95% CI 1.143-1.1623;,p<0.001). 
No difference in time to recovery was seen in the stratum of “mild-moderate disease”. 
In the overall study population, the Kaplan–Meier estimates of mortality by 14 days were 7.1% (32/538 
patients) and 11.9% (54/521 patients) in the remdesivir and placebo groups, respectively showing a hazard 
ratio for death of 0.70 (95% CI 0,47 to 1.04).

The GS-US-540-5773 study is an ongoing randomised, open-label study comparing 5-day and 10-day 
remdesivir durations in patients with “severe” COVID-19. The pre-specified primary efficacy analysis was to 
examine results on a 7-point ordinal scale at Day 14 using a proportional odds model. The Day-14 primary 
analysis included 397 patients, 200 patients in the 5-day treatment group and 197 patients in the 10-day 
treatment group. 
The reported results of the primary analysis of the proportional odds model at Day 14 shows an estimated 
odds ratio (adjusted for baseline imbalances) of 0.79 on a scale with values less than 1.00 favouring the 5-
day duration, with a 95% confidence interval from 0.61 to 1.04.  
The GS-US-540-5774 study is an ongoing randomised, open-label study comparing 5-day remdesivir with 
SOC and 10-day remdesivir with SOC in patients with “moderate” COVID-19. The study is conducted in two 
parts. In Part A, eligible participants are randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to either 5-day and 10-day remdesivir 
durations or SOC. The pre-specified primary efficacy analysis was to examine results on a 7-point ordinal 
scale at Day 11 using a proportional odds model. The Day 11 primary analysis included 584 patients, 191 
patients in the 5-day treatment group, 193 patients in the 10-day treatment group and 200 patients in the 
SOC-arm. 
Based on the LOCF-analysis treatment with RDV for 5 days resulted in significantly greater improvements in 
clinical status at Day 11 compared with SOC alone (OR, 1.65; 95% CI 1.09 to 2.48; p = 0.0174). Treatment 
with RDV for 10 days did not result in significantly greater improvements in clinical status at Day 11 
compared with SOC alone (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.95; p = 0.1826).  
Study CO-US-540-5758 (reported by Wang et al) was a randomised, double-blinded and placebo-controlled 
study conducted in Chinese patients with “severe” COVID-19. The study was terminated early due to the 
epidemiological development and was therefore underpowered (power of 58%) compared to assumptions. At 
the time of study termination, 237 patients had been randomised.  
The primary clinical endpoint was time to clinical improvement. Clinical improvement was defined as a two-
point reduction in patients’ admission status on a six-point ordinal scale. Treatment with RDV/placebo was 
for 10 days.  
The median time to clinical improvement was 21 days for remdesivir versus 23 days for placebo. The HR (on 
a scale with values greater than 1.00 favouring remdesivir) was 1.23; p=0.24. Day 28 all-cause mortality 
rates were similar in the two treatment groups. Mortality rates were 22/158 (13.9%) for the remdesivir 
group versus 10/78 (12.8%) for the placebo group. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The identified quality issues concerning the active substance and finished product manufacture, the proposed 
control strategy for the active substance and finished product, and the in-use stability of the powder 
formulation, to be addressed through fulfilment of specific obligations, pose some uncertainties with regard 
to the batch to batch consistency between the product batches studied in pharmaceutical and (pre-)clinical 
development and future commercial batches. 
Clinical study reports are presently not available for any of the four RCTs. Hence, the assessment of effects 
presently lacks the generally required granularity. 
The efficacy demonstration rests on the NIAID-ACTT(1)-study. A complete follow-up with analyses of the 
data is missing for approximately 1/3 of the patients. Therefore, evaluation of the full 28-day all-cause 
mortality, has not been possible. 
Other issues including information on methods for maintenance of blinding, as well as the concomitant use of 
other agents with putative impact on COVID-19, such as corticosteroids, remains to be fully analysed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020 
Page 164/199 
 
 
  
 
Subgroup data from the NIAID-ACTT(1) study show no apparent beneficial effect of remdesivir in the most 
severely ill patients, i.e. those on invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation 
(IMV/ECMO) upon start of therapy. For the latter group an effect has neither been seen for the time to 
recovery (Rate Ratio 0.95) nor for mortality (HR: 1,06 as per data freeze 28th April 2020).  
Also, median time to recovery did not differ between remdesivir and placebo for the stratum of patients with 
mild/moderate disease. Furthermore, presently available data from the study -5774 do not suffice to draw 
conclusions on efficacy in these disease stages. A lack of blinding and an endpoint allowing considerable 
room for subjectivity, paired with uncertainties in the conduct of the primary analysis, render the results of 
this study not robust: The level of pre-specification of the SAP in the study -5774 is unclear (e.g., the 
Bonferroni alpha split between the RDV 5d vs SOC and RDV 10d vs SOC is mentioned in the SAP produced 
after database lock in this open label study, but not in the protocol). Even if the analysis in the SAP is 
accepted, the finding of a statistically significant difference of 5-day RDV vs SOC does not appear robust, as 
only the LOCF-imputed, but not the OC-analysis showed a statistically significant difference of 5 days 
remdesivir versus standard of care. Therefore, it is unclear whether this study is formally positive on its 
primary endpoint. 
The submitted data provide no clear picture on the duration of therapy. Studies -5773 and 5774 failed to 
show an advantage of the longer treatment. They may even be indicative of detrimental effect of longer use. 
It has to be pointed out, however, that less than 50% of the patients in each of these studies received a full 
10-day treatment course. And while the pivotal NIAID ACTT(1) study was designed to prove efficacy of a 10-
day treatment course, factually only one third of the patients received a full treatment course. Based on 
these data rather a 5-day treatment course appears generally indicated. Another uncertainty is the present 
lack of in-vivo proof of concept of anti SARS-CoV-2 activity.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety database for RDV is relatively large and satisfies ICH-E1 requirements. 1467 patients have 
received RDV for up to ten days (the maximal proposed duration) within randomised clinical trials in COVID-
19. A further 163 patients have been reported from the compassionate use program.  
Overall, RDV seems well tolerated, with less than 10% of patients discontinuing due to AE’s in the studies 
where information is available.  
In the NIAID-ACTT(1) study the most commonly reported grade 3/4 AE’s are anaemia, acute kidney injury 
and increased transaminases. There is no difference in frequency compared to placebo. The most common 
serious AE’s are respiratory failure and similar terms; such events are more common in the placebo arm. 
In Gilead Simple trial GS-US-540-5773 the overall rate and severity of AEs tended to be lower in the 
treatment group who received RDV for 5 days compared to the 10 days RDV group; however, the difference 
in AE’s here is clearly apparent already in the first 5 days where the assigned treatment is similar. Therefore, 
this is impacted by baseline differences in disease severity.  
Nausea, acute respiratory failure, ALT increased and constipation were the most reported PTs. The rate of 
most reported PTs was comparable between 5 days RDV group and 10 days RDV group (e.g. nausea, 
constipation, AST increased, hypokalaemia). The rate of study drug-related AEs (5 days RDV 17%, 10 days 
RDV 19%) and the rate of study-drug related SAEs (5 days RDV 2%, 10 days RDV 2%) were comparable 
between treatment groups. According to the provided interim report the most frequently reported study drug 
related AEs were nausea (5-days group 4.5 % vs. 10-days group 2.5%), ALT and AST increased (5-days 
group 4.5 % vs. 10-days group 11.2%), constipation (5-days group 1.5 % vs. 10-days group 1.5%), and 
vomiting (5-days group 2 % vs. 10-days group 0%). The rate of study-drug related SAEs (5-days RDV group 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020 
Page 165/199 
 
 
  
 
3 cases of transaminases increased [1.5%], 10-days group RDV 4 cases related to hepatic enzyme increased 
[2%]) was comparable between treatment groups. 
In Gilead Moderate Simple trial GS-US-540-5774 nausea, diarrhoea, hypokalaemia, headache, constipation 
and ALT increased were the most commonly reported AEs. The rates of most AEs were comparable between 
treatment groups. Hypokalaemia was more frequently reported in RDV 10-days group (6.7%) compared to 
RDV 5-days group (4.7%). Constipation (5-days group 4.2%, 10-days group 2.6%) and rash (5-days group 
3.7%, 10-days group 2.1%) were more commonly registered in the 5-days group. When comparing to the 
SOC group the following PTs were more frequently reported in the RDV groups: nausea, hypokalaemia, 
headache, hypotension and transaminase increased. The occurrence of SAEs was comparable between RDV 
groups. 
 Study drug-related AEs occurred in a higher frequency in RDV 5-days group (18.8%) compared to RDV 10-
days group (12.4%). According to the provided interim report the most frequently reported study drug 
related AEs were nausea (5-days group 6.8% vs. 10-days group 3.6%), ALT and AST increased (5-days 
group 6.3% vs. 10-days group 3.2%), headache (5-days group 2.1 % vs. 10-days group 1.6%), diarrhoea 
(5-days group 1.6% vs. 10-days group 1.6%), rash (5-days group 2.6 % vs. 10-days group 0.5%) and 
vomiting (5-days group 0.5 % vs. 10-days group 1.6%). In only one case the SAE was rated as study drug-
related (RDV 5-days group: heart rate decreased). 
In China trial CO-US-540-5758 AEs were in general comparable between RDV and placebo group. Only rash 
(7% vs. 3%) and thrombocytopenia (10% vs. 6%) were reported more frequently in the RDV group. SAEs 
were less reported in the RDV group compared to the placebo group. According to the publication, all deaths 
during the observation period were judged by the site investigators to be unrelated to the intervention.     
Regards to laboratory findings, overall, changes in ALT/AST, total bilirubin, haemoglobin, platelets, 
creatinine and hyperglycaemia were reported after treatment with RDV. However, due to missing causality 
assessment, missing information about medical history and concomitant medication as well as partially 
missing placebo group a profound assessment is not possible. 
In healthy volunteers, transaminitis was seen at multiple daily doses of 150 mg prompting a partial clinical 
hold by the FDA. This led to strict inclusion and discontinuation criteria in further clinical trials. Data from the 
clinical trials appear reassuring in this respect, but the applicant’s proposed monitoring seems relevant. 
Furthermore, there is a preclinical signal on renal tubular toxicity, which is not clearly noticeable in available 
clinical data. 
The warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC related to hypersensitivity reactions was added. Overall RDV seems 
adequately tolerated, also in severely ill patients.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
No integrated summary of safety has been presented, nor are there available CSR from any of the 
randomised controlled trials that are pivotal or supportive to the application. Therefore, in this respect, 
safety data are deemed non-comprehensive. Furthermore, the understanding of patient factors such as co-
morbidities, drug-drug interactions or disease severity, that may impact the tolerability of RDV, is 
incomplete. 
The findings of more side effects with 10 days of remdesivir versus 5 days in the 5773 study are uncertain 
since the difference is apparent also in the first five days of treatment when exposure to the drug is similar 
between arms. Further, notwithstanding the randomisation, patients in the 5-day arm were more severely ill 
at baseline in the ten-day arm. The findings, such as that of an increased rate of acute kidney injury with 
longer therapy, is not replicated in the 5774 study. Moreover, there is no increase in severe or serious renal 
events above placebo in the NIAID-ACTT(1) study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020 
Page 166/199 
 
 
  
 
There is, however, a nonclinical signal on renal tubular toxicity, which is not clearly noticeable in available 
clinical data. Given the limitations in available clinical safety data reporting, this remains an important 
potential risk, to be addressed in the RMP and further followed up post marketing. 
Due to the lack of a tQT study, or information on systematic ECG monitoring at supratherapeutic doses, the 
potential risk of QT prolongation is deemed incompletely characterised. Based on in vitro data, the 
torsadogenic risk should be low; however, the non-clinical safety pharmacology studies are also inconclusive 
due to low drug exposure. Although there are limitations in the safety data presentation, it is noted that 
clinical data do not give rise a concern about cardiac safety. 
Transaminitis is considered an identified risk, and to be addressed in the product information (Section 4.4 
and 4.8). Although there is no signal from the available data of severe hepatotoxicity or DILI, this is still 
considered an important potential risk, to be addressed in the RMP and further followed up post marketing. 
In addition, the risk of “Hypersensitivity including infusion related reaction” has been included as important 
identified risk in the RMP. 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC will to be updated after submitting CSRs and Module 2.7.4 with complete 
information about adverse reactions reported during clinical studies.  
The human mass balance study indicates presence of a currently unknown major metabolite M27 in plasma, 
and it is unknown if this metabolite is adequately covered in the nonclinical safety studies, or what is its 
interaction potential.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The high medical need for an effective agent for treatment of COVID-19 is undisputed. 
The identified quality issues discussed in this report and to be addressed through fulfilment of specific 
obligations, pose some uncertainties with regard to the batch to batch consistency between the product 
batches studied in pharmaceutical and (pre-)clinical development and future commercial batches. However, 
the submitted data indicate that currently manufactured batches are actually of a quality that is appropriate 
and comparable to that of clinical development batches. Considering the emergency context of this 
application the above identified quality issues are thus considered to be compatible with the granting of a 
CMA. However, to ensure that the quality of future batches will also remain appropriate and comparable to 
that of clinical development batches over the entire life cycle of the medicinal product these issues are 
expected to be addressed though fulfilment of specific obligations, within the defined due dates. 
The efficacy demonstration rests on preliminary data from the NIAID ACTT(1) study. The inferential analysis 
from this study shows that treatment with remdesivir results in a shorter time to recovery as compared to 
placebo. This effect is only evident in the stratum of patients with severe disease, where the difference in 
medians is 12 days for remdesivir versus 18 days for placebo. There was no indication of benefit in the 
stratum of patients with mild-moderate disease. At the present level of analysis, efficacy in such patients is 
neither considered to be supported by outcomes of the study -5774. Therefore, the indication is limited to 
those patients with COVID-19 pneumonia that require supplemental oxygen (patients with hypoxia, or 
symptoms of respiratory distress).  
The adverse effect reported seems generally mild and remdesivir seems well tolerated, also in severely ill 
patients. Hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity were determined as adverse events of special interest (AESIs).  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Due to its promising effects in animal models of coronavirus disease, the CHMP expressed an opinion 
according to article 83, regarding the compassionate use of this drug in the context of the COVID-19 
pandemic. Initially this was restricted to patients on IMV; however, after the presentation of top line data 
from the NIAID-ACTT(1) study confirming the efficacy of remdesivir, this opinion was expanded to cover all 
patients with severe COVID-19. 
Article 83 provides an CHMP opinion on compassionate use, the implementation of which is up to the member 
states, which have different legal provisions with respect to forms of emergency authorisation.  
In the present case, the applicant is not the sponsor of the pivotal trial. It has sponsored two of the 
supplemental trials; results from these trials have emerged during the rolling review of remdesivir, but no 
CSRs are presently available for any of the key studies. Therefore, the level of granularity as well as scrutiny 
of available data is lower than in the standard case. 
Recognising the need to ascertain a timely access to treatments in the context of the public health 
emergency of COVID-19, the CHMP considered that the CMA legislation provides the most appropriate EU 
regulatory tool to achieve this goal. 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020 
Page 170/199 
 
 
  
 
Thus, while available data allow for a conclusion on B/R, these are not deemed comprehensive in the sense of 
usual data requirements for a standard authorisation. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the non-
comprehensiveness of clinical data here relates to the non-availability of the data at the time of the 
application, rather than, as in the usual case of a CMA, limitations in the extent of data. These missing data 
will be submitted once studies are completed. Also, quality data is currently not comprehensive, but this has 
been found acceptable in the emergency context and will be complemented though fulfilment of specific 
obligations. 
Overall, in the context of a CMA a positive benefit/risk balance of remdesivir is considered adequately shown 
for patients with COVID-19 with pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen.   
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
As comprehensive data on the product are not available, a conditional marketing authorisation is relevant. 
The product falls within the scope of Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 concerning conditional 
marketing authorisations, as it aims at the treatment of a life-threatening disease. In addition, the COVID-19 
pandemic constitutes an emergency situation. It is a public health threat duly recognised by the World Health 
Organisation as well as the EU. 
Furthermore, the CHMP considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
authorisation: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive, as discussed. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data. The CHMP has identified specific 
obligations concerning pharmaceutical (quality), efficacy and safety data, which are expected to provide 
comprehensive data for this product. No concerns have been identified with the ability to complete these 
specific obligations, as the applicant has indicated that they consider respective due dates as feasible. In 
addition, the clinical studies from which clinical data has been requested are already ongoing. 
•  Unmet medical needs will be addressed, as currently there are no safe and effective medicinal products 
for the treatment of COVID-19 that would be approved in the European Union. 
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that 
additional data are still required. COVID-19 inarguably represents the most significant public health 
emergency of our time. In this context it is considered that the benefits to public health of the immediate 
availability of RDV outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that additional quality, efficacy and safety data 
are still required.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance for remdesivir is positive for the following indication: 
Veklury is indicated for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) in adults and adolescents 
(aged 12 years and older with body weight at least 40 kg) with pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen 
(see section 5.1). 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020 
Page 171/199 
 
 
  
 
As available data are non-comprehensive, granting of a conditional marketing authorisation is relevant, and 
in line with provisions of Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 it is supported. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Veklury is favourable in the following indication: 
Veklury is indicated for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) in adults and adolescents 
(aged 12 years and older with body weight at least 40 kg) with pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen 
(see section 5.1). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation subject to the 
following conditions: 
In view of the declared Public Health Emergency of International Concern and in order to ensure early supply, 
this medicinal product is subject to a number of quality related specific obligations. Implementation of these 
outstanding quality changes, including the necessary variations to the terms of the marketing authorisation, 
has to be completed by the 30 June 2021 at the latest, in line with the agreed plan for the update of the 
Quality dossier for this product. A progress report has to be included in the annual renewal application. 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription. (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product within 
6 months following authorisation (DLP 01/10/2020). 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP 
presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020 
Page 172/199 
 
 
  
 
 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Specific Obligation to complete post-authorisation measures for the conditional 
marketing authorisation  
This being a conditional marketing authorisation and pursuant to Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004, the MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the following measures: 
Description 
Due date 
In order to improve the impurity control strategy, lower the risk of 
 June 2021 
contamination and assure comprehensive control throughout the lifecycle of 
the product, the MAH should, as agreed, re-define the starting materials of 
active substance synthesis, update all dossier documentation accordingly and 
implement the re-defined starting materials. The corresponding variation 
application must be submitted no later than by August 2020. 
In order to ensure batch to batch consistency the MAH should expand 
 August 2020 
description of the active substance synthesis with more details regarding 
yields, process conditions, unambiguously specifying when each process stage 
is applicable, materials used and their specifications, and defining the batch 
size. Further, process parameter ranges should be further justified or 
tightened. 
In order to further substantiate the control strategy for the active substance 
 August 2020 
the MAH should further elaborate the impurities discussion with regard to the 
formation of potential impurities in the current and redefined starting 
materials, the representativeness of the active substance used in the 
toxicological programme versus the commercial product, the contamination of 
the active substance by elemental impurities, and the proposed justification 
regarding the suitability and adequateness of the proposed controls. 
In order to improve the control strategy for the active substance the MAH 
 August 2020 
should revise the active substance specification by including the parameter 
“microbial limits”, by revising the proposed limits for assay, impurities, residual 
solvents, and water in line with batch data and/ or relevant guidelines and Ph. 
Eur. as applicable, and confirm that the analytical method can control

New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that remdesivir is a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union

Appendix 
1. 
Descriptions of the issues related to the different studies included as Specific Obligations that should 
be addressed by the applicant   
Quality

1.  The applicant commits to redefine the starting materials 
In order to re-designate of the 
(the corresponding variation to be submitted by August 
starting materials  
Due date: June 2021  
2020, implementation to be completed by June 2021). 
The additional steps in the synthesis to be performed 
under GMP should improve the impurity control 
strategy, lower the risk of contamination and confirm 
appropriate control throughout the lifecycle of the 
medicinal product. In order to comply with the SOB the 
applicant is requested to consider the following:  
All dossier documentation should be updated 
accordingly. Information of the new starting materials, 
including their synthesis should be provided in dossier 
section S.2.3. It is outlined that additional starting 
material suppliers will be added post approval. Please 
note that not the supplier, but the manufacturer of the 
starting material should be included in the dossier. From 
the statement of the applicant, it cannot be concluded 
that the manufacturing synthesis of the starting 
materials remains unchanged. If the proposed additional 
starting material manufacturers use a substantially 
different route of synthesis or manufacturing conditions, 
with the short active substance synthesis currently 
used, this could change important quality characteristics 
of the active substance, such as qualitative and/or 
quantitative impurity profile or physico-chemical 
properties. Please note that additional starting material 
manufacturers would only be acceptable if the impurity 
profile of the active substance remains similar to that of 
active substance manufactured from material of the 
proposed starting material manufacturers. Adequate 
documentation in accordance with applicable regulatory 
requirements have to be provided in the course of a 
variation procedure. There is generally a high risk of 
formation and carry-over of impurities and 
contaminants potentially not covered by the proposed 
control strategy because of the sophisticated proposed 
starting material synthesis, which is not performed 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020

under GMP. Additionally, it has to be noted in this 
context that it is also not clear whether there are 
purification steps upstream of the proposed starting 
materials that are relevant for the final active substance 
impurity profile. In line with ICH Q11 Q&A #5.11 
addition of purification steps prior to a proposed starting 
material in order to avoid defining an earlier, upstream 
compound as the starting material would not be 
considered appropriate. 
2.  The active substance synthesis should be described in

consistency and thereby confirm the quality and safety 
of the medicinal product: 
Due date: August 2020 
a.  Yields for each stage of remdesivir synthetic step are 
missing and should be outlined. 
b.  Information on agitation conditions is missing and 
should be given.  
c.  The description of the manufacturing process includes 
the expression “optionally” at several stages. The 
manufacturing process description should reflect the 
production of the process validation batches and the 
manufacturing of future batches. Unless the optional 
procedures described in the process description 
presented in S.2.2 are covered in the process validation 
and have shown not to affect active substance quality, 
they should be removed from the process description.  
d.  The performed concentrations steps and the de-
agglomeration step should be described more in detail 
in the process description.  
e.  Filtration aids may be used for filtration and polish 
filtration may be used. If filtration aids and polish 
filtration is used, this should be clearly outlined in the 
process description and the filtration aids should also be 
reflected in the section control of materials.  
f.  Relevant amounts of materials, reagents and solvents 
are laid down in the process description with quite wide 
ranges. Information on proven acceptable ranges for the 
preparation of remdesivir is given in S.2.6. For each 
step and parameter information on lower PAR (proven 
acceptable range), lower operating range, upper 
operating range, upper PAR and Gilead Alberta set point 
is given. Data to these ranges have not been provided 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020

and furthermore interactions between parameters have 
not been studies. Please provide data, which confirm 
that active substance of adequate quality can be 
produced in the mentioned ranges. Otherwise, the 
operating ranges should be tightened to represent 
normal operating ranges, i.e. common operational 
variability.  
g.  Re-working procedures is not allowed and should not be 
included in the dossier. The information concerning 
rework procedures should be deleted.  
h.  The batch size for remdesivir active substance 
production should be clearly stated in dossier section 
S.2.2. 
i.  Adequate specifications for all solvents, recovered 
solvents (if applicable), reagents and auxiliary materials 
used in the manufacturing process are missing and 
should be provided. The specifications should include all 
quality relevant parameters (e.g. appearance, identity, 
assay, impurities). The active substance is used for 
parenteral use. The specification for water used in the 
last synthesis step should also include tests for microbial 
purity and endotoxins.

product: 
a.  The applicant should discuss potential impurities formed 
from reagents and solvents used in the manufacture of 
one of the starting materials. This should include, but 
not be limited to, a discussion of the potential presence 
of residual cyanide in the starting material.  
b.  The applicant should explain how a specified impurity is 
formed in the starting material synthesis. The risk of 
formation of other esters should also be addressed.  
c.  The applicant should discuss how it is assured that 
active substance used in the toxicological program, 
purified with chromatography rather than crystallisation, 
is representative of the active substance to be used in 
commercial product.  
d.  The capability of the process to purge a specified 
solvent to suitable levels should be demonstrated by the 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020

applicant. Alternatively, a control of DBU to acceptable 
levels should be implemented in the process.  
e.  The potential toxicity of two specified elemental 
impurities and risk of contamination of the active 
substance with unacceptable levels of the elements 
should be discussed by the applicant.  
f.  The applicant should discuss how it has been assured 
that the laboratory experiments performed to 
demonstrate the purging capacity for impurities and 
residual solvents of the process are representative of 
the commercial scale process with regards to e.g. 
efficiency in extractions, washings and crystallizations. 
It is acknowledged that removal of impurities is largely 
dependent on compound properties such as reactivity, 
solubility, volatility, and ionizability. However, the 
efficiency of removal could also depend on 
manufacturing scale and this should be addressed. 
Further, the number of experiments of which the data 
rely on should be disclosed.  
g.  The applicant should discuss the formation and control 
strategy for two identified potential impurities. 
h.  A justification for why no control of three reported 
expected degradation products is needed in the active 
substance should be provided.  
4.  The active substance specification should be revised in 
In order to revise active 
order to improve the control strategy and thereby 
substance specification 
confirm the quality and safety of the medicinal product: 
Due date: August 2020 
a.  The parameter “microbial limits” is considered not 
necessary by the applicant due to no significant 
bioburden at batch release and during stability. This 
argument is not followed as for sterile products the 
microbial quality of the active substance is an essential 
quality parameter. In consequence the test for microbial 
limits should be included in the specification with the 
option to perform this test as skip test.  
b.  The range for assay should be based on recent batch 
data rather than on theoretical considerations. 
Furthermore, total impurities levels should be taken into 
consideration as the specified range for assay and total 
impurities should correlate. The limit for “total 
impurities” should not solely be based on theoretical 
calculations, but also on recent batch data. 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020 
Page 179/199 
 
 
  
 
 
c.  The limits for impurities should not only be based on 
the maximum tolerable values found during 
toxicological studies but also on available batch data to 
ensure a consistently high-quality product.  If some 
limits are above the ICH identification or qualification 
threshold (0.10 resp. 0.15%) and are toxicologically 
justified, a higher limit is acceptable in the range of 
recent batch data. According to this, limits for two 
specific impurities and are accepted to be higher than 
ICH threshold, but should be lowered based on recent 
batch data (primarily to batches of the 5734-BC-series). 
The approach described by J. Harvey et. al. for setting 
an acceptable limit for unspecified impurities based on 
duration of dosing is not accepted in a marketing 
application. The specification limit for unknown 
impurities should be adjusted to comply with ICH Q3A 
and Ph. Eur. 2034 general monograph. Further, the 
control strategy for all the impurities stated to be 
controlled as unspecified impurities should be revisited.  
d.  The limits for residual solvents should be set with 
regard to option 1 of ICH guideline Q3C. Option 2 is 
only relevant, if the option 1 limit is not possible to set 
due to high solvent load of the active substance. As this 
is not the case for remdesivir, the proposed limits are 
not acceptable and should be lowered accordingly. 
e.  The values found for residual water are consistently far 
below the proposed limit at release and at shelf life. 
This should be reflected in the specification, i.e. the 
limit should be lowered to more data driven values. 
f. 
It is stated that impurities GS-832698 and GS-832699 
are controlled in the active substance as unspecified 
impurities. However, the analytical method used has 
not been validated with regards to the impurities. It 
should be confirmed that the analytical method used is 
able to detect GS-832698 and GS-832699 and that the 
impurities are thereby controlled as unspecified 
impurities in the active substance. 
g.  The limit for unspecified organic volatile impurities 
should be adjusted to comply with ICH Q3A and Ph. 
Eur. general monograph 2034.

a.  The level of betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium used 
should be justified by taking into account the content of 
the genotoxic impurity (1,4-butane sultone) in the 
betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium. 
b.  The applicant states that the batch size may be scaled 
up or down proportionally based on commercial demand 
or manufacturing site equipment capacity. This 
statement is not acceptable and should be deleted from 
the dossier. Any batch size outside of the range of the 
finally approved batch sizes should be applied for in the 
course of a variation procedure. Please note that 
respective process validation data would be needed 
since the finished product is manufactured according to 
a non-standard process (see assessor´s comment on 
4.1.2, P.2.3). 
c. 
It should be clarified whether or not both manufacturers 
manufacture each of the stated batch. 
d.  Mixer speed at in one of the two proposed 
manufacturing sites is not yet defined. Numerical 
acceptance criteria should be given. 
e.  Conditions of sterilisation of sterilising filters, glass vials 
and rubber stoppers should be included in the process 
description. 
f.  Type of material, nominal pore size and number of 
filters should be stated for non-sterilising and sterilising 
filters in contact with the finished product or 
components of the finished product. Moreover, it should 
be stated whether the used filters (again non-sterilising 
and sterilising) are intended for single or multiple use. 
Additionally, filter area should be referenced for 
sterilising filters. 
g.  Filter integrity test acceptance criteria should be given 
for sterilising filter. Moreover, filter integrity should not 
only be tested after, but also prior to sterilisation 
filtration. 
h.  The maximum time between the start of bulk solution 
preparation and end of sterile filtration should be stated. 
i.  Additionally, to total aseptic processing time information 
on the (sterile) bulk holding time before filling and on

j.  Equipment working capacity should be indicated for 
lyophilisation step. 
k.  Container closure integrity should be included as in-
process control. 
l.  Lyophilisation Process: Impact of Freezing Rate and 
Annealing Time on Quality Attributes and Manufacturing 
Efficiency should be discussed.  
m.  An actual process validation report is still missing and 
should be submitted. Especially information on sampling 
(where, when and how was sampling done) is relevant 
to assess the appropriateness of the presented data to 
validate the manufacturing processes at both proposed 
manufacturing sites. Please also note that appearance of 
remdesivir powder should be explicitly detailed and 
should not be reported as `conforms´ in order to allow 
evaluation of colour of the finished product- and 
reconstituted solution of the reported batches.

d.  The specified limits for impurities are higher than the 
guideline’s thresholds (ICH Q3B: reporting threshold 0.1 
%, identification threshold 0.2 %, qualification threshold 
0.2 % based on a maximum daily dose of 200 mg 
remdesivir). Proposed limits during release and shelf-life 
are either qualified by toxicological studies or the 
impurity is an (active) metabolite. The limits for 
specified degradation products and total impurities 
should be tightened based on actual batch- and stability 
results.  
e.  The set limit for unspecified degradation products (at 
release and during shelf-life) is higher than the 
guideline’s identification threshold (0.2%). This is 
generally not acceptable as this limit is applied for 
unknown impurities. The limit for unspecified 
degradation products should thus be lowered to NMT 
0.2%.

handling errors, different dilution regimens for the two 
dosage forms would not be acceptable without 
comprehensive justification.

c.  The specified limits for impurities are higher than the 
guideline’s thresholds (ICH Q3B: reporting threshold 0.1

should be based on actual batch- and stability results. 
d.  The set limit for unspecified degradation products (at

guideline’s identification threshold (0.2%). This is 
generally not acceptable as this limit is applied for 
unknown impurities. The limit for unspecified 
degradation products should thus be lowered to NMT

adolescents 12 years of age and older and weighing at 
least 40 kg with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). 
For adolescents weighing 40 kg the proposed endotoxin 
limit is too high and should be tightening (4.75 EU/mL is 
the highest acceptable endotoxin level for adolescent 
weighing 40kg).

c.  The factual blinding of the saline placebo at the study 
sites cannot be verified based on the available data. The 
applicant should clarify, which measures were taken at 
each of the study sites to maintain blinding of the study 
medication.  
d.  Information on blinding of the tubes is contradictory 
between the MOP and the NEJM publication. This should

assumption. 
k.  Please provide the results of the planned sensitivity 
analyses exploring subjects who recover but 
subsequently report a clinical score > 3. The 
completeness of follow-up after recovery needs to be 
reported to allow conclusions whether sufficient data are 
available for the sensitivity analyses to provide 
meaningful additional information. 
l. 
In the NEJM publication, there is an inconsistency 
between the results reported for the key secondary 
endpoint and the analysis of mortality reported in the 
supplementary material. In the analysis of the key 
secondary endpoint, 434 patients and 410 patients had 
baseline and day 15 score data in the remdesivir and 
the placebo group, respectively. However, according to 
the numbers of patients at risk at day 15 in the analysis 
of mortality, the numbers of patients known to be alive 
or died until day 15 were only 293 (260 at risk + 33 
died) and 305 (250 at risk + 55 died) in the remdesivir 
group and in the placebo group, respectively. This issue 
needs to be clarified before results can be considered as 
valid. 
m.  For the final analysis of the key secondary endpoint with 
complete follow-up, it is expected that reasons for 
missing data and frequency should be reported, and 
sensitivity analyses with missing data imputation 
including placebo based multiple imputation should be 
provided.

n.  While it is stated in the NEJM publication that data cutoff 
date was 22 April 2020, the reported figures with 
respect to recoveries do not match this date. As of April 
22, 2020 482 recoveries have been reported. However, 
in table 2 (p.8 of the article) 607 recoveries are 
reported. It is stated in the appendix to the article that 
database freeze occurred on April 28, 2020. However, 
even then there is a discrepancy between the resulting 
figures as compared to the 28th April DSMB dataset. 
This should be clarified 
o.  It should be clarified if stratified enrolment was 
maintained until data cutoff. 
p.  Number, type of and reasons for protocol deviations 
should be described. 
q.  The charta and all meeting minutes of the DSMB should 
be submitted. 
r. 
 The monitoring plan (with clear responsibilities) and the 
high-level summary of the major outcomes of the visits 
as individual site and visit data should be provided 
s.  The baseline characteristics as well as the results should 
be displayed according to region. 
t.  As prognosis for IVM and ECMO are clearly different, 
more specific information as to the numbers for each of 
these subgroups should be presented, i.e. how many 
patients per arm were on IVM, how many on ECMO and 
what was their outcome. 
u.  The Applicant should display duration of symptoms as 
effect modifier and provide subgroup analyses according 
to duration of symptoms prior to initiation of therapy, 
e.g. by using categories such as ≤ 7 days, between 8 
and ≤ 14 days and ≥ 15 days. 
v.  Concomitant medications at baseline and during the 
study should be reported. 
w.  Sensitivity analyses including only those discharged 
(and not deteriorating by day 29) should be provided. 
x.  Towards the end of the follow-up period of 29 days, the 
increases in recovery/discharge probability become 
smaller in both treatment groups such that a substantial 
proportion of patients is not yet released/recovered until 
day 29. This is probably partly explained by deceased 
patients who were censored at day 29. However, it may 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020 
Page 188/199 
 
 
  
 
also suggest that follow-up was too short for covering 
the complete time horizon of recovery. This issue should 
be clarified. 
y.  The reported mortality figures differ considerably 
between the report prepared for the DSMB (28th April 
2020) and the published data (same datafreeze date). 
The Applicant should clarify. 
z.  It should be explained how/if a potential deterioration of 
patients’ status (apart from death) after an initial 
improvement to categories 1,2 or 3 (defined as 
recovery) is accounted for. 
aa.  Sensitivity analyses should be conducted counting 
patients not recovered by day 29 (even if intermittently 
improved) as not recovered and this should be reflected 
accordingly in the analysis and KM-curve by censoring 
these patients at 29 days. 
bb.  The odds ratio resulting from the proportional odds 
model is difficult to interpret in terms of clinical 
relevance. In addition, the proportional odds assumption 
needs to be fulfilled. The cumulative probabilities for an 
outcome in a given category or worse allow an easier 
interpretation and should be provided (e.g. comparison 
of proportions of patients in the two worst categories 
‘death’ or ‘Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical 
ventilation or ECMO’ between treatment groups) 
cc.  The analysis of the change in NEWS score should be 
presented. 
dd.  The per protocol analysis should be presented for all 
endpoints. 
ee.  The applicant should commit to deliver the full virology 
report as part of the SOB to provide the CSR for this 
study. 
ff.  It has been shown that patients treated up to 10 days 
after symptom onset appeared to benefit slightly less 
than those, in whom symptom onset was more than 10 
days ago. Considering the experience with other 
antivirals, where “the earlier the better” is a paradigm, 
an explanation for this finding is lacking. The Applicant 
should explore this matter further by setting different 
cutoffs and as continuous variable as well as looking 
into potential cofactors. 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020

gg.  Based on the interim analysis, only one third of the 
patients has been treated with a full 10-day RDV 
treatment course. With the full analysis set this figure 
may increase to approximately 50% at most. 
Information, as to how the factual duration of therapy 
relates with outcomes is, however, missing. In view of 
the results of studies -5773 and -5774, indicative of 
similar or potentially even better outcomes with the 5-
day as compared to the 10-day regimen, this 
information is urgently required

The Applicant should clarify. 
c.  The charta and all meeting minutes of the DSMB should 
be submitted.  
d.  The monitoring plan (with clear responsibilities) and the 
high-level summary of the major outcomes of the visits 
as individual site and visit data should be provided. 
e.  The Applicant is requested to report the dates defining 
the periods of recruitment and follow-up. 
f.  The Applicant is requested to describe GCP inspection 
findings, if applicable.  
Assessment report

g.  The Applicant should clarify how many patients/sites 
were participating in Part A, as discrepant numbers have 
been provided 
h.  The Applicant is requested to present further details on 
comorbidities, eGFR as well as lab parameters predictive 
of outcome, such as CRP, lymphocyte count, D-dimer, 
and LDH at baseline (if available). In addition, figures 
describing the distribution of age, BMI and respiratory 
measures at baseline in both groups should be 
presented. 
i.  Concomitant use of the following is prohibited in 
participants receiving RDV However, according to listing 
16.2.4.5 (part-a-dmc-interim-tfls.pdf) a considerable 
number of patients received non study antiviral drugs: 
(hydroxy)chloroquine, LPV/rtv, DRV/rtv, DRV/cobi, 
tocilizumab, interferon-beta, ribavirin, or oseltamivir, for 
some patients more than one agent was given. 
Summary listings/statistics have not been presented. 
Hence, it is not clear, how their use was distributed 
between the study groups, when during the course of 
the study/RDV-therapy these were administered and in 
which patients/ which clinical status of the patients. 
Hence, it is entirely unclear, if/how this may have 
influenced the study outcomes. The Applicant should 
provide the missing information and critically discuss 
any potential impact of use of these agents on the study 
results  
j.  The applicant is requested to describe in more detail the 
exposure to study drug, the reason for stopping 
treatment earlier in both, the 5- and 10-day treatment 
group as well as descriptive statistics for the resulting 
subgroups. 
k.  The applicant is asked to provide evidence that the lack 
of blinding has not introduced bias. 
l.  Baseline imbalances, as observed for the baseline 
clinical status status (significant) and gender (non-
significant) indicating a shift to more cases in the 10-
day group with a worse prognosis, may have been 
resulted from a potential deviation from the 
randomization scheme questioning the integrity of this 
open-label trial. The applicant is asked to provide 
evidence that the randomization was followed correctly.  
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020 
Page 191/199 
 
 
  
 
m.  Due to the lack of blinding, protocol changes during the 
trial may have affected the integrity of the trial. The 
applicant is asked to provide evidence that the SAP 
(finalized at the end of the 28-day period) has not been 
informed by the outcome of the trial.   
n.  Since the trial was open-label the SAP and the change in 
the primary analysis could have been informed by the 
outcome in the trial. Hence, the primary analysis as 
specified in the protocol would have to be considered as 
the primary inferential analysis and should be provided.  
o.  The primary endpoint was changed during the conduct 
of this open trial. The amendment was done after the 
study had started: 
p.  Considering a study duration of 14 days, some of the 
participants had already completed the study and thus 
were only evaluated on a 6-scale ordinal scale. It is not 
clear, how this change was accounted for in hindsight. 
The Applicant should comment.  
q.  The applicant should clarify the status of the trial with 
respect to the number of included patients and those 
who completed the 14 days at the time of the 
corresponding amendment and at the time of 
implementation of the amendment. 
r.  Due to the open-label nature of the study, the ordinal 
scale must be considered to be prone to potential bias, 
as neither objective criteria for the categorisation nor 
for discharge have been stated. Hence, it is in the full 
discretion of the investigators/study personnel. The 
Applicant should comment, if/which measures were 
taken to reduce bias in outcome assessment. 
s.  For the assessment of a public health benefit in the 
context of a CMA, the relevance of the primary endpoint 
is not clear (can any impact on health system resources 
be deduced from it?). Moreover, a single assessment of 
the patient’s status on a given day/at a given time may 
be of questionable clinical relevance in view of the 
sometimes fluctuating course of disease. The Applicant 
should critically discuss these aspects. 
t.  The Applicant should comment, if apart from “time to 
first negative SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR)” any other virological assessment has been 
undertaken/is foreseen. 
Assessment report  
EMA/357513/2020 
Page 192/199 
 
 
  
 
u.  The evaluation of the validity of the proportionality 
assumption and the consequences for a potential 
change in the primary analysis remains unclear. The 
Applicant should comment and provide the comparison 
of cumulative proportions using different cut-offs in 
addition.  
v.  The applicant is asked to clarify the exact day of the 
data cut used for the primary analysis. 
w.  According to the protocol, missing data were not 
planned to be imputed and neither an estimand of 
interest nor any imputation method was specified. On 
the other hand, however, the SAP mentions that missing 
data imputation via LOCF was performed. The applicant 
should provide a justification and give a table on the 
number of patients by the last day at which the clinical 
status was known, treatment and clinical status at that 
day (where the reason for Hospital Discharge is not 
“Discharged Alive” and the subject has not died). 
Furthermore, sensitivity analyses using a longitudinal 
generalized linear mixed-effect model should be 
provided.  
x.  In the 10-day treatment group only 43% (44% 
according to the publication) of the patients received 
remdesivir for 10 days and 33% in this group received 
only a 5-day course. While for 52% of the patients the 
reasons were stopping early are described, information 
for 4% is missing and should be provided. 
y.  The applicant is asked to provide a clinical reasoning for 
the non-monotone dose (duration)-response. 
z.  The Applicant should provide data on the primary 
endpoint as well as mortality for the subgroups of 
patients on IMV/ECMO at baseline and no IMV/ECMO at 
baseline  
aa.  To allow comparison of the results of the different 
studies, time to recovery, 14-day and 28-day mortality 
should be presented according to baseline disease 
score. 
bb.  So far, all presented efficacy analyses are based on the 
full analysis set. The per-protocol analysis should be 
provided. 
cc.  According to listing 16.2.6 some patients were recorded 
as “score 7”, while still in hospital and with need for

ongoing medical care or supplemental oxygen. The 
Applicant should clarify the cause for this ambiguous 
classification and the potential impact on the study 
results. 
dd.  Results were presented according to the three 
categories USA, Italy and Ex-Italy. This is an unusual 
way of displaying the data and obviously Italy stands as 
a proxy for worse outcome. The results in the different 
“countries” should be put in perspective with differences 
in baseline values and any other factors potentially 
influencing treatment outcome. 
ee.  The primary and secondary results should be displayed 
according to geographical region, i.e. North America, 
Europe, Asia 
ff.  The total numbers used in Table 44 do not fully match 
the fígures given in Table 15.9.1.2.1: “Clinical Status 
(7-Point Ordinal Scale) by Study Day” of the Interim 
Report of Study 5773, showing slightly higher numbers 
in all categories (n=42 for IMV/10d, n= 36 for high-flow 
O2/10d, n=70 for low-flow O2/5d, n=62 for for low-flow 
O2/10d, n= 37 for room air/5d). Table 15.9.1.2.1 
suggests that the missing 17 patients may relate to 
those patients that discontinued the study before day 5, 
but this remains unclear. The applicant is asked to 
clarify 
gg.  Results are presented in the posthoc evaluation on

hh.  They suggest that conditional on not dying or being 
discharged until day 5 no difference is seen between 
both regimens with a numerical advantage for the 10d 
regimen in the IMV group (re. mortality and re. the 
overall OR). However, since 17 patients appear to be 
missing in the evaluation (see above), no complete 
appreciation of this finding is possible. The applicant is 
asked to explain. 
ii. 
 The regimen was known to the investigator from the 
beginning and baseline imbalances suggest that study 
populations differ right from the beginning. This may 
have introduced bias in the post-hoc analysis due to a 
potentially treatment dependent selection of the 
analysis population with respect to study discontinuation 
and discharge. The applicant is asked to clarify if the

results of the post-hoc analysis can still be used to 
support the proposed indication and treatment duration.

Due date: December 2020 
was changed on April 6, 2020, one month after study 
start. Considering a study duration of up to 11 days, 
some of the participants had already completed the 
study and thus were only evaluated with regard to 
hospital discharge. It is not clear, how this change was 
accounted for in hindsight. The Applicant should 
comment. 
c.  Due to the open-label nature of the study, the ordinal 
scale must be considered prone to potential bias, as 
neither objective criteria for the categorisation nor for 
discharge have been stated. Hence, it is in the full 
discretion of the investigators. The Applicant should 
comment, if/which measures were taken to reduce bias 
in outcome assessment. 
d.  For the assessment of a public health benefit in the 
context of a CMA, the relevance of the primary endpoint 
is not clear (can any impact on health system resources 
be deduced from it?). The Applicant should comment. 
e.  Moreover, a single assessment of the patient’s status on 
a given day/at a given time may be of questionable 
clinical relevance (durability of response) in view of the 
sometimes fluctuating course of disease. The Applicant 
should comment.  
f.  The primary endpoint was changed during the conduct 
of this open trial. The applicant should clarify the status 
of the trial with respect to the number of included 
patients and those who completed the 11 days at the

time of the corresponding amendment and at the time 
of implementation of the amendment. 
g.  Missing data were replaced by last observation carried 
forward for the ordinal scale. Replacement of missing 
data was specified only in the SAP, while the protocol 
stated that “in general, values for missing data will not 
be imputed.”. The influence of missing data handling on 
the conclusions from the study requires should be 
critically discussed. 
h.  It should be described whether measures were in place 
to ensure that persons in charge of protocol 
amendments and SAP have no knowledge of results 
from the ongoing study, and respective documentation 
should be provided. In addition, as some kind of review 
of data from the ongoing study was obviously conducted 
before finalizing the SAP, the respective review report 
needs to be provided. In particular, information on the 
data that were available for blinded review should be 
reported.  
i.  As the statistical testing and confidence interval should 
be consistent, nominal 97.5% confidence intervals 
(corresponding to adjusted 95% confidence intervals) 
should be reported. 
j.  Although the proportional odds model can be considered 
appropriate for testing the null hypothesis, the resulting 
proportional odds ratio is difficult to interpret in terms of 
clinical relevance. Clinical relevance needs to be 
evaluated in alternative ways, for example by 
comparing the cumulative proportions for observing 
clinical status of a given category or a better one 
between treatment groups, which should be provided. 
In addition, it is unclear what was the role of testing the 
proportional odds assumption. The Applicant should 
comment. 
k.  Patients from RDV groups who were not treated, were 
excluded from analysis. This is not in compliance with 
the ITT principle. The reasons for not treating patients 
should be reported and analyses including these 
patients should be provided. 
l.  Protocol deviation classified as important by the 
applicant were overall few and occurring most

frequently in the SOC-group. The Applicant should also 
present a summary listing of all protocol deviations. 
m.  Important information on administrative aspects (e.g. 
responsibilities for data management, statistics, IRT, 
randomisation, medical writing, etc) is missing. The 
Applicant is requested to present this information. 
n.  The charta and all meeting minutes of the DSMB should 
be submitted.  
o.  The monitoring plan (with clear responsibilities) and the 
high-level summary of the major outcomes of the visits 
as individual site and visit data should be provided. 
p.  The Applicant is requested to describe GCP inspection 
findings, if applicable. 
q.  One inclusion criterion was that patients had to have a 
SaO2> 94%. The Applicant should clarify, why, 
nonetheless, supplemental oxygen was required by 16% 
of the participants at baseline. 
r.  With respect to the study data from the US-sites some 
differences with the overall population are noted. 
Whites, participants younger than 50 years or older 
than 75 years, as well as patients requiring low flow 
oxygen were more likely to be in the 10-day RDV group. 
Duration of symptoms prior to study day 1 was 
significantly shorter in the 10-day group (P=0.0035). In 
view of these findings the applicant is asked to explain 
whether and how a deviation from the randomization 
scheme can be excluded. 
s. 
It should be clarified, how many adolescents were 
included in this study. 
t.  Use of any agent with putative antiviral activity for 
SARS-CoV-2 was prohibited. However, information on 
concomitant use of other antiviral medications is 
missing and should be provided. 
u.  For comparability of the results (even though the 
endpoint differs in terms of its timing), time to recovery 
should be analysed according to baseline disease score. 
v.  In the 5-day and 10-day RDV group, 2 patients pre-
maturely discontinued from study due to death but no 
deaths occurred for the 5-day RDV group in the analysis 
of clinical status at day 11. It is unclear when these 
deaths occurred. According to Table 15.9.2.9.1 Interim

Analysis, after day 11, 2 patients died in the 5-day RDV 
group, emphasizing the problem that 14-day mortality is 
not informative. Therefore, 28-day mortality data should 
be presented. 
w.  To allow comparison of the results of the different 
studies, time to recovery, 14-day and 28-day mortality 
should be presented according to baseline disease 
score. 
x.  So far, all presented efficacy analyses are based on the 
full analysis set. The per-protocol analysis should be 
provided as well. 
y.  One of the exploratory endpoints is related to SARS-
CoV-2 PCR negativity. However, the timing when this 
endpoint should be evaluated remains unclear, i.e. day 
5, 10 and/or 11. 
z.  The initial exploratory endpoint of “time to first negative 
SARS-CoV-2 PCR” was changed with protocol 
amendment 2 on April 29, 2020. It should be clarified if 
samples were to be taken from all sites/patients and the 
analysis for the initially specified endpoint should be 
provided as well.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This application is for marketing authorisation of Arsenic trioxide Mylan 1 mg/ml concentrate for solution for 
infusion and is based on Directive 2001/83/EC Article 10 (1): a generic application, referring to the reference 
Trisenox 1 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion of Teva B.V. which has been authorised in accordance 
with Union provisions in force for not less than 10 years in the EEA. Trisenox 1 mg/ml concentrate for 
solution for infusion was first authorised within the EU on the 05-03-2002 under registration number 
EU/1/02/204/001. 
The mechanism of action of arsenic trioxide is not completely understood. Arsenic trioxide causes 
morphological changes and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis in NB4 
human promyelocytic leukaemia cells in vitro. Arsenic trioxide also causes damage or degradation of the 
fusion protein Pro-Myelocytic Leukaemia/Retinoic Acid Receptor-alpha (PML/RAR alpha). 
The reference product Trisenox is indicated as a monotherapy or in combination with other anticancer 
products in treatment of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). The currently approved indication for Trisenox 
is as follows: 
Trisenox is indicated for induction of remission, and consolidation in adult patients with: 
• Newly diagnosed low-to-intermediate risk acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) (white blood cell count, ≤10 
x 103/µl) in combination with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) 
• Relapsed/refractory acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) (previous treatment should have included a 
retinoid and chemotherapy) 
characterised by the presence of the t(15;17) translocation and/or the presence of the promyelocytic 
leukaemia/retinoic-acid-receptor-alpha (PML/RAR-alpha) gene.

The response rate of other acute myelogenous leukaemia subtypes to arsenic trioxide has not been 
examined. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as concentrate for solution for infusion containing 1 mg/mL of arsenic 
trioxide as active substance.  
Other ingredients are:  Sodium hydroxide 
Hydrochloric acid (as pH adjuster) 
Water for injections 
The finished product is available in Type I clear glass vial closed with bromobutyl stoppers and with 
aluminium flip-off caps as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
Arsenic trioxide is not described in the European Pharmacopoeia, pharmacopoeias of the Member States or 
USP. The documentation on the active substance is presented using an Active Substance Master File (ASMF) 
procedure.  
The ASMF has been assessed as part of an EU ASMF work sharing procedure as a daughter procedure. The 
ASMF is registered with the number EU/ASMF/00235/0001. The information provided in the Applicant’s and 
Restricted parts of the ASMF are considered sufficient to support the marketing authorisation application for 
the finished product. 
General information 
The chemical name of arsenic trioxide is diarsenic trioxide corresponding to the molecular formula As2O3. It 
has a relative molecular mass of 197.84 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
The chemical structure and solid-state properties of arsenic trioxide were elucidated by a combination of 
Crystallography (XRD), Thermogravimetric analysis, Hygroscopy and IR spectroscopy.  
Arsenic trioxide is a white to an off-white non-hygroscopic powder, practically insoluble to sparingly soluble in 
water, soluble in solutions of alkali hydroxides (NaOH 1M). Practically insoluble in ethanol, chloroform and 
ethyl ether. It does not contain any sterocentres. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/638190/2019 
Page 8/17 
  
  
 
Arsenic trioxide exhibits polymorphism. Given that the active substance is to be formulated into a 
concentrate for solution for infusion, the absence of controls for polymorphism is considered acceptable. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of 
the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Arsenic trioxide is synthesized from the starting material elementary arsenic.  
Adequate  in-process  controls  are  applied  during  the  synthesis.  The  specifications  and  control  methods  for 
starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The  characterisation  of  the  active  substance  and  its  impurities  are  in  accordance  with  the  EU  guideline  on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised. A discussion on genotoxic impurities was not provided, however this was considered 
acceptable, since the active substance itself is genotoxic and the impurities are unlikely to pose a significant 
additional genotoxic risk.  
Arsenic  trioxide  is  packed  in  high-density  polyethylene  bottle  with  a  plastic  closure  as  a  primary  container. 
Bottles  with  integrated  tamper  evidence  ring  are  placed  in  a  sealed  polyethylene  bag  used  as  secondary 
packaging. The packaging material complies with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, solubility (Ph. Eur.), identity (chemical, 
HPLC), appearance of solution (Ph. Eur.), pH of solution (Ph. Eur.), assay (titration), metallic arsenic content 
(gravimetric), Arsenic pentoxide (As2O5) content (HPLC), loss on drying (Ph Eur), metallic impurities (ICP-
OES), iron content (ICP-OES), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and microbiological analysis (Ph. Eur.). 
Impurities limits have been justified and appropriate specifications have been set. The analytical methods 
used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and 
impurities testing has been presented. 
With regards to elemental impurities, no other metals are intentionally added. As the active substance is to 
be used in parenteral formulation, elemental impurities are controlled in the active substance specification, in 
line with the ICH Q3D guideline. Other potential impurities from arsenic powder are not controlled in the 
active substance but are controlled in the starting material specification.  
Batch analysis data (three full scale batches) of the active substance are provided. The results are within the 
specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data was provided from three production scale batches of active substance from the proposed 
manufacturer stored in the intended commercial packaging for up to 24 months at long-term (25±2°C 
60±5% RH), intermediate  (30ºC / 75% RH) storage conditions and for up to 6 months at accelerated 
conditions (40±2°C 75±5%) RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/638190/2019 
Page 9/17 
  
  
The parameters tested are the same as for release. The analytical methods used were the same as for 
release and were stability indicating. All tested parameters were within the specifications. 
Forced degradation study (stress testing) has been performed and confirmed that the HPLC method is 
stability indicating. 
Photostability testing in line with the ICH Q1B guideline was not presented, however the proposed storage 
conditions to protect the substance from light are supported by stress testing results where photolytic 
degradation was confirmed. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The proposed retest period and storage conditions are justified. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a concentrate for solution for infusion containing 1 mg/mL arsenic trioxide as active 
substance. The concentrate contains sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid, water for injection. Nitrogen is 
used as processing agent. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The goal of pharmaceutical development was to develop a generic formulation of arsenic trioxide which is 
bioequivalent to the reference product Trisenox 1 mg/ml, which was approved by EMA in 2002 throughout 
the European Union. The finished product is preservative free and has been developed as a sterile, non-
pyrogenic, clear solution. 
Based on information including composition, ingredients, container closure and product development a quality 
target product profile (QTPP) was established. 
Based on the QTPP process parameters were assessed for criticality with respect to the critical quality 
attributes (CQA) for the formulation and process development of the finished product. A comparison of the 
formulation in development with the formulation of reference product Trisenox was completed.  
The manufacturing process development is discussed in detail. The bulk solution is filled into primary 
packaging and followed by terminal sterilization. The time and temperature conditions for the terminal 
sterilisation is ≥121°C for >15 minutes in line with Reference Cycle as per Ph. Eur. 5.1.1.  
The critical steps and in-process control were validated during the manufacture of three validation batches of 
industrial scale. 
The primary packaging is Type I clear glass vial (Ph. Eur.) closed with bromobutyl stoppers and with 
aluminium flip-off caps. The materials comply with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container 
closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
• 
The manufacturing process consists of six main steps: Step I Bulk solution preparation 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/638190/2019 
Page 10/17 
  
  
•  Step II Pre-filtration into a storage vessel 
•  Step III Vial filling process  
•  Step IV Terminal sterilization of the filled vials in an autoclave 
•  Step V Visual inspection of the vials 
•  Step VI Labeling and secondary packaging 
The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
The critical steps have been defined. These critical steps are monitored by respective in-process controls. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. The process validation 
was carried out on 3 consecutive production scale batches. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing 
process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-
process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process & pharmaceutical form.  
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications shown include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form; 
appearance, identification (HPLC, chem), pH (Ph. Eur.), extractable volume (Ph. Eur.), particulate matter (Ph. 
Eur.),  visible particulates (Ph. Eur.), related substances (HPLC),  assay (HPLC), sterility (Ph. Eur.) and 
bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.). 
The finished product is released on the based on the above release specifications, through traditional final 
product release testing. The limits for impurities are in accordance with ICH Q3B (R2). 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-based 
approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data using a validated 
ICP-MS method was provided, demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity was not detected above 
30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment and the presented batch data it can be concluded 
that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls. The information on the control of 
elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities 
testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three batches of finished product stored for up to 12 months at long-term 
(25°C±2°C/60%±5% RH, 30°C±2°C/65%±5% RH) and at 2-8°C, and stability data up to 6 months at 
accelerated (40°C±2°C/ 75%±5% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of 
medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging 
proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for in line with the shelf life specifications. The analytical procedures used are stability 
indicating. All results comply with the shelf-life specifications. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/638190/2019 
Page 11/17 
  
  
A photostability study has been conducted according to conditions of ICH Q1B. The finished product exposed 
to the conditions in clear glass vials and exposed when packaged in its secondary packaging, remained stable 
and there are no significant differences to the dark control sample. 
The results of an in-use stability study of the finished product diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride and 5% 
glucose infusion media has confirmed stability up to 48 hours stored at 2-8°C and up to 24 hours stored at 
15°C-25°C. This information is included in section 6.3 of the SmPC. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of shelf-life of 24 stored in the original container with 
no special storage conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress and to 
investigate the risk of presence of nitrosamine in their medicinal products, the CHMP recommends the 
following points for investigation: 
• 
It is recommended that an updated risk evaluation on the potential presence of nitrosamine 
impurities in Arsenic trioxide Mylan is conducted within six months of the marketing authorisation. In 
the event that a risk of presence of nitrosamines is identified as a result of the risk evaluation, 
confirmatory testing should be carried out using appropriately validated and sensitive methods within 
a year after the marketing authorisation or at an earlier time if otherwise justified. If nitrosamine 
impurities are found to be present, appropriate risk mitigation steps should be implemented. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is 
based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/638190/2019 
Page 12/17 
  
  
generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical 
aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been 
discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required. 
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment studies were submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Arsenic trioxide Mylan manufactured by Mylan Ireland Limited is considered unlikely to result 
in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all arsenic trioxide containing products and the 
exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar. 
2.3.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP is of the opinion that the applicant has justified the absence of non-clinical studies based on the 
literature review and the claim that Arsenic trioxide Mylan is a generic of the reference product Trisenox. The 
literature data presented in the dossier is considered acceptable and sufficient for the assessment of non-
clinical aspects of Arsenic trioxide Accord in the applied indications. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as 
efficacy and safety of arsenic trioxide based on published literature. The SmPC is in line with the SmPC of the 
reference product. 
No CHMP scientific advice pertinent to the clinical development was given for this medicinal product.  
For the clinical assessment the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98) is 
relevant.  
Exemption  
This is a generic application for a medicinal product supplied as a concentrate for solution for infusion in glass 
vials  for  single  use.  According  to  the  Appendix  II  of  the  Guideline  on  the  investigation  of  Bioequivalence 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98  Rev.  1/Corr**):  “Bioequivalence  studies  are  generally  not  required  if  the  test 
product is to be administered as aqueous intravenous solution containing the same active substance as the 
currently approved product”. No bioequivalence study was conducted, and none is required, since the product 
is to be administered as an aqueous solution for injection for intravenous administration containing the same 
active substance in the same concentrations, the same pharmaceutical form and route of administration as the 
currently  authorised  reference  medicinal  product.  In  addition,  Arsenic  trioxide  Mylan  contains  the  same 
excipients  as  the  reference  medicinal  product  and  the  excipients  are  not  known  to  interact  with  the  drug 
substance or to otherwise affect the disposition of the drug substance. 
Therefore, for the current generic application, the essential similarity with the reference medicinal product is 
only based on pharmaceutical equivalence, which is accepted by the CHMP.

2.4.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application.  
2.4.3.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
No bioequivalence study was submitted to support the application and this is acceptable as being in 
accordance with the Appendix II to the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr **). 
Arsenic trioxide Mylan is considered essentially similar to Trisenox Teva B.V. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
A summary of the literature with regard to clinical data of Arsenic trioxide Mylan and justifications that the 
active substance does not differ significantly in properties with regards to safety and efficacy of the reference 
product was provided and was accepted by the CHMP. This is in accordance with the relevant guideline and 
additional clinical studies were not considered necessary.

Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.7.  Product information 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the basis of 
two bridging reports making reference to Trisenox and Tranexamic Acid Mylan. The bridging reports 
submitted by the applicant has been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of Arsenic trioxide Mylan 1 mg/ml concentrate for solution for 
infusion. The indication of the reference product Trisenox is as follows:  
Trisenox is indicated for induction of remission, and consolidation in adult patients with: 
• Newly diagnosed low-to-intermediate risk acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) (white blood cell count, ≤10 
x 103/µl) in combination with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) 
• Relapsed/refractory acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) (previous treatment should have included a 
retinoid and chemotherapy) 
characterised by the presence of the t(15;17) translocation and/or the presence of the promyelocytic 
leukaemia/retinoic-acid-receptor-alpha (PML/RAR-alpha) gene.

Page 15/17 
  
  
 
The response rate of other acute myelogenous leukaemia subtypes to arsenic trioxide has not been 
examined.  
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available 
nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical 
perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as 
well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical 
aspects based on information from published literature was considered sufficient. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference 
medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those 
included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus decision 
that the benefit-risk balance of Arsenic trioxide Mylan is favourable in the following indication: 
“Arsenic trioxide Mylan is indicated for induction of remission, and consolidation in adult patients with: 
•  Newly diagnosed low-to-intermediate risk acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) (white blood 
cell count, ≤10 x 103/µl) in combination with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) 
•  Relapsed/refractory acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) (previous treatment should have 
included a retinoid and chemotherapy) 
characterised by the presence of the t(15;17) translocation and/or the presence of the promyelocytic 
leukaemia/retinoic-acid-receptor-alpha (PML/RAR-alpha) gene. 
The response rate of other acute myelogenous leukaemia subtypes to arsenic trioxide has not been 
examined”.  
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following

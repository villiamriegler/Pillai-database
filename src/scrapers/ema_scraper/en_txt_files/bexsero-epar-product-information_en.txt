CLINICAL PARTICULARS  
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
Bexsero is indicated for active immunisation of individuals from 2 months of age and older against 
invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis group B. The impact of invasive 
disease in different age groups as well as the variability of antigen epidemiology for group B strains in 
different geographical areas should be considered when vaccinating. See section 5.1 for information 
on protection against specific group B strains. The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with 
official recommendations.

The first dose should be given no earlier than 2 months of age. The safety and efficacy of 
Bexsero in infants less than 8 weeks of age has not yet been established. No data are available. 
In case of delay, the booster should not be given later than 24 months of age. 
See section 5.1. The need for and timing of further booster doses has not yet been determined. 
See section 5.1. 
There are no data in adults above 50 years of age. 
Method of administration 
The vaccine is given by deep intramuscular injection, preferably in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh 
in infants or in the deltoid muscle region of the upper arm in older subjects. 
Separate injection sites must be used if more than one vaccine is administered at the same time. 
The vaccine must not be injected intravenously, subcutaneously or intradermally and must not be 
mixed with other vaccines in the same syringe. 
For instructions on the handling of the vaccine before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications

Traceability 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
As with other vaccines, administration of Bexsero should be postponed in subjects suffering from an 
acute severe febrile illness. However, the presence of a minor infection, such as cold, should not result 
in the deferral of vaccination. 
Do not inject intravascularly. 
As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be 
readily available in case of an anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. 
Anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress-related 
reactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection 
(see section 4.8). It is important that procedures are in place to avoid injury from fainting. 
This vaccine should not be given to individuals with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder 
that would contraindicate intramuscular injection, unless the potential benefit clearly outweighs the 
risk of administration. 
As with any vaccine, vaccination with Bexsero may not protect all vaccine recipients.  
Bexsero is not expected to provide protection against all circulating meningococcal group B strains 
(see section 5.1). 
As with many vaccines, healthcare professionals should be aware that a temperature elevation may 
occur following vaccination of infants and children (less than 2 years of age). Prophylactic 
administration of antipyretics at the time of and closely after vaccination can reduce the incidence and 
intensity of post-vaccination febrile reactions. Antipyretic medication should be initiated according to 
local guidelines in infants and children (less than 2 years of age). 
Individuals with impaired immune responsiveness, whether due to the use of immunosuppressive 
therapy, a genetic disorder, or other causes, may have reduced antibody response to active 
immunisation. 
Immunogenicity data are available in individuals with complement deficiencies, asplenia, or splenic 
dysfunctions (see section 5.1). 
Individuals with familial complement deficiencies (for example, C3 or C5 deficiencies) and 
individuals receiving treatments that inhibit terminal complement activation (for example, eculizumab) 
are at increased risk for invasive disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis group B, even if they 
develop antibodies following vaccination with Bexsero. 
There are no data on the use of Bexsero in subjects above 50 years of age and limited data in patients 
with chronic medical conditions. 
The potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48-72 hours should be 
considered when administering the primary immunisation series to very premature infants 
(born ≤ 28 weeks of gestation) and particularly for those with a previous history of respiratory 
immaturity. As the benefit of vaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination should not 
be withheld or delayed. 
Kanamycin is used in early manufacturing process and is removed during the later stages of 
manufacture. If present, kanamycin levels in the final vaccine are less than 0.01 micrograms per dose. 
The safe use of Bexsero in kanamycin-sensitive individuals has not been established. 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-free’.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Use with other vaccines 
Bexsero can be given concomitantly with any of the following vaccine antigens, either as monovalent 
or as combination vaccines: diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b, 
inactivated poliomyelitis, hepatitis B, heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate, measles, mumps, rubella, 
varicella, and meningococcal groups A, C, W, Y conjugate. 
Clinical studies demonstrated that the immune responses of the co-administered routine vaccines were 
unaffected by concomitant administration of Bexsero, based on non-inferior antibody response rates to 
the routine vaccines given alone. Inconsistent results were seen across studies for responses to 
inactivated poliovirus type 2 and pneumococcal conjugate serotype 6B and lower antibody titers to the 
pertussis pertactin antigen were also noted, but these data do not suggest clinically significant 
interference. 
Due to an increased risk of fever, tenderness at the injection site, change in eating habits and 
irritability when Bexsero was co-administered with the above vaccines, separate vaccinations can be 
considered when possible. Prophylactic use of paracetamol reduces the incidence and severity of fever 
without affecting the immunogenicity of either Bexsero or routine vaccines. The effect of antipyretics 
other than paracetamol on the immune response has not been studied. 
Concomitant administration of Bexsero with vaccines other than those mentioned above has not been 
studied. 
When given concomitantly with other vaccines Bexsero must be administered at separate injection 
sites (see section 4.2). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy 
Insufficient clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. 
The potential risk for pregnant women is unknown. Nevertheless, vaccination should not be withheld 
when there is a clear risk of exposure to meningococcal infection. 
There was no evidence of maternal or foetal toxicity, and no effects on pregnancy, maternal behaviour, 
female fertility, or postnatal development in a study in which female rabbits received Bexsero at 
approximately 10 times the human dose equivalent based on body weights. 
Breast-feeding 
Information on the safety of the vaccine to women and their children during breast-feeding is not 
available. The benefit-risk ratio must be examined before making the decision to immunise during 
breast-feeding. 
No adverse reactions were seen in vaccinated maternal rabbits or in their offspring through day 29 of 
lactation. Bexsero was immunogenic in maternal animals vaccinated prior to lactation, and antibodies 
were detected in the offspring, but antibody levels in milk were not determined. 
Fertility 
There are no data on fertility in humans. 
There were no effects on female fertility in animal studies.

4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Bexsero has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the 
effects mentioned under section 4.8 “Undesirable effects” may temporarily affect the ability to drive or 
use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety of Bexsero was evaluated in 17 studies including 10 randomised controlled clinical trials 
with 10 565 subjects (from 2 months of age) who received at least one dose of Bexsero. Among 
Bexsero recipients, 6 837 were infants and children (less than 2 years of age), 1 051 were children 
(2 to 10 years of age) and 2 677 were adolescents and adults. Of the subjects who received primary 
infant series of Bexsero, 3 285 received a booster dose in the second year of life.   
In infants and children (less than 2 years of age) the most common local and systemic adverse 
reactions observed in clinical trials were tenderness and erythema at the injection site, fever and 
irritability. 
In clinical studies in infants vaccinated at 2, 4 and 6 months of age, fever (≥ 38 °C) was reported 
by 69% to 79% of subjects when Bexsero was co-administered with routine vaccines (containing the 
following antigens: pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate, diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, hepatitis 
B, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenzae type b) compared with 44% to 59% of 
subjects receiving the routine vaccines alone. Higher rates of antipyretic use were also reported for 
infants vaccinated with Bexsero and routine vaccines. When Bexsero was given alone, the frequency 
of fever was similar to that associated with routine infant vaccines administered during clinical trials. 
When fever occurred, it generally followed a predictable pattern, with the majority resolving by the 
day after vaccination. 
In adolescents and adults, the most common local and systemic adverse reactions observed were pain 
at the injection site, malaise and headache. 
No increase in the incidence or severity of the adverse reactions was seen with subsequent doses of the 
vaccination series. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions (following primary immunisation or booster dose) considered as being at least 
possibly related to vaccination have been categorised by frequency. 
Frequencies are defined as follows: 
Very common: 
Common: 
Uncommon: 
Rare: 
Very rare: 
Not known:  
(≥1/10) 
(≥1/100 to <1/10) 
(≥1/1,000 to <1/100) 
(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) 
(<1/10,000) 
(cannot be estimated from the available data) 
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. 
In addition to reports in clinical trials, worldwide voluntary reports of adverse reactions received for 
Bexsero since market introduction are included in the list. Because these reactions are reported 
voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their 
frequency and they are consequently listed with the frequency unknown.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
Experience of overdose is limited. In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible 
symptomatic treatment is recommended.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: meningococcal vaccines, ATC code: J07AH09 
Mechanism of action 
Immunisation with Bexsero is intended to stimulate the production of bactericidal antibodies that 
recognize the vaccine antigens NHBA, NadA, fHbp, and PorA P1.4 (the immunodominant antigen 
present in the OMV component) and are expected to be protective against Invasive Meningococcal 
Disease (IMD). As these antigens are variably expressed by different strains, meningococci that 
express them at sufficient levels are susceptible to killing by vaccine-elicited antibodies. The 
Meningococcal Antigen Typing System (MATS) was developed to relate antigen profiles of different 
strains of meningococcal group B bacteria to killing of the strains in the serum bactericidal assay with 
human complement (hSBA). A survey of approximately 1 000 different invasive meningococcal group 
B isolates collected during 2007-2008 in 5 European countries showed that, depending on the country 
of origin, between 73% and 87% of meningococcal group B isolates had an appropriate MATS antigen 
profile to be covered by the vaccine. Overall, 78% (95% CI: 63-90) of the approximately 1 000 strains 
were potentially susceptible to vaccine-induced antibodies. 
Clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of Bexsero has not been evaluated through clinical trials. Vaccine efficacy has been 
inferred by demonstrating the induction of serum bactericidal antibody responses to each of the 
vaccine antigens (see section Immunogenicity). Vaccine effectiveness and impact have been 
demonstrated in real-world settings.  
Impact of vaccination on disease incidence 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the UK, Bexsero was introduced into the national immunisation programme (NIP) in September 2015 
using a two-dose schedule in infants (at 2 and 4 months of age) followed by a booster dose (at 12 months 
of age). In this context, Public Health England (PHE) conducted a 3-year observational study at the 
national level covering the entire birth cohort. 
After three years of the programme, a statistically significant reduction of 75% [Incidence Rate Ratio 
(IRR) 0.25 (95% CI: 0.19-0.36)] in MenB IMD cases was observed in vaccine-eligible infants, 
irrespective of the infants’ vaccination status or predicted meningococcal group B strain coverage. 
In South Australia, more than 30 000 students aged 16 through 19 years (from 91% of high schools), 
received two doses of Bexsero with a one- to three-month interval. In an interrupted time-series 
analysis, a statistically significant reduction of 71% (95% CI: 15-90) in MenB IMD cases was 
observed in the two years of follow-up (July 2017-June 2019). 
Immunogenicity 
Serum bactericidal antibody responses to each of the vaccine antigens NadA, fHbp, NHBA and 
PorA P1.4 were evaluated using a set of four meningococcal group B reference strains. Bactericidal 
antibodies against these strains were measured by the Serum Bactericidal Assay using human serum 
as the source of complement (hSBA). Data are not available from all vaccine schedules using the 
reference strain for NHBA. 
Most of the primary immunogenicity studies were conducted as randomized, controlled, multicenter, 
clinical trials. Immunogenicity was evaluated in infants, children, adolescents and adults. 
Immunogenicity in infants and children 
In infant studies, participants received three doses of Bexsero either at 2, 4 and 6 or 2, 3 and 4 months 
of age and a booster dose in their second year of life, as early as 12 months of age. Sera were obtained 
both before vaccination, one month after the third vaccination (see Table 2) and one month after 
booster vaccination (see Table 3). In an extension study the persistence of the immune response was 
assessed one year after the booster dose (see Table 3). The immunogenicity after two or three doses 
followed by a booster has been evaluated in infants 2 months to 5 months of age in another clinical 
study. The immunogenicity after two doses has been also documented in another study in 
infants 6 months to 8 months of age at enrolment (see Table 4).  
Previously unvaccinated children also received two doses in the second year of life, with antibody 
persistence being measured at one year after the second dose (see Table 4). 
Immunogenicity in infants 2 months to 5 months of age 
Three-dose primary series followed by a booster 
Immunogenicity results at one month after three doses of Bexsero administered 
at 2, 3, 4 and 2, 4, 6 months of age are summarised in Table 2. Bactericidal antibody responses one 
month after the third vaccination against meningococcal reference strains were high against the fHbp, 
NadA and PorA P1.4 antigens at both Bexsero vaccination schedules. The bactericidal responses 
against the NHBA antigen were also high in infants vaccinated at the 2, 4, 6-month schedule, but this 
antigen appeared to be less immunogenic at the 2, 3, 4-month schedule. The clinical consequences of 
the reduced immunogenicity of the NHBA antigen at this schedule are not known.

A decline in antibody titers to PorA P1.4 and fHbp antigens (reaching 9%-10% and 12%-20% of 
subjects with an hSBA ≥ 1:5, respectively) has been observed in an additional study in 
children 4 years of age who received a full priming and booster schedule as infants. In the same study 
the response to a further dose was indicative of immunological memory as 81%-95% of subjects 
reached an hSBA ≥ 1:5 to PorA P1.4 and 97%-100% to fHbp antigens following further vaccination. 
The clinical significance of this observation and the need for additional booster doses to maintain 
longer term protective immunity has not been established.

Two-dose primary series followed by a booster 
The immunogenicity after two primary doses (at 3 and a half and 5 months of age) or three primary 
doses (at 2 and a half, 3 and a half and 5 months of age) of Bexsero followed by a booster dose in 
infants starting vaccination between 2 and 5 months of age has been evaluated in an additional phase 3 
clinical study. The percentages of seropositive subjects (i.e. achieving an hSBA of at least 1:4) ranged 
from 44% to 100% one month after the second dose and from 55% to 100% one month after the third 
dose. At one month following a booster administered 6 months after the last dose, the percentages of 
seropositive subjects ranged from 87% to 100% for the two-dose schedule, and from 83% to 100% for 
the three-dose schedule. 
Antibody persistence was evaluated in an extension study in children 3 to 4 years of age. Comparable 
percentages of subjects were seropositive at 2 to 3 years after being previously vaccinated with either 
two doses followed by a booster of Bexsero (ranging from 35% to 91%) or three doses followed by a 
booster (ranging from 36% to 84%). In the same study the response to an additional dose administered 
2 to 3 years after the booster was indicative of immunological memory as shown by a robust antibody 
response against all Bexsero antigens, ranging from 81% to 100% and from 70% to 99%, respectively. 
These observations are consistent with adequate priming in infancy with both a two-dose and a three-
dose primary series followed by a booster of Bexsero. 
Immunogenicity in infants 6 to 11 months and children 12 to 23 months of age 
The immunogenicity after two doses administered two months apart in children 6 months to 23 months 
of age has been documented in two studies whose results are summarised in Table 4. Against each of 
the vaccine antigens, seroresponse rates and hSBA GMTs were high and similar after the two-dose 
series in infants 6-8 months of age and children 13-15 months of age. Data on antibody persistence 
one year after the two doses at 13 and 15 months of age are also summarised in Table 4.

Immunogenicity in children 2 to 10 years of age 
The immunogenicity after two doses of Bexsero administered either one or two months apart in 
children 2 to 10 years of age has been evaluated in an initial phase 3 clinical study and its extension. In 
the initial study, whose results are summarised in Table 5, participants received two doses of Bexsero 
two months apart. The seroresponse rates and hSBA GMTs were high after the two-dose schedule in 
children against each of the vaccine antigens (Table 5).

In the extension study, in which two doses of Bexsero were administered one month apart in 
unvaccinated children, high percentages of subjects were seropositive one month after the second 
dose. An early immune response after the first dose was also evaluated. The percentages of 
seropositive subjects (i.e. achieving an hSBA of at least 1:4) across strains ranged from 46% to 95% at 
one month after the first dose and from 69% to 100% at one month after the second dose (Table 6).

The same extension study also evaluated antibody persistence and the response to a booster dose in 
children who received the two-dose primary series at 2-5 or 6-10 years of age. After 24-36 months, the 
percentages of seropositive subjects (i.e. achieving an hSBA of at least 1:4) declined, ranging across 
strains from 21% to 74% in children 4-7 years of age and from 47% to 86% in children 8-12 years of 
age. The response to a booster dose administered 24-36 months after the primary series was indicative 
of immunological memory as the percentages of seropositive subjects ranged across strains from 93% 
to 100% in children 4-7 years of age and from 96% to 100% in children 8-12 years of age. 
Immunogenicity in adolescents (from 11 years of age) and adults 
Adolescents received two doses of Bexsero with one, two or six-month intervals between doses; these 
data are summarised in Tables 7 and 8.  
In studies with adults, data were obtained after two doses of Bexsero with a one-month or two-month 
interval between doses (see Table 9). 
The vaccination schedules of two doses administered with an interval of one or two months showed 
similar immune responses in both adults and adolescents. Similar responses were also observed for 
adolescents administered two doses of Bexsero with an interval of six months.

In the study in adolescents, bactericidal responses following two doses of Bexsero were stratified by 
baseline hSBA less than 1:4 or equal to or greater than 1:4. Seroresponse rates and percentages of 
subjects with at least a 4-fold increase in hSBA titer from baseline to one month after the second dose 
of Bexsero are summarised in Table 8. Following Bexsero vaccination, a high percentage of subjects 
were seropositive and achieved 4-fold increases in hSBA titers independent of pre-vaccination status.

% seropositive = the percentage of subjects who achieved an hSBA ≥ 1:4. 
Antibody persistence data for the study in adolescents were obtained in an extension phase 3 study. At 
approximately 7.5 years after the two-dose primary series, the percentages of subjects with 
hSBA ≥ 1:4 declined, ranging across strains from 29% to 84%. The response to a booster dose 
administered 7.5 years after the primary series was indicative of immunological memory as the 
percentages of subjects reaching an hSBA ≥ 1:4 across strains ranged from 93% to 100%. 
The same study also evaluated antibody persistence data from an additional phase 3 initial study in 
adolescents. At approximately 4 years after the two-dose primary series, the percentages of subjects 
with hSBA ≥ 1:5 generally declined from a range across strains of 68% to 100% after the second dose 
to a range across strains of 9% to 84%. The response to a booster dose administered 4 years after the 
primary series was indicative of immunological memory as the percentages of subjects with 
hSBA ≥ 1:5 ranged across strains from 92% to 100%.

deficiencies (40), with asplenia or splenic dysfunction (107), and age-matched healthy subjects (85) 
received two doses of Bexsero two months apart. At 1 month following the 2-dose vaccination course, 
the percentages of subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:5 in individuals with complement deficiencies and asplenia 
or splenic dysfunction were 87% and 97% for antigen fHbp, 95% and 100% for antigen NadA, 68% 
and 86% for antigen PorA P1.4, 73% and 94% for antigen NHBA, respectively, indicating an immune 
response in these immunocompromised subjects. The percentages of healthy subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:5 
were 98% for antigen fHbp, 99% for antigen NadA, 83% for antigen PorA P1.4, and 99% for antigen 
NHBA.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What BEXSERO is and what it is used for  
Bexsero is a Meningococcal group B Vaccine. 
Bexsero contains four different components from the surface of the bacteria Neisseria meningitidis 
group B. 
Bexsero is given to individuals from 2 months of age and older to help protect against disease caused 
by the Neisseria meningitidis group B bacteria. These bacteria can cause serious, and sometimes 
life-threatening, infections such as meningitis (inflammation of the covering of the brain and spinal 
cord) and sepsis (blood poisoning). 
The vaccine works by specifically stimulating the body’s natural defense system of the vaccinated 
person. This results in protection against the disease. 
2.  What you need to know before you or your child receive BEXSERO  
Do NOT use Bexsero 
- 
if you or your child are allergic to the active substances or any of the other ingredients of this 
vaccine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or nurse before you or your child receive Bexsero: 
- 
if you or your child have a severe infection with a high temperature. If this is the case, then 
vaccination will be postponed. The presence of a minor infection, such as a cold, should not 
require postponement of the vaccination, but talk to your doctor or nurse first. 
if you or your child have haemophilia or any other problem that may stop your blood from 
clotting properly, such as treatment with blood thinners (anticoagulants). Talk to your doctor or 
nurse first. 
- 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
- 
if you or your child receive treatment that blocks the part of the immune system known as 
complement activation, such as eculizumab. Even if you or your child have been vaccinated 
with Bexsero you or your child remain at increased risk of disease caused by the Neisseria 
meningitidis group B bacteria. 
if your child was born prematurely (before or at 28 weeks of pregnancy), particularly if they had 
breathing difficulties. Stopping breathing or irregular breathing for a short time may be more 
common in the first three days following vaccination in these babies and they may need special 
monitoring. 
if you or your child have an allergy to the antibiotic kanamycin. If present, the kanamycin level 
in the vaccine is low. If you or your child may have an allergy to kanamycin, talk to your doctor 
or nurse first. 
Fainting, feeling faint or other stress-related reactions can occur as a response to any needle injection. 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you have experienced this kind of reaction previously. 
There are no data on the use of Bexsero in adults above 50 years of age. There are limited data on the use 
of Bexsero in patients with chronic medical conditions or with weakened immunity. If you or your child 
have weakened immunity (for example, due to the use of immunosuppressive medications, or HIV 
infection, or hereditary defects of the body’s natural defence system), it is possible that the effectiveness 
of Bexsero is reduced. 
As with any vaccine, Bexsero may not fully protect all of those who are vaccinated. 
Other medicines and Bexsero 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you or your child are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines, or have recently received any other vaccine. 
Bexsero can be given at the same time as any of the following vaccine components: diphtheria, 
tetanus, whooping cough (pertussis), Haemophilus influenzae type b, polio, hepatitis B, 
pneumococcus, measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, and meningococcus A, C, W, Y. Talk to your 
doctor or nurse for further information. 
When given at the same time with other vaccines Bexsero must be given at separate injection sites. 
Your doctor or nurse may ask you to give your child medicines that lower fever at the time and after 
Bexsero has been given. This will help to reduce some of the side effects of Bexsero. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, 
ask your doctor for advice before Bexsero is given. Your doctor may still recommend that you receive 
Bexsero if you are at risk of exposure to meningococcal infection. 
Driving and using machines 
Bexsero has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the 
effects mentioned under section 4 “Possible side effects” may temporarily affect the ability to drive or 
use machines. 
Bexsero contains sodium chloride 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-free’.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Upon storage a fine off-white deposit may be observed in the pre-filled syringe containing the 
suspension. 
Before use, the pre-filled syringe should be well shaken in order to form a homogeneous suspension. 
The vaccine should be visually inspected for particulate matter and discoloration prior to 
administration. In the event of any foreign particulate matter and/or variation of physical aspect being 
observed, do not administer the vaccine. If two needles of different lengths are provided in the pack, 
choose the appropriate needle to ensure an intramuscular administration. 
Do not freeze. 
Bexsero must not be mixed with other vaccines in the same syringe. 
Should concomitant administration of other vaccines be necessary, vaccines must be administered at 
separate injection sites. 
Care must be taken to ensure that the vaccine is injected intramuscularly only.

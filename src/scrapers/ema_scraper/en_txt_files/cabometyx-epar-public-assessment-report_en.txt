2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Cabozantinib is an oral multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Cabozantinib was approved as an orphan 
medicine in the EU as Cometriq capsules in the treatment of adult patients with progressive, unresectable locally 
advanced or metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma in March 2014. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
CABOMETYX is indicated for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in patients who have received 
one prior therapy. 
The approved indication further to the CHMP review is: 
CABOMETYX  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  advanced  renal  cell  carcinoma  (RCC)  in  adults  following  prior 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Renal cell carcinomas are kidney tumours which represent approximately 90% of cases of kidney cancer in 
adults (Wahal and Mardi, 2014). These tumours arise from the cells of the proximal renal tubular epithelium. 
According to the American Joint Committee on Cancer, both metastatic (M1 – distant metastasis present) and 
locally unresectable (T4 – tumor invades beyond Gerota’s fascia; N - any; M0) RCC are classified as Stage IV 
(Edge, et al., 2010). The terms “unresectable advanced RCC” and “metastatic RCC” are used interchangeably, 
and since both represent Stage IV RCC, the treatment of adult patients with advanced RCC is stated in the 
approved indications for second-line agents. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Kidney cancer represents approximately 3% of all cancers worldwide (Cohen, et al., 2005, Garcia and Rini, 
2007). The incidence of RCC has been rising steadily and the 5-year prevalence of RCC in the EU-28 (plus 
Iceland and Norway) in 2015 was estimated to be 229,465 cases (adapted from Globocan 2012). Despite 
substantial progress in the understanding and treatment of mRCC in recent years, its incidence is increasing, 
and the disease is still considered incurable. Smoking and obesity are established risk factors for RCC 
development. Several hereditary types also exist, with von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) disease being the most 
common (NCCN guidelines). RCC also appears to be more common in patients with end-stage renal failure, 
acquired renal cystic disease and tuberous sclerosis. Approximately 2%–3% of RCC are hereditary and several 
autosomal dominant syndromes are described, each with a distinct genetic basis and phenotype, the most 
common one being Von Hippel Lindau disease. In recent years, many new genes associated with RCC have been 
reported (such as PBRM1, SETD2, BAP1) (ESMO guidelines, 2014; NCCN guidelines 2016). 
2.1.3.  Biologic features and pathogenesis 
Clear cell RCC is the most frequent pathological subtype of sporadic RCC in adults (70%–85%), with loss of 3p 
and the classical clear aspect of the cells due to glycogen and lipids in their cytoplasm. Other subtypes 
historically called non clear RCC include papillary RCC (7%–15%) shows distribution of malignant cells around 
capillary cores ( papillae), chromophobe RCC (5%–10%) is made up of typical polygonal cells with a clear 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/664123/2016 
Page 9/119 
  
  
delimitation of the cytoplasmic membrane and reticular cytoplasm, renal medullary carcinoma, etc (Escudier et 
al, 2014). Due to a better understanding of the correlation between chromosomal alterations, histological 
subtypes and molecular pathway abnormalities, new morphological variants of RCC are now recognised 
according to the Vancouver classification (Escudier et al, 2014). Each of the most frequent morphological 
genetic RCC subtypes correlates with a specific molecular pathway. Examples include the hypoxia-inducible 
pathway (clear-cell, papillary type II through the FH gene), the mTOR signalling pathway (clear-cell and 
papillary type II), the c Met-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway (papillary type I and translocation RCC). 
Inactivation of the von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor protein is a characteristic of clear cell tumours, 
resulting in the deregulation of the VEGF signalling pathway. VEGFRs are typical receptor tyrosine kinases with 
an extracellular domain for ligand binding, a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain, including a 
tyrosine kinase domain. Activation of VEGF signalling pathways promote the growth of tumour blood cells. The 
major pro-angiogenic signal is generated from the ligand-activated VEGFR-2. 
MET and AXL are also deregulated in RCC VHL-deficient cells. MET is the receptor tyrosine kinase for hepatocyte 
growth factor (HGF). HGF binding induces recruitment of the adaptor protein GAB1 and activation of multiple 
signalling, leading to promotion of cell survival, proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis. 
Deregulation of MET signalling has been associated with poor prognosis in a variety of human cancers. AXL is a 
member of the TAM family of receptor tyrosine kinases, which also includes MER and TYRO-3. Interaction with 
growth arrest-specific gene 6 (GAS6) activates pathways to promote proliferation, survival and tumour 
angiogenesis and metastasis. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
More than 50% of RCCs are currently detected incidentally. However, some patients with RCC still present with 
clinical symptoms, such as flank pain, gross haematuria and palpable abdominal mass (the classical triad); 
metastatic symptoms like bone pain or lung nodules; or paraneoplastic syndromes, such as hypercalcaemia, 
unexplained fever, erythrocytosis or wasting syndromes (Escudier et al, 2014). About 30% of patients with RCC 
have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis, and a significant proportion of patients with localized disease 
treated with curative nephrectomy relapse subsequently with metastatic disease. Metastatic RCC is associated 
with a high quality-of-life burden, based on physical, psychological, and social criteria, and drastically reduced 
survival; only about 8% to 22.5% of mRCC patients survive for five years or more as compared to 90% of 
patients with localized renal cancer. The extent of tumour burden and site of metastasis contribute to local 
symptoms. The most frequent locations of metastases are the lungs, mediastinum, bone, liver, and brain. 
Among solid cancer types, RCC has the second highest incidence of brain metastases. Risks assessment models 
have been developed to provide prognostic information for patients and to inform on eligibility and risk 
stratification factors for clinical trials. The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre (MSKCC) stratifies according 
to 6 risk factors; Karnofsky performance status (KPS), haemoglobin level, corrected serum calcium, time from 
diagnosis to treatment, platelets and neutrophil levels. Relapsed RCC is an aggressive tumor and the optimal 
sequencing of therapies, or combination of therapies,that would lead to durable responses and minimize relapse 
remains a challenge. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Management  of  local  disease  includes  partial  or  radical  nephrectomy.  The  role  of  neo-adjuvant  or  adjuvant 
therapy is not yet established. In the advanced disease setting systemic therapy is used. Until the development 
of agents that target tumour angiogenesis and other signaling pathways, systemic therapy with the cytokines 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/664123/2016 
Page 10/119 
  
  
interleukin 2 (IL-2) or interferon (IFN)-α was the main treatment for advanced RCC. However, the use of both 
agents has declined substantially since the introduction of molecular targeted therapies. 
Current  approved  treatments  for  metastatic  RCC  in  the  first-line  setting  comprise  targeted  therapies,  either 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI: sunitinib and pazopanib) or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors 
(temsirolimus) administered as single agents, bevacizumab + interferon (IFN), or high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) 
(NCCN, 2016; ESMO, 2014). 
Approved  second-line  agents  include  TKIs:  sorafenib,  sunitinib,  axitinib,  and  pazopanib;  the  mTOR  inhibitor 
everolimus. 
A novel immunotherapeutic agent, Opdivo (nivolumab), belonging to a class of immune checkpoint inhibitors 
(PD-1/PD-L1), has been recently granted approval by EC on 19/06/2015 for the treatment of advanced renal cell 
carcinoma after prior therapy in adults.   
Afinitor  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  advanced  renal  cell  carcinoma,  whose  disease  has 
progressed on or after treatment with VEGF-targeted therapy. The recommended dose is 10 mg everolimus 
once  daily.  Treatment  should  continue  as  long  as  clinical  benefit  is  observed  or  until  unacceptable  toxicity 
occurs. 
Relapsed RCC is an aggressive tumor and the optimal sequencing of therapies, or combination of therapies, that 
would lead to durable responses and minimize relapse remains a challenge. Current strategies have focused on 
the development of new therapeutic agents, optimal sequencing, and combinations of these agents to maximize 
their impact on clinical outcomes. To date, however, results of combination-therapy studies (ie, temsirolimus 
plus bevacizumab, temsirolimus plus sunitinib, erlotinib plus bevacizumab, everolimus plus bevacizumab) have 
shown no advantage in PFS over monotherapy with approved single agents and, in some cases, an unacceptably 
high degree of toxicity (Bukowski et al., 2007; Dorff, et al., 2014; Feldman, et al., 2009; Graves, et al., 2013; 
Hainsworth, et al., 2010; Kanesvaran, et al., 2015; Negrier, et al., 2011; Powles, et al., 2014; Ravaud, et al., 
2013). Therefore, there remains a significant unmet medical need for more effective treatment options, with a 
manageable safety profile in patients with advanced RCC.

vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs), and AXL (Zhou et al 2015; Yu et al 2015; Rankin et al 
2014; Ciamporcero et al 2015; Gibney et al 2013; Harshman and Choueiri 2013; Sennino et al 2012; Yakes et 
al 2011). 
Overall, the preclinical data generated to date demonstrate that cabozantinib exhibits potent antiangiogenic and 
antitumor activity in multiple cancer models. 
Cabozantinib capsules were initially evaluated in a Phase 1 study and showed activity in subjects with 
progressive metastatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC; Kurzrock et al 2011). Results of the subsequent 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study XL184-301 (Elisei et al 2013) established the 
efficacy and safety of cabozantinib capsules at the 140 mg dose in the MTC population. Cabozantinib capsules 
(Cometriq) were approved in the United States at an oral dose of 140 mg (freebase equivalent [FBE] weight) 
once daily (qd) for the treatment of patients with progressive, metastatic MTC. In Europe, Cometriq is approved 
at an oral dose of 140 mg FBE qd for the treatment of adult patients with progressive, unresectable locally 
advanced or metastatic MTC. Further efficacy and safety data have been collected since the time of approval and 
long-term follow-up of over 3 years has not indicated any changes in the overall safety profile of cabozantinib in 
MTC patients. 
The 140 mg capsule dose was also evaluated in a Phase 1 drug interaction study XL184-008, which included a 
cohort of subjects with RCC. Among all the permitted dose levels, a dose of 60 mg was the most frequent last 
dose and the dose with the longest treatment duration. Subsequently, a 60 mg dose using a tablet formulation 
was used in the Phase 3 RCC study XL184-308 and is the same formulation proposed for commercial use in 
advanced RCC. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was considered to be 
of major public health interest. This was based on: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive. 
The applicant has provided comprehensive data 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed since even if drugs targeting the VEGF and mTOR pathway have 
been approved for RCC and have demonstrated clinical benefit, patients do experience disease progression 
and there remains a need for additional active treatments in this setting. As such, there is a need for 
additional therapeutic options for patients who have received one prior therapy. 
Cabozantinib could have a major impact on medical practice and the evidence to support the claim of major 
public health benefit was considered to be adequate for the purpose of a benefit risk assessment.

yellow (E172), as described in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The finished product may be available in polyvinylchloride/polychlorotrifluoroethylene/aluminum 
(PVC/PCTFE/Alu) blisters or in high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with silica gel dessicant canisters and a 
polypropylene (PP) child-resistant closure, as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of cabozantinib (S)-malate is N-{4-[(6,7-dimethoxyquinolin-4-yl)oxy]phenyl}-N′- 
(4-fluorophenyl)cyclopropane-1,1-dicarboxamide (2S)-hydroxybutanedioate, corresponding to the molecular 
formula C28H24FN3O5·C4H6O5. Its molecular weight is 635.6 (501.5 for freebase) and it has the structural 
formula shown in figure 1: 
Figure 1 - Cabozantinib (S)-malate  
There is no monograph of cabozantinib in the European Pharmacopoeia.  
Cabozantinib (S)-malate is a white to off-white, non-hygroscopic, crystalline substance. Cabometyx contains 
the malate salt of cabozantinib because the freebase is insoluble in water. Cabozantinib has a non-chiral 
molecular structure.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Cabozantinib is a known active substance (having been approved in 2014 for Cometriq 80 mg and 20 mg 
capsules). Adequate specifications and control methods have been presented for the starting materials, isolated 
intermediate products and reagents. The in-process controls applied during the synthesis are considered 
appropriate and sufficient. Process validation was conducted on three consecutive production-scale batches. 
Detailed information on the manufacturing process of the active substance and its development has been 
provided in the dossier and is considered satisfactory. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities, including potentially genotoxic impurities 
(GTIs), were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. All potential impurities including GTIs 
are adequately controlled in steps performed under GMP. 
The primary polyethylene bag material is in compliance with EU Directive 72/2002/EC. 
CHMP assessment report

Specification 
The active substance specificationincludes tests for appearance, identification (HPLC, FTIR), assay (free base, 
HPLC), purity (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), genotoxic impurities (HPLC & LCMS),  water content (KF), malic acid 
content (HPLC), organic volatile impurities (GC), residue on ignition, crystal form (XRPD), particle size 
distribution (laser diffraction) and heavy metals (Ph. Eur.).  
The specifications were established in accordance with ICH Q6A and are supported by the release and stability 
data from representative batches which were manufactured at the intended commercial scale. The proposed GTI 
specification limits are below the threshold of toxicological concern (TTC, 1.5 μg/day) considering the highest 
dose of 60 mg, and are therefore considered to be acceptable. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and the non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for identity, assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data have been provided on 16 commercial scale batches produced by the proposed 
manufacturer and process. In addition, batch analysis results from historical batches were presented. The 
results are within the specifications and demonstrate that the active ingredient can be manufactured 
reproducibly. 
Stability 
Stability data on ten commercial scale batches of active substance manufactured by the commercial process for 
up to 36 months under long term conditions at 25 °C/60 % RH and on three commercial scale batches under 
accelerated storage conditions (40 °C / 75% RH) for six months were provided in accordance with ICH Q1A 
guidelines. The container closure system was representative of the intended commercial package.  
The following parameters were tested: appearance, assay, impurities including GTIs, water content and crystal 
form. The analytical methods used in the stability testing were the same as those used at release and they have 
been demonstrated to be stability indicating. 
The results did not show any significant changes. The GTIs were monitored throughout the stability studies and 
their levels remain within the specifications at all time points in both conditions.   
The  stability  profile  of  AS  manufactured  by  alternative  processes  demonstrated  similar  stability  behaviour.A 
photostability study in accordance with ICH Q1B guideline was performed on one batch. It was concluded that 
direct exposure of the active substance to intense light should be avoided. Light protection by the proposed 
container closure system was confirmed. 
A forced degradation study was also conducted on one batch under different stress conditions (acid, base, heat, 
oxidation, UV/visible light).  No degradation was observed under heat- and photo-stressed conditions tested. 
Slight degradation was observed (relative retention time for products shown) under the basic hydrolysis and 
oxidative conditions, and significant degradation was observed under acidic hydrolysis.  
Heat-stress studies were performed with testing of appearance, assay, impurities, GTIs and water content.  No 
significant changes in appearance, assay, impurities (including GTIs) and water content were observed. 
Based on presented stability data, the proposed retest period of 24 months and storage conditions (“Do not 
store above 25 ºC”) are acceptable.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Cabometyx is an immediate release film-coated tablet. 20 mg tablets are yellow, round, debossed with “XL” on 
one side and “20” on the other side. 40 mg tablets are yellow, triangle-shaped, debossed with “XL” on one side 
and “40” on the other side. 60 mg tablets are yellow, oval-shaped, debossed with “XL” on one side and “60” on 
the other side.  
Cabometyx contains the following list of excipients: 
Tablet: Microcrystalline cellulose, Anhydrous lactose, Hydroxypropyl cellulose, Croscarmellose sodium, Colloidal 
anhydrous silica, Magnesium stearate. 
Film-coating: Hypromellose 2910, Titanium dioxide (E171), Triacetin, Iron oxide yellow (E172) 
The formulation history has been presented. A tablet formulation was considered as the most desirable and was 
developed for later Phase 3 studies. The formulation has been optimised with regard to the the drug loading and 
excipients ratio and dissolution performance; the choice of excipients has been justified. The selected film 
coating system was selected among other following an evaluation with regard to their effect on stability and 
dissolution.The manufacturing consists of high-shear wet granulation, fluid bed drying, milling, blending, 
compression, and film coating. All tablet strengths are dose proportional and are prepared from a common final 
blend. Each tablet strength is differentiated by shape. Throughout the course of development (and to support 
clinical manufacturing), minor process modifications were implemented to improve manufacturability and 
process robustness. A risk analysis was used to identify process parameters that are likely to have the greatest 
impact on product quality and manufacturability of the tablets. Based on prior knowledge and the analysis, 
appropriate experiments were designed and executed to evaluate the significance of process parameters and to 
optimise them for adequate quality and manufacturability.  
The dissolution medium becauseMoreover, the discriminatory capability of the method was also evaluated. In 
bioequivalence study XL184-010, the commercialised capsule formulation of cabozantinib (Cometriq) and the 
proposed tablet formulation (for treatment of Renal Cell Carcinoma) were compared. The Cmax acceptance 
criterion exceeded the standard upper limit of 125% and bioequivalence of the two formulations has not been 
demonstrated but no new PK-related safety concerns were identified. The tablet formulation will be the only 
marketed cabozantinib drug product formulation for the treatment of patients with RCC. It is clearly stated in the 
proposed SmPC (section 4.2) that the tablet and capsule formulations are not bioequivalent and should not be 
used interchangeably.  
Cabometyx film coated tablets may be packed in PVC/PCTFE/Alu blisters or in high density polyethylene (HDPE) 
bottles with silica gel desiccant canisters and a polypropylene child-resistant closure, as described in section 6.5 
of the SmPC. The packaging material complies with the relevant EU regulations and Ph. Eur. requirements. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process comprises the following main steps: dispensing and excipient de-lumping, 
pre-mixing, granulation, wet milling, fluid bed drying, dry milling, extra-granular blending, lubrication blending, 
tablet compression, film coating. The process is considered to be a standard process.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/664123/2016 
Page 15/119 
  
  
Critical steps have been identified and the process parameters for both critical and non-critical steps have been 
described. The parameters are supported by the manufacturing development. The in-process controls are 
appropriate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Batch size has been clearly defined. Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number 
of studies. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished 
product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The manufacturing process for cabozantinib 20 mg, 40 mg 
and 60 mg tablets will be validated prior to commercial launch in accordance with GMP. A process validation 
scheme has been presented.  
Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf life specification include tests and limits for: appearance, identification 
(HPLC, UV), assay (HPLC-UV), impurities (HPLC), content uniformity (Ph. Eur.), water content (KF), dissolution 
(Ph. Eur., HPLC), GTIs (LC/MS) and microbial limits (total aerobic count (Ph. Eur.), total combined yeasts and 
molds (Ph. Eur.)).  
The impurity limits are in line with ICH guidance (for related impurities) or below the TTC for genotoxic 
impurities considering the highest dose of 60 mg, and are therefore considered to be acceptable. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for identity, assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch  analyses  results  from  32  batches  covering  all  three  strengths  were  provided.  Five  batches  were 
manufactured at smaller scale but 27 batches were manufactured at the commercial scale. All batches were 
manufactured  with  a  process  representative  of  the  proposed  commercial  manufacturing  process  and  used 
representative batches of active substance. All batches were manufactured at the commercial manufacturing 
site.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from a total of 24 batches of cabozantinib tablets, packaged in HDPE bottles and stored under 
long-term  (25  ºC  ±  2  ºC/60  %  ±  5  %  RH)  and  accelerated  conditions  (40 ºC  ±  2  ºC/75  %  ±  5  %  RH)  in 
accordance with ICH Q1A guidelines were provided. An additional 6 batches were also placed on stability under 
long term and accelerated conditions. Each of these batches was split into either HDPE bottles or PVC/ PCTFE/ 
Alu blisters. 
Long term stability data up to 36 months and for 6 months under accelerated conditions was presented. The 
tests carried out on stability were appearance, assay, impurities, water content, dissolution and GTIs. Microbial 
quality testing is performed at 12, 24 and 36 months which is considered acceptable.  
For tablets packaged in HDPE bottles (long-term data up to 36 months available and 6 months accelerated data 
available), no significant changes with respect to appearance, potency, individual impurities, total impurities, 
water content, and dissolution were demonstrated. An upward trend for a genotoxic impurity is detected under 
accelerated conditions; however the specification limit is met. 
For tablets packaged in blisters (up to 24 months long term data and 6 months accelerated data available), no 
significant  differences  with  respect  to  appearance,  potency,  individual  impurities,  total  impurities,  and 
dissolution were observed. An upward trend for a genotoxic impurity is detected under accelerated conditions; 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/664123/2016 
Page 16/119 
  
  
however the specification limit is met. Higher water content was observed compared to the bottles. The results 
remain  within  the  proposed  commercial  specifications  for  all  time  points  for  both  strengths,  confirming 
equivalency between bottle and blister packaging configurations. 
Based on this study acceptable bulk holding time has been established.Photostability was performed in line with 
ICH Q1B guidelines and the tablets were demonstrated to be photostable. 
Based on the overall stability data the proposed shelf life of 3 years for both packaging configurations is 
acceptable without any special storage condition as stated in the SmPC (sections 6.3 and 6.4). 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose used in Cabometyx is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same 
condition as those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without 
the use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of 
Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance has been presented in a 
satisfactory manner. The development, manufacture and controls of the finished product have been sufficiently 
documented and justified. The results of tests of active substance and finished product carried out indicate 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion 
that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAA for Cometriq (cabozantinib) capsules for the treatment of progressive, metastatic medullary thyroid 
carcinoma (MTC) was authorised on 21 March 2014. This present MAA is being submitted for the cabozantinib 
tablet formulations, which will be commercialized under a different trade name, Cabometyx.  
The body of text of this non-clinical assessment is based on the data for Cometriq, but updated with new 
information as assessed in the variations for Cometriq to include information generated as part of the PAMs 
agreed for the MA approval.  
A new Ecotoxicity/Environmental Risk Assessment has been provided. 
CHMP assessment report

2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Primary pharmacodynamics studies with cabozantinib (XL184) consisted of in vitro receptor binding assays and 
of several functional cell-based assays.  In vivo studies focused first on target pharmacodynamic effects and 
tumour cellular responses to treatment. Furthermore multiple murine tumour models were used to explore the 
efficacy of XL184 with regard to tumour growth inhibition and regression in vivo.  
Cabozantinib  was  evaluated  for  its  inhibitory  activity  against  a  variety  of  kinases  and  was  identified  as  an 
inhibitor  of  MET  (hepatocyte  growth  factor  receptor  protein)  and  VEGF  (vascular  endothelial  growth  factor) 
receptors.  In  addition,  cabozantinib  inhibits  other  tyrosine  kinases  including  the  GAS6  receptor  (AXL),  RET, 
ROS1, TYRO3, MER,  the stem cell factor receptor (KIT), TRKB, Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), and TIE-2.The 
most  important  metabolites  in  humans  are  XL184  desmethyl  sulphate  (M2a  or  EXEL1644)  and  XL184 
monohydroxy sulphate (M4). It appears that the pharmacological activity of 1644 is limited (>50% residual 
control  activity  at  a  concentration  of  1  µM).  However,  human  Cmax  is  above  the  tested  concentration  and 
human exposure is relative extensive. Based on the higher protein binding of the metabolite than the parent 
compound  (99.950  to  99.996%  against  99.7  to  >99%)  it  appears  likely  that  this  metabolite  does  not 
significantly  contribute  of  the  pharmacological  activity  of  the  current  product.  No  data  on  in  vitro 
substrate/inhibition of the various Cyps have been provided for this metabolite because in vitro and in vivo data 
suggested that cabozantinib has minimal to no clinically-relevant CYP induction potential.  
Metabolite M4 (EXEL-1646) has more broader and potent inhibition of several kinases, when compared to 1644.  
However, the inhibition of 48 kinases were compared between M4 and the parent cabozantinib and cabozantinib 
parent showed a much greater potency over a broader range of kinases than did M4. Therefore, it shows that 
EXEL-1646  does  not  contribute  substantial  to  the  cabozantinib’s  pharmacodynamic  activity.  The  Applicant 
provided the same rationale for the lack of data on potential substrate/inhibition of Cyps for this metabolite as 
for metabolite 1644. For M4 this justification is agreed. The activity of two other major metabolites of XL184, M1 
and M8 were found to be  less active against the primary targets of XL184 (MET, VEGFR2) and both can be 
considered not to have a significant contribution to the pharmacologically activity of XL184. 
Also in cellular systems exposure to XL184 inhibited basal or growth factor-induced auto-phosphorylation of 
RTKs, proliferation of tumour cell lines (including only one cell line relevant for the current indication, i.e. TT 
medullary  thyroid  tumour  cell  line  containing  a  RET  mutation,  Ret  C634W),  microvascular  endothelial  cell 
migration, and VEGF-driven tube formation. These data indicate that XL184 may have an anti-tumour effect in 
vivo  on  tumours  that  depend  on  signalling  via  one  of  several  RTKs  RET/MET/VEGFR/…  for  growth  and/or 
migration/metastasis formation. In these studies only limited attention has been paid to the RET tyrosine kinase 
and its clinically relevant mutations. In vitro inhibition generally is seen in the nM range. Extrapolation of these 
concentrations to in vivo situation is not always possible due to the extremely high protein binding of XL184 
(>99.9%). However it is noted that human plasma concentrations are in the low µM range suggesting that the 
free plasma concentrations may be within the pharmacological active range.  
The relationship between dosing, plasma concentration and target RTK inhibition was studied in several studies 
in nude athymic mice tumour models. Prolonged inhibition of several RTKs was noted which corresponded to the 
plasma concentrations of XL184 in that inhibition was diminished when plasma levels fell below approximately 
10 μM  (5 µg/ml) for MET, 15 μM for RET (7,5 µg/ml), and 5 μM (2,5 µg/ml) for VEGFR2. This is within the range 
or slightly above the clinical plasma levels (2-4 µM). In the target tissue the concentrations of XL184 behaved in 
a similar manner to plasma concentrations. The concentration in lung was similar (study XL184-disc-010) or ~ 
2  fold  higher  (study  XL184-disc-015)  to  plasma,  the  concentration  in  tumour  was  the  similar  to  (study 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/664123/2016 
Page 18/119 
  
  
XL184-disc-011) or ~ 2-fold lower (study XL184-disc-009 and disc-014) than plasma concentration. In liver the 
concentration was ~2-3 fold higher than in plasma (study XL184-disc-013). 
Data from several rat or murine tumour models indicate that once daily administration of XL184 can inhibit 
tumour  growth,  and  even  tumour  regression  at  high  doses  when  plasma  levels  are  in  low  µM  range. 
Histopathology of tumour tissue revealed reduced cellular proliferation and microvessel density and increased 
necrosis in XL184 treated animals. Also relatively large sized tumours were sensitive to XL184 treatment. No 
data is available on regrowth of tumour following multiple dosing, it is assumed that tumours regrow following 
end of treatment, however it is not clear if there may be a rebound effect (increased tumour growth) following 
end of treatment. In only one study a tumour cell line relevant for the indication was used (TT). In this xenograft 
model (study XL184-disc-025) clear tumour growth inhibition was shown, but regression was only seen at the 
highest dose.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamics studies were performed. A screen consisting of 75 pharmacological targets, 
including receptors, transporters, and enzymes specific inhibition was seen only of the adenosine A3 receptor 
(IC50 <0.9 µM) and the ML1 (melatonin) receptor (IC50> 1 µM). CHMP agreed that these potential interactions 
do  not  represent  a  toxicologically  or  clinically  significant  risk.  As  no  unexpected  risks  have  been  identified, 
further non-clinical studies were not deemed necessary. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
In in vivo safety pharmacology studies, no adverse effects on neurobehavioral function at up to 300 mg/kg or 
respiratory-system function at up to 900 mg/kg occurred in rats administered XL184. 
The in vitro safety pharmacology data were not performed according to GLP, and data provided in several study 
reports was limited. The data suggest that cabozantinib is not a potent hERG inhibitor, but has an effect on hERG 
trafficking, which might lead to delayed QT prolongation in patients. In vivo in dogs, no effect on ECG 
parameters were observed after a single dose, nor after 26 weeks of dosing (see repeated dose toxicity). In 
patients, detailed evaluation of the effect of cabozantinib on QT interval was performed in a clinical trial, which 
revealed a slight, but not clinically relevant prolongation of the QT interval. Considering the available clinical 
data and the lack of a relevant effect on ECG parameters, further non-clinical data or discussion is not required. 
In vivo, no effect other than a transient effect on diastolic blood pressure was seen. Hypertension is a known 
class effect of these types of products and this has also been observed in clinical trials. Further monitoring on a 
clinical level is warranted. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were performed (see discussion on Non-clincal aspects). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Cabozantinib is a highly permeable compound with a generally rapid absorption after oral administration. 
Absolute bioavailability of the malate salt of cabozantinib administered via an oral capsule (clinical formulation) 
is moderate to high in dog and rat, respectively.  
Kinetics of cabozantinib after repeated once-daily dosing were generally linear in rats over the dose range 0.1 – 
15 mg/kg, but increased more than dose-proportional over the dose range 5 – 15 mg/kg. In dogs, cabozantinib 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/664123/2016 
Page 19/119 
  
  
 
exposure increased less than linearly with dose over the dose range 0.2 – 5 mg/kg but more than linear with 
dose over the range 10 – 100 mg/kg. 
Cabozantinib showed to be highly bound to plasma proteins in all pre-clinical species and in humans (>99.7%) 
and widely distributed into body tissues, including passage over the blood:brain barrier, the blood:testes barrier 
and the placenta, as expected based on the moderate to high volume of distribution. In addition, cabozantinib 
has potential to bind to melanin. Partitioning into red blood cells has not been studied pre-clinically but data 
provided in the clinical section showed that XL184 is mainly present in plasma and to a limited extent distributed 
into erythrocytes. Elimination from plasma is slower in rat than in the other pre-clinical species as indicated by 
lower plasma clearance values. In addition, excretion data in rat show that within 24 hours only about a third 
was excreted. Cabozantinib is mainly excreted via faeces in rats.  
Entero-hepatic recirculation of cabozantinib may occur in humans as well as in rats and dogs. However, based 
on the chemical structures of the metabolites readily enabling back-transformation to parent cabozantinib is not 
expected. For the glucuronide conjugates however back transformation is possible by the intestinal flora. 
Drug-drug interactions with antibiotics could occur. Also disruption of the enterohepatic recirculation of 
cabozantinib by other drugs, such as cholestagel or cholestyramine, could occur. In bile duct cannulated rats 
and dogs administered 14C-XL184, mean recoveries of approximately 29% and 15%, respectively, of the 
administered dose were present in bile, suggesting that hepato-biliary excretion plays a predominant role in the 
elimination of absorbed 14C-XL184-related radioactivity in both species. It is unknown whether cabozantinib is 
excreted in milk of lactating animals. 
Hepatic clearance does not play a large role in the elimination of cabozantinib in the pre-clinical species as 
cabozantinib has a low intrinsic clearance value and in vivo only approximately a tenth in rat and a third in 
mouse is metabolised by CYP3A4 and to a much lesser extent CYP2C9. However, not all CYPs are studied for 
involvement in the formation of these metabolites (except for M1). In addition, no data on enzyme involvement 
are available for the other metabolites. In humans however, metabolism is more prominent than in the 
pre-clinical species. The major component in plasma is unchanged parent and exposure to 
XL184-monohydroxysulfate (M4), the main human metabolite, was 25% relative to total plasma exposure. 
Unchanged 14C-XL184 was the major radioactive component detected in plasma and feces from rats and dogs; 
however, it was present at low levels in bile from both species (unchanged 14C-XL184 accounted for only 0.2% 
of the radioactive dose in dog bile). 
Cabozantinib is an inhibitor, but not a substrate, of P-glycoprotein with an IC50 value of 7  μM. The Applicant will 
perform a study investigating whether cabozantinib is a substrate or inhibitor of MRD1, BCRP, BSEP, MRP2, 
OAT1, OAT3, ACT1, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 in 2Q13. Potential inhibitory effects on MATE1 and 
MATE2k also will be addressed. Evaluation of CYP2B6 inhibition by cabozantinib showed a concentration 
dependent inhibition over the range 0.41 to 16 µM with an IC50 value of 10.1 µM. As this IC50 value is higher 
than the IC50 value for CYP2C8 and a clinical drug-drug interaction study did not show inhibitory effects of 
cabozantinib on CYP2C8 in vivo, it is not expected that cabozantinib will inhibit CYP2B6 in vivo. Cabozantinib is 
not expected to inhibit or induce CYPs in humans at clinically relevant concentrations. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Acute effects in rats showed as possible hepatotoxicity and hematopoietic tissue toxicity with death at 300 
mg/kg. Dogs showed less sensitive for acute doses with minimal evidence of toxicity at 2000 mg/kg.

Repeat dose toxicity 
In rats the most important target tissues for cabozantinib-related toxicity after 2 weeks of oral gavage are GI 
tract, bone marrow, lymphoid tissues, reproductive tract tissues, endocrine tissues, liver and kidney. The 
adverse effects were generally dose related and seen from 5 mg/kg/day and above and were generally 
reversible upon discontinuation of treatment. At the maximum dose of 1 mg/kg/day during the 6 month study, 
mild and mostly reversible effects were seen on liver and kidney. Because one animal died possibly test 
article-related, the NOAEL was considered 0.3 mg/kg/day. Based on the AUC of plasma exposures this is 0.2- to 
0.3-fold of the intended clinical exposure.  
At high dose (≥100 mg/kg for 4-14 days), cabozantinib causes hematopoietic- and hepatotoxicity, and 
dehydration in dogs. Also targets for toxicity are GI-tract, lymphoid tissues, testes, bone, pancreas, gallbladder, 
eye and possibly CNS tissues. Lesions were reversible at 100 mg/kg. No treatment-related histopathologic 
changes were present at 10 mg/kg for 14 days. At the maximum dose of 5 mg/kg/day during the 6 month study, 
no signs of toxicity were evident, but some effects occurred in reproductive tissues. An extra chronic study with 
20 mg/kg showed some reversible hematopoietic- and hepatotoxicity, and effects on skin. The histological 
appearance of testes, epididymis, ovaries, mammary glands, and uterus was similar to animals that have not 
attained complete sexual maturity, which was not the case in the control animals. The NOAEL was considered to 
be 5 mg/kg, which is about 0.2-fold of the intended clinical exposure.

Moderate to severe hypopigmentation was observed in a 6-month repeat-dose toxicity study in dogs 
(XL184-NC-018), at exposure levels below expected human exposure level, leading to discoloured skin and hair, 
resembling vitiligo in humans. Rat distribution studies have demonstrated that XL184-related radioactivity is 
retained and accumulated in pigmented ocular tissue. Due to the use of non-pigmented animals in the long-term 
repeat-dose rat study, similar findings in pigmented rats cannot be excluded. Although cabozantinib appears to 
accumulate and retain in ocular tissue, the skin and hair depigmentation observed with cabozantinib is most 
likely related to inhibition of c-KIT, and is not considered a concern for the pigmentation of the eye.

Carcinogenicity 
Although not required for the indication in advance RCC, a two-year carcinogenicity study in rats is currently 
ongoing, and will be submitted when finalised. XL184 was not carcinogenic in a 26-week oral carcinogenicity 
study in rasH2 mice at estimated plasma exposure levels close to expected clinical exposure levels.  
Reproductive Toxicity 
Cabozantinib-related effects on male and female reproductive organs were observed in rats, leading to reduced 
fertility at ≥1 mg/kg/day for females and ≥2.5 mg/kg/day for males. Paternal toxicity showed from  2.5 
mg/kg/day (death, pale ears, thin appearance, missing teeth, extremely white, excessively long, malocclusion, 
cut or curved upward; hair coat yellow, red or rough in appearance, and faecal changes). Comparable toxicity 
showed in females also from 2.5 mg/kg, but less severe. Weights of testes, epididymis, prostate and seminal 
vesicles decreased and reductions occurred in sperm count and concentration from 2.5 mg/kg. No fertile males 
were present at 2.5 and above. A dose-related prolongation of diestrus showed at 2.5 mg/kg. Although the 
majority of females had confirmed matings, the male/female fertility index was 0% at 2.5 and 5 mg/kg; there 
were no pregnancies in either group. Female fertility and embryo/foetal viability were reduced at 1 mg/kg. 
Effects are below or around the intended human exposure. 
In line with these findings, histopathological findings were observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies in dogs 
(reduced testes weight and hypospermatogenensis at > 1 mg/kg/day; reduced ovary weight at ≥0.2 
mg/kg/day). At present, the reversibility of the effects on male and female fertility is not known. Consequently, 
the need for advice regarding fertility preservation measures is stated in the SmPC in section 4.6. 
CHMP assessment report

In rats, maternal toxicity showed at 5 mg/kg cabozantinib. Embryo/foetal viability and development were 
adversely affected at ≥ 0.6 mg/kg. Based on a treatment-related increase in post-implantation loss at ≥0.03 
mg/kg/day, the NOEL for embryo/foetal viability was determined to be 0.01 mg/kg/day, which is <1% than the 
human exposure.  
In rabbits, the NOAEL for maternal toxicity and embryo-foetal viability and growth was 3 mg/kg. The NOEL for 
teratology was 1.0 mg/kg, equating to a plasma exposure <0.1-fold of the intended human dose.  
Malformations were not observed in the decisive embryo-foetal study in rats dosed up to 0.1 mg/kg/day. 
However, oedema, cleft palate/lip, dermal aplasia and kinked/rudimentary tail were observed in the dose-range 
study at 0.6 mg/kg/day, without maternal toxicity. In rabbits, cabozantinib-related foetal visceral variations / 
malformations occurred at 3 mg/kg/day in the decisive study, reflected by small or missing intermediate lobe of 
lungs, reduced spleens (7 foetuses in one litter), and a significant increase in the foetal incidence of total 
malformations, albeit at a maternally toxic dose.  
Thus animal studies show reproductive toxicity at exposure levels far below human exposure levels at the 
intended clinical dose, therefore, cabozantinib should not be used during pregnancy. 
In a definitive pre- and postnatal development study in rats (study results submitted as part of variation II/12 
for Cometriq), pregnant dams were dosed from gestation day (GD) 10, and not from GD6, as indicated in ICH 
S5(R2). However, due to the substantial post-implantation loss in the embryo-foetal toxicity study when dosed 
from GD6, dosing from GD10 is considered acceptable. No significant XL184-related effects were observed in the 
definitive study at maternal doses up to 0.3 mg/kg/day. The level in milk was not determined, but measurable 
plasma concentrations were present in pups on PND4 and PND21, indicating exposure via milk. At NOAEL, 
maternal plasma levels (71.4 ng/ml) were substantially below expected human exposure (1220 ng/ml). The 
relevance of such a study is therefore questionable.

Juvenile toxicity 
Juvenile  animals  were  dosed  at  PND  21-70.  Major,  reversible  findings    following  treatment  from  PND21-35 
(cohort 1) were limited to increased WBC parameters, decreased haematopoiesis, pubescent/immature female 
reproductive system (without delayed vaginal opening), and reduced bone mineral content and density. Major 
findings  following  treatment  from  PND21-70  (cohort  2)  were  increased  WBC  parameters,  increased 
haematopoiesis, tooth abnormalities, reduced bone mineral density and content, liver pigmentation and bile

duct hyperplasia. The observed effects on uterus/ovaries and decreased haematopoiesis seen in cohort 1 were 
not seen in cohort 2, suggesting transient effects, while effects on bone parameters and liver pigmentation were 
sustained. Findings from the juvenile toxicity study have been included in the SPC section 5.3.

Interspecies comparison 
There  are  some  differences  in  oral  bioavailability  of  the  L-malate  salt  between  the  pre-clinical  species 
investigated: ~90% in rats and ~55% in dogs. No absolute bioavailability was determined for humans. 
Volume of distribution was comparable across mouse and rat (i.e. ~0.9 and ~0.6 L/kg, respectively) but was 
significantly  lower  than  in  dog  and  monkey  (i.e.  ~2.1  and  ~2.7  L/kg).  Further,  plasma  clearance  was 
approximately one order of magnitude lower in rat (i.e. ~0.030 – 0.045 L/kg/hr) than in the other pre-clinical 
species (i.e. 0.23 – 0.64 L/kg/hr). In line with this, plasma half-lives were also comparable between mouse, dog 
and monkey (i.e. ~3 – 4 hours) and longer in rat (i.e. ~12 – 13 hours). In humans, elimination of XL184 was 
much slower than in the pre-clinical species. The volume of distribution (Vc/F) was much larger in humans than 
in the pre-clinical species, i.e. ~5.8 L/kg. The clearance (CL/F) was in the same order of magnitude as in rats 
(0.07 L/kg/hr), but plasma half-life was much longer with 120 hours.  
Plasma protein binding of XL184 was high in all species, including humans.

Metabolism of XL184 is more prominent in humans than in the pre-clinical species. However, no unique human 
metabolites were found. Furthermore, XL184 is mainly excreted via faeces in both rats and humans but urine is 
a more important route of excretion in humans than in rats. Further comparison of metabolism and excretion 
across pre-clinical species and humans is hampered by several facts: 1) in vivo metabolism of XL184 in the 
different species is elucidated at different dosages and dosing regiments; 2) the excretion of XL184 has not been 
investigated in dog, which is considered as a key animal species for preclinical assessment; 3) the excretion of 
XL184  in  bile  has  not  been  investigated  while  the  presence  of  entero-hepatic  recirculation  is  assumed  in 
humans; 4) the metabolite profile of the excreta has not been determined. 
Local Tolerance  
No specific studies have been conducted to evaluate local tolerance to XL184 administration.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In accordance with CHMP Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), an environmental risk assessment has been submitted for XL184. 
The Applicant has conducted a study for determining Kow.  The presented Kow (5.15 at pH 7.4) is above 4.5, 
and a PBT assessment is required. A Bio-concentration Factor study in accordance with OECD 305 is ongoing, 
and an interim study report (RPT750A-102) has been provided indicating that cabozantinib is not 
bio-accumulative. The final study report will be submitted when finalised (please see conclusion on Non-clinical 
aspects).

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Cabozantinib is a small molecule that inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) implicated in tumour 
growth and angiogenesis, pathologic bone remodeling, and metastatic progression of cancer. Cabozantinib was 
evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases and was identified as an inhibitor of MET 
(hepatocyte growth factor receptor protein) and VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) receptors. In 
addition, cabozantinib inhibits other tyrosine kinases including the GAS6 receptor (AXL), RET, ROS1, TYRO3, 
MER,  the stem cell factor receptor (KIT), TRKB, Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), and TIE-2.   No 
pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were performed. It is agreed that co-medication with products 
having the same pharmacological targets is unlikely. Therefore the absence of pharmacodynamic drug 
interaction studies is agreed. 
The bioavailability of cabozantinib is moderate to high, and it is highly bound to plasma proteins. There are four 
major metabolites, of which the 6-desmethyl half-dimer sulphate (M2a) and the monohydroxysulphate (M4) are 
the most important. In rats Cabozantinib is mainly excreted via faeces. Cabozantinib is an inhibitor, but not a 
substrate, of P-glycoprotein with an IC50 value of 7  μM. No other transporters were investigated. Cabozantinib 
is not expected to inhibit or induce CYPs in humans at clinically relevant concentrations. 
It is unknown whether cabozantinib is excreted in milk of lactating animals. It is not known whether cabozantinib 
and/or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential harm to the infant, mothers should 
discontinue  breast-feeding  during  treatment  with  cabozantinib,  and  for  at  least  4  months  after  completing 
therapy (see SmPC section 4.6).

Adverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to clinical 
exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows: In rat and dog repeat-dose toxicity 
studies up to 6 months duration, target organs for toxicity were GI tract, bone marrow, lymphoid tissues, 
kidney, adrenal and reproductive tract tissues. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for these findings 
were below human clinical exposure levels at intended therapeutic dose (see SmPC section 5.3). 
Cabozantinib has shown no mutagenic or clastogenic potential in a standard battery of genotoxicity assays. 
Regarding  the  results  of  the  26-week  oral  carcinogenicity  study  in  rasH2  mice  model  the  following  text  is 
included  in  the  SmPC:  “Cabozantinib  was  not  carcinogenic  in  the  rasH2  mouse  model  at  a  slightly  higher 
exposure than the human therapeutic exposure”, in line with the Cometriq SmPC. 
Fertility studies in rats have shown reduced male and female fertility and shows reproductive toxicity at lower 
levels  than  the  intended  human  exposure.  Further,  hypospermatogenesis  was  observed  in  male  dogs  at 
exposure levels below human clinical exposure levels at intended therapeutic dose (see SmPC section 5.3).  
There are no data on human fertility. Both men and women should be advised to seek advice and consider 
fertility preservation before treatment (see SmPC sedction 4.6). 
Embryo-foetal development studies were performed in rats and rabbits. In rats, cabozantinib caused 
postimplantation loss, foetal edema, cleft palate/lip, dermal aplasia and kinked or rudimentary tail. In rabbits,  
cabozantinib produced foetal soft tissue changes (reduced spleen size, small or missing intermediate lung lobe) 
and increased foetal incidence of total malformations. NOAEL for embryo-foetal toxicity and teratogenic findings 
were below human clinical exposure levels at intended therapeutic dose (see SmPC section 5.3).  There are no 
studies in pregnant women using cabozantinib. The potential risk for humans is unknown. Cabozantinib should 
not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with cabozantinib 
(see SmPC sections 4.6).  
Women of childbearing potential must be advised to avoid pregnancy while on cabozantinib. Female partners of 
male patients taking cabozantinib must also avoid pregnancy. Effective methods of contraception should be 
used by male and female patients and their partners during therapy, and for at least 4 months after completing 
therapy. Because oral contraceptives might possibly not be considered as “effective methods of contraception,” 
they should be used together with another method, such as a barrier method (see SmPC sections 4.6 and 4.5 
and Discussion on clinical pharmacology). 
Juvenile rats (comparable to a >2 year old pediatric population) administered cabozantinib showed increased 
WBC parameters, decreased haematopoiesis, pubescent/immature female reproductive system (without 
delayed vaginal opening), tooth abnormalities, reduced bone mineral content and density, liver pigmentation 
and bile duct hyperplasia. Findings in uterus/ovaries and decreased haematopoiesis appeared to be transient, 
while effects on bone parameters and liver pigmentation were sustained. Evaluations in juvenile rats 
(comparable to a <2 year old pediatric population) have not been performed (see SmPC section 5.3). 
In  accordance  with  ICH  S9,  evaluation  of  metabolites  is  generally  not  warranted  in  patients  with  advanced 
cancer. However, metabolites M1, M2a (EXEL 1644), M4 and M8 are in much higher concentrations in humans 
than in the used animal models, especially M2a and M4 (about 39% and 13% of the total amount respectively). 
M1 and M8 are of low abundance in humans and are not expected to be genotoxic (M1 is not mutagenic in Ames 
test and M8 has no structural alert). M4 shows little pharmacodynamic activity and is not mutagenic in the Ames 
test. According to ICH S9 it is not necessary to test metabolites M1, M4 and M8 further for toxicity.  
The toxicity and pharmacology studies performed with metabolites EXEL-1644 and EXEL-1646 do not indicate a 
safety concern.

The applicant qualified the impurity ortho-fluoro cabozantinib in a 2 week rat  study.  It is not expected that 
ortho-fluoro cabozantinib will influence the safety of the product.  
Potential genotoxic impurities in XL184 drug substance were identified and found positive in the Ames test. The 
specifications  of  the  genotoxic  impurities  in  the  product  are  slightly  higher  than  the  threshold  of  toxicologic 
concern  (TTC)  value  of  1.5  μg/day.  However,  it  is  agreed  that  specifications  higher  than  the  TTC  may  be 
acceptable under certain conditions, e.g. short-term exposure, for treatment of a life-threatening condition, or 
when life expectancy is less than 5 years (Guideline on the limits of genotox impurities), which is the case. 
Cabozantinib is not phototoxic.   
In order to complete the PBT assessment, the study report for the ongoing bioconcentration factor study has to 
be submitted when completed. Provided that the final report confirms the interim study report indicating a BCFk 
below   2,000, cabozantinib is not considered a PBT substance, and no further actions will be required. The final 
study report should be submitted as a post-approval commitment. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In general, the non-clinical data were of good quality and meet the requirements to support this application.  
The CHMP recommended that the submission of the final report of the ongoing two-year carcinogenicity study in 
rats (Study XL184-NC-036) should be submitted post approval. 
The CHMP also recommended that the ongoing bio -concentration factor study needs to be submitted when 
completed.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The body of text of this PK assessment is based on the data for Cometriq. However, for the RCC indication, three 
additional main clinical studies (XL184-010, XL184-020 and XL184-308) supporting the pharmacokinetics of the 
tablet formulation and the pharmacokinetics in the RCC population have been submitted. Also updated new 
information was submitted, as assessed in the variations for Cometriq to include information generated as part 
of the PAMs agreed for the MA approval. 
Method validations established linearity, sensitivity. Inter- and intra-assay precision of all methods was within 
±15% relative standard deviation, and accuracy within ±15%. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters from plasma concentrations of cabozantinib were calculated using 
non-compartmental techniques for the biopharmaceutical studies and population-PK analysis for the clinical 
pharmacology studies. 
Descriptive analysis was provided for the biopharmaceutical studies. 
Absorption  
Following a single oral dose, cabozantinib was absorbed with maximum plasma concentrations of cabozantinib 
achieved at median time of 2 to 5 hours post-dose across studies in healthy volunteers and cancer patients. 
Multiple peaks in the plasma concentration-time profile following a single oral dose suggest that cabozantinib is 
enterohepatically recirculated. 
The absolute bioavailability of cabozantinib has not been determined. Based on the provided mass balance 
study, however, at least 27% of the administered cabozantinib is renally excreted, and thus at least this fraction 
of the administered dose was absorbed.  
A high-fat meal moderately increased cabozantinib Cmax and AUC values by 41% and 57%, respectively, 
relative to fasted conditions in healthy volunteers. Based on this food-effect study, the Applicant decided to 
administer cabozantinib under fasted conditions, i.e., the patients are instructed not to eat for at least 2 hours 
before and 1 hour after taking cabozantinib. The fasting conditions was applied in all clinical studies.  
•  Bioavailability and bioequivalence 
The cabozantinib tablet dosage form is an immediate-release formulation consisting of cabozantinib (S)-malate 
drug substance combined with standard excipients and film-coated. The same cabozantinib tablet formulation 
that was used in pivotal Phase 3 study XL184-308 in subjects with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the proposed 
commercial formulation. Prior to the tablet formulation, cabozantinib was provided as capsules using the same 
cabozantinib drug substance. Capsules were dosed in many of the clinical studies, including the first-in-human 
study XL184-001, clinical pharmacology studies, and Phase 3 study XL184-301 in medullary thyroid cancer 
(MTC).  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/664123/2016 
Page 35/119 
  
  
 
The tablets yield higher exposure than the capsules, and the two formulations are not bioequivalent, as such the 
two formulations are not interchangeable: the tablet formulation will be the only marketed cabozantinib drug 
product formulation for the treatment of RCC, and will be marketed as a distinct product from the cabozantinib 
capsules.  
Distribution 
Cabozantinib was highly plasma protein bound at all concentration levels tested; the percentage not extensively 
bind to erythrocytes. The popPK estimated volume of the central compartment (Vc/F) was approximately 350 l 
in MTC. The popPK estimate of Vc/F in the combined HV and RCC patients analysis was 81.45 (68.5, 96.8)) L. 
Metabolism 
The following metabolites of cabozantinib were characterised in plasma: XL184-N-oxide, 
XL184-monohydroxysulphate, XL184 half dimer, half-dimer methyl ester, 6-demethyl half-dimer sulphate, 
7-demethyl half-dimer sulphate, demethyl XL184 glucuronide A and B. The 6-demethyl half-dimer sulfate 
metabolite is the main circulating metabolite, and more abundant than cabozantinib in plasma. Based on 
LC-MS/MS analysis, mean exposure ratios for cabozantinib and metabolites XL184-half-dimer, XL184-N-oxide, 
XL184-sulfate and 6-demethyl half-dimer sulfate relative to total exposure (AUC0-t (each analyte)/AUC0-t 
(parent + 4 metabolites)) were 32.4%, 3.09%, 4.90%, 13.8% and 45.9%, respectively. The t1/2 of the major 
6-demethyl half-dimer sulfate metabolite could not be determined, but is much longer than that of cabozantinib 
and the other characterised metabolites. In vitro data indicate that the formation of the XL184-N-oxide 
metabolite is dependent on CYP3A4, and to a lesser extent on CYP2C9. Formation of a number of other 
metabolites seems to be dependent on CYP3A4 as well, although only a limited number of CYPs were tested. It 
appears that non-conjugated metabolites are present only at low levels, and are less active than cabozantinib. 
Elimination 
The plasma terminal half-life of cabozantinib in single dose studies was approximately 120 hours. Cabozantinib 
is eliminated both via the hepatic (at least 54% of the administered dose) and renal route (at least 27%). 
Cabozantinib is not directly excreted in urine, but is present to some extent in faeces. Both in urine and faeces, 
multiple metabolites are detected, with dequinolinyl XL184 glucuronide, dequinolinyl XL184 sulfate, and XL184 
half dimer being the main metabolites in urine, while cabozantinib, M11 (minor metabolite, not identified), 
demethyl XL184, and XL184 oxidation B were the main metabolites in faeces. The popPK estimate of CL/F in the 
combined HV and RCC patients analysis is 2.23 (2.13, 2.34) L/hr. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportional cabozantinib pharmacokinetics was demonstrated for the powder-in-bottle suspension 
formulation up to a dose of approximately 1000 mg. For the capsule formulation dose proportionality was 
assessed less extensively. In cancer patients, comparable - and thus not dose proportional- exposures were 
observed for a 175 and 250 mg cabozantinib malate capsule dose, both after a single dose and under 
steady-state conditions. This may point at limited absorption at this dose, potentially caused by limited solubility 
of cabozantinib. At lower doses in healthy volunteers, the dose-normalised exposure upon administration of 100 
mg or 175 mg cabozantinib malate (78 mg and 138 mg cabozantinib freebase, respectively) appears 
comparable, indicating dose-proportional behaviour between these two doses.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/664123/2016 
Page 36/119 
  
  
The relationship between 3 different cabozantinib tablet strengths (20, 40, and 60 mg [FBE]) and their 
respective PK parameter values was assessed in study XL184-020 in healthy adult subjects. Single doses of 
cabozantinib tablets at 20, 40, and 60 mg FBE dose strengths showed dose-proportional increases in mean 
plasma cabozantinib Cmax and AUC0-t values. Therefore, dose proportionality was concluded for the 
single-dose PK parameters Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-inf. CL/F was also similar across tablet strengths.  
Dose-normalized exposures (AUC0-inf/dose) for the 20, 40, and 60 mg FBE cabozantinib tablet strengths in 
study XL184-020 (520, 528 and 535 ng.h/mL/mg, respectively) were similar to that of the 140 mg FBE 
cabozantinib tablet dose (1x100 mg + 2x20 mg) (470 ng.h/mL/mg) evaluated in the BE study, suggesting 
dose-proportionality over the 20-140 mg tablet dose range.  
Accumulation of cabozantinib upon multiple dosing (AUC and Cmax increase 4.6 and 3.9-fold, respectively) is 
reasonably in line with expected, based on a t1/2 of approximately 120 hours. Steady state appears to be 
reached after 15 days of OD dosing. No major differences are apparent in cabozantinib PK between healthy 
volunteers and cancer patients, with Cmax, AUC and tmax, as well as interindividual variability being 
comparable.  
Target population 
Across the healthy subject studies, after a single dose of cabozantinib (XL184), absorption was slow with the 
median Tmax that occurred at 4 to 5 hours (range: 1.1-24.1); some individual subjects had a prolonged 
absorption phase with a Cmax occurred as late as 24 hours after dosing. Following the peak, plasma 
concentrations declined slowly with the mean terminal t1/2 of 111 to 124 hours across the studies. Cmax, AUCs 
and t1/2 values from healthy subjects dosed at 140 mg FBE capsule dose are consistent across studies 
XL184-004, XL184-006, XL184-007 and XL184-010, and are also consistent with the data observed at a 140 mg 
FBE capsule dose in cancer subjects (Study Report XL184-001.PK.001); mean Cmax and AUC0-24 values were 
approximately 6% and 12% lower in healthy subjects compared with subjects with cancer.  
Population PK model and Exposure-response model 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis of cabozantinib was performed using data collected from 282 patients 
with RCC and 63 normal healthy volunteers following oral administration of doses of 20 mg, 40 mg, and 60 mg.  
•  A two-compartment disposition model with dual (fast and slow) lagged first-order absorption processes 
adequately characterized the concentration-time profile of cabozantinib in healthy subjects and patients 
with RCC.  
• 
• 
The predicted PK parameter values for a typical White male subject were: approximately 99 hours for 
terminal plasma half-life, approximately 319 L for terminal phase volume of distribution (Vz), and 
approximately 2.23 L/hr for steady state oral clearance (CL/F). Inter-individual variability (IIV) in 
clearance (%CV for CL/F) was estimated to be 46%.  
Female gender and Asian race were significant covariates on CL/F, where female subjects had 21% 
lower CL/F compared with male subjects and Asian subjects had 27% lower CL/F compared with White 
subjects.  
•  Covariates determined to have a non-significant effect on CL/F were age, baseline body mass index, 
baseline hemoglobin, baseline total bilirubin, baseline alanine aminotransferase, baseline serum 
albumin, baseline calculated creatinine clearance and population (healthy subjects or patients with 
RCC).

Exposure-Response: 
•  No statistically significant relationship was identified between average cabozantinib concentration and 
early overall survival based upon a dataset from a pre-specified interim analysis cut-off (22 May 2015).  
•  A statistically significant relationship was identified between average cabozantinib concentration and 
progression free survival. Increases in cabozantinib concentrations are predicted to decrease the rate of 
disease progression. At expected steady-state average cabozantinib concentrations for the 20 mg, 40 
mg, and 60 mg doses, limited separation in the survivor functions for progression free survival is 
predicted. Subjects with shorter times to disease progression for prior tyrosine kinase therapy (< 3 
months) were predicted to have a decreased cabozantinib maximum effect relative to subjects that had 
progressive disease after 3 months on earlier therapy, resulting in an increased hazard ratio and a 
steeper progression free survival curve. 
•  A statistically significant relationship was identified between individual predicted cabozantinib clearance 
and the rate of dose modifications (i.e., reductions, holds, or interruptions). Decreases in cabozantinib 
clearance were predicted to increase the rate of dose modifications. 
•  A statistically significant relationship was identified between average cabozantinib concentration and 
fatigue/asthenia, PPE, hypertension, and diarrhea.  
•  No statistically significant relationship was identified between average cabozantinib concentration and 
nausea/vomiting or stomatitis. 
Special populations 
Impaired renal and hepatic function  
The results of Study XL184-017 in subjects with mild or moderate impaired renal function showed that Cmax 
and AUCs (AUC0-t and AUC0-inf) were 19% and 30% higher, respectively, for subjects with mild renal 
impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function when given a 60 mg dose. Both Cmax and AUC 
values (AUC0-t and AUC0-inf) of cabozantinib appeared to be similar between the moderate impairment and the 
control cohorts (differences: less than 3% and 7%, respectively).  
The results of Study XL184-003 in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment showed an 81% and 
63% increase in cabozantinib AUC after a 60 mg dose.

Gender, race, age and weight 
In the population-PK analysis of cabozantinib in RCC patients, female gender and Asian race were significant 
covariates on CL/F, where female subjects had 21% lower CL/F compared with male subjects and Asian subjects 
had 27% lower CL/F compared with White subjects.  
While the attributes of Asian race and female gender were statistically significant, they were not deemed 
clinically meaningful given the magnitude of the effects. In addition, the small number of Asian females (n=3) 
included in this PopPK analysis were insufficient to perform a meaningful analysis to understand the combined 
effect of a potential interaction between Asian race and female gender effects; however, these 3 Asian females 
did have individual clearance and drug exposure (AUC) values within the range of all other subjects in the study 
and were not considered outliers. In addition, the predicted effects of female gender and Asian race on CL/F are 
both lower than the calculated inter-individual variability in clearance (%CV of CL/F = 46%). 
Covariates determined to have a non-significant effect on CL/F were age, baseline body mass index, baseline 
hemoglobin, baseline total bilirubin, baseline alanine aminotransferase, baseline  serum albumin, baseline 
calculated creatinine clearance and population (healthy subjects or subjects with RCC). 
The PK of cabozantinib has not yet been characterized in the paediatric population. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The Applicant has carried out four drug interaction studies of cabozantinib with rifampin (rifampicin) (Study 
XL184-006), ketoconazole (Study XL184-007), rosiglitazone (Study XL184-008), and esomeprazole, a proton 
pump inhibitor (Study XL184-018). The results from these studies are included in the SmPC for cometriq 
capsules and are carried through to the SmPC for Cabometyx. 
Effect of other drugs on cabozantinib pharmacokinetics.  
Cabozantinib is a substrate for CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent CYP2C9. Administration of the strong CYP3A4 
inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg daily for 27 days) to healthy volunteers decreased cabozantinib clearance (by 
29%) and increased single-dose plasma cabozantinib exposure (AUC) by 38%. Administration of the strong 
CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin (600 mg daily for 31 days) to healthy volunteers increased cabozantinib clearance 
(4.3-fold) and decreased single-dose plasma cabozantinib exposure (AUC) by 77% (see Discussion on clinical 
pharmacology). The solubility of cabozantinib is pH dependent, with very low solubility observed at a pH >3. The 
type II variation for cometriq (EMEA/H/C/2640/II/0006) included the results of study XL184-018 to assess 
interactions with drugs affecting gastric pH. The SmPC and the package leaflet were updated to delete the 
warning on concomitant use with proton pump inhibitors.  
Effect of cabozantinib on PK of other drugs.  
Based on the in vitro inhibition assays, cabozantinib is not expected to inhibit CYPs in vivo to a significant extent. 
Cabozantinib did not significantly inhibit CYP2C8 in vivo in a rosiglitazone drug-drug interaction study. With 
respect to induction by cabozantinib, no in vivo induction of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 is suggested by in vitro studies. Results of study reports XL184-NC-039, 043 and 048 
provided post approval for Cometriq, provided sufficient data related to substrate and inhibition characteristics 
of cabozantinib towards different transporters (including interaction with P-glycoprotein). Based on these data, 
the removal of the safety warning regarding “drug interaction with individual drug transporters including P 
glycoprotein substances” was found acceptable.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Cabozantinib is a small molecule that inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) implicated in tumour 
growth and angiogenesis, pathologic bone remodelling, and metastatic progression of cancer. Cabozantinib was 
evaluated in non-clinical studies for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases and was identified as an 
inhibitor of MET (hepatocyte growth factor receptor protein) and VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) 
receptors, In addition, cabozantinib inhibits other tyrosine kinases including the GAS6 receptor (AXL), RET, 
ROS1, TYRO3, MER,  the stem cell factor receptor (KIT), TRKB, Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), and TIE-2.    
Primary pharmacology 
Plasma  markers  of  angiogenic  pathways  have  been  evaluated  in  previous  clinical  studies  of  anti-VEGFR2 
tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors,  e.g.  for  sunitinib.  The  common  finding  from  trials  of  small  molecule  anti-VEGFR2 
agents is an increase in the circulating levels of VEGF and PlGF, and a decrease in the level of soluble VEGFR2 
(sVEGFR2)  upon  treatment.  Therefore,  in  the  Phase  1  dose  finding  Study  XL184-001,  these  three  plasma 
markers were investigated. 
In addition to these three VEGFR2 pathway biomarkers, two additional plasma proteins were assessed on an 
exploratory basis in Study XL184-001. Soluble MET (sMET) was chosen due to the possible effects of MET or 
VEGFR2 inhibition on regulation of the MET receptor, and erythropoietin (EPO) was evaluated, as levels of EPO 
have been shown increase as a consequence of VEGF pathway inhibition in preclinical models ascribed to an 
upregulation of hepatic erythropoietin expression.  
In thl phase 3 study of cabozantinib XL184-301, changes in soluble KIT receptor (sKIT) were evaluated as a 
biomarker of KIT pathway inhibition as well. 
In Study XL184-001, the change in plasma levels for VEGF, sVEGFR2, PlGF, EPO, and sMET were monitored. 
Three of the markers (sVEGFR2, PlGF, EPO) demonstrated statistically significant changes upon treatment when 
Day 29 pre-dose levels (175 mg daily cohort only) when compared to pre-treatment levels (Table 11).

Table 15 - Summary of change in plasma biomarkers between day 1 and day 29 after O.D. treatment with 175 
mg cabozantinib as capsule formulation (Study XL184-001) 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
In  Study  XL184-001,  to  understand  whether  there  is  a  concentration  dependency  in  the  exposure/response 
relationship for XL184 plasma exposure and the biomarkers, the plasma levels for VEGF, sVEGFR2, PlGF, EPO, 
and  sMET  were  plotted  against  the  concurrent  plasma  concentration,  the  calculated  plasma  Cmax,  and  the 
average plasma concentration (Cave) of XL184. No statistically significant relationship exists between the Cmax 
values  of  XL184  and  the  plasma  biomarker  concentrations  (data  not  shown).  Use  of  Cave  instead  of  XL184 
concentrations led to a weaker relationship between exposure and response; only PlGF and sVEGFR2 maintained 
statistical significance. While there was clear evidence for a concentration dependence of the effect of XL184 on 
the four plasma biomarkers described above, the slopes of the effect curves were relatively flat, indicating that 
this pharmacodynamic effect is not highly dependent upon concurrent XL184 concentration and that the effect 
is measurable over a broad range of concentrations. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology package for cabozantinib (Cabometyx) in advanced RCC builds on the clinical 
pharmacology package for cabozantinib in MTC (Cometriq), with three additional studies to characterize the new 
tablet formulation and the pharmacokinetics in RCC patients. This was considered acceptable.  
The tablets yield higher exposures than the capsules, and the two formulations are not bioequivalent. The two 
formulations are not interchangeable: the tablet formulation will be the only marketed cabozantinib drug 
product formulation for the treatment of RCC, and will be marketed as a distinct product from the cabozantinib 
capsules.

Following oral administration of cabozantinib, peak cabozantinib plasma concentrations are reached at 2 to 5 
hours post dose. Repeat daily dosing of cabozantinib at 140 mg for 19 days resulted in an approximately a 4  to 
5 fold mean cabozantinib accumulation (based on AUC) compared to a single dose administration; steady state 
is achieved by approximately Day 15. A high-fat meal moderately increased Cmax and AUC values (41% and 
57%, respectively) relative to fasted conditions in healthy volunteers administered a single 140 mg oral 
cabozantinib dose. There is no information on the precise food effect when taken 1 hour after administration of 
cabozantinib (see SmPC section 5.2). Based on the population-pharmacokinetic (PK) model, the volume of 
distribution (V/F) is approximately 349 L (SE: ± 2.73%).  
The sponsor has not submitted new phase I/II dose finding PK/PD studies for the current application. Sparse PK 
data has been collected in the pivotal study XL-184-308 to characterize the PK in RCC patients and confirm that 
the expected exposure levels is reached. No major differences was reported in cabozantinib PK between healthy 
volunteers and MTC cancer patients, with Cmax, AUC and tmax, as well as interindividual variability being 
comparable to a reasonable extent. The population model shows different PK estimates of CL and Vd in RCC 
patients compared to MTC patients. However, an exact cause has yet to be identified.  Based on the integrated 
PopPK analysis, non-MTC cancer patient cohorts (including RCC patients) appear to have comparable 
cabozantinib clearance to that of healthy volunteers. Thus based on this analysis, no specific starting dosing 
adjustments are required when administering cabozantinib to RCC patients. 
Cabozantinib is highly protein bound in vitro in human plasma (≥ 99.7%). Results from a study in subjects with 
hepatic impairment (Study Report XL184-003) indicated that exposure (AUC0-inf) was increased by 81% and 
63% in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, respectively (90% CIs for AUC0-inf: 121.44, 
270.34% for mild impairment and 107.37, 246.67% for moderate impairment) compared with healthy subjects 
after a 60mg dose. Patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied. Based on the potential 
magnitude of increased cabozantinib exposure in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, a more 
conservative proposal of a reduced (40 mg once daily) starting dose of Cabometyx in patients with mild or 
moderate hepatic impairment can be justified in order to minimize risk of treatment-related AEs due to elevated 
cabozantinib plasma exposures in these patient populations. Cabometyx is not recommended for use in patients 
with severe hepatic impairment. 
Cabozantinib was metabolized in vivo. Four metabolites were present in plasma at exposures (AUC) greater than 
10% of parent: XL184 N oxide, XL184 amide cleavage product, XL184 monohydroxy sulfate, and 6 desmethyl 
amide cleavage product sulfate. Two non-conjugated metabolites (XL184-N oxide and XL184 amide cleavage 
product), which possess <1% of the on-target kinase inhibition potency of parent cabozantinib, each represent 
<10% of total drug-related plasma exposure. 
Cabozantinib is a substrate for CYP3A4 metabolism in vitro, as a neutralizing antibody to CYP3A4 inhibited 
formation of metabolite XL184 N oxide by >80% in a NADPH-catalyzed human liver microsomal (HLM) 
incubation; in contrast, neutralizing antibodies to CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and 
CYP2E1 had no effect on cabozantinib metabolite formation. A neutralizing antibody to CYP2C9 showed a 
minimal effect on cabozantinib metabolite formation (i.e., a <20% reduction). 
The plasma terminal half-life of cabozantinib in single dose studies in healthy volunteers is approximately 120 
hours. Mean clearance (CL/F) at steady-state in cancer patients was estimated to be 4.4 L/hr in a population PK 
analysis. Within a 48 day collection period after a single dose of 14C-cabozantinib in healthy volunteers, 
approximately 81% of the total administered radioactivity was recovered with 54% in faeces and 27% in urine. 
Data obtained in study XL184-017 to assess the PK of cabozantinib in subjects with impaired renal function was 
assessed as part of variation II/11 for Cometriq. The results of Study XL184-017 in subjects with mild or 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/664123/2016 
Page 42/119 
  
  
moderate impaired renal function showed that Cmax and AUCs (AUC0-t and AUC0-inf) were 19% and 30% higher, 
respectively, for subjects with mild renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function when 
given a 60 mg dose. Both Cmax and AUC values (AUC 0-t and AUC0-inf) of cabozantinib appeared to be similar 
between the moderate impairment and the control cohorts (differences: less than 3% and 7%, respectively). 
The CHMP considered that in light of the safety profile of cabozantinib at the recommended starting dose of 140 
mg, a 30% increase in AUC in case of mild renal impairment warrants caution, in line with the caution advised 
in case of interaction between cabozantinib and CYP3A4 inhibitors. Therefore, a warning has been included in 
the SmPC regarding dosing in renal impairment.  
There is little experience with cabozantinib in non-White patients (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.2).  
No specific dose adjustment for the use of cabozantinib in older people (≥ 65 years) is recommended.  
Cabozantinib has not yet been investigated in the paediatric population. The lack of data in the population <18 
years is indicated in the SmPC (see section 4.2). 
Cabozantinib is a substrate for CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent CYP2C9. Co-administration of strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, grapefruit juice) with cabozantinib should 
be approached with caution. Chronic co-administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., dexamethasone, 
phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, phenobarbital or herbal preparations containing St. John’s Wort 
[Hypericum perforatum]) with cabozantinib should be avoided. Selection of an alternative concomitant 
medicinal product with no or minimal potential to induce or inhibit CYP3A4 should be considered (see SmPC 
sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.5). 
Non-conjugated metabolites are present only at relatively low (total as well as unbound) levels, and are less 
active than cabozantinib. Low activity of the relatively abundant XL184 monohydroxysulphate and 6 demethyl 
half-dimer sulfate metabolite was observed. Therefore, cabozantinib parent is indicated to be pivotal for its 
cabozantinib’s PD activity. 
Considering the limited importance of a number of metabolites (<10% of parent cabozantinib) further data 
regarding into identification of UGT pathways (leading to M3 and M8) and carboxyamidases (leading to M7) are 
not considered necessary. However, considering the importance of the 6-demethyl half-dimer sulfate (M2a) and 
XL184 monohydroxy sulfate (M9), the applicant was recommended (as part of Cometriq’s MA) to perform 
further in vitro experiments on the identification of the sulphotransferases responsible for formation of 
6-demethyl half-dimer sulfate (M2a) and XL184 monohydroxy sulfate (M9) metabolites. The results of this study 
were assessed as part of variation II/07 for Cometriq.The sulphotransferases involved in the metabolism of 
EXEL-5526 (XL184 monohydroxy) and EXEL-1744 (XL184 mono-desmethyl hydroxy amide cleavage product) 
have been identified. Multiple SULTs are involved for both metabolites, i.e., SULT1A1, SULT1A2, SULT2A1 and 
SULT1A3 for EXEL-5526, and SULT1A1, SULT1A2, SULT1A3 and SULT1E1 for EXEL-1744. It was further 
demonstrated that back-transformation of cabozantinib XL184 does not occur upon deconjugation of EXEL-1646 
and EXEL-1644. 
At the time of granting the marketing authorisation of Cometriq, the MAH was requested to conduct an 
additional study to assess interactions with drugs affecting gastric pH as part of the pharmacovigilance plan of 
the risk-management plan (RMP). In variation II/06, the MAH submitted the results of a Drug-Drug Interaction 
Study XL184-018 with medicinal products affecting gastric pH, esomeprazole and Famotidine. Results from the 
phase I drug-drug interaction study XL184-018 to investigate the effect of esomeprazole on the single-dose 
plasma pharmacokinetics of cabozantinib (XL184) demonstrated that co-administration of multiple doses 
esomeprazole 40 mg did not result in any statistically significant decrease in cabozantinib plasma PK 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/664123/2016 
Page 43/119 
  
  
parameters. Therefore, no clinically significant drug-drug interaction in subjects taking both cabozantinib and a 
proton pump inhibitor was considered likely. 
At the time of granting the marketing authorisation of Cometriq, the MAH was requested to conduct an 
additional nonclinical Study XL184-NC-039 evaluating Cabozantinib as a Substrate and Inhibitor of a Panel of 
Human Drug Transporters (MEA 006) as part of the pharmacovigilance plan of the risk-management plan (RMP). 
The MAH submitted the results of this study in variation II/05 for Cometriq. Cabozantinib may be a substrate of 
transporter MRP2, but not of the transporters OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, BRCP, BSEP or 
P-gp. In vitro data demonstrate that cabozantinib is a substrate of MRP2. Therefore, administration of MRP2 
inhibitors may result in increases in cabozantinib plasma concentrations (see SmPC section 4.4). 
Cabozantinib demonstrated the potential to inhibit drug transporters MATE1 and MATE2-K (estimated IC50 
values of 5.94 and 3.12 μM, respectively), but showed no marked inhibition of BRCP, BSEP, MRP2, P-gp, OAT1, 
OAT3, OCT1, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 (i.e., IC50 values exceeded the assay incubation concentration evaluated 
of 15 μM, or the cabozantinib solubility limit). In principle therefore, cabozantinib may have the potential to 
increase plasma concentrations of co-administered concomitant medications that are substrates of MATE1 or 
MATE2-K. However, although cabozantinib is an inhibitor of drug transporters MATE1 and MATE2-K in vitro, the 
risk of a clinically-relevant drug interaction by cabozantinib inhibition in vivo appears unlikely, since the IC50 
(3-6 µM) is > 50 fold the unbound Cmax of 40 nM.  
Cabozantinib is an inhibitor of P-gp in vitro. A warning against combination of cabozantinib and P-gp substrates 
has been included in the SmPC (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). At present, the outcome of different in vitro P-gp 
inhibition studies are not in agreement, precluding taking a decision on the need of an in vivo study. In the 
currently provided studies, cabozantinib (50 μM final concentration) showed minimal inhibition potential of P-gp 
mediated transport activities in a Caco-2 cell assay system. However, an IC50 of 7.0 μM for P-gp transport 
activities was determined previously for cabozantinib in a bi-directional assay system using MDCK-MDR1 cells 
(Study Report No. XL184-Disc-037). Therefore, cabozantinib may still have the potential to increase plasma 
concentrations of coadministered substrates of P-gp. Subjects should be cautioned regarding taking a P-gp 
substrate (e.g., fexofenadine, aliskiren, ambrisentan, dabigatran etexilate, digoxin, colchicine, maraviroc, 
posaconazole, ranolazine, saxagliptin, sitagliptin, talinolol, tolvaptan) while receiving cabozantinib. 
The effect of cabozantinib on the pharmacokinetics of contraceptive steroids has not been investigated. As 
unchanged contraceptive effect may not be guaranteed, an additional contraceptive method, such as a barrier 
method, is recommended (see SmPC section 4.5). 
Though cabozantinib is known to inhibit multiple RTKs involved in tumour growth and angiogenesis and 
metastatic progression of cancer, the precise mechanism of action of cabozantinib is not known. In line with the 
in vitro data regarding inhibition of multiple RTKs, certain pathways indeed appeared to be affected in vivo upon 
treatment with 175 mg cabozantinib (S)-malate (138 mg cabozantinib freebase), as shown by changes in 
biomarkers related to inhibition of VEGF, MET and KIT. Overall, the pattern of plasma marker modulation 
measured after cabozantinib exposure, with a significant increase in the circulating levels of VEGF and PlGF, and 
significant decreases in soluble forms of cabozantinib target receptors sVEGFR2 and sKIT after 29 days of 
treatment, is consistent with results reported for other inhibitors of the VEGFR2 signalling pathway, such as 
sunitinib and bevacizumab. Exposure to cabozantinib led to inhibition of the VEGFR2 and KIT receptors and 
downstream signalling pathways. The exposure-dependency of the VEGF, PlGF, VEGFR2 and KIT biomarkers to 
concurrent cabozantinib concentration was statistically significant, though modest. Therefore, a target 
concentration for optimal PD effects cannot be derived from this analysis.

According to current guidelines, additional ECG data are considered appropriate if a new indication or patient 
population are being pursued. The applicant investigated QT interval effects of the 60 mg daily dose in the 
XL-184-308 study. Two QTc F prolongation events > 500ms were observed by investigator assessments in the 
pivotal study. No events were observed by Independent Central Review. However, due to sustained uncertainty 
regarding an effect on QTc-prolongation even when administering this considerable lower dose, a warning in 
Section 4.4 in the SmPC is considered appropriate. 
A substantial amount of patients (79% from 140 mg to 100 mg) in the pivotal XL-184-301 study for the MTC 
indication had to be adjusted to a lower dose. The same was true for patients in the two safety monitoring 
studies XL184-306 and 307 in advanced castrate-resistant prostate cancer, where a dose reduction rate up to 
74 % was observed. Forty % of the patients enrolled in the pivotal phase 3 RCC study (XL-184-308) remained 
at 60 mg throughout the study period. Ten % discontinued study drug due to adverse events, and this was 
similar to the everolimus arm. 
Due to the expressed concerns regarding the proper dose in the advanced MTC setting, a dose-finding study was 
required and a post-authorisation measure (SOB 001.2) was adopted during the approval process. The new 
study in MTC patients is intended to investigate effect and adverse events by cabozantinib treatment in relation 
to dosing with capsules at 140 and 60 mg. Finalisation of the study is not until 2019.    
As a high proportion of patients needed dose reductions also with a starting dose of 60 mg in the RCC setting (to 
40mg and 20 mg) there was an uncertainty on whether the benefit/risk balance could be improved with the use 
of a lower starting dose. The applicant provided additional information on the relation between cabozantinib 
plasma concentration and effect.  Overall, the analyses support the view that the 60 mg dose provides the best 
anti-tumour response, although there is no significant separation of the three dose levels. As expected, higher 
predicted risk of individual AEs were simulated for the 60 mg dose vs the 40 mg and 20 mg dose levels, although 
the simulated 40 mg starting dose was not predicted to dramatically reduce the requirement for dose 
reductions. Overall, the analyses do not provide sufficient evidence to support a change to the current starting 
dose of 60 mg. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of cabozantinib in the RCC population and the new tablet formulation have been 
reasonably well characterized. The new data presented in this submission do not alter the understanding of 
cabozantinib PK. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Activity of cabozantinib in RCC was first observed in the phase I drug interaction study XL184-008. Afterwards 
the sponsor initiated a phase III study with a tablet formulation at a dose of 60 mg in subjects with advanced 
RCC who had received at least one prior VEGFR-TKI.

2.5.1.  Dose response study 
No formal dose response studies have been carried out for the RCC indication. The single-agent maximum 
tolerated dose of cabozantinib was determined to be 140 mg on a daily dosing schedule. This dosing regimen 
was selected based on the results of the phase I dose escalation XL184-001 study, assessed during Cometriq’s 
initial MA. This is the accepted posology for the cabozantinib locally advanced or metastatic medullary thyroid 
carcinoma indication.  
In the phase I XL184-008 study, a dose of 60 mg was the most frequent last dose and the dose with the longest 
duration of treatment for RCC subjects. Clinical activity of a starting dose of 60 mg has also been observed in 
other indications (e.g. castrate resistance prostate cancer and non-small cell lung cancer), higher rates of dose

Prior and subsequent cancer and radiation therapies were recorded by study site staff. No 
concurrent investigational agents were permitted.  
All medications used by the subject during the period from 28 days before randomization 
through 30 days after the date of the decision to permanently discontinue study treatment 
were recorded in the CRFs. 
The first dose of study treatment was to be taken in the clinic (defined as Week 1 Day 1; 
W1D1). The subject was instructed to fast (with the exception of water) for at least 2 
hours before receiving study treatment. Subjects were given their assigned treatment, 
either 60 mg oral cabozantinib with a minimum of 240 mL of water or 10 mg of everolimus 
with a glass of water and then continued to fast for 1 hour while under observation to 
monitor for potential AEs. 
Subjects received treatment as long as they continue to experience clinical benefit in the 
opinion of the investigator (including after progression) or until there was unacceptable 
toxicity or the need for subsequent systemic anticancer treatment. 
Dose reductions for cabozantinib were allowed for unacceptable toxicity, and doses may 
have been modified at any time. First dose level reduction to 40 mg, second dose 
reduction to 20 mg.  Dose interruption and reduction criteria recommendations for 
cabozantinib in order to manage treatment-related AEs were according to toxicity criteria 
(CTCAE v4).  
Dose reductions for everolimus were allowed for management of severe or intolerable 
adverse reactions. If dose reduction was required, the suggested dose was approximately 
50% lower than the daily dose previously administered; investigators were instructed to 
refer to the most recent product package insert/drug label for detailed instructions.

Maintenance 
Phase 
When sufficient data had been collected to adequately evaluate all study endpoints, and 
upon site notification by the Sponsor, subjects could continue study treatment and enter 
the study Maintenance Phase. Upon initiation of the Maintenance Phase, the Sponsor 
considered that the safety and efficacy profile of the drug had been sufficiently established 
for regulatory purposes.  
Subject

Subjects could discontinue study treatment or withdraw their consent to participate in the 
study at any time without prejudice.  
Crossover 
Not permitted. 
Objectives 
The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of cabozantinib compared with everolimus on 
progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in subjects with advanced renal cell cancer that had 
progressed after prior VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Table 20 – Outcomes and endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
Progression-free survival  The primary efficacy variable was duration of PFS as assessed by the IRC per 
RECIST 1.1 and was defined as the time from randomization to the earlier of 
the following events: documented PD per RECIST 1.1 or death due to any 
cause. 
Secondary endpoints 
Overall survival 
Survival status was determined at scheduled visits and every 8 weeks (± 7 
days) after the Post-Treatment Follow-up Visit. Subjects were followed until 
death, consent withdrawn or Sponsor decision to no longer collect these data. 
Objective response rate 
(ORR)  
The ORR was defined as the proportion of subjects for whom the best overall 
response at the time of data cut-off was complete response (CR) or partial 
response (PR) as assessed by the IRC per RECIST 1.1, which was confirmed 
by a subsequent visit ≥ 28 days later. 
Additional endpoints 
Duration of radiographic 
response 
Changes in bone scans 
Duration of response (DOR) was defined as the time from the first tumour 
assessment that documented PR or CR that was subsequently confirmed at 
least 28 days later until the date of documented progression by IRC, per 
RECIST 1.1 
A bone scan response was defined as ≥ 30% decrease from baseline in the 
bone scan lesion area compared to baseline, evaluated by the central IRC. 
Stable Disease, Not meeting the criteria for responder, progressive disease, 
or unable to evaluate, Greater than 30% increase from baseline in bone scan 
lesion area in areas attributable to metastatic disease; or two or more new 
areas of radiotracer uptake attributable to metastatic disease in regions of 
bone that had not previously shown radiotracer uptake. 
A central radiology vendor was used to quantitate bone scan tumour burden 
using computer-assisted detection (CAD) to measure bone scan lesion area 
and defined criteria for response.

Safety and tolerability 
Safety analyses were performed using the Safety population (those that 
received at least one dose of study treatment) 
New or worsening AEs from informed consent through 30 days after the date 
of the decision to permanently discontinue study treatment (related SAEs at 
any time) were documented. Adverse event information was collected at 
study visits and may also have been collected at any time over the phone or 
by spontaneous subject report. 
Adverse event seriousness, severity grade, and relationship to study 
treatment were assessed by the investigator. Severity grade was defined by 
the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) v4. An event was assessed as related to study treatment 
when there was a reasonable possibility that the study treatment caused the 
event. 
Routine safety evaluations included physical examination, vital signs, 
performance status, 12-lead ECG, haematology, serum chemistries, lipid 
tests, coagulation tests, urine tests, serum pregnancy tests (in females of 
childbearing potential), and thyroid function tests. 
Limited PK blood samples were obtained from all subjects in both the 
cabozantinib and everolimus arms. 
The FKSI-19 instrument is a 19-item self-reported questionnaire that 
assesses the most important disease-related symptoms (DRS), treatment 
side effects, and function/well-being associated with advanced kidney 
cancer. The FKSI instrument has been utilized in other pivotal TKI studies in 
RCC.

Tumour assessments 
Screening occurred ≤ 28 days before randomization. Scheduling of assessments post randomisation is shown in 
the table below: 
Table 21 – Scheduling of assessments post randomisation 
Assessment 
Post-Randomization 
Tumour 
assessment: 
CT/MRI 
Chest, 
abdomen, 
pelvis 
CT/MRI of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were performed in all subjects at screening and 
every 8 weeks (±5 days) after randomization (at W9D1, W17D1 etc). Upon completion of 
12 months on study, these assessments were performed every 
12 weeks (± 7 days). 
CT/MRIs were performed per the protocol-defined schedule regardless of whether study 
treatment was reduced, held, or discontinued. For subjects who discontinued study 
treatment before radiographic PD or within 8 weeks* after radiographic PD, final 
radiographic tumour assessments were performed 8 weeks* after radiographic PD. For 
subjects who continued to receive study treatment for more than 8 weeks* after 
radiographic PD, tumour assessments were continued per the protocol-defined schedule 
until study treatment was permanently discontinued (*12 weeks for subjects remaining 
on study treatment for more than 1 year.) 
Tumour 
assessment: 
MRI/CT 
Brain 
MRI (or CT) of the brain was performed in all subjects at screening. After randomization, 
MRI (or CT) scans of the brain were only required in subjects with known brain 
metastasis. Assessments were performed every 8 weeks (± 5 days) throughout the first 
12 months on study. Upon completion of 12 months on study, these assessments were 
performed every 12 weeks (± 7 days). (Note: in order to meet the eligibility requirements 
of the study, brain metastasis must have been treated and stable for at least 3 months 
before randomization. Subjects without documented brain metastasis during the 
screening assessment were not required to undergo post-randomization brain imaging 
unless clinically indicated). 
MRI/CTs were performed per the protocol-defined schedule regardless of whether study 
treatment was reduced, held, or discontinued. For subjects who discontinued study 
treatment before radiographic PD or within 8 weeks* after radiographic PD, final 
radiographic tumour assessments were performed 8 weeks* after radiographic PD. For 
subjects who continued to receive study treatment for more than 8 weeks* after 
radiographic PD, tumour assessments were continued per the protocol-defined schedule 
until study treatment was permanently discontinued. (*12 weeks for subjects remaining 
on study treatment for more than 1 year.) 
Tumour 
assessment: 
Bone scan 
Whole body 
Technetium bone scans were performed in all subjects at screening. After randomization, 
bone scans were performed only in subjects with known bone metastasis every 16 weeks 
(± 7 days) throughout the first 12 months on study. Upon completion of 12 months on 
study, these assessments were performed every 24 weeks (± 14 days).  
(Note: subjects without documented bone metastasis during the screening assessment 
were not required to undergo post-randomization bone scan imaging unless clinically 
indicated).  
Bone scan evaluations ended on the date of the last CT/MRI scan. If the bone scan 
schedule did not coincide with the last CT/MRI scan, no additional bone scan was needed 
after the last CT/MRI was performed.

For the purpose of determination of the study endpoints of PFS and ORR, a central IRC reviewed all available 
radiographic studies. The IRC was blinded to treatment identity and to clinical data that may lead to inadvertent 
unblinding.  
Only adequate tumour assessments (ATAs) were considered in the determination of progression and censoring 
dates. An adequate tumour assessment was defined as an evaluation performed per RECIST 1.1 that resulted in 
an overall response assessment of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), PD, or 
not applicable (NA; no target lesion identified at baseline). Unless PD was otherwise evident, partially missing 
tumour data or indeterminate lesions for a particular tumour assessment resulted in an overall response of “not 
evaluable” and the tumour assessment was not considered adequate. The recorded progression date was 
defined as the date of the tumour assessment visit at which progression was declared. 
Sample size 
The study was designed to provide adequate power for event-driven analyses of both PFS and OS. The median 
PFS and OS estimates for the everolimus arm were based on values published from the RECORD-1 study which 
compared everolimus with placebo in subjects with RCC that had progressed on prior treatment with VEGFR 
inhibitors.  
For the primary endpoint of PFS, assuming exponential PFS, proportional hazards, and a 1:1 treatment 
allocation ratio, 259 events were required to provide 90% power to detect an HR of 0.667 (5 months in the 
everolimus arm vs 7.5 months in the cabozantinib arm) using the log-rank test and a 2-sided significance level 
of 5%. Under this design, the minimum observed effect that would result in statistical significance for PFS was 
a 27.8% improvement (HR = 0.783) in PFS from 5 to 6.39 months when 259 events were observed in the first 
375 subjects randomized into the study. 
For the key secondary efficacy endpoint of OS, assuming a single interim analysis at the 33% information 
fraction (at the time of the primary analysis of PFS) and a subsequent primary analysis, 408 deaths were 
required to provide 80% power to detect a HR of 0.75 (15 months in the everolimus arm vs 20 months in the 
cabozantinib arm) using the log-rank test and a 2-sided significance level of 4%. Under this design, the 
minimum observed effect that would result in statistical significance for the primary analysis of OS was a 22.5% 
improvement (HR=0.816) in OS from 15 to 18.38 months. 
Using an average accrual rate of 32 subjects per month and a 1:1 treatment allocation ratio, a total of 650 
subjects (325 per treatment arm) were required to observe the required number of events within the planned 
study duration (21 months accrual; approximately 17 months to observe the required PFS events among 375 
subjects and approximately 36 months to observe the required deaths for OS among 650 subjects). 
Randomisation 
Eligible subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the cabozantinib or everolimus treatment arm. The 
study site used an interactive voice record system (IVRS) or interactive Web record system (IWRS) for 
randomization. 
Randomization was stratified by the following factors: 
•  Number of prior VEGFR-targeting TKI therapies: 1 vs 2 or more 
Number of risk factors per Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center prognostic criteria for previously 
treated patients with RCC (Motzer 2004): 0 vs 1 vs 2 or 3 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/664123/2016 
Page 54/119 
  
  
 
o  Risk factors are the following: 
o  Karnofsky performance status score < 80% 
o  Haemoglobin < 13 g/dL (< 130 g/L) for males and < 11.5 g/dL (< 115 g/L) for females 
o  Corrected calcium > upper limit of normal 
Blinding (masking) 
The pivotal study had an open-label design. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis of primary endpoint: Progression-Free Survival (PFS) 
The primary efficacy endpoint was duration of PFS in the first 375 subjects randomized (PITT population). 
Duration of PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the earlier of the following events: disease 
progression as determined by the IRC per RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause. 
PFS (months) = (earliest date of progression, death, or censoring –date of randomization+ 1)/30.4375 
It was estimated that 375 subjects would be adequate to evaluate the primary endpoint of PFS alone. However, 
a much larger sample size would be needed to provide reasonable power for OS. As a result, the number of 
events necessary to trigger the primary analysis of PFS may occur before the study was fully accrued and the 
PFS events may be biased toward patients who progressed early. Thus, to allow longer, more robust PFS follow 
up among a fewer number of subjects, the primary analysis of PFS would be conducted after at least 259 PFS 
events had been observed among the first 375 randomized patients and the enrolment of 650 subjects had been 
completed. Only the first 375 subjects randomized would be included in the population for the primary PFS 
analysis (PITT population).  
Hypothesis testing between the two treatment arms was performed using the stratified log-rank test with a 
2-sided 0.05 level of significance. The stratification factors were those used to stratify the randomization. 
The median duration of PFS and the associated 95% confidence interval for each treatment arm was estimated 
using the Kaplan-Meier method. The hazard ratio (HR) was estimated using a Cox regression model and included 
the same stratification factors described above.  
Determination of a HR of < 1 and a statistically significant p-value for the stratified log-rank test would result in 
rejection of the null hypothesis of no difference in PFS and inference that PFS was superior in the group receiving 
cabozantinib compared with the group receiving everolimus. 
Censoring 
•  Subjects who received subsequent anticancer therapy (including radiation other than to bone) before 
experiencing an event were right censored at the date of the last adequate tumour assessment on or 
prior to the date of initiation of subsequent treatment. 
•  Subjects who received tumour resection surgery post-randomization before experiencing an event were 
right censored at the date of the last adequate tumour assessment on or prior to the date of the surgery. 
•  Subjects who had not experienced an event (and were not otherwise censored) at the time of data cutoff 
were right censored on the date of their last adequate tumour assessment.

•  Subjects who missed two or more consecutive scheduled tumour assessments immediately followed by 
an event were right censored on the date of their most recent ATA prior to the missing/inadequate 
assessments. 
o 
If the two or more consecutive missing adequate assessments were immediately followed by an 
adequate assessment with an overall response assignment of SD, PR, or CR, this was deemed 
sufficient clinical evidence that progression did not occur during the period of missing data and 
the missing evaluations were ignored. 
Sensitivity analyses 
To demonstrate robustness of the primary analysis, supportive (sensitivity) analyses of duration of PFS used the 
following alternative definitions of progression events and censoring schemes: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To correct for potential ascertainment bias in follow-up schedules between the two treatment arms, an 
analysis designated PFS2 in the SAP defined the date of radiographic progression (as determined by IRC) 
as the scheduled tumour assessment date. 
To evaluate PFS based upon investigator claims, an analysis designated PFS3 included death and the 
following as progression events: investigator assessment of radiographic progression, clinical 
deterioration, initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy and surgery that impacted tumour lesions. 
To evaluate PFS based upon investigator assessment of radiographic progression, an analysis 
designated PFS4 included deaths and progression events based on the investigator (rather than IRC) 
assessment of radiographic progression. Clinical deterioration determined by the investigator was not 
considered to be a progression event. 
To explore the effect of potentially informative censoring, four sensitivity analyses, designated 
PFS11-14 in the SAP, were conducted by reclassifying subjects censored for potentially informative 
reasons as events differentially between the treatment arms in various patterns. In the most 
conservative of these analyses, PFS14, all subjects with potentially informative censoring were counted 
as events in the cabozantinib arm and remained censored in the everolimus arm. 
• 
The primary analysis (PFS1) was repeated in the ITT population. 
Testing of key secondary endpoints 
Formal hypothesis testing was planned for key secondary efficacy endpoints (duration of OS and ORR). 
Overall survival (OS) 
Duration of OS = (Date of death or censoring – date of randomization) + 1 
For subjects who were alive at the time of data cut-off or were permanently lost to follow-up, duration of OS was 
right censored at the earlier of the data cut-off date or the date the subject was last known to be alive. 
Formal hypothesis testing of OS was performed using the stratified log-rank test with the same stratification 
factors as for PFS analyses using the entire ITT population and was repeated for the PITT population. The 
stratification factors were the same used to stratify the randomization. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/664123/2016 
Page 56/119 
  
  
 
The median duration of OS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The HR was estimated using a Cox 
regression model with treatment arm as the only main effect and stratifying by the same stratification factors as 
were used for the log-rank test. 
A prespecified single interim analysis for the key secondary efficacy endpoint of OS was conducted at the time 
of the primary analysis of PFS. The information fraction was 49% for OS (202 deaths were observed out of 408 
required for the final OS evaluation). Type I error for the interim analysis was controlled by a Lan-DeMets 
O’Brien-Fleming alpha spending function to account for the actual information fraction at the time of the interim 
analysis (critical value 0.0019). 
Objective response rate (ORR) 
The ORR was defined as the proportion of subjects who have measurable disease at baseline for whom the best 
overall response (BOR) at the time of data cut-off was complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as 
assessed by the IRC per RECIST 1.1, which was confirmed by a subsequent visit ≥ 28 days later. Only time 
points prior to the date of censoring triggers defined in the corresponding PFS analysis were considered for BOR 
analyses. The primary analysis of ORR used the ITT population. The ORR was also calculated for the PITT 
population. Subjects who did not have any post-baseline tumour assessments were counted as non-responders. 
Hypothesis testing was performed using the 2-sided chi-squared test at the 0.01 α level. 
Point estimates of ORR, the difference in response rates between the two treatment arms, and associated 
confidence intervals were provided. Confidence intervals were calculated using exact methods. 
Interim analyses 
A prespecified single interim analysis for the key secondary efficacy endpoint of OS was conducted at the time 
of the primary analysis of PFS. The information fraction was 49% for OS (202 deaths were observed out of 408 
required for the final OS evaluation). Type I error for the interim analysis was controlled by a Lan-DeMets 
O’Brien-Fleming alpha spending function to account for the actual information fraction at the time of the interim 
analysis (critical value 0.0019). The protocol does not include criteria for early stopping for futility. Testing 
between the two treatment arms was performed by the stratified log-rank test with the same stratification 
factors as for PFS analyses. The median duration of OS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The 
stratified HR was estimated using a Cox regression model with treatment arm as the main effect and the above 
stratification factors. 
By 31 December 2015 a second, unplanned interim analysis was conducted. The information fraction was 78% 
(320 deaths) and minimum 13 months follow-up. Survival status was determined for the majority (97.6%) of 
the 658 randomized subjects. The study was designed to test OS at the 2-sided 4% alpha level. The Lan-DeMets 
O’Brien-Fleming alpha spending function specified in the SAP that was applied to control Type 1 error at the prior 
planned interim analysis was also applied at this current unplanned analysis. The critical value for rejecting the 
null hypothesis at the current analysis was p<0.0163.  
Handling of multiplicity 
The multiplicity issue resulting from analysis of one primary endpoint (PFS), two key secondary efficacy 
endpoints (ORR and OS), and performing one interim analysis (of OS) was addressed by employing a 
fixed-sequence testing procedure, applying a modified Bonferroni procedure (dividing the alpha between the 
secondary endpoints), and implementing an alpha spending function.  
The primary endpoint (PFS) was tested using a 2-sided 5% significance level. If this was positive the two 
secondary endpoints could be looked at. OS was to be tested at 2-sided 0.04 level and ORR at 2-sided 0.01. For 
CHMP assessment report

OS there was an interim analysis planned at the time of the primary PFS analysis which had a critical value of 
2-sided 0.0019. A second interim analysis (unplanned) was conducted with cut-off date 31 December 2015 to 
give a minimum of 12 months follow-up from the last subject enrolled. The primary OS analysis will be 
conducted after 408 deaths are observed in the study. The primary ORR analysis was conducted at the same 
time at the PFS analysis. 
P-values for tests of all other endpoints and subgroup analyses are considered descriptive. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 658 subjects (ITT population) were randomized to receive cabozantinib (n = 330) or everolimus (n = 
328). The participant flow is illustrated in the diagram below:

Recruitment 
A total of 658 subjects were randomized in 25 countries: 36% were enrolled in North America, 49% in Europe, 
13% in Asia Pacific (includes Australia), and 1.8% in Latin America. There were a total of 181 investigators at 
173 unique sites (including 3 sites that were satellites of other sites) in 25 countries. Countries that had 10 or 
more sites included the United States (70), Germany (18), Australia (14), Canada (14), Spain (13), United 
Kingdom (13), France (11) and Italy (10). 
The first subject was enrolled 8 August 2013. The data cut-off date for the primary analysis was 22 May 2015, 
providing a minimum follow-up of approximately 5.9 months. The study was still ongoing at the time of the 
application with data in this report up to 31 Dec 2015. 
Conduct of the study 
There was one amendment to the original protocol in addition to several country-specific amendments. 
Protocol Amendment 1.0 (17 April 2014) had the following key changes: 
•  A Maintenance Phase was added to the Treatment Period to be implemented when sufficient data had been 
collected to adequately evaluate all study endpoints 
• 
• 
The study population was limited to including approximately 10% of subjects (maximum of approximately 
65 subjects) who had previously been treated with antibodies targeting the programmed cell death immune 
receptor, PD-1, or its ligands, PD-L1/L2  
Two additional study endpoints were added: changes in bone scans and changes in serum calcium from 
baseline 
•  Clarifications on the incidence and management of QTcF interval prolongation were added 
•  Clarifications on imaging including time points of assessments were added 
The majority of subjects were enrolled on the original protocol (78% Cabozantinib arm and 76% everolimus 
arm)  
Changes to the Planned Analyses 
There were three versions of the SAP. SAP v2 was completed before analysis of the primary endpoint. SAP v3 
was completed after analysis of the primary endpoint and contains minor changes in operational conventions 
that were adopted prior to analysis of the primary endpoint and minor editorial changes. In addition, a second 
unplanned interim analysis of OS is described in SAP v3 that is to be conducted with a data cut-off of 31 
December 2015, providing a minimum of 12 months of follow-up. 
The primary endpoint was planned to include at least 259 PFS events (radiographic progression per IRC or 
death) but actually included 247 events.  
Protocol deviations 
Eligibility criteria deviations were balanced between the cabozantinib and everolimus arms: a total of 37 
subjects (11%) failed at least one eligibility criterion in each treatment arm. The most common deviations in 
inclusion criteria were not meeting required screening laboratory values within the required time periods and 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/664123/2016 
Page 59/119 
  
  
 
 
receipt of the last dose of the most recently received VEGFR-TKI more than 6 months before the date of 
randomization.  
The most common deviations in exclusion criteria were not meeting the required criteria for QTcF by either not 
performing ECGs in triplicate or by performing ECGs outside of the required time periods (no deviations of 
triplicate QTcF > 500 ms occurred) and receipt of any type of small molecule kinase inhibitor within two weeks 
before randomization.  
Important protocol deviations that did not involve eligibility criteria were also balanced between treatment 
arms. The most frequently observed category was randomization irregularities that potentially impacted 
efficacy. Deviations observed in this category included stratification errors by incorrect determination of the 
MSKCC risk group or the number of prior VEGFR-TKIs. A high incidence of protocol deviations categorized as 
‘other’ that could have potentially impacted safety or efficacy was also observed (51% in the cabozantinib arm 
and 44% in the everolimus arm for those potentially impacting safety and 29% in the cabozantinib arm and 28% 
in the everolimus arm for those potentially impacting efficacy). Deviations in this category that potentially 
impacted safety included ECGs and vital signs not obtained per protocol, and revised ICF not signed by subject 
either in a timely manner or not at all (all subjects signed an ICF). Deviations in this category that potentially 
impacted efficacy included tumour imaging not obtained per protocol and subject HRQOL questionnaires not 
completed per protocol. A review of these deviations suggested that they did not have a notable impact on the 
safety or efficacy of the study.

First planned Interim Analysis - 22nd May 2015 
The interim analysis demonstrated a trend in improvement in duration of OS for subjects in the cabozantinib 
arm compared to everolimus. The HR, adjusted for stratification factors was 0.68 (95% CI: 0.51, 
0.90; stratified log-rank p-value = 0.006). The OS results nearly meet the criteria required to reject the null 
hypothesis at the interim analysis; the critical p-value was ≤ 0.0019 (HR ≤ 0.645).  Results for the unstratified 
ITT analysis were similar to those of the stratified test.

Nonprotocol Anticancer Therapy (NPACT; ITT Population) 
Any nonprotocol NPACT was not to be initiated until after study treatment had been discontinued. Local 
anticancer treatment including palliative radiation, ablation, embolization, or surgery with impact on tumor 
lesions was not permitted (unless Sponsor-approved if unavoidable) until radiographic tumor assessments had 
been discontinued per protocol defined criteria. 
More subjects in the everolimus arm than the cabozantinib arm received NPACT (Table 29).

Objective Response Rate per Investigator 
The ORR per Investigator for the ITT population was 24% (95% CI: 19, 29) cabozantinib and 4% (95% CI: 2, 
7) everolimus (unstratified p-value < 0.001). 
Additional endpoints 
Duration of response (DOR): IRC-determined. 
The Kaplan-Meier estimate of median duration of objective response per IRC among responders was not 
estimable (NE) in the cabozantinib arm (95% CI: 7.2 months, NE) and was 7.4 months (95% CI: 1.9 months, 
NE) in the everolimus arm. 
Time to Response 
The median (range) time to objective response per IRC was 1.91 (1.6, 11.0) months in the cabozantinib arm and 
2.14 (1.9, 9.2) months in the everolimus arm. This was approximately the time of the first scheduled tumour 
assessment. 
Changes in bone scans: IRC-determined 
Bone scan response, as determined by the IRC was assessed in subjects who had baseline bone scans showing 
bone lesions (105 subjects [32%] in the cabozantinib arm and 73 subjects [22%] in the everolimus arm). A 
trend for improved BSR with cabozantinib treatment was observed: Bone scan response was 18% (95% CI: 11, 
27) in the cabozantinib arm and 10% (95% CI: 4, 19) in the everolimus arm.

SRE, skeletal-related event. 
Treatment-emergent SREs recorded from the adverse event case report form page; categories are not mutually exclusive. 
For the determination of subject incidence, only the first event per subject is counted. 
Percentages are based on (A) the total number of subjects or number of subjects or (B) the number of subjects who had 
an SRE prior to randomization. 
The use of concomitant bisphosphonates (cabozantinib 38 [11%], everolimus 36 [11%]) or denosumab (18 
[5.4%], 21 [6.5%]) was similarly low in each treatment arm. 
Health-Related Quality of Life 
Two HRQoL instruments were used the FKSI-19 and the EQ-5D-5L. For both, assessments were performed 
pre-dose on Day 1, every 4 weeks through W25D1, and every 8 weeks thereafter.  
FKSI-19 
The FKSI-19 instrument is a 19-item self-report questionnaire that assesses the most important disease-related 
symptoms (DRS), treatment side-effects (TSE) and function/well-being (F/WB) associated with advanced 
kidney cancer. It queries symptom severity and interference in activity, and general health perceptions.  
The median FKSI-19 total score at baseline was 77/95 for the cabozantinib arm and 77/95 for the everolimus 
arm. The number of FKSI questionnaires completed dropped to approximately 50% of the original number of 
subjects by Week 20 in the everolimus arm and Week 32 in the cabozantinib arm.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/664123/2016 
Page 73/119 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, there were no major differences between treatment arms in the FKSI-total and subscale scores over 
time, although the FKSI-Treatment Side Effects subscale was higher (better) for the everolimus arm. The only 
specific side effects evaluated for this subscale were nausea and diarrhoea, both of which had a higher incidence 
in the cabozantinib arm. No notable treatment difference over time was observed in the 
FKSI-Function/Well-Being subscale score - measures subjects’ self-assessment of their ability to work, enjoy 
life, and their overall contentment. 
Health-related quality of life showed no clinically significant treatment differences in the FKSI-Total score, 
although some individual measures favoured cabozantinib and some favoured everolimus, probably reflecting 
the safety profiles. The biggest treatment difference was a worse score for cabozantinib for diarrhoea.

EQ-5D-5L 
EQ-5D-5L scores are summarized by five functional and symptom dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual 
activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) . 
At baseline, the median index value was 0.8200 in the cabozantinib arm and 0.8270 in the everolimus arm. The 
index questionnaire completion rate dropped to approximately 50% of the original number of subjects by Week 
16 in the everolimus arm and Week 32 in the cabozantinib arm. Index scores over time generally showed no 
treatment difference.

Healthcare Resource Utilization 
There was a slight trend in the cabozantinib arm for lower rates of hospitalization (37% vs 40% of subjects; 6.41 
vs 10.24 days per person-year) and for lower rates of ICU visits (1.2% vs 2.1% of subjects; 0.07 vs 0.32 days 
per person-year). The proportion of subjects with surgery was similar in each arm (32% cabozantinib, 31% 
everolimus), but the rate of surgery was lower in the cabozantinib arm (0.90 vs 1.35 surgeries per person-year) 
Red Blood Cell (RBC) Transfusions 
RBC transfusions in the 28 days prior to randomization were required in 4.2% of subjects in the cabozantinib 
arm and 7.1% of subjects in the everolimus arm. Only 11% of subjects in the cabozantinib arm required an RBC 
transfusion after randomization compared with 26% of subjects in the everolimus arm; a favourable effect was 
seen regardless of whether subjects had or had not received a prior RBC transfusion in the 28 days prior to 
randomization.

HR 0.61 (95% CI 0.48, 0.77) 
To explore the effect of potentially informative censoring resulting from (a) discontinuation of radiographic 
assessments prior to progression/receipt of subsequent treatments or (b) progression by investigator prior to 
receipt of subsequent treatments or (c) receipt of subsequent treatments prior to progression, four sensitivity 
analyses, designated PFS11-14, were conducted. Subsequent treatments included non-protocol systemic 
anticancer therapy, radiation other than to bone and surgical resection of the tumour lesions. These analyses 
reclassified subjects censored for the above reasons as events differentially between the treatment arms as 
follows: 
• 
only: 
In PFS11 subjects with criteria (a) and (b) were classified as events in the cabozantinib arm 
o 
HR 0.73 (95% CI 0.57, 0.92) 
In PFS12, subjects in the cabozantinib arm meeting criteria (a), (b), and (c) and those in the 
• 
everolimus arm satisfying criteria (c) were classified as events: 
o 
HR 0.70 (95% CI 0.56, 0.89) 
In PFS13, subjects in the cabozantinib arm meeting criteria (a) and (b) and those in the 
• 
everolimus arm satisfying criteria (b) were classified as events: 
o 
HR 0.58 (95% CI 0.46, 0.73) 
In PFS14, all subjects meeting criteria (a), (b), and (c) were counted as events in the 
• 
cabozantinib arm and remained censored in the everolimus arm. This was the most conservative 
analysis: 
o  HR 0.75 (95% CI 0.59, 0.95)

Table 34 -Concordance between IRC and Investigator Read in Date of Progressive Disease for Tumour 
Assessments among Subjects Who Progressed (PITT Population) 
Overall, the IRC and investigator agreed on subjects’ radiographic PD status 83% of the time for the 
cabozantinib arm and 77% of the time for the everolimus arm, and when both the IRC and investigator agreed 
PD had occurred, the IRC and investigator agreed on the dates of PD 42% of the time for the cabozantinib arm 
and 52% of the time for the everolimus arm. 
Progression-Free Survival (IRC-Determined, ITT Population)  
The HR adjusted for stratification factors was 0.52 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.64). The Kaplan-Meier estimates for median 
duration of PFS were 7.4 months in the cabozantinib arm vs 3.9 months in the everolimus arm, an estimated 3.5 
month difference in the medians.

Clinical studies in special populations 
Results from two independent population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) analyses of cabozantinib in subjects with 
RCC or MTC (Study XL184-308.PopPK.001 and XL184-301.Pop.PK.001, respectively) concluded that age was 
not a statistically significant covariate for CL/F.  Scatter plots from the RCC PopPK analysis do not indicate that 
variability around mean clearance values changes perceptibly for subject population ages of < 64 years relative 
to ≥ 65 years.

A total of 124 elderly subjects (≥ 65 years age range: 65-74 [n=96]; 75-84 [n=27]; ≥ 85 [n=1]) were included 
in the 381 pooled subjects included in the RCC PopPK analysis. The mean (SD) age was 57.6 (13.2) years (range 
19-86). Thus, the elderly population constituted a high percentage of total subjects evaluated for possible 
effects of age on cabozantinib clearance in this PopPK analysis. Moreover, for the two covariates that were 
shown to have a statistically significant effect on CL/F in this PopPK analysis (female gender and Asian race), the 
magnitude of their effect on CL/F (21% and 27% lower clearance compared to males and White subjects, 
respectively) was less than the inter-subject variability (%CV) for CL/F in this analysis (46%). Thus, even the 
two statistically significant covariates identified in this analysis were not considered to be clinically meaningful 
covariates requiring dose adjustments.    
As only sparse steady-state PK sampling was performed in pivotal RCC study XL184-308, the effect of age on 
cabozantinib exposure (clearance) was further examined in subjects enrolled in the pivotal MTC study 
XL184-301 where detailed PK sampling was conducted. 
Of the 289 pooled subjects included in the MTC PopPK analysis a total of 75 were elderly subjects (≥ 65 years 
age range: 65-74 [n=62]; 75-84 [n=12]; ≥ 85 [n=1]). The mean (SD) age was 54 (13) years; range 20-86. As 
observed in the RCC PopPK analysis, the elderly population also constituted a high percentage of total subjects 
in the MTC PopPK analysis and age was also not determined to be a statistically significant covariate affecting 
cabozantinib clearance.   
Exposure values (AUC 0-6) were determined in 39 subjects ≥ 65 years of age in the Phase 3 study of 
cabozantinib in subjects with MTC (Study XL184-301.PK.001). Based on the limited dataset, there were no 
apparent differences in mean AUC0-6 values measured on Day 1 of dosing in elderly subjects (cohorts: ≥ 65 
years; 66-74 years, 75-84 years,  ≥ 85 years) administered a single 140 mg FBE cabozantinib dose relative to 
that in the entire PK Safety population (n=200; age range: 20-86) (Table ).

For the clinical pharmacology and PK studies of cabozantinib conducted in healthy subjects, PK data are 
generally unavailable for elderly subjects based on age-related protocol enrollment criteria (ie, no subjects ≥ 65 
years). One exception is the matched normal organ function cohort (n=12) in the hepatic impairment study 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/664123/2016 
Page 86/119 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Study XL184-003), where 5 subjects ≥ 65 years of age were enrolled (individual ages: 66, 66, 67, 68 and 72 
years). However, due to the exposure variability and small sample size, no difference in mean (SD) exposure 
(AUC0-inf) was apparent in this elderly cohort administered a single 60 mg cabozantinib FBE dose when 
compared to the 7 normal organ function subjects <65 years of age: 39,720 (7,180) ng.h/mL vs 28,257 (8087) 
ng.h/mL.   
No dose adjustment is recommended for Cabometyx in mild or moderate renal impaired subjects based on the 
smaller magnitude increase in exposure observed in these subject populations relative to the inter-subject 
variability in exposure for cabozantinib in cancer patients. In patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, 
a reduced (40 mg once daily) starting dose of Cabometyx will be recommended in order to minimize the risk of 
treatment-related AEs due to elevated cabozantinib plasma exposures in this patient population. 
Supportive studies 
The only supportive study for the indication in RCC is study XL184-008, a phase I drug interaction study. The 
study is described above. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
A single pivotal study (XL184-308) was submitted in support of this new indication in Renal Cell Carcinoma for 
cabozantinib. This was a phase III, randomized, controlled study of cabozantinib vs everolimus in subjects with 
metastatic renal cell carcinoma that has progressed after prior VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. 
No CHMP advice was sought regarding the design of the RCC pivotal study. However, 4 national agencies (MPA, 
DKMA, MEB and MHRA) broadly agreed with the approach and design of the pivotal study, including that 
everolimus was an acceptable comparator and that PFS was an acceptable primary endpoint, whilst OS should 
be considered an important secondary endpoint. The primary PFS endpoint was assessed by an IRC blinded to 
study treatment.   
Key inclusion and exclusion criteria were considered acceptable in the context of the objectives of the clinical 
study. 
It was decided by CHMP to restrict the approved indication to patients who had a prior vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy instead of the broader indication applied by the applicant, since it did not 
reflect the  population  included  in  the  pivotal  study.  According  to  the inclusion  criteria,  patients  should have 
received treatment with at least one prior VEGFR TKI.  
Everolimus is an established 2nd line treatment option for RCC which has demonstrated to confer a PFS benefit 
compared to placebo in a single pivotal study (RECORD-1). The choice of everolimus as the comparator in this 
study was considered acceptable, and in is in line with previous recommendation given in all the national 
scientific advices. 
PFS was selected as primary endpoint for this study which is consistent with other approved products for RCC. 
In line with the CHMP anti-cancer guideline in man (EMA/CHMP/205/95/Rev.4), overall survival was considered 
to be an important secondary endpoint. Although OS would have been the preferred primary endpoint, the 
chosen primary endpoint PFS, in combination with the secondary endpoint OS and ORR, is considered adequate 
in the context of the disease and treatment setting. This is also in line with the national scientific advices 
provided. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/664123/2016 
Page 87/119 
  
  
A 1:1 randomisation was considered appropriate. Stratification by important factors was carried out for prior TKI 
therapies and a number of factors as per MSKCC criteria which is endorsed by CHMP. 
Although a double-blind study would have been preferred, the practical difficulties were acknowledged regarding 
over-encapsulating everolimus. In addition, the open-label design enabled appropriate dose modifications for 
adverse events in both study arms. As the primary endpoint was PFS per IRC and OS was a key secondary 
endpoint, potential bias conferred by the open-label design is partly overcome. 
Eligibility criteria and protocol deviations were generally balanced between the cabozantinib and everolimus 
arms. No major issues were identified. 
The patients included in the study are typical of a population of subjects with advanced RCC.  
There are some small differences in baseline characteristics which could indicate that the everolimus arm 
included more patients with slightly worse prognosis than the cabozantinib arm. These differences include more 
patients in the everolimus arm with Stage IV disease, more subjects with ≥ 3 involved organs, more patients 
with less than 1 year from diagnosis to randomization, median time from progression on most recent VEGFR-TKI 
to randomisation was slightly longer, and more patients had progressed earlier than 3 months from start of most 
recent VEGFR-TKI. The applicant was requested to elaborate on the implications of the seemingly worse 
prognosis of the everolimus patients on the study outcome. It was concluded that minor baseline imbalances 
between arms in individual risk factors, even in aggregate, are highly unlikely to have influenced study 
outcomes. CHMP agreed that an OS benefit for cabozantinib treatment was observed in all analysed subgroups 
(HR < 1). 
Biomarker investigation was an exploratory endpoint in the study, including the relationship of changes in 
plasma biomarkers and CTCs with treatment outcomes. These analyses have not yet been initiated. Pilot studies 
were recently initiated to determine feasibility of the exploratory CTC analysis. These should be provided post 
approval when available. 
The statistical methods are standard for the analysis of time-to-event trials and were agreed. The approaches 
for handling multiplicity are acceptable to control the type I error at 5%. Hypothesis testing between the two 
treatment arms was performed using the stratified logrank test with a 2-sided 0.05 level of significance. The 
stratification factors were those used to stratify randomization. 
In a study with a stratified randomisation the expected analysis is one that is stratified for the factors used for 
stratifying the randomisation; this was indeed done for the primary analysis and is agreed. As a supportive 
analysis an unstratified analysis was also supplied – as would be expected the results were consistent between 
the two and it is clear that the positive findings are robust to the precise method of analysis used. 
The primary analysis of PFS was event-based and was to be conducted after at least 259 events were observed 
in the PITT population, and the enrolment of all 650 subjects (ITT population) was completed. Type I error for 
the interim analysis was controlled by a Lan-DeMets O’Brien-Fleming alpha spending function to account for the 
actual information fraction at the time of the interim analysis (critical value 0.0019).  
Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed to further examine the robustness of the findings in this 
study. 
An Applicant's review of protocol deviations concluded that they would not have a notable impact on the safety 
or efficacy of the study. The applicant was requested to provide more details of this specific assessment. 
Important eligibility criteria deviations were balanced between the cabozantinib and everolimus arms: a total of 
37 subjects (11%) failed at least one important eligibility criterion in each treatment arm. Given the small 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/664123/2016 
Page 88/119 
  
  
number of subjects that had an important eligibility deviation and the nature of these deviations, the Applicant 
judged that these deviations could not possibly have had a notable impact on the safety outcomes of the study. 
There were only two categories with appreciable number of deviations: treatment deviation (potentially 
affecting safety) and randomization irregularity (potentially affecting efficacy). Both of these categories had a 
similar incidence in each treatment arm. Other categories had too few subjects to reasonably have been 
expected to impact safety or efficacy. Treatment deviations included dosing errors (isolated cases of missed 
doses or incorrect doses received) which did not impact safety. Randomization irregularities were stratification 
errors in IVRS/IWRS by incorrect determination of the MSKCC risk group or the number of prior VEGFR-TKIs. A 
summary of PFS and OS showed similar results using randomization stratification data entered on the CRF 
compared with using the original randomization stratification data entered in IVRS/IWRS.  
No formal dosing studies have been carried out. Based on the totality of evidence from different oncology 
indications, the exposure-response (E-R) analysis and from experience in using cabozantinib in RCC patients in 
study XL184-008 (phase I), a starting dose of 60 mg was proposed to be optimal in terms of balancing overall 
tolerability whilst maintaining clinically meaningful activity. The availability of 40 mg and 20 mg strength tablets 
allows for two levels of dose reduction for the management of adverse events as appropriate. Overall the 
scientific rationale and evidence to support the dosing strategy can be accepted. 
No major GCP issues have been highlighted with respect to the review of the clinical data. Overall the conduct 
of the study appears acceptable and in line with international standards.  
Overall, the design of the study is in line with relevant EU scientific guidelines. CHMP considered that the trial 
was well-designed, well-conducted and considered sufficient in this setting to assess the benefit risk balance for 
this marketing authorization application. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The PFS results demonstrate a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement for subjects in the 
cabozantinib arm compared to everolimus (HR= 0.58 [0.45, 0.74], p<0.0001). The HR adjusted for 
stratification factors was 0.59 (95% CI: 0.46, 0.76; stratified log-rank p-value < 0.001). The Kaplan-Meier 
estimates for median duration of PFS were 7.4 months in the cabozantinib arm vs 3.8 months in the everolimus 
arm, 3.6 month difference (median PFS in the everolimus registration study (RECORD) was 4.9 months and in 
the axitinib (AXIS) study was 6.8 months).   
The PFS HR among all enrolled subjects (ITT population) was 0.52 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.64). Sensitivity analyses 
using alternative definitions of progression were similar, demonstrating the robustness of the data. A PFS 
treatment benefit was observed across the majority of the baseline and demographic subgroups evaluated for 
the PITT and the ITT population. Of interest, MET is a cabozantinib therapeutic target and high levels of MET 
expression are seen in RCC. There is a trend for differences between high and low MET expression in terms of 
benefit for PSF and OS.  
PFS and OS results based on stratification values from the IVRS/IWRS entered at the time of randomization 
rather than stratification values entered onto the CRF, source data verified, and used in the CSR were similar for 
each method. These PFS and OS analyses based on IVRS/IWRS stratification values were incorporated in 
Section 5.1 of the Cabometyx SmPC. 
Secondary endpoints were supportive. The ORR per IRC was conducted in the ITT population at the time of the 
primary PFS analysis and showed a statistically significant benefit with cabozantinib treatment. The ORR was 
17% for subjects who received cabozantinib and 3% for subjects who received everolimus. All the responses 
were confirmed PRs. Confirmed objective tumour responses were seen in 2% of subjects in the everolimus 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/664123/2016 
Page 89/119 
  
  
(RECORD) study and the objective response rate was 19.4% in the axitinib (AXIS) study. The majority of 
subjects in the cabozantinib arm had a post-baseline reduction in tumour size (75% cabozantinib, 48% 
everolimus). At the time of the analysis, the median duration of response had not been reached for the 
cabozantinib arm. 
At the cut-off May 2015, a trend for longer survival for cabozantinib treated subjects was observed, 0.68 (95% 
CI: 0.51, 0.90; stratified logrank p-value = 0.006), despite a higher number of subjects in the everolimus arm 
(47%) receiving subsequent systemic anti-cancer treatment compared to those in the cabozantinib arm (38%). 
At the data cut-off of 31st December 2015 (unplanned analysis), the HR adjusted for stratification factors was 
0.67 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.83; stratified logrank p-value = 0.0003). The Kaplan-Meier estimates of median duration 
of OS were 21.4 months in the cabozantinib arm and 16.5 months in the everolimus arm, 4.9 month difference.  
Although positive overall survival results of cabozantinib treatment has been observed in both interim analyses 
performed, the final analysis is lacking to confirm the observed improvement in OS. The final OS analysis should 
be provided post authorisation and this is reflected as an annex II post-authorisation efficacy study.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy data in previously treated advanced RCC patients show improvements in both PFS and OS. The 
magnitude of the effects is considered to be clinically meaningful and cabozantinib offers a new therapeutic 
option for these patients. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
In order to address the uncertainty regarding the survival advantage of cabozantinib compared with everolimus 
in patients with advanced renal cancer that has progressed after VEGF TKI therapy, the MAH should submit the 
final analysis of OS for XL184-308, a phase 3, randomized, controlled study of cabozantinib (XL184) vs 
everolimus in subjects with metastatic renal cell carcinoma that has progressed after prior VEGFR tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor therapy by September 2017. 
Biomarker investigation was an exploratory endpoint in the study, including relationship of changes in plasma 
biomarkers and CTCs with treatment outcomes. This analysis is currently not available and CHMP recommended 
that it should be provided post approval. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The study population for Study XL184-308 had diagnoses of RCC with a clear-cell component and had to have 
progressed on prior treatment with at least one VEGFR-targeting TKI. Key demographic, baseline, and disease 
characteristics and prior cancer therapy have been described in the efficacy section. 
Cut-off date for study XL184-308 was 22nd of May 2015. 
In Study XL184-308, the median duration of exposure was longer in the cabozantinib arm compared with 
everolimus (32 weeks [range 1, 89] vs 19 weeks [range 1, 82]). A total of 40% of subjects in the cabozantinib 
arm remained on treatment as of the data cut-off compared with 21% of subjects in the everolimus arm.

Dose reductions and interruptions 
A total of 59.8% of subjects in the cabozantinib arm had a dose reduction due to an AE. The median time to first 
dose reduction was 55.0 days. A second dose-level reduction due to an AE occurred in 19.3% of subjects. The 
median time to second dose reduction was 93.0 days. Adverse events that led to dose reduction in ≥5% of 
subjects in the cabozantinib treatment arm (Safety Population) included Diarrhoea 54 (16), palmar-plantar 
erythrodysaesthesia syndrome 38 (11), fatigue 33 (10) and hypertension 25 (7.6). 
A total of 24.2% of subjects in the everolimus arm had a dose reduction due to an AE. A second dose-level 
reduction to 2.5 mg occurred in 1.6% of subjects; the median time to first dose reduction was 60.0 days and the 
median time to second dose reduction was 93.0 days.

AE, adverse event. A small fraction of the total AEs reported could not be coded in MedDRA at the time of the database snapshot. These 
uncoded AEs included some high-grade events and clinically important events (Section 12.3.4.5); a review revealed that the uncoded 
events do not meaningfully impact the frequencies of AEs described herein. Subjects are counted only once in each category but may 
be counted in multiple categories. Includes only events within the AE observation period defined as the time from first dose date until 
the earlier of 30 days after the date of decision to discontinue study treatment, date of death, date of consent withdrawal, or the data 
cutoff date except where indicated ‘at any time.’ a The Grade 5 AE and death summary information reflects data as of the May 22, 2015 
cutoff date. b Grade 5 AEs were not necessarily reported for subject deaths due to progressive disease.

Events to Monitor 
A set of Events to Monitor (ETMs) has been defined in order to track events known to be associated with TKIs, 
VEGF pathway inhibition, and other events with potentially serious consequences. Each ETM comprises a set of 
AEs that are related pathophysiologically.  
The ETMs of diarrhoea, PPES, and hypertension include AEs that were reported in high frequency in previous 
cabozantinib studies and have been commonly observed with VEGFR-TKIs. Less frequent but potentially 
life-threatening AEs that have been reported for subjects receiving cabozantinib, and other VEGF pathway 
inhibitors, are represented by the ETMs of GI perforations, fistulas, abscesses–all, intra-abdominal and pelvic 
abscesses, hemorrhages (≥ Grade 3), arterial thrombotic events, venous and mixed/unspecified thrombotic 
events, wound complications, osteonecrosis, proteinuria, and RPLS (reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy 
syndrome). In the interest of routine surveillance, AEs associated with corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation 
are tracked in the form of the QTc Prolongation ETM.  
Incidences of ETMs for both arms of Study XL184-308 are summarized in Table 44.

GI Perforation 
The incidence of GI perforations were reported for 3 subjects [0.9%] each) in Study XL184-308. Grade 3 
events were reported for 2 subjects (0.6%) in the cabozantinib arm (GI perforation and small intestine 
perforation). Two Grade 4 AEs (peritonitis and intestinal perforation were reported for one subject in the 
everolimus arm, and a Grade 5 AE of GI perforation was reported in the everolimus arm.  
One subject in the cabozantinib arm experienced a Grade 2 AE of appendicitis perforated. The subject had 
a concurrent event of abdominal abscess (Grade 3). Both events were considered SAEs.  
Fistulas 
The fistula ETMs in the cabozantinib arm of Study XL184-308 were reported for four subjects (1.2%), and 
no events were reported in the everolimus arm. A  Grade 3 event of anal fistula was reported for one 
subject  in  the  cabozantinib  arm;  all  other  events  were  ≤ Grade 2.  In  addition,  one  subject  in  the 
cabozantinib arm experienced an uncoded Grade 2 AE of ‘fistula anus’.  
Abscess—All 
The ETMs of abscess–all Study XL184-308 were reported for7 cabozantinib-treated subjects (2.1%) and 
6 everolimus-treated subjects (1.9%). Four of these subjects in the cabozantinib arm had Grade 3 events 
of abscess (all intra-abdominal AEs, see below). The majority of the reported PTs for cabozantinib-treated 
subjects  were  also  included  in  the  intra-abdominal  and  pelvic  abscess  ETM,  and  relative  to  the 
intra-abdominal  and  pelvic  abscess  ETM,  no  further  events  of  ≥  Grade  3  were  reported  for  the 
cabozantinib arm. However, a Grade 3 event of abscess neck was reported for a subject in the everolimus 
arm, and in addition to the events summarized in the table below, one subject in the everolimus arm 
experienced an uncoded Grade 3 AE of ‘periodontal abcess’ [sic]. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/664123/2016 
Page 98/119 
  
  
 
Intra-abdominal and Pelvic Abscess 
The intra-abdominal and pelvic abscess ETMs in Study XL184-308 were reported for four subjects (1.2%) 
in the cabozantinib arm and one subject (0.3%) in the everolimus arm. Grade 3 events were reported for 
all  four  subjects  with  events  in  the  cabozantinib  arm  (2  subjects  each  [0.6%]  with  PTs  of  abdominal 
abscess and anal abscess); the perineal abscess reported in the everolimus arm was Grade 2.  
Abscess was associated with an anal fistula in the two subjects who experienced an anal abscess, and with 
an  appendicitis  perforated  in  a  subject  who  experienced  an  abdominal  abscess.  In  general, 
intra-abdominal and pelvic abscesses are linked pathophysiologically to fistulas and GI perforations. 
Hemorrhage (≥ Grade 3) 
The hemorrhage (≥ Grade 3) ETMs in Study XL184-308 were reported for 7 cabozantinib-treated subjects 
(2.1%)  and  5  everolimus-treated  subjects  [1.6%]).  In  addition,  one  subject  in  the  everolimus  arm 
experienced an uncoded Grade 3 AE of ‘stroke hemorrhagic’.  
One subject in the cabozantinib arm experienced two Grade 4 events (hemarthrosis and hemorrhagic 
anemia),  and  two  Grade  4  events  were  reported  for  two  subjects  in  the  everolimus  arm  (renal 
hemorrhage and hemoptysis). Grade 5 events were reported for two subjects in the cabozantinib arm; 
both were assessed by the investigator as not related to study treatment. 
• 
One subject died on Study Day 52, 12 days after the last dose of cabozantinib. The subject died 
from  post-procedural  hemorrhage  following  treatment  of  an  AE  of  Grade  3  peripheral  ischemia  with 
thrombectomy  of  the  groin  and  fasciotomy  of  the  legs;  heparin  had  been  administered  for  blood  clot 
prophylaxis. 
• 
One subject died on Study Day 364, 31 days after the last dose of cabozantinib. The subject died 
due to extradural hematoma derived from bone metastases to the skull; the event initiated as a Grade 4 
AE  on  Study  Day  362.  The  subject  had  been  discontinued  from  study  treatment  due  to  disease 
progression. Prior to the AE of extradural hematoma, the subject had been hospitalized for treatment of 
Grade 3 pneumonia. 
Arterial Thrombotic Events 
The  incidence  of  arterial  thromboses  reported  in  Study  XL184-308  included  3  cabozantinib-treated 
subjects (0.9%) and 1 everolimus subject (0.3%). All events in both treatment arms were ≤ Grade 3. 
Both Grade 3 events for subjects in the cabozantinib arm were reported as SAEs (carotid artery occlusion; 
and carotid artery thrombosis). 
Venous and mixed/unspecified thrombotic events  
Table  46  summarizes the reported  ETMs  of  venous  and  mixed/unspecified  thrombosis  by  PT  in  Study 
XL184-308. 
The  incidence  of  venous  and  mixed/unspecified  thrombotic  ETMs  in  Study  XL184-308  was  7.3%  (24 
subjects)  in  the  cabozantinib  arm  and  2.5%  (8 subjects)  in  the  everolimus  arm.  The  most  frequently 
reported events of any grade in the cabozantinib arm were pulmonary embolism (12 cabozantinib-treated 
subjects [3.6%], 1 everolimus subject [0.3%]), deep vein thrombosis (DVT; 5 [1.5%], 2 [0.6%]), and 
portal vein thrombosis (2 [0.6%], 1 [0.3%]); all other events were reported in no more than one subject 
per treatment arm. 
Grade 3 or 4 venous or mixed/unspecified thrombotic events were reported for 12 subjects (3.6%) in the 
cabozantinib arm and 3 subjects (0.9%) in the everolimus arm. The majority of the cabozantinib-treated 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/664123/2016 
Page 99/119 
  
  
subjects had pulmonary embolism (8 subjects [2.4%]); one of which had a Grade 4 pulmonary embolism. 
In addition to the events summarized in the table, one subject in the everolimus arm experienced an 
uncoded Grade 3 AE of ‘blood clot’.

At each level of summarization, a subject was counted once for the most severe event if the subject reported one or more events. 
a  In addition to the events summarized in the table, there were two AEs of Grade 2 embolism reported in Study XL184-308. Subject 
1563-3097 (cabozantinib arm) experienced the embolism AE on Study Day 170, and the subject also had AEs of portal vein 
thrombosis and splenic vein thrombosis. Subject 2002-3762 (everolimus arm) experienced the embolism AE on Study Day 56 and 
had no other venous thrombotic ETMs. Neither embolism event was reported as an SAE. 
b  In addition to the events summarized in the table, one subject in the everolimus arm experienced an uncoded Grade 3 AE of ‘blood 
clot’. 
Among the cabozantinib-treated subjects who experienced pulmonary embolism AEs, three reported a 
second AE defined as a venous and mixed/unspecified thrombotic ETM; one subject experienced an AE of 
subclavian vein thrombosis, and two subjects experienced deep vein thromboses (DVTs). 
Wound Complications 
The  incidence  of  wound  complications  in  Study  XL184-308  were  reported  for8 cabozantinib-treated 
subjects  (2.4%)  and  4  everolimus-treated  subjects  (1.2%).  The  most  frequent  event  of  any  grade 
reported  in  the  cabozantinib  arm  was  impaired  healing  (3 cabozantinib-treated  subjects  [0.9%], 
0 everolimus-treated subjects). The most frequent event of any grade reported in the everolimus arm 
was wound infection (1 cabozantinib subject [0.3%], 2 everolimus-treated subjects [0.6%]). All other 
events were each reported for one subject in either treatment arm. 
There  was  one  Grade  3  event  reported  for  each  treatment  arm:  impaired  healing  for  cabozantinib, 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/664123/2016 
Page 100/119 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
wound infection for everolimus.  
Wound complications for cabozantinib-treated subjects in Study XL184-308 were primarily post-surgical 
events, and all but one AE were low grade (≤ Grade 2). The Grade 3 AE (impaired healing) occurred in 
the context of PPES; the event was non-serious and resolved within 2 weeks of onset. 
Hypertension 
The incidence of hypertension ETMs was higher in the cabozantinib arm (128 subjects [39%]) compared 
with the everolimus arm (24 subjects [7.5%]). The most frequently reported ETM PT was hypertension 
in both treatment arms (37% cabozantinib, 7.1% everolimus). 
The  incidence  of  Grade  3  hypertension  ETMs  was  also  higher  in  the  cabozantinib  arm  (52 subjects 
[16%]) compared with the everolimus arm (10 subjects [3.1%]).  
Two cabozantinib-treated subjects had AEs reported by the investigator as hypertensive crisis (note: the 
data  presented  do  not  meet  the  definition  for  hypertensive  crisis  for  either  subject).  No 
cabozantinib-treated  subjects  had  documented  evidence  of  malignant  hypertension,  hypertensive 
urgency, or hypertensive emergency. 
Osteonecrosis 
The  incidence  of  osteonecrosis  ETMs  in  Study  XL184-308  were  reported  for2 cabozantinib-treated 
subjects  (0.6%)  and  2  everolimus-treated  subjects  (0.6%).  Events  were  reported  for  only  one  PT, 
osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). Grade 3 events were reported for one cabozantinib subject (0.3%) and 
two everolimus-treated subjects (0.6%). At baseline, the cabozantinib subject with the Grade 3 AE of 
ONJ had an ongoing AE of Grade 2 ONJ assessed as related to prior therapy. This subject also received 
concomitant denosumab on study. The cabozantinib subject who experienced the Grade 2 AE also had a 
prior history of ONJ which resolved before enrolling in Study XL184-308.  
In  addition,  one  subject  in  the  everolimus  arm  experienced  an  uncoded  Grade  2  AE  of  ‘medication 
related osteonecrosis of the jaw’.  
The use of concomitant bisphosphonates (11% cabozantinib, 11% everolimus) and denosumab (5.4%, 
6.5%) was similarly low in either treatment arm. Tooth abscess occurred in one cabozantinib subject and 
two everolimus-treated subjects.  
Palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (PPES) 
The incidence of events of PPES was high in the cabozantinib arm (139 subjects [42%]); 19 subjects 
(5.9%)  had  PPES  in  the  everolimus  arm.  No  events  of  PPES  > Grade  3  were  reported  for  either 
treatment arm. 
Proteinuria 
Proteinuria is an expected event in this subject population due the high rate of prior nephrectomy and 
the requirement for prior VEGFR-TKI therapy. The incidence of proteinuria events in the cabozantinib 
arm  was  12%  (41  subjects)  and  was  9.3%  (30  subjects)  in  the  everolimus  arm.  There  were  no 
proteinuria events reported in either arm with severity > Grade 3. Kidney toxicity has been reproted 
some  animal  models  (see  pre-clinical  AR).  Caution  should  be  taken  in  patients  with  severe  renal 
impairment as described in the SmPC.  
RPLS 
Events of RPLS have been reported for subjects treated with cabozantinib in non-RCC studies, but no 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/664123/2016 
Page 101/119 
  
  
such events were reported for either arm of Study XL184-308. 
Diarrhoea  
The  incidence  of  diarrhea  events  was  74%  (245  subjects)  in  the  cabozantinib  arm  and  28% 
(89 subjects) in the everolimus arm; diarrhea was the most frequently reported AE for subjects in the 
cabozantinib arm. No diarrhea events of severity > Grade 3 were reported on either treatment arm of 
Study XL184-308. Diarrhea was reported as an SAE in 2.1% of cabozantinib-treated subjects.  
While dose modifications (ie, reductions and interruptions) due to AEs of diarrhea were frequent (26%) 
for  cabozantinib-treated  subjects  in  Study  XL184-308,  there  was  a  low  rate  (0.9%)  of 
cabozantinib-treated subjects who discontinued study treatment due to diarrhea. 
QTc Prolongation 
The incidence of events of QTc prolongation was low for both treatment arms (one subject each).  
•  Subject (4929-3536) in the cabozantinib arm had a Grade 2 nonserious AE of ECG QT prolonged on 
Study Day 59. The subject was receiving cabozantinib at a dose of 60 mg qd at the time of the onset 
of the AE, and no modifications in study treatment were implemented as a result of the event. No 
QTc correction by the Fridericia’s formula (QTcF) >500 ms was reported for this subject, and the 
absolute increase in QTcF from baseline for this subject was unknown. 
•  Subject (7006-3190) in the everolimus arm had a Grade 3 non-serious AE of ECG QT prolonged on 
Study Day 57. The subject was receiving everolimus at a dose of 10 mg qd at the time of the onset 
of the AE, and no modifications in study treatment were implemented as a result of the event. The 
subject had one single ECG read with a QTcF > 500 ms assessed by the investigator, but the findings 
were not confirmed by independent ECG review.

Deaths - up to 22nd May 2015 
A total of 200 deaths were reported in the safety population as of the cutoff date of 22nd May 2015, which 
included 90 subjects (27%) in the cabozantinib arm and 110 subjects (34%) in the everolimus arm. 38 deaths 
occurred through 30 days of the last dose: 15 (4.5%) in the cabozantinib arm and 23 (7.1%) in the everolimus 
arm; deaths were attributed to progressive disease (8 subjects [2.4%] cabozantinib, 11 [3.4%] everolimus).  
A total of 162 deaths occurred more than 30 days after last dose of study drug: 75 (23%) in the cabozantinib 
arm and 87 (27%) in the everolimus arm. Most of these deaths were due to progressive disease (145 out of 
162), with more PD deaths occurring in the everolimus arm (65/331 subjects [20%] cabozantinib, 80/322 
[25%] everolimus).

With a cutoff date of 31st December 2015, there were 320 total deaths, representing 78% (320/408) of the total 
deaths required for the planned final analysis of OS, 137 in the cabozantinib arm and 170 in the everolimus arm. 
Laboratory findings 
Serum chemistry parameters that most frequently (≥5%) showed a shift in the cabozantinib arm from < Grade 
3 at baseline to ≥ Grade 3 post-baseline were sodium decreased (28/331 [8.5%]), phosphate decreased 
(27/331 [8.2%]), and LDH increased (21/331 [6.3%]). Serum chemistry parameters that most frequently (≥ 
5%) showed a shift in the everolimus arm from < Grade 3 at baseline to ≥ Grade 3 post-baseline were 
triglycerides increased (39/322 [12%]), gammaglutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) increased (28/322[8.7%]), and

glucose increased (26/322 [8.1%]), sodium decreased (18/322 [5.6%]), and phosphate decreased (16/322 
[5.0%]). 
The most frequent (≥40%) treatment-emergent serum chemistry laboratory abnormalities of any grade 
reported in the cabozantinib arm by decreasing frequency were AST increased, ALT increased, creatinine 
increased, triglycerides increased, and phosphate decreased. Most of the treatment-emergent chemistry 
abnormalities were of Grade 1 or 2 severity in both treatment arms.  
Increases in liver transaminases (ALT, AST) were frequent in both arms but there was a low incidence of severe 
abnormalities. There were no cases that met Hy’s Law criteria (concurrent ALT or AST >3 x ULN, total bilirubin 
>2 x ULN, and ALP <2 x ULN). 
The only hematology abnormality (Grade 3 or 4) that had a ≥ 5% incidence in the Study XL184-308 
cabozantinib arm was decreased lymphocytes. In the everolimus arm, Grade 3 or 4 abnormalities that had a ≥ 
5% incidence were decreases in hemoglobin and lymphocytes.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Drug-drug interaction studies have been carried out in vitro and in the clinic. Knowledge to date is adequately 
reflected in the SmPC. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The incidence of AEs that led to discontinuation of study drug was similar between treatment arms (10% 
cabozantinib, 9.6% everolimus). The most frequent AEs leading to discontinuation of cabozantinib (≥ 1% 
incidence) were decreased appetite (1.8%) and fatigue (1.2%). 
Post marketing experience 
Cabozantinib capsules (Cometriq) were first approved by the FDA on 29 November 2012 for the treatment of 
patients with progressive, metastatic MTC at a dose of 140 mg qd. Cometriq was made commercially available 
in the United States on 24 January 2013. On 21 March 2014, cabozantinib capsules (Cometriq) at the 140-mg

dose received approval through the centralized procedure by the European Commission for the treatment of 
adults with progressive, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic MTC. 
The post-marketing patient population through 22 May 2015 comprised 1149 total patients exposed including 
approximately  1083  in  the  US,  42  in  the  EU  (marketed  and  named  patient  use  [NPU]),  and  24  from  other 
countries (NPU).  
Through 22 May 2015, patients in the US marketed setting have received cabozantinib for treatment of thyroid 
cancer (n=453) as well as malignancies other than the approved indication, including prostate cancer (n=184), 
renal cancer (n=183), hepatocellular cancer (n=19), and lung cancer (n=61). In the EU, patients have thus far 
received marketed drug for MTC (n=11), pheochromocytoma (n=1), and HCC (n=1). Cumulatively, 587 serious 
adverse reactions (SARs) have been reported in the post-marketing setting through 22 May 2015.  
Through 22 May 2015, 75 post-marketing SARs for 49 cases were received in subjects who received Cometriq 
off-label for the indication of renal cancer (including RCC and malignant neoplasm of the renal pelvis). With the 
exception  of  unknown  cause  of  death  (death  [n=11]),  pneumonia  (n=4),  dehydration  (n=3),  rectal 
haemorrhage (n=3), hypertension (n=2), hypotension (n=2), vomiting (n=2), and pain in extremity (n=2), the 
occurrence of any individual SAR was limited to one event.  
After the 22 May 2015 cut-off, one unconfirmed case of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES; 
also called RPLS) was reported by a non-study physician via the post-marketing process for a subject who was 
enrolled in Study XL184-308. The report was not contemporaneous with the event (made >1 year afterwards) 
and there was inconsistent information in the report regarding the date of the event relative to study treatment. 
The patient also had confounding factors including receipt of a prior VEGFR-TKI and radiation for brain 
metastases. There is no evidence of imaging supporting the diagnosis of RPLS, and the event was not confirmed 
by the investigator. Additional follow-up is ongoing. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety population included subjects that received at least one dose of study treatment. The size of the safety 
data package was considered sufficient for the assessment of risks in a marketing authorisation application in 
this disease setting.  
A total of 59.8% of subjects in the cabozantinib arm and 24.2% of subjects in the everolimus arm had a dose 
reduction due to an AE. Dose interruptions due to an AE occurred in 70% subjects in the cabozantinib and 59% 
of everolimus arms subjects.  
Management of suspected adverse drug reactions may require temporary interruption and/or dose reduction of 
Cabometyx therapy. Dose reductions are adequately described in the SmPC (see section 4.2). Dose 
interruptions are recommended for management of CTCAE grade 3 or greater toxicities or intolerable grade 2 
toxicities. Dose reductions are recommended for events that, if persistent, could become serious or intolerable. 
As most events can occur early in the course of treatment, the physician should evaluate the patient closely 
during the first eight weeks of treatment to determine if dose modifications are warranted. There is limited data 
in patients with cardiac impairment. No specific dosing recommendations can be made (see SmPC section 4.2) 
All subjects in the cabozantinib arm had an AE. The types of adverse events reported are generally in line with 
the known profile of cometriq (cabozantinib) and/ or TKIs.  
The overall incidence of AEs in trial XL184-308 (regardless of causality) was similar in both arms, but the safety 
profile was different as expected based on the different mechanisms of action. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/664123/2016

ETMs consist of groupings of AE preferred terms known to be associated with VEGFR-TKIs as well as AEs with 
potentially serious consequences. These ETMs comprise GI perforation, fistula, abscess–all, intra-abdominal and 
pelvic abscess, hemorrhage (≥ Grade 3), arterial thrombotic event, venous and mixed/unspecified thrombotic 
event, wound complication, hypertension, osteonecrosis, PPES, proteinuria, RPLS, diarrhea, and QTc 
prolongation.  
The most frequent ETMs occurring on cabozantinib treatment were diarrhea (74%), PPES (42%) and 
hypertension (39%), proteinuria (12%) and median time to the first occurrence of these ETMs were also the 
shortest ones: hypertension (3.0 weeks), PPES (3.4 weeks), proteinuria (4.1 weeks), and diarrhea (4.9 weeks).  
The median time to first occurrence of ETMs of GI perforations, arterial/venous/mixed/unspecified  thrombotic 
events and wound complications was at least 10 weeks, for abcesses, fistulas and ≥ Grade 3 hemorrhages, 
median time to first occurrence was at least 20 weeks.  
The ETMs of thromboembolic events, haemorrhage, wound complications, hypertension, PPES, proteinuria, 
RPLS, fistulas, GI perforations and QT prolongation are adequately described in warning/precaution texts in the 
section 4.4. of the SmPC. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
No new safety signals were observed for cabozantinib. The safety profile of cabozantinib appears similar to other 
VEGFR-TKIs used to treat RCC. Overall, the safety profile of cabozantinib in RCC appears manageable and no 
major safety concerns were raised.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the basis of a 
bridging report making reference to Cometriq. The bridging report submitted by the applicant has been found 
acceptable. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, CABOMETYX (cabozantinib) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in 
any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The applicant initially claimed the following indication:  
CABOMETYX (cabozantinib) is indicated for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in patients 
who have received one prior therapy. 
The current agreed indication is: 
CABOMETYX  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  advanced  renal  cell  carcinoma  (RCC)  in  adults  following  prior 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy 
Renal  cell  carcinoma  is  the  third  leading  urologic  cancer.  About  30%  of  patients  with  RCC  have  metastatic 
disease  at the  time of  diagnosis,  and  a  significant  proportion  of  patients  with localized  disease  treated with 
curative nephrectomy relapse subsequently with metastatic disease. Metastatic RCC is associated with a high 
quality-of-life burden. About 8% to 22.5% of mRCC patients survive for five years or more as compared to 90% 
of patients with localized renal cancer, but survival rates increase with the use of new therapies and depend on 
several  prognostic  factors.  Patient  population  is  heterogeneous  in  terms  of  clinical  (prognostic  factors)  and 
molecular determinants. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/664123/2016 
Page 112/119 
  
  
The incidence of mRCC is increasing, and the disease is still considered incurable. The most frequent locations 
of metastases are the lungs, mediastinum, bone, liver, and brain. 
In patients with advanced RCC, the aim of therapy is to prolong PFS, to achieve high response rate, to prolong 
survival and to improve quality of life. In second line setting only few agents could demonstrate benefit in terms 
of OS (e.g. nivolumab) and most of therapies approved in second line could show PFS benefit in randomised 
phase 3 trials, although with different magnitude of effect (median PFS ranging from 4 to 7 months). 
The aim of therapy with cabozantinib is to delay progression and to prolong survival. The pivotal study 
supporting the application for cabozantinib was designed to provide adequate power for evaluation of both the 
primary endpoint PFS, and the key secondary endpoint, OS. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The current standard of care for advanced RCC patients whose disease has progressed on or who are resistant 
to VEGFR-TKI therapy is treatment with everolimus or axitinib. Sorafenib is also recommended in this setting 
based on a study in patients who had progressed on a prior systemic (mainly cytokine-based) therapy. However, 
none of these agents has demonstrated a survival benefit in the second-line setting. Everolimus is the most 
frequently used second-line therapy following a VEGFR-TKI in patients with RCC. CHMP has recently adopted a 
positive opinion for nivolumab in the second-line treatment of RCC, based on data showing statistically 
significant improvement in overall survival compared to everolimus. Despite the encouraging results for 
nivolumab, 75% of the patients do not show response to the treatment. 
The vast majority of patients with advanced RCC will experience disease progression due to acquired or a priori 
resistance to VEGFR- or mTOR-targeted therapy. The extent and location of tumour metastases in patients with 
advanced RCC contribute to significant morbidity. Metastatic symptoms include airway obstruction, venous 
thromboembolism, bone pain, skeletal related events (SREs), and hypercalcemia. In addition, paraneoplastic 
syndromes (hypertension and disorders of the endocrine, hepatic, and neuromuscular system impact quality of 
life of patients with advanced RCC (Cella. The Oncologist 2011;16(suppl 2):23–31). The median overall survival 
for patients with advanced RCC ranges from about 8 months (poor risk score) to 4 years (favourable risk score). 
Therefore, an unmet need remains for treatments that will prolong time to progression and improve survival. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main study is of acceptable design. The pivotal study is XL184-308, a phase III, randomized, controlled 
study of cabozantinib vs everolimus in subjects with metastatic renal cell carcinoma that has progressed after 
prior VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. No major GCP issues have been highlighted with respect to the 
review of the clinical data. Overall the conduct of the study appears satisfactory and in line with international 
standards. 658 subjects were randomised in study XL184-308, 330 in the cabozantinib arm and 328 in the 
everolimus arm. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary endpoint was PFS. The results demonstrate a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 
improvement in PFS for subjects in the cabozantinib arm compared to everolimus, an acceptable comparator in 
this setting. The HR adjusted for stratification factors was 0.59 (95% CI: 0.46, 0.76; stratified log-rank p-value 
< 0.001). The Kaplan-Meier estimates for median duration of PFS were 7.4 months in the cabozantinib arm vs 
3.8 months in the everolimus arm.

The PFS HR among all enrolled subjects (ITT population) was 0.52 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.64) and sensitivity analyses 
using alternative definitions of progression demonstrate robustness and consistency of the effect. A PFS 
treatment benefit was observed across the majority of the pre-specified baseline and demographic subgroups 
evaluated for the PITT (primary analysis) and the ITT population. 
PFS and OS results based on stratification values from the IVRS/IWRS entered at the time of randomization 
rather than stratification values entered onto the CRF, source data verified, and used in the CSR were similar for 
each method. These PFS and OS analyses based on IVRS/IWRS stratification values were incorporated in 
Section 5.1 of the Cabometyx SmPC.  
The ORR per IRC showed a statistically significant benefit with cabozantinib treatment. The ORR was 17% for 
subjects who received cabozantinib and 3% for subjects who received everolimus. All the responses were 
confirmed PRs. The majority of subjects in the cabozantinib arm had a post-baseline reduction in tumour size 
(75% cabozantinib, 48% everolimus).  
At the cut-off May 2015, a trend for longer survival for cabozantinib treated subjects was observed, 0.68 (95% 
CI: 0.51, 0.90; stratified logrank p-value = 0.006), despite a higher number of subjects in the everolimus arm 
(47%) receiving subsequent systemic anti-cancer treatment compared to those in the cabozantinib arm (38%).  
At the data cut-off of 31st December 2015 (unplanned analysis), the HR adjusted for stratification factors was 
0.67 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.83; stratified logrank p-value = 0.0003). The Kaplan-Meier estimates of median duration 
of OS were 21.4 months in the cabozantinib arm and 16.5 months in the everolimus arm, 4.9 month difference. 
The extreme nature of the result and the consistency of the estimate of the HR with the previous (planned) 
analysis of OS give confidence that there is an OS benefit for cabozantinib compared to everolimus. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There are some indications that the everolimus arm included more patients with slightly worse prognosis than 
the cabozantinib arm; i.e. more patients in the everolimus arm with Stage IV disease, more subjects with ≥ 3 
involved organs, more patients with less than 1 year from diagnosis to randomization, median time from 
progression on most recent VEGFR-TKI to randomisation was slightly longer, more patients had progressed 
earlier than 3 months from start of most recent VEGFR-TKI.  Thus the improvement in PFS with cabozantinib 
compared to everolimus could be somewhat overestimated. 
Although positive trends for OS of cabozantinib treatment has been observed in both interim analyses 
performed, the final analysis is lacking to confirm the observed improvement in OS. The Applicant will submit 
the final OS results by September 2017.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects  
All subjects in the cabozantinib arm had an AE. The types of adverse events reported are generally in keeping 
with the known profile of cometriq (cabozantinib) and/ or TKIs. 
The incidence of treatment-related AEs was 97% in the cabozantinib arm and 91% in the everolimus arm.  
The incidence of SAEs was 40% in the cabozantinib arm and 43% in the everolimus arm.  
Serious AEs reported for ≥1.5% of subjects in the cabozantinib arm by decreasing frequency were renal cell 
carcinoma, abdominal pain, pleural effusion, diarrhoea, nausea, anaemia, back pain, dyspnoea, fatigue, 
pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, vomiting, and pain. The overall incidence of treatment-related SAEs was 15% 
in the cabozantinib arm and 13% in the everolimus arm. Treatment-related SAEs reported for ≥1% of subjects 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/664123/2016 
Page 114/119 
  
  
in the cabozantinib arm by decreasing frequency were diarrhoea, pulmonary embolism, fatigue and 
hypomagnesaemia. 
The incidence of venous and mixed/unspecified thrombotic ETMs was clearly higher in the cabozantinib arm 
7.3% (24 subjects) compared to 2.5% (8 subjects) in the everolimus arm, of which 12/24 and 3/8 subjects, 
respectively, had event of grade 3 or 4. This difference between treatment arms were mainly driven by a higher 
incidence of pulmonary embolism in the cabozantinib arm (12 cabozantinib-treated subjects [3.6%] vs 1 
everolimus subject [0.3%]). However, also other single events of serious venous thrombosis occurred more 
often in the cabozantinib arm. As these ETMs occurred relatively late in the treatment period, the higher 
incidence could be related to the longer exposure in the cabozantinib arm. The acknowledged risk is considered 
adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
Most of the treatment-emergent serum chemistry abnormalities were of Grade 1 or 2 in severity in both 
treatment. There were no cases that met the screening criteria for Hy’s Law. 
A total of 59.8% of subjects in the cabozantinib arm and 24.2% of subjects in the everolimus arm had a dose 
reduction due to an AE. Dose interruptions due to an AE occurred in 63% subjects in the cabozantinib and 42% 
of everolimus arms subjects 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There is missing information for the following safety concerns: use in paediatric population, use in pregnant or 
lactating women, use in patients with cardiac impairment, use in patients with severe hepatic impairment, use 
in patients with severe renal impairment and carcinogenicity. However, those have been appropriately 
addressed in the RMP.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Therapeutic breakthroughs in recent years have transformed the treatment paradigm of patients in the 
advanced RCC setting. However, despite these advances, previously treated advanced RCC patients are difficult 
to treat and have a high unmet medical need. New therapeutic options are required to improve outcomes, 
particularly in terms of overall survival. In study XL184-308 the observed improvement in PFS with cabozantinib 
compared to everolimus in the pivotal study is considered of clinical importance. The median PFS for 
cabozantinib was estimated to be 3.6 months longer (HR=0.59; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.76; stratified log-rank p-value 
<0.001). This increase in PFS was followed by a trend for improved survival of 4.9 months (HR 0.67; 95% CI: 
0.53, 0.83; stratified logrank p-value = 0.0003), which is considered important for patients with RCC as they 
have a relatively poor prognosis. 
There are uncertainties regarding the observed differences in PFS and OS between treatment arms of the pivotal 
study as they may be somewhat overestimated due to differences in baseline characteristics and differences in 
next-line therapies. Still, differences in PFS and OS are of such a magnitude that there is reason to believe that 
although the effect size could be smaller, it would still be of clinical relevance. 
The safety population in RCC included subjects that received at least one dose of study treatment. The size of 
the safety data package is sufficient for the assessment of risks in a marketing authorisation application in this 
disease setting 
The safety profile appears similar to other VEGFR-TKIs used to treat RCC. Adverse events leading to 
discontinuation of cabozantinib were seen in 10% of the study population.

The overall frequency of grade 3 or 4 AEs for cabozantinib in RCC subjects was higher than observed with 
everolimus, a difference mainly due to higher incidence of hypertension, diarrhoea, and PPES. Overall, however, 
there was a similar incidence in each arm of AEs of Grade 4 and Grade 5.  
The risks of cabozantinib treatment were in most cases manageable with dose modifications, and only about 
10% in each arm permanently discontinued therapy due to AEs, which is an acceptable level. 
The appropriateness of the starting dose proposed for registration (i.e. 60 mg daily), was questioned as it seems 
rather poorly tolerated.  Exposure-response (E-R) analysis of cabozantinib in patients with RCC support the view 
that the 60 mg dose provides the best anti-tumour response. As expected, higher predicted risk of individual AEs 
were simulated for the 60 mg dose vs the 40 mg and 20 mg dose levels, although the simulated 40 mg starting 
dose was not predicted to dramatically reduce the requirement for dose reductions. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The efficacy data have been derived from a well conducted and designed phase III study in previously treated 
advanced RCC subjects. These subjects show improvements in PFS, ORR and OS. The magnitude of the effects 
is considered to be clinically meaningful and supports cabozantinib as a new therapeutic option in this condition 
with a high unmet need. 
There are no major safety concerns. Overall, the safety profile of cabozantinib in RCC appears manageable, with 
dose reductions where required. Given the efficacy and safety data submitted, the benefit-risk is considered 
positive.   
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Cabozantinib is positive provided the final OS analysis is submitted by September 2017. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Cabozantinib is not similar to Nexavar and Torisel within the 
meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Cabometyx is favourable in the following indication: 
CABOMETYX is indicated for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in adults following prior 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy

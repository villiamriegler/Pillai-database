CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
Asthma 
Revinty Ellipta is indicated for the regular treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents aged 12 years 
and older where use of a combination medicinal product (long-acting beta2-agonist and inhaled 
corticosteroid) is appropriate: 
• patients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and 'as needed' inhaled short acting 
beta2-agonists. 
• patients already adequately controlled on both inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta2-agonist. 
COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) 
Revinty Ellipta is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of adults with COPD with a FEV1<70% 
predicted normal (post-bronchodilator) with an exacerbation history despite regular bronchodilator 
therapy.  
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Asthma 
Patients with asthma should be given the strength of Revinty Ellipta containing the appropriate 
fluticasone furoate (FF) dosage for the severity of their disease. Prescribers should be aware that in 
patients with asthma, fluticasone furoate (FF) 100 micrograms once daily is approximately equivalent 
to fluticasone propionate (FP) 250 micrograms twice daily, while FF 200 micrograms once daily is 
approximately equivalent to FP 500 micrograms twice daily.

Adults and adolescents aged 12 years and over  
A starting dose of one inhalation of Revinty Ellipta 92/22 micrograms once daily should be considered 
for adults and adolescents 12 years and over who require a low to mid dose of inhaled corticosteroid in 
combination with a long-acting beta2-agonist. If patients are inadequately controlled on Revinty Ellipta 
92/22 micrograms, the dose can be increased to 184/22 micrograms, which may provide additional 
improvement in asthma control. 
Patients should be regularly reassessed by a healthcare professional so that the strength of fluticasone 
furoate/vilanterol they are receiving remains optimal and is only changed on medical advice. The dose 
should be titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control of symptoms is maintained. 
Revinty Ellipta 184/22 micrograms should be considered for adults and adolescents 12 years and over 
who require a higher dose of inhaled corticosteroid in combination with a long-acting beta2-agonist. 
Patients usually experience an improvement in lung function within 15 minutes of inhaling Revinty 
Ellipta.  
However, the patient should be informed that regular daily usage is necessary to maintain control of 
asthma symptoms and that use should be continued even when asymptomatic. 
If symptoms arise in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist should be used 
for immediate relief. 
Children aged under 12 years 
The safety and efficacy of Revinty Ellipta in children under 12 years of age have not been established 
in the indication for asthma. 
Revinty Ellipta should not be used in children under 12 years of age. Currently available data are 
described in sections 5.1 and 5.2.  
COPD 
Adults aged 18 years and over 
One inhalation of Revinty Ellipta 92/22 micrograms once daily.  
Revinty Ellipta 184/22 micrograms is not indicated for patients with COPD. There is no additional 
benefit of the 184/22 micrograms dose compared to the 92/22 micrograms dose and there is a potential 
increased risk of pneumonia and systemic corticosteroid-related adverse reactions (see sections 4.4 and 
4.8). 
Patients usually experience an improvement in lung function within 16-17 minutes of inhaling Revinty 
Ellipta. 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of Revinty Ellipta in the paediatric population (under 18 years of age) for the 
indication of COPD. 
Special populations  
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required in patients 65 years of age or older (see section 5.2). 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Renal impairment  
No dose adjustment is required in this population (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
Studies in subjects with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment showed an increase in systemic 
exposure to fluticasone furoate (both Cmax and AUC) (see section 5.2). 
Caution should be exercised when dosing patients with hepatic impairment who may be more at risk 
of systemic adverse reactions associated with corticosteroids.  
For patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment the maximum dose is 92/22 micrograms (see 
section 4.4).  
Method of administration  
Revinty Ellipta is for oral inhalation only. 
It should be administered at the same time of the day, each day. 
The final decision on evening or morning dosing should be left to the discretion of the physician. 
After inhalation, patients should rinse their mouth with water without swallowing. 
If a dose is missed the next dose should be taken at the usual time the next day. 
If stored in a refrigerator, the inhaler should be allowed to return to room temperature for at least an 
hour before use. 
When the inhaler is used for the first time, there is no need to check that it is working properly, and to 
prepare it for use in any special way. The step-by-step instructions should be followed. 
The Ellipta inhaler is packaged in a tray containing a desiccant sachet, to reduce moisture. The 
desiccant sachet should be thrown away and it should not be opened, eaten or inhaled.  
The patient should be advised to not open the tray until they are ready to inhale a dose.  
When the inhaler is taken out of its tray, it will be in the ‘closed’ position. The “Discard by” date 
should be written on the inhaler label in the space provided. The “Discard by” date is 6 weeks from the 
date of opening the tray. After this date the inhaler should no longer be used. The tray can be discarded 
after first opening. 
The step-by-step instructions shown below for the 30-dose Ellipta inhaler (30 day supply) also apply 
to the 14-dose Ellipta inhaler (14 day supply). 
Instructions for use 
1. 
Read this before you start 
If the inhaler cover is opened and closed without inhaling the medicinal product, the dose will be lost. 
The lost dose will be securely held inside the inhaler, but it will no longer be available to be inhaled.  
It is not possible to accidentally take extra medicinal product or a double dose in one inhalation.

2. 
Prepare a dose 
Open the cover when ready to inhale a dose. The inhaler should not be shaken. 
Slide the cover down until  a ‘click’ is heard. The medicinal product is now ready to be inhaled.  
The dose counter counts down by 1 to confirm. If the dose counter does not count down as the ‘click’ 
is heard, the inhaler will not deliver a dose and should be taken back to a pharmacist for advice. 
3. 
How to inhale the medicinal product 
The inhaler should be held away from the mouth breathing out as far as is comfortable, but not 
breathing out into the inhaler. 
The mouthpiece should be placed between lips and the lips should be then closed firmly around it. The 
air vents should not be blocked with fingers during use.  
• 
Inhale with one long, steady, deep breath in. The breath should be held for as long as possible (at 
least 3-4 seconds).  
•  Remove the inhaler from the mouth. 
•  Breathe out slowly and gently.  
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Your lips fit over the 
contoured shape of 
the mouthpiece for  
inhaling. 
Do not block the air 
vent with your fingers. 
The medicinal product may not be tasted or felt, even when using the inhaler correctly. 
The mouthpiece of the inhaler may be cleaned using a dry tissue before closing the cover. 
4. 
Close the inhaler and rinse your mouth  
Slide the cover upwards as far as it will go to cover the mouthpiece. 
Rinse your mouth with water after you have used the inhaler, do not swallow. 
This will make it less likely to develop a sore mouth or throat as side effects. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Deterioration of disease 
Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol should not be used to treat acute asthma symptoms or an acute 
exacerbation in COPD, for which a short-acting bronchodilator is required. Increasing use of short-
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
acting bronchodilators to relieve symptoms indicates deterioration of control and patients should be 
reviewed by a physician.  
Patients should not stop therapy with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol in asthma or COPD, without 
physician supervision since symptoms may recur after discontinuation. 
Asthma-related adverse events and exacerbations may occur during treatment with fluticasone 
furoate/vilanterol. Patients should be asked to continue treatment but to seek medical advice if asthma 
symptoms remain uncontrolled or worsen after initiation of treatment with Revinty Ellipta. 
Paradoxical bronchospasm 
Paradoxical bronchospasm may occur with an immediate increase in wheezing after dosing. This 
should be treated immediately with a short-acting inhaled bronchodilator. Revinty Ellipta should be 
discontinued immediately, the patient assessed and alternative therapy instituted if necessary. 
Cardiovascular effects 
Cardiovascular effects, such as cardiac arrhythmias e.g. supraventricular tachycardia and extrasystoles 
may be seen with sympathomimetic medicinal products including Revinty Ellipta. In a placebo-
controlled study in subjects with moderate COPD and a history of, or an increased risk of 
cardiovascular disease, there was no increase in the risk of cardiovascular events in patients receiving 
fluticasone furoate/vilanterol compared with placebo (see section 5.1). However, fluticasone 
furoate/vilanterol should be used with caution in patients with severe cardiovascular disease or heart 
rhythm abnormalities, thyrotoxicosis, uncorrected hypokalaemia or patients predisposed to low levels 
of serum potassium. 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
For patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, the 92/22 micrograms dose should be used 
and patients should be monitored for systemic corticosteroid-related adverse reactions (see section 
5.2). 
Systemic corticosteroid effects 
Systemic effects may occur with any inhaled corticosteroid, particularly at high doses prescribed for 
long periods. These effects are much less likely to occur than with oral corticosteroids. Possible 
systemic effects include Cushing’s syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, decrease in 
bone mineral density, growth retardation in children and adolescents, cataract and glaucoma and more 
rarely, a range of psychological or behavioural effects including psychomotor hyperactivity, sleep 
disorders, anxiety, depression or aggression (particularly in children). 
Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol should be administered with caution in patients with pulmonary 
tuberculosis or in patients with chronic or untreated infections.  
Visual disturbance  
Visual disturbance may be reported with systemic and topical corticosteroid use. If a patient presents 
with symptoms such as blurred vision or other visual disturbances, the patient should be considered for 
referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation of possible causes which may include cataract, glaucoma 
or rare diseases such as central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) which have been reported after use of 
systemic and topical corticosteroids. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hyperglycaemia 
There have been reports of increases in blood glucose levels in diabetic patients and this should be 
considered when prescribing to patients with a history of diabetes mellitus. 
Pneumonia in patients with COPD 
An increase in the incidence of pneumonia, including pneumonia requiring hospitalisation, has been 
observed in patients with COPD receiving inhaled corticosteroids. There is some evidence of an 
increased risk of pneumonia with increasing steroid dose but this has not been demonstrated 
conclusively across all studies. 
There is no conclusive clinical evidence for intra-class differences in the magnitude of the pneumonia 
risk among inhaled corticosteroid products. 
Physicians should remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia in patients with COPD 
as the clinical features of such infections overlap with the symptoms of COPD exacerbations. 
Risk factors for pneumonia in patients with COPD include current smoking, older age, low body mass 
index (BMI) and severe COPD. 
Pneumonia in patients with asthma 
The incidence of pneumonia in patients with asthma was common at the higher dose. The incidence of 
pneumonia in patients with asthma taking fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 184/22 micrograms was 
numerically higher compared with those receiving fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms or 
placebo (see section 4.8). No risk factors were identified. 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose 
intolerance, the total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not use this 
medicinal product. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Clinically significant drug interactions mediated by fluticasone furoate/vilanterol at clinical doses are 
considered unlikely due to the low plasma concentrations achieved after inhaled dosing. 
Interaction with beta-blockers 
Beta2-adrenergic blockers may weaken or antagonise the effect of beta2-adrenergic agonists. 
Concurrent use of both non-selective and selective beta2-adrenergic blockers should be avoided unless 
there are compelling reasons for their use. 
Interaction with CYP3A4 inhibitors 
Fluticasone furoate and vilanterol are both rapidly cleared by extensive first pass metabolism mediated 
by the liver enzyme CYP3A4.  
Caution is advised when co-administering with strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, 
ritonavir, cobicistat-containing products) as there is potential for increased systemic exposure to both 
fluticasone furoate and vilanterol. Co-administration should be avoided unless the benefit outweighs 
the increased risk of systemic corticosteroid undesirable effects, in which case patients should be 
monitored for systemic corticosteroid undesirable effects. A repeat dose CYP3A4 drug interaction 
study was performed in healthy subjects with the fluticasone furoate/vilanterol combination 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(184/22 micrograms) and the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg). Co-administration 
increased mean fluticasone furoate AUC(0-24) and Cmax by 36% and 33%, respectively. The increase in 
fluticasone furoate exposure was associated with a 27% reduction in 0-24 hours weighted mean serum 
cortisol. Co-administration increased mean vilanterol AUC(0-t) and Cmax 65% and 22%, 
respectively. The increase in vilanterol exposure was not associated with an increase in beta2-agonist 
related systemic effects on heart rate, blood potassium or QTcF interval.  
Interaction with P-glycoprotein inhibitors 
Fluticasone furoate and vilanterol are both substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). A clinical 
pharmacology study in healthy subjects with co-administered vilanterol and the potent P-gp and 
moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor verapamil did not show any significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of 
vilanterol. Clinical pharmacology studies with a specific P-gp inhibitor and fluticasone furoate have 
not been conducted. 
Sympathomimetic medicinal products 
Concomitant administration of other sympathomimetic medicinal products (alone or as part of 
combination therapy) may potentiate the adverse reactions of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol. Revinty 
Ellipta should not be used in conjunction with other long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists or medicinal 
products containing long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists. 
Paediatric population 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity at exposures which are not clinically relevant (see 
section 5.3). There are no or limited data from the use of fluticasone furoate and vilanterol trifenatate 
in pregnant women. 
Administration of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol to pregnant women should only be considered if the 
expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
There is insufficient information on the excretion of fluticasone furoate or vilanterol trifenatate and/or 
metabolites in human milk. However, other corticosteroids and beta2-agonists are detected in human 
milk (see section 5.3). A risk to breastfed newborns/infants cannot be excluded. 
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue fluticasone 
furoate/vilanterol therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit 
of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
There are no fertility data in humans. Animal studies showed no effect of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 
trifenatate on fertility (see section 5.3).

4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Fluticasone furoate or vilanterol has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use 
machines.  
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
Data from large asthma and COPD clinical trials were used to determine the frequency of adverse 
reactions associated with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol. In the asthma clinical development programme 
a total of 7,034 patients were included in an integrated assessment of adverse reactions. In the COPD 
clinical development programme a total of 6,237 subjects were included in an integrated assessment of 
adverse reactions. 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions with fluticasone furoate and vilanterol were headache 
and nasopharyngitis. With the exception of pneumonia and fractures, the safety profile was similar in 
patients with asthma and COPD. During clinical studies, pneumonia and fractures were more 
frequently observed in patients with COPD.  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions are listed by system organ class and frequency. The following convention has been 
used for the classification of frequencies: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); 
uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000).  
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
*Pneumonia (see section 4.4) 
In an integrated analysis of the two replicate one year studies in moderate to severe COPD (mean 
predicted post-bronchodilator screening FEV1 of 45%, standard deviation (SD) 13%) with an 
exacerbation in the preceding year (n = 3255), the number of pneumonia events per 1000 patient years 
was 97.9 with FF/VI 184/22 micrograms, 85.7 in the FF/VI 92/22 micrograms and 42.3 in the VI 22 
micrograms group. For severe pneumonia the corresponding number of events per 1000 patient years 
were 33.6, 35.5, and 7.6 respectively, while for serious pneumonia the corresponding events per 1000 
patient years were 35.1 for FF/VI 184/22 micrograms, 42.9 with FF/VI 92/22 micrograms, 12.1 with 
VI 22 micrograms. Finally, the exposure-adjusted cases of fatal pneumonia were 8.8 for FF/VI 184/22 
micrograms versus 1.5 for FF/VI 92/22 micrograms and 0 for VI 22 micrograms.  
In a placebo-controlled study (SUMMIT) in subjects with moderate COPD (mean percent post-
bronchodilator screening FEV1 of 60%, SD 6%), and a history of, or an increased risk of 
cardiovascular disease, the incidence of pneumonia with FF/VI, FF, VI and placebo was: adverse 
events (6%, 5%, 4%, 5%); serious adverse events (3%, 4%, 3%, 3%); adjudicated on treatment deaths 
due to pneumonia (0.3%, 0.2%, 0.1%, 0.2%); the exposure adjusted rates (per 1000 treatment years) 
were: adverse events (39.5, 42.4, 27.7, 38.4); serious adverse events (22.4, 25.1, 16.4, 22.2); 
adjudicated on-treatment deaths due to pneumonia (1.8, 1.5, 0.9, 1.4) respectively. 
In an integrated analysis of 11 studies in asthma (7,034 patients), the incidence of pneumonia per 1000 
patient years was 18.4 for FF/VI 184/22 micrograms versus 9.6 for FF/VI 92/22 micrograms and 8.0 
in the placebo group. 
**Fractures 
In two replicate 12 month studies in a total of 3,255 patients with COPD the incidence of bone 
fractures overall was low in all treatment groups, with a higher incidence in all Revinty Ellipta groups 
(2%) compared with the vilanterol 22 micrograms group (<1%). Although there were more fractures 
in the Revinty Ellipta groups compared with the vilanterol 22 micrograms group, fractures typically 
associated with corticosteroid use (e.g., spinal compression/thoracolumbar vertebral fractures, hip and 
acetabular fractures) occurred in <1% of the Revinty Ellipta and vilanterol treatment arms. 
For the SUMMIT study, the incidence of all events of fracture with FF/VI, FF, VI and placebo were 
2% in each arm; fractures commonly associated with ICS use were less than 1 % in each arm. The 
exposure-adjusted rates (per 1000 treatment years) for all fracture events were 13.6, 12.8, 13.2, 11.5 
respectively; fractures commonly associated with ICS use were 3.4, 3.9, 2.4, 2.1 respectively. 
In an integrated analysis of 11 studies in asthma (7,034 patients), the incidence of fractures was <1%, 
and usually associated with trauma.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms and signs  
An overdose of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol may produce signs and symptoms due to the individual 
component’s actions, including those seen with overdose of other beta2-agonists and consistent with 
the known inhaled corticosteroid class effects (see section 4.4). 
Treatment  
There is no specific treatment for an overdose with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol. If overdose occurs, 
the patient should be treated supportively with appropriate monitoring as necessary.  
Cardioselective beta-blockade should only be considered for profound vilanterol overdose effects that 
are clinically concerning and unresponsive to supportive measures. Cardioselective beta-blocking 
medicinal products should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchospasm. 
Further management should be as clinically indicated or as recommended by the national poisons 
centre, where available.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for obstructive airways diseases, adrenergics in combination with 
corticosteroids or other drugs, excl. anticholinergics, ATC code: R03AK10. 
Mechanism of action 
Fluticasone furoate and vilanterol represent two classes of medications (a synthetic corticosteroid and 
a selective, long-acting beta2-receptor agonist). 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Fluticasone furoate 
Fluticasone furoate is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with potent anti-inflammatory activity. 
The precise mechanism through which fluticasone furoate affects asthma and COPD symptoms is not 
known. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of actions on multiple cell types (e.g. 
eosinophils, macrophages, lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g. cytokines and chemokines involved in 
inflammation). 
Vilanterol trifenatate 
Vilanterol trifenatate is a selective long-acting, beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA).  
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The pharmacologic effects of beta2-adrenoceptor agonist active substances, including vilanterol 
trifenatate, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenylate cyclase, the enzyme 
that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3’,5’-adenosine 
monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth 
muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from 
mast cells. 
Molecular interactions occur between corticosteroids and LABAs, whereby steroids activate the beta2-
receptor gene, increasing receptor number and sensitivity and LABAs prime the glucocorticoid 
receptor for steroid-dependent activation and enhance cell nuclear translocation. These synergistic 
interactions are reflected in enhanced anti-inflammatory activity, which has been demonstrated in vitro 
and in vivo in a range of inflammatory cells relevant to the pathophysiology of both asthma and 
COPD. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells from subjects with COPD, a larger anti-inflammatory 
effect was seen in the presence of the combination of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol compared with 
fluticasone furoate alone at concentrations achieved with clinical doses. The enhanced anti-
inflammatory effect of the LABA component was similar to that obtained with other ICS/LABA 
combinations. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Asthma 
Three phase III randomised, double-blind studies (HZA106827, HZA106829 and HZA106837) of 
different durations evaluated the safety and efficacy of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol in adult and 
adolescent patients with persistent asthma. All subjects were using an ICS (Inhaled corticosteroid) 
with or without LABA for at least 12 weeks prior to visit 1. In HZA106837 all patients had at least 
one exacerbation that required treatment with oral corticosteroids in the year prior to visit 1. 
HZA106827 was 12 weeks in duration and evaluated the efficacy of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 
92/22 micrograms [n=201] and FF 92 micrograms [n=205]) compared with placebo [n=203], all 
administered once daily. HZA106829 was 24 weeks in duration and evaluated the efficacy of 
fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 184/22 micrograms [n=197] and FF 184 micrograms [n=194]) both 
administered once daily compared with FP 500 micrograms twice daily [n=195].  
In HZA106827/HZA106829 the co-primary efficacy endpoints were change from baseline in clinic 
visit trough (pre-bronchodilator and pre-dose) FEV1 at the end of the treatment period in all subjects 
and weighted mean serial FEV1 over 0-24 hours post-dose calculated in a subset of subjects at the end 
of the treatment period. Change from baseline in the percentage of rescue-free 24 hour periods during 
treatment was a powered secondary endpoint. Results for the primary and key secondary endpoints in 
these studies are described in Table 1.

*FF/VI = fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 
HZA106837 was of variable treatment duration (from a minimum of 24 weeks to a maximum of 76 
weeks with the majority of patients treated for at least 52 weeks). In HZA106837 patients were 
randomised to receive either fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms [n=1009] or FF 
92 micrograms [n=1010] both administered once daily. In HZA106837 the primary endpoint was the 
time to first severe asthma exacerbation. A severe asthma exacerbation was defined as deterioration of 
asthma requiring the use of systemic corticosteroids for at least 3 days or an inpatient hospitalization 
or emergency department visit due to asthma that required systemic corticosteroids. Adjusted mean 
change from baseline in trough FEV1 was also evaluated as a secondary endpoint. 
In HZA106837 the risk of experiencing a severe asthma exacerbation in patients receiving fluticasone 
furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms was reduced by 20% compared with FF 92 micrograms alone 
(hazard ratio 0.795, p=0.036 95% CI 0.642, 0.985). The rate of severe asthma exacerbations per 
patient per year was 0.19 in the FF 92 micrograms group (approximately 1 in every 5 years) and 0.14 
in the fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms group (approximately 1 in every 7 years). The 
ratio of the exacerbation rate for fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms versus FF 
92 micrograms was 0.755 (95% CI 0.603, 0.945). This represents a 25% reduction in the rate of severe 
asthma exacerbations for subjects treated with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms 
compared with FF 92 micrograms (p=0.014). The 24-hour bronchodilator effect of fluticasone 
furoate/vilanterol was maintained throughout a one-year treatment period with no evidence of loss in 
efficacy (no tachyphylaxis). Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms consistently 
demonstrated 83 mL to 95 mL improvements in trough FEV1 at weeks 12, 36 and 52 and Endpoint 
compared with FF 92 micrograms (p<0.001 95% CI 52, 126 mL at Endpoint). Forty four percent of 
patients in the fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms group were well controlled (ACQ7 
≤0.75) at end of treatment compared to 36% of subjects in the FF 92 micrograms group (p<0.001 95% 
CI 1.23, 1.82). 
Studies versus salmeterol/fluticasone propionate combinations 
In a 24 week study (HZA113091) in adult and adolescent patients with uncontrolled persistent asthma 
both fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms given once daily in the evening and 
salmeterol/FP 50/250 micrograms given twice daily demonstrated improvements from baseline in lung

function. Adjusted mean treatment increases from baseline in weighted mean 0-24 hours FEV1 of 
341 mL (fluticasone furoate/vilanterol) and 377 mL (salmeterol/FP) demonstrated an overall 
improvement in lung function over 24 hours for both treatments. The adjusted mean treatment 
difference of -37 mL between the groups was not statistically significant (p=0.162). For trough FEV1 
subjects in the fluticasone furoate/vilanterol group achieved a LS mean change from baseline of 
281 mL and subjects in the salmeterol/FP group a change of 300 mL; (the difference in adjusted mean 
of -19 mL (95%CI:-0.073, 0.034) was not statistically significant (p=0.485). 
A randomised, double-blind, parallel group, 24 week study (201378) was conducted to demonstrate 
non-inferiority (using a margin of -100 mL for trough FEV1) of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 
micrograms once daily to salmeterol/FP 50/250 micrograms twice daily in adults and adolescents 
whose asthma was well controlled following 4 weeks of treatment with open-label salmeterol/FP 
50/250 micrograms twice daily (N=1504). Subjects randomised to once-daily FF/VI maintained lung 
function comparable with those randomised to twice-daily salmeterol/FP [difference in trough FEV1 of 
+19 mL (95% CI: -11, 49)]. 
No comparative studies versus salmeterol/FP or versus other ICS/LABA combinations have been 
conducted to appropriately compare the effects on asthma exacerbations. 
Fluticasone furoate monotherapy 
A 24 week randomised, double-blind placebo controlled study (FFA112059) evaluated the safety and 
efficacy of FF 92 micrograms once daily [n= 114] and FP 250 micrograms twice daily [n=114] versus 
placebo [n=115] in adult and adolescent patients with persistent asthma. All subjects had to have been 
on a stable dose of an ICS for at least 4 weeks prior to visit 1 (screening visit) and the use of LABAs 
was not permitted within 4 weeks of visit 1. The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline 
in clinic visit trough (pre-bronchodilator and pre-dose) FEV1 at the end of the treatment period. 
Change from baseline in the percentage of rescue-free 24 hour periods during the 24-week treatment 
period was a powered secondary. At the 24-week time point FF and FP increased trough FEV1 by 
146 mL (95% CI 36, 257 mL, p=0.009) and 145 mL (95% CI 33, 257 mL, p=0.011) respectively 
compared to placebo. FF and FP both increased the percentage of 24-hour rescue free periods by 
14.8% (95% CI 6.9, 22.7, p<0.001) and 17.9% (95% CI 10.0, 25.7, p<0.001) respectively versus 
placebo.  
Allergen challenge study 
The bronchoprotective effect of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms on the early and late 
asthmatic response to inhaled allergen was evaluated in a repeat dose, placebo-controlled four-way 
crossover study (HZA113126) in patients with mild asthma. Patients were randomized to receive 
fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms, FF 92 micrograms, vilanterol 22 micrograms or 
placebo once daily for 21 days followed by challenge with allergen 1 hour after the final dose. The 
allergen was house dust mite, cat dander, or birch pollen; the selection was based on individual 
screening tests. Serial FEV1 measurements were compared with pre-allergen challenge values taken 
after saline inhalation (baseline). Overall, the greatest effects on the early asthmatic response were 
seen with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms compared with FF 92 micrograms or 
vilanterol 22 micrograms alone. Both fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms and FF 
92 micrograms virtually abolished the late asthmatic response compared with vilanterol alone. 
Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms provided significantly greater protection against 
allergen-induced bronchial hyper-reactivity compared with monotherapies FF and vilanterol as 
assessed on Day 22 by methacholine challenge.  
Bronchoprotective and HPA-axis effects study 
The bronchoprotective and HPA-axis effects of FF versus FP or budesonide (BUD) were evaluated in 
an escalating repeat-dose, placebo-controlled, crossover study (203162) in 54 adults with a history of 
asthma, characterised by airway hyperresponsiveness and FEV1 ≥65% predicted. Patients were 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
randomised to one or two treatment periods, comprising five 7-day dose-escalation phases of FF (25, 
100, 200, 400, 800 micrograms/day), FP (50, 200, 500, 1,000, 2,000 micrograms/day), BUD (100, 
400, 800, 1,600, 3,200 micrograms/day), or placebo. After each dose-escalation phase, 
bronchoprotection via airway hyperresponsiveness to adenosine-5'-monophosphate (AMP) challenge 
(provocative concentration causing ≥20% decline in FEV1 [AMP PC20]) and 24-hour weighted mean 
plasma cortisol were assessed. 
Across the approved therapeutic dose ranges for asthma the AMP PC20 (mg/mL) and cortisol 
suppression (%) values were: 81 to 116 mg/mL and 7% to 14% for FF (100 to 200 micrograms/day), 
20 to 76 mg/mL and 7% to 50% for FP (200 to 2,000 micrograms/day), and 24 to 54 mg/mL and 13% 
to 44% for BUD (400 to 1,600 micrograms/day), respectively.  
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease  
The COPD clinical development programme included a 12-week (HZC113107), two 6-month 
(HZC112206, HZC112207), two one-year (HZC102970, HZC102871), and one >1 year study 
(SUMMIT). These were randomised controlled studies in patients with a clinical diagnosis of COPD. 
These studies included measures of lung function, dyspnoea and moderate and severe exacerbations. 
Six month studies 
HZC112206 and HZC112207 were 24 week randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel 
group studies comparing the effect of the combination to vilanterol and FF alone and placebo. 
HZC112206 evaluated the efficacy of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 46 /22 micrograms [n=206] and 
fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms [n=206] compared with FF 92 micrograms [n=206], 
vilanterol 22 micrograms [n=205] and placebo [n = 207], all administered once daily. HZC112207 
evaluated the efficacy of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms [n=204] and fluticasone 
furoate/vilanterol 184/22 micrograms [n=205] compared with FF 92 micrograms [n=204], FF 
184 micrograms [n=203] and vilanterol 22 micrograms [n=203] and placebo [n = 205], all 
administered once daily. 
All patients were required to have a smoking history of at least 10 pack years; a post-salbutamol 
FEV1/FVC ratio less than or equal to 0.70; post-salbutamol FEV1 less than or equal to 70% predicted 
and have a Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea score ≥2 (scale 0-4) at screening. 
At screening, the mean pre-bronchodilator FEV1 was 42.6% and 43.6% predicted, and the mean 
reversibility was 15.9% and 12.0% in HZC112206 and HZC112207, respectively. The co-primary 
endpoints in both studies were weighted mean FEV1 from zero to 4 hours post-dose at Day 168 and 
change from baseline in pre-dose trough FEV1 at Day 169. 
In an integrated analysis of both studies, fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms showed 
clinically meaningful improvements in lung function. At Day 169 fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 
92/22 micrograms and vilanterol increased adjusted mean trough FEV1 by 129 mL (95% CI: 91, 
167 mL, p<0.001) and 83 mL (95% CI: 46, 121 mL, p<0.001) respectively compared to placebo. 
Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms increased trough FEV1 by 46 mL compared to 
vilanterol (95% CI: 8, 83 mL, p= 0.017). At Day 168 fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms 
and vilanterol increased adjusted mean weighted mean FEV1 over 0-4 hours by 193 mL (95% CI: 156, 
230 mL, p<0.001) and 145 mL (95% CI: 108, 181 mL, p<0.001) respectively compared to placebo. 
Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms increased adjusted mean weighted mean FEV1 over 0-
4 hours by 148 mL compared to FF alone (95% CI: 112, 184 mL, p< 0.001). 
12 month studies 
Studies HZC102970 and HZC102871 were 52 week randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, studies 
comparing the effect of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 184/22 micrograms, fluticasone 
furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms, fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 46/22 micrograms with vilanterol

22 micrograms, all administered once daily, on the annual rate of moderate/severe exacerbations in 
subjects with COPD with a smoking history of at least 10 pack years and a post-salbutamol FEV1/FVC 
ratio less than or equal to 0.70 and post-salbutamol FEV1 less than or equal to 70% predicted and 
documented history of ≥ 1 COPD exacerbation that required antibiotics and/or oral corticosteroids or 
hospitalisation in the 12 months prior to visit 1. The primary endpoint was the annual rate of moderate 
and severe exacerbations. Moderate/ severe exacerbations were defined as worsening symptoms that 
required treatment with oral corticosteroids and/or antibiotics or in-patient hospitalisation. Both 
studies had a 4 week run-in period during which all subjects received open-label salmeterol/FP 50/250 
micrograms twice daily to standardise COPD pharmacotherapy and stabilise disease prior to 
randomisation to blinded study medication for 52 weeks. Prior to run-in, subjects discontinued use of 
previous COPD medications except short-acting bronchodilators. The use of concurrent inhaled long-
acting bronchodilators (beta2-agonist and anticholinergic), ipratropium/salbutamol combination 
products, oral beta2-agonists, and theophylline preparations were not allowed during the treatment 
period. Oral corticosteroids and antibiotics were allowed for the acute treatment of COPD 
exacerbations with specific guidelines for use. Subjects used salbutamol on an as-needed basis 
throughout the studies.  
The results of both studies showed that treatment with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms 
once daily resulted in a lower annual rate of moderate/severe COPD exacerbations compared with 
vilanterol (Table 2).

In an integrated analysis of HZC102970 and HZC102871 at Week 52, an improvement was seen when 
comparing the fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms versus vilanterol 22 micrograms in 
adjusted mean trough FEV1 (42 mL 95% CI: 19, 64 mL, p<0.001). The 24-hour bronchodilator effect

of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol was maintained from the first dose throughout a one-year treatment 
period with no evidence of loss in efficacy (no tachyphylaxis). 
Overall, across the two studies combined 2009 (62%) patients had cardiovascular history/risk factors 
at screening. The incidence of cardiovascular history/risk factors was similar across the treatment 
groups with patients most commonly suffering from hypertension (46%), followed by 
hypercholesterolemia (29%) and diabetes mellitus (12%). Similar effects in reduction of moderate and 
severe exacerbations were observed in this subgroup as compared with the overall population. In 
patients with a cardiovascular history/risk factors, fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms 
resulted in a significantly lower annual rate of moderate/severe COPD exacerbations compared with 
vilanterol (adjusted mean annual rates of 0.83 and 1.18 respectively, 30% reduction (95% CI 16, 42%, 
p<0.001)). Improvements were also seen in this subgroup at Week 52 when comparing the fluticasone 
furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms vs. vilanterol 22 micrograms in adjusted mean trough FEV1 
(44 mL 95% CI: 15, 73 mL, (p=0.003)). 
Studies > 1 year duration 
SUMMIT was a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind study evaluating the effect on survival of 
fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms compared with placebo in 16,485 subjects. The 
primary endpoint was all-cause mortality and a secondary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular 
events (on-treatment cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, unstable angina, or transient 
ischemic attack).  
Prior to randomization, subjects were required to discontinue previous COPD medications used at 
baseline, which included long-acting bronchodilators plus inhaled corticosteroids (28%), long-acting 
bronchodilators alone (11%) and inhaled corticosteroids alone (4%). Subjects were then randomized to 
receive either fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms, fluticasone furoate 92 micrograms, 
vilanterol 22 micrograms, or placebo, and treated for a mean of 1.7 years (SD = 0.9 years).  
Subjects had moderate COPD (mean percent post-bronchodilator screening FEV1 of 60% [SD = 6%]), 
and a history of, or an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. In the 12 months prior to the study, 
61% of subjects reported no COPD exacerbations and 39% of subjects reported ≥1 moderate/severe 
COPD exacerbation. 
All-cause mortality was: fluticasone furoate/vilanterol, 6.0%; placebo, 6.7%; fluticasone furoate, 
6.1%; vilanterol, 6.4%. Exposure-adjusted all-cause mortality per 100 patients/year (%/yr) was: 
fluticasone furoate/vilanterol, 3.1 %/yr; placebo, 3.5 %/yr; fluticasone furoate, 3.2 %/yr; and 
vilanterol, 3.4 %/yr. Mortality risk with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol was not significantly different 
compared with placebo (HR 0.88; 95% CI: 0.74 to 1.04; p=0.137), fluticasone furoate (HR 0.96; 95% 
CI: 0.81 to 1.15; p=0.681) or vilanterol (HR 0.91; 95% CI: 0.77 to 1.09; p=0.299).  
The risk of the cardiovascular composite event with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol was not significantly 
different compared with placebo (HR 0.93; 95% CI: 0.75 to 1.14), fluticasone furoate (HR 1.03; 
95% CI: 0.83 to 1.28) or vilanterol (HR 0.94; 95% CI: 0.76 to 1.16). 
Studies versus salmeterol/fluticasone propionate combinations 
In a 12 week study (HZC113107) in COPD patients both fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 
92/22 micrograms given once daily in the morning and salmeterol/FP 50/500 micrograms given twice 
daily, demonstrated improvements from baseline in lung function. Adjusted mean treatment increases 
from baseline in weighted mean 0-24 hours FEV1 of 130 mL (fluticasone furoate/vilanterol) and 
108 mL (salmeterol/FP) demonstrated an overall improvement in lung function over 24 hours for both 
treatments. The adjusted mean treatment difference of 22 mL (95% CI: -18, 63mL) between the 
groups was not statistically significant (p=0.282). The adjusted mean change from baseline in trough 
FEV1 on Day 85 was 111 mL in the fluticasone furoate/vilanterol group and 88 mL in the 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
salmeterol/FP group; the 23 mL (95% CI: -20, 66) difference between the treatment groups was not 
clinically meaningful or statistically significant (p=0.294). 
No comparative studies versus salmeterol/FP or versus other established bronchodilators have been 
conducted to appropriately compare the effects on COPD exacerbations. 
Paediatric population 
Asthma 
The efficacy and safety of fluticasone furoate (FF)/vilanterol (VI) administered once daily compared 
to FF administered once daily in the treatment of asthma in paediatric patients aged 5-11 years was 
evaluated in a randomised, double-blind, multicentre clinical trial of 24 weeks duration and 1-week 
follow-up period (HZA107116) involving 673 patients with uncontrolled asthma, on inhaled 
corticosteroids. 
All subjects had stable asthma therapy [short-acting beta agonist or short-acting muscarinic antagonist 
inhaler plus inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)] for at least 4 weeks prior to Visit 1. Patients were 
symptomatic (i.e., remained uncontrolled) on their existing asthma treatment.  
Subjects were treated with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 46/22 micrograms (337 patients) or 
fluticasone furoate 46 micrograms (336 patients). Two patients, one in each arm, were not assessable 
for efficacy. 
The primary endpoint was change from baseline, averaged over weeks 1 to 12 of the treatment period, 
in pre-dose (i.e., trough) morning peak expiratory flow (PEF), captured daily via electronic patient 
diary (difference between FF/VI combination and FF). Change from baseline in the percentage of

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
The absolute bioavailability for fluticasone furoate and vilanterol when administered by inhalation as 
fluticasone furoate/vilanterol was on average 15.2% and 27.3%, respectively. The oral bioavailability 
of both fluticasone furoate and vilanterol was low, on average 1.26% and <2%, respectively. Given 
this low oral bioavailability, systemic exposure for fluticasone furoate and vilanterol following inhaled 
administration is primarily due to absorption of the inhaled portion of the dose delivered to the lung. 
Distribution 
Following intravenous dosing, both fluticasone furoate and vilanterol are extensively distributed with 
average volumes of distribution at steady state of 661 L and 165 L, respectively. 
Both fluticasone furoate and vilanterol have a low association with red blood cells. In vitro plasma 
protein binding in human plasma of fluticasone furoate and vilanterol was high, on average >99.6% 
and 93.9%, respectively. There was no decrease in the extent of in vitro plasma protein binding in 
subjects with renal or hepatic impairment. 
Fluticasone furoate and vilanterol are substrates for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), however, concomitant 
administration of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol with P-gp inhibitors is considered unlikely to alter 
fluticasone furoate or vilanterol systemic exposure since they are both well absorbed molecules. 
Biotransformation 
Based on in vitro data, the major routes of metabolism of both fluticasone furoate and vilanterol in 
human are mediated primarily by CYP3A4. 
Fluticasone furoate is primarily metabolised through hydrolysis of the S-fluoromethyl carbothioate 
group to metabolites with significantly reduced corticosteroid activity. Vilanterol is primarily 
metabolised by O-dealkylation to a range of metabolites with significantly reduced β1- and β2-agonist 
activity. 
Elimination 
Following oral administration, fluticasone furoate was eliminated in humans mainly by metabolism 
with metabolites being excreted almost exclusively in faeces, with <1% of the recovered radioactive 
dose eliminated in the urine. 
Following oral administration, vilanterol was eliminated mainly by metabolism followed by excretion 
of metabolites in urine and faeces approximately 70% and 30% of the radioactive dose respectively in 
a human radiolabel study conducted by the oral route. The apparent plasma elimination half-life of 
vilanterol following single inhaled administration of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol was, on average, 
2.5 hours. The effective half-life for accumulation of vilanterol, as determined from inhalation 
administration of repeat doses of vilanterol 25 micrograms, is 16.0 hours in subjects with asthma and 
21.3 hours in subjects with COPD. 
Paediatric population  
In adolescents (12 years or older), there are no recommended dose modifications. 
The pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol have been studied in 
children from 5 to 11 years old, but no recommendation on a posology can be made (see section 4.2). 
The pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol in children under the age of 
5 years have not been established.  
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Special populations  
Elderly 
The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of fluticasone furoate and vilanterol were determined in 
phase III studies in COPD and asthma. There was no evidence for age (12 to 84 years) to affect the 
pharmacokinetics of fluticasone furoate and vilanterol in subjects with asthma. 
There was no evidence for age to affect the pharmacokinetics of fluticasone furoate in subjects with 
COPD while there was an increase (37%) in AUC (0-24) of vilanterol over the observed age range of 41 
to 84 years. For an elderly subject (aged 84 years) with low bodyweight (35 kg) vilanterol AUC (0-24) is 
predicted to be 35% higher than the population estimate (subject with COPD aged 60 years and 
bodyweight of 70 kg), whilst Cmax was unchanged. These differences are unlikely to be of clinical 
relevance. 
In elderly subjects with asthma and elderly subjects with COPD there are no recommended dose 
modifications. 
Renal impairment  
A clinical pharmacology study of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol showed that severe renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) did not result in significantly greater exposure to fluticasone 
furoate or vilanterol or more marked corticosteroid or beta2-agonist systemic effects compared with 
healthy subjects.  
No dose adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment. 
The effects of haemodialysis have not been studied. 
Hepatic impairment 
Following repeat dosing of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol for 7 days, there was an increase in 
fluticasone furoate systemic exposure (up to three-fold as measured by AUC(0–24)) in subjects with 
hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A, B or C) compared with healthy subjects. The increase in 
fluticasone furoate systemic exposure in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B; 
fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 184/22 micrograms) was associated with an average 34% reduction in 
serum cortisol compared with healthy subjects. Dose-normalised fluticasone furoate systemic 
exposure was similar in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C). 
Following repeat dosing of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol for 7 days, there was no significant increase 
in systemic exposure to vilanterol (Cmax and AUC) in subjects with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh A, B or C). 
There were no clinically relevant effects of the fluticasone furoate/vilanterol combination on beta-
adrenergic systemic effects (heart rate or serum potassium) in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic 
impairment (vilanterol, 22 micrograms) or with severe hepatic impairment (vilanterol, 
12.5 micrograms) compared with healthy subjects. 
Other special populations  
In subjects with asthma, estimates of fluticasone furoate AUC(0-24) for East Asian, Japanese and South 
East Asian subjects (12-13% of subjects) were on average 33% to 53% higher compared with other 
racial groups. However, there was no evidence for the higher systemic exposure in this population to 
be associated with greater effect on 24 hour urinary cortisol excretion. On average, vilanterol Cmax is 
predicted to be 220 to 287% higher and AUC(0-24) comparable for those subjects from an Asian 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
heritage compared with subjects from other racial groups. However, there was no evidence that this 
higher vilanterol Cmax resulted in clinically significant effects on heart rate. 
In subjects with COPD estimates of fluticasone furoate AUC(0-24) for East Asian, Japanese and South 
East Asian subjects (13-14% subjects) were on average 23% to 30% higher compared with Caucasian 
subjects. However, there was no evidence for the higher systemic exposure in this population to be 
associated with greater effect on 24 hour urinary cortisol excretion. There was no effect of race on 
pharmacokinetic parameter estimates of vilanterol in subjects with COPD.  
Gender, weight and BMI  
There was no evidence for gender, weight or BMI (body mass index) to influence the 
pharmacokinetics of fluticasone furoate based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of phase III 
data in 1213 subjects with asthma (712 females) and 1225 subjects with COPD (392 females).  
There was no evidence for gender, weight or BMI to influence the pharmacokinetics of vilanterol 
based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 856 subjects with asthma (500 females) and 1091 
subjects with COPD (340 females). 
No dosage adjustment is necessary based on gender, weight or BMI. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Pharmacological and toxicological effects seen with fluticasone furoate or vilanterol in non-clinical 
studies were those typically associated with either glucocorticoids or beta2-agonists. Administration of 
fluticasone furoate combined with vilanterol did not result in any significant new toxicity. 
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
Fluticasone furoate 
Fluticasone furoate was not genotoxic in a standard battery of studies and was not carcinogenic in 
lifetime inhalation studies in rats or mice at exposures similar to those at the maximum recommended 
human dose, based on AUC.  
Vilanterol trifenatate 
In genetic toxicity studies, vilanterol (as alpha-phenylcinnamate) and triphenylacetic acid were not 
genotoxic indicating that vilanterol (as trifenatate) does not represent a genotoxic hazard to humans.  
Consistent with findings for other beta2 agonists, in lifetime inhalation studies vilanterol trifenatate 
caused proliferative effects in the female rat and mouse reproductive tract and rat pituitary gland. 
There was no increase in tumour incidence in rats or mice at exposures 1.2- or 30-fold, respectively, 
those at the maximum recommended human dose, based on AUC. 
Toxicity to reproduction and development  
Fluticasone furoate 
Effects seen following inhalation administration of fluticasone furoate in combination with vilanterol 
in rats were similar to those seen with fluticasone furoate alone.  
Fluticasone furoate was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits, but delayed development in rats and caused 
abortion in rabbits at maternally toxic doses. There were no effects on development in rats at 
exposures approximately 3-times greater than those at the maximum recommended human dose, based 
on AUC. 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Vilanterol trifenatate 
Vilanterol trifenatate was not teratogenic in rats. In inhalation studies in rabbits, vilanterol trifenatate 
caused effects similar to those seen with other beta2 agonists (cleft palate, open eyelids, sternebral 
fusion and limb flexure/malrotation). When given subcutaneously there were no effects at exposures 
84-times greater than those at the maximum recommended human dose, based on AUC. 
Neither fluticasone furoate nor vilanterol trifenatate had any adverse effects on fertility or pre- and 
post-natal development in rats.

4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
Asthma 
Revinty Ellipta is indicated for the regular treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents aged 12 years 
and older where use of a combination medicinal product (long-acting beta2-agonist and inhaled 
corticosteroid) is appropriate: 
• patients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and 'as needed' inhaled short acting 
beta2-agonists. 
• patients already adequately controlled on both inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta2-agonist. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Asthma 
Patients with asthma should be given the strength of Revinty Ellipta containing the appropriate 
fluticasone furoate (FF) dosage for the severity of their disease. Prescribers should be aware that in 
patients with asthma, fluticasone furoate (FF) 100 micrograms once daily is approximately equivalent 
to fluticasone propionate (FP) 250 micrograms twice daily, while FF 200 micrograms once daily is 
approximately equivalent to FP 500 micrograms twice daily. 
Adults and adolescents aged 12 years and over  
A starting dose of one inhalation of Revinty Ellipta 92/22 micrograms once daily should be considered 
for adults and adolescents 12 years and over who require a low to mid dose of inhaled corticosteroid in 
combination with a long-acting beta2-agonist. If patients are inadequately controlled on Revinty Ellipta 
92/22 micrograms, the dose can be increased to 184/22 micrograms, which may provide additional 
improvement in asthma control. 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients should be regularly reassessed by a healthcare professional so that the strength of fluticasone 
furoate/vilanterol they are receiving remains optimal and is only changed on medical advice. The dose 
should be titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control of symptoms is maintained. 
Revinty Ellipta 184/22 micrograms should be considered for adults and adolescents 12 years and over 
who require a higher dose of inhaled corticosteroid in combination with a long-acting beta2-agonist. 
Patients usually experience an improvement in lung function within 15 minutes of inhaling Revinty 
Ellipta.  
However, the patient should be informed that regular daily usage is necessary to maintain control of 
asthma symptoms and that use should be continued even when asymptomatic. 
If symptoms arise in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist should be used 
for immediate relief. 
The maximum recommended dose is Revinty Ellipta 184/22 micrograms once daily. 
Children aged under 12 years 
The safety and efficacy of Revinty Ellipta in children under 12 years of age have not been established 
in the indication for asthma. 
Revinty Ellipta should not be used in children under 12 years of age. Currently available data are 
described in sections 5.1 and 5.2.  
Special populations  
Elderly  
No dose adjustment is required in patients 65 years of age or older (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment  
No dose adjustment is required in this population (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
Studies in subjects with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment showed an increase in systemic 
exposure to fluticasone furoate (both Cmax and AUC) (see section 5.2). 
Caution should be exercised when dosing patients with hepatic impairment who may be more at risk 
of systemic adverse reactions associated with corticosteroids.  
For patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment the maximum dose is 92/22 micrograms (see 
section 4.4).  
Method of administration  
Revinty Ellipta is for oral inhalation only. 
It should be administered at the same time of the day, each day.  
The final decision on evening or morning dosing should be left to the discretion of the physician. 
After inhalation, patients should rinse their mouth with water without swallowing. 
If a dose is missed the next dose should be taken at the usual time the next day. 
If stored in a refrigerator, the inhaler should be allowed to return to room temperature for at least an 
hour before use.

When the inhaler is used for the first time, there is no need to check that it is working properly, and to 
prepare it for use in any special way. The step-by-step instructions should be followed. 
The Ellipta inhaler is packaged in a tray containing a desiccant sachet, to reduce moisture. The 
desiccant sachet should be thrown away and it should not be opened, eaten or inhaled. 
The patient should be advised to not open the tray until they are ready to inhale a dose.  
When the inhaler is taken out of its tray, it will be in the ‘closed’ position. The “Discard by” date 
should be written on the inhaler label in the space provided. The “Discard by” date is 6 weeks from the 
date of opening the tray. After this date the inhaler should no longer be used. The tray can be discarded 
after first opening. 
The step-by-step instructions shown below for the 30-dose Ellipta inhaler (30 day supply) also apply 
to the 14-dose Ellipta inhaler (14 day supply). 
Instructions for use 
1. 
Read this before you start 
If the inhaler cover is opened and closed without inhaling the medicinal product, the dose will be lost. 
The lost dose will be securely held inside the inhaler, but it will no longer be available to be inhaled.  
It is not possible to accidentally take extra medicinal product or a double dose in one inhalation. 
2. 
Prepare a dose 
Open the cover when ready to inhale a dose. The inhaler should not be shaken. 
Slide the cover down until a ‘click’ is heard. The medicinal product is now ready to be inhaled.  
The dose counter counts down by 1 to confirm. If the dose counter does not count down as the ‘click’ 
is heard, the inhaler will not deliver a dose and should be taken back to a pharmacist for advice.

3. 
How to inhale the medicinal product 
The inhaler  should be held away from the mouth breathing out as far as is comfortable, but not 
breathing out into the inhaler. 
The mouthpiece should be placed between lips and the lips should be then closed firmly around it. The 
air vents should not be blocked with fingers during use.  
• 
Inhale with one long, steady, deep breath in. The breath should be held for as long as possible (at 
least 3-4 seconds).  
•  Remove the inhaler from the mouth. 
•  Breathe out slowly and gently.  
Your lips fit over the 
contoured shape of 
the mouthpiece for  
inhaling. 
Do not block the air 
vent with your fingers. 
The medicinal product may not be tasted or felt, even when using the inhaler correctly. 
The mouthpiece of the inhaler may be cleaned using a dry tissue before closing the cover. 
4. 
Close the inhaler and rinse your mouth  
Slide the cover upwards as far as it will go to cover the mouthpiece. 
Rinse your mouth with water after you have used the inhaler, do not swallow. 
This will make it less likely to develop a sore mouth or throat as side effects.

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Deterioration of disease 
Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol should not be used to treat acute asthma symptoms, for which a short-
acting bronchodilator is required. Increasing use of short-acting bronchodilators to relieve symptoms 
indicates deterioration of control and patients should be reviewed by a physician.  
Patients should not stop therapy with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol in asthma, without physician 
supervision since symptoms may recur after discontinuation. 
Asthma-related adverse events and exacerbations may occur during treatment with fluticasone 
furoate/vilanterol. Patients should be asked to continue treatment but to seek medical advice if asthma 
symptoms remain uncontrolled or worsen after initiation of treatment with Revinty Ellipta. 
Paradoxical bronchospasm 
Paradoxical bronchospasm may occur with an immediate increase in wheezing after dosing. This 
should be treated immediately with a short-acting inhaled bronchodilator. Revinty Ellipta should be 
discontinued immediately, the patient assessed and alternative therapy instituted if necessary. 
Cardiovascular effects 
Cardiovascular effects, such as cardiac arrhythmias e.g. supraventricular tachycardia and extrasystoles 
may be seen with sympathomimetic medicinal products including Revinty Ellipta. In a placebo-
controlled study in subjects with moderate COPD and a history of, or an increased risk of 
cardiovascular disease, there was no increase in the risk of cardiovascular events in patients receiving 
fluticasone furoate/vilanterol compared with placebo. However, fluticasone furoate/vilanterol should 
be used with caution in patients with severe cardiovascular disease or heart rhythm abnormalities, 
thyrotoxicosis, uncorrected hypokalaemia or patients predisposed to low levels of serum potassium. 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
For patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, the 92/22 micrograms dose should be used 
and patients should be monitored for systemic corticosteroid-related adverse reactions (see section 
5.2). 
Systemic corticosteroid effects 
Systemic effects may occur with any inhaled corticosteroid, particularly at high doses prescribed for 
long periods. These effects are much less likely to occur than with oral corticosteroids. Possible 
systemic effects include Cushing’s syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, decrease in 
bone mineral density, growth retardation in children and adolescents, cataract and glaucoma and more 
rarely, a range of psychological or behavioural effects including psychomotor hyperactivity, sleep 
disorders, anxiety, depression or aggression (particularly in children). 
Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol should be administered with caution in patients with pulmonary 
tuberculosis or in patients with chronic or untreated infections.  
Visual disturbance  
Visual disturbance may be reported with systemic and topical corticosteroid use. If a patient presents 
with symptoms such as blurred vision or other visual disturbances, the patient should be considered for 
referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation of possible causes which may include cataract, glaucoma 
or rare diseases such as central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) which have been reported after use of 
systemic and topical corticosteroids. 
Hyperglycaemia 
There have been reports of increases in blood glucose levels in diabetic patients and this should be 
considered when prescribing to patients with a history of diabetes mellitus. 
Pneumonia in patients with COPD 
An increase in the incidence of pneumonia, including pneumonia requiring hospitalisation, has been 
observed in patients with COPD receiving inhaled corticosteroids. There is some evidence of an 
increased risk of pneumonia with increasing steroid dose but this has not been demonstrated 
conclusively across all studies. 
There is no conclusive clinical evidence for intra-class differences in the magnitude of the pneumonia 
risk among inhaled corticosteroid products. 
Physicians should remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia in patients with COPD 
as the clinical features of such infections overlap with the symptoms of COPD exacerbations. 
Risk factors for pneumonia in patients with COPD include current smoking, older age, low body mass 
index (BMI) and severe COPD. 
Pneumonia in patients with asthma 
The incidence of pneumonia in patients with asthma was common at the higher dose. The incidence of 
pneumonia in patients with asthma taking fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 184/22 micrograms was 
numerically higher compared with those receiving fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms or 
placebo (see section 4.8). No risk factors were identified.

Excipients 
This medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose 
intolerance, the total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not use this 
medicinal product. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Clinically significant drug interactions mediated by fluticasone furoate/vilanterol at clinical doses are 
considered unlikely due to the low plasma concentrations achieved after inhaled dosing. 
Interaction with beta-blockers 
Beta2-adrenergic blockers may weaken or antagonise the effect of beta2-adrenergic agonists. 
Concurrent use of both non-selective and selective beta2-adrenergic blockers should be avoided unless 
there are compelling reasons for their use. 
Interaction with CYP3A4 inhibitors 
Fluticasone furoate and vilanterol are both rapidly cleared by extensive first pass metabolism mediated 
by the liver enzyme CYP3A4.  
Caution is advised when co-administering with strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, 
ritonavir, cobicistat-containing products) as there is potential for increased systemic exposure to both 
fluticasone furoate and vilanterol. Co-administration should be avoided unless the benefit outweighs 
the increased risk of systemic corticosteroid undesirable effects, in which case patients should be 
monitored for systemic corticosteroid undesirable effects. A repeat dose CYP3A4 drug interaction 
study was performed in healthy subjects with the fluticasone furoate/vilanterol combination 
(184/22 micrograms) and the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg). Co-administration 
increased mean fluticasone furoate AUC(0-24) and Cmax by 36% and 33%, respectively. The increase in 
fluticasone furoate exposure was associated with a 27% reduction in 0-24 hours weighted mean serum 
cortisol. Co-administration increased mean vilanterol AUC(0-t) and Cmax 65% and 22%, 
respectively. The increase in vilanterol exposure was not associated with an increase in beta2-agonist 
related systemic effects on heart rate, blood potassium or QTcF interval.  
Interaction with P-glycoprotein inhibitors 
Fluticasone furoate and vilanterol are both substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). A clinical 
pharmacology study in healthy subjects with co-administered vilanterol and the potent P-gp and 
moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor verapamil did not show any significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of 
vilanterol. Clinical pharmacology studies with a specific P-gp inhibitor and fluticasone furoate have 
not been conducted. 
Sympathomimetic medicinal products 
Concomitant administration of other sympathomimetic medicinal products (alone or as part of 
combination therapy) may potentiate the adverse reactions of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol. Revinty 
Ellipta should not be used in conjunction with other long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists or medicinal 
products containing long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity at exposures which are not clinically relevant (see 
section 5.3). There are no or limited data from the use of fluticasone furoate and vilanterol trifenatate 
in pregnant women. 
Administration of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol to pregnant women should only be considered if the 
expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
There is insufficient information on the excretion of fluticasone furoate or vilanterol trifenatate and/or 
metabolites in human milk. However, other corticosteroids and beta2-agonists are detected in human 
milk (see section 5.3). A risk to breastfed newborns/infants cannot be excluded. 
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue fluticasone 
furoate/vilanterol therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit 
of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
There are no fertility data in humans. Animal studies showed no effect of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 
trifenatate on fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Fluticasone furoate or vilanterol has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use 
machines.  
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
Data from large asthma and COPD clinical trials were used to determine the frequency of adverse 
reactions associated with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol. In the asthma clinical development programme 
a total of 7,034 patients were included in an integrated assessment of adverse reactions. In the COPD 
clinical development programme a total of 6,237 subjects were included in an integrated assessment of 
adverse reactions. 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions with fluticasone furoate and vilanterol were headache 
and nasopharyngitis. With the exception of pneumonia and fractures, the safety profile was similar in 
patients with asthma and COPD. During clinical studies, pneumonia and fractures were more 
frequently observed in patients with COPD.  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions are listed by system organ class and frequency. The following convention has been 
used for the classification of frequencies: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); 
uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000).Within each 
frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
*Pneumonia (see section 4.4) 
In an integrated analysis of the two replicate one year studies in moderate to severe COPD (mean 
predicted post-bronchodilator screening FEV1 of 45%, standard deviation (SD) 13%) with an 
exacerbation in the preceding year (n = 3255), the number of pneumonia events per 1000 patient years 
was 97.9 with FF/VI 184/22 micrograms, 85.7 in the FF/VI 92/22 micrograms and 42.3 in the VI 22 
micrograms group. For severe pneumonia the corresponding number of events per 1000 patient years 
were 33.6, 35.5, and 7.6 respectively, while for serious pneumonia the corresponding events per 1000 
patient years were 35.1 for FF/VI 184/22 micrograms, 42.9 with FF/VI 92/22 micrograms, 12.1 with 
VI 22 micrograms. Finally, the exposure-adjusted cases of fatal pneumonia were 8.8 for FF/VI 184/22 
micrograms versus 1.5 for FF/VI 92/22 micrograms and 0 for VI 22 micrograms.  
In a placebo-controlled study (SUMMIT) in subjects with moderate COPD (mean percent post-
bronchodilator screening FEV1 of 60%, SD 6%), and a history of, or an increased risk of 
cardiovascular disease, the incidence of pneumonia with FF/VI, FF, VI and placebo was: adverse 
events (6%, 5%, 4%, 5%); serious adverse events (3%, 4%, 3%, 3%); adjudicated on treatment deaths 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
due to pneumonia (0.3%, 0.2%, 0.1%, 0.2%); the exposure adjusted rates (per 1000 treatment years) 
were: adverse events (39.5, 42.4, 27.7, 38.4); serious adverse events (22.4, 25.1, 16.4, 22.2); 
adjudicated on-treatment deaths due to pneumonia (1.8, 1.5, 0.9, 1.4) respectively. 
In an integrated analysis of 11 studies in asthma (7,034 patients), the incidence of pneumonia per 1000 
patient years was 18.4 for FF/VI 184/22 micrograms versus 9.6 for FF/VI 92/22 micrograms and 8.0 
in the placebo group. 
**Fractures 
In two replicate 12 month studies in a total of 3,255 patients with COPD the incidence of bone 
fractures overall was low in all treatment groups, with a higher incidence in all Revinty Ellipta groups 
(2%) compared with the vilanterol 22 micrograms group (<1%). Although there were more fractures 
in the Revinty Ellipta groups compared with the vilanterol 22 micrograms group, fractures typically 
associated with corticosteroid use (e.g., spinal compression/thoracolumbar vertebral fractures, hip and 
acetabular fractures) occurred in <1% of the Revinty Ellipta and vilanterol treatment arms. 
For the SUMMIT study, the incidence of all events of fracture with FF/VI, FF, VI and placebo were 
2% in each arm; fractures commonly associated with ICS use were less than 1 % in each arm. The 
exposure-adjusted rates (per 1000 treatment years) for all fracture events were 13.6, 12.8, 13.2, 11.5 
respectively; fractures commonly associated with ICS use were 3.4, 3.9, 2.4, 2.1 respectively. 
In an integrated analysis of 11 studies in asthma (7,034 patients), the incidence of fractures was <1%, 
and usually associated with trauma. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms and signs  
An overdose of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol may produce signs and symptoms due to the individual 
component’s actions, including those seen with overdose of other beta2-agonists and consistent with 
the known inhaled corticosteroid class effects (see section 4.4). 
Treatment  
There is no specific treatment for an overdose with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol. If overdose occurs, 
the patient should be treated supportively with appropriate monitoring as necessary.  
Cardioselective beta-blockade should only be considered for profound vilanterol overdose effects that 
are clinically concerning and unresponsive to supportive measures. Cardioselective beta-blocking 
medicinal products should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchospasm. 
Further management should be as clinically indicated or as recommended by the national poisons 
centre, where available.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for obstructive airways diseases, adrenergics in combination with 
corticosteroids or other drugs, excl. anticholinergics, ATC code: R03AK10. 
Mechanism of action 
Fluticasone furoate and vilanterol represent two classes of medications (a synthetic corticosteroid and 
a selective, long-acting beta2-receptor agonist). 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Fluticasone furoate 
Fluticasone furoate is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with potent anti-inflammatory activity. 
The precise mechanism through which fluticasone furoate affects asthma and COPD symptoms is not 
known. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of actions on multiple cell types (e.g. 
eosinophils, macrophages, lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g. cytokines and chemokines involved in 
inflammation). 
Vilanterol trifenatate 
Vilanterol trifenatate is a selective long-acting, beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA).  
The pharmacologic effects of beta2-adrenoceptor agonist active substance, including vilanterol 
trifenatate, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenylate cyclase, the enzyme 
that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3’,5’-adenosine 
monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth 
muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from 
mast cells. 
Molecular interactions occur between corticosteroids and LABAs, whereby steroids activate the beta2-
receptor gene, increasing receptor number and sensitivity and LABAs prime the glucocorticoid 
receptor for steroid-dependent activation and enhance cell nuclear translocation. These synergistic 
interactions are reflected in enhanced anti-inflammatory activity, which has been demonstrated in vitro 
and in vivo in a range of inflammatory cells relevant to the pathophysiology of both asthma and 
COPD. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells from subjects with COPD, a larger anti-inflammatory 
effect was seen in the presence of the combination of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol compared with 
fluticasone furoate alone at concentrations achieved with clinical doses. The enhanced anti-
inflammatory effect of the LABA component was similar to that obtained with other ICS/LABA 
combinations. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Asthma 
Three phase III randomised, double-blind studies (HZA106827, HZA106829 and HZA106837) of 
different durations evaluated the safety and efficacy of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol in adult and 
adolescent patients with persistent asthma. All subjects were using an ICS (Inhaled corticosteroid) 
with or without LABA for at least 12 weeks prior to visit 1. In HZA106837 all patients had at least 
one exacerbation that required treatment with oral corticosteroids in the year prior to visit 1. 
HZA106827 was 12 weeks in duration and evaluated the efficacy of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 
92/22 micrograms [n=201] and FF 92 micrograms [n=205]) compared with placebo [n=203], all 
administered once daily. HZA106829 was 24 weeks in duration and evaluated the efficacy of

fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 184/22 micrograms [n=197] and FF 184 micrograms [n=194]) both 
administered once daily compared with FP 500 micrograms twice daily [n=195].  
In HZA106827/HZA106829 the co-primary efficacy endpoints were change from baseline in clinic 
visit trough (pre-bronchodilator and pre-dose) FEV1 at the end of the treatment period in all subjects 
and weighted mean serial FEV1 over 0-24 hours post-dose calculated in a subset of subjects at the end 
of the treatment period. Change from baseline in the percentage of rescue-free 24 hour periods during 
treatment was a powered secondary endpoint. Results for the primary and key secondary endpoints in 
these studies are described in Table 1.

HZA106837 was of variable treatment duration (from a minimum of 24 weeks to a maximum of 76 
weeks with the majority of patients treated for at least 52 weeks). In HZA106837 patients were 
randomised to receive either fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms [n=1009] or FF 
92 micrograms [n=1010] both administered once daily. In HZA106837 the primary endpoint was the 
time to first severe asthma exacerbation. A severe asthma exacerbation was defined as deterioration of 
asthma requiring the use of systemic corticosteroids for at least 3 days or an inpatient hospitalization 
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
or emergency department visit due to asthma that required systemic corticosteroids. Adjusted mean 
change from baseline in trough FEV1 was also evaluated as a secondary endpoint. 
In HZA106837 the risk of experiencing a severe asthma exacerbation in patients receiving fluticasone 
furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms was reduced by 20% compared with FF 92 micrograms alone 
(hazard ratio 0.795, p=0.036 95% CI 0.642, 0.985). The rate of severe asthma exacerbations per 
patient per year was 0.19 in the FF 92 micrograms group (approximately 1 in every 5 years) and 0.14 
in the fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms group (approximately 1 in every 7 years). The 
ratio of the exacerbation rate for fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms versus FF 92 
micrograms was 0.755 (95% CI 0.603, 0.945). This represents a 25% reduction in the rate of severe 
asthma exacerbations for subjects treated with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms 
compared with FF 92 (p=0.014). The 24-hour bronchodilator effect of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 
was maintained throughout a one-year treatment period with no evidence of loss in efficacy (no 
tachyphylaxis). Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92 /22 micrograms consistently demonstrated 83 mL to 
95 mL improvements in trough FEV1 at weeks 12, 36 and 52 and Endpoint compared with FF 
92 micrograms (p<0.001 95% CI 52, 126 mL at Endpoint). Forty four percent of patients in the 
fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms group were well controlled (ACQ7 ≤0.75) at end of 
treatment compared to 36% of subjects in the FF 92 micrograms group (p<0.001 95% CI 1.23, 1.82). 
Studies versus salmeterol/fluticasone propionate combinations 
In a 24 week study (HZA113091) in adult and adolescent patients with uncontrolled persistent asthma 
both fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms given once daily in the evening and 
salmeterol/FP 50/250 micrograms given twice daily demonstrated improvements from baseline in lung 
function. Adjusted mean treatment increases from baseline in weighted mean 0-24 hours FEV1 of 
341 mL (fluticasone furoate/vilanterol) and 377 mL (salmeterol/FP) demonstrated an overall 
improvement in lung function over 24 hours for both treatments. The adjusted mean treatment 
difference of -37 mL between the groups was not statistically significant (p=0.162). For trough FEV1 
subjects in the fluticasone furoate/vilanterol group achieved a LS mean change from baseline of 
281 mL and subjects in the salmeterol/FP group a change of 300 mL; (the difference in adjusted mean 
of -19 mL (95%CI:-0.073, 0.034) was not statistically significant (p=0.485). 
A randomised, double-blind, parallel group, 24 week study (201378) was conducted to demonstrate 
non-inferiority (using a margin of -100 mL for trough FEV1) of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 
micrograms once daily to salmeterol/FP 50/250 micrograms twice daily in adults and adolescents 
whose asthma was well controlled following 4 weeks of treatment with open-label salmeterol/FP 
50/250 micrograms twice daily (N=1504). Subjects randomised to once-daily FF/VI maintained lung 
function comparable with those randomised to twice-daily salmeterol/FP [difference in trough FEV1 of 
+19 mL (95% CI: -11, 49)]. 
No comparative studies versus salmeterol/FP or versus other ICS/LABA combinations have been 
conducted to appropriately compare the effects of asthma exacerbations. 
Fluticasone furoate monotherapy 
A 24 week randomised, double-blind placebo controlled study (FFA112059) evaluated the safety and 
efficacy of FF 92 micrograms once daily [n= 114] and FP 250 micrograms twice daily [n=114] versus 
placebo [n=115] in adult and adolescent patients with persistent asthma. All subjects had to have been 
on a stable dose of an ICS for at least 4 weeks prior to visit 1 (screening visit) and the use of LABAs 
was not permitted within 4 weeks of visit 1. The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline 
in clinic visit trough (pre-bronchodilator and pre-dose) FEV1 at the end of the treatment period. 
Change from baseline in the percentage of rescue-free 24 hour periods during the 24-week treatment 
period was a powered secondary. At the 24-week time point FF and FP increased trough FEV1 by 
146 mL (95% CI 36, 257 mL, p=0.009) and 145 mL (95% CI 33, 257 mL, p=0.011) respectively 
compared to placebo. FF and FP both increased the percentage of 24 hour rescue free periods by 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
14.8% (95% CI 6.9, 22.7, p<0.001) and 17.9% (95% CI 10.0, 25.7, p<0.001) respectively versus 
placebo.  
Allergen challenge study 
The bronchoprotective effect of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms on the early and late 
asthmatic response to inhaled allergen was evaluated in a repeat dose, placebo-controlled four-way 
crossover study (HZA113126) in patients with mild asthma. Patients were randomized to receive 
fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms, FF 92 micrograms, vilanterol 22 micrograms or 
placebo once daily for 21 days followed by challenge with allergen 1 hour after the final dose. The 
allergen was house dust mite, cat dander, or birch pollen; the selection was based on individual 
screening tests. Serial FEV1 measurements were compared with pre-allergen challenge values taken 
after saline inhalation (baseline). Overall, the greatest effects on the early asthmatic response were 
seen with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms compared with FF 92 micrograms or 
vilanterol 22 micrograms alone. Both fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms and FF 
92 micrograms virtually abolished the late asthmatic response compared with vilanterol alone. 
Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms provided significantly greater protection against 
allergen-induced bronchial hyper-reactivity compared with monotherapies FF and vilanterol as 
assessed on Day 22 by methacholine challenge. 
Bronchoprotective and HPA-axis effects study 
The bronchoprotective and HPA-axis effects of FF versus FP or budesonide (BUD) were evaluated in 
an escalating repeat-dose, placebo-controlled, crossover study (203162) in 54 adults with a history of 
asthma, characterised by airway hyperresponsiveness and FEV1 ≥65% predicted. Patients were 
randomised to one or two treatment periods, comprising five 7-day dose-escalation phases of FF (25, 
100, 200, 400, 800 micrograms/day), FP (50, 200, 500, 1,000, 2,000 micrograms/day), BUD (100, 
400, 800, 1,600, 3,200 micrograms/day), or placebo. After each dose-escalation phase, 
bronchoprotection via airway hyperresponsiveness to adenosine-5'-monophosphate (AMP) challenge 
(provocative concentration causing ≥20% decline in FEV1 [AMP PC20]) and 24-hour weighted mean 
plasma cortisol were assessed. 
Across the approved therapeutic dose ranges for asthma the AMP PC20 (mg/mL) and cortisol 
suppression (%) values were: 81 to 116 mg/mL and 7% to 14% for FF (100 to 200 micrograms/day), 
20 to 76 mg/mL and 7% to 50% for FP (200 to 2,000 micrograms/day), and 24 to 54 mg/mL and 13% 
to 44% for BUD (400 to 1,600 micrograms/day), respectively.  
Paediatric population 
Asthma 
The efficacy and safety of fluticasone furoate (FF)/vilanterol (VI) administered once daily compared 
to FF administered once daily in the treatment of asthma in paediatric patients aged 5-11 years was 
evaluated in a randomised, double-blind, multicentre clinical trial of 24 weeks duration and 1-week 
follow-up period (HZA107116) involving 673 patients with uncontrolled asthma, on inhaled 
corticosteroids. 
All subjects had stable asthma therapy [short-acting beta agonist or short-acting muscarinic antagonist 
inhaler plus inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)] for at least 4 weeks prior to Visit 1. Patients were 
symptomatic (i.e., remained uncontrolled) on their existing asthma treatment.  
Subjects were treated with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 46/22 micrograms (337 patients) or 
fluticasone furoate 46 micrograms (336 patients). Two patients, one in each arm, were not assessable 
for efficacy. 
The primary endpoint was change from baseline, averaged over weeks 1 to 12 of the treatment period, 
in pre-dose (i.e., trough) morning peak expiratory flow (PEF), captured daily via electronic patient 
diary (difference between FF/VI combination and FF). Change from baseline in the percentage of 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
rescue-free 24-hour periods over weeks 1 to 12 of the treatment period was a powered secondary 
endpoint for the 5-11 years population. There were no differences in efficacy between FF/VI 
46/22 micrograms and FF 46 micrograms (Table 2). No new safety concerns were identified during 
this study.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
The absolute bioavailability for fluticasone furoate and vilanterol when administered by inhalation as 
fluticasone furoate/vilanterol was on average 15.2% and 27.3%, respectively. The oral bioavailability 
of both fluticasone furoate and vilanterol was low, on average 1.26% and <2%, respectively. Given 
this low oral bioavailability, systemic exposure for fluticasone furoate and vilanterol following inhaled 
administration is primarily due to absorption of the inhaled portion of the dose delivered to the lung. 
Distribution 
Following intravenous dosing, both fluticasone furoate and vilanterol are extensively distributed with 
average volumes of distribution at steady state of 661 L and 165 L, respectively. 
Both fluticasone furoate and vilanterol have a low association with red blood cells. In vitro plasma 
protein binding in human plasma of fluticasone furoate and vilanterol was high, on average >99.6% 
and 93.9%, respectively. There was no decrease in the extent of in vitro plasma protein binding in 
subjects with renal or hepatic impairment. 
Fluticasone furoate and vilanterol are substrates for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), however, concomitant 
administration of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol with P-gp inhibitors is considered unlikely to alter 
fluticasone furoate or vilanterol systemic exposure since they are both well absorbed molecules. 
Biotransformation 
Based on in vitro data, the major routes of metabolism of both fluticasone furoate and vilanterol in 
human are mediated primarily by CYP3A4. 
Fluticasone furoate is primarily metabolised through hydrolysis of the S-fluoromethyl carbothioate 
group to metabolites with significantly reduced corticosteroid activity. Vilanterol is primarily 
metabolised by O-dealkylation to a range of metabolites with significantly reduced β1- and β2-agonist 
activity. 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elimination 
Following oral administration, fluticasone furoate was eliminated in humans mainly by metabolism 
with metabolites being excreted almost exclusively in faeces, with <1% of the recovered radioactive 
dose eliminated in the urine. 
Following oral administration, vilanterol was eliminated mainly by metabolism followed by excretion 
of metabolites in urine and faeces approximately 70% and 30% of the radioactive dose respectively in 
a human radiolabel study conducted by the oral route. The apparent plasma elimination half-life of 
vilanterol following single inhaled administration of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol was, on average, 
2.5 hours. The effective half-life for accumulation of vilanterol, as determined from inhalation 
administration of repeat doses of vilanterol 25 micrograms, is 16.0 hours in subjects with asthma and 
21.3 hours in subjects with COPD. 
Paediatric population  
In adolescents (12 years or older), there are no recommended dose modifications. 
The pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol have been studied in 
children from 5 to 11 years old, but no recommendation on a posology can be made (see section 4.2). 
The pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol in children under the age of 
5 years have not been established.  
Special populations  
Elderly 
The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of fluticasone furoate and vilanterol were determined in 
phase III studies in COPD and asthma. There was no evidence for age (12 to 84 years) to affect the 
pharmacokinetics of fluticasone furoate and vilanterol in subjects with asthma. 
In elderly subjects with asthma and elderly subjects with COPD there are no recommended dose 
modifications. 
Renal impairment  
A clinical pharmacology study of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol showed that severe renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) did not result in significantly greater exposure to fluticasone 
furoate or vilanterol or more marked corticosteroid or beta2-agonist systemic effects compared with 
healthy subjects.  
No dose adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment. 
The effects of haemodialysis have not been studied. 
Hepatic impairment 
Following repeat dosing of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol for 7 days, there was an increase in 
fluticasone furoate systemic exposure (up to three-fold as measured by AUC(0–24)) in subjects with 
hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A, B or C) compared with healthy subjects. The increase in 
fluticasone furoate systemic exposure in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B; 
fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 184/22 micrograms) was associated with an average 34% reduction in 
serum cortisol compared with healthy subjects. Dose-normalised fluticasone furoate systemic 
exposure was similar in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C). 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Following repeat dosing of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol for 7 days, there was no significant increase 
in systemic exposure to vilanterol (Cmax and AUC) in subjects with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh A, B or C). 
There were no clinically relevant effects of the fluticasone furoate/vilanterol combination on beta-
adrenergic systemic effects (heart rate or serum potassium) in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic 
impairment (vilanterol, 22 micrograms) or with severe hepatic impairment (vilanterol, 
12.5 micrograms) compared with healthy subjects. 
Other special populations  
In subjects with asthma, estimates of fluticasone furoate AUC(0-24) for East Asian, Japanese and South 
East Asian subjects (12-13% of subjects) were on average 33% to 53% higher compared with other 
racial groups. However, there was no evidence for the higher systemic exposure in this population to 
be associated with greater effect on 24 hour urinary cortisol excretion. On average, vilanterol Cmax is 
predicted to be 220 to 287% higher and AUC(0-24) comparable for those subjects from an Asian 
heritage compared with subjects from other racial groups. However, there was no evidence that this 
higher vilanterol Cmax resulted in clinically significant effects on heart rate. 
Gender, weight and BMI  
There was no evidence for gender, weight or BMI (body mass index) to influence the 
pharmacokinetics of fluticasone furoate based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of phase III 
data in 1213 subjects with asthma (712 females).  
There was no evidence for gender, weight or BMI to influence the pharmacokinetics of vilanterol 
based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 856 subjects with asthma (500 females). 
No dosage adjustment is necessary based on gender, weight or BMI. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Pharmacological and toxicological effects seen with fluticasone furoate or vilanterol in non-clinical 
studies were those typically associated with either glucocorticoids or beta2-agonists. Administration of 
fluticasone furoate combined with vilanterol did not result in any significant new toxicity. 
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
Fluticasone furoate 
Fluticasone furoate was not genotoxic in a standard battery of studies and was not carcinogenic in 
lifetime inhalation studies in rats or mice at exposures similar to those at the maximum recommended 
human dose, based on AUC.  
Vilanterol trifenatate 
In genetic toxicity studies, vilanterol (as alpha-phenylcinnamate) and triphenylacetic acid were not 
genotoxic indicating that vilanterol (as trifenatate) does not represent a genotoxic hazard to humans.  
Consistent with findings for other beta2 agonists, in lifetime inhalation studies vilanterol trifenatate 
caused proliferative effects in the female rat and mouse reproductive tract and rat pituitary gland. 
There was no increase in tumour incidence in rats or mice at exposures 1.2- or 30-fold, respectively, 
those at the maximum recommended human dose, based on AUC. 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Toxicity to reproduction and development  
Fluticasone furoate 
Effects seen following inhalation administration of fluticasone furoate in combination with vilanterol 
in rats were similar to those seen with fluticasone furoate alone.  
Fluticasone furoate was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits, but delayed development in rats and caused 
abortion in rabbits at maternally toxic doses. There were no effects on development in rats at 
exposures approximately 3-times greater than those at the maximum recommended human dose, based 
on AUC. 
Vilanterol trifenatate 
Vilanterol trifenatate was not teratogenic in rats. In inhalation studies in rabbits, vilanterol trifenatate 
caused effects similar to those seen with other beta2 agonists (cleft palate, open eyelids, sternebral 
fusion and limb flexure/malrotation). When given subcutaneously there were no effects at exposures 
84-times greater than those at the maximum recommended human dose, based on AUC. 
Neither fluticasone furoate nor vilanterol trifenatate had any adverse effects on fertility or pre- and 
post-natal development in rats.

Step-by-step instructions for use 
1.  What Revinty Ellipta is and what it is used for  
Revinty Ellipta contains two active substances: fluticasone furoate and vilanterol. Two different 
strengths of Revinty Ellipta are available: fluticasone furoate 92 micrograms/vilanterol 22 micrograms 
and fluticasone furoate 184 micrograms/vilanterol 22 micrograms.  
The 92/22 micrograms strength is used for the regular treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) in adults, and asthma in adults and adolescents 12 years and over.  
The 184/22 micrograms strength is used to treat asthma in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and 
older. The 184/22 micrograms strength is not approved for the treatment of COPD. 
Revinty Ellipta should be used every day and not only when you have breathing problems or 
other symptoms of COPD and asthma. It should not be used to relieve a sudden attack of 
breathlessness or wheezing. If you get this sort of attack you must use a quick-acting inhaler (such as 
salbutamol). If you do not have a quick-acting inhaler contact your doctor. 
Fluticasone furoate belongs to a group of medicines called corticosteroids, often simply called 
steroids. Corticosteroids reduce inflammation. They reduce the swelling and irritation in the small air 
passages in the lungs and so gradually ease breathing problems. Corticosteroids also help to prevent 
attacks of asthma and aggravation of COPD. 
Vilanterol belongs to a group of medicines called long acting bronchodilators. It relaxes the muscles of 
the small air passages in the lungs. This helps to open the airways and makes it easier for air to get in 
and out of the lungs. When it is taken regularly, it helps the small air passages to remain open. 
When you take these two active substances together regularly, they will help to control your breathing 
difficulties more than either medicine alone. 
67 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Asthma is a serious, long term lung disease where the muscles surrounding the smaller airways 
become tight (bronchoconstriction) and swollen and irritated (inflammation). Symptoms come and go 
and include shortness of breath, wheezing, chest tightness and cough. Revinty Ellipta has been shown 
to reduce flare-ups and symptoms of asthma.  
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a serious, long term lung disease where the 
airways become inflamed and thickened. Symptoms include shortness of breath, cough, chest 
discomfort and coughing up mucus. Revinty Ellipta has been shown to reduce flare-ups of COPD 
symptoms. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Revinty Ellipta  
Do not use Revinty Ellipta  
- if you are allergic to fluticasone furoate, vilanterol or any other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
- if you think the above applies to you, do not use Revinty Ellipta until you have checked with your 
doctor. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using Revinty Ellipta: 
-if you have liver disease, as you may be more likely to have side effects. If you have moderate or 
severe liver disease, your doctor will limit your dose to the lower strength of Revinty Ellipta 
(92/22 micrograms once daily). 
-if you have heart problems or high blood pressure. 
-if you have tuberculosis (TB) of the lung, or any long standing or untreated infections. 
-if you have ever been told you have diabetes or high blood sugar. 
-if you have thyroid gland problems. 
-if you have low potassium in your blood. 
-if you experience blurred vision or other visual disturbances.

3.  How to use Revinty Ellipta  
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or 
pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Asthma 
The recommended dose to treat asthma is one inhalation (92 micrograms of fluticasone furoate and 
22 micrograms of vilanterol) once daily at the same time each day. 
If you have severe asthma, your doctor may decide that you should use one inhalation of the higher 
strength inhaler (184 micrograms fluticasone furoate and 22 micrograms of vilanterol). This dose is 
also used once daily at the same time each day. 
COPD 
The recommended dose to treat COPD is one inhalation (92 micrograms of fluticasone furoate and 
22 micrograms of vilanterol) once daily at the same time each day. 
The higher strength of Revinty Ellipta (184 micrograms fluticasone furoate and 22 micrograms of 
vilanterol) is not suitable for the treatment of COPD. 
Revinty Ellipta is for oral inhalation. 
69 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Use Revinty Ellipta at the same time each day as it is effective over 24 hours  
It is very important that you use this medicine every day, as instructed by your doctor. This will help 
to keep you free of symptoms throughout the day and night. 
Revinty Ellipta should not be used to relieve a sudden attack of breathlessness or wheezing. If 
you get this sort of attack you must use a quick-acting inhaler (such as salbutamol). 
If you feel you are getting breathless or wheezy more often than normal, or if you are using your 
quick-acting inhaler more than usual, see your doctor. 
How to use Revinty Ellipta  
See ‘Step-by-step instructions for use’ after section 6 of this leaflet for full information. 
Revinty Ellipta is for oral inhalation. You do not need to prepare Revinty Ellipta in any special way, 
not even the first time you use it. 
If your symptoms do not improve 
If your symptoms (breathlessness, wheezing, cough) do not improve or get worse, or if you are using 
your quick-acting inhaler more often:  
  contact your doctor as soon as possible. 
If you use more Revinty Ellipta than you should  
If you accidentally use more Revinty Ellipta than your doctor has instructed, talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist. If possible, show them the inhaler, the package or this leaflet. You may notice that your 
heart is beating faster than usual, you feel shaky or have a headache.  
If you have used more than instructed for a long period of time, it is particularly important that 
you ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice. This is because larger doses of Revinty Ellipta may 
reduce the amount of steroid hormones produced naturally by your body.  
If you forget to use Revinty Ellipta  
Do not inhale a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Just take your next dose at the usual 
time. 
If you become wheezy or breathless, or develop any other symptoms of an asthma attack, use your 
quick-acting inhaler (e.g. salbutamol), then seek medical advice.  
Do not stop using Revinty Ellipta without advice  
Use this medicine for as long as your doctor recommends. It will only be effective as long as you are 
using it. Do not stop unless your doctor advises you to, even if you feel better. 
If you have further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

The first time you use Revinty Ellipta you do not need to check that it is working properly, and you do 
not need to prepare it for use in any special way. Just follow these step-by-step instructions.

The inhaler is packaged in a tray. Do not open the tray until you are ready to start using your 
medicine. When you are ready to use your inhaler, peel back the lid to open the tray. The tray contains 
a desiccant sachet, to reduce moisture. Throw this desiccant sachet away – do not open, eat or inhale 
it.

When you take the inhaler out of its tray, it will be in the ‘closed’ position. Do not open the inhaler 
until you are ready to inhale a dose of medicine. When the tray is opened, write the “Discard by” 
date on the inhaler label in the space provided. The “Discard by” date is 6 weeks from the date you 
opened the tray. After this date the inhaler should no longer be used. The tray can be discarded 
after first opening. 
If stored in a refrigerator, allow the inhaler to return to room temperature for at least one hour before 
use. 
The step-by-step instructions shown below for the 30-dose Ellipta inhaler (30 day supply) also apply 
to the 14-dose Ellipta inhaler (14 day supply). 
1. 
Read this before you start  
If you open and close the cover without inhaling the medicine, you will lose the dose.  
The lost dose will be securely held inside the inhaler, but it will no longer be available. 
It is not possible to accidentally take extra medicine or a double dose in one inhalation. 
2. 
Prepare a dose  
  Wait to open the cover until you are ready to inhale your dose. Do not shake the inhaler. 
Slide the cover down until you hear a “click”. 
Your medicine is now ready to be inhaled.

The dose counter counts down by 1 to confirm. 
• If the dose counter does not count down as you hear the “click”, the inhaler will not deliver 
medicine. Take it back to your pharmacist for advice. 
3. 
Inhale your medicine 
• While holding the inhaler away from your mouth, breathe out as far as is comfortable.  
Do not breathe out into the inhaler. 
• Put the mouthpiece between your lips, and close your lips firmly around it. 
Do not block the air vent with your fingers. 
Your lips fit over the 
contoured shape of 
the mouthpiece for  
inhaling. 
Do not block the air vent with 
your fingers. 
• Take one long, steady, deep breath in. Hold this breath for as long as possible (at least 
3-4 seconds). 
• Remove the inhaler from your mouth. 
• Breathe out slowly and gently. 
You may not be able to taste or feel the medicine, even when you are using the inhaler correctly. 
If you want to clean the mouthpiece, use a dry tissue, before you close the cover. 
4. 
Close the inhaler and rinse your mouth  
• Slide the cover upwards as far as it will go, to cover the mouthpiece.

•  Rinse your mouth with water after you have used the inhaler, do not swallow.  
  This will make it less likely that you will develop a sore mouth or throat as side effects.

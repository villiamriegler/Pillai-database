o  To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of a single intravenous infusion (IV) infusion dose 
of dalbavancin. The primary endpoint was the plasma concentration of dalbavancin.  
Secondary objective 
o  PK parameters, including: maximum plasma drug concentration (Cmax), time of Cmax (Tmax), 
area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time 0 to t and 0 to infinity 
(AUC0-t and AUC0-inf), clearance (CL), volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss) and terminal 
elimination half-life (t1/2). 
o  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single dalbavancin IV infusion. Safety assessments 
included adverse events (AE), audiology testing, clinical laboratory values, vital signs 
(including weight and temperature) and physical examination findings. 
Study design 
This study was a multiple-centre, randomised, open-label, single-dose study in paediatric participants 
with known or suspected bacterial infection. No more than 20% of these evaluable participants were to 
have urinary tract infections due to Gram-positive organisms. Participants received a single 
intravenous infusion dose of 22.5 mg/kg over 30 minutes on Day 1. 
Study population /Sample size 
A total of 22 participants were planned in three cohorts: 6 participants in Cohort 1, and 8 participants 
each in Cohorts 2 and 3. Eight participants were enrolled (6 in Cohort 1 and 1 each in Cohorts 2 and 3) 
and included in both the PK and Safety analysis populations.  
o  Cohort 1: young infants aged > 28 days to < 3 months 
o  Cohort 2: term neonates (defined as gestational age ≥37 weeks) aged ≤ 28 days 
o  Cohort 3: preterm neonates (defined as gestational age ≥ 32 to <37 weeks) aged ≤ 28 days 
Main criteria for eligibility 
Male and female participants who are preterm neonates (gestational age ≥ 32 to < 37 weeks, aged ≤ 
28 days), term neonates (gestational age ≥ 37 weeks, aged ≤ 28 days) or young infants (aged 28 
days to < 3 months) who were receiving at least 24 hours of appropriate non-investigational 
intravenous anti-infective treatment other than glycopeptide antibiotics for known or suspected 
bacterial infections. 
Treatments 
All participants in each cohort were administered a single IV dose of 22.5 mg/kg dalbavancin only 
(Xydalba 500 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion), in a 30 minute (± 5 minutes) 
(including flushing to ensure that all of the investigational product [IP] has been administered) on Day 
1 via peripheral or central infusion line; this treatment with IP was to be in addition to background 
anti-infective treatment to be chosen by the investigator according to standard of care, except for the 
excluded medications vancomycin or other glycopeptide antibiotics. Dalbavancin was provided in 
single-use 50 mL vials containing 500 mg of dalbavancin. Each vial was reconstituted and further 
diluted prior to administration by addition of 5% dextrose (5% glucose) solution (D5W) in accordance 
with the Study Manual.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Pharmacokinetics 
Appropriate PK parameters were computed for dalbavancin using a model independent (non-
compartmental) approach with the software Pharsight Phoenix WinNonlin (version 8.0). Plasma 
concentration data for dalbavancin from this study will also be pooled with data from other studies in a 
population PK analysis that will be reported separately. PK parameters computed for dalbavancin using 
population PK analysis are not included in this clinical study report (CSR).  
Safety 
Safety measures included evaluation of AEs, audiology, clinical laboratory evaluations, vital signs 
(systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), pulse rate, body weight, respiration rate, and temperature), 
and physical examinations (abnormal findings were to be reported as AEs). 
Statistical Methods 
o  The safety population consisted of all participants who received the dose of the investigational 
product. All demographic and safety summaries were conducted using the safety population. 
o  The PK analysis population consisted of all participants who received the dose of IP and have at 
least one measurable plasma concentration. 
Pharmacokinetics  
Descriptive statistics (arithmetic mean, standard deviation, maximum, median, minimum, geometric 
mean, geometric mean CV%) were reported for plasma dalbavancin concentration data at all time-
points by Cohort and overall and were calculated for all PK parameters by Cohort using the PK 
population. 
Safety  
Safety parameters, including AEs (including abnormal findings on physical examination), clinical 
laboratory parameters, and vital sign parameters, were summarised using descriptive statistics 
(number and percentage of participants for categorical variables and mean, standard deviation, 
median, minimum, and maximum values for continuous variables). Audiology findings were 
summarised by cohort and in total for the Safety population using shift analyses and categorical and 
continuous descriptive statistics. All patients must have an audiologic assessment performed prior to 
dalbavancin dosing and at Day 28. If the event of abnormalities found at day 28 audiological testing 
must be repeated at the final study visit (3- and 6-months post dose or until they return to baseline).

Participant Disposition and Demographics 
A total of 8 participants were enrolled in the study and received investigational product: 6 participants 
in Cohort 1 (young infants aged > 28 days to < 3 months) and 1 participant each in Cohort 2 (term 
neonates [defined as gestational age ≥37 weeks] aged ≤ 28 days) and Cohort 3 (preterm neonates 
[defined as gestational age ≥ 32 to <37 weeks] aged ≤ 28 days). All 8 (100%) participants completed 
the study as planned and no participant prematurely discontinued from the study. The mean age was 
40.6 days (range: 6 to 65 days) across all 3 Cohorts with a gestational age of 36.1 weeks (range: 28 
to 41 weeks). Six participants were female and 2 were male. Seven participants were white, and 1 
participant was of multiple race. Overall participant weight (SD) and height (SD) was 3.49 (0.772) kg 
(range: 2.6 to 4.5 kg) and 51.06 (4.460) cm (range: 44.5 to 57.0 cm), respectively, with an overall 
BMI (SD) of 13.24 (1.371) kg/m2 (range: 11.2 to 14.6 kg/m2)

Pharmacokinetic results 
The safety and PK of dalbavancin have previously been established in adults at doses of up to 1500 
mg. Furthermore, the safety and PK of dalbavancin in paediatric population have been previously 
evaluated in children aged ≥ 3 months.  
For the present PK study (children aged <3 months), the dalbavancin dose was chosen based on the 
experience observed in children aged ≥ 3 months in Study DUR001-106 and Study A8841004, and the 
predicted exposure from a population PK model. The predicted exposure at a dose of 22.5 mg/kg was 
similar to that at a dose of 1500 mg in adults. 
All study participants of the present PK study have received a single intravenous infusion dose of 22.5 
mg/kg over 30 minutes on Day 1. Blood samples for the determination of plasma concentrations of 
dalbavancin were collected at the following times from all 8 participants: 
• Day 1: at the end of infusion (including the flushing) (+ 5 min) 
• Day 1: between 2 to 6 hours after start of infusion 
• Day 1: between 10 to 14 hours after start of infusion 
• Day 2: between 20 to 28 hours after start of infusion on Day 1 
• Day 7: between 96 to 192 hours (Days 5 to 9) after start of infusion on Day 1 
• Day 28: between 552 to 744 hours (Days 24 to 32) after start of infusion on Day 1 
Following a single dose of 22.5 mg/kg dalbavancin as a 30-minute IV infusion, Tmax occurred around 
the time of the end of the infusion, i.e. around 0.5 h. The mean (SD) Cmax for Cohort 1 (n = 6) was 
191.58 (39.96) μg/mL, and the Cmax values for the single participants enrolled in Cohorts 2 and 3 were 
250.85 and 198.66 μg/mL, respectively. t1/2 values for the single participants in Cohorts 2 and 3 were 
122.89 and 111.20 h, respectively, and were similar to the mean value for Cohort 1 (103.26 [9.14] h). 
The mean concentration for the Day 28 PK sample across cohorts was 0.973 (0.655) μg/mL, and 7 of 8 
participants had plasma concentrations exceeding 0.5 μg/mL at this time point. 
Mean CL for Cohort 1 was 7.74 (SD of 1.85) mL/h, and the CL values for the participants enrolled in 
Cohorts 2 and 3 were 5.04 and 5.77 mL/h, respectively. Mean AUC parameters (AUC0-t, AUC0-120, AUC0-
inf) for Cohort 1 were similar to the observed values in the single participants in Cohorts 2 and 3. The 
mean value of AUC0-120 was 6247.89 (1493.99) h*μg/mL for Cohort 1, 7758.40 h*μg/mL for the 
participant in Cohort 2, and 6512.44 h*μg/mL for the participant in Cohort 3.

Table 2. Individual Dalbavancin PK Parameters Following Single Dose Administration of 22.5 mg/kg 
Dalbavancin as a 30-minute Infusion to Paediatric Participants from Birth to 28 Days in Cohort 2 and 3. 
According to the MAH, while the average clearance of dalbavancin Cohort 1 (participants aged > 28 
days to < 3 months) was greater than the typical value of CL in adult patients, and AUC0-120 was lower 
in all cohorts than in adults receiving 1500 mg, drug exposures were still within the range where 
efficacy would be predicted based on nonclinical models. Furthermore, MAH stated that the PK data 
from this study will be combined with additional data from clinical studies of dalbavancin in paediatric 
patients (Studies A8841004, DUR001-106, DUR001-306) in a population PK analysis (to be reported 
separately). The updated population PK model will then be used to conduct PK/PD target attainment 
simulations to support dosing of dalbavancin in paediatric patients from birth to < 18 years.

Safety results 
Adverse events 
A total of 8 participants received dalbavancin 22.5 mg/kg (single IV infusion over 30 minutes) as per 
protocol in this study. 
Table 3. Overall Summary of Adverse Events (Safety Population) 
A majority of the treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mild or moderate in severity. The 
most commonly reported TEAEs were pyrexia (3 [37.5%] participants) and procedural pain (2 [25.0%] 
participants); all in Cohort 1. All other TEAEs in all cohorts were reported as single instances. In total, 
36 AEs were reported during the study; 35/36 were TEAEs. In 19/35, the event recovered/resolved 
during the study, and in 8/35 was recovering/resolving. For the remaining 8/35, the events were not 
recovered at the time of last report.

-A 30-day-old female (Cohort 1), experienced non-serious TEAE vomiting of moderate severity on Day 
1 (04 Nov 2016). The event resolved without sequelae on Day 2(05 Nov 2016). The event was 
assessed as treatment-related by the investigator.  
-A 35-day-old female (Cohort 1), experienced non-serious TEAE oral hairy leucoplakia of mild severity 
on Day 27 (12 Jun 2018). The event resolved without sequelae on Day 41 (26 Jun 2018). The event 
was assessed as treatment-related by the investigator. 
-A 44-day-old male (Cohort 1), experienced increased liver function test on Day 7 (27 Mar 2017). This 
TEAE is further described below at the section of laboratory results. 
Deaths and serious adverse events 
No deaths or discontinuations due to AEs were reported during the study.  
One participant (Cohort 1), a 9-week-old male born prematurely (gestational age of 29 weeks), 
experienced TESAEs (necrotising colitis and hydrocephalus). He received a single intravenous infusion 
of dalbavancin 65.3 mg over 30 minutes on Day 1 (20 Jan 2017) of the study. The participant had a 
history of critical illness (since 09 Jan 2017), and severe Group B Strep meningitis/ventriculitis (since 
13 Jan 2017), and ventriculomegaly (since 19 Jan 2017). He also had abnormal abdominal X-rays on 
16-17 Jan 2017 (details not provided), and a history of pneumatosis intestinalis on abdominal 
ultrasound (date not provided). Relevant concomitant medications included ampicillin and gentamicin. 
On Day 4 (23 Jan 2017), a chest X-ray performed to verify placement of a peripherally inserted central 
catheter showed portal venous gas as an incidental finding. A subsequent abdominal X-ray indicated 
pneumatosis intestinalis consistent with necrotising enterocolitis (reported as an TESAE of severe 
necrotising enterocolitis); these findings were assessed as not warranting surgical intervention. He was 
treated with metronidazole in addition to ampicillin and gentamicin. On Day 5 (24 Jan 2017), repeat X-
rays showed improvement. On Day 10 (29 Jan 2017), a repeat MRI scan showed worsening 
ventriculomegaly. On the same day, an extra-ventricular drain was placed without complication and 
the low opening pressure suggested ex vacuo hydrocephalus (reported as an TESAE of severe 
hydrocephalus) secondary to the participant's severe meningitis/ventriculitis. On Day 12 (31 Jan 
2017), feedings were restarted with no further issues related to the necrotising enterocolitis. On this 
date, the TESAE of necrotising enterocolitis resolved. This TESAE was deemed unrelated to IP as the 
participant had a history of pneumatosis intestinalis on abdominal ultrasound prior to IP 
administration. On Day 18 (06 Feb 2017), treatment with metronidazole was stopped. The TESAE of 
hydrocephalus was ongoing at the time of final report. This TESAE was assessed by the investigator as 
unrelated to IP as the participant had a history of ventriculomegaly and severe meningitis/ventriculitis. 
Laboratory results 
The following two subjects were reported with postbaseline potentially clinically significant (PCS) 
clinical laboratory values  
One participant (Cohort 1) experienced a PCS high result for platelet count (thrombocytes) (> 2 ×ULN 
and increase from baseline > 100%) during the interim study period. On Day -2 (screening; 18 Jan 
2017) he had a low platelet count of 64 × 109/L (Normal: 150 to 400). On Day 7 his platelet count had 
increased to 830 × 109/L before returning to normal on Day 26 with a count of 253 × 109/L. The 
participant also experienced a PCS low for RBC (< 0.8 × LLN and decrease from baseline > 20%) 
during the interim study period of 2.94 × 1012/L (Normal: 3.80 to 5.50) on Day 7. Low potassium 
value was also reported (< 0.8 × LLN and decrease from baseline > 15%) of 2.9 mmol/L (Normal: 4.0 
to 5.5) on Day 7. His potassium was below the LLN on Day 1 at 3.9 mmol/L before returning to normal

(4.4 mmol/L) at the EOS on Day 26. The abnormal platelet count, RBC and potassium values reported 
on 26 Jan 2017, were not reported as TEAEs. 
One participant (Cohort 1) experienced a PCS high result for ALT (>3.0 × ULN and increase from 
baseline > 300%) and direct bilirubin (>2.5 × ULN and increase from baseline > 150%) during the 
interim study period. The subject was a 7-week-old boy (full-term), with a medical history of 
pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum, ductal stent, opioid withdrawal, necrotising 
enterocolitis, stent occlusion, iliofemoral thrombosis and respiratory failure/mechanical ventilation. The 
patient was also on long-term total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Prior to dosing (20 Mar 2017 [Study 
Day –1]), the patient had an elevated conjugated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) as well as a 
mildly elevated ALT. On Day 7, ALT had increased further to 219 U/L, reaching a maximum value of 
252 U/L on Day 10, before returning to normal (28 U/L) on Day 28. His direct bilirubin at screening on 
Day -1 was elevated at 17.10 μmol/L (Normal 1.71 to 10.26). On Day 7 direct bilirubin had increased 
further to 39.34 μmol/L, reaching a maximum value of 53.02 μmol/L on Day 10, before returning to 
normal (3.42 μmol/L) on Day 28. The elevations of bilirubin and liver transaminases were reported as 
adverse event on Day 7; liver function test increased of mild severity and assessed as related to study 
treatment by the investigator. This was captured as a non-serious, mild adverse event of liver function 
test (LFT) increased. The LFT elevations were transient and without constellation of signs/symptoms 
suggesting liver impairment. No specific examinations were required, nor were therapeutic measures 
taken in response. There was an episode of fever requiring initiation of antibiotic therapy that started 
the day prior to the liver enzyme elevation, and hypovolaemia occurring on the day after (albumin 
human 5% in 20 mL was given on this day). The patient recovered, and his liver function normalised 
without sequelae; the adverse event of LFT increased was resolved on 17 Apr 2017 (Study Day 28). He 
was subsequently discharged home from hospital. Elevation in ALT is often seen in young infants, 
possibly due to rapid bone turnover and is rarely of clinical significance. This case was not considered 
as a Hy’s Law case since the patient had risk factors such as underlying congenital heart disease, 
concurrent abdominal pathology, long-term TPN use and in addition several concomitant medications 
such as piperacillin/tazobactam, oxycodone, propranolol, vancomycin that could explain the transient 
abnormal liver test results. 
Vital signs 
Mean changes from baseline to end of study, or from baseline to interim timepoints, were not 
considered to be clinically relevant for any of the measured vital signs parameters. 
Audiology  
Due to the age and underlying illness of participants in the study population, audiology testing was 
difficult to perform and interpret in the cohorts that were studied. To evaluate the audiology 
investigations such as response to noise, acoustic reflex and investigation of the auditory brainstem 
response. Furthermore, the ear canal was thoroughly investigated. At day 28, none of the eight 
paediatric subjects was reported with signs of ototoxicity due to dalbavancin. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The MAH has submitted the final report for PIP study 6 (DAL-PK-02) and this AR includes results 
obtained in the study. It is noted that the study was terminated and that this has been agreed with the 
PDCO. No dose proposal is included since the MAH will use PK data from both study 6 and 7 (ongoing) 
and thereafter propose a dose for this paediatric age group. It is noted that a type II variation 
including this data is planned to be submitted by December 2022.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/CHMP/428555/2020  
Page 11/13 
 
 
 
The included number of subjects included in this study is limited, mainly due to recruitment issues. The 
MAH has argued that the variability of PK of dalbavancin is low and that the ongoing PIP Study 7 is 
expected to provide additional PK data from up to 10 subjects below 3 months of age.  
Overall, the implemented study design in terms of PK as well as the obtained PK results appear 
adequate. A total of 8 participants received dalbavancin 22.5 mg/kg (single IV infusion over 30 
minutes) in the present study. It has been noted that the average CL of dalbavancin in Cohort 1 
(participants aged > 28 days to < 3 months) appeared to be greater than the typical value of CL in 
adult patients, while AUC0-120 was lower in all studied cohorts than in adults receiving 1500 mg. The 
obtained PK data from this study are intended to be combined with additional data from clinical studies 
of dalbavancin in paediatric patients (Studies A8841004, DUR001-106, DUR001-306) in a population 
PK analysis (to be reported separately by the MAH). The updated population PK model is then intended 
to be used to conduct PK/PD target attainment simulations to support dosing of dalbavancin in 
paediatric patients from birth to less than 18 years. 
One subject experienced an event of increased ALT and bilirubin which was considered related to study 
drug but was not classified as a Hy’s law case because there were other possible explanations to the 
LFT than liver injury. The subject did not present with clinical signs related to the increased liver 
transaminases, which went back to normal during the study period. However, increased liver 
transaminases are a known adverse event that may occur in adults treated with dalbavancin and it 
cannot be excluded that this event was to some extent related to dalbavancin. 
Even though there are challenges to evaluating audiology in infants and babies, none of the performed 
investigations suggested that the treatment with dalbavancin would have had impact on the audiology 
in those infants. It should, however, be kept in mind that the included number of paediatric subjects in 
this study are limited and at this stage no firm conclusion regarding safety in paediatric subjects can 
therefore be drawn based on this study only. 
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
This report reviews data obtained from the PIP Study 6 (DAL-PK-02) including 8 paediatric subjects 
below 3 months of age with known or suspected bacterial infection that has been treated with a single 
intravenous infusion of dalbavancin at the dose of 22.5 mg/kg body weight. The main purpose was to 
evaluate the PK profile, with plasma concentration as primary endpoint. As secondary endpoint the 
safety and tolerability were evaluated.  
The safety signals observed in this study do not suggest that any further actions regarding PIP Study 7 
are required at this stage. 
According to the PIP EMEA-000016-PIP01-07-M07, dose selection in paediatric subjects below 3 
months of age will be based on PK-results from both PIP Study 6 and PIP Study 7. Since PIP study 7 is 
still ongoing, no dose proposal has been included within this application. 
 Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

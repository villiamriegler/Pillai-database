Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for ospemifene, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Based on a review of data from clinical trials and post-marketing reporting, the PRAC considers that a 
causal relationship between ospemifene and the adverse reaction vaginal bleeding cannot be ruled out 
and therefore recommends an updated to section 4.8 of the SmPC. The PL is updated in accordance. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for ospemifene the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing ospemifene is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

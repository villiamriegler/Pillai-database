Summary of the risk management plan for Xoterna Breezhaler
(Indacaterol maleate/glycopyrronium bromide)
This is  a summary of the RMP  for  Xoterna Breezhaler. The RMP  details important risks  of 
Xoterna Breezhaler,  how  these  risks  can  be  minimized,  and  how  more  information  will  be 
obtained about Xoterna Breezhaler's risks and uncertainties (missing information).
Xoterna Breezhaler’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential  information  to  healthcare  professionals  and  patients  on  how  Xoterna Breezhaler 
should be used. 
This  summary  of  the  RMP  for  Xoterna Breezhaler  should  be  read  in  the  context  of  all  this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, 
all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Xoterna
Breezhaler's RMP.
I. The medicine and what it is used for
Xoterna Breezhaler is indicated as a maintenance bronchodilator treatment to relieve symptoms 
in adult patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (see SmPC for the full 
indication). It contains indacaterol and glycopyrronium as active substance and it is given by 
inhalation of the content of one capsule once-daily using Xoterna Breezhaler inhaler. 
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  Xoterna Breezhaler's  benefits  can  be  found  in 
Xoterna Breezhaler’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA 
website, under the medicine’s webpage
(Link: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/xoterna-breezhaler)
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimize or
further characterize the risks
Important risks of Xoterna Breezhaler, together with measures to minimize such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about Xoterna’s risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
 Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;

Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
 The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly;
 The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with 
or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.
II.A: List of important risks and missing information
Important  risks  of  Xoterna are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate  or  minimize  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Xoterna. Potential risks are concerns for which 
an  association  with  the  use  of  this  medicine  is  possible  based  on  available  data,  but  this 
association  has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information 
refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs 
to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

to the medicine
Current evidence is based on class effect information, pre-clinical
investigations, clinical studies and PMS data showing some evidence of 
causal relationship which is strengthened by mechanistic studies and MoA.

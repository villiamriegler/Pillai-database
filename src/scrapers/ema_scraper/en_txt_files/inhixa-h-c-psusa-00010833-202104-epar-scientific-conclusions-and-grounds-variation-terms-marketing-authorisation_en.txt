Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for enoxaparin, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP  are as follows:  
In view of available data on risk(s) from the literature and spontaneous reports, the PRAC considers a 
causal relationship between enoxaparin and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) is at 
least a reasonable possibility, based on three cases with  a probable causal relationship between 
enoxaparin and AGEP according to WHO  criteria, and two  of the  three cases with  a possible diagnosis of 
AGEP according to AGEP validation score of the EuroSCAR study group were identified. The PRAC 
concluded that the product information of products containing enoxaparin should be amended 
accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with  the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation  to the  terms of the marketing  authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the  scientific conclusions for enoxaparin the CHMP is of the opinion that  the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing enoxaparin is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to  the product information 
The CHMP recommends that  the terms of the  marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

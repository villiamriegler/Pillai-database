2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Obesity  is  defined  as  a  state  of  excess  body  fat  that  frequently  results  in  impairment  of  health. 
According  to  the  WHO  it  may  be  expressed  in  adults  in  terms  of  the  Body  Mass  Index  (BMI  = 
bodyweight (kilograms) / (height [metres²]) with BMI of between 18.5 and 24.9 representing the 
normal range, a BMI of 25 to 29.9 representing overweight and a BMI of ≥ 30 considered to represent 
obesity. Severe obesity is defined as BMI of ≥ 40 and is associated with a substantially greater health 
risk than a BMI of 30. In Asian and Pacific populations the limits are, however, defined lower. 
BMI appears to rise gradually during most of adult life, peaks at around 60 years, and then declines. 
After age 65, the rate of weight loss occurs at an average rate of 0 to 0.65 kg/year, although there is 
substantial individual variation. Loss of muscle mass begins from 30 to 40 years of age and continues 
into old age, while body fat increases through most of adulthood. Compared to younger individuals 
with the same BMI, older subjects tend to have a greater proportion of fat and an increased proportion 
of visceral and abdominal fat. An increase in intra-abdominal fat is associated with greater mortality 
in both younger and older adults, even when it is independent of overall adiposity. However, the effect 
of BMI on mortality seems to differ quantitatively between older and younger subjects and obesity 
may have less of an effect on mortality in older individuals than in younger individuals. In childhood, 
BMI is age and gender specific.  
Obesity is recognised as a chronic clinical condition that usually requires long-term therapy to induce 
and  maintain  weight  loss  and  is  considered  to  be  the  result  of  complex  interaction  of  genetic, 
metabolic,  environmental  and  behavioural  factors,  which  are  associated  with  increases  in  both 
morbidity and mortality. 
Although  the  relationship  is  not  linear,  health  risks  increase  with  severity  of  obesity  and  include 
hypertension,  atherogenic  dyslipidaemia  insulin  resistance  and  type  2  diabetes  mellitus,  and 
cardiovascular  disease  (angina  pectoris,  claudication,  venous  thromboses  and  their  major 
consequences  such  as  pulmonary  embolism).  Obesity  is  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of 
cardiovascular disease in adults and with less favourable cardiovascular risk factor status in children 
and adolescents. Obesity is also associated with an effect on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, 
through association with hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidaemia.  
The sleep apnoea syndrome, strongly associated with obesity, has an increased mortality. There is 
also an increased mortality from endometrial carcinoma in women and colorectal carcinoma in men. 
Hypertriglyceridaemia, reduced levels of high-density cholesterol, elevations of total and low-density 
cholesterol  and  abnormalities  in  haemostasis  are  also  associated.  Mechanical  complications  can 
severely  impair  quality  of  life.  Obese  patients  have  a  significantly  impaired  quality  of  life,  as 
objectively measured by several independent tests. Overweight and obesity after young adulthood 
has  also  been  associated  with  future  risk  of  dementia.  The  most  likely  explanation  for  this  is 
accelerated vascular dementia in heavier adults. 
The  location  of  body  fat  is  also  a  predictor  of  the  relative  health  hazards  of  obesity.  Several 
epidemiological  studies  have  shown  that  the  regional  distribution  of  body  fat  is  a  significant  and 
independent  risk  factor  for  cardiovascular  disease.  Subjects  with  visceral  (android/  abdominal) 
obesity  with  excess  fat  in  the  upper  (central)  body  region,  particularly  the  abdomen,  represent  a 
subgroup of obese individuals with the highest risk for cardiovascular disease and are also at greater 
risk  of  metabolic  complications  when  compared  to  patients  with  lower  body  (gynoid)  obesity  with 
increased  fat  in  the  lower  body  segment,  particularly  the  hips  and  thighs.  Recently,  waist 
Mysimba  
Assessment Report

Page 10/132 
  
 
circumference alone (measured at mid distance between the bottom of the rib cage and the iliac crest) 
has been found to be an integrated measure of obesity that is positively correlated with abdominal fat 
content  and  is  an  independent  predictor  of  risk.  There  is  a  suggestion  that  change  in  waist 
circumference measurement has been shown to be a better correlate of change in visceral adipose 
tissue than change in waist hip ratio. There is no widely accepted clinical measure of central obesity 
in children. The technique of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) has been shown to provide a 
direct,  accurate,  and  precise  measure  of  lean  body  mass  and  total  fat  mass,  which  allows 
quantification of fat mass in anatomically-defined regions of interest, and more precise evaluation of 
the impact of fat distribution. Other methods include computer tomography and magnetic resonance 
imaging. 
The general goals of weight loss and management are to reduce body weight and to maintain a lower 
body weight over the long term.  
Non-pharmacological  options  for  treatment  include  nutritional  education  and  modification 
(usually calorie restriction), behaviour modification, and increased activity and exercise. In severe 
obesity, very low calorie diets (VLCD) may be applied for a limited period of time and, finally, surgery 
as a last resort.  
Pharmacological  options  are  not  usually  recommended  until  at  least  a  trial  of  an  appropriate 
educing diet has proved insufficient, i.e. inadequate initial weight loss was achieved or the individual, 
despite continuing dietary advice, could not maintain an initial weight loss. Pharmacological options 
are only considered as an adjunct to dietary measures and physical exercise.  
Currently  the  only  centrally  approved  pharmacological  option  in  EU  is  Xenical  (orlistat)  and  Alli 
(orlistat). Orlistat inhibits the absorption of nutrients. Xenical (orlistat) has been centrally approved in 
July 1998 and Alli (orlistat) in July 2007. Alli is currently available as an OTC product. 
Because current pharmacotherapies are extremely limited, an unmet clinical need for safe, effective, 
and well-tolerated medications persists; therefore, a new pharmacologic strategy with a good safety 
profile that results in significant weight loss would be beneficial.  
Orexigen Therapeutics Inc. has developed a fixed-dose combination (FDC) product for the treatment 
of obesity composed of two currently marketed drug substances: bupropion hydrochloride (hereafter 
bupropion),  a  norepinephrine  and  dopamine  reuptake  inhibitor,  together  with  naltrexone 
hydrochloride (hereafter naltrexone), a mu-opioid receptor antagonist. 
In  the  EU,  naltrexone  and  bupropion  have  been  individually  used  for  over  25  and  14  years, 
respectively, for chronic indications at doses comparable to (bupropion) or greater than (naltrexone) 
those recommended for naltrexone hydrochloride /bupropion hydrochloride combination (NB) FDC for 
the treatment of obesity. 
Prolonged  release  formulations  of  bupropion  are  approved  in  the  EU  for  the  treatment  of  major 
depression and nicotine dependence. In 1999, bupropion (Zyban®) was first approved through the 
Mutual Recognition Procedure (MRP) as an aid in smoking cessation. In 2007, Bupropion (Wellbutrin® 
XR)  also  underwent  the  MRP  procedure  and  was  approved  for  the  treatment  of  major  depressive 
episodes. Bupropion is registered in all EU countries with the exception of Bulgaria. 
Immediate release formulations of naltrexone are approved in EU for the treatment of opiate and 
alcohol dependence. Either the originator Nalorex® or several generic products are available in most 
of the EU Member States. 
The rationale for the development of this combination product is that administration of naltrexone 
with  bupropion  would  result  in  greater  weight  loss  than  either  treatment  alone.  Both  compounds 
affect key circuitry in two areas of the brain. The first is the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, an 
area of the brain that plays a critical role in the control of food intake and energy expenditure. The 
Mysimba  
Assessment Report

second is the mesolimbic dopaminergic reward system, a region of the brain that is important for 
processing the rewarding aspects of food and food related stimuli. Furthermore, both bupropion and 
naltrexone  act  in  the  mesolimbic  reward  system  to  influence  eating  behaviour.  Pairing  the 
long-established mu-opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone with bupropion was hypothesised to yield 
a more potent sustained effect on body weight than either agent alone. 
The  drug  product  proposed  for  marketing  is  available  in  one  strength  8mg/90mg  of  naltrexone 
hydrochloride/bupropion hydrochloride as a prolonged release tablet for oral administration.  
2.2.  Quality aspects

The  product  is  available  in  PVC  and  PCTFE  laminated  blisters  and  sealed  with  an  aluminium  foil 
(PVC/PCTFE/PVC/Alu) as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Naltrexone 
Naltrexone hydrochloride is described in the Ph. Eur. The chemical name of the active substance is 
(5α)-17-(Cyclopropylmethyl)-4,5-epoxy-3,14-dihydroxymorphinan-6-one hydrochloride, 
corresponding to the molecular formula C 20H 24ClNO 4 and has a relative molecular mass 377.85. It has 
the following structure: 
The  structure  of  the  active  substance  has  been  confirmed  by  mass  spectrometry,  infrared,  1H- 
and 13C-NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography, all of which support the chemical structure. 
It appears as a white to slightly off-white, hygroscopic crystalline powder. It is freely soluble in water 
and slightly soluble in ethanol. The dissociation constant of naltrexone was determined to be pKa1 = 
8.38 and pKa2= 9.93, and its partition coefficient (n-octanol/water) logK ow was determined to be 
0.534. 
The structure of naltrexone HCl has four stereogenic centers that are predetermined in the starting 
material.

There  are  possibly  seven  identified  polymorphic  forms.  The  relevant  to  the  synthesis  three 
polymorphic forms of naltrexone hydrochloride together with their corresponding XRPD spectra and 
DSC  scans  have  been  presented.  The  anhydrous  form  of  naltrexone  hydrocloride  is  routinely  and 
consistently obtained from the synthesis used by the proposed manufacturer.  
The active substance is packaged in material which complies with the relevant EC  Regulation and 
Ph. Eur. requirements.  
The information on the active substance has been provided according to the Active Substance Master 
File (ASMF) procedure. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Naltrexone hydrochloride is manufactured  by a five step process from well-defined and adequately 
controlled starting materials. Reprocessing if needed is foreseen and described. The synthesis does 
not alter the configuration of the stereogenic centres established in the starting materials. Isolated 
intermediates have been identified and are controlled by appropriate specifications. The process has 
been  described  in  sufficient  detail  and  critical  process  parameters  (CPPs)  and  in-process  controls 
(IPCs) have been reported and are considered satisfactory.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on  chemistry  of  new  active  substances.  Sufficient  information  on  potential  and  actual  impurities 
(including potential genotoxic), their fate and control has been presented.  
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Specification 
Naltrexone hydrochloride is controlled as per the current Ph. Eur. monograph. In addition to the tests 
listed in the Ph. Eur. monograph, the active substance specification includes controls of a potential 
genotoxic impurity and a residual solvent both specific to the applied synthetic process. The overall 
control strategy for impurities and catalysts is considered acceptable.    
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  non-compendial  methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.  
Batch analysis data for three commercial scale batches of the active substance were provided from 
the supplier and the product manufacturer. The results were similar between the proposed supplier 
and  with  the  results  obtained  by  the  product  manufacturer;  they  complied  with  the  proposed 
specification and were consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on 14 commercial scale batches stored for up to 60 months under long term conditions 
at 25 °C/ 60 % RH and for up to six months under accelerated conditions at 40 °C/ 75 % RH according 
to the ICH guidelines were provided. Stability batches were packaged in containers either identical or 
equivalent to the commercial one.  
The investigated parameters were appearance, impurities, completeness of solution, water content, 
residual solvents and assay. The analytical methods were shown to be stability indicating. 
No particular trend was observed, all the results were in line with the proposed specification. It was 
observed  that  for  the  batches  manufactured  initially,  the  content  in  residual  solvents  was  higher, 
although  within  the  acceptance  limits.  The  batches  manufactured  recently  had  a  lower  content  in

residual solvents. The results one impurity were out of specification at the 48 and 60 months interval 
while at the 36 month time point there was an increase in two other impurities. These observations,\ 
however,  were  made  on  a  single  batch  of  the  older  stability  batches.  Based  on  the  provided 
information it was considered these were not related to any changes in manufacturing method or 
analytical method, but to handling of the samples in the older stability studies. None of these was 
observed for more recent stability batches and therefore it is not seen as a plausible concern. 
Photostability study was performed in accordance with ICH guideline; the results did not show any 
significant changes compared to the control.  
Stress studies have been performed at high heat, boiling hydrochloric acid, boiling sodium hydroxide 
and boiling phosphoric acid and UV light. Degradation did not occur under UV light but naltrexone has 
been found to degrade in the other tested stressed conditions. 
Based on presented stability data, the proposed re-test period and storage conditions for naltrexone 
are acceptable. 
General information 
Bupropion 
The  chemical  name  of  the  active  substance  is  ((±)-2-(tert-butylamino)-3’-chloropropiophenone 
hydrochloride,  corresponding  to  the  molecular  formula  C13H18ClNO.HCl  and  a  relative  molecular 
mass of 276.21. It has the following structure: 
The structure of the active substance has been confirmed by elemental analysis, mass spectroscopy, 
1H-NMR , IR- and UV-spectroscopy along with the chemical pathway used for the synthesis. 
It appears as a white to almost white, hygroscopic crystalline powder. It is freely soluble in methanol, 
soluble in water and ethanol, very slightly soluble in acetone. The pH of a 5 % aqueous solution of 
bupropion hydrochloride is about 5.0. 
Bupropion HCl has one asymmetric carbon atom. It is produced as a racemate with no optical activity 
since the relevant synthesis reaction is not stereospecific. Cis-trans and threo-erythro isomerisations 
do not occur. 
Five polymorphic forms of bupropion hydrochloride are known. XRPD and DSC studies confirmed the 
presence of only one crystalline form, the same from both manufacturers. 
The active substance is packaged in material which complies with the relevant EC  Regulation and 
Ph. Eur. requirements.  
The information on the active substance is provided according to the Active Substance Master File 
(ASMF) procedure. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Two  manufacturers  are  proposed  for  the  manufacture  of  the  active  substance,  both  following  the 
same  synthetic  route.  The  manufacture  consists  of  two  chemical  reaction  steps,  purification  and 
milling. The proposed starting materials are well-defined and, considering the overall control strategy

over the synthetic process, are considered acceptable. The synthesis has been described in sufficient 
detail and critical process parameters (CPPs) and in-process controls (IPCs) have been reported and 
are considered satisfactory.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on  chemistry  of  new  active  substances.  Potential  and  actual  impurities  (including  genotoxic)  and 
degradation products have been characterised and are adequately controlled.  
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Specification 
The  active  substance  specification  includes  appropriate  tests  and  limits  for:  appearance  (visual), 
identity (bupropion: IR, HPLC, chloride: chemical reaction), water content (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), 
related substances (HPLC), residual solvents (GC) and particle size (laser light diffraction). The same 
specification applies to the material from both suppliers. 
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  validated  as  appropriate  in 
accordance with the ICH guideline.    
Batch analysis data for 14 full scale batches from both suppliers (8+6) were provided.  
Additional data for 15 batches manufactured at a different site used in the clinical programme were 
also  submitted.  All  results  were  within  the  specifications  and  consistent  from  batch  to  batch.  The 
quality of the material from both suppliers is considered comparable. 
Stability 
Stability data on 20 commercial scale batches of active substance from the first supplier stored for up 
to  72  months  under  long  term  conditions  at  25  °C/  60  %  RH  and  for  up  to  six  months  under 
accelerated  conditions  at  40  °C/  75  %  RH  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The 
packaging  used  for  the  for  the  stability  studies  simulates  the  packaging  used  for  the  commercial 
product. The investigated parameters were: description, related substances, water and assay. Forced 
degradation studies showed the analytical methods to be stability indicating. All the results were in 
line with the proposed specification.  
No formal photostability study has been performed though samples were exposed light in the stress 
testing study. The samples showed no significant difference with respect to unexposed samples. 
Stability data on three commercial scale batches of active substance from the other supplier stored for 
up  to  36  months  under  long  term  conditions  at  25  °C/  60 %  RH  and  for  up  to  six  months  under 
accelerated  conditions  at  40  °C/  75  %  RH  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The 
packaging  used  for  the  for  the  stability  studies  simulates  the  packaging  used  for  the  commercial 
product. 
The  active  substance  was  tested  in  line  with  the  shelf  life  specification  by  methods  shown  to  be 
stability indicating. All the results were in compliance with the acceptance criteria in the proposed 
specification. No particular trend was observed.  
Photostability  study  was  conducted  according  to  ICH  guideline  Q1B  requirements.  Bupropion 
hydrochloride showed only a very slight degradation. 
Forced degradation studies were performed by both suppliers under acidic, basic, oxidative, thermic 
and light treatment. No degradation was observed under acid, thermic and light exposure. Various 
degree of degradation was observed for samples in different conditions.  
Based on presented stability data, the proposed re-test period and storage conditions are acceptable.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Mysimba  fixed  dose  combination  tablets  are  comprised  of  a  trilayer  core  that  is  composed  of  two 
active layers containing one active substance each and an inert layer separating the active layers. The 
two active layers were developed separately. 
Various formulations of bupropion hydrochloride were developed utilising different type of solid forms 
and different manufacturing methods. The final formulation and manufacturing method were selected 
on  the  criterion  of  showing  the  desired  dissolution  profile.  L-cysteine  hydrochloride  is  used  as  a 
stabiliser  for  bupropion  hydrochloride  which  has  been  shown  susceptible  to  hydrolysis.  A  detailed 
overview of the different compositions of the bupropion layer was provided. 
The development of the formulation and manufacturing method of naltrexone layer has also been 
described in sufficient detail. EDTA is used as a stabiliser in the active naltrexone layer. Due to the low 
content of low content of naltrexone in the formulation, blend and content uniformity were evaluated 
in detail, and the manufacturing process was optimised in this respect. .  
The trilayer tablet was formulated from the combination of the two individual active layers and an 
inert layer between these two layers.  
The middle inert layer disintegrates rapidly in order to separate the two active layers, which then 
release each active substance independently from each other. The blue dye in the inert layer is used 
as a processing aid to differentiate layers during compression. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. Non-compendial excipients are controlled by suitable in-house monographs. There are no 
novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The role and need for the two stabilisers 
cysteine HCl and EDTA were explained and the amounts of stabilisers used in the individual layers 
were justified supported by data. The full list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
Both  active  substances  are  soluble  in  water  and  the  suppliers  consistently  manufacture  and 
sufficiently  control  the  same  polymorph.  In  the  clinical  development  a  different  polymorph  of 
naltrexone hydrochloride was used than the one proposed.  However taking into account the aqueous 
solubility  of  naltrexone,  polymorphism  is  not  expected  to  be  a  significant  factor  with  respect  to 
bioavailability.  It  was  further  demonstrated  that  other  bupropion  potential  crystalline  forms  that 
might  be  generated  during  product  manufacture  are  also  very  soluble,  and  the  properties  of  the 
tablets were not affected. Therefore polymorphism is not deemed critical with regard to the product 
quality. Additionally, it has been shown by stability studies that both substances remain in the same 
crystalline  form  during  storage.  Also  the  proposed  particle  size  specification  is  deemed  sufficient 
taking also into account the aqueous solubility of both active substances. 
The  proposed  dissolution  method  is  an  important  quality  control  tool  for  the  performance  of  this 
specialised  pharmaceutical  form.  The  bioavailability  batch  showed  acceptable  pharmacokinetic 
exposure. 
 It is considered that the variability observed in vitro is not clinically relevant from a pharmacokinetic 
and  safety  perspective.  Based  on  the  presented  information  the  proposed  dissolution  method  is 
considered sufficiently discriminatory. The dissolution specification was based on clinical data and on 
the in vitro performance of the clinical batches and the bioavailability batch. 
Dissolution studies of one batch of the trilayer tablet in media containing varying concentrations of 
ethanol  to  test  potential  dose  dumping  of  bupropion  and  naltrexone  as  per  the  QWP  Q&A  was 
performed. It was demonstrated that the dissolution of both drug substances was reduced by ethanol 
i.e. the trilayer tablets do not exhibit dose dumping of bupropion or naltrexone in the presence of 
alcoholic  dissolution  media.  Despite  the  slower  release  in  the  presence  of  ethanol,  the  full  dose 
ultimately  is  available  once  the  tablet  fully  dissolves,  albeit  later  than  in  the  absence  of  alcohol. 
Additional clinical justification was provided and a wording in the SmPC has been proposed to take a 
Mysimba

conservative approach to a potential interaction between the Mysimba and alcohol. This is further 
assessed in the clinical assessment report.  
The  manufacturing  process  development  activities  were  primarily  focused  around  the  achieved  
introduction of the middle fast disintegrating inert layer.  
The  processes  related  to  the  bupropion  hydrochloride  and  naltrexone  hydrochloride  parts  of  the 
dosage form were independently developed and then combined with the process for the inert middle 
layer  to  provide  the  final  overall  process.  The  development  of  the  early  clinical  batches  was  also 
described.    The  majority  of  Phase  III  clinical  batches  and  all  of  the  registration  batches  were 
manufactured by the proposed process at the proposed commercial site.  
Mysimba tablets are packaged in PVC/PCTFE/Aluminium blisters, a material which complies with the 
Ph. Eur. requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been supported by stability 
data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacturing Mysimba film-coated tablets, consists of the following steps: wet granulation of the 
bupropion layer, blending of the components of the middle (inert) layer, blending of the naltrexone 
layer , compression of the three solid mixtures to the trilayer tablet core, film-coating and packaging. 
The manufacturing process of the finished product is considered a non-standard process due to the 
prolonged release properties of the two separate layers and the low content of naltrexone in the final 
tablet. 
Process intermediates are defined and controlled by appropriate specifications; holding times have 
been qualified for these intermediates. The critical process parameters and in-process controls have 
been presented and are justified in relation to how the quality attributes are affected. 
Process validation data of three production scale batches were provided. All results comply with the 
specifications. 
Overall  it  is  considered  that  the  manufacture  is  sufficiently  robust  to  provide  assurance  that  the 
process produces the finished product Mysimba film coated prolonged release tablets of consistent 
quality, complying with the designated specification. 
Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  and  shelf-life  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  and  limits  for 
appearance (visual), identification of bupropion HCl (HPLC, HPLC-DAD or HPLC-PDA), identification of 
naltrexone HCl (HPLC, HPLC-DAD or HPLC-PDA), assay of bupropion HCl and naltrexone HCl (HPLC), 
naltrexone and bupropion related substances (HPLC), water content (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of dosage 
units (Ph. Eur.), dissolution of bupropion HCl and naltrexone HCl (Ph. Eur.- HPLC) and microbial limits 
(Ph. Eur.). Impurities were qualified by toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications 
have been set according to ICH Q3A. The analytical methods used have been adequately described 
and appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.    
Batch  results  were  provided  for  52  batches  used  as  clinical  batches,  three  stability  and  three 
registration  batches.  The  registration  batches  and  many  of  the  other  batches  were  manufactured 
using active substances from the proposed manufacturers. Some of the batches were manufactured 
at different sites and / or from material from other manufacturers used only during development. The 
batch size of the presented batches varies and includes at least two full scale batches. The presented 
data  confirm  the  consistency  of  the  manufacturing  process  and  its  ability  to  manufacture  to  the 
intended product specification.

Stability of the product 
Stability  data  on  three  pilot  scale  stability  batches  of  finished  product  stored  in  the  intended 
commercial package for 36 months under long term conditions at 25 °C / 60 % RH, intermediate 
conditions at 30 °C / 65 % RH and for six months under accelerated conditions at 40 °C / 75 % RH 
according to ICH guidelines were provided.  
In addition, supportive stability data were provided for three lower strength batches of naltrexone / 
bupropion 4 mg / 90 mg using bupropion from the second supplier and naltrexone from an alternative 
manufacturer (used for development only). 
Samples were tested for the parameters as per the release specification with the exception of content 
uniformity. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating.  
All  results  were  within  the  proposed  specification  with  the  exception  of  some  out-of-specification 
results  of  the  related  substances  of  both  naltrexone  and  bupropion  observed  after  6  months  in 
accelerated conditions and after 36 months in the intermediate conditions. However, under normal 
long term conditions all results were within the specification. 
The  results  and  their  statistical  analysis  demonstrated  that  tablets  manufactured  with  active 
substances from different sources are comparable. 
In  addition,  one  batch  was  tested  in  a  photostability  study  performed  in  accordance  with  the  ICH 
guidance. The results were well within the specification limits, and it was concluded that the product 
is not sensitive to light. 
Tablets were subjected also to forced degradation studies under heat and UV light, whereas aqueous 
solutions  of  naltrexone  HCl  and  bupropion  HCl  were  subjected  to  alkalic,  acidic  and  oxidative 
conditions demonstrating the methods are stability indicating. 
Overall based on the presented information the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in 
the SmPC are acceptable. 
Adventitious agent 
It  is  confirmed  that  the  lactose  used  in  the  manufacture  of  Mysimba  is  produced  from  milk  from 
healthy animals in the same condition as those used to collect milk for human consumption and that 
the lactose has been prepared without the use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according 
to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy 
Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products. 
L-Cysteine Hydrochloride used in the product manufacture is derived from acid hydrolysis of keratin 
sourced from poultry feathers. The manufacturing process conditions used to manufacture L-cysteine 
from poultry feathers ensure that the material is unlikely to pose any TSE risk and presents a very low 
risk  of  infectious  agent  transmission  such  as  those  associated  with  viruses,  bacteria  or  prions.  A 
TSE/BSE statement from the supplier was provided.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The documentation on the active substances has been presented as ASMF from each of the suppliers. 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance has been presented in 
a  satisfactory  manner.  The  product  is  formulated  as  a  fixed-dose  combination  trilayer  tablet  for 
prolonged  release  oral  delivery.  The  three  layer  formulation  is  justified.  The  excipients  and  the 
formulation of the trilayer tablet are justified. The finished product and its performance are controlled 
by appropriate specifications.

Mysimba is a specialised pharmaceutical dosage form due to the prolonged release properties of the 
two separate layers and the low amount of naltrexone hydrochloride manufactured by a non-standard 
manufacturing process which has been properly validated. The product is controlled by appropriate 
specifications.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and  uniformity  of  important 
product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have 
a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SmPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The Applicant submitted mainly literature data supporting the non-clinical aspects mostly related to 
each mono component. Three additional new non-clinical studies were conducted to support the NB 
application. In vivo animal and in vitro cellular models from literature sources were used to review the 
pharmacology  and  further  define  the  mechanism  of  action  for  Naltrexone  and  Bupropion,  with  an 
emphasis on effects related to their established mechanisms in opioid/alcohol addiction (Naltrexone), 
depression  (Bupropion),  nicotine  dependence  (Bupropion),  and  the  hypothesized  mechanism  of 
action of NB in the facilitation of weight loss.  
For  the  fixed  dose  combination,  NB,  the  Applicant  has  submitted  one  safety  pharmacology  study 
(Study No.l 1560-001) and two pharmacokinetics studies.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  and Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No new pharmacodynamic (PD) studies with Naltrexone or Bupropion have been conducted by the 
Applicant  to  support  the  combined  NB  application.  The  Applicant  refers  to  published  literature  on 
pharmacodynamic  effects  of  both  compounds  and  also  to  the  pharmacodynamics  stated  for 
Naltrexone  and  Bupropion  in  the  SmPCs  for  each  mono  component  as  additional  supportive 
information. Generally, the PD data from the literature of Naltrexone and Bupropion is correctly cited 
by  the  Applicant.  The  amount  of  literature  is  quite  comprehensive,  in  support  of  the  current 
application. 
Naltrexone 
Mysimba

The  mechanism  of  action  of  Naltrexone  hydrochloride  is  not  completely  elucidated.  However,  the 
primary pharmacology of Naltrexone is believed to be occupation and competitive blockade of opioid 
receptors, in particular the mu opioid receptor. 
Marks-Kaufmann  et  al  (1984)  showed  a  significant  decrease  in  total  calorie  intake,  following  SC 
infusion of Naltrexone at 200 µg/kg/hr, administered by a surgically implanted mini-osmotic pump. 
However, the observed effect was only evident the first week after implantation, and no statistically 
significant  reduced  caloric  intake,  compared  with  saline,  was  evident  in  the  second  week.  As  the 
observed significant reduction in food intake was only present in Naltrexone-treated rats in the week 
following operation, and as both saline- and Naltrexone treated animals apparently reduce food intake 
in this time period, the influence of operation stress from implantation of osmotic mini pumps should 
be taken into account with relation to the apparent anorectic effect of Naltrexone in this study.  
Extended-release  of  Naltrexone  (50  mg/kg  IM)  decreased  the  food  intake  and  body  weight  gain 
induced by olanzapine (Kurbanov et al. (2012). The authors did not see any effects on food intake or 
body weight gain when administering Naltrexone alone.  
Naltrexone  doses  of  1-3  mg/kg  administered  SC  to  rats  significantly  decreased  food  seeking  and 
binge-like eating in a study by Giuliano et al. (2012).  
In mildly food restricted rats, Naltrexone significantly and dose-dependently suppressed short-term 
food intake (1, 4 and 20 hours post dosing) at doses of 0.32, 1 and 3.2 mg/kg IP (Liang et al., 2013). 
Additive effects on food intake reduction as well as food aversion learning was found for Naltrexone in 
combination with the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonist, exendin-4. 
Secondary  pharmacodynamic  effects  of  Naltrexone  are  generally  believed  to  be  mediated  via  mu 
opioid receptors and include increased gut motility, increase in luteinising hormone, a decrease in 
prolactin and blocking opioid-agonist-induced discriminative stimuli. Low dose Naltrexone has shown 
potential beneficial effects in a murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model as well as 
repression of tumour progression in mice transplanted with human epithelial ovarian cancer cells. 
Bupropion 
Bupropion was confirmed to be anorexic 2 to 4 hours after IP administration to rats at 12.5-75 mg/kg 
Bupropion (Zarrindast and Hosseini-Nia, 1988). However, in mice treated with Bupropion (20 and 40 
mg/kg IP daily for 7 days), the effect was only evident at 1 hour post treatment and not 4 hours after 
treatment. In this latter study, no effects were observed on body weight (Billes and Cowley 2007). In 
a  subsequent  publication,  a  significant  increase  in  food  intake  was  observed  in  Bupropion  treated 
animals (doses) on day 5 and the cumulative food intake was increased by 17% on Day 7. 
The Applicant has stated in the Non-Clinical Overview, that ‘Billes and Cowley (2008) administered 
acute  intraperitoneal  (IP)  injections  of  Bupropion,  GBR12783  (a  selective  DA  reuptake  inhibitor), 
nisoxetine (a selective NE reuptake inhibitor) or combinations of GBR12783 and nisoxetine. All three 
decreased food intake in lean or obese mice. However, the combination of the two selective agents 
produced an additive reduction in body weight gain, suggesting that both catecholamines play a role 
in  Bupropion’s  effects  on  energy  balance.’  As  Bupropion  was  not  used  in  combination  with  either 
selective  agent,  the  abovementioned  statement  does  not  support  the  hypothetical  additive  or 
synergistic effect of Bupropion in the NB combination.  
Non-clinical  literature  presented  by  the  Applicant  suggests  that  Bupropion  increases  energy 
expenditure in rodents by increasing thermogenesis and locomotor activity.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic effects of Bupropion in rodents include anti-nociception in mechanical 
allodynia, decreased prolactin concentrations, and decreased baseline gastric secretion and produces 
subjective and reinforcing effects in the context of abuse potential assessment.

The  studies  cited  by  the  Applicant  supporting  the  pharmacodynamic  properties  of  Naltrexone 
Bupropion provide somewhat contradicting data on the anorexic properties of the drug. Nevertheless, 
the rationale for not performing new non-clinical studies is however supported in this case due to the 
results from the clinical studies.  
NB combination 
The proposed mechanism of action of NB combination for the treatment of obesity is based on basic 
research on regulation of food intake by the hypothalamus and reward centres of the brain. 
No new non-clinical studies have been performed by the Applicant to support the NB combination, but 
literature references showing the effects of Naltrexone and Bupropion, combined and alone, as well as 
the combination of Bupropion+Naltrexone and other drugs have been cited.  
The intended route of administration for NB is via oral route, however, most PD studies presented by 
the  Applicant  report  IP  or  SC  dosing.  This  can  be  acceptable,  as  the  bioavailability  following  oral 
administration gives rise to similar exposure values as following IP or SC administration.  
Only two studies were presented investigating repeated administration of NB in mice and rats and 
these  were  by  the  same  authors  in  the  same  paper  (Clapper  et  al.,  2013).  In  the  acute  studies, 
Naltrexone  and  Bupropion  did  indeed  have  an  inhibitory  effect  on  diet  consumption  in  both  diet 
induced  obese  (DIO)  mice  as  well  as  in  lean  mice  fed  high  fat  diet,  however,  by  4  hours  post 
treatment, no differences was observed compared to saline control. In the repeat-dose study in DIO 
rats’  diet  consumption  was  reduced  following  as  well  as  body  weight  and  fat  mass  in 
Naltrexone/Bupropion treated animals compared to vehicle. Additive effect of NB on food intake and 
weight loss in mice was found at 1 and 50 mg/kg Naltrexone and Bupropion, respectively, and in rats 
at 1 and 20 mg/kg Naltrexone and Bupropion, respectively. These doses correspond to human doses 
of 8.0 and 3.2 mg/kg based on body surface area conversion.    
In  the  study  by  Clapper  et  al.  (2013),  a  significant  reduction  of  POMC  mRNA  expression 
(approximately 40%) was found after 14 days treatment with the NB combination. In addition, no 
change  in  MC4R  mRNA  expression  was  found  after  NB  treatment.  These  results  contradict  the 
proposed mechanism of action of NB by the Applicant as well as results from e.g. Greenway et al. 
(2009), in which the firing rate of hypothalamic POMC neurons was increased after administration of 
NB. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Naltrexone 
Cardiovascular effects / HERG study 
For the metabolite, 6-Beta Naltrexol, a dilution error had occurred in the hERG study conducted by the 
Applicant, so the concentration of 0.1 µM 6-Beta Naltrexol was not tested. When looking at the data 
from the study, it seems convincing that both Naltrexone and the metabolite 6-Beta Naltrexol inhibit 
hERG mediated potassium currents by increasing concentrations. Previous in vitro work conducted to 
evaluate bupropion effects on several inwardly rectifying potassium channels in vitro demonstrated 
minimal effects.  Therefore, a combination hERG assay was deemed unnecessary, consistent with the 
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005  guideline  on  the  nonclinical  development  of  fixed  combinations  of 
medicinal products. 
It is correctly referred that ‘no effect of Naltrexone (20 mg/kg/day) on heart rate or mean arterial 
pressure in sham operated rats was found under baseline conditions in the study by Tavakoli et al. 
(2007). However, ICH guideline S7B states: ‘The ionic mechanisms of repolarisation in adult rats and 
mice differ from larger species, including humans (the primary ion currents controlling repolarisation 
in adult rats and mice is Ito); therefore, use of these species is not considered appropriate.’ Therefore, 
Mysimba

the  data  on  Naltrexone  in  the  abovementioned  study  are  not  fully  relevant  to  support  the  safety 
pharmacology of Naltrexone. The clinical data from the clinical use of Naltrexone indication are rather 
addressing this concern. 
The transient increase in blood pressure following 10 mg/kg Naltrexone in the study by Byrd (1983) 
was discussed by the author: ‘The transient increase in blood pressure after 10.0 mg/kg naloxone or 
Naltrexone may have been due indirectly to behavioural changes precipitated by this dose rather than 
to direct effects on the cardiovascular system. Most of the monkeys displayed unusual behavioural 
including retching, vomiting, and profuse salivation and frothing after 10.0 mg/kg, and the periodic 
muscular contractions associated with these activities may have produced the transient increases in 
pressure.’ Based on this, in this study, the transient increase in blood pressure seen in the 10 mg/kg 
IV dose group is not considered a potential safety issue for Naltrexone.

Cardiovascular effects of Bupropion have been investigated in several experimental systems.  
Ex vivo: In rat and guinea pig atria, Bupropion at and above 10 µM decreased sinus rate. In canine 
Purkinje fibres, a slight depolarisation in resting membrane potential was seen at concentrations of 
100 µM Bupropion. In a hERG study, Bupropion functioned as a weak IKr blocker with an estimated 
IC50 on hERG tail currents of approximately 34 µM. In isolated guinea-pig hearts 10 µM Bupropion 
caused mild QRS widening. Bupropion may further inhibit gap function intercellular communication.  
In vivo: In anaesthetised dogs, 3-6 mg/kg Bupropion IV transiently increased pulmonary vascular 
resistance  index  and  mean  pulmonary  arterial  pressure  while  no  effect  on  other  cardiovascular 
parameters was found. The validity of these results seems authentic, however, potential bias from 
use of pentobarbital cannot be ruled out. Using e.g. the FEAB model would have been preferable for 
this  kind  of  study,  as  one  of  its  major  characteristics  is  its  ability  to  maintain  homeostatic 
cardiovascular  reflexes  that  are  comparable  to  those  of  normal  conscious  animals.  The 
dose-dependent  pro-  and/or  anticonvulsant  properties  of  Bupropion  have  been  investigated  in  a 
relatively large number of non-clinical studies, mainly investigating the seizure threshold lowering or 
increasing capacity of Bupropion when administered before or together with other substances with 
convulsive properties.  
The CD50 values reported by various authors in mice range from 82-157 mg/kg Bupropion IP. As 
argued by the Applicant, the lowest value of 82 mg/kg may represent an underestimation and so the 
Applicant states that ‘in all studies, convulsions have been reported at doses largely exceeding the 
proposed clinical dose (on a mg/kg body weight basis) for NB.’ This statement cannot be supported, 
as  a  CD50  of  157  mg/kg  (highest  value  reported)  corresponds  to  (157/12.3)  =  12.8  mg/kg. 
Bupropion is not even 2-fold higher than the dose proposed for NB (7.2 mg/kg based on standard 
weight of 50 kg for an adult). However, as seizures were only reported to occur at an incidence of 0.1 
% in the clinical studies of NB, and use of NB is contraindicated in individuals with a seizure disorder 
or a history of seizures, the lack of a greater safety margin is acceptable. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No  new  single  dose  pharmacokinetic  studies  have  been  performed  with  the  NB  combination.  The 
non-clinical pharmacokinetics of Naltrexone and Bupropion is summarised as a series of literature 
studies.  It  cannot  be  verified  from  the  publications  that  the  studies  described  would  conform  to 
current Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) standards. It also cannot be confirmed from the literature 
reports whether pharmacokinetic studies were conducted with the active pharmaceutical ingredients 
conforming to current standards and no information is provided in the publications with respect to the 
impurity or degradant profiles of lots used.

Some of the analytical methods (e.g. TLC) are considered old compared to today and furthermore, on 
some  occasions  information  is  missing  regarding  Limit  of  Detection.  However,  in  general  the 
analytical methods used are considered acceptable. 
Absorption 
The  lack  of  multiple  dose  nonclinical  PK  data  for  naltrexone  is  acceptable,  as  clinical  PK  data 
demonstrate  that  naltrexone  is  well-absorbed,  widely  distributed  and  extensively  metabolised 
through  hepatic  and  extra-hepatic  mechanisms  after  oral  administration.  Clinical  data  also 
demonstrate dose-proportionality of naltrexone and no time-dependent effects.  
Adequate  information  is  available  regarding  the  absorption  of  Bupropion  after  PO  and  IV 
administration.  The  time  dependency  of  the  Pharmacokinetics  of  Bupropion  and  its  primary 
metabolite (Hydroxybupropion) is discussed for three different animal species. No published data was 
provided  on  dose  proportionality  of  bupropion  or  its  hydroxybupropion  metabolite  in  non-clinical 
models.  This  is  acceptable,  as  clinical  data  for  the  AUC  and  Cmax  of  bupropion  and  its  active 
metabolites hydroxybupropion and threohydrobupropion are available from clinical studies. 
Distribution 
The  results  of  the  autoradiography  revealed  rapid  distribution  from  plasma  to  body  tissues.  High 
radioactivity was observed in the elimination organs (e.g. kidney and liver) and furthermore in the 
lung, testis and spleen. The highest Naltrexone concentration was observed in sub maxillary gland in 
the rabbit 1.5 hr post administration. Detectable radioactivity could be observed in brain and plasma 
96 hours post dosing.  
The presented literature data are in general considered acceptable in order to evaluate the tissue 
distribution of Bupropion. The result of the literature tissue distribution study reveals that Bupropion 
is widely distributed in body tissue. The majority of the parent compound  and its metabolites are 
primarily distributed to the elimination organs (e.g. liver and kidney).  
Metabolism 
The  provided  information  regarding  metabolic  fate  of  Naltrexone  and  domination  metabolites  in 
animals  and  humans  are  in  general  considered  acceptable.  Concentration  time  relationship  of  the 
different metabolites in biological matrices is presented. 
The  pre-systemic  metabolism  is  discussed  (hepatic  first  pass  effect).  The  primary  products  of 
metabolism of Naltrexone in animals are conjugated Naltrexone and free and conjugated forms of 
6β-naltrexol.  In  humans  the  enzyme  responsible  for  the  formation  of  the  primary  metabolite 
6β-naltrexol is described as dihydrodiol dehydrogenases, however, no mechanism is proposed for the 
discussed animal species.  
Bupropion  has  been  shown  to  induce  its  own  metabolism  (auto  induction).  Hydroxybupropion  is 
considered  the  most  important  metabolite  of  Bupropion,  as  it  is  pharmacologically  active.  The 
provided  information  regarding  metabolic  fate  of  Bupropion  to  Hydroxybupropion  in  humans  and 
animals is considered acceptable. In humans CYP2B6 is considered the primary enzyme responsible 
for the metabolism and in animals (rats) it is CYP2B1 (75% homolog to CYP2B6). The Applicant has 
provided a table (Welch 1987) which includes a summary of the mean systemic exposure of bupropion 
and  its  hydroxybupropion  metabolite  following  single  and  multiple  oral  dose  administration  of 
bupropion in mouse, rat and dog. This information is sufficient to address the species differences in 
the relative proportion of circulating bupropion to hydroxybupropion. 
The pre-systemic metabolism of Bupropion is discussed in relation to the gastrointestinal system in 
rats. Based on in vitro affinity studies, different enzymes (CYP2C11 and CYP2E1) are suggested to be 
responsible for the metabolism of Bupropion to Hydroxybupropion in rats.

Elimination 
With regards to the excretion of Naltrexone, the literature data provided are in general considered 
acceptable. Mass balance  studies shows that Naltrexone and its metabolite are almost completely 
eliminated  in  urine  and  faeces.  Differences  exist  between  animal  species.  Data  obtained  from 
monkeys  are  considered  more  similar  to  humans.  However,  caution  should  be  made  with 
interpretation of the enclosed data as different dose levels were administered and different routes of 
administration were used. 
Literature  study  data  are  presented  of  Bupropion  excretion.  Mass  balance  studies  show  that 
Bupropion and its metabolite are almost completely eliminated in urine and faeces. Less than 1% of 
the radioactivity was excreted in the urine or faeces as unchanged parent compound. It should be 
noted that only one animal species is discussed and that no comparison is made to humans. 
Drug interactions 
In humans the enzyme responsible for the biotransformation of Naltrexone to the primary metabolite 
6β-naltrexol is described as dihydrodiol dehydrogenases and for Bupropion CYP2B6 is considered the 
primary  enzyme  responsible  for  its  metabolism/biotransformation  into  its  active  metabolite 
Hydroxybupropion. Therefore, the risk for clinical relevant drug interactions with concomitant use is 
considered minimal. 
There are no known significant drug interactions involving monotherapy with Naltrexone. However, 
there  is  a  potential  for  drug  interactions  with  Bupropion  because  of  its  extensive  metabolism, 
especially with agents that are metabolised by the CYP2B6 isoenzyme.  
Bupropion and its metabolites showed nearly 100% inhibition of the OCT2 transporter at the highest 
concentrations  (220,  2000  and  1000  μM  for  Bupropion,  hydroxybupropion  and  a  mix  of 
hydroxybuprion and erythrohydrobuproprion respectively).  
Neither Naltrexone (0.003-2.200 μM), nor 6β-naltrexone (0.08–60 μM) showed a clinically relevant 
potential for interference with the OCT2 uptake transporter. Naltrexone did not inhibit the human 
OCT2-mediated metformin uptake, and 6β-naltrexol showed only modest dose-dependent inhibitory 
effect at the highest concentration. The presented information regarding drug-drug interaction at the 
active drug transporter level is considered adequate and reveals that no interaction occurs at the 
primary active transporter of Bupropion (hOCT2). No interaction is therefore expected at the active 
carrier of hOCT2.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The  non-clinical  toxicology  of  Naltrexone  and  Bupropion  is  summarised  as  a  series  of  literature 
studies.  Supportive information is made from the summary of product characteristics (SmPCs) and 
from  the  prescribing  information  of  the  marketed  products,  Adepend®,  ReVia®,  Vivitrol®  and 
Wellbutin®. It cannot be verified from the publications that the published studies described conform to 
Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) standards. It also cannot be confirmed from the literature reports 
whether toxicity studies were conducted with the active pharmaceutical ingredients conforming to 
current standards and no information is provided in the publications with respect to the impurity or 
degradant profiles of batches/lots used. Only very few in vivo studies of more recent date included 
analysis of exposure/response relationships, so only limited toxicokinetic information is available for 
Naltrexone and Bupropion. 
It should be noted that none of the literature sources included estimates for the no adverse effect 
level (NOAEL), so where possible, NOAEL values for the data presented in the cited articles have been 
estimated by the Applicant.

2.3.4.1.  Naltrexone  
Single dose toxicity 
Single  dose  toxicity  studies  of  Naltrexone  were  conducted  in  several  species,  and  LD50  values 
following PO dosing were in the range of >1000 mg/kg (rat, mouse and monkey) and 130 mg/kg in 
dogs.  The  majority  of  clinical  signs  of  acute  toxicity  included  central  nervous  system  depression, 
retching/emesis, salivation, convulsions and death. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
In  a  two-year  chronic  rat  study  with  Naltrexone  administered  PO  (0,  10,  30 and  100  mg/kg/day; 
Braude and Morrison, 1976) a high spontaneous mortality rate (>50%) was found in both Naltrexone 
treated animals and controls. The cause of death in most animals was inflammatory lesions of the 
respiratory  system  due  to  chronic  murine  pneumonia  and  acute  bronchopneumonia,  resulting  in 
respiratory  failure.  Some  animals  had  acute  inflammatory  lesions  in  other  organs  which  were 
probably due to haematogenous dissemination of the infection from the lungs. The conclusion from 
the authors was that ‘no toxic signs that could be attributed to the test drug were found in the study’. 
However,  the  high  prevalence  of  murine  respiratory  disease  with  resultant  high  spontaneous 
mortality rates from around week 18, resulted in decreasing group sizes which further complicates 
statistical calculations and study validity.  The results from this study should therefore be used with 
caution, as the data are likely to be biased.  
In two repeat-dose studies of Naltrexone (90 d PO dogs and 90 d PO rat) described in Braude and 
Morrison  (1976),  increases  in  absolute  organ  weights  and/or  percent  of  body  weight  ratios  were 
described in the reference. It is not described which organs are involved, the number of animals/dose 
groups affected and the word ‘slight’ does not clarify any quantitative measure.  
In a 1-year oral toxicity study in monkeys with Naltrexone doses of 0, 6, 12, 24/18 and 72 mg/kg/day, 
Naltrexone  was  poorly  tolerated  in  the  initial  phase  of  dosing  for  most  doses.  This  was  due  to  a 
‘reaction syndrome’ which appeared in the initial phase of the study. The animals showed an appetite 
loss which resulted in a sharp decrease or halt in food consumption, followed by weight loss. The 
syndrome progressed to mucoid rhinitis, haemorrhagic colitis and respiratory infections – ultimately 
resulting in the death of the affected animals.  The study was re-designed to include removal of the 
high  dose  (72  mg/kg/day),  reduction  of  the  next  lower  dose  (from  24  to  18  mg/kg/day),  and 
institution of temporary dosing reductions and addition of a 12 mg/kg/day group with initial titration. 
It  was  concluded  that  repeated  dosing  in  monkeys  was  feasible  and  that  the  12  mg/kg/day  dose 
produced no adverse effects when initial dose titration was used.  
NOAEL´s following repeated administration of Naltrexone were estimated by the Applicant from the 
available literature as follows: 
Mouse: 3000 mg/kg (in feed, 90 days) 
Rat: 300 mg/kg (SC, 30 days); 70 mg/kg (PO, 90 days); 30 mg/kg (PO, 2y) 
Dog: 20 mg/kg (PO, 90 days); 10 mg/kg (SC, 30 days) 
Monkey: 126 mg/kg (PO, 3-7 days); 12 mg/kg (PO, 2 years); 20 (PO, 1 year) 
Genotoxicity 
Brusick et al (1978) thoroughly described the genotoxic potential of Naltrexone, by testing Naltrexone 
in a series of in vitro and in vivo tests. The test battery included tests for point mutations, TK+/- 
forward mutation in mouse lymphoma cells, assay for unscheduled DNA synthesis in WI-38 cells and 
chromosome damage, bone marrow cytogeneic analysis in rats and an assay in mice for detecting

heritable  translocations.  The  Authors  concluded  that  there  does  not  appear  to  be  any  significant 
genetic hazard associated with the use of Naltrexone in drug abuse treatment. This conclusion was 
reached, even though Naltrexone produced signs of positive results in some bacterial tests (e.g. E.coli 
and  S.  typhimurium  strain  TA-1538),  as  well  as  in  the  unscheduled  DNA  synthesis  test.  The 
genotoxicity  results  appear  to  be  best  reflected  in  the  Vivitrol  prescribing  information,  and  the 
Applicant has aligned the SmPC text accordingly.  
Carcinogenicity 
Some mechanistic studies reported in the literature have employed Naltrexone as a research tool. 
However,  contrasting  results  have  been  obtained,  where  in  one  study  Naltrexone  stimulated  cell 
proliferation  of  neuroblastoma  cells  (Zagon  and  McLaughlin,  1990),  whereas  in  another  study, 
Naltrexone reduced the incidence of tumours in a stress induced model of mammary tumourigenesis 
in rats (Tejwani et al, 1991). The latter result was supported by Koo et al (1996). The significance of 
these results has not been discussed further. This is however acceptable considering the additional 
supportive data below. 
As  supportive  to  the  above  literature  data,  the  Applicant  refers  to  the  ReVia®  product  labelling, 
describing  carcinogenicity  studies  of  Naltrexone  in  mice  and  rats.  The  original  literature  of  these 
studies  is  not  available  according  to  the  applicant.  However,  in  the  rat  study,  the  incidence  of 
mesotheliomas and vascular tumours was 6% (males, 100 mg/kg/day), reported to be slightly higher 
than the maximum historical incidence (4%).  
Reproduction Toxicity 
The  UK  SmPC  for  Naltrexone  hydrochloride  states  that  in  rats,  100  mg/kg  caused  a  significant 
increase in pseudo pregnancy and a decrease in the pregnancy rate at 100 mg/kg/day. A decrease in 
the pregnancy rate of mated female rats also occurred. The relevance of these observations to human 
fertility is not known (Adepend®).  
Fertility and early embryonic development was studied in rats (Christian et al., 1984). Animals were 
administered PO daily doses of 10, 30 or 100 mg/kg/day of Naltrexone for 63 days prior to mating and 
during  a  21-day  mating  period  (males)  or  for  14  days  prior  to  mating,  during  mating,  and  until 
termination (females). Treatment with ≥ 30 mg/kg Naltrexone resulted in excess grooming, hyper 
reactivity  and  hypersensitivity  (females  only),  and  increased  stillbirths.  100  mg/kg  Naltrexone 
increased  incidence  of  pseudo  pregnancy  and  decreased  fertility  as  well  as  transient  body  weight 
decreases were observed. The US prescribing information for Revia® also states that Naltrexone has 
been shown to increase the incidence of early foetal loss when given to rats at doses ≥ 30 mg/kg/day 
and  to  rabbits  at  oral  doses  ≥ 50  mg/kg/day.  There  was  no  evidence  of  teratogenicity  when 
Naltrexone was administered orally to rats and rabbits during the period of major organogenesis at 
doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (ReVia® prescribing information). 
Embryo-foetal development has been studied in rats and rabbits (Christian et al., 1984). Rats and 
rabbits were treated with 0, 20, 60 and 200 mg/kg Naltrexone from gestation day 6 to 15 and 18 (rat 
and rabbit respectively). Maternal toxicity consisted mainly of transiently decreased bodyweight gain, 
observed in both species in the high dose groups, but only in rats at 60 mg/kg/day. In all treated 
groups rats displayed hyper-reactivity and vocalisation, violent twisting of the body during dosing and 
chromorhinorrhoea in mid and high dose, and excess salivation, ptosis and red discharge from the 
mouth  and  convulsions  at  200  mg/kg.  In  rabbits,  non-significant  increased  foetal  resorption  was 
observed at 200 mg/kg/day. No other maternal toxicity, apart from the transiently decreased body 
weight gain in the  high dose group was observed in the rabbits. NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 
considered to be 20 and 200 mg/kg/day for rats and rabbits respectively. As no effects were observed 
in foetal parameters of the two studies, the foetal NOAEL was considered to be >200 mg/kg/day.

Local tolerance 
Since  Naltrexone  has  been  used  extensively  by  individuals  via  the  oral  route  for  many  years  at 
comparable  dose  levels  to  32  mg  Naltrexone  in  NB,  there  is  no  requirement  for  local  tolerance 
investigations. Furthermore, information on local tolerance in toxicity species has been provided for 
the individual drug substances and from clinical studies using NB. 
Other toxicity studies 
An  impurity    of  Naltrexone  was  identified  which  possesses  a  potentially  genotoxic  structural  alert 
feature, but was shown to be negative in the AMES Mutagenicity test. This impurity is controlled by a 
validated LC/MS analytical test method.  In addition to this impurity, other naltrexone impurities were 
negative in Ames tests. 
Naltrexone (30 mg/kg IP for 7 days) increases cell proliferation of basal epithelial cells of the cornea 
and other ocular tissues (Zagon et al. 2006). The proliferative effects of Naltrexone were, however, 
not termed pathologic or toxicological by the authors. Published literature on toxicity studies with 
Naltrexone provides no evidence of ocular toxicity. The clinical significance of this finding has not been 
discussed by the Applicant and this is acceptable as long as no such signs have been observed in the 
clinical setting. 
Cheng et al. (2009) reported that Naltrexone likely enters carcinoma cells by passive diffusion, and 
increases DNA synthesis. The clinical relevance of the observed increase in DNA synthesis is unclear. 
As rat carcinogenicity studies have demonstrated a slight increase in tumour formation compared to 
historical controls, it could be hypothesised that an increase in DNA synthesis by Naltrexone could be 
of clinical importance in development of neoplasm’s in humans, but the clinical risk of this is unknown. 
2.3.4.2.  Bupropion 
Single dose toxicity 
Single dose toxicity studies of Bupropion were conducted in mice with LD50 values 544-636 mg/kg 
and 273 mg/kg for PO and IP dosing, respectively. The LD50 values in rats were 482-607 mg/kg and 
263 mg/kg for PO and IP dosing, respectively. The majority of clinical signs of acute toxicity included 
ataxia,  clonic  convulsions,  prostration,  laboured breathing,  salivation,  arched  back  and  ptosis  and 
death. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats were reported for 12, 26 and 55 weeks duration. PO doses of 
25-450 mg/kg/day resulted in dose-related urinary incontinence, irritability, excessive salivation and 
intermittent convulsions (at doses of >200 mg/kg/day). At all dose levels, increased liver weights due 
to enzyme induction was found and increased relative kidney weights at 100 mg/kg/day was found in 
the 55-week study. No treatment-related effects were noted for haematology, clinical chemistry and 
urinalysis parameters, ophthalmological examination and gross and microscopic examination. NOAEL 
levels  were  estimated  by  the  Applicant  to  be  ≤150  mg/kg/day  (12-week  study),  100  mg/kg/day 
(26-week study) and ≤25 mg/kg/day (55-week study) and these levels are found to be reasonably 
estimated. 
NOAEL estimated in the 12-week study of 150 mg/kg/day resulted in significant toxicological signs in 
a  subsequent  52-week  study  in  dogs.  In  this  study,  NOAEL  was  estimated  to  be  40  mg/kg/day. 
Chronic  (52-week)  PO  administration  of  80-150  mg/kg/day  Bupropion  to  dogs  produced  mild, 
transient and reversible hepatotoxicity.

Genotoxicity 
No new genotoxicity studies for the NB combination have been made by the Applicant. Bupropion 
tested ‘borderline positive´ (1-3 times control mutation rate) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains in the Ames 
mutagenesis assay, however, the concentrations applied were not described. An increase was also 
found in chromosome damage at 300 mg/kg/day Bupropion (PO for 5 days) in a rat study.  
Carcinogenicity 
In carcinogenicity studies in mice, a dose-related increase in the incidence of dilated blood vessels in 
the uterus was found after PO dosing with Bupropion (50, 100 and 150 mg/kg/day for 96 weeks). No 
treatment-related effect on tumour incidence was found.  
In  a  rat  carcinogenicity  study,  PO  dosing  with  Bupropion  (100,  200  and  300  mg/kg/day  for  104 
weeks)  resulted  in  dose-related  increases  in  liver  weight,  hepatocellular  hypertrophy  and  focal 
nodular hyperplasia of hepatocytes at all dose levels.  
Reproduction toxicity  
Fertility and general reproduction was investigated in rats receiving Bupropion PO (100, 200 or 300 
mg/kg/day; Males: 60 days prior to mating and Females: 15 days prior to mating, through gestation 
and lactation). F1 offspring were mated. NOAEL for maternal toxicity was set to 100 mg/kg/day and 
no effects on fertility or reproductive parameters of the parent or offspring, the mated F1 generation 
or their offspring.  
In  an  embryo-fetal  development  study,  maternal  toxicity  of  Bupropion  occurred  at  doses  ≥300 
mg/kg/day (PO) in rats and at 100 and 150 mg/kg/day in rabbits. NOAEL´s for maternal toxicity were 
determined  to  be  150  and  50  mg/kg/day  in  rats  and  rabbits,  respectively.  No  clear  evidence  of 
teratogenic  activity  in  rats  or  rabbits  dosed  PO  up  to  450  mg/kg/day  and  150  mg/kg/day, 
respectively.  However,  in  rabbits  slightly  increased  incidences  of  fetal  malformations  and  skeletal 
variations were observed at greater than or equal to the lowest dose tested (25 mg/kg/day, 1.1-fold 
of the MRHD in NB).   
SC dosing of  Bupropion (5 and 10 mg/kg/day) to female Wistar rats 14 days  prior to mating and 
during pregnancy until weaning (PND21) was investigated by DeLong et al. (2013). There was no 
effect  of  either  dose  of  Bupropion  on  mating  or  pregnancy  success,  time  to  pregnancy,  gestation 
length, the live birth index, litter size, sex ratio, survival to PND4 or survival to weaning. Birth weight 
in the offspring of dams treated with 10 mg/kg was significantly reduced compared to controls (5.9 ± 
0.2  g  versus  6.7  ±  0.2  g;  p=0.02).  Bupropion  exposure  during  pregnancy  resulted  in  advanced 
vaginal opening (e.g. earlier pubertal onset) in the female F1 offspring, but only at the 10 mg/kg/day 
dose. At 6 months of age, no effects on time to pregnancy, gestation length, mating or pregnancy 
success,  live  birth  index,  litter  size  birth  weight,  sex  ratio,  postnatal  survival  to  either  PND4  or 
weaning were reported. The F2 offspring of females exposed to 10 mg/kg Bupropion in uterus and 
during  lactation  also  experienced  an  earlier  onset  of  puberty  (age  at  vaginal  opening)  relative  to 
control animals. The NOAEL for the offspring in the study was 5 mg/kg/day. No adverse maternal or 
reproductive effects were noted in the study at 5 or 10 mg/kg/day (DeLong et al., 2013). 
In  rats  receiving  Bupropion  (15  mg/kg/day  SC)  from  PND8  to  PND21,  sensory  and  social 
abnormalities were found.  
Local Tolerance  
Since Bupropion has been used extensively via the oral route over many years at comparable dose 
levels to 360 mg Bupropion in NB, there is no requirement for local tolerance investigations.

2-Bromo-3’-chloropropiophenone  (BCP)  has  been  identified  as  an  impurity  of  Bupropion.  BCP  was 
found to be mutagenic with S9 metabolic activation in the Ames test (up to 22- and 145-fold induction 
over  controls)  and  was  found  positive  in  the  in  vitro  micronucleus  assay  (3.3-5.1-fold  increase  in 
frequency  and  9.9-  and  7.4-increase  of  aneuploidies  without  and  with  S9,  respectively).  BCP  was 
found to induce formation of reactive oxygen species in TK6 cells.  
A  specification  of  NMT  4  ppm  was  set  based  on  the  genotoxic  potential  of  BCP  from  structural 
considerations. For a potentially genotoxic impurity, EMEA/CHMP/QWP/251344/2006 states a limit of 
NMT 1.5 μg/day, which based on the proposed Bupropion dosing regimen of 360 mg/day corresponds 
to  [(1.5)(106)]  /  [(360)(1000)]  =  4  ppm  2-bromo-3’-chloropropiophenone  which  is  found  to  be 
acceptable for the current application. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The proposed indication will entail an increase in the environmental concentration of both Naltrexone 
and Bupropion, as the approval of the combination therapy will be used in a different population to the 
already  approved  Bupropion  and  Naltrexone  respectively.  Buproprion  is  approved  as  an  aid  in 
smoking cessation at doses of 300 mg/day for  up to 7-9 weeks (Zyban), or as an antidepressant 
(Wellbutrin)  at  300  mg/day  (or  up  to  a  maximum  of  400  mg/day).  Naltrexone  is  approved  as  a 
treatment against alcoholism (Adepend) at 50 mg/day. As the approval of the NB combination is in a 
new population an increase in the use of both compounds, and consequently in the exposure of the 
environment, a new environmental assessment is required. The Applicant has initiated and completed 
studies for Bupropion, however, some studies remain to be performed. For Naltrexone the Applicant 
has not performed any studies yet, but has planned to perform studies, and the results will provide 
the basis for an environmental risk assessment. The calculated PECsurfacewater has been calculated 
based on Fpen based on predicted sales forecasts and the highest yearly expected sales (from year 7 
after approval).  
The Applicant proposes to perform an OECD 302 study to confirm that Bupropion is indeed inherently 
biodegradable, and hence if this study confirms the previously reported results, not perform an OECD 
308 study. This approach is not acceptable, as according to Q&A on the guideline on environmental 
risk assessment of medicinal products for human use (EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010) it is explicitly 
described that only a result from an OECD 301 that a compound is readily biodegradable, can be used 
to waive an OECD 308 study. Therefore, the Applicant is asked to perform an OECD 308 study if it 
cannot be determined that the Bupropion is ready biodegradable (by an OECD 301 study). In addition 
the Applicant is asked to conduct a bioaccumulation study according to OECD 305 in the Phase II 
assessment, as the logKow of Buproprion is 3.18 at pH 9 (e.g. above 3).  
Bupropion: No values are above the trigger, and no further analysis is required. However, the planned 
studies for Bupropion still need to be performed, and the results need to be assessed to establish if the 
new results will impact the Tier A assessment. 
Naltrexone: the environmental risk assessment cannot be completed at present, as the studies are 
not yet completed, and therefore no results are available. The Applicant should send the study reports 
and an updated ERA upon completion of the planned studies. 
Prior to the Applicant having performed and submitted the studies, a definite conclusion regarding the 
environmental risk assessment cannot be made. The Applicant should send the study reports and an 
updated ERA upon completion of the planned studies as part of a post approval commitment. 
As a result of the above considerations, the available data do not allow to conclude definitively on the 
potential risk of Naltrexone and Bupropion to the environment. Nevertheless, the available results are 
summarised below.

In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for further investigation : 
The Applicant is requested to perform all the planned studies for the environmental risk assessment 
for bupropion (e.g. OECD 106, 210 and 211) and naltrexone (OECD 106, 201, 209, 210, 211 and 301) 
as well as OECD 308 for both compounds, should the results from the respective OECD 301 studies 
deem this necessary. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The applicant provided literature data supplemented by non-clinical studies to support the non-clinical 
part of the application.  
The pharmacodynamic studies cited by the Applicant provide somewhat contradicting data on the 
anorexic  properties  of  Naltrexone.  This  may  be  reflected  in  several  issues,  e.g.  that  the  exact 
mechanism  of  action  of  Naltrexone  has  not  been  completely  elucidated,  the  end  point  reported  is 
Mysimba

mainly reduced food intake (transient) and not weight loss, and that no study is presented in this 
section with the specific aim of investigating the anorexic effects of Naltrexone (as e.g. Clapper et al., 
2013). In light of the anorexic effects demonstrated in the clinical studies with NB, the lack of new 
non-clinical studies is supported.  
The Applicant refers to the PD/PK and toxicology stated for Naltrexone in the SmPC of Nalorex® and 
Adepend®  and  for  Bupropion  in  the  Wellbutinin®  SmPC  and  prescribing  information  addition  to 
published literature on pharmacodynamic effects of both compounds. Generally, the data from the 
literature  of  Naltrexone  and  Bupropion  is  correct  and  comprehensive  and  support  the  current 
application and include a discussion on the studies that do not support the proposed indication. 
Cardiovascular effects of naltrexone and Bupropion have been investigated in several experimental 
systems, including hERG studies which so not show a concern.   
No new toxicity studies have been performed with the NB combination. The Applicant has provided a 
discussion regarding several factors relevant to the safety of the NB combination to elaborate on the 
lack of a bridging study with the NB combination. Based on this discussion, the lack of a 3-month 
repeat dose toxicity (bridging) study with the NB combination is accepted.  
The lack of any reproductive toxicity studies for the NB combination is acceptable, as literature data 
on the developmental toxicity of both compounds following monotherapy exists, and the use of NB 
combination in pregnancy is discouraged in the SmPC. 
The lack of any studies with NB on juvenile animals is acceptable as it is not planned to be used in 
children until further studies have been performed following development of a suited formulation. A 
PIP is approved by EMA and the details can be found in the following document on the EMA web page: 
P/0188/2013. 
The  toxicology  of  bupropion  is  described  by  the  applicant  based  on  literature  data  and  has  been 
appropriately discussed.  
Braude et al. (1976) is one of the major references used by the Applicant to describe the toxicology of 
Naltrexone. This paper summarises toxicological effects of Naltrexone in multiple study set-ups, in 
several animal species and approximately ten studies are described to varying degree. The paper 
gives a good overview of the toxicology of Naltrexone in different studies and animal species (rat, 
rabbit,  dog  and  monkey),  however,  the  description  of  toxicological  effects  seems  somewhat 
subjective and are not supported by references to the original work, e.g. materials, methods, number 
of  animals  (in  some  cases)  and  results  (tables  and  figures).  In  addition,  many  descriptions  of 
toxicological effects are un-precise, e.g. ‘a slight increase in a  few absolute organ weights and/or 
percent of body weight ratios’ and ‘minor abnormalities in the lungs’, where it is reasonable to ask: 
which organs and what kind of abnormalities, respectively. The information obtained from this source 
is, however, considered to be in line with other studies investigating toxicology of Naltrexone, and 
together with the large amount of clinical data on Naltrexone through the past years, the reference is 
considered acceptable for use in the current application for NB. 
Although  Naltrexone  has  been  used  clinically  for  many  years,  the  potential  of  NB  to  induce 
hepatotoxicity  in  chronic  treatment  cannot  be  ruled  out.  In  addition,  liver  changes  have  been 
described in animals after treatment with Bupropion (SPC NB p.17), so it is considered appropriate to 
keep the wording in the SPC for NB (p.3) that caution should be taken when  administering NB to 
individuals with hepatic impairment and that NB is contraindicated in individuals with severe hepatic 
disease.  
The genotoxicity of naltrexone is detailed in a publication and considered adequate. The amount of 
data describing the genotoxicity of Bupropion is somewhat small and the present application concerns 
a  chronic  treatment  regimen,  whereas  the  indication  for  Bupropion  as  monotherapy  is  of  shorter 
Mysimba

dosing  duration.  In  the  D120  response  to  the  LoQ,  the  Applicant  has  thoroughly  discussed  the 
potential genotoxic effects of bupropion in long-term treatment. It is acknowledged that the rat study 
showing chromosome damage (Tucker et al., 1987) is lacking in experimental detail and that other 
studies,  as  well  as  the  FDA  review  of  Zyban,  indicate  that  bupropion  at  single  doses  of  125-500 
mg/day  to  rats  does  not  induce  chromosome  damage.  This  is  strengthened  by  the  lack  of 
tumorigenicity in lifetime rodent carcinogenicity studies of bupropion.  Therefore this is acceptable to 
the CHMP. 
The  Applicant  presented  two  pre-  and  postnatal  development  studies  performed  in  rats.  Christian 
(1984) administered 0, 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg/day  PO from gestation day 15 whereas Farid et al 
(2012) implanted a sustained release implant subcutaneously which resulted in plasma exposure of 
0.3-9.7 ng/mL in the dams. In the first reference, no effects were observed on any litter parameters, 
but maternal body weight gain was decreased, transiently in the low dose group, but persistently so 
in  30  and  100  mg/kg/day.  Therefore  a  maternal  NOAEL  of  10  mg/kg/day  was  established  in  this 
study,  whereas  the  fetal  NOAEL  was  considered  to  be  >100  mg/kg/day.  The  study  by  Farid  et  al 
(2012) was designed to examine the effects of maternally administered sustained release Naltrexone 
in rats on offspring neurochemistry and behaviour in adulthood. The authors concluded that chronic 
low-dose  maternal  Naltrexone  delivered  via  a  sustained  release  implant  impacts  behaviour  and 
neurochemistry in adult offspring, without obvious morphological effects. Compared to placebo, basal 
motor activity of Naltrexone-exposed adult offspring was lower, yet showed enhanced development of 
psychomotor sensitisation to morphine. The discrepancy between Christian (1984) not discovering 
any detrimental effects to the embryo-fetal development and Farid et al (2012) establishing that even 
low dose chronic exposure of the fetus will result in lasting effects on the offspring, highlights the need 
for specific studies when the compound has effects in the CNS. The SmPC text currently states that NB 
is  not  recommended  during  pregnancy,  which  is  considered  appropriate  given  the  contradicting 
results of the abovementioned studies.  
In summary, the  applicant´s approach to perform only 3 nonclinical studies in support of the current 
application is acceptable, as there is sufficient relevant literature that can provide evidence that the 
combination of Naltrexone and Bupropion in the new proposed indication is efficacious and safe.  
The fact that both compounds are approved and have been used clinically for a number of years is 
reassuring,  as  the  safety  profile  of  each  drug  is  well  known  and  can  provide  further  supportive 
evidence to the non-clinical data. However, the drugs have not been used in combination, or in the 
proposed indication for management of obesity and weight-loss and maintenance of weight-loss.

From a non-clinical perspective, Naltrexone/Bupropion can be approved.

*Age ranges provided here reflect the actual age ranges enrolled in each study. 
** The subjects in these treatment groups crossed over to combination treatment during the extension phase. 
The  analytical  methods  used  for  the  drug  analyses,  the  pharmacokinetic  data  analyses  and  the 
applied statistical methods are generally considered to be sufficient and justifiable. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
•  Absorption 
Following  single  oral  administration  to  healthy  subjects  of  the  NB  formulation  intended  to  be 
marketed, Tmax of naltrexone and bupropion was approximately 2 and 3 hours, respectively.  
The Tmax and Cmax values reflected the prolonged release properties of the formulation.  
A  different  formulation  was  used  in  Phase  2  compared  to  Phase  3,  both  with  regard  to  release 
properties  (Immediate  Release  naltrexone  versus  Prolonged  Release  naltrexone)  and  strength 
(bupropion). Consequently, there is no bioequivalence link between Phase 2 and 3. However, none of 
the Phase 2 studies can be considered to be pivotal.  
The  Applicant  has  provided  upon  request  a  discussion  on  the  impact  of  the  formulation  on  the  
stereoselective metabolism of bupropion. It is accepted that a change in the absorption rate could 
potentially alter the exposure of the different enantiomers of bupropion and it metabolites.  However, 
historical information shows that the release rate has minimal impact on the bioavailability, which 
would not be expected if there was a significant change in the ratio of the two enantiomers.  Thus, it 
is not considered that chiral assays are required. 
The formulations for the Phase 3 studies were produced by different manufacturers at different sites. 
Full bioequivalence links have not been established between all the formulations used in Phase III and 
the formulation intended for the market. The Applicant was asked to provide more information about 
the extent of the use of the non-bioequivalent tablets and discuss the implications for the results of 
the Phase 3 studies where they have been used. The requested information has now been provided, 
and it is concluded that the results of studies NB-302 and NB-304 (where not all the formulations used 
was bioequivalent with the commercial formulation) are not biased in favour of NB due to differences 
in formulations. Further, the efficacy results are further substantiated by studies NB-301 and NB-303 
where the commercial formulation was used exclusively.

Food effect 
The combined results of the studies investigating food interactions showed a quite pronounced effect 
of food, in particular in terms of naltrexone exposure. The food effect appeared to be somewhat more 
pronounced with high-fat meals and to diminish with multiple dosing. In the Phase 3 studies, patients 
were  advised  to  take  the  study  medication  with  food.  Therefore,  it  is  likely  that  the  safety  (and 
efficacy) implications of the food effect are captured to a large extent in these studies.  
The section 4.2 in the SmPC is considered adequate as it is stated that NB should preferably be taken 
with food. This is supported since patients were advised to take NB with food in the Phase 3 studies 
(although not in the ongoing NB-CVOT study).  
Metabolism 
Naltrexone 
is  mainly  metabolized  to  the  active  metabolite  6β-naltrexol  by  dihydrodiol 
dehydrogenases  (DD1,  DD2  and  DD4).  Other  major  metabolic  routes  are  the  formation  of  the 
metabolites  2-hydroxy-3-O-methyl  naltrexone  and  2-hydroxy-3-Omethyl-6β-naltrexol,  believed  to 
be  mediated  by  catechol-O-methyl  transferases  (COMT),  and  glucuronidation,  thought  to  be 
mediated by UGT1A1 and UGT2B. 
The potency of 6β-naltrexol is generally considered less than that of naltrexone, but is thought to 
contribute to efficacy because it reaches higher concentrations in plasma than naltrexone. Following 
single doses of NB tablets, the terminal elimination half-life of naltrexone was approximately 5 hours. 
Following single doses of NB tablets, the terminal elimination half-life of bupropion was approximately 
21 hours. However, the pharmacologically active metabolites have considerably longer half-lives. 
Bupropion is extensively metabolized in humans. There are 3 major active circulating metabolites: 
hydroxybupropion and the amino-alcohol isomers threohydrobupropion and erythrohydrobupropion.  
Following single dose, total systemic exposure (AUC) of hydroxybupropion was approximately 12-fold 
that of the parent drug, threohydrobupropion and erythrohydrobupropion were approximately 4.5- 
and 0.8-fold that of the parent drug.   
The  enzymatic  reactions  responsible  for  bupropion  metabolism  are  not  completely  understood.  
CYP2B6 is known to be mainly responsible for oxidation of bupropion to hydroxybupropion in humans.  
Published data indicate that 11β-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase 1 is the major enzyme responsible 
for  threohydrobupropion  formation.    The  metabolic  pathway  responsible  for  the  formation  of 
erythrohydrobupropion  metabolite  is  unknown.  In  addition  the  metabolic  pathway  leading  to  the 
formation  of  the  m-Chlorohippuric  acid  metabolite  is  also  unknown.  However,  it  likely  involves 
non-CYP450 metabolic isozymes.   
Elimination 
In  humans  naltrexone  and  its  metabolic  products  are  primarily  excreted  in  urine.  After  oral 
administration, approximately 37 to 60% of the total dose is excreted in urine within 48 to 72 hrs, 
mainly as conjugated and unconjugated forms of naltrexone and 6β-naltrexol. 
The  major  elimination  pathway  of  bupropion  appears  to  be  oxidation  of  the  bupropion  side  chain 
which results in the formation of a glycine conjugate of m-chlorobenzoic acid, which is then excreted 
as the major urinary metabolite.  
Bupropion  metabolites  are  predominantly  excreted in  urine  (87%)  with  a  lesser  amount  in  faeces 
(10%).  
Upon request, the Applicant provided an detailed overview of the metabolite profile and excretion 
pathways of bupropion and naltrexone. The SmPC summarise the elimination pathways and provides 
a warning that inhibitors or inducers of UGT 1A2 and 2B7 may alter the exposure of naltrexone.

Genetic polymorphism 
Genetic  polymorphism  appear  not  be  relevant  for  the  pharmacokinetics  of  naltrexone  and 
6β-naltrexol. 
One particular genotype (CYP2B6*4 variant) is not uncommon and appear to be associated with an 
increased biotransformation of bupropion to hydroxybupropion. Since both the parent compound and 
the  metabolite  are  pharmacologically  active,  the  clinical  implications  are  difficult  to  judge.  The 
Applicant  provided  an  adequate  discussion  on  the  possible  effect  of  the  CYP2B6*4  variant  on 
bupropion and hydroxybupropion concentrations as well as possible clinical consequences, if any. The 
frequency of the allele is not trivial, but based on the overall efficacy, safety and tolerability profile of 
NB, it appears excessive to require CYP2B6 genotyping in relation to NB therapy. 
Dose proportionality, steady state exposure and PK variability 
Very  limited  investigations  of  dose  proportionality  for  naltrexone  did  not  reveal  indications  of 
significant deviations from dose proportionality in the 8-16 mg range. The Applicant has presented 
further analyses for Cmax which appears to show linearity across the dose range of 8 to 200 mg. This 
is considered reassuring. 
The Applicant was requested also to further discuss the steady state exposure of bupropion and its 
major  metabolites  with  NB  when  compared  to  bupropion  in  other  indications.  The  provided  data 
suggested that the steady state exposure of bupropion and metabolites with NB at maintenance dose 
is higher than with bupropion when administered as mono-component used for depression and as 
smoking  cessation  agent.  This  was  considered  acceptable  since  adverse  events  associated  with 
bupropion, in particular seizures, appeared not to be more frequent with NB than with bupropion in its 
licensed indications. 
The between subjects pharmacokinetic variability for naltrexone is quite pronounced with %CV values 
often exceeding 60% for Cmax and AUC. 
 The within-subject variability for Cmax and AUC is moderate for both naltrexone and bupropion, with 
%CV values in the range of approximately 10-16%. 
Naltrexone  exposure  was  somewhat  lower  in  obese  subjects  compared  to  non-obese  subjects. 
However,  given  the  high  between  subjects  variability,  there  was  a  huge  overlap  between  the  two 
groups. 
Special populations 
The  PK  data  in  special  populations  generated  with  NB  as  well  as  the  individual  components  are 
relatively scarce - despite the fact that naltrexone and bupropion have been marketed for many years 
as individual medicines. 
•  Renal impairment 
There is no experience with NB in renal impairment in the Phase 3 programme, although there is some 
experience in the ongoing CVOT study. Limited experience with each individual component indicates 
marked increases in exposure of both naltrexone and bupropion in moderate renal impairment. The 
Applicant  initially  proposed  a  SmPC  which  recommended  a  reduced  frequency  and/or  dose  for 
consideration  in  patients  with  renal  impairment  (except  end-stage  renal  impairment  where  a 
contraindication  was  proposed).  However,  there  are  no  clinical  data  to  support  a  lower  dose  or  a 
reduced frequency of NB in weight management. Upon discussion during the procedure, the Applicant 
has agreed that the SmPC should state that NB is contraindicated in severe renal impairment and not 
recommended in patients with moderate renal impairment. This is supported by the CHMP .

EMA/805547/2015

For  both  NB-treated  and  placebo-treated  patients,  the  frequency  of  serious  adverse  events  and 
adverse  events  leading  to  study  drug  discontinuation  increased  with  decreasing  renal  function. 
Further, for some adverse events (gastrointestinal in particular), the increase with decreasing renal 
function  was  higher  in  NB-treated  patients  than  in  the  placebo  group.  Even  though  the 
placebo-subtracted incidence of some adverse events was higher even in mild renal impairment than 
in  patients  with  normal  renal  function,  the  difference  to  patients  with  intact  renal  function  is  not 
considered to be of a magnitude that warrants a non-recommendation for patients with mild renal 
impairment. In these patients, the SmPC recommends no need for drug adjustment but assessment 
of  eGFR  should  be  performed  prior  to  initiating  therapy  in  patients  at  elevated  risk  for  renal 
impairment (in particular patients with diabetes or elderly). 
•  Hepatic impairment 
There is no experience with NB in hepatic impairment. Studies in severe hepatic impairment with each 
individual component show multi-fold increases in exposure of both naltrexone and bupropion. This 
justifies the proposed contraindication in severe hepatic impairment. There is apparently very little 
information on oral naltrexone in mild and moderate hepatic impairment. Mild or moderate hepatic 
impairment seems to increase the exposure of bupropion and hydroxybupropion and to increase the 
PK variability.  
The SmPC states that NB is not recommended in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. 
The clinical feasibility of restricting use to patients with normal liver function, and no worse than mild 
kidney function in the co-morbid obese population was discussed with the applicant. 
In  addition,  the    use  of  NB  in  renally  and  hepatically  impaired  patients  will  be  addressed  in  the 
post-authorisation setting in multiple dose PK studies in patients with hepatic and renal impairment. 
•  Gender 
Exposure to both naltrexone and bupropion appears to be moderately higher in females than in males. 
•  Race 
The data on the effect of race indicating only small effects are limited by the fact that only Caucasian 
and Black subjects contributed significantly with PK data.  
• 
Elderly 
Pharmacokinetic data with NB in elderly is very limited. There is also limited PK data in elderly with the 
individual components. Historical data suggest a modest effect of age on the PK of naltrexone and 
moderately  reduced  bupropion  clearance  in  elderly  and  increased  accumulation  of  bupropion  and 
metabolites. The Applicant proposed to introduce a cautionary statement for patients over 65 years 
and a non-recommendation for patients over 75 years in section 4.2 of the SmPC. This is supported.  
•  Children 
There is apparently no PK data available on naltrexone in children and only limited experience with 
bupropion. NB is only proposed for use in adults. A statement is introduced in the SmPC about the 
efficacy and safety not being established in children and adolescents above 18.  
Drug drug interactions  
Overall,  the  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  programme  performed  to  address  drug-drug  interactions  is 
acceptable.  
The Applicant was asked to further address the time dependency of naltrexone inhibition of CYP2C19. 
While there was a slight increase in the degree of inhibition of CYP2C19 by naltrexone following a 
Mysimba  
Assessment Report 
EMA/805547/2015 
Page 42/132 
  
 
pre-incubation, the fact that this inhibition was observed only at the highest dose tested and was 
relatively modest means that this inhibition is unlikely to be clinically relevant. 
A discussion of the effect of bupropion on metformin exposure was also requested. Analyses from the 
clinical  studies  NB-CVOT  and  NB-304  did  not  indicate  an  increased  metformin  exposure  when 
metformin  was  administered  with  NB,  judged  by  the  lack  of  lactate  acidosis  and  hypoglycaemia 
events in the clinical studies. 
A number of clinical DDI studies have been undertaken by the Applicant. 
There  are  no  suggestions  of  any  PK  interaction  between  naltrexone  and  bupropion.  A  number  of 
clinically relevant PK interactions with NB have been identified. They have now been well reflected in 
the SmPC. 
In conclusion, the pharmacokinetic evaluation of NB is considered acceptable.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Naltrexone  is  a  specific,  long-acting  competitive  antagonist  at  opioid  receptors.  Its  primary 
metabolite, 6β-naltrexol, has similar pharmacological activity, although with a lower potency. 
Bupropion  is  a  selective  inhibitor  of  the  neuronal  re-uptake  of  catecholamines  (noradrenaline  and 
dopamine).  Bupropion  has  three  basic  metabolites,  hydroxybupropion,  threohydrobupropion  and 
erythrohydrobupropion, which also exhibit pharmacological activity. 
The proposed mechanism of action in management of weight is considered plausible. 
Two PET studies investigated opioid receptor occupancy with naltrexone to support the investigated 
naltrexone doses as part of the NB fixed dose combination in the NB-201 Phase 2 study. An fMRI study 
provided supportive evidence for pursuing development of NB in management of weight. 
The  dose-response  investigations  with  regard  to  naltrexone  are  based  on  both  pharmacodynamic 
studies and a larger-scale Phase 2 study of longer duration with clinical endpoints. The selection of 
naltrexone doses for the confirmatory studies anchored around the NB32 dose but also investigating 
NB16 and to some extent NB48 is supported. 
The Applicant has also justified the dose of 360 mg for bupropion. 
The CHMP originally considered that the proposed fixed dose combination had not been adequately 
investigated in terms of superiority over the mono components and asked the Applicant to provide 
further justification. This issue was raised due to a concern that the therapeutic contribution of each 
individual component at the exact dose used in the combination was not clearly shown relative to the 
combination.  The  Applicant  has  justified  this  by  reiterating  the  rationale  for  the  combination, 
reviewing the results of study NB201, and by detailing the PK and PD data used to bridge the Phase 
2 dose combinations to the doses and formulations used in Phase 3. 
There  is  no  non-clinical  signal  suggesting  a  potential  for  QTc  prolongation.  Neither  bupropion  nor 
naltrexone  has  historically  been  associated  with  prolongation  of  QTc  interval.  The  clinical  studies 
conducted with NB do not indicate that NB causes QTc increases. Hence, the omission of a thorough 
QTc study is considered acceptable. 
In  the  PK/PD  analyses,  weight  loss  was  shown  to  occur  across  a  wide  range  of  naltrexone  and 
bupropion  exposure  levels.  For  some  efficacy  endpoints,  improvements  tended  to  be  greater  with 
increasing exposure. No exposure-response relationship was shown for any of the investigated safety 
and tolerability parameters.

Given  the  reports  of  neuropsychiatric  events  with  bupropion  and  alcohol,  it  is  appropriate  to 
recommend that intake of alcohol should be limited or avoided during treatment with NB. This is in line 
with the recommendations given in the bupropion SmPC. Thus, the proposed recommendation that 
consumption of alcohol should be minimised or avoided is supported. 
Considering  the  mechanism  of  action  for  bupropion,  further  discussion  about  potential 
pharmacodynamic interactions with serotonergic agents (also including other drug classes than SSRIs 
and TCAs, e.g. SNRIs) was requested. Based on adverse events data presented by the Applicant, it is 
concluded that there is no firm evidence to indicate pharmacodynamic interactions between NB and 
SSRI/SNRIs.  MAO  inhibitors  are  contraindicated  due  to  their  propensity  to  enhance  the 
catecholaminergic pathways.  
The  influence  of  A118G  polymorphism  was  not  investigated  in  the  NB  weight  management 
programme.  It  cannot  be  excluded  that  it  may  be  of  significance  and  could  explain  some  of  the 
variability in the response to NB. However, it is likely to be only one of several intrinsic and extrinsic 
factors, which contribute to the weight loss associated with NB. No specific precautions are deemed 
necessary with regard to A118G polymorphism. 
In conclusion, the pharmacodynamic evaluation of NB is considered acceptable. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The Applicant was requested to explain the rationale for the development of a prolonged release 
formulation of naltrexone. The Applicant demonstrated that the receptor occupancy of naltrexone is 
not higher following similar doses of immediate release compared to controlled release. Therefore, 
the lower Cmax does not appear to impact on the degree of receptor occupancy and therefore 
efficacy. This explanation is considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
A large part of the clinical pharmacology documentation is based on historical data on the already 
marketed individual monocomponents. 
The  pharmacodynamics  and  phamacokinetics  of  NB  have  been  sufficiently  investigated  by  the 
Applicant. The pharmacokinetics of NB in patients with renal and hepatic impairment has not yet been 
fully investigated, but this will be addressed in the post-marketing setting, and the current warnings 
and contraindications in the label are acceptable.  All questions raised during the assessment have 
been sufficiently addressed and reflected in the proposed post-authorisation studies included in the 
RMP (multiple dose PK studies in patients with hepatic and renal impairment).  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
No major objections have been identified with respect to the clinical pharmacology programme, and 
other concerns have been resolved. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The Applicant states that all trials have been conducted in compliance with GCP. No observations have 
been made during the assessment of the dossier indicating significant GCP non-compliance.

2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
  Study OT-101 
Study  OT-101  was  a  Phase  2  multicentre,  randomised,  placebo-controlled  and  monotherapy 
(naltrexone 50 mg and bupropin 300 mg) controlled proof of concept study to assess the safety and 
efficacy of combination therapy (immediate release naltrexone 50 mg daily and bupropion PR 300 mg 
daily) in subjects with uncomplicated obesity. The treatment period was 16 weeks and there was an 
optional 32 week extension period. For the extension period, subjects on placebo or naltrexone (N) 50 
mg  alone  were  placed  on  open-label  therapy  with  naltrexone  50  mg/bupropion  PR  150  mg  BID 
(N50/B300).  
Study OT-101 evaluated the efficacy and safety of the combination treatment with bupropion and 
naltrexone compared to the mono-components alone and placebo. It is assumed that the combination 
therapy  should  be  more  efficacious  than  the  monotherapy,  i.e.  Nal50/B300  should  be  better  than 
Nal50 and B300 alone. This was however not the case in Study OT-101 as bupropion 300 mg alone 
was not statistically significant different from Nal50/B300 for the LS mean percent change in total 
body weight at week 16 LOCF and the study was stopped early around the 24-week assessment.  
The LS mean percent change in total body weight from baseline to Week 16 LOCF was -4.0% in the 
N50/B300 group. The LS mean percent change in total body weight from baseline to Week 16 LOCF in 
the other three treatment groups, and the p-values for their contrast of the weight loss compared with 
the N50/B300 group, were as follows: B300: -3.6% (p=0.274); N50: -2.0% (p=0.005); and placebo: 
-1.0% (p <0.001).  
The  analyses  of  the  completers  analysis  set  differed  from  the  analyses  in  the  full  analysis  set 
principally by the larger adjusted LS mean percent change in total body weight from baseline to Week 
16 for the treatment group N50/B300 (-4.8%). 
A completer’s analysis suggested a greater weight loss in the combination group compared to the 
monotherapies and placebo when treated for longer time. 
  Study NB-201 
Study  NB-201  was  a  Phase  2  multicentre, 
randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-  and 
monotherapy-controlled study with a treatment period of 24 weeks (primary) and an extension period 
of  24 weeks.  Subjects  were  non  smoking  with  uncomplicated  obesity  (BMI  ≥  30  and  ≤40)  and 
enrolled in two cohorts. Cohort 1 included 5 groups: placebo, N48, B400, N16/B400, and N48/B400. 
Cohort 2 consisted of two groups: placebo and N32/B400. Subjects were only randomised into Cohort 
2 after each site’s enrollment in Cohort 1 was completed. The statistical analysis plan was amended, 
prior  to  unblinding  of  either  cohort,  to  permit  an  integrated  dose-response  assessment  of  the 
combination naltrexone doses studied across cohorts.  
After Week 24, subjects in the placebo and immediate release naltrexone 48 mg monotherapy groups 
who chose to continue study participation in the 24 week open-label extension were crossed over to 
receive treatment with immediate release naltrexone 32 mg administered with bupropion PR 400 mg 
(N32/B400). The primary endpoint for the study was assessed at Week 24. 
With  both  the  doses  of  N16/B400  and  N32/B400,  the  weight  loss  after  24  weeks  was  statistically 
significantly different compared to placebo, N48 and B400 alone. However, this was not the case with 
the higher dose of N48/B400, which was not statistically significant better than placebo and the 2 
mono-components. The mean weight loss is presented in Figure 2.7.3-3.

The dose-finding study NB-201 showed that the two doses N16/B400 and N32/B400 yielded similar 
weight losses at 24 weeks in uncomplicated obesity patients.

The dose selection was also based on three published randomised controlled trials with bupropion PR 
in  patients  with  obesity  demonstrating  greater  weight  loss  than  placebo,  and  that  doses  of  300 
mg/day  or  400  mg/day  of  bupropion  PR  were  well  tolerated  (Gadde  2001;  Anderson  2002;  Jain 
2002).  Three  published  randomised  controlled  trials  with  naltrexone  in  patients  with  obesity, 
however,  did  not  demonstrate  clinically  significant  weight  loss  (Atkinson  1985;  Malcolm  1985; 
Mitchell 1987). 
N16/B360 was evaluated also in study NB-301 and N48/B360 in study NB-303. In the description of 
the Phase 3 studies, these doses are referred to as NB32, NB16 and NB48, respectively. 
CHMP comments 
Considering the results of Study NB-201, it is agreed that there is a rationale for combination therapy 
with  naltrexone  and  bupropion  since  the  combinations  N16B400  and  N32B400  showed  superior 
efficacy over each of the individual components N48 and B400.  
It  is  considered  acceptable  that  the  tablet  formulation  and  doses  used  in  Study  NB-201  are  not 
identical to the ones used in the Phase 3 programme.  
The Applicant chose to proceed with the intermediate dose N32/B360 for the Phase 3 trials which is 
also the recommended dose.  
The dose-response investigations with regard to naltrexone and the naltrexone doses carried into the 
Phase 3 programme are supported. It is also supported that daily bupropion doses higher than 400 
mg was not investigated given the risk of seizures.  
2.5.1.  Main studies 
The applicant submitted four pivotal studies NB-302, NB-302, NB-303, and NB-304 supporting the 
indication in weight management.  
2.5.1.1.  General features 
For  practical  reasons,  some  common  features  regarding  design,  efficacy  endpoints  and  statistical 
analyses for the rather similar pivotal trials will be discussed in this introduction. Subsequently, each 
study  will  be  presented  individually.  The  Quality  of  Life  results  will  be  reviewed  jointly  after  the 
presentation and review of the individual studies. 
Methods and Study Participants  
The  NB  Phase  3  programme  included  four  pivotal,  multicentre,  randomised,  double-blind, 
placebo-controlled studies (Study NB-301; Study NB-302; Study NB-303; and Study NB-304). Across 
these  studies,  the  efficacy,  safety  and  tolerability  of  NB  were  evaluated  in  obese  and  overweight 
subjects receiving customary diet and behavioural counselling, including prescribed exercise (Studies 
NB-301 and NB-303) and  in obese/overweight subjects undergoing intensive lifestyle modification 
counselling (Study NB-302).  
One study was conducted in obese/overweight subjects with type 2 diabetes (Study NB-304).  
Studies NB-301, NB-302 and NB-303 enrolled subjects with a BMI ≥30 and ≤45 kg/m2 for subjects 
with uncomplicated obesity and with a BMI of ≥27 and ≤45 kg/m2 for overweight or obese subjects 
with controlled hypertension and/or dyslipidaemia.  
One of the four pivotal studies (Study NB-301) included a sub-study in which subjects underwent 
body  composition  analysis  and  visceral  fat  measurement  at  baseline  and  after  approximately 
Mysimba  
Assessment Report 
EMA/805547/2015 
Page 47/132 
  
 
52 weeks of therapy, while another (Study NB-303) included a sub-study in which blood pressure was 
measured over a 24-hour period at baseline, and after approximately 24 and 52 weeks of therapy. 
Treatments 
All four studies investigated a daily dose of naltrexone 32 mg PR combined with bupropion 360 mg PR 
(NB32). 
Studies  NB-301  and  NB-303  also  investigated  other  doses  of  naltrexone,  while  the  dose  of  the 
bupropion components remained the same. 
Study NB-301 investigated two different doses of naltrexone PR, namely 16 mg and 32 mg, combined 
with  bupropion  360  mg  PR,  and  in  study  NB-303  NB32  subjects  could  be  re-randomised  at  the 
beginning of Week 28 through Week 44, to receive naltrexone PR 48 mg combined with bupropion 360 
mg PR. 
The ancillary therapy consisted of diet instruction, behaviour modification advice and physical activity 
suggestions.  The  hypocaloric  diet  of  a  deficit  of  500  kcal/  day  based  on  the  WHO  algorithm  for 
calculation  of  resting  metabolic  was  outlined.  Furthermore,  a  prescription  for  walking  at  least  30 
minutes three times (study NB-303 and NB-304) or most days of the week study NB-301). In Study 
NB-302, a more intensive behaviour modification programme was prescribed including more physical 
exercise. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Treatment effects were evaluated using a two-sided significance level of 0.05. The primary efficacy 
endpoints were (1) percent change from baseline to endpoint in body weight and (2) the proportion of 
subjects achieving ≥ 5% weight loss at endpoint.  
In all studies except Study NB-303, the primary endpoint was assessed at Week 56. In Study NB-303, 
data were analysed at the Week 28 primary endpoint (prior to re-randomisation), analyses of weight 
loss at Week 56 were a secondary endpoint.  
In the NB-303 study, subjects on NB32 who had not achieved at least a 5% decrease from baseline in 
body weight at Week 28 were re-randomised to either continue on NB32 or to receive a higher dose 
NB48. Subjects on NB32 not previously re-randomised who did not maintain at least 5% of baseline 
body  weight  during  Weeks  32-44  were  also  re-randomised  at  those  visits.  Subjects  were  only 
re-randomised once 
Efficacy endpoints 
All four studies employed the FDA recommended primary endpoints of mean and categorical changes 
from baseline in body weight following 1 year of treatment, as well as various pre-specified secondary 
endpoints such as the proportion of subjects who achieved ≥ 10% decrease from baseline in body 
weight  and  changes  in  waist  circumference  and  lipids.  Per  FDA  Guidance,  efficacy  can  be 
demonstrated by achieving one of the two primary endpoints.   
Based  on  CHMP  recommendations  (CHMP/EWP/281/96/Rev.  1),  the  primary  demonstration  of 
efficacy should be based on the difference in mean weight loss from baseline in the active treatment 
group of at least 10%, and also at least 5% greater than that seen with placebo. The guideline also 
indicates that an alternative means of demonstrating efficacy could be based on having a significantly 
greater proportion of subjects who lose more than 10% of their baseline body weight in the active 
treatment group compared with placebo. 
The  following  FDA-recommended  primary  efficacy  endpoints  were  employed  for  the  four  Phase  3 
studies:

The percent change from baseline in body weight at Week 56 (Last Observation Carried Forward 
[LOCF]) for Studies NB-301, NB-302, and NB-304 and at Week 28 (LOCF) for Study NB-303. 
The proportion of subjects who achieved ≥ 5% decrease from baseline body weight at Week 56 
(LOCF) for studies NB-301, NB-302, and NB-304 and at Week 28 (LOCF) for study NB-303.

Statistical methods 
Unless otherwise specified, efficacy analyses were conducted on the full analysis set or the completers 
analysis  set.  The  full  analysis  set  (a  modification  of  the  intent-to-treat  principle)  included  all 
randomised subjects who had a baseline weight measurement and at least one post-baseline weight 
measurement while on study drug (i.e., active treatment or placebo). For Studies NB-301, NB-303, 
and  NB-304,  Week  56  completers  included  all  randomised  subjects  who  had  a  baseline  weight 
measurement, a post-baseline weight measurement, and who completed 56 weeks of treatment. For 
Study  NB-303,  Week  28  Completers  included  all  randomised  subjects  who  had  a  baseline  weight 
measurement, a post-baseline weight measurement and who completed 28 weeks of treatment. For 
Study NB 302, completers included all randomised subjects who had a baseline weight measurement 
and a post-baseline weight measurement at Week 56 while on study drug. In all summaries, subjects 
were grouped according to their randomised treatment group assignment. The analyses presented in 
this document focus on changes in efficacy measurements from baseline to endpoint.  
Baseline was defined as the last non-missing measurement before, or at the time of, randomisation. 
Endpoint was defined as the last non-missing post-baseline weight measurement while on study drug 
(last observation carried forward [LOCF]). Efficacy assessments performed within 1 day after the last 
dose date were considered valid.

 Each  study  was  designed  to  control  for  multiplicity  and  maintain  a  5%  false  positive  rate  for  the 
hypothesis testing of the primary and secondary endpoints. The analysis of the secondary efficacy 
endpoints  required  both  primary  endpoints  to  be  significant  and  was  structured  in  a  sequential, 
hierarchical manner referred to as a CTP. The sequential order differed slightly in each study protocol. 
Among other secondary endpoints, the analysis of the proportion of subjects with ≥ 10% decrease in 
total body weight from baseline (10% responders) was planned in the SAP of the four Phase 3 studies. 
In general, continuous change from baseline to endpoint variables were analysed using an analysis of 
covariance  (ANCOVA)  model.  Unless  otherwise  specified,  the  model  contained  the  main  effects  of 
treatment  and  study  centre  with  the  baseline  measurement  as  the  covariate.  Unless  otherwise 
specified, categorical variables at endpoint were analysed using a linear logistic regression model, 
which included effects for treatment and study centre as the main effects, with baseline measurement 
as the covariate. 
In addition to the completers analyses, other sensitivity analyses  were conducted in the following 
analysis sets: 
• 
• 
• 
the full analysis set using a repeated measures mixed effects model;  
the ITT analysis set using the last available data in the double-blind treatment phase and using a 
repeated  measures  mixed  effects  model;  the  ITT  analysis  set  included  all  subjects  who  were 
randomised,  had  a  baseline  weight  measurement  and  had  at  least  one  post-baseline  weight 
measurement during the defined treatment phase, irrespective of being on study drug at the time 
of the post-baseline measurement; 
the  all  randomised  analysis  set  subjects  imputing  the  baseline  value  for  subjects  who 
discontinued prior to Week 56 (BOCF) and weight regain imputation methods (Sacks 2009). 
CHMP comments 
Despite the fact that the responder criterion employed in the co-primary endpoint (≥ 5% decrease) is 
not  concordant  with  the  CHMP-recommended  (≥10%),  the  ≥10%  criterion  is  included  as 
pre-specified secondary endpoint. This is acceptable to the CHMP. 
The primary and secondary endpoints are considered adequate to evaluate the efficacy of a medicine 
in weight control. 
The study designs are acceptable with regard to randomisation, blinding and treatment duration. 
None of the pivotal studies include an active reference. Orlistat is the only weight control medicine 
widely  available  in  the  EU.  This  medicine  is  associated  with  very  common  adverse  reactions  of  a 
distinct, gastrointestinal nature (such as flatus with discharge, faecal urgency and fatty oily stool) 
which makes it difficult to blind this medicine if included as an active reference. For this reason, the 
omission of an active reference is acceptable.  
The primary analysis is based on the full analysis set (FAS) and using LOCF as imputation method for 
missing  data.  However,  given  the  high  drop-out  rate  (about  half  of  the  patients  discontinued 
prematurely),  the  sensitivity  analyses  have  an  important  role  in  substantiating  the  results  of  the 
primary analysis because drop-outs may  well be different from completers in terms of efficacy. 
The Applicant has conducted a large number of sensitivity analyses: Analyses of the ITT analysis set 
(slightly different from the FAS), the completers set and the per protocol set as wells as analysis of  
repeated measures mixed effects model for the continuous endpoint and an analysis using baseline 
observation carried forward (BOCF) as imputation method for missing data. 
The  sensitivity  analyses  are  considered  generally  well  suited  as  supplemental  analysis  in  the 
perspective of the high drop-out rate. These sensitivity analyses were prospectively planned on the

primary efficacy endpoint. In addition, post-hoc sensitivity analyses of the 10% responders secondary 
endpoint have been performed.  
Please  refer  to  subsequent  CHMP  comments  on  the  choice  of  analysis  population  and  imputation 
method for missing data. 
The four pivotal studies NB-302, NB-302, NB-303, and NB-304 are described separately below : 
2.5.1.2.  Description of each study 
Tabulated summaries of efficacy are presented at the end the section for each study. These tables 
present the results using the FAS analysis set and LOCF as imputation method for missing data as 
defined  by  the  study  protocols  (FAS/LOCF).  However,  the  CHMP  considered  other  data  sets  and 
imputation methods ((ITT/LOCF) and (Randomised Population/BOCF)) more appropriate, and this has 
been  reflected  in  the  SmPC.  Hence,  these  summaries  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the 
discussion on clinical efficacy as well as the benefit risk-assessment (see later sections). 
2.5.1.2.1.  Study NB-301 
Study title 
A  Multicenter,  Randomized,  Double  Blind,  Placebo  Controlled  Study  Comparing  the  Safety  and 
Efficacy of Two Doses of Naltrexone Sustained Release (SR) / Bupropion Sustained Release (SR) and 
Placebo in Obese Subjects. 
Methods 
This was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluated 
the  efficacy  and  safety  of  naltrexone  SR  16  mg/bupropion  SR  360  mg,  naltrexone  SR  32 
mg/bupropion SR 360 mg (referred to as NB16 and NB32, respectively throughout this report), and 
matching  placebo  in  three  treatment  groups  treated  for  56  weeks,  followed  by  a  2-week  drug 
discontinuation period. All subjects received ancillary therapy at baseline and at Weeks 12, 24, 36 and 
48 consisting of diet instruction, advice on behaviour modification, and suggestions for exercise.  
There were 4 periods: screening period (up to 4 weeks, at least 2 visits; this serves ad´s eligibility 
evaluation for recruitment); titration period (4 weeks, 1 visit); maintenance period (52 weeks, 14 
visits); drug discontinuation period (2 weeks, 1 visit) with either tapered or sudden withdrawal of 
study medication. 
• 
Study participants  
Selection  criteria  defined  an  eligible  population  of  men  or  women,  aged  18  to  65  years,  with 
uncomplicated obesity (BMI ≥ 30 and ≤ 45 kg/m2) or subjects with controlled hypertension and/or 
dyslipidaemia  and  with  BMI  ≥  27  kg/m2  and  ≤  45  kg/m2,  who  were  without  serious  medical  or 
psychiatric illness. The subjects should be normotensive (systolic ≤ 140 mm Hg; diastolic ≤ 90 mm 
Hg). Anti-hypertensive medications are allowed with the exception of alpha-adrenergic blockers and 
clonidine. 
Fasting glucose < 126 mg/dL on no hypoglycaemic agents were allowed, fasting triglycerides should 
be <400 mg/dL. 
Initiation or discontinuation of tobacco products including inhaled tobacco, chewing tobacco or snuff 
was not allowed in the 3 months prior to randomization or planned during study participation. 
Loss or gain of more than 4.0 kilograms within 3 months prior to randomization was prohibited.

CHMP  comment 
Compliance was only measured for study medication. The lack of check of compliance with the diet 
and  exercise  regimen  is  considered  a  weakness,  but  not  considered  to  affect  the  overall 
interpretability of the results.

Objectives/endpoints/statistical methods 
Please see above in the general introduction to the main studies. 
• 
Sample size 
The total sample size to be randomized was approximately 1650 subjects with a 1:1:1 randomization 
allocation between combination treatment and placebo groups.  This sample size provided 99% power 
to detect a statistically significant difference between placebo and the combination treatment arms for 
the co-primary efficacy endpoints. The power calculation was made assuming the mean weight loss 
from baseline to the Week 56 visit would be approximately 1% for subjects randomized to placebo 
and ≥ 6% for subjects randomized to either combination treatment arm. A common SD of 7% was 
assumed  for  all  three  groups,  with  the  primary  comparison  between  the  placebo  and  each 
combination treatment arm made using a two-sample t-test and two-sided significance level of 5%. 
 A  comparison  was  also  explored  between  the  two  combination  doses.  It  was  assumed  that  a 
difference of approximately 1.1% (SD=7%) in the percentage change from baseline to Week 56 was 
to be observed. This assumed difference provided approximately 74% power to detect a statistically 
significant  difference  between  the  two  combination  doses.  The  study  has  64%  power  to  detect  a 
statistically  significant  difference  between  treatment  arms  for  the  co-primary  efficacy  endpoint, 
weight decrease of ≥ 5% from baseline to Week 56. Using the same assumptions as stated above but 
allowing for 20% of randomized subjects not providing post-baseline data, the study has 99% power 
to  detect  a  statistically  significant  difference  between  treatment  arms  for  the  co-primary  efficacy 
endpoint, weight decrease of ≥ 5% from baseline.

Conduct of the study 
Some  minor  clarifications  and  adjustments  were  made,  both  in  the  protocol  and  in  the  statistical 
analysis plan, but are considered acceptable.

Summary of efficacy for Study NB-301 
This table presents the results using the FAS analysis set and LOCF as imputation method for missing 
data as defined by the study protocol (FAS/LOCF). However, the CHMP considered other data sets and 
imputation methods ((ITT/LOCF) and (Randomised Population/BOCF)) more appropriate, and this has 
been reflected in the SmPC.

In the secondary analyses when compared to placebo, NB32 was associated with favourable changes 
in waist circumference, blood lipids, glucose and fasting insulin as well as other biochemical markers, 
but not in blood pressure. 
The treatment effect of NB started from week four, reached a plateau after about 6 months and was 
stable through the rest of 56 weeks period. 
Study NB-301 also included a body composition substudy. The primary objective in this substudy was 
to compare the change from baseline to Week 52 in body composition, measured by total fat mass 
(kg) using DEXA, in the pooled active treatment groups (NB16 and NB32) compared to the placebo 
group. Eight study centres enrolled 77 placebo subjects and 137 NB subjects. There were 124 
subjects with a baseline and post-baseline DEXA body composition measurement: 45 placebo and 79 
NB. There were 58 subjects with a baseline and post-baseline abdominal CT scan: 24 placebo and 34 
NB. In this substudy, the LS mean percent change in body weight from baseline was  7.18% for NB 
and  2.11% for placebo, and the LS mean difference between NB and placebo was  5.07% (95% CI,  
7.78, -2.36). 
The pooled active treatment groups showed a significantly greater decrease in total fat mass 
compared with placebo (p=0.001; FAS). Treatment with NB resulted in significant reductions, 
compared with placebo, in whole body total percent body fat (p=0.006), visceral adipose tissue mass 
(p=0.037), and whole body total lean mass (p=0.003).

Study NB-302 
A  Multicenter,  Randomized,  Double-Blind,  Placebo-Controlled  Study  Comparing  the  Safety  and 
Efficacy  of  Naltrexone  Sustained  Release  (SR)/Bupropion  Sustained  Release  (SR)  and  Placebo  in 
Subjects with Obesity Participating in a Behavior Modification Programme. 
Methods 
The study consisted of a screening period (up to 4 weeks), a 4-week titration period, and a 52-week 
maintenance period.  The first dose of study drug (Day 1) was to be ingested at the study centre in the 
presence of study centre personnel, unless there were compelling circumstances, in which case, the 
first  dose  was  taken  outside  the  study  centre  on  Day  1.    Study  visits  occurred  every  4  weeks.  
Subjects  were  required  to  enroll  in  a  closed  group  session  beginning  no  later  than  4  weeks 
post-randomization.   
• 
Study participants  
Eligible subjects were non smoking male or female subjects, aged 18 to 65 years, with uncomplicated 
obesity  (body  mass  index  [BMI]  ≥30  to  ≤45  kg/m2)  or  subjects  (BMI  ≥27  to ≤45 kg/m2)  with 
controlled hypertension and/or dyslipidaemia.  Additionally, eligible subjects had not used tobacco or 
tobacco products for at least 6 months before screening, were without serious medical or psychiatric 
illnesses, and agreed to participate in a comprehensive program of diet, exercise, and group lifestyle 
modification counselling plus pharmacotherapy (NB32 or placebo).  
• 
Treatments 
Naltrexone PR 32 mg/day and Bupropion 360 mg/day (NB32), or placebo. With regard to diet and 
exercise, please refer to the above section. 
Behavior  modification  counseling  sessions  of  90  minutes  duration  began  no  later  than  4  weeks 
post-randomization  and  were  scheduled  once  per  week  for  16  weeks,  once  every  2  weeks  for  12 
weeks, and monthly thereafter for up to 28 closed-group sessions.

The diet regimen encompassing food intake was the following, and could be adjusted according to 
weight loss: 
Body weight <200 – 249 pounds: 1200 kcal/day. 250-299 pounds: 1500 kcal/day; 300-349 pounds: 
1800 kcal/day; and ≥350 pounds: 2000 kcal/day. 
In  addition,  the  following  programme  was  prescribed:  Moderate  to  intense  exercise  30  min/day 
during  the  first  6  months;  thereafter  patients  were  encouraged  to  increase to  60  min  moderately 
intense exercise. 
This life style modifying programme was much more demanding in this study than in the other trials 
and therefore highlighted in this study. This applies both to the exercise requirements as the many 
focused group sessions. 
• 
Objectives/end points/statistical methods 
Please see above in the general introduction to the main studies. 
• 
Sample size 
The total sample size to be randomized was 800 subjects (3:1 randomization allocation between NB32 
and  placebo).  A  sample  size  of  800  subjects  provided  approximately  99%  power  to  detect  a 
statistically  significant  difference  between  NB32  and  placebo  for  the  co-primary  efficacy  variable, 
percent  change  from  baseline  on  body  weight.  The  estimate  assumed  a  mean  weight  loss  from 
baseline to Week 56 of approximately 5% for the placebo group and 10% for the NB32 group and a 
common standard deviation of 5% for both groups. The primary comparison between the treatment 
groups was made using a two-sample t-test and two-sided significance level of 5%. 
Additionally, this sample size provided approximately 90% power to detect a 14% difference between 
NB32 (64%) and placebo (50%) based upon the additional co-primary variable, proportion of subjects 
with  a  weight  decrease  of  ≥5%  from  baseline.  The  estimate  was  based  upon  the  two-sample 
continuity corrected chi-square test and two-sided significance level of 5%.   
The response rates for placebo were assumed to be similar to the response rates observed for the 
lifestyle modification alone arm.

In this study with intense lifestyle modification/interventions, the results are more favourable in both 
treatment groups compared to the other pivotal studies. However, the difference between NB and 
placebo is smaller. The results are expected and underscore the effects of the life style modifications 
in weight reduction. 
Summary of efficacy for Study NB-302This table presents the results using the FAS analysis set and 
LOCF as imputation method for missing data as defined by the study protocol (FAS/LOCF). However, 
the CHMP considered other data sets and imputation methods ((ITT/LOCF) and (Randomised

Analysis description 
Sensitivity analyses with  ITT (Intent-to-Treat) analysis set ,  Completers 
analysis  set,  and (PP) Per-Protocol analysis set were conducted for all primary 
parameters  
In the secondary analyses when compared to placebo, NB32 was associated with favourable changes 
in waist circumference, blood lipids, glucose and fasting insulin as well as other biochemical markers, 
but not in blood pressure. 
The treatment effect of NB started from week four, reached a plateau after about 6 months and was 
stable through the rest of 56 weeks period. 
2.5.1.2.3.  Study NB-303 
A  Multicenter,  Randomized,  Double-Blind,  Placebo-Controlled  Study  Comparing  the  Safety  and 
Efficacy  of  Naltrexone  Sustained  Release  (SR)/Bupropion  Sustained  Release  (SR)  and  Placebo  in 
Obese Subjects 
Methods 
This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluated the efficacy and safety 
of naltrexone SR 32 mg/bupropion SR 360 mg  compared to placebo in subjects with obesity for up to 
56 weeks.  Beginning at Week 28 through Week 44, NB32-treated subjects who failed to achieve or 
maintain at least 5% body weight loss from baseline were re-randomized (1:1 ratio) to continue NB32 
or begin treatment with a higher dose of naltrexone SR - naltrexone SR 48 mg/bupropion SR 360 mg  
(daily dose of bupropion SR was 360 mg for NB32 and NB48). 
The study consisted of a screening period (up to 4 weeks), a 4-week titration period, and a 52-week 
maintenance period.  Study visits occurred every 4 weeks. 
With the purpose of safety investigations two initial dosing regimen for NB were used in a 1:1 ratio, 
fast or slow titration.  During Week 1, the dose of naltrexone SR was 8 mg/day (fast titration) or 
4 mg/day (slow titration), and the maximum dose of 32 mg/day began at Week 4 (Day 22) for the 
fast titration group vs. Week 5 (Day 29) for the slow titration group.  For both NB groups (fast and 
slow),  bupropion  SR  was  initiated  at  a  dose  of  90  mg/day  (Week  1)  and  was  increased  to  the 
maximum dose of 360 mg/day at Week 4 (Day 22). 
At week 56 a 1:1 re-randomisation was issued to study a sudden, respectively, tapered withdrawal, 
consisting of half the study dose for one week. 
 CHMP comments 
Seemingly,  the  purpose  of  these  two  discontinuation  schedules  was  to  investigate  the  safety  and 
tolerability of abrupt vs. tapered discontinuation. 
It should be noted that the primary endpoint was at week 28 in this study with week 56 as a secondary 
endpoint, therefore the SmPC reflects the week 28 endpoint for the study NB303. 
This trial included a sub-study (NB-303 Substudy) evaluating the change from baseline in average 
24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The subject is discussed in the Safety part of the AR.

Study participants  
Eligible subjects were non smoking male or female subjects, aged 18 to 65 years (inclusive), with 
uncomplicated  obesity  (body  mass  index  [BMI]  ≥30  to  ≤45  kg/m2)  or  subjects  (BMI  ≥27 
to ≤45 kg/m2) with controlled hypertension and/or dyslipidaemia.  Additionally, eligible subjects had 
not used tobacco or tobacco products for at least 6 months before screening, were without serious 
medical  or  psychiatric  illnesses,  and  agreed  to  participate  in  a  comprehensive  program  of  diet, 
exercise, and group lifestyle modification counseling plus pharmacotherapy (NB32 or placebo).  
• 
Objectives/end points/statistical methods 
Please see above in the general introduction to the main studies. 
• 
Sample size 
Based on attrition rates, it was anticipated that up to 40% of randomized subjects would prematurely 
discontinue study drug (NB-201). The overall sample size of 1000 subjects randomized to NB32 was 
selected to ensure that approximately 600 subjects randomized to NB32 would complete 56 weeks of 
study drug treatment. To achieve the targeted number of subject-exposures at 1-year, 1000 subjects 
were to be randomized to NB32 and 500 subjects were to be randomized to placebo. The number of 
subjects treated with placebo was anticipated to provide sufficient numbers of controls in order to 
meaningfully evaluate, in a double-blind manner, the safety of NB32 over the 56-week period. With 
1000 subjects exposed to at least one dose of NB32, there is a 99%, 98%, and 86% chance that at 
least one unusual AE will be observed with a true frequency of 1/100, 1/250, and 1/500, respectively. 
Similarly, with 600 subjects exposed to NB32 for 56 weeks, there is a 99%, 81%, and 70% chance 
that  at  least  one  unusual  AE  will  be  observed  with  a  true  frequency  of  1/100,  1/250,  and  1/500, 
respectively. The total sample size to be randomized was 1500 subjects (2:1 randomization allocation 
between NB32 and placebo). This sample size had approximately 99% power to detect a statistically 
significant difference between NB32 and placebo for the co-primary efficacy variables, percent change 
in  total  body  weight  from  baseline.  The  estimate  assumed  a  mean  body  weight  decrease  from 
baseline to Week 56 (endpoint) of approximately 1% for placebo and ≥6% for NB32 (NB-201), and a 
common  standard  deviation  of  7%  for  both  groups.  The  primary  comparison  between  treatment 
groups was performed using a two-sample t-test and two-sided significance level of 5%. Using the 
same  assumptions  as  stated  above  but  allowing  for  20%  of  randomized  subjects  not  providing 
postbaseline data, this study had 99% power to detect a statistically significant difference between 
treatment  groups  for  the  co-primary  efficacy  endpoint,  percent  change  in  total  body  weight  from 
baseline to Week 56. 
This sample size also had approximately 99% power to detect a 14% difference between NB32 (64%) 
and placebo (50%) based upon the additional co-primary endpoint, proportion of subjects with ≥5% 
decrease in total body weight from baseline. This power calculation was based upon the two-sample 
continuity-corrected chi-square test and two-sided significance level of 5% (nQuery software, version 
6). Using the same assumptions as stated above but allowing for 20% of randomized subjects not 
providing postbaseline data, this study had 99% power to detect a statistically significant difference 
between  treatment  groups  for  the  co-primary  efficacy  endpoint,  proportion  of  subjects  with  ≥5% 
decrease in total body weight from baseline. Response rates for placebo were assumed to be similar 
to the response rates observed for lifestyle modification alone.

As  demonstrated  in  the  tables  above,  the  results  of  the  analysis  conducted  at  Week  56  showed 
comparable  results  to  Week  28  demonstrating  a  greater  proportion  of  NB32  treated  subjects 
achieving  ≥5%  weight  loss,  including  consistency  in  the  Week  56  sensitivity  analyses  using  the 
weighted procedure. Subjects receiving NB treatment for the entire 56 week period experienced the 
greatest treatment effects as evidenced by the completers analysis (proportion of subjects with ≥5% 
weight loss for NB32 was 64.9% compared with 21.7% for placebo [p<0.001].

In this study the efficacy of NB32 compared with placebo over 56 weeks of treatment was evaluated.  
In addition, subjects receiving NB32 therapy who did not experience or maintain at least 5% weight 
loss during Weeks 28 to 44 were re-randomised to continue on NB32 or increase their dose to NB48 
to explore whether NB48 would be more effective than NB32 treatment. An analysis of body weight 
percent change from baseline to Week 56 for these re-randomised subjects did not show a meaningful 
difference in weight loss between the re-randomised treatment groups (NB32 and NB48, p=0.351). 
Similarly, there was no meaningful difference between treatment groups (NB32 and NB48) in the 
proportion of subjects with ≥5% weight loss from baseline at Week 56 (p=0.585).  
In conclusion, for subjects who did not respond to NB32 therapy after approximately 6 months or 
more of treatment, increasing the dose to NB48 did not yield differential therapeutic benefit.  
Summary of efficacy for Study NB-303 
This table presents the results using the FAS analysis set and LOCF as imputation method for missing 
data as defined by the study protocol (FAS/LOCF). However, the CHMP considered other data sets and 
imputation methods ((ITT/LOCF) and (Randomised Population/BOCF)) more appropriate, and this has 
been reflected in the SmPC. 
The summary tables present the results using  the FAS analysis. However the most relevant analysis 
care considered to be the  (ITT LOCF) and randomised population BOCF.

Notes 
2:1 ratio randomisation in main the 28 weeks study. 
No meaningful differences in weight loss between NB32 and NB48 re-randomized 
groups were seen.  
Analysis description 
Sensitivity analyses with ITT (Intent-to-Treat) analysis set, Completers analysis set, 
and (PP) Per-Protocol analysis set were conducted for all primary parameters. 
In the secondary analyses when compared to placebo, NB32 was associated with favourable changes 
in waist circumference, blood lipids, glucose and fasting insulin as well as other biochemical markers, 
but not in blood pressure.

2.5.1.2.4.  Study NB-304 
A  Multicenter,  Randomized,  Double-Blind,  Placebo-Controlled  Study  Comparing  the  Safety  and 
Efficacy of Naltrexone 32 mg Sustained Release/Bupropion 360 mg Sustained Release and Placebo in 
Obese Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 
Methods 
This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluated the efficacy and safety 
of NB32 compared to placebo over 56 weeks in approximately 525 overweight and obese subjects 
with type 2 diabetes.   
The study consisted of a screening period (up to 4 weeks), a 4-week titration period, and a 52-week 
maintenance  period.  Subjects  were  to  self-monitor  blood  glucose  for  the  first  4  weeks  after 
randomization,  or  longer,  if  warranted  in  the  judgment  of  the  investigator.    All  subjects  received 
ancillary therapy at baseline and Weeks 4, 16, 28, and 40 consisting of diet instruction, advice on 
behaviour modification, and physical activity suggestions. 
• 
Study participants  
Eligible subjects were overweight and obese (BMI ≥27 to ≤45 kg/m2), smoking and nonsmoking, 18 
to 70 year-old (inclusive) males and females diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (HbA1c >7% 
and <10%; fasting blood glucose <270 mg/dL) on no injectable antidiabetes medication or inhaled 
insulin  for  more  than  3 months.    Additionally,  eligible  subjects  were  without  serious  medical  or 
psychiatric  illnesses,  and  received  stable  doses  of  oral  single  or  combination  hypoglycaemic 
medications for at least 3 months prior to randomization or did not take medications for the treatment 
of type 2 diabetes mellitus.   
As patients for this study only were eligible if they were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, they differed 
markedly from the patients in the other pivotal studies. 
• 
Objectives /statistical methods 
Please see above in the general introduction to the main studies. 
• 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary and secondary endpoints were the same as in the other pivotal studies. In addition, this 
study also investigated HbA1c,  proportion of subjects with HbA1c <7%, percent of subjects requiring 
rescue medications for diabetes, percent of subjects requiring change in dose(s) of oral antidiabetes 
medication, proportion of subjects with HbA1c <6.5%, percent of subjects discontinuing due to poor 
glycaemia control, 
• 
Sample size 
The total sample size to be randomized was approximately 525 subjects (2:1 randomization allocation 
between NB32 and placebo). A sample size of 525 subjects was to provide approximately 99% power 
to detect a statistically significant difference between NB32 and placebo for the co-primary efficacy 
variable, percent change in body weight from baseline. The estimate assumed a mean weight loss 
from baseline to Week 56 of approximately 1.5% for the placebo group and  ≥6.5% for the NB32 
group and a  common SD  of 5% for both groups. The primary comparison between the treatment 
groups used a two-sample t-test and two-sided significance level of 5%. Using the same assumptions 
as stated above but allowing for 20% of randomized subjects not providing postbaseline data, the 
study had 99% power to detect a statistically significant difference between treatment arms for the 
co-primary efficacy endpoint, percent change in body weight from baseline to Week 56. 
The  sample  size  also  had  approximately  88%  power  to  detect  a  statistically  significant  difference 
between treatment arms for the co-primary endpoint of body weight decrease of ≥5% from baseline.

This power calculation was made assuming a body weight decrease of ≥5% from baseline at the Week 
56  visit  will  be  observed  for  15%  of  subjects  randomized  to  placebo  and  for  27.5%  of  subjects 
randomized  to  combination  treatment.  This  comparison  was  made  using  a  two-sample  continuity 
corrected chi-square test and two-sided significance level of 5%.

Summary of efficacy for Study NB-304 
This table presents the results using the FAS analysis set and LOCF as imputation method for missing 
data as defined by the study protocol (FAS/LOCF). However, the CHMP considered other data sets and 
imputation methods ((ITT/LOCF) and (Randomised Population/BOCF)) more appropriate, and this has 
been reflected in the SmPC.

2:1 ratio randomisation. 
Evaluation of the glycaemic control in these obese patients with type 2 diabetes showed 
that at endpoint, subjects receiving NB32 had statistically significantly greater changes 
from  baseline  in  HbA1c  (LS  mean  change  NB32  -0.63%  vs.  -0.14%  for  placebo; 
p<0.001). The magnitude of the treatment difference (NB32 minus placebo) was -0.49% 
(95% CI, -0.71 to -0.27). 
Analysis description 
Sensitivity analyses with ITT (Intent-to-Treat) analysis set,  Completers analysis  set,  and 
(PP) Per-Protocol analysis set were conducted for all primary parameters. 
The biochemistry variables investigated in the other pivotal studies have in this study been 
supplemented with variables addressing glycaemic control in more detail. 
Effects on lipids and glycaemic parameters were generally more favourable in patients receiving NB32 
than placebo patients.   
Clinical studies in special populations 
The study in patients with type 2 diabetes is presented and assessed in the above section (Study 
NB-304). 
2.5.2.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses AND 
meta-analysis) 
Data  from  the  four  Phase  3  studies  were  pooled  to  investigate  the  effects  on  subpopulations  of 
treatment with NB (both 16 mg in Study NB-301 and 32 mg from all studies) compared with placebo 
and NB32 compared with placebo. They are described hereafter. 
1)  Demographic Subgroups 
The subject demographic subgroups included: 
•  Sex: Male, Female. 
•  Race: White, Black, and Other. 
•  Age: 18-44, 45-64, and ≥65 years. 
•  BMI: <30, 30 to <35, 35 to <40, ≥40 kg/m2.

The comparisons of NB pooled (16 and 32 mg) to placebo and NB32 to placebo were analysed for each 
demographic subgroup for the primary variables of percent decrease from baseline in body weight 
and the proportion of subjects with a weight loss from baseline of ≥5%.  
The comparisons of NB pooled (16 and 32 mg) to placebo in the percent decrease from baseline in 
body weight showed that for all the subgroups (based on sex, race, age, and BMI), NB was generally 
more effective than placebo. A marginal treatment by sex interaction (p=0.096) and a treatment by 
race interaction (p<0.001) suggested a greater reduction in weight for females and the White race. A 
treatment by BMI interaction (p=0.040) suggested a greater reduction in weight for subjects with BMI 
<30  kg/m2  (n=55).    This  was  not  observed  in  the  interim  analysis  of  the  ongoing  cardiovascular 
outcome study (NB-CVOT) and thus not reflected in the SmPC (see discussion later). 
For the age range of 45-64 subgroup, the LS mean difference from placebo was the same for both NB 
and NB32 and for BMI < 30, where the NB Pooled subgroup had slightly greater LS mean difference 
from placebo than the NB32 subgroup. The comparisons of NB32 with placebo in the percent decrease 
from baseline in body weight showed that for all the subgroups (based on sex, race, age, and BMI), 
NB32 was more effective than placebo. 
The comparisons of NB pooled (16 and 32 mg) to placebo in the proportion of subjects with a weight 
loss from baseline of ≥5% showed that for all the subgroups (based on sex, race, age, and BMI), NB 
was more effective than placebo. There was no treatment by subgroup interactions. 
The  results  were  similar  for  the  NB32  to  placebo  comparison  for  subgroups.  The  differences  from 
placebo were numerically greater for all subgroups, when pooling the data of the higher dose only 
(NB32) compared with both doses NB (16 and 32) suggesting a greater treatment effect with NB32. 
There was no treatment by subgroup interactions.  
2)  Baseline Characteristics Subgroups 
Hypertension, Dyslipidaemia, Metabolic Syndrome, Impaired Fasting Glucose 
The  baseline  disease  characteristics  were  based  on  the  presence  or  absence  of  hypertension, 
dyslipidaemia, metabolic syndrome, and impaired fasting glucose (defined as glucose ≥100 mg/dL at 
baseline). The comparisons of NB pooled to placebo and  NB32 to placebo were analysed for each 
baseline disease characteristic for the primary variables of percent decrease from baseline in body 
weight and the proportion of subjects with ≥5% weight loss from baseline.  
For all the subgroups based on the presence or absence of baseline diseases, NB was more effective 
than  placebo  in  the  percent  change  in  weight  from  baseline.  There  was  a  marginal  treatment  by 
hypertension  interaction  (p=0.064)  and  a  significant  treatment  by  impaired  fasting  glucose 
interaction (p=0.014) suggesting a greater reduction in weight for subjects without hypertension and 
without impaired fasting glucose.  
The results were similar for the NB32 to placebo comparison for subgroups based on the presence or 
absence of baseline diseases. The differences from placebo were numerically greater for all subgroups 
when  pooling  the  data  of  the  higher  dose  only  (NB32)  compared  with  both  doses  pooled  (NB) 
suggesting a greater treatment effect with NB32. A treatment by hypertension interaction (p=0.054) 
and treatment by impaired baseline fasting blood glucose interaction (p=0.007) suggested a greater 
reduction  in  weight  for  subjects  without  hypertension  and  without  impaired  glucose  tolerance  at 
baseline.  
For all the subgroups based on the presence or absence of baseline diseases, NB was more effective 
than  placebo  in  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  a  ≥5%  weight  loss  from  baseline.  There  were  no 
treatment by subgroup interactions.

The results were similar for the NB32 to placebo comparison based on the presence or absence of 
baseline diseases. The differences from placebo were slightly greater for all subgroups when pooling 
the  data  of  the  higher  dose  only  (NB32)  compared  with  both  doses  (NB)  suggesting  a  greater 
treatment effect with the higher dose. For the NB32 data, in contrast to the NB data, there was a 
marginal  treatment  by  subgroup  interaction  for  dyslipidaemia  (p=0.093)  and  for  impaired  fasting 
glucose  (p=0.068)  suggesting  potentially  greater  probability  of  ≥5%  weight  loss  in  subjects  with 
dyslipidaemia  at  baseline  and  without  impaired  fasting  glucose  at  baseline.  In  all  subgroups,  the 
proportion of subjects experiencing ≥5% weight loss from baseline was greater than 45% (49.8% to 
55.7%) and more than double the proportion observed with placebo treatment (19.5% to 23.4%). 
Smoking Status 
For both subgroups based on smoking status (current smoker versus former or non-smoker), NB was 
more effective than placebo in the percent change in weight from baseline. There was no treatment by 
smoking status interaction. The results were similar for the NB32 to placebo comparison for smoking 
status subgroups. The treatment difference of NB32 from placebo was slightly higher than observed 
with NB indicating the higher dose was more effective.  
For both subgroups based on smoking status, NB was more effective than placebo in proportion of 
subjects  with  a  weight  loss  from  baseline  of  ≥5%.  There  was  no  treatment  by  smoking  status 
interaction.  The  results  were  similar  for  the  NB32  to  placebo  comparison  for  smoking  status 
subgroups. The treatment difference of NB32 from placebo was slightly higher than observed with NB 
indicating the higher dose was more effective. 
2.5.3.  Supportive studies  
2.5.3.1.  Study NB-431 
Study  NB-431  was  a  Phase  2,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  randomized,  outpatient  study  to 
assess  brain  function  using  fMRI  methods  in  46  healthy  overweight/obese  female  subjects.  fMRI 
imaging methods were used to assess the effects of NB on the response to food cues under fasting and 
fed  conditions  at  one  month  of  treatment.  Compared  to  the  placebo  group,  the  NB32  group  had 
enhanced activation following exposure to food cues in the dorsal anterior cingulate, superior frontal, 
posterior  insula,  hippocampal  and  superior  parietal  regions,  which  are  brain  regions  involved  in 
inhibitory  control,  internal  awareness,  memory/conditioning  and  somatosensory  processing 
respectively. 
2.5.3.2.  Study NB-401 
Study  NB-401  was  an  open-label  study,  conducted  in  subjects  who  were  smokers  and  were 
overweight  or  had  uncomplicated  obesity  or  obesity  associated  with  controlled  hypertension  or 
dyslipidemia, investigated the efficacy and safety of treatment with naltrexone SR 32 mg/bupropion 
SR 360 mg daily combined with behavior modification counseling. The treatment showed efficacy in 
achieving smoking cessation without an increase in nicotine withdrawal symptoms, and, at the same 
time, limited weight gain after quitting. Subjects who quit smoking had a small increase from baseline 
weight  at  Week  12  (0.08%)  and  Week  24  (1.32%)  when  compared  to  subjects  who  were  still 
smoking. Mean weight change from baseline value at Weeks 12 and Week 24 was not meaningfully 
different in subjects who quit smoking.

2.5.3.3.  Study NB-402 
Study NB-402 was an exploratory, open-label, single-center study with a single treatment group that 
evaluated the efficacy and safety of NB32 in overweight or obese subjects who had major depression, 
and  who  may  have  been  diagnosed  with  controlled  hypertension  and/or  dyslipidemia,  but  were 
without other serious medical or psychiatric illness. All subjects participated in ancillary therapy that 
consisted of diet instruction, advice on diet behavior modification, and a prescription for exercise. Of 
the  25  subjects  enrolled,  13  (52.0%)  completed  all  24  weeks  of  study  treatment.  Depressive 
symptoms decreased in a clinically meaningful way in this open-label study following treatment with 
NB32 and ancillary therapy. Mean percent decreases in total body weight and mean decreases in BES 
scores, IDS-SR scale, serum leptin concentrations, and the majority of individual COE question scores 
from baseline to endpoint at Weeks 12 and 24 (LOCF) were also apparent.  
2.5.3.4.  Study CVOT (Light trial) 
Study NB-CVOT is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the effect 
of NB32 versus placebo on the occurrence of MACE, defined as CV death, nonfatal stroke, or nonfatal 
myocardial infarction (MI). The study is ongoing, and interim results have been provided with the 
D120 response. 8910 patients have been randomised into the treatment period of the study. The 
study population was older and exhibited a higher proportion of CV risk factors compared to the Phase 
3 studies. Mean age was 61.0 years, and 54.5% were females. Mean BMI was 37.3 kg/m2. One third 
(32.1%) had CV disease, 85.2% had type 2 diabetes (T2DM), 91.8% had dyslipidaemia and 92.3% 
had hypertension. 26.9% had an eGFR <90 mL/min. The proportion of patients achieving a weight 
loss of >10% showed a tendency to increase with increasing BMI: BMI <35 kg/m2: 10.9%; BMI: ≥35 
to <40 kg/m2: 11.8%; BMI ≥40 kg/m2: 14.8%. The result was consistent with the results from the 
Phase 3 trials for BMI >30 kg/m2. Key results on cardiovascular outcomes are discussed in the safety 
section of this report. 
The CVOT trial is currently ongoing and a further analysis is planned after 50% of MACE events. 
2.5.4.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
•  Choice of the dose and rationale for the Fixed Dose Combination 
Initially, the CHMP considered that the proposed fixed dose combination had not been adequately 
investigated in terms of superiority over the monocomponents. Study OT-101 was negative in that 
respect, and it was debated whether firm conclusions could be drawn from Study NB-201.  This issue 
was raised due to a concern that the therapeutic contribution of each individual component at the 
exact dose used in the combination was not clearly shown relative to the combination. The Applicant 
has  justified  this  by  reiterating  the  rationale  for  the  combination,  reviewing  the  results  of  study 
NB201, and by detailing the PK and PD data used to bridge the Phase 2 dose combinations to the 
doses and formulations used in Phase 3. 
The CHMP accepts the rationale for the combination of bupropion (which results in release of α-MSH 
and  has  an  anorexic  effect)  with  naltrexone  (to  block  the  negative  feedback  from  β-endorphin  on 
release of α-MSH), and as such, agrees that naltrexone alone has no effect on weight-loss. The design 
of study NB201 is therefore acceptable, and it is agreed that the combination was more effective than 
bupropion  alone.  The  selection  of  the  32  mg  naltrexone  dose  is  also  accepted  on  the  grounds  of 
balancing efficacy with tolerability.  
The changes made between Phase 2 and 3, in the formulation of naltrexone (from immediate release 
to prolonged release) and the dose of bupropion (from 400 to 360 mg) have been justified on rational 
clinical  grounds.  The  steady  state  PK  of  360  mg/day  bupropion  remains  unclear,  but  any  minor 
Mysimba  
Assessment Report

Page 85/132 
  
 
difference in exposure with the lower dose is unlikely to influence the efficacy, which was investigated 
separately in the pivotal studies anyway. The rationale for the FDC is therefore accepted. 
In the following sections clinical efficacy as evidenced from the four pivotal Phase 3 studies (NB-301, 
NB-302, NB-303 and NB-304) is discussed. 
•  Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The pivotal studies were randomised, double-blind, multicentre, placebo-controlled studies conducted 
in  obese  and  overweight  subjects  receiving  customary  diet  and  behavioural  counselling,  including 
prescribed  exercise  (Studies  NB-301  and  NB-303)  and  in  obese/overweight  subjects  undergoing 
intensive  lifestyle  modification  counselling  (Study  NB-302).  One  study  was  conducted  in 
obese/overweight  subjects  with  type  2  diabetes  (Study  NB-304).  Studies  NB-301,  NB-302  and 
NB-303 enrolled subjects with a BMI ≥30 and ≤45 kg/m2 for subjects with uncomplicated obesity and 
with  a  BMI  of  ≥27  and  ≤45 kg/m2  for  overweight  or  obese  subjects  with  controlled  hypertension 
and/or dyslipidaemia. The type 2 diabetes patients enrolled in Study NB-304 were to have a BMI ≥27 
to ≤45 kg/m2. Treatment duration in all studies was 56 weeks. 
It  is  a  significant  weakness  that  the  Phase  3  programme  was  not  tailored  to  also  include  elderly 
patients in sufficient numbers. However, some safety data are available from older patients in the 
NB-CVOT study.  The limitations of the data are reflected in the SmPC, by mentioning the use with 
caution in patients over 65 years of age. In addition, in patients 75 years of age, the use of NB is not 
recommended.   
The study design employed in all studies is considered to be acceptable with regard to randomisation, 
blinding and treatment duration.  
The application of diet and exercise programmes in all treatments arms of all studies and with an 
intensive programme in one of the studies (NB-302) is supported. 
The BMI cut-off values for patients with uncomplicated obesity and overweight/obese patients with 
co-morbid conditions are acceptable. 
No run-in period where patients enrolled in the studies should have been subjected to an appropriate 
weight reducing diet for a specified minimum time have been implemented as recommended in the 
CHMP guideline. This omission is however considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
More importantly, the studies were not designed to ensure that patients participating in these studies 
should have follow up examinations for a period deemed appropriate to assess rebound effects and 
the effect of drug cessation on appetite and weight control. Therefore, it is not known from the Phase 
3 studies whether any weight loss accomplished after e.g. one-year treatment with NB is maintained 
upon cessation of therapy because an adequate follow-up period after the treatment period was not 
part of the study design. However, interim data from study NB-CVOT, which included follow-up for a 
longer period following cessation of therapy, suggest that termination of NB therapy is associated with 
a significant weight gain, but it is unclear whether over the longer term this would result in a rebound 
beyond levels observed at baseline.  
None of the pivotal studies include an active reference. Orlistat is the only weight control medicine 
widely  available  in  the  EU.  This  medicine  is  associated  with  very  common  adverse  reactions  of  a 
distinct, gastrointestinal nature (such as flatus with discharge, faecal urgency and fatty oily stool) 
which makes it difficult to blind this medicine if included as an active reference. For this reason, the 
omission of an active reference is acceptable.  
The  following  FDA-recommended  primary  efficacy  endpoints  were  employed  for  all  four  Phase  3 
studies: 
Mysimba

• 
• 
The percent change from baseline in body weight at Week 56 (Last Observation Carried Forward 
[LOCF]) for Studies NB-301, NB-302, and NB-304 and at Week 28 (LOCF) for Study NB-303. 
The proportion of subjects who achieved ≥ 5% decrease from baseline body weight at Week 56 
(LOCF) for studies NB-301, NB-302, and NB-304 and at Week 28 (LOCF) for study NB-303. 
Despite the fact that the responder criterion employed in the co-primary endpoint (≥ 5% decrease) is 
not  concordant  with  the  CHMP-recommended  ( ≥ 10%),  the  ≥ 10%  criterion  is  included  as 
pre-specified secondary endpoint. This is acceptable by the CHMP. 
The primary and secondary endpoints included in the studies are considered adequate to evaluate the 
efficacy of a medicine in weight control. 
The primary analysis was based on the full analysis set (FAS) and using LOCF as imputation method 
for missing data. However, the studies are characterised by a high drop-out rate (about half of the 
patients  discontinued  prematurely).  It  can  be  discussed  if  LOCF  is  a  sufficiently  conservative 
imputation method, and the sensitivity analyses have an important role in substantiating the results 
of the primary analysis because drop-outs may very well be different from completers in terms of 
efficacy. 
The  Applicant  has  conducted  a  number  of  sensitivity  analyses:  Analyses  of  the  ITT  analysis  set 
(slightly different from the FAS), the completers set and the per protocol set as wells as analysis of 
repeated measures mixed effects model for the continuous endpoint and an analysis using baseline 
observation carried forward (BOCF) in the all-randomised set as imputation method for missing data. 
In particular, the BOCF is considered well suited as supplemental analysis in view of the high drop-out 
rate  and  the  restricted  nature  of  the  primary  analysis  set  (which  excludes  patients  without  an 
on-treatment post-baseline measurement). Further analyses using the BOCF have been provided.  
The  Applicant  objected  to  present  the  efficacy  results  in  the  SmPC  using  BOCF,  but  proposed  to 
maintain the LOCF using  a more conservative analysis set (ITT dataset) for the mean weight loss 
results (with adherence rates included in the text), whilst using the BOCF for the responder analyses. 
This is acceptable for the CHMP.  
•  Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Overall, the main findings in the pivotal studies were that treatment with NB32 (and NB16 in Study NB 
301)  resulted  in  statistically  significant  weight  loss  compared  with  placebo  in  overweight/obese 
subjects with or without hypertension or dyslipidaemia (Studies NB-301, NB-302, and NB 303), as 
well as in overweight/obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (Study NB 304). Week 56 results 
for  Study  NB  303  should  be  interpreted  with  caution  because  of  the  re-randomisation  of  active 
non-responders to NB32 or NB48 at week 28.  
Mean weight change over a treatment duration of about one year in NB32-treated subjects in Studies 
NB-301, NB-303, and NB-304 ranged from approximately -6.5 to -5.0% compared to -1.8 to -1.2% 
for placebo (FAS, LOCF). In the all-randomised set using BOCF, the effect of NB32 in those studies 
ranged from -4.4 to -3.1% and the effect of placebo ranged from -1.3 to -0.8%. 
In patients with intensive behaviour modification counselling in NB-302, the weight loss was higher in 
both treatment groups (9.3% for NB32 and 5.1% for placebo), (FAS, LOCF). This was also true for the 
all-randomised set with BOCF (-5.9% for NB32 and -4.0% for placebo).  
The mean differences from placebo (treatment differences) in percent weight loss ranged from -3.3% 
(Study NB-304) to -5.2% (Study NB-303) at Week 56 but using the all-randomised set and BOCF, this 
was -1.7% in study NB 304 and -3.7% in study NB 303. The treatment differences were lowest in 
Mysimba  
Assessment Report

Page 87/132 
  
 
patients with type 2 diabetes (Study NB-304) and in patients with intensive behaviour modification 
(Study NB-302). 
The weight loss on NB32 was modest-moderate as mean weight changes from baseline was less than 
10 % in all studies, and the difference to placebo did not exceed 5% in any study (all-randomised set, 
BOCF). 
The Applicant has performed an examination of treatment-by-BMI interaction for the Phase 3 studies 
and  demonstrated  that  for  the  primary  endpoint  (i.e.  weight  change  from  baseline)  the  greatest 
difference between NB and placebo therapy was observed in patients with a BMI <30 kg/m2. This is 
not entirely what would be expected. A similar pattern was seen for the ≥ 5% weight loss categorical 
endpoint although this was not significant. Hence, the data from the Phase 3 studies indicated that the 
efficacy of NB may be less in patients with the highest BMI. However, interim data from the ongoing 
NB-CVOT study with considerably larger patient numbers show a tendency to a higher proportion of 
patients  achieving  a  weight  loss  of  >10%  with  increasing  BMI.  Consequently,  it  is  reasonable  to 
conclude that NB causes clinically relevant weight loss also in patients in the high BMI groups. 
The  effect  of  NB  was  detectable  at  week  4,  reached  a  plateau  after  approximately  6  months  and 
remained throughout the rest of the study in patients who continued with treatment. The plateau was 
also seen in patients continuing treatment in the placebo group where the subjects did not appear to 
return to baseline weight, but following a slight regain also maintained a plateau for the remainder of 
the study.  
The proportion of NB32-treated subjects who achieved ≥ 5% weight loss from baseline ranged from 
44.5%  (Study  NB-304)  to  66.4%  (Study  NB-302)  (however  only  39.5%  with  the  NB16  dose  in 
NB-301).  Results  were  statistically  significant  (p<0.001)  compared  to  the  proportion  of 
placebo-treated subjects (16.4% in Study NB-301 to 42.5% in Study NB-302). 
The proportion of subjects who met the CHMP-recommended weight loss criterion of ≥ 10% weight 
loss,  at  the  endpoint  following  NB32  treatment  (18.5%  to  41.5%,  FAS,  LOCF)  was  statistically 
superior compared with placebo (5.7% to 20.2%, FAS, LOCF). The range for the all-randomised set 
using  BOCF  was  13.4%  to  30.3%  for  patients  taking  NB32  and  4.2%  to  17.3%  for  patients  on 
placebo.  
The differences between NB32 and placebo for the responder analyses were lowest in patients with 
type 2 diabetes (Study NB-304). 
It is conceivable that the patients who obtain a significant weight loss are the same as those who 
suffer  from  nausea  (common  adverse  reaction  with  NB).  However,  the  Applicant  has  provided 
reassurance that nausea was not a significant factor in causing the weight loss obtained with NB. 
Because the drop-out rate in the studies was high (roughly 50% across the studies over one year), 
sensitivity analyses across multiple datasets and using different imputation methods for missing data 
as well as repeated measures mixed effect model approaches were important. These analyses gave 
results consistent with those of the primary analyses. The BOCF analyses were less convincing but 
may be considered to be the most realistic results on which to base a decision because they represent 
a comparison of randomised groups and impose a penalty for the high dropout rates. Alternatively, 
BOCF  could  be  seen  as  a  very  conservative  imputation  method  because  it  does  not  allocate  any 
benefit to patients who discontinued prematurely and had a substantial weight loss at the time of 
discontinuation. 
For the description of the study results in the SmPC, as noted above, the LOCF was maintained but 
using a more conservative analysis set (ITT dataset) for the mean weight loss results (with adherence 
rates included in the text). The BOCF was used for the responder analyses. Please refer to Tables 2 
and 3 in section 5.1 of the SmPC.

The primary efficacy results were supported by favourable effects on a number of secondary efficacy 
variables  such  as  change  in  excess  body  weight,  waist  circumference,  blood  lipids  (mainly 
HDL-cholesterol  and  triglycerides)  and  hs-CRP.  There  were  also  notable  favourable  effects  in 
glycaemic control, both in non-diabetics but particularly in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, 
the  clinical  significance  of  the  changes  in  parameters  measuring  insulin  resistance  as  well  as 
progression to type 2 diabetes (in the studies including non-diabetics) is questionable. 
With  regard  to  quality  of  life  (QoL),  there  were  some  positive  findings  in  the  huge  of  pool  of 
IWQOL-Lite  (the  employed  QoL  scale)  items  and  on  the  total  score  for  three  of  the  four  studies. 
However, the differences in total score between NB and placebo were small and of doubtful clinical 
relevance. Therefore the CHMP did not agree to mention them in  the SmPC.  
The results on control of eating provided some support to the proposed mode of action. However, the 
results on food craving were inconclusive. 
Baseline  depressive  symptomatology  in  the  Phase  3  programme  was  scarce,  and  the  results  on 
depressive symptoms were inconclusive. 
Subgroup analyses based  on the pooled dataset indicated a relatively consistent efficacy across a 
wide  range  of  demographic  and  baseline  characteristics.  A  more  pronounced  weight  reduction  in 
females, in White patients and in patients with BMI <30 kg/m2 was however suggested. There were 
also suggestions of increased efficacy in patients without hypertension and without impaired glucose 
tolerance. The latter finding should be seen in the perspective that Study NB-304 indicated that the 
treatment effect of NB may be smaller in patients with type 2 diabetes than in non-diabetic patients. 
There was no treatment interaction by smoking status. 
Overall,  the  efficacy  results  outlined  and  discussed  above  indicate  a  modest  effect  of  NB32  but 
clinically relevant. 
The efficacy of NB16 is less than that of NB32, and also in the context of the safety results, it is agreed 
that NB32 is the preferred and recommended dose. 
One important exception from the overall favourable results of NB32 on secondary endpoints is the 
effect  on  blood  pressure  where  NB32  consistently  increased  blood  pressure  when  subtracting  the 
effects in the placebo group. Initially, this was a significant concern and will be addressed further in 
the assessment of safety. 
The Applicant proposed to include a recommendation in section 4.2 of the SmPC that patients should 
be evaluated after 16 weeks of treatment and that discontinuation of NB should be considered if a 
clinically meaningful weight loss (approximately 5%) is not present at that time. The rationale for this 
recommendation  was  initially  questioned  by  the  CHMP.  Subsequently,  the  Applicant  stated  in  its 
response that the 5% weight loss criterion at Week 16 is based on receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) analyses of the pooled Phase 3 study data to calculate the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy 
of combinations of various thresholds of early weight loss (2 to 5%) and early visits (Weeks 4 to 16). 
The  rationale  for  recommending  the  16  week  threshold  was  retrospective  Phase  3  analyses  that 
indicated  a  strong  relationship  between  early  and  later  weight  loss  and  suggested  that  the  most 
appropriate threshold to support continued long-term treatment with NB32 was achieving at least 5% 
weight  loss  by  Week  16.  Those  subjects  not  attaining  that  level  of  weight  loss  were  less  likely  to 
achieve clinically meaningful weight loss with continued treatment.  
The proposal to discontinue treatment after 16 weeks if patients have not lost at least 5% of their 
initial  body  weight  is  supported  by  the  clinical  data  and  was  acceptable.  Furthermore,  the  CHMP 
considered the need to reflect the stopping rule in the indication and include this sentence to section 
4.1 of the SmPC.  
Mysimba

The positive predictive values predict how many patients will achieve a relevant (≥ 5%) weight loss at 
the end of the treatment period, in this case 56 weeks. The positive predictive values for predicting 
the relevant response (≥ 5% weight loss) at 56 weeks were calculated for different time points: 12, 
16 and 20 weeks. Based on the weight loss of ≥ 5% at 12, 16 and 20 weeks, the positive predictive 
values were 77.18%, 86.4% and 90.2%, respectively. The corresponding negative predictive values 
for 12, 16 and 20 weeks were 85.2%, 84.9% and 86.4%, respectively. Hence, a weight loss of >=5% 
at 16 weeks will predict a sustained weight loss at 56 weeks with a probability of approximately 85%. 
Thus, the choice of the 16-week time point appears reasonable and acceptable. 
It is agreed that there seems to be no reason to mandate a maximum treatment duration. However, 
this need for on-going treatment should be factored in to the decision on the benefit-risk balance. 
Thus the need for continued treatment should be re-evaluated annually as mentioned in section 4.2 of 
the SmPC. 
Apart  from  the  dose-finding  studies  and  the  four  pivotal  studies  presented  and  assessed  above, 
additional Phase 2 studies provided supplemental, although very limited evidence. Study NB-431 was 
an fMRI study, which provided mechanistic insight and support for pursuing development of NB in 
management  of  weight.  Studies  NB-401  and  NB-402  were  exploratory  open-label,  uncontrolled 
studies in overweight/obese patients undergoing a smoking cessation programme and having major 
depression, respectively. No firm conclusion regarding efficacy can be drawn from these studies. 
2.5.5.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
Overall,  the  efficacy  results  indicate  a  moderate  effect  of  NB32  in  weight  management,  which  is 
considered to be clinically significant. The proposed stopping rule is now included in section 4.1 of the 
SmPC, and is likely to enhance the benefit by prompting the prescribing physician to discontinue NB 
at a relatively early time point in patients with a poor likelihood of obtaining a clinically meaningful 
weight loss after one year.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
For the purpose of the safety evaluation, three datasets were analysed: The primary dataset, the 
overall  dataset  and  the  non-diabetic/diabetic  dataset.  These  datasets  include  data  from  all 
randomised patients who were administered at least one tablet of study treatment and had at least 
one  investigator  contact/assessment  at  any  time  after  the  start  of  study  treatment,  regardless  of 
whether or not they discontinued the study.  
The  Primary  dataset  includes  safety  data  from  the  placebo  controlled  studies  NB-201,  NB-301, 
NB-302, NB-303, and NB-304.  
Relative to the Primary Dataset, the Overall Dataset includes an additional 149 patients exposed to 
NB32  (from  NB-401,  NB-402,  and  NB-201  after  reassignment)  and  85  patients  exposed  to  NB50 
(from OT-101).  
The diabetic dataset includes obese patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) from study NB-304.  
In addition, a cardiovascular outcome trial (CVOT) and a Phase 3b study (NB-404) are ongoing. The 
objective  of  the  CVOT  study  is  to  assess  the  occurrence  of  major  adverse  cardiovascular  events 
(MACE) in overweight and obese patients with cardiovascular risk factors receiving NB FDC. NB-404 
study is a randomised, open-label, clinical trial designed to provide additional information regarding 
the  real  world  weight  loss  potential  of  NB  in  combination  with  a  US  commercially  available

comprehensive lifestyle intervention programme, compared to usual care. Data from NB-CVOT and 
NB-404 studies are not integrated/pooled with Phase 3 data in the present application as both studies 
are ongoing. 
The mean and median for baseline characteristics (i.e., age, height, weight, BMI) were similar across 
dose and treatment groups. Mean age and weight was 45 years and 100 kg. The majority of patients 
were female (~82%) and White (~77%) and ~17% were Black. In each dose and treatment group, a 
majority of patients were evenly distributed between the ≥30 to <35 kg/m2 obesity class (37%) and 
the  ≥35 to <40 kg/m2  obesity  class  (36%),  while  approximately  25%  of  patients  were  in  the 
≥40 kg/m2  obesity  class;  less  than  3%  of  patients  were  in  the  <30 kg/m2  obesity  class. 
Approximately  60%  of  patients  had  complicated  obesity,  half  had  dyslipidaemia,  and  a  third  had 
impaired fasting glucose or hypertension. About 10% of patients in the Total NB and placebo groups 
had T2DM (10.3%, 11.2% respectively). About 10% of patients had a history of depression and 4% 
had a history of anxiety. The diabetes population were 10 years older, nearly half the patients were 
male and they weighted about 5% more than the non-diabetic population. Both hypertension and 
dyslipidemia were more frequently presented among diabetic patients as was the use of concomitant 
medications. In both the Primary and Overall Datasets, the percentage of patients taking at least one 
concomitant medication was similar across treatment and dose groups. The most common classes of 
concomitant medications were propionic acid derivatives, anilides, and multivitamins. In the Primary 
Dataset, the incidence of antihypertensive medication use was similar in the Total NB and placebo 
groups  (incidence  of  hypertension  was  25%).  In  the  Diabetic  and  Nondiabetic  Datasets,  the 
percentage  of  patients  taking  at  least  one  concomitant  medication  was  higher  in  patients  with 
diabetes compared with patients without diabetes. The incidence of use was higher in the diabetic 
group  for  medications  used  to  treat  hypertension,  heart  disease,  and  diabetes.  About  5%  of  NB 
treated patients used opioids as concomitant medication even though it is contraindicated. Following 
further  clarification  about  opiate  use  in  the  studies,  it  is  concluded  that  the  SmPC  sufficiently 
addresses that concomitant use of opiates is not recommended and in some cases contraindicated.  
Patient exposure 
Overall, the safety database included sufficient number of patients exposed for 6 and 12 months to 
adequately  describe  the  safety  on  NB.  According  to  the  ICH  E1  guideline,  6  months  treatment  in 
300-600 patients or 100 patients exposed in 1 year should be adequate to characterize the pattern of 
adverse  drug  events  over  time.  The  exposure  to  NB  fulfilled  this  requirement  as  1663  (51.3%) 
patients received ≥365 days of NB treatment. The mean (SD) exposure for total NB treatment, was 
35.4 (23.7) weeks. 165 diabetes patients received NB treatment for more than 52 weeks, which is 
also adequate to characterise the safety in diabetes patients. Mean exposure for diabetes patients 
were 35.3 (24.3) weeks, which was comparable to the non-diabetes patients. 
The majority (25-34%) of patients discontinuing treatment with NB did so in the first 8 weeks and 
overall, between 40 and 50% of the patients in the phase 3 studies discontinued the studies. More 
patients treated with NB discontinued due to adverse events (22.9% NB patients and 12% placebo 
patients) whereas more placebo patients discontinued the studies due to lack of efficacy (1.7% NB 
patients and 6.1% placebo patients).

Adverse events 
Adverse events in general 
Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs), was defined as events that occurred or worsened on or 
after the date of first dose until 7 days after the last confirmed dose. All Serious AEs that occurred 
within 30 days after the last dose of study drug were reported. The following criteria were used to 
identify TEAEs:  
• 
TEAEs: ≥5% incidence in the Total NB group (or the NB32 group in the Non-diabetic/Diabetic 
Datasets) and at least twice the incidence of the placebo group. 
•  Severe TEAEs (Primary Dataset only): ≥0.4% incidence in the Total NB group and at least 
twice the incidence of the placebo group. 
•  Severe TEAEs (Non-diabetic/Diabetic Datasets only): ≥1% incidence in the NB32 group and 
at least twice the incidence of the placebo group. Note: Due to the low incidence of severe 
events and the small Diabetic Dataset sample size, a cut-off of ≥1% in the NB32 group (at 
least 4 patients in the Diabetic Dataset) was used as opposed to the ≥0.4% incidence cut-off 
in the larger Primary Dataset. 
•  AEs leading to treatment discontinuation (Primary Dataset only): ≥0.5% incidence in the total 
NB Group and higher than the incidence of the placebo group. 
•  AEs  leading  to  treatment  discontinuation  (Non-diabetic/Diabetic  Datasets  only):  ≥1% 
incidence in any group. 
The  definitions  on  the  severity  of  adverse  events  and  serious  adverse  events are acceptable.  The 
severity of each AE was classified as severe (incapacitating, with inability to work or perform normal 
daily  activity),  moderate  (discomfort  of  sufficient  severity  to  reduce  or  adversely  affect  normal 
activity),  or  mild  (discomfort  noted,  but  no  disruption  of  normal  daily  activity).  A  serious  adverse 
event (SAE) was defined as follows: any adverse experience occurring at any dose of study drugs that 
results in death, a life-threatening adverse drug experience, in-patient hospitalisation or prolongation 
of  existing  hospitalisation,  a  persistent  or  significant  disability/incapacity,  or  a  congenital 
anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or 
require  hospitalisation  may  be  considered  a  serious  adverse  event  when,  based  upon  appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardise the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
In  the  double-blind  treatment  phase,  85.5%  of  NB  treated  patients  compared  to  75%  of  placebo 
treated patients reported a TEAE. 62.5% of NB treated patients compared to 37.2% placebo treated

patients reported TEAEs in the dose-escalation phase, whereas 60.9% of NB treated patients and 
64.2% of placebo treated patients reported TEAEs in the maintenance phase.  
A greater percentage of patients with diabetes experienced at least one TEAE during the double-blind 
treatment phase compared with patients without diabetes in both the NB32 (90.4% vs. 86.6%) and 
placebo (85.2% vs. 73.8%) groups. This result is not unexpected given the older age of the subject 
population  and  that  baseline  conditions  such  as  hypertension  and  hyperlipidaemia  and  the  use  of 
concomitant medications are more frequent in patients with diabetes. The incidences of TEAEs in the 
NB32  group  in  both  the  Diabetic  and  Non-diabetic  Datasets  were  higher  compared  with  the 
corresponding  placebo  groups  during  the  dose  escalation  phase,  and  similar  or  less  during  the 
maintenance phase. 
The system organ classes (SOC) mostly affected were Gastrointestinal Disorders, Nervous System 
Disorders and Infections and Infestations. The incidences within the common SOC categories, were 
generally higher in the NB group compared with the placebo group with the exception of Infections 
and  Infestations;  Musculoskeletal  and  Connective  Tissue  Disorders;  Metabolism  and  Nutritional 
Disorders; and Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders.  
During the double-blind phase, the notable TEAEs (i.e., ≥5% incidence in the NB32 group and at least 
twice the incidence of the placebo group) in patients with diabetes were generally the same as those 
seen in patients without diabetes. However, the relative difference between the NB32 and placebo 
Mysimba

groups  for  nausea,  vomiting,  and  diarrhoea  was  greater  in  patients  with  diabetes  compared  with 
patients without diabetes.  
In the non-diabetic dataset 11.8% and 6.4% of TEAEs in the NB and placebo group, respectively, 
were categorized as severe compared with 18.3% and 11.2% in the diabetic dataset for the NB and 
placebo group, respectively. No relevant differences in the occurrence of mild and moderate adverse 
events were seen between the diabetic and non-diabetic groups.  
TEAEs related to study drug were judged by the investigator to be 64.4% in the NB group and 36.1% 
in the placebo group. The distribution among SOCs is similar as the total TEAEs with gastrointestinal-, 
nervous system- and psychiatric disorders as the most common TEAEs related to the study drug. 
The common TEAEs with the strongest dose-relationship were nausea, vomiting, dizziness, hot flush 
and hyperhidrosis. Less common TEAEs such as feeling jittery and vision blurred may also be dose 
related and headache and anxiety appeared dose related only during the titration phase. 
With regard to the common SOCs and common TEAEs, no unique SOCs or events were identified in 
the Overall Dataset subgroups compared to the Primary Dataset subgroups. 
Adverse events by system organ class 
Gastrointestinal, nervous system and psychiatric disorders 
- Nausea 
In the primary dataset, nausea was the most pronounced TEAE affecting 31.8% of NB treated patients 
compared to 6.7% of placebo patients in the double blind phase. 24.8% NB treated patients reported 
nausea during the dose escalation phase compared to 9.9% in the maintenance phase, indicating that 
nausea is most pronounced in the beginning of the treatment. Occurrence of nausea peaked within 4 
weeks and resolved in most patients by 24 weeks. Nausea caused 6.3% of discontinuations in the 
dose-escalation  phase  and  5.5%  discontinuations  in  the  maintenance  phase.  No  events  were 
considered serious. Diabetes patients reported an even higher degree of nausea events (42.3% in the 
NB group and 7.1% in the placebo group) and a higher degree of severe nausea events.  
- Constipation, vomiting, dizziness, dry mouth, headache and insomnia 
The seven TEAEs (nausea, constipation, vomiting, dizziness, dry mouth, headache, and insomnia) are 
consistent with the AE profiles for the individual components of NB (bupropion and naltrexone). All 
seven TEAEs occurred by more than 5% and with a higher incidence than placebo in both diabetes and 
non-diabetes patients. Only for the category of dizziness, one event was reported as serious in the 
non-diabetes patients. Incidence of treatment discontinuations due to the seven TEAEs were less than 
<2% in NB treated patients compared to less than 0.5% in placebo treated patients.  
Psychiatric disorders 
- Suicidality 
The FDA indicated that the single question on suicidality in the IDS-SR may not adequately capture 
the full spectrum of events that could potentially occur. It was recommended that a retrospective 
assessment  tool  of  suicidality  like  the  Columbia  Classification  Algorithm  of  Suicide  Assessment 
(C-CASA)  be  used  to  assess  adverse  events  that  could  represent  suicidal  events  (behavior  and 
ideation). A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate NB dose combinations compared to placebo in 
5 double-blind, randomized and placebo controlled clinical trials that enrolled obese patients, as well 
as overweight patients with comorbidities (dyslipidemia, hypertension, or T2DM). 
Overall,  94.9%  of  NB  patients  and  95.3%  of  placebo  patients  had  no  event  (Code  0,  defined  as 
absence of possibly suicide-related adverse events [PSRAEs]) as identified by key word text-string 
Mysimba

search. There were 4 events of suicidal ideation or behavior during this study, one event (1/3239, 
<0.1%) in the NB treatment group compared to 3 events (3/1515, 0.2%) in the placebo treatment 
group.  The  remaining  events  were  determined  by  adjudication  to  demonstrate  no  evidence  of 
suicidality.  Results  from  this  meta-analysis  showed  no  treatment  difference  in  suicidal  ideation  or 
worse, measured by C-CASA methodology, as evidenced by the estimated odds ratio of 0.14 (95% CI: 
0.00, 1.72). The findings were also homogenous across studies. 
- Depression 
Depression  was  of  special  interest  because  of  historical  concerns  surrounding  antidepressant 
treatment and suicidal ideation and behaviour. A detailed assessment of the risk of depression using 
standardised psychometric tools (IDS-SR) as well as the review of depression-related TEAEs did not 
reveal an increased risk of depression with NB treatment. Occurrence of depression was similar in the 
placebo and NB treated patients and discontinuations due to a psychiatric event were approximately 
2.5% in both placebo and NB treated patients. This is consistent with the CPMP conclusions following 
the referral under Article 36 of Directive 2001/83/EC, which stated that there is no clinical reason for 
suspecting bupropion to be causally associated with depression or suicide (CPMP/27610/02).  
- Sleep disorders 
In the double-blind treatment phase, 10.8% of NB32 treated patients experienced sleep disorders 
(most commonly insomnia) compared to 7.1% in the placebo group and 8.8% in the NB16 group 
suggesting  a  dose-response  relationship.  The  percentage  of  subjects  initiating  sedative/hypnotic 
during the study period or using sedatives/hypnotic at the end of study participation was comparable 
between  the  NB  group  and  the  placebo  group  indicating  that  the  increased  frequency  of  sleep 
disorders was not associated with an increase use of sedatives/hypnotics.  
Cognitive disorders 
Mysimba  
Assessment Report 
EMA/805547/2015 
Page 95/132 
  
 
 
Cognitive disorders (attention, memory impairment and language) occurred more often in NB treated 
patients (2.9%) than in placebo-treated patients (1.0%), and 0.8% of NB treated patients and 0.3% 
of  placebo  treated  patients  discontinued  the  study  due  to  cognitive  adverse  events.  None  of  the 
cognitive events were serious. A number of cognitive symptoms have been included in section 4.8 of 
the SmPC. 
Seizures and convulsions 
Bupropion  is  known  to  be  associated  with  dose  related  increase  in  occurrence  of  seizures  and  2 
patients  in  the  NB32  group  experienced  a  serious  seizure  event  leading  to  discontinuation.  One 
patient had no prior history of seizure, the other patient had diabetes and hypoglycemia which were 
suggested to be the disposing factors leading to seizure. 
Additional data on CNS adverse events from the ongoing CVOT study 
In NB-CVOT 24% of subjects were on an antidepressant medication. The incidence of SAEs in the 
psychiatric class was low and comparable between treatment groups. Adverse events that were not 
classified as SAEs or as leading to study discontinuation were not captured, however it is noted that 
the incidence of psychiatric adverse events leading to study discontinuation was 3 times higher in 
NB32-treated patients than those on placebo, with anxiety and insomnia being the main causes. The 
majority  of  these  events  were  of  moderate  severity,  and  were  considered  by  investigators  to  be 
related to treatment.

Analysis 1, Table 30) 
Others 
Regarding adverse events from the muscles and joints, no differences was observed between NB and 
placebo treatment.

Adverse events concerning sexual dysfunction were more frequent in the NB treated group, although 
the  incidence  was  low.  Events  were  primarily  classified  as  unspecified  and  very  few  patients 
discontinued the study due to sexual dysfunction. 
Liver function and gallbladder 
Adverse events related to potential hepatotoxicity were equally distributed among both the NB- and 
placebo treated patients. 40 (1.2%) in NB treated patients and 16 (1.1%) placebo patients. Most 
events were elevated transaminases. 22 NB treated patients had gallbladder-related AEs compared to 
7 in the placebo group. Ten (0.3%) NB patients with gallbladder-related treatment emergent severe 
adverse events were hospitalized and underwent gallbladder surgery compared to 1 placebo patient. 
The higher incidence of gallbladder events in the NB treated patients may be related to loss of body 
weight. More NB-treated patients (7 of 35 with elevated transaminases) discontinued the study due to 
elevated transaminases compared to placebo (1 of 14 with elevated transaminases). 
Vascular disorders 
Blood pressure-related TEAEs (including hypertension) in both the NB32 and placebo groups were 
reported mostly by patients with baseline hypertension (baseline incidence was higher in diabetes 
patients), were not serious, infrequently led to treatment discontinuation, and required medication in 
approximately  two-thirds  of  these  patients.  When  applying  the  proposed  stopping  rule  in  the 
NB-CVOT  study,  by  the  first  interim  analysis  1.8%  of  all  patients  randomised  to  NB  discontinued 
treatment at Week 16 due to sustained increased blood pressure (≥ 10 mmHg compared to baseline) 
alone. Another 2.5% discontinued due to a combination of sustained increased blood pressure (≥ 10 
mmHg compared to baseline) and <2% weight loss. 
Arrhythmia AEs occurred at a higher incidence in NB-treated patients (5.5%) than in placebo-treated 
patients (4.2%). The increase was largely due to palpitations (2.4% in the NB group and 0.9% in the 
placebo group). Palpitations were reported along with dizziness in 12 of 90 patients (10 NB patients 
and  2 placebo  patients),  but  were  not  associated  with  syncope.  The  incidence  of  Atherosclerotic 
Disease events was similar between the Total NB and placebo groups (6.4% and 5.7%, respectively). 
SAEs were rare (0.2% Total NB, 0.4% placebo) and 0.6% of Total NB patients discontinued treatment 
for  an  Atherosclerotic  Disease  events  compared  to  0.9%  of  placebo.  The  rate  ratio  of  treatment 
emergent ischaemic heart events in the NB32 group compared to the placebo group was 1.35 (95% 
CI: 0.42-4.31). 
Major cardiovascular events (MACE) were recorded. The broad MACE included myocardial infarction 
(MI), CNS bleedings, cerebrovascular (CVA) accident and cardiovascular (CV)  deaths. The custom 
MACE furthermore included revascularisation events as a proxy for CV events. Eight MACE events 
occurred in the clinical studies, 5 in the NB group (4 MI during the studies and one MI that occurred 
36 days after the patient had discontinued study drug (discontinuation was due to gastroesophageal 
reflux  syndrome)  and  3  in  the  placebo  group  (one  with  coronary  artery  disease,  one  with  angina 
pectoris  (AP)  and  one  with  cerebrovascular  event).  In  total,  6  patients  were  revascularised,  4  NB 
patients (the 3 MI patients and 1 patient with angina pectoris (AP) and 2 placebo treated patients (for 
AP). 2 NB treated patients with MI had diabetes and 2 placebo treated patients with AP and Stroke had 
diabetes. Results using the broad MACE definition (without revascularisation) showed a rate ratio of 
1.42  (95%  CI:  0.27-7.53)  for  total  NB  compared  to  placebo  and  a  rate  ratio  of  1.55  (95%  CI: 
0.31-7.75)  for  the  NB32  treated  patients  compared  to  placebo.  Including  revascularisation 
procedures in the MACE definition (custom MACE) the rate ratio was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.17-3.38) for 
total NB treatment compared to placebo and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.20-3.52) for the NB32 treated patients.

A  retrospective  analysis  from  an  independent  adjudication  committee  yielded  the  same  results 
regarding MACE and they found 4 additional cases of unstable AP in the placebo group. Even though 
the numbers are very small, the number of MI events was higher in the NB treated group compared 
to  the  placebo  group  and  the  data  suggest  that  an  increase  in  MACE  might  be  an  issue  in  these 
patients where many have additional risk factors such as hypertension. This was of major concern to 
the  CHMP  also  in  the  context  of  the  increase  in  blood  pressure  seen  in  the  NB  treated  patients 
compared to placebo. A long-term safety outcomes study was requested by the FDA  (NB-CVOT Light 
trial) to assess the occurrence of MACE with NB treatment versus placebo in patients at increased CV 
risk of adverse CV outcomes (pre-existing CV disease and/or diabetes) and is ongoing. 
The Applicant has submitted the first interim report of the NB-CVOT study. The primary objective of 
the study is to assess NB compared to placebo with regard to the occurrence of MACE, defined as CV 
death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), or nonfatal stroke in overweight and obese subjects.  
At time of the interim analysis, 8910 subjects were randomised, and 8905 subjects were included in 
the  ITT  population;  4450 subjects  in  the  placebo  group  and  4455  in  the  NB  group.  There  was  no 
notable  difference  in  baseline  characteristics  as  presented  by  the  Applicant.  Overall,  the  study 
included a sufficient amount of subjects with CV disease and CV risk factors. Accordingly, the majority 
of subjects were in concomitant treatment with antihypertensives, lipid altering medication and/or 
antidiabetic medication. Mean duration of drug exposure was 26.8 weeks for the placebo group and 
30.5 weeks for the NB group. At the time of the interim analysis, 1201 (27.0%) and 2746 (38.3%) 
subjects in the placebo and NB treatment group respectively, were still treated with study medication. 
The discontinuation rate was higher than seen in the phase III studies, which may be due to the study 
design (at Week 16 discontinuation of subjects with lack of response [defined as <2% weight loss 
compared to baseline] or sustained increased blood pressure [defined as ≥ 10 mmHg compared to 
baseline]). This time of evaluation (16 weeks) is in accordance with the recommendations given in the 
proposed SmPC.

The primary analysis of the ITT population shows that statistically significantly more subjects treated 
with placebo (59 subjects, 1.3%) compared to NB (35 subjects, 0.8%) experienced MACE; hazard 
ratio  (HR)  (95%CI):  0.59  (0.39-0.90),  p<0.0001.  Furthermore,  the  secondary  analysis  of  the  PP 
population (referred to as on-treatment data) showed no difference between the placebo and the NB 
treatment groups. 27 (0.6%) and 23 (0.5%) MACE events in the placebo- and NB group respectively; 
HR (95%CI): 0.79 (0.45-1.38), p=0.0006. Nonetheless, in both populations, the confidence interval 
for the hazard ratio was less than 2, which was defined as the non-inferiority margin in this interim 
analysis. MACE was not correlated with weight loss, neither as categorical (</≥2% weight loss from 
baseline) nor as continuous measure. Likewise, no correlation was observed between MACE and blood 
pressure/ heart rate.  
Overall, the results from the present interim analysis of the NB-CVOT study are reassuring and do not 
indicate an increased risk of CV disease in the short and intermediate-term. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
In all, one death was reported in the study period. The death of a 65-year old male, treated with 
NB32, was judged as unrelated to study drug. The patient had comorbidities as hypercholesterolemia, 
hypertension, and bradychardia and experienced a fatal acute myocardial infarction on day 324 of 
study drug treatment. 
During the double-blind treatment phase, of the 3239 patients treated with NB and 1515 patients 
treated with placebo, 74 and 25 patients experienced a serious adverse event (SAE). Of those 9 and 
1 SEAs were in the dose escalation phase and 65 and 24 were in the maintenance phase. Of the 74 
patients with a SAE in the Total NB group, 67 had SAEs considered unrelated to the study treatment. 
Of the 25 patients with a SAE in the placebo group, 24 had SAEs considered unrelated to the study 
treatment. 
Treatment-emergent  SAEs  were  reported  in  a  higher  percentage  of  patients  in  the  NB32 group 
compared with the NB16 group (2.5% vs. 1.6%, respectively). No SAE term was reported for more 
than one patient in the NB16 group, and no SAEs were reported in the NB48 group. 
The most common SAEs were gallbladder related and all these patients (10 [0.3%] NB patients and 
1 placebo patient) were hospitalised and underwent gallbladder surgery. No differences were found in 
gallbladder events between NB and placebo treated patients as a function of demographic subgroup, 
disease history or concomitant medications. 
Three NB treated patients in the double-blind treatment phase reported adverse events from the SOC 
of renal and urinary disorders, of those 2 were calculus ureteric. 
During the double-blind treatment period, 16 patients in the NB treated group had SAEs related to 
SOC  infections  and  infestations  compared  to  4  placebo  treated  patients.  3  NB  treated  patients 
experienced an acute myocardial infarction compared to 0 in the placebo group. In contrast to this 
finding, angina pectoris and atrial fibrillation occurred in 4 placebo treated patients (2 each diagnosis) 
and in 0 NB treated patients. 
Apart from 2 diabetes patients experiencing vasovagal syncope, the serious adverse events in the 
diabetic population were similar to the non-diabetic population for the SAEs occurring ≥2 patients.

Laboratory findings 
Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety 
Heart rate and blood pressure  
Heart rate and blood pressure were measured after 5 minutes in sitting position at every study visit, 
the average value was reported.  
- Heart rate 
Across monthly time points, mean heart rate in the placebo group generally fluctuated from baseline 
by ±1 bpm, while mean heart rate in the Total NB group from Week 4 through Week 56 tended to 
increase by approximately 2 bpm (range: 0.30 bpm to 2.58 bpm) above baseline with no apparent 
pattern over time. 
Mysimba  
Assessment Report 
EMA/805547/2015

The mean change in heart rate from baseline to endpoint was ±1 beats per minute (bpm) in both 
groups. The maximum pulse was 126 bpm in the NB group and 114 bpm in the placebo group. 
More  NB  treated  patients’  experienced  treatment-emergent  increases  of  5,  10  and  20  bpm  over 
baseline in heart rate during the double-blind treatment phase. 
- Blood pressure 
The mean decrease from baseline to endpoint in SBP was 0.28 mmHg in the NB group and 1.64 mmHg 
in the placebo group. Mean decrease from baseline to endpoint in DBP was 0.53 in the NB group and 
1.27 in the placebo group.

The difference in SBP for NB compared to placebo at week 4 was 2.39 mm Hg (95% CI: 1.85-2.94) 
and at week 52 it was 1.52 mm Hg (95% CI: 0.71-2.33). For DBP the difference compared to placebo 
at  week  4  was  1.9  mm  Hg  (95%  CI:  1.51-2.28)  and  at  week  52  it  was  1.08  mm  Hg  (95%  CI: 
0.52-1.64).

More NB treated patients compared to placebo patients had values of BP above 160/100 mmHg as 
well as increases of 10, 15 and 20 mmHg over baseline values of blood pressure. 
The mean change from baseline to maximum SBP was approximately 7 mm Hg (placebo) to 9 mm Hg 
(Total  NB)  and  the  mean  change  from  baseline  to  maximum  in  DBP  was  approximately  5 mm Hg 
(placebo) to 6 mm Hg (Total NB).  
- Heart rate and blood pressure by weight loss category and by diabetes status 
Mean  changes  in  SBP,  DBP  and  heart  rate  from  baseline  to  week  56  endpoint  (FAS)  according  to 
weight loss category (no change/gain, >0-<5%, ≥5%-<10% and ≥10%) were evaluated. The NB 
treated patients in the weight loss category no change/gain and >0-<5%, experienced increases in 
SBP and DBP. Decreases in SBP and DBP were seen for weight loss category ≥5%-<10% and ≥10% 
only, whereas the placebo treated patients had decreases in SBP and DBP regardless of weight loss 
category.

Treatment with NB yielded less decreases in SBP and DBP in the weight loss categories ≥5%-<10% 
and  ≥10%  compared  to  placebo.  In  the  weight  loss  category  ≥5%-<10%,  the  SBP  and  DBP 
decreased with 0.5 mmHg and 0.6 mmHg, respectively,  in the NB treated patients compared to 3.6 
mmHg and 3.0 mmHg in the placebo patients. In the weight loss category ≥10% the decreases in SBP 
and DBP were 2.1 mmHg and 2.2 mmHg in NB treated patients compared to 6.1 mmHg (SBP) and 4.0 
mmHg (DBP) in placebo treated patients. Heart rate decreases in the NB treated patients were seen 
in the weight loss category ≥10% only (0.3 bpm for NB patients and 2.9 in placebo patients). 
Incidences of treatment emergent increases in heart rate were comparable between diabetes and 
non-diabetes patients treated with NB indicating that diabetes patients did not react more to NB than 
non-diabetes patients regarding heart rate. Placebo treated diabetes patients had higher incidences 
of heart rate increases than placebo treated non-diabetics. 
Patients with diabetes had more often treatment-emergent increases in both SBP and DBP compared 
to patients with no diabetes and these differences were present in both the NB treated and placebo 
treated  patients,  indicating  that  diabetes  patients  are  more  prone  to  increases  in  blood  pressure, 
although it seems to be independent of NB treatment. 
- 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure 
In the sub study from NB-303, comparison of the means of average daytime and nighttime systolic 
and diastolic blood pressures showed that normal circadian rhythm was maintained for both the NB 
and placebo groups. 
The  mean  daytime  SBP  and  DBP  decreased  by  2.7  mmHg  and  1.6  mmHg  in  the  placebo  group 
whereas  both  SBP  and  DBP  increased  by  0.16  and  1.15,  respectively,  in  the  NB  treated  group  of 
patients. During nighttime, mean SBP and DBP in both the NB and placebo group decreased although 
the decrease was smaller in the NB treated group. Also the mean maximum blood pressures were 
much higher in the NB group compared to the placebo group, whereas the minimum BP values were 
more  similar  (table  2.7.4-53).  It  seems  that  NB  treated  patients  are  more  prone  to  high  blood 
pressure  increases  than  placebo  patients.  Applying  the  proposed  stopping  rule  with  evaluation  at 
Week 16 should ensure that treatment with NB is not continued in patients with concerns with the 
safety and tolerability of ongoing treatment. The need to discontinue treatment if increased blood 
pressure is included in the warning section of the SmPC.

ECG 
In the NB clinical trials, there was no evidence of treatment-related QTc prolongation in NB-treated 
patients  compared  with  placebo.  Cardiac  arrhythmias  were  uncommon  in  NB  clinical  trials  and  no 
instances of life-threatening arrhythmias were reported. Neither naltrexone nor bupropion alone are 
reported  to  prolong  the  QTc  interval  or  cause  rapidly  activating  delayed  rectifier  K+  current  (iKr) 
blockade. 
Review  of  ECG  reports  in  the  Diabetic  dataset  indicated  no  changes  from  baseline  across  the 
treatment  groups  and  no  difference  between  groups,  especially  with  respect  to  changes  in  QTc, 
occurrence  of  ECG-related  serious  or  non-serious  TEAEs,  or  in  individual  clinically  significant  ECG 
findings. 
Haematology and Chemistry 
Haematology 
Mean values for haematology samples for all dose groups, including Total NB, individual doses, and 
placebo, were within the normal range at baseline and at endpoint in the Primary Dataset. 7.3% of NB 
treated patients experienced a shift to low lymphocyte values compared to 3.7% in the placebo group. 
Three  patients  in  the  total  NB  group  discontinued  the  study  due  to  abnormal  laboratory  findings 
(decreased  haematocrit  and  leukopenia)  and  two  of  them  were  considered  to  be  drug  related, 
however not serious.

Increased  mean  serum  creatinine  throughout  the  study  period  were  seen  for  NB  treated  patients 
(both NB16 and NB32), although a small reduction in serum creatinine at week 56 relative to week 4 
was seen. 2 patients had a single serum creatinine measurement above 2 mg/dl (normal range 0.5-1 
mg/dl  in  females,  0.7-1.2  mg/dl  in  males).  One  patient  continued  the  study  as  all  other 
measurements were normal. The other patient had 3 measurements above ULN which returned to 
normal afterwards. The patient discontinued due to lack of efficacy. No changes in creatinine in the 
placebo group were observed. Bupropion and its metabolites inhibit the organic cation transporter 2 
(OCT2) in the basolateral membrane in the renal tubules, and that could be an explanation for the 
increased creatinine during study treatment. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was unchanged in both NB 
and placebo groups.  
For patients with diabetes compared with patients without diabetes shifts to high creatinine occurred 
at  a  higher  incidence  in  the  NB32  group  compared  with  the  placebo  group  for  both  the  Diabetic 
(12.7% and 3.1%, respectively) and Non-diabetic Datasets (7.5% and 1.7%, respectively). This was 
addressed  in  the  D120  list  of  questions.  The  Applicant  explained  that  no  difference  in  mean 
placebo-corrected increase in creatinine from baseline to endpoint was observed between subjects 
with/without DM and reassuringly, concomitant use of metformin did not affect changes in creatinine. 
The explanation for the observation is probably that the group of DM subjects had a higher baseline 
creatinine compared to the group of subjects without DM. This is considered a plausible explanation 
and in clinical practice, it is not expected to pose a major safety concern. In section 4.4 of the SmPC, 
it is recommended to assess estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) prior to initiating therapy with 
naltrexone / bupropion in individuals who are at elevated risk for renal impairment (including but not 
limited to patients with diabetes).

Safety in special populations 
Elderly 
In the primary dataset, higher incidences of dizziness, tremor and hypertension were noted in NB 
patients ≥65 years old compared to younger NB patients (age categories 18-44 and 45-64 years old). 
These events rarely resulted in study discontinuation. The small number of patients in the ≥65 year 
old group (n=62, Primary Dataset) and overrepresentation of patients with diabetes in this age group 
makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. 
Additional data are available from Study NB-CVOT in subjects ≥ 65 years of age (Table 151-1). These 
confirm that the incidence of adverse events increases with age. Among subjects ≥65–<75 years, 
32.5% in the NB group experienced an AELDSM compared to 9.2% in the placebo group. For subjects 
≥75 years, 45.5% and 8.1% in the NB and placebo group respectively, experienced an AELDSM. Also 
the percentage of serious adverse events increased with age, and 12.3% of all subjects aged ≥75 
years and treated with NB experienced a serious adverse event. Based on these results, the Applicant 
has agreed to include information regarding the elderly in section 4.2 of the SmPC. Subjects aged 
≥65–<75  years  should  be  treated  with  caution  and  use  of  NB  in  patients  ≥75  years  is  not 
recommended. 
Patients with diabetes 
Type 1 DM was an exclusion criterion in the clinical studies but Trial NB-304 included patients with 
T2DM. Thus, NB treatment was evaluated in 333 T2DM patients and the findings in this patient group 
are discussed in the different sections of this discussion on clinical safety. 
The CVOT study also included a substantial number of patients with diabetes. Based on these data, 
only few subjects reduced the dose or discontinued metformin treatment with no noticeable difference 
between treatment groups. Concomitant use of NB and metformin is not expected to pose problems. 
Patients with renal impairment 
Please also refer to section on pharmacokinetics.  
27% of subjects in Study NB-CVOT (interim results) had renal impairment (eGFR <90 mL/min) at 
screening with 15% of these subjects (n=348) classified as having moderate renal impairment (eGFR 
30 to 59 mL/min). While incidences on placebo are similar, there is a clear pattern of more adverse 
events leading to study discontinuation in patients with renal impairment than in patients with normal 
renal function in the NB group.

Patients with hepatic impairment 
NB  was  not  investigated  in  patients  with  hepatic  impairment.  Please  also  refer  to  the  section  on 
pharmacokinetics. 
Pregnancy and lactation 
In the Primary dataset (women only) there were 20 (0.74%) pregnancies with at least 7 days of foetal 
exposure in the NB group resulting in 10 normal babies and 6 (0.48%) pregnancies in the placebo 
group  resulting  in  5  normal  babies.  No  congenital  abnormalities  were  observed.  4  of  the  20 
pregnancies resulted in 4 spontaneous miscarriages and 3 of 20 in elective terminations in the NB 
group compared to 0 in the placebo group. Bupropion, naltrexone and their metabolites are excreted 
in breast milk. NB should not be used in pregnant women, women intending to become pregnant and 
lactating women. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions, overdose, 
abuse and ability to drive/operate machinery 
Please refer to section on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics for drug-drug interactions. 
Potential  for  interaction  between  the  sustained  release  drug  product  and  alcohol  is  an  important 
safety  consideration.  In  vitro  dissolution  testing  of  naltrexone  and  bupropion  from  NB  tablets  at 
varying alcohol concentrations demonstrated that drug release does not exceed release rates into 
standard aqueous media. Therefore, there is no concern of acute release of drug when NB tablets are 
ingested in the presence of alcohol. 
No  events  of  overdose  were  observed  in  the  NB  clinical  programme.  Overdose  with  bupropion  as 
monotherapy  has  been  reported  and  seizures  were  reported  in  one  third  of  cases.  Other  serious 
reactions reported with overdoses of bupropion alone included hallucinations, loss of consciousness, 
sinus tachycardia, and ECG changes such as conduction disturbances (including QRS prolongation) or 
arrhythmias. There is no clinical experience with naltrexone overdose. 
There  were  no  deaths  or  SAEs  attributable  to  drug  abuse  or  withdrawal,  no  overdoses,  and  no 
evidence of drug diversion or inappropriate self-administration with NB in the clinical development 
programme.  
There was no indication of a discontinuation-emergent withdrawal syndrome in the integrated safety 
analysis.  Examination of safety data  from the NB clinical development programme shows that NB 
does affect cognitive ability (see previous sections). The incidence of injuries was similar between 
NB-treated patients and placebo-treated patients.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The majority of discontinuations due to adverse events happened in the dose-escalation phase, where 
17.4% of the NB treated patients discontinued the study compared to 4.4% placebo treated patients. 
The  most  common  adverse  event  leading  to  discontinuation  (i.e.,  adverse  events  occurring  at  a 
≥1.0% incidence in the Total NB group and higher than the incidence of the placebo group) in the 
dose-escalating phase in NB treated patients was nausea (5.5% of NB patients, <0.1% [1 patient] of 
placebo patients). 
During the whole double-blind treatment phase, 23.8% of the NB treated patients discontinued the 
study due to an adverse event, again nausea was the most frequently reason to discontinue the study 
in  the  NB  treated  patients.  In  placebo  treated  patients  11.9%  discontinued  the  study  due  to  an 
adverse event. The percentages of patients discontinuing after the dose-escalation phase is similar in 
the NB and placebo group (6.4% in NB group and 7.5% in the placebo group). There were no patterns 
in the adverse events in the placebo group. In general, the incidence of discontinuations due to an 
adverse event was similar among NB dose groups, although in the Overall dataset a dose-response 
relationship for the incidence of nausea is suggested: 5.1% for NB16, 6.2% for NB32 and 13% for 
NB48/NB50. 
In  the  analyses  of  adverse  events  leading  to  discontinuation  by  baseline  characteristics  and  a 
≥5% weight loss at endpoint, the overall incidence of  adverse events leading to discontinuation was 
higher  for  females,  Hispanics,  and  non-smokers  in  the  Total  NB  group  compared  with  males, 
non-Hispanics  and  smokers,  respectively;  in  the  placebo  group,  incidences  were  similar  between 
these subgroups. These differences were judged as not clinically relevant. 
Patients with diabetes, discontinued the study more than non-diabetic patients in both the NB group 
and  placebo  group.  Nausea  was  more  pronounced  in  the  diabetes  population,  and  almost  10% 
discontinued  the  study  because  of  nausea.  Concomitant  treatment  with  metformin  might  be  a 
contributing factor but in general, few patients had their NB dose reduced or discontinued metformin. 
Overall, concomitant treatment with metformin and NB does not warrant precautions.

Even though potential hepatotoxicity with elevated liver enzyme values was similar among NB and 
placebo patients (1.2% vs 1.1%), 0.2% of NB-treated patients (8 of 38 patients) discontinued the 
study due to elevated liver enzymes compared to 0.1% of placebo patients (2 of 16).  
More  NB-treated  patients  discontinued  the  study  due  to  skin  reactions  (1.6%  in  the  NB  group 
compared to 0.7% in the placebo group), though overall, the occurrence of skin reactions was similar 
in both treatment groups. Also serious adverse events (systemic reactions) were similar in the two 
groups (3 in the NB group and 2 in the placebo group). 
Post marketing experience 
During  the  review  of  the  application  the  MAH  provided  supplementary  information  on  two 
spontaneous serious  adverse reactions reported postmarketing in the USA.  
One case referred to a patient with apparent exacerbation of existing Bell’s palsy and the other to a 
patient who experienced an event of vomiting, sweating, asthenia, and convulsions.   
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  clinical  safety  of  NB  is  derived  from  a  total  of  24  studies  in  the  NB  clinical  programme.  It 
comprises 15 Phase 1, five Phase 2, and four Phase 3 studies. Three integrated datasets have been 
defined: The primary dataset, the overall dataset and the non-diabetic/diabetic dataset - all including 
data from all randomised patients who were administered at least one tablet of study treatment and 
had at least one investigator contact/assessment at any time after the start of study treatment. The 
three datasets are considered to be appropriate and adequate to facilitate the evaluation of the safety 
and tolerability of NB.

In addition, interim data have been provided from the ongoing Study NB-CVOT. These data are not 
included  in  the  datasets  outlined  above  and  thus  not  contributing  to  the  figures  derived  from  the 
integrated datasets, but are discussed separately when appropriate. 
Of the 3239 subjects receiving NB, 1663 (51.3%) received ≥ 365 days (1 year) of NB treatment and 
1580  (48.8%)  had  exposures  of  ≥ 56  weeks  (reflecting  at  least  52  weeks  of  exposure  at  the 
maintenance dose). The vast majority received the NB32 dose. The size of the safety database, both 
overall and in terms of long-term exposure is considered satisfactory. 
The drop-out rate was relatively high, almost 50% both in the NB groups (NB16 and NB32) and the 
placebo group. Although drop-out rates are high in obesity trials, they have been seen lower than 
observed in the NB programme. The majority of patients discontinuing the treatment with NB did so 
in the first 8 weeks (approximately 25-34%). 
Most patients were White (about 75%), female (about 82%) and between the ages of 45 and 64 years 
(about 53%). In the study of patients with type 2 diabetes (NB-304), patients were generally older 
and the gender distribution more balanced than in the other Phase 3 studies. Demographic data were 
well balanced across treatment groups. 
Only 62 elderly patients aged ≥65 years received NB in the Phase 3 programme. However, there is 
more substantial experience in elderly patients in the ongoing CVOT study. Interim results from this 
study reveal poorer tolerability of NB in elderly than in non-elderly patients. Therefore the Applicant 
has  agreed  that  NB  should  be  used  with  caution  in  subjects  age  ≥65–<75  years  and  is  not 
recommended to subjects ≥75 years.  
Adverse events were more frequent on NB (about 86%) than on placebo (about 75%). This difference 
was more pronounced during the dose-escalation phase. 
Nausea was the most common adverse event on NB affecting about one third of NB patients compared 
to about 7% of placebo patients. For NB patients, it peaked within 4 weeks and resolved in most 
patients by 24 weeks, but also caused many discontinuations. Anti-nausea medication was allowed, 
but the actual use was very limited.  
Constipation and headache were reported by 18% and 17% in NB patients, respectively, compared to 
7.2%  and  10.4%  in  placebo  patients.  Vomiting,  dizziness,  insomnia  and  dry  mouth  were  other 
frequent adverse events, which were more commonly seen in NB patients than in patients on placebo. 
About 12% of adverse events occurring >0.4% and at least twice the incidence of placebo in the NB 
group were categorized as severe compared to about 7% in the placebo group.  
As expected, patients with T2DM experienced more adverse events. However, the difference in the 
incidence  of  some  adverse  events  between  NB  and  placebo  appeared  more  pronounced.  A  higher 
incidence of shift to higher creatinine among diabetic patients treated with NB compared to placebo 
was observed. This may be attributed to the slightly higher baseline creatinine observed among T2DM 
patients. T2DM was also associated with a higher incidence of gastrointestinal disorders, however, 
this is not considered to raise any major safety concerns. Concomitant use of NB and metformin is not 
considered  to  pose  any  safety  concerns.  Several  adverse  events  exhibited  a  clear  dose-response 
relationship, e.g. nausea, vomiting and dizziness. 
CNS related safety 
Psychiatric side effects and suicide have been a great concern with weight control agents, in particular 
since the withdrawal of Acomplia from the market. Generally, the evaluation of psychiatric events was 
acceptable,  among  others  using  the  Columbia  Classification  Algorithm  of  Suicide  Assessment 
(C-CASA).  Depression and suicide/self-injury did not appear to occur more frequently with NB than 
with placebo. Anxiety appeared to be more common in NB-treated patients than in patients receiving 
Mysimba  
Assessment Report

placebo. Insomnia was clearly more common during titration in the NB group than in the placebo 
group.  The  interim  analysis  of  the  CVOT  study,  which  included  more  patients  with  psychiatric 
co-morbidity, is discussed below.  
Reassuringly,  the  use  of  sedatives/hypnotics  was  similar  between  the  treatment  groups  both  at 
initiation and end of study medication, and no difference in new users of sedatives/hypnotics was seen 
between treatment groups. Cognitive symptoms were not frequent, but occurred three times more 
frequently on NB than on placebo.  
Epileptic seizures - a well-known side effect of bupropion, especially at high doses – occurred in two 
patients on NB and none on placebo. A further seizure was reported in a patient on NB in the CVOT. 
The incidence was less than 0.1% which is the frequency estimate often given for bupropion. History 
of - or current - seizures should be (and has been proposed as) a contraindication. As no toxicology 
study was conducted with the combination, any potentiation of the convulsive effects of bupropion or 
its metabolites by naltrexone has not been investigated in the non-clinical setting.  
The effects on cognitive function and seizure will be monitored in the Post marketing setting.  
Although it may seem reassuring that, except for insomnia and anxiety, psychiatric events such as 
depression and suicidality were not more common in NB patients than in patients receiving placebo, 
the proportion of subjects with a history of depression at baseline was low in all Phase 3 trials. The 
studies therefore may not be representative of the target population who are likely to have a higher 
proportion of depression. The Applicant was requested to discuss the validity of the measures used to 
assess depression in these studies. Further, the Applicant was asked to discuss whether other CNS 
disorders  have  been  adequately  represented  in  the  selected  study  population  and  provide 
reassurance that NB can be safely administered to these patients. The Applicant provided an analysis 
and  discussion  using  interim  results  from  the  ongoing  Study  NB-CVOT.  In  this  study  (as  per  the 
interim analysis), 24% of subjects were on an antidepressant medication. The incidence of SAEs in 
the psychiatric class was low and comparable between treatment groups. It is noteworthy that the 
incidence of psychiatric adverse events leading to study discontinuation was about three times higher 
in  NB-treated  patients  than  those  on  placebo,  with  anxiety  and  insomnia  being  the  main  causes. 
Therefore, whilst it is accepted that there would appear to be little evidence of an effect of NB32 on the 
risk of depression or suicidality, there does appear to be an increased risk of anxiety, insomnia and 
cognitive  symptoms,  an  effect  which  appears  to  be  particularly  prevalent  in  diabetic  patients  and 
those with a greater CV risk. The Applicant argues that the increased risk of anxiety and insomnia is 
likely to be a direct effect of the sympathomimetic actions of bupropion and not an effect on mood as 
such. This is considered a speculative, although not implausible explanation. 
Other 
There was a small, but increased incidence of patients with a marked increase in serum creatinine in 
the NB group compared to placebo. This was also reflected in the mean change from baseline by visit. 
The increase did not appear to progress over time. According to the Applicant, the likely reason is that 
bupropion and its metabolites competitively inhibit the OCT2 in the basolateral membrane of the renal 
tubule responsible for creatinine secretion. This explanation is accepted by the CHMP. 
Naltrexone has been associated with hepatotoxicity. In the NB programme, these events were not 
clearly more common on NB than on placebo. However, more NB-treated patients discontinued the 
study due to elevated transaminases compared to placebo. Gallbladder events are sometimes seen in 
patients experiencing weight loss, but these events also occurred at similar frequencies in the NB and 
the placebo group. 
Mysimba  
Assessment Report 
EMA/805547/2015 
Page 112/132 
  
 
Skin  reactions  –  observed  with  both  individual  medicines  -  also  occurred  at  similar  rates  (NB  vs. 
placebo), but there were more discontinuations due to these events on NB than on placebo. Male 
sexual dysfunction occurred more frequently on NB than on placebo, but at low rates.  
Cardiovascular safety 
Bupropion is known to have sympathomimetic effects, and consequently cardiovascular safety is a 
key  focus  area  for  NB.  Generally,  one  would  expect  weight  loss  to  be  associated  with  favorable 
cardiovascular (CV) effects, either evaluated using surrogates such as blood pressure, blood lipids 
and  glycaemic  parameters,  or  ideally  using  more  robust  clinical  endpoints  such  as  major  adverse 
cardiovascular events (MACE). 
However,  NB  was  associated  with  smaller  decreases  in  systolic  and  diastolic  blood  pressure  than 
placebo. Even if the mean difference in change from baseline was small, the poorer performance of NB 
on  reducing  the  BP  as  compared  with  placebo  was  a  consistent  finding  irrespective  of  analysis 
method:  a.  looking  at  blood  pressure  as  a  continuous  variable;  b.  categorical  analyses  of  blood 
pressure; or c. analyses of increased blood pressure reported as an adverse event. Therefore, the 
CHMP  considered  necessary  to  mention  this  concern  in  the  SmPC  in  relation  to  the  need  for  
discontinuation of treatment .  
There was also an indication of an increase in heart rate with NB compared to placebo, albeit the 
difference was small. Tachycardia was more commonly reported with NB than with placebo. Finally, in 
the  Phase  3  programme,  MACE  (by  two  different  definitions)  occurred  more  frequently  in  the  NB 
group than in the placebo group.  
Consequently, the CV safety of NB was a major concern to the CHMP. The Applicant has responded by 
providing  interim  results  from  the  ongoing  CVOT  study.  The  primary  purpose  of  this  study  is  to 
investigate  the  CV  safety  of  NB  in  weight  management.  The  primary  analysis  based  on  the  ITT 
population  shows  that  statistically  significantly  more  subjects  treated  with  placebo  (59  subjects, 
1.3%) compared to NB (35 subjects, 0.8%) experienced MACE; hazard  ratio (HR) (95%CI): 0.59 
(0.39-0.90). Further, the secondary analysis of the PP population (referred to as on-treatment data) 
showed no difference between the placebo and the NB treatment groups (27 (0.6%) and 23 (0.5%) 
MACE events in the placebo and NB group respectively; HR (95%CI): 0.79 (0.45-1.38)). Hence, in 
both populations, the confidence interval for the hazard ratio was less than 2, which was defined as 
the non-inferiority margin in this interim analysis. Overall, the results are considered reassuring with 
regard to the short- and intermediate-term CV safety of NB as the results from the present interim 
analysis do not indicate an increased risk of major CV disease related to NB treatment. The incidence 
of MACE/Four point expanded MACE was correlated with neither weight loss nor decrease in blood 
pressure or heart rate. 
The Applicant has provided the additional sensitivity analysis requested by the CHMP for the interim 
data from study NB-CVOT. In the original analysis, all MACE events were included, irrespective of the 
length of time between treatment cessation and the occurrence of the event. Whilst this allowed for 
capture of a larger number of events, it introduced some uncertainty into the conclusions drawn from 
the analyses, since events which occur after longer periods off-treatment may be less clearly related 
to the treatment, but influenced instead by other factors.  
The  analysis  presented  by  the  Applicant  included  events  censored  at  different  time  points  after 
discontinuation  of  treatment.  Even  when  only  on-treatments  events  are  considered,  the  point 
estimate of the hazard ratio is still below 1, and the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval falls 
below 1.4. This provides some reassurance that the signal of no increase in MACE events from this 
interim analysis of data from the NB-CVOT study is not dominated by off-treatment events which may 
have been related to factors other than exposure to the treatment.

Furthermore,  the  CHMP  requested  that  the  applicant  provides  further  information  on  the  ongoing 
CVOT (Light trial) after 50% of event as a post authorization commitment. 
The applicant has planned a new CVOT study (CVOT2), which will not mandate cessation of treatment 
in non-responders at 16 weeks. This will provide information on the safety and efficacy of exposure 
over longer periods and will give information on the continued need for the stopping rule. 
The final study report is planned by 31 March 2022. 
The CVOT2 study will be a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 4 study 
to assess the effect of naltrexone extended release (ER) /bupropion ER on the occurrence of major 
adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in overweight and obese subjects. This study will monitor the 
long  term  CV  risk  (classified  as  MACE  events)  and  is  included  as  a  condition  to  the  Marketing 
Authorization (annex II of the product information).  
Therefore, the CHMP requested to review the CVOT2 study protocol by 31 March 2015 for agreement. 
This study will be monitored regularly by a Data Monitoring Committee and the key aspects of the 
DMC charter will be provided to the CHMP, when reviewing the protocol. If the DMC recommends that 
the study is stopped prematurely, the applicant should inform the CHMP immediately and the final 
report will need to be submitted within 6 months after study discontinuation. 
Since it is plausible that the off-treatment risk is correlated with the length of time on treatment, and 
in order to reduce the noise around signal of increased risk in those only exposed to treatment for 
relatively short periods, the CHMP recommends altering the design of the second study investigating 
cardiovascular  safety  planned  by  the  Applicant  (CVOT-2)  with  regard  to  the  censoring  of  events. 
Whilst the CHMP agrees with the censoring of events occurring beyond 12 months after treatment 
discontinuation in those patients who received treatment for more than 12 months, two options are 
proposed for the censoring of events in patients receiving treatment for less than 12 months. In this 
group, events could either be censored after 6 months off treatment, or after a period equivalent to 
the time on treatment (e.g. in a patient on treatment for only 4 months, events beyond 4 months off 
treatment  would  be  censored).  The  CHMP  recommends  that  one  of  these  designs  should  be 
incorporated into the design of study CVOT-2.   
In the NB clinical trials, there was no evidence of treatment-related QTc prolongation in NB-treated 
patients.  Cardiac  arrhythmias  were  uncommon  in  the  trials,  and  no  instances  of  life-threatening 
arrhythmias  were  reported.  This  is  in  line  with  the  experience  with  naltrexone  and  bupropion  as 
individual medicines. 
There  was  a  tendency  to  lower  lymphocyte  counts  in  NB-treated  patients  than  in  patients  in  the 
placebo group. The Applicant addressed any association between the incidence of infections in the NB 
treated group and the reduction in lymphocyte values. Further data provided by the Applicant showed 
that  subjects  with  lower  lymphocyte  counts  have  more  infections/infestations  than  subjects  with 
normal  lymphocyte  counts,  but  there  was  no  apparent  difference  in  the  incidence  of 
infections/infestations between the Total NB and the placebo group (45.4% vs. 44.0%). Moreover, 
there appeared no characteristic pattern in the infections/infestations reported among subjects with 
shifts to lower lymphocyte values, which is reassuring. 
Other  haematology  and  chemistry  variables  than  the  ones  mentioned  above  were  generally 
unremarkable with regard to effects of NB. 
Because of no or very limited exposure, the safety datasets did not allow a direct evaluation of the 
safety in elderly patients (age ≥65 years), paediatric patients (age <18 years) or patients with renal 
or hepatic impairment. Consequently, NB should not be used in patients with moderate renal failure 
or mild or moderate hepatic impairment. NB is contraindicated in patients with severe and end-stage 
Mysimba

renal impairment and hepatic impairment. Treatment of the elderly and patients with renal or hepatic 
impairment is sufficiently addressed in the SmPC.  
Furthermore, the Applicant has presented a plan for the post-approval investigation of the safety and 
efficacy of NB32 in patients with renal and hepatic impairment, including multiple-dose PK studies as 
requested by the CHMP.  
Use of NB in pregnant women was of course prohibited in the NB clinical programme. Nevertheless, 
there  were  20  pregnancies  in  the  NB  group.  None  of  them  were  reported  to  result  in  congenital 
abnormalities, but there were 4 spontaneous abortions in NB-treated pregnant women versus none in 
pregnant women who received placebo. The issue was raised to the Applicant, but it is agreed that the 
rate  of  spontaneous  abortions  observed  in  the  NB  group  (20%)  is  within  the  normal  rate.  The 
Applicant has provided narratives for the four women with spontaneous abortion. Three of the four 
women had confounding factors potentially predisposing for spontaneous abortion. Use of NB during 
pregnancy should not be recommended. This is sufficiently addressed in the SmPC. 
For drug-drug interaction, please refer to the sections on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. 
No events of overdose were observed in the NB clinical programme. In the SmPC, management of NB 
overdose is described adequately. 
Adverse events associated with withdrawal from NB were examined in Study NB-301. It included a 
2-week  blinded  discontinuation  phase  for  those  subjects  still  enrolled  at  the  end  of  the  active 
treatment phase. There was no indication of withdrawal effects. The investigations to evaluate acute 
withdrawal effects are considered acceptable.  
The majority of discontinuations due to adverse events occurred in the dose-escalation phase, where 
about 17% of the NB-treated patients discontinued the study compared to about 4% placebo treated 
patients. Nausea was the main culprit in these early discontinuations. During the entire treatment 
phase,  about  one  quarter  of  the  NB  treated  patients  discontinued  the  study  due  to  an  AE.  Again, 
nausea was the most frequent reason to discontinue in the NB treated patients.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The major objection regarding the cardiovascular safety of NB has been resolved with the interim data 
provided  in  the  application  together  with  additional  sensitivity  analyses.  In  addition,  the  CHMP 
considered the need to continue monitoring of CV safety and agreed with the Applicant’s plans to 
investigate longer-term cardiovascular safety in a second cardiovascular outcome study (NB-CVOT 
2). Further, the Applicant has presented a plan for the post-approval investigation of the safety and 
efficacy of NB32 in patients with renal and hepatic impairment.  
From  the  safety  database  all  events  considered  adverse  reactions  reported  in  clinical  trials  and 
post-marketing (monocomponents) have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
The  CHMP  considers  that  the  measures  necessary  to  address  issues  related  to  safety  have  been 
adequately addressed in the RMP and are reflected in the annex II condition of the opinion.

2.7.  Pharmacovigilance system   
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  Applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements and provides adequate evidence that the applicant has the services of a qualified person 
responsible for pharmacovigilance and has the necessary means for the notification of any adverse 
reaction suspected of occurring either in the Community or in a third country. 
2.8.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 06 could be acceptable if the applicant 
implements the changes to the RMP as described in the advice.  
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 04 is acceptable if the applicant 
implements the changes to the RMP as described in the PRAC advice.  
The CHMP endorsed this advice with the following changes: 
- addition of the indication to the key elements to be included in the prescriber guide 
- change the proposed categorisation of the CVOT 2 study from category 3 to category 1 (Annex II 
condition) 
The applicant implemented the changes in the RMP as requested by PRAC and CHMP.  
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 08 with the following content:

The  clinical  programme  included  four  pivotal  studies  randomised,  double-blind,  multicentre, 
placebo-controlled  conducted  in  obese  and  overweight  subjects  receiving  customary  diet  and 
behavioural  counselling,  including  prescribed  exercise  (Studies  NB-301  and  NB-303)  and  in 
obese/overweight subjects undergoing intensive lifestyle modification counselling (Study NB-302). 
One study was conducted in obese/overweight subjects with type 2 diabetes (Study NB-304).  
Studies NB-301, NB-302 and NB-303 enrolled subjects with a BMI ≥30 and ≤45 kg/m2 for subjects 
with uncomplicated obesity and with a BMI of ≥27 and ≤45 kg/m2 for overweight or obese subjects 
with controlled hypertension and/or dyslipidaemia.  The type 2 diabetes patients enrolled in Study 
NB-304 were to have a BMI ≥27 to ≤45 kg/m2.  
In  NB-301,  NB-302  and  NB-304  studies,  the  mean  weight  loss  change  from  baseline  in  the  ITT 
analysis using LOCF as imputation method ranged from -8.1% to -3.7 % in NB group compared to 
-4.9% to -1.3% in placebo group  at week 56. In NB-303 the mean weight loss change from baseline 
in the ITT analysis using LOCF as imputation method was -5.7%  in the NB group compared to -1.9% 
in the placebo group  at week 28. 
Treatment  with  NB32  resulted  in  statistically  significant  weight  loss  compared  with  placebo  in 
overweight/obese  patients  with  or  without  hypertension  or  dyslipidaemia,  as  well  as  in 
overweight/obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  The percentage of patients loosing ≥5 % 
weight loss ranged from 46% to 28% in the NB group compared with 34% to 12% in the placebo 
group (analysis in the Randomised population using BOCF as imputation method). 
When using more conservative imputation methods, such as BOCF, the difference between NB and 
placebo diminished. 
The  weight  loss  with  NB32  was  modest-moderate.  The  placebo-subtracted  weight  loss  with  NB 
amounted to 3-4% when using the ITT analysis set and LOCF as imputation method –  depending on 
study  and  study  population.  Using  the  criterion  of  ≥ 10%  decrease  in  weight  from  baseline  to 
endpoint, the NNT was 4.8 (Phase 3) and 11.1 (NB-CVOT).   
The weight loss was accompanied by favourable effects on a number of secondary efficacy variables 
such  as  waist  circumference,  blood  lipids  (mainly  HDL-cholesterol  and  triglycerides)  and  hs-CRP. 
There  were  also  favourable  effects  in  glycaemic  control,  both  in  non-diabetics  but  particularly  in 
patients with type 2 diabetes. 
The efficacy appeared stable over approximately one year and robust across various demographic and 
baseline characteristics. 
In conclusion, the efficacy results suggest a modest effect of NB32 in producing weight loss. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
There is uncertainty regarding the true size of the effect given the high drop-out rate  (around 50%), 
and  the use of an imputation method for missing data (LOCF) which may overestimate the treatment 
effect. The conducted sensitivity analyses point to a lower treatment effect than the one calculated for 
the primary analysis. 
Although  some  data  have  been  provided  to  show  an  effect  of  treatment  on  secondary  outcome 
variables, such as waist circumference, insulin resistance and glycaemic control in diabetic patients, 
firm conclusions of a reduction in the risk of progression to type 2 diabetes or improved glycaemic 
control in diabetics are difficult to draw from the data, and in any case, remain secondary to a primary 
effect on weight, which is modest. 
There is also uncertainty about the efficacy in elderly patients (over 65 years of age) because only 
very  few elderly patients were included in the  Phase 3 trials, although the interim analysis of the 
Mysimba  
Assessment Report 
EMA/805547/2015 
Page 127/132 
  
 
ongoing  Study  NB-CVOT  did  indicate  efficacy  in  elderly  patients  to  be  similar  to  that  seen  in 
non-elderly patients.  
A dedicated study in patients with type 2 diabetes suggested less efficacy in these patients when 
compared  to  non-diabetic  subjects.  However,  data  from  the  ongoing  NB-CVOT  study  provide 
reassurance in this respect.  
An analysis of efficacy by BMI strata based on the Phase 3 programme indicated that the weight loss 
was more pronounced in patients with the lowest BMI. However, this uncertainty about the relevance 
of the effect of NB in patients with the highest need of weight loss has been reduced significantly by 
interim data from the ongoing NB-CVOT study with considerably larger patient numbers. These data 
showed comparable efficacy across all investigated BMI groups. 
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
A number of adverse events were more common in patients receiving NB than in patients on placebo, 
most notably nausea, but also constipation, headache, vomiting, dizziness, insomnia and dry mouth 
appear to be frequent adverse reactions to NB. 
Several  adverse  events  appeared  mostly  during  the  titration  phase.  A  considerable  part  of  early 
discontinuations on NB can be attributed to adverse events. 
The mean change from baseline at 1 year in systolic blood pressure in the pivotal studies was -1.6 
mmHg in placebo subjects and -0.3 mmHg in NB subjects. The change in diastolic BP was similar. In 
the NB-CVOT study, the respective figures were +0.2 mmHg in placebo subjects and +0.7 mmHg in 
NB subjects. In the pivotal studies, the increase in systolic BP in NB subjects was most noticeable in 
those patients either not losing weight, or losing less than 5% of bodyweight. In NB-treated patients 
who lost at least 5% of body weight, the blood pressure decreased, though by a smaller amount than 
in placebo patients. 
In the pivotal studies, the mean heart rate in the placebo group generally fluctuated from baseline by 
±1 bpm, while mean heart rate in NB patients tended to increase by approximately 2 bpm above 
baseline.  
Cognitive symptoms were not frequent, but occurred more frequently on NB than on placebo. 
It is likely that NB in rare cases will cause epileptic seizures since bupropion is known to lower the 
seizure threshold. The same applies to other infrequent adverse reactions of naltrexone or bupropion 
(hepatotoxicity, skin reactions). 
Except for insomnia and anxiety (mainly during titration), psychiatric events such as depression and 
suicidality were not more common in NB patients than in patients receiving placebo. This also applied 
to  the  ongoing  cardiovascular  outcome  study  which  enrolled  patients  with  a  higher  degree  of 
psychiatric comorbidity than did the Phase 3 studies. 
Even though the numbers are very small, in clinical studies, the number of MI events was higher in the 
NB  group  compared  to  the  placebo  group.  However,  based  on  interim  results  from  the  ongoing 
cardiovascular outcome study, NB appears not to be associated with an excess incidence of major 
adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). This provides reassurance about the cardiovascular safety in 
the short and intermediate-term.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
There  is  uncertainty  about  the  safety  and  tolerability  in  elderly  patients,  in  patients  with  renal  or 
hepatic  impairment  and  in  patients  with  various  co-morbid  conditions  often  associated  with 
overweight/obesity because of no or limited experience in these subpopulations. In addition, interim 
Mysimba  
Assessment Report 
EMA/805547/2015 
Page 128/132 
  
 
 
results from Study NB-CVOT suggest poorer tolerability in elderly patients and patients with renal 
impairment. Appropriate restrictions have been inserted in the SmPC for elderly patients and patients 
with renal or hepatic impairment. The use of NB in renal and hepatic impairment should be further 
investigated in the post-authorisation setting. 
Although  results  on  depressive  and  suicidal  symptoms  may  appear  reassuring,  there  is  still  some 
uncertainty  about  adverse  CNS  (including  psychiatric)  effects  in  at  risk  populations  because  the 
baseline incidence of psychiatric and other CNS illnesses in the study population was low. However, 
Study NB-CVOT included patients with more psychiatric co-morbidity than the Phase 3 studies, and 
interim results did not indicate excess depressive and suicidal symptoms in patients treated with NB 
compared to placebo. 
There  is  also  some  uncertainty  as  to  whether  the  incidence  of  seizures  will  be  higher  than  with 
licensed bupropion medicines since the bupropion dose in NB is higher and because any potentiation 
of the convulsive effects of bupropion by naltrexone is unknown. Also, it is known that certain factors 
increase the predisposition to seizure with bupropion, such as concomitant use of antidepressants, 
alcohol abuse, and diabetes treated with hypoglycaemics or insulin. Such factors may be a feature in 
the target population for NB and could potentially increase the seizure risk.  
However,  although  the  daily  dose  of  bupropion  with  NB  will  slightly  exceed  the  daily  dose  when 
bupropion is used in its licensed indications, there are PK data to support that the exposure both in 
terms of peak concentrations and AUC following recommended doses of NB will be very similar to the 
exposure  following  recommended  doses  of  bupropion  in  its  licensed  indications.  Furthermore,  the 
seizure  rates  in  the  NB  clinical  programme  are  low  and  have  not  exceeded  the  rates  from  the 
bupropion  licensed  indications.  This  also  applies  to  the  ongoing  NB-CVOT  study  which  allowed 
inclusion of patients with a wider range of comorbidities .  
Although  the  interim  results  are  reassuring  with  regard  to  cardiovascular  safety  in  the  short  and 
intermediate-term, there is some uncertainty with respect to long-term cardiovascular safety given 
the  effects  of  NB  on  blood  pressure.  The  Applicant  plans  to  evaluate the  utility  of  continuing    the 
ongoing NB-CVOT ("LIGHT" trial) after the second interim analysis early 2015.  
Furthermore, monitoring of the long term cardiovascular safety will continue to be assessed through 
the  planned  CVOT-2  trial  and  provide  more  information  regarding  the  CV  risk  in  a  higher  risk 
population compared with the NB-CVOT trial.   
The clinical implications of a low, but increased incidence of patients with a marked increase in serum 
creatinine in the NB group compared to placebo are unknown. However, the increases appear not to 
progress  over  time  and  are  probably  explained  by  bupropion  and  its  metabolites  competitively 
inhibiting the OCT2 in the basolateral membrane of the renal tubule. 
Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The magnitude of weight loss in overweight/obese patients in the range of what NB has accomplished 
in the clinical trials is considered marginally significant but clinically relevant. It is not known with 
certainty whether this will translate into benefits in terms of physical and mental health, although 
there is some support for the notion that even a modest weight loss maintained over a long period 
results in health benefits.  
The adverse events commonly associated with NB (primarily nausea, but also insomnia and anxiety) 
are  bothersome  for  patients,  but  they  are  easily  manageable:  patients  can  stop  taking  the 
medication. The relatively high frequency of such events will therefore affect adherence to treatment. 
Mysimba  
Assessment Report 
EMA/805547/2015 
Page 129/132 
  
 
 
However,  other  adverse  events  may  be  less  easily  manageable.  The  established  potential  of  NB 
(because of the bupropion component) to cause seizures is important- even if it is a rare event, as is 
the propensity of NB to cause cognitive deficits.  
The interim data available for the CVOT study provide further supportive data with regards to the CV 
safety profile in term of MACE events.  
Benefit-risk balance 
The  efficacy  of  NB  in  weight  management  is  limited,  but  when  viewing  the  results  of  the  primary 
endpoints as well as the secondary glycaemic and lipid-related endpoints in totality, it is considered to 
be clinically relevant.  
This benefit combined with no evidence of a significant increase in cardiovascular adverse events in 
the short- to intermediate-term and the apparent lack of potential to cause depression and suicidal 
behaviour  should  be  weighed  against  reasonably  manageable  tolerability  issues  (mainly 
gastrointestinal) and an important, but small increased risk of seizures.  
In  conclusion,  this  benefit  compared  with  safety  profile  is  adequately  addressed  in  the  indication 
highlighting the need to discontinue treatment after 16 weeks if patients have not lost at least 5% of 
their initial body weight. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
The  benefits  are  considered  to  outweigh  the  risks.  The  previous  major  reservations  about 
cardiovascular safety and about other safety and tolerability concerns in the context of the limited 
efficacy have been resolved to an extent that does not preclude licensing. They are also adequately 
addressed  in  the  post  marketing  setting.  Two  studies  will  investigate  cardiovascular  safety,  the 
ongoing CVOT1 and the planned CVOT2 which will address long term cardiovascular safety, included 
as a condition to the Marketing authorisation. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by majority that 
the risk-benefit balance of Mysimba is favourable as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and 
increased physical activity, for the management of weight in adult patients (≥18 years) with an initial 
Body Mass Index (BMI) of 
•  ≥ 30 kg/m2 (obese), or 
•  ≥ 27 kg/m2 to < 30 kg/m2 (overweight) in the presence of one or more weight-related 
co-morbidities (e.g., type 2 diabetes, dyslipidaemia, or controlled hypertension) 
Treatment with Mysimba should be discontinued after 16 weeks if patients have not lost at least 5% 
of their initial body weight (see Section 5.1) 
and therefore recommends  the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions:

DIVERGENT POSITION DATED 18 DECEMBER 2014 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  undersigned  member(s)  of  the  CHMP  did  not  agree  with  the  CHMP’s  positive  opinion 
recommending the granting of the marketing authorisation of Mysimba indicated “as an adjunct to a 
reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity, for the management of weight in adult patients 
with an initial Body Mass Index (BMI) of 
•  ≥ 30 kg/m² (obese), or 
•  ≥  27  kg/m²  to  <  30  kg/m² (overweight )  in  the  presence  of  one  or  more  weight-related 
co-morbidities (e.g., type 2 diabetes, dyslipidaemia, or controlled hypertension) 
Treatment with Mysimba should be discontinued after 16 weeks if patients have not lost at least 5% 
of their initial body weight. 
The overall benefit-risk balance for Mysimba in the claimed indication is considered negative due to: 
1)  A limited efficacy in weight management: 
The weight loss on Mysimba 32 mg/360 mg was modest as mean weight changes from baseline was 
less  than  10 %  in  all  studies,  and  the  difference  from  placebo  did  not  exceed  5 %  in  any  study 
(all-randomised set, Baseline Observation Carried Forward).  
Although the main findings in the pivotal studies were that treatment with Mysimba 32 mg/360 mg 
resulted in statistically significant weight loss compared with placebo in overweight/obese subjects 
with or without hypertension or dyslipidaemia, as well as in overweight/obese patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus, the weight loss is considered too modest especially considering the safety concerns. 
Furthermore,  there  are  uncertainties  regarding  the  maintenance  weight  loss  and/or  the  rebound 
effect after treatment discontinuation. 
Moreover,  the  efficacy  of  Mysimba  has  only  been  based  on  the  body  weight  loss  and  not  on  its 
potential morbidity and mortality benefits during the clinical trial program. 
2)  Safety concerns: 
-   Uncertainties  regarding  neuropsychiatric  risks:  considering  the  composition  of  Mysimba 
(particularly with bupropion), the risk of depression and suicide is not appropriately described by 
available data to date of the adoption. 
-   Uncertainties  regarding  cardiovascular  safety:  available  data  (interim  results  of  the  ongoing 
Cardiovascular Outcome Trial study) to date of the adoption are insufficient and a strong long 
term data evaluation is mandatory to rule out this risk. 
-   Poor  tolerability  which  might  lead  to  poor  adherence  to  treatment  (about  half  of  the  patients 
discontinued  prematurely):  the  relatively  high  frequency  of  such  adverse  events  should  affect 
adherence to treatment. 
Overall,  for  these  reasons,  we  consider  that  the  benefit/risk  ratio  is  negative  for  Mysimba  in  the 
management of obesity.

1.  Introduction 
On June 27, 2023 the MAH submitted a completed paediatric M&S study (CTRA-2022-1070 BLV Peds 
PopPK and PK/PD Sim) for Hepcludex, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, 
as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study CTRA-2022-1070 BLV Peds PopPK and PK/PD Sim - 2022 Population 
Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Analysis of Bulevirtide in Pediatric Patients Infected With 
Hepatitis is a stand-alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study<ies> 
Powder for solution for injection 
Simulations in paediatric patients was conducted using SC administration (same formulation as in 
adults).  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Bulevirtide (Hepcludex®) was conditionally approved in adults by the European Medicines Agency 
(EMA) in 2020. A conversion of the conditional marketing authorization to a full marketing 
authorization was granted on 18-JUL-2023 (EMEA/H/C/004854/II/0019). 
In general, HDV is a highly pathogenic virus causing acute and chronic liver disease. Bulevirtide is a 
myristoylated N-terminal and amidated C-terminal 47-amino acid lipopeptide, administered by a 
subcutaneous (SC) injection, which blocks the entry of HDV into hepatocytes by binding to an essential 
HDV entry receptor known as sodium-taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP). 
The initial agreed paediatric investigation plan (PIP), submitted by MYR, included 3 agreed measures, 
including a clinical study, a modeling and simulation (M&S) study, and an extrapolation study 
(EMEA-002399-PIP01-18).  
The Paediatric Committee (PDCO) agreed to a PIP modification (EMA/183400/2022) to remove the 
requirements for the clinical study, PIP Study 1: open-label, single arm, uncontrolled trial to evaluate 
safety, tolerability, acceptability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of bulevirtide in children 
from 3 to less than 18 years of age with chronic hepatitis D infection. 
The currently agreed measures in the BLV PIP includes an M&S study (Study 2) and an extrapolation 
study (Study 3) to evaluate the use of BLV in the treatment of chronic hepatitis D infection in children 
from 3 to less than 18 years of age. The PDCO agreed to a full extrapolation approach based on: 
• 
• 
disease progression and exposure similarity between adult and pediatric populations 
feasibility issues associated with obtaining pharmacokinetic (PK) and clinical data from pediatric 
patients (low prevalence of the disease in pediatric population; orphan drug)

• 
• 
available adult clinical data with BLV  
substantial available safety data 
•  well characterized mechanism of action. 
This submission consists of the provision of the M&S/extrapolation study report for BLV for the 
pediatric population (3 to less than 18 years of age).  
The MAH submitted the final report for:

Pharmacodynamic Analysis of Bulevirtide in Pediatric Patients Infected With Hepatitis D 
2.3.2.  Clinical M&S study 
CTRA-2022-1070 BLV Peds PopPK and PK/PD Sim - Population 
Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Analysis of Bulevirtide in Pediatric 
Patients Infected With Hepatitis D  
Overview of the provided M&S study for this P46 procedure is depicted in table 1. 
Methods 
An empirical PopPK model was initially developed to characterize BLV PK in adults following 
intravenous (IV) and SC administration using data from 6 studies. 
The adult PopPK model was updated in order to extrapolate to the paediatric population. Additionally, 
the PopPK dataset was simplified to facilitate extrapolation of the model to the paediatric population. 
The updated model incorporates a one-compartment model with a parallel nonlinear and linear 
clearance, time-varying apparent volume, fixed allometric scaling on clearance and volume based on 
baseline body weight (BWT), body mass index (BMI) dependence on absorption rate, and an effect of 
the population (patient versus healthy) on bioavailability, absorption, and volume. Nonlinear clearance,

likely attributed to saturation of NTCP receptors with increasing BLV exposures, was characterized with 
a Michaelis-Menten model. 
Results 
The updated adult PopPK and PK/PD models were used to estimate the steady-state exposures and 
corresponding bile acid levels in paediatric patients infected with HDV.

The extrapolated paediatric PK and bile acid results suggest that BLV 2 mg SC is the optimal or 
appropriate dose for paediatric patients aged ≥ 3 to < 18 years and weighing ≥ 9 kg, as it ensures that 
BLV AUCtau and bile acid levels are comparable with safe and efficacious levels established in adult 
patients.  
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The applicant has submitted the final popPK report for paediatric patients 3-17 years old and propose 
that 2 mg SC dose appropriate for patients ≥ 3 to < 18 years and weighing ≥ 9 kg.  
The applicant is planning to submit an application for BLV 2 mg SC for the treatment of chronic HDV 
infection in paediatric patients aged ≥ 3 to < 18 years of age. This is endorsed.  
The applicant will have to discuss and justify that the high exposure (figure 8) for the lowest body 
weight patients is safe in a future application. In addition, the simulated Ctrough levels are lower than 
in adults and this also needs to be justified with regards to efficacy in the future application. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The company is planning to submit an application for BLV 2 mg SC for the treatment of chronic HDV 
infection in paediatric patients aged ≥ 3 to < 18 years of age. This is endorsed. 
 The B/R in children ≥ 3 to < 18 years of age will be assessed in the future application.

1.  Executive Summary 
Nimenrix is a quadrivalent meningococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine composed of the capsular 
polysaccharides of Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y, each conjugated to tetanus 
toxoid.  
Nimenrix was authorised via the centralised procedure on 20th April 2012 for active immunisation of 
individuals from the age of 12 months and above against invasive meningococcal disease caused by 
Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y. A single dose is recommended in all age groups. 
The need for booster doses remains to be established but can be anticipated from the experience thus 
far with MenC conjugates. 
The MAH submitted the report for the paediatric study MenACWY-TT-019 EXT015 Year 4 in accordance 
with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006. A short critical expert overview was also provided. 
The MAH has stated that, in accordance with Article 16(2) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the data 
submitted do not influence the benefit-risk balance for Nimenrix. No urgent action is required 
regarding the SmPC. However, the MAH has planned to file a variation during 2013 in which data 
collected from a range of studies already submitted under Article 46 will be resubmitted to support 
changes to section 5.1 of the SmPC (i.e. to add antibody persistence data). 
2.  Recommendation 
No SmPC and PL changes are proposed. The assessor agrees that a single variation may be filed to add 
information derived from several antibody persistence studies. 
3.  Introduction 
MenACWY-TT-019 EXT015 Y4 represents the follow-up to Year 4 of subjects who were initially enrolled 
into the primary study MenACWY-TT-015.  
The primary phase study MenACWY-TT-015, as well as the follow-up studies after 1 and 2 years 
(MenACWY-TT-016 and 017 respectively) were submitted as part of the initial MAA for Nimenrix.  
The Year 3 follow-up data in study MenACWY-TT-018 were submitted under Article 46 in July 2012 (Art 
46 reference P46-008).  
Further follow-up of the subjects is planned up to 10 years after primary vaccination in MenACWY-TT-
015.

In the initial study 015 
The target sample size was 500 enrolled subjects who were randomised in a 3:1 ratio to the 
quadrivalent conjugate (N=375) and unconjugated (N=125) vaccines. Enrolment was stratified to 
ensure 300 subjects in the 11-17 years and 200 in the 18-55 years age stratum. The applicant 
concluded that this sample would provide power to meet the immunogenicity criterion of at least 90% 
and power to meet the safety criterion of at least 86%. The initial study was conducted in 2006-8 and 
planned to continue to Year 5.  
Of the 500 subjects enrolled and vaccinated 497 (372 and 125 per group) completed the initial study 
while 455 subjects (341 and 114) were included in the ATP-I cohort. The mean age at baseline was 
18.3 years (SD 8 years), 49.5% were female, 66% were 11 to 17 years of age and the population was 
predominantly of Asian - South East Asian heritage (87.3%). 
From study 015 the applicant concluded that non-inferiority of the conjugate vs. Mencevax was 
demonstrated for each of the four meningococcal groups based on 95% CI around the differences in 
vaccine response rates that were within -4%. A vaccine response was defined as: 
- For initially seronegative subjects, post vaccination rSBA titre ≥ 1:32 
- For initially seropositive subjects, a ≥4-fold increase in rSBA titre from pre to post vaccination. 
Response rates to each meningococcal group in the subsets seropositive at baseline were numerically 
higher with the conjugate vaccine. Similar analyses applied to the TVC also demonstrated that the non-
inferiority criterion was met with 95% CIs that were within -5.2% and a similar pattern of response 
rates as noted in the ATP cohort. 
The response rates by baseline serostatus showed that all 95% CI were within -3.5% in the younger 
stratum with the same pattern as for the total study cohort. In the older stratum the 95% were within 
-8% except for MenC (-12.6%) for which the response rate among the baseline seropositive subset 
was slightly higher for the control vaccine.    
At baseline the percentages of subjects with pre-vaccination rSBA titres ≥ 1:8 were high and ranged 
from 75.5% (MenW in ACWY-TT group) to 95.1% (MenA in ACWY-TT group). One month after 
vaccination, the percentages with titres ≥ 1:8 increased to at least 99.7% and percentages with ≥ 
1:128 increased to at least 98.2% with no statistically significant differences between the two 
vaccines. The rSBA GMT values increased at least 9-fold after vaccination. GMTs adjusted for pre-
vaccination measurements were statistically significantly higher in the ACWY-TT group. In addition, 
GMTs were statistically significantly higher in the conjugate vaccine group for MenA, W and Y in both 
age strata. For MenC the GMT was significantly higher in the conjugate vaccine group for those aged 
11 to 17 years and numerically higher for those aged 18 to 55 years. 
At one and two years after vaccination 473 and 458 subjects, respectively, were included in the ATP-I 
cohort.  
The GMTs had dropped in all vaccine and age sub-groups but were still above baseline and the great 
majority had titres ≥1:128 vs. each meningococcal group. At least numerical advantages in terms of 
GMTs were maintained for the ACWY-TT group except against MenC in subjects aged 18-55 years. In 
addition, with the exception of MenC (both vaccines) and MenW135 (control group), the GMTs were at 
least numerically higher in the younger age stratum. 
There was an additional analysis performed by the UK HPA using the HPA rSBA assay. Datasets 
generated for comparison were:

o  SELHPA: all subjects in with Y2 samples tested by HPA and for these subjects at earlier time 
points 
o  SELGSK: results from GSK’s rSBA for subjects with samples tested by HPA 
On comparing the GMTs and the percentages with titres at least 1:128 it was very clear that at all 
times the GSK assay gave higher values than the HPA assay but there was a particularly large 
difference in the pre-vaccination values and also for the anti-W and anti-Y values throughout the study 
up to Y2.  
For example, the percentages in the conjugate vaccine group deemed to be seronegative at baseline 
using the HPA assay for the four meningococcal groups ACWY were 93%, 90%, 97% and 71%, 
respectively. The corresponding percentages deemed to be seronegative at baseline using the GSK 
assay were 7%, 10%, 3% and 29%. Nevertheless, while post-vaccination titres were also higher using 
the GSK assay, the post-vaccination differences between groups considerably favoured the ACWY-TT 
vaccine using the HPA and GSK assays as shown below. The comparisons of GMTs showed the same 
pattern.

Of the 500 subjects initially enrolled into study 015 426 returned for this Year 4 persistence phase: 
317 primed with MenACWY-TT and 109 primed with Mencevax ACWY. Immunogenicity at Y4 was 
assessed for 420/426. 
Among the 74 subjects who did not return there were 50 lost to follow-up, 22 were not willing to 
participate due to a reason other than an AE or SAE and 2 died due to causes unrelated to vaccination 
since the Y3 visit.

The mean age of subjects included in the ATP cohort for persistence at Y4 was 22.1 years with other 
demographics as shown below.  
The median time elapsed since vaccination in study 015 was 210 weeks. 
The analysis was based on the ATP cohort for antibody persistence at Y4 as follows: 
- 
rSBA data were generated at all time points up to M36 (PRE, M1, M12, M24 and M36 post 
vaccination) at GSK laboratories for all subjects with sera available 
- 
rSBA data were generated at the UK Health Protection Agency (HPA) laboratories for a subset of 
the samples at all time points (as above) except for M36 
- 
At M48 rSBA testing was performed at HPA only and for all subjects with available sera 
As previously noted, the two rSBA assays (GSK vs. HPA) gave different results although the trends and 
overall conclusions drawn were compatible between the two sets of results. Due to the differences, the 
two sets of results have been presented in separate tables. As a result of the testing schema the 
antibody kinetics and decay from pre-vaccination and one month post-vaccination in 015 up to Y4 
(M48) cannot be directly assessed due to the change in assay. 
Based on the GSK assay results and testing sera up to Y3 (M36) the percentages with rSBA titres at 
least 1:128 remained >90% at M36 and the GMTs suggested a slowing of antibody decay between 
years 2 and 3 following the initial more rapid decline (see table below). The same pattern of 
observations applied to the ELISA results (IgG directed against capsular polysaccharides).

The HPA data are shown in the next table up to Y4. Note carefully that up to M24 only a small fraction 
of the Y4 cohort had previously had sera tested using this assay so the results at Y4 pertain to a much 
larger number and the interpretation of the pattern in titres and GMTs over time must be viewed with 
caution. Nevertheless, at Y4 after vaccination:

- 
For rSBA-MenA titres ≥ 1:8 were present in 86.5% in the ACWY-TT group and 73.8% in the 
MenPS group. 
For rSBA-MenC titres ≥ 1:8 were present in 88.5% in the ACWY-TT group and 84.1% in the 
MenPS group. 
For rSBA-MenW-135 titres ≥ 1:8 were present in 74.0% in the ACWY-TT group and 25.2% in the 
MenPS group. 
For rSBA-MenY titres ≥ 1:8 were present in 82.8% in the ACWY-TT group and 43.9% in the 
MenPS group.

The rSBA GMTs in the ACWY-TT group ranged from 175.1 (rSBA-MenW-135) to 350.5 (rSBAMenY). 
In the MenPS group rSBA, GMTs ranged from 11.3 (rSBA-MenW-135) to 315.0 (rSBAMenC). 
The exploratory group comparisons of the HPA data suggested that 4 years after vaccination: 
In the ACWY-TT group, the percentages of subjects with rSBA titres ≥ 1:8 and ≥ 1:128 were 
statistically significantly higher for MenA, MenW-135 and MenY serogroups.

In the ACWY-TT group, rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenW-135 and rSBA-MenY GMTs were statistically 
significantly higher compared to the MenPS group. 
The results using each assay have also been presented according to the two initial age strata. Since 
this report focuses on Y4 only the HPA data are shown below.

Page 8/11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As summarised in the tables below, at least numerically higher percentages within each age stratum in 
the conjugate vaccine group vs. unconjugated group still had titres at least 1:8 and at least 1:128 at 
Y4. The difference was especially marked for MenW and MenY. There was no consistent pattern 
between age strata in terms of higher or lower percentages with these titres at Y4 and they were 
mostly fairly comparable at this time point.

Similar observations applied to the comparisons of GMTs by age stratum and vaccine group, as shown 
below. 
In the Total Cohort at Year 4 no SAEs related to vaccination or any events related to the lack of 
vaccine efficacy had been reported in the period between 6 months post vaccination and the Year 4 
visit. 
Seventeen pregnancies had been reported since the Year 3 visit of which 16 had resulted in a normal 
delivery and one subject had eclampsia. All pregnancies had a normal outcome (live infants with no 
apparent congenital anomaly). Up to the report cut-off date one additional pregnancy had been 
reported with normal delivery and normal outcome (live healthy infant).

5.  Rapporteur’s Overall Conclusion and Recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
Based on the more conservative HPA rSBA data, and noting that there are no hSBA data available from 
this study for comparison, the Y4 data indicate that > 80% of subjects retained at least rSBA titres 1:8 
except for MenW135, for which the rates were 76% and 69% in the two age cohorts. 
The antibody persistence data should be added to the SmPC along with the data from the other 
studies, as already planned by the MAH. 
It is not possible to draw any conclusions regarding the need for booster doses from these data.  
Recommendation  
The data should be added to the SmPC as already planned by the MAH in a forthcoming variation 
procedure.

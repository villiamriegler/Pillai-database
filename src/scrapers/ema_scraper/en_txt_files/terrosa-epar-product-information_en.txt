PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Solution for injection (injection). 
Colourless, clear solution for injection with a pH of 3.8 – 4.5. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Terrosa is indicated in adults. 
Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and in men at increased risk of fracture (see 
section 5.1). In postmenopausal women, a significant reduction in the incidence of vertebral and 
non-vertebral fractures but not hip fractures has been demonstrated. 
Treatment of osteoporosis associated with sustained systemic glucocorticoid therapy in women and 
men at increased risk for fracture (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The recommended dose of Terrosa is 20 micrograms administered once daily. 
Patients should receive supplemental calcium and vitamin D supplements if dietary intake is 
inadequate. 
The maximum total duration of treatment with teriparatide should be 24 months (see section 4.4). The 
24-month course of teriparatide should not be repeated over a patient’s lifetime. 
Following cessation of teriparatide therapy, patients may be continued on other osteoporosis therapies. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment

Teriparatide must not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 4.3). In patients 
with moderate renal impairment, teriparatide should be used with caution. No special caution is 
required for patients with mild renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment 
No data are available in patients with impaired hepatic function (see section 5.3). Therefore, 
teriparatide should be used with caution. 
Paediatric population and young adults with open epiphyses 
The safety and efficacy of teriparatide in children and adolescents less than 18 years have not been 
established. Teriparatide should not be used in paediatric patients (less than 18 years), or young adults 
with open epiphyses. 
Elderly 
Dose adjustment based on age is not required (see section 5.2). 
Method of administration 
Terrosa should be administered once daily by subcutaneous injection in the thigh or abdomen. 
Patients must be trained to use the proper injection techniques. For instructions of the medicinal 
product, before administration, see section 6.6 and IFU at the end of the package leaflet. Instructions 
for use of Terrosa Pen, which are provided with the pen is also available to instruct patients on the 
correct use of the pen.

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). 
Pre-existing hypercalcaemia. 
Severe renal impairment. 
Metabolic bone diseases (including hyperparathyroidism and Paget’s disease of the bone) other 
than primary osteoporosis or glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. 
Unexplained elevations of alkaline phosphatase. 
Prior external beam or implant radiation therapy to the skeleton. 
Patients with skeletal malignancies or bone metastases should be excluded from treatment with 
teriparatide. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Serum and urine calcium 
In normocalcaemic patients, slight and transient elevations of serum calcium concentrations have been 
observed following teriparatide injection. Serum calcium concentrations reach a maximum between 4 
and 6 hours and return to baseline by 16 to 24 hours after each dose of teriparatide. Therefore, if blood 
samples for serum calcium measurements are taken, this should be done at least 16 hours after the 
most recent teriparatide injection. Routine calcium monitoring during therapy is not required. 
Teriparatide may cause small increases in urinary calcium excretion, but the incidence of 
hypercalciuria did not differ from that in the placebo-treated patients in clinical trials. 
Urolithiasis 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Teriparatide has not been studied in patients with active urolithiasis. Teriparatide should be used with 
caution in patients with active or recent urolithiasis because of the potential to exacerbate this 
condition. 
Orthostatic hypotension 
In short-term clinical studies with teriparatide, isolated episodes of transient orthostatic hypotension 
were observed. Typically, an event began within 4 hours of dosing and spontaneously resolved within 
a few minutes to a few hours. When transient orthostatic hypotension occurred, it happened within the 
first several doses, was relieved by placing subjects in a reclining position, and did not preclude 
continued treatment. 
Renal impairment 
Caution should be exercised in patients with moderate renal impairment. 
Younger adult population 
Experience in the younger adult population, including premenopausal women, is limited (see section 
5.1). Treatment should only be initiated if the benefit clearly outweighs risks in this population. 
Women of childbearing potential should use effective methods of contraception during use of 
teriparatide. If pregnancy occurs, teriparatide should be discontinued. 
Duration of treatment 
Studies in rats indicate an increased incidence of osteosarcoma with long-term administration of 
teriparatide (see section 5.3). Until further clinical data become available, the recommended treatment 
time of 24 months should not be exceeded. 
Excipient 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
“sodium-free”. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
In a study of 15 healthy subjects administered digoxin daily to steady state, a single teriparatide dose 
did not alter the cardiac effect of digoxin. However, sporadic case reports have suggested that 
hypercalcaemia may predispose patients to digitalis toxicity. Because teriparatide transiently increases 
serum calcium, teriparatide should be used with caution in patients taking digitalis. 
Teriparatide has been evaluated in pharmacodynamic interaction studies with hydrochlorothiazide. No 
clinically significant interactions were noted. 
Co-administration of raloxifene or hormone replacement therapy with teriparatide did not alter the 
effects of teriparatide on serum or urine calcium or on clinical adverse events. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential / Contraception in females 
Women of childbearing potential should use effective methods of contraception during use of 
teriparatide. If pregnancy occurs, Terrosa should be discontinued. 
Pregnancy 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Terrosa is contraindicated for use during pregnancy (see section 4.3). 
Breast-feeding 
Terrosa is contraindicated for use during breast-feeding. It is not known whether teriparatide is 
excreted in human milk. 
Fertility 
Studies in rabbits have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The effect of teriparatide on 
human foetal development has not been studied. The potential risk for humans is unknown. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Teriparatide has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Transient, 
orthostatic hypotension or dizziness was observed in some patients. These patients should refrain from 
driving or the use of machines until symptoms have subsided. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients treated with teriparatide are nausea, pain in 
limb, headache and dizziness. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Of patients in the teriparatide trials, 82.8% of the teriparatide patients and 84.5% of the placebo 
patients reported at least 1 adverse event. 
The adverse reactions associated with the use of teriparatide in osteoporosis clinical trials and 
post-marketing exposure are summarised in Table 1. 
The following convention has been used for the classification of the adverse reactions: very common 
(≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1 000 to <1/100), and rare (≥1/10 000 to

Description of selected adverse reactions 
In clinical trials the following reactions were reported at a ≥1% difference in frequency from placebo: 
vertigo, nausea, pain in limb, dizziness, depression, dyspnoea. 
Teriparatide increases serum uric acid concentrations. In clinical trials, 2.8% of teriparatide patients 
had serum uric acid concentrations above the upper limit of normal compared with 0.7% of placebo 
patients. However, the hyperuricaemia did not result in an increase in gout, arthralgia, or urolithiasis.

In a large clinical trial, antibodies that cross-reacted with teriparatide were detected in 2.8% of women 
receiving teriparatide. Generally, antibodies were first detected following 12 months of treatment and 
diminished after withdrawal of therapy. There was no evidence of hypersensitivity reactions, allergic 
reactions, effects on serum calcium, or effects on Bone Mineral Density (BMD) response. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Signs and symptoms 
Teriparatide has been administered in single doses of up to 100 micrograms and in repeated doses of 
up to 60 micrograms/day for 6 weeks. 
The effects of overdose that might be expected include delayed hypercalcaemia and risk of orthostatic 
hypotension. Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and headache can also occur. 
Overdose experience based on post-marketing spontaneous reports 
In post-marketing spontaneous reports, there have been cases of medication error where the entire 
contents (up to 800 micrograms) of a teriparatide pen have been administered as a single dose. 
Transient events reported have included nausea, weakness/lethargy and hypotension. In some cases, 
no adverse events occurred as a result of the overdose. No fatalities associated with overdose have 
been reported. 
Overdose management 
There is no specific antidote for teriparatide. Treatment of suspected overdose should include 
transitory discontinuation of teriparatide, monitoring of serum calcium, and implementation of 
appropriate supportive measures, such as hydration.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Calcium homeostasis, parathyroid hormones and analogues, ATC code: 
H05AA02 
Terrosa is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the 
European Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. 
Mechanism of action 
Endogenous 84-amino-acid parathyroid hormone (PTH) is the primary regulator of calcium and 
phosphate metabolism in bone and kidney. Teriparatide (rhPTH(1-34)) is the active fragment (1-34) of 
endogenous human parathyroid hormone. Physiological actions of PTH include stimulation of bone 
formation by direct effects on bone forming cells (osteoblasts) indirectly increasing the intestinal 
absorption of calcium and increasing the tubular re-absorption of calcium and excretion of phosphate 
by the kidney. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Teriparatide is a bone formation agent to treat osteoporosis. The skeletal effects of teriparatide depend 
upon the pattern of systemic exposure. Once-daily administration of teriparatide increases apposition 
of new bone on trabecular and cortical bone surfaces by preferential stimulation of osteoblastic 
activity over osteoclastic activity. 
Clinical efficacy 
Risk factors 
Independent risk factors, for example, low BMD, age, the existence of previous fracture, family 
history of hip fractures, high bone turnover and low body mass index should be considered in order to 
identify women and men at increased risk of osteoporotic fractures who could benefit from treatment. 
Premenopausal women with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis should be considered at high risk for 
fracture if they have a prevalent fracture or a combination of risk factors that place them at high risk 
for fracture (e.g., low bone density [e.g., T-score ≤−2], sustained high dose glucocorticoid therapy 
[e.g., ≥7.5 mg/day for at least 6 months], high underlying disease activity, low sex steroid levels). 
Postmenopausal osteoporosis 
The pivotal study included 1 637 postmenopausal women (mean age 69.5 years). At baseline, ninety 
percent of the patients had one or more vertebral fractures, and on average, vertebral BMD was 
0.82 g/cm2 (equivalent to a T-score = - 2.6). All patients were offered 1 000 mg calcium per day and at 
least 400 IU vitamin D per day. Results from up to 24 months (median: 19 months) treatment with 
teriparatide demonstrate statistically significant fracture reduction (Table 2). To prevent one or more 
new vertebral fractures, 11 women had to be treated for a median of 19 months.

c A significant reduction in the incidence of hip fractures has not been demonstrated. 
d p≤0.025 compared with placebo. 
After 19 months (median) treatment, BMD had increased in the lumbar spine and total hip, 
respectively, by 9% and 4% compared with placebo (p<0.001). 
Post-treatment management: Following treatment with teriparatide, 1 262 postmenopausal women 
from the pivotal trial enrolled in a post-treatment follow-up study. The primary objective of the study 
was to collect safety data of teriparatide. During this observational period, other osteoporosis 
treatments were allowed and additional assessment of vertebral fractures was performed. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During a median of 18 months following discontinuation of teriparatide, there was a 41% reduction 
(p=0.004) compared with placebo in the number of patients with a minimum of one new vertebral 
fracture. 
In an open-label study, 503 postmenopausal women with severe osteoporosis and a fragility fracture 
within the previous 3 years (83% had received previous osteoporosis therapy) were treated with 
teriparatide for up to 24 months. At 24 months, the mean increase from baseline in lumbar spine, total 
hip and femoral neck BMD was 10.5%, 2.6 % and 3.9% respectively. The mean increase in BMD 
from 18 to 24 months was 1.4%, 1.2%, and 1.6% at the lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck, 
respectively. 
A 24-month, randomised, double-blind, comparator-controlled Phase 4 study included 1 360 
postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis. 680 subjects were randomised to teriparatide 
and 680 subjects were randomised to oral risedronate 35 mg/week. At baseline, the women had a 
mean age of 72.1 years and a median of 2 prevalent vertebral fractures; 57.9% of patients had received 
previous bisphosphonate therapy and 18.8% took concomitant glucocorticoids during the study. 1 013 
(74.5%) patients completed the 24-month follow-up. The mean (median) cumulative dose of 
glucocorticoid was 474.3 (66.2) mg in the teriparatide arm and 898.0 (100.0) mg in the risedronate 
arm. The mean (median) vitamin D intake for the teriparatide arm was 1 433 IU/day (1 400 IU/day) 
and for the risedronate arm was 1 191 IU/day (900 IU/day). For those subjects who had baseline and 
follow-up spine radiographs, the incidence of new vertebral fractures was 28/516 (5.4%) in 
teriparatide- and 64/533 (12.0%) in risedronate-treated patients, relative risk (95% CI) = 0.44 (0.29-
0.68), p<0.0001. The cumulative incidence of pooled clinical fractures (clinical vertebral and 
non-vertebral fractures) was 4.8% in teriparatide and 9.8% in risedronate-treated patients, hazard ratio 
(95% CI) = 0.48 (0.32-0.74), p=0.0009. 
Male osteoporosis 
437 patients (mean age 58.7 years) were enrolled in a clinical trial for men with hypogonadal (defined 
as low morning free testosterone or an elevated FSH or LH) or idiopathic osteoporosis. Baseline spinal 
and femoral neck BMD mean T-scores were -2.2 and -2.1, respectively. At baseline, 35% of patients 
had a vertebral fracture and 59% had a non-vertebral fracture. 
All patients were offered 1 000 mg calcium per day and at least 400 IU vitamin D per day. Lumbar 
spine BMD significantly increased by 3 months. After 12 months, BMD had increased in the lumbar 
spine and total hip by 5% and 1%, respectively, compared with placebo. However, no significant 
effect on fracture rates was demonstrated. 
Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis 
The efficacy of teriparatide in men and women (N=428) receiving sustained systemic glucocorticoid 
therapy (equivalent to 5 mg or greater of prednisone for at least 3 months) was demonstrated in the 18-
month primary phase of a 36-month, randomised, double-blind, comparator-controlled study 
(alendronate 10 mg/day). Twenty-eight percent of patients had one or more radiographic vertebral 
fractures at baseline. All patients were offered 1 000 mg calcium per day and 800 IU vitamin D per 
day. 
This study included postmenopausal women (N=277), premenopausal women (N=67), and men 
(N=83). At baseline, the postmenopausal women had a mean age of 61 years, mean lumbar spine 
BMD T score of −2.7, median prednisone equivalent dose of 7.5 mg/day, and 34% had one or more 
radiographic vertebral fractures; premenopausal women had a mean age of 37 years, mean lumbar 
spine BMD T score of −2.5, median prednisone equivalent dose of 10 mg/day, and 9% had one or 
more radiographic vertebral fractures; and men had a mean age of 57 years, mean lumbar spine BMD 
T score of −2.2, median prednisone equivalent dose of 10 mg/day, and 24% had one or more 
radiographic vertebral fractures. 
Sixty-nine percent of patients completed the 18-month primary phase. At the 18-month endpoint, 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
teriparatide significantly increased lumbar spine BMD (7.2%) compared with alendronate (3.4%) 
(p<0.001). Teriparatide increased BMD at the total hip (3.6%) compared with alendronate (2.2%) 
(p<0.01), as well as at the femoral neck (3.7%) compared with alendronate (2.1%) (p<0.05). In 
patients treated with teriparatide, lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck BMD increased between 18 
and 24 months by an additional 1.7%, 0.9%, and 0.4%, respectively. 
At 36 months, analysis of spinal X-rays from 169 alendronate patients and 173 teriparatide patients 
showed that 13 patients in the alendronate group (7.7%) had experienced a new vertebral fracture 
compared with 3 patients in the teriparatide group (1.7%) (p=0.01). In addition, 15 of 214 patients in 
the alendronate group (7.0%) had experienced a non-vertebral fracture compared with 16 of 214 
patients in the teriparatide group (7.5%) (p=0.84). 
In premenopausal women, the increase in BMD from baseline to 18 month endpoint was significantly 
greater in the teriparatide group compared with the alendronate group at the lumbar spine (4.2% 
versus −1.9%; p<0.001) and total hip (3.8% versus 0.9%; p=0.005). However, no significant effect on 
fracture rates was demonstrated. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Distribution 
The volume of distribution is approximately 1.7 L/kg. The half-life of teriparatide is approximately 
1 hour when administered subcutaneously, which reflects the time required for absorption from the 
injection site. 
Biotransformation 
No metabolism or excretion studies have been performed with teriparatide but the peripheral 
metabolism of parathyroid hormone is believed to occur predominantly in liver and kidney. 
Elimination 
Teriparatide is eliminated through hepatic and extra-hepatic clearance (approximately 62 L/hr in 
women and 94 L/hr in men). 
Elderly 
No differences in teriparatide pharmacokinetics were detected with regard to age (range 31 to 
85 years). Dose adjustment based on age is not required. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Teriparatide was not genotoxic in a standard battery of tests. It produced no teratogenic effects in rats, 
mice or rabbits. There were no important effects observed in pregnant rats or mice administered 
teriparatide at daily doses of 30 to 1 000 micrograms/kg. However, foetal resorption and reduced litter 
size occurred in pregnant rabbits administered daily doses of 3 to 100 micrograms/kg. The 
embryotoxicity observed in rabbits may be related to their much greater sensitivity to the effects of 
PTH on blood ionised calcium compared with rodents. 
Rats treated with near-life time daily injections had dose-dependent exaggerated bone formation and 
increased incidence of osteosarcoma most probably due to an epigenetic mechanism. Teriparatide did 
not increase the incidence of any other type of neoplasia in rats. Due to the differences in bone 
physiology in rats and humans, the clinical relevance of these findings is probably minor. No bone 
tumours were observed in ovariectomised monkeys treated for 18 months or during a 3-year follow-up 
period after treatment cessation. In addition, no osteosarcomas have been observed in clinical trials or 
during the post treatment follow-up study. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Animal studies have shown that severely reduced hepatic blood flow decreases exposure of PTH to the 
principal cleavage system (Kupffer cells) and consequently clearance of PTH(1-84).

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Solution for injection (injection). 
Colourless, clear solution for injection with a pH of 3.8 – 4.5. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Terrosa is indicated in adults. 
Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and in men at increased risk of fracture (see 
section 5.1). In postmenopausal women, a significant reduction in the incidence of vertebral and 
non-vertebral fractures but not hip fractures has been demonstrated. 
Treatment of osteoporosis associated with sustained systemic glucocorticoid therapy in women and 
men at increased risk for fracture (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The recommended dose of Terrosa is 20 micrograms administered once daily. 
The maximum total duration of treatment with teriparatide should be 24 months (see section 4.4). The 
24-month course of teriparatide should not be repeated over a patient’s lifetime. 
Patients should receive supplemental calcium and vitamin D supplements if dietary intake is 
inadequate. 
Following cessation of teriparatide therapy, patients may be continued on other osteoporosis therapies. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
Teriparatide must not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 4.3). In patients 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with moderate renal impairment, teriparatide should be used with caution. No special caution is 
required for patients with mild renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment 
No data are available in patients with impaired hepatic function (see section 5.3). Therefore, 
teriparatide should be used with caution. 
Paediatric population and young adults with open epiphyses 
The safety and efficacy of teriparatide in children and adolescents less than 18 years have not been 
established. Teriparatide should not be used in paediatric patients (less than 18 years), or young adults 
with open epiphyses. 
Elderly 
Dose adjustment based on age is not required (see section 5.2). 
Method of administration 
Terrosa should be administered once daily by subcutaneous injection in the thigh or abdomen. 
Patients must be trained to use the proper injection techniques. For instructions of the medicinal 
product, before administration, see section 6.6 and Instructions for Use. The Instructions for Use, 
which is provided with this medicinal product is also available to instruct patients on the correct use of 
the pre-filled pen. 
4.3  Contraindications 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). 
Pre-existing hypercalcaemia. 
Severe renal impairment. 
Metabolic bone diseases (including hyperparathyroidism and Paget’s disease of the bone) other 
than primary osteoporosis or glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. 
Unexplained elevations of alkaline phosphatase. 
Prior external beam or implant radiation therapy to the skeleton. 
Patients with skeletal malignancies or bone metastases should be excluded from treatment with 
teriparatide. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Serum and urine calcium 
In normocalcaemic patients, slight and transient elevations of serum calcium concentrations have been 
observed following teriparatide injection. Serum calcium concentrations reach a maximum between 4 
and 6 hours and return to baseline by 16 to 24 hours after each dose of teriparatide. Therefore, if blood 
samples for serum calcium measurements are taken, this should be done at least 16 hours after the 
most recent teriparatide injection. Routine calcium monitoring during therapy is not required. 
Teriparatide may cause small increases in urinary calcium excretion, but the incidence of 
hypercalciuria did not differ from that in the placebo-treated patients in clinical trials. 
Urolithiasis 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Teriparatide has not been studied in patients with active urolithiasis. Teriparatide should be used with 
caution in patients with active or recent urolithiasis because of the potential to exacerbate this 
condition. 
Orthostatic hypotension 
In short-term clinical studies with teriparatide, isolated episodes of transient orthostatic hypotension 
were observed. Typically, an event began within 4 hours of dosing and spontaneously resolved within 
a few minutes to a few hours. When transient orthostatic hypotension occurred, it happened within the 
first several doses, was relieved by placing subjects in a reclining position, and did not preclude 
continued treatment. 
Renal impairment 
Caution should be exercised in patients with moderate renal impairment. 
Younger adult population 
Experience in the younger adult population, including premenopausal women, is limited (see section 
5.1). Treatment should only be initiated if the benefit clearly outweighs risks in this population. 
Women of childbearing potential should use effective methods of contraception during use of 
teriparatide. If pregnancy occurs, teriparatide should be discontinued. 
Duration of treatment 
Studies in rats indicate an increased incidence of osteosarcoma with long-term administration of 
teriparatide (see section 5.3). Until further clinical data become available, the recommended treatment 
time of 24 months should not be exceeded. 
Excipient 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
“sodium-free”. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
In a study of 15 healthy subjects administered digoxin daily to steady state, a single teriparatide dose 
did not alter the cardiac effect of digoxin. However, sporadic case reports have suggested that 
hypercalcaemia may predispose patients to digitalis toxicity. Because teriparatide transiently increases 
serum calcium, teriparatide should be used with caution in patients taking digitalis. 
Teriparatide has been evaluated in pharmacodynamic interaction studies with hydrochlorothiazide. No 
clinically significant interactions were noted. 
Co-administration of raloxifene or hormone replacement therapy with teriparatide did not alter the 
effects of teriparatide on serum or urine calcium or on clinical adverse events. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential / Contraception in females 
Women of childbearing potential should use effective methods of contraception during use of 
teriparatide. If pregnancy occurs, Terrosa should be discontinued. 
Pregnancy 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Terrosa is contraindicated for use during pregnancy (see section 4.3). 
Breast-feeding 
Terrosa is contraindicated for use during breast-feeding. It is not known whether teriparatide is 
excreted in human milk. 
Fertility 
Studies in rabbits have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The effect of teriparatide on 
human foetal development has not been studied. The potential risk for humans is unknown. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Teriparatide has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Transient, 
orthostatic hypotension or dizziness was observed in some patients. These patients should refrain from 
driving or the use of machines until symptoms have subsided. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients treated with teriparatide are nausea, pain in 
limb, headache and dizziness. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Of patients in the teriparatide trials, 82.8% of the teriparatide patients and 84.5% of the placebo 
patients reported at least 1 adverse event. 
The adverse reactions associated with the use of teriparatide in osteoporosis clinical trials and 
post-marketing exposure are summarised in Table 1. 
The following convention has been used for the classification of the adverse reactions: very common 
(≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100), and rare (≥ 1/10 000 to 
< 1/1 000).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
In clinical trials the following reactions were reported at a ≥1% difference in frequency from placebo: 
vertigo, nausea, pain in limb, dizziness, depression, dyspnoea. 
Teriparatide increases serum uric acid concentrations. In clinical trials, 2.8% of teriparatide patients 
had serum uric acid concentrations above the upper limit of normal compared with 0.7% of placebo 
patients. However, the hyperuricaemia did not result in an increase in gout, arthralgia, or urolithiasis. 
In a large clinical trial, antibodies that cross-reacted with teriparatide were detected in 2.8% of women 
receiving teriparatide. Generally, antibodies were first detected following 12 months of treatment and 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
diminished after withdrawal of therapy. There was no evidence of hypersensitivity reactions, allergic 
reactions, effects on serum calcium, or effects on Bone Mineral Density (BMD) response. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Signs and symptoms 
Teriparatide has been administered in single doses of up to 100 micrograms and in repeated doses of 
up to 60 micrograms/day for 6 weeks. 
The effects of overdose that might be expected include delayed hypercalcaemia and risk of orthostatic 
hypotension. Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and headache can also occur. 
Overdose experience based on post-marketing spontaneous reports 
In post-marketing spontaneous reports, there have been cases of medication error where the entire 
contents (up to 800 micrograms) of a teriparatide pen have been administered as a single dose. 
Transient events reported have included nausea, weakness/lethargy and hypotension. In some cases, 
no adverse events occurred as a result of the overdose. No fatalities associated with overdose have 
been reported. 
Overdose management 
There is no specific antidote for teriparatide. Treatment of suspected overdose should include 
transitory discontinuation of teriparatide, monitoring of serum calcium, and implementation of 
appropriate supportive measures, such as hydration.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Calcium homeostasis, parathyroid hormones and analogues, ATC code: 
H05AA02 
Terrosa is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the 
European Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. 
Mechanism of action 
Endogenous 84-amino-acid parathyroid hormone (PTH) is the primary regulator of calcium and 
phosphate metabolism in bone and kidney. Teriparatide (rhPTH(1-34)) is the active fragment (1-34) of 
endogenous human parathyroid hormone. Physiological actions of PTH include stimulation of bone 
formation by direct effects on bone forming cells (osteoblasts) indirectly increasing the intestinal 
absorption of calcium and increasing the tubular re-absorption of calcium and excretion of phosphate 
by the kidney. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Teriparatide is a bone formation agent to treat osteoporosis. The skeletal effects of teriparatide depend 
upon the pattern of systemic exposure. Once-daily administration of teriparatide increases apposition 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of new bone on trabecular and cortical bone surfaces by preferential stimulation of osteoblastic 
activity over osteoclastic activity. 
Clinical efficacy 
Risk factors 
Independent risk factors, for example, low BMD, age, the existence of previous fracture, family 
history of hip fractures, high bone turnover and low body mass index should be considered in order to 
identify women and men at increased risk of osteoporotic fractures who could benefit from treatment. 
Premenopausal women with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis should be considered at high risk for 
fracture if they have a prevalent fracture or a combination of risk factors that place them at high risk 
for fracture (e.g., low bone density [e.g., T-score≤−2], sustained high dose glucocorticoid therapy 
[e.g., ≥7.5 mg/day for at least 6 months], high underlying disease activity, low sex steroid levels). 
Postmenopausal osteoporosis 
The pivotal study included 1 637 postmenopausal women (mean age 69.5 years). At baseline, ninety 
percent of the patients had one or more vertebral fractures, and on average, vertebral BMD was 
0.82 g/cm2 (equivalent to a T-score = -2.6). All patients were offered 1 000 mg calcium per day and at 
least 400 IU vitamin D per day. Results from up to 24 months (median: 19 months) treatment with 
teriparatide demonstrate statistically significant fracture reduction (Table 2). To prevent one or more 
new vertebral fractures, 11 women had to be treated for a median of 19 months.

After 19 months (median) treatment, BMD had increased in the lumbar spine and total hip, 
respectively, by 9% and 4% compared with placebo (p< 0.001). 
Post-treatment management: Following treatment with teriparatide, 1 262 postmenopausal women 
from the pivotal trial enrolled in a post-treatment follow-up study. The primary objective of the study 
was to collect safety data of teriparatide. During this observational period, other osteoporosis 
treatments were allowed and additional assessment of vertebral fractures was performed. 
During a median of 18 months following discontinuation of teriparatide, there was a 41% reduction 
(p = 0.004) compared with placebo in the number of patients with a minimum of one new vertebral 
fracture. 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In an open-label study, 503 postmenopausal women with severe osteoporosis and a fragility fracture 
within the previous 3 years (83% had received previous osteoporosis therapy) were treated with 
teriparatide for up to 24 months. At 24 months, the mean increase from baseline in lumbar spine, total 
hip and femoral neck BMD was 10.5%, 2.6 % and 3.9%, respectively. The mean increase in BMD 
from 18 to 24 months was 1.4%, 1.2%, and 1.6% at the lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck, 
respectively. 
A 24-month, randomised, double-blind, comparator-controlled Phase 4 study included 1 360 
postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis. 680 subjects were randomised to teriparatide 
and 680 subjects were randomised to oral risedronate 35 mg/week. At baseline, the women had a 
mean age of 72.1 years and a median of 2 prevalent vertebral fractures; 57.9% of patients had received 
previous bisphosphonate therapy and 18.8% took concomitant glucocorticoids during the study. 1 013 
(74.5%) patients completed the 24-month follow-up. The mean (median) cumulative dose of 
glucocorticoid was 474.3 (66.2) mg in the teriparatide arm and 898.0 (100.0) mg in the risedronate 
arm. The mean (median) vitamin D intake for the teriparatide arm was 1 433 IU/day (1 400 IU/day) 
and for the risedronate arm was 1 191 IU/day (900 IU/day). For those subjects who had baseline and 
follow-up spine radiographs, the incidence of new vertebral fractures was 28/516 (5.4%) in 
teriparatide- and 64/533 (12.0%) in risedronate-treated patients, relative risk (95% CI) = 0.44 (0.29-
0.68), p< 0.0001. The cumulative incidence of pooled clinical fractures (clinical vertebral and 
non-vertebral fractures) was 4.8% in teriparatide and 9.8% in risedronate-treated patients, hazard ratio 
(95% CI) = 0.48 (0.32-0.74), p = 0.0009. 
Male osteoporosis 
437 patients (mean age 58.7 years) were enrolled in a clinical trial for men with hypogonadal (defined 
as low morning free testosterone or an elevated FSH or LH) or idiopathic osteoporosis. Baseline spinal 
and femoral neck BMD mean T-scores were -2.2 and -2.1, respectively. At baseline, 35% of patients 
had a vertebral fracture and 59% had a non-vertebral fracture. 
All patients were offered 1 000 mg calcium per day and at least 400 IU vitamin D per day. Lumbar 
spine BMD significantly increased by 3 months. After 12 months, BMD had increased in the lumbar 
spine and total hip by 5% and 1%, respectively, compared with placebo. However, no significant 
effect on fracture rates was demonstrated. 
Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis 
The efficacy of teriparatide in men and women (N = 428) receiving sustained systemic glucocorticoid 
therapy (equivalent to 5 mg or greater of prednisone for at least 3 months) was demonstrated in the 18-
month primary phase of a 36-month, randomised, double-blind, comparator-controlled study 
(alendronate 10 mg/day). Twenty-eight percent of patients had one or more radiographic vertebral 
fractures at baseline. All patients were offered 1 000 mg calcium per day and 800 IU vitamin D per 
day. 
This study included postmenopausal women (N = 277), premenopausal women (N = 67), and men 
(N = 83). At baseline, the postmenopausal women had a mean age of 61 years, mean lumbar spine 
BMD T-score of −2.7, median prednisone equivalent dose of 7.5 mg/day, and 34% had one or more 
radiographic vertebral fractures; premenopausal women had a mean age of 37 years, mean lumbar 
spine BMD T-score of −2.5, median prednisone equivalent dose of 10 mg/day, and 9% had one or 
more radiographic vertebral fractures; and men had a mean age of 57 years, mean lumbar spine BMD 
T-score of −2.2, median prednisone equivalent dose of 10 mg/day, and 24% had one or more 
radiographic vertebral fractures. 
Sixty-nine percent of patients completed the 18-month primary phase. At the 18-month endpoint, 
teriparatide significantly increased lumbar spine BMD (7.2%) compared with alendronate (3.4%) (p< 
0.001). Teriparatide increased BMD at the total hip (3.6%) compared with alendronate (2.2%) 
(p< 0.01), as well as at the femoral neck (3.7%) compared with alendronate (2.1%) (p< 0.05). In 
patients treated with teriparatide, lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck BMD increased between 18 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and 24 months by an additional 1.7%, 0.9%, and 0.4%, respectively. 
At 36 months, analysis of spinal X-rays from 169 alendronate patients and 173 teriparatide patients 
showed that 13 patients in the alendronate group (7.7%) had experienced a new vertebral fracture 
compared with 3 patients in the teriparatide group (1.7%) (p = 0.01). In addition, 15 of 214 patients in 
the alendronate group (7.0%) had experienced a non-vertebral fracture compared with 16 of 214 
patients in the teriparatide group (7.5%) (p = 0.84). 
In premenopausal women, the increase in BMD from baseline to 18 month endpoint was significantly 
greater in the teriparatide group compared with the alendronate group at the lumbar spine (4.2% 
versus −1.9%; p< 0.001) and total hip (3.8% versus 0.9%; p = 0.005). However, no significant effect 
on fracture rates was demonstrated. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Distribution 
The volume of distribution is approximately 1.7 L/kg. The half-life of teriparatide is approximately 
1 hour when administered subcutaneously, which reflects the time required for absorption from the 
injection site. 
Biotransformation 
No metabolism or excretion studies have been performed with teriparatide but the peripheral 
metabolism of parathyroid hormone is believed to occur predominantly in liver and kidney. 
Elimination 
Teriparatide is eliminated through hepatic and extra-hepatic clearance (approximately 62 L/hr in 
women and 94 L/hr in men). 
Elderly 
No differences in teriparatide pharmacokinetics were detected with regard to age (range 31 to 
85 years). Dose adjustment based on age is not required. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Teriparatide was not genotoxic in a standard battery of tests. It produced no teratogenic effects in rats, 
mice or rabbits. There were no important effects observed in pregnant rats or mice administered 
teriparatide at daily doses of 30 to 1 000 micrograms/kg. However, foetal resorption and reduced litter 
size occurred in pregnant rabbits administered daily doses of 3 to 100 micrograms/kg. The 
embryotoxicity observed in rabbits may be related to their much greater sensitivity to the effects of 
PTH on blood ionised calcium compared with rodents. 
Rats treated with near-life time daily injections had dose-dependent exaggerated bone formation and 
increased incidence of osteosarcoma most probably due to an epigenetic mechanism. Teriparatide did 
not increase the incidence of any other type of neoplasia in rats. Due to the differences in bone 
physiology in rats and humans, the clinical relevance of these findings is probably minor. No bone 
tumours were observed in ovariectomised monkeys treated for 18 months or during a 3-year follow-up 
period after treatment cessation. In addition, no osteosarcomas have been observed in clinical trials or 
during the post-treatment follow-up study. 
Animal studies have shown that severely reduced hepatic blood flow decreases exposure of PTH to the 
principal cleavage system (Kupffer cells) and consequently clearance of PTH(1-84).

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Terrosa is and what it is used for 
Terrosa contains the active substance teriparatide that is used to make the bones stronger, and to 
reduce the risk of fractures by stimulating bone formation. 
Terrosa is used to treat osteoporosis in adults. Osteoporosis is a disease that causes your bones to 
become thin and fragile. This disease is especially common in women after the menopause, but it can 
also occur in men. Osteoporosis is also common in patients receiving medicines called corticosteroids. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Terrosa 
Do not use Terrosa 
• 
if you are allergic to teriparatide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you have high levels of calcium in your blood (pre-existing hypercalcaemia). 
if you suffer from serious kidney problems. 
if you have ever had bone cancer or if other cancers have spread (metastasised) to your bones. 
if you have certain bone diseases. If you have a bone disease, tell your doctor. 
if you have unexplained high levels of alkaline phosphatase in your blood, which means you 
might have Paget’s disease of bone (disease with abnormal bone changes). If you are not sure, 
ask your doctor. 
if you have had radiation therapy involving your bones. 
if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. 
Warnings and precautions 
Terrosa may increase calcium in your blood or urine. 
Talk to your doctor before or while using Terrosa: 
• 
if you have continuing nausea, vomiting, constipation, low energy, or muscle weakness. These 
may be signs there is too much calcium in your blood. 
if you suffer from kidney stones or have had kidney stones. 
if you suffer from kidney problems (moderate renal impairment).

Some patients get dizzy or get a fast heartbeat after the first few doses of Terrosa. For the first doses, 
inject Terrosa in a place where you can sit or lie down right away if you get dizzy. 
The recommended treatment time of 24 months should not be exceeded. 
Before inserting a cartridge in Terrosa Pen write down the batch (Lot) number of the cartridge and its 
first injection date on the outer carton of the cartridge and provide this information when reporting any 
side effects.  
Terrosa should not be used in growing adults. 
Children and adolescents 
Terrosa should not be used in children and adolescents (aged less than 18 years). 
Other medicines and Terrosa 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
This is important, because some medicines (e.g. digoxin/digitalis, a medicine used to treat heart 
disease) may interact with teriparatide. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not use Terrosa if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. If you are a woman of child-bearing 
potential, you should use effective methods of contraception during use of Terrosa. If you become 
pregnant while using Terrosa, Terrosa should be discontinued. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for 
advice before taking this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
Some patients may feel dizzy after injecting Terrosa. If you feel dizzy you should not drive or use 
machines until you feel better. 
Terrosa contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially “sodium-
free”. 
3.  How to use Terrosa 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure. 
The recommended dose is 20 micrograms (corresponding to 80 microliters) given once a day by 
injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) in the thigh or abdomen. 
To help you remember to use your medicine, inject it at about the same time each day. Terrosa can be 
injected at meal times. Inject Terrosa each day for as long as your doctor prescribes it for you. The 
total duration of treatment with Terrosa should not exceed 24 months. You should not receive more 
than one treatment course of 24 months over your lifetime. 
Your doctor may advise you to use Terrosa with calcium and vitamin D. Your doctor will tell you how 
much you should take each day. 
Terrosa can be given with or without food. 
Terrosa cartridges are designed to be used only with the Terrosa Pen reusable, multidose medicine 
delivery system and compatible pen needles. The pen and injection needles are not included with 
Terrosa. However, for treatment initiation a cartridge and pen pack should be used containing one 
inner carton of Terrosa cartridge and one inner carton of Terrosa Pen. 
The pen can be used with injection needles developed according to the pen needle ISO standard of a 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
gauge between 29 G and 31 G (diameter 0.25 – 0.33 mm) and a length between 5 mm to 12.7 mm for 
subcutaneous injection only. 
Before the first use, insert the cartridge into the pen. For the correct use of this medicine it is very 
important to closely follow the detailed Instructions for Use of your pen which are provided with the 
pen. 
Use a new injection needle for each injection to prevent contamination and safely dispose of the 
needle after use. 
Never store your pen with the needle attached. 
Never share your pen with others. 
Do not use your Terrosa Pen to inject any other medicine (e.g. insulin). 
The pen is customised for use with Terrosa only. 
Do not refill the cartridge. 
Do not transfer the medicine into a syringe. 
You should inject Terrosa shortly after you take the pen with inserted cartridge out of the refrigerator. 
Put the pen with inserted cartridge back into the refrigerator immediately after you have used it. Do 
not remove the cartridge from the pen after each use. Store it in the cartridge holder during the whole 
28-day treatment period. 
Preparing the pen for use 
- 
To ensure the correct administration of Terrosa always read the Instructions for Use of Terrosa 
Pen, which is included in the carton of the pen. 
Wash your hands before handling the cartridge or pen. 
Check the expiry date on the cartridge label before inserting the cartridge into the pen. Make 
sure that there are at least 28 days remaining before its expiry date. Insert the cartridge into the 
pen before the first use as detailed in the pen instructions. Write down the batch (Lot) number of 
each cartridge and its first injection date on a calendar. The date of first injection should also be 
recorded on the outer carton of Terrosa (see the provided space on the box: {First use:}). 
After inserting a new cartridge and before the first injection from this cartridge prime the pen 
according to the instructions which are provided. Do not prime again after the first dose. 
Injecting Terrosa 
- 
Before you inject Terrosa, clean your skin where you intend to inject (thigh or abdomen) as 
instructed by your doctor. 
Gently hold a fold of cleansed skin and insert the needle straight into the skin. Press the push 
button and hold it pressed in until the dose indication has returned to the start position. 
After your injection, leave the needle in the skin for six seconds to make sure that you receive 
the whole dose. 
As soon as you have finished the injection, attach the outer needle protective cap on the pen 
needle and screw the cap anti-clockwise to remove the pen needle. This will keep the remaining 
Terrosa sterile and prevent leaking from the pen. It will also stop air going back into the 
cartridge and the needle from clogging. 
Replace the cap on your pen. Leave the cartridge in the pen.

Instructions for use  
Terrosa Pen 
Re-usable pen injector to be used with Terrosa cartridges for subcutaneous injections 
Always follow instructions provided below and on the back page when using the Terrosa Pen. 
Terrosa Pen parts 
push button; display window; threaded rod; flange; Terrosa cartridge; peel foil; pen needle; inner 
needle cap; outer needle cap; pen cap; cartridge holder, dosage knob, housing 
Pen preparation - First use/changing cartridges 
Write down the first injection date of each new cartridge. This helps you to know when the 28 daily 
doses per cartridge are used (see section 2 “Warnings and precautions” and section 3 “Preparing the 
pen for use” in the Package leaflet of Terrosa). 
Follow the instructions every time you insert a new Terrosa cartridge into your Terrosa Pen. Do not 
repeat this before each daily injection, otherwise you will not have enough Terrosa for 28 days. 
Read the patient information leaflet for Terrosa cartridge provided separately. 
A: Remove the pen cap. 
B: Remove the cartridge holder by turning it (bayonet coupling).  
51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
C: Remove the empty cartridge, in the case of changing cartridge. Insert a new Terrosa cartridge into 
the cartridge holder, with the metal crimped cap of the cartridge first. 
D: Push back the threaded rod carefully with your finger, in a straight line and as far as it will go. This 
is not necessary when the rod is already in the starting position, such as at the very first use. The 
threaded rod cannot be pushed back to the pen housing entirely. 
E: Attach the cartridge holder to the housing by turning it 90 degrees, until it stops. 
F: Attach a new pen needle as follows:  
• Pull off the peel foil. 
• Screw the pen needle clockwise onto the cartridge holder. Make sure that the pen needle is attached 
52 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
correctly and sits firmly on the cartridge holder. 
• Remove the outer needle cap and save it. 
• Remove and dispose the inner needle cap. 
While attaching the needle some drops may escape, this is normal. 
G: Priming 
The pen must be primed and tested after inserting a new cartridge and prior the first injection from 
each cartridge. 
• Turn the dose knob clockwise until you see a droplet sign on the dose display. Make sure that the 
two indicator stripes are aligned. During dose dialling the pen provides an audible clicking sound and 
a noticeable resistance. 
• Hold the pen with the needle pointing upwards. 
• Press the push button fully in. Hold it pressed in until the dose indication has turned back to the start 
position. Some drops of medicine must be expelled from the needle tip. 
If no drops emerge, repeat step G until you see some drops. Do not repeat step G more than four times, 
but follow the instructions given under Troubleshooting section on the back page.  
53 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Administration using the Terrosa Pen 
Wash your hands carefully with soap to minimise the risk of infection. 
Make sure you have ready: 
• your Terrosa Pen with inserted cartridge 
• a compatible pen needle 
• a puncture-resistant sharps disposal container for used needles. 
Do not use the pen if the cartridge is cloudy, discoloured or contains particles. 
Read the patient information leaflet for Terrosa cartridge provided separately. 
1. Attach the pen needle 
Use a new needle for every injection. Do not use the pen needle if the packaging is damaged or not 
opened by yourself. 
Note: There is no need to change the needle when using directly after the pen preparation. In this case 
continue with step “2. Setting the dose and injection”. 
• Pull off the peel foil. 
• Screw the pen needle clockwise onto the cartridge holder. Make sure that the pen needle is attached 
correctly and sits firmly on the cartridge holder. 
• Remove the outer needle cap and save it. 
• Remove and dispose the inner needle cap. 
54 
 
 
 
 
 
While attaching the needle some drops may escape, this is normal. 
2. Setting the dose and injection 
Warning: Ensure the use of the correct medicine. Check the label of the cartridge before its insertion 
into the cartridge holder. 
• To set the fixed daily dose of 80 microliters, turn the dose knob clockwise until it stops and cannot 
be rotated any further. Make sure the display shows an arrow sign and it is aligned with the indicator 
stripe. During dose dialling the pen provides an audible clicking sound and a noticeable resistance. Do 
not try to force the dose knob any further. 
Note: If the cartridge contains less than 80 microliters, the dose knob cannot be turned clockwise up to 
the arrow sign. In this case, remove the pen needle, change the cartridge and proceed with priming 
according the pen preparation steps. 
• Select an appropriate injection site and prepare your skin as recommended by your doctor. Gently 
hold a skin fold between the thumb and index finger. Insert the needle straight and gently into the skin, 
as shown in the illustration. 
Warning: Prevent the pen needle from bending or breaking. Do not tilt the pen after the needle has 
been inserted into the skin. Tilting the pen may result in bending or breaking of the needle. Broken 
needles can get stuck in the skin. Immediately consult the doctor if a broken needle gets stuck in the 
skin. 
• Press the push button until the dose indication has returned to the start position. Keep the needle in 
the skin fold for a further 6 seconds. 
55 
 
 
 
 
 
• Pull out the pen slowly. Check if the display is at the start position to make sure that the full dose has 
been injected. 
3. Removing the pen needle 
• Carefully attach the outer needle cap on the pen needle. 
• Screw the needle cap anti-clockwise to remove the pen needle. Dispose of it correctly, for example, 
in a puncture-resistant sharps disposal container. 
4. Re-attach pen cap 
• Do not remove the cartridge from the Terrosa Pen before it is empty. 
• Re-attach the pen cap after each use. 
• Put the Terrosa Pen, with the cartridge inserted, back into the refrigerator between 2 and 8 °C 
56 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
immediately after use.

1. 
What Terrosa is and what it is used for 
Terrosa contains the active substance teriparatide that is used to make the bones stronger, and to 
reduce the risk of fractures by stimulating bone formation. 
Terrosa is used to treat osteoporosis in adults. Osteoporosis is a disease that causes your bones to 
become thin and fragile. This disease is especially common in women after the menopause, but it can 
also occur in men. Osteoporosis is also common in patients receiving medicines called corticosteroids. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Terrosa

• 
if you are allergic to teriparatide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you have high levels of calcium in your blood (pre-existing hypercalcaemia). 
if you suffer from serious kidney problems. 
if you have ever had bone cancer or if other cancers have spread (metastasised) to your bones. 
if you have certain bone diseases. If you have a bone disease, tell your doctor. 
if you have unexplained high levels of alkaline phosphatase in your blood, which means you 
might have Paget’s disease of bone (disease with abnormal bone changes). If you are not sure, 
ask your doctor. 
if you have had radiation therapy involving your bones. 
if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. 
Warnings and precautions

Other medicines and Terrosa 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
This is important, because some medicines (e.g. digoxin/digitalis, a medicine used to treat heart 
disease) may interact with teriparatide. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not use Terrosa if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. If you are a woman of child-bearing 
potential, you should use effective methods of contraception during use of Terrosa. If you become 
pregnant while using Terrosa, Terrosa should be discontinued. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for 
advice before taking this medicine.

Some patients may feel dizzy after injecting Terrosa. If you feel dizzy you should not drive or use 
machines until you feel better.

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially “sodium-
free”. 
3.  How to use Terrosa 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure. 
The recommended dose is 20 micrograms (corresponding to 80 microliters) given once a day by 
injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) in the thigh or abdomen. 
To help you remember to use your medicine, inject it at about the same time each day. Terrosa can be

standard of a gauge between 29 G and 31 G (diameter 0.25 – 0.33 mm) and a length between 5 mm to 
12.7 mm for subcutaneous injection only. 
For the correct use of this medicine it is very important to closely follow the detailed Instructions for 
Use of your pre-filled pen which are provided with the medicine.

in refrigerator before and during the whole 28-day treatment period. 
Preparing for injection 
- 
To ensure the correct administration of Terrosa always read the Instructions for Use of pre-filled 
Terrosa Pen, which is included in the carton of the medicine. 
Wash your hands before handling the pre-filled pen. 
Check the expiry date on the label of the pre-filled pen before you start using the medicine. 
Make sure that there are at least 28 days remaining before its expiry date. Write down the batch 
(Lot) number and the first injection date of the actual pre-filled pen on a calendar. The date of 
first injection should also be recorded on the outer carton of Terrosa (see the provided space on 
the box: {First use:}). 
Attach a new injection needle on the pre-filled pen and set the dose on the display window by 
turning the dose setting knob. 
Injecting Terrosa 
- 
Before you inject Terrosa, clean your skin where you intend to inject (thigh or abdomen) as 
instructed by your doctor. 
Gently hold a fold of cleansed skin and insert the needle straight into the skin. Press the dose 
setting knob and hold it pressed for at least six seconds to make sure that you receive the whole 
dose. 
As soon as you have finished the injection, attach the outer needle protective cap on the pen 
needle and screw the cap anti-clockwise to remove the pen needle. This will keep the remaining 
Terrosa sterile and prevent leaking from the pre-filled pen. It will also stop air going back into 
the pre-filled pen and the needle from clogging. 
Replace the cap on your pre-filled pen.  
Dispose of pen needles safely using a sharps container or as advised by your doctor.

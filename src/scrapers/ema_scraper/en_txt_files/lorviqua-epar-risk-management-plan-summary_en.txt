Summary of the risk management plan for Lorviqua (lorlatinib) 
This is a summary of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for Lorviqua. The RMP details 
important risks of Lorviqua, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will 
be obtained about Lorviqua’s risks and uncertainties (missing information).  
Lorviqua’s proposed Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential information to Healthcare Professionals (HCPs) and patients on how Lorviqua should 
be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Lorviqua should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Lorviqua's 
RMP. 
I. The Medicine and What it is Used for 
Lorviqua is indicated for adult patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) positive 
advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have not previously been treated with an 
ALK inhibitor. 
Lorviqua as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with anaplastic 
lymphoma kinase (ALK) positive advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease 
has progressed after: 
• 
• 
alectinib or ceritinib as the first ALK tyrosine kinase   inhibitor (TKI) therapy; or 
crizotinib and at least one other ALK TKI 
Lorviqua is administered orally once a day and is available as film-coated tablets of 25 mg and 
100 mg.  
Further information about the evaluation of Lorviqua’s benefits can be found in Lorviqua’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s webpage (https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/lorviqua). 
II. Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further Characterise 
the Risks 
Important risks of Lorviqua, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Lorviqua’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and HCPs; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute 
routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Lorviqua is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A. List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of Lorviqua are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Lorviqua.  Potential risks are concerns for which 
an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation.  Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine);

Table 2.  Summary of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important Identified Risk: CNS Effects 
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine: 
Lorviqua non-clinical and clinical studies 
The relationship between Lorviqua administration and CNS effects has been demonstrated 
in non-clinical and clinical studies. Temporary discontinuation and dose reduction have 
been successful in the management of CNS effects. 
There are no known risk factors or risk groups for CNS effects following the 
administration of Lorviqua

Important Identified Risk: ILD/pneumonitis  
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine: 
Lorviqua non-clinical and clinical studies 
ILD/pneumonitis is a known effect of other ALK/ROS1 inhibitors. However, the 
relationship between Lorviqua administration and ILD/pneumonitis is not yet established. 
ILD/pneumonitis can progress to pulmonary fibrosis and other life threatening pulmonary 
conditions 
Risk factors for ILD/pneumonitis include chemotherapy, antibiotics, anti-arrhythmics, and 
statins. Other contributing factors that may be associated with ILD/pneumonitis include 
environmental exposures to inhaled asbestos and silicone, infections, and connective tissue 
disease.

Important Potential Risk: AV block 
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine: 
Risk factors and 
risk groups: 
Lorviqua non-clinical and clinical studies  
The relationship between Lorviqua administration and AV block is not yet established. PR 
interval increase may become symptomatic AV block and in certain cases require 
placement of pacemaker. If untreated, complete AV block may lead to life threatening or 
fatal consequences. 
Risk factors for AV block include idiopathic fibrosis and sclerosis of the conduction 
system, ischemic heart disease, drugs (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, 
digoxin, amiodarone), increased vagal tone, valvulopathy, prior myocardial infarction, 
valvular abnormalities, cardiac surgery, advanced age, congenital heart, genetic, or other 
disorder.

Important Potential Risk: Pancreatitis 
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine: 
Lorviqua non-clinical and clinical studies  
Pancreatic enzymes elevation and pancreatitis are known effects of some ALK/ROS1 
inhibitors, however the relationship between Lorviqua administration and pancreatitis is 
not yet established. If untreated, pancreatitis may lead to life threatening or fatal 
consequences. 
Risk factors for pancreatitis include hypertriglyceridaemia, gallstones, heavy alcohol 
abuse, direct trauma, variety of medications (e.g., steroids, HIV medications, diuretics, 
anticonvulsants, chemotherapy, antihyperglycemic agents, and atypical antipsychotics), 
infections such as mumps, smoking, and cystic fibrosis.

Important Potential Risk:  Embryo-foetal toxicity 
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine: 
Lorviqua non-clinical and clinical studies 
Studies in animals treated with Lorviqua and other drugs in class have shown embryo-
foetal toxicity, however, the relationship between Lorviqua use and embryo-foetal toxicity 
has not been established in humans. Lorviqua may cause foetal harm when administered to 
a pregnant woman.   
Risk factors and risk groups include women of childbearing potential, pregnant women, 
and lactating women.

monotherapy versus crizotinib monotherapy in the first line treatment of patients with 
advanced ALK positive non small cell lung cancer (B7461006) comparing lorlatinib 
versus crizotinib in the first line treatment for patients with advanced ALK positive 
NSCLC to further characterise the efficacy of lorlatinib.  
Purpose of the study: 
The ongoing study B7461006 will additionally characterize lorlatinib and include overall 
survival data by 30 June 2025.      
•  Study short name and title: Study B7461027: Single-arm Study of Lorviqua in patients 
with advanced ALK positive NSCLC whose disease progressed after one prior second-
generation ALK TKI 
Purpose of the study: 
The planned Post Approval Efficacy Study (PAES) will additionally confirm efficacy in 
the second-line setting i.e. after alectinib or ceritinib.  
Both studies will support conversion from the conditional approval to a full marketing 
authorisation. 
II.C.2. Other Studies in Post-Authorisation Development Plan 
Lorviqua Hepatic Impairment Trial (B7461040) 
Purpose of the study: 
The primary objective is to evaluate the effect of moderate and severe hepatic impairment on the 
100 mg single dose plasma PK of lorlatinib  
The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single 100 mg oral dose of 
lorlatinib in participants with normal hepatic function and participants with moderate or severe 
hepatic impairment.

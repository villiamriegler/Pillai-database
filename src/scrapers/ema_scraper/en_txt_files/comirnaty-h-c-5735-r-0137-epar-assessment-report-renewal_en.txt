1.  Background information on the renewal 
The European Commission issued on 21 December 2020, a conditional marketing authorisation (MA) 
for Comirnaty. This implied that, pursuant to Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Article 5 
of Commission Regulation (EC) No 507/2006, the marketing authorisation holder (MAH) has to 
complete ongoing studies, or to conduct new studies, as listed in Annex II.E of the MA, the so-called 
Specific Obligations (SOBs). These data form the basis of the renewal of the conditional MA. 
A conditional MA is valid for one year and may be renewed annually upon request by the MAH. 
Therefore, pursuant to Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Article 6(2) of Commission 
Regulation (EC) No 507/2006, the MAH BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH, submitted to the Agency on 17 
June 2022 an application for renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation for Comirnaty. The 
expiry date of the MA is 21 December 2022. 
The period covered by this annual renewal is 30 April 2021 to 29 April 2022.

characterise the truncated and 
modified mRNA species 
present in the finished product. 
Data are expected to cover 
batches used in clinical trials 
(for which the characterisation 
data could be available earlier) 
and the PPQ batches. 
These data should address 
results from ion pairing RP-
HPLC addressing 5’cap levels 
and presence of the poly(A) 
tail. These data should further 
address the potential for 
translation into truncated S1S2 
proteins/peptides or other 
proteins/peptides. Relevant 
protein/peptide 
characterization data for 
predominant species should be 
provided. Any homology 
between translated proteins 
(other than the intended spike 
protein) and human proteins 
that may, due to molecular 
mimicry, potentially cause an 
autoimmune process should be 
evaluated.

observed Western Blot (WB) 
bands obtained by the in vitro

heterogeneity, resulting in 
broad bands on the WB and 
uncertainties in the theoretical 
intact molecular weight of the 
spike protein, is assumed to be 
due to glycosylation. 
Therefore, to further confirm 
protein identities, enzymatic 
deglycosylation of the 
expressed proteins followed by 
WB analysis should be 
performed. Correlation with 
the calculated molecular 
weights of the intact S1S2

MAH should submit the final

study C4591007. 
Quality SOBs (SOB 001, SOB 002, SOB 003, SOB 004 and SOB 005) 
During the period covered by this annual renewal, data on the quality SOBs have been submitted and 
assessed. The CHMP is of the view that all quality SOBs adopted with the initial marketing 
authorisation have been fulfilled. 
Clinical SOBs (SOB 006 and SOB 007) 
The MAH believes that as of now, comprehensive data are available from multiple sources, including 
but not limited to clinical trials, exhaustively informing about the safety, reactogenicity, 
immunogenicity and efficacy of Comirnaty and supporting the favourable benefit/risk profile of in all 
approved populations. 
The MAH has therefore requested to take the opportunity of the present renewal of Comirnaty’s 
conditional marketing authorisation to remove the submission of the final Clinical Study Reports of 
studies C4591001 and C4591007 from the list of specific obligations and to adopt an opinion 
recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation in accordance with Article 14(1) of Regulation 
(EC) No 726/2004 (‘marketing authorisation not subject to specific obligations’).  
The MAH’s justification for the request above has been assessed in the post authorisation measure 
procedures EMEA/H/C/005735/SOB/043 and EMEA/H/C/005735/SOB/044. 
Considering the vaccination of a large proportion of the control arm patients in study C4591001, which 
was unavoidable, it is agreed that the continued follow-up would no longer be informative on the 
safety and efficacy profile of Comirnaty. Thus, the MAH’s justification for early termination of study 
C4591001 is considered justified. Similarly, due to further interventions after the primary series, is not 
expected that the remaining outstanding data from study C4591007 will alter the benefit-risk profile of 
Comirnaty for the presently approved use in paediatric subjects.  
Therefore, the justification for removal of study C4591001 and study C4591007 from the list of specific 
obligations is considered acceptable by the Committee. 
In summary, it is not expected that the remaining outstanding data from study C4591001 and study 
C4591007 will bring substantial additional confirmatory evidence impacting the benefit-risk profile of 
Comirnaty in the respective age groups. The remaining clinical SOBs may therefore be reclassified as 
category 3 studies in the RMP, with the final CSRs to be submitted at a later stage as supportive data, 
notwithstanding the premature closure of the dedicated studies.  
As part of this annual renewal the CHMP is of the opinion that SOBs 006 and 007 can therefore be deleted 
Assessment report on the renewal of the marketing authorisation assessment report

from Annex II. 
2.3.  Overall conclusion on Specific Obligations 
During the period covered by this annual renewal, new data on all SOBs have been generated. The new 
data  provided  to  address  the  SOBs  are  compliant  in  terms  of  adherence  to  deadlines  and  have  been 
considered acceptable to address the SOBs.  All quality SOBs are now considered fulfilled. The clinical 
safety profile, as well as the efficacy of this product, is considered comprehensively characterised and 
supportive of a positive benefit-risk balance. The clinical SOBs 006 and 007 may therefore be reclassified 
as category 3 studies in the RMP and deleted from Annex II, with the final CSRs to be submitted at a 
later stage as supportive data. 
3.  Additional scientific data provided relevant for the 
assessment of the benefit/risk balance

12-15 years of age, respectively. 
•  SO7: The Specific Obligation (SO) 7 relevant to the completion of study C4591007 was added 
on 26 November 2021 with the approval of procedure EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0077 extending 
the indication starting from paediatric subjects 5 years and older. This was recommended in 
the Assessment Report of the above procedure, considering the limited safety data and limited 
duration of follow-up available at the time of CHMP Opinion. The intent of the SO introduced 
with this procedure was to confirm the efficacy and safety of Comirnaty in this paediatric 
indication and ensure delivery of the final study report for the paediatric study C4591007, 
which has also been included in the RMP as Category 2 study accordingly. 
o  An update to the C4591007 CSR has been submitted to the Marketing Authorization 
with Variation EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0129 (submitted 12 May 2022), reporting the 1-
month post-dose-3 data for study subjects 5-11 years of age.

Post DLP, an updated version of the EU SmPC was approved on 04 May 2022 by EMA.  
This updated version includes the introduction of heterologous booster after adenoviral vector vaccines 
and mRNA vaccines in the primary course in adults and the reduction of the interval between primary 
vaccination course and booster vaccination from currently 6 months to 3 months. 
The SmPC is in line with the CDS.  
As an outcome of the 14th Summary Safety Report (MEA 002.13), the MAH was requested to submit a 
variation (or justify otherwise) within 30 days to update the occurrence of myocarditis as more 
information is available in the age group 5-11 years and to update the statement in the SmPC section 
4.4 regarding the risk of myocarditis after a third dose of Comirnaty. For this, the MAH has submitted 
the type II variation (EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0141).  
Patient exposure 
Clinical studies 
Cumulatively through 21 April 2022, 63,910 participants have participated in the BNT162b2 clinical 
development program comprising several clinical candidates, as outlined below: 
Assessment report on the renewal of the marketing authorisation assessment report  
EMA/853699/2022  
Page 18/36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  BNT162b2: 56,795 participants of which 
o  30,631 had received BNT162b2;  
o  25,205 had received BNT162b2 post-unblinding and had received placebo before; 
o  959 had received BNT162b2/placebo. 
•  Variant vaccines based on BNT162b2: 3016 participants of which 
o  747 had received BNT162b2 (B.1.351); 
o  372 had received BNT162b2 (B.1.617.2); 
o  545 had received BNT162b2 (B.1.1.7 + B.1.617.2); 
o  20 had received BNT162b2 (B.1.1.7); 
o  667 administered with BNT162b2 (B.1.1.529); 
o  665 administered with BNT162b2/ BNT162b2 OMI. 
• 
Early development candidates: 633 participants of which 
o  30 had received BNT162a1; 
o  411 had received BNT162b1, including 48 participants at 10 μg and 363 participants at 
30 μg; 
o  96 had received BNT162b3; 
o  96 had received BNT162c2. 
•  Blinded therapy: 7493 participants. 
• 
Placebo: 3367 participants. 
Post-marketing experience worldwide 
It is not possible to determine with certainty the number of individuals who received BNT162b2 during 
the period of this review. Estimated worldwide cumulative shipped doses may serve as a reasonable 
indicator of the cumulative subject exposure, considering that approximately 77% of the cumulative 
shipped doses were administered; this estimation is a weight average considering the proportion of 
cumulative doses administered out of those shipped upon review of the cumulative data currently 
available for the EU-EEA countries and the US. 
With these caveats in mind, it is estimated that approximately 3,352,695,090 doses of BNT162b2 were 
shipped worldwide from the receipt of the first temporary authorisation for emergency supply on 01 
December 2020 through 15 April 2022, corresponding to 2,581,772,503 estimated administered doses. 
The estimated cumulative number of shipped and administered doses of BNT162b2 by region based on 
data provided in the shipment tracker (Order Book), from the receipt of the first temporary 
authorisation for emergency supply on 01 December 2020 through 15 April 2022, are summarized in 
Table 8. 
Assessment report on the renewal of the marketing authorisation assessment report  
EMA/853699/2022  
Page 19/36 
 
 
 
Table 8.  Cumulative Estimated Shipped/Administered Doses of BNT162b2 by Region 
Worldwide 
Additionally, as per data provided by LP, in the Fosun Territories (Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan) the 
following approximate doses of BNT162b2 were administered cumulatively through 15 April 2022:  
•  Hong Kong: 9,221,575 doses; 
•  Macau: 230,477 doses; 
• 
Taiwan: 15,669,512 doses. 
Post-marketing experience in the EU-EEA 
Estimated cumulative shipped doses in the EU-EEA countries may serve as a reasonable indicator of 
the cumulative subject exposure in these countries, considering that approximately 76% of the 
cumulative shipped doses were administered; this estimation is based on the proportion of the 
cumulative doses administered out of those shipped upon review of the cumulative data currently 
available for the EU-EEA countries. 
With these caveats in mind, it is estimated that approximately 832,308,180 doses of BNT162b2 were 
shipped in the EU-EEA countries from the receipt of the first conditional marketing authorisation 
approval on 21 December 2020 through 15 April 2022, corresponding to 632,554,217 estimated 
administered doses.

Countries (30) 
Stratified data on the administered first and second doses, paediatric doses, and booster dose were not 
reproduced here.  
The CHMP noted that up to 15 April 2022, it is estimated that approximately 2,6 billion doses of 
BNT162b2 were administered worldwide. Of these, over 632 million doses were administered in the EU 
and EEA countries.  
Data in Summary Tabulations 
Cumulatively, there have been 2245 clinical trial cases (2943 SAEs) reported. During the reporting 
interval, there have been 20 clinical trial cases (22 SAEs) reported. 
Cumulatively, there have been 1,389,181 post-marketing cases (4,674,419 ADRs) reported. During 
the reporting interval, there have been 1,280,485 post-marketing cases (4,252,051 ADRs) reported. 
Significant findings from clinical trials and non-interventional studies 
Assessment report on the renewal of the marketing authorisation assessment report  
EMA/853699/2022  
Page 21/36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Completed clinical trials 
No clinical trials were completed up to 21 April 2022. 
Ongoing clinical trials 
There were 15 ongoing clinical trials up to 21 April 2022. For 9 interventional trials, BioNTech is the 
sponsor and Pfizer acts as lead development party. Additionally there are 4 BioNTech interventional 
trials and 2 studies from Fosun (BioNTech LP) with BioNTech third party acting as lead development 
party. 
Clinically important emerging efficacy and safety findings were identified for Study C4591031 Substudy 
A and are summarized below. 
Study C4591031 Substudy A is a Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind substudy 
aimed at evaluating the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of a booster dose of BNT162b2. Participants 
≥16 years of age who had completed a 2-dose primary series of BNT162b2 in Study C4591001 at least 
6 months prior to randomization, were enrolled and randomized at a ratio of 1:1 to receive either 
BNT162b2 or placebo. Randomization was stratified by age, such that approximately 60% of 
participants enrolled were ≥16 to 55 years of age and approximately 40% of participants >55 years of 
age. Considering the observation of waning effectiveness and recommendation for booster doses in 
some countries, per the protocol, participants could be unblinded from 24 September 2021 onwards 
and those randomized to placebo were offered a dose of BNT162b2 30 μg. The efficacy results were 
not reproduced here. With regard to safety, within 1 month after the administration of Dose 3, AEs 
were more frequent in the vaccine group than in the placebo group. Injection site pain was the most 
frequently reported AE in the 2 groups and was reported more often in the vaccine group vs the 
placebo group (risk difference, 11.3 percentage points). From Dose 3 through the data cut-off date, 
SAEs were reported by slightly more participants in the placebo group than in the vaccine group (0.5% 
vs 0.3%). No cases of myocarditis or pericarditis were reported at the time of this interim analysis. 
No new clinically important information has emerged from the CT C4591030 ongoing following the DLP 
of the most recently submitted PSUR up to the DLP of this ACO. 
The CHMP noted that no new safety information was identified from the ongoing clinical trials. 
Non-interventional studies 
During this reporting period, there were no NISs completed with a final CSR. Six NI safety studies, 
including 5 PASSs denoted in bold, were ongoing (Table 10). No new safety information was reported 
regarding these ongoing non-interventional studies. 
Assessment report on the renewal of the marketing authorisation assessment report  
EMA/853699/2022  
Page 22/36 
 
 
 
Table 10.  Non-Interventional Studies Ongoing During the Reporting Period 
The CHMP noted that the interim report of the PASS study C4591012, which is listed in the RMP of 
Comirnaty, is currently under assessment (procedure EMEA/H/C/005735/MEA/010.4). Study C4591008 
is not part of the EU-RMP.  
Medication errors 
During the reporting period 88,782 cases (including 114,763 medication errors) were reported. Among 
the 85,114 relevant medication error cases (including 107,492 medication errors), the following 
scenarios, categorized according to the EMA guidance “Good practice guide on recording, coding, 
reporting and assessment of medication errors” (EMA/762563/2014), were described: 
•  2148 medication errors associated with harm [i.e., resulting in adverse reaction(s)] were 
reported in 2141 cases (2.5% of relevant medication error cases); 144 of them were serious. 
•  105,136 medication errors without harm [i.e., not resulting in adverse reaction(s)] were 
reported in 83,020 cases (97.3% of relevant medication error cases), of which 33,066 cases 
involved co-reported AEs; 
•  205 potential medication errors were reported in 173 cases (0.2% of relevant medication error 
cases). 
•  3 intercepted medication errors were reported in 3 cases (0.004% of relevant medication error 
cases). 
The 85,114 relevant medication error cases originated mostly (≥1000 cases) from the following 
countries: the US (20,602 cases), Austria (13,930), the UK (11,466), Germany (11,029), Netherlands

(4594), Sweden (3297), Canada (3258), France (2832), Japan (2724), Australia (1506), and Brazil 
(1084). 
The most commonly (≥1000 events) reported medication errors were coded to the PTs Inappropriate 
schedule of product administration (49,614), Poor quality product administered (18,325), Product 
temperature excursion issue (11802), Incorrect route of product administration (3981), Product 
administration error (3678), Expired product administered (3017), Product administered to patient of 
inappropriate age (2682), Product preparation error (2646), Underdose (2371), Product preparation 
issue (1945), Incorrect dose administered (1437) and Product storage error (1331). 
During the reporting interval, there were 2 relevant serious clinical trial cases that reported one 
medication error each [no harm; Accidental overdose (serious and unrelated to BNT162b2) and 
Inappropriate schedule of product administration (non-serious)]. 
The CHMP noted that no new safety signal was identified from the cases reporting medication errors. 
Medication errors have been assessed in the PSUSAs and SSRs.  
Non-clinical data 
During this reporting interval, no new safety information regarding non-clinical data were reported. 
Literature 
Non-clinical (Published) 
According to the MAH, a search of the Medline and Embase databases did not identify non-clinical 
studies that presented important new safety findings for COVID-19 vaccine up to 29 April 2022.   
Clinical (Published) 
A search of the Medline and Embase databases identified 7 clinical trials that presented important new 
safety findings for COVID-19 vaccine. These are presented in Table 11 below grouped as follows: a) At

Citation/Abstract 
a) At Risk Patients 
Four articles (1-4) described a reduced immune response to BNT162b2 in patients with 
immunocompromised conditions/treated with immunosuppressants. Section 4.4. Special warnings 
and precautions for use (Immunocompromised individuals) of the EU SmPC includes a warning 
regarding vaccination in immunocompromised patients, as follows, “The efficacy and safety of the 
vaccine has not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving 
immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of Comirnaty may be lower in immunocompromised 
individuals.” 
Use in immunocompromised patients is categorized as missing information in the EU-RMP v 5.0.

This article contributes to the growing evidence that risk of spontaneous abortion after COVID-19 
vaccine immunization during the first trimester of pregnancy is commensurate with the predicted risk 
in nonvaccinated pregnant women. 
Use in pregnancy is categorised as missing information in the EU-RMP v 5.0.

Vaccine and the Risk of Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss. JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 
2022;148(4):299–306. 
This study suggests that the COVID-19 vaccine might be associated with increased risk of Sudden 
Sensorineural Hearing Loss; however, the effect size is very small. The study had various limitations 
and no causality assessment has been conducted. The MAH will continue to monitor using routine 
pharmacovigilance.

Anticoagulation Control in Patients Using Vitamin K Antagonists. Thromb Haemost 2022; 122:377–
385. 
In this study, BNT162b2 was associated with an immediate negative effect on anticoagulation control 
in patients treated with vitamin K antagonists. The author though, cannot exclude the possibility that 
the effect on anticoagulation control was due to dose adjustments to avoid complications and 
patients themselves could have decided to decrease the dosage in the days following COVID-19 
vaccination as they might be afraid for bleeding complications after intramuscular injection. This 
could result in a higher percentage of subtherapeutic INRs after vaccination. In addition, the authors 
use a surrogate variable for bleeding complications (INR >5). 
The possible effects of vaccines on anticoagulation control remain debated even though several 
prospective studies have been performed (mostly on the effect of the influenza vaccine on 
anticoagulation control), but overall results were conflicting. As of now, there is no biological or 
pharmacological plausibility for a vaccine – drug interaction. The MAH will continue to monitor using 
routine pharmacovigilance. 
All other published sources 
A search of the Medline and Embase databases identified no new information that presented important 
new safety findings for BNT162b2. 
Unpublished manuscripts/abstracts/scientific meeting findings 
During the reporting interval, no new safety findings were identified.  
In summary, the MAH identified a total of seven relevant literature articles. Of these, four articles 
report results of studies in immunocompromised patients and one in pregnant women. No new safety 
information was identified from these studies. The 6th article describing a study on the association 
between sudden sensorineural hearing loss and Comirnaty was previously discussed in the 3rd bi-
monthly SSR. Within this procedure, the MAH was requested to provide a cumulative review on sudden 
sensorineural hearing loss within the next PSUR (DLP: 18/06/2022), which is currently under 
assessment. The last article described an association of BNT162b2 with an immediate negative effect 
on anticoagulation control in patients treated with vitamin K antagonists, a topic which the MAH will 
continue to monitor using routine pharmacovigilance.

The signals that were closed by the MAH for which however further evaluation is ongoing or has been 
requested in the remit of the PSUR/signal procedure and therefore cannot be considered closed are:  
•  Glomerulonephritis/nephrotic syndrome: following the assessment of the signal in the last 
PSUR procedure, the MAH was requested to provide, in the next PSUR (DLP: 18/06/2022), a 
cumulative review of cases regarding IgA nephropathy, including details of the underlying 
condition(s), time to onset, duration, outcome and an assessment of the causal relationship 
with the vaccination.   
•  Heavy menstrual bleeding: following assessment of the signal procedure (EPITT ref. 19783), 
the PRAC concluded that the current evidence was insufficient to warrant an update to the 
product information at present. However, an updated cumulative review within the signal 
procedure was requested.  
•  Amenorrhea: following assessment of the signal procedure (EPITT ref. 19784), the PRAC 
concluded that the current evidence was insufficient to warrant an update to the product 
information at present. However, an updated cumulative review was requested in the next 
PSUR (DLP: 18/06/2022).

Long-Term Safety Data 
Within the reporting interval, “Myocarditis and Pericarditis” was added as an important identified risk to 
the safety concerns.  
Based on the data submitted with the renewal application, the CHMP is of the view that no changes to 
the summary of safety concerns listed in the RMP are warranted.  
It is noted that with version 6.0 of the RMP, submitted as part of variation EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0140 
(Opinion 01/09/2022), anaphylaxis has been removed from the safety concerns.  
The MAH has also been requested by EMA to critically appraise if the wealth of safety data accumulated 
during the product use can inform rationalising the safety concerns in the RMP, at the next regulatory 
opportunity. 
3.4.  Pharmacovigilance inspections 
During the renewal period, the following inspections of MAH’s pharmacovigilance system were

4.  Risk management plan 
The MAH has confirmed the current approved RMP remains unchanged and applicable. 
During the reporting interval, the following changes have been implemented in the RMP: 
o  Update of the therapeutic indication to include individuals 12 years of age and older; 
o 
Inclusion of new information from interim study C4591001 results for all participants ≥16 
o 
o 
years of age and including participants with confirmed stable HIV disease; 
Inclusion of a new formulation and update on potential medication errors; 
Inclusion of myocarditis and pericarditis as important identified risks, with supporting data 
from clinical trials and safety databases and update of the information on planned/ongoing 
post-authorization safety studies with inclusion of 2 new studies, and the circulation of a DHPC; 
o  Update of the therapeutic indication to include individuals 5 years of age and older; 
o 
Inclusion of data from the booster dose and third dose in immunocompromised as part of the 
primary vaccination including data in patients who have undergone a solid organ 
transplantation 
o  Discontinuation of enrolment in study C4591015 
As described above, based on the data submitted with the renewal application, the CHMP is of the view 
that no changes to the summary of safety concerns listed in the RMP are warranted. The remaining 
clinical SOBs may therefore be reclassified as category 3 studies in the RMP, with the final CSRs to be 
submitted at a later stage as supportive data, notwithstanding the premature closure of the dedicated 
studies. Thus, as an outcome of the renewal procedure, the MAH is requested to submit an updated 
RMP at the next regulatory opportunity.

5.  Changes to the Product Information 
Annexes I, II and IIIB of the current marketing authorisation were amended to reflect the granting of a 
marketing authorisation not subject to Specific Obligations for Comirnaty. 
Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Comirnaty (tozinameran) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 01 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
6.  Overall conclusions and benefit-risk balance 
6.1.  Specific Obligations (SOBs) 
Compliance of SOB data submitted 
During the period covered by this annual renewal data on the SOBs have been submitted that overall 
are  compliant  in  terms  of  adherence  to  deadlines  and  are  compliant  in  terms of  acceptability  of  data 
submitted.  
All quality SOBs are now  considered fulfilled. The clinical safety profile, as  well as the efficacy of this 
product, is considered comprehensively characterised and supportive of a positive benefit-risk balance. 
The clinical SOBs 006 and 007 may therefore be reclassified as category 3 studies in the RMP and deleted 
from Annex II, with the final CSRs to be submitted at a later stage as supportive data. 
Updated list of Specific Obligations (SOBs)  
The CHMP is of the opinion that the comprehensive existing data package for this vaccine warrants 
conversion of the current conditional approval into a marketing authorisation not subject to specific 
obligations. The clinical SOBs 006 and 007 will be reclassified as category 3 studies in the RMP, with 
the final CSRs to be submitted at a later stage as supportive data. 
6.2.  Benefit-risk Balance 
During the period covered by this annual renewal, new data have emerged. However, these data do 
not have an impact on the benefit-risk of COMIRNATY in the approved indication. 
The data collected as part of the specific obligations for Comirnaty during the period covered by this 
annual renewal confirmed its positive benefit-risk balance in the approved indication. 
Assessment report on the renewal of the marketing authorisation assessment report  
EMA/853699/2022  
Page 32/36 
 
 
 
Favourable effects 
The favourable effects were demonstrated in the initial marketing authorisation for persons 16 years of 
age and older and updated in a type II variation to extend its use to adolescents 12-15 years of age. 
Since the last renewal, type II variations have been submitted: 
- to also include homologous and heterologous booster doses and, 
- to extend to children from 5 years of age in the indication using a lower dose (10 µg/dose).  
The most important favourable effects are briefly summarised below.  
The overall vaccine efficacy against symptomatic laboratory confirmed COVID-19 from 7 days after 
dose 2 was 95.0% (95% CI 90.0, 97.9) in subjects ≥16 years of age without prior evidence of SARS 
CoV-2 infection and 94.6% (95% CI 89.6, 97.6) in all subjects regardless of prior evidence of SARS 
CoV-2 infection (primary endpoint). This outcome met the pre-specified success criteria.   
The efficacy of the vaccine (BNT162b2, 2 doses of 30 µg, separated by 21 days) to prevent COVID-19 
in the adolescents aged 12- 15 years either without or with and without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 
infection, occurring at least 7 days after the second dose, was 100.0% (95%CI 75.3; 100 and 95%CI 
78.1; 100, respectively).  
In addition, Comirnaty was shown to elicit non-inferior immune responses in subjects 12-15 years of 
age without previous COVID-19 compared to subjects 16-25 years in terms of geometric mean titres of 
neutralising antibodies one-month post dose 2. 
The efficacy of the vaccine (BNT162b2, 2 doses of 10 µg, separated by 21 days) to prevent COVID-19 
in children aged 5 - 11 years either without or with and without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 
infection, occurring at least 7 days after the second dose, was 90.7 % (95%CI: 67.7; 98.3 and 95% 
CI: 67.4%, 98.3%, respectively).  
In addition, Comirnaty was shown to elicit non-inferior immune responses in subjects 5-11 years of 
age without previous COVID-19 compared to subjects 16-25 years in terms of geometric mean titres of 
neutralising antibodies one-month post dose 2. 
The efficacy of a homologous booster dose was demonstrated in terms of relative efficacy compared to 
‘unboosted’ subjects. The relative vaccine efficacy information for participants 16 years of age and 
older without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 95.3% (95% CI: 89.5; 98.3%). 
The efficacy of heterologous booster was inferred from immunogenicity data demonstrating 36, 12, 
and 20 GMR-fold rise in neutralising titres following the Janssen, Moderna, and Comirnaty primary 
doses, respectively. 
Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Remaining uncertainties mainly relate to use in immunocompromised subjects, long-term efficacy and 
safety, and e.g. efficacy against transmission. Uncertainties are described in previous variation 
assessment reports. 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety of Comirnaty was evaluated in participants 16 years of age and older in 2 clinical studies 
(BNT162-01 and C4591001) that included 21,744 participants that have received at least one dose of 
Comirnaty in the initial approval application. Overall, the safety profile of Comirnaty is considered 
Assessment report on the renewal of the marketing authorisation assessment report  
EMA/853699/2022  
Page 33/36 
 
 
 
acceptable. The product information has been updated since approval as new data has emerged. All 
data have been assessed in other procedures such as monthly safety updates, periodic safety updates, 
signal assessments and variations. 
Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The uncertainties and limitations of unfavourable effects have been discussed in other procedures. The 
principal uncertainties are related to long-term effects, and effects in specific risk groups.   
Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
The benefits of Comirnaty in terms of protection against COVID-19 clearly outweigh the identified 
risks, and no new information has emerged during this renewal period that has changed the balance. 
All quality related SOBs are considered fulfilled. 
The clinical SOBs 006 and 007 will be reclassified as category 3 studies in the RMP and deleted from 
Annex II, with the final CSRs to be submitted at a later stage as supportive data. 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Not Applicable. 
Balance of benefits and risks 
Based on the cumulative evidence in terms of favourable and unfavourable effects, the benefit-risk 
balance of Comirnaty remains positive. 
Scientific grounds for recommending the granting of a marketing 
authorisation not subject to specific obligations 
The MAH believes that as of now, comprehensive data are available from multiple sources, including 
but not limited to clinical trials, exhaustively informing about the safety, reactogenicity, 
immunogenicity and efficacy of Comirnaty and supporting the favourable benefit/risk profile of in all 
approved populations. 
The MAH has therefore requested to take the opportunity of the present renewal of Comirnaty’s 
conditional marketing authorisation to remove the submission of the final Clinical Study Reports of 
studies C4591001 and C4591007 from the list of specific obligations and to adopt an opinion 
recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation in accordance with Article 14(1) of Regulation 
(EC) No 726/2004 (‘marketing authorisation not subject to specific obligations’).  
The MAH’s justification for the request above has been assessed in the post authorisation measure 
procedures EMEA/H/C/005735/SOB/043, SOB/044. 
Considering the vaccination of a large proportion of the control arm patients in study C4591001, which 
was unavoidable, it is agreed that the continued follow-up would no longer be informative on the 
safety and efficacy profile of Comirnaty. Thus, the MAH’s justification for early termination of study 
C4591001 is considered justified. Similarly, due to further interventions after the primary series, is not 
expected that the remaining outstanding data from study C4591007 will alter the benefit-risk profile of 
Comirnaty for the presently approved use in paediatric subjects.  
Assessment report on the renewal of the marketing authorisation assessment report  
EMA/853699/2022  
Page 34/36 
 
 
 
Therefore, the justification for removal of study C4591001 and study C4591007 from the list of specific 
obligations is considered acceptable by the Committee. 
In summary, it is not expected that the remaining outstanding data from study C4591001 and study 
C4591007 will bring substantial additional confirmatory evidence impacting the benefit-risk profile of 
Comirnaty in the respective age groups. The remaining clinical SOBs may therefore be reclassified as 
category 3 studies in the RMP, with the final CSRs to be submitted at a later stage as supportive data, 
notwithstanding the premature closure of the dedicated studies. As part of this annual renewal the 
CHMP is of the opinion that SOBs 006 and 007 can therefore be deleted from Annex II. The conditional 
marketing authorisation can therefore be converted into a standard marketing authorisation not 
subject to Specific Obligations. 
7.  Recommendations 
Based on the review of the available information on the status of the fulfilment of Specific Obligations, 
the benefit-risk balance for Comirnaty in its approved indication (please refer to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics) continues to be favourable. As all Specific Obligations have either been fulfilled 
or reclassified as category 3 studies in the RMP, there are no remaining grounds for the marketing 
authorisation to remain conditional and the CHMP therefore recommends the granting of a standard 
marketing authorisation not subject to Specific Obligations for Comirnaty. 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the annual renewal, amendments to Annexes I, II and IIIB to the 
current marketing authorisation are recommended. 
The CHMP is of the opinion that the comprehensive existing data package for this vaccine warrants 
conversion of the current conditional approval into a standard marketing authorisation not subject to 
Specific Obligations. As a result, it is recommended that the final study reports for the clinical SOBs are 
reclassified as category 3 studies in the RMP and therefore deleted from the Annex II to this opinion. 
Conditions of the marketing authorisation 
The marketing authorisation is subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk management plan (RMP)

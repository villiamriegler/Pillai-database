CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
Therapeutic indications 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, Sitagliptin SUN is indicated to improve glycaemic 
control:  
as monotherapy: 
• 
in patients inadequately controlled by diet and exercise alone and for whom metformin is 
inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance. 
as dual oral therapy in combination with: 
• 
• 
• 
metformin when diet and exercise plus metformin alone do not provide adequate glycaemic 
control. 
a sulphonylurea when diet and exercise plus maximal tolerated dose of a sulphonylurea alone do 
not provide adequate glycaemic control and when metformin is inappropriate due to 
contraindications or intolerance. 
a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonist (i.e. a thiazolidinedione) 
when use of a PPARγ agonist is appropriate and when diet and exercise plus the PPARγ agonist 
alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
as triple oral therapy in combination with: 
• 
• 
a sulphonylurea and metformin when diet and exercise plus dual therapy with these medicinal 
products do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
a PPARγ agonist and metformin when use of a PPARγ agonist is appropriate and when diet and 
exercise plus dual therapy with these medicinal products do not provide adequate glycaemic 
control. 
Sitagliptin SUN is also indicated as add-on to insulin (with or without metformin) when diet and 
exercise plus stable dose of insulin do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
4.2 
Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The  dose  is  100 mg  sitagliptin  once  daily.  When  used  in  combination  with  metformin  and/or  a 
PPARγ agonist, the dose of metformin and/or PPARγ agonist should be maintained, and sitagliptin 
administered concomitantly. 
When sitagliptin is used in combination with a sulphonylurea or with insulin, a lower dose of 
the sulphonylurea or insulin may be considered to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia (see 
section 4.4). 
Missed dose 
If a dose of sitagliptin is missed, it should be taken as soon as the patient remembers. A double 
dose should not be taken on the same day. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
When considering the use of sitagliptin in combination with another anti-diabetic medicinal 
product, its conditions for use in patients with renal impairment should be checked. 
For patients with mild renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] ≥ 60 to < 90 mL/min), 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
no dose adjustment is required. 
For patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR ≥ 45 to < 60 mL/min), no dose adjustment 
is required. 
For patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR ≥ 30 to < 45 mL/min), the dose of sitagliptin is 
50 mg once daily. 
For patients with severe renal impairment (GFR ≥ 15 to <30 mL/min) or with end-stage renal disease 
(ESRD) (GFR < 15 mL/min), including those requiring haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, the dose 
of sitagliptin is 25 mg once daily. Treatment may be administered without regard to the timing of 
dialysis. 
Because there is a dose adjustment based upon renal function, assessment of renal function 
is recommended prior to initiation of sitagliptin and periodically thereafter. 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Sitagliptin has 
not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and care should be exercised (see section 
5.2). 
However, because sitagliptin is primarily renally eliminated, severe hepatic impairment is 
not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is necessary based on age. 
Paediatric population 
Sitagliptin should not be used in children and adolescents 10 to 17 years of age because of 
insufficient efficacy. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2. Sitagliptin 
has not been studied in paediatric patients under 10 years of age. 
Method of administration 
Oral use. 
Sitagliptin SUN can be taken with or without food. 
4.3 
Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 (see sections 
4.4 and 4.8). 
4.4 
Special warnings and precautions for use 
General 
Sitagliptin should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes or for the treatment of diabetic 
ketoacidosis. 
Acute pancreatitis 
Use of DPP-4 inhibitors has been associated with a risk of developing acute pancreatitis. Patients 
should be informed of the characteristic symptom of acute pancreatitis: persistent, severe abdominal 
pain. Resolution of pancreatitis has been observed after discontinuation of sitagliptin (with or without 
supportive treatment), but very rare cases of necrotising or haemorrhagic pancreatitis and/or death 
have been reported. If pancreatitis is suspected, sitagliptin and other potentially suspect medicinal 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
products should be discontinued; if acute pancreatitis is confirmed, sitagliptin should not be restarted. 
Caution should be exercised in patients with a history of pancreatitis. 
Hypoglycaemia when used in combination with other anti-hyperglycaemic medicinal products 
In clinical studies of sitagliptin as monotherapy and as part of combination therapy with medicinal 
products not known to cause hypoglycaemia (i.e. metformin and/or a PPARγ agonist), rates of 
hypoglycaemia reported with sitagliptin were similar to rates in patients taking placebo. 
Hypoglycaemia has been observed when sitagliptin was used in combination with insulin or a 
sulphonylurea. Therefore, to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia, a lower dose of sulphonylurea or 
insulin may be considered (see section 4.2). 
Renal impairment 
Sitagliptin is renally excreted. To achieve plasma concentrations of sitagliptin similar to those in 
patients with normal renal function, lower doses are recommended in patients with GFR < 45 mL/min, 
as well as in ESRD patients requiring haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
When considering the use of sitagliptin in combination with another anti-diabetic medicinal product, 
its conditions for use in patients with renal impairment should be checked. 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Post-marketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with sitagliptin have 
been reported. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions 
including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after 
initiation of treatment, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a hypersensitivity reaction is 
suspected, sitagliptin should be discontinued. Other potential causes for the event should be assessed, 
and alternative treatment for diabetes initiated. 
Bullous pemphigoid 
There have been post-marketing reports of bullous pemphigoid in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors 
including sitagliptin. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, sitagliptin should be discontinued. 
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
Hydrogenated castor oil 
This medicinal product contains hydrogenated castor oil which may cause stomach upset and diarrhea. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Effects of other medicinal products on sitagliptin 
Clinical data described below suggest that the risk for clinically meaningful interactions by co-
administered medicinal products is low. 
In vitro studies indicated that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin 
is CYP3A4, with contribution from CYP2C8. In patients with normal renal function, metabolism, 
including via CYP3A4, plays only a small role in the clearance of sitagliptin. Metabolism may play a 
more significant role in the elimination of sitagliptin in the setting of severe renal impairment or end-
stage renal disease (ESRD). For this reason, it is possible that potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (i.e. 
ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, clarithromycin) could alter the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin in 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD. The effect of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in the setting 
of renal impairment has not been assessed in a clinical study. 
In vitro transport studies showed that sitagliptin is a substrate for p-glycoprotein and organic anion 
transporter-3 (OAT3). OAT3 mediated transport of sitagliptin was inhibited in vitro by probenecid, 
although the risk of clinically meaningful interactions is considered to be low. Concomitant 
administration of OAT3 inhibitors has not been evaluated in vivo. 
Metformin: Co-administration of multiple twice-daily doses of 1 000 mg metformin with 50 mg 
sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin in patients with type 2 
diabetes. 
Ciclosporin: A study was conducted to assess the effect of ciclosporin, a potent inhibitor of 
p-glycoprotein, on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. Co-administration of a single 100 mg oral 
dose of sitagliptin and a single 600 mg oral dose of ciclosporin increased the AUC and Cmax of 
sitagliptin by approximately 29 % and 68 %, respectively. These changes in sitagliptin 
pharmacokinetics were not considered to be clinically meaningful. The renal clearance of sitagliptin 
was not meaningfully altered. Therefore, meaningful interactions would not be expected with other 
p-glycoprotein inhibitors. 
Effects of sitagliptin on other medicinal products 
Digoxin: Sitagliptin had a small effect on plasma digoxin concentrations. Following administration of 
0.25 mg digoxin concomitantly with 100 mg of sitagliptin daily for 10 days, the plasma AUC of 
digoxin was increased on average by 11 %, and the plasma Cmax on average by 18 %. No dose 
adjustment of digoxin is recommended. However, patients at risk of digoxin toxicity should be 
monitored for this when sitagliptin and digoxin are administered concomitantly. 
In vitro data suggest that sitagliptin does not inhibit nor induce CYP450 isoenzymes. In clinical 
studies, sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, 
simvastatin, rosiglitazone, warfarin, or oral contraceptives, providing in vivo evidence of a low 
propensity for causing interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and organic 
cationic transporter (OCT). Sitagliptin may be a mild inhibitor of p-glycoprotein in vivo. 
4.6 
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data from the use of sitagliptin in pregnant women. Studies in animals have 
shown reproductive toxicity at high doses (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. 
Due to lack of human data, sitagliptin should not be used during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether sitagliptin is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown 
excretion of sitagliptin in breast milk. Sitagliptin should not be used during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
Animal data do not suggest an effect of treatment with sitagliptin on male and female fertility. Human 
data are lacking. 
4.7 
Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Sitagliptin has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, when 
driving or using machines, it should be taken into account that dizziness and somnolence have been 
reported. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, patients should be alerted to the risk of hypoglycaemia when sitagliptin is used in 
combination with a sulphonylurea or with insulin. 
4.8 
Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Serious adverse reactions including pancreatitis and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. 
Hypoglycaemia has been reported in combination with sulphonylurea (4.7 %-13.8 %) and insulin 
(9.6 %) (see section 4.4).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Frequency not known 
Frequency not known 
In addition to the medicinal product-related adverse experiences described above, adverse experiences 
reported regardless of causal relationship to the medicinal product and occurring in at least 5 % and 
more commonly in patients treated with sitagliptin included upper respiratory tract infection and 
nasopharyngitis. 
Additional adverse experiences reported regardless of causal relationship to the medicinal product that 
occurred more frequently in patients treated with sitagliptin (not reaching the 5 % level, but occurring 
with an incidence of > 0.5 % higher with sitagliptin than that in the control group) included 
osteoarthritis and pain in extremity. 
Some adverse reactions were observed more frequently in studies of combination use of sitagliptin 
with other anti-diabetic medicinal products than in studies of sitagliptin monotherapy. These included 
hypoglycaemia (frequency very common with the combination of sulphonylurea and metformin), 
influenza (common with insulin [with or without metformin]), nausea and vomiting (common with 
metformin), flatulence (common with metformin or pioglitazone), constipation (common with the 
combination of sulphonylurea and metformin), peripheral oedema (common with pioglitazone or the 
combination of pioglitazone and metformin), somnolence and diarrhoea (uncommon with metformin), 
and dry mouth (uncommon with insulin [with or without metformin]). 
Paediatric population 
In clinical studies with sitagliptin in paediatric patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus aged 10 to17 years, 
the profile of adverse reactions was comparable to that observed in adults. 
TECOS cardiovascular safety study 
The trial evaluating cardiovascular outcomes with sitagliptin (TECOS) included 7 332 patients treated 
with sitagliptin, 100 mg daily (or 50 mg daily if the baseline eGFR was ≥ 30 and 
< 50 mL/min/1.73 m2), and 7 339 patients treated with placebo in the intention-to-treat population. 
Both treatments were added to usual care targeting regional standards for HbA1c and cardiovascular 
(CV) risk factors. The overall incidence of serious adverse events in patients receiving sitagliptin was 
similar to that in patients receiving placebo. 
In the intention-to-treat population, among patients who were using insulin and/or a sulfonylurea at 
baseline, the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia was 2.7 % in sitagliptin-treated patients and 2.5 % in 
placebo-treated patients; among patients who were not using insulin and/or a sulfonylurea at baseline, 
the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia was 1 % in sitagliptin-treated patients and 0.7 % in placebo-
treated patients. The incidence of adjudication-confirmed pancreatitis events was 0.3 % in sitagliptin-
treated patients and 0.2 % in placebo-treated patients. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

Overdose 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During controlled clinical studies in healthy subjects, single doses of up to 800 mg sitagliptin were 
administered. Minimal increases in QTc, not considered to be clinically relevant, were observed in one 
study at a dose of 800 mg sitagliptin. There is no experience with doses above 800 mg in clinical 
studies. In Phase I multiple-dose studies, there were no dose-related clinical adverse reactions 
observed with sitagliptin with doses of up to 600 mg per day for periods of up to 10 days and 400 mg 
per day for periods of up to 28 days. 
In the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures, e.g., remove 
unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring (including obtaining an 
electrocardiogram), and institute supportive therapy if required. 
Sitagliptin is modestly dialysable. In clinical studies, approximately 13.5 % of the dose was removed 
over a 3- to 4-hour haemodialysis session. Prolonged haemodialysis may be considered if clinically 
appropriate. It is not known if sitagliptin is dialysable by peritoneal dialysis.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, ATC 
code: A10BH01. 
Mechanism of action 
Sitagliptin is a member of a class of oral anti-hyperglycaemic agents called dipeptidyl peptidase 4 
(DPP-4) inhibitors. The improvement in glycaemic control observed with this medicinal product may 
be mediated by enhancing the levels of active incretin hormones. Incretin hormones, including 
glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released 
by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. The incretins are 
part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When 
blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and 
release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. 
Treatment with GLP-1 or with DPP-4 inhibitors in animal models of type 2 diabetes has been 
demonstrated to improve beta cell responsiveness to glucose and stimulate insulin biosynthesis and 
release. With higher insulin levels, tissue glucose uptake is enhanced. In addition, GLP-1 lowers 
glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells. Decreased glucagon concentrations, along with higher 
insulin levels, lead to reduced hepatic glucose production, resulting in a decrease in blood glucose 
levels. The effects of GLP-1 and GIP are glucose-dependent such that when blood glucose 
concentrations are low, stimulation of insulin release and suppression of glucagon secretion by GLP-1 
are not observed. For both GLP-1 and GIP, stimulation of insulin release is enhanced as glucose rises 
above normal concentrations. Further, GLP-1 does not impair the normal glucagon response to 
hypoglycaemia. The activity of GLP-1 and GIP is limited by the DPP-4 enzyme, which rapidly 
hydrolyzes the incretin hormones to produce inactive products. Sitagliptin prevents the hydrolysis of 
incretin hormones by DPP-4, thereby increasing plasma concentrations of the active forms of GLP-1 
and GIP. By enhancing active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases 
glucagon levels in a glucose-dependent manner. In patients with type 2 diabetes with hyperglycaemia, 
these changes in insulin and glucagon levels lead to lower haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and lower fasting 
and postprandial glucose concentrations. The glucose-dependent mechanism of sitagliptin is distinct 
from the mechanism of sulphonylureas, which increase insulin secretion even when glucose levels are 
low and can lead to hypoglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes and in normal subjects. Sitagliptin 
is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of the enzyme DPP-4 and does not inhibit the closely-related 
enzymes DPP-8 or DPP-9 at therapeutic concentrations. 
In a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations, 
whereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents. 
Co-administration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP-1 concentrations. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Overall, sitagliptin improved glycaemic control when used as monotherapy or in combination 
treatment in adult patients with type 2 diabetes (see Table 2). 
Two studies were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin monotherapy. Treatment 
with sitagliptin at 100 mg once daily as monotherapy provided significant improvements in HbA1c, 
fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and 2-hour post-prandial glucose (2-hour PPG), compared to placebo in 
two studies, one of 18- and one of 24-weeks duration. Improvement of surrogate markers of beta cell 
function, including HOMA-β (Homeostasis Model Assessment-β), proinsulin to insulin ratio, and 
measures of beta cell responsiveness from the frequently-sampled meal tolerance test were observed. 
The observed incidence of hypoglycaemia in patients treated with sitagliptin was similar to placebo. 
Body weight did not increase from baseline with sitagliptin therapy in either study, compared to a 
small reduction in patients given placebo. 
Sitagliptin 100 mg once daily provided significant improvements in glycaemic parameters compared 
with placebo in two 24-week studies of sitagliptin as add-on therapy, one in combination with 
metformin and one in combination with pioglitazone. Change from baseline in body weight was 
similar for patients treated with sitagliptin relative to placebo. In these studies there was a similar 
incidence of hypoglycaemia reported for patients treated with sitagliptin or placebo. 
A 24-week placebo-controlled study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin 
(100 mg once daily) added to glimepiride alone or glimepiride in combination with metformin. The 
addition of sitagliptin to either glimepiride alone or to glimepiride and metformin provided significant 
improvements in glycaemic parameters. Patients treated with sitagliptin had a modest increase in body 
weight compared to those given placebo. 
A 26-week placebo-controlled study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin 
(100 mg once daily) added to the combination of pioglitazone and metformin. The addition of 
sitagliptin to pioglitazone and metformin provided significant improvements in glycaemic parameters. 
Change from baseline in body weight was similar for patients treated with sitagliptin relative to 
placebo. The incidence of hypoglycaemia was also similar in patients treated with sitagliptin or 
placebo. 
A 24-week placebo-controlled study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin 
(100 mg once daily) added to insulin (at a stable dose for at least 10 weeks) with or without metformin 
(at least 1 500 mg). In patients taking pre-mixed insulin, the mean daily dose was 70.9 U/day. In 
patients taking non-pre-mixed (intermediate/long-acting) insulin, the mean daily dose was 44.3 U/day. 
The addition of sitagliptin to insulin provided significant improvements in glycaemic parameters. 
There was no meaningful change from baseline in body weight in either group. 
In a 24-week placebo-controlled factorial study of initial therapy, sitagliptin 50 mg twice daily in 
combination with metformin (500 mg or 1 000 mg twice daily) provided significant improvements in 
glycaemic parameters compared with either monotherapy. The decrease in body weight with the 
combination of sitagliptin and metformin was similar to that observed with metformin alone or 
placebo; there was no change from baseline for patients on sitagliptin alone. The incidence of 
hypoglycaemia was similar across treatment groups.

¶ Least squares mean adjusted for metformin use at Visit 1 (yes/no), insulin use at Visit 1 (pre-mixed vs. non-pre-mixed

significant (p > 0.10). 
A 24-week active (metformin)-controlled study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
sitagliptin 100 mg once daily (N=528) compared to metformin (N=522) in patients with inadequate 
glycaemic control on diet and exercise and who were not on anti-hyperglycaemic therapy (off therapy 
for at least 4 months). The mean dose of metformin was approximately 1 900 mg per day. The 
reduction in HbA1c from mean baseline values of 7.2 % was -0.43 % for sitagliptin and -0.57 % for 
metformin (Per Protocol Analysis). The overall incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions 
considered as medicinal product-related in patients treated with sitagliptin was 2.7 % compared with 
12.6 % in patients treated with metformin. The incidence of hypoglycaemia was not significantly 
different between the treatment groups (sitagliptin, 1.3 %; metformin, 1.9 %). Body weight decreased 
from baseline in both groups (sitagliptin, -0.6 kg; metformin -1.9 kg). 
In a study comparing the efficacy and safety of the addition of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily or 
11 
 
 
 
glipizide (a sulphonylurea) in patients with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin monotherapy, 
sitagliptin was similar to glipizide in reducing HbA1c. The mean glipizide dose used in the comparator 
group was 10 mg per day with approximately 40 % of patients requiring a glipizide dose 
of ≤ 5 mg/day throughout the study. However, more patients in the sitagliptin group discontinued due 
to lack of efficacy than in the glipizide group. Patients treated with sitagliptin exhibited a significant 
mean decrease from baseline in body weight compared to a significant weight gain in patients 
administered glipizide (-1.5 vs. +1.1 kg). In this study, the proinsulin to insulin ratio, a marker of 
efficiency of insulin synthesis and release, improved with sitagliptin and deteriorated with glipizide 
treatment. The incidence of hypoglycaemia in the sitagliptin group (4.9 %) was significantly lower 
than that in the glipizide group (32 %). 
A 24-week placebo-controlled study involving 660 patients was designed to evaluate the insulin-
sparing efficacy and safety of sitagliptin (100 mg once daily) added to insulin glargine with or without 
metformin (at least 1 500 mg) during intensification of insulin therapy. Baseline HbA1c was 8.74 % 
and baseline insulin dose was 37 IU/day. Patients were instructed to titrate their insulin glargine dose 
based on fingerstick fasting glucose values. At Week 24, the increase in daily insulin dose was 
19 IU/day in patients treated with sitagliptin and 24 IU/day in patients treated with placebo. The 
reduction in HbA1c in patients treated with sitagliptin and insulin (with or without metformin) was -
1.31 % compared to -0.87 % in patients treated with placebo and insulin (with or without metformin), 
a difference of -0.45 % [95 % CI: -0.60, -0.29]. The incidence of hypoglycaemia was 25.2 % in 
patients treated with sitagliptin and insulin (with or without metformin) and 36.8 % in patients treated 
with placebo and insulin (with or without metformin). The difference was mainly due to a higher 
percentage of patients in the placebo group experiencing 3 or more episodes of hypoglycaemia (9.4 vs. 
19.1 %). There was no difference in the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia. 
A study comparing sitagliptin at 25 or 50 mg once daily to glipizide at 2.5 to 20 mg/day was 
conducted in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. This study involved 423 patients with 
chronic renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 50 mL/min). After 54 weeks, the 
mean reduction from baseline in HbA1c was -0.76 % with sitagliptin and -0.64 % with glipizide (per-
protocol analysis). In this study, the efficacy and safety profile of sitagliptin at 25 or 50 mg once daily 
was generally similar to that observed in other monotherapy studies in patients with normal renal 
function. The incidence of hypoglycaemia in the sitagliptin group (6.2 %) was significantly lower than 
that in the glipizide group (17 %). There was also a significant difference between groups with respect 
to change from baseline body weight (sitagliptin -0.6 kg; glipizide +1.2 kg). 
Another study comparing sitagliptin at 25 mg once daily to glipizide at 2.5 to 20 mg/day was 
conducted in 129 patients with ESRD who were on dialysis. After 54 weeks, the mean reduction from 
baseline in HbA1c was -0.72 % with sitagliptin and -0.87 % with glipizide. In this study, the efficacy 
and safety profile of sitagliptin at 25 mg once daily was generally similar to that observed in other 
monotherapy studies in patients with normal renal function. The incidence of hypoglycaemia was not 
significantly different between the treatment groups (sitagliptin, 6.3 %; glipizide, 10.8 %). 
In another study involving 91 patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance < 50 mL/min), the safety and tolerability of treatment with sitagliptin at 25 or 50 mg once 
daily were generally similar to placebo. In addition, after 12 weeks, the mean reductions in HbA1c 
(sitagliptin -0.59 %; placebo -0.18 %) and FPG (sitagliptin -25.5 mg/dL; placebo -3 mg/dL) were 
generally similar to those observed in other monotherapy studies in patients with normal renal function 
(see section 5.2). 
The TECOS was a randomised study in 14 671 patients in the intention-to-treat population with an 
HbA1c of ≥ 6.5 to 8 % with established CV disease who received sitagliptin (7 332) 100 mg daily (or 
50 mg daily if the baseline eGFR was ≥ 30 and < 50 mL/min/1.73 m2) or placebo (7 339) added to 
usual care targeting regional standards for HbA1c and CV risk factors. Patients with an eGFR 
< 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 were not to be enrolled in the study. The study population included 2 004 
patients ≥ 75 years of age and 3 324 patients with renal impairment (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2). 
Over the course of the study, the overall estimated mean (SD) difference in HbA1c between the 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
sitagliptin and placebo groups was 0.29 % (0.01), 95 % CI (-0.32, -0.27); p < 0.001. 
The primary cardiovascular endpoint was a composite of the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, 
nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalisation for unstable angina. Secondary 
cardiovascular endpoints included the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial 
infarction, or nonfatal stroke; first occurrence of the individual components of the primary composite; 
all-cause mortality; and hospital admissions for congestive heart failure. 
After a median follow up of 3 years, sitagliptin, when added to usual care, did not increase the risk of 
major adverse cardiovascular events or the risk of hospitalisation for heart failure compared to usual 
care without sitagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes (Table 3).

hyperglycaemic therapy for at least 12 weeks (with HbA1c 6.5% to 10%) or were on a stable dose of 
insulin for at least 12 weeks (with HbA1c 7% to 10%). Patients were randomised to sitagliptin 100 mg 
once daily or placebo for 20 weeks. 
Mean baseline HbA1c was 7.5%. Treatment with sitagliptin 100 mg did not provide significant 
improvement in HbA1c at 20 weeks. The reduction in HbA1c in patients treated with sitagliptin 
(N=95) was 0 % compared to 0.2% in patients treated with placebo (N=95), a difference of -0.2% 
(95% CI: -0.7, 0.3). See section 4.2. 
5.2 
Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following oral administration of a 100-mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed, 
with peak plasma concentrations (median Tmax) occurring 1 to 4 hours post-dose, mean plasma AUC 
of sitagliptin was 8.52 µM•hr, Cmax was 950 nM. The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is 
approximately 87 %. Since co-administration of a high-fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the 
pharmacokinetics, sitagliptin may be administered with or without food. 
Plasma  AUC  of  sitagliptin  increased  in  a  dose-proportional  manner.  Dose-proportionality  was  not 
established  for  Cmax  and  C24hr  (Cmax  increased  in  a  greater  than  dose-proportional  manner  and C24hr 
increased in a less than dose-proportional manner). 
Distribution 
The mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100-mg intravenous dose of 
sitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 litres. The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound 
to plasma proteins is low (38 %). 
Biotransformation 
Sitagliptin is primarily eliminated unchanged in urine, and metabolism is a minor pathway. 
Approximately 79 % of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine. 
Following a [14C]sitagliptin oral dose, approximately 16 % of the radioactivity was excreted as 
metabolites of sitagliptin. Six metabolites were detected at trace levels and are not expected to 
contribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of sitagliptin. In vitro studies indicated that the 
primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin was CYP3A4, with contribution 
from CYP2C8. 
In vitro data showed that sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP isozymes CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 1A2, 
2C19 or 2B6, and is not an inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2. 
Elimination 
Following administration of an oral [14C]sitagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 100 % of 
the administered radioactivity was eliminated in faeces (13 %) or urine (87 %) within one week of 
dosing. The apparent terminal t1/2 following a 100-mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately 12.4 
hours. Sitagliptin accumulates only minimally with multiple doses. The renal clearance was 
approximately 350 mL/min. 
Elimination of sitagliptin occurs primarily via renal excretion and involves active tubular secretion. 
Sitagliptin is a substrate for human organic anion transporter-3 (hOAT-3), which may be involved in 
the renal elimination of sitagliptin. The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 in sitagliptin transport has not 
been established. Sitagliptin is also a substrate of p-glycoprotein, which may also be involved in 
mediating the renal elimination of sitagliptin. However, ciclosporin, a p-glycoprotein inhibitor, did not 
reduce the renal clearance of sitagliptin. Sitagliptin is not a substrate for OCT2 or OAT1 or PEPT1/2 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
transporters. In vitro, sitagliptin did not inhibit OAT3 (IC50=160 µM) or p-glycoprotein (up to 
250 µM) mediated transport at therapeutically relevant plasma concentrations. In a clinical study 
sitagliptin had a small effect on plasma digoxin concentrations indicating that sitagliptin may be a 
mild inhibitor of p-glycoprotein. 
Characteristics in patients 
The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin were generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 
2 diabetes. 
Renal impairment 
A single-dose, open-label study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of a reduced dose of 
sitagliptin (50 mg) in patients with varying degrees of chronic renal impairment compared to normal 
healthy control subjects. The study included patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal 
impairment, as well as patients with ESRD on haemodialysis. In addition, the effects of renal 
impairment on sitagliptin pharmacokinetics in patients with type 2 diabetes and mild, moderate, or 
severe renal impairment (including ESRD) were assessed using population pharmacokinetic analyses. 
Compared to normal healthy control subjects, plasma AUC of sitagliptin was increased by 
approximately 1.2-fold and 1.6-fold in patients with mild renal impairment (GFR ≥ 60 to 
< 90 mL/min) and patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR ≥ 45 to < 60 mL/min), respectively. 
Because increases of this magnitude are not clinically relevant, dose adjustment in these patients is not 
necessary. 
Plasma AUC of sitagliptin was increased approximately 2-fold in patients with moderate renal 
impairment (GFR ≥ 30 to < 45 mL/min), and approximately 4-fold in patients with severe renal 
impairment (GFR < 30 mL/min), including in patients with ESRD on haemodialysis. Sitagliptin was 
modestly removed by haemodialysis (13.5 % over a 3- to 4-hour haemodialysis session starting 4 
hours postdose). To achieve plasma concentrations of sitagliptin similar to those in patients with 
normal renal function, lower doses are recommended in patients with GFR < 45 mL/min (see section 
4.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment for sitagliptin is necessary for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh score ≤ 9). There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh score > 9). However, because sitagliptin is primarily renally eliminated, severe hepatic 
impairment is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required based on age. Age did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the 
pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of phase I and phase II 
data. Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had approximately 19 % higher plasma concentrations of 
sitagliptin compared to younger subjects. 
Paediatric population 
The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin (single dose of 50 mg, 100 mg or 200 mg) were investigated in 
paediatric patients (10 to 17 years of age) with type 2 diabetes. In this population, the dose-adjusted 
AUC of sitagliptin in plasma was approximately 18 % lower compared to adult patients with type 2 
diabetes for a 100 mg dose. This is not considered to be a clinically meaningful difference compared 
to adult patients based on the flat PK/PD relationship between the dose of 50 mg and 100 mg. No 
studies with sitagliptin have been performed in paediatric patients with age <10 years. 
Other patient characteristics 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender, race, or body mass index (BMI). These 
characteristics had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a 
composite analysis of Phase I pharmacokinetic data and on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of 
phase I and phase II data. 
5.3 
Preclinical safety data 
Renal and liver toxicity were observed in rodents at systemic exposure values 58 times the human 
exposure level, while the no-effect level was found at 19 times the human exposure level. Incisor teeth 
abnormalities were observed in rats at exposure levels 67 times the clinical exposure level; the no-
effect level for this finding was 58-fold based on the 14-week rat study. The relevance of these 
findings for humans is unknown. Transient treatment-related physical signs, some of which suggest 
neural toxicity, such as open-mouth breathing, salivation, white foamy emesis, ataxia, trembling, 
decreased activity, and/or hunched posture were observed in dogs at exposure levels approximately 23 
times the clinical exposure level. In addition, very slight to slight skeletal muscle degeneration was 
also observed histologically at doses resulting in systemic exposure levels of approximately 23 times 
the human exposure level. A no-effect level for these findings was found at an exposure 6-fold the 
clinical exposure level. 
Sitagliptin has not been demonstrated to be genotoxic in preclinical studies. Sitagliptin was not 
carcinogenic in mice. In rats, there was an increased incidence of hepatic adenomas and carcinomas at 
systemic exposure levels 58 times the human exposure level. Since hepatotoxicity has been shown to 
correlate with induction of hepatic neoplasia in rats, this increased incidence of hepatic tumours in rats 
was likely secondary to chronic hepatic toxicity at this high dose. Because of the high safety margin 
(19-fold at this no-effect level), these neoplastic changes are not considered relevant for the situation 
in humans. 
No adverse effects upon fertility were observed in male and female rats given sitagliptin prior to and 
throughout mating. 
In a pre-/postnatal development study performed in rats sitagliptin showed no adverse effects. 
Reproductive toxicity studies showed a slight treatment-related increased incidence of foetal rib 
malformations (absent, hypoplastic and wavy ribs) in the offspring of rats at systemic exposure levels 
more than 29 times the human exposure levels. Maternal toxicity was seen in rabbits at more than 29 
times the human exposure levels. Because of the high safety margins, these findings do not suggest a 
relevant risk for human reproduction. Sitagliptin is secreted in considerable amounts into the milk of 
lactating rats (milk/plasma ratio: 4:1).

Contents of the pack and other information 
1. 
What Sitagliptin SUN is and what it is used for 
Sitagliptin SUN contains the active substance sitagliptin which is a member of a class of medicines 
called DPP-4 inhibitors (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors) that lowers blood sugar levels in adult 
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
This medicine helps to increase the levels of insulin produced after a meal and decreases the amount of 
sugar made by the body. 
Your doctor has prescribed this medicine to help lower your blood sugar, which is too high because of 
your type 2 diabetes. This medicine can be used alone or in combination with certain other medicines 
(insulin, metformin, sulphonylureas, or glitazones) that lower blood sugar, which you may already be 
taking for your diabetes together with a food and exercise plan. 
What is type 2 diabetes? 
Type 2 diabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin, and the insulin that 
your body produces does not work as well as it should. Your body can also make too much sugar. 
When this happens, sugar (glucose) builds up in the blood. This can lead to serious medical problems 
like heart disease, kidney disease, blindness, and amputation. 
2. 
What you need to know before you take Sitagliptin SUN  
Do not take Sitagliptin SUN 
- 
if you are allergic to sitagliptin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 
6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Cases of inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) have been reported in patients receiving 
sitagliptin (see section 4). 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you encounter blistering of the skin it may be a sign for a condition called bullous pemphigoid. 
Your doctor may ask you to stop Sitagliptin SUN. 
Tell your doctor if you have or have had: 
- 
- 
a disease of the pancreas (such as pancreatitis) 
gallstones, alcohol dependence or very high levels of triglycerides (a form of fat) in your blood. 
These medical conditions can increase your chance of getting pancreatitis (see section 4). 
type 1 diabetes 
diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes with high blood sugar, rapid weight loss, 
nausea or vomiting) 
any past or present kidney problems 
an allergic reaction to sitagliptin (see section 4) 
- 
- 
- 
- 
This medicine is unlikely to cause low blood sugar because it does not work when your blood sugar is 
low. However, when this medicine is used in combination with a sulphonylurea medicine or with 
insulin, low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) can occur. Your doctor may reduce the dose of your 
sulphonylurea or insulin medicine. 
Children and adolescents 
Children and adolescents below 18 years should not use this medicine. It is not effective in children 
and adolescents between the ages of 10 and 17 years. It is not known if this medicine is safe and 
effective when used in children younger than 10 years. 
Other medicines and Sitagliptin SUN 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
In particular, tell your doctor if you are taking digoxin (a medicine used to treat irregular heartbeat and 
other heart problems). The level of digoxin in your blood may need to be checked if taking with 
sitagliptin. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
You should not take this medicine during pregnancy. 
It is not known if this medicine passes into breast milk. You should not take this medicine if you are 
breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed. 
Driving and using machines 
This medicine has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, 
dizziness and drowsiness have been reported, which may affect your ability to drive or use machines. 
Taking this medicine in combination with medicines called sulphonylureas or with insulin can cause 
hypoglycaemia, which may affect your ability to drive and use machines or work without safe 
foothold. 
Sitagliptin SUN contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
Sitagliptin SUN contains hydrogenated castor oil

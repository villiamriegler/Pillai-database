2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory condition that causes neuro-axonal 
injury in the Central Nervous System (CNS) leading to permanent and severe neurological impairment 
and  disability.  The  most  common  onset  MS  form  (relapsing-remitting  MS,  RRMS)  is  characterised  by 
acute episodes of neurological dysfunction named relapses followed by variable recovery and periods of 
clinical  stability.  There  are  different  authorised  disease  modifying  therapies  (DMT)  for  patients  with 
RRMS. 
More than 50% of patients who suffer from a RRMS will within a median time of 15 to 20 years from 
onset, develop a secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) characterized by sustained disability 
with or without superimposed relapses.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
MS is the most common cause of serious neurological disability in young adults. It is estimated that 
more than 2.3 million people are affected by MS worldwide. The prevalence of MS is highest in North 
America and Europe (140 and 108 per 100,000 respectively) and lowest in sub-Saharan Africa and 
East Asia at 2.1 and 2.2 per 100,000, respectively. MS typically starts between 20 to 40 years of age. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/11848/2022  
Page 5/29 
 
 
 
 
Overall, women are affected approximately twice as often as men, except in individuals with the 
primary-progressive MS (PPMS), where there is no gender prevalence difference. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
While the exact cause of MS is unknown, it is assumed that MS is mediated by an autoimmune process 
triggered by an infection or other environmental factors, superimposed on a genetic predisposition. The 
major contributors to this process are macrophages and microglia from the innate immune system, 
and T and B lymphocytes from the adaptive immune system. From the peripheral immune system, 
autoreactive T-helper cells are primed and stimulated to infiltrate the CNS where they target myelin 
antigens. Inflammation of the white and grey matter tissues in the CNS due to focal immune cell 
infiltration and release of cytokines are the incipient cause of tissue damage in MS not only to the 
myelin sheath but also to the underlying axons. This process happens over time and results in 
repeated attacks (clinically eloquent or not). During the acute phase, demyelination and inflammation 
impair or interrupts nerve transmission, giving rise to clinical signs and symptoms. Relapses are 
considered the clinical expression of acute inflammatory focal lesions. Afterwards, remaining 
permanent symptoms (sequelae) are due to permanent neuro-axonal loss or permanent injured and 
demyelinated neurons. Elements from both adaptive (B and T cells) and innate (monocytes, natural 
killer cells and dendritic cells) immune systems all are involved in any stage of MS. During the RRMS 
phase, the accumulation of disability (disability worsening or progression) is mostly due to lack of 
complete recovery of focal inflammatory lesions. In the SPMP phase, accumulation of disability is 
explained by the conjunction of pathological mechanisms including focal inflammatory activity 
(particularly relevant in SPMS with relapses and acute lesions) and failure of biological compensation of 
the CNS damage (impaired remyelination and lack of biological redundancy). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
The most commonly onset MS phenotype (85% of patients) is RRMS clinically characterized by 
relapses. Nearly half of the RRMS patients will develop within 20 years a SPMS clinically characterized 
by disability worsening. There are no clear criteria that mark the transition from RRMS to SPMS. The 
transition is determined retrospectively based on evidence that disability progression had occurred 
independently of relapses, though relapses and focal inflammatory activity may continue to be present. 
In fact, the SPMS is a heterogeneous population including patients with relapses (usually with a 
prominent development of T2-weighted-Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (T2-FLAIR) lesions) and 
other patients without relapses. The term "relapsing MS" (RMS) applies to those affected patients 
either with a RRMS or SPMS with superimposed relapses. The pathological mechanism underlying 
relapses and typical radiological T2-FLAIR lesions is acute focal inflammatory activity. Regardless of 
other potential pathological mechanisms, lack of complete recovery from focal inflammatory lesion 
causes accumulation of disability. Therefore, patients with relapsing MS, despite suffering from 
different MS forms, constitute a common target for current treatment options. Clinical manifestations 
in RRMS may depend on affected CNS regions. In SPMS, accumulated CNS damage is usually 
presented as reduced ambulation and cognitive impairment, bulbar dysfunction, visual impairment, 
impaired arm function, fatigue, pain and depression and sphincter control issues. 
2.1.5.  Management 
The standard of care for acute relapses is methylprednisolone i.v. Methylprednisolone shortens the 
duration of a relapse but has no influence on its sequelae. Plasmapheresis may improve recovery from 
relapse in steroid-resistant cases, but this is rarely used. Disease-modifying therapies (DMT) aim to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/11848/2022  
Page 6/29 
 
 
 
modify the course of the disease by suppressing or modulating the immune responses involved in MS 
pathogenesis. Biologicals (therapeutic proteins, monoclonal antibodies) and small molecules have been 
approved for use in this therapeutic context. DMTs aim to prevent relapses and ultimately intend to 
decrease the rate of accumulation of disability. Due to the risks (identified or potential) of opportunistic 
infections, malignancies, and other systemic adverse drug reactions, several of these treatment 
options are considered as second-line options i.e. treatment is restricted to patients with rapidly 
evolving multiple sclerosis or those who had a suboptimal response to prior therapies. Currently 12 
DMTs are available (country/regional differences exist) for the treatment of MS (interferon beta-1a and 
interferon beta-1b, peginterferon beta-1a, glatiramer acetate, fingolimod, natalizumab, teriflunomide, 
dimethyl fumarate, alemtuzumab, ocrelizumab, cladribine, and mitoxantrone). Most are approved for 
RRMS or relapsing forms of MS (RMS, defined as RRMS and SPMS with relapses). Products for both 
RRMS and RMS were approved based on treatment effect on relapses, MRI lesion activity, and, some 
for the delay in disability worsening. Interferon beta (IFNB)-1b is approved in the EU for patients with 
SPMS with active disease as evidenced by relapses. The two trials in SPMS presented as efficacy data 
for marketing authorization showed a consistent 30% reduction in frequency of relapses and 
inconsistent results for the primary endpoint “time to confirmed progression” (31% reduction in time to 
disability progression in one trial and no significant delay in the other trial including patients with 
overall less active disease than in the other study). 
2.2.  About the product 
Siponimod is a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator that selectively targets S1P 
receptor subtypes 1 and 5. By acting as a functional antagonist on S1P1 receptors on lymphocytes, 
siponimod prevents egress from lymph nodes. This reduces the recirculation of T cells into the central 
nervous system (CNS) to limit central inflammation.  
The EU Mayzent initial Marketing Authorization Application was granted in January 2020 for the 
treatment of adult patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) with active disease 
evidenced by relapses or imaging features of inflammatory activity.  
Mayzent is currently authorised as a 0.25 and 2 mg film-coated tablets. The purpose of this Line 
Extension Application is to register the new strength of Mayzent 1 mg film-coated tablets. 
The approved maintenance dose for siponimod is 1 mg or 2 mg once daily after initial dose titration 
depending on the patient CYP2C9 genotype. Currently, the patients with a CYP2C9*2*3 or *1*3 
genotype achieve the recommended 1mg maintenance dosage by taking four tablets of 0.25 mg. The 
proposed 1 mg tablet is therefore being introduced as a convenience for these patients. 
2.3.  Quality aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets containing 1 mg of siponimod as active 
substance. The active substance contains siponimod as a fumaric acid co-crystal. This line extension 
application introduces a new 1 mg strength as a convenience to patients whose recommended dose is 
1 mg, currently taken as four 0.25 mg tablets. 
Other ingredients are:  
Tablet core: lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, crospovidone, glycerol dibehenate and 
colloidal anhydrous silica;  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/11848/2022  
Page 7/29 
 
 
 
Tablet coating: polyvinyl alcohol, titanium dioxide (E171), red iron oxide (E172), black iron oxide 
(E172), talc, soya lecithin and xanthan gum.  
The product is available in PA/alu/PVC/alu blisters as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.3.2.  Active Substance 
The proposed new 1 mg film-coated tablet is manufactured using the same active substance 
(siponimod fumaric acid) manufactured by the same manufacturers and process as used in the 
approved 0.25 and 2 mg tablets. The information presented by the applicant in the dossier was already 
assessed in the original submission and there have been no subsequent changes. 
2.3.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as violet white, round, biconvex, bevelled-edged film-coated tablets 
of approximately 6.1 mm diameter with company logo on one side and “L” on the other side. The 
tablets are distinguished from the other marketed strengths by colour (0.25 mg: pale red; 2 mg: pale 
yellow) and debossing. The weight of core and coated tablets is identical, irrespective of strength. The 
composition of the 1 mg strength is the same as for the other strengths except for the amount of 
lactose monohydrate, which is adjusted to account for the different amount of active substance, and 
the film-coating which has a different colour. 
Siponimod fumaric acid is a BCS class II compound with good absorption characteristics but practically 
insoluble in aqueous media, although solubility increases slightly at low pH or above pH 6.8. Limits for 
the particle size distribution have been set in the active substance in line with phase III clinical batches 
and afford sufficiently stable active substance. 
The development of the 1 mg strength was based on the well-established formulation and robust 
manufacturing process of the approved 0.25 mg and 2 mg strengths. 
The excipients are well-known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards where appropriate. Suitable specifications have been provided for the non-pharmacopoeial 
film-coating pre-mixes. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list 
of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.3.1 of this report. 
In vitro dissolution profiling was conducted to support the use of 1 x 1 mg tablet in place of 4 x 
0.25 mg tablets. The data provided demonstrates that patients can switch between 4 x 0.25 mg 
tablets and a single 1 mg tablet. 
The QC dissolution method for 1 mg is the same as approved for 0.25 mg and 2 mg. Suitable limits 
have been included in the specification. 
The manufacturing process of the 1 mg strength is the same as approved for 0.25 mg and 2 mg and 
consists of combining the active substance and excipients, tableting and film-coating steps. The 
development data provided is considered sufficient.  
The primary packaging is PA/alu/PVC/alu blisters as for the already approved strengths of 0.25 mg and 
2 mg. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure 
system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of 4 main steps: sequential blending of solid ingredients, tabletting, 
film-coating and packaging. The process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process due 
to the low active substance content. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated on three consecutive commercial scale 
batches according to the process description. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing 
process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The 
in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. The 
critical steps have been defined and suitable controls are applied.  
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form including 
appearance,  mean  mass,  identity,  water  content,  dissolution,  uniformity  of  dosage  units,  assay, 
degradation products and microbial enumeration. 
Limits for impurities and degradation products have been set according to ICH Q3B and are acceptable. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed using a risk-
based  approach  in  line  with  the  ICH  Q3D  Guideline  for  Elemental  Impurities.  The  risk  from  different 
potential  sources  was  considered  and  deemed  to  be  negligible.  Testing  of  finished  product  batches 
indicated that all elemental impurities were well below the relevant thresholds and thus, no additional 
controls are required.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented.  
Batch analysis results were provided for three commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of 
the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. The 
finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three production scale batches of the 1 mg tablets were generated according to the 
ICH guidelines. Samples were stored under a series of conditions and for variable durations: at 
either -20 °C or 40 °C/75% RH for up to 6 months; at 5 °C, 25 °C/60% RH, 30 °C/65% RH and 
30 °C/75% RH for up to 24 months. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed 
for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. Samples were tested 
for appearance, dissolution, assay, degradation products, loss on drying and microbial enumeration. 
The analytical procedures used are stability indicating.  
Under refrigerated conditions, no significant changes were observed for any of the measured 
parameters. At 25 °C, a small increase in degradation products and drop in assay was observed. The 
amount of degradation was greater at higher temperatures and humidities. It was deemed that a small 
increase in degradation and reduction in assay was acceptable to allow patients to store tablets in a 
more conventional fashion, i.e. at ambient temperature rather than in the refrigerator. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. The finished product was not found to be photosensitive. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/11848/2022  
Page 9/29 
 
 
 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years stored not above 25 °C as stated in 
the SmPC (section 6.3 and 6.4) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as 
those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the 
use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the 
Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal 
products. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the 1 mg tablets should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.3.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.4.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data was submitted which was considered acceptable to the CHMP. 
2.5.  Clinical aspects 
No new clinical data was submitted which was considered acceptable to the CHMP.

Potential long-term safety implications in CYP2C9 poor metabolisers: 
• 
Perform genotyping for CYP2C9 before treatment initiation to determine the siponimod 
maintenance dose. Test requires a DNA sample obtained via blood or saliva (buccal swab). 
The test identifies two variant alleles for CYP2C9: CYP2C9*2 (rs1799853, c.430C>T) and 
CYP2C9*3 (rs1057910, c.1075A>C). Both are single nucleotide polymorphisms. This 
genotyping can be done using a Sanger sequencing method or PCR-based assay methods. 
For further clarifications please refer to your local laboratory. 
Do not prescribe siponimod in patients homozygous for CYP2C9*3*3. 
Adjust the maintenance dose to 1 mg in patients with CYP2C9*2*3 or *1*3 genotypes. 
Bradyarrhythmia (including conduction defects) during treatment initiation: 
• 
Initiate treatment with a titration pack that lasts for 5 days. Start treatment with 0.25 mg 
on day 1, up-titrated to the maintenance dose of 2 mg or 1 mg on day 6 based on the 
CYP2C9 metaboliser status. 
If a titration dose is missed on one day during the first 6 days of treatment, treatment 
must be re-initiated with a new titration pack. 
If the maintenance dose is interrupted for 4 or more consecutive daily doses, treatment 
must be re-initiated with a new titration pack. 
Monitoring requirements at treatment initiation: 
Prior to initiating treatment: 
o 
Perform vitals and baseline ECG prior to the first dose of siponimod in patients with 
sinus bradycardia (heart rate [HR] <55 bpm), history of first- or second-degree 
[Mobitz type I] AV block, or a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure 
(patients with NYHA class I and II). 
Until 6 hours after first dose: 
o 
Observe patients with sinus bradycardia (heart rate <55 bpm), history of first- or 
second-degree [Mobitz type I] AV block or a history of myocardial infarction or heart 
failure (patients with NYHA class I and II) for a period of 6 hours after the first dose 
of siponimod for signs and symptoms of bradycardia and obtain an ECG at the end 
of the 6-hour monitoring period. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/11848/2022  
Page 24/29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
o 
If necessary, the decrease in heart rate induced by siponimod can be reversed by 
parenteral doses of atropine or isoprenaline. 
Extended observation (>6 hours after first dose): 
o 
o 
o 
If, at the 6-hour time point, the heart rate is at the lowest value following the first 
dose, extend heart rate monitoring for at least 2 more hours and until the heart rate 
increases again. 
Extend heart rate monitoring for at least overnight in a medical facility and until 
resolution of findings in patients requiring pharmacological intervention during 
monitoring at treatment initiation/re-initiation. Repeat the first-dose monitoring 
after the second dose of siponimod. 
Appropriate management should be initiated and observation continued until the 
symptoms/findings have resolved if the following events are observed: 
a. 
b.  Where at the 6-hour time point the ECG shows: New onset second-degree or 
New onset third-degree AV block occurring at any time 
• 
• 
higher AV block, or QTc interval ≥500 msec 
If pharmacological treatment is required, monitoring should be continued overnight 
and 6-hour monitoring should be repeated after the second dose. 
Mayzent is contraindicated in: 
• 
• 
Patients who, in the previous 6 months, had a myocardial infarction, unstable 
angina pectoris, stroke/transient ischaemic attack (TIA), decompensated heart 
failure (requiring in-patient treatment), or New York Heart Association (NYHA) 
class III/IV heart failure. 
Patients with a history of second-degree Mobitz type II atrioventricular (AV) block, 
third-degree AV block, sino-atrial heart block or sick sinus syndrome, if they do not 
wear a pacemaker. 
Mayzent is not recommended in: 
• 
Patients with the below conditions. Siponimod treatment should be considered in 
these patients only if the anticipated benefits outweigh the potential risks and a 
cardiologist must be consulted to determine appropriate monitoring. At least 
overnight extended monitoring is recommended. 
o 
o 
o 
o 
o 
o 
QTc prolongation >500 msec 
Severe untreated sleep apnoea 
History of symptomatic bradycardia 
History of recurrent syncope 
Uncontrolled hypertension 
Concomitant treatment with class Ia (e.g. quinidine, procainamide) or 
class III anti-arrhythmic medications, calcium channel blockers (such as 
verapamil, diltiazem) and other medications (e.g. ivabradine or digoxin) which 
are known to decrease the heart rate 
• 
Infections, including varicella zoster reactivation, reactivation of the other viral infections, PML and 
other rare opportunistic infections: 
• 
There is an increased risk of infections including serious infections, in patients treated with 
siponimod. 
Before initiating treatment, a recent complete blood count (CBC) (i.e. within 6 months or 
after discontinuation of prior therapy) should be available. Assessments of CBC are also 
recommended periodically during treatment. 
Before starting siponimod, test for antibodies to varicella zoster virus (VZV) in patients 
without a physician-confirmed history of varicella or without documentation of a full course 
of vaccination against VZV. If tested negative, vaccination is recommended and treatment 
with siponimod should be postponed for 1 month to allow the full effect of vaccination to 
occur. 
Siponimod is contraindicated in patients with immunodeficiency syndrome. 
Siponimod is contraindicated in patients with history of progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy or cryptococcal meningitis.

• 
Do not initiate siponimod treatment in patients with severe active infection until infection 
is resolved. 
Exercise caution when administering concomitant treatment with anti-neoplastic, 
immune-modulating or immunosuppressive therapies (including corticosteroids) due to the 
risk of additive immune system effects. 
Patients should be instructed to report signs and symptoms of infections immediately to 
their prescriber during and for up to one month after treatment with siponimod. 
Monitor patients carefully for signs and symptoms of infections during and after treatment 
with siponimod: 
• 
A case of cryptococcal meningitis (CM) has been reported for siponimod. Prompt 
diagnostic evaluation should be performed in patients with symptoms and signs 
consistent with cryptococcal meningitis; appropriate treatment, if diagnosed, should 
be initiated. Siponimod treatment should be suspended until CM has been excluded. 
Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have been reported with 
another sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator. Physicians should be 
vigilant for clinical symptoms or MRI findings suggestive of PML. If PML is suspected, 
treatment should be suspended until PML has been excluded. 
• 
Macular oedema: 
• 
Arrange an ophthalmological evaluation prior to initiating therapy and follow-up 
evaluations while receiving therapy in patients with a history of diabetes mellitus, uveitis 
or underlying/co-existing retinal disease. 
An ophthalmological evaluation 3-4 months after treatment initiation with siponimod is 
recommended. 
Instruct the patient to report visual disturbances at any time while on siponimod therapy. 
Do not initiate siponimod treatment in patients with macular oedema until resolution. 
Reproductive toxicity: 
• 
Siponimod is contraindicated during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not 
using effective contraception. Advise women of potential serious risks to the foetus if 
siponimod is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking it. 
A negative pregnancy test result is required prior to initiation of treatment in women of 
childbearing potential. 
Women of childbearing potential should be counselled before treatment initiation and 
regularly thereafter about the serious risks of siponimod to the foetus, facilitated by the 
pregnancy-specific patient reminder card. 
Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment and for 
at least 10 days following discontinuation of treatment with siponimod. 
Siponimod should be stopped at least 10 days before a pregnancy is planned. When 
stopping siponimod for planning a pregnancy the possible return of disease activity should 
be considered. 
Counsel the patient in case of inadvertent pregnancy. 
If a woman becomes pregnant while on treatment with siponimod, treatment must be 
discontinued. Pregnant women should be advised of potential serious risks to the foetus, 
and ultrasonography examinations should be performed. 
Should a pregnancy occur during treatment or within 10 days following discontinuation of 
treatment with siponimod, please report it to Novartis by calling [insert local number] or 
visiting [insert URL], irrespective of adverse outcomes observed. 
Novartis has put in place a PRegnancy outcomes Intensive Monitoring (PRIM) programme, 
which is a registry based on enhanced follow-up mechanisms to collect information about 
pregnancy in patients exposed to siponimod immediately before or during pregnancy and 
on infant outcomes 12 months post-delivery.

Other reminders: 
• 
Perform liver function tests prior to initiating siponimod treatment. If patients develop 
symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction during treatment with siponimod, request a 
liver enzymes check. Discontinue treatment if significant liver injury is confirmed. 
Siponimod is contraindicated in patients with severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh class C). 
Be vigilant for skin malignancies while on treatment with siponimod. Perform skin 
examination prior to treatment initiation and then every 6 to 12 months taking into 
consideration clinical judgement. Patients should be referred to a dermatologist if 
suspicious lesions are detected. Caution patients against exposure to sunlight without 
protection. These patients should not receive concomitant phototherapy with UV-B 
radiation or PUVA-photochemotherapy. Siponimod is contraindicated in patients with 
active malignancies. 
Should a patient develop any unexpected neurological or psychiatric symptoms/signs or 
accelerated neurological deterioration, a complete physical and neurological examination 
should promptly be scheduled and MRI should be considered. 
Caution should be exercised in elderly patients with multiple co-morbidities, or advanced 
disease/disability (due to possible increased risks of, for example, infections, 
bradyarrhythmic events during treatment initiation). 
If siponimod is discontinued, the possibility of recurrence of high disease activity should be 
considered. 
Provide patients with the Patient/Caregiver Guide and Pregnancy Reminder Card for 
women of childbearing potential. 
Be familiar with the Mayzent Prescribing Information.

What Mayzent is and how it works. 
What multiple sclerosis is. 
Patients should read the package leaflet thoroughly before starting treatment and should keep 
the package leaflet in case they need to refer to it again during treatment. 
The importance of reporting adverse reactions. 
Before starting treatment, a DNA sample via blood or saliva (buccal swab) is taken to determine 
the CYP2C9 genotype to help determine appropriate dosing of siponimod. In certain cases the 
patient may not receive treatment with siponimod due to specific CYP2C9 genotype status. 
Patients need to have chickenpox vaccination 1 month before starting siponimod treatment, if 
the patient is not protected against the virus. 
Siponimod is not recommended in patients with cardiac disease or taking concomitant medicines 
known to decrease heart rate. Patients should tell any doctor they see that they are being 
treated with siponimod. 
For patients with certain heart problems, an ECG before initiating treatment with siponimod will 
be needed. The need for observation (including an ECG monitoring) for 6 hours in a clinic after 
the first dose of siponimod on day 1, if the patient has heart problems. Information that the 
monitoring may need to extend overnight, if the patient experiences symptoms during the first 
6 hours. 
Patients should report immediately symptoms indicating low heart rate (such as dizziness, 
vertigo, nausea or palpitations) after the first dose of siponimod and during the titration period. 
Before starting treatment patients should provide a recent complete blood count. 
The signs and symptoms of infection during, and up to one month after treatment with 
siponimod need to be reported immediately to the prescriber. 
Patients should report any symptoms of visual impairment immediately to the prescriber during 
and for up to one month after the end of treatment with siponimod.

Patients should call the doctor if a dose is missed during the first 6 days of treatment or for 4 or 
more consecutive days after initiating treatment with siponimod. Treatment needs to be 
reinitiated with a new titration pack. 
Liver function tests should be performed before starting treatment and repeated if there are 
symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction. 
Patients should report any unexpected neurological or psychiatric symptoms/signs (such as 
sudden onset of severe headache, confusion, seizures and vision changes) or accelerated 
neurological deterioration to their doctors. 
Due to the potential teratogenic risk of siponimod women of childbearing potential should: 
• 
Be informed before treatment initiation and regularly thereafter by their physician about 
siponimod serious risks to the foetus and about the contraindication in pregnant women 
and in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception, facilitated by the 
Pregnancy Reminder Card. 
Have a negative pregnancy test before starting siponimod, which should be repeated at 
suitable intervals. 
Be using effective contraception during treatment and for at least 10 days after stopping 
treatment to avoid pregnancy due to the potential risk of harm to the unborn baby. 
Report immediately to the prescribing physician any (intended or unintended) pregnancy, 
during treatment and up to 10 days following discontinuation of siponimod treatment. 
• 
• 
• 
Patients should be informed about the risk of skin malignancies and the need for skin 
examinations at the start of the treatment and regularly in some cases while on treatment with 
siponimod and should be cautioned against exposure to sunlight without protection. Also, these 
patients should not receive concomitant phototherapy with UV-B radiation or 
PUVA-photochemotherapy. Patients should inform their doctor immediately if they notice any 
skin nodules (e.g. shiny, pearly nodules), patches or open sores that do not heal within weeks. 
Symptoms of skin cancer may include abnormal growth or changes of skin tissue (e.g. unusual 
moles) with a change in colour, shape or size over time. 
After stopping treatment with Mayzent, patients should inform their doctor immediately if their 
disease symptoms are getting worse (e.g. weakness or visual changes) or if they notice any new 
symptoms.

• 
• 
Siponimod is contraindicated during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using 
effective contraception. 
Doctors will provide counselling before treatment initiation and regularly thereafter regarding the 
potential teratogenic risk of siponimod and required actions to minimise this risk. 
Patients will be informed by their doctor of the need for effective contraception while on 
treatment and for 10 days after discontinuation. 
A pregnancy test must be carried out and negative results verified by the doctor before starting 
treatment. It must be repeated at suitable intervals. 
Patients must use effective contraception during the treatment with siponimod. 
While on treatment, women must not become pregnant. If a woman becomes pregnant or wants 
to become pregnant, siponimod should be discontinued. Effective contraception should be 
maintained for at least 10 days following discontinuation of treatment with siponimod. 
Doctors will provide counselling in the event of pregnancy and evaluation of the outcome of any 
pregnancy. 
Patients should inform their doctor straight away if there is worsening of multiple sclerosis after 
stopping treatment with siponimod. 
Women exposed to siponimod during pregnancy are encouraged to join the pregnancy exposure 
programme (PRegnancy outcomes Intensive Monitoring, PRIM) that monitors outcomes of 
pregnancy.

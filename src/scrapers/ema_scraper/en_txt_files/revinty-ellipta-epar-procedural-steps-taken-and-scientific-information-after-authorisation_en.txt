1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

interventional post-authorisation safety Category 1 
study to further investigate the risk of pneumonia 
(ANX005). Consequently, Annex II condition of the 
product information is updated. Moreover, an 
updated RMP version 10 is submitted to add 
information from the study, to update the important 
identified risk of pneumonia based on findings from 
the study, and to provide justifications for removal of 
the important potential risk of asthma related 
intubations and deaths and of missing information 
related to long term use in asthma (>1 year).

furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms compared with 
placebo in 16,485 subjects. The primary endpoint was all-
cause mortality and a secondary endpoint was a composite 
of cardiovascular events. 
Prior to randomization, subjects were required to 
discontinue previous COPD medications used at baseline. 
Subjects were then randomized to receive either fluticasone 
furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms, fluticasone furoate 92 
micrograms, vilanterol 22 micrograms, or placebo, and 
treated for a mean of 1.7 years (SD = 0.9 years). Subjects 
had moderate COPD (mean percent post-bronchodilator 
screening FEV1 of 60% [SD = 6%]), and a history of, or an 
increased risk of cardiovascular disease. 
Mortality risk with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol was not 
significantly different compared with placebo (HR 0.88; 
95% CI: 0.74 to 1.04; p=0.137), fluticasone furoate (HR 
0.96; 95% CI: 0.81 to 1.15; p=0.681) or vilanterol (HR 
0.91; 95% CI: 0.77 to 1.09; p=0.299). The risk of the 
cardiovascular composite event with fluticasone 
furoate/vilanterol was not significantly different compared 
with placebo (HR 0.93; 95% CI: 0.75 to 1.14), fluticasone 
furoate (HR 1.03; 95% CI: 0.83 to 1.28) or vilanterol (HR 
0.94; 95% CI: 0.76 to 1.16). 
For more information on the SUMMIT study, please refer to 
the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
In peripheral blood mononuclear cells from subjects with 
COPD, a larger anti-inflammatory effect was seen in the 
presence of the combination of fluticasone 
furoate/vilanterol compared with fluticasone furoate alone 
at concentrations achieved with clinical doses. The

was similar to that obtained with other ICS/LABA 
combinations.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This application for a marketing authorisation for Aripiprazole Sandoz concerns a generic medicinal product of 
the centrally authorised product Abilify, which, at the time of this report, was available as tablets (5mg, 
10mg, 15mg and 30 mg), orodispersible tablets (10mg, 15mg and 30 mg), oral solution (1 mg/ml) and 
solution for injection (7.5 mg/ml).  
This centralised application initially concerned a generic application according to article 10(1) of Directive 
2001/83/EC as amended for Aripiprazole Sandoz 5mg, 10mg, 15mg and 30mg tablets and a hybrid of the 
reference product (Abilify) according to article 10(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended for Aripiprazole 
Sandoz 2mg  and 20mg tablets. The applicant is Sandoz GmbH. The 2mg strength was withdrawn during the 
procedure. 
Aripiprazole is a quinolinone derivative, 7-{4-[4-(2, 3-dichlorophenyl)-1-piperazinyl]butyloxy}-3,4-dihydro- 
2(1H)-quinolinone, which exerts both agonistic and antagonistic activity at dopaminergic and serotonergic 
receptors, along with activities at other receptors. Abilify is approved for treatment of schizophrenia and 
manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder as well as the prevention of manic episodes as follows: 
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and in adolescents aged 15 years and 
older.  
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and 
for the prevention of a new manic episode in adults who experienced predominantly manic episodes 
and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment.  
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment up to 12 weeks of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar 
I Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older. 
The efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is thought to be mediated through a 
combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 
5HT2a receptors. For the treatment of schizophrenia, aripiprazole is given in an initial oral dose of 10 or 15 
mg once daily. The recommended maintenance dose is 15 mg once daily. For the treatment of acute manic 
episodes in bipolar disorder, the recommended initial oral dose is 15 mg once daily as monotherapy, or 
combination therapy. For preventing recurrence of manic episodes, it is recommended to continue therapy at 
the same dose administered for treatment of acute episodes. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 
mg.  
Two bioequivalence studies have been performed using the originator as a reference product.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as tablets containing 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg or 30 mg of aripiprazole 
as active substance.

Other ingredients are: lactose monohydrate, maize starch, microcrystalline cellulose, hydroxypropyl 
cellulose, magnesium stearate in common for all tablets; indigo carmine aluminium lake (E132) for 5 mg 
tablets, red iron oxide (E172) for 10 mg tablets and 30 mg tablets, and yellow iron oxide (E172) for 15 mg 
tablets. 
The product is available in aluminium/aluminium blisters in carton box for all tablets and high density 
polyethylene (HDPE) bottles containing a silica gel desiccant and a polyester coil for 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 
30 mg tablets. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of aripiprazole is 7-{4-[4-(2,3-Dichlorophenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]butoxy}-3,4-
dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one and has the following structure: 
The structure has been confirmed using elemental analysis, mass spectrometry, IR, UV, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR 
spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry. 
Aripiprazole is a white to off-white powder, freely soluble in N, N-dimethylacetamide and tetrahydrofuran, 
slightly soluble in ethanol and methanol, and practically insoluble in water. Solubility in water is slightly 
increasing at lower pH. 
Aripiprazole has a non-chiral molecular structure. Polymorphism has been observed for aripiprazole. Ten 
crystalline solid state forms have been identified based on literature: five polymorphs, a monohydrate, and 
four solvates. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The information on the active substance is provided according to the Active Substance Master File (ASMF) 
procedure. Aripiprazole is obtained from a single manufacturer. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/512637/2015   
Page 9/30 
 
  
  
 
Aripiprazole is synthesized in four main steps using commercially available well-defined starting materials 
with acceptable specifications. During the evaluation procedure, the active substance starting materials were 
redefined to ensure full control of the quality of the active substance in line with ICH Q11. 
Several compounds originating either from starting materials or from the synthesis of aripiprazole have a 
structural alert for genotoxicity and satisfactory data is presented to demonstrate that the manufacturing 
process proposed is capable of removing or purging these compounds to acceptable limits in line with the 
current guidelines. 
Potential and actual impurities were sufficiently discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. 
The active substance is packaged in two high molecular high density polyethylene bags or two antistatic high 
molecular high density polyethylene bags which comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011. 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of 
the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance (visual examination), identity and 
polymorphic form (IR, XRPD), loss on drying, residual solvents (GC), impurities (HPLC and GC), sulfated ash 
(Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), and particle size distribution (laser diffraction). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. 
Batch analysis data on eight commercial scale batches of the active substance were provided. The results 
were within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on three commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored 
in a container closure system representative of that intended for the market for 60 months under long term 
conditions at 30 ºC / 65% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance (visual examination), identity (HPLC, IR, and XRPD), loss 
on drying/ water content (KF), impurities (HPLC), and assay (HPLC). The analytical methods used were the 
same as for release and were stability indicating. During stability testing, the method for water content (KF) 
was replaced with the loss on drying method, in order to align the tests with those published in Ph. Eur. 
monograph for aripiprazole. 
All tested parameters were within the specifications. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/512637/2015   
Page 10/30 
 
  
  
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 60 months in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The aim of pharmaceutical development was to develop a stable tablet formulation that is bioequivalent to 
the reference medicinal product Abilify tablets.  
During pharmaceutical development the solubility of several crystal forms of the active substance was 
studied. The active substance manufacturer consistently produces the single polymorphic form chosen for 
further development. This has been demonstrated using XRPD method suitable for differentiating the 
polymorphic form obtained from other forms reported. In addition, it has been demonstrated that 
polymorphic form does not change during manufacture and shelf-life of the finished medicinal product. 
The active substance particle size effect on dissolution of the tablets was discussed and it has been 
demonstrated that dissolution method can detect changes in particle size distribution of the active substance. 
In order to control this effect, adequate limits for particle size distribution were set in the active substance 
specifications. 
The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated. 
The selection of excipients was primarily based on the composition of the reference medicinal product and the 
results from compatibility studies of the active substance with individual excipients. All excipients are well 
known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards or EU legislation. 
There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in 
section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The formulations of generic Aripiprazole Sandoz tablet strengths (5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg) are 
qualitatively the same as the formulations of equivalent tablet strengths of reference medicinal product 
Abilify. The formulation of hybrid Aripiprazole Sandoz tablet strength (20 mg) is qualitatively identical to 
20 mg Abilify tablets marketed in USA and Canada. In Europe the 20 mg strength is a non-generic strength, 
developed to ease dosing (dose titration) in patients. 
The formulations used during clinical studies are the same as those intended for marketing. 
Two bioequivalence studies were performed showing bioequivalence between the 5 mg and 10 mg tablets 
and the reference product. 
A request for biowaiver of 15 mg, 20 mg and 30 mg tablet strengths was submitted. In order to comply with 
requirements for biowaiver specified in the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence, comprehensive 
dissolution data was provided during the evaluation procedure. Requirements for biowaiver of 15 mg, 20 mg 
and 30 mg tablets were fulfilled. 
Different approaches were tried during finished product manufacturing process development. Fluidized bed 
granulation was chosen as the manufacturing method of the finished product. 
The primary packaging is included in section 6.5 of the SmPC. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/512637/2015   
Page 11/30 
 
  
  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of either of eight or nine main steps, depending whether colourant is 
used: sifting, mixing, fluid bed granulation of pre-mixture, drying, sifting/ sizing, mixing with colourant (for 
5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg tablets), mixing with sized granules, compression and packaging. The 
granulation has been identified as a critical step. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing 
process. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality 
in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process. 
Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form: appearance (visual examination), average mass (weighing), disintegration (Ph. Eur.), water content 
(KF), identification (HPLC, TLC), assay (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), 
dissolution (HPLC), and microbiological contamination (Ph. Eur.). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. 
Batch analysis results were provided for three commercial scale batches per tablet strength confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of three commercial size batches of 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg tablets stored in 
aluminium/aluminium blisters under long term conditions for 24 months at 30 ºC / 75% RH and for up to 
6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
In addition, stability data of three commercial size batches of 5 mg, 10 mg, and 30 mg tablets stored in high 
density polyethylene bottles under long term conditions for 24 months at 30 ºC / 65% RH and for up to 
6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
Finally, in-use stability data of two commercial size batches of 5 mg and 30 mg tablets stored in high density 
polyethylene bottles under long term conditions for 36 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided. 
The batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the 
primary packaging proposed for marketing. 
Samples were tested using the same analytical procedures as the ones used at release. The analytical 
procedures used are stability indicating. 
In addition, one batch of each of the strengths was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on 
Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. 
All results complied with the proposed specification at all time points tested. Therefore, based on available 
stability data, the shelf-life of 2 years (3 months after first opening of bottle) with no special storage 
conditions are acceptable.

Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those 
used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of 
ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of 
Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give 
reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects   
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is 
based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to 
generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical 
aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been 
discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the introduction of 
Aripiprazole Sandoz is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes 
for all aripiprazole containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, 
the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased.

2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
For a generic of a reference medicinal product no toxicological and pharmacological tests are required. The 
CHMP concluded that no additional non-clinical data were required. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for 4 different strengths of aripiprazole tablets (5mg, 10mg, 15mg and 30mg) and one 
new strength (20mg) being introduced as an hybrid of the Reference medicinal product on the basis that this 
may facilitate dosage titration.  
To support the marketing authorisation application the applicant conducted two bioequivalence studies with 
cross-over design under fasting conditions. These studies were the pivotal study for the assessment. 
The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as 
efficacy and safety of aripiprazole based on published literature. The SmPC is in line with the SmPC of the 
reference product. 
No CHMP scientific advice pertinent to the clinical development was given for this medicinal product.  
For the clinical assessment the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98) in 
its current version, is of particular relevance.  
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.   
Exemption  
As per Guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98/Rev. 01/Corr**), the 
following criteria must be met for a waiver of additional strengths: 
According to the current GUIDELINE ON THE INVESTIGATION OF BIOEQUIVALENCE 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr**), a bioequivalence study investigating only one strength for each 
pharmaceutical form may be acceptable if all of the following 5 conditions are fulfilled: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the pharmaceutical products are manufactured by the same manufacturing process; 
the drug pharmacokinetics is linear; 
the qualitative composition of the different strengths is the same; 
the ratio between the amount of each excipient to the amount of active substance(s) is the same for 
all strengths (for immediate release products coating components, capsule shell, colour agents and 
flavours are not required to follow this rule); 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/512637/2015   
Page 14/30 
 
  
  
• 
the dissolution profiles are similar under identical conditions for the additional strengths and the 
strength of the batch used in the bioequivalence study. 
Based on the BE study using the 10mg strength, a bio waiver for the 15 mg, 20 mg and 30 mg strengths was 
requested. The 10mg strength was chosen for the safety of the healthy volunteers in the study. This was 
considered acceptable and concurs with the guideline which states that the selection of the lower strength is 
justified for drugs showing linear pharmacokinetics in cases higher strengths cannot be safely administered in 
healthy volunteers. Life threatening adverse events attributed to acute laryngeal dystonia have been indeed 
reported following administration of a single dose of 30mg aripiprazole to healthy volunteers in 
bioequivalence studies. The 5mg strength has also been tested for bioequivalence versus the respective 
strength of the reference formulation.   
The proposed 2mg strength applied for via Article 10.3 was intended to facilitate the initiation of the 
treatment in adolescents aged 13 and older. The applicant withdrew this strength during the procedure. 
In addition, Aripiprazole showed linear kinetics over a range of 5 mg to 30 mg after single dose oral 
administration; hence it was deemed justified to claim a waiver for the additional strengths. All the conditions 
of the biowaiver for the 15mg strength were also considered fulfilled. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
To support the application, the applicant has submitted two bioequivalence studies. 
Study 2013-05-TAB-01:3021/13  
Methods 
This was a randomised, open-label, two-period, two-sequence, two-treatment, single dose, crossover 
comparative oral bioavailability study to establish comparative bioequivalence of  Aripiprazole 10 mg tablets 
(Hexal AG) and Abilify 10 mg tablets (MAH: Bristol Myers Squibb GmbH) in 48 healthy, adult, male human 
subjects under fasting conditions. The objective of the study was to compare the rate and extent of 
absorption of both products and to monitor the adverse events to ensure the safety and tolerability of a 
single dose of Aripiprazole 10 mg.  
Study design  
Based on the randomised schedule and following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours in both periods each 
volunteer received a single oral dose of Aripiprazole 10mg Tablet with 240ml of water in period I and either 
one tablet of the reference or test product in period II.  
Subjects were dosed while in sitting posture and were instructed to remain seated in an upright position for 
the first 8 hours following drug administration. Drinking water was not permitted one hour before dosing and 
until one hour post dose. Subjects were confined to BPSI clinical facility from at least 12 hours prior to each 
drug administration until after the 72-hour blood sample collection in each study period. 
The two periods were separated by a wash-out phase of at least 45 days.

Blood samples were taken at the following time points: pre-dose and at 1, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 
6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, 36, 48 and 72 hours after dosing. Blood sampling time adjustments are 
presented in the dossier.  
All plasma samples were shipped by courier, frozen in dry ice, and were received frozen and in good 
condition. 
Test and reference products   
Population(s) studied   
48 healthy adult male human subjects were enrolled as per the protocol. The study started with 48 subjects 
and 38 completed the study. The reasons for10 exclusions has been included in the dossier and are deemed 
not to have an effect on the outcome of the study.  
Main inclusion criteria: 
Healthy human adult literate male non smoker subjects between 18-45 years of age (inclusive), having a 
body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 30 kg/m2 (inclusive) who had no evidence of underlying disease or

clinically significant abnormal laboratory values at screening and who voluntarily consented to participate in 
the study in written form. 
Analytical methods   
Analysis of aripiprazole was performed using test method AL-M166-04.   
This method involved the extraction of aripiprazole and the internal standard aripiprazole-d8 from human 
plasma. Samples were kept frozen at -20ºC prior to analysis for a period of 59 days.  
4092 blood samples were to be collected for the 48 subjects. 2046 samples were collected. 3 samples were 
re-assayed and 172 samples were identified for incurred sample reanalysis. 100.00% is the percentage of 
samples where the difference between the two values was less than 20% of the mean for chromatographic 
assays or less than 30% for the ligand binding assays.  
The method has been validated (MVR-166/02) and partially revalidated 8 times. The following parameters 
were addressed; selectivity of Aripiprazole and the internal standard (IS), calibration curve (linearity), 
carryover test, recovery of both the analyte and the internal standard, precision, accuracy, dilution integrity 
accuracy and precision, stability of the stock solution (short and long term stability in the biological matrix, 
bench top, freeze-thaw, auto sampler storage, and post-preparative stability), haemolysis effect accuracy 
and precision, ruggedness and matrix effect. Each parameter has been assessed and the limits are justified. 
This is deemed acceptable.  
The effect of interfering drugs was also studied using the following commonly used medicines: caffeine, 
cetirizine, diclofenac ibuprofen, paracetamol, nicotine, and ondansetron. No effect on the determination of 
the analyte and the internal standard was observed.  
The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of this method for the estimation of Aripiprazole concentrations in 
plasma was 0.404ng/ml (Precision 3.82%, Accuracy 98.02%). The linearity range of Aripiprazole was from 
0.404g/ml to 255.413ng/ml. (8 point curve) 
The bioanalytical report (3021/13) was submitted with 20% of the subject chromatograms presented as well 
as the method SOP. Certificates of analysis for the test and reference drug products as well as for the drug 
standards used for Aripiprazole and Aripiprazole –d8 have been provided and are deemed acceptable.  
Pharmacokinetic Variables

Statistical methods   
The 90% confidence interval of the relative mean AUC0-72 and Cmax of the test and reference product 
should be at least 80% and not more than 125% for log-transformed data. ANOVA was performed on the 
log-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters - AUC0-72 and Cmax of aripiprazole using General Linear Model 
(PROC GLM procedure) of SAS. The 90% confidence interval for the difference between the least square 
means (LSM) was calculated for the log-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters - AUC0-72 and Cmax of 
aripiprazole. The number of observations, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation (CV 
%), minimum, median, maximum and geometric mean were calculated for all the pharmacokinetic 
parameters.

experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment 
as well as treatment up to 12 weeks of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in 
adolescents aged 13 years and older.  
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available 
nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical 
perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as 
well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical 
aspects based on information from published literature was considered sufficient. The SmPC is in line with 
the SmPC of the reference product. 
The two bioequivalence studies formed the pivotal basis of the application. The study designs were 
considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of the two formulations applied for and were in line with 
the respective European requirements 
The test formulations of Aripiprazole Sandoz 5mg tablets and Aripiprazole Sandoz 10 mg tablets met the 
protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when compared with Abilify 5mg and Abilify 10 mg tablets 
respectively. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded.

2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2- positive gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction 
adenocarcinoma. 
State the claimed therapeutic indication 
KEYTRUDA, in combination with trastuzumab, fluoropyrimidine and platinum-containing chemotherapy, 
is indicated for the first-line treatment of locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive 
gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 with a 
CPS ≥ 1. 
Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
The gastric and gastro-oesophageal junction cancer are two different clinical entities, representing the 
4th and 6th most common cause of cancer-related mortalities according with the GLOBOCAN 2020 
Assessment report  
EMA/359366/2023  
Page 7/119 
 
 
 
 
database. While the gastric cancer incidence has been declining in Western countries thanks to 
economic development, preventative programs focused on dietary habits, and better food preservation 
practices, recent studies have reported an increase in younger age groups (<50 years), and a rise in 
the incidence of the gastro-oesophageal junction disease has also been observed. Asia is the leading 
geographic area for incidence and mortality of the disease, with 48.6% of all global deaths occurring in 
China alone. 
Genetic predisposition has been recognised in a minority of cases of gastric cancer (10%), while diet-
related factors, smoking habit, H. pylori infection, together with excess body weight, gastroesophageal 
reflux disease and oesophageal intestinal metaplasia are among the key risk factors. Considering the 
modifiable nature of the most important etiopathogenetic factors for gastric and gastro-oesophageal 
cancer, prevention has a relevant impact on burden of disease.  
Biologic features, Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Approximately 90% of gastric cancers are adenocarcinomas (ACs). Adenocarcinoma accounts for 
roughly two-thirds of oesophageal cancer cases. In terms of biological features, gastric and junctional 
cancer are highly heterogeneous. Among molecular hallmarks, the HER-2 over-expression provides a 
marker for selecting patients who benefit from a targeted-therapeutic approach in addition to 
chemotherapy.   
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Patients are generally asymptomatic in the early stages. In advanced disease, they can present with 
non-specific symptoms including dysphagia, asthenia, indigestion, vomiting, weight loss, early satiety 
and/or iron deficiency anaemia. Because of the silent progression, diagnosis is often delayed so that 
the majority of patients are at an advanced stage of disease at presentation, and this compromises the 
curative potential of available treatments. Endoscopic examination and biopsies are the gold standard 
for diagnosis. Prognosis is generally poor, with an overall mortality at 1 year.  
The current 5-year survival rate for advanced gastric cancer, diagnosed at the distant/metastatic stage 
is 5.9% and therefore represents an area of high unmet medical need for a treatment regimen that 
improves upon outcomes for these patients. Cancer. 2020; 126: 4553-4562; Gut. 2020; 69: 823-829; CA 
Cancer J Clin. 2021; : caac.21660; World J Gastroenterol. 2018; 24: 2818-2832 
Management 
In HER-2-positive advanced tumours, the use of trastuzumab in addition to chemotherapy 
demonstrated survival advantage over chemotherapy alone, based on the phase III ToGA study (HR 
0.74; 95% CI 0.60-0.91; P =0.0046 in OS). The current recommended management of patients is 
illustrated below, according with current ESMO guidelines (Annals of Oncology 2022;33(10):1005).

2.1.2.  About the product 
Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is a humanized mAb IgG4/kappa isotype directed against PD-1. By blocking 
the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands PD-L1/2, pembrolizumab enhances T cell lymphocyte 
activity with consequent stimulation of the immune-mediated anti-tumour activity. Pembrolizumab also 
modulates the level of IL-2, TNFα, IFNγ, and other cytokines. The antibody potentiates existing 
immune responses in the presence of antigen only; it does not non-specifically activate T cells. 
Junttila et al demonstrated that combining trastuzumab-based bispecific antibody HER2-TDB with anti-
PD-L1 yielded a combination immunotherapy that enhanced tumor growth inhibition, increasing the 
rates and durability of therapeutic response (Junttila et al. Antitumor efficacy of a bispecific antibody 
that targets HER2 and activates T cells. Cancer Res. 2014 Oct 1;74(19):5561-7). In addition, 
nonclinical studies have shown that a mAb against PD-1 substantially boosts the efficacy of anti-HER2 
treatment and shows improved activity (Junttila et al. Antitumor efficacy of a bispecific antibody that 
targets HER2 and activates T cells. Cancer Res. 2014 Oct 1;74(19):5561-7). 
Pembrolizumab is already approved as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents 
across a wide range of clinical indications. Within the clinical setting of gastroesophageal disease, 
Keytruda has been approved, in combination with chemotherapy, for the first-line treatment of the 
oesophagus or HER-2 negative gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma with CPS≥10.

The applied and approved indication is: 
Gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma  
KEYTRUDA, in combination with trastuzumab, fluoropyrimidine and platinum-containing chemotherapy, 
is indicated for the first-line treatment of locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive 
gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 with a 
CPS ≥ 1. 
The recommended dose of KEYTRUDA in adults is either 200 mg every 3 weeks or 400 mg every 
6 weeks administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
No scientific advice was sought on study KEYNOTE-811 pivotal for this application.  
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP  
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. The MAH has 
provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out 
in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Keytruda is a protein and is therefore exempt from the ERA requirements. This is compliant to the 
current Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00). 
2.3.  Clinical aspects

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Substantial characterization of the PK and immunogenicity of pembrolizumab have been provided in 
previous submissions. In particular, pembrolizumab PK disposition has been characterized via pooled 
population PK analyses using serum concentration-time data contributed from subjects across various 
clinical studies using a time-dependent PK (TDPK) model. The PK reference dataset for monotherapy 
includes all available PK data from subjects enrolled on KEYNOTE-001, KEYNOTE-002, KEYNOTE-006, 
Assessment report  
EMA/359366/2023  
Page 12/119 
 
 
 
 
 
KEYNOTE-010, and KEYNOTE-024, with an overall sample size of 2993. This serves as the PK reference 
analysis to support descriptions of pembrolizumab pharmacokinetics in the USPI and EU SmPC. 
An additional dosing regimen of 400 mg Q6W has been approved in certain regions, including in the US 
for all adult indications in the monotherapy and combination therapy settings. In addition to the dosing 
regimens of 200 mg Q3W or 2 mg/kg Q3W, the 400 mg Q6W dosing regimen was also approved in the 
EU for all adult monotherapy indications (procedure number EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0062) and for all 
adult indications in combination with other anticancer agents (procedure number 
EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0102). 
Absorption 
Pembrolizumab  is  dosed  via  the  intravenous  route  and  therefore  is  immediately  and  completely 
bioavailable. 
Distribution 
Consistent  with  a  limited  extravascular  distribution,  the  volume  of  distribution  of  pembrolizumab  at 
steady  state  is  small  (6.0  L;  coefficient  of  variation  [CV]:  20%).  As  expected  for  an  antibody, 
pembrolizumab does not bind to plasma proteins in a specific manner. 
Elimination 
Pembrolizumab  CL  is  approximately  23%  lower  (geometric  mean,  195  mL/day  [CV%:  40%])  after 
achieving maximal change at steady state compared with the first dose (252 mL/day [CV%: 37%]); this 
decrease in CL with time is not considered clinically meaningful. The geometric mean value (CV%) for 
the terminal half-life is 22 days (32%) at steady-state. 
Pharmacokinetic in target population 
Considering that an extensive characterization of the PK and immunogenicity profile of pembrolizumab 
have been provided in previous submissions, in this submission the focus is on the data related to the 
characterization  of  the  pharmacology  for  the  combination  of  pembrolizumab  with  trastuzumab  plus 
chemotherapy (hereafter referred to as pembrolizumab plus SOC) from KEYNOTE-811 IA2. 
The study includes a Global Cohort, in which the chemotherapy is composed by Fluoropyrimidine (FP) or 
Oxaliplatin and capecitabine (CAPOX), and a Japan-specific S-1 and oxaliplatin (SOX) Cohort, in which 
the  chemotherapy  is  composed  by  S-1  plus  oxaliplatin.  Clinical  pharmacology  results  from  the  global 
cohort are presented herein. The clinical pharmacology results from Japan-specific SOX cohort are not 
presented. Clinical pharmacology results from global cohort specific to this submission include: 
- PK and (Antidrug antibody) ADA data of pembrolizumab at 200 mg Q3W for pembrolizumab plus SOC 
treatment. 
-  PK  and  ADA  data  of  trastuzumab  at  8  mg/kg  loading  dose  followed  by  6  mg/kg  Q3W  maintenance 
doses for pembrolizumab plus SOC and SOC treatments.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
KEYTRUDA  is  an  antibody  that  binds  to  the  programmed  death-1  (PD-1)  receptor  and  blocks  its 
interaction with ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. The PD-1 receptor is a negative regulator of T-cell activity that 
has been shown to be involved in the control of T-cell immune responses. KEYTRUDA potentiates T-cell 
responses,  including  anti-tumour  responses,  through  blockade  of  PD-1  binding  to  PD-L1  and  PD-L2, 
which are expressed in antigen presenting cells and may be expressed by tumours or other cells in the 
tumour microenvironment. 
IMMUNOGENICITY  
The existing immunogenicity assessment for pembrolizumab for the monotherapy setting is based on a 
sufficiently  large  dataset  of  patients  across  several  indications,  with  very  low  observed  rates  of  total 
treatment emergent ADA (1.4 - 3.8%) as well as of neutralizing antibodies (0.4 – 1.6%).  
In  total  337  subjects  from  study  KEYNOTE-811  were  included  in  the  immunogenicity  assessment  for 
pembrolizumab  and  672  subjects  were  included  in  the  immunogenicity  assessment  for  the  SOC 
component trastuzumab.  
The  overall  immunogenicity  incidence  was  defined  as  the  proportion  of  treatment  emergent  positive 
subjects to the total number of evaluable subjects (treatment emergent positive, nontreatment emergent 
positive and negative immunogenicity status). 
Pembrolizumab 
For pembrolizumab (200 mg MK-3475 Q3W) plus SOC treatment ADA samples were available from 350 
subjects (ADA cut-off date of 20 April 2022). 
A subset of the subjects was not assessable for drug-induced immunogenicity analysis, because only a 
pre-treatment ADA sample was available (N=13). The remaining 337 subjects were assessable for drug-
induced immunogenicity analysis. 
Out  of  the  337  subjects  included  in  the  immunogenicity  assessment,  11  subjects  were  inconclusive, 
resulting  in  326  evaluable  subjects.  The  observed  incidence  of  treatment  emergent  ADA  in  evaluable 
subjects with HER2 positive advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma is 2.1% (7 out of 326), based on 
Assessment report  
EMA/359366/2023  
Page 21/119 
 
 
 
 
7 subjects with treatment emergent positive status, and 319 with negative immunogenicity status. Out 
of  the  7  treatment  emergent  positive  subjects,  one  subject  had  antibodies  with  neutralizing  capacity, 
resulting in a treatment emergent neutralizing positive incidence rate of 0.3% (1 out of 326). 
An overview of the immunogenicity status of all assessable subjects is presented in the table below. 
The  immunogenicity  incidence  of  treatment  emergent  positive  subjects  for  pembrolizumab  after 
treatment  with  pembrolizumab  plus  SOC  in  subjects  with  HER2  positive  advanced  gastric  or  GEJ 
adenocarcinoma is 2.1% (7 out of 326) with 0.3% of neutralizing antibodies (1 out of 326).  
Trastuzumab 
For SOC component trastuzumab, ADA samples for trastuzumab were available from 696 subjects, of 
which 350 were treated with pembrolizumab plus SOC and 346 were treated with SOC. (ADA cut-off 
date of 22 March 2022) 
A subset of the subjects was not assessable for drug-induced immunogenicity analysis, because only a 
pre-treatment ADA sample was available (N=24). The remaining 672 subjects were assessable for 
drug-induced immunogenicity analysis, 338 were in the pembrolizumab plus SOC group and 334 were 
in the SOC group. 
Out  of  the  672  subjects  included  in  the  immunogenicity  assessment,  16  subjects  were  inconclusive, 
resulting in 656 evaluable subjects.  
The incidence of trastuzumab treatment emergent ADA in evaluable subjects after pembrolizumab plus 
SOC therapy is 3.1% (10 out of 327), based on 10 subjects with treatment emergent positive status, 6 
subjects with non-treatment emergent positive status and 311 with negative immunogenicity status. 
The incidence of trastuzumab treatment emergent ADA in evaluable subjects after SOC therapy is 2.4% 
(8  out  of  329),  based  on  8  subjects  with  treatment  emergent  positive  status,  13  subjects  with  non-
treatment emergent positive status and 308 with negative immunogenicity status. 
No Nab analysis was performed for trastuzumab ADA positive samples.

IMPACT OF ANTI-DRUG ANTIBODIES ON EXPOSURE 
Pembrolizumab 
The  effect  of  ADA  on  pembrolizumab  levels,  for  the  subjects  with  ADA  positive  samples,  is  compared 
with the subjects treated with the same regimen that only have ADA negative samples. 
For  the  ADA  positive  subjects,  the  pembrolizumab  exposure  was  comparable  with  the  exposures 
observed for the negative subjects treated with the same regimen (see figure below).

Trastuzumab 
The effect of ADA on trastuzumab levels, for the subjects with ADA positive samples, is compared with 
the subjects treated with the same regimen that only have ADA negative samples. No Nab analysis 
was performed for trastuzumab ADA positive samples. 
For the ADA positive subjects, the trastuzumab exposure was comparable with the exposures observed 
for the negative subjects treated with the same regimen figures below:

2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
No new information regarding PK/PD modelling for pembrolizumab is available within this extension of 
indication. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In this application, the focus is on PK and immunogenicity data related to the combination of 
pembrolizumab with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy (hereafter referred to as pembrolizumab plus 
SOC) from KEYNOTE-811 IA2. The study includes a Global Cohort, in which the chemotherapy is 
composed by FP or CAPOX, and a Japan-specific SOX Cohort, in which the chemotherapy is composed 
by S-1 plus oxaliplatin. Clinical pharmacology results from the global cohort are presented herein.  
PK data from KEYNOTE-811 show that the observed pembrolizumab serum concentration values in 
subjects with advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma are contained within the 90% CI of the 
Assessment report

reference PK model, which indicate consistency with the historical data, in both cycle 1 postdose and 
cycle 8 predose (at steady state). 
In addition, tabular summaries of descriptive statistics and boxplots from early drug treatment at Cycle 
1 end of infusion (post-dose) and at pre-dose Cycle 2 and Cycle 8 show that observed pembrolizumab 
concentrations of 200 mg (Q3W) in combination with SOC (including Trastuzumab) from participants 
with advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma in KEYNOTE-811 are similar to the observed 
pembrolizumab concentration when administered as monotherapy in other trials. 
In conclusion, pembrolizumab PK disposition is not affected by the coadministration with SOC including 
trastuzumab and chemotherapy and in the same way, the PK disposition of the SOC component 
trastuzumab is not affected by the coadministration of pembrolizumab. Similar exposures for 
trastuzumab are reported in the SOC arm as well as in the Pembrolizuma SOC arm. 
The immunogenicity incidence of treatment emergent ADA positive subjects for pembrolizumab after 
treatment with pembrolizumab plus SOC in subjects with HER2 positive advanced gastric or GEJ 
adenocarcinoma is 2.1% (7 out of 326) with 0.3% of neutralizing antibodies (1 out of 326). This 
incidence rate is comparable to the historical incidence rate reported after pembrolizumab 
monotherapy, (1.8%) with 0.4% of neutralizing antibodies. 
The incidence of trastuzumab treatment emergent ADA in evaluable subjects is similar between 
pembrolizumab plus SOC arm (3.1%) and SOC arm (2.4%). 
No Nab analysis was performed for trastuzumab ADA positive samples. This is considered acceptable 
since this lack of Nab characterisation for trastuzumab does not impact on pembrolizumab’s SmPC. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pembrolizumab PK disposition is not affected by the coadministration with SOC including trastuzumab 
and chemotherapy and, in the same way, the PK disposition of the SOC component trastuzumab is not 
affected by the coadministration of pembrolizumab. Similar exposures for trastuzumab are reported in 
the SOC arm as well as in the Pembrolizumab + SOC arm. 
The immunogenicity incidence of treatment emergent ADA positive subjects for pembrolizumab after 
treatment with pembrolizumab plus SOC in subjects with HER2 positive advanced gastric or GEJ 
adenocarcinoma is similar to the historical incidence rate reported after pembrolizumab monotherapy.  
The incidence of trastuzumab treatment emergent ADA in evaluable subjects is similar between 
pembrolizumab plus SOC arm and SOC arm. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The current submission is based on a single pivotal study (KEYNOTE-811).  
KEYNOTE-811 is an ongoing, Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study 
to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in combination with trastuzumab + 
chemotherapy (cisplatin and 5-FU or oxaliplatin and capecitabine) versus trastuzumab + 
chemotherapy alone as 1L treatment in participants with unresectable or metastatic HER-2-positive 
gastric/gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma.  
Results are submitted from the IA2 of KEYNOTE-811 (DCO date: 25-MAY-2022) that was triggered 
approximately 9 months after the last participant was randomized, when 484 PFS events had occurred 
(80% information fraction).

Sample size  
The study was planned to randomize approximately 692 participants in the Global Cohort in a 1:1 ratio 
to receive either pembrolizumab or placebo in combination with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy (FP or 
CAPOX). An additional 40 participants were planned to be randomized in the study as a Japan-specific 
SOX Cohort in a 1:1 ratio between the 2 arms. Data from this cohort has been analyzed separately 
from the Japanese Global Cohort participants, who were randomized as part of the Global Cohort and 
follow the FP or CAPOX treatment regimens to which they are assigned. 
Sample Size and Power Calculations for PFS and OS 
The study includes dual-primary efficacy endpoints: 1) PFS per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR and 2) 
OS.  
The sample size (number of participants) calculations were based on the following assumptions: (1) 
the enrollment period was 28 months and the ramp-up period of enrolment was 6 months; (2) the 
duration of PFS and OS is assumed to follow an exponential distribution; (3) median PFS was assumed 
Assessment report  
EMA/359366/2023  
Page 34/119 
 
 
 
 
to be 6.7 months in the control group with a true HR of 0.7; (4) median OS was assumed to be 13.8 
months in the control group with a true HR ratio of 0.75. 
Progression-free Survival 
It was expected that with approximately 606 PFS events at final analysis (FA), the study has 
approximately 95% power for detecting a HR of 0.7 at an initially assigned 0.003 (1-sided) significance 
level. 
Overall Survival 
It was expected that with approximately 551 deaths at FA, the study has approximately 90% power for 
detecting an HR of 0.75 at an initially assigned 0.020 (1-sided) significance level. 
Software used for sample size calculation 
Power and interim analyses calculations were performed using the gsDesign R package. 
Randomisation  
Treatment allocation/randomization occurred centrally using an interactive response technology (IRT) 
system. There are 2 study treatment arms. Participants were assigned randomly in a 1:1 ratio to 
pembrolizumab and saline placebo, respectively. 
Treatment randomization was stratified based on the following criteria: 
1. For Global cohort only: 
- Geographic region (Europe/Israel/North America/Australia versus Asia versus Rest of the World 
including South America) 
- PD-L1 status (positive (CPS≥1) versus negative (CPS<1)) 
- Chemotherapy regimen (FP or CAPOX), which was chosen prior to randomization in the study. 
2. Japan-specific SOX cohort: 
- Disease status (ECOG 0 versus ECOG 1) 
Blinding (masking)  
This study has been conducted as a double-blind study under in-house blinding procedures. The 
participant and the investigator who were involved in the study treatment administration or clinical 
evaluation of the participants were unaware of the group assignments. Pembrolizumab and placebo 
were prepared and/or dispensed in a blinded fashion by an unblinded pharmacist or other qualified site 
personnel dispensed in a blinded fashion by an unblinded pharmacist or unblinded qualified study site.  
The official, final database has not been unblinded until medical/scientific review has been performed, 
protocol deviations have been identified, and data have been declared final and complete. Related to 
the planned interim analyses, an external Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) served as the primary 
reviewer of the results of the interim analyses of the study and had the role to make (if needed) 
recommendations for discontinuation or protocol modifications to an executive committee of the 
Sponsor who might have been unblinded to results at treatment level in order to act on these 
recommendations.

Statistical methods 
Protocol Amendments involving statistical methods 
The protocol was subject to eight amendments, of which Amendment 5 (20-May-2020), Amendment 6 
(07-Jul-2020) and Amendment 8 (07-Apr-2022) modified the SAP language as follows. 
Amendment 5 (20-May-2020): PFS endpoint was added to the first interim analysis (IA1) as an 
administrative look and futility analysis for ORR was removed from the IA1. The protocol was also 
updated to clarify how to handle with participants with positive response to study treatment resulting 
in the opportunity to have curative surgical resection. Among these patients, only patients who had CR 
or PR prior to the curative surgical resection were used for ORR endpoint. In addition, the associated 
primary censoring rules of PFS were updated and a sensitivity analysis of PFS in which participants 
were censored at the time of curative surgical resection were added. 
Amendment 6 (07-Jul-2020): Based on Regulatory Authority input, the data might have been 
immature for PFS at time of IA1 since the enrolment was not completed. For this reason the PFS 
endpoint was removed from IA1. 
Amendment 8 (07-APR-2022): To accommodate the situation in case of significantly slower than 
anticipated accrual of PFS and/or OS events, greater flexibility of the timing of second interim analysis 
(IA2), third interim analysis (IA3) and FA has been introduced, allowing the Sponsor to conduct the 
analyses with up to 3 additional months of follow-up than the minimal follow-up as described above, or 
when the specified number of events are observed, whichever comes first. In addition, a clarification 
regarding the alpha spending at FA for PFS and OS hypothesis testing has been added; only the 
remaining Type I error that has not been spent at earlier analyses can be used during the FA. 
The table below shows the history of changes.

aNote for IA2, IA3, and FA, if the events accrue slower than expected, the Sponsor may conduct the 
analysis with up to 3 additional months of follow-up than the minimal follow-up as described 
above, or when the specified number of events are observed, whichever comes first. 
At the time of data cutoff (25-MAY-2022) for IA2, approximately 484 PFS events (234 in the 
pembrolizumab plus SOC group and 250 in the SOC group) and 415 OS events (202 in the 
pembrolizumab plus SOC group and 213 in the SOC group) occurred. Median duration of follow-up in 
the ITT population (N=698) was 16.1 months (range: 0.6 to 41.6 months) and 14.8 months (range: 
0.3, 41.2 months) in the pembrolizumab plus SOC group and SOC group, respectively. For CPS ≥1, the 
median duration of follow-up of participants was 17.0 months (range: 0.6 to 41.6 months) and 13.9 
months (range: 0.3 to 41.2 months) in the pembrolizumab plus SOC group and SOC group, 
respectively, which was consistent with the ITT population. 
Error probabilities, adjustment for multiplicity 
The trial used an extension of the graphical method of Maurer and Bretz to provide strong multiplicity 
control for multiple hypotheses while making the interim and final analysis timing be more flexible. 
According to the Maurer and Bretz approach, study hypotheses may be tested in a group sequential 
fashion, and when a particular null hypothesis is rejected, the alpha allocated to that hypothesis can be 
reallocated to other hypothesis tests. The overall Type-I error rate among the multiple hypotheses was 
strongly controlled at 2.5% (one-sided). Figure below shows the Type I Error Reallocation Strategy 
according to Protocol Amendment 8. 
The initial 1-sided alpha allocation for each hypothesis in the ellipse representing the hypothesis. The 
weights for reallocation from each hypothesis to the others are represented in the boxes on the lines 
connecting hypotheses. The extended graphical method spends alpha as a function of the minimum of 
the actual event information fraction and the expected event information fraction. This ensures that 
Assessment report  
EMA/359366/2023  
Page 38/119 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the actual spending will be no more aggressive than the planned, while at the same time ensuring that 
not all alpha is spent prior to final planned event counts. 
ORR 
The study initially allocated alpha=0.002, 1-sided, to test ORR, and ORR was tested only at the IA1. 
However, if the test did not reach statistical significance at IA1, the p-value from IA1 could has been 
compared to an updated alpha-level if the null hypotheses for both PFS and OS were rejected at a later 
time. Power at the possible alpha-levels as well as the approximate treatment difference required to 
reach the bound (ORR difference) at Interim Analysis 1 are shown in the table below. 
PFS 
The initial alpha-level for testing PFS was 0.003. If the null hypothesis for ORR was rejected, half of its 
alpha was reallocated to PFS hypothesis testing. If the null hypothesis for OS was rejected, then 
alpha=0.02 was essentially fully reallocated to PFS hypothesis testing. Thus, the PFS null hypothesis 
might be tested at alpha=0.003, alpha=0.004 (if the ORR null hypothesis was rejected but not the OS 
null hypothesis), alpha=0.023 (if the OS null hypothesis was rejected but not the ORR null 
hypothesis), or alpha=0.025 (if both the ORR and OS null hypotheses were rejected). Table below 
shows the boundary properties for each of these alpha-levels for the interim analyses, which were 
derived using a Lan-DeMets O'Brien-Fleming spending function based on predicted number of events at 
the planned time of interim analysis. The final row indicates the total power to reject the null 
hypothesis for PFS at each alpha-level. 
The event counts for all analyses was used to compute correlations. Also note that if the OS or ORR 
null hypothesis was rejected at an interim or final analysis, each PFS interim and final analysis test 
might be compared to its updated bounds considering the alpha reallocation from the OS or ORR 
hypothesis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/359366/2023  
Page 39/119 
 
 
 
 
 
OS 
The OS hypothesis may be tested at alpha=0.02 (initially allocated alpha), alpha=0.023 (if the PFS but 
not the ORR null hypothesis was rejected), alpha=0.021(if the ORR but not the PFS null hypothesis 
was rejected), or alpha=0.025 (if both the ORR and PFS null hypotheses weree rejected). Table below 
shows the bounds and boundary properties for OS hypothesis testing derived using a Lan-DeMets 
O'Brien-Fleming spending function based on the predicted number of events at the planned time of 
interim analysis. 
The event counts for all analyses were used to compute correlations. Also note that if the PFS or ORR 
null hypothesis were rejected at an interim or final analysis, each OS interim and final analysis test 
might be compared to its updated bounds considering the alpha reallocation from the PFS or ORR 
hypothesis. 
Efficacy analyses 
The Intention-to-Treat (ITT) population, which consisted of all 698 randomized participants, served as 
the population for primary efficacy analyses. Any participant who receives a randomization number 
was considered to have been randomized. Participants were included in the treatment group to which 
they are randomized, regardless of whether they received study treatment. The ITT population 
excluding MSI-H participants served as the sensitivity analysis for the endpoints of PFS per RECIST 1.1 
by BICR, OS, and ORR per RECIST 1.1 per BICR. 
A summary of the analysis strategy for key efficacy endpoints as well as censoring rules for primary 
and sensitivity analyses of PFS are presented in the following tables:

The non-parametric Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the PFS and OS curve in each 
treatment group. The treatment difference in PFS and OS was assessed by the stratified log-rank test. 
For PFS and OS a stratified Cox proportional hazard model with Efron's method of tie handling was 
used to assess the magnitude of the treatment difference between the treatment arms. The hazard 
ratio (HR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) from the stratified Cox model with Efron's method of tie 
handling and with a single treatment covariate was reported. The same stratification factors used for 
randomization were applied to both the stratified log-rank test and the stratified Cox model.  
For OS analysis, participants without documented death at the time of analysis will be censored at the 
date of last contact. 
In order to evaluate the robustness of the PFS endpoint, one primary and two sensitivity analyses with 
a different set of censoring rules were performed. The censoring rules for primary and sensitivity 
analyses are summarized in Table 1. 
Sensitivity analyses to adjust for the effect of treatment switching to other PD-1 or other new 
anticancer therapies on OS may be performed as model assumptions permit. Three recognized 
methods may be included: 1) the Rank Preserving Structural Failure Time (RPSFT) model proposed by 
Robins and Tsiatis (1989); 2) the two-stage model proposed by Latimer; and 3) the Inverse-
Probability-of-Censoring Weighting (IPCW) model in which an examination of the appropriateness of 
the data to the assumptions is required by the methods. Other sensitivity analyses described for the 
PFS endpoint were applied to OS endpoint as appropriate. 
The stratified Miettinen and Nurminen method was used for the comparison of the ORR between the 
two treatment groups. The difference in ORR and its 95% confidence interval from the stratified 
Miettinen and Nurminen method with strata weighting by sample size was reported. The stratification 
factors used for randomization were applied to the analysis. The same strategy of combination of small 
strata defined for the PFS analysis was used for the ORR analysis. The descriptive analysis of ORR 
based on all participants was performed after IA1. No formal hypothesis testing was conducted. 
DOR was summarised descriptively using Kaplan-Meier medians and quartiles. Only the subset of 
patients who show a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) were included in this analysis. 
For each DOR analysis, a corresponding summary of the censoring reasons for responding participant 
were also provided. Responding subjects who were alive, had not progressed, had not initiated new 
anti-cancer treatment, had not been determined to be lost to follow-up, and had a disease assessment 
Assessment report  
EMA/359366/2023  
Page 42/119 
 
 
 
 
within ~5 months of the data cutoff date were considered ongoing responders at the time of analysis. 
If a subject met multiple criteria for censoring, the censoring criterion that occurs earliest was applied. 
Censoring rules for DOR are summarized in Table 2. 
Subgroup analyses 
Subgroup Analyses and Effect of Baseline Factors are planned. To determine whether the treatment 
effect is consistent across various subgroups, the between-group treatment effect for PFS and OS (with 
a nominal 95% CI) was estimated and plotted by treatment group within each category of the 
following classification variables: Age category: (<65 versus ≥65 years); Sex: (female, male); Race: 
(Asian versus non-Asian); Region: Europe/Israel/North America/Australia versus Asia versus Rest of 
World (including South America); PD-L1: Positive versus Negative: MSI status; Primary location: 
Stomach versus GEJ; Histological subtype: Diffuse versus intestinal versus indeterminate; Tumor 
Burden: ≥ median versus <median; Number of Metastases: ≤2 versus ≥3; Prior 
Gastrectomy/Esophagectomy: yes versus no; Baseline ECOG : 0 versus 1; Region: US versus ex-US; 
Chemotherapy regimen: FP or CAPOX. 
The consistency of the treatment effect was assessed descriptively via summary statistics by category 
for the classification variables listed above. If any level of a subgroup variable had fewer than 20 
participants, above analysis could not be performed for that level of the subgroup variable. The 
subgroup analyses for PFS and OS were conducted using an unstratified Cox model, and the subgroup 
analyses for ORR were conducted using the unstratified Miettinen and Nurminen method. 
Safety analyses 
Safety analyses were based on the APaT population, which included all 696 randomized participants 
who received at least 1 dose of study intervention. The analysis of safety results followed a tiered 
approach as shown in the table below. There were no Tier 1 endpoints in this study, and Tier 2 
parameters were assessed via point estimates with 95% CIs provided for provided for between group 
comparisons; only point estimates by intervention arm were provided for Tier 3 safety parameters. 
Because many 95% CIs were provided without adjustment for multiplicity, the analysis represents a 
helpful descriptive measure to be used in review, not a formal method for assessing the statistical 
significance of the between-group differences. These analyses were performed using the Miettinen and 
Nurminen method, an unconditional, asymptotic method. 
PRO analyses 
The patient-reported outcomes were exploratory objectives in KEYNOTE 811, and thus no formal 
hypotheses were formulated. PRO analyses for the EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-STO22, and EQ-5D-

Conduct of the study 
Important protocol deviations were reported for 35 and 27 participants in the pembrolizumab plus SOC 
and SOC groups, respectively. Of these, 4 participants in the pembrolizumab plus SOC group and 1 
participant in the SOC group had important protocol deviations that were considered to be clinically 
important. The 4 participants in the pembrolizumab plus SOC group had clinically important protocol 
deviations related to study intervention as described in the table below.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
KEYNOTE-811 was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind study of pembrolizumab vs placebo on top of 
chemotherapy and trastuzumab in first line HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma at an 
advanced disease status (unresectable or metastatic tumours). In support of the sought indication, 
data derived from the IA2 (cutoff date of 25-MAY-2022) of the Phase 3 trial KEYNOTE-811 are 
presented.  
The study population included relatively fit patients (ECOG 0-1 and adequate organ function). Among 
the inclusion/exclusion criteria, attention was given to the cardiac function in consideration of the 
indication to treatment with the HER2-targeted agent trastuzumab and the associated cardiotoxicity.

Availability of the tissue sample was an additional requirement for study entry in view of the PD-L1-
based stratification scheme.  
Pembrolizumab was administrated at a dose of 200 mg Q3W on top of a background therapy including 
two distinct chemotherapeutic regimens, namely a CAPOX (oxaliplatin+capecitabine) or FP (cisplatin+5 
fluorouracil) combination, in addition to the HER2-targeted drug trastuzumab. The tested treatments 
are in line with the current clinical recommendations for the front-line approach to 
advanced/metastatic disease, the adopted drug combinations are considered equally effective and the 
dose of pembrolizumab can also be deemed appropriate since it is approved in both monotherapy and 
chemotherapy combined regimens across different indications. The choice of placebo as add-on to 
chemotherapy plus HER2-targeted therapy as comparator is adequate given the current therapeutic 
landscape for the intended indication.    
The study included dual-primary efficacy endpoints based on PFS per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR 
and OS. A sample size of 692 participants was calculated based on the assumptions that (1) the 
enrolment period was 28 months and the ramp-up period of enrolment was 6 months; (2) the duration 
of PFS and OS followed an exponential distribution; (3) a median PFS of 6.7 months in the control 
group with a true HR of 0.7; (4) a median OS of 13.8 months in the control group with a true HR ratio 
of 0.75. The calculation is comprehensible and reproducible, and the assumptions made for median 
PFS and median OS in the control arm are in line with the available historical data of chemotherapy in 
the 1L setting. The eight amendments to the protocol did not affect the sample size and power 
calculation. Only data from the Global Cohort has been used in the present analysis, data from the 
Japan-specific SOX Cohort remains outside the aim of the present report.   
In the Global Cohort, randomization was stratified according to geographic region, PD-L1 status and 
chemotherapy regimen. The combination of these categories resulted in 3x2x2=12 strata. In the first 
version of the protocol dated 11-Apr-2018, patients were stratified according to geographic region, 
disease status and chemotherapy regimen. After the General Amendment n. 1, dated 31-May-2018 the 
stratification criterion of disease status (ECOG 0 versus ECOG 1) was removed and replaced with the 
PD-L1 status (positive versus negative, where positive was defined as CPS ≥1 and negative was 
defined as CPS <1). This change should not have inflated the balance of demographic and disease 
related characteristics at baseline between the two treatment groups, since the first patient, first visit 
was performed on 05-Oct-2018. It is understood that results from the Phase 1b study KEYNOTE-012 
and Phase 2 KEYNOTE-059 in gastric cancer informed the CPS cut-off level (≥1 and <1) used in the 
current trial. Of note, the assay used for PD-L1 testing in KEYNOTE-811 was the Agilent PD-L1 IHC 
22C3 pharmDx kit, which has been analytically validated to determine PD-L1 expression status in 
gastric tumors. This kit is CE marked as a companion diagnostic for KEYTRUDA in NSCLC, HNSCC, UC, 
esophageal cancer, TNBC, and cervical cancer. KEYNOTE-811 data will be utilized to seek approval of 
the kit as a companion diagnostic for gastric cancer. 
The demographic and baseline disease characteristics were compared to evaluate balance between the 
2 treatment groups and consistency with those of the all-comer participants (ITT).  
As of the data cutoff date for IA2, 9 participants (2 in the pembrolizumab + SOC group and 7 in the 
placebo + SOC group) were inadvertently unblinded to their treatment assignment at the Sponsor level 
due to unblinded information being revealed by different modes of communication to blinded team 
members. Overall, 7 out of the 9 participants were unblinded after discontinuation from treatment. 
Two participants in the pembrolizumab plus SOC group were still on treatment when premature 
unblinding occurred. These unblinding incidents were reviewed via the Sponsor’s Significant Quality 
Issues process and concluded not to have impacted the quality of the data.  
Assessment report  
EMA/359366/2023  
Page 80/119 
 
 
 
The ITT population served as the population for the primary efficacy analyses. All randomly assigned 
participants were included in this population. The IA2 was the first analysis of PFS and OS. Statistical 
methods were well reported in the protocol section and in the supplemental Statistical Analysis Plan 
(sSAP), and considered appropriate: the overall type I error over the primary endpoints (PFS and OS) 
and the key secondary endpoint (ORR) is strongly controlled at 2.5% (one-sided), with initially 0.2% 
allocated to ORR, 0.3% to PFS and 2% to OS. PFS was tested using a hierarchical strategy and 
prespecified analysis plan allows alpha from successful hypotheses to be passed to other hypotheses. 
There were eight protocol amendments over the study course, of these only amendments 5, 6 and 8 
affected the SAP language. The rationale for these amendments was exhaustively explained. 
Altogether these amendments did not affect the consistency of study results, however some issues are 
addressed. Just before the first data cut-off (17-Jun-2020), the protocol was amended to add the PFS 
endpoint at IA1 as an administrative look (amendment 5 of 20-May-2020). Upon health authority 
feedback, after the DCO of 17-Jun-2020 (but before the database was locked on 14-July-2020) the 
protocol was amended again to remove PFS from the IA1 analysis (amendment 6 of 07-Jul-2020). The 
MAH confirmed that these changes were not based on internal data from the study. 
Part of the study was conducted during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. There 
were no changes in the planned analyses following study unblinding and/or no post-hoc analyses were 
performed due to the COVID-19 pandemic or any other reason. 
Sensitivity analyses were adequate. 
At IA1 the stratified analyses were based only on 6 collapsed strata due to the small number of 
participants or events in some strata. The collapsed strata were based on blinded data taking into 
considerations both clinical relevance and counts of subjects/events. The same strata, used in the 
stratified log-rank test and the stratified Cox model, were used consistently at IA2. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
At the time of IA2 the number of randomized patients in the ITT population was 698 (350 to 
pembrolizumab + SOC and 348 to placebo + SOC), slightly higher than the planned number of 692 
patients, and 696 were started on treatment. At time of data cut-off, only 484 PFS events over 542 
required for IA2 were reached, while 415 OS events occurred, more than the expected 401 OS events, 
representing the 75.3% of information fraction. The median duration of follow-up was 15.4 months 
(range: 0.3 to 41.6 months). 
Discontinuation from study intervention was registered in 78.0% of participants. The frequency of 
discontinuation from study intervention was higher in the control arm (73.4% and 82.7% in the 
pembrolizumab and placebo group, respectively), with the most common reason for discontinuation 
from study intervention being progressive disease (50.6% and 62.7% in the pembrolizumab and 
placebo group, respectively). Treatment was ongoing in more participants in the pembrolizumab plus 
SOC group compared with the SOC group (19.7% vs 12.4%).  
The treatment arms were overall comparable in their demographic and disease characteristics. The 
majority of the study population included male patients (80.8% vs 19.2% of male and female subjects, 
respectively) aged 63 years in median, with equal representation of the different age categories 
according with disease epidemiology, with the exception of >75 year group that accounted for only 8% 
of the total population. An equal contribution to recruitment can be noted for the different geographic 
areas (Eastern Europe, Asia and rest of the World, around 30% each). Metastatic disease was 
prevailing over a locally advanced stage (97.6% vs 2.4%), mainly including gastric adenocarcinoma 
(66.8% vs 33.2% of gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma). The PD-L1 status was mostly 
Assessment report  
EMA/359366/2023  
Page 81/119 
 
 
 
positive (85.1% CPS≥1 vs 14.9% of CPS<1), and the backbone therapy was more frequently a CAPOX 
combination (85.4% vs 14.6% of FP combination). Overall, the study population can be considered 
representative of the targeted indication, although very elderly patients were poorly represented and 
only relatively fit patients without significant cardiac conditions were recruited. 
The efficacy analysis in the ITT population, showed advantage of pembrolizumab over placebo in terms 
of PFS (HR=0.72; 95% CI 0.60; 0.87; p<0.0002) with a 2-month gain in disease progression (10 vs 
8.1 months in median in the pembrolizumab and control arm, respectively), but no benefit was 
demonstrated in OS (HR=0.87; 95% CI 0.72;1.06; p<0.0842). With a 75.3% of information fraction in 
OS events at the time of IA2, data can be considered overall mature. 
Among the pre-specified subgroup analysis, the PD-L1 status emerged as the only effect modifier. 
Specifically, the PFS was unfavourably impacted by pembrolizumab in patients with CPS<1 (HR=1.17; 
95% CI 0.73, 1.89), and actually the number of deaths was higher in the pembrolizumab arm relative 
to control (67.3% vs 57.7%) within this subgroup, leading to a negative effect of treatment on OS 
(HR=1.61; 95% CI 0.98,2.64; p=0.9722).  For the counterpart CPS ≥1, pembrolizumab showed 
advantage over placebo in PFS (HR=0.70; 95% CI 0.58, 0.85) and OS (HR=0.79; 95% CI 0.64, 0.98; 
p=0.0143), with a gain in median PFS of 3 months (10.8 vs 7.2) and median OS of 5 months (20.5 vs 
15.6). All the remaining strata were consistent with the ITT population. 
As regards the analysis by PD-L1 status, it should be noted that the effect of pembrolizumab was 
almost similar in the two CPS categories for what concerns PFS (10.8 and 9.5 months in median in the 
CPS ≥1 and CPS<1 group, respectively); superiority in the CPS≥1 subgroup was mainly driven by the 
lower performance of the backbone therapy compared to the effect observed in CPS<1 (7.2 and 9.6 
months in median PFS in the placebo arm for the CPS ≥1 and CPS<1 group, respectively). The OS 
results showed a similar trend, although more deaths were registered with pembrolizumab among 
patients with CPS<1 than those reported in the CPS≥1 group (67.3% vs 56%); on the contrary, 
placebo performed slightly better in the CPS<1 than CPS≥1 group (57.7% vs 61%). Overall, the 
superior effect of pembrolizumab over placebo in the CPS ≥1 seems to result from a slightly better 
performance of pembrolizumab and a lower efficacy of chemotherapy in this group. Acknowledging the 
limited value of subgroups analyses within subgroups, patients aged ≥65 years, and Asians within the 
CPS≥1 population apparently gained no OS benefit. Upon request, the MAH provided additional data for 
subgroup analysis. The increased frequency in the use of subsequent oncologic therapies in the Asian 
population may have contributed to differences in OS compared to non-Asians. Concerning the age 
categories, the subgroup 65-74 year-old patients shows an unfavourable outcome in OS but this was 
not confirmed in the oldest age group (≥75), although this latter is numerically limited for a proper 
analysis. A reduced magnitude of effect based on OS results was also noted for GEJ cancer compared 
to gastric cancer; no definitive conclusions can be made at the moment given the limited sample size 
of this subgroup. In any case, a detrimental effect is not envisaged in the GEJ cancer, with a HR=0.94 
in OS, and the HR=0.73 in PFS that is similar to the ITT population value.  
Based on these data, the MAH seeks indication limited to the CPS≥1 subgroup. Although being a 
stratification factor, efficacy by PD-L1 score was not incorporated in the multiplicity strategy of the 
study design. The non-confirmatory nature of these analyses should be considered implying that an 
effect on both PFS and OS has not been formally demonstrated in CPS ≥1 patients. However, 
plausibility of a PD-L1 dependent effect of pembrolizumab, and balanced distribution of baseline 
characteristics between the two CPS categories by virtue of the stratification scheme, provides a good 
rationale and reliability to the observed results. According to the EMA guidelines on subgroup analysis 
(EMA/CHMP/539146/2013), the trial was formally successful since a statistically significant effect in the 
ITT population on one of the two components of the dual endpoint has emerged; however, the 
therapeutic efficacy or risk-benefit is borderline and clearly not proven in the CPS<1 population, thus

configuring Scenario 2 of the guideline.  A restriction of indication based on PD-L1 status can therefore 
be supported. Considering the single pivotal trial, replication of subgroup findings from other relevant 
trials should be considered, as stated by the EMA guidelines. In this regard, PD-L1 dependency in 
response to treatment has emerged in other clinical indications; and KEYNOTE-590 offers a relevant 
precedent in this specific clinical setting where benefit of treatment in the HER-2 negative gastric 
disease was demonstrated in the subgroup of patients with CPS≥10. The MAH has provided further 
analyses demonstrating that unlike precedent trials in other gastrointestinal cancer types, a CPS cut-
off of 1 clearly distinguishes between favourable and no effect of treatment in this clinical setting, 
which makes the CPS ≥1 in the clinical indication uncontroversial.   
Among the secondary endpoints, ORR analysis showed advantage of pembrolizumab over placebo in 
the ITT population (72.6% vs 59.8%) with a slightly better response duration in pembrolizumab than 
control arm (11.2 vs 9 months in median); a higher rate of participants with extended duration was 
achieved in the pembrolizumab arm compared to the control arm at all time points. The results were 
consistent in the subgroup with CPS≥1. 
The PROs showed similar results between treatment arms.

2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In KEYNOTE-811, a statistically significant advantage of pembrolizumab versus placebo in addition to 
SOC was demonstrated in PFS but not OS, in the ITT population. However, an unfavourable effect of 
pembrolizumab relative to placebo emerges in the CPS<1 subgroup. An indication restricted to the 
CPS≥1 group can be considered, as proposed by the MAH, since data indicate superiority of 
pembrolizumab versus placebo in both PFS and OS in this category of patients.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Safety results are presented for 4 datasets (see table below):  
- Safety results from IA2 of KEYNOTE-811 (DCO date: 25 MAY-2022). Safety analyses were based on 
the APaT population, which included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study 
intervention. 
- Pooled safety data from studies of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy, as a point of 
reference. This group is comprised of non-gastric studies (ie, NSCLC, HNSCC, TNBC, esophageal, and 
cervical) with participants who received a variety of single agent or combination chemotherapies, thus 
comparisons of safety data may be limited due to the differences in the chemotherapeutic regimens, 
indications, time of exposure, underlying disease and severity of disease, and demographics between 
these datasets.

- Pooled safety data from pembrolizumab monotherapy studies, comprising the pembrolizumab 
monotherapy RSD, to enable a comparison of the safety profile of pembrolizumab plus SOC observed 
in KEYNOTE-811 to the established safety profile for pembrolizumab monotherapy.

Patient exposure 
Patients enrolled in KN811 study received study intervention as per table below. 
Pembrolizumab/trastuzumab were given until PD, completion of 35 cycles, or other discontinuation 
criteria were met. Duration of cisplatin in FP may be capped at 6 cycles, while oxaliplatin in CAPOX 
may be capped at 6 or 8 cycles as per local country guidelines; however, treatment with 5-FU or 
capecitabine may continue per protocol. Participants have the option to receive up to 1 additional year 
of trastuzumab and capecitabine or 5-FU or S1 beyond 35 administrations of pembrolizumab/placebo 
at the discretion of the investigator and after Sponsor consultation.

 A specific adverse event appears on this report only if its incidence in one or more of the columns meets the incidence criterion in 
the report title, after rounding. 
 MedDRA preferred terms "Neoplasm Progression", "Malignant Neoplasm Progression" and "Disease Progression" not related to 
the drug are excluded. 
Deaths considered drug-related by investigator were: 
- Four AEs resulting in death in the pembrolizumab plus SOC group: pneumonitis, hepatitis, sepsis, 
and cerebral infarction (of the AEs resulting in death, it is noted in the narrative that an additional case 
of pneumonitis, which was considered unrelated by the investigator, was instead assessed as drug-
related based on the sponsor’s review).  
- Three AEs resulting in death in the SOC group: myocarditis, pulmonary embolism, and cholangitis. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AEOSI) 
AEOSI are immune-mediated events and infusion-related AEs causally associated with pembrolizumab.

Other or Indication-specific Adverse Events 
Trastuzumab can cause cardiomyopathy, and there is a 4- to 6-fold increase in the incidence of 
symptomatic myocardial dysfunction among participants receiving treatment as a single agent or in 
combination therapy. As a result, a review of Grade 3 to 5 AEs of cardiac disorders and LVEF <50% 
and ≥10% decrease from baseline was performed for each treatment group. 
The proportion of participants with baseline and postbaseline measurements who experienced 
decreases from baseline in LVEF was similar between the pembrolizumab plus SOC and SOC treatment 
groups.  
Three participants in the pembrolizumab plus SOC group experienced Grade 3 SAEs of cardiac 
disorders and LVEF <50% and ≥10% decrease from baseline: 1 congestive cardiac failure (unrelated), 
1 cardiac failure (related), and 1 acute myocardial infarction (related). For both SAEs considered 
related to study intervention by the investigator, study treatment was discontinued. In the SOC group, 
1 participant experienced a Grade 3 SAE of acute myocardial infarction, considered unrelated to study 
intervention.

Adverse reactions included in the SmPC 
The MAH has updated Section 4.8 of the SmPC to include the KEYNOTE-811 population of gastric and 
gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma patients, receiving pembrolizumab in combination with 
trastuzumab plus chemotherapy, into the current ‘pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy’ 
pooled dataset. This dataset includes all pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy combination indications 
currently approved in the EU. Supportive table is shown below:

Laboratory findings 
The most frequently reported laboratory abnormalities were generally consistent between the 
pembrolizumab plus SOC and SOC treatment groups. Most laboratory abnormalities in the 
pembrolizumab plus SOC group were Grade 1 or 2.  
Three participants met the criteria for drug-induced liver injury (2 [0.6%] in the pembrolizumab plus 
SOC group and 1 [0.3%] in the SOC group): ALT or AST ≥3 x ULN and bilirubin ≥2 x ULN and ALP <2 
x ULN.

Safety in special populations 
The safety findings in the pembrolizumab plus SOC group based on sex and ECOG performance status 
were balanced in the pembrolizumab + generally consistent with the established safety profiles of 
trastuzumab, chemotherapy components, and pembrolizumab monotherapy. The overall summary of 
AEs in the pembrolizumab plus SOC group was similar between male and female and between patients 
with ECOG 0 and 1 (data not shown).

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
As pembrolizumab is an IgG antibody that is administered parenterally and cleared by catabolism, food 
and DDI are not anticipated to influence exposure. 
Studies evaluating pharmacodynamic drug interactions with pembrolizumab have not been conducted. 
However, as systemic corticosteroids may be used in combination with pembrolizumab to ameliorate 
potential side effects, the potential for a PK DDI with pembrolizumab as a victim was assessed as part 
of the PPK analysis. No relationship was observed between prolonged use of systemic corticosteroids 
Assessment report  
EMA/359366/2023  
Page 108/119 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and pembrolizumab exposure. Nevertheless, the use of systemic corticosteroids or other 
immunosuppressants before the start of pembrolizumab treatment should be avoided because of their 
potential interference with the pharmacodynamic activity and efficacy of pembrolizumab. However, 
systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants can be used after starting pembrolizumab 
treatment to treat immune-mediated adverse reactions. Corticosteroids can also be used as 
premedication, when pembrolizumab is used in combination with chemotherapy, as antiemetic 
prophylaxis and/or to alleviate chemotherapy-related adverse reactions.

Post marketing experience 
The safety profile of pembrolizumab was summarized in the Periodic Safety Update Report covering the 
period 04-SEP-2021 through 03-SEP-2022. No revocation or withdrawal of pembrolizumab registration 
for safety reasons has occurred in any country. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The MAH provided safety data from KN811 study (n=350 experimental treatment, n=346 control), and 
included for comparisons the pooled chemo combo dataset (n=3123) and the pembrolizumab 
monotherapy reference safety dataset (RSD) (n=7631).  
It should be noted that data from 3,473 patients is the sum of the previous pooled combo dataset 
(3,123) plus the newly added pembro+chemo arm in KEYNOTE-811 (350). 
Regarding exposure, in KEYNOTE-811 the median duration of therapy in the pembrolizumab plus SOC 
was longer than all other datasets. The percentage of participants with ≥6 and ≥12 months duration of 
exposure was longer in the pembrolizumab plus SOC as compared to the control group, while similar to 
the pembro combo dataset.  
While the demographic and baseline characteristics in KEYNOTE-811 were generally well balanced 
between the two treatment groups, more participants in KEYNOTE-811 were male and Asian, and 
fewer participants were enrolled from EU sites as compared to pembrolizumab combo and 
pembrolizumab monotherapy datasets, as expected based on the epidemiology of gastric/GEJ cancer. 
The AE rates in the pembrolizumab + SOC group were generally consistent with the control arm, 
although few more G3-5 AEs (all-causality and drug-related) were observed. There were little more 
discontinuations due to AEs, drug-related AEs and drug-related SAE. When adjusted for exposure, 
however, the differences between the two treatment arms of KN-811 do not seem relevant. As 
compared to the pembro combo dataset, increased rate of discontinuation is observed, which is 
however mostly due to discontinuation of chemotherapy. As expected, the pembrolizumab+SOC group 
of KN811 presented safety profile reflective of AEs for the combination of trastuzumab, chemotherapy 
and pembrolizumab in comparison with pembrolizumab monotherapy.  
In the pembrolizumab plus SOC group, the most frequently reported AEs regardless of causality 
(≥20% incidence) were diarrhoea, nausea, anaemia, vomiting, decreased appetite, neutrophil count 
decreased, platelet count decreased, AST increased, peripheral sensory neuropathy, fatigue, palmar-
plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome, and weight decreased, which were reported with similar 
incidences in SOC group.  
The most frequently reported drug-related AEs (≥20% incidence) in the pembrolizumab plus SOC 
group were diarrhea, nausea, anemia, neutrophil count decreased, decreased appetite, platelet count 
decreased, vomiting, peripheral sensory neuropathy, and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia 
syndrome, with similar incidences reported in the SOC group. 
The most common Grade 3 to 5 AEs regardless of causality (>5% incidence) in the pembrolizumab 
plus SOC group were anaemia, diarrhoea, neutrophil count decreased, neutropenia, platelet count 
decreased, and hypokalaemia, which were reported with similar incidences in SOC group. 
The most frequently reported drug-related Grade 3 to 5 events (≥5% incidence) in the pembrolizumab 
plus SOC group were diarrhoea, neutrophil count decreased, neutropenia, platelet count decreased, 
and anaemia, with similar incidences in the SOC group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/359366/2023  
Page 110/119 
 
 
 
The most frequently reported SAEs (≥2% incidence) in the pembrolizumab plus SOC group were 
pneumonia, diarrhea, pulmonary embolism, infusion-related reaction, pneumonitis, and vomiting.  
The most frequently reported drug-related SAE (≥3% incidence) in both the pembrolizumab plus SOC 
and SOC groups was diarrhea (4.6% and 4.3% of participants, respectively).   
The most common AEs (≥1% incidence) leading to discontinuation of pembrolizumab in the 
pembrolizumab plus SOC group were pneumonitis (1.7%) and pneumonia (1.1%), and the most 
common drug-related AE leading to discontinuation of any drug were peripheral sensory 
neuropathy/neuropathy peripheral in both arms (about 10%), while the leading AE for discontinuation 
of pembrolizumab was pneumonitis (1.4%). The most common AEs (≥10% incidence) leading to 
treatment interruption of any drug in the pembrolizumab plus SOC group were neutrophil count 
decreased, diarrhoea, platelet count decreased, and neutropenia, with similar incidences in the SOC 
group.  
With regard to laboratory value, the MAH reported two participants in the pembrolizumab plus SOC 
arm meeting the laboratory criteria for drug-induced liver injury (vs 1 in the control arm). 
Furthermore, a higher incidence of ALT, AST and bilirubin increase as AEs was noted in the 
experimental vs the control arm, and in some cases also as compared to the pembrolizumab combo 
pooled dataset. Upon request, the MAH reviewed the hepatic toxicity in KEYNOTE-811. Based on the 
data provided, it is agreed that the hepatic-related AEs require neither a change in the characterization 
of this risk for pembrolizumab nor an update of the SmPC. 
A total of 22 vs 20 patients died due to AEs in the investigational vs control arm of KN811 study. Of 
those, 5 AEs were treatment-related according to investigator or sponsor, i.e. pneumonitis (2 cases), 
hepatitis, sepsis and cerebral infarction. Pneumonitis is a known ADR for pembrolizumab. Cerebral 
infarction was considered by the investigator related to pembrolizumab, but not to chemotherapy nor 
trastuzumab. Cerebral infarction it is not a known AE of pembrolizumab. At request of the CHMP, a 
review of cerebral infarction events was performed in the Company Global Safety Database. Based on 
the data provided, it is agreed that causality assessment was confounded by pre-existing or concurrent 
conditions that represent known risk factors for cerebral infarction, i.e. hypertension, hyperlipidemia, 
diabetes, atherosclerosis, coagulation abnormality associated with underlying malignancy. Based on 
the data provided, no changes in the SmPC are considered warranted at this stage. This event should 
be monitored in the future. 
As expected, the overall incidence of AEOSI was higher in the pembrolizumab plus SOC group 
compared with the SOC group, but overall similar to pembrolizumab + chemotherapy dataset. The 
median time to onset of the first AEOSI in the pembrolizumab plus SOC group was 67 days, similar to 
both pembrolizumab combo and pembrolizumab mono datasets. Median duration of AEOSI episodes 
(41 days) is similar to the pembrolizumab combo dataset but shorter than pembrolizumab 
monotherapy. Overall, most AEOSI were Grade 1 or 2 in severity and nonserious. Grade 5 AEOSI 
occurred in 3 (0.9%) participants in the pembrolizumab plus SOC group (2 patients with pneumonitis 
and 1 with hepatitis). Most of the AEOSI in the pembrolizumab plus SOC arm resolved (58.3%). The 
most common (>5% incidence) AEOSI categories reported in the pembrolizumab plus SOC group were 
infusion reactions, hypothyroidism, and pneumonitis (16.0%, 10.6%, and 6.0%, respectively). The 
frequency and severity of AEOSI categories in the pembrolizumab plus SOC group were generally 
consistent with the pembrolizumab plus chemo pooled group and monotherapy RSD, with the 
exceptions of pneumonitis (6% vs 1.4% vs 4% vs 4.2%) and infusion-related reactions (16% vs 13% 
vs 7.9% vs 2.2%). A higher frequency of pneumonitis and infusion-related reactions was expected 
with the addition of trastuzumab and oxaliplatin to pembrolizumab since these are known risks of the 
SOC combination, as well as due to longer exposure, based on exposure-adjusted data (not shown). A 
higher incidence of colitis as AEOSI category is noted as compared to the other datasets (4.9% vs 
Assessment report  
EMA/359366/2023  
Page 111/119 
 
 
 
2.9% vs 2.7% vs 2.1%), but no meaningful difference is observed after adjusting for exposure. 
Overall, no additional warnings regarding these toxicities are considered needed in the SmPC. 
Taking into account the known cardiotoxicity of trastuzumab, the MAH provided data specific for such 
toxicity as well as an evaluation of LVEF decrease. The MAH noted that the prescribing information for 
trastuzumab shows 2% of patients experiencing congestive heart failure events and a range from 4% 
(for monotherapy) to 28% (in combination with chemotherapy) of patients experiencing cardiac 
dysfunction following treatment with trastuzumab. Based on the data provided, it is agreed that the 
frequency of cardiac events observed in KEYNOTE-811 is consistent with these results, and no increase 
in cardiac events for the combination of pembrolizumab with trastuzumab is envisaged. 
The adverse event summary showed similar incidence in the pembrolizumab plus SOC arm between 
patients <65 years and ≥ 65 years, with the exception of death due to AEs and discontinuation due to 
AEs. A similar pattern is however observed also in the SOC arm, as well as in the pembrolizumab 
combo pooled dataset. The same observation is made according to age categories <65, 65-74 and 75-
84. Only 28 patients however were over 75 in the experimental arm.  
The MAH was requested by the CHMP to review the AEs occurring in the CPS<1 subset, as the pattern 
of crossing OS curves raised concern from a safety perspective, acknowledging that this PD-L1 
negative patients are nevertheless excluded from the indication. Based on the data provided, the 
events of death due to AEs (in terms of frequency and causes), do not raise additional safety concern 
that may impact on the indication for the combination.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy (FP/CAPOX) and trastuzumab 
in previously untreated participants with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive 
gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma in KEYNOTE-811 overall reflects the established safety profiles of the 
chemotherapy regimen administered and pembrolizumab monotherapy. The addition of pembrolizumab 
does not appear to increase cardiac toxicity associated with the established safety profile of 
trastuzumab and the SOC regimens. No new safety concerns were identified.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a result of this variation, section(s) 4.1, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are being updated. The Package 
Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
There are two changes in the package leaflet for this submission: section 1 (addition of new indication) 
and in section 4 (minor changes to align to update in 4.8 section of the SmPC). The key messages for 
the safe use of the medicinal product are however not impacted. Furthermore, the design, layout and 
format of the package leaflet will not be affected by the proposed revisions. Therefore, the proposed 
revision does not constitute significant changes that would require the need to conduct a new user 
consultation.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
HER-2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma at an advanced stage of disease. 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma 
KEYTRUDA, in combination with trastuzumab, fluoropyrimidine and platinum-containing chemotherapy, 
is indicated for the first-line treatment of locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive 
gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 with a 
CPS ≥ 1. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Chemotherapy plus trastuzumab represents the current SOC for the front-line approach to locally 
advanced and metastatic HER-2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma (ESMO guidelines 2022). 
However, prognosis remains poor with survival generally below 1 year, which makes development of 
new therapies a high unmet medical need.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The current variation is supported by data from KEYNOTE-811, a Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled trial Comparing Trastuzumab Plus Chemotherapy and Pembrolizumab With 
Trastuzumab Plus Chemotherapy and Placebo as First-line Treatment in Participants With HER2 
Positive Advanced Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma.   
3.2.  Favourable effects 
-The efficacy analysis in the ITT population, showed advantage of pembrolizumab over placebo in the 
primary endpoint PFS (HR=0.72; 95% CI 0.60;0.87; p<0.0002) with a 2-month gain in disease 
progression (10 vs 8.1 months in median in the pembrolizumab and control arm, respectively)  
-In the CPS ≥1 subgroup, pembrolizumab showed superiority over placebo in PFS (HR=0.70; 95% CI 
0.58, 0.85) and OS (HR=0.79; 95% CI 0.64,0.98; p=0.0143), with a gain in median PFS and OS of 3 
months (10.8 vs 7.2) and 5 months (20.5 vs 15.6), respectively. 
-The ORR analysis showed advantage of pembrolizumab over placebo in the ITT population (72.6% vs 
59.8%) with a slightly better response duration (11.2 vs 9 months in median) 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
None.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
- In the pembrolizumab plus SOC group, the most frequently reported AEs regardless of causality  (≥
20% incidence) were diarrhoea, nausea, anaemia, vomiting, decreased appetite, neutrophil count 
decreased, platelet count decreased, AST increased, peripheral sensory neuropathy, fatigue, palmar-
plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome, and weight decreased, with similar incidences reported in the 
SOC group, suggesting that the overall safety profile of the proposed combination is mostly influenced 
by the common chemotherapy backbone. The overall pattern of drug-related AEs was consistent with 
the overall safety analysis.  
- The pattern of Grade 3-5 AEs (all causality and drug related) was similar in the two treatment arms. 
The most common all-causality Grade 3 to 5 AEs (>5% incidence) in the pembrolizumab plus SOC 
group were anaemia, diarrhoea, neutrophil count decreased, neutropenia, platelet count decreased, 
and hypokalaemia. 
- SAEs were observed in similar percentage between treatment arms, with diarrhoea being the most 
common treatment-related SAE in both arms.  
- There were few more discontinuation of study drugs due to adverse events in the 
pembrolizumab+SOC arm as compared to the control arm (40.6% vs 36.4%), although mostly leading 
to discontinuation of chemotherapy. 
- Pembrolizumab is characterized by the occurrence of immune-mediated adverse events. The rate of 
AEOSI was, as expected, higher in the pembrolizumab containing arm as compared to the control arm 
(37.7% vs 24%), but not very different to the pembro+chemo pooled dataset (33.7%). Most common 
(>5%) AEOSI were infusion related reactions (11.7%), hypothyroidism (10.6%) and pneumonitis 
(5.4%). Infusion-related reaction AEOSI were reported in a similar proportion in both treatment arms, 
but were more common than in the reference safety datasets of both pembro combo and pembro 
mono. This may be likely related to the contribution of trastuzumab and oxaliplatin, having known 
risks of infusion-related reactions. Pneumonitis and hypothyroidism AEOSI were both higher in the 
pembrolizumab plus SOC group compared with the SOC group. However, pneumonitis was also more 
commonly reported than in the pembrolizumab reference datasets, possibly due to trastuzumab which 
has known risk of pneumonitis, while incidence of hypothyroidism was similar to the reference 
datasets. 
- Deaths due to AEs occurred in 6.3% vs 5.8% of patients in the pembrolizumab+SOC vs 
placebo+SOC arm of KEYNOTE-811. Treatment-related deaths were due to pneumonitis, hepatitis, 
sepsis, and cerebral infarction in the pembrolizumab + SOC arm. Both pneumonitis and hepatitis are 
known ADR for pembrolizumab. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
- Similar incidence of AEs are observed in the pembrolizumab plus SOC arm according to age 
categories, with the exception of death due to AEs and discontinuation due to AEs. A similar pattern is 
however observed also in the SOC arm, as well as in the pembro combo pooled dataset. Only 28 
patients however were over 75 in the experimental arm, limiting conclusion in this subset.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In the ITT population, pembrolizumab as add-on to chemotherapy and trastutzumab demonstrated a 
statistically significant improvement in median PFS but not in median OS compared to the control arm. 
In the subgroup of patients with CPS<1 no benefit from the addition of pembrolizumab was observed. 
The MAH’s proposal for a restriction of the indication to the CPS ≥1 population is in line with the EMA 
guidelines on the investigation of subgroups in confirmatory clinical trials. Indeed, the study was 
formally successful since a statistically significant effect in the ITT population on one of the two 
components of the dual endpoint was demonstrated; however, the therapeutic efficacy or risk-benefit 
is borderline and clearly not proven in the CPS<1 group, thus reflecting Scenario 2 of the guideline. In 
patients with CPS ≥1, the addition of pembrolizumab to trastuzumab plus chemotherapy improved the 
median PFS (HR=0.70; 95% CI 0.58, 0.85, with a 3-month gain compared to placebo) and the median 
OS (HR=0.79; 95% CI 0.64, 0.98; p=0.0143, with a 5-month gain compared to placebo).  
Overall, the safety profile of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy (FP/CAPOX) and 
trastuzumab in the first line treatment of patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic 
HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma in KEYNOTE-811 reflects the established safety profiles 
of the chemotherapy regimen administered and pembrolizumab monotherapy. No new safety concerns 
have been identified.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Considering the poor prognosis of patients in the intended indication, the improved median PFS and OS 
demonstrated by pembrolizumab as add-on to SOC in the CPS≥1 subgroup can be considered of 
clinical relevance. From a safety perspective, the increased toxicity associated to treatment compared 
to placebo appears manageable.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
N/A 
3.7.4.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Keytruda in combination with trastuzumab, fluoropyrimidine and platinum-
containing chemotherapy, for the first-line treatment of locally advanced unresectable or metastatic 
HER2-positive gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma in adults whose tumours 
express PD-L1 with a CPS ≥ 1 is positive.

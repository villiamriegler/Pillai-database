1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Regeneron Ireland U.C. submitted on 6 March 2018 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for LIBTAYO, through the centralised procedure 
falling within the Article 3(1) and point 1 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: LIBTAYO as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment 
of patients with metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or patients with locally advanced 
cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma who are not candidates for surgery. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical 
and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included  EMA Decision 
P/0385/2017 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0385/2017 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication. 
Applicant’s request(s) for consideration 
Accelerated assessment 
The applicant requested accelerated assessment in  accordance to Article 14(9) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance cemiplimab contained in the above medicinal product to be 
considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a medicinal 
product previously authorised within the European Union.

Scientific advice 
The applicant received Scientific Advice on the development relevant for the approved indication from the 
CHMP on 25 February 2015. The Scientific Advice pertained to the following quality, non-clinical and 
clinical aspects of the dossier: 
 
 
the  overall  nonclinical  toxicology  program  to  support  the  clinical  development  and  marketing 
authorisation of Libtayo. 
the study design for R2810-ONC-1540, including the patient population (i.e. separation of the 
metastatic/locally advanced cohorts, absence of requirement for prior systemic therapy, criteria 
for prior radiation therapy for locally advanced CSCC and definition of resectability of the patients 
with locally advanced CSCC), the acceptability of ORR as primary endpoint and whether the study 
as designed, would be sufficient to support full or conditional marketing authorisation.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) is a disease arising from the malignant transformation and 
proliferation of epidermal keratinocytes with invasion of the dermis and is distinguished from 
non-invasive precursor lesions such as actinic keratoses1. For most patients with CSCC, surgery is the 
recommended line of treatment which can lead to curative intent. However, for a small percentage of 
patients who develop metastatic CSCC or locally advanced CSCC, collectively referred to as advanced 
CSCC, the disease can be devastating and life threatening. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Worldwide incidence of CSCC varies widely, with the highest incidence in Australia and the lowest 
incidence in parts of Africa2. In Nordic countries including Norway, Finland, and Denmark, the 
age-standardized incidence rate of CSCC was less than 10/100,000 person-years before the 1990s. 
However, the age-standardized incidence rate in these countries reached approximately 15/100,000 
person-years in the last decade. In Switzerland, Sweden, South Wales, Germany, and the Netherlands, 
the age-standardized incidence rate was reported to be around 20/100,000 person-years or higher. In 
Europe, Ireland had the highest age-standardized incidence rate as reported in the literature, which was 
37.6/100,000 person-years from 1994 to 2003. The exact incidence of CSCC is unknown, but it has been 
reported to be from 8.9 to 37.6/100,000 person-years in different European countries3 ,4 ,5 ,6 ,7. These 
differences suggest that comprehensiveness of case recording may account more for incidence variability 
rather than phenotypic variability8.  The incidence of CSCC seems to have increased over the past 30 
years by 50 and up to 200%, with stabilization trends or slower rates of increase in certain countries2. 
When only invasive forms are taken into account, it is the second most common form of non-melanoma 
skin cancer and accounts for 20% of all cutaneous malignancies9.

immunosuppressive treatment, exposure to radiation and other industrial carcinogens, and smoking. 
Chronic inflammation and rare inherited disorders also are associated with an increased risk of cutaneous 
SCC10, 11,  12. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
CSCCs are common lesions that are cured with local therapy (surgical excision, cryotherapy, 
electrosurgery, and radiation therapy) in over 90 percent of cases. A recent analysis on surgical 
interventions for CSCC showed that the local recurrence rates were 3.0% following Mohs surgery and 
5.4% after standard surgical excision13 . Most local recurrences can be removed surgically, and less than 
5% of patients with CSCC develop disease that cannot be cured surgically14, 15. 
CSCC  can  metastasize  initially  to  regional  lymph  nodes  and  subsequently  to  distant  sites,  rate  of 
metastasis being from 2% to 5% as a cautious estimation. Despite its low distant metastatic potential, the 
presence of distant metastasis is associated with a dismal prognosis and a median survival of less than 2 
years16. Delayed diagnosis or inadequate treatment can result in increased morbidity or death. The risk of 
local regional recurrence and regional or distant metastasis is the most important factor in determining 
the approach to the treatment of CSCC. 
2.1.5.  Management 
The major treatment options for CSCC with features that suggest a low-risk for recurrence and metastasis 
are surgical excision, cryotherapy, electrosurgery, and radiation therapy. The specific choice of treatment 
modality depends upon the experience of the clinician, the expected cure rate, cosmetic factors, and 
patient preference. Topical chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or imiquimod and photodynamic 
therapy are additional treatment options for patients with Bowen's disease (CSCC in situ). Radiation 
therapy is an additional option for the management of primary CSCCs in older patients and those who are 
not surgical candidates. Careful follow-up is required to evaluate for evidence of local recurrence, regional 
or distant metastasis, and treatment-related complications. 
Although the probability of surgical cure for most patients with CSCC is high, the disease course is 
devastating for the small percentage of patients who develop metastatic CSCC or locally advanced CSCC, 
collectively referred to as advanced CSCC. There is no approved systemic treatment for advanced CSCC 
and there are no guidelines available for locally advanced and metastatic CSCC. As a summary, 
management guidelines on invasive CSCC by European Dermatology Forum (EDF) – European 
Association of Dermato-Oncology (EADO) – European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 
(EORTC) expert panel16 are the following: 
•  Mono- or poly-chemotherapy can be used in metastatic cSCC; however, there is no established 
standard regimen and responses are usually short-lived 
• 
Targeted therapies, such as Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, either in 
combination with chemotherapy or in the neo-adjuvant setting, have shown encouraging results 
in locally advanced or metastatic CSCC and their use is encouraged in the setting of clinical trials

new therapies. The largest prospective studies in the last 15 years for patients with advanced CSCC are 
studies evaluating EGFR-targeting agents, illustrating the dire prognosis of this disease. The response

rate with cetuximab (N = 36) was 28%, and median OS was 8.1 months19. The response rate with 
panitumumab (N = 16) was 31%, and median OS was 11 months20. Cytotoxic chemotherapies, mostly 
platinum-based, were evaluated in older studies that did not utilize independent central review of tumour 
responses. Two studies of platinum + 5-fluorouracil (PF)-based chemotherapy enrolled 14 and 7 
advanced CSCC patients and were unable to provide conclusive evidence of therapeutic advantage21, 22. 
The triplet regimen of cisplatin + interferon alpha + 13-cis-retinoic acid (N = 39 patients enrolled, 35 
evaluable for response) showed a response rate of 34% and a median OS of 14.6 months 23. This regimen 
did not provide compelling evidence of therapeutic benefit and was not further developed. Overall, use of 
commercially available treatments is limited by inconclusive efficacy data and substantial safety risks due 
to the advanced age of the CSCC population. Therefore, there is an unmet medical need for an effective 
treatment option with an acceptable safety profile in patients with advanced CSCC. 
About the product 
Cemiplimab is a fully human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody that binds to the 
programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor and blocks its interaction with its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. 
Engagement of PD-1 with its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, which are expressed by antigen presenting cells 
and may be expressed by tumour cells and/or other cells in the tumour microenvironment, results in 
inhibition of T cell function such as proliferation, cytokine secretion, and cytotoxic activity. Cemiplimab 
potentiates T cell responses, including anti-tumour responses, through blockade of PD-1 binding to PD-L1 
and PD-L2 ligands.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Cemiplimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody (IgG4 isotype), a covalent heterotetramer consisting of 
two disulfide-linked human heavy chains, each covalently linked through a disulfide bond to a human 
kappa  light  chain.  The  antibody,  based  on  the  primary  sequence  (in  the  absence  of  N-linked 
glycosylation), has a molecular weight of 143,567.1 Da (chemical formula C6380H9808N1688O2000S44), taking 
into account the formation of 16 disulfide bonds and removal of Lys444 from each heavy chain terminus. 
The  complementarity  determining  regions  (CDRs)  within  the  heavy  and  light  chain  variable  domains 
combine to form the binding sites of cemiplimab to its target, PD-1 (human programmed cell death-1).  
General information is provided on the nomenclature, sequence and schematic structure with location of 
the disulfide bonds and Fc N-linked glycosylation site. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Manufacturer   
The  manufacture  of  cemiplimab  takes  place  at  Regeneron  Pharmaceuticals,  81  Columbia  Turnpike, 
Rensselaer, 12144, NY, USA until formulated active substance (FAS). Testing is performed by sites in the 
US and Ireland. The manufacturing and testing facilities are listed with company name and addresses as 
appropriate. Valid GMP certificates are provided. The virus tests are also performed by Regeneron and an 
approved contract lab.  
Description of the manufacturing process and process controls 
Cemiplimab is produced by a cell culture process using recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. 
The process begins with thawing a frozen vial of the working cell bank (WCB) and expanding through a 
series of seed train bioreactors. 
The recombinant protein product is harvested. Cemiplimab protein is then purified using a series of 
chromatographic and membrane filtration techniques. To prepare cemiplimab FAS, the AS is  
compounded to the desired concentration and formulation with the addition of a concentrated excipient 
buffer. 
The upstream manufacturing process for cemiplimab is comparable in process steps and scale for seed 
train and bioreactor to what is common for monoclonal antibodies. The process flow is presented in table 
format where the process step, stage and function is described in conjunction with the process conditions 
(in target values).  
The virus inactivation steps are low pH and virus-retentive filtration were validated based on applicable 
industry standards.  
The  resin  and  filter  lifetimes  and  the  duration  of  each  manufacturing  step  and  the  hold  times  are 
validated.  
The  manufacture  and  formulation,  and  the  holding  times  are  supported  by  the  stability  studies.  The 
stability of the AS during freeze-thaw cycles is also supported by the stability studies. 
The cleaning process for the material is appropriate.

A  short  concise  description  of  the  function,  elements  and  in-process  control  sampling  points  of  each 
manufacturing step is given, including the validated allowed duration of the individual step. 
For the entire process, the in-process controls are adequately discussed in the manufacturing process 
development section.  
Container closure 
The  container  closure  systems  for  cemiplimab  AS  and  FAS  are  polycarbonate  (PC)  bottles  with  a 
silicone-lined polypropylene screw cap, respectively. 
The suitability of the container closure system is demonstrated including a leachables study confirming no 
leachables at or above the analytical evaluation threshold (AET) for the duration of the shelf life.  
The suitability and safety of the primary AS container closure system is considered to be demonstrated. 
Control of materials  
Sufficient  information  on  raw  materials  used  in  the  manufacturing  process  has  been  submitted. 
Compendial raw materials are tested according with the corresponding monograph, while specifications 
(including test methods) for non-compendial raw materials are present. 
All raw materials are enrolled in a material qualification program, in which an evaluation of virological and 
TSE safety as well as chemical and microbiological testing and assessment of leachables/extractables is 
performed as applicable.  
Animal derived raw materials were used during early cell line development only. There was no direct use 
of animal derived materials in the preparation of the cemiplimab MCB or WCBs nor in the manufacturing 
process  of  cemiplimab  other  than  the  CHO  production  cells.  Based  on  the  virological  and  TSE  safety 
assessment performed, the applicant concludes that the risk of contamination by adventitious agents is 
remote. This conclusion is supported by the documentation provided. 
A thorough risk assessment of extractables and leachables from all components used in the cemiplimab 
manufacturing  process  has  been  performed,  taking  into  account  the  level  of  exposure  to  the  process 
stream  and  product.  Based  on  the  risk  assessment  performed,  it  is  concluded  that  the  risk  for  the 
presence  of  leachables  in  cemiplimab  finished  product  at  levels,  which  exceed  the  recommended 
exposure limits is low, and that no further mitigation nor monitoring of leachables is required. 
Source, history and generation of cell substrate 
The  anti-PD1  antibody  REGN2810  was  generated  by  establishment  of  hybridomas  through  standard 
methods.  Hybridomas  were  selected  based  on  binding  specificity  and  inhibition  of  PD-1  activity.  The 
variable  regions  of  the  heavy  and  light  chains  of  REGN2810  were  polymerase  chain  reaction  (PCR) 
amplified  and  cloned  into  two  individual  expression  plasmids,  designated  pRGN7541  and  pRGN7571, 
respectively. The pRGN7541 and pRGB7571 plasmids were transfected into a CHO host cell line. 
Master and working cell banks 
The  cemiplimab  MCB  was  established  through  expansion  of  cells  from  the  development  cell  bank.  No 
animal derived raw materials were used in the preparation or storage of the MCB.  
The  MCB  testing  was  performed  in  accordance  with  ICH  guidelines  (i.e.  ICH  Q5D  and  ICH  Q5A).  The 
results  of  the testing  complied  with  the  acceptance criteria  and  documented  the  integrity  and  correct 
sequence of the REGN2810 genes and mRNA transcripts. 
Cemiplimab  WCBs  have  been  generated  from  MCB.  No  animal  derived  raw  materials  were  used  for 
preparation nor storage of the WCBs. The testing was performed mostly in accordance with ICH Q5D and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/368468/2019  
Page 16/163 
 
 
 
ICH Q5A. The results complies with the acceptance criteria. Stability of the WCBs is tested once a year 
with the same acceptance criteria as set for the cemiplimab MCB.  
Further testing for the absence of virological contaminants was performed at the end of production cells 
(EPC),  cultured  to  the  limit  of  in  vitro  age  (LIVCA).  No  evidence  of  infectious  viral  or  non-viral 
contamination was observed at this level. Genetic characterisation of the EPC was performed. 
The results of genetic characterisation of the MCB, the WCBs and EPCs demonstrated genetic stability of 
the production cell line, as the correct coding sequence of cemiplimab was maintained in the MCB, WCBs 
and  throughout  the  production  run.  Specifications  for  MCB,  WCB,  and  EPCs  are  aligned  with  the 
characterisation tests. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates  
The control of critical steps and intermediates of cemiplimab is performed under an In-Process control 
program which consist of  the process monitoring activities performed to confirm that operational and 
performance parameters (process inputs) and attributes (process outputs) are maintained within justified 
and/or validated limits or ranges.  
The in-process control (IPC) program is based on the Quality by Design (QbD) approach. The selection of 
operational and performance parameters (process inputs) and attributes (process outputs) as In-Process 
Controls are described and adequately justified for the commercial GMP manufacturing process.  
Process performance qualification (PPQ) lots were used to establish the IPC program covering the seed 
expansion through the sucrose adjusted AS. A process performance monitoring plan (PPM) is made which 
defines the appropriate monitoring tools for each IPC including statistical process controls. The PPM is 
continuously monitoring the IPC program during the life cycle management of cemiplimab.  
The applied process controls have been divided into operational and performance parameters (process 
inputs)  and  performance  attributes  (process  outputs)  which  are  maintained  within  justified  and/or 
validated limits or ranges, and trending of performance over time via statistical process control (SPC), 
where appropriate. The QbD approach used by the applicant was not considered to be fully in line with the 
definition given in ICH Q8 (R2): “A process parameter whose variability has an impact on a critical quality 
attribute and therefore should be monitored or controlled to ensure the process produces the desired 
quality”. The applicant was reminded that a process parameter that has an impact on a CQA per definition 
remains critical independently of detectability, controllability and occurrence. The applicant has confirmed 
that for every proposed change to process parameters and quality attribute, the appropriate variation 
procedure will be determined in accordance with EU regulation, which is accepted. 
Process validation  
The  commercial  manufacturing  process  for  cemiplimab  AS  has  been  validated.  In  general,  the  PPQ 
batches have been manufactured within the defined ranges for critical and general process parameters. 
Process validation has been performed against predefined limits from historical batches.  
The  applicant  has  provided  a  clear  summary  of  Proven  Acceptable  Range  (PAR)  studies  including  the 
studied parameter ranges as well as the data justifying the final operational ranges. 
The impurity clearances of process and product related impurities have been adequately demonstrated. 
For viral clearance, model viruses representing a wide range of physicochemical characteristics, were 
used to test the ability of purification steps. Virus clearance studies were performed for each individual 
step, using spiked process material. The mechanism of virus removal/inactivation differs between the  
steps tested, for which reason they are considered as orthogonal. In conclusion, the design of the virus 
clearance studies were considered to be in accordance with ICH Q5A and the results obtained acceptable.

Manufacturing process development  
A QbD approach  has been used in the optimisation process for the changes  made between the initial 
manufacturing  process,  used  for  the  non-clinical  and  clinical  phases,  and  the  intended  commercial 
process.  The  comparability  between  the  clinical  and  commercial  manufacturing  processes  has  been 
studied and is considered adequately documented.  
Pilot scale activities prior to the technology transfer which cover AS manufacture until formulation have 
been described.  
Preliminary Critical Quality Attributes (pCQA) were defined for the pilot scale by the QbD approach with 
the  cross-functional  risk  assessment.  When  these  pCQA  were  met  by  the  commercial  process,  the 
optimisation of the manufacturing process was continued with high level risk assessment defining pCQA 
and preliminary General Quality Attributes (pGCA) for measure of process consistency. The low level risk 
analysis  defines,  through  multivariate  process  models,  the  factors  and  responses  that  influences  the 
pCQA.  The  impacting  factors  are  defined  as  preliminary  Critical  Process  Parameters  (pCPP)  when  the 
impact on the CQA is beyond the acceptable range. The design and scale robustness was verified through 
scale up and process confirmation batch runs.  
The  pCQA  definition  and  ranges  were  established  leveraging  (i)  product  quality  from  historical 
manufacturing capability for the clinical process, (ii) preclinical data with clinical material, (iii) extensive 
product characterisation of clinical material, (iv) preclinical and clinical experience with similar Regeneron 
monoclonal antibodies leveraging same proprietary cell line technologies and (v) peer reviewed literature 
data.  
The pCQAs related to product and process were identified. The terminology used by the applicant for 
process parameters (PPs) and quality attributes (QAs) are not fully in line with the terminology used in 
ICH Q8. The applicant has confirmed that for every proposed change to process parameters and quality 
attribute, the appropriate variation procedure will be determined in accordance with EU regulation, which 
is accepted. 
Clinical manufacturing process development and comparability with commercial process 
The early clinical trials were supplied by the clinical process material. Comparability with the commercial 
process has been demonstrated by orthogonal techniques evaluating lots of each process.  
Characterisation 
The characterisation of the structural, physiochemical and biological properties of cemiplimab has been 
performed with state-of-the-art analytical methods.  
Cell-based, functional, PD-1 bioassays were also set up to study the biological activity of cemiplimab. 
Multiple lots manufactured in 2016 by the commercial manufacturing process and one lot manufactured 
using the clinical manufacturing process were characterized as part of the comparability exercise between 
the manufacturing processes. The description of the physicochemical properties of the protein making up 
cemiplimab  is  presented  with  an  appropriate  level  of  detail,  an  appropriate  method  description  and 
references to literature on corresponding IgG4 characterisation. The  samples analysed are highly similar 
throughout all analysis including charge variants and glycosylation profiles known to be affected by many 
manufacturing process parameters. The characterisation results of the  samples give the impression of a 
well-controlled manufacturing process throughout the development program and process validation. 
Functional cell-based bioassays documented that all cemiplimab lots tested were comparable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/368468/2019  
Page 18/163 
 
 
 
As part of product-related impurities high molecular weight species (HMW), low molecular weight species 
(LMW), charge variants, and oxidised species were examined. In general, all relevant product related 
impurity variants were considered. 
Process related impurities has been addressed in sufficient detail.  
Specification 
The release and end of shelf-life specifications for formulated AS includes appropriate physicochemical 
tests and tests for identity, potency, and purity. 
Analytical procedures and reference standards 
The analytical methods are considered to be state of the art and acceptable.  
It is noted that for the characterisation of AS purity orthogonal methods are used and the more sensitive 
method is chosen for the release test of the HMW- and LMW- variants.  
The presentation of the validation of the analytical methods used for the IPC of cemiplimab AS and release 
test of cemiplimab FDS is sufficiently detailed and found appropriate. 
Reference standard 
A primary-and working-standard is established. Description of generation, characterisation and testing of 
the primary- and working standard is provided and do not call for additional comments. Initial certification 
and possible extension is supported by ongoing stability annual monitoring.  
Batch analysis 
Batch release data are provided for FAS and AS manufactured by the commercial process. All test results 
are within specifications.  
It is noted from the complete batch data including the results of the tests that are later omitted for release 
testing, that the more sensitive methods for the detection of the HMW and LMW variants are used when 
comparing the results. 
Stability 
A shelf life is proposed for the AS and FAS.  
Data from primary stability studies and supporting stability studies are available. Stability test results 
meet the commercial acceptance criteria at the long-term storage condition for all primary and supporting 
stability lots. Overall the data obtained to date, indicate that cemiplimab AS and FAS are stable when 
stored  at  the  proposed  long-term  storage  temperatures.  The  stability  studies  have  been  performed 
according to ICH Q5C. 
Release  testing  and  extended  characterisation  testing  has  demonstrated  that  cemiplimab  AS 
manufactured from the commercial manufacturing process is comparable to the quality of cemiplimab AS 
produced using the clinical manufacturing process. The applicant has provided updated stability study 
results  from  their  on-going  stability  studies  which  supports  the  proposed  shelf-life.  Furthermore, 
appropriate justification for the proposed testing intervals in the post-approval stability protocol, with 
appropriate explanation for why they are not according to stability guideline, are provided.  
The  stability  studies  of  the  primary  and  supporting cemiplimab  AS  and  FAS  batches  at  the  long-term 
storage  will  be  completed  according  to  the  stability  protocol.  A  commitment  is  provided  to  place  a 
minimum of one batch of cemiplimab AS and FAS on long-term stability at the recommended storage

condition every year of manufacturing. The batches will be tested according to the analysis plan and the 
results must meet the end-of-shelf-life specifications.  
Accelerated and stressed conditions stability studies have been performed according to ICH Q5C. The 
results obtained from these studies support the relevance of the selected stability indicating parameters.  
Photostability  studies,  forced  degradation  studies  and  freeze-thaw  studies  have  been  performed 
according to relevant guidelines.  
In conclusion, the stability results indicate that the AS and FAS are sufficiently stable and justify the 
proposed shelf life in the proposed container.

Libtayo finished product is packed in 10 ml clear Type 1 glass vial with a grey chlorobutyl stopper with 
FluroTec coating and seal cap with a flip-off button. Each carton contains 1 vial. Not all pack sizes may be 
marketed.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been  validated  by  stability  data  and  is 
adequately described for the intended use of the product. 
Pharmaceutical development 
Formulation  development  has  been  appropriately  described  and  the  rationale  for  the  selection  of  the 
formulation adequately addressed and justified. Different cemiplimab FP formulations were tested during 
clinical development. Cemiplimab at a concentration of 50 mg/ml was selected for the final FP formulation 
for IV infusion.  
Manufacturing process development has been described in detail. All of the FP manufacturing processes 
during  development  utilized  similar  processing  steps  including  thawing,  pooling,  and  mixing  of  the 
formulated  active  substance  (FAS),  sterilising  filtration,  and  aseptic  filling  and  stoppering  of  the  final 
container. The acceptable batch size was updated, based on the validated batch size determined during 
PPQ. Minor process changes were also made to mixing times and process hold times based on process 
validation activities. 
The results of the FP comparability studies are presented in the dossier. All results met the comparability 
acceptance criteria’s demonstrating comparability between batches of 250 mg FP and 350 mg FP. As the 
major equipment, formulation, and materials of construction remain the same, no comparability studies 
were  performed  between  the  5.5  ml  fill  volume  (250  mg  FP)  late-stage  clinical  and  commercial 
manufacturing processes. Of note, only the 350 mg FP presentation has been applied for. 
A  compatibility  study  with  the  infusion  system  demonstrated  that  the  FP  diluted  into  0.9%  Sodium 
Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose injection were compatible with the infusion system and the diluents. 
Compatibility has been adequately described. 
In conclusion the pharmaceutical development of cemiplimab FP is described in sufficient detail. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacture 
The  sites  involved  in  manufacturing,  in-process  testing,  testing,  labelling  and  packaging,  final  batch 
release and importation are listed in the dossier. 
A batch size range, expressed as the amount of cemiplimab FAS used to manufacture a batch of 50 mg/ml 
cemiplimab finished product vials, is indicated. The applicant initially applied for 2 strengths, however on 
the basis of the approval of the 350 mg strength and as agreed with EMA, the 250 mg strength is no 
longer pursued. There is only one FP form applied for: 350 mg vial of cemiplimab FP.  
The Libtayo manufacturing process consists of the following steps: thawing of cemiplimab FAS, pooling 
and mixing of cemiplimab FAS, filtration, aseptic filling of vials, stoppering, capping, and tray loading of 
filled  vials  and  100%  inspection  of  cemiplimab  FP.  The  manufacturing  process  is  well  described  and 
considered acceptable. Flow charts of the manufacturing process steps, including identification of critical 
process parameters critical in-process parameters have been provided and a narrative description of each 
step, including labelling and packaging, has been included. 
Cemiplimab  can  be  stored  at  2  –  8  °C  for  limited  times  at  specific  stages  during  the  manufacturing 
process. The validated hold times are set at the shortest of the hold times achieved for the three PPQ lots.

Time out of refrigeration (TOR) was recorded any time the cemiplimab FAS temperature was maintained 
above 5 ± 3 °C during PPQ. The shortest of the hold times achieved for the three PPQ lots is considered 
the validated hold time for each step. The maximum TOR from end of thaw until the end of 100% visual 
inspection is defined as the shortest TOR achieved during PPQ. 
The holding times are adequately described and validated. No reprocessing steps have been described. 
Cemiplimab solution may contain trace amounts of translucent to white particles in a single-use vial. The 
identity of the particles was confirmed mainly as cemiplimab protein. The applicant has committed to 
further demonstrate during post-authorisation that particles can be correctly identified (during release 
testing) in relation to their source.  
The cemiplimab FP is presented in single-use vials without preservative. The measurements to control 
microbiological quality and sterility of the FP are considered acceptable. The container-closure system 
and  the  assessment  of  the  suitability  of  the  components  are  described.  Results  of  extractable  and 
leachable studies revealed no unexpected components.  
The excipients in the cemiplimab FP formulation comply with compendial monographs. No excipients of 
human or animal origin are used and no novel excipients are used in the FP formulation.  
Process controls 
The controls and parameters evaluated were derived from development data, process risk assessments, 
parameters  selected  for  monitoring  during  PPQ,  historical  process  performance  data  (process 
experience),  and  laboratory  scale  process  characterisation  data.  The  IPCs  and  process  parameters 
associated with each manufacturing process step were determined and in-process controls and process 
parameters were classified as critical, key, or non-key. Action limits, acceptance criteria, and ranges were 
established with consideration of historical manufacturing experience, process capability (non-statistical) 
as determined during manufacture of late-stage clinical material, validation experience and risk. 
Based on the provided in-process testing and release testing product quality data it is demonstrated that 
the manufacturing process for Libtayo FP is capable of consistent and homogenous performance.  
Process- and product-related impurities have been adequately discussed. Other than  visible particles, 
there are no FP-related impurities apart from those described for AS and FAS.  The FP manufacturing 
process is designed to limit the exposure to factors that can cause particle formation. The level of visible 
particulates is controlled by 100% visual inspection. In conclusion, the measures taken by the applicant 
to control visible particles in the FP are considered acceptable. 
Process validation  
The manufacturing process was validated using PPQ batches of the 250 mg vial presentation and the 350 
mg vial presentation. Of note only the 350 mg vial presentation has been applied for. The batch size range 
corresponds  to  the  commercial  scale.  On  the  basis  of  the  data  submitted  it  is  considered  that  the 
manufacturing process for the 350 mg vial presentations is considered validated.   
Aseptic process validation has been performed by microbial challenge tests. Shipping validation has been 
performed. 
Based on the provided validation data on in-process and release testing it has been demonstrated that the 
manufacturing  process  for  Libtayo  finished  product  is  capable  of  consistent  and  homogenous 
performance.

The release and end-of-shelf-life specifications of the finished product have been provided. 
The cemiplimab FP release and shelf-life specifications are considered adequate to ensure the quality of 
Libtayo FP.  
An elemental impurities risk assessment has been performed according to ICH Q3D to evaluate 
cemiplimab FP for the presence of elemental impurities. It concluded that the risk for the presence of 
elemental impurities in cemiplimab FP at levels which exceeded 30% of the permitted daily exposure 
(PDE) was low, and no additional controls were required. 
Analytical methods 
Specification tests were selected based on ICH Q6B. The methods have been described and validation 
studies performed. The validation studies and transfer qualification information presented are considered 
acceptable.  
Suitability  tests  have  been  provided  for  the  following  tests:  Endotoxin  (LAL),  sterility  and  container 
closure integrity. 
Reference standard 
The reference standard is the same as for AS and FAS.  
Batch analysis 
Batch  information  is  provided  in  the  dossier,  including  the  status,  manufacturing  date,  batch  size, 
reference standard used for release testing, AS manufacturing process, description, manufacturing site, 
disposition in clinic, PPQ, and stability studies. Batch analysis results of  batches of 50 mg/ml cemiplimab 
FP are presented in the dossier. Batch analysis data of  historical cemiplimab FP batches have also been 
provided. The batch data presented complies with the FP specification and demonstrates manufacturing 
consistency.  
Container closure 
The primary packaging for Libtayo FP is a 10 ml clear Type 1 glass vial, with a grey chlorobutyl stopper 
with  FluroTec  coating  and  seal  cap  with  a  flip-off  button.  All  packaging  materials  in  contact  with  the 
finished product comply with relevant pharmacopeial requirements. 
The  container-closure  system  used  for  cemiplimab  FP  is  adequately  described.  Compatibility  of  the 
container-closure system with cemiplimab FP has been demonstrated and stability information included. 
The sterilization of the primary packaging has been sufficiently addressed. 
Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf life for Libtayo is 18 months at 5 ±3˚C. The product should not be frozen and it should 
be stored in the original carton to protect it from light.  
Stability test results presented meet the set acceptance criteria at the long-term storage condition for all 
primary and supporting stability lots. The results obtained from these studies support the relevance of the 
selected stability indicating parameters. Over all the data obtained to date indicate that Libtayo FP is 
stable when stored at the proposed long-term storage temperatures. 
The  primary  and  supportive  stability  studies  have  been  performed  according  to  ICH  Q5C.  The  data 
presented for the 250 mg FP is considered sufficient to support the proposed shelf-life for the FP according 
to ICH Q5C. Of note, only the 350 mg presentation has been applied for.

The SmPC indicates in section 6.3 that the diluted solution, after opening and preparation of the infusion, 
should be administered immediately. If the diluted solution is not administered immediately, it may be 
stored temporarily either at room temperature of up to 25°C for no more than 8 hours from the time of 
preparation or under refrigeration at 2°C to 8°C for no more than 24 hours from the time of infusion 
preparation. Stability data to demonstrate the diluted product can be stored temporarily, at 25°C for not 
more than 8 hours and under refrigeration at 2 -8°C for not more than 24 hours has been provided in the 
dossier.  
The  stability  studies  of  the  primary  and  supporting  cemiplimab  FP  batches  at  the  long-term  storage 
condition of 5 ± 3°C, will be completed according to the stability protocol. As per GMP requirements the 
applicant will place a minimum of one batch of cemiplimab FP on long-term stability at the recommended 
storage condition every year of manufacturing.  The batches will be tested according to the analysis plan 
and the results must meet the end-of-shelf-life specifications. 
Adventitious agents 
Complementary approaches have been implemented in order to control potential adventitious agents (i.e. 
bacteria, fungi, virus, TSE/BSE agents) in cemiplimab AS and FAS: controlled sourcing and safety of the 
raw materials used during cell line development and in the manufacturing process, testing of cell banks 
and testing at appropriate stages of the production process and evaluation of the effectiveness and 
robustness of the viral inactivation and removal during the product purification process. 
Safety of raw materials 
The direct use of animal derived raw materials was confined to early stages of cell line development. An 
in-house virological and TSE safety assessment has been performed on raw materials of direct or indirect 
animal origin, used throughout cell line development, establishment of cell banks and the current 
cemiplimab manufacturing process. The safety assessments performed demonstrate a minimal risk for 
transmission of TSE, as well as potential viral contamination.  
Testing of host cell line, cell banks, and EPCs 
The MCB, WCBs, and EPCs have been extensively tested according to ICH Q5A. The in vitro assay for 
adventitious viruses (IVA) was designed according to current guidelines. The MCB and WCB were tested 
for viruses. No non-viral contaminants were detected in any of the tests performed at any cell level. The 
MCB and EPCs were (slightly) positive for reverse transcriptase (RT) activity. However, no identifiable 
virus-like particles other than budding A- and C-type retrovirus-like particles (RVLP), which are generally 
known to be present in CHO cells. The MCB and EPC were negative for retroviruses in the additional 
retrovirus specific tests performed. Apart from the observed RVLPs, no other virus was detected in cells 
at any level. Thus, the overall test results demonstrate that the cell banks used for the manufacture of 
cemiplimab are virologically safe. 
Unprocessed bulk (UPB) in-process testing 
Each batch of UPB is tested using a number of different assays in accordance with current guidelines. 
Results from PPQ lots are provided. No detection of adventitious agents was reported except in the 
bioburden test of the AS lot, where 1 CFU/ml was observed. An investigation performed concluded that 
the bioburden recovery was likely to have been introduced during testing.  
Virus clearance evaluation 
The manufacturing process, which includes several purification steps, has been adequately demonstrated 
to be capable of viral clearance using model viruses representing different physicochemical 
characteristics.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The applicant has submitted a dossier of acceptable quality and follows the CTD format. The cemiplimab 
AS manufacturing process has been sufficiently described and documented. It has been demonstrated by 
appropriate validation that the manufacturing process produces an AS of consistent quality. Appropriate 
controls are in place for the release of cemiplimab AS. FP manufacture, control and release have been well 
documented  and  are  considered  to  be  acceptable.  Minor  issues  have  been  identified  during  the 
assessment  of  the  dossier  and  these  were  resolved  in  a  satisfactory  manner  by  the  applicant.  One 
recommendation related to an identification method for particles was agreed. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of Libtayo active substance and finished product is considered to be acceptable when used in 
accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to 
the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory 
way. Data have been presented to give reassurance on viral and TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
• 
to further demonstrate that (during routine release testing) particles can be correctly identified in 
relation to their source.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Cemiplimab is a fully human IgG4 isotype monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds specifically to human 
and cynomolgus monkey programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptors. Cemiplimab was evaluated in 
nonclinical studies to determine its ability to block PD-L1-induced inhibitory signalling. Since cemiplimab 
does not bind to mouse or rat PD-1, its ability to induce anti-tumour immunity was evaluated in 
PD-1hum/hum genetically humanized mice expressing the human PD-1 extracellular domain, fused with the 
transmembrane and intracellular portions of mouse PD-1 instead of the equivalent mouse gene products.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro 
Binding Affinity (REGN2810-MX-14078) 
SPR-Biacore technology was used to determine the kinetic binding parameters for the interaction of 
cemiplimab with recombinant PD-1 proteins from multiple species at 25°C and pH 7.4.

Ability of cemiplimab to antagonize PD-L1 mediated PD-1 signaling (REGN2810-MX-14079) 
Cemiplimab and both comparator PD-1 antibodies (REGN1672 and REGN2626) were evaluated for their 
ability to increase T cell activation by blocking PD-1/PD-L1-mediated T cell inhibitory signaling (Figure 3). 
Jurkat/PD-1-CD 300a/AP-1-Luc cells and Raji/PD-L1 cells were activated with the T cell activating 
bispecific (CD3xCD20) antibody. Cemiplimab restored T cell activation to approximately 75% of the 
maximum value, with a corresponding EC50 value of 1.37 nM.

Using hPBMC as effector cells, cemiplimab did not induce ADCC in Jurkat, CD3/CD28 stimulated Jurkat, 
HEK293/PD-1 or HEK293 target cells. 
In Vitro Functional Assays-CDC 
Cemiplimab did not mediate CDC in Jurkat, CD3/CD28 stimulated Jurkat, HEK293/PD-1 or HEK293 cells. 
In Vitro Functional Assay-CIC C1q 
C1q binding was not observed with either cemiplimab and PD-1.mmH or the hIgG4P isotype control 
antibody and PD-1.mmH solutions, whereas the heat-aggregated human gamma globulin controls fell 
within the range of expected values.

striped bars) or hIgG4P isotype REGN1945 alone (negative control, green bars). Beads were washed with PBS and 
then incubated together with CD4+ primary T cells from 2 different healthy donors. Beads and T cells were mixed 
together at 1:1 ratio in the presence of increasing concentration of soluble anti-CD28 mAb (BD clone 28.2) in media, 
as indicated on the graph. Proliferation was measured at 37°C by tritiated thymidine incorporation during the last 6-12 
hours of a 72 hour incubation. Soluble anti-CD28 antibody increased T cell activation in a dose dependent manner. 
In vivo 
Anti-tumor Activity of cemiplimab in PD-1 Humanized Mice at Doses of 5 mg/kg and 10 
mg/kg 
The effect of cemiplimab on the growth of syngeneic colorectal carcinoma tumours (MC38.Ova) was 
examined in PD-1 humanized mice genetically engineered to express a human/mouse PD-1 chimeric 
receptor from the mouse Pd1 locus. This human/mouse PD-1 chimeric receptor consists of the human 
PD-1 extracellular domain fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of mouse PD-1. Using 
huPD-1 mice, cemiplimab and the comparator anti-PD-1 antibodies, REGN1672 and REGN2626, were 
tested for their effect on MC38.Ova tumour allograft growth and mouse survival in two independent 
experiments at 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg (Cemiplimab and REGN1672) and at 2.5 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg  
(Cemiplimab , REGN1672, and REGN2626). 
The two in vivo pharmacology models both showed significant reductions in tumour volumes at all doses 
tested for cemiplimab, REGN1672 and REGN2626. At 10 mg/kg of cemiplimab and REGN1672 complete 
tumour regression was seen in all animals at day 21. At both 5 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg for cemiplimab, 
REGN1672 and REGN2626 complete regression of the tumour was seen in all animals except one animal 
in each group at day 21. All animals that did not show complete regression at day 21 actually showed 
tumour growth over the time course of the study.

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamics studies have been conducted with cemiplimab (see non-clinical 
discussion). 
Safety pharmacology programme 
No dedicated safety pharmacology studies have been conducted with cemiplimab. The safety 
pharmacology endpoints were integrated into the repeat dose toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys 
for cemiplimab administered at IV doses of 2, 10, or 50 mg/kg/week for 5- or 26-weeks with an 8-week 
or 12-week recovery phase, respectively. These included an evaluation of cardiac conduction (ECG’s) by 
Jacketed External Telemetry (JET) as well as hemodynamics (heart rate and blood pressure), respiratory 
rates (breaths/minute), and CNS evaluation by neurological exams. During the toxicology studies, there 
were no drug-related effects observed in food consumption, body weights, CNS, body temperature 
effects, heart rate, blood pressure, ECG parameters or respiratory effects. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been conducted (see non-clinical discussion).

Bioavailability was estimated together with data from a pharmacokinetic and a toxicology study following IV dosing of cemiplimab in 
the monkey (REGN2810-PK-14065 and REGN2810-TX-14059) by a population PK approach (REGN2810-PK-14152).  
NA = Not applicable  
Following a single SC dose of 1 to 15 mg/kg cemiplimab to monkeys, Cmax increased dose-proportionally. 
In the repeat-dose toxicity studies, toxicokinetics were determined to be linear for doses ≤ 10 
mg/kg/week during the dosing phase. Accumulation of cemiplimab was determined after weekly IV 
infusion of cemiplimab and stabilised at approximately 3 after 8 doses at the time steady state is reached.  
In monkeys, a single IV or SC dose of cemiplimab triggered a prominent antidrug –antibody response; 
ADAs were detected in all treated animals and in all dose levels (1, 5 and 15 mg/kg) at day 28 and day 56 
post dose (after SC; ADAs were determined only at day 56 post dose). Measured ADA values (counts) 
correlated  with  lower  cemiplimab  serum  concentration  levels.  Throughout  the  PK  and  TK  studies,  the 
concentrations  of  ‘outliers  or  likely  impacted  by  ADA’  were  excluded  from  PK  and  TK  analysis.  ADA 
response was graded as ‘weak’ (i.e. mean peak counts that were ~3 fold greater than pre-dose), ‘strong’ 
(i.e., mean peak counts 200-500 fold greater than pre-dose) or ‘very strong’ (i.e. 1000-fold the pre-dose 
values). Only 2 out of 15 monkeys were graded as ‘weak’ in ADA response scale, and 4/15 strong and 
9/15 very strong in ADA response scale.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicity testing program of cemiplimab consisted of: 
•  Study REGN2810-TX-14059: 4-week IV toxicology study in monkey. 
•  Study REGN2810-TX-14153: 26-week IV toxicity and TK study with a 12-week recovery 
period. 
•  Study REGN2810-TX-15151: 13-week IV fertility assessment and TK study with a 12-week 
recovery period.

There were no unscheduled deaths during the study and no test article-related clinical signs evident. 
There were no test article-related effects on body weights, food consumption, ophthalmic or 
cardiovascular endpoints, blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, respiration rate and pulse 
oximetry, neurological examination parameters, clinical pathology parameters (hematology, coagulation 
parameters, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis) and PBMC stimulation analysis. There were no test 
article-related macroscopic findings.  
It has been evaluated the cemiplimab-related effects on the counts of proliferating T-lymphocytes, a 
pharmacologically relevant measure for prediction of effect in humans. The effects were limited to 
dose-independent increases in the frequency and absolute counts of proliferating T-lymphocytes, 
T-helper lymphocytes, and T-cytotoxic lymphocytes (as determined by Ki67 labeling) that were present 
at Day 9 and to a lesser extent on Day 23, and generally returned to predose levels by Day 50.  
Cemiplimab was highly immunogenic in monkeys illustrated by the widespread immune complex 
depositions in connection to adverse vascular findings in adrenal gland, spleen, liver and lymph nodes in 
animals. Immune complex depositions were confirmed by positive staining for C3, IgG and IgM providing 
a plausible explanation for the vascular dilation, local hemorrhage, arterial hypertrophy/hyperplasia and 
vascular necrosis in several organs. In the recovery animals the immune complex related findings were 
decreased in incidence and severity, suggesting only a trend towards reversibility. It should be noted 
here, that cemiplimab exposure was still evident at end of recovery for doses 10 and 50 mg/kg/week at 
15-23% of exposure at end of treatment. NOAEL can be set to the highest dose 50 mg/kg/week.

populations observed in the control and dosed animals did not demonstrate a dose-dependent pattern 
and were sporadic; therefore, these changes were attributed to normal variability in these populations. 
Continuous exposure to cemiplimab was maintained throughout the 26-week treatment period in 3 of 12 
(25%), 7 of 12 (58%), and 8 of 12 (67%) animals in the 2, 10, and 50 mg/kg/week groups, respectively. 
Throughout the 12-week recovery period, concentrations of cemiplimab were detected in 2 of 3 (67%) 
animals in the 10 mg/kg/week group and all animals in the 50 mg/kg/week groups and were not detected 
in any animals in the 2 mg/kg/week dose group due to ADA impact.  
The adverse vascular findings so prominent in the 4-week study were not found in this study, except in 
one animal in dose group 10 mg/kg. Instead severe clinical signs of hyperactivity against cemiplimab was 
observed in several animals.  
The NOAEL was considered to be 50 mg/kg/week in all repeat-dose toxicity studies in monkeys, the 
highest dose administered. However, while setting this dose as the NOAEL any adverse reactions as a 
consequence of high immunogenicity was excluded. Given that in 26-week toxicity study in monkeys two 
animals died (one in 10 and 50 mg/kg dose groups in each) due to immune complex deposition and 
associated tissue damage. 
Cemiplimab was strongly immunogenic in monkeys. Immunogenicity was moderate to high across all 
studies, with the incidence of anti-cemiplimab antibodies (anti-drug antibodies, ADA) and the intensity of 
the response being inversely correlated with the cemiplimab dose level. A positive ADA response almost 
always correlated with lower serum cemiplimab concentrations, compared to ADA-negative animals in the 
same dose group. A positive ADA response almost always correlated with lower serum cemiplimab 
concentrations, compared to ADA-negative animals in the same dose group.

Reproduction Toxicity 
The applicant provided a summary of literature studies showing that blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 axis induce 
increased risk for abortion and premature delivery in mice. Fertility were evaluated in a 13-week toxicity 
study. 
13-Week Intravenous Toxicology Fertility Assessment Study in Sexually Mature Cynomolgus 
Monkeys With a 12-Week Recovery Period (REGN2810-TX-15151) 
The primary objective of this study was to look into potential effects of cemiplimab on fertility by 
evaluating a range of parameters prerequisites of adequate fertility. After the dosing phase of 13 weeks, 
very few findings were evident from histopathological evaluation. In males minimal infiltration of 
mononuclear cells in epididymis was found in 1/4 animals in the low dose group and in 2/4 animals in the 
high dose group with none in the control group. After the recovery phase, the incidence was 1 out of 2 in 
all three groups. In the recovery group, tubular hypoplasia was found in testis in 1 out of 2 animals in the 
low dose group (marked) and in both animals in the high dose group (minimal). Thymus, spleen, liver, 
adrenal etc. was also undergoing histopathological evaluation, but no findings were observed.  
No cemiplimab-related microscopic findings were observed in male or female reproductive tissues. NOAEL 
for fertility is considered to be 50 mg/kg/week in both males and females, the highest dosage 
administered.  
No studies were submitted to study cemiplimab effects on prenatal and postnatal development or 
maternal function (see non-clinical discussion).  
No studies in juvenile animals were submitted (see non-clinical discussion).

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant did not submit an ERA but submitted a justification for an exclusion from preparation of 
environmental risk assessment studies according to Section 2 of the 2006 CHMP Guideline on the 
Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use Guideline because cemiplimab is a 
monoclonal antibody consisting of linked naturally occurring amino acids. Per the ERA Guideline, proteins 
are exempted because they are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
The  non-clinical  pharmacology  of  cemiplimab  was  well  characterised  in  vitro  and  the  effects  were 
considered to be pharmacologically relevant.  
Cemiplimab was tested in vitro for cytokine release activity, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and 
complement-dependent cytotoxicity. The results showed binding of cemiplimab to PD-1 and activation of 
target T cells compared to isotype control. Cemiplimab was also evaluated in two in vivo pharmacology 
models in PD-1 humanized mice. In these models cemiplimab showed significant reductions in tumour 
volumes at all doses tested for cemiplimab. At 10 mg/kg of cemiplimab complete tumour regression was 
seen in all animals at day 21. At both 5 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg for cemiplimab complete regression of the 
tumour was seen in all animals except one animal in each group at day 21. All animals that did not show 
complete regression at day 21 actually showed initial reduced tumour growth and then progressed over 
the time course of the study. At the highest concentration, all animals showed tumour regression. The 
Assessment report

reason is unknown and could be the result from differences of physiological, metabolic or immunological 
origin between individual animals.  
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics of cemiplimab was as expected for an antibody in monkeys with indications of target 
mediated clearance at lower doses and plasma concentrations. Several monkeys showed precipitation 
like increase in clearance just after 14 days treatment probably due to antidrug antibodies. This finding is 
not considered to have a significant impact on the overall conclusion on the TK and PK samples selection.  
The immunogenicity findings in monkey studies are generally not predictive for human antigenicity and 
therefore are not considered of clinical relevance. 
Toxicology 
The toxicity of cemiplimab was evaluated in the repeat dose toxicity studies of 4, 13 and 26-weeks 
duration in monkeys. The 13-week study was dedicated to evaluation of fertility endpoints. The 4-weeks 
study included endpoints to evaluate cemiplimab impact on immune cells. Cemiplimab induced only a 
transient increase in T cell proliferation. No single dose toxicity study was performed, which is acceptable 
considering the clinical schedule of administration. 
In the 4-week study, vascular findings of depositions of immune complexes were associated with antidrug 
antibodies. In the 26-weeks study findings of immune complexes were low or absent, however, incidents 
of clinical signs similar to hypersensitivity reactions occurred, which led to early euthanasia of 1 animal on 
day 36 and death of one animal on day 94. In the 13-week study, no such concerns were identified. The 
differences in immunogenicity observed between the individual studies are most probably due to the 
differences in study design and/or the age and source of the animals used in the studies. The lower 
incidence of antigenicity in the 13-week study could be due to the use of older animals, source of animals, 
time point for examination for ADAs, or other differences in study design. 
It is agreed that the immune complex response is considered to be of no translational significance to 
humans and NOAEL can be set to the highest dose 50 mg/kg/week. 
No studies have been performed for secondary pharmacodynamics drug interactions and secondary PD 
studies which is acceptable as no PD effects other than those already described are expected for this class 
of agents. Since other checkpoint inhibitors have shown to induce abortion and premature delivery in 
monkeys, the risk is already identified,hence it is acceptable that no studies have been performed to test 
the potential of cemiplimab for carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, pre and postnatal development and juvenile 
studies. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with cemiplimab (see SmPC section 4.6). 
As reported in the literature, PD-1 / PD-L1 signalling pathway plays a role in sustaining pregnancy by 
maintaining immunological tolerance and studies have shown that PD-1 receptor blockade results in early 
termination of pregnancy. The increase of spontaneous abortion and/or resorption in animals with 
restricted PD-L1 expression (knock-out or anti-PD1 / PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies) has been shown in 
both mice and monkeys. These animal species have similar maternal-foetal interface to that in humans. 
No clinical data are available on the possible effects of cemiplimab on fertility. No effects on fertility 
assessment parameters or in the male and female reproductive organs were observed in a 3-month 
repeat dose fertility assessment study with sexually mature cynomolgus monkeys. 
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with cemiplimab. There are no available data on the 
use of cemiplimab in pregnant women. Animal studies have demonstrated that inhibition of the PD 
1/PD-L1 pathway can lead to increased risk of immune-mediated rejection of the developing foetus 
resulting in foetal death (see SmPC section 5.3). Women of childbearing potential should use effective 
contraception during treatment with cemiplimab and for at least 4 months after the last dose of 
cemiplimab. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/368468/2019  
Page 36/163 
 
 
 
No concerns regarding local tolerance of cemiplimab arose during or after the repeat-dose toxicity 
studies. 
Cemiplimab is a protein composed of natural amino acids. Proteins are biodegradable in the environment 
and thus do not pose any environmental risk. Therefore, according to the “Guideline on the environmental 
risk assessment of medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2), it is acceptable 
that no ERA studies were submitted for cemiplimab. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In conclusion, the non-clinical studies (pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology), submitted for 
the marketing authorisation application for cemiplimab, were considered adequate and acceptable for the 
assessment of non-clinical aspects. As also discussed during scientific advice, the lack of carcinogenicity, 
genotoxicity, fertility and pre/post-natal and juvenile development were agreed and are considered 
acceptable and well justified. Based on cynomolgus monkey studies, there is a potential risk for foetal loss 
in humans. This risk is adequately addressed in the SmPC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
All studies presented have been performed in adult patients with various types of advanced solid tumors; 
there are no studies in healthy subjects. 
PK characteristics of cemiplimab are based on data from Study 1423 and Study 1540, the clinical studies 
supporting the marketing application in patients with CSCC. Primarily, the 3 mg/kg Q2W dosing regimen 
and the proposed monotherapy dose regimen of 350 mg Q3W were evaluated. At the time of filing the 
MAA submission, study 1540 was ongoing for group 2 and 3 (350 mg Q3W) where the applicant 
subsequently provided additional data from remaining patients with CSCC in both Studies 1423 and 1540. 
These data include 53 patients in Study 1540 who received cemiplimab 350 mg Q3W (from Group 3), of 
which 31 patients had reached 80% of steady state at cycle 2 day 1. 
In study 1423 cemiplimab PK was characterized in a Phase 1, repeated-dose, study as mono-therapy and 
combination therapy. Dense sampling was applied after the first dose followed by sparse sampling at 
pre-infusion (Ctrough) and end-of-infusion (Ceoi) throughout the 48-week administration period, ie, up 
to 6 treatment cycles of 56-days (8 weeks).   
In study 1540, Cemiplimab PK was characterized in a Phase 2 study as monotherapy. Sparse sampling 
was performed. 
Analytical methods 
Cemiplimab in human serum was measured using an ELISA method, and the anti-drug-antibodies in 
patient sera were detected using a three-tiered strategy with screening, confirmatory and titer assays 
based on an electrochemiluminescent bridging immunoassay, and the neutralizing antibodies were 
detected by an electrochemiluminescence-based CLB method.  The bioanalytical assay for measurement 
of cemiplimab levels fulfilled the predefined acceptance criteria, with an ULOQ in undiluted human serum, 
which is 20x fold lower than the Cmax concentrations at end of infusion. 
Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
PK parameters after the first dose of cemiplimab were determined by use of conventional 
non-compartmental analysis. 
The pharmacokinetics of cemiplimab were also assessed in an integrated analysis with population PK 
methods. The PK characteristics of cemiplimab in patients with solid tumors were first analysed as a 
function of the dose in the dose escalation cohorts (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg Q2W), for 
monotherapy and for combination therapy (Study 1423). The concentrations of cemiplimab were then 
further investigated in the expansion cohorts in the broader population of patients with different solid 
tumor types receiving monotherapy or combination therapy.  
Evaluation and Qualification of Models 
Patients included in the pop PK model are presented in Figure 7.

Figure 6:  
Population pharmacokinetic model: Summary of patients included in the model 
by study and dose group 
In response to the question regarding limited data on the fixed dose 350 mg Q3W, the parameters of the 
PopPK model were re-estimated based on a dataset that was updated to include 43 patients with CSCC 
who received 350 mg Q3W (from Group 3 of Study 1540), of which 23 patients had reached 80% of 
steady state exposure following administration of 350 mg Q3W.  
A two-compartment model with parallel linear and nonlinear (Michaelis-Menten) elimination was selected 
as a starting model structure. Figure 8 provides a schematic for the initial two-compartment structural PK 
model with parallel linear and nonlinear (Michaelis-Menten) elimination.

The inclusion of a time-varying change on clearance (models LN011 to LN014) significantly improved the 
model fit and resulted in a reduction of the minimum objective function value (MOFV) greater than 300 
points, as shown in Table 12. 
Table 10:  
Comparison of model parameter estimate between the linear elimination base 
models and the corresponding time dependent clearance models, relative to the 
primary base model (LN001) 
As such, the POP PK analysis suggested a 2-compartment model with zero-order IV infusion and 
first-order elimination (LN014). A time-varying CL with sigmoid-Emax functional form was implemented in 
the model.  
The final model was fitted to 1,000 bootstrap replicate datasets to evaluate its stability and performance. 
Nonparametric bootstrap was performed and resulted in 95% CIs for population PK parameter estimates, 
which are presented in Table 13.  
The covariate effects are presented in a forest plot, in Figure 9.

Bioavailability 
Cemiplimab was administered IV as a 30-minute infusion and hence bioavailability is complete. Peak 
concentrations are typically reached at the end-of-infusion, ie, at 0.5 hours. Based on population PK 
analysis, the mean Cmax after the first dose was 69.5 mg/L for 3 mg/kg Q2W regimen Table 14.

Bioequivalence  
The cemiplimab IV formulation used in the clinical trials (1423 and 1540) providing the PK/PD data 
evaluated are in concordance with the intended-to-be-marketed formulation, which mean that there is no 
need for bioequivalence studies.  
Dose rationale for 350 mg Q3W 
The proposed recommended dose is 350 mg Q3W administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 
minutes until the observation of symptomatic disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  
The fixed 350 mg Q3W dose was selected to achieve similar exposure compared to the 3 mg/kg Q2W 
dose. The population PK model was used to compare cemiplimab exposure at 350 mg Q3W and 3 mg/kg 
Q2W in a simulated patient population with a body-weight range similar to that observed in population PK 
dataset. In addition, the simulated concentration time profiles for 350 mg Q3W were compared to the 
available observed cemiplimab concentration data from 350 mg Q3W. Cemiplimab exposure metrics at 
steady state (Ctrough,ss, Cmax,ss and AUC6wk,ss), shown as median with 95% CI and as mean (CV%), were 
compared for the 2 dosing regimens Table 15.

Distribution 
Cemiplimab is primarily distributed in the vascular system. Based on population PK analysis, the total 
volume of distribution at steady-state is 5.20 L (Table 19).

Metabolism 
No clinical studies have been performed to characterise cemiplimab excretion (see pharmacology 
discussion). 
Elimination 
The primary elimination pathways of cemiplimab are protein catabolism via RES or target-mediated 
disposition. Following a single dose, the clearance of cemiplimab was observed to be independent of dose 
for the regimens studied (1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg Q2W), but the population PK analysis did identify a 
time-dependent component to the clearance of cemiplimab on multiple dosing. The mean cemiplimab T1/2 
after the first dose was 12.5 days (based on NCA) and mean T1/2 at steady state was 19.2 days (POP PK 
estimate). In the overall patient population, the total clearance of cemiplimab appeared to decrease over 
time by about 34.6% over the first 2 months of treatment, ie. from a baseline value of 0.325 L/day down 
to 0.211 L/day (Table 19, above ). The change in clearance was larger in patients with CSCC who were 
considered responders to cemiplimab; the mean was 39.5% in those patients considered responders vs. 
33.5% in “all others”.

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Generally, the PK of cemiplimab are linear and dose-proportional over the 1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg Q2W dose 
range.  
Figure 16: 
Observed concentrations (Mean[SE]) of cemiplimab after the first dose in 
patients with solid tumours, including CSCC - Linear and LoG Scale - Study 1423 
and Study 1540 
For the overall patient population, observed Ctrough at the 1 mg/kg dose level (after the first dose) shows 
a trend towards nonlinearity, especially when compared to observed Ctrough at 10 mg/kg.  
In Study 1540, concentrations of cemiplimab observed in patients with CSCC after the end of the infusion 
of the first dose and Ctrough on day 14 before the second dose of a 3 mg/kg Q2W dosing regimen were 
consistent with concentration-time profiles at 3 mg/kg Q2W  observed in patients with CSCC in Study 
1423.  
Time dependency 
As determined by the population PK, patients achieve >90% of steady-state after 16 weeks dosing for the 
3 mg/kg dose Q2W regimen (observed and simulated) and for the 350 mg Q3W regimen (simulated). The 
simulated mean accumulation index in AUC6wk,ss was 1.96 for the 3 mg/kg Q2W - and 1.84 for the 350 mg 
Q3 dosing regimen.

On average clearance decreases by more than 30% over time compared to the baseline clearance, i.e. 
from ~0.30 L/day to ~0.20 L/day within 16 weeks of treatment. The half-life (T50) of time-varying 
clearance was estimated to be ~30 days in a typical patient.

mL/min; n=4) renal impairment (Table 10, below). Cemiplimab AUC did not appear to be affected by mild 
to moderate impaired renal function. In patients with severe renal impairment, AUC was reduced by 30 
%. However, only 4 patients with severe renal impairment were included in the analysis.

The covariate analysis showed that baseline albumin had a significant effect on CL with a magnitude of the 
effect size of 1, indicating a linear relationship. Cemiplimab exposures (steady-state AUC6wk) in patients 
with lower than normal albumin were lower than in patients with normal albumin levels.

Based on the POP PK analysis, gender does not appear to have an impact on the steady state PK of 
cemiplimab. 
Race 
Maximum reduction in time-dependents Cl was achieved more slowly in black vs. white patients (75 vs. 
30 days). Based on the POP PK analysis, race was not found to have an impact on the steady state PK 
(Ctrough,ss and AUCss) of cemiplimab. 
Weight 
When cemiplimab is administered with body weight-based doses (eg, 3 mg/kg Q2W) patients with higher 
body weight shows a trend of higher exposure, while for the 350 mg Q3W the trend is reversed. The Ctrough 
for patients with BMI > 39.4 kg/m2 were not much lower compared to patients with BMI < 18 kg/m2. In 
addition, no major differences in AUC at steady state is predicted.

weight groups. It is noted that Ctrough for patients with BMI > 39.4 kg/m2 not are much lower compared to 
patients with BMI < 18 kg/m2. No major differences in AUC at steady state is predicted. The applicant 
states that the variability observed is not relevant to safety or efficacy with either the BW-adjusted or the 
flat dose and this is agreed.

No dedicated studies of cemiplimab have been conducted in pediatric patients. PK data was only collected 
from adults. 
Other covariates 
The population PK covariate analysis showed that baseline IgG is a statistically significant covariate on CL 
with a magnitude of the effect size of 0.18. Cemiplimab exposure was slightly lower in patients with higher 
IgG levels. 
The population PK covariate analysis showed a small effect for baseline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) on 
cemiplimab CL, whereas tumour type did not have significant impact on the PK of cemiplimab. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No formal pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies have been conducted with cemiplimab. Since 
cemiplimab is a human monoclonal antibody and hence cleared from the circulation through catabolism, 
and not subject to protein transportes, no metabolic drug-drug interactions are expected. It is therefore 
endorsed that interactions studies have not been provided. However, other forms of interaction need to 
be discussed. The effect of systemic immunosuppression through use of corticosteroids and other 
immunosuppressants concomitantly with cemiplimab have been addressed in the SmPC section 4.5

was similarly low (1.17% [4/341]). Only 1 patient who received cemiplimab 3 mg/kg Q2W in combination 
therapy had a persistent ADA response. No patients were positive for NAbs.

As of the cutoff date of 30 Jun 2018, of a total of 135 patients with CSCC in Study 1540, none showed 
positive ADA-response (41 patients in group 1 and 59 patients in group 2 treated at 3 mg/kg every 2 
weeks [Q2W]; 35 patients in group 3 treated at 350 mg every 3 weeks [Q3W]). 
Exposure response relationship - Efficacy 
Exposure-response analyses were conducted to evaluate the relationship between cemiplimab exposure 
metrics (Ctrough1, Cmax1 and AUC1) and efficacy endpoints (BOR, ORR, and DOR) in patients with CSCC. The 
vast majority of patients included in the analysis received cemiplimab (monotherapy) at 3 mg/kg Q2W. 
Steady-state exposure was not used in the exposure-response analysis of efficacy as a large portion of 
patients in the efficacy population did not receive a dose 2 weeks before the 6-months efficacy endpoint 
assessment due to drop-out or other reasons. Patients dropped-out early from the study when not 
responding to cemiplimab resulted in 47% and 43% of the patients with CSCC remaining in the efficacy 
data set on week 8 and week 16, respectively, and in 85% and 57% of the patients remaining in the 
safety data set on week 8 and week 16, respectively. E-R relationships for efficacy and safety were mainly 
impacted by the number of drop-outs. Therefore, interpretation of these E-R relationships is hampered by 
the limited number of patients in the analysis and the narrow exposure range considered.

µg/ml after 3 mg/kg Q2W and 350 mg Q3W, respectively. 
Cmax,ss appears to be higher for the fixed dosing regimen as compared to the weight based dosing regimen

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the analytical methods used were acceptable. The bioanalytical method for quantitative 
determination of cemiplimab appears to be adequately validated and suitable for its purpose.  Assay 
performance, in terms of inter-assay precision and inter-assay relative error was considered acceptable.

The PK characteristics of cemiplimab in patients with solid tumours were first analysed as a function of the 
dose in the dose escalation cohorts (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg Q2W), for monotherapy and for 
combination therapy (Study 1423). The concentrations of cemiplimab were then further investigated in 
the expansion cohorts in the broader population of patients with different solid tumour types receiving 
monotherapy or combination therapy. The design of the two clinical studies providing PK data are overall 
adequate. Concentration data were collected in 548 patients with various solid tumours, including 178 
patients with CSCC, who received cemiplimab. At dosing regimens of 1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks 
and 350 mg every 3 weeks, kinetics of cemiplimab were observed to be linear and dose proportional, 
suggesting saturation of the target-mediated pathway over the dosing interval. Similar exposures to 
cemiplimab are achieved with the doses of 350 mg every 3 weeks and 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks. With 
350 mg every 3 weeks, the mean steady-state concentration of cemiplimab ranged between Cmax of 
168 mg/l and a Ctrough of 61 mg/l. Steady-state exposure is achieved after approximately 4 months of 
treatment. A Linear elimination model was best to describe the PK of cemiplimab, although a parallel 
elimination comprising both a linear and a non-linear elimination pathway was expected for cemiplimab in 
line with other monoclonal antibodies and cemiplimab non-human data. In case cemiplimab was cleared 
primarily by target mediated drug disposition, dose

compared to the corresponding linear models. This may be due to lack of sufficient data or due to limited 
availability of the target receptors resulting in limited or no relevant contributions of target mediated drug 
disposition. The applicant should provide further information about the non-linear phase of cemiplimab 
disposition in the further analysis of studies 1423 and 1540. 
Cemiplimab is administered via the intravenous route and hence is completely bioavailable. Cemiplimab 
is primarily distributed in the vascular system. The POP PK model based mean clearance and volume of 
distribution in steady state were 0.211 L/day and 5.2 L, respectively, which is in line with the expected 
principal  PK  parameters  for  a  monoclonal  antibody  administered  IV.  This  corresponds  to  a  half-life  of 
approximately  19.2  (POP  PK  estimated  value).  Inter-individual  variability  (%  CV)  for  CL  (40  %)  and 
Volume  of  Distribution  at  SS  (24.3%)  was  moderate.  While  the  available  single  dose  cemiplimab 
concentration data was best described by a 2-compartment linear model, the population PK analysis did 
identify a time-dependent component to the clearance of cemiplimab on multiple dosing.  
Clearance  of  cemiplimab  is  linear  at  doses  of  1 mg/kg  to  10 mg/kg  every  two  weeks.  Cemiplimab 
clearance after the first dose is approximately 0.33 L/day. The total clearance appears to decrease by 
approximately 35% over time, resulting in a steady state clearance (CLss) of 0.21 L/day; the decrease in 
CL is not considered clinically relevant. The within dosing interval half-life at steady state is 19.4 days. In 
the overall patient population after repeated dosing, the total clearance of cemiplimab decreased over 
time by about 34.6% over the first 2 months of treatment, ie, from a baseline value of 0.325 L/day down 
to 0.211 L/day. It is hypothesized that the change in antibody clearance may serve as an early marker for 
drug efficacy. Based on the data provided, it is acceptable that dose adjustment is not necessary in that 
the cemiplimab exposure is not expected to affect efficacy or safety. 
The  POP  PK  analysis  comprised  predominantly  data  from  the  dosing  regimen  3  mg/kg  Q2W  (totally 
n=440).  53  patients  from  Group  3  (350  mg  Q3W)  were  included  in  the  updated  PK  analysis  set. 
Comparison of the observed data and the updated model predictions indicates that the performance of 
the PopPK model was consistent with the original analysis. A population PK analysis suggests that the 
following factors have no clinically significant effect on the exposure of cemiplimab: age, gender, body 
weight, race, cancer type, albumin level, mild hepatic impairment and renal impairment. 
The applicant has not conducted a QT study. Considering that no clinically relevant effect on cardiac 
repolarization was noted for any of the checkpoint inhibitors, the lack of QT study is acceptable.

No pharmacokinetic interactions through metabolic enzymes or transporters are expected for an IgG 
antibody. Specific metabolism studies were not conducted because cemiplimab is a protein. Cemiplimab 
is expected to degrade to small peptides and individual amino acids. No pharmacokinetic drug-drug 
interaction studies have been conducted with cemiplimab. The use of systemic corticosteroids or 
immunosuppressants before starting cemiplimab, except for physiological doses of systemic 
corticosteroid (≤10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent), should be avoided because of their potential 
interference with the pharmacodynamic activity and efficacy of cemiplimab. However, systemic 
corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants can be used after starting cemiplimab to treat 
immune-related adverse reactions (see SmPC section 4.2). 
The 350 mg Q3W group was comparable to the population predicted exposure based on a dataset that 
was updated to include 43 patients with CSCC who received 350 mg Q3W (from Group 3 of Study 1540), 
of which 23 patients had reached 80% of steady state exposure following administration of 350 mg Q3W. 
Therefore, it can be agreed that the observed exposure for the 350 mg Q3W dosing regimen appear to be 
comparable to that observed for the 3 mg/kg Q2W dosing regimen. The PopPK modelling with PK data 
from the 350 mg Q3W dose has confirmed comparable exposure parameters between the two dosing 
regimens. The applicant has also presented additional clinical efficacy and safety data for patients treated 
with the fixed 350 mg Q3W dose, and the conclusion following assessment of these data is that the 350 
mg Q3W dose is overall as efficacious and safe as the 3 mg/kg Q2W dose (see clinical efficacy section). 
Based on the cemiplimab exposure data at steady state, the preliminary antitumor activity observed at 3 
mg/kg Q2W dose in Study 1423 and the similar exposures achieved with the doses of 350 mg every 3 
weeks and 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks, the fixed 350 mg Q3W dose is acceptable. 
Cemiplimab showed a low immunogenicity potential (1.26%) in all patients receiving cemiplimab 3 mg/kg 
Q2W (n=398). The validation range for the functional cemiplimab bioanalytical assay is in undiluted 
human serum. The ADA screening assay sensitivity was determined to be 15 ng/mL in presence of 150 
µg/mL cemiplimab. The performance of the ADA assay should be more stringently controlled. The 
presently set acceptance criteria do not set the analyses to any certain level, but rather allow drifting of 
the measured values without any limits. Although the outcome of an analysis of a sample is either ADA 
positive or ADA negative, the technical read-out obtained from the analysis is numerical and the results 
obtained from the control samples must level from one analysis to another. This is a prerequisite for 
controlling the consistency and reliability of the assay at levels close to the assay cut point. Therefore, it 
is recommended that the applicant should develop such assay acceptance criteria that anchor the level of 
the assay to a certain read-out range for further use. No dose adjustment is recommended for elderly 
patients. Cemiplimab exposure is similar across all age groups (see SmPC sections 5.1 and 5.2). 
The effect of renal impairment on the exposure of cemiplimab was evaluated by a population PK analysis 
in patients with mild (CLcr 60 to <89 ml/min; n= 197), moderate (CLcr 30 to <60 ml/min; n= 90), or 
severe (CLcr <30 ml/min; n= 4) renal impairment. No clinically important differences in the exposure of 
cemiplimab were found between patients with renal impairment and patients with normal renal function. 
Cemiplimab has not been studied in patients with CLcr <25 ml/min.  
No dose adjustment of LIBTAYO is recommended for patients with renal impairment. There are limited 
data for LIBTAYO in patients with severe renal impairment CLcr <30ml/min (see sections 4.2 and 5.2 of 
the SmPC). 
The effect of hepatic impairment on the exposure of cemiplimab was evaluated by population PK analysis. 
In patients with mild hepatic impairment (n= 5) (total bilirubin [TB] greater than 1.0 to 1.5 times the 
upper limit of normal [ULN] and any aspartate aminotransferase [AST]); no clinically important 
differences in the exposure of cemiplimab were found compared to patients with normal hepatic function. 
Cemiplimab has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. There are 
insufficient data in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment for dosing recommendations.

No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment. LIBTAYO has not been 
studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. There are insufficient data in patients 
with moderate or severe hepatic impairment for dosing recommendations (see sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the 
SmPC 4.2). 
The applicant originally applied for two strengths of 250 mg and 350 mg of cemiplimab. During the 
assessment, the applicant withdrew the 250 mg strength due to the anticipated approval of the 350mg 
Q3W dosing regimen. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In conclusion, pharmacokinetics of cemiplimab has been mainly characterized by PK results from studies 
1423 and 1540 as well as a PopPK model which is considered acceptable. The 350 mg Q3W dose is 
considered comparable between the two dosing regimens and has been appropriately investigated. The 
CHMP is of the opinion that the performance of ADA assay should be more stringently controlled.   
The CHMP recommends the following measures to address the issues related to pharmacology: 
• 
The performance of the ADA assay should be more stringently controlled. The presently set 
acceptance criteria do not set the analyses to any certain level, but rather allow drifting of the 
measured values without any limits. Although the outcome of an analysis of a sample is either 
ADA positive or ADA negative, the technical read-out obtained from the analysis is numerical and 
the results obtained from the control samples must level from one analysis to another. This is a 
prerequisite for controlling the consistency and reliability of the assay at levels close to the assay 
cut point. Therefore, it is recommended that the applicant should develop such assay acceptance 
criteria that anchor the level of the assay to a certain read-out range for further use. 
• 
To provide more information about the non-linear phase of cemiplimab disposition in the further 
analysis of Studies 1423 and 1540 currently planned. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
In the Dose Escalation (DE) phase of Study 1423, 3 dose levels of cemiplimab were administered (1, 3, or 
10 mg/kg) intravenously (IV) every 2 weeks (Q2W). A 3 + 3 model was used and the safety of cemiplimab 
was evaluated as monotherapy and in combination with potentially immune-enhancing treatments 
(cyclophosphamide [CTX], hypofractionated radiotherapy [hfRT], and the combination of combined hfRT 
plus CTX) in DE: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/368468/2019  
Page 64/163 
 
 
 
 
After recommended dose of cemiplimab, alone and in combination with hfRT and/or CTX, was established 
in the DE portion of the study, multiple Expansion Cohorts were opened: 
The Expansion Cohorts involved cemiplimab as monotherapy and as combination therapy in various 
combinations with chemotherapy or radiotherapy (RT) in selected indications. In both DE and Expansion 
Cohort portions of the study, the initial planned treatment with cemiplimab was Q2W for up to 48 weeks, 
with approximately 24 weeks of follow-up observation. Patients who had disease progression during the 
follow-up period had the option to resume treatment with cemiplimab if eligibility criteria were still met. 
The rationale for the use of 3 mg/kg cemiplimab IV Q2W dose in Group 1 (mCSCC) and Group 2 (laCSCC) 
from Study 1540 was based on data from the ongoing Study 1423. The rationale for the use of cemiplimab 
350 mg IV Q3W dose in Group 3 (mCSCC) from Study 1540 and for all subsequent studies was based on 
population PK modelling (see clinical pharmacology section).

Treatments 
Patients with CSCC received either: 
•  3 mg/kg cemiplimab intravenous (IV) every 2 weeks (Q2W) in Group 1 (mCSCC) and group 2 
(laCSCC) 
•  350 mg cemiplimab IV every 3 weeks (Q3W) in Group 3 (mCSCC) 
Duration of treatment: Group 3 (mCSCC) patients received 350 mg cemiplimab IV Q3W for up to 54 
weeks (whereas patients in Group 1 [mCSCC] and Group 2 [laCSCC] received 3 mg/kg cemiplimab IV 
Q2W for up to 96 weeks). 
Dose modification or interruption: Toxicity management guidelines in the protocol indicated scenarios in 
which interruption or discontinuation of study treatment was required. Dose reduction of cemiplimab was 
allowed only in uncommon situations and only after discussion and agreement between the investigator 
and sponsor.

Exploratory Objectives (Group 2 [laCSCC] only) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/368468/2019  
Page 69/163 
 
 
 
The exploratory objectives include evaluation of the pharmacodynamics of cemiplimab in tumor biopsies 
obtained at baseline, during treatment, and at progression in CSCC patients treated with cemiplimab and 
assessed predictive potential and correlation to clinical response for biomarkers of interest including but 
not limited to the following: 
• 
Tumour RNA expression 
•  Number and distribution of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (cluster of differentiation [CD]8+ T 
cells, CD4+ T cells, T regulatory cells, and tissue permitting, other subtypes such as B cells, 
myeloid-derived cells, natural killer cells, etc.) 
• 
Expression levels (messenger RNA and/or protein) of PD-L1, glucocorticoid-induced tumor 
necrosis factor receptor family related gene, lymphocyte activation gene-3, and possibly other 
checkpoint modulators 
•  Mutations in known oncogenes and potential tumour neoantigens 
• 
Tumour mutation burden 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy variable for this study was ORR according to independent central review. The 
following independent central review committees determined ORR separately for Group 1 (mCSCC) and 
Group 2 (laCSCC): 
• 
For Group 1 and Group 3 (mCSCC), Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 
version 1.1 was used to determine ORR. For patients in whom all response assessments were 
performed on radiologic scans according to RECIST 1.1, the determination of the Independent 
Radiologic Review Committee (IRRC) served as the central response assessment. Clinical or 
composite response criteria was used for patients with externally visible target lesions, if all 
metastatic lesions were not measureable by RECIST (such as may occur in patients with 
bone-only metastases). 
• 
For Group 2 (laCSCC), composite response criteria were used for the centrally reviewed ORR. 
Composite response was based on photographic assessment of externally visible lesions 
according to modified WHO-criteria by the Independent Photographic Review Committee (IPRC) 
AND assessment of radiologic data according to RECIST 1.1 by the IRRC. The central response 
assessments for Group 2 (laCSCC) patients were determined by the ICRC, which integrated all of 
the information provided by the IPRC and the IRRC for each patient. 
Primary Efficacy Variable: Objective response rate (ORR) 
Objective response rate was based on a centrally reviewed evaluation at each time point at which a 
response assessment occurred using RECIST 1.1 or the composite response criteria. 
Best overall response (BOR) was determined once all the data for the patient were known. The BOR was 
the best response recorded during the study as of the data cutoff date. A BOR of CR or partial response 
(PR) must have been confirmed by evaluations of overall response of CR or PR at time points at least 4 
weeks apart. A BOR of stable disease (SD) must have met the response SD criteria at least once ≥ 39 
days (6 weeks*7 days/week-3 days) after start of study drug. Best overall response of (early) progressive 
disease (PD) did not require confirmation using the RECIST 1.1 or the composite response criteria. For 
patients who did not have any post-baseline tumor assessment, BOR was not evaluable (NE). Patients 
with BOR of NE were considered as not reaching an objective response of CR or PR. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/368468/2019  
Page 70/163 
 
 
 
 
Objective response rate was determined by the proportion of patients with BORs of CR or PR in the full 
analysis set (FAS) by group. Patients with BOR of NE were considered as not reaching an objective 
response of CR or PR. 
Key secondary endpoint: Duration of response by central-reviewed evaluation (DOR) 
It is determined for patients with best overall response of CR or PR. DOR is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are first met for CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date of recurrent 
or progressive disease (radiographic), or death due to any cause. Patients who never progress while being 
followed will be censored at the last valid tumour measurement.  
Other Secondary Efficacy Variables 
•  ORR based on investigator-assessed evaluation using the RECIST version 1.1 or the composite 
response 
• 
Progression-free survival (PFS) is measured from the start of treatment until the first date of 
recurrent or progressive disease (radiographic), or death due to any cause. Patients who never 
progress while being followed will be censored at the last valid tumour measurement. If a patient 
has no post-baseline evaluation, the patient will be censored at first treatment date. 
•  Overall survival (OS) is measured from the start of treatment until death due to any cause. 
Patients who do not have a survival event will be censored at the last date that patient is 
documented to be alive. As many patients may receive subsequent therapy after disease 
progression, a variant of OS will also be defined as censoring patients who do not have a survival 
event at the first date of a subsequent therapy is taken. 
•  CR rate is determined by the proportion of patients with best overall response of CR after tumour 
biopsy confirmation. Patients with best overall response of NE will be considered as not reaching 
an objective response of CR. 
• 
• 
Time to response (TTR) was determined by independent central review and by investigator 
assessment. 
Patient-reported quality of life is measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30: The global health status/QoL, 
five functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional and social), and three symptom scales 
(fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting) and a number of single items assessing additional symptom 
commonly reported by cancer patients (dyspnoea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation and 
diarrhoea) and perceived financial impact of the disease will be computed using the QLQ-C30 
scoring procedures. Change scores are defined as change of summary score of EORTC QLQ-C30 
from day 1 of first treatment cycle. 
For all of the above time-to-event variables, the time-to-event (day) was the date of event/censor minus 
the date of first study drug + 1. 
Sample size 
Based on previous studies, a clinically meaningful ORR for an investigational agent was expected to be 
>15% for patients with metastatic disease or >25% for patients with laCSCC. 
For Group 1 (mCSCC), 50 patients were required to provide at least 85% power to reject a null hypothesis 
of an ORR of 15% at a 2-sided significance level of no more than 5% if the true ORR was 34%. For Group 
2 (laCSCC), 72 patients were required to provide at least 90% power to reject a null hypothesis of an ORR 
of 25% at a 2-sided significance level of no more than 5% if the true ORR was 44%.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/368468/2019  
Page 71/163 
 
 
 
The sample sizes for each group were selected such that the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% confidence 
interval (CI) of the estimated ORR would be clinically meaningful. The non-clinically meaningful ORR of 
15% for Group 1 (mCSCC) was excluded using the lower limit of 95% CI if the observed ORR was around 
28.0% or more (i.e., the ORR for Group 1 [mCSCC] was significantly different from 15%). The 
non-clinically meaningful ORR of 25% for Group 2 (laCSCC) was excluded using the lower limit of 95% CI 
if the observed ORR was around 36.1% or more; i.e., the ORR for Group 2 (laCSCC) was significantly 
different from 25%. 
At later stage during the conduction of the study (Amendment 3), a third cohort including 53 additional 
patients with metastatic CSCC was enrolled in a new group, Group 3. The same assumptions for the 
sample size made for Group 1 were used for Group 3. 
An exact binomial test was applied for the calculations. 
Randomisation 
Study 1540 was a single arm study, therefore randomization was not applicable. 
Blinding (masking) 
Study 1540 was a single arm study, therefore blinding was not applicable. 
Statistical methods 
Interim Analysis for Study 1540 
At the time of the planned primary efficacy analysis for Group 1 (mCSCC) (6 months after last patient, 
first dose), an interim analysis of efficacy for patients in Group 2 (laCSCC) was performed. These changes 
were introduced at a late stage in the protocol as Amendment 5 (22 Sept 2017).  
The efficacy analysis for patients in Group 2 (laCSCC) was restricted to those with potential for “adequate” 
follow-up, defined as patients who had the opportunity to receive approximately 9 months of study drug 
at the time of the interim analysis.  
For the primary variable of ORR, the following null and alternative hypotheses were tested for 
Group 1 (mCSCC) and Group 2 (laCSCC), respectively: 
•  Group 1 (mCSCC): H0: ORR = 15% vs. H1: ORR ≠ 15% 
•  Group 2 (laCSCC): H0: ORR = 25% vs. H1: ORR ≠ 25% 
•  Group 3 (mCSCC): H0: ORR = 15% vs. H1: ORR ≠ 15% 
Different approaches were taken regarding the alpha level: 
•  No correction to the alpha level for the interim analysis: the overall response rate and associated 
95% confidence interval were applied. As the primary objective of the interim analysis is point 
estimation on ORR and characterizing the precision of point estimation, there is no hypothesis 
testing associated with this interim analysis. Also, no decisions will be made regarding study 
conduct associated with the interim analysis. Therefore, Type I error adjustment is not applicable 
for this planned interim analysis. 
• 
The alpha level was corrected for the interim analysis: for Group 2 a two sided alpha of 0.0001 
was allocated for interim analysis and two-sided alpha of 0.0499 will be preserved for the final 
analysis. Correspondingly, for the interim analysis of primary endpoint of ORR in group 2 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/368468/2019  
Page 72/163 
 
 
 
patients, the precision of ORR will be estimated by adjusted and two-sided 99.99% exact 
confidence interval. The un-adjusted and two-sided 95% exact confidence interval will also be 
reported at the time of interim analysis. At the time of the final analysis for group 2 patients, both 
adjusted 95.01% and un-adjusted 95% exact confidence interval will be reported. 
The data cut-off for the planned primary analysis of metastatic CSCC Group 1 in pivotal Study 1540 was 
6 months after enrolment of the last patient into Group 1, at a time when the locally advanced CSCC 
Group 2 was still enrolling.  The data cut-off for the interim analysis of the local advanced CSCC Group 2 
in pivotal study was decided to be the same time as the cut-off for Group 1.   
The data for the interim analysis of Group 2 was limited to patients with at least 9 months of follow-up.   
Study populations 
• 
Full Analysis Set (FAS): all patients who has passed screening and are eligible for the study. This 
is population used for the efficacy variables. 
•  Safety Analysis Set (SAF): all enrolled patients who have received at least one dose of 
cemiplimab. Treatment compliance/administration and all clinical safety variables will be 
analysed or summarised using the SAF. 
• 
PK Analysis Set (PKA): all patients who have received any cemiplimab and who have at least one 
non-missing drug concentration after the first dose of study drug. 
•  Anti-drug Antibody Set (ADA): all patients who have received cemiplimab and who have at least 
one post-dose ADA result. 
•  Biomarker Analysis Set (BAS): all patients who have received cemiplimab and who have at least 
one sample assayed (only relevant for Study 1540). 
Analysis variables 
For continuous variables, descriptive statistics include the following: the number of patients reflected in 
the calculation (n), mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum. In addition, 25th 
percentile and 75th percentile was provided.  
For categorical or ordinal data, frequencies and percentages was displayed for each category. 
For time-to-event variables, median time-to-event (and the survival rate at a fixed time point) and its 
95% confidence intervals was summarised by the Kaplan-Meier method. The confidence interval for the 
proportion of patients with BORs of CR or PR was calculated using the Clopper-Person method. 
Statistical analysis for efficacy was conducted independently for each group. 
Results 
Participant flow 
As of the data cutoff of the interim analysis, a total of 194 patients had been screened, and a total of 137 
patients had been enrolled and treated (59 patients in Group 1 [mCSCC], 55 patients in Group 2 
[laCSCC], and 23 patients in Group 3 [mCSCC]) at 31 sites in 3 countries. 
The reasons for the 57 screen failures are detailed as follows:

Recruitment 
According to sample size calculations, up to 182 adult patients (53 patients in Group 1 [mCSCC], 76 
patients in Group 2 [laCSCC], and 53 patients in Group 3 [mCSCC]) were expected to be enrolled. 
However, 193 patients were finally enrolled.

§ Data cutoff is 20 Sep 2018 for Groups 1 and 3, and 10 Oct 2018 for G2. 
*Fully enrolled 
The updated centrally reviewed efficacy results for Groups 1, 2 and 3 have been provided by the 
applicant. Data cutoff is 20 September 2018 for Groups 1 and 3, and 10 October 2018 for Group 2. 
Primary analysis was finally possible for the entire population of the study since all 193 patients (in the 3 
groups) have had the opportunity for at least 3 response assessments. 
Median follow-up times in Groups 1, 2, and 3 were 16.5, 9.3, and 8.1 months, respectively. For the entire 
study population (N=193 patients), median follow-up time is 9.4 months. 
At the time of the primary analysis for Group 1 (27 Oct 2017), enrollment was still ongoing for Group 2 
(locally advanced CSCC [laCSCC], 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks [Q2W) and Group 3 (mCSCC, 350 mg Q3W). 
Group 2 completed enrollment on 25 Apr 2018 and Group 3 completed enrollment on 15 Mar 2018. In the 
SAF, 41 (29.9%) patients had discontinued study drug prematurely. The most common primary reason 
for premature treatment discontinuation was disease progression (15.3% [21/137]). 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments: There were several minor changes performed to the SAP. The change in the SAP 
that may affect the presented results is related to the time-point for the interim analysis of Group 2. 
Amendment 5 of the protocol was finalised in 22 Sept 2017 and the data cut-off date was 27th Oct 2017.  
In protocol amendment 3, Group 3 (mCSCC) was added: 
Group 3 (mCSCC) – Patients with mCSCC: This group opened after the completion of enrollment to Group 
1 (mCSCC) and included patients with mCSCC. As with Group 1 (mCSCC) patients, Group 3 (mCSCC) 
patients were required to have metastatic disease. As in Group 1 (mCSCC), Group 3 (mCSCC) included 
patients with both nodal metastatic and distant metastatic disease. 
Patients with mCSCC receive either 3 mg/kg cemiplimab intravenous (IV) every 2 weeks (Q2W) in Group 
1 (mCSCC) or cemiplimab 350 mg IV every 3 weeks (Q3W) in Group 3 (mCSCC). Patients with laCSCC 
receive 3 mg/kg cemiplimab IV Q2W in Group 2.  
The updated centrally reviewed efficacy results for Groups 1, 2 and 3 have been provided by the 
applicant. Data cutoff is 20 Sep 2018 for Groups 1 and 3, and 10 Oct 2018 for Group 2. Primary analysis 
Assessment report

was finally possible for the entire population of the study since all 193 patients (in the 3 groups) have had 
the opportunity for at least 3 response assessments. 
Median follow-up times in Groups 1, 2, and 3 are now 16.5, 9.3, and 8.1 months, respectively. For the 
entire study population (N=193 patients), median follow-up time is 9.4 months. 
At the time of the primary analysis for Group 1 (27 Oct 2017), enrollment was still ongoing for Group 2 
(locally advanced CSCC [laCSCC], 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks [Q2W) and Group 3 (mCSCC, 350 mg Q3W). 
Group 2 completed enrollment on 25 Apr 2018 and Group 3 completed enrollment on 15 Mar 2018.  
The PK/ADA data cutoff date (Groups 1 and 2) was 06 Oct 2017. The last PK collection date for Group 3 
was 21 Dec 2017. 
Major protocol deviations: Seventeen major protocol deviations were reported in 12 patients in the SAF. 
Major protocol deviations by individual patient in the SAF are described in Table 29. A total of 12 subjects 
(8.8%) were reported with 1 or more major protocol deviations.  The applicant implemented 100% source 
data verification.

Numbers analysed 
In accordance with ICH E9 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials (1998), the following analysis 
populations were used for the statistical analysis as specified: 
Full Analysis Set:  The FAS included all enrolled patients in Group 1 (mCSCC) and patients enrolled on or 
before 27 Jan 2017 in Group 2 (laCSCC). The FAS by group was the primary analysis population for the 
efficacy variables. 
Safety Analysis Set: The safety analysis set (SAF) included all enrolled patients who received at least 1 
dose of cemiplimab. Treatment compliance/administration and all clinical safety variables was analyzed 
or summarized using the SAF. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/368468/2019  
Page 80/163 
 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set: The PK analysis set included all treated patients who received any amount 
of study drug and had at least 1 non-missing functional cemiplimab measurement following the first dose 
of study drug. The PK/ADA cutoff date for Groups 1 and 2 is 06 Oct 2017, and the last PK collection for 
Group 3 is 21 Dec 2017. 
Anti-Drug Antibody Analysis Set: The ADA analysis set included all treated patients who received any 
amount of study drug at the PK/ADA cutoff date of 06 Oct 2017 and had at least 1 non-missing 
anti-cemiplimab antibody result following the first dose of study drug. 
Biomarker Analysis Set: The biomarker analysis set included all patients who received any dose of 
cemiplimab and who had at least 1 sample assayed. 
Table 33:

Original MAA submission and updated datasets 
Following the SAP, primary analysis was finally possible for the entire population of the study since all 193 
patients (in the 3 groups) have had the opportunity for at least 3 response assessments, acknowledging 
that median follow-up time for the ITT population is still limited (9.4 months since start of treatment). 
Data cutoff is 20 September 2018 for Groups 1 and 3, and 10 October 2018 for Group 2. As from the last 
data cutoff (30 June 2018), current IRC-assessed ORR results are consistent for each group: 49.2% in 
Group 1, 43.6% in Group 2 and 39.3% in Group 3. Of note, the lower bound of the 95% CI is beyond the 
range of clinically insignificant effect (≤15% ORR in Group 1 and Group 3, ≤25% in Group 2) in all 3 
groups.

submission and updated datasets 
Figure 23: 
Kaplan-Meier curve of duration of response by independent central review (full 
analysis set - patients with confirmed CR or PR) - All CSCC patients by group 
The efficacy data showed that although most of the responders in Group 1 (22 out of 29) achieved PR or 
CR at the first assessment (week 8), 4 patients achieved it at the second assessment (week 16), 2 at the 
third (week 24) and there was also one very late responder at the fifth assessment (week 40). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/368468/2019

Considering the longer follow-up for Group 1, 27 out of 29 patients (93%) had a response that has lasted 
for 6 months or longer.  
DoR is ≥6 months for 68% of patients from G2 (23 out 34) and 64% of patients from G3 (14 out of 22). 
Immaturity of the current DoR data is reflected in the degree of censoring (9 events in 85 responders: 
89.4% of censoring), which in turn hinders interpretation of the K-M graph for DoR (median DoR not 
reached in any of the groups).

In relationship to the previous 30-June-2018 data cutoff, updated IRC-PFS results are nearly identical for 
Group 1 (28 events in 59 patients, mPFS 18.4 months, 6-month-PFS 66.0%) and minimally improved for 
Group 3 (26 events in 56 patients, mPFS 10.4 months, 6-month-PFS 59.3%).

Quality of life was assessed using European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of 
Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30). Changes in mean EORTC QLQ-C30 scores generally did not 
indicate consistent changes in quality of life with the exception of the pain symptom subscale.

Ancillary analyses 
Sensitivity analyses 
Two sensitivity analyses that assign either an OS or PFS event to patients who had ended the study due 
to other reasons and were not undergoing active follow-up have been provided by the applicant.  
In the overall survival (OS) analysis presented in the original MAA (27 Oct 2017), 13 patients died and 69 
were censored. Among these 69 patients, 51 patients were still ongoing in the study and 18 patients had 
end of study (EOS). Per protocol, study patients who had EOS due to reasons other than death have 
quarterly survival follow-up (ie, a phone call) after EOS. To provide an analysis for this question regarding 
OS, the algorithm for patients who were censored for OS and had EOS is presented below: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/368468/2019  
Page 86/163 
 
 
 
  
 
• 
If a patient is still in active survival follow-up (ie, last survival follow-up was within 4 months 
before the data cutoff), the patient is censored at last known alive date (N=10). 
•  For other patients, the imputed death date will be = last known alive date+1 (N=8). 
Table 42: 
Summary of Overall Survival - Sensitivity analysis (FAS)

In this worst-case scenario, the established OS and PFS outcome of patients with advanced CSCC treated 
with cemiplimab is maintained. 
Subgroup analyses 
PD-L1 status 
In Study 1540, tumour biopsies during the screening period were required for laCSCC patients (Group 2), 
but not for mCSCC patients (Groups 1 and 3). Among 78 patients in Group 2, 48 had samples that were 
appropriate for PD-L1 IHC testing. For 30 patients, there was no sample available for PD-L1 IHC testing, 
either because the sample was not obtained or because slides were expired (>6 months since slide cut 
date) or because of an insufficient number of cells (<100 viable tumour cells) on the slide. For Groups 1 
and 3 patients (mCSCC patients) in Study 1540, archived tumour samples for PD-L1 testing were 
available for 13 patients (5 patients in Group 1, 8 patients in Group 3). For all other patients in Groups 1 
and 3, PD-L1 testing was not possible because tumour material was depleted by H&E staining for clinical 
pathology review, or slides were expired (>6 months since slide cut date), or there was insufficient 
number of cells (<100 viable cells) on the slide. For Group 2 patients who had the opportunity for 3 
response assessments, the tables below provide ORR, PFS, and OS stratified by PD-L1 positivity at 
different cutoffs (eg, <1%, ≥1% to <5%, ≥5% to <50%, and ≥50%). This was not a planned subgroup 
analysis.

Prior cancer-related radiotherapy 
In the interim clinical study report (CSR) for Study 1540 in the original MAA, cemiplimab demonstrated 
efficacy both in patients who had received any prior radiation therapy (RT; objective response rate [ORR] 
43.8% [28/64]) per independent central review) as well as in those who had not received any prior RT 
(ORR 55.6% [10/18] per independent central review). 
In the updated submission, the applicant has evaluated whether prior RT could have provided added 
benefit to cemiplimab therapy for advanced CSCC.

dose of prior radiotherapy (≥150 Gy) - Study 1540 (FAS) 
There is a tendency for response that is observed in patients that have had high cumulative dose of prior 
radiotherapy, with 4 PRs and 2 SDs in the 6 patients who had received a high dose of radiotherapy. 
Prior systemic chemotherapy 
Table 52 summarizes prior anti-cancer systemic therapy for all patients (total) included in this analysis, 
and for patients in Groups 1, 2, and 3 individually. In the total efficacy population (right column), 63.5% 
(106/167) of patients had not received any prior anti-cancer systemic therapy. There were 36.5% 
(61/167) of patients who received any prior systemic therapy and 11.4% 19/167) of patients who had 
received more than 1 prior regimen. 
Table 53 and Table 54 present ORR data for the entire efficacy population, subgrouped according to 
previously treated and previously untreated patients. ORR was 41.0% (95% CI: 28.6, 54.3) in previously 
treated patients and 47.2% (95% CI: 37.4, 57.1) in previously untreated patients.

Relationship between ADA development and efficacy 
In the Interim CSR for pivotal Study1540, all 41 patients with mCSCC (Group 1) and all 30 patients with 
laCSCC (Group 2) were negative in the anti-drug antibody (ADA) assay. As such, subgroup analysis was 
not performed. 
Updated data on ADA based on data locks of 20 Sep 2018 for Groups 1 and Group 3 and 10 Oct 2018 for 
Group 2 were reviewed. 140 patients were included in the ADA population from Study 1540 including 41 
patients from Group 1 (3mg/kg cemiplimab in metastatic CSCC), 60 patients from Group 2 (3mg/kg 
cemiplimab in locally advanced CSCC) and 39 patients from Group 3 (350 mg cemiplimab in metastatic 
CSCC patients). None of these patients (0%) experienced ADA or neutralizing antibodies to cemiplimab.

Fully Human Antibody to Programmed Death – 1 (PD-1), as Single Therapy and in 
Combination with Other Anti-Cancer Therapies, in Patients with Advanced Malignancies 
Study 1423 is a phase 1, first-in-human, open-label, repeat dose study with cemiplimab as monotherapy 
and combination therapy. 397 adult patients (≥18 years old, males/females) with advanced solid 
malignancies in multiple cohorts have been enrolled, among them 26 with CSCC: Expansion Cohort 7 
evaluated cemiplimab 3 mg/kg Q2W monotherapy in 16 CSCC patients with distant metastatic disease 
(M1), and Expansion Cohort 8 evaluated cemiplimab 3 mg/kg Q2W monotherapy in 10 patients with 
locally and/or regionally advanced CSCC.

The last patient enrolled in Expansion Cohort 7 received the first treatment with cemiplimab on 25 Oct 
2016, and the last patient enrolled in Expansion Cohort 8 received the first treatment with cemiplimab on 
24 Jan 2017. The data cutoff date for this efficacy analysis is 02 Oct 2017. 
The report submitted by the applicant presents the results of an unplanned interim analysis, specifically 
performed to support the marketing applications of cemiplimab for the treatment of mCSCC and laCSCC. 
Patient disposition: Among 26 CSCC patients, 11 (42.3%) patients completed the planned 48-week 
treatment regimen. The most common reason for treatment discontinuation was progression of disease 
(26.9% [7/26] of patients). Death was the primary reason for discontinuation of 2 patients and AEs in 2 
additional patients.  
Numbers analysed: All 26 CSCC patients who were in the FAS were also included in the SAF and in the 
PKAS. 
Baseline data: The CSCC population consisted predominantly of older white males. Median age was 72.5 
years, 80.8% of patients were male, and 92.3% of patients were white. Notably, the median age of the 
CSCC patient population (72.5 years) was greater than that of the overall study population (62.0 years). 
No patients with ECOG PS 2 were allowed to participate, 16 patients had ECOG PS 1 and the other 10 had 
ECOG PS 0. Approximately 58% of CSCC patients had been treated with a cancer-related systemic 
therapy at baseline. The most common agents were monoclonal antibodies (7 out of 26 patients, 27%) 
and platinum compounds (7 out of 26 patients, 27%). Taxanes had been received by 3 patients. Most 
patients had had prior cancer-related surgery (median 3.0 procedures [range 1 to 17]). Most mCSCC 
patients (68.8% [11/16]) and all laCSCC patients (100% [10/10]) had received prior cancer-related RT. 
Efficacy: Updated efficacy results for the CSCC patients using the 30 Jun 2018 data cutoff date are 
presented.

The Dermatologic Cooperative Oncology Group (DeCOG) analysis of CSCC patients 
A larger “real world” experience regarding advanced CSCC patients in the European Union (EU) was 
reported recently (Hillen, 2018). The Dermatologic Cooperative Oncology Group (DeCOG) retrospectively 
analysed 190 patients with advanced CSCC (114 metastatic, 76 locally advanced) from 20 German and 
Austrian clinical sites between 2010 to 2011. Advanced CSCC comprised laCSCC or mCSCC. Locally 
advanced CSCC was defined as a tumour that could not be cured or was unlikely to be curable by either 
surgery, radiotherapy, or both (based on decision by an interdisciplinary tumour board). Metastatic CSCC 
included patients with local nodal metastases, distant metastases, or both local nodal and distant 
metastases. Table 67 summarizes the baseline characteristics in the DeCOG study population (N =190 
patients) and baseline characteristics from fully enrolled Groups 1, 2, and 3 in Study 1540 (N=193 
patients).

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The efficacy and safety of cemiplimab in patients with metastatic (nodal or distant) CSCC (mCSCC) or 
locally advanced CSCC (laCSCC) who were not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation were 
studied in clinical trial R2810-ONC-1540 (Study 1540). Study 1540 was a phase 2, open-label, 
multi-centre study that had enrolled 193 patients with mCSCC or laCSCC with a combined median 
follow-up time of 9.4 months. Median follow-up was 16.5 months for the mCSCC 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks 
group (Group 2), 9.3 months for the laCSCC 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks group (group 1) and 8.1 months for 
the mCSCC 350 mg every 3 weeks group (group 3).  
Patients with any of the following were excluded: autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy 
with immunosuppressant agents within 5 years; history of solid organ transplant; history of pneumonitis 
within the last 5 years; prior treatment with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 or other immune checkpoint inhibitor 
therapy; active infection requiring therapy, including known infection with human immunodeficiency 
virus, or active infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus;  chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL); brain 
metastases or Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score ≥ 2. Regarding

recruitment, 4 out of 193 patients had not been confirmed by independent central pathology review to 
have the diagnosis of invasive CSCC, which could have affected the results. However, several sensitivity 
analyses for efficacy endpoints provide reassurance for the primary efficacy analysis. Previous treatment 
with BRAF-inhibitors was an exclusion criterion because BRAF-induced CSCCs are biologically and 
clinically different from UV-induced CSCCs. However, no patients were excluded from participation in the 
trial due to this criterion. 
The study design is open-label and uncontrolled, thus being difficult to interpret in the pivotal setting. The 
sought indication has only been tested in 59 patients in group 1, 78 patients in group 2 and 56 patients 
in Group 3. In Study 1540, patients received cemiplimab until progression of disease, unacceptable 
toxicity or completion of planned treatment [3 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 96 weeks or 350 mg every 3 
weeks for 54 weeks]. If patients with locally advanced disease showed sufficient response to treatment, 
surgery with curative intent was permitted. Tumour response assessments were performed every 8 or 9 
weeks (for patients receiving 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 350 mg every 3 weeks, respectively). In general, 
the study design is considered acceptable. Although such design was considered an acceptable way 
forward at the time of scientific advice, the CHMP highlighted that demonstrating longer survival benefit, 
in a randomised controlled study would have been a preferable option. 
Overall, ORR can be accepted as the primary endpoint of the phase II study, but robustness of the 
response assessment and compelling results for ORR would be considered highly important for single arm 
uncontrolled studies. At present, it is not known whether ORR or PFS are surrogates for OS or clinical 
benefit in patients with CSCC that receive immunotherapy. Important secondary efficacy endpoints such 
as DoR, PFS and OS, were not corrected for multiplicity, hence are only considered exploratory.  
The planned interim analysis for Group 2 was finalised on 22 September 2017. at a very late stage when 
the study was ongoing (amendment 5) and the first data cut-off date was 27th October 2017. This initially 
prompted a major objection as it cannot be excluded that the decision to conduct an interim analysis on 
Group 2 was not data driven.  However, the updated efficacy results from data cutoff of 20 September 
2018 for Groups 1 and 3, and 10 October 2018 for Group 2.showed that there were a majority of patients 
that had duration of response longer than 6 months, which is considered clinically meaningful, providing 
some reassurance on the robustness of the data. However, median follow-up time since start of treatment 
is still limited (16.5, 9.3, and 8.1 months in Groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively; 9.4 months for the ITT 
population). 
Study 1423, a phase 1 study of cemiplimab with 2 expansion cohorts designed to obtain preliminary 
clinical experience with cemiplimab in patients with advanced CSCC was considered as supportive study. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Results are presented from 193 patients in Study 1540. Of these 193 patients, 115 had mCSCC and 78 
had laCSCC. The median age was 72 years (range: 38 to 96): seventy-eight (40.4%) patients were 75 
years or older, 66 patients (34.2%) were 65 to less than 75 years, and 49 patients (25.4%) were less 
than 65 years. A total of 161 (83.4 %) patients were male, and 187 (96.9%) patients were White; the 
ECOG performance score was 0 (44.6%) or 1 (55.4%). Almost all recruited patients were white (98.3% 
in mCSCC and 100% in laCSCC group) and male (enrolment rate was 57% for females and 74% for 
males) which is in line with epidemiological data on CSCC.  
Thirty-three and 7/10 per cent (33.7%) of patients had received at least 1 prior anti-cancer systemic 
therapy, 90.2% of patients had received prior cancer related surgery, and 67.9% of patients had received 
prior radiotherapy. Among patients with mCSCC, 76.5% had distant metastases, and 22.6% had only 
nodal metastases.

A primary analysis was possible for the entire population of the study since all 193 patients (in the 3 
groups) had the opportunity for at least 3 response assessments. The current IRC-assessed ORR results 
are consistent for each group: 49.2% in Group 1, 43.6% in Group 2 and 39.3% in Group 3 (the 
commercially intended dose). Of note, the lower bound of the 95% CI is beyond the range of clinically 
insignificant effect (≤15% ORR in Group 1 and Group 3, ≤25% in Group 2) in all 3 groups. INV-assessed 
response –a secondary endpoint– produced similar data and is considered supportive. An ORR of 44.0% 
(95% CI: 36.9, 51.3) in advanced CSCC patients may represent clinical benefit for this population, 
particularly when considering known ORRs for other available treatments (34-86% for chemotherapy,21, 
22, 23,3 16% for gefitinib,18 28% for cetuximab19 and 31% for panitumumab20). The DeCOG analysis 
provides some “real world” experience in advanced CSCC in the EU, although the number of patients 
included in the analysis as well as information on the treatments received by patients is very limited. The 
ORR achieved in the analysis was 25.6%. 
DoR is a secondary endpoint which is critical in order to establish a clinical benefit. Taking into 
consideration the mechanism of action of cemiplimab, it is assumed that the establishment of partial or 
complete response could occur in the first or in a second or ulterior assessment (delayed response from 
immunotherapy). Hence, DoR may not be considered as a valid endpoint until all the data are sufficiently 
mature. In addition, DoR analysis is affected by the low number of events, i.e., relapses. Overall, only 
10.6% of the responding patients have relapsed, 17.2%, 8.8% and 4.5% in Groups 1 to 3, respectively. 
At this point, only data from Group 1 (median follow-up 16.5 months) have enough maturity for an 
accurate assessment. Considering the longer follow-up for Group 1, 27 out of 29 patients (93%) have a 
response that has lasted for 6 months or longer. DoR is ≥6 months for 68% of patients from Group 2 (23 
out 34) and 64% of patients from Group 3 (14 out of 22), although it is expected that these rates might 
increase with further follow-up. 
Two sensitivity analyses that assign either an OS or PFS event to patients who had ended the study due 
to other reasons and were not undergoing active follow-up were requested from the applicant. In this 
worst-case scenario, there is no detrimental effect on OS and PFS outcome of patients with advanced 
CSCC treated with cemiplimab. Compared to the initial analyses before 30-June-2018 data cut-off, 
updated IRC-PFS results are nearly identical for Group 1 (28 events in 59 patients, mPFS 18.4 months, 
6-month-PFS 66.0%) and minimally improved for Group 3 (26 events in 56 patients, mPFS 10.4 months, 
6-month-PFS 59.3%).  
PFS  is  increased  for  patients  treated  with  cemiplimab  at  a  dose  of  3  mg/kg  Q2W  in  mCSCC  patients 
compared with the fixed dose of 350 mg Q3W: 18.4 vs. 10.4 months. The data is based on median PFS 
estimates where roughly half of the events have occurred in both groups (47.5% in Group1, 46.4% in 
Group 3). There is no clear explanation for this discrepancy, however, the data is based on few patients 
and it is expected that with longer follow-up, the PFS for Group 3 will improve with further follow up. 
With 9.4 months of median follow-up time and 18% of events (34 in 193 patients), OS results are too 
immature to draw any clear conclusion.  
Of the 219 patients with mCSCC and laCSCC treated with cemiplimab, 25.1% (55/219) were less than 65 
years, 34.2% (75/219) were 65 to less than 75 years, and 40.6% (89/219) were 75 years or older. No 
overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger 
subjects. 
In the 193 patients in the efficacy analysis, the objective response rate by ICR (95% CI) was 40.8% 
(27.0%, 55.8%) in patients less than 65 years, 48.5% (36.0%, 61.1%) in patients 65 to less than 75 
years, and 42.3% (31.2%, 54.0%) in patients 75 years or older. 
The relationship between PD-L1 status and efficacy was analysed post-hoc in patients with available 
tissue samples and not from a systematic biopsy sampling of the patients’ tumours. Based on the limited 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/368468/2019  
Page 103/163 
 
 
 
number of patients with tumour samples, clinical activity seems to be observed regardless of tumour 
PD-L1 expression status (see section 5.1 of SmPC). An updated analysis was provided where the PD-L1 
status from 75 out of 219 patients with advanced CSCC treated with cemiplimab (61 from Study 1540 and 
14 from 1423) was presented. ORR for mCSCC patients and laCSCC designated PD-L1 <1% was 60% and 
35.3%, respectively (total was 41%) whereas in patients designated PD-L1 ≥1%, ORR was 56.3% and 
54.1%, respectively (Total was 55%). Only 21 of out these 75 patients with valid PD-L1 status had 
mCSCC, the rest had laCSCC. This suggests that for patients with laCSCC that had low PD-L1 expression, 
ORR was also lower compared with mCSCC and hence, PD-L1 might not be predictive for efficacy for this 
patient population with cemiplimab. Nonetheless, while the data is not conclusive, based on the 
mechanism of action of cemiplimab, the results for mCSCC are considered clinically meaningful. There is 
not enough data to be able to restrict the indication based on PD-L1 expression, and hence, further 
investigation of efficacy by PD-L1 would be warranted. Therefore, the MAH should investigate biomarkers 
in order to confirm that PD-L1 expression is not predictive of efficacy.  
As study 1540 was a single arm trial, no firm conclusion can be drawn from the QoL data, although no 
detrimental effect was observed in any of the EORTC QLQ-30 subscales. 
None of the patients experienced ADA or neutralizing antibody to cemiplimab. The titers that were 
observed were low and there was no indication of clinical impact or exposure. The fact that none of the 
140 patients included in the immunogenicity population developed ADAs or neutralizing antibodies to 
cemiplimab does not preclude from the risk of ADA. Data are too scarce and there is also a concern about 
the ADA test’s sensitivity. Although additional experiments suggest that the methods for immunogenicity 
testing are considered adequate with regard to drug tolerance, the current immunogenicity database is 
too limited to conclude on the risk. For these reasons, the phrase “lack of effect due to anti-drug 
antibodies” has been included at the RMP. 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
cemiplimab in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of all conditions included in the 
category of malignant neoplasms, except haematopoietic and lymphoid tissue (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA 
The data from study 1540 shows a compelling ORR rate of 44% in patients with laCSCC and mCSCC 
treated with cemiplimab. DoR, the key secondary efficacy endpoint, is beyond 6 months for at least 93% 
of patients from Group 1 (limited follow-up challenges interpretation of DoR for Groups 2 and 3). ORR is 
a clinically relevant endpoint in this cutaneous malignancy. However, the study did not have a comparator 
and there were few patients recruited and treated with the recommended posology of 350 mg Q3W for 
mCSCC, especially in the patient population for laCSCC. These uncertainties cannot be answered by the 
current single arm trial 1540 alone and hence further confirmatory data is needed on the efficacy and 
safety of cemiplimab for the treatment of patients with metastatic or locally advanced CSCC who are not 
candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation. Therefore, the CHMP has requested that the 
applicant conducts a prospective single-arm study in the same population with a defined sample size to 
confirm the clinical efficacy and safety of cemiplimab in the intended indication and posology of 350 mg 
Q3W. The study should incorporate an investigative plan to provide biomarker data to confirm the 
predictive value of PD-L1. Furthermore, it is recommended that the study characterises other possible 
biomarkers which may predict efficacy responses in patients treated with cemiplimab. The study protocol 
should be discussed within 3 months of the approval and before initiation of the study/cohort. Since there 
is no long term efficacy data, it is still unknown whether responses to cemiplimab are durable and that 
may lead to a prolongation of duration of response and/or an effect on PFS and ultimately an improved OS

in the long term. The final clinical study report for Study 1540 (Groups 1-3) should be submitted in order 
to provide comprehensive data on DoR, PFS and OS.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The study 1540 has shown a compelling ORR rate of 44% in patients with laCSCC and mCSCC treated with 
cemiplimab. DoR, the key secondary efficacy endpoint, is beyond 6 months for at least 93% of patients 
from Group 1 (limited follow-up challenges interpretation of DoR for Groups 2 and 3) which provides 
further support to the efficacy observed. The available data on the expression of PD-L1 suggest that this 
biomarker may lack predictive value to determine tumour responses in the intended indication. Although 
the magnitude of the effect is not completely defined, the efficacy in terms of ORR is considered clinically 
relevant and suggests that a proportion of patients may benefit from a prolongation in the duration of 
response which could ultimately result in a positive effect on PFS or OS. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the context 
of a conditional MA: 
• 
• 
In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of cemiplimab for the treatment of patients with 
metastatic or locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma who are not candidates for 
curative surgery or curative radiation, the MAH should provide interim data of a single-arm trial in 
the same population [study 1540 group 6]. The MAH should investigate biomarkers in order to 
confirm that PD-L1 expression is not predictive of efficacy.  
The study should be conducted according to an agreed protocol. Due date 31st March 2023 
In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of cemiplimab for the treatment of patients with 
metastatic or locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma who are not candidates for 
curative surgery or curative radiation, the MAH should submit the final study report for Groups 
1-3 in the phase 2 pivotal study 1540. Due date 31st October 2022. 
The CHMP recommends the following measures to address the issues related to efficacy: 
• 
To investigate and characterise in all ongoing and planned studies, a biomarker or set of 
biomarkers that can predict efficacy responses in patients treated with cemiplimab.

Safety data are presented mainly from two studies and data have been pooled into three pools. As the 
sought indication for cemiplimab is monotherapy, the safety pool that is considered most relevant is the 
monotherapy patients, because patients in safety pool 3 had cemiplimab in combination with 
chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The patients in safety pool 2 or the Monotherapy Pool encompassed CSCC 
patients from pool 1 (n=163 patients) plus all non-CSCC patients receiving monotherapy, except HCC 
(n=77 patients), but with updated safety data the numbers increased to 297 monotherapy patients in 
total. The number of patients who received the proposed dosing regimen of 350 mg cemiplimab Q3W has 
increased from 23 to 56 patients.

Adverse drug reactions 
The safety of cemiplimab has been evaluated in 591 patients with advanced solid malignancies including 
219 advanced CSCC patients who received cemiplimab monotherapy in 2 clinical studies (R2810 ONC 
1423 and R2810 ONC 1540). Immune related adverse reactions occurred in 20.1% of patients treated 
with cemiplimab in clinical trials including Grade 5 (0.7%), Grade 4 (1.2%) and Grade 3 (6.1%). 
Immune-related adverse reactions led to permanent discontinuation of cemiplimab in 4.4% of patients. 
The most common immune-related adverse reactions were hypothyroidism (7.1%), pneumonitis (3.7%), 
immune-related skin adverse reactions (2.0%), hyperthyroidism (1.9%) and hepatitis (1.9%) (see 
“Description of selected adverse reactions” below, Special warnings and precautions for use in section 4.4 
and Recommended treatment modifications in section 4.2). Adverse reactions were serious in 8.6% 
patients and led to permanent discontinuation of cemiplimab in 5.8% of patients. 
Listed below are adverse reactions by system organ class and by frequency. Frequencies are defined as: 
very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to 
<1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from available data). Within each 
frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness.

Summary of treatment-emergent immune-related adverse events (irAEs 
requiring systemic corticosteroids and endocrine-related irAEs based on 
Sponsor-provided list) by composite/preferred term and NCI grade (Safety 
analysis set) 
Immune-related AEs (irAEs) were reported as potential and identified events (required steroids or were 
endocrinopathies), and overall all grade potential irAEs occurred frequently in approximately half of the 
patients but ≥grade 3 events rarely occurred (7.7% for monotherapy patients). Identified irAEs were 
observed of all grade in approximately a quarter of the patients and ≥grade 3 events were observed in 
6.7% of the monotherapy patients vs only 1.8% in the CSCC 350mg patients. Common identified irAEs 
were hypothyroidism (8.8%), pneumonitis (4.7%), and arthralgia (2.0%). Considering the sample size of 
the CSCC 350mg patients (n=56), it may be concluded that the AEs, SAEs, and irAEs were observed of 
similar incidence between the groups and no major safety concerns are raised at this point. 
The selected adverse reactions described below are based on the safety of cemiplimab in monotherapy 
patients and in the total 591 patients in uncontrolled clinical studies. 
Pneumonitis 
Potential Immune-Related Pneumonitis: Updated safety data show that 16 (5.4%) of the monotherapy 
patients had an event of all grade and 1.7% had a grade 3-5 event. 
Identified Immune-Related Pneumonitis:  Updated safety data show that 14 (4.7%) of the monotherapy 
patients had an event of all grade and 1.7% had a grade 3-5 event. Pneumonitis is an uncommon event, 
rarely of high-grade and seldom treated with high-dose corticosteroids. However, the event led to 
permanent discontinuation and is potentially fatal. In conclusion, the event was rare and seem clinically 
manageable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/368468/2019  
Page 119/163 
 
 
 
 
 
Immune-related pneumonitis occurred in 22 (3.7%) of 591 patients receiving cemiplimab, including 2 
(0.3%) patients with Grade 5, 2 (0.3%) patients with Grade 4, and 6 (1.0%) patients with Grade 3 
pneumonitis. Immune-related pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of cemiplimab in 11 (1.9%) 
of 591 patients. Among the 22 patients with immune-related pneumonitis, the median time to onset was 
3.8 months (range: 7 days to 18 months) and the median duration of pneumonitis was 21.5 days (range: 
5 days to 6.5 months). Eighteen patients (3.0%) received high-dose corticosteroids for a median of 8.5 
days (range: 1 day to 5.9 months). Resolution of pneumonitis had occurred in 14 (63.6%) of the 22 
patients at the time of data cut-off. 
Colitis 
Potential Immune-Related Colitis: Updated safety data show that 34 (11.4%) of the monotherapy 
patients had an event of all grade and 0.3% had a grade 3-5 event. 
Identified Immune-Related Colitis: Updated safety data show that 6 (2.0%) of the monotherapy patients 
had an event of all grade and 0.3% had a grade 3-5 event. 
Potential events of colitis were rather frequent (11.4%), but the identified events were actually very rare 
(2.0%) and there were only 1 grade 4-5 event, which is reassuring. These numbers may reflect that 
diarrhea was common with cemiplimab but not immune-related. 
Immune-related diarrhoea or colitis occurred in 7 (1.2%) of 591 patients receiving cemiplimab including 
2 (0.3%) with Grade 3 immune-related diarrhoea or colitis. Immune-related diarrhoea or colitis led to 
permanent discontinuation of cemiplimab in 1 (0.2%) of 591 patients. Among the 7 patients with 
immune-related diarrhoea or colitis, the median time to onset was 3.8 months (range: 15 days to 6.0 
months) and the median duration of immune-related diarrhoea or colitis was 30 days (range: 4 days to 
8.6 months). Four patients (0. 7%) with immune-related diarrhoea or colitis received high-dose 
corticosteroids for a median of 29 days (range: 19 days to 2.0 months). Resolution of immune-related 
diarrhoea or colitis had occurred in 4 (57.1%) of the 7 patients at the time of data cut-off. 
Hepatitis 
Potential Immune-Related Hepatitis: Updated safety data show that 20 (6.7%) of the monotherapy 
patients had an event of all grade and 1.3% had a grade 3-5 event. 
Identified Immune-Related Hepatitis: Updated safety data show that 3 (1.0%) of the monotherapy 
patients had an event of all grade and 1.0% had a grade 3-5 event. 
Potential immune-related hepatitis was observed in approximately 7% of patients; however, few of these 
had identified events. These events were rarely grade 3 or more, and the patients were treated with 
high-dose corticosteroids with good results so immune-related hepatitis is not considered a major clinical 
concern with cemiplimab.  
Immune-related hepatitis occurred in 11 (1.9%) of 591 patients receiving cemiplimab including 1 (0.2%) 
patient with Grade 5, 1 (0.2%) patient with Grade 4, and 9 (1.5%) patients with Grade 3 immune-related 
hepatitis. Immune-related hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of cemiplimab in 5 (0.8%) of 
591 patients. Among the 11 patients with immune-related hepatitis, the median time to onset was 
1.0 month (range: 7 days to 4.2 months) and the median duration of hepatitis was 15 days (range: 8 
days to 2.7 months). Ten (1.7%) patients with immune-related hepatitis received high-dose 
corticosteroids for a median of 10.5 days (range: 2 days to 1.9 months). Resolution of hepatitis had 
occurred in 8 (72.7%) of the 11 patients at the time of data cut-off. 
Hyperthyroidism 
Identified Immune-Related Hyperthyroidism: Updated safety data show that six (2.0%) of the 
monotherapy patients had an event of all grade and none had a grade 3-5 event. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/368468/2019  
Page 120/163 
 
 
 
Hyperthyroidism occurred in 11 (1.9%) of 591 patients receiving cemiplimab including 1 (0.2%) patient 
with Grade 3 hyperthyroidism. No patient discontinued cemiplimab due to hyperthyroidism. Among the 
11 patients with hyperthyroidism, the median time to onset was 1.9 months (range: 28 days to 14.8 
months).  
Hypothyroidism 
Identified Immune-Related Hypothyroidism: Updated safety data show that 26 (8.8%) of the 
monotherapy patients had an event of all grade and none had a grade 3-5 event. 
Hypothyroidism occurred in 42 (7.1%) of 591 patients receiving cemiplimab including 1 (0.2%) patient 
with Grade 3 hypothyroidism. No patient discontinued cemiplimab due to hypothyroidism. Among the 
42 patients with hypothyroidism, the median time to onset was 4.2 months (range: 15 days to 
18.9 months). 
Hypophysitis 
Identified Immune-Related Hypophysitis: Updated safety data show that one (0.3%) of the monotherapy 
patients had a grade 3-5 event. 
Immune-related hypophysitis occurred in 1 (0.2%) of 591 of patients receiving cemiplimab. The event 
was Grade 3 hypophysitis. 
Adrenal insufficiency 
Identified Immune-Related Adrenal Insufficiency: Updated safety data show that 1 (0.3%) of the 
monotherapy patients had a grade 3-5 event. 
Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 3 (0.5%) of 591 patients receiving cemiplimab including 1 (0.2%) 
patient with Grade 3 adrenal insufficiency. No patient discontinued cemiplimab due to adrenal 
insufficiency. Among the 3 patients with adrenal insufficiency, the median time to onset was 11.5 months 
(range: 10.4 months to 12.3 months). One of the 3 patients was treated with systemic corticosteroids. 
Diabetes 
Identified Immune-Related Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus: Updated safety data show that 1 (0.3%) of the 
monotherapy patients had a grade 3-5 event. 
Type 1 diabetes mellitus without an alternative aetiology occurred in 4 (0.7%) of 591 patients including 
3 (0.5%) patients with Grade 4 and 1 (0.2%) patient with Grade 3 type 1 diabetes mellitus. Type 1 
diabetes mellitus led to permanent discontinuation of cemiplimab in 1(0.2%) of 591 patients. Among the 
4 patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus, the median time to onset was 2.3 months (range: 28 days to 6.2 
months). 
Skin reactions 
Potential Immune-Related Skin Adverse Reactions: Updated safety data show that 58 (19.5%) of the 
monotherapy patients had an event of all grade and 1.0% had a grade 3-5 event. 
Identified Immune-Related Skin Adverse Reactions: Updated safety data show that four (1.3%) of the 
monotherapy patients had an event of all grade and 0.3% had a grade 3-5 event. 
Many of the potential immune-related skin events were not confirmed, so the frequency of identified 
events is low. The event required high-dose steroids in the vast majority of patients, but it is considered 
a manageable event. The underlying disease may also mimic skin reactions and therefore it is acceptable 
that so many events were considered potential immune-related skin events. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/368468/2019  
Page 121/163 
 
 
 
Immune-related skin adverse reactions occurred in 12 (2.0%) of 591 patients receiving cemiplimab 
including 6 (1.0%) patients with Grade 3 immune-related skin adverse reactions. Immune-related skin 
adverse reactions led to permanent discontinuation of cemiplimab in 2 (0.3%) of 591 patients. Among the 
12 patients with immune-related skin adverse reactions, the median time to onset was 1.5 months 
(range: 2 days to 10.9 months) and the median duration was 4.4 months (range: 14 days to 9.6 months). 
Nine patients (1.5%) with immune-related skin adverse reactions received high-dose corticosteroids for 
a median of 16 days (range: 7 days to 2.6 months). Resolution had occurred in 6 (50%) of 12 patients at 
the time of data cut-off. 
Nephritis 
Potential Immune-Related Nephritis: Updated safety data show that nine (3.0%) of the monotherapy 
patients had an event of all grade and 0.3% had a grade 3-5 event. 
Identified Immune-Related Nephritis: Updated safety data show that two (0.7%) of the monotherapy 
patients had an event of all grade and 0.3% had a grade 3-5 event. 
Possible immune-related nephritis was observed in 9 patients but less than a third of these had identified 
events. Two patients had high-dose steroids and all of the events were resolved at data cut-off, which is 
considered encouraging. In conclusion, immune-related nephritis is considered acceptable and clinically 
manageable. 
Immune-related nephritis occurred in 3 (0.5%) of 591 patients receiving cemiplimab including 2 (0.3%) 
patients with Grade 3 immune-related nephritis. Immune-related nephritis led to permanent 
discontinuation of cemiplimab in 1 (0.2%) of 591 patients. Among the 3 patients with immune-related 
nephritis, the median time to onset was 1.8 months (range: 29 days to 4.1 months) and the median 
duration of nephritis was 18 days (range: 9 days to 29 days). Two (0.3%) patients with immune-related 
nephritis received high-dose corticosteroids for a median of 1.5 months (range: 16 days to 2.6 months). 
Resolution of nephritis had occurred in all patients at the time of data cut-off. 
Other immune-related adverse reactions 
The following clinically significant identified immune-related AEs occurred in the monotherapy patients: 
Meningitis (1 patient; ), Myalgia (1 patient),, Arthritis (2 patients), Autoimmune Myocarditis (1 patient),  
Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy (1 patient), Encephalitis (1 patient),  
Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (1 patient), Paraneoplastic Encephalomyelitis (1 patient), Sjogren's 
Syndrome (1 patient), and Vasculitis (1 patient; Grade 2). 
Other immune-related events were rarely observed, however, they included serious events such as 
meningitis, autoimmune myocarditis, and a cluster of events in the CNS. These autoimmune events are 
expected and acceptable at this level with a PD-1 inhibitor, and updated safety data with longer exposure 
has not increased the incidences, so the low observed risk seems reliable. 
The following clinically significant, immune-related adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of less than 
1% of 591 patients treated with cemiplimab. The events were grade 3 or less unless stated otherwise:  
Nervous system disorders: Meningitisa (Grade 4), Paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis (Grade 5), 
Guillain-Barre syndrome, central nervous system inflammation, Chronic inflammatory demyelinating 
polyradiculoneuropathy, Encephalitisb, Myasthenia gravis, Neuropathy peripheral.

Immune-Related Adverse Reactions in Patients Previously Treated With Idelalisib 
Two patients in Study R1979-ONC-1504, a study of cemiplimab as monotherapy or in combination with 
REGN1979 (CD20xCD3 bispecific antibody) in patients with B-cell malignancies, experienced fatal 
mucocutaneous toxicity after a single dose of cemiplimab monotherapy, and a third patient developed 
life-threatening Myositis and Myasthenia Gravis following 2 doses of cemiplimab. A common element in 
their prior treatment history was therapy with idelalisib.   
A total of 8 patients in Study R1979-ONC-1504 received idelalisib, including 1 patient who received 
idelalisib after discontinuing cemiplimab. Of the other 5 patients, 3 patients did not develop severe 
toxicity at any time during therapy, and 2 patients experienced SAEs or TEAEs of special interest: 
Infusion-related reactions

In all CSCC patients,  most patients (98.6%) had at least one AE and 43.8% had high-grade events (≥
grade 3). Two-thirds (66.%) of these patients had treatment-related AEs, most frequently fatigue 
(31.5%), diarrhea (22.8%), nausea (20.1%), pruritus (18.3%) and  maculo-papular rash (10%). 
Overall, the most common TEAEs in the All CSCC patients were fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, and pruritus. It 
is noted that for the CSCC 350mg patients, rash was more fr equently observed (16.1% vs. 14.2%) while 
diarrhea was less frequent (14.3% vs 22.8%). More than grade 3 events occurred in 43.8% of all CSCC 
monotherapy patients and 11% of the patients had at least 1 treatment-related grade ≥ 3 event. The 
incidence for the CSCC 350mg patients were similar, i.e. 37.5% and 12.5% had ≥grade 3 events and 
treatment-related ≥grade 3 events, respectively. 
Laboratory findings 
For the ongoing studies R2810-ONC-1423 and R2810-ONC-1540, the applicant has notified the 
Rapporteur on the 15th of June that they have identified some errors in units and normal ranges for some 
laboratory values.  
The applicant has prepared and sumitted an erratum, which includes corrections to the original laboratory 
data due to new or updated laboratory normal ranges (LNRs) and the overview has been updated 
accordingly. No new safety concerns have been raised.

Haematological toxicity and coagulation deficiencies were very rarely observed as high-grade events and 
the commonly observed low-grade events in this category may not be treatment-related but caused by 
the underlying disease.

High-grade events were observed in almost 10% of the patients in the monotherapy patients, most 
frequently hypophosphatemia and hyponatremia, which can be frequently observed in under-nourished 
cancer patients and the elderly. The risk of deviating electrolytes during treatment with cemiplimab is not 
of major concern.

Table 96: 
Selected treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities in ≥15% in all grades of 
pool 1 patients 
Creatinine was increased in a quarter of the patients but grade 3-4 events were rarely observed. This is 
considered a reflection of the pre-treated elderly patient population, commonly treated with 
platinum-containing chemotherapy. Therefore, this event is not considered to be of any major concern. 
It is agreed that the high frequency of hypoalbuminaemia even in cemiplimab monotherapy group 
(37.8%, grade 3 to 4, 1.3%) is related to the poor nutritional status of the study patients and it is not 
considered a new safety signal. 
Vital signs 
Vital signs were assessed prior to each cemiplimab infusion Q2W or Q3W and approximately 30 minutes 
(Study 1423) or 15 minutes (Study 1540) after the completion of each infusion. In addition, since there 
was no clinical experience with cemiplimab at the inception of Study 1423, on cycle 1 day 1, vital signs 
were collected every 30 minutes for the first 4 hours post-infusion and at 6 and 8 hours after study drug 
administration. Small variations in mean and median weight, blood pressure, and heart rate were seen 
over time, but none indicated a trend towards an overall increase or decrease.   
Electrocardiogram 
In Pool 3, there were some shifts from normal to abnormal in ECG findings during the studies; a clinically 
significant shift was reported in 1 (0.2%) patient. This patient was in Study 1540 (Patient 036004001) in 
Group 1 (mCSCC 3 mg/kg cemiplimab IV Q2W) on study day 114. The abnormalities included the 
following values: ECG ventricular rate (52 beats/minute), PR duration (224 msec), QRS duration 
(106 msec), QT duration (466 msec; baseline value was 464 msec), and RR duration (1153 msec). The 
repeat ECG, which was taken 1 minute after the clinically significant ECG abnormalities were observed, 
did not have clinically significant abnormalities. An AE of Atrioventricular Block First Degree was reported 
for this patient. At the time of data cutoff, the patient had received another 10+ months of cemiplimab 
without other IRRs or cardiac events and continued study treatment.    
There were no clinically relevant changes from baseline in the QTc interval or ECG abnormalities; 
observed ECG findings were typical of the patient population (Table 29). Monoclonal antibodies such as 
cemiplimab, in general, are not expected to prolong QT intervals.

Table 97: 
Summary of patients with potential treatment-emergent ECG abnormalities 
(Safety analysis set) 
Events concerning vital signs and ECG changes are not considered of major concern and it may be agreed 
that the observed events may be due to the elderly patient population and not the study drug. 
Immunogenicity 
Approximately 1.17% of all patients receiving 3 mg/kg cemiplimab IV Q2W developed 
treatment-emergent antibodies to cemiplimab. Antibody titers were low to moderate. No patients 
developed neutralizing antibodies. None of the patients with CSCC developed treatment-emergent 
antibodies. 
Approximately 0.29% of all patients receiving 3 mg/kg cemiplimab IV Q2W had persistent antibody 
responses defined as having at least 2 consecutive positive post-baseline samples separated by at least 
16 weeks.  
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity with cemiplimab. Five out of 398 
patients (1.3%) administered cemiplimab developed treatment-emergent antibodies, with 1 out of 398 
patients (0.3%) exhibiting persistent antibody responses. No neutralizing antibodies have been 
observed. There was no evidence of an altered pharmacokinetic or safety profile with anti-cemiplimab 
antibody development.  
In the few patients who developed anti-cemiplimab antibodies, there was no evidence of altered PK 
profile. The presence of ADA was not associated with significant AEs or irAEs. 
ADA was rarely associated to cemiplimab treatment at the present time.

There were more upper respiratory tract infections (10.9%), headache (12.7%), and dizziness (10.9%) 
in the <65 years group. In the older groups over 65 years, cough (13-16%) and increased creatinine 
(4-11.6%) were more frequently observed.  
Gender 
There was a high proportion of male patients in all 3 Pools (75.8% of the monotherapy patients).

Adverse events according to sex show increased risk of diarrhea (31.9% vs 18.2%), cough (20.8% vs 
12.4%), UTIs (11.1% vs. 5.3%), pain in extremity (12.5% vs. 5.3%) in female patients compared to 
male patients. 
Ethnicity 
Adverse  events  according  to  ethnicity  is  very  difficult  to  assess  as  the  vast  majority  of  patients  were 
categorized  as  not  hispanic  or  latino  (n=276)  and  only  17  patients  were  in  the  one  other  category 
(hispanic or latino). There are no obvious safety concerns but considering the small sample size of the 
comparator group, no firm conclusions can be made from these data. 
Race 
For monotherapy patients, no conclusions can be drawn with regard to race as the majority of patients 
were White (n=280) and the comparable groups contained 5 or 6 patients each. In the larger population 
of Pool 3, there was no apparent difference in the AE profile with regard to race. However, no obvious 
safety concerns are raised.

Extrinsic factors 
Region 
Most patients were from North America (101 patients in Pool 1; 371 patients in Pool 3), followed by 
Europe (22 patients in Pool 1; 119 patients in Pool 3), and “Others” (40 patients in Pool 1; 44 patients in 
Pool 3).  
Adverse events according to region were presented with 3 categories: North America (n=184), Europe 
(n=58) and others (n=55). GI disorders, fatigue, cough and hypothyroidism were increased in the North 
American group. No major safety concern arise considering the differences of sample size (data not 
shown). 
Prior systemic therapy 
Updated safety data show that the adverse events did not increase clinically significantly with increasing 
lines of prior systemic therapy (data not shown).  
Prior radiotherapy 
It is noted that more than 2/3 of the patients had 0 or 1 prior radiotherapy. There are no apparent 
correlation between increasing number of radiotherapy and adverse events, however, the limited number 
of patients who received more than 2 numbers of radiotherapy should be taken into consideration. There 
are no major safety concerns regarding increasing risk of AEs with increasing prior therapies (data not 
shown). 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No PK drug-drug interaction studies have been submitted (see assessment of clinical pharmacology).

The updated table demonstrates that the proportion of patients with TEAEs that result in cemiplimab 
interruption or delay in patients with CSCC has slightly increased (from 28% to 33%) regarding the first 
data cut-off (original MAA). The main cause for such interruptions/delays remains infections/infestations 
(24 out of 72 patients – one third overall), with respiratory disorders in second place (14 out of 72) and 
GI disorders in third (12 out of 72). The most common specific symptoms/syndromes leading to 
interruptions or delays in the administration of cemiplimab were diarrhoea (9 out of 72, 12.5%), 
pneumonitis (10%) and infusion-related reactions (10%). This accounts for the expected safety profile 
from an anti-PD-1 antibody.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety of cemiplimab has been evaluated in 591 patients with advanced solid malignancies including 
219  advanced  CSCC  patients  who  received  cemiplimab  monotherapy  in  2  clinical  studies 
(R2810-ONC-1423  and  R2810-ONC-1540).  Immune-related  adverse  reactions  occurred  in  20.1%  of 
patients treated with cemiplimab in clinical trials including Grade 5 (0.7%), Grade 4 (1.2%) and Grade 3 
(6.1%). Immune-related adverse reactions led to permanent discontinuation of cemiplimab in 4.4% of 
patients.  The  most  common  immune-related  adverse  reactions  were  hypothyroidism  (7.1%), 
pneumonitis (3.7%), skin adverse reactions (2.0%), hyperthyroidism (1.9%) and hepatitis (1.9%) (see 
“Description of selected adverse reactions” below, Special warnings and precautions for use in section 4.4 
and  Recommended  treatment  modifications  in  section  4.2).  Adverse  reactions  were  serious  in  8.6% 
patients and led to permanent discontinuation of cemiplimab in 5.8% of patients. 
Severe  cutaneous  adverse  reactions  (SCARs),  including  Stevens-Johnson  syndrome  (SJS)  and  toxic 
epidermal  necrolysis  (TEN)  have  been  reported  in  association  with  cemiplimab  treatment  (see 
section 4.4). 
Immune-related adverse reactions can occur with cemiplimab. Most of these, including severe reactions, 
resolved following initiation of appropriate medical therapy or withdrawal of cemiplimab (see “Description 
of selected adverse reactions” below). 
A tabulated list of adverse reactions and description of selected adverse reactions is displayed in the 
SmPC section 4.8.  
Almost every monotherapy patient (98%) had at least one AE and a third of these events were of high 
grade (≥grade 3). Two-thirds of the patients had treatment-emergent AEs, most frequently fatigue 
(31.3%), diarrhea (21.5%), and nausea (18.2%). Treatment-related high-grade events were rarer, i.e. 
33 (11.1%) patients experienced at least one grade ≥3 treatment-related TEAE. There were no clinically 
meaningful differences in treatment-related AEs between patients with CSCC and non-CSCC. 
Adverse events of special interest include immune-related events and the most commonly identified 
events were hypothyroidism and pneumonitis, of which only a small fraction of pneumonitis were 
high-grade events and this is considered reassuring. Overall, endocrinopathies were observed in a 
number of patients, the events were mostly clinically manageable and the frequency of events was as 
expected with this class of immunotherapy.  
Hyperthyroidism was rare and none of the events required high-dose steroids to resolve. The duration 
was long and only approximately a third of the events had resolved by data cutoff, reflecting that this is 
mostly a non-serious but prolonged event that is considered clinically manageable. Hypothyroidism on

the other hand, is much more frequent (8.8%), which is expected with PD-1 inhibitors, and could also be 
managed without high-dose steroids. Hypophysitis was rare and the one patient observed with this event 
had to be treated with high-dose steroids. The serious event of adrenal insufficiency was also rare and 
observed in only 1 patient on monotherapy. Diabetes was seldom observed, but the event lead to 
discontinuation of cemiplimab in one patient. overall, endocrinopathies were observed in a number of 
patients, the events were mostly clinically manageable as well as expectable with this class of 
immunotherapy.  
Immune-related  endocrinopathies,  defined  as  treatment-emergent  endocrinopathies  with  no  clear 
alternate aetiology, have been observed in patients receiving cemiplimab (see section 4.8). 
Thyroid disorders (Hypothyroidism/Hyperthyroidism) 
Immune-related  thyroid  disorders  have  been  observed  in  patients  receiving  cemiplimab.  Thyroid 
disorders can occur at any time during the treatment. Patients should be monitored for changes in thyroid 
function at the  start of treatment and periodically during the treatment as indicated based on clinical 
evaluation  (see  section  4.8).  Patients  should  be  managed  with  hormone  replacement  therapy  (if 
indicated) and cemiplimab treatment modifications. Hyperthyroidism should be managed according to 
standard medical practice (see section 4.2). 
Hypophysitis 
Immune-related  hypophysitis  has  been  observed  in  patients  receiving  cemiplimab  (see  section  4.8). 
Patients  should  be  monitored  for  signs  and  symptoms  of  hypophysitis  and  managed  with  cemiplimab 
treatment modifications and corticosteroids (see section 4.2). 
Adrenal insufficiency 
Adrenal  insufficiency  has  been  observed  in  patients  receiving  cemiplimab  (see  section  4.8).  Patients 
should  be  monitored  for  signs  and  symptoms  of  adrenal  insufficiency  during  and  after  treatment  and 
managed with cemiplimab treatment modifications and corticosteroids (see section 4.2). 
Type 1 Diabetes mellitus 
Immune-related type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, has been observed in patients 
receiving cemiplimab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for hyperglycaemia and signs and 
symptoms  of  diabetes  as 
indicated  based  on  clinical  evaluation  and  managed  with  oral 
anti-hyperglycaemics or insulin and cemiplimab treatment modifications (see section 4.2).  
Cemiplimab should be withheld and anti-hyperglycaemics or insulin should be administered in patients 
with  severe  or  life-threatening  (Grade  ≥ 3)  hyperglycaemia.  Cemiplimab  should  be  resumed  when 
metabolic control is achieved on insulin replacement or anti-hyperglycaemics (see section 4.2). 
Severe and fatal immune-related adverse reactions have been observed with cemiplimab (see section 
4.8). These immune-related reactions may involve any organ system. Most immune-related reactions 
initially  manifest  during  treatment  with  cemiplimab;  however,  immune-related  adverse  reactions  can 
occur after discontinuation of cemiplimab. 
Immune-related adverse reactions should be managed with cemiplimab treatment modifications, 
hormone replacement therapy (if clinically indicated), and corticosteroids. For suspected immune-related 
adverse reactions, patients should be evaluated to confirm an immune-related adverse reaction and to 
exclude other possible causes. Depending upon the severity of the adverse reaction, cemiplimab should 
be withheld or permanently discontinued (see section 4.2). 
Overall, 67 monotherapy patients died during the studies, most frequently due to disease progression. 
There were only few deaths that could be considered treatment-related (7 patients), considering the 
Assessment report

stage of disease, the large fraction of heavily pre-treated and elderly patients in the study population, this 
is considered acceptable.  
Treatment-emergent SAEs were common during treatment (30.3% in the monotherapy pool) and most 
often related to pneumonitis or infections (12.1%). This may be due to the underlying disease as the 
damaged skin or ulcerations functions as an entry for bacteria, causing both local and systemic infections. 
The elderly patient population is also more prone to urinary tract infections, which was also relatively 
commonly observed. However, the level of treatment-emergent SAEs is considered acceptable since 
there were few treatment-related events recorded, as well as considering the underlying disease, its 
prognosis, and the patient population.  
Immune-related skin adverse reactions, defined as requiring use of systemic corticosteroids with no clear 
alternate  aetiology,  including  severe  cutaneous  adverse  reactions  (SCARs),  such  as  Stevens-Johnson 
syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal outcome), and other skin 
reactions  such  as  rash,  erythema  multiforme,  pemphigoid,  have  been  reported  in  association  with 
cemiplimab treatment (see section 4.8).  
Patients should be monitored for evidence of suspected severe skin reactions and exclude other causes. 
Patients  should  be  managed  with  cemiplimab  treatment  modifications  and  corticosteroids  (see 
section 4.2).  
Cases  of  SJS,  fatal  TEN  and  stomatitis occurred  following  1  dose of  cemiplimab  in  patients  with  prior 
exposure to idelalisib, who were participating in a clinical trial evaluating cemiplimab in Non-Hodgkins 
Lymphoma (NHL), and who had recent exposure to sulfa containing antibiotics (see section 4.8). Patients 
should be managed with cemiplimab treatment modifications and corticosteroids as described above (see 
section 4.2). 
Immune-related  pneumonitis,  defined  as  requiring  use  of  corticosteroids  with  no  clear  alternate 
aetiology, including fatal cases, has been observed in patients receiving cemiplimab (see section 4.8). 
Patients  should  be  monitored  for  signs  and  symptoms  of  pneumonitis.  Patients  with  suspected 
pneumonitis should be evaluated with radiographic imaging as indicated based on clinical evaluation and 
managed with cemiplimab treatment modifications and corticosteroids. (see section 4.2). 
Immune-related diarrhoea or colitis, defined as requiring use of corticosteroids with no clear alternate 
aetiology,  has  been  observed  in  patients  receiving  cemiplimab  (see  section  4.8).  Patients  should  be 
monitored  for  signs  and  symptoms  of  diarrhoea  or  colitis  and  managed  with  cemiplimab  treatment 
modifications, anti-diarrhoeal agents, and corticosteroids (see section 4.2). 
Immune-related hepatitis, defined as requiring use of corticosteroids with no clear alternate aetiology, 
including  fatal  cases,  has  been  observed  in  patients  receiving  cemiplimab  (see  section  4.8).  Patients 
should be monitored for abnormal liver tests prior to and periodically during treatment as indicated based 
on  clinical  evaluation  and  managed  with  cemiplimab  treatment  modifications  and  corticosteroids  (see 
section 4.2). 
Immune-related nephritis 
Immune-related nephritis, defined as requiring use of corticosteroids with no clear alternate aetiology, 
has been observed in patients receiving cemiplimab (see section 4.8). Patients should be managed with 
cemiplimab treatment modifications and corticosteroids (see section 4.2). 
Other immune-related adverse reactions 
Other  fatal  and  life-threatening  immune-related  adverse  reactions  have  been  observed  in  patients 
receiving cemiplimab including paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis and meningitis (see section 4.8 for other 
immune-related adverse reactions). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/368468/2019  
Page 149/163 
 
 
 
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of immune-related adverse reactions and managed 
with cemiplimab treatment modifications and corticosteroids (see section 4.2). 
Infusion-related reactions 
Cemiplimab  can  cause  severe  or  life-threatening  infusion-related  reactions  (see  section  4.8).  Patients 
should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions and managed with cemiplimab 
treatment  modifications  and  corticosteroids.  Cemiplimab  should  be  interrupted  or  the  rate  of  infusion 
slowed for mild or moderate infusion-related reactions. The infusion should be stopped and cemiplimab 
should be permanently discontinued for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) infusion-related 
reactions (see section 4.2). 
Approximately  6%  of  patients  in  the  monotherapy  pool  discontinued  treatment  while  32.3%  of  the 
patients  had  drug  interruption  or  delay.  The  main  cause  for  such  interruptions/delays  remains 
infections/infestations (24 out of 72 patients – one third overall), with respiratory disorders in second 
place  (14  out  of  72)  and  GI  disorders  in  third  (12  out  of  72).  The  most  common  specific 
symptoms/syndromes  leading  to  interruptions  or  delays  in  the  administration  of  cemiplimab  were 
diarrhoea (9 out of 72, 12.5%), pneumonitis (10%) and infusion-related reactions (10%).  
Increasing number of patients had serious adverse events with increasing age, and it is noted that the 
rate doubled when comparing patients <65 years of age (21.0%) to patients aged 75-84 years of age 
(42.0%). There were also more events with increasing age leading to hospitalisation and that were 
considered life threatening. The rate of AEs leading to drop out, cardiac disorders and infections and 
infestations increased markedly with increasing age. As the group of patients over 85 years consisted of 
21 patients, no firm conclusions can be drawn from the results from this small subgroup.  
ADA was rarely associated to cemiplimab treatment at the present time. 
Patients excluded from clinical studies 
Patients that had active infections or that were immunocompromised were not included in the main study. 
For a full list of patients excluded from clinical trials, see section 5.1. In the absence of data, cemiplimab 
should be used with caution in these populations after careful evaluation of the balance of benefits and 
risks for the patient. 
The safety and efficacy of LIBTAYO in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years have not been 
established. No data are available. 
Human IgG4 is known to cross the placental barrier and cemiplimab is an IgG4; therefore, cemiplimab 
has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing foetus. Cemiplimab is not 
recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception 
unless the clinical benefit outweighs the potential risk.  
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Lactation 
It is unknown whether cemiplimab is secreted in human milk. It is known that antibodies (including IgG4) 
are secreted in human milk; a risk to the breast-feeding newborns/infants cannot be excluded. If a 
lactating woman chooses to be treated with cemiplimab, she should be instructed not to breast-feed while 
being treated with cemiplimab and for at least 4 months after the last dose. 
Cemiplimab has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue has been 
reported following treatment with cemiplimab (see section 4.8). 
In case of overdose, patients must be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, and 
appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted.

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are 
asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of 
the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
The safety database shows no new safety concern for cemiplimab. The ADRs were mostly manageable 
and toxicity was tolerable with the recommended treatment modifications as described in the SmPC as 
well as with the additional risk minimisation activities. It is of note that only a fraction of patients in the 
safety database have received the proposed dosing regimen of 350 mg Q3W (n=56 patients). Duration of 
exposure is 171.8 patient-years for the 219 CSCC patients, out of which 33.9 patient-years correspond to 
the 350 mg Q3W dose. Thus, a comprehensive safety profile and long term safety of comprehensive 
safety profile of cemiplimab in the proposed dosing cannot be characterized at the present time. However 
the available safety data are considered adequate in the context of a conditional marketing authorisation; 
due to the limited exposure and sample size of patients who received the intended dosing regimen, in 
addition to no randomisation with a control arm of another comparable treatment, the remaining 
uncertainties should be addressed with the collection of additional safety data in the context of the 
specific obligation of study 1540 group 6 for the conditional marketing authorisation. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
No new unexpected safety concerns have been raised during the course of the study for cemiplimab, an 
anti-PD-1 antibody. Considering the disease being treated and the aging patient population from studies 
1540 and 1423, the safety profile of cemiplimab corresponds to what can be expected from an anti-PD-1 
antibody. The level of observed adverse events and immune-related events are considered acceptable, 
however due to limited exposure and small sample size of patients who received the dosing regimen 
intended for commercialisation, safety data will be collected in the context of the specific obligation of 
study 1540 group 6 for the conditional marketing authorisation.  
All prescribers of LIBTAYO should be familiar with the educational materials and inform the patients about 
the Patient Alert Card explaining what to do should they experience any symptom of immune-related 
adverse reactions and infusion-related reactions. The physician will provide the Patient Alert Card to each 
patient. In addition, a patient guide is also distributed as part of the educational material on identifying, 
notifying and reporting suspected ADRs.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.0 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle 
with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 28.09.2018. The new EURD list entry will therefore use 
the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that cemiplimab has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in the 
European Union. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/368468/2019  
Page 154/163 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers cemiplimab to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, LIBTAYO (cemiplimab) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as: 
• 
• 
it contains a new active substance authorised in the EU after 1 January 2011; 
it has been given a conditional approval (where the applicant that is going to market the medicine must 
provide more data about it) 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The applicant is seeking the following indication: 
LIBTAYO as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic or locally 
advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative 
radiation. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The major treatment options for CSCC with features that suggest a low-risk for recurrence and metastasis 
are surgical excision, cryotherapy, electrosurgery, and radiation therapy. Radiation therapy is an 
additional option for the management of primary CSCCs in older patients and those who are not surgical 
candidates.  
Although the probability of surgical cure for most patients with CSCC is high, the disease course is 
devastating for the small percentage of patients who develop metastatic CSCC or locally advanced CSCC, 
collectively referred to as advanced CSCC. There is no approved systemic treatment or guidelines for 
advanced CSCC. Overall, use of available treatments is limited by inconclusive efficacy data and 
substantial safety risks due to the advanced age of CSCC population. Therefore, there is an unmet 
medical need for an effective treatment option with an acceptable safety profile in patients with advanced 
CSCC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/368468/2019  
Page 155/163 
 
 
 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The applicant has submitted results from Studies 1423 and 1540 evaluating cemiplimab in patients with 
locally advanced and metastatic CSCC.  
Study 1540 is an ongoing, phase 2, open-label, single-arm, 3-group, multicentre pivotal study evaluating 
efficacy, safety, and PK of cemiplimab in patients with metastatic CSCC (mCSCC) (Group 1: 3mg/kg Q2W 
and Group 3:350 mg Q3W) or locally advanced CSCC (laCSCC) (Group 2: 3mg/kg Q2W) who are not 
candidates for surgery or radiation. The primary endpoint is ORR, and the key secondary endpoint is DoR. 
Data cutoff is 20 Sep 2018 for Groups 1 and 3, and 10 Oct 2018 for Group 2. Median follow-up time since 
start of treatment is still limited (16.5, 9.3, and 8.1 months in Groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively; 9.4 months 
for the ITT population). 
Primary analysis was possible for the entire population of the study since all 193 patients (59 patients in 
Group 1, 78 in Group 2 and 56 in Group 3) have had the opportunity for at least 3 response assessments. 
Study 1423 (considered supportive) is a phase 1, open-label, ascending-dose escalation study of 
cemiplimab, alone and in combination with various combination therapy treatments in patients with 
advanced solid tumours. Two expansion cohorts (7 and 8) were designed to obtain additional clinical 
experience with cemiplimab 3 mg/kg Q2W in patients with metastatic and unresectable locally advanced 
CSCC, respectively. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Study 1540:  
The IRC-assessed ORR results are consistent for each group: 49.2% in Group 1, 43.6% in Group 2 and 
39.3% in Group. The lower bound of the 95% CI is beyond the range of predefined clinically insignificant 
effect (≤15% ORR in Group 1 and Group 3, ≤25% in Group 2) in all 3 groups.  
DoR is ≥6 months for 68% of patients from Group 2 (23 out 34) and 64% of patients from Group 3 (14 out 
of 22). It is of note that there is a longer follow-up for Group 1 (median 16.5 months) where 27 out of 29 
patients (93%) have a response that has lasted for 6 months or longer. 
Updated PFS results are nearly identical for Group 1 (28 events in 59 patients, mPFS 18.4 months, 
6-month-PFS 66.0%) and minimally improved for Group 3 (26 events in 56 patients, mPFS 10.4 months, 
6-month-PFS 59.3%).  
Responses were seen with a similar ORR in most age subgroups across all three groups of treatment. In 
75 patients assessable for PD-L1 status, responses occurred across PD-L1 subgroups, even in 
low-expressing subjects.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Although the ORR data is considered compelling, data are limited to a small number of patients and is not 
considered comprehensive, especially in Group 3 which was treated with the 350 mg Q3W posology. The 
applicant has committed to provide updated efficacy data from Study 1540 (from Groups 1-3) and 
additional efficacy and safety data from a new cohort (Group 6 in study 1540) in post-authorisation to 
confirm the efficacy data (see SOB). 
The limited data available to assess the impact of PD-L1 expression on the efficacy of cemiplimab do not 
indicate that PD-L1 status has a predictive value for response to treatment. Although cemiplimab use is 
not restricted to PD-L1 positive patients, it is of importance to evaluate the predictive value of PD-L1 as 
well as other biomarkers in CSCC. As a consequence, the applicant should provide additional robust data 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/368468/2019  
Page 156/163 
 
 
 
on PD-L1 in the confirmatory single arm study to confirm the use of cemiplimab in all patients regardless 
of PD-L1 status. 
There is also uncertainty as to whether the efficacy observed in terms of tumour response is maintained 
for a prolonged period in the long term by cemiplimab treatment leading to an improvement in PFS or OS. 
With 9.4 months of median follow-up time and 18% of events (34 in 193 patients), OS results are too 
immature to be assessed.  
Because of the uncertainty on long term efficacy with cemiplimab, the applicant should submit the final 
results of study 1540 for ORR, PFS and OS. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety of cemiplimab has been evaluated in 591 patients with advanced solid malignancies including 
219 advanced CSCC patients who received cemiplimab monotherapy in 2 clinical studies (R2810 ONC 
1423 and R2810 ONC 1540).  
The most common adverse reactions were: diarrhoea, rash, pruritus and fatigue. Immune related 
adverse reactions occurred in 20.1% of patients treated with cemiplimab in clinical trials including Grade 
5 (0.7%), Grade 4 (1.2%) and Grade 3 (6.1%).  
Immune-related adverse reactions led to permanent discontinuation of cemiplimab in 4.4% of patients. 
The most common immune-related adverse reactions were hypothyroidism (7.1%), pneumonitis (3.7%), 
immune-related skin adverse reactions (2.0%), hyperthyroidism (1.9%) and hepatitis (1.9%) (see 
section 4.8 SmPC). Adverse reactions were serious in 8.6% patients and led to permanent discontinuation 
of cemiplimab in 5.8% of patients.  
Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic 
epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in association with cemiplimab treatment (see section 
SmPC 4.4). 
There were 12 patients (2%) that had a fatal TEAE. 
Infusion-related reactions occurred in 54 (9.1%) of 591 patients treated with cemiplimab including 1 
(0.2%) patient with Grade 3 infusion-related reaction. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Only a fraction of patients have received the proposed dosing regimen of 350 mg Q3W (n=56 patients). 
Duration of exposure is 171.8 patient-years for the 219 CSCC patients, out of which 33.9 patient-years 
correspond to the 350 mg Q3W dose. Therefore, there is uncertainty of the safety of cemiplimab in the 
long term and for the safety at the dose to be used in clinical practice. As a comprehensive safety dataset 
of cemiplimab in the proposed dosing is not available at the present time, the applicant has committed to 
collect safety data in the confirmatory study as part of the conditional marketing authorisation. 
The fact that apparently none of the 140 patients –with ADA samples available– across groups tested 
positive for ADAs has raised doubts on the detection method (ADA screening assay). Therefore, there is 
uncertainty on the lack of effect due to anti-drug antibodies as no ADA was detected in the ADA detection 
assays. This has been included in the RMP as an important potential risk.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The applicant has presented PK, clinical efficacy and safety data for patients treated with the fixed 350 mg 
Q3W dose and 3mg/kg Q2W, and the conclusion following assessment of these data is that the 350 mg 
Q3W dose is overall as efficacious and safe as the 3 mg/kg Q2W dose. The applicant has shown a 
compelling total ORR rate of 44% in patients with laCSCC and mCSCC treated with cemiplimab. DoR, the 
key secondary efficacy endpoint, is beyond 6 months for at least 93% of patients from Group 1 (limited 
follow-up challenges interpretation of DoR for Groups 2 and 3), which brings some reassurance to the 
robustness of the clinical efficacy. The limited available clinical data in patients that have undergone 
biopsies so far seem to suggest that expression of PD-L1 lacks predictive value in CSCC patients in the 
intended indication.  
There were no new safety risks identified with cemiplimab. Considering the disease being treated and the 
aging patient population from studies 1540 and 1423, the safety profile of cemiplimab corresponds to 
what can be expected from an anti-PD-1 antibody.  The most common adverse reactions were rash, 
fatigue, diarrhoea and pruritus. The most common immune-related adverse reactions were 
hypothyroidism, pneumonitis, immune-related skin adverse reactions, hyperthyroidism and hepatitis. 
Pneumonitis events were low which was considered reassuring and overall, endocrinopathies were 
observed in a number of patients, the events were mostly clinically manageable as well as expectable with 
this class of immunotherapy. Therefore, the level of observed adverse events and immune-related events 
are considered acceptable, however due to limited exposure and small sample size of patients who 
received the recommended dosing regimen, additional safety data will need be included in the 
confirmatory study. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The high unmet medical need for patients with advanced CSCC has been acknowledged as there are few 
systemic treatment options that have shown efficacy. The clinical benefit observed for cemiplimab in this 
population is encouraging and is considered clinically meaningful in terms of ORR. Therefore, the clinical 
benefit outweighs the toxicity and safety risks which are considered manageable through 
recommendations in the SmPC as well as additional risk minimisation activities, which include a patient 
guide and patient alert card. Although the efficacy and safety data are still not considered comprehensive 
enough for a full marketing authorisation, the benefit risk balance is considered positive.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
In order to exclude patients who were not appropriate candidates for curative radiation, the wording of 
the indication has been amended to include patients who are not candidates for curative surgery or 
curative radiation. The indication also includes the word “adult” in order to clarify the target age group. As 
the efficacy has been shown in patients exposed or not to previous systemic chemotherapy treatment, the 
indication was not restricted to a line of therapy.  
Conditional marketing authorisation 
As comprehensive data on the product are not available, a conditional marketing authorisation was 
proposed by the CHMP during the assessment, after having consulted the applicant. 
The product falls within the scope of Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 concerning conditional 
marketing authorisations, as it aims at the treatment of a seriously debilitating and life-threatening 
disease as CSCC can metastasize and inadequate treatment can result in increased morbidity and death.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/368468/2019  
Page 159/163 
 
 
 
Furthermore, the CHMP considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
authorisation: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive, as discussed above. The applicant has presented clinically 
meaningful ORR and DOR in both laCSCC and mCSCC. The safety is clinically manageable and in line 
with other anti PD1/PD-L1 agents. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data. The efficacy data in mCSCC 
is based in only 56 patients that have had more than 3 response assessments at the recommended 
posology of 350 mg Q3W and for laCSCC efficacy is based in 78 patients in a posology of 3 mg/kg 
Q2W. Therefore, the applicant has committed to providing confirmatory data from a new cohort of 
patients (cohort 6 from study 1540) which will enrol both mCSCC and laCSCC and treated with the 
recommended posology of 350 mg Q3W. The new cohort of patients with the same disease 
characteristics for advanced CSCC (mCSCC and laCSCC) will be adequate to confirm both efficacy 
and safety of cemiplimab at the recommended posology 350 mg Q3W. In addition, further follow up 
efficacy for PFS and OS will be submitted as part of the specific obligation in the final study report for 
Study 1540 (Groups 1-3), providing further confirmatory data. 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed, as currently there is no standard of care or approved 
therapy for advanced CSCC and patients have usually been treated with EGFR targeting drugs 
and/or chemotherapy which have shown to have low rates of ORR and DOR and no compelling effect 
on other important endpoints such as PFS and OS, which are of very short duration.   
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that 
additional data are still required. Cemiplimab has shown efficacy in advanced CSCC and a clinical 
benefit in terms of a compelling effect on ORR with a DoR ≥6 months in 93% of patients in group 1, 
68% of patients from Group 2 (23 out 34) and 64% of patients from Group 3 (14 out of 22).  
Cemiplimab is an anti-PD-1 which is a class of products that have been on the market for some 
years. This is the first treatment option in this setting for which a beneficial effect has been 
demonstrated. The submitted PFS data is promising and therefore it is expected that PFS will be 
improved in the long term. Although few patients were treated with the 350 mg Q3W, it was 
demonstrated that the 350 mg Q3W dose was overall as efficacious and safe as the 3 mg/kg Q2W 
dose. No unexpected safety concerns have been identified during the assessment of cemiplimab 
compared to the known safety profile for this class of products. Treating physicians are becoming 
more familiar with managing immune-related ADRs associated with anti-PD-1 treatment, in 
addition, cemiplimab will be marketed with additional risk minimisation activities (patient guide and 
alert card), which will minimise any of the risks related to the important safety concerns.   
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of LIBTAYO is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considers  by  consensus 
decision that the benefit-risk balance of LIBTAYO is favourable in the following indication:

Based on the need to provide comprehensive data to confirm the efficacy and safety of cemiplimab in the 
intended indication with the recommended posology, a conditional marketing authorisation is proposed 
by the CHMP, after having consulted the applicant. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation subject to the 
following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to launch of Libtayo in each Member State, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) must agree 
about the content and format of the educational programme, including communication media, 
distribution modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with the National Competent Authority.  
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where Libtayo is marketed, all healthcare professionals 
and patients/carers who are expected to prescribe and use Libtayo have access to/are provided with the 
following educational package: 
- A patient guide  
- A patient alert card 
•  The patient guide shall contain the following key messages 
Assessment report

o  Description of the main signs or symptoms of the immune-related adverse reactions 
(pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, immune-related skin adverse reactions, 
nephritis and other irARs) and infusion related reactions, and the importance of notifying their 
treating physician immediately if symptoms occur 
o  The importance of not attempting to self-treat any symptoms without consulting their 
healthcare professional first 
o  The importance of carrying the Patient Alert Card at all times and to show it at all medical 
visits to healthcare professionals other than the prescriber (e.g. emergency healthcare 
professionals). 
o  A reminder that all known or suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) can also be reported 
to local regulatory authorities. 
•  The patient alert card shall contain the following key messages:  
o  A warning message for health care professionals treating the patient at any time, including in 
conditions of emergency, that the patient is treated with Libtayo 
o  Description of the main signs or symptoms of the immune-related adverse reactions 
(pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, immune-related skin adverse reactions, 
nephritis and other irARs) and infusion related reactions, and the importance of notifying their 
treating physician immediately if symptoms occur 
o  The contact details of their Libtayo prescriber  
Specific Obligation to complete post-authorisation measures for the 
conditional marketing authorisation 
This being a conditional marketing authorisation and pursuant to Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004, the MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the following measures: 
Description 
Due date 
In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of cemiplimab for the treatment of patients 
31 March 2023 
with metastatic or locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma who are not 
candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation, the MAH should provide interim 
data of a single-arm trial in the same population [study 1540 group 6]. The MAH should 
investigate biomarkers in order to confirm that PD-L1 expression is not predictive of 
efficacy.  
The study should be conducted according to an agreed protocol. 
In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of cemiplimab for the treatment of patients 
31 October 2022 
with metastatic or locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma who are not 
candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation, the MAH should submit the final 
study report for Groups 1-3 in the phase 2 pivotal study 1540. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product to be implemented by the Member States

SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
This  module  reflects  the  initial  scientific  discussion  for  the  approval  of  Zeffix.  This  scientific 
discussion  has  been  updated  until  1  March  2004.    For  information  on  changes  after  this  date

Introduction 
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the causative agent for acute and chronic hepatitis. Chronic hepatitis B is a 
common  disease  with  an  estimated  prevalence  of  more  than  300  million  long-term  carriers  of  the 
virus.  In  adult  HBV  carriers,  40  to  70  %  have  evidence  of  hepatitis  B  viral  replication  and  are  at 
highest  risk  of  developing  long-term  complications,  such  as  chronic  hepatitis,  cirrhosis  and 
hepatocellular  carcinoma  (approximately  1  %  per  year).  The  majority  of  infected  patients  will 
however spontaneously recover. HBV is a hepadnavirus (DNA virus). The infectious virus is a small-
enveloped  particle  with  an  outer  protein  coat  (hepatitis  B  surface  antigen  or  HBsAg)  and  an  inner 
protein core (hepatitis B core antigen or HBcAg). Hepatitis B e antigen or HBeAg is synthetised from 
a  messenger  RNA  (mRNA)  starting  from  core  (HBcAg)  mRNA.  Detection  of  HBeAg,  HBsAg  or 
HBV  DNA  in  the  serum  for  more  than  6  months  after  initial  infection  indicates  a  chronic  HBV 
infection. 
Currently the only established treatment for hepatitis B is repeated subcutaneous injections of alpha-
interferon,  an  immune  modulator,  which  is  not  very  well  tolerated.  In  a  meta-analysis  the  overall 
response rate was approximately 33 % after 4-6 months of treatment, as assessed by the disappearance 
of  HBeAg  in  serum.  However,  subgroups  of  patients  cannot  benefit  from  interferon  therapy 
(transplanted  patients,  severe  decompensated  cirrhotic  patients)  and  others  are  not  good  responders 
(pre-core mutants, patients with high level of HBV replication). 
Two oral formulations of Zeffix are available: film-coated tablet (each contains 100 mg lamivudine) 
and  oral  solution  (each  ml  contains  5  mg  lamivudine).  Lamivudine  is  a  nucleoside  analogue  with 
evidence of potent antiviral activity against Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Two formulations 
containing  lamivudine  (150  mg  film-coated  tablets  and  10  mg/ml  oral  solution)  have  already  been 
granted  a  Marketing  Authorisation  for  the  treatment  of  HIV  infection  in  combination  with  other 
antiretrovirals.  
The approved indication of Zeffix at the recommended dose of 100 mg lamivudine once daily is the 
following: 
Lamivudine is indicated for the treatment  of adult  patients with chronic  hepatitis B and  evidence  of 
viral replication  
- 
or  
- 
with decompensated liver disease  
with histologically documented active liver inflammation and/or fibrosis. 
This  indication  is  based  on  the  analysis  of  serological  and  histological  end  points  that  were  mainly 
derived from studies of one-year duration in HBeAg positive patients with compensated liver disease.

Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Composition  
The  pharmaceutical  development  of  Zeffix  is  relatively  straightforward  since  the  two  proposed 
pharmaceutical forms, film-coated tablet and oral solution are standard formulations and are similar to 
the  formulations  of  lamivudine  already  approved  for  the  treatment  of  HIV,  although  they  differ  in 
strength.

Film-coated tablet 
The excipients entering in the composition are common for immediate release film-coated tablets. The 
film-coat applied to mask the unpleasant taste of the active substance meets an in house specification.  
The  proposed  container  is  double  foil  blister  unit  made  of  aluminium  foil  laminated  with  polyvinyl 
chloride  (product  contact)  with  an  external  coating  of  polyamide  and  a  push-through  aluminium 
lidding. The blister contains 14 tablets per blister card (2 or 6 blister cards per carton). 
Oral solution 
The  oral  solution  consists  of  a  conventional  aqueous  solution.  The  proposed  container  is  a  240  ml 
opaque  white  round  high-density  polyethylene  bottle  with  child  resistant  closure.  The  10  ml  dosing 
device  consists  of  a  medium  density  polyethylene  syringe-adapter  and  a  clear  polypropylene  oral 
dosing  syringe.  Results  of  dose  assurance  and  compatibility  studies  have  been  submitted,  but  these 
studies have been conducted with the formulation of lamivudine already approved for the treatment of 
HIV.  
Active substance 
Lamivudine is the same active substance as that used in the medicinal products containing lamivudine 
already approved for the treatment of HIV infection. The quality of the active substance is therefore 
well established. The (-) enantiomer of lamivudine, which is less cytotoxic than the (+) enantiomer or 
the  racemate  is  selected  for  the  manufacture  of  the  finished  medicinal  product.  Two  polymorphic 
forms form I (partial hydrate) and form II have been identified. Manufacture of lamivudine involves 
four-step  synthesis,  which  includes  isolation  of  the  desired  stable  crystalline  form  (II).  Evidence  of 
structure is appropriate and complete, and the identification test ensures that only form II is used for 
the  manufacture  of  the  finished  product.  Validation  results  show  consistency  of  the  process  and  the 
quality of the product. 
Stability  studies  have  been  carried  both  under  accelerated  and  long-term  storage  conditions. 
Lamivudine  met  specifications  at  all  storage  conditions  up  to  18  months,  and  no  degradation  was 
observed.   
Other ingredients 
All  other  ingredients  entering  into  the  preparation  of  the  tablets  or  the  oral  solution  as  well  as  the 
packaging  components  meet  pharmacopoeial  requirements  except  the  film-coating  material  and  the 
flavours, which meet in-house specifications.  
Product development and finished product 
Film-coated tablets 
The  pharmaceutical  development  of  the  tablet  consisted  of  the  selection  of  components  allowing  a 
satisfactory flow and compression as well as a rapid disintegration/dissolution and good stability. The 
process development has been adequately addressed based on a detailed study of the critical steps of 
the  direct  compression.  Several  different  formulations  were  used  during  the  clinical  trials,  including 
hard gelatin capsules in early studies.  In addition, the active substance used in the clinical trials was 
manufactured  through  two  synthetic  routes,  which  produced  equivalent  material.  Results  from 
bioavailability studies indicated that the differences in the formulations and the synthetic routes of the 
active substance did not have any effect on the bioavailability. 
The  manufacturing  process  of  the  tablets  consists  of  the  conventional  stages  of  blending,  direct 
compression,  aqueous  film  coating  and  packaging.  Appropriate  in-process  controls  and  limits  are 
specified  and  tests  methods  are  adequately  described.  Results  from  the  validation  programme 
including 6 batches of different size are sufficient to demonstrate the consistency of the process and 
quality of the product.  
Stability  tests  have  been  carried  out  on  three-production  scale  batches  stored  under  long  term  and 
accelerated  conditions.  Based  on  the  observed  results  at  24  months,  the  proposed  shelf  life  of  
36 months when stored below 30ºC is acceptable. Long-term stability data will be further evaluated.

Oral solution 
During the development of the formulation, the pH of 6 has been shown to be the most appropriate to 
ensure  preservation  and  stability  of  the  oral  solution.  In-use  testing  studies,  performed  during  the 
stability programme, did not show any significant changes in the product 30 days after opening. 
The  composition  of  the  batches  used  during  the  clinical  trials  varied  in  terms  of  the  amount  of  the 
active  substance  and  in  terms  of  the  percentage  of  ethanol  incorporated.  The  ethanol  was  later 
withdrawn to provide greater dosing accuracy. The bioavailability between solutions with and without 
ethanol  has  been  demonstrated  as  well  as  the  bioavailability  between  the  tablet  formulation  and  the 
oral solution at equivalent doses. 
The manufacturing process is simple, including the preparation of the bulk solution, filtration, filling, 
capping and packaging. In-process controls are acceptable, limits are specified and tests methods are 
adequately  described.  The  validation  data  have  demonstrated  that  the  manufacturing  process  is  well 
controlled and reproducible.   
Stability  tests  have  been  carried  out  on  three-production  scale  batches  stored  under  stronger  stress 
conditions  compared  to  the  international  requirements,  which  is  therefore  acceptable.  The  results 
obtained  at  12  months  support  the  proposed  shelf  life  of  24  months  when  stored  at  or  below  25ºC. 
Data  also  showed  that  the  oral  solution  is  stable  30  days  after  opening.  Long-term  stability  will  be 
further evaluated.

Toxico-pharmacological aspects 
Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Lamivudine  is  an  antiviral  agent  with  a  pyrimidine  nucleoside  analogue  structure,  which  suppresses 
HBV viral replication by terminating HBV DNA chain elongation. 
Lamivudine  has  been  shown  to  enter  HBV  transfected  and  non-transfected  HepG2cells    (a  human 
hepatoma-derived cell-line) where it is phosphorylated to lamivudine 5’-monophosphate (active form 
of  the  parent  compound)  by  cytoplasmic  deoxycytidine  kinase.  Intracellular  phosphorylation  of  the 
monophosphate results in the formation of the 5’di- and 5’tri-phosphates. Lamivudine triphosphate has 
in vitro a long half-life in HBV-transfected cells (17 to 19 hours), supporting the use of the once daily 
regimen  in  humans.  Lamivudine  triphosphate  acts  as  a  substrate  of  HBV  viral  polymerase.  The 
formation of further viral DNA is blocked by incorporation of lamivudine triphosphate into the chain. 
Lamivudine 5’-triphosphate is selective and only a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerases α 
and β.  
Antiviral activity 
The specificity of lamivudine for HBV has been demonstrated by its lack of activity against a number 
of RNA and DNA viruses, apart from HIV and other microorganisms. 
Concentrations leading to 50 % inhibition of viral replication (IC50) are equivalent to 0.018 µM and 
0.022  µM  in  vitro  in  two  different  hepatoma  cell  lines.  Lamivudine  also  decreases  in  vitro  the 
intracellular duck hepatitis B virus DNA in duck hepatocytes with an IC50  value of 0.44 µM.  In vivo, 
lamivudine decreases serum HBV DNA levels in chronically infected chimpanzees at dosages of  
0.1  mg/kg  b.i.d  and  above,  and  reduces  HBV  DNA  polymerase  activity  to  below  10  %  of  pre-
treatment  levels  at  dosages  of  1-6  mg/kg  b.i.d.  Serum  levels  of  HBeAg  decrease  by  two-fold  in 
chronically infected chimpanzees treated with lamivudine at 10 mg/kg bid for 28 days. 
A  rebound  in  HBV  replication  has  however  been  observed  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  after  cessation  of 
treatment.  Chronic infection  of the hepatocytes may, however, be maintained  by the presence  in the 
nucleus of viral covalently closed circular (CCC) DNA, which is a template for viral transcription. 
The in vitro efficacy of lamivudine in combination with other compounds active against HBV is under 
investigation.

EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cytotoxicity 
In  human  hepatoma  cell  lines  stably  transfected  with  HBV-DNA,  lamivudine  shows  relatively  low 
cytotoxicity, which leads to a favourable therapeutic index.  
Genotypic changes associated with reduced sensitivity of HBV to lamivudine 
In patients with clinical evidence of HBV infection and reduced sensitivity to lamivudine, amino acid 
changes  in  the  YMDD  region  of  HBV  polymerase  gene  have  been  identified.  Three  consistent 
mutations have resulted in the following changes in the YMDD motif: 
• 
• 
Methionine to valine at amino acid 552 (M552V) plus leucine to methionine at amino acid 528 
(L528M) – Group B, C domains and I. 
Methionine to isoleucine at amino acid 552 (M552I) – Group II, B domain. 
In vitro, lamivudine has a markedly reduced inhibitory effect on the replication of Groups II mutants 
and I compared to the  wild type. Both mutant groups have IC50s in excess of 500 000 nM, which is 
more than 10 000 fold higher than that of the wild type (IC50 = 49 nM). Their effects have also been 
analysed separately. The issue of mutations is further described in part IV of this document. 
Studies intended to investigate potential secondary pharmacological effects of lamivudine have been 
previously  evaluated  and  did  not  reveal  any  clinically  significant  effect  on  the  central  or  autonomic 
nervous  systems,  nor  on  the  cardiovascular  or  respiratory  systems.  Only  a  few  new  studies  have 
therefore been carried out. A single dose safety pharmacology study in rats revealed that at  
300-mg/kg lamivudine slightly increased K+ excretion and osmolality by 36 % and 23 %, respectively 
compared to controls. A safety margin of 50 times greater than the approximate clinical dose of  
2 mg/kg has however been defined which justifies the clinical use. A second study on dogs revealed 
slight,  transient  heart  rate  increase  and  slight  ECG  wave  changes  at  a  dose  of  150  mg/kg.  The  no-
effect dose of 50 mg/kg intravenously, determined in this study, is expected to provide a safety factor 
of more than 50 times the human exposure.  
Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of lamivudine has been previously well established in the main animal species 
used in the toxicity studies. Nevertheless, further data characterising the profile have been submitted.  
Lamivudine  is  rapidly  and  extensively  absorbed  following  oral  administration  with  an  oral 
bioavailability of around 60 % in the rat and 80 % in the dog. Further investigations of in situ loops in 
the digestive tract in male rats showed that lamivudine is poorly absorbed from the stomach  
(3.6 %) but well absorbed from the duodenum (41.4 %), jejunum (54.8 %) and ileum (47.9 %) during 
a  period  up  to  1  hour  after  installation  in  situ  (2  mg/kg)  and  4.8  %,  66.4  %,  85.7  %  and  47.9  % 
respectively during a period up to 2 hours. The pharmacokinetics of lamivudine is linear.  
Lamivudine shows in vitro very low plasma protein binding in rat (3.1 - 5.1 %), dog (3.8 - 4.6 %) and 
man (4.7 - 7.0 %) in a concentration range of 0.01 - 10 µg/ml lamivudine. The ratios of distribution to 
the erythrocytes reported do not indicate any specific binding to erythrocytes. Lamivudine distributes 
rapidly  and  widely  to  tissues  and  no  signs  of  tissue  accumulation  have  been  found.  Lamivudine 
crosses the placenta of pregnant rats and rabbits and is distributed into milk. Appropriate information 
has therefore been included into section 4.6 of the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Following oral or intravenous administration of lamivudine (2 mg/kg) to rats, the majority of the dose 
(63 – 87 %) is excreted unchanged in the urine within the first 10 hours through active tubular renal 
excretion.  One  of  the  metabolites  identified  is  the  trans-sulphoxide  derivative  of  lamivudine.  The 
metabolic profile of lamivudine in humans is closer to the one observed in rats than in dogs. The (+) 
enantiomer was not detected in plasma or serum samples from either dog or man. This confirmed the 
absence of in vivo chiral inversion of lamivudine. 
Toxicokinetics data, previously submitted showed that the systemic exposure in animals exceeded the 
one in humans given therapeutic doses.  
4/18 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No  new  interaction  studies  have  been  performed  but  previous  data  suggested  a  lack  of  interactions 
between  lamivudine  and  a  number  of  concomitantly  administered  drugs.  Interactions  have  been 
reported between lamivudine and ganciclovir (weakening of the anti-HIV activity) and trimethoprim 
(impeding elimination). 
Toxicology  
Considering  that  the  administration  route  of  Zeffix  is  identical  to  the  one  of  the  formulations  of 
lamivudine  already  approved  for  HIV  treatment,  and  that  lower  clinical  dose  is  used  for  hepatitis  B 
infection  compared  to  HIV  infection  (100  mg/day  and  300  mg/day  respectively)  the  toxicological 
programme  previously  carried  out  provides  relevant  data.  No  new  studies  have  therefore  been 
performed. The main findings are listed below; 
Single  dose  toxicity  showed  that  the  acute  toxicity  of  lamivudine  is  low,  where  doses  up  to  
2000  mg/kg intravenously (mice and rats) or 2 x 2000 mg/kg orally (mice only) were well tolerated 
without signs of target organ toxicity.  
Repeated dose toxicity of lamivudine after oral administration was studied in rats (up to 6 months) and 
dogs  (up  to  12  months).  The  main  target  organ  of  toxicity  in  both  species  was  the  haematopoietic 
system  (anaemia,  decreased  platelet  count,  leucopenia  and  splenic  hemosiderosis).  Furthermore, 
following  high  doses  and  extended  exposure  periods,  impaired  liver  function  (raised  ALT  and  AST 
without major histological effects), and gastrointestinal effects (ulcers, inflammation) were observed. 
The  No  Observed  Effect  Level  (NOEL)  was  300-425  mg/kg/day  b.i.d.  in  rats  and  <  45-mg/kg/day 
b.i.d.  in  dogs.  In  monkeys,  white  blood  cell  counts  were  also  decreased  and  bone  marrow 
examinations revealed progressive delay in the maturation of all cell lines.  
Reproductive  function:  Lamivudine  did  not  impair  the  overall  reproductive  performance  in  rats. 
Embryonic  deaths  occurred  in  rabbits  when  lamivudine  was  given  to  pregnant  females,  at  exposure 
levels  comparable  to  those  in  human.  In  rats,  there  was  however  no  evidence  of  embryonic  loss  at 
exposure levels of approximately 60 times the clinical exposure. Lamivudine showed no teratogenic 
potential  in  either  species.  Peri-post  natal  studies  in  rats  did  not  raise  any  concerns.  On  the  basis  of 
these results, lamivudine should only be used in pregnant women if the benefit outweighs the risk as 
indicated into section 4.6 of the Summary of Product Characteristics.

(at doses ≥ 1000 µg/ml). It was also clastogenic in an in vitro cytogenicity test in human lymphocytes 
at  300  µg/ml,  which  is  150  times  higher  than  the  concentrations  observed  at  clinical  use  for  the 
treatment of HIV. However, no chromosomal damage was seen in in vivo tests in rats. Other in vitro 
and in vivo tests performed were also negative. Since these genotoxic effects have been observed only 
at concentrations considerably higher than those administered in clinical use, the genotoxic potential 
of lamivudine is considered acceptable.

The  carcinogenic  potential  of  lamivudine  was  studied  in  conventional  24-month  studies  in  rats  and 
mice. No signs of carcinogenic effects have been reported.  
In  local  tolerance  studies,  lamivudine  did  not  cause  ocular  or  cutaneous  irritation.  Furthermore,  the 
potential  for  hypersensitivity  reactions  was  low  and  there  was  no  indication  of  IgE  mediating 
properties.

Clinical aspects  
The clinical programme consisted of 13 pharmacokinetics studies, 8 phase II studies and 5 main phase 
III studies, including three  placebo-controlled  and two comparative  trials with interferon  to  evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of lamivudine. In addition 5 open label studies have been carried out. A total of 
1692  patients  were  included  in  the  phase  III  clinical  studies.  Of  the  1692  patients,  1174  received 
different dosages of lamivudine in monotherapy, 159 a combination of lamivudine and interferon, 70-
interferon  monotherapy  and  289  placebos.  An  overview  of  the  main  clinical  studies  performed  with 
lamivudine is presented in the clinical efficacy section of this document.

Clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacodynamics 
Lamivudine is a nucleoside analogue with an activity against HBV and HIV demonstrated in vitro, as 
well as in animal models as further discussed in part III of this report. Lamivudine is well tolerated in 
symptomatic  and  asymptomatic  patients  infected  with  HBV  or  HIV,  healthy  volunteers  and  in 
combination with commonly co-prescribed medications.  There were no clinically significant adverse 
effects  on  haemodynamic  measurements  or  laboratory  safety  tests  and  no  serious  adverse  events 
related  to  lamivudine.    However  no  special  pharmacodynamics  studies  have  been  conducted  in  the 
intended  indication.  The  HBV  genotypes  (genotypes  A-F)  have  been  shown  to  be  geographically 
distinct and their importance has been demonstrated but in the absence of genotyping in the different 
studies  performed,  it  is  not  possible  to  predict  whether  some  strains  may  be  more  susceptible  to 
lamivudine than others. 
Genotypic  changes  within  the  YMDD  locus  of  the  HBV  polymerase,  which  are  very  rarely 
spontaneously  observed,  have  been  reported  with  lamivudine  therapy.  Worldwide,  the  incidence  of 
YMDD  mutants is  23 %  after 1-year treatment. In the Asian study  (NUCB3018) this incidence was  
16  %  after  1-year  treatment,  42  %  after  2-year  or  53  %  after  3-year  lamivudine  treatment.  The 
incidence of this mutation may be influenced by the immune status of the patient (range 20 to 27 % in 
pre-  and  post-transplantation  recipients,  and  64  %  in  post-transplant  patients  only).  These  mutants 
were not detected before 24-week of treatment. As a result, no YMDD mutants could be detected in 
any patients treated with the combination lamivudine/alpha-interferon since the duration of treatment 
was only 24 weeks (lamivudine for 8 weeks followed by the combination of lamivudine and interferon 
for 16 weeks). The recommended daily dose was questioned as to whether it was the optimal one in 
terms of YMDD incidence but not enough data were available to suggest a lower mutation rate based 
on  higher  lamivudine  dose.  The  occurrence  and  selection  of  YMDD  mutations  could  be  associated 
with  the  following  factors:  race,  high  baseline  Knodell  Histological  Activity  Index  (HAI)  score, 
weight and body mass index. Other baseline variables significantly correlated with YMDD mutations 
are HBV DNA, gender, height and ALT (p < 0.1). YMDD mutants can arise in patients with mild or 
severe hepatitis but baseline viral load below 100 pg/ml seems to be associated with a lower risk of 
YMDD  mutations.  The  effect  of  lamivudine  on  YMDD  mutants  is  further  addressed  the  clinical 
efficacy section. 
In  addition,  a  total  of  18  mutations  (excluding  those  in  the  YMDD  locus  at  amino  acid  552  and  at 
amino acid 528) have been described, but these mutations have only been found in the presence of the 
YMDD  variants.  The  effect  of  these  additional  mutations  on  the  sensitivity  of  the  polymerase  to 
lamivudine is currently unknown. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Data  from  earlier  clinical  studies  carried  out  in  asymptomatic  HIV  infected  patients  were  submitted 
together with new studies conducted in healthy subjects and HBV positive patients. 
The  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  lamivudine  has  been  established  in  13  Phase  I  studies  where  224 
subjects have been exposed to lamivudine. Although a limited number of patients with hepatitis B was 
included  at  steady  state,  the  pharmacokinetics  of  lamivudine  at  100  mg  dose  per  day  has  been  well 
characterised. 
Absorption and distribution 
Lamivudine  is  rapidly  absorbed  from  the  gastro-intestinal  tract.  The  average  maximal  serum 
concentration  is  reached  in  approximately  one  hour.  At  the  therapeutic  dose  of  100  mg  once  daily, 
Cmax is approximately equivalent to  1.1  – 1.5 µg/ml and trough levels are 0.015  – 0.020 µg/ml. The 
oral  bioavailability  of  lamivudine  is  approximately  85  %.  Food  intake  results  in  slowing  down  the 
absorption (longer Tmax by 0.75 hours and decrease Cmax by 15 %), but does not significantly affect 
the extent of the absorption. Results from new studies confirm that lamivudine can be given with food 
or without food.  
Lamivudine  exhibits  linear  pharmacokinetics  over  the  therapeutic  dose  range  of  50-300  mg.  The 
volume  of  distribution  is  about  1.3  l/kg  suggesting  a  wide  tissue  distribution.  Binding  to  plasma 
proteins  is  low,  and  accounts  for  less  than  10  %.  Limited  data  show  that  lamivudine  penetrates  the 
6/18 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
central  nervous  system  and  reaches  cerebrospinal  fluid.  The  mean  lamivudine  CSF/serum 
concentration ratio 2-4 hours after oral administration was approximately 0.2. 
Metabolism and elimination 
The hepatic metabolism of lamivudine is low (5-10 %). Lamivudine is primary excreted through renal 
route via glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion (most likely the organic cationic transport 
system)  mainly  as  unchanged  drug  (>  70  %)  with  a  mean  systemic  clearance  of  approximately  
0.32  l/h/kg.  The  amount  of  urinary  trans-sulfoxide  metabolite  recovered  in  urine  is  minor.  The 
observed half-life of elimination is 5 to 7 hours. 
Special population 
Results  from  study  NUCB  1003,  which  involved  9  subjects  with  normal  renal  function  
(Clcr  >  60  ml/mn)  and  20  patients  with  renal  impairment  showed  that  there  is  a  linear  relationship 
between  lamivudine  clearance  and  renal  function  (assessed  as  creatinine  clearance).  In  case  of 
creatinine  clearance  reduction  between  20  and  50  ml/min,  the  AUC  average  increase  is  3  fold.  In 
another study (NUCB 1004) carried out in HIV infected patients with end-stage renal impairment, the 
AUC  average  increase  was  4  fold.  Based  on  these  data,  dose  adjustment  of  lamivudine  in  HBV 
infected  patients  is  also  recommended  according  to  the  value  of  the  creatinine  clearance.  This 
recommendation, which has been included in section 4.2, is in line with the one already included in 
the Summary of Product Characteristics of the lamivudine formulations approved for HIV treatment. 
Data  obtained  in  non-HBV  infected  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  hepatic  impairment  (NUCB 
1002) showed that lamivudine pharmacokinetics is  not significantly affected by hepatic dysfunction. 
These  results  support  the  use  of  lamivudine  in  patients  with  hepatic  impairment  without  any  dose 
adjustment  unless  accompanied  by  renal  impairment.  These  results  are  reflected  section  4.2  of  the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
The pharmacokinetics of lamivudine has been evaluated in the elderly (6 subjects over 65 years old) 
compared  to  younger  subjects  (6  of  approximately  20  years  old).  Results  indicated  that  no  dose 
modification is warranted based on the age only.   
No  data  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  lamivudine  in  HBV  infected  paediatric  patients  are  currently 
available and therefore lamivudine should not be used in this population. 
Interactions 
considering 
Lamivudine does not interact with the cytochrome P450 and therefore potential metabolic interactions 
are  limited.  Potential  interactions  with  substances  excreted  by  the  active  renal  secretion  cannot  be 
excluded 
route.  
Trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole  (160  mg/800  mg)  increases  lamivudine  exposure  by  40  %  by 
reducing  renal  elimination  whereas  lamivudine  has  no  effects  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of 
trimethoprim  or  sulphamethoxazole.  No  dosage  change  is  therefore  recommended.  Previous  studies 
performed in HIV infected patients showed no interaction between lamivudine and zidovudine.

Two studies have been carried out to investigate the potential interaction of lamivudine (100 mg) with 
alpha-interferon  (10  MUI).  One  study  involved  8  patients  with  hepatitis  B  (NUCB  2007)  and  one 
study involved 24 healthy volunteers (NUCB 1007). Results from both studies revealed no clinically 
significant changes of the pharmacokinetics of either substance when co-administered. 
Clinical efficacy 
All the studies were conducted according to GCP standards and agreed international ethical principles. 
The five completed main studies as well as the five open label studies aim to evaluate the efficacy of 
lamivudine in different type of population (e.g. naive, pre-core mutant patients, Asian). An overview 
of the main clinical studies is presented in the table below.

Dose response studies and main clinical studies 
Dose response studies 
Six  phase  II  studies  were  conducted  to  define  the  recommended  dose  of  lamivudine.  The  primary 
endpoint  was  the  suppression  of  HBV  DNA  as  assessed  by  Genostics  assay  (sensitivity  limit 
equivalent  to  1.3  pg/ml).  Secondary  endpoints  were  ALT  reductions  and/or  HBeAg  seroconversion. 
Lamivudine  was  administered  once  daily  for  1  to  6  months  at  doses  ranging  from  5  mg  to  600  mg  
(placebo,  5,  20,  25,  100,  300  and  600  mg).  In  these  studies  a  strong  dose  response  relationship  was 
observed. The maximal HBV DNA suppression occurred at the dose of ≥ 100 mg once daily. At this 
dose,  the  HBV  DNA  levels  were  reduced  by  median  95-99  %  from  baseline  in  all  studies  after  1-2 
weeks of treatment. However HBV DNA levels returned to baseline values shortly after treatment was

stopped.  Slight  ALT  reductions  were  observed  in  each  treatment  group  but  these  changes  were  too 
small  to  show  any  difference  between  treatment  groups.  On  the  basis  of  these  results,  the  dose  of  
100 mg lamivudine once daily was considered to be optimal in wild-type active chronic hepatitis B.  
Main clinical studies  
Population in the main studies 
Patients involved in the 5 main studies were in majority adult males Caucasian and Asian. No patients 
under 16 years old were enrolled. The inclusion criteria were the similar across the studies and patients 
had compensated chronic hepatitis B and evidence of HBV replication. The studies excluded patients 
co-infected  with  hepatitis  C  or  delta  virus,  autoimmune  hepatitis  or  HIV  infection,  decompensated 
liver  disease  and  previous  treatment  with  antiviral,  immunomodulatory,  and  systemic  cytotoxic  or 
corticosteroid therapy during the 6 months prior to screen.  
The overall percentage of withdrawal across the studies ranged between 3 and 21 % in the lamivudine 
groups compared to 4 to 78 % in the placebo group. 
Clinical endpoints 
Clinical  endpoints  for  assessing  the  efficacy  of  a  substance  in  chronic  hepatitis  B  are  prevention  of 
cirrhosis,  decompensated  liver  disease,  oesophageal  varices,  ascites,  hepatocellular  carcinoma  and 
survival. Different surrogate and histological evaluation criteria have been used to assess the efficacy 
of lamivudine:  
• 
Markers of the viral replication: 
-  HBV DNA suppression which represents a direct parameter to evaluate the activity of an 
antiviral agent 
-  HBeAg seroconversion (defined as HBeAg and HBV DNA loss and appearance of HBeAb 
that occur at least during 2 consecutive measurements and until the end of study) indicates 
a reduction of viral replication and a non-active disease, which is associated with a better 
prognosis in terms of progression of chronic liver disease. 
• 
Markers of the liver damage: 
-   Histological  response  (as  measured  by  Knodell  HAI  score  which  comprises  three 
components:  necrosis,  inflammation  and  fibrosis).  An  improvement  was  defined  as  a 
reduction in HAI score of at least 2 points 
-   Normalisation of elevated ALT levels as indicator of hepatocyte damage.  
The use of several endpoints has been judged appropriate although it is difficult to make comparison 
among the studies since the primary endpoint differs from one study to another one. 
Lamivudine in compensated hepatitis B patients 
Study NUCA 3010 
 The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  compare  lamivudine  100  mg  to  placebo  with  regard  to 
safety  and  effects  upon  liver  histology  after  52  weeks  treatment.  HBeAg  seroconversion  and  ALT 
normalisation  were  secondary  endpoints.    Patients  enrolled  in  this  study  were  characterised  by  the

Analysis  of  histological  response  from  baseline  to  week  52  revealed  a  statistically  significant 
difference in Knodell HAI score in favour of the lamivudine treatment group. 
Lamivudine  slowed  down  the  progression  of  fibrosis  compared  to  placebo.  Fibrosis  data  have  been 
further reported according to the Ishak  system,  which is a  modification  of the  Knodell HAI grading 
system  using  a  6  point  score  for  fibrosis.  The  magnitude  of  reduction  in  Ishak  staging  score  was 
greater with lamivudine compared to placebo but the clinical relevance of this reduction is unknown.  
With  respect  to  the  ALT  normalisation,  the  response  was  statistically  significant  in  favour  of 
lamivudine.  Lamivudine  has  demonstrated  a  rapid  effective  suppression  of  HBV  DNA  replication. 
The  proportion  of  patients  with  HBV  DNA  suppression  at  one  year  was  statistically  significant  in 
favour  to  lamivudine  as  compared  to  placebo.  However  in  terms  of  HBeAg  seroconversion,  the 
difference was not statistically significant after one year. 
Study NUCB 3009 
Originally  this  Asian  study  was  planned  to  have  a  24  weeks  follow  up  after  52  weeks  on  active 
treatment.  This  protocol  has  been  amended  and  patients  were  transferred  after  52  weeks  to  study 
NUCB3018 without interruption for further treatment with lamivudine. The latter study is ongoing and 
preliminary results are discussed later. Patients were allocated according to their liver histology to two 
strata:  stratum  1  comprised  patients  with  a  median  Knodell  HAI  score  of  10.0  (moderate  to  severe 
hepatitis) and 16 patients had evidence of liver cirrhosis. Patients of stratum 2 had a median score of 
4.0 (mild hepatitis). The patients in each group were well matched. The primary efficacy parameter for 
stratum 1 was any decrease in Knodell HAI score at 12 months and for stratum 2 any decrease in liver 
HBcAg  or  liver  HBV  DNA  at  12  months  compared  with  screening/baseline.  The  inclusion  criteria

Lamivudine  has  demonstrated  a  rapid  effective  suppression  of  HBV  DNA  replication.  This 
suppression  while  on  lamivudine  was  associated  with  significant  improvement  in  the  Knodell  HAI 
score (≥ 2 points reduction) and prevention of the hepatic fibrosis progression compared to placebo. 
The percentage of HBeAg seroconversion was statistically significant in favour of lamivudine. 
In patients treated with lamivudine 100 mg, results from the stratification according to the severity of 
the hepatitis showed that the response to Knodell HAI score was greater in patients with more severe 
liver  damage  at  baseline.  The  percentage  of  HBeAg  seroconversion  at  week  52  was  22  %  in  the 
stratum 1 compared to 2 % in stratum 2 respectively. 
Patients  who  completed  study  NUCB  3009  who  were  on  treatment  and  who  attended  the  52  weeks 
assessment  were  enrolled  in  study  NUCB  3018.  Patients  received  either  lamivudine  (25  or  100  mg 
once daily) for 2 years, or for 1 year followed by placebo or 1-year placebo followed by lamivudine 
therapy. The proportion of patients with sustained HBV DNA responses is 57 % at the end of the first 
year of treatment and 52% at the end of the second year of treatment with lamivudine and with ALT 
responses  the  proportion  decreases  from  72  to  50  %.  The  proportion  of  patients  with  HBeAg 
seroconversion with HBV DNA loss is 16 % after one year and 23 % at the end of the second year of 
treatment.  In  a  subgroup  of  patients  (n  =  58)  who  are  followed  for  three  years,  preliminary  data 
showed that HBeAg seroconversion occurred at the rate of 22 % at year-1, 29 % at year-2 and 40 % at 
year-3. 
Lamivudine in pre-core mutants 
Pre-core mutation accounts for 7-30 % of patients with chronic hepatitis B and is particularly common 
in  Mediterranean  and  Middle  East  populations  (40-80  %).  This  mutation  at  nucleotide  1896  in  the  
pre-core  region  of  the  HBV  DNA  genome  results  in  the  generation  of  a  stop  codon  that  blocks  the 
HBeAg  synthesis  but  still  permits  HBV  replication  and  HBcAg  production.  This  mutation  does  not 
affect  the  binding  pocket  of  the  viral  polymerase,  which  is  the  site  of  action  of  lamivudine.  This  is 
further addressed in the clinical efficacy section of this report. 
Study NUCB 3014 
The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  loss  of  serum  HBV  DNA  combined  with  normalisation  of 
ALT  at  week  52  (complete  response).  Secondary  endpoints  were  comparison  of  pre-  and  post- 
treatment  liver  histology  and  HBsAg  seroconversion  between  treatment  groups.  Patients  were 
characterised by the following inclusion criteria:

The  efficacy analysis in study NUCB3014 was  not  considered acceptable.  After 26 weeks,  the  code 
was  broken  and  only  the  responders  were  treated  for  another  16  weeks.  Thus  at  week  52,  patients 
included  in  the  placebo  group,  because  they  had  no  available  data  at  that  time,  were  considered  as 
failure.  
To support the use of lamivudine in this population, the applicant provided new data from the ongoing 
long-term treatment study NUCB3017 that includes 77 HBeAg negative/HBV DNA positive patients 
(who  were  previously  enrolled  in  NUCB  3014).  These  preliminary  data  show  that  lamivudine 
decreases  HBV  DNA  and  ALT  levels.  This  is  supported  by  data  from  the  compassionate  use 
programme (n = 255). 
Lamivudine versus interferon 
Study NUCB 3010 
In this study, the efficacy of lamivudine monotherapy is compared to the efficacy of alpha-interferon 
monotherapy  and  the  combination  of  lamivudine  and  alpha  interferon.  The  primary  endpoint  was 
HBeAg  seroconversion  (HBeAg  loss  with  HBeAb  gain)  with  concomitant  clearance  of  serum  HBV 
DNA.  Serum  ALT  normalisation,  HBV  DNA  suppression  and  liver  histology  were  evaluated  as 
secondary endpoints. The inclusion criteria are the following:

HBeAg  seroconversion  was  evaluated  at  week  52.  This  time  point  corresponded  to  the  end  of 
treatment  for  lamivudine  whereas  it  corresponded  to  28  weeks  of  post-treatment  for  patients  who 
received  a  standard  course  of  interferon.  No  difference  has  been  observed  between  the  treatment 
groups.  
Another  study  (NUCAB  3011)  has  been  conducted  to  further  assess  the  efficacy  and  safety  of 
lamivudine monotherapy versus placebo versus lamivudine/interferon in combination in patients who 
had  previously  failed  to  respond  to  alpha-interferon  therapy.  In  this  controlled,  multicentre, 
randomised, partially-blinded study, patients received one of the three treatment regimens: lamivudine 
100  mg  once  daily  for  52  weeks,  with  either  16  week  placebo  follow-up  or  16  weeks  continued 
lamivudine treatment (randomised at week 52), placebo for 68 weeks or lamivudine 100 mg/day for 8 
weeks  followed  by  alpha-interferon  10  MU  t.i.d  in  combination  with  lamivudine  for  16  weeks. 
Patients of this group did not receive any follow-up treatment at the end of the 16 weeks combination 
therapy.  One-year  lamivudine  treatment  has  therefore  been  compared  to  2  months  lamivudine 
followed by 4 months combination.  A total of 238 have been included in ITTm, which consist of all 
patients  randomised  (119  in  the  lamivudine  group,  56  placebo  and  63  lamivudine/interferon 
respectively).  Most  of  the  patients  included  were  Caucasian/White  (194/238  [82%])  or  Asian  (19/ 
[8%]). 
Although lamivudine and interferon have been shown in vitro to act synergistically on the virus, the 
rational  for  a  sequential  treatment  strategy  was  to  produce  a  reduction  in  viral  load  by  pre-treating 
with lamivudine before initiating combination treatment.

On the basis of the results from this study and from  study NUCB 3010 previously described, it was 
concluded  that  for  the  time  being,  it  was  not  possible  to  make  a  clear  clinical  comparison  between 
lamivudine, alpha-interferon and their combination.  
No  data  are  currently  available  concerning  the  susceptibility  to  interferon  therapy  in  those  patients 
who are failures or relapses to lamivudine therapy.  
Lamivudine in patients with YMDD mutations 
Worldwide,  the  incidence  of  YMDD  mutants  is  23  %  after  1-year  treatment.  In  the  Asian  studies 
(NUCB3009/3018) this incidence was 16 % after 1-year treatment, 42 % after 2-year or 53 % after 3-
year  lamivudine  treatment.  Although  this  mutant  is  less  replication  competent  and  seems  to  be  less 
pathogenic than the wild type the clinical evolution of the patients infected remains unknown. 
The integrated summary of efficacy results associated with YMDD mutant HBV 52-week lamivudine 
therapy in naive and Asiatic patients (NUCB3009, NUCA3010, NUCB3010) are presented below: 
Results with lamivudine 25 mg and 100 mg have been pooled.

These  results  showed  that  there  are  fewer  patients  with  HBV  DNA  suppression,  HBeAg 
seroconversion  and  sustained  ALT  normalisation  in  YMDD  mutant  population  after  one  year 
treatment as compared to non-mutant population. Limited data on the histological outcome of patients 
with  YMDD  variants  for  up  to  3  years  does  not  show  significant  worsening  of  histology.To  assess 
HBeAg  seroconversion  in  patients  with  YMDD  variants  additional  data  from  a  subgroup  of  Asian 
patients  receiving  both  25  and  100  mg  were  provided.  These  data  showed  that  sustained  HBeAg 
seroconversion occurring during treatment seemed to be similar in the group of patients with YMDD 
variants (10 /40 = 25 % at 3 years) and in the non-mutant group (11/50 = 22 %) taking into account 
that in the whole Asian population the percentage of HBeAg seronversion was 23 % (21/90) at year 2. 
The durability of the response after termination of therapy has not yet been assessed. 
There are limited  data on the re-treatment  of patients following cessation lamivudine therapy due to 
the emergence of variants. The majority of the patients who developed variants continued to receive 
lamivudine therapy. In case of treatment cessation, 53 % revert to the wild type within 4 months after 
treatment stop (no data available beyond 4 months). Data were provided on 6 patients retreated with 
lamivudine,  5  of  whom  developed  YMDD  variants  again  after  2  to  9  months,  and  1  had  yet  to 
demonstrate return of YMDD variant 1 year after restarting treatment.

Treatment stop 
There are limited data regarding the maintenance of seroconversion after treatment stop with Zeffix. 
Additional  results  from  the  ongoing  study  NUCAB3016,  which  has  a  follow-up  period  of  5  years, 
have  been  submitted.  This  study  enrols  patients  from  studies  A2008-B2015-A3010-B3010-AB3011 
who have HBeAg seroconverted and are followed off treatment. Out of the 29 patients who have been 
followed at for at least one year post HBeAg seroconversion, 26  maintained HBeAg seroconversion 
for this period of time.

These  data  indicate  a  similar  response  between  Asian  and  Caucasian  patients.  When  comparing  the 
Asian patients from the integrated studies to those from NUCB3009, higher sustained ALT response 
and lower incidence of YMDD variants were noted which the different ALT and HBV DNA levels at 
baseline explained. 
Liver transplant patients 
In two open-label 1-year studies (NUCB 2008 and NUCA 3005), the efficacy of lamivudine has been 
evaluated  in  liver  transplant  patients.  Lamivudine  showed  a  substantial  inhibitory  effect  on  serum 
HBV  DNA  level.  The  percentage  of  patients  with  undetectable  HBV  DNA  level  at  6  months  post 
transplant  (n  =  68)  is  62-100  %  and  51-75  %  of  these  patients  are  still  HBV  DNA  after  1  year 
treatment.  A  study  is  ongoing  to  assess  the  improvement  of  life  with  lamivudine  in  patients  having 
end-stage  liver  disease  secondary  to  hepatitis  B  who  are  waiting  or  undergone  orthotopic  liver 
transplant (OLT). 
Children 
The  clinical  efficacy  of  lamivudine  for  the  treatment  of  hepatitis  B  has  not  yet  been  evaluated  in 
children. 
Supportive studies  
Results  from  other  studies,  some  of  them  above-mentioned  were  submitted  to  support  the  clinical 
efficacy of lamivudine.

Clinical safety  
Patient exposure 
The  different  phase  II,  III  studies  and  I  where  5088  were  enrolled,  contributed  to  the  overall  safety 
assessment,  but  the  primary  data  for  analysis  was  provided  from  the  integrated  phase  III  studies 
(NUCB  3009,  NUCB  3010  and  NUCA  3010).  Of  the  583  patients  included  in  the  analysis,  144 
received  placebo,  142  lamivudine  25  mg  once  daily  and  297  lamivudine  100  mg  once  daily 
respectively for a median extent of exposure of one year. Of all patients, 91 % completed the studies 
with only 2 % withdrawal due to adverse events.  
Adverse events and serious adverse events/deaths 
In general, lamivudine appeared to be well tolerated and no severe adverse events were reported which 
could definitely be assigned to the lamivudine treatment. The incidence of adverse events and serious 
adverse  events  was  similar  in  patients  receiving  placebo  or  lamivudine,  except  for  a  slightly  higher 
frequency of abnormal liver function tests in those receiving lamivudine. 
The  most  commonly  adverse  events  reported  were  malaise  and  fatigue  (22  %),  headache  (20  %), 
respiratory infections (20 %), abdominal discomfort/abdominal pain (16 %) and diarrhoea (14 %).  
Laboratory findings 
An analysis of laboratory data from the integrated Phase III studies demonstrated that during treatment 
ALT elevations occurred in 12 % of both lamivudine and placebo groups. In 32 % cases this elevation 
occurred  in  the  first  8  weeks  of  treatment  but  no  explanation  for  this  increase  was  provided.  The 
incidence of post-treatment ALT elevation (more than 3 times baseline) was higher in patients treated 
with lamivudine (20 %) in comparison to those receiving placebo (8 %). Out of the 1125 compensated 
hepatitis  B  patients  included  in  the  lamivudine  programme,  10  reported  transient  and  self-limiting 
elevation  of  ALT  and  bilirubin  (7  post-treatment  and  3  during  the  treatment):  among  them,  2  were 
asymptomatic,  1  was  potentially  associated  with  seroconversion  and  2  were  associated  with  YMDD 
mutant  HBV.  Moreover,  2  patients  died  because  of  their  clinical  deterioration  post-treatment 
following the re-emergence of the hepatitis. 
Data on post-treatment ALT elevations in patients with YMDD variant HBV and compensated liver 
disease (Integrated studies A3010-B3010-AB3011) showed that out of this cohort, only 2 % of each 
placebo, wild-type and variant patients experienced a post-treatment elevation of ALT and bilirubin.

Haematological  and  other  clinical  chemistry  profiles  were  similar  between  placebo  and  lamivudine. 
The  difference  in  patients  who  experienced  elevation  of  CPK  was  not  considered  statistically 
significant between the treatment (8 %) and the placebo groups (5 %). 
Data from the active-controlled studies showed that the addition of lamivudine to alpha-interferon did 
not appear to alter the safety profile of alpha-interferon. The addition of alpha-interferon to lamivudine 
seemed  to  result  in  a  safety  profile  in  which  the  nature  and  frequency  of  adverse  events  in  the 
combination were similar to that of alpha-interferon alone.  
The  most  common  adverse  events  occurring  in  the  integrated  HBV  and  HIV  studies  (treated  with 
lamivudine 150 mg) have been presented. As already indicated the nature and incidence of events with 
lamivudine was similar to placebo.  So far, lamivudine is therefore well tolerated in HBV patients and 
severe  adverse  events  of  lamivudine  and  other  nucleoside  analogues  reported  in  HIV  patients 
(pancreatitis,  myopathy,  haemothologic  effects  or  neuropathy)  are  not  raised  with  the  current  safety 
data.  All these effects need to be, however, closely monitored.

Interim analysis of study NUCA 2006 involving 77 HBV infected patients eligible for OLT, provided 
data to support the safety of treatment of OLT patients and those with impaired liver function.  The 
safety profile of lamivudine is consistent with the severity of the underlying disease.

Overall conclusions and benefit/risk assessment 
Quality 
The quality of Zeffix 100 mg film-coated tablets and 5 mg/ml oral solution is considered acceptable 
when  used  in  accordance  with  the  conditions  defined  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics. 
Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical  performance  of  the  product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
Preclinical pharmacology and toxicology 
• 
• 
• 
Overall  the  primary  pharmacodynamics  studies  provide  adequate  evidence  that  lamivudine  is 
active  against  HBV  virus.  The  general  pharmacology  studies  have  not  revealed  any  clinically 
significant effects of lamivudine.  
From the pharmacokinetic point of view, it was noted that renal clearance is the main excretion 
route for lamivudine.  
Overall  the  toxicology  programme  identifies  the  haematopoietic,  hepatic  and  renal  systems  as 
the  most  commonly  affected  target  organs,  but  no  histological  signs  in  the  liver  have  been 
observed.  Lamivudine  shows  a  potential  to  induce  embryotoxicity  after  administration  to 
pregnant  animals,  is  genotoxic  in  certain  tests,  but  is  not  carcinogenic.  This  information  has 
been adequately included into the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Clinical efficacy  
• 
• 
• 
• 
Zeffix may be a convenient once daily oral therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. 
The rational for the dosing recommendation in adults has been sufficiently substantiated. 
In  HBeAg  positive  patients,  lamivudine  reduces  HBV  DNA  consistently,  improves  liver 
histology  and  is  well  tolerated.  Lamivudine  also  induces  HBeAg  seroconversion  in  11  %  of 
patients  after  1-year  treatment.  HBeAg  seroconversion  continues  to  occur  if  lamivudine 
treatment is continued for 3 years. For the time being it is not possible to make a clear clinical 
comparison between lamivudine, alpha-interferon and their combination.  
The long term benefit of lamivudine therapy in terms of reduction in cirrhosis or development 
of hepatocellular carcinoma is however unknown so long term data are necessary to answer the 
question on long-term. 
In  HBeAg  negative  patients,  who  are  mainly  encountered  in  Mediterranean  Europe,  with  a 
clinical  profile  characterised  by  oscillation  of  ALT  levels  with  rapid  progression  cirrhosis, 
limited  data  (n  =  65)  indicated  that  the  efficacy  of  lamivudine  may  be  similar  to  that  seen  in 
those infected wild type HBV based on HBV DNA and ALT levels. 
•  Worldwide,  the  incidence  of  YMDD  mutants  is  23  %  after  1-year  treatment.  In  Asian  study 
(NUCB 3018) this incidence was 16% after 1-year treatment, 42 % after 2-year and 53 % after 
3-year  lamivudine  treatment.  The  incidence  of  this  mutation  increases  in  liver  transplant 
patients, being 64% after one year of treatment. For patients treated with lamivudine for more 
than 24 weeks, the presence of a single ALT value > 1.3 times the upper limit of the reference 
range and simultaneously single serum HBV DNA value over 20 pg/ml (solution hybridisation 
assay)  was  associated  with  a  99  %  risk  of  harbouring  YMDD  variant  HBV.  Limited  data 
showed that HBeAg seroconversion occurs at a similar rate in mutant and non-mutants. Long-
term clinical and histological outcomes in these patients are presently unknown. 
• 
In patients with decompensated liver disease, although limited data were provided, a beneficial 
effect of lamivudine was observed. 
17/18 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
           
• 
There are not sufficient data to recommend the combination treatment of lamivudine and alpha-
interferon. The efficacy of lamivudine appears to be equivalent between alpha-interferon naive 
and non-responder patients.  
•  With respect to the treatment duration the CPMP drew the following conclusions: 
• 
In  HBeAg  positive  patients  treatment  should  be  administered  until  HBeAg  seroconversion 
(HBeAg  and  HBV  DNA  loss  with  HBeAb  detection)  on  two  consecutive  serum  samples  or 
HBsAg  seroconversion.  Treatment  discontinuation  may  be  considered  in  HBeAg  positive 
patients,  in  case  of  loss  of  efficacy,  indicated  by  a  persistent  return  of  serum  ALT  and  HBV 
DNA to pretreatment values, deterioration in liver histology or other signs of hepatitis.  
• 
• 
• 
In  HBeAg  negative  (precore  mutant)  patients,  the  optimal  duration  of  treatment  is  unknown. 
Treatment  discontinuation  may  be  considered  following  HBsAg  seroconversion,  or  in  case  of 
loss of efficacy as described above.  
In  patients  who  develop  YMDD  variant  HBV  treatment  discontinuation  should  be  considered 
following HBeAg seroconversion or if there is evidence of loss of efficacy as described above. 
In patients with decompensated liver disease, treatment cessation is not recommended. 
These conclusions have been reflected in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Clinical safety 
•  Safety data indicated that lamivudine is well tolerated. Adverse events seem to be minor and no 
severe adverse events have been reported which could be assigned to the lamivudine treatment.  
Benefit/risk assessment 
In  chronic  HBV  infection,  lamivudine  reduces  viral  replication,  improves  liver  histology,  increased 
sustained  HBeAg  seroconversion  and  is  well  tolerated.  The  major  points  for  discussion  pertained  to 
define  the  population  for  which  lamivudine  should  be  indicated,  the  duration  of  treatment  with 
lamivudine  with  respect  to  the  different  group  of  patients  and  the  emergence  of  YMDD  resistance. 
The CPMP agreed to convene the Ad-Hoc group of Experts on hepatitis B to discuss these points in 
the context of the whole evaluation of the application. The applicant addressed these issues during an 
oral presentation in front of the expert group of Experts and later in front of the CPMP.  
Considering the scarcity of the data on the YMDD mutation, pre-core mutant population and on the 
duration  of  treatment  in  this  population,  the  CPMP  considered  that  the  data  on  efficacy  and  safety 
were not comprehensive. Therefore the CPMP recommended the granting of a marketing authorisation 
under exceptional circumstances and complementary data on these issues would therefore have to be 
submitted as part of specific obligations to be fulfilled post opinion. 
The  CPMP  recommended  initially  that  Zeffix  should  be  restricted  to  prescribers  specialised  in  the 
hepatitis field as indicated in section 4.2 of the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Based on the CPMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy the CPMP considered by consensus 
that  the  benefit/risk  profile  of  Zeffix  100  mg  film-coated  tablets  and  5  mg/ml  oral  suspension  was 
favourable in the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis B and evidence of viral replication 
with decompensated liver disease or with histologically documented active liver inflammation and/or 
fibrosis. 
This  indication  is  based  on  the  analysis  of  serological  and  histological  end  points  that  were  mainly 
derived from studies of one-year duration in HBeAg positive patients with compensated liver disease.

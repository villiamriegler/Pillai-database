Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for apremilast, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis are associated with impairments in health-related quality of life even in 
mild cases. These events may lead to potential adverse effects on mental health such a depression and 
suicidal ideation and behaviour. Therefore, suicidal related events and depression are more common in 
patients with psoriasis and psoriasis arthritis than in the general population. 
However, based on a cumulative review on “depression” and “suicidal ideation and behaviour”, there is 
evidence  to  suggest  a  casual  association  between  depression  and  suicidal  ideation  and  behaviour  with 
the use of apremilast.  
In terms of depression, 220 initial cases post-marketing, 42 of them were considered serious were 
reported during the PSUR reporting period. Among these 42 serious cases: 25 required permanent 
discontinuation, 5 also experienced suicidal ideation, 1 case had positive dechallenge and rechallenge. 
In the clinical trials, 11 Depression SAEs were reported in apremilast group versus 0 in the placebo 
group.  
In relation to suicidal ideation and behaviour, 19 initial cases post-marketing were reported: 2 
completed suicide, 13 suicidal ideation, 3 depression suicide and 1 suicidal behaviour. Apremilast was 
permanently discontinued in 16 of the 19 cases. In the cumulative review, 32 cases out of 65 reported 
positive dechallenge. 
Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR, the PRAC considered that changes to the 
product information of medicinal products containing apremilast were warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for apremilast the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product containing apremilast is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation should be varied.

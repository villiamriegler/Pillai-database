1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Requested group of variations 
Pursuant to Article 7.2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Biogen Idec Ltd submitted to the 
European Medicines Agency on 25 November 2016 an application for a group of variations.  
The following changes were proposed:

This is a grouped variation proposing updates to the SmPC sections 4.2, 5.1, Annex II and Package 
Leaflet based on the clinical study ENHANCE; to the SmPC section 4.6 based on the data from the 
FOLLOW pregnancy registry. Further changes to the PI, section 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
introduced based on the Core Data Sheet (CDS) and PRAC review of the Fampyra PSUR 03. The RMP 
(version 11) has been updated accordingly. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took 
the opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template version 10.0. Finally, with this 
application the MAH requests to switch the conditional marketing authorisation to a marketing 
authorisation not subject to specific obligations. 
The requested group of variations proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, 
Annex II, Labelling and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
1.2.  Rationale for the proposed changes 
Fampyra is a prolonged release (PR) tablet formulation containing fampridine or 4-aminopyridine (4-AP). 
Fampridine  is  indicated  for  the  improvement  of  walking  in  adult  patients  with  multiple  sclerosis  with 
walking disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale 4-7).  
Fampyra  received  a  conditional  marketing  authorisation  in  2011  subject  to  the  provision  of  results  of  a 
long-term efficacy and safety study to investigate a broader primary endpoint that is clinically meaningful 
in terms of walking ability and to further evaluate the early identification of responders. 
In  this  group  of  variations  the  MAH  submitted  final  data  from  the  outstanding  specific  obligation  study 
ENHANCE  (218MS305),  a multicenter,  randomised, double  blind,  placebo  controlled parallel group  study 
to  assess  the  long-term  efficacy  and  safety  of  prolonged  release  Fampridine  10  mg,  administered  twice 
daily in subjects with multiple sclerosis. 
Changes  to  the  Product  Information  and  the  RMP  are  proposed  consequently.  As  submission  of  the 
ENHANCE  data  fulfils  the  specific  obligation,  the  MAH  requested  to  convert  the  marketing  authorisation 
from conditional to one no longer subject to specific obligations.  
Additionally, the MAH submitted results of the pregnancy registry FOLLOW (218MS402) and proposed PI

updates accordingly. Minor PI updates based on the recent PSUR assessment have also been proposed. 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
As part of CMA the Applicant conducted the ENHANCE study which now has been completed. The aim of 
the  study  was  to  evaluate  the  clinical  meaningfulness  of  the  effect  of  fampridine  in  terms  of  walking 
ability as well as the long-term efficacy and safety.  
The ENHANCE study is a randomised placebo-controlled parallel group study in 636 subjects with multiple 
sclerosis  and  walking  disability.  Subjects  were  randomised  to  placebo or  fampridine  PR  10  mg  BID.  The 
duration  of  the  double-blind  part  was  24  weeks  with  a  2  week  post–treatment  follow-up.  Primary 
endpoint was the proportion of responders defined as subjects with a mean improvement on the Multiple 
Sclerosis Walking Scale of ≥ 8 points as compared to baseline. An improvement of 8 points on the MSWS-
12 has been accepted as a clinical meaningful change in earlier assessment of the study protocol of the 
ENHANCE study.  
The ENHANCE study met its primary endpoint. The responder rate was 33.6% for placebo and 43.2% for 
fampridine PR 10 mg BID (Risk difference 10.4%, CI95% 3%; 17.8%, p=0.006). The  LS mean change in 
MSWS  score  was  –6.73  point  and–2.59  points  in  subjects  treated  with  fampridine  PR  and  placebo 
respectively  (Difference  –4.14,  CI95%  –6.22,  –2.06;  p  <  0.001).  The  effect  of  fampridine  treatment  was 
evident as early as week 2 and was sustained throughout the 24-week treatment period. Discontinuation 
of  treatment  resulted  in  worsening  of  the  MSWS-12  score  in  the  fampridine-PR  group  but  not  in  the 
placebo group.  
Efficacy on the MSWS-12 was consistent with the findings with respect to the Time Up and GO responders 
score and the MSIS29-physical score. There were no statistical significant differences with respect to the 
Berg  Balance  Scale  (BBS;  a  measure  of  static  balance)  and  ABILHAND  (measure  of  subject’s  perceived 
difficulty in performing everyday manual activities). The proportion of subjects reporting an improvement 
on  the  Patient  Global  Impression  of  Change  (PGIC)  at  Week  2  was  31%  vs  38%  for  placebo  and 
fampridine PR respectively. This was 22% and 28% at week 24. Findings for the EQ-5D-3L, SDMT, SF-36, 
and HRU showed relatively little change from baseline and minimal differences between the groups.  
The  results  of  the  ENHANCE  study  confirm  that  treatment  with  fampridine  results  in  a  clinically 
meaningful  improvement  in  walking  in  a  proportion  of  patients  with  multiple  sclerosis  with  walking 
disability  despite  the  fact  that  the  effect  size  may  be  considered  as  modest.  The  safety  profile  of 
fampridine observed in the ENHANCE is not different from what is already known for fampridine, and no 
new signals were raised.  
Summarising the aim of the ENHANCE study, i.e. to establish the clinical meaningfulness of fampridine in 
improving walking so as to establish the long term efficacy and safety, this is considered met. Overall the 
benefit/risk of fampridine remains positive and the granting of a MA not subject to specific obligations is 
considered justified.  
Furthermore,  the  CHMP  agreed  to  the  Product  Information  changes  reflecting  data  from  the  pregnancy 
registry. Conversely, the CHMP refused changes to the statement that fampridine should be taken without 
food as the Committee considered that more data substantiating this change were needed.  
Scientific Summary for the EPAR 
In this group of variations the MAH submitted data from the Enhance study (218MS305) conducted in 636 
subjects with multiple sclerosis and walking disability. Duration of double-blind treatment was 24 weeks 
with a 2 week post–treatment follow-up. The primary endpoint was improvement in walking ability, 
Assessment report

measured as the proportion of patients achieving a mean improvement of ≥ 8 points from baseline 
MSWS-12 score over 24 weeks.  In this study there was a statistically significant treatment difference, 
with a greater proportion of Fampyra treated patients demonstrating an improvement in walking ability, 
compared to placebo-controlled patients (relative risk of 1.38 (95% CI:  [1.06, 1.70]).  Improvements 
generally appeared within 2 to 4 weeks of initiation of treatment, and disappeared within 2 weeks of 
treatment cessation. Based on the results of the study it was agreed that specific obligation has been 
fulfilled, and therefore it is deleted from the Annex II. 
Furthermore, the MAH submitted results of the pregnancy registry FOLLOW which was terminated early 
due to lack of subject exposure to prolonged-release fampridine during pregnancy. The limited data 
available indicated no adverse effect of fampridine on the pregnancy outcomes.

Information update in line with the current CCDS regarding information of ‘no clinically meaningful 
consequences when fampridine is administered with food’,  
the CHMP has recommended the refusal of the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation. 
The following obligation has been fulfilled, and therefore it is recommended that it be deleted from the 
Annex II to the Opinion: 
Description 
Due date 
To provide results of a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, long-term efficacy and

safety study to investigate a broader primary endpoint clinically meaningful in terms 
of walking ability and to further evaluate the early identification of responders in 
order to guide further treatment based on a CHMP agreed protocol. An update of 
the progress in completing the obligation should be provided every 6 months. 
Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(3) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Fampyra (fampridine) is removed from the 
additional monitoring list as the specific obligation has been fulfilled and the medicinal product was 
authorised more than 5 years ago. 
Therefore the statement that this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will 
allow quick identification of new safety information, preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle, is 
removed from the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet.  
4.  Scientific discussion 
4.1.  Introduction 
Fampyra is a prolonged release (PR) tablet formulation containing fampridine or 4-aminopyridine (4-AP). 
Fampyra is also known as Ampyra (dalfampridine).  
Fampridine  is  indicated  for  the  improvement  of  walking  in  adult  patients  with  multiple  sclerosis  with 
walking disability.  
Fampridine  is  a  potassium  channel  blocker  effective  at  selective  types  of  voltage-gated  potassium 
channels.  Fampridine  facilitates  signal  transmission  in  demyelinated  axons,  improving  impaired 
neurological function induced by demyelination.  
Fampridine  has  been  granted  a  conditional  approval  as  the  product  demonstrated  benefits  in  terms  of 
improving walking speed together with an improvement on the multiple-sclerosis walking scale score. The 
conditional  marketing  authorization  application  for  fampridine  was  supported  by  1  Phase  2  study  (MS-
F202),  2  pivotal  Phase  3  studies  (MS-F203  and  MS-F204),  and  3  extension  studies  (MS-F202EXT,  MS-
F203EXT, and MS-F204EXT). 
However,  approximately  only  one  third  of  the  patients  may  benefit  from  treatment,  and  the  extent  of 
benefit  provided  by  fampridine  was  not  completely  explained  by  the  data  generated.    In  particular  the 
clinical  meaningfulness  of  walking  endpoints,  long  term  safety,  and  efficacy  needed  further  evaluation. 
Therefore, at the time of approval the CHMP was of the opinion that additional efficacy data was required, 
i.e. from a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, long-term efficacy and safety study in order to investigate 
a  broader  primary  endpoint,  which  is  clinically  meaningful  in  terms  of  walking  ability  and  to  further 
Assessment report  
EMA/305262/2017

evaluate the early identification of responders in order to guide further treatment. Hence, the marketing 
authorisation was granted subject to a following condition:  
“To  conduct  a  double-blinded,  placebo-controlled,  long-term  efficacy  and  safety  study  to  investigate  a 
broader primary endpoint clinically meaningful in terms of walking ability and to further evaluate the early 
identification of responders in order to guide further treatment based on a CHMP protocol. An update of 
the process in completing the obligation should be provided every 6 months. (SOB10.1).” 
To fulfil this obligation the Applicant has submitted a clinical development plan containing a two step plan 
with a phase 2 exploratory study (MOBILE) and a phase 3 confirmatory study (ENHANCE).  
Study  218MS205  (MOBILE)  in  132  subjects  was  performed  to  explore  the  impact  of  prolonged    release 
fampridine on overall walking disability and to further elucidate the clinical relevance of changes over the 
24 week treatment duration. Using the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) and other anchor and 
distribution-based  analyses,  the  minimum  clinically  important  difference  (MCID)  on  the  12-item  Multiple 
Sclerosis  Walking  Scale  (MSWS-12)  was  estimated  at  8  points  and  the  MCID  for  improvement of  Timed 
Up and Go (TUG) speed was estimated to be a ≥15% mean increase in speed over a 24-week treatment 
period.  
The ENHANCE study (study 218MS305) now has been completed and is submitted.  Based on the results 
from the ENHANCE study the Applicant concludes that the specific obligations of the conditional marketing 
authorization have been fulfilled and requests for a full marketing authorization.  
4.2.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
Enhance study  (study 218MS305)  
4.2.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
The Enhance study concerned a randomised, multicentre (n=92) double blind, placebo controlled parallel 
group study  to evaluate the long tem efficacy and  safety of fampridine PR 10 mg  BID in 646 subjects 
with multiple sclerosis.  
The study was performed in in Bulgaria (13 sites), Czech Republic (9 sites), Finland (4 sites), Great 
Britain (13 sites), Italy (5 sites), Lithuania (3 sites), Netherlands (3 sites), Poland (16 sites), Russia (6 
sites), Serbia (3 sites), and US (17 sites).  
The primary objective was   to determine whether prolonged-release fampridine 10 mg twice daily has a 
clinically meaningful effect on patient-reported walking ability over a 24-week treatment period. 
Main  inclusion  criteria  were  a  documented  diagnosis  of  MS  (RRMS,  PRMS  SPMS,  PPMS  )  of  at  least  3 
months duration,  an EDSS score of 4 and ≤7  and the presence of a walking impairment as deemed by 
the  investigator.  Main  exclusion  criteria  were the  presence  of  history  of  seizures,  MS  exacerbation  <  60 
days  prior  screening,  concurrent  medications  and/or  conditions  that  interferes  with  walking  capacity, 
initiation of disease modifying treatments,  renal dysfunction and hepatitis.  
After  a  2  week  screening  period,  subjects  were  randomised  to  fampridine  PR  10  mg  BID  or  matching 
placebo.  Randomisation  ratio  was  1:1  and  randomisation  was  stratified  by  baseline  EDSS  score  (≤6  or 
>6)  and  after  an  protocol  amendment  by  prior  amino-pyridine  use.  Duration  of  double-blind  was  24 
weeks. This was followed by a 14 day post-dosing follow-up. 
The following efficacy assessments were performed: 
MSWS-12:    The  Multiple  Sclerosis  Walking  Scale  is  a  12-item  questionnaire  that  asks  subjects  to  rate 
Assessment report  
EMA/305262/2017 
Page 8/64 
 
  
  
 
limitations of their mobility due to MS during the preceding 2 weeks on a 5-point Likert scale from not at 
all  (1)  to  extremely  (5).  Subjects  were  asked  if  they  cannot  walk  at  all  at  the  beginning  of  the 
questionnaire,  and  if  the  subject  indicated  this  was  the  case,  then  they  did  not  respond  to  the  12 
questions. The transformed scale ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores showing a greater degree of 
limitation in walking due to MS. 
TUG:  The  Timed  up  en  Go  test  is  a  mobility  assessment  in  which  subjects  must  stand  from  a  seated 
position  in  a  chair,  walk  3  meters,  and  turn  and  return  to  seated.  The  time  to  complete  the  task  is 
recorded. 
MSIS-29 physical score: The Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale is a subject completed questionnaire that 
comprises  29  questions  to  measure  the  physical  (questions  1  to  20)  and  psychological  (questions  21  to 
29)  impact  of  MS.  The  physical  score  is  calculated  by  summing  across  the  20  relevant    items  and 
transformed to a scale from 1 (no impact of MS) to 100 (extreme impact of MS). 
BBS:  The  Berg  Balance  Scale  is  a  clinical  test  of  a  subject’s  static  and  dynamic  balance  ability,  and 
includes  14  balance-related  tasks,  each  scored  from  unable  to  perform  (0)  to  able  to  perform 
independently (4). The total score ranges from 0 (poor balance) to 56 (good balance). 
ABILHAND:  The  ABILHAND  is  a  subject-completed  questionnaire  that  measures  a  subject’s  perceived 
difficulty in performing everyday manual activities during the preceding 3 months. Subjects rate a list of 
56  activities  as  impossible  (0),  difficult  (1),  or  easy  (2).  The  transformed  scale  ranges  from  0  to  100, 
where higher scores indicate greater manual ability. 
PGIC:  The  Patient  Global  Impression  of  Change  elicits  a  subject’s  rating  of  change  in  overall  walking 
compared with the prior study visit using a 7-point Likert scale including very much worse (1), unchanged 
(4), and very much improved (7). 
EQ-5D-3L:  The  EuroQol  health-related  quality  of  life  questionnaire  is  an  assessment  of  5  aspects  of 
health-related  quality  of 
life 
(mobility, 
self-care,  usual  activities,  pain/discomfort,  and 
anxiety/depression), each on a 3-point scale ranging from no problems (1) to extreme problems (3). The 
assessment  also  includes  a  visual  analog  scale  (VAS)  ranging  from  worst  imagined  health  state  (0)  to 
best imagined health state (100); positive change indicates improvement. 
SDMT: The Symbol Digit Modalities Test is a substitution test that assesses changes in cognitive function 
over time. Subjects have 90 seconds to pair numbers with geometric figures, and the score is the number 
of correct responses during that time. Positive change indicates improvement. 
SF-36:  The  Short  Form  Health  Survey    is  a  health  survey  with  36  questions  split  across  several 
categories  (Physical  Functioning,  Role-Physical,  Bodily  Pain,  General  Health,  Vitality,  Social  Functioning, 
Role-Emotional,  Mental  Health,  and  Reported  Health  Transition)  that  are  used  to  construct  a  physical 
component summary (PCS) and a mental component summary (MCS). 
HRU:  The  Health  Resources  Utilization    questionnaire  collects  information  on  how  MS  affects  subjects’ 
lives  and  how  they  use  health  care  services.  The  questions  are  grouped  into  sections  for  Work  Status 
(whether  a  subject  is  employed  and  whether  lack  of  employment  is  due  to  walking  problems)  and 
Absenteeism (days missed due to walking problems), Health Care Services (types of health care providers 
visited due to MS), and Caregiver Services (use and frequency of visits to the subject by caregivers). 
The  primary  endpoint  was  the  proportion  of  subjects  who  achieved  a  mean  improvement  on  the 
MSWS-12 of ≥8 points from baseline over the 24-week treatment period. If a subject’s mean MSWS-12 
was  <8  points  at  baseline,  the  subject  was  counted  as  having  a  ≥8-point  mean  improvement  from 
baseline if their mean MSWS-12 score during the treatment period was <0.5.

Secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were  the    Timed  Up  and  Go  (TUG),  29-Item  Multiple  Sclerosis  Impact 
Scale (MSIS-29), the  Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and the ABILHAND.  
Exploratory  endpoints  concerned  the  Patient  Global  Impression  of  Change  (PGIC),  the  EuroQol-5 
Dimensions-3 Levels (EQ-5D-3L) visual analog scale (VAS) and utility score, the Symbol Digit Modalities 
Test  (SDMT)  and  the  36-Item  Short  Form  Health  Survey  (SF-36),  with  physical  component  subscale 
(PCS) and mental component subscale (MCS) and  Health resource utilization (HRU). 
Safety  variables  concerned  the  occurrence  of  adverse  events,  physical  examination,  vital  signs, 
electrocardiogram,  and    clinical  laboratory  assessments  (including  urine  culture  for  suspected  urinary 
tract infection). 
Sample  Size  Calculations:  a  sample  size  of  approximately  590  subjects  (295  subjects  in  each 
treatment  group)  was  expected  to  provide  at  least  90%  power  at  a  2-sided  5%  significance  level  to 
detect  a  minimum  of  14.5%  absolute  improvement  in  the  on-treatment  response  rate  (i.e.  ≥  8-point 
mean  improvement on  MSWS-12  over 24  weeks)  for  the prolonged-release  fampridine  group  relative  to 
the placebo group, assuming a response rates of 50% under the null hypothesis and a 15% dropout rate.  
Analysis  population:    The  main  population  for  efficacy  analyses  was  the  ITT  population  defined  as  all 
subjects who were randomized and received at least 1 dose of study treatment and had at least 1 post-
baseline  efficacy  assessment,  excluding  subjects  from  one  site  due  to  GCP  noncompliance.  The  safety 
population  consisted  of  all  subjects  who  were  randomized  and  received  at  least  1  dose  of  study 
treatment, excluding subjects from one site. 
Methods of analyses  
Primary efficacy analysis  
The  primary  efficacy  analysis  was  performed  in  the  ITT  population  with  missing  data  handled  using  the 
multiple  imputation  method.  Comparisons  between  the  prolonged-release  fampridine  and  placebo 
treatment  groups  were  made  using  a  logistic  regression  model  adjusted  for  treatment  group,  baseline 
MSWS-12 score, baseline TUG speed, age, prior AP use, and screening EDSS score. 
Sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint concerned analysis of the PP population, analysis of observed 
data, analysis including the one site analysis exclusion subjects with prior use of amino-pyridine, among 
others. 
Secondary efficacy analysis 
TUG: The proportion of subjects who achieved a mean improvement in TUG speed of ≥15% from baseline 
over  a    24-week  period  was  compared  between  treatment  groups  using  a  logistic  regression  model 
adjusted for treatment group,  baseline TUG speed, prior aminopyridine use, and screening EDSS score. 
Baseline was defined as the mean speed over the Screening and Day 1 Visits.  
MSIS-29  physical  score,  BBS,  and  ABILHAND:  The  mean  changes  from  baseline  over  24  weeks  in  the 
MSIS-29 physical score, BBS, and ABILHAND scores were compared using a mixed effects model adjusted 
for  treatment  group,  corresponding  baseline  score,  screening  EDSS  score,  prior  AP  use,  and  visit-by-
treatment interaction.  
Multiplicity  
Hypothesis testing was performed at the 2-sided 5% significance level overall, with adjustment for testing 
multiple  secondary  endpoints  using  a  combination  of  the  sequential  stepdown  procedure  and  the 
Hochberg procedure to control the overall Type I error rate. 1. The 4 secondary endpoints were divided 
into the following 2 groups i.e. Group 1: TUG responders, change from baseline in the MSIS-29, physical

score,  Group  2:  change  in  BBS,  change  in  ABILHAND.  If  the  each  endpoint  in  group  1  was  were 
statistically significant at the 5% significance level, then each of the endpoints in Group 2 were tested at 
the 5% significance level.  If one of the endpoints in Group 1 had a p-value greater than 0.05, then the 
other endpoint in Group 1 was tested at the 2.5% significance level, and then the Group 2 endpoints were 
each  tested  at  the  2.5%  significance  level.  If  neither  of  the  endpoints  in  Group  1  were  statistically 
significant  based  on  either  of  the  2  criteria  above,  the  endpoints  in  Group  2  were  not  considered 
statistically significant. 
Secondary en exploratory efficacy analysis 
Least squares (LS) means, LS mean differences, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were presented for 
the  EQ-5D-3L  VAS  and  utility  score  and  SDMT  using  a  mixed  model  for  repeated  measures  with 
randomized  treatment  group,  visit,  baseline  score,  EDSS  score  at  screening,  treatment  group-by-visit 
interaction, and prior AP use included in the model. Analyses of SF-36 were performed using an analysis 
of covariance with adjustment for treatment group, baseline score (PCS or MCS), screening EDSS score, 
and prior AP use, and LS means, LS mean differences, and 95% CIs were presented. The proportions of 
subjects with an improvement on the PGIC and changes in HRU over time were also summarized. 
Evaluation of Early Assessment of Response 
Analyses were also performed to assess the predictive values of different measures of early response. 
Study  data  were  also  used  for  evaluating  the  early  identification  of  responders.    The  following  analyses 
were  performed  using  MSWS-12  and  TUG  speed  data  to  assess  whether  subjects  who  showed  benefit 
after 2 or 4 weeks of treatment were the same subjects who were responders on the MSWS-12 over 24 
weeks:  Positive  predictive  value  (PPV),  Negative  predictive  value  (NPV):  Sensitivity  and  Specificity. 
Different definitions of early response at each of 2 and 4 weeks were used to predict the overall response 
on MSWS-12.  
Subgroup analysis  
Analyses  of  MSWS-12  response,  TUG  speed,  MSIS-29  physical  component  scores,  BBS  scores,  and 
ABILHAND  were  performed  for  the  following  subgroups:  EDSS  score  (≤6,  >6),  MS  disease  phenotype 
(RRMS, SPMS, PPMS, PRMS), MSWS-12 baseline score (≤ median, > median). Analyses of MSWS-12 and 
TUG speed were also performed for Age group (≤45 years, >45 years), Sex (male, female), BMI (<18.5 
kg/m2, 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2, 25 to 29.9 kg/m2, ≥30 kg/m2) and concomitant immunomodulator use (yes, 
no).  
4.2.2.  Results 
Patient disposition, baseline feature  
In  table  4.2.2.1a  and  table  4.2.2.1b  the  number  of  subjects,  demographics  and  baseline  features  are 
presented.    A  total  of  636  subjects  were  randomised  at  92  sites  worldwide.  Data  from  one  site  were 
excluded  due  to serious  Good  Clinical  Practice  (GCP)  noncompliance.  The  decision  to  close  this  site  was 
based primarily on the lack of appropriate source documents to support the accuracy completeness, and 
reliability  of  the  data  entered  in  the  case  report  form.  Ten  subjects  were  randomized  at  the  site. 
Sensitivity  analyses  that  include  data  from  this  site  showed  no  appreciable  difference  in  the  overall 
outcomes of efficacy evaluations relative to analyses that exclude these data.  
Treatment was discontinued in 15% of the subjects treated with fampridine-and in 19% of in the placebo 
group.  The  most  common  reason  for  discontinuation  in  both  groups  was  adverse  events  (7%  in  both 
treatment groups). Subject’s  perception of lack of efficacy was reason to discontinue in 2 subjects (<1%) 
treated with fampridine-PR and in 10 subjects (3%) treated with placebo.

Demographics, baseline disease characteristics, are presented in table 4.2.2.1b.  Demographics features, 
baseline disease characteristics, and medical history of  were comparable for both study arms. 
The proportions of subjects with each MS type, duration of disease were similar in the fampridine-PR and 
placebo groups.   
The treatment groups were balanced with respect to EDSS score, MSWS-12 score, TUG speed, MSIS-29 
physical  score,  BBS  score  and  ABILHAND  score.    Concomitant  medication  use  was  similar  in  treatment 
groups  and  prior  aminopyridine  use  was  also  balanced.  Most  frequent  immunomodulators  used  were 
glatiramer,  (8%/9%  for  placebo  and  fampridine  respectively),  fingolimod  (7%/7%),  interferon  beta-1a

Efficacy  
Primary endpoints, primary efficacy analysis  
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects who achieved a mean improvement on the 
MSWS-12  of  ≥8  points  from  baseline  over  a  24-week  treatment  period.  A  higher  proportion  of  subjects 
treated with prolonged-release fampridine demonstrated a ≥8-point mean improvement on the MSWS-12 
over 24 weeks compared with subjects treated with placebo. The primary efficacy analysis using a logistic 
regression  model  showed  that  the  treatment  difference  was  statistically  significant;  the  odds  ratio  was 
1.61  (95%CI:  [1.15,  2.26];  p  =  0.006  in  favour  of  prolonged-release  fampridine.  These  findings  are 
supported by the relative risk of 1.38 (95% CI: [1.06, 1.70]) and the risk difference of 0.104 (95% CI: 
[0.030, 0.178]. See table 2a.

AA  responder  is  defined  as  a  subject  with  a  mean  improvement  of  at  least  8  points  over  24  weeks  compared  to 
baseline.  If  a  subjects  has  a  mean  MSWS-12  score  of  <0.5  over  the  double-blind  period,  and  a  baseline  MSWS-12 
score of <8 points, the subject is counted as a responder. 
BBased on logistic regression, adjusting for baseline MSWS-12 score, baseline TUG speed, age, screening EDSS score 
and prior aminopyridine use. 
The LS mean change in MSWS score was –6.73 point and–2.59 points in subjects treated with fampridine 
PR and placebo respectively.  The LS mean difference between the groups was –4.14 (95% CI: –6.22, –
2.06; p < 0.001). The effect of prolonged-release fampridine treatment was evident  as early as Week 2, 
and was sustained throughout the 24-week treatment period (figure 1). Upon discontinuation of double-
blind  treatment  after  24  weeks,  scores  worsened  among  subjects  treated  with  prolonged-release 
fampridine but not among those treated with placebo.

(Multiple imputation).  
Subgroup analysis primary endpoint 
Subgroup analysis largely supported the main findings. See figure 2. The proportions of responders were 
higher among subjects with RRMS, and lower among subjects with SPMS and PPMS, relative to the overall 
population. The results among subjects with PRMS were inconsistent with those of the main analysis. For 
subjects with less disability (i.e., a lower baseline MSWS-12 score), the difference in proportions and odds 
ratio are larger than those for the overall population. For subjects with greater disability, the difference in 
proportions and odds ratio are smaller than for the overall population.  
Among  subjects  with  a  baseline  EDSS  score  >6,  the  proportion  of  MSWS-12  responders  was  lower  and 
the difference between the groups was smaller for both measures.  
Among  subjects  with  RRMS,  results  were  generally  more  favourable  in  both  groups  than  for  the 
population overall, and among subjects with SPMS, results were generally slightly less favorable in both 
groups  than  for  the  population  overall,  which  may  be  expected  given  the  natural  course  of  the  disease, 
but treatment differences in favour of fampridine-PR remained.  
Among subjects with PPMS and PRMS, differences between the groups were generally smaller than for the 
population overall or, in some instances favored placebo treatment, particularly for PRMS. These findings 
were likely affected by the small sample sizes in these subgroups and also by the greater disability and 
likelihood of progression among subjects with these disease types. 
The  difference  between  the  groups  in  proportions  of  responders  on  the  MSWS-12  was  greater  among 
those  with  baseline  MSWS-12  lower  than  the  median  (67.71)  and  smaller  among  those  with  higher 
baseline scores.

Figure 2 
Within the subgroups of only males and only females, the proportions of responders were similar to that 
of the overall population for subjects treated with prolonged-release fampridine. For subjects treated with 
placebo,  the  proportions  of  responders  were  lower  among  males  and  higher  among  females  relative  to 
the  overall  population.  Male:  0.431  for  prolonged-release  fampridine  and  0.301  for  placebo;  odds  ratio 
1.91  (95%  CI:  [1.11,  3.28]).  Female:  0.434  for  prolonged-release  fampridine  and  0.362  for  placebo; 
odds ratio 1.52 (95% CI: [0.96, 2.39]). 
Because  the  number  of  subjects  over  64  years  of  age  was  small,  these  subjects  were  combined  with 
those  >45  years  of  age.  The  proportions  of  responders  in  both  treatment  groups  were  slightly  larger 
among younger subjects and slightly smaller among older subjects than those of the overall population.  
≤45  years:  0.452  for  prolonged-release  fampridine  and  0.373  for  placebo;  odds  ratio  1.48  (95%  CI: 
[0.84, 2.61]).  >45 years: 0.422 for prolonged-release fampridine and 0.315 for placebo; odds ratio 1.73 
(95% CI: [1.13, 2.65]). 
Relative  to  the  overall  population,  proportions  of  responders  were  higher  among  subjects  with 
concomitant use of immunomodulators and lower among subjects without, but the treatment differences 
were  similar  to  that  of  the  overall  population  in  favour  of  prolonged-release  fampridine.  Using 
immunomodulators: 0.483 for prolonged-release fampridine and 0.386 for placebo; odds ratio 1.58 (95% 
CI:  [0.91,  2.73]).  Not  using  immunomodulators:  0.399  for  prolonged-release  fampridine  and  0.304  for 
placebo; odds ratio 1.60 (95% CI: [1.02, 2.50]).

Exploratory analysis primary endpoint 
Exploratory analysis showed that the benefit from treatment with fampridine-PR was robust at each 
threshold of improvement from 0 to 10 points (figure 3).

Sensitivity analysis primary endpoint  
ITT  population  using  a  placebo  imputation  method:  The  proportion  of    responders  in  the  fampridine-PR 
group (0.419) was smaller than the proportion in the  main analysis (0.432), but it was still greater than 
the proportion of responders in the placebo group (0.336), and the treatment difference was statistically 
significant (p =0.013; odds ratio: 1.53; 95% CI: [1.09, 2.15]). 
ITT  population  with  adjustment  for  any  major  protocol  deviation  related  to  IP  compliance:  The 
proportions  of  responders  in  each  group  were  the  same  as  those  observed  in  the  main  analysis.  The 
treatment  difference  was statistically  significant  (p =  0.007;  odds  ratio:  1.60  in  favor  of  fampridine-PR; 
95%  CI:  [1.14,  2.25]),  and  the  interaction  was  not  statistically  significant  (p=0.720  for  the  IP 
compliance-by-treatment interaction). 
Secondary endpoints 
Results with respect to the secondary endpoints are summarised in table 4.2.2.2.b.  
A  greater  proportion  of  subjects  treated  with  fampridine-PR  demonstrated  a  mean  improvement  of  at 
least  15%  in  TUG  speed  over  24  weeks  compared  with  subjects  treated  with  placebo.  The  results  from 
the logistic regression analysis showed a statistically significant treatment difference with an odds ratio of 
1.46 (95% CI: [1.04, 2.07]; p = 0.030). The relative risk was 1.25 (95% CI: [0.99, 1.51]) and the risk 
difference was 0.092 (95% CI: [0.009, 0.175]).

The  proportion  of  subjects  reporting  any  improvement  on  the  PGIC,  which,  like  the  MSWS-12,  is  a 
patient-reported  assessment  of  walking  ability,  was  greater  in  the  fampridine-PR  group  than  in  the 
placebo  group  at  each  time  point.  At  Week  2,  which  showed  change  since  the  onset  of  treatment 
(because  the  PGIC  assessed  changes  since  the  previous  visit),  improvement  was  reported  by  116 
subjects (38%) treated with fampridine-PR and 95 subjects (31%) treated with placebo. 
Findings  for  the  EQ-5D-3L,  SDMT,  SF-36,  and  HRU  showed  relatively  little  change  from  baseline  and 
minimal differences between the groups.  
Identification of Responders 
Among subjects treated with fampridine-PR, any improvement on the MSWS-12 at Week 2 or 4 showed 
strong PPV and NPV for the response (≥8-point mean improvement) over the 24-week treatment period.  
Among subjects  who  had any improvement on the MSWS-12 at Week 2 (197 subjects), the probability 
that  a  subject  was  a  responder  based  on  ≥8-point  mean  improvement  in  the  MSWS-12  over  24  weeks 
(120  subjects),  or  the  PPV,  was  61.1%.  Of  subjects  who  were  responders  based  on  ≥8-point  mean 
improvement  in  the  MSWS-12  over  24  weeks  (136  subjects),  the  probability  that  a  subject  had  any 
improvement on the MSWS-12 at Week 2, or sensitivity, was 88.3%.  
Among subjects who had no improvement on the MSWS-12 at Week 2 (118 subjects), the probability that 
a subject was also not a responder based on ≥8-point mean improvement in the MSWS-12 over 24 weeks 
(102  subjects),  or  the  NPV,  was  86.5%.    Of  subjects  who  were  not  responders  over  24  weeks,  the 
probability that a subject had no improvement on the MSWS-12 at Week 2, or specificity, was 57.2%. 
Among  subjects  treated  with  fampridine-PR,  any  improvement  in  TUG  speed  at  Week  2  or  4  showed 
reasonable  PPV  and  strong  NPV  for  the  response  (≥15%  improvement)  over  the  24-  week  treatment 
period.  Early  improvement  in  TUG  speed  did  not  have  strong  predictive  values  for  MSWS-12  response 
over 24 weeks and early improvement in MSWS-12 did not have strong predictive values for TUG speed 
response  over  24  weeks.  A  composite  definition  of  early  response,  including  any  improvement  in  either 
measure,  did  not  have  any  stronger  predictive  power  than  the  definition  including  the  given  endpoint 
alone.

Different cut-off values for improvement on the MSWS-12 or combination of MSWS–TUG  did not lead to 
better values. 
CONCLUSION 
The  Enhance  study  met  its  primary  and  first  2  secondary  endpoints,  showing  statistically  significant 
differences  between  the  treatment  groups  in  improvements  on  MSWS-12,  TUG  speed,  and  MSIS-29 
physical component score results, and trends in favour of treatment with prolonged release fampridine in 
the BBS and ABILHAND assessments and several exploratory assessments.  
In  general,  treatment  response  was  evident  across  patient-reported  and  clinician  assessed  measures  of 
walking ability as early as Week 2 and was sustained throughout the treatment period and then returned 
to  baseline  after  treatment  was  stopped  in  the  post-treatment  follow-up  period.  Results  of  analyses  in 
subgroups defined by demographic or baseline disease characteristics were consistent with those for the 
overall study population.  
Other  analyses  support  the  use  of  assessments  performed  at  approximately  2  or  4  weeks  after  the 
initiation of treatment to predict the likelihood of longer-term response.  
These  findings  were  supported  in  a  variety  of  sensitivity  analyses,  including  one  performed  excluding 
subjects  with  prior  AP  use,  which  indicated  that  the  improvement  shown  among  subjects  treated  with 
prolonged-release fampridine was not dependent upon any greater propensity to benefit among subjects 
with prior AP treatment. 
The findings in the ENHANCE trial were consistent with previous study results of fampridine-PR as well as 
with experience in clinical use, and confirm that  fampridine-PR treatment results in clinically meaningful 
improvements in walking for MS patients with pre-existing walking disability.

4.2.3.  Discussion 
As part of CMA the Applicant conducted the ENHANCE study which now has been completed. The aim of 
the  study  was  to  evaluate  the  clinical  meaningfulness  of  the  effect  of  fampridine  in  terms  of  walking 
ability as well as the long term efficacy and safety.  
The ENHANCE study concerned a randomised placebo controlled parallel group study in 636 subjects with 
multiple  sclerosis  and  walking  disability.  Subjects  were  randomised  to  placebo  or  fampridine  PR  10  mg 
BID.  Duration  of  double-blind  was  24  weeks  with  a  2  week  post–treatment  follow-up.  Primary  endpoint 
was  the  proportion  responders  defined  as  a  subject  with  a  mean  improvement  on  the  Multiple  Sclerosis 
Walking  Scale  of  ≥  8  points  as  compared  to  baseline.  If  a  subject’s  mean  MSWS-12  was  <8  points  at 
baseline, the  subject  was  counted  as  having  a  ≥8-point  mean improvement  from  baseline if  their  mean 
MSWS-12 score during the treatment period was <0.5. 
A main inclusion criterion was the presence of a walking impairment as deemed by the investigator. This 
appears  rather  subjective.  However,  considering  the  baseline  EDSS  score  and  baseline  MSWS-12  scores 
(table 4.2.2.1b) this is not an issue.  
An improvement of 8 points on the MSWS-12 has been accepted as a clinical meaningful change in earlier 
assessment  of  the  study  protocol  of  the  ENHANCE  study.  This  was  based  on  the  results  of  the  MOBILE 
study. In this pilot study the impact of fampridine PR on overall walking disability was evaluated over a 
24 weeks in a 132 patients. Using the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) and other anchor and 
distribution-based  analyses,  the  minimum  clinically  important  difference  (MCID)  on  the  12-item  Multiple 
Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS-12) was estimated at 8 points.  However, the relevance of the MCID for 
improvement  of  Timed  Up  and  Go  i.e.  ≥15%  mean  increase  in  speed  over  a  24-week  treatment  period 
has been questioned in the same assessment. This appears to be confirmed by current data . See TABLE 
4.2.2.2.b Results main secondary outcomes.  
The ENHANCE study met its primary endpoint. The responder rate was 33.6% for placebo and 43.2% for 
fampridine PR 10 mg BID (Risk difference 10.4%, CI95% 3%; 17.8%, p=0.006). The  LS mean change in 
MSWS  score  was–6.73  point  and–2.59  points  in  subjects  treated  with  fampridine  PR  and  placebo 
respectively  (Difference  –4.14,    CI95%  –6.22,  –2.06;  p  <  0.001).  The  effect  of  prolonged-release 
fampridine  treatment  was  evident  as  early  as  week  2,  and  was  sustained  throughout  the  24-week 
treatment  period  (see  figure  1).  Upon  discontinuation  of  double-blind  treatment  after  24  weeks,  scores 
worsened  among  subjects  treated  with  prolonged-release  fampridine  but  not  among  those  treated  with 
placebo. Of note in the earlier 12 weeks studies the MSWS-12 was measured as secondary endpoint. In 
study MS-F203 the mean change from baseline (BLscore71.1) under fampridine was -2.84 points. In study 
MS-F204 the change from baseline (BLscore 73.8) was -2.77 points.  
Efficacy on the primary endpoint was consistent with the findings with respect to the TUG responders and 
MSIS29-physical  score.  There  were  no  statistical  significant  differences  with  respect  to  the  BBS  and 
ABILHAND. The proportion of subjects reporting an improvement on the PGIC was at Week 2 was 31% vs 
38%  for  placebo  and  fampridine  PR  respectively.  This  was  22%  and  28%  at  week  24.    Findings  for  the 
EQ-5D-3L, SDMT, SF-36, and HRU showed relatively little change from baseline and minimal differences 
between the groups. The  results with respect to PGIC are  unexpected as this assessment instrument as 
part of the validation of the relevance  of the MSWS-responders i.e. the relevance of a 8 point shift from 
baseline  MSWS-12.  The  results  with  respect  to  the  Berg  Balance  Scale  are  also  unexpected  considering 
the  results  of  the  pilot  study  and  the  results  of  the  TUG  assessment.  The  BBS  and  TUG  both  assesses 
balance.  
Results  with  respect  to  the  subgroups  were  consistent  although  for  subjects  with  greater  disability,  the 
effects size are smaller (see figure 2).  
Assessment report  
EMA/305262/2017 
Page 21/64 
 
  
  
Nevertheless the effect size observed is modest. The absolute 14.5% difference in responders assuming a 
50%  response  rate  under  the  null  hypothesis  was  not  met,  the  cumulative  distribution  curves  of  points 
change  from  baseline  only  slightly  separated  (see  figure  3)  and  there  was  little  change  the  several 
secondary endpoints.  
In the earlier fampridine studies (studies MS-F203 & MS-F204) a responder was defined as a patient who 
consistently  had  a  faster walking  speed  for  at least  three  visits out  of  a  possible  four  during  the  double 
blind  period  as  compared  to  the  maximum  value  among  five  non-double  blind  off-treatment  visits. 
Walking  speed  was  measured  by  the  Timed  25-foot  Walk.  In  study  MS-F203  responder  rates  was  8.3% 
versus  35%  for  placebo  and  fampridine  respectively.  For  study  MS-F204  responder  rates  were  9.3%.  
versus 43% respectively. It is noted that in the ENHANCE study responders rate in the placebo group is 
much higher. This may reflects the difference between a more objective (T25FT) and subjective (MSWS-
12) assessment of response.  
Whereas the clinical meaningfulness of the walking speed as primary endpoint was questioned (reason for 
the  CMA)  it  points  at  the  fact  that  not  all  patient  respond  on  fampridine.  This  is  confirmed  in  the 
ENHANCE  study.  This  is  not  unexpected.  Walking  disability  in  multiple  sclerosis  is  the  result  of 
combination of axonal loss and dysfunction of demyelinated axons. Fampridine only affects the latter. 
Unfortunately  the  positive  predictive  value  of  any  improvement  on  the  MSWS-12  at  week  2  or  4  is  not 
large  i.e.  61%  and  59%  respectively.  However,  the  negative  predictive  of  lack  of  any  improvement  is 
reasonable  i.e.  87%  and  86%  for  lack  of  any  response  at  week  2  and  4  respectively.  Different  cut-off 
values for improvement on the MSWS-12 or combination of MSWS–TUG  did not lead to better values. For 
subjects  with  greater  disability,  the  effects  size  are  smaller  than  for  the  overall  population.  This 
emphasises  the  need  stopping  rules.    In  the  current  SPC  it  is  stated  that  the  initial  prescription  of 
fampridine  should  be  limited  to  2  weeks  of  therapy  as  clinical  benefits  should  generally  be  identified 
within 2-weeks after starting treatment. The timed walking test (T25FW) is recommended as assessment 
instrument. If no improvement is observed fampridine should be discontinued. In addition it is stated that 
the  benefits  of  fampridine  should  be  reassessed  if  a  decline  in  walking  ability  is  observed.  This  re-
evaluation  should  include  withdrawal  of  fampridine  should  be  discontinued  if  patients  no  longer  receive 
walking benefit. There seems no reason to change the concept.  i.e. when no improvement is seen within 
2-4  weeks  continuing  fampridine  is  not  useful  and  users  should  be  re-evaluated  if  a  decline  in  walking 
ability is observed.  
In  conclusion  the  results  of  the  ENHANCE  study  confirm  that  treatment  with  fampridine  results  in  a 
clinically meaningful improvement in a proportion of patients with multiple sclerosis with walking abilities. 
The aim of the ENHANCE study i.e. to evaluate the clinical meaningfulness of the effect of fampridine in 
terms  of  walking  ability  and  to  evaluate  long  term  efficacy  is  considered  met.  Efficacy  was  maintained 
over 24 weeks and disappeared after stopping treatment. Early detection of non-responders facilitates the 
decision to discontinue treatment. However, it is also confirmed that the effect remains modest.  
4.3.  Clinical Safety aspects 
4.3.1.  ENHANCE (study 218MS305) 
This Summary of Clinical Safety summarizes the findings from the Phase 3 Study 218MS305 (Study 305) 
and the pregnancy registry Study 218MS402 (FOLLOW).  
The  latter  study  was  initiated  in  2011  and  the  first  subject  was  enrolled  on  18  August  2015.  The  study 
was  stopped  by  agreement  with  the  PRAC  due  to  lack  of  subject  exposure  to  fampridine-PR  during 
pregnancy. At the time of study closure on 23 March 2016, 1 patient was enrolled in the registry.  
Assessment report  
EMA/305262/2017

The  safety  data  base  included  635  subjects,  316  receiving  fampridine  and  319  receiving  placebo.  The 
mean  duration  of  exposure  to  fampridine-PR  was  22.6  (SD  4.72)  weeks.  Most  fampridine-PR-treated 
subjects  (98.7%)  complied  with  dosing  of  study  treatment.  The  majority  of  fampridine-PR-treated 
subjects  (85%)  took  between  ≥90%  to  ≤100%  of  study  treatment.  Exposure  and  compliance  were 
similar for the placebo-treated subjects.  
Fampridine-PR and placebo-treated groups were balanced with respect to demographics. The mean age of 
fampridine-PR-treated  subjects  49.0  (SD  9.82)  with  the  majority  of  subjects  ≤64  years  old;  59%  were 
female; and the mean body mass index was 25.6 kg/m2. Most subjects did not report race and ethnicity 
due  to  confidentiality  regulations.  Similarly,  the  baseline  disease  characteristics  of  the  fampridine-PR-
treated safety population and the placebo groups were comparable. See table 1b.  
Concomitant medication used was comparable between the safety population and the placebo group. The 
most  common  medications  used  by  ≥10%  of  fampridine-PR-treated  subjects  included  baclofen  (21%), 
colecalciferol  (15%),  tizanidine,  methylprednisolone  (11%  each),  ibuprofen,  and  paracetamol  (10% 
each).  
In table 4.3.1.1 a general overview of the adverse events is presented.  
The  incidence  of  AEs  reported  in  Study  305  was  similar  between  the  2  treatment  groups  (66% 
fampridine-PR, 60% placebo). Most subjects had AEs that were considered mild or moderate in severity, 
and the incidence of AEs that were considered severe was the same (3%) in each treatment group. The 
incidence of AEs related to study treatment was higher in fampridine-PR-treated subjects than in placebo-
treated subjects (18% vs. 13%). 
One subject in each group had an AE that led to death during the study (i.e., during the 2-week follow-up 
period after the end of treatment); 2 additional deaths (1 subject in each group) occurred after the end of 
the study.  
Serious  events  also  occurred  at  a  similar  incidence  (8%  vs.  7%).  The  incidence  of  AEs  leading  to  study 
treatment discontinuation (7% each group) or withdrawal from the study (8% vs. 7%) was also balanced. 
The  incidence  of  AEs  leading  to  dose  interruption  was  slightly  higher  for  fampridine-PR-treated  subjects 
than for those treated with placebo (6% vs. 3%).

Common  adverse  events  and  some  adverse  events  interest  (by  assessor)  are  presented  with  table 
4.3.1.2.   
Most  the  most  common  system  organ  class  for  reported  AEs  were  infections  and  infestations  (31%  vs. 
28%),  nervous  system  disorders  (27%  vs.  21%),  and  musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders 
(18%  vs.  13%).  In  addition  there  were  more  AEs  reported  for  gastrointestinal  disorders  for  fampridine-
PR-treated subjects (14% vs. 8%).  
The most common AEs among nervous system disorders were MS relapse, headache, and dizziness, and 
the most common AEs among musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders were back pain, arthralgia, 
and  pain  in  extremity.  Otherwise,  the  incidence  of  AEs  in  particular  system  organ  class  was  similar 
between the 2 treatment groups. 
The most frequently reported AEs in both treatment groups were MS relapse and urinary tract infection, 
consistent with the MS study population. The AEs that occurred at an incidence ≥3% among fampridine-
PR-treated  subjects  compared  with  the  placebo  group  were  UTI  and  insomnia.  No  other  AEs  were  more 
common among subjects treated with placebo than among those treated with fampridine-PR.

Adverse Events by Severity 
The majority of AEs in the fampridine-PR and placebo groups were considered to be mild (30% vs. 29% 
placebo) or moderate (33% vs. 28%) in severity. The incidence of AEs considered severe was the same 
for  the  2  treatment  groups  (3%  each).  The  following  severe  events  occurred  in  <1%  (1  subject)  of 
fampridine-PR  treated  subjects:  UTI,  diverticulitis,  gallbladder  empyema,  breast  cancer,  MS  relapse, 
balance  disorder,  MS,  coronary  artery  stenosis,  constipation,  pain  in  extremity,  chest  pain,  white  blood 
cell count (WBC) increased, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, hemoglobin decreased, and neutrophil 
count increased.  
Treatment related Adverse Events  
Most AEs in both treatment groups were considered not related to study treatment (48% vs. 46%). The 
incidence of AEs considered related to study treatment in the fampridine-PR group was 18% as compared 
with 13% in the placebo group.  
Deaths 
Four  events  with  a  fatal  outcome  (2  per  treatment  group)  were  reported  during  or  shortly  after 
completion of the study.  All deaths occurred after the subject discontinued study treatment. The events 
leading to death were considered not related to study treatment. Events of coronary artery stenosis (n=1, 
fampridine-PR  group)  and  acute  myocardial  infarction  (n=1,  placebo  group)  led  to  fatal  outcomes  that 
occurred prior to the end of the 2-week post-treatment follow-up period. Events of lung cancer with liver 
and  brain  metastasis  (n=1,  fampridine-PR)  and  ovarian  endometrioid  carcinoma  (n=1,  placebo)  led  to 
death that occurred after the 2-week follow-up period after the last dose of study treatment.  
Other Serious Adverse Events 
In  Study  305,  the  incidence  of  SAEs  was  comparable  between  the  2  treatment  groups  (8%  vs.7%).  MS 
relapse was the most frequently reported SAE in both groups (4% [14 subjects] vs. 3% [10 subjects]). 
All other SAEs in both groups occurred at a low frequency of <1%.  
Excluding  MS  relapse,  SAEs  reported  in  the  fampridine-PR  group  were  UTI,  fall  (2  subjects  each), 
diverticulitis, gallbladder empyema, bladder cancer, breast cancer, uterine leiomyoma, vertigo  positional, 
coronary  artery  stenosis,  peripheral  ischemia,  chest  pain,  humerus  fracture,  and  joint  dislocation  (1 
subject each).  
Excluding MS relapse, serious events reported in the placebo group were fall (2 subjects), UTI, injection 
site  infection,  ovarian  endometrioid  carcinoma,  dizziness,  anxiety,  mental  disorder,  acute  myocardial 
infarction,  atrioventricular  block  second  degree,  intervertebral  disc  disorder,  abortion  spontaneous, 
endometrial atrophy, metrorrhagia, ankle fracture, and femur fracture (1 subject each).  
Other  than  the  SAEs  of  anxiety  and  mental  disorder  experienced  by  one  subject  in  the  placebo  group, 
none of the other SAEs were considered related to study treatment. 
Adverse Events leading to discontinuation or dose interruption  
The  incidence  of  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  study  treatment  or  study  withdrawal  was  comparable 
between  the  2  treatment  groups  (7%  vs.  8%).  MS  relapse  and  MS  led  to  discontinuation  or  withdrawal 
(MS relapse, 3 subjects vs. 1 subject; MS, 2 fampridine-PR-treated subjects).  
Excluding  the  events  of  MS  relapse  and  MS,  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  or  withdrawal  in  the 
fampridine-PR group were creatinine renal clearance decreased (5 subjects), pain in extremity (2 subjects

each),  UTI,  breast  cancer,  anxiety,  insomnia,  balance  disorder,  vertigo,  coronary  artery  stenosis, 
constipation, renal impairment, asthenia, fatigue, gastric pH increased, and fall (1 subject each). 
Excluding the events of MS relapse and MS, AEs leading to discontinuation or withdrawal in the placebo 
group  were  creatinine  renal  clearance  decreased  (6  subjects),  trigeminal  neuralgia  (2  subjects),  UTI, 
injection site infection, ovarian endometrioid carcinoma, tension, acute myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, 
palpitations,  drug  eruption,  limb  discomfort,  muscle  spasms,  renal  impairment,  chest  pain,  creatinine 
renal clearance abnormal, and femur fracture (1 subject each).  
The  incidence  of  AEs  leading  to  dose  interruption  was  6%  and  3%  in  the  fampridine-PR  and  placebo 
groups, respectively. The incidence of SAEs leading to dose interruption was low (<1%). 
AEs  leading  to  dose  interruption  in  the  fampridine-PR  group  were  nausea  (3  subjects),  UTI,  fall  (2 
subjects  each),  diverticulitis,  gallbladder  empyema,  gastroenteritis,  influenza,  lower  respiratory  tract 
infection,  nasopharyngitis,  balance  disorder,  migraine,  MS  relapse,  constipation,  dyspepsia,  pruritus 
generalized,  rash,  back  pain,  pain  in  extremity,  micturition  urgency,  chest  pain,  creatinine  clearance 
abnormal, creatinine clearance decreased, contusion, and laceration (1 subject each) 
AEs  leading  to  dose  interruption  that  occurred  in  the  placebo  group  were  MS  relapse  (2  subjects), 
gastroenteritis,  pneumonia, 
tooth  abscess,  viral 
infection,  anxiety, 
insomnia,  panic  attack, 
hemianaesthesia, motion sickness, cough, nausea, food poisoning, rash, and myalgia (1 subject each)

To identify potential drug-drug interactions, AEs of subjects who received any concomitant Organic cation 
transport 2 (OCT2) inhibitors, OCT2 substrates, concomitant medications with a potential to lower seizure 
threshold, or anti-epileptic agents affecting the sodium-potassium current were evaluated.  AEs were also 
evaluated  as  a  function  of  subjects’  CrCl  at  screening.  In  addition,  AEs  in  subjects  who  had  a  Post-
baseline CrCl value <80 mL/min were assessed.  
The incidence of AEs in the specified concomitant medications subgroups was similar for each treatment 
group. No patterns were observed in AEs reported for fampridine-treated subjects receiving the specified 
concomitant  medications.  No  events  of  seizure  or  convulsion  activity  were  reported  for  fampridine-PR- 
and placebo-treated subjects in any of these subgroups.  
Concomitant OCT2 inhibitors 
In this subgroup, AEs were reported for 27 of 30 subjects (90%) in the fampridine-PR group and 26 of 27 
subjects  (96%)  in the  placebo group.  UTI  was  reported  for  3  and  5  fampridine-PR-  and  placebo-treated 
subjects,  respectively,  rash  was  reported  for  2  and  1  subjects,  MS  relapse  was  reported  for  16  and  9 
subjects,  hypoesthesia  was  reported  for  3  and  1  subjects,  and  balance  disorder  was  reported  for  1 
subject  in  each  group.  Cardiac  disorders  were  reported  in  2  fampridine-PR-treated  subjects  who  also 
received  concomitant  OCT2  inhibitors  (extrasystoles  and  tachycardia,  1  subject;  atrioventricular  block 
first degree, 1 subject) and in 1 placebo-treated subject.  
Concomitant OCT2 substrates 
AEs  were  reported  for  22  of  29  (76%)  fampridine-PR-treated  subjects  and  10  of  15  (67%)  placebo-
treated  subjects  who  received  concomitant  OCT2  substrates,  i.e.,  any  medication  coded  to  carvedilol, 
propranolol, metformin, amantadine, or varenicline (use of cimetidine was not reported for any subject). 
UTI  was  reported  for  5  and  0  fampridine-PR-  and  placebo-treated  subjects,  respectively,  headache  was 
reported  for  2  and  0  subjects,  balance  disorder  was  reported  for  1  and  0  subjects,  tachycardia  was 
reported  for  1  and  0  subjects,  constipation  was  reported  for  3  and  0  subjects,  micturition  urgency  was 
reported  for  2  and  0  subjects,  increased  creatinine  renal  clearance  was  reported  for  1  and  0  subjects 
asthenia  was  reported  for  4  and  0  patients,  fall  was  reported  for  3  and  1  subjects,  and  vertigo  was 
reported for 1 subject in each group. 
Concomitant medications with a potential to lower seizure threshold 
Among  subjects  who  received  potential  seizure  threshold-lowering  medications,  AEs  were  reported  for 
135  of  165  subjects  (82%)  in  the  fampridine-PR  group  and  113  of  157  subjects  (72%)  in  the  placebo 
group.  No  seizure  or  convulsion  activity  was  reported  among  these  subjects.  Nervous  system  disorders 
reported  for  38%  and  33%  of  subjects  in  the  fampridine-PR  and  placebo  groups,  respectively,  included 
MS  relapse  (19%  [32  subjects]  fampridine-PR,  18%  [29  subjects]  placebo),  dizziness  (4%  [7  subjects] 
fampridine-PR,  4%  [6  subjects]  placebo),  and  headache  (6%  [7  subjects]  fampridine-PR),  4%  [10 
subjects] placebo).  
Concomitant anti-epileptic agents affecting the sodium-potassium  
In this subgroup, AEs were reported for 32 of 43 subjects (74%) in the fampridine-PR group and 32 of 44 
subjects  (73%)  in  the  placebo  group.  No  seizure  or  convulsion  activity  was  reported  among  these 
subjects.  Nervous  system  disorders  reported  for  33%  and  32%  of  fampridine-PR  and  placebo-treated 
subjects, respectively, included MS relapse (12% [5 subjects] fampridine-PR, 14% [6 subjects] placebo). 
Creatinine clearance at screening (<80 mL/min, ≥80 mL/min)

Four  subjects  in  each  group  had  screening  CrCl  <80  mL/min  of  whom  2  subjects  in  the  fampridine-PR 
group and 3 subjects in the placebo group had at least 1 AE of any type during the study. Notable non-
serious  AEs  in  this  subgroup  were  abnormal  creatinine  renal  clearance  and  micturition  urgency  (both 
events reported in 1 fampridine-treated and decreased creatinine renal clearance (reported for 2 placebo-
treated subjects). 
Any post-baseline creatinine clearance <80 mL/min 
In this subgroup, AEs were reported for 31 of 39 subjects (79%) in the fampridine-PR group and 30 of 41 
subjects (73%) in the placebo group (73%). No seizure or convulsion activity was reported among these 
subjects.  Arrhythmia  was  reported  for  1  subject  treated  with  placebo,  and  atrioventricular  block  first 
degree was reported for 1 subject treated with fampridine-PR.  
Clinical laboratory evaluations  
There were no clinically meaningful changes in group mean laboratory hematology, blood chemistry and 
there  was  no  clear  pattern  in  the  occurrence  of  abnormal  values,  including  numbers  of  shifts  from 
baseline. 
Vital signs, physical findings and other observations related to safety  
There were notable changes in vital signs were observed during the study.  
ECG: Two subjects treated with fampridine-PR had a normal ECG at baseline and a shift to an abnormal 
ECG that was considered an AE. Neither event was serious, and both were considered mild in severity and 
not  related  to  study  treatment.  Shifts  from  normal  to  abnormal  (but  not  an  AE)  were  reported  for  16 
fampridine-PR-treated subjects and 20 placebo-treated subjects.  
MS-relapse: Suspected MS relapse was reported for 31 subjects (10%) treated with fampridine-PR (27 of 
whom were treated with methylprednisolone) and for 28 subjects (9%) treated with placebo (15 of whom 
were treated with methylprednisolone).  
Overdose:  Three  subjects  (2  treated  with  fampridine-PR  and  1  treated  with  placebo)  mistakenly  took  a 
double  dose  during  the  study.  Four  subjects  (2  in  each  group)  did  not  have  confirmed  overdose  but 
returned  fewer  tablets  than  expected  at  a  compliance  check,  and  it  was  not  clear  whether  the  tablets 
were lost or the subject took extra tablets. No AEs as a result of overdose were reported.  
CONCLUSION 
The  Applicant  concludes  that  the  safety  findings  for  fampridine-PR  in  Study  305  are  consistent  with  the 
known  safety  profile  of  fampridine-PR  as  observed  in  previous  clinical  trials  and  post-marketing 
experience.  Review of the Study 305 safety data with respect to the important risks of seizures, serious 
hypersensitivity,  UTIs,  and  interactions  with  OCT2  inhibitors  did  not  reveal  any  new  safety  findings.  No 
unexpected AEs were observed in Study 305, and there are no new safety signals with potential impact to 
the benefit-risk assessment of fampridine.  
Discussion 
It was concluded that the observed safety profile in study 305 was not different from what was already 
known and that no new signals were raised.

4.3.2.  Follow registry 
The primary objective of the FOLLOW registry (Study 218MS402) was to evaluate the outcomes of 
pregnancy in women with multiple sclerosis (MS) who were exposed to prolonged-release fampridine 
since the first day of their last menstrual period (LMP) prior to conception or at any time during 
pregnancy. 
In agreement with the PRAC 10 September 2015 (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00001352/201501), the study was 
terminated early due to lack of subject exposure to prolonged-release fampridine during pregnancy. The 
PRAC agreed with the Applicant proposal of using a targeted follow-up pregnancy questionnaire in all 
cases (maternal/paternal exposure during pregnancy) reported to the Applicant. 
At the time of study closure (23 March 2016), only 1 patient was enrolled in the registry.  
Discussion 
The MAH provided the final study report of the FOLLOW registry which was terminated early following the 
PRAC recommendation in PSUSA procedure EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00001352/201501. One patient was 
enrolled As agreed in PSUSA procedure EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00001352/201501 all future pregnancy cases 
will be followed using a targeted follow-up pregnancy questionnaire.  
4.4.  Risk management plan 
As submission of the ENHANCE data fulfils the specific obligation, the MAH requests to convert the 
marketing authorisation from conditional to a full licence. 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version with this application. The main proposed RMP changes were 
the following: 
-  Updated information (results) on the completed study ENHANCE (218MS305) 
-  Removed the safety concern Lack of efficacy from the missing information section based on ENHANCE 
data 
The MAH has also taken the opportunity to remove redundant information to improve readability. 
Safety concerns 
Removed text indicated by strikethrough. New text is underlined.  
Assessment report  
EMA/305262/2017 
Page 29/64 
 
  
  
Long-term efficacy (which had been included as missing information) has been removed by the MAH. As 
part of the conditional approval long-term efficacy data should be obtained from the ENHANCE study: a 
double-blinded, placebo-controlled, long-term efficacy and safety study to investigate a broader primary 
endpoint clinically meaningful in terms of walking ability and to further evaluate the early identification of 
responders in order to guide further treatment. As the obligatory ENHANCE study has been finalised, the 
MAH removed long-term efficacy as missing information. This is accepted, depending of the outcome of 
the CHMP discussion on the results of this study.

Pharmacovigilance plan 
The PRAC Rapporteur is of the opinion that the proposed post-authorisation PhV development plan is 
sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product, depending on the outcome of the CHMP 
discussion on long-term efficacy (ENHANCE study). 
The PRAC Rapporteur also considers that the studies in the post-authorisation development plan remain 
sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of the risk minimisation measures (RMMs).

The PRAC Rapporteur is of the opinion that the proposed RMMs remain sufficient to minimise the risks of 
the product in the proposed indication(s). 
Please include only a brief summary of the SmPC text in the summary table of risk minimisation 
measures, instead of the exact wording, in order to avoid unnecessary updates of the RMP. 
Elements for a public summary of the RMP 
The elements for a public summary of the RMP have been updated accordingly.  
Annexes 
The annexes have been updated appropriately.  
Overall conclusion on the RMP 
The changes to the RMP are considered acceptable, depending on the outcome of the CHMP discussion on 
the results of the ENHANCE study on long-term efficacy. 
The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version of 
Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion should be 
submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu.

CHMP comment  
The  MAH  proposed  to  remove  the  product  from  the  list  of  products  with  additional  monitoring  (see 
removal  additional  monitoring  and  black  triangle  from  the  SmPC).  This  was  agreed  as  there  are  no 
outstanding conditions to the MA and the active substance has been authorised for more than 5 years.  
1. 
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
Fampyra 10 mg prolonged-release tablets 
2. 
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 
Each prolonged-release tablet contains 10 mg of fampridine. 
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Prolonged-release tablet. 
An off-white, film coated, oval biconvex 13 x 8 mm tablet with flat edge debossed with A10 on one side. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Fampyra is indicated for the improvement of walking in adult patients with multiple sclerosis with walking 
disability (EDSS 4-7).   
4.2 Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with Fampyra is restricted to prescription and supervision by physicians experienced in the 
management of MS.  
Posology 
The recommended dose is one 10 mg tablet, twice daily, taken 12 hours apart (one tablet in the morning 
and one tablet in the evening). Fampyra should not be administered more frequently or at higher doses 
than recommended (see section 4.4). The tablets should can be taken with or without food (see section 
5.2). The tablets should be taken without food (see section 5.2). 
CHMP comment 1st round 
Insufficient justification is provided in support of this change i.e.   
The guidance regarding administration with food has been clarified in line with the Core Data  Sheet (CDS) 
that  was  amended  to  “can  be  taken  with  or  without  food”  in  version  04  (14  September  2012).  The  CDS 
update was included with submission of PSUR 03. On review of PSUR 03 (EMEA/H/C/2097/PSU 004, PRAC 
maintenance recommendation 05 September 2013), PRAC recommended the SmPC be updated to align with 
the CDS”

However  this  was  apparently  was  general  recommendation.  With  respect  to  the  claim  of  ‘no  clinically 
meaningful  consequences  when  administered  with  food’  it  was  stated  that  should  comment  on  the 
differences in this respect between the US and EU labelling and reconsider the need of a type II variation 
to update the EU SmPC.   
Hence  the  Applicant  should  provided  a  further  justification  for  this  change  or  the  current  text  should 
remain. 
Applicant’s response  
The  applicant  dropped  the  initial  proposal:    The  tablets  should  can  be  taken  with  or  without  food 
(see section 5.2) and reintroduced the original text: The tablets should be taken without food (see section 
5.2). 
Assessment of the response  
Resolved  
Starting and Evaluating Fampyra Treatment 
• 
• 
Initial prescription should be limited to two to four  2 weeks of therapy as clinical benefits should 
generally be identified within two to four  2 weeks after starting Fampyra 
A timed walking test An assessment of walking ability, e.g. the Timed 25 Foot Walk (T25FW) or 
Twelve Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS-12), is recommended to evaluate 
improvement after two weeks within two to four weeks. If no improvement is observed,  Fampyra 
should be discontinued Fampyra should be discontinued if benefit is not reported by patients. 
Re-Evaluating Fampyra Treatment 
If decline in walking ability is observed, physicians should consider an interruption to treatment in order 
to reassess the benefits of Fampyra (see above). The re-evaluation should include withdrawal of Fampyra 
and performing the walking test an assessment of walking ability. Fampyra should be discontinued if 
patients no longer receive walking benefit. 
CHMP comment 1st round 
Agreed changes are consistent with results of the ENHANCE studies. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to fampridine or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Concurrent treatment with other medicinal products containing fampridine (4-aminopyridine). 
Patients with prior history or current presentation of seizure.  
Patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearances <80 ml/min). 
Concomitant use of Fampyra with medicinal products that are inhibitors of Organic Cation Transporter 2 
(OCT2) for example, cimetidine. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Seizure risk

Page 41/64 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Treatment with fampridine increases seizure risk (see section 4.8). 
Fampyra should be administered with caution in the presence of any factors which may lower seizure 
threshold. 
Fampyra should be discontinued in patients who experience a seizure while on treatment.   
Renal impairment 
Fampyra is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Patients with renal impairment have higher 
plasma concentrations which are associated with increased adverse reactions, in particular neurological 
effects. Determining renal function before treatment and its regular monitoring during treatment is 
recommended in all patients (particularly in older people in whom renal function might be reduced). 
Creatinine clearance can be estimated using the Cockroft-Gault formula. 
Fampyra should not be administered to patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance <80 ml/min) 
(see section 4.3). 
Caution is required when Fampyra is prescribed concurrently with medicinal products that are substrates 
of OCT2 for example, carvedilol, propanolol and metformin.   
Hypersensitivity Reactions 
In post-marketing experience, serious hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylactic reaction) have 
been reported, the majority of these cases occurred within the first week of treatment.  Particular 
attention should be given to patients with a previous history of allergic reactions.  If an anaphylactic or 
other serious allergic reaction occurs, Fampyra should be discontinued and not restarted. 
Other warnings and precautions 
Fampyra should be administered with caution to patients with cardiovascular symptoms of rhythm and 
sinoatrial or atrioventricular conduction cardiac disorders (these effects are seen in overdose). There is 
limited safety information in these patients.  
The increased incidence of dizziness and balance disorder seen with Fampyra may result in an increased 
risk of falls. Therefore, patients should use walking aids as needed. 
In clinical studies low white blood cell counts were seen in 2.1% of Fampyra patients versus 1.9% of 
patients on placebo. Infections were seen in the clinical studies as stated below. An increased infection 
rate and impairment of the immune response cannot be excluded.

Applicant’s response  
The applicant deleted the text and table as indicated.  
Assessment of the response  
Resolved  
4.5  Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
Concurrent treatment with other medicinal products containing fampridine (4-aminopyridine) is 
contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
Fampridine is eliminated mainly via the kidneys with active renal secretion accounting for about 60% (see 
section 5.2). OCT2 is the transporter responsible for the active secretion of fampridine. Thus, the 
concomitant use of fampridine with medicinal products that are inhibitors of OCT2 for example, cimetidine 
are contraindicated (see section 4.3) and concomitant use of fampridine with medicinal products that are 
substrates of OCT2 for example, carvedilol, propanolol and metformin is cautioned (see section 4.4.)  
Interferon: fampridine has been administered concomitantly with interferon-beta and no pharmacokinetic 
medicinal product interactions were observed. 
Baclofen: fampridine has been administered concomitantly with baclofen and no pharmacokinetic 
medicinal product interactions were observed.  
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of fampridine in pregnant women. 
Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure it is 
preferable to avoid the use of Fampyra in pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether fampridine is excreted in human or animal milk. Fampyra is not recommended 
during breast-feeding. 
Fertility  
In animal studies no effects on fertility were seen. 
CHMP comment  1st round 
Preferred is: There are limited data from the use of fampridine in pregnant women.

4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Fampyra has a moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines because Fampyra can cause 
dizziness. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
The safety of Fampyra has been evaluated in randomised controlled clinical studies, in open label long 
term studies and in the post marketing setting. 
Adverse reactions identified are mostly neurological and include seizure, insomnia, anxiety, balance 
disorder, dizziness, paraesthesia, tremor, headache and asthenia. This is consistent with fampridine’s 
pharmacological activity. The highest incidence of adverse reactions identified from placebo-controlled 
trials in multiple sclerosis patients with Fampyra given at the recommended dose, are reported as urinary 
tract infection (in approximately 12% of patients). 
Adverse reactions are presented below by system organ class and absolute frequency. Frequencies are 
defined as: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); 
rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the 
available data). 
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness.

Hypersensitivity 
In post-marketing experience, there have been reports of hypersensitivity reactions (including 
anaphylaxis) which have occurred with one or more of the following: dyspnoea, chest discomfort, 
hypotension, angioedema, rash and urticaria. For further information on hypersensitivity reactions, please 
refer to sections 4.3 and 4.4. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are 
asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
Member state comment 1st round: 
Palpitations and tachycardia have been noted in ENHANCE and should be reflected in the SmPC which is 
endorsed by the Rapporteur.  The Applicant should also define the frequency of these adverse reactions. 
Applicant’s response  
Cardiovascular  disorders  are  an  important  potential  risk  of  fampridine  based  on  the  pharmacologic 
properties of Fampridine as a potassium channel blocker. It is an important potential risk described in the 
current  EU  RMP  and  caution  is  advised  in  the  EU  SmPC  when  administering  to  patients  with 
cardiovascular symptoms (Section 4.4 Special Warnings and Precautions for Use). 
Since the MAHs last review of Cardiac Dysrhythmic events in PSUR 8 (DLP 21 January 2016) new clinical 
trial  data  from  Study  305  has  become  available  showing:  Cardiac  Dysrhythmic  event:  Fampridine  6 
(1.9%) vs Placebo 2 (0.6%), Palpitations: Fampridine 4 (1.3%) vs Placebo 1 (0.3%). 
However,  the  numbers  of  events  is  small  and  the  incidence  of  palpitations  in  this  study  is  lower  than 
might  be  expected  in  the  general  population,  based  on  epidemiological  data.  The  data  for  these  events 
from Study 305 are not supported by that from previous or ongoing studies involving fampridine. 
Disproportionality  analyses  using  EB05  scores  are  not  suggestive  of  a  causal  relationship  and  review  of 
post-marketing data remains inconclusive and unchanged.

It  is  concluded  by  the  MAH  that  on  balance  that  the  most  recent  review  of  cardiac  dysrhythmic  events 
does  not  reveal  any  significant  new  safety  information  and  is  consistent  with  current  known  risks  and 
labelling. Therefore the MAH concludes that no changes to the prescribing information for fampridine are 
required.   
Assessment of the response  
As  stated  cardiovascular  disorders  is  an  important  potential  risk  of  fampridine  based  on  the 
pharmacologic properties of Fampridine as a potassium channel blocker. This is an argument sufficient on 
its own for a causal relationship between fampridine use and cardiac dysrhythmic events. Further cardiac 
arrhythmias  and  ventricular  tachycardia  are  reported  as  with  an  overdose  of  4-AP.  It  is  acknowledged 
that, the numbers of Cardiac Dysrhythmic events reported is small. However there is a consistent higher 
incidence as compared to placebo.  
Considering  al  this  the  MAA  is  requested  to  incorporate  palpitations  and  tachycardia  in  section  4.8  with 
corresponding frequency category. 
Issue resolved upon subsequent submission of updated PI by the MAH.   
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group:  Other nervous system drugs, ATC code: N07XX07. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Fampyra is a potassium channel blocker. By blocking potassium channels, Fampyra reduces the leakage 
of ionic current through these channels, thereby prolonging repolarization and thus enhancing action 
potential formation in demyelinated axons and neurological function. Presumably, by enhancing action 
potential formation, more impulses might be conducted in the central nervous system. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Two Three phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled confirmatory studies, (MS-F203 and 
MS-F204 and 218MS305) have been performed. The proportion of responders was independent of 
concomitant immunomodulatory therapy (including interferons, glatiramer acetate, fingolimod and 
natalizumab). The majority of patients in these studies were using immunomodulatory medicines The 
Fampyra dose was 10 mg BID.  
CHMP comment 1st round 
Agreed  
Studies MS-F203 and MS-F204 
The primary endpoint in studies MS-F203 and MS-F204 was the responder rate in walking speed as 
measured by the Timed 25-foot Walk (T25FW). A responder was defined as a patient who consistently 
had a faster walking speed for at least three visits out of a possible four during the double blind period as 
compared to the maximum value among five non-double blind off-treatment visits. 
A significantly greater proportion of Fampyra treated patients taking Fampyra 10 mg BID were 
responders as compared to placebo (MS-F203: 34.8% vs. 8.3%, p<0.001; MS-F204: 42.9% vs. 9.3%, 
p<0.001).

Patients who responded to Fampyra increased their walking speed on average by 26.3% vs 5.3% on 
placebo (p<0.001) (MS-F203) and 25.3% vs 7.8% (p< 0.001) (MS-F204). The improvement appeared 
rapidly (within weeks) after starting Fampyra.   
Statistically and clinically meaningful improvements in walking were seen, as measured by the 12- item 
Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale.

Study 218MS305 
The primary endpoint in study 218MS305 was improvement in walking ability, measured as the 
proportion of patients achieving a mean improvement of ≥ 8 points from baseline MSWS-12 score over 
24 weeks.  In this study there was a statistically significant treatment difference, with a greater 
proportion of Fampyra treated patients demonstrating an improvement in walking ability, compared to 
placebo-controlled patients (0.432 vs. 0.336; odds ratio: 1.61; p=0.006).  A higher proportion of 
Fampyra treated patients displayed improvement in walking ability at all magnitudes of change in MSWS-
12 score (from 1 to 10 points), compared to placebo.  Improvements generally appeared within 2 to 4 
weeks of initiation of treatment, and disappeared within 2 weeks of treatment cessation.  
Fampyra treated patients also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the Timed Up and 
Go (TUG) test, a measure of static and dynamic balance and physical mobility. In this secondary 
endpoint, a greater proportion of Fampyra treated patients achieved ≥ 15% mean improvement from 
baseline TUG speed over a 24 week period, compared to placebo (0.434 vs. 0.347; odds ratio: 1.46; 
p=0.030).  
The Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29), a patient reported outcome (PRO) measure to assess the 
change from baseline in a patient’s physical well-being over 24 weeks, was an additional secondary 
endpoint in study 218MS305. In this measure, patients treated with Fampyra demonstrated a statistically 
significant mean improvement from baseline compared to placebo (Least Squares (LS) mean difference -
3.31, p<0.001).

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Fampyra 
in all subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of multiple sclerosis with walking disability (see 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
The medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called "conditional approval" scheme. This means 
that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited, in particular about Fampyra’s benefits beyond 
its effects on walking speed and with respect to early identification of responders. A study will be 
conducted to investigate this. The European Medicines Agency will review new information on this 
medicinal product at least every year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary.  
Study 218MS305

improvement in walking ability, measured as the proportion of patients achieving a mean improvement of 
≥ 8 points from baseline MSWS-12 score over 24 weeks.  In this study there was a statistically significant 
treatment difference, with a greater proportion of Fampyra treated patients demonstrating an 
improvement in walking ability, compared to placebo-controlled patients (relative risk of 1.38 (95% CI:  
[1.06, 1.70]).  Improvements generally appeared within 2 to 4 weeks of initiation of treatment, and 
disappeared within 2 weeks of treatment cessation.  
Fampyra treated patients also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the Timed Up and 
Go (TUG) test, a measure of static and dynamic balance and physical mobility. In this secondary 
endpoint, a greater proportion of Fampyra treated patients achieved ≥ 15% mean improvement from 
baseline TUG speed over a 24 week period, compared to placebo (relative risk of 1.25 (95% CI:  [0.99, 
1.51]). The mean (SD) TUG time taken at baseline was 27.1 (42.03) seconds for placebo and 24.9 
(26.61) seconds for Fampyra. The Least Squares Mean (LSM) change (standard error) over 24 weeks was 
-1.9 (0.78) seconds for placebo and -3.3 (0.75) seconds for Fampyra. In addition, a positive and 
sustained treatment effect was observed   The difference in the Berg Balance Scale (BBS; a measure of 
static balance), although the difference was not statistically significant. 
In addition, patients treated with Fampyra demonstrated a statistically significant mean improvement 
from baseline compared to placebo in the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29) physical score (LSM 
difference -3.31, p<0.001).

The initial information on the study design of the ENHANCE study was considered incomplete. See above.   
Results should not be expressed in terms of odd-ratio’s these exaggerate the treatment. The relevance of 
the Timed Up and GO responder definition is questioned See discussion. The TUG is claimed as a measure 
of  static  and  dynamic  balance  and  physical  mobility.  However  no  effect  was  seen  on  the  Berg  Balance 
Scale  the  preferred  scale  to  measures  balance.  Endpoints  in  the  table  do  not  have  to  be  recapitulated 
extensively in the text.  Further the format of the table for the Enhance should be consistent with that of 
the study MS-F203/204. Considering al this the following text and table is proposed: 
Study 218MS305 
Study  218MS30  concerned  a  randomised  double-blind  placebo  controlled  parallel  group  study  in  636 
subjects with multiple sclerosis and walking disability. Subjects were randomised to placebo or fampridine 
PR 10 mg BID. Duration of double-blind was 24 weeks with a 2 week post–treatment follow-up.  
The  primary  endpoint  in  study  218MS305  was  improvement  in  walking  ability,  measured  as  the 
proportion  of  patients  achieving  a  mean  improvement  of  ≥  8  points  from  baseline  MSWS-12  score  over 
24 weeks.   
In  this  study  there  was  a  statistically  significant  treatment  difference,  with  a  greater  proportion  of 
Fampyra  treated  patients  demonstrating  an  improvement  in  walking  ability,  compared  to  placebo-
controlled patients (43% vs. 34%.  Improvements generally appeared within 2 to 4 weeks of initiation of 
treatment,  and  disappeared  within  2  weeks  of  treatment  cessation.  In  addition  patients  treated  with 
Fampyra demonstrated a statistically significant mean improvement from baseline compared to placebo in 
the MS-Impact score.

If the Applicant insist on maintaining the TUG responders in the labelling the baseline values and absolute 
change from baseline should be presented as well. It allows the reader to assess the relevance of a 1.4 
second difference in TUG this between placebo and active treatment considering baseline performance is 
around 26 seconds. Moreover the result on the BBS should be presented for  a balanced assessment. See 
table 4.2.2.2b results on secondary outcomes.  
Further whether the CMA can be converted to a full  MAA will depend on the response to the request for 
supplementary information

Assessment of the response  
The text as proposed is largely agreed but not completely. 
The following text is hardly readable hampering interpretation:  
The  mean  (SD)  TUG  time  taken  at  baseline  was  27.1  (42.03)  seconds  for  placebo  and  24.9  (26.61) 
seconds  for  Fampyra.  The  Least  Squares  Mean  (LSM)  change  (standard  error)  over  24  weeks  was  -1.9 
(0.78)  seconds  for  placebo  and  -3.3  (0.75)  seconds  for  Fampyra.  Moreover  an  effect  is  suggested 
whereas  the  difference  was  not  statistically  significant.  Instead  the  information  should  be  added  to  the 
table. See proposal above in blue. This is more readable and allows a better assessment of data by the 
reader.  
Further  that  a  positive  and  sustained  treatment  effect  was  observed  in  the  Berg  Balance  Scale  is 
misleading. It refers to an improvement from baseline and does not carry information on the magnitude 
of  this  change.    More  important  an  effect  is  suggested  whereas  the  change  form  baseline  was  equal  in 
both  groups.  Hence  a  treatment  effect  can  not  be  claimed.  Therefore  this  text  should  be  adapted  as 
indicated in blue.  
Additional adaptations are considered needed  
Issue subsequently resolved upon submission of updated PI by the MAH.   
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption: 
When Fampyra tablets are taken with food, the reduction in the area under the plasma concentration-
time curve (AUC0-∞) of fampridine is approximately 2-7% (10 mg dose) and The small reduction in AUC is 
not expected to cause a reduction in the therapeutic efficacy. However  Cmax increases by 15-23%. The 
consequences of these changes are not considered to be clinically meaningful;  Since there is a clear 
relationship between Cmax and dose related adverse reactions, it is recommended to take therefore, 
Fampyra can be taken with or without food (see section 4.2).

5.  Request for supplementary information 
5.1.  Other concerns 
Clinical aspects 
1.  Responders  to  fampridine  may  be  more  sensitive  for  adverse  events  related  the  pharmacodynamics 
of  fampridine  (e.g.  overstimulation).  These  signals  may  be  masked  in  the  overall  safety  analysis 
including  both  responder  and  non-responders.  A  separate  safety  analysis  for  non-responders  and 
responders is requested.  
2.  The  MAH  should  discuss  and  propose  a  strategy  to  follow-up  and  investigate  the  effects  in  patients 
that  need  to  terminate  treatment  with  Fampyra.  Currently  available  data  seem  to  suggest  that  a 
rebound  phenomenon  may  occur  in  such  cases,  and  it  would  be  interesting  to  know  whether  the 
patients  return  to  a  level  of  functioning  similar  to  the  one  before  treatment,  or  if  they  experience 
effects of worsening. 
RMP aspects 
3.  Please  include  only  a  brief  summary  of  the  SmPC  text  in  the  summary  table  of  risk  minimisation 
measures, instead of the exact wording, in order to avoid unnecessary updates of the RMP.

1.  Responders  to  fampridine  may  be  more  sensitive  for  adverse  events  related  the  pharmacodynamics 
of  fampridine  (e.g.  overstimulation).  These  signals  may  be  masked  in  the  overall  safety  analysis 
including  both  responder  and  non-responders.  A  separate  safety  analysis  for  non-responders  and 
responders is requested.

Summary of the MAH’s response 
The safety results in this response are presented for the intent-to-treat population in the  ENHANCE study  
excluding  patients  at  the  one  site  that  closed  due  to  GCP  issues.  Two  patients  (1  in  each  treatment 
group) from the original safety population have been excluded as it was  not possible to determine their 
responder status. These two patients did not report any adverse events. 
Overview of Adverse Events 
The  incidence  of  AEs  reported  in  Study  305  was  similar  between  the  3  groups  (63%  fampridine 
responder, 68% fampridine non-responder and 60% placebo. Most subjects had AEs that were considered 
mild  or  moderate  in  severity,  and  the  incidence  of  AEs  that  were  considered  severe  was  1%  in  the 
responder group compared to 4% in the non-responder group and 3% in placebo  
The  incidence  of  AEs  considered  by  the  Investigator  to  be  related  to  study  treatment  was  higher  in 
fampridine  responders  than  the  non-responders  or  placebo-treated  subjects  (21%  vs.  15%  vs.  14%). 
Apart from one patient in the placebo group none of these related AEs were considered serious. 
SAEs  also  occurred  at  a  similar  incidence  (7%  vs.  8%  vs.  7%).  The  incidence  of  AEs  leading  to  dose 
interruption  was  slightly  higher  for  fampridine-treated  subjects than  for  those  treated  with  placebo  (7% 
vs.  6%  vs.  3%).  The  incidence  of  AEs  leading  to  study  treatment  discontinuation  (7%  each  group)  or 
withdrawal from the study (7% vs. 7% vs 8%) was also balanced.

Common Adverse Events 
The most common System Order Classes (SOCs) for reported AEs were infections and  infestations (27% 
vs.  34%  vs.  28%),  nervous  system  disorders  (25%  vs.  29%  vs.  21%),  and  musculoskeletal  and 
connective tissue disorders (18% vs. 17% vs. 14%)

The  most  common  AEs  (incidence  ≥3%)  among  nervous  system  disorders  were  Multiple  Sclerosis  (MS) 
relapse, headache, and dizziness, with all of these occurring more commonly in the non-responder group 
than responder. Balance disorder occurred more commonly in the responder group. 
The  most  common  AEs  among  musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders  were  back  pain, 
arthralgia,  and  pain  in  extremity,  with  all  of  these  occurring  slightly  more  frequently  in  the  responder 
group compared to non-responder. 
There were more AEs reported in the Psychiatric Disorders SOC by responders (11% vs. 4% vs. 3%) and 
this was mostly due to Insomnia (7% vs. 2% vs. <1%).  
There  were  also  more  AEs  reported by  responders in  the  Renal  and  Urinary  Disorders  SOC  (9%  vs.  3% 
vs. 2%). No single Preferred Term (PT) or medical condition accounted for this difference. 
The  most  frequently  reported  AEs  by  PT  in  both  treatment  groups  were  MS  relapse  (9%  vs.  12%  vs. 
10%) and urinary tract infection (11% vs. 15% vs. 9%), consistent with the MS study population.

All AEs that occurred during Study 305 were assessed by Investigators as related or not related to study 
treatment.  Of  the  patients  reporting  AEs  in  all  groups  most  experienced  AEs which  were  considered  not 
related to study treatment (41% vs. 53% vs. 46%)  
The  proportion  of  patients  who  experienced  AEs  considered  related  to  study  treatment  was  21%  in  the 
responder group as compared with 15 % in the non-responders and 14% in the placebo. 
Serious Adverse Events 
In  Study  305,  the  incidence  of  SAEs  was  comparable  between  all  3  groups  (7%  vs.  8%  vs.  7%).  MS 
relapse was the most frequently reported SAE in all groups with fewest in the responder group (2% vs. 
6% vs. 3% in placebo). 
Adverse Events That Led to Discontinuation of Study Treatment or Study Withdrawal 
The  incidence  of  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  study  treatment  or  study  withdrawal  was  comparable 
between the 3 groups (7% vs. 7% vs. 8%)   MS relapse and MS led to  discontinuation or withdrawal in 5 
subjects in the non-responder group and 1 in the placebo and 0 in the responder. 
Adverse Events That Led to Dose Interruption 
The  incidence  of  AEs  leading  to  dose  interruption  was  7%  (9  subjects),  6%  (10  subjects)  and  3%  (11 
subjects) in the responder, non-responder and placebo groups, respectively  
Adverse events of possible overstimulation 
The  following  list  of  PTs  was  provided  by  the  Assessor  as  examples  of  AEs  suggesting  overstimulation 
which  may  be  observed  as  a  pharmacological  effect  in  the  fampridine  responder  group:  Asthenia,  Gait 
disturbance, Muscular weakness, Fatigue, Muscle spasticity, Muscle spasms and Trigeminal neuralgia. The 
MAH  has  included  additional  terms  which  have  been  included  in  the  Progress  Reports  for  the  LIBERATE 
study  (218MS401)  (Fall,  Insomnia,  Balance  disorder,  Dizziness,  Tremor,  Sleep  disorder,  Anxiety, 
Irritability, Dysaesthesia, Neuralgia, Paraesthesia and Sensory disturbance). 
Table 1 shows the number of patients in each group who experienced events which may suggest Central  
Nervous System (CNS) overstimulation (24% vs. 23% vs. 18%). There are similar proportions in each of 
the fampridine groups. The most commonly reported events were fall (9% vs. 7% vs. 6%) and insomnia 
(7%  vs.  2%  vs.  <1%),  both  of  which  occurred  more  frequently  in  the  responder  group.  There  were 
proportionally  fewer  reports  of  dizziness,  fatigue,  muscle  spasm  and  spasticity,  anxiety,  paraesthesia, 
sensory  disturbance  and  trigeminal  neuralgia in  the  responder  group  compared  with the  non-responder. 
Overall  there  is  no  indication  that  the  responder  group  is  at  more  risk  of  events  related  to  potential 
overstimulation compared to the  non-responder or placebo groups.

Cardiovascular Disorders 
AEs  using  the  predefined  classification  of  events  related  to  dysrhythmias  were  reported  for  4  subjects 
(3%) in the responder group, 2 subjects (1%) in the non-responders and 2 subjects (<1%) treated with 
placebo.  The  events  included  palpitations  (2  subjects,  responders  vs.  2  subjects,  non-responders  vs.  1 
subject,  placebo),  tachycardia  (2  subjects,  responder),  bundle  branch  block  right  (1  subject,  non-
responder), and arrhythmia (1 subject, placebo).  
Summary / Conclusion 
The  incidence  and  severity  of  AEs  in  the  two  fampridine  groups,  responder  and  non-responder,  are  well 
balanced and both consistent with the established safety profile of fampridine. There is no indication that 
the  fampridine  responder  group  had  a  higher  incidence  of  AEs  related  to  the  pharmacodynamics  of 
fampridine (e.g. overstimulation). 
There were occasional differences between the fampridine responder and non-responder groups in some 
cases of individual AEs. The incidence of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), AEs leading to dose interruption 
or discontinuation and AE severity are similar and compatible with the known safety profile of fampridine 
and do not represent any new safety findings.  
The  analysis  of  the  safety  data  for  the  patients  receiving  fampridine  by  responder  and  non-responder 
groups  supports  the  overall  established  safety  of  fampridine  as  observed  in  clinical  trials  and  post-
marketing  use.  The  numbers  in  the  two  groups  are  relatively  small  (136  responders  and  179  non-

responders),  however,  the  safety  profile  in  the  two  groups  appears  to  be  well  balanced  with  no  new 
safety issues identified.  
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The conclusion of the Applicant that the data do not support the  concern that responders may be at an 
increased risk of adverse events related to the pharmacological activity of fampridine (overstimulation)  is 
endorsed  based  on  the  data  provided.  There  is  no  large  difference  of  these  events  between  responders 
and non-responders (see table 1). Moreover, there is no consistent pattern.  
Issue resolved 
2.  The  MAH  should  discuss  and  propose  a  strategy  to  follow-up  and  investigate  the  effects  in  patients 
that  need  to  terminate  treatment  with  Fampyra.  Currently  available  data  seem  to  suggest  that  a 
rebound  phenomenon  may  occur  in  such  cases,  and  it  would  be  interesting  to  know  whether  the 
patients  return  to  a  level  of  functioning  similar  to  the  one  before  treatment,  or  if  they  experience 
effects of worsening. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The  MAH  believes  that  effects  of  fampridine  treatment  discontinuation  have  been  well  characterized 
across  pivotal  studies  and  that  there  is  currently  no  evidence  to  support  that  patients  exposed  to 
fampridine  experience  worsening  of  function  upon  treatment  interruption.  The  following  results 
corroborate this observation. 
Study MS-F203 and Study MS-F204 
The effect of fampridine treatment discontinuation was evaluated during a pre-specified off treatment 
follow-up  visit  in  studies  MS-F203  and  MS-F204.  This  was  further  complemented  by  an  evaluation  of 
treatment re-initiation effects in patients who chose to participate in phase III extension studies.  
In  both  MS-F203  and  MS-F204,  a  rapid  loss  of  treatment  effect  but  not  worsening  was  observed  after 
fampridine  discontinuation.  On  average,  patients  assigned  to  fampridine  in  the  blinded  phase  of  these 
studies  experienced  a  return  to  baseline  T25FW  walking  speed  values,  which  was  later  reversed  in 
patients  who  re-initiated  treatment  as  part  of  their  participation  in  the  open-label  extension  phase  of 
these studies (Goodman et al., 2015) 
Study 218MS305 
Fampridine discontinuation effects were also assessed in Study 218MS305 during a post treatment follow-
up visit two weeks after study treatment was completed.  The change from baseline MSWS-12 to 2 week 
off  treatment  follow-up  was  -2.61  (95%  CI:  -4.86,  -0.36).  These  results  suggest  that,  on  a   population 
level, fampridine treated patients had a tendency to experience marginal improvements in their reported 
walking function scores after being exposed to treatment when compared to pre-treatment values. 
To further clarify if this analysis on the Intent to Treat (ITT) population could have masked worsening in 
some  subjects,  MSWS-12  score  changes  were  also  separated  into  categories  of  change.  Patients  who 
reported  worse  scores  as  compared  to  baseline  were  then  evaluated  for  the  magnitude  of  their  change 
and  its  comparison  to  placebo.  Overall,  the  proportion  of  fampridine  treated  patients  experiencing  a 
worsening in their MSWS-12 scores at off treatment follow up visit was similar to placebo (49% and 46%, 
respectively).  Likewise,  measures  of  statistical  dispersion  of  the  magnitude  of  increase  in  MSWS-12 
Assessment report  
EMA/305262/2017 
Page 57/64 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
scores was comparable between fampridine treated patients and placebo with mean, median and quartile 
score changes slightly favoring fampridine as compared to placebo. 
For  changes  in  TUG  speed  similar  results  are  noted.    Although  placebo  treated  patients  also  had  an 
increase in TUG speed at follow-up visit, most fampridine treated patients showed improvements in TUG 
speed with mean percentage increases of 5.86% (95% CI: 2.80, 8.92) at follow up visit when compared 
to  baseline.  When  further  separating  patients  by  categories  of  change,  comparable  proportions  of 
fampridine treated patients and placebo experienced decrease in TUG speed at study completion (35% vs 
39%, respectively). Furthermore, measures of statistical dispersion of the magnitude of decrease in TUG 
speed  in  this  category  of  patients  demonstrated  that  test  performance  declined  in  a  similar    manner  in 
fampridine and placebo patients, hence suggesting that the observed worsening of function is likely to be 
disease related rather than treatment related.  
Finally,  we  note  that  there  were  no  serious  falls  or  other  related  SAEs  reported  in  fampridine  treated 
subjects during the washout period.  
Conclusion 
In summary, the MAH believes that effects of treatment discontinuation were adequately studied during 
the fampridine clinical development program. Results obtained from three distinct phase III clinical trials 
using  objective  and  patient  reported  outcome  measures  were  consistent  in  demonstrating  that  patients 
returned  to  pre-treatment  levels  of  functioning  when  discontinued  from  treatment.  While  some  patients 
reported  a  worsening  compared  to  baseline,  the  proportion  was  nearly  identical  in  the  placebo  group. 
Consequently, the MAH believes that further investigation on the possibility for a rebound phenomenon is 
not warranted at this time.  
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The conclusion of the Applicant that the data do not support the possibility for a rebound phenomenon is 
not  completely  agreed.  The  long  term  extension  study  (MS-F203  &  MS-F204)  did  not  specific  address 
rebound.  The  MSWQ12  may  not  be  sensitive  to  pick  up  rebound  although  it  may  be  argued  that  if  the 
MSWQ12 does not this up it of limited clinical relevance.  
Nevertheless the data presented appear compatible with this view that rebound is not an issue although 
based on circumstantial evidence.

Section 4.2 Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with Fampyra is restricted to prescription and supervision by 
physicians experienced in the management of MS. 
The recommended dose is one 10 mg tablet, twice daily, taken 12 hours 
apart.(one 1 tablet in the morning and one1 tablet in the evening). 
Fampyra should not be administered more frequently or at higher doses 
than recommended(see section 4.4).  The tablets shouldcan be taken with 
orwithout food (see section 5.2) 
Initial prescription should be limited to 2 to 4 weeks of therapy as clinical 
benefits should generally be identified within 2-to 4weeks after starting 
Fampyra 
A timed an assessment ofwalking testability, e.g. the Timed 25 Foot 
Walk (T25FW),or MSWS 12, is recommended to evaluate improvement 
after two weekswithin 2 to 4 weeks.  If no improvement is observed, 
Fampyra should be discontinued  
Fampyra should be discontinued if benefit is not reported by patients. 
If decline in walking ability is observed physicians should consider an 
interruption to treatment in order to reassess the benefits of Fampyra (see 
above).  The re-evaluation should include withdrawal of Fampyra and 
performing the an assessment pofwalking testability. Fampyra should be 
discontinued if patients no longer receive walking benefit.  
The usual dosing regime regimenshould always be followed.  A double 
dose should not be taken if a dose is missed.

Symptoms  
Symptoms of  
Acute symptoms of overdose with Fampyra include:  were consistents 
with central nervous system excitation and included confusion, 
tremulousness, diaphoresis, seizure, and amnesia.  
Central nervous system side effects at high doses of 4-aminopyridine 
APinclude confusion, seizures, status epilepticus, involuntary and 
choreoathetoid movements.  
Management 
Patients who overdose should be provided supportive care.  Repeated 
seizure activity should be treated with benzodiazepine, phenytoin, or 
other appropriate acute anti-seizure therapy.

Packaging: 
Blister packaging with calendar and design elements to reinforce the 
required posology of twice daily dosing spaced by 12 hours.  This helps 
to minimize the risk associated with high plasma levels if the twice daily 
dosing are not spaced adequately, which may increase the risk of seizure. 
A ‘starter pack’ for the initial prescriptions will limit to 2 
weeks of medication to reinforce the section 4.2 posology of the 
SmPC that benefit of treatment should be evaluated after 2 
weeks and only to be continued in patients responding to 
fampridine and thereby improving benefit/risk in those

Determining renal function before treatment and its regular monitoring 
during treatment is recommended in all patients (particularly the 
elderlyin older people in whom renal function might be reduced).  
Creatinine clearance can be estimated using the Cockroft-Gault formula. 
Fampyra should not be administered to patients with renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance <80 mlmL/min) (see section 4.3). 
Caution is required when Fampyra is prescribed concurrently with 
medicinal products that are substrates of OCT2 for example, carvedilol, 
propanolol, and metformin. 
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of 
interaction 
Fampridine is eliminated mainly via the kidneys with active renal 
secretion accounting for about 60% (see section 5.2). OCT2 is the 
transporter responsible for the active secretion of fampridine.  Thus, the 
concomitant use of fampridine with medicinal products that are inhibitors 
of OCT2 for example, cimetidine are contraindicated (see section 4.3) 
and concomitant use of fampridine with medicinal products that are 
substrates of OCT2 for example, carvedilol, propanolol, and metformin is 
cautioned (see section 4.4.) 
Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties 
Fampridine is eliminated primarily by the kidneys as unchanged 
medicinal product and therefore renal function should be checked in 
patients where renal function might be compromised.  Elimination 
The major route of elimination for fampridine is renal excretion, with 
approximately 90% of the dose recovered in urine as parent medicinal 
product within 24 hours.  Renal clearance (CLR 370 ml mL/min) is 
substantially greater than glomerular filtration rate due to combined 
glomerular filtration and active excretion by the renal OCT2 transporter.  
Faecal excretion accounts for less than 1% of the administered dose. 
Fampyra is characterized by linear (dose-proportional) 
pharmacokineticsPKs with a terminal elimination half-life of 
approximately 6 hours. The maximum plasma concentration ( The 
C max) and, to a smaller extent, area under the plasma concentration-
time curve (AUC) increase proportionately with dose.  There is no 
evidence of clinically relevant accumulation of fampridine taken at the 
recommended dose in patients with full renal function.  In patients with 
renal impairment accumulation occurs relative to the degree of 
impairment. 
Patients with renal impairment: 
Fampridine is eliminated primarily by the kidneys as unchanged 
medicinal product and therefore renal function should be checked in 
patients where renal function might be compromised.  Patients with mild 
renal impairment can be expected to have approximately 1.7 to 1.9 times 
the fampridine concentrations achieved by patients with normal renal 
function.  Fampyra must not be administered to patients with mild, 
moderate and severe renal impairment (see section 4.3).

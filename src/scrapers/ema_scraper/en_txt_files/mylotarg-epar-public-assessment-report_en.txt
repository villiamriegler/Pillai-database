1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Pfizer Limited submitted on 1 December 2016 an application for marketing authorisation to 
the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Mylotarg, through the centralised procedure falling within the 
Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised 
procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 26 March 2015.  
Mylotarg was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/00/005 on 18 October 2000 in the 
following condition: treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: for combination therapy with daunorubicin (DNR) and 
cytarabine (AraC) for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated, de novo acute myeloid 
leukaemia (AML). 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal 
Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Mylotarg as an orphan medicinal product in the approved 
indication. More information on the COMP’s review can be found in the Orphan maintenance assessment 
report published under the ‘Assessment history’ tab on the Agency’s website: ema.europa.eu/Find 
medicine/Human medicines/European public assessment reports.  
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated that 
gemtuzumab ozogamicin was considered to be a new active substance. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical 
and clinical data based on applicant’s own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0078/2016 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0078/2016 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Mylotarg is intended for the treatment of adolescents aged 15 to 17 years and adult patients with 
previously untreated, de novo CD33-positive acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), except acute promyelocytic 
leukaemia (APL), in combination therapy with daunorubicin (DNR) and cytarabine (AraC). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
In Europe, the annual incidence of AML in adults is 5 to 8 cases per 100.000 individuals with a mortality 
rate of 4 to 6 cases per 100.000. (1) The median age at diagnosis is 67 years, but the incidence increases 
by age with a projected incidence of 15 to 25 cases per 100.000 in patients who are 70 years of age or 
older. (2) (3) 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Acute myeloid leukaemia is a form of leukaemia, characterised by infiltration of proliferative, clonal, 
abnormally differentiated, and occasionally poorly differentiated haematopoietic cells of myeloid lineage 
in the bone marrow, blood, and other tissues.  
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
AML is a heterogeneous disease; the classification is based on morphologic, cytogenetic, molecular, and 
immunophenotypic features, which, along with baseline patient characteristics such as age and 
performance status (PS), influence outcome and treatment recommendations (4). Among these, baseline 
cytogenetic risk constitutes one of the most significant prognostic markers of disease outcome (5). Age is 
the most prominent patient-specific risk factor, and cytogenetics the most disease-specific risk factor. 
In AML, leukaemic blasts replace normal blood cells in bone marrow and peripheral blood, which leads to 
anaemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. This is associated with symptoms of fatigue, shortness of 
breath, disturbed wound healing, infections and bleedings. If left untreated, AML results in death within a 
few weeks to months. 
Long-term survival in adult patients with AML is only 35% to 40% for patients ≤60 years of age, and 
drops to 5% to 15% in patients who are >60 years of age. (6) The majority of patients with AML will have 
relapsed disease within 3 years. (7) 
2.1.5.  Management 
The general therapeutic strategy in patients with AML has not changed substantially in more than 30 
years. The standard regimen ‘‘3+7’’, established in 1973, consisted of 3 consecutive daily infusions of 
DNR and 7 days of continuous infusion of AraC.  
Assessment report  
EMA/155284/2018  
Page 9/138 
 
 
 
 
 
The standard treatment has for many years consisted of an induction treatment in order to achieve 
complete remission (CR). When CR has been obtained, 2 courses of consolidation therapy usually are 
performed, in order to eliminate undetected residual disease. Patient who do not achieve CR after the 
induction have a poor prognosis. Although some patients older than 60 years, with ECOG PS 0 to 2 and 
minimal comorbidity may benefit from standard 3+7, the therapeutic options for patients with poor 
functional status or comorbidities often include low intensity therapy such as subcutaneous AraC, 
azacitidine, or decitabine. The majority of patients with AML whether in CR after consolidation therapy or 
not, will have relapsed disease within 3 years. Achievements in the treatment of AML have mainly focused 
on younger patients. The introduction of allogeneic stem cell transplantation has improved the outcome 
in selected patient groups, especially those with intermediate and high risk disease with 3 years LFS of 
60%. However patients who are not in remission at the time of transplantation have a dismal prognosis. 
It is of clinical benefit, that patients achieve CR are risk stratified in order to select those patients that 
might benefit from an HSCT.  
In the EU (European Union), recently approved agents include decitabine (Dacogen) which is authorised 
for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed de novo or secondary AML, according to the 
World Health Organisation (WHO) classification, who are not candidates for standard induction 
chemotherapy. Azacitidine (Vidaza) is also authorised for the treatment of adult patients Vidaza is 
indicated for the treatment of adult patients who are not eligible for haematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (HSCT) with AML with 20-30 % blasts and multi-lineage dysplasia, according to WHO 
classification and AML with >30% marrow blasts according to the WHO classification. In addition, 
histamine dihydrochloride (Ceplene) is authorised for adult patients with AML in first remission 
concomitantly treated with interleukin-2 (IL-2). Finally, midostaurin (Rydapt) is authorised in 
combination with standard daunorubicin and cytarabine induction and high dose cytarabine consolidation 
chemotherapy followed by midostaurin single agent maintenance therapy for adult patients with newly 
diagnosed AML who are FLT3 mutation positive. 
Still new therapeutic options that could improve survival of patients, and prevent or delay relapse of the 
disease remain an important unmet medical need for patients with previously untreated de novo AML.    
About the product 
Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is a CD33-directed ADC. Gemtuzumab is a humanised immunoglobulin class G 
subtype 4 (IgG4) antibody which specifically recognises human CD33. The antibody portion binds 
specifically to the CD33 antigen, a sialic acid-dependent adhesion protein found on the surface of myeloid 
leukaemic blasts and immature normal cells of myelomonocytic lineage, but not on normal 
haematopoietic stem cells. The small molecule, N acetyl gamma calicheamicin, is a cytotoxic 
semisynthetic natural product. N acetyl gamma calicheamicin is covalently attached to the antibody via 
an AcBut (4-(4-acetylphenoxy) butanoic acid) linker. Non-clinical data suggest that the anticancer 
activity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin is due to the binding of the ADC to CD33-expressing tumour cells, 
followed by internalisation of the ADC CD33 complex, and the intracellular release of N acetyl gamma 
calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide via hydrolytic cleavage of the linker. Activation of N acetyl gamma 
calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide induces double stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) breaks, 
subsequently inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death. (SmPC, section 5.1). 
The applicant requested the approval for the following indication: 
Mylotarg is a CD33-directed antibody-drug conjugate indicated for combination therapy with 
daunorubicin (DNR) and cytarabine (AraC) for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated, 
de novo acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). 
Assessment report  
EMA/155284/2018  
Page 10/138 
 
 
 
 
 
The final indications following CHMP review of this application is: 
MYLOTARG is indicated for combination therapy with daunorubicin (DNR) and cytarabine (AraC) for the 
treatment of patients age 15 years and above with previously untreated, de novo CD33-positive acute 
myeloid leukaemia (AML), except acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) (SmPC, section 4.1). 
For the induction phase, the recommended dose of Mylotarg is 3 mg/m2/dose (up to a maximum of one 
5 mg vial) infused over a 2 hour period on Days 1, 4, and 7 in combination with DNR 60 mg/m2/day 
infused over 30 minutes on Day 1 to Day 3, and AraC 200 mg/m2/day by continuous infusion on Day 1 to 
Day 7. Mylotarg should not be administered during second induction therapy (SmPC, section 4.2). 
For the consolidation phase, for patients experiencing a complete remission (CR) following induction, 
defined as fewer than 5% blasts in a normocellular marrow and an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 
more than 1.0 × 109 cells/L with a platelet count of 100 × 109/L or more in the peripheral blood in the 
absence of transfusion, up to 2 consolidation courses of intravenous DNR (60 mg/m2 for 1 day [first 
course] or 2 days [second course]) in combination with intravenous AraC (1,000 mg/m2 per 12 hours, 
infused over 2 hours on Day 1 to Day 4) with intravenous Mylotarg (3 mg/m2/dose infused over 2 hours 
up to a maximum dose of one 5 mg vial on Day 1) are recommended (SmPC, section 4.2). 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The applicant had CHMP Scientific Advice in February 2016 (EMEA/H/SA/3285/1/2016/PA/I) on the 
proposed data package to demonstrate acceptable product quality in relation to the amino acid 
substitution (AAS) in the antibody portion of the drug substance..  The applicant had no CHMP Scientific 
Advice regarding the clinical development. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as powder for concentrate for solution for infusion containing 5 mg of 
gemtuzumab ozogamicin as active substance. After reconstitution, the solution contains 1 mg 
gemtuzumab ozogamicin per mL. Other ingredients are: dextran 40, sucrose, sodium chloride, sodium 
dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate and disodium hydrogen phosphate anhydrous. The product is 
available in an amber Type 1 glass vial, with butyl rubber stopper and crimp seal with flip-off cap.  
Although this dossier is not considered a Quality by Design application, certain elements of an enhanced 
approached were applied as described in the relevant sections below. 
Mylotarg (gemtuzumab ozogamicin) has been in commercial production and on the market in the US from 
2000-2010 and again in 2017, and in Japan since 2005. The current application is a re-submission. In 
2007, the CHMP considered that the Quality package for Mylotarg was generally acceptable. During 
development, a significant level of amino acid substitution (AAS) was discovered at multiple sites within 
the antibody part of the active substance. The root cause of the AAS was identified. Primarily based on the 
AAS observed, several major deficiencies, two joint with clinical, were identified in the initial quality 
package submitted in support of the marketing authorisation application (MAA). None of the clinical 
studies supporting the current MAA used exclusively elevated AAS gemtuzumab batches, and as such do 
not fully represent the proposed commercial product. During the review, the applicant has provided 
additional data confirming the comparability of the clinical material with the proposed commercial

material in regards to the amino acid substitution in the antibody portion of the drug substance. The 
control strategy has also been reviewed to ensure a consistent product. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg) is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) of humanized CD33-directed 
monoclonal IgG4 antibody covalently bonded to the activated calicheamicin derivative, a semi-synthetic 
derivative of gamma calicheamicin.  
Gemtuzumab was selected to target CD33 expressed on the majority of leukemic cells from patients with 
acute myeloid leukemia (AML); it has an average theoretical molecular mass of 148 KDaltons. 
Calicheamicin is a potent cytotoxin that, once conjugated to the anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody, allows 
target directed therapy. The calicheamicin is bound to the antibody via a linker which forms an amide 
bond with the antibody and forms a disulfide bond with the calicheamicin. The linker also contains an 
internal hydrazone bond, which is acid-labile.  
The structure of the active substance is provided in Figure 1.

Intermediate activated calicheamicin 
General Information (Intermediate activated calicheamicin) 
The chemical structure of activated calicheamicin was elucidated by a combination of infrared radiation 
(IR), ultraviolet (UV), mass spectrometry (MS), and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). 
The results demonstrate that the activated calicheamicin derivative has the expected structure.  
The activated calicheamicin derivative is a white to off white powder, amorphous solid, exhibits no 
crystalline properties, is hygroscopic and is not soluble in water or aqueous solutions.  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls (Intermediate activated 
calicheamicin) 
Starting from a working cell bank, fermentation of M. echinospora strain produces γ-calicheamicin. The 
γ-calicheamicin solution is used to produce N-acetyl calicheamicin. Lastly, the activated linker is added to 
N-acetyl calicheamicin to produce activated calicheamicin derivative.  
The activated calicheamicin intermediate is transferred into glass bottles prior to drying and subsequent 
storage at the recommended storage temperature.  
Control of Materials (Intermediate activated calicheamicin) 
Sufficient information on raw materials used in the intermediate activated calicheamicin manufacturing 
process has been submitted.   Sufficient information is provided regarding the cell bank system Master 
Cell Bank (MCB) and Working Cell Bank (WCB) and its testing. The banks are monitored according to a 
pre-approved stability protocol.

A comprehensive overview of critical in-process controls and critical in-process tests performed 
throughout the manufacturing process of the activated calicheamicin derivative, including its purification 
and isolation, is given. Acceptable information has been provided on the control system in place to 
monitor and control the active substance manufacturing process with regard to critical, as well as 
non-critical operational parameters and in-process tests.  
Process validation (Intermediate activated calicheamicin) 
The intermediate activated calicheamicin manufacturing process has been validated adequately. 
Consistency in production has been shown. All acceptance criteria for the critical operational parameters 
and likewise acceptance criteria for the in-process tests are fulfilled demonstrating that the purification 
process consistently produces intermediate activated calicheamicin of reproducible quality that complies 
with the predetermined specification and in-process acceptance criteria. 
Characterisation (Intermediate activated calicheamicin) 
The structure and characteristics of the activated calicheamicin derivative have been determined using 
several physico-chemical analyses. Full characterisation by IR, UV, MS, NMR has been carried out. The 
results demonstrate that the activated calicheamicin derivative has the expected structure.

A reference standard has been established for activated calicheamicin derivative. 
Stability (Intermediate activated calicheamicin) 
The stability results under long term and accelerated conditions have been provided indicating that the 
intermediate activated calicheamicin is sufficiently stable and justify the proposed retest period in the 
proposed container. 
Intermediate gemtuzumab 
General Information (Intermediate gemtuzumab) 
Gemtuzumab (KD1, hP67.6 antibody) is an engineered monoclonal antibody (mAb) and consists of a 
human IgG4 kappa framework with putative complementarity determining region (CDR) grafted mouse 
sequences, which form the antigen-binding site. The theoretical molecular masses (average) for the 
predominant N-linked glycoforms, assuming C-terminal G residues in both H chains, and full disulfide 
bond connectivity, is 148 KDaltons. The sites of AAS are located in both light and heavy chains including 
the CDR.   
Description of manufacturing process and process controls (Intermediate gemtuzumab) 
The gemtuzumab intermediate manufacturing process has been adequately described. Main steps are 
fermentation, recovery and purification. 
The manufacturing process for gemtuzumab uses a recombinant NS0 mouse myeloma cell line that 
contains the DNA encoding the sequence for gemtuzumab. Cells from the WCB are thawed, and the 
culture is progressively expanded into a production bioreactor. The production bioreactor culture is 
harvested removing cells and debris, concentrated and filtered. Following harvest, the product is 
processed by chromatographic and viral inactivation steps into containers and stored under appropriate 
conditions. The container closure system components comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 
10/2011 as amended. 
Control of materials (Intermediate gemtuzumab) 
Sufficient information on raw materials used in the intermediate gemtuzumab manufacturing process, 
including the composition of the cell culture media, has been submitted. Compendial raw materials are 
tested in accordance with the corresponding monograph, while specifications (including test methods) for 
non-compendial raw materials are presented. The history and details of cell line establishment are given. 
The applicant has provided a thorough risk assessment and conducts viral testing in support of both the 
BSE/TSE and the viral safety of gemtuzumab, which is found acceptable.

A full genotypic characterisation of the MCB, WCB and EOP cells, under current manufacturing process 
conditions at commercial scale, has been provided. All results are deemed satisfactory. Testing and 
control of starting/raw materials as well as introducing new in process controls have been included in the 
control strategy, which is now satisfactory. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates (Intermediate gemtuzumab) 
A comprehensive overview of the control strategy performed throughout the gemtuzumab intermediate 
manufacturing process is given. Acceptable information has been provided on the control system. The 
intermediate gemtuzumab manufacturing process is considered acceptable.  
Process validation (Intermediate gemtuzumab) 
The intermediate gemtuzumab manufacturing process is now considered as validated adequately. 
Validation data from fermentation and purification batches were presented. Data from these studies were 
in compliance.  
It is concluded that the process consistently produces intermediate gemtuzumab of reproducible quality 
that complies with the predetermined specification and in-process acceptance criteria. 
Characterisation (Intermediate gemtuzumab) 
In the original submission, characterisation data, primarily from one single reference batch of 
gemtuzumab reference materials from the commercial process, was provided. However, since this batch 
represented only the post-AAS batches, it was not considered as representative of all the intermediate 
gemtuzumab used for the clinical material; a major objection was raised. As a result substantial additional 
characterisation data have been provided. No new sites of calicheamicin were found to have been 
introduced in the shifted batches. Glycosylation was also demonstrated comparable in pre and post-shit 
batches. Effector functions are not part of the mechanism of action. The applicant has demonstrated that 
gemtuzumab  does not have Antibody-Dependent Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity, and Complement 
Dependent Cytotoxicity activity.   
Comparable cytotoxicity was initially demonstrated for two lots that spanned the AAS levels.  During the 
procedure, data on binding to the CD33 target and FcRn were provided supporting the conclusion that the 
AAS has not had any effect on the affinity of gemtuzumab to CD33 or FcRn. The applicant has been 
recommended to conduct full characterisation of the AAS for an agreed number of gemtuzumab batches 
manufactured. Should an update of the test for Amino Acid Substitution be needed, this should be applied 
for in a variation application. In any case (if no need for update of the specification is identified), the data 
from full characterisation of the AAS sites should be provided to the Agency and Rapporteur. 
Specification (Intermediate gemtuzumab) 
The specification which are based on clinical and comparability data, are accepted.  
Analytical methods (Intermediate gemtuzumab) 
Validation reports and transfer reports for the gemtuzumab analytical procedures have been submitted 
and are satisfactory.  
Batch analysis (Intermediate gemtuzumab) 
Batch analysis data used for non-clinical, clinical, stability, process validations, and filling reference 
material have been provided. All batches met the specifications at the time of release.

Reference materials (Intermediate gemtuzumab) 
For reference standards used throughout gemtuzumab development, the data from extended 
characterisation tests have been provided.  The data shown confirm the suitability of the reference 
materials. 
Stability (Intermediate gemtuzumab) 
The stability results indicate that the intermediate gemtuzumab is sufficiently stable and justify the 
proposed shelf life in the proposed container. 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation (Gemtuzumab 
ozogamicin) 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The gemtuzumab ozogamicin active substance manufacturing process has been adequately described. 
The main steps are conjugation of two active substance intermediates, activated calicheamicin derivative 
and gemtuzumab antibody, and purification. A solution of activated calicheamicin derivative is combined 
with a solution of gemtuzumab in a reactor. The conjugated material is purified. The purified conjugate is 
combined with excipients, filtered, and stored. The process parameters and the controls are described for 
each step. The active substance manufacturing process is considered acceptable. The unique batch 
number allows traceability of all materials associated with the batch. 
The  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  active  substance  is  filled  in  sterile  bags,  compliant  with  European 
Pharmacopoeia  (Ph.  Eur.)  and  food  contact  legislation  (EC  Regulation  No  1183/2012  replacing  No 
10/2011).  Extractable  and  leachables  evaluation  is  satisfactory.  The  active  substance  is  stored  at 
appropriate storage conditions. 
Control of materials 
Sufficient information on raw materials used in the active substance manufacturing process has been 
submitted. Compendial raw materials are tested in accordance with the corresponding monograph, while 
specifications (including test methods) for non-compendial raw materials are presented. A statement 
confirms that the active substance is in compliance with the “Note for guidance on minimizing the risk of 
transmitting animal spongiform encephalopathy agents via human and veterinary medicinal products” 
(EMA/410/01 rev.3).  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
A comprehensive overview of critical in-process controls and critical in-process tests performed 
throughout the gemtuzumab ozogamicin active substance manufacturing process is now given. 
Acceptable information has been provided on the control system in place to monitor and control the active 
substance manufacturing process with regard to critical, as well as non-critical operational parameters 
and in-process tests. The control strategy is consistent with the principles outlined in ICH Q9, Q10 and 
Q11. The description of the control strategy in place for the active substance is generally acceptable. 
Process validation 
The gemtuzumab ozogamicin active substance manufacturing process is considered as validated 
adequately.  
Assessment report  
EMA/155284/2018  
Page 16/138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Characterisation 
Gemtuzumab ozogamicin has been sufficiently characterised by physicochemical and biological 
state-of-the-art methods revealing that the active substance has the expected structure of an antibody 
drug conjugate molecule presenting both the antibody (gemtuzumab) and the ozogamicin components. 
Furthermore, post-translational modifications, charge and size heterogeneity, conjugation sites, extent of 
calicheamicin derivative conjugation, higher order structure, and biological activity have been adequately 
characterised, confirming the primary structure and expected cytotoxicity. The analytical results are 
consistent with the proposed structure. In summary, the characterization is considered appropriate for 
this type of molecule. 
A discussion of the impact of AAS on the active substance characterisation has been provided during the 
review. The AAS in gemtuzumab does not overly affect the characterization of gemtuzumab ozogamicin.  
Comparability in the gemtuzumab intermediate, active substance and finished product was 
demonstrated. In addition, side-by-side characterization using an array of analytical methods 
demonstrates comparability in primary structure, post-translational modifications, and higher-order 
structure among gemtuzumab ozogamicin batches that vary in the level of amino acid substitutions. 
Furthermore, side-by-side data to evaluate the sites of conjugation and the higher order structure of 
these entities of gemtuzumab and gemtuzumab ozogamicin refrigerated active substance and 
reconstituted finished product were found to be comparable.  
The active substance impurities have been described. The absence of novel conjugation sites with the AAS 
is implied by an absence of changes in binding or cytotoxicity, and to the secondary/tertiary structure of 
the molecule, which were all found to be comparable between pre- and post-shift batches. Furthermore, 
additional analyses of batches containing high AAS confirmed the absence of novel conjugation sites. 
Unconjugated gemtuzumab and unconjugated calicheamicin are controlled. 
Specification (Gemtuzumab ozogamicin) 
The specification for the Gemtuzumab ozogamicin active substance has been provided and includes tests 
for characteristics, identity, purity, biological activity, product related impurities and safety. Limits reflect 
the clinical experience and are considered acceptable.  
Acceptance criteria for several gemtuzumab specifications were reviewed and tightened during the 
procedure.  
At submission, the definition of CQAs was considered insufficient, which lead to a major objection. During 
the procedure, CQAs were redefined and additional attributes were included in the intermediate 
gemtuzumab specification. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines.  
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data were provided. The results are within the specifications at the time of release and 
confirm consistency of the manufacturing process, for the parameters tested. 
Reference materials 
The reference material of the finished producthas been established.

Stability (Gemtuzumab ozogamicin) 
The stability results indicate that the active substance is sufficiently stable and justify the proposed shelf 
life in the proposed container. 
Real time, real condition stability data according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development 
The finished product, Mylotarg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion, contains 5 mg lyophilised 
gemtuzumab ozogamicin with no ovefill. Other components are dextran 40 (bulking agent), sucrose 
(cryoprotectant), sodium chloride (tonicity adjusting agent); sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate 
and disodium hydrogen phosphate anhydrous (buffering agents). All the excipients are well known 
pharmaceutical ingredients. Monobasic sodium phosphate, monohydrate, is not described in the Ph. Eur.; 
hence, compliance with USP is accepted. The quality of all the other excipients is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The primary packaging 
is a Type I borosilicate amber glass vial. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The 
choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the 
intended use of the product. 
When reconstituted to a 1 mg/mL concentration as directed, the extractable content of the vial is 4.5 mg 
(4.5 mL). The extractable volume is supported by data. Following reconstitution, the solution is further 
diluted with sterile saline and administered to patients by intravenous infusion. During dilution, 
reconstitution and administration Mylotarg needs to be protected from light, and a low protein binding 
filter must be used for the infusion.  
The batches of gemtuzumab ozogamicin that have been commercially manufactured demonstrated 
adequate quality and stability of the commercial formulation. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product manufacturing process consists of aseptic filtration and filling of the formulated 
active substance into vials, lyophilisation, and final stoppering/capping. The process is adequately 
described. 
The applicant has summarised the approach to the control. The applicant has submitted process 
validation data and is acceptable. The applicant is using mainly compendial methods for the analytical 
assays. Validation reports were provided where applicable.  
Product specification 
The specifications for Mylotarg at release include tests for the following quality attributes: characteristics, 
identity, purity, biological activity (by target binding and cytotoxicity), product related impurities and 
safety.  
CQAs for the finished products and related test parameters were updated during the procedure. 
Specifications have been tightened for certain attributes and the applicant has been recommended to 
Assessment report  
EMA/155284/2018  
Page 18/138 
 
 
 
 
 
review and adjust the finished product specifications for other attributes. The information provided is 
acceptable.  
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data of the finished product, at commercial scale, were provided. The results are within the 
specifications set at the time of release. 
Reference materials 
A reference material of the finished product has been established. 
Stability of the product 
Stability studies in line with ICH guidelines were presented. Finished product stability lots were 
manufactured with the commercial active substance.  All test results at the recommended storage 
conditions met the commercial specifications.  Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life is 
5 years, at the recommended storage conditions (store in a refrigerator (2°C-8°C). Do not freeze. Store 
the vial in the original carton to protect from light). 
Adventitious agents 
The applicant has given an overview of the approach to adventitious agent control and has conducted viral 
clearance studies to support the ability of the mAb purification process ability to remove adventitious 
viruses. The information provided for validation of adventitious virus removal is found sufficient. The 
applicant has also provided a thorough risk assessment in support of the viral testing performed to 
establish viral safety of gemtuzumab, which is found acceptable.   
TSE 
Certificates of suitability have been provided where applicable for materials utilised in the current 
manufacturing process. A risk assessment for TSE was provided as outlined in the ‘Note for guidance on 
minimizing the risk of transmitting animal spongiform encephalopathy agents via human and veterinary 
medicinal products (EMA/410/01 current revision).

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Several major deficiencies were identified in the initial quality package submitted in support of the 
Mylotarg MAA. All issues regarding the quality for Mylotarg were satisfactorily addressed and are now 
resolved.  
Primarily based on the AAS observed, several major deficiencies were identified in the initial quality 
package submitted in support of the Mylotarg MAA. None of the clinical studies supporting the current 
Assessment report  
EMA/155284/2018  
Page 19/138 
 
 
 
 
 
Mylotarg MAA used exclusively elevated AAS gemtuzumab batches, and as such do not fully represent the 
proposed commercial product. The fraction of gemtuzumab ozogamicin batches used in the clinical 
studies displaying elevated levels of AAS increased according to the accrual period of the studies. In the 
original submission, it was stated that it is not possible to perform heightened characterisation of the 
original product using state-of-the art orthogonal methods, due to unavailability of sufficient material, so 
comparability studies were limited in scope.  This was considered a major deficiency.  
The root cause of the AAS was identified. Since the evidence to fully support this was not sufficient, a 
major objection was raised to fully investigate the impact of several parameters on AAS levels. Data 
provided in the dossier suggest that changes to the production process could be implemented to eradicate 
the AAS and provide an antibody moiety with a consistent primary sequence; since the applicant has 
stated that this change would take time, it has committed to implement a new, improved process for 
gemtuzumab, designed to reduce AAS and improve consistency post-approval.  
A major objection (comprising part of a joint clinical MO) was raised regarding the potential impact of the 
AAS on the functional activity of Mylotarg. CD33 and FcRn binding between pre- and post-AAS shift 
batches was shown to be comparable on the whole. Additional data provided by the applicant also provide 
further evidence that no new sites for calicheamicin conjugation are introduced as a result of the AAS.  
Another major objection (comprising part of a second joint clinical MO) was raised regarding the use of 
batches with basal levels of AAS in the pivotal clinical trial. The applicant has now demonstrated 
convincingly that, except for the AAS, there is overall comparability at the quality level between pre- and 
post-AAS shift batches, and this point is considered resolved.  
A major objection regarding comparability of gemtuzumab throughout development is also considered 
resolved. Additional data provided by the applicant, which comprises a mixture of new data and a more 
thorough presentation of comparative data allows for a more comprehensive assessment of the relative 
quality attributes of pre- and post-AAS shift batches. No significant differences are found in binding to the 
CD33 target. Glycosylation, aggregation, and stability of the antibody are considered comparable. No new 
sites of conjugation were found, and the low conjugated and unconjugated fractions were found 
comparable. The provided data support the notion that the AAS has not had any significant effect on the 
critical quality attributes of Mylotarg and its functionality, as far as can be ascertained from analyses of 
quality attributes. A further major objection was raised regarding process robustness. Data provided in 
the initial submission suggested that the process may not be sufficiently robust to withstand any 
necessary future changes to the manufacturing process which might therefore lead to further variation in 
AAS or other quality attributes. The applicant has provided a substantial amount of process performance 
data. Important changes have been made to the control process, including increased testing and control 
of starting/raw materials as well as introducing new in process controlsand a general tightening of process 
controls and acceptance criteria for release.  
In summary, several major objections and a number of other concerns were raised. All issues regarding 
the quality for Mylotarg were satisfactorily addressed and are now resolved. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented 
to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends several points for investigation. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
All definitive toxicology studies (repeat dose toxicity, reproductive and developmental, genetic toxicity), 
and tissue cross-reactivity studies were conducted in accordance with US FDA GLP regulations, unless 
otherwise noted. Safety pharmacology studies were not GLP compliant. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro pharmacodynamics 
Binding affinity to soluble CD33 
The binding of gemtuzumab ozogamicin and hP67.6 antibody to soluble CD33 was evaluated using 
Biacore surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (RPT-56053). hP67.6 antibody exhibited a high affinity for 
CD33, with an average KD of 0.073 nM. This high affinity was not compromised by conjugation of 
N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH via the AcBut linker to hP67.6 antibody where the KD of gemtuzumab 
ozogamicin was 0.082 nM.  
Binding to a CD33-positive leukaemia cell line 
The relative binding affinity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin to a CD33-positive tumour cell line was 
determined in a competitive radioimmunoassay using HEL 92.1.7 erythroleukemia cells (MIRACL-26754). 
Gemtuzumab ozogamicin had an EC50 value of 11.6 nM (1.69 µg/mL) which was comparable to 11.9 nM 
(1.73 µg/mL) for the hP67.6 Ab which confirmed that conjugation of the linker-payload to the hP67.6 
antibody does not alter its binding affinity to the cells (Table 1). 
Binding to normal peripheral blood and bone marrow cells 
Binding characteristics of hP67.6 antibody and gemtuzumab ozogamicin were evaluated in peripheral 
blood and normal bone marrow cells from 5 allogeneic transplant donors as compared by flow cytometry 
(MIRACL-27251). While this study examined a very small sample size, overall, there does not appear to 
be a substantial difference in the binding characteristics with regard to cellular specificity for hP67.6 
antibody compared to gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Table 1).

Table 1. Summary of Key Pharmacologic Properties of Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin 
Cross-species binding data 
A tissue cross-reactivity study was conducted to determine whether hP67.6 cross reacts with cynomolgus 
monkey and Sprague-Dawley rat tissues (MIRACL-26808). Specific staining by hP67.6 was absent in all 
tissues of both animal species. In addition, the binding of hP67.6 antibody to Chinese hamster ovary 
(CHO) cells transfected with human and cynomolgus CD33 was evaluated. hP67.6 bound strongly to 
human CD33-transfected CHO cells but did not bind to the monkey CD33-transfected CHO cells (study 
084032).  
Internalisation of CD33 antibody 
Binding and internalization analysis of two radio iodinated anti-human CD33 antibodies, hP67.6 and M195 
benchmark antibody (8) was conducted with the CD33-expressing HL-60 cell line (GTR-36629). A 
published study of 315 leukemic bone marrow samples showed the highest concentration of CD33 in AML 
samples, with an average of 10,000 and a range of 700 to 55,000 copies per cell (9). These results were 
confirmed in HL-60 cell where the CD33 expression was estimated to be 22,000 molecules per cell 
(GTR-36629). The results indicated that 45 to 55% of the initially-bound hP67.6 was internalized over 22 
hours at 37˚C. A separate electron microscopy study (GTR-36630) confirmed that trafficking of mP67.11 
antibody (an antibody with no known differences to mP67.6) was mediated by endocytosis through the 
endosome/lysosome pathway in HL-60 cells. 
Intracellular elease of NAc-gamma calicheamicin DMH from gemtuzumab ozogamicin 
Once gemtuzumab ozogamicin has trafficked to the lysosomes, the calicheamicin cytotoxin is released by 
hydrolysis in the acidic environment. The rate of hydrolysis of N-Ac-γ- calicheamicin DMH was studied 
across a pH range (4.5, 6.0, and 7.4) (MIRACL-26756). The gemtuzumab ozogamicin sample did not 
show significant decomposition at pH 7.4. However, the ADC was relatively unstable at a pH value of 4.5, 
Assessment report  
EMA/155284/2018  
Page 22/138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
which approximates the pH of a lysosome, and approximately half of the observed release of N-Ac-γ 
calicheamicin DMH occurred in approximately 6 hours. Payload release at a pH value of 4.5, but not 7.4, 
is consistent with the therapeutic rationale. 
Activation of N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH by glutathione 
Following hydrolysis of the hydrazone moiety in the AcBut linker, the released N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH 
must be activated in order to damage DNA. Prior studies have shown that the DNA cleavage reaction 
requires a reducing agent, and in its absence the calicheamicin binds to DNA with no destructive effect 
(10). GSH, an abundant constituent of the cytoplasm, has been shown to react readily with 
γ-calicheamicin to form an active DNA-damaging agent at concentrations that would be found in the cell 
(Myers et al, 1994). N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH was designed to improve the stability of the disulfide 
bond.  
The activated, DNA-damaging product, the diradical form of N-Ac-ε-calicheamicin, is formed following 
exposure of N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH to GSH. Results of a study showed that the formation of 
N-Ac-ε-calicheamicin appeared to be directly proportional to the concentration of GSH in the reaction 
mixture (RPT-50556). The concentration of glutathione outside of cells in general circulation has been 
found to be in the low micromolar range (11);while, for example, the concentration of GSH in rat 
hepatocytes is 5 mM in the cytosol and as high as 20 mM in the nucleus. (12) The results of this study 
suggest that N-Ac-ε-calicheamicin can be produced without any enzymatic facilitation. In addition, the 
reaction of N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH with glutathione was low at slightly acidic pHs but robust at a 
physiological pH values of 7.4.  
In vitro cytotoxicity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin 
The cytotoxic activity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin was compared to N-Ac-γ calicheamicin DMH and N-Ac-γ 
calicheamicin DMH AcBut in CD33-positive HL-60 and CD33-negative Raji cell lines (MIRACL-26753). 
Potent cytotoxic activity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin was observed for CD33-positive cells (IC50 of 0.3 pM 
calicheamicin payload, or 0.46 pg/mL calicheamicin equivalents) and a selectivity index of 77,609 for 
CD33-positive versus CD33-negative cells. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin had greater potency when 
compared to non-specific cytotoxicity of N-Ac-γ calicheamicin DMH and N-Ac-γ calicheamicin DMH AcBut 
(IC50 values of 6.4 and 13.0 nM calicheamicin payload, or 9.2 and 18.6 ng/mL calicheamicin equivalents, 
respectively) for CD33-positive cells. Cytotoxicity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin was also compared to a 
non-binding murine plasmacytoma mAb control antibody conjugated to calicheamicin, MOPC-21, in 
HL-60 and Raji cells (MIRACL-26749 and MIRACL-26900). Gemtuzumab ozogamicin was 10,500 times 
more cytotoxic to HL-60 compared to the MOPC-21 antibody-calicheamicin conjugate. The cytotoxic 
effects of gemtuzumab ozogamicin were also investigated comparing cells with high levels of CD33 
(HL60, NOMO-1, NB4, and NKM-1), low CD33- positive (K562), and no CD33 (Daudi), as well as 
P-gp-expressing cell lines, MONO-1/ADR (adriamycin-resistant subline) and NB4/MDR (mdr1 
DNA-transfected (GTR-37661). Concentration-dependent, CD33-directed cytotoxicity was observed 
(IC50 approximately 0.084 nM calicheamicin payload) in the cell lines tested. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin 
had cytotoxic activity against MONO-1/ADR and NB4/ MDR only in the presence of MDR inhibitors, MS209 
and PSC833 (IC50 ranged from 0.175 to 17.5 nM).  
Gemtuzumab ozogamicin activity in primary human leukaemic bone marrow samples 
In order to assess the ability of gemtuzumab ozogamicin to inhibit cell growth from progenitor cells in 
patients, colony forming cell growth was assessed in diagnostic blood or bone marrow specimens from 
patients with AML and normal healthy donors (MIRACL-26757). Inhibition of colony growth was observed 
in all gemtuzumab ozogamicin treated samples. In the 27 samples incubated with 7.0 nM gemtuzumab 
ozogamicin, 15 had >25% inhibition of which 12 had >60% inhibition, while in samples incubated with

1.4 nM gemtuzumab ozogamicin 10 had >25% inhibition of which 4 with >60% inhibition. Normal bone 
marrow samples (n=3) were exposed to gemtuzumab ozogamicin of 7 to 28 nM calicheamicin payload 
and showed no inhibition of colony growth. Non-specific inhibition of colony formation was observed after 
AML patient samples were treated with 70 nM calicheamicin payload of a non-targeting hCTM01control 
but not at lower doses.  
In Vivo Pharmacodynamics 
Antitumor Effects of Single Dose Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin in the HL-60 Xenograft Model 
The in vivo antitumor effects of a single dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin were studied in a CD33-positive 
HL-60 xenograft model (MIRACL-26749 and MIRACL-26900). Athymic mice (n = 5 per test group; n = 10 
for the saline control group) were dosed IP with 30, 60, 90, and 120 mg/m2 of gemtuzumab ozogamicin 
8 days after subcutaneous implantation of tumour cells. A single dose of 120 mg/m2 of gemtuzumab 
ozogamicin resulted in 20% survival. The 30 mg/m2 dose resulted in 100% survival with 40% of the mice 
tumour-free, while at 60 and 90 mg/m2 gemtuzumab ozogamicin, survival was 80%, with 60% of the 
mice tumour free. Single dose gemtuzumab ozogamicin showed antitumor efficacy but had a poor 
survival rate at higher doses in mice at the doses tested; therefore, a fractionated dosing approach was 
explored as a possible improvement to the dosing regimen. Athymic mice implanted with HL-60 tumours 
allowed to grow to approximately 150 mg (n= 5 per test group, n = 10 in the saline control group) were 
given 3 IP doses once every four days (Q4Dx3) of gemtuzumab ozogamicin on days 7, 11, and 15 after 
tumour implantation for total doses of 9, 18, 54, and 108 mg/m2 (MIRACL-26749 and MIRACL-26900). In 
the gemtuzumab ozogamicin-treated mice, 100% survival was observed following administration of 9, 
18, and 54 mg/m2 doses. After doses of 9 and 18 mg/m2, 40% of the animals were tumour free while 60% 
were tumour free in the 54 mg/m2 dose group at study termination. After administration of 108 mg/m2 of 
gemtuzumab ozogamicin, 60% of the animals survived and were also tumour free at Day 37. In the 
saline-treated control group, there was no antitumor activity by Day 37. A separate experiment with the 
same Q4Dx3 dosing regimen of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in mice bearing larger 200 mg HL-60 tumours 
resulted in complete tumour regression and 100% survival at 18, 54, and 108 mg/m2 total doses of 
gemtuzumab ozogamicin administered Q4Dx3.  
A study comparing gemtuzumab ozogamicin and a control ADC (N-Ac-γ calicheamicin DMH AcBut 
conjugated to a non-binding murine plasmacytoma control antibody, MOPC-21) was conducted with 
Q4Dx3 IP administration for total doses of 9, 18, 54, and 108 mg/m2 in the HL60 xenograft model (n= 5 
per group, 150 mg tumours) in athymic mice. Tumour growth inhibition of >80% was observed across all 
4 gemtuzumab ozogamicin doses. All mice survived at 9, 18, and 54 mg/m2, while 2 deaths were 
observed at the 108 mg/m2 dose. In contrast, treatment with the MOPC-21 conjugate resulted in <20% 
tumour growth inhibition across all of the 4 doses, and 100% lethality was observed at the 108 mg/m2 
dose. Therefore, the efficacy of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in this tumour model was dependent on the 
CD33-directing properties of gemtuzumab ozogamicin. 
Antitumor Effects of Low Doses of Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin Administered IV in the HL-60 Xenograft 
Tumor Model 
More recent studies evaluated efficacy over a lower dose range and NOD/SCID mice were followed for a 
much longer period, 124 days (030406). Total doses of 1.2, 3.6, and 12 mg/m2 gemtuzumab ozogamicin 
were administered in a subcutaneous HL60 xenograft model in immune-compromised NOD/SCID mice. 
Mice (n = 10) with staged tumours (average volume 225 mm3) received 4 IV doses every 4 days (Q4Dx4) 
of either a non-binding calicheamicin conjugated antibody control or gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Treatment 
with 12 mg/m2 gemtuzumab ozogamicin caused sustained tumour regressions, with only 2 animals 
presenting tumor relapse around Day 45 and Day 80. Six (6) out of 10 animals remaining on study at Day

100 were tumour free. Treatment with a non-binding control ADC at 12 mg/m2 caused only transient 
reduction in tumour volume, and tumours relapsed at Day 32. The 3.6 mg/m2 dose of gemtuzumab 
ozogamicin delayed tumour growth significantly, but the tumours eventually relapsed and these animals 
were taken off study by Day 37. In contrast, the tumors of all animals in the non-binding ADC control 
group at 3.6 mg/m2 progressed, and all animals had to be taken off the study by Day 16 due to tumour 
burden. There was no observed efficacy in the group dosed with 1.2 mg/m2 of gemtuzumab ozogamicin.  
Antitumor Effects of Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin in Combination with Daunorubicin/ Cytarabine (DA) 
Chemotherapy in AML Xenograft Models with Leukemic Stem Cell Outgrowth 
The combination of gemtuzumab ozogamicin with conventional chemotherapy has showed significant 
improvement in the overall survival of AML patients (13) (14). However, when DA therapy was 
administered alone, despite early anti-leukemic responses, a high percentage of disease recurrence was 
observed. This has been attributed to the outgrowth of chemo-resistant LSCs characterized by their 
inherent ability for self-renewal (15) BM0407 and BM2407 PDX and human AML cell line (MV4-11-Luc) 
disseminated disease models in NOD/SCID mice were used to compare the antileukemic activity of DA 
chemotherapy, gemtuzumab ozogamicin monotherapy, and the combination of both therapies (study 
082753).  
High dose DA chemotherapy (cytarabine at 15 mg/kg subcutaneously daily for 5 days and daunorubicin 
at 1.5 mg/kg on Days 1, 3, and 5) resulted in elimination of human AML CD33+CD45+ blasts in the 
peripheral blood, but residual disease remained in the bone marrow. Combining DA chemotherapy with 
GO compared to either therapy alone resulted in nearly complete elimination of CD33+/CD45+ human 
tumor cells from both the peripheral blood and bone marrow. In the MV4-11-Luc disseminated model, the 
GO/DA combination also showed a statistically-significant increase in survival compared to DA or GO 
monotherapies.  
The combinatorial effect of DA and gemtuzumab ozogamicin was further tested in the AML BM0407 PDX 
disseminated model where DA (cytarabine at 10 mg/kg SC on Days 1-5 and 22-26 and daunorobucin at 
1 mg/kg IV on Days 1, 3, 5, 22, 24, and 26) or gemtuzumab ozogamicin monotherapy (at a dose of 0.06 
mg/kg per dose on Day 1 and 22, or 0.36 mg/m2 total dose, which is lower than the dose required for 
complete elimination of CD33+CD45+ blasts from the bone marrow) caused partial inhibition of leukemic 
growth, while the combination of DA with gemtuzumab ozogamicin completely depleted the 
CD33+/CD45+ AMLs from the bone marrow.  
AML PDX models, BM2407 and BM0407, were established in immunocompromised mice, and following DA 
chemotherapy, the residual disease, as measured by the percentage of CD33+/CD45+ blasts in the bone 
marrow, were analysed for expression of several cell surface markers associated with LSCs. In the 
BM2407 PDX model, CD34+ cells were enriched in the residual disease and characterized as a potential 
LSC marker, while in the BM0407 model, a CLL1+/CL117-population was enriched and identified as a 
potential LSC phenotype. The residual AML blasts in the bone marrow of BM0407 and BM2407 models 
treated with DA were sorted into subpopulations using potential LSC markers and retransplanted into a 
separate cohort of naïve mice to monitor for tumour engraftment. In the BM2407 model, CD33+/CD45+ 
were further sorted into CD34+ and CD34- cells. Implanting 2 x 105 or 6 x 105 CD33+/CD34+ cells 
resulted in all mice (5/5) developing bone marrow leukaemia burden. In contrast, CD33+/CD34- cells 
failed to engraft in any of the mice regardless of the cell concentration. Similarly, in the BM0407 model, 
when 1 x 105 of the sorted CLL1+/CD117- cells were injected into mice, all of the mice (5/5) developed 
bone marrow leukemic CD33+/CD45+ blast. On the contrary, the CLL1+/CD117+ cells failed to engraft 
in mice.

of mg/kg of body weight were 0, 1, 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg. hP67.6 antibody doses in mg/kg of body weight were converted 
to mg/m2 of body surface area using a conversion factor of 3 for mouse. 
b. Doses of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in rats expressed as calicheamicin equivalents on the basis of µg/kg of body 
weight were 0, 7.5, 25, or 75µg/kg, and when expressed as dose equivalents of the hP67.6 antibody on the basis of 
mg/kg of body weight were 0, 0.3, 1, or 3 mg/kg. hP67.6 antibody doses in mg/kg of body weight were converted to 
mg/m2 of body surface area using a conversion factor of 7 for rat. 
c. Doses of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in dogs expressed as calicheamicin equivalents on the basis of µg/kg of body 
weight were 0, 4.8, 16, or 48 µg/kg, and when expressed as dose equivalents of the hP67.6 antibody on the basis of 
mg/kg of body weight were 0, 0.19, 0.63, or 1.9 mg/kg. h67.6 antibody doses in mg/kg of body weight were converted 
to mg/m2 of body surface area using a conversion factor of 21 for dog. 
To evaluate potential effects on cardiac repolarization, N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH was tested for its effect 
on the hERG potassium channel stably expressed in HEK293 cells 
(N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin-DMHhERG). At concentrations up to 6.77 µM, <1% inhibition of the 
hERG current amplitude was observed. The IC50 value for hERG current inhibition was not determined 
because concentrations greater than 6.77 µM (10,000 ng/mL) could not be tested.  
In vitro, gemtuzumab ozogamicin at a concentration of 0.75 µg/mL calicheamicin equivalents caused no 
noticeable changes in spontaneous motility or contractile responses to acetylcholine, histamine, 
serotonin, or barium chloride in isolated guinea pig ileum (GTR-37315).  
Gemtuzumab ozogamicin was evaluated in mice, rats, and dogs after a single IV administration. Potential 
effects of gemtuzumab ozogamicin on the CNS (mice, rats), digestive system (mice), kidney function 
(mice), and hepatic function (rats) were evaluated. Potential cardiovascular effects were evaluated in 
dogs. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin caused no noticeable changes in gross activity or behaviour of mice, and 
no effects on spontaneous locomotor activity, potentiation of convulsions, on pain threshold, 
gastrointestinal transit, or changes in urinary volume or urinary electrolytes at doses of ≤30 mg/m2. 
Gemtuzumab ozogamicin administered to rats at ≤21 mg/m2 had no effect on body temperature 
compared with the control group, and caused no noticeable changes in the excretion of sodium 
bromosulphalein indicating no effect on hepatic function (GTR-37315).  
Gemtuzumab ozogamicin was administered IV to male mice (20/group) at doses of 3, 9, or 30 mg 
protein/m2 and pooled urine samples from each cage (5 animals/cage, 4 cages/group) was collected over 
5 hours. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin caused no noticeable changes in urine volume or urinary excretion of 
electrolytes (GTR-37316). 
Gemtuzumab ozogamicin was administered to conscious Beagle dogs at doses of 4 (30-minute infusion), 
13 (30-minute infusion), or 40 (bolus) mg/m2 (MIRACL-26834). Following bolus injection at 40 mg/m2, 
there was a reduction in cardiac output at 5 to 10 minutes postdose that gradually returned to baseline by 
40 minutes post dose. A decrease in mean arterial blood pressure was also observed at 5 to 20 minutes 
post dose, and was likely secondary to the reduction in cardiac output. Heart rate increased following 
gemtuzumab ozogamicin administration which appeared to be a reflexive response to maintain cardiac 
output. Heart rate was also increased at 13 mg/m2. There were no effects of gemtuzumab ozogamicin on 
hemodynamic or cardiac function at 4 mg/m2 nor on electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters at any dose. In 
addition, there were no effects on ECG parameters (monkeys) or cardiac histopathology findings (rats 
and monkeys) in the 6-week repeat-dose studies.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction study with gemtuzumab ozogamicin has been conducted (see 
discussion on non-clinical).

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were used for the quantitation of total hP67.6 antibody, 
total calicheamicin, and unconjugated calicheamicin in rat, dog, and/or monkey plasma. To quantify 
conjugated and unconjugated calcheamicin in monkey plasma from the 12 week study, LC-MS/MS was 
used.  
To support the 6-week toxicity studies in rats and monkeys, bioanalytical methods were developed and 
characterized. Non-validated gel permeation chromatography with radiochemical detection or ELISA 
methods were used for the qualitative assessment of ADA in rat and monkey plasma. To detect ADA in 
monkey plasma in the 12 week study, a validated ECL method was used.Qualified and/or validated assays 
used to support the TK and ADA evaluations in repeat-dose toxicity studies conducted under Good 
Laboratory Practices (GLP).  
The single-dose PK/TK of gemtuzumab ozogamicin was characterized after IV administration in 
Sprague-Dawley rats and cynomolgus monkeys. The mean PK Parameters after a single iv dose of 
[3H]gemtuzumab ozogamicin are displayed in Table 4.

After single IV administration of N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH, N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH AcBut, or N-Ac- 
ε-calicheamicin to male and female Sprague-Dawley rats (MIRACL-26628; MIRACL-26709; 
MIRACL-25706) and/or male and female Beagle dogs (MIRACL-26629; MIRACL-25707), the plasma 
concentrations of calicheamicin equivalents were evaluated using an ELISA that measured multiple forms 
of calicheamicin (including the administered calicheamicin derivatives and/or its metabolites). After 
single IV administration of N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH to rats or dogs, the PK of calicheamicin equivalents 
Assessment report

was characterized by moderate systemic CL and high Vss. After IV administration of N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin 
DMH AcBut to rats, the PK of the calicheamicin equivalents was characterized by low CL and a low to 
moderate Vss. PK parameters could not be determined in rats or dogs administered N-Ac-ε-calicheamicin, 
as systemic concentrations of calicheamicin equivalents were either BLQ (<2.5 ng/mL) or only 
quantifiable at the early time points.  
The TK of hP67.6 antibody, total calicheamicin, and/or unconjugated calicheamicin and the presence of 
ADA were assessed for up to 6 weeks (1 dose/week) in male and female Sprague-Dawley rats 
(MIRACL-26813) or male and/or female cynomolgus monkeys (MIRACL-26812; GTR-27677) after IV 
administration of gemtuzumab ozogamicin or hP67.6 antibody alone. Mean systemic hP67.6 antibody 
and/or total calicheamicin AUC exposure increased in a dose-proportional manner in rats and monkeys 
after single- and/or repeat-dose administration of gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Plasma concentrations of 
unconjugated calicheamicin were typically below the limit of quantitation (BLQ) and were only observed 
in the high dose group from each species. After repeat-dose administration of gemtuzumab ozogamicin, 
the total incidence of ADA-positive animals was 95% in rats and 8.3% to 33% in monkeys. Due to the 
high incidence of ADA in the 6-week repeat-dose rat toxicity study, time-dependent changes in exposure 
could not be assessed in these species. In the 6-week repeat-dose comparative toxicity study in 
monkeys, accumulation of hP67.6 antibody was observed after repeated administration of gemtuzumab 
ozogamicin or hP67.6 antibody, with AUC168 accumulation ratios ranging from 2.3 to 2.7. Mean, 
dose-normalized systemic exposure to hP67.6 antibody was similar in monkeys dosed with gemtuzumab 
ozogamicin prepared with hP67.6 antibody produced from either the initial or commercial cell lines. 
Plasma protein binding of N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH was high in mouse, rat, rabbit, monkey, and human 
plasma (≥ 97%). In rats, distribution of [3H]gemtuzumab ozogamicin radioequivalents into red blood 
cells and tissues was limited, with tissue-to-plasma AUC ratios ≤ 0.54 for all tissues evaluated. The 
highest tissue-to-plasma ratios were observed in the blood (0.54), liver (0.36), kidney (0.26), spleen 
(0.25), and lung (0.22). Radioequivalents in brain were < 2% of plasma. 
In vivo metabolism of gemtuzumab ozogamicin was not evaluated in nonclinical species; however, in vivo 
metabolism was evaluated in rats after IV administration of [3H]inotuzumab ozogamicin, which shares 
the same linker-payload and mAb IgG subclass as gemtuzumab ozogamicin and, like gemtuzumab 
ozogamicin, does not bind to its target antigen in nonclinical species. In rats, [3H]N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin 
DMH was extensively metabolized following release from [3H]inotuzumab ozogamicin. The primary 
metabolic pathway for [3H]N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH in rats was reduction of the disulphide moiety, 
leading to formation of N-Ac-ε-calicheamicin and deglycosylated tetrasaccharide metabolites. Hydrolysis 
(of the hydrazide moiety), oxidation, and adduction (with pyruvic acid) were minor metabolic pathways.  
Inotuzumab ozogamicin accounted for 66% of total drug-related material (AUC) in circulation of rats, with 
2 unidentified, higher molecular weight (MW) species accounting for the remainder of circulating 
radioactivity. In vivo metabolism of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in humans was assessed by analysis of 
urine samples collected from patients administered unlabeled gemtuzumab ozogamicin. All urinary 
metabolites detected in patient samples were also observed in rats administered [3H]inotuzumab 
ozogamicin.  
The effect of pH on the hydrolytic stability of the hydrazone linker of gemtuzumab ozogamicin was 
evaluated in buffer at various pH. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin was stable to hydrolytic cleavage at pH 7.4, 
but at pH 4.5, approximately 50% of the total N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH was hydrolytically cleaved from 
gemtuzumab ozogamicin in 6 hours.  
Minimal deconjugation of calicheamicin (<10%) occurred following incubation of gemtuzumab 
ozogamicin or [3H]inotuzumab ozogamicin in rat, monkey, or human plasma for up to 96 hours. 
N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH was stable in the presence of glutathione (GSH) at concentrations similar to 
Assessment report  
EMA/155284/2018  
Page 29/138 
 
 
 
 
 
those found in plasma but was readily reduced at intracellular concentrations. The contribution of 
glutathione-S-transferase (GST) was negligible compared to the effect of GSH alone.  
Following incubation of [3H]N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH in liver S9 (supplemented with a full complement 
of cofactors including glutathione) and plasma, metabolic profiles were similar across species as 
[3H]N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH underwent metabolism primarily by reduction. In addition, incubation of 
[3H]N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH in buffer controls were similar to those including liver S9 or plasma, 
suggesting that a majority of N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH biotransformation occurs non-enzymatically. 
Metabolic profiles of [3H]N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH observed in vitro were qualitatively similar to those 
observed in in vivo samples collected from rats dosed with [3H]inotuzumab ozogamicin. Collectively, 
these data indicate that the hydrolytic release of N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH from gemtuzumab 
ozogamicin or inotuzumab ozogamicin in circulation is limited and the metabolism of 
N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH occurs primarily via non-enzymatic reduction. Therefore, coadministration of 
gemtuzumab ozogamicin with inhibitors or inducers of CYP or UGT drug metabolizing enzymes are 
unlikely to alter exposure to N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH. 
After IV administration of [3H]gemtuzumab ozogamicin to rats, the majority of the radioactive dose was 
recovered in the faeces (59%), with urinary excretion as a minor route of elimination (13%). 
Radioactivity was eliminated slowly over time and was still being excreted in the faeces and urine of rats 
at the end of the study (14 days), accounting for the incomplete mass balance observed.  
Assessment of drug-drug interaction (DDI) potential with gemtuzumab ozogamicin and 
N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH for reversible or time-dependent CYP inhibition was based on the 50% 
inhibitory concentration (IC50) and/or inactivation kinetics determined from in vitro studies and the mean 
steady-state total Cmax of 3280 ng/mL (0.0221 μM) for hP67.6 antibody and 5.81 ng/mL (0.00393 μM) 
for unconjugated calicheamicin achieved in humans after multiple dose administration of 9 mg/m2 
gemtuzumab ozogamicin.   
Gemtuzumab ozogamicin did not cause induction of CYP3A4 in the transfected HepG2 cells at up to 
0.0424 μM of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (highest concentration evaluated). In humans, the mean 
steady-state total hP67.6 antibody Cmax after multiple dose administration of 9 mg/m2 of gemtuzumab 
ozogamicin was 3280 ng/mL (0.0221 μM). Gemtuzumab ozogamicin did not induce CYP3A4 at 
concentrations up to 0.0424 μM, which was approximately 2x the Cmax. N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH did 
not cause induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4 mRNA expression and/or enzyme activity in any of the 
3 hepatocyte lots evaluated to 0.3 μM. This was >50x the Cmax of unconjugated calicheamicin. Finally, 
N-Ac-ϵ-calicheamicin did not cause induction of CYP3A4 in the transfected HepG2 cells at up to 0.120 μM, 
which was >50x the Cmax of unconjugated calicheamicin. 
N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH demonstrated little or no reversible inhibition of UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, 
and UGT2B7 catalysed activities; however, N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH inhibited UGT1A1 activity. 
N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH showed little or no inhibition of the bidirectional transport of digoxin (P-gp 
substrate) or pitavastatin (BCRP substrate). The efflux ratio of digoxin in the absence and presence of 
N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH (0.3 μM) was 39.1 and 48.2, respectively. N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH inhibited 
the OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated transport of pravastatin and rosuvastatin by 30% and 16%, 
respectively, in a concentration-dependent manner. N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH, over the concentrations 
evaluated, did not inhibit OAT1, OAT3, or OCT2. The IC50 for inhibition was estimated to be >0.5 μM (Ki 
>0.25 μM) for OAT1 and >0.1 μM (Ki >0.05 μM) for OAT3 and OCT2.

Repeat dose toxicity 
•  6-Week Toxicity Study in Rats (study MIRACL-26813) 
In study MIRACL-26813 the potential toxicity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin and associated systemic 
exposure and anti-drug antibody (ADA) response after 6 weeks of once-weekly dosing and the 
reversibility of any effects after a 4-week non-dosing period was assessed in Sprague-Dawley rats. 
Gemtuzumab ozogamicin was administered IV (bolus) to male and female rats (15/sex/group for the 
toxicity animals; 12/sex/group for the toxicokinetic animals) at doses of 0 (PBS control), 7.2 (hP67.6 
antibody control), 0.6, 2.4, or 7.2 mg/m2/week.  There was no mortality and no ocular findings during the 
study. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin-related clinical signs of toxicity occurred at ≥0.6 mg/m2/week and 
included a dose-related increased incidence and frequency of few or no faeces and a wet/stained perianal 
area at 7.2 mg/m2/week. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin caused slightly lower mean body weight at ≥2.4 
mg/m2/week in males (22% to 34%) and at 7.2 mg/m2/week in females (19%). Gemtuzumab 
ozogamicin-related haematologic effects occurred on red blood cell (RBC) mass (RBC, haemoglobin, and 
haematocrit), and WBC counts. There were no clinical pathology changes observed after administration of 
hP67.6 antibody alone. The primary gemtuzumab ozogamicin-related microscopic findings were observed 
in the, kidney, liver, spleen, bone marrow, testes/epididymides, and male mammary gland. Slight to 
marked tubular dilation, casts, and basophilia were observed in the kidney of males and females at ≥ 2.4 
mg/m2/week. The microscopic findings in the kidney correlated with pale kidneys observed in males 
macroscopically at 7.2 mg/m2/week, slight increases in kidney weight (12% to 25%) at ≥ 2.4 
mg/m2/week, and proteinuria and decreased serum albumin. Vacuolation (minimal to slight, males only), 
hepatocellular karyocytomegaly (minimal to marked), atrophy of hepatocytes and dilation of sinusoids 
(minimal to moderate), oval cell/bile duct proliferation (minimal to slight), and haematopoiesis (minimal) 
were observed in the liver of both sexes at 7.2 mg/m2/week.  
After a 4-week non-dosing period, overall body weight gain (Days 41 to 69) was comparable in animals 
given gemtuzumab ozogamicin and control animals. Clinical pathology values in animals administered 
gemtuzumab ozogamicin were similar to control animals at the end of the 4-week non-dosing period 
except for WBC, ALT, and globulin, and proteinuria. On Day 65, mean WBC count was still lower in males 
at ≥0.6 mg/m2/week.  The ALT values in males were still moderately higher, and globulin was slightly 
higher in females at 7.2 mg/m2/week. Proteinuria was still present (2+ to 4+) at ≥0.6 mg/m2/week on 
Day 66. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin-related microscopic changes were observed in kidney, liver, testes, 
and male mammary gland at the end of the 4-week non-dosing period. There were no organ weight, 
macroscopic, or microscopic changes related to administration of the hP67.6 antibody alone at the end of 
the dosing or recovery phases of study. 
The NOAEL was considered to be 0.6 mg/m2/week based on adverse effects on male reproductive organs, 
kidney, liver, bone marrow, and spleen at ≥ 2.4 mg/m2/week. The mean Cmax exposure value for total 
hP67.6 antibody after the first dose was 1840 ng/mL and the mean AUC168 exposure value for total 
hP67.6 antibody after the first dose was 90,600 ng•h/mL at 0.6 mg/m2/week. 
•  6-Week Toxicity Study in Monkeys (study MIRACL-26812) 
This study assessed the potential toxicity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin and associated systemic exposure 
and ADA response following 6 weeks of once-weekly dosing in cynomolgus monkeys and the reversibility 
of any effects after a 4-week non-dosing period. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin was administered IV (bolus) to 
male and female monkeys (5/sex/group) at doses of 0 (PBS control), 22 (hP67.6 antibody control), 2.4, 
7.2, or 22 mg/m2/week. 
There were no unscheduled deaths or hP67.6 antibody- or gemtuzumab ozogamicin-related clinical signs, 
ECG, or ophthalmoscopic observations noted during the study. Slightly lower body weight (3% to 19%; 
Assessment report  
EMA/155284/2018  
Page 33/138 
 
 
 
 
 
Day 41) was observed at ≥7.2 mg/m2/week; however, there were no changes in qualitative food 
consumption. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin-related haematologic effects occurred on Days 9 and 37 at ≥.2 
mg/m2/week and consisted of slightly to moderately lower RBC mass (11% to 42%), WBCs (5% to 68%), 
polymorphonuclear cells (33% to 78%), and lymphocytes (41% to 63%). Gemtuzumab 
ozogamicin-related clinical chemistry effects occurred at 2.4 mg/m2/week on Days 9 and/or 37 and 
consisted of higher AST, total protein, globulin, and sodium, and lower albumin and albumin/globulin ratio 
(A/G). Gemtuzumab ozogamicin-related microscopic findings were noted in the kidney, liver, thymus, 
spleen, lymphatic tissues, and bone marrow. Minimal to moderate dilation, basophilia, casts, vacuolation 
of glomerular tufts, and/or accumulation of red granules were observed in the kidney at ≥7.2 
mg/m2/week. Slight to marked dilation of liver sinusoids with hepatocyte atrophy and minimal to slight 
amounts of brown pigment (hemosiderin) was observed in the liver at ≥7.2 mg/m2/week. Minimal to 
moderate hepatocellular single cell necrosis was observed at 22 mg/m2/week. Microscopic changes in the 
liver correlated with macroscopic findings of red foci/discoloured at ≥2.4 mg/m2/week. Changes in the 
lymphohaematopoietic system included slight to marked depletion of lymphocytes in the thymus; atrophy 
of germinal centers and depletion of lymphocytes in the spleen, cervical and mesenteric lymph nodes, and 
tonsils; and/or hypocellularity of the bone marrow at ≥7.2 mg/m2/week.  
Most gemtuzumab ozogamicin-related clinical pathology changes were fully reversible by the end of the 
4-week non-dosing period. RBC and lymphocyte counts were still lower at ≥7.2 mg/m2/week or 22 
mg/m2/week, respectively, but less than that observed at the end of the dosing period. Changes in the 
kidney and liver were partially to fully reversible after the non-dosing period. Changes observed in the 
lymphohaematopoietic system were not reversible. Slight to marked depletion of lymphocytes was 
observed in the thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes, and slight to marked atrophy of germinal centers was 
observed in the spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, and tonsils at ≥7.2 mg/m2/week. 
The NOAEL was considered to be 2.4 mg/m2/week based on target organ toxicity in the kidney, liver, and 
lymphohaematopoietic organs at ≥7.2 mg/m2/week. Mean Cmax and AUC168 exposure values (males 
and females combined) for gemtuzumab ozogamicin (as measured by total hP67.6 antibody) at Week 1 
(data for Week 6 was not collected) were 3500 ng/mL and 258,000 ng• h/mL, respectively. 
•  6-Week Toxicity and Comparability Study in Monkeys (study GTR-27677) 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the comparability, toxicity, and associated systemic exposure 
and ADA response of gemtuzumab ozogamicin manufactured with hP67.6 antibody produced from the 
initial and commercial cell lines following 6 weeks of once-weekly dosing in cynomolgus monkeys. 
Gemtuzumab ozogamicin manufactured with antibody produced from the commercial cell line was 
administered IV (bolus) to male monkeys (3/group) at doses of 0 (saline control), 18 (hP67.6 antibody 
control), 2.4, 6, or 18 mg/m2/week.  There were no unscheduled deaths and no gemtuzumab 
ozogamicin-related ophthalmologic findings. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin-related clinical signs were limited 
to a rash in 2 monkeys (7.2 mg/m2/week [initial cell line] and at 18 mg/m2/week).  
Mild decreases in RBC mass (RBC, haemoglobin, haematocrit) were observed at 18 mg/m2/week. 
Decreases in WBCs and lymphocytes, and increases in neutrophils were also observed at 18 mg/m2/week. 
Clinical pathology values were of similar magnitude for monkeys given 7.2 mg/m2/week (initial cell line) 
or 6 mg/m2/week, suggesting a similar biological effect of these two cell lines.  
Gemtuzumab ozogamicin-related findings were noted in haematolymphopoietic tissues (lymph nodes, 
tonsils, thymus, and spleen), testes and epididymides, bone marrow, kidney, and liver. Microscopic 
findings in the kidney and liver were similar to those reported in a previous 6-week study in monkeys with 
gemtuzumab ozogamicin (MIRACL-26812).  
Assessment report  
EMA/155284/2018  
Page 34/138 
 
 
 
 
 
When compared with monkeys given gemtuzumab ozogamicin at 7.2 mg/m2/week (initial cell line) in this 
study, changes in monkeys given 7.2 mg/m2/week (initial cell line) in the previous 6-week study 
(MIRACL-26812) included slightly more severe and widespread lymphoid depletion/atrophy. Additionally, 
liver cell atrophy and renal tubular alterations were also noted in the previous study. In contrast, bone 
marrow hypocellularity was slightly more prevalent in monkeys in the current study. The testicular and 
epididymal degenerative changes observed at 18 mg/m2/week in the current study were not reported in 
the previous study with the initial cell line.  
•  12-Week Toxicity Study in Monkeys (study 16GR242) 
A GLP-compliant general toxicity study in monkeys was also completed in which 12 doses of gemtuzumab 
ozogamicin were given once weekly by intravenous bolus injection to groups of 3 male and 3 female 
cynomolgus monkeys at doses of 0 (sterile water), 2.2, 6.6, or 11 mg/m2/week.  It was formulated at 
0.98 mg/ml.   
Doses of ≥11 mg/m2/weekk caused severe toxicity and monkeys were euthanized early, despite initiation 
of a dose-free period.  All monkeys in the higher two dose groups were euthanize early for this reason, 
between days 33 and 53 (between 4 and 8 doses).  Monkeys showed body weight loss with clinical decline 
attributed to primarily to drug-induced liver toxicity with evidence of decreased red cell mass due, at least 
in part, to test article-related bone marrow injury.  In addition, at ≥2.2 mg/m2/week, there was body 
weight loss, decreases in red cell mass and microscopic findings in liver, bone marrow, lymphoid organs, 
kidney, male and female reproductive organs, and/or eyes which meant that in this study, a no 
observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) was not identified.  Monkeys administered  2.2 mg/m2/kg were 
euthanized after 12 doses, 1 week earlier than initially intended.  Monkeys in all doses groups, including 
the lowest, showed body weight loss with a reduction in food intake.  There were multiple abnormalities 
in clinical chemistry testing.  These included increases in liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST), gamma glutamyltransferase and total bilirubin with decreased albumin and A:G ratio.  On 
microscopic examinations, the livers showed sinusoidal dilatation and/or hepatocyte atrophy in monkeys 
given 6.6 or 11 mg/m2/week.  At post-mortem, organ weight data were only collected from monkeys 
given 2.2 mg/m2/week.  There were findings of lower weight of testes and epididymes, correlated with 
microscopic findings of degeneration of the seminiferous tubules in the testis and increased luminal 
debris, epithelial degeneration, and oligospermia.  Liver weights were lower in males.  Thymus weights in 
females given 2.2 mg/m2/weekwere reduced (non-significantly so) but thymuses showed decreased 
lymphocytes.  There were also increases in the weight of kidneys and spleen.  There were changes seen 
on microscopic examination in liver, bone marrow (sternum), kidney, lymphoid organs (thymus, spleen, 
and mesenteric lymph node), eyes, testis, epididymis, seminal vesicle, ovary, oviduct, uterus and cervix.  
Immunostaining for VEGFR2 in controls resulted in staining of the endothelial cells uniformly throughout 
the liver; in monkeys given gemtuzumab ozogamicin, there was minimally to moderately decreased 
staining consistent with alteration and/or loss of sinusoidal endothelial cells in affected regions.  In the 
bone marrow of the sternum, there was an increase in myeloid / erythroid ratio (resulting from decreased 
population of erythroid precursors), considered adverse at ≥6.6 mg/m2/week and which were associated 
with decreases in red blood cell mass.  In the kidneys, again at ≥ 6.6 mg/m2/week, there were changes 
of minimal to moderate tubular epithelium degeneration / regeneration, minimal or slight 
karyocytomegaly of tubular epithelium, minimal to slight glomerulopathy and moderate pigment in 
tubular epithelial cells.  Lymphoid organ findings were observed at ≥2.2 mg/m2/weekand consisted of 
decreased lymphocyte cellularity in splenic follicles, in the thymus (cortex and medulla), and in the 
mesenteric lymph node (characterized by decreased follicle size or absence of follicles).  The male 
reproductive tract was adversely affected, consistent with the organ weight changes described above and 
in the reproductive tract of females, there were also adverse changes of ovarian atrophy and disruption 
or loss of a normal menstrual cycle would be expected.  There were a multitude of other changes noted 
Assessment report  
EMA/155284/2018  
Page 35/138 
 
 
 
 
 
that were attributed to secondary consequences of the primary effects just described.  There was a 
finding of myocardial degeneration / necrosis in a male at 2.2 mg/m2/week, but its acute nature 
suggested to the applicant that it had occurred near the time of euthanasia and was not due to 
gemtuzumab ozogamicin.   
Therefore, in this study, a NOAEL was not identified; the lowest observable adverse effect level (LOAEL) 
for the study was 2.2 mg/m2/week.  Mean overall exposure values (male and female combined) at the 
LOAEL for total antibody (hP67.6) were 7,420 ng/mL and 541,000 ng•h/mL for Cmax and AUC168, 
respectively, at Week 1 and 13,900 ng/mL and 1,470,000 ng•h/mL for Cmax and AUC168, respectively, at 
Week 6 (exposures at Week 12 were similar to Week 6). 
•  13-Day Tolerability Study in Rabbits (study GTR-33261) 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the tolerability of gemtuzumab ozogamicin after 13 days of 
once-daily dosing in female New Zealand White rabbits followed by a 15-day non-dosing period. 
Gemtuzumab ozogamicin was administered IV (bolus) via a marginal ear vein to female rabbits (4/group) 
at doses of 0 (vehicle control), 1.2, 3.6, or 7.2 mg/m2/day. All animals survived the dosing period; 
however, 2 animals given 7.2 mg/m2/day were electively euthanized  during the post-dose period (Days 
16 or 23) as a result of adverse clinical observations (lacrimation, white discharge around eyes, lethargy, 
ptosis, lack of food consumption in 1 animal, and body weight loss for both animals [15% to 25%]). 
Cultures of samples from the eyes and paranasal sinus were negative for pathogenic bacteria, and the 
cause of ocular discharge could not be determined. The remaining observations were attributed to 
administration of gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Dose-related mean decreases in food consumption and body 
weight occurred in all groups administered gemtuzumab ozogamicin, and these effects occurred generally 
during and after the second week of dosing. In the 1.2 mg/m2/day group, 1 of 4 females was affected, 
whereas all animals were affected in the 3.6 and 7.2 mg/m2/day groups. During the second week of 
dosing at ≥ 1.2 mg/m2/day, mean body weight loss ranged from 112 to 263 grams, and mean food 
consumption decreased from 33% to 57% during the same period. Body weights continued to decrease 
during the non-dosing period (Days 14 to 28) at 7.2 mg/m2/day, but partial recovery from body weight 
losses occurred at ≤ 3.6 mg/m2/day. Macroscopic findings at 7.2 mg/m2/day in animals at the scheduled 
necropsy included discoloration of the anterior lobes of the lung (bilateral) in 1 animal, and multifocal tan 
discoloration of the liver in another animal. 
The MTD was considered to be 1.2 mg/m2/day based on the absence of gemtuzumab ozogamicin-related 
changes in 3 of 4 animals in this group, mortality at 7.2 mg/m2/day, and dose-related decreases in body 
weight and food consumption at ≥3.6 mg/m2/day. 
Genotoxicity 
Gemtuzumab ozogamicin was evaluated for potential genotoxicity in an in vivo mouse micronucleus 
study. In addition, in vitro studies were conducted with the unconjugated calicheamicin derivative 
N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH. All studies were conducted in compliance with GLP regulations.

study report, doses of PF-05208747 are expressed as dose equivalents of the hP67.6 antibody on the basis of mg/kg of body weight (0, 
0.02, 0.06, 0.12, and 0.18 mg/kg, respectively). Doses were converted to mg/m2 using a conversion factor of 6 for rat. 
f. Doses of PF-05208747 are expressed as dose equivalents of the hP67.6 antibody on the basis of mg/m2 of body surface area. In the 
study report, doses of PF-05208747 are expressed as dose equivalents of the hP67.6 antibody on the basis of mg/kg of body weight (0, 
0.025, 0.075, and 0.2 mg/kg, respectively). 
Doses were converted to mg/m2 using a conversion factor of 6 for rat. 
g. An additional 12 females/group at doses of 0.15, 0.45, or 1.2 mg/m2 were included as satellite animals for determination of 
toxicokinetic parameters and antibody response. 
h. An additional 3 (timed-mated) or 5 (non-gravid) females/group were dosed daily for 3 days by IV injection without dextran-40 or with 
the same and lesser amounts of dextran-40, respectively, to determine if the swelling observed in all groups in the developmental 
toxicity dose-ranging aspect of the study were attributable to the presence of dextran-40 in the dosing formulations. In these groups, 
0 . 1 4 % )  o f d e x t r a n
tissue swelling did not occur in the rats given formulation diluent without dextran-40 or with lesser amounts (
-40, 
while similar tissue swelling occurred in the rats given dextran-40 (0.91%) in phosphate buffered saline. These results indicated that the 
tissue swelling in rats observed in the developmental toxicity dose-ranging aspect of the study was due to the dextran-40 component 
of the vehicle. 
In the 6 week toxicity study with gemtuzumab ozogamicin (MIRACL-26813) effects on male reproductive 
organs (testes, epididymides, and mammary gland) were observed at ≥ 2.4 mg/m2/week (approximately 
3.7 or 18 times the human clinical exposure after the second human dose of 9 mg/m2, or after the third 
human dose of 3 mg/m2, respectively, based on AUC). Effects on male rat reproductive organs were 
partially reversible or not reversible following a 4-week non-dosing period. These findings did not resolve 
following a 9-week recovery period. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin adversely affected male fertility in rats 
(RPT-40369), effects included lower spermatogonia and spermatocytes, decreases in testicular 
spermatids and epididymal sperm, vacuolation of the nucleus in spermatids, and/or appearance of giant 
cells at ≥ 0.12 mg/m2/day. Additional findings included effects on the testes and epididymides; both 
organs were macroscopically small and decreased in weight as well as fertility (1.08 mg/m2/day). When 
male rats were mated again after a 9-week non-dosing period, effects on sperm and fertility were worse 
but there was partial recovery of the lower spermatogonia and spermatocytes in the testes.  
The potential for gemtuzumab ozogamicin to have effects on fertility and early embryonic development 
was evaluated in female Sprague-Dawley rats (RPT-40230). Female rats (32/group) were administered 
gemtuzumab ozogamicin IV once daily at doses of 0 (vehicle), 0.12, 0.36, or 1.08 mg/m2/day for 14 
days. There were no gemtuzumab ozogamicin-related effects on copulation and fertility index in any 
females that mated at the end of the dosing or non-dosing periods; however, in females at the end of the 
dosing period there was a decrease in corpora lutea at 1.08 mg/m2/day indicating an effect on ovulation. 
This decrease in corpora lutea resulted in lower numbers of implants at 1.08 mg/m2/day. At the end of the 
dosing phase, the average number of live embryos per litter was 14.33, 13.07, 11.86, and 7.13, and the 
dead embryo indices were 6.52%, 7.98%, 15.74%, and 47.95% at 0 (vehicle control), 0.12, 0.36, or 1.08 
mg/m2/day, respectively; this increase in embryo lethality at 0.36 and 1.08 mg/m2/day was considered 
gemtuzumab ozogamicin related. The lower numbers of corpora lutea resulted in lower numbers of 
implants in the 1.08 mg/m2/day group at the end of the dosing phase. In dams that mated at the end of 
the non-dosing period, no effects of gemtuzumab ozogamicin were observed in the numbers of corpora 
lutea, implants, or embryos. The NOAEL for general and female reproductive toxicity was 0.12 
mg/m2/day based on effects on maternal body weight, maternal food consumption, female fertility (lower 
numbers of corpora lutea), and early embryonic development (embryo lethality) at ≥0.36 mg/m2/day in 
females that were mated immediately after the gemtuzumab ozogamicin-dosing phase. No gemtuzumab 
ozogamicin-related effects on early embryonic development were observed in dams that mated at the 
end of the 6-week non-dosing period. 
Dose-dependent reductions in maternal food consumption, body weight gain, uterine weights and fetal 
body weight was observed after daily dosing with gemtuzumab ozogamicin (0.06; 0.15 and 0.36 
mg/m2/day) to pregnant rats (GTR-33829). The highest dose (approximately 0.04 times the 
recommended human single dose on a mg/m2 basis) produced increased embryo-foetal mortality, and

gross external, visceral, and skeletal malformations. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin-related fetal 
morphological anomalies were observed at ≥  0.15 mg/m2/day and included digital malformations, 
absence of the aortic arch, anomalies in the long bones in the forelimbs, misshapen scapula, absence of 
a vertebral centrum, and fused sternebrae at 0.36 mg/m2/day. The maternal and developmental NOAEL 
was 0.06 mg/m2/day, although decreased skeletal ossification was observed in one foetus of the low-dose 
group (not different from vehicle).  The lowest dose with embryo-foetal effects correlated with 9.7 times 
the human clinical exposure after the third human dose of 3 mg/m2, based on AUC. 
Toxicokinetic data 
The threshold plasma concentrations of gemtuzumab ozogamicin associated with toxicologically 
important findings from in vivo nonclinical safety studies are shown in Table 9. Safety margins are 
presented based on a comparison of gemtuzumab ozogamicin AUC values associated with NOAELs for 
toxicology findings to human clinical exposure (AUC) at human doses for both indications (AML in first 
relapse and untreated de novo AML).

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Phase I: Estimation of Exposure 
The cytotoxic agent or active ingredient in gemtuzumab ozogamicin is calicheamicin, an antitumor 
antibiotic derived from the bacterium Micromononspora echinospora found in chalky soil. The active 
ingredient or payload consists of conjugated and unconjugated calicheamicin. Total calicheamicin, 
including the payload and the linker components 4-(4-acetylphenoxy) butanoic acid (AcBut) and 
3-mercapto-3-methyl butanoic acid, hydrazide (DMH), was determined to be the environmentally 
relevant component of gemtuzumab ozogamicin used in this assessment. No experimental value for the 
the log Kow for the active ingredient has yet been determined.  The log D values estimated by calculation 
are provided below. 
Screening for Persistence, Bioaccumulation and Toxicity (PBT) 
Calculation of the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) in Surface Water 
Fpen Refinement 
As per the original public summary of opinion on orphan designation of gemtuzumab ozogamicin for the 
treatment of AML2, as well as subsequent Rev 1 (June 2013)3, the prevalence of the condition in the 
European Union is 0.66 in 10,000 persons 0.66 patient / 10,000 population = 0.000066 EU population  
Fpenrefined = 0.000066 
Dosing Regimen 
For patients with previously untreated de novo CD33-positive AML, the recommended dose of 
gemtuzumab ozogamicin during induction is 3 mg/m2 (body surface area) up to a maximum dose of 5 mg, 
on Days 1, 4, and 7. Therefore, over a 7 day period, patients will receive a maximum dose of 15 mg total 
drug. Since gemtuzumab ozogamicin is not dosed on a daily basis, but over a 7 day period, the maximum 
daily dose, based on total calicheamicin (payload and linker), defined as Nacetyl gamma calicheamicin 
DMH Ac-But acid, is derived as follows:  
Maximum daily dose = [(35 μg/mg x 15 mg)] / 1000  
      7 days Maximum daily dose = 0.075 mg/day

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The hP67.6 antibody exhibited a high affinity for CD33, with an average KD of 0.073 nM. Gemtuzumab 
ozogamicin had an EC50 value of 11.6 nM (1.69 µg/mL) which was comparable to hP67.6 antibody, 
indicating that conjugation of the linker-payload to the hP67.6 antibody does not alter its binding affinity 
to the cells. Binding and internalization analysis of radioiodinated hP67.6 antibody demonstrated efficient 
delivery of the cytotoxic payload of the product into CD33-expressing HL-60 cells and payload release was 
determined at a pH value of 4.5, which is consistent with the pH in the acidic lysosomal vesicular 
compartment of the cell.  
Gemtuzumab ozogamicin exhibited in vitro cytotoxicity in CD33+ cells, and inhibition of colony growth in 
blood or bone marrow specimens from AML patients, but not in normal samples.  
In HL60 AML subcutaneous xenografts in immune-compromised mice, gemtuzumab ozogamicin reduced 
tumour growth and enhanced survival at doses of 1 mg/kg/day on a q4dx4 schedule. 
Gemtuzumab ozogamicin safety pharmacology was evaluated in mice, rats, and dogs after a single IV 
administration. In an in vitro hERG current inhibition study with N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH, no significant 
hERG current inhibition was observed up to 6.77 µM.  
Nonclinical studies assessing drug-drug interaction potential of gemtuzumab ozogamicin and/or 
N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH were presented and indicated a low potential to inhibit activities of CYP1A2, 
CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4/5 at clinically relevant concentrations. 
N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH demonstrated little or no reversible inhibition of UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, 
and UGT2B7 catalysed activities; however, N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH inhibited UGT1A1 activity. 
N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH showed little or no inhibition of the bidirectional transport of digoxin (P-gp 
substrate) or pitavastatin (BCRP substrate).N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH inhibited the OATP1B1- and 
OATP1B3-mediated transport of pravastatin and rosuvastatin by 30% and 16%, respectively, in a 
concentration-dependent manner. A low potential for an interaction between N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH 
and these two transporters at clinically relevant concentrations exists. N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH, over 
the concentrations evaluated, did not inhibit OAT1, OAT3, or OCT2.  
Overall, N Ac γ-calicheamicin DMH showed a low potential to inhibit P gp, BCRP, BSEP, MRP2, MATE1, 
MATE2K, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OAT1, OAT3, and OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations. 
The main toxicities occurred in the liver, bone marrow and lymphoid organs, haematology parameters 
(decreased RBC mass and WBC counts, mainly lymphocytes), kidney, eye and male and female 
reproductive organs. Effects on liver, kidney and male reproductive organs in rats, and on lymphoid 
tissues in monkeys (approximately 18 times for rats, and 36 times for monkeys, the human clinical

exposure after the third human dose of 3 mg/m2 based on AUC168) were not reversible. Effects on female 
reproductive organs and the eye in monkeys were adverse in the 12-week study (approximately 193 and 
322 times, respectively, the human clinical exposure after the third human dose of 3 mg/m2 based on 
AUC168). The relevance of the irreversible animal findings to humans is uncertain (SmPC, section 5.3). 
Clinical chemistry changes in rats and monkeys included dose-related changes in AST, ALT, and/or ALP 
after single and/or repeat dosing with GO. Mylotarg has the potential to cause elevations in liver-related 
laboratory tests and hepatotoxicity. Severe (Grade ≥ 3) and/or serious hepatotoxicity including all 
VOD/SOS has been classified as an identified risk in the Risk Management Plan (see discussion on clinical 
safety). 
In rats and monkeys, haematology changes consisted of decreases in RBC mass, WBC counts (mainly 
lymphocytes), and platelets (rats only at high doses associated with hepatocellular necrosis) in single 
and/or repeat-dose studies up to 6 weeks in duration with GO. Myelosuppression (Severe and/or serious 
infection and haemorrhage has been classified as an identified risk in the Risk Management Plan (see 
discussion on clinical safety). 
Nervous system effects have not been observed in rats or monkeys after single or repeat dosing with GO. 
Nervous system alterations were identified after repeat doses in rats with other antibody-calicheamicin 
conjugates and are considered to be a class effect (SmPC, section 5.3). Neurotoxicity has been classified 
as a potential risk in the Risk Management Plan (see discussion on clinical safety). 
Renal tubular degeneration associated with tubular casts, dilation, karyocytomegaly, and basophilia, 
accompanied by proteinuria and decreased serum albumin was observed in rats after in single- or 
repeat-dose studies up to 6 weeks in duration with GO. Renal toxicity has been classified as a potential 
risk in the Risk Management Plan (see discussion on clinical safety). 
Gemtuzumab ozogamicin was found to be clastogenic. This is consistent with the known induction of DNA 
breaks by calicheamicin and other enediyne antitumour antibiotics. N acetyl gamma calicheamicin DMH 
(the released cytotoxin) was found to be mutagenic and clastogenic (SmPC, section 5.3). Second primary 
malignancy has been classified as a potential risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
Formal carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with gemtuzumab ozogamicin. In toxicity 
studies, rats developed preneoplastic lesions (minimal to slight oval cell hyperplasia) in the liver 
approximately 54 times, the human clinical exposure after the third human dose of 3 mg/m2 based on 
AUC168). There were no preneoplastic or neoplastic lesions observed in monkeys up to approximately 115 
times the human clinical exposure after the third human dose of 3 mg/m2 based on AUC168). The 
relevance of these animal findings to humans is uncertain (SmPC, section 5.3). 
In a female rat fertility study slightly lower numbers of corpora lutea and increased embryolethality were 
observed in the presence of maternal toxicity (approximately 9.7 times, the human clinical exposure after 
the third human dose of 3 mg/m2 based on AUC168). Effects on the reproductive tract of female monkeys 
were observed in the 12-week study (atrophy of the ovary, oviduct, uterus, and cervix; approximately 
193 times the human clinical exposure after the third dose of 3 mg/m2) (SmPC, section 5.3).  
In a male fertility study, effects on male reproduction included lower spermatogonia and spermatocytes, 
decreases in testicular spermatids and epididymal sperm, vacuolation of the nucleus in spermatids, 
and/or appearance of giant cells. Additional findings included effects on the testes, epididymides and 
mammary gland as well as fertility. When male rats were mated again after a 9 week non-dosing period, 
effects on sperm and fertility were worse but there was partial recovery of the lower spermatogonia and 
spermatocytes in the testes. Effects on male rat reproductive organs were partially reversible or not 
reversible. Male reproductive effects (testes, epididymides, seminal vesicles) in monkeys were observed

at approximately 66 times the human clinical exposure after the third dose of 3 mg/m2) (SmPC, section 
5.3). 
In an embryo-foetal toxicity study lower foetal body weight, higher incidence of foetal wavy ribs, and 
lower incidence of foetal skeletal ossification were observed. Increased embryolethality and foetal 
morphological anomalies included digital malformations, absence of the aortic arch, anomalies in the long 
bones in the forelimbs, misshapen scapula, absence of a vertebral centrum, and fused sternebrae. 
Increased embryolethality was also observed in the presence of maternal toxicity. The lowest dose with 
embryo-foetal effects correlated with 9.7 times the human clinical exposure after the third human dose of 
3 mg/m2, based on AUC168 (SmPC, section 5.3). 
A tissue cross-reactivity study using rat or cynomolgus monkey cryosections determined that specific 
staining by hP67.6 was absent in all tissues of both animal species. In view of the absence of 
cross-reactivity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin with CD33 from laboratory species, studies of kinetics in 
animals can only be of limited value, as there will be no binding, specific intracellular uptake, and 
metabolism of the conjugate that underlies its therapeutic action in humans. Further PK data were 
derived from the 13-week toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys.  The mechanism proposed for liver 
toxicity is suggested to be related to tissue vascularisation and hence exposure to the product ie the liver, 
as a highly perfused organ, is exposed to more gemtuzumab ozogamicin than poorly vascularised tissues.  
Toxicity is suspected to arise from uptake by liver sinusoidal cells and breakdown of gemtuzumab 
ozogamicin leading to local cellular toxicity where this occurs. Therefore this does not correlate with tissue 
binding results. 
The phototoxic potential of gemtuzumab ozogamicin is low, based on the type of product and a low 
distribution to eye and skin in rats. 
The introduction of Mylotarg would not be expected to result in an environmental risk based on the data 
generated. However, this conclusion is based on an estimated value for log Kow; the applicant is 
recommended to provide an experimentally derived log Kow as a post authorisation measure.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic data were obtained from 8 Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials with GO (study A1-101-US, 
study B1-201-US/CA, study B1-202-EU, study B1-205-AU/EU/US, study B1-206-AU/EU/US), including 
one paediatric Phase 1 study (study A1-102-US), one Phase 2 trial in elderly patients age ≥ 60 years only 
(study B1 203 US/EU), and one Phase 1/2 trial conducted in Japanese patients (study A1-103-JA). 
Population PK model 
The dataset for the pooled analysis of hP67.6 comprised 5643 concentrations obtained from 407 patients, 
including 505 (9%) concentrations < LLOQ. The dataset for the pooled analysis of unconjugated 
calicheamicin comprised 4281 concentrations obtained from 338 patients, including 730 (17%) 
concentrations < LLOQ. 
Absorption  
Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is administered intravenously, therefore absorption is not applicable. 
Distribution 
In vitro, the binding N-acetyl gamma calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide to human plasma proteins is 
approximately 97%. In vitro, N-acetyl gamma calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide is a substrate of 
P-glycoprotein (P-gp). In patients, the total volume of distribution of hP67.6 antibody (sum of V1 [10 L] 
and V2 [15 L]) was found to be approximately 25 L (SmPC, section 5.2). 
Elimination 
The primary metabolic pathway of gemtuzumab ozogamicin is anticipated to be hydrolytic release of N 
acetyl gamma calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide. In vitro studies demonstrated that N acetyl gamma 
calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide is extensively metabolised, primarily via nonenzymatic reduction of the 
disulphide moiety. The activity (cytotoxicity) of the resultant metabolites is expected to be significantly 
attenuated. In patients, unconjugated calicheamicin plasma levels were typically low, with a predicted 
mean Cmax of 1.5 ng/mL following the third dose (SmPC, section 5.2). 
Based on Population PK analyses, the predicted clearance (CL) value of hP67.6 from plasma was 3 L/h 
immediately after the first dose and then 0.3 L/h. The terminal plasma half-life (t½) for hP67.6 was 
predicted to be approximately 160 hours for a typical patient at the recommended dose level (3 mg/m2) 
of Mylotarg ( SmPC, section 5.2).

For most of the studies where 2 doses of GO were administered, exposure increased approximately 2-fold 
in Dose Period 2.  In Studies 201, 202, and 203, the mean increase in Cmax for Dose Period 2 was 
approximately 19%, compared to Dose Period 1.  However, AUCinf increased by 92%, from 137400 
ng·h/mL in Dose Period 1 to 263700 ng·h/mL in Dose Period 2.  Unconjugated calicheamicin exposure also 
increased in the second dose period by 15% for Cmax and by 25% for AUCinf, compared to the first dose 
period. A similar trend was observed in Studies 101 and 103 in adult AML patients, as well in as paediatric 
AML patients in Study 102, where mean AUCinf increased by 53% and 44%, for the 6 mg/m2 and 9 mg/m2 
groups, respectively.   
Special populations 
Age 
The adult population modelling showed that age did not significantly affect the PK of hP67.6. Similarly, 
age was not a significant covariate in the exposure-response modelling for efficacy and safety endpoints 
within the adult population.

The adult population PK analysis required incorporation of a fixed effect of BWT (allometric scaling) on V1 
and CL1 for hP67.6. Similarly, for unconjugated calicheamicin, a fixed effect of BWT (allometric scaling) 
was included for CL/F and V1/F. 
Assessment report  
EMA/155284/2018  
Page 56/138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For the paediatric population modelling, BWT was incorporated as a fixed effect on hP67.6 CL1, central 
volume of distribution (V1), and decay coefficient of the time-dependent clearance (kdes) using the 
theoretical allometric values of 0.75 and 1 for clearance and volume, respectively, and estimating the 
effect of body weight on kdes. 
Renal impairment 
The clearance of hP67.6 in patients with mild renal impairment (N=149) and with moderate renal 
impairment (N=47) was similar to the clearance of hP67.6 in patients with normal renal function 
(N=209). Severe renal impairment could not be assessed due to lack of information (N=1). For 
unconjugated calicheamicin, the same measure of renal impairment was tested as a covariate in the 
population model and was not found to significantly affect the PK. 
The median estimated total CL values were 0.113, 0.112, 0.0889, and 0.0670 L/hour for patients in the 
normal (A), mild (B1), mild (B2), and moderate (C) groups, respectively; there were no patients in the 
severe (D) group.  
Hepatic impairment 
The results showed the clearance of hP67.6 in patients with mild hepatic impairment (B1, N=58), mild 
hepatic impairment (B2, N=19), or moderate hepatic impairment (C, N=6) was similar to that in patients 
with normal hepatic function (A, N=322). In the 6 patients with moderate hepatic impairment (C), the 
median hP67.6 clearance appeared to be lower; however, the mean hP67.6 clearance was not lower. For 
unconjugated calicheamicin, the same measures of hepatic impairment were tested as covariates in the 
population model and none were found to significantly affect the PK. 
Gender 
The volume of distribution in the central compartment (V1) was decreased by 16.2% in females patients. 
Gender was not a significant covariate for the PK parameters of unconjugated calicheamicin. The 
exposure-response model showed that gender did not significantly affect the efficacy or safety outcomes 
examined. 
Race 
The adult population modelling showed that race did not significantly affect the PK of hP67.6 or 
unconjugated calicheamicin. Population PK modelling showed that race, in particular Asian vs non-Asian 
(White 89%, Black 2%, Other 2%, Asian 7%), was not a significant covariate on the pharmacokinetics of 
gemtuzumab ozogamicin.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No clinical drug interaction studies have been conducted with gemtuzumab ozogamicin. 
Potential Inhibition of CYP Enzymes 
The potential for gemtuzumab ozogamicin to reversibly inhibit the catalytic activity of 7 CYP enzymes 
(CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5) was investigated in human liver 
microsomes (HLM). Assessment of DDI potential with gemtuzumab ozogamicin for reversible CYP 
inhibition, based on the IC50 values of >15 µM determined from in vitro studies and the mean 
steady-state total hP67.6 Cmax of 3280 ng/mL (0.0221 μM) after multiple dose administration of 9 
mg/m2 of gemtuzumab ozogamicin to humans, indicated a low potential for gemtuzumab ozogamicin to 
inhibit the activities of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4/5 (R1 value of 
<1.1, and Cmax/Ki <0.02).

The potential for N-Ac- γ -calicheamicin DMH to reversibly inhibit the catalytic activity of 7 CYP enzymes 
(CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5) was investigated in HLM. N-Ac- 
γ -calicheamicin DMH showed little or no reversible inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 with IC50 values >10 µM (highest concentration tested) and an estimated Ki of >5 
µM.  In vitro, N acetyl gamma calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide and gemtuzumab ozogamicin had a low 
potential to induce the activities of CYP3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations with IC50 values of 5.5, 
0.42, and 0.40 µM for testosterone 6β-hydroxylation, midazolam 1 γ -hydroxylation, and nifedipine 
oxidation, respectively. 
N-Ac- γ -calicheamicin DMH showed time-dependent inhibitory activity of CYP2C8 and CYP3A4/5 activity 
(as measured by testosterone 6β-hydroxylation and midazolam 1’-hydroxylation). N-Ac- γ -calicheamicin 
DMH showed very weak time-dependent inhibition of CYP2C8, with the concentration at half the maximal 
rate of enzyme inactivation (KI) of >30 μM; thus, definitive in vitro inactivation kinetic parameters could 
not be estimated; the KI and maximal rate of enzyme inactivation (kinact) parameters were 0.077 μM 
and 0.00368 min-1 for midazolam and 0.237 μM and 0.00434 min-1 for testosterone, respectively.  
Assessment of DDI potential with N-Ac- γ -calicheamicin DMH for time-dependent CYP3A4/5 inhibition, 
based on the inactivation parameters determined in vitro, a CYP3A4/5 kdeg value of 0.00032 min-1 ((16) 
(17)), and the mean steady-state unconjugated calicheamicin total Cmax of 5.81 ng/mL (0.00393 μM), 
indicates the potential for N-Ac- γ -calicheamicin DMH to inhibit CYP3A4/5 in a time-dependent manner at 
clinically relevant concentrations (R2 values of 1.22-1.56). However, assessment of DDI potential using 
the mean steady-state unbound Cmax for unconjugated calichemaicin, 0.000110 μM, indicated a low 
potential for N-Ac- γ -calicheamicin DMH to inhibit CYP3A4/5 in a time-dependent manner at clinically 
relevant concentrations (R values of 1.01-1.02). Moreover, mechanistic static modeling of the effect of 
N-Ac- γ -calicheamicin DMH on the CYP3A4/5 substrate midazolam indicated a low potential for N-Ac- γ 
-calicheamicin DMH to inhibit CYP3A4/5 in a time-dependent manner at clinically relevant concentrations, 
with an estimated midazolam AUCR value of 1.02. 
Potential Induction of CYP Enzymes 
Gemtuzumab ozogamicin did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 in 3 lots of cryopreserved human 
hepatocytes at concentrations .50x the Cmaxof total hP67.6 antibody in patients after multiple dose 
administration of 3 mg/m2 gemtuzumab ozogamicin (0.00426 μM). These results indicate that the 
potential for gemtuzumab ozogamicin to induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4 is low at clinically relevant 
concentrations. 
N-Ac- γ -calicheamicin DMH did not cause induction of CYP3A4 in the transfected HepG2 cells up to 0.090 
µM (highest concentration evaluated). N-Ac- γ -calicheamicin DMH had a low potential to inhibit the  
CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4 mRNA expression and/or enzyme activity in any of the 3 hepatocyte lots 
evaluated at up to 0.3 µM of N-Ac- γ -calicheamicin DMH (highest concentration evaluated). In humans, 
the mean steady-state unbound Cmax of unconjugated calicheamicin multiple dose administration of 9 
mg/m2 gemtuzumab ozogamicin was 0.000110 µM. 
Potential Inhibition of UGT Enzymes 
In the presence or absence of 2% Bovine serum albumin (BSA), N-Ac- γ -calicheamicin DMH showed little 
or no reversible inhibition of UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 catalyzed activities (IC50 >10 μM). 
However, N-Ac- γ -calicheamicin DMH inhibited UGT1A1 activity with IC50 values of 0.61 and 1.4 μM, in 
the absence or presence of 2% BSA, respectively. The unbound IC50 value could not be determined due 
to instability of N-Ac- γ –calicheamicin DMH in the 5 hour in vitro HLM-BSA binding assay. 
Assessments based on the comparison of the IC50 (total) and unconjugated calicheamicin Cmax values 
(0.00393 μM and 0.000110 μM for total and unbound, respectively after multiple dose administration of 
Assessment report  
EMA/155284/2018  
Page 58/138 
 
 
 
 
 
9 mg/m2 of gemtuzumab ozogamicin to humans indicated a low likelihood of DDI involving N-Ac- γ 
–calicheamicin DMH and the evaluated UGT enzymes (R1 value of <1.1, and total or unbound Cmax to Ki 
values <0.02). 
Effect on drug transporter substrates  
In vitro, N acetyl gamma calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide had a low potential to inhibit the activities of 
P gp, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), bile salt export pump (BSEP), multidrug resistance 
associated protein (MRP) 2, multidrug and toxin extrusion protein (MATE)1 and MATE2K, organic anion 
transporter (OAT)1 and OAT3, organic cation transporter (OCT)1 and OCT2, and organic anion 
transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1 and OATP1B3 at clinically relevant concentrations. 
Efflux Transporters 
The potential interaction of N-Ac- γ -calicheamicin DMH (over a concentration range of 0.002 to 0.3 μM) 
with efflux transporters P-gp and BCRP was investigated in vitro in MDCKII-MDR1 cells and MDCKII low 
efflux cells expressing the BCRP transporter (MDCKII-LE-BCRP) using the prototypical substrates digoxin 
(10 μM) and pitavastatin (0.5 μM) for the respective efflux transporters. 
Results indicate a low potential for an interaction between N-Ac- γ -calicheamicin DMH and P-gp and BCRP 
at clinically relevant concentrations (mean steady-state total and unbound Cmax values of unconjugated 
calicheamicin of 0.00393 μM and 0.000110 μM, respectively. The ratio of total Cmax/Ki was <0.1, and 
50x the unbound Cmax did not exceed the estimated Ki value of >0.15 μM. 
Hepatic Uptake Transporters 
N-Ac- γ -calicheamicin DMH, at a concentration range of 0.00005 to 0.1 μM, was evaluated for its 
potential to inhibit the human hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 expressed in human 
embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells using pravastatin (10 μM) and rosuvastatin (5 μM), respectively, as the 
prototypical probe substrates. 
N-Ac- γ -calicheamicin DMH inhibited the OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated transport of pravastatin and 
rosuvastatin, respectively, in a concentration-dependent manner. Inhibition of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 at 
the highest concentration of N-Ac- γ -calicheamicin DMH evaluated (0.1 μM) was 30% and 16%, 
respectively, while rifamycin SV (100 μM, positive control inhibitor) inhibited the transport of pravastatin 
and rosuvastatin by 98% and 57%, respectively. The IC50 of N-Ac- γ -calicheamicin DMH-mediated 
inhibition of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 was estimated to be >0.1 μM, and the Ki was estimated to be >0.05 
μM.  
Results indicate a low potential for an interaction between N-Ac- γ -calicheamicin DMH and these two 
transporters at clinically relevant concentrations (mean steady-state total and unbound Cmax values of 
unconjugated calicheamicin of 0.00393 μM and 0.000110 μM, respectively. The ratio of total Cmax/IC50 
was <0.1, and 50x the unbound Cmax did not exceed the estimated Ki value of >0.05 μM. 
Renal Uptake Transporters 
The inhibitory potency of N-Ac- γ -calicheamicin DMH for the human renal transporters, OAT1, OAT3, and 
OCT2, was assessed using HEK293 cells over-expressing each transporter with [3H]p-aminohippurate (2 
μM), [3H]estrone-3-sulfate (0.2 μM), and [14C]metformin (10 μM) as the respective probe substrates. 
Inhibition was evaluated at an N-Ac- γ -calicheamicin DMH concentration range of 0.002 to 0.5 μM for 
OAT1 and at a concentration range of 0.0004 to 0.1 μM for OAT3 and OCT2. 
N-Ac- γ -calicheamicin DMH, over the concentrations evaluated, did not inhibit OAT1, OAT3, or OCT2, 
while the positive control inhibitors (probenecid for OAT1 and OAT3 and verapamil for OCT2) inhibited the 
Assessment report

activity for these transporters by >95%. The IC50 of N-Ac- γ -calicheamicin DMH-mediated transporter 
inhibition was estimated to be >0.5 μM (Ki >0.25 μM) for OAT1 and >0.1 μM (Ki >0.05 μM) for OAT3 and 
OCT2. 
A low potential for an interaction between N-Ac- γ -calicheamicin DMH and OAT1, OAT3, OCT2 
transporters at clinically relevant concentrations (mean steady-state total and unbound Cmax values of 
unconjugated calicheamicin of 0.00393 μM and 0.000110 μM, respectively) has been observed. The ratio 
of unbound Cmax/IC50 was <0.1, and 50x the unbound Cmax did not exceed the estimated Ki value of 
>0.05 to >0.25 μM. 
No formal clinical DDI studies have been conducted, or are planned, to evaluate the PK of GO in patients 
in combination with other drugs.

Immunogenicity 
In clinical studies of Mylotarg in patients with relapsed or refractory AML, the immunogenicity of 
MYLOTARG was evaluated using 2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Patients in the Phase 
2 trials did not develop antidrug antibodies (ADAs) and 2 patients in a Phase 1 trial developed antibodies 
against the calicheamicin-linker complex, 1 of whom had reduced hP67.6 plasma concentrations. Overall, 
the incidence rate of ADA development after Mylotarg treatment was < 1% across the 4 clinical studies 
(Study 101, 201, 202, 203) with ADA data (SmPC section 4.8). 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No clinical pharmacodynamic studies were submitted.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Pharmacodynamic data supportive to the suggested mechanism of action have been submitted. 
Several single-agent studies measured target CD33 saturation post-GO dose in patients with relapsed 
and refractory AML, including: Study 101, the initial dose-escalation study, wherein GO was administered 
by IV at doses ranging from 0.25 mg/m² to 9 mg/m²; Study 102, a dose escalation study in paediatric 
patients with AML, wherein GO doses ranged from 6 to 9 mg/m2; Study 103, a dose escalation study in 
Japanese patients with AML, where GO doses ranged from 6 to 9 mg/m2; and Phase 2 Studies 201, 202, 
and 203, where GO was administered at 9 mg/m2. Across all studies, near maximal peripheral CD33 
saturation was observed post-GO dose at all dose levels of 2 mg/m² and above. Furthermore, by fitting a 
simple Emax to the CD33 saturation data from dose escalation Study 101, which included GO doses 
ranging from 0.25 mg/m² to 9 mg/m2 the estimated ED50 value was approximately 0.2 mg/m2 
corresponding to an ED90 of 1.6 mg/m2 and an ED95 of 3.3 mg/m2.  
An exposure-response analysis was conducted (PMAR-EQDD-B176asNDA-491) using PK, PD, and efficacy 
data from 8 previous Wyeth studies, and also data from study ALFA-0701, where the PK data for the 
fractionated dosing regimen were simulated using the population PK model.  
Figure 2 shows the prediction probabilities for the final models for CR/CRp using cumulative AUC and 
overall Cmax, respectively.

An exposure-response analysis was conducted using PK and safety data from 8 Wyeth studies, and also 
data from Study ALFA-0701, where the PK data for the fractionated dosing regimen were simulated using 
the population PK model (PMAR-EQDDB176a-sNDA-491). On the basis of the incidence and severity of 
treatment-related adverse events (AEs) following treatment with GO, 7 safety terms were selected as the 
safety endpoints of interest for exposure-response analysis: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated 
AST, elevated bilirubin, hypoalbuminemia, elevated alkaline phosphatase, and hepatic VOD. 
A significant exposure-response relationship was found between the Cmax of hP67.6 antibody occurring 
after the first dose of GO and elevated bilirubin, hypoalbuminemia, and elevated AST. However, no 
Assessment report

relationship was found between either overall Cmax or overall AUC and VOD occurring within 28 days 
after any GO dose (PMAR-EQDD-B176asNDA-491). The stepwise logistic regression analysis, which 
included VOD observed at any time (ie, not restricted to within 28 days after any dose of GO), did not 
show a relationship between VOD and the dose of GO; however, that analysis did not include PK results, 
which were quite variable, with 62% geometric %CV for Cmax and 136% geometric %CV for AUCinf at 
the 9 mg/m2 dose level. The combination of GO with AraC and DNR did not have a significant effect on the 
incidence of VOD. 
Most patients that reached remission or blast-free status experienced Grade 4 neutropenia, Grade 4 
thrombocytopenia, and Grade 4 leukopenia. PK/PD modeling was conducted to characterize the 
relationship between plasma concentrations of hP67.6 and the time course of neutropenia and 
thrombocytopenia (PMAR-EQDD-B176asNDA-491). 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Based on a population PK analysis, age, race, and gender did not significantly affect gemtuzumab 
ozogamicin disposition (SmPC section 5.2). No dose adjustment is required in elderly patients (≥  65 
years (SmPC section 4.2).  
The results of the population modelling showed that the PK behaviour of gemtuzumab ozogamicin 
(hP67.6 antibody and unconjugated calicheamicin) is similar between adult and paediatric AML patients 
following the 9 mg/m2 dosing regimen (SmPC section 5.2).  
The safety and efficacy of Mylotarg in patients less than 15 years of age has not been established. No 
recommendation on a posology can be made (SmPC section 4.2). 
Pharmacokinetic data using the proposed posology supporting the use in adult patients is solely based on 
PK modelling. The population PK model for gemtuzumab ozogamicin and unconjugated calicheamicin in 
adult AML patients showed that allometric exponentials are appropriate and therefore a BSA-based 
dosing approach is justified. In addition, a population PK model for paediatric AML subjects (down to 2 
years old of age) showed that no factors other than body weight appeared to significantly impact the PK 
of total antibody or unconjugated calicheamicin. Allomeric scaling on CL and volume of distribution 
accounted for the wide range of age and body size in the in the overall paediatric population (2-17 years). 
Similar to adults, BSA-based dosing would hence also be recommended in adolescents age 15-17 years of 
age. Overall, there is no scientific rational to assume that adolescents between 15-17 years of age 
experience different exposure levels, nor is there any rationale to assume that, based on similar 
exposure, this would result in a clinically meaningful response difference in patients with CD33-positive 
de novo AML treated in line with the adult 3+7 induction chemotherapy backbone in combination with 
Mylotarg.  
No formal PK studies of gemtuzumab ozogamicin have been conducted in patients with hepatic 
impairment. Based on a population PK analysis, the clearance of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (hP67.6 
antibody and unconjugated calicheamicin) is not expected to be affected by mild hepatic impairment 
status, as defined by National Cancer Institute Organ Dysfunction Working Group (NCI ODWG). The 
analysis included 406 patients in the following NCI ODWG impairment status categories: mild (B1, n=58 
and B2, n=19), moderate (C, n=6), and normal hepatic function (n=322) (SmPC section 5.2). No 
adjustment of the starting dose is required in patients with hepatic impairment defined by total bilirubin 
≤  2 × upper limit of normal (ULN) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT) ≤  2.5 × ULN. Mylotarg should be postponed until recovery of total bilirubin to ≤  2 × ULN and AST 
and ALT to ≤  2.5 × ULN prior to each dose (SmPC section 4.2).

No formal PK studies of gemtuzumab ozogamicin have been conducted in patients with renal impairment.  
Based on a population PK analysis in 406 patients, the clearance of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in patients 
with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CLcr] 60-89 mL/min; n=149) or moderate renal 
impairment (CLcr 30 59 mL/min; n=47), was similar to patients with normal renal function (CLcr ≥ 90 
mL/min; n=209). The PK of gemtuzumab ozogamicin has not been studied in patients with severe renal 
impairment (SmPC section 5.2). No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate renal 
impairment. Mylotarg has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment. Mylotarg does not 
undergo renal clearance, the pharmacokinetics in patients with severe renal impairment is unknown 
(SmPC section 4.2). 
No formal drug-interaction studies have been performed with GO (SmPC section 4.5). In vitro, 
N-acetyl gamma calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide is primarily metabolised via nonenzymatic reduction. 
Therefore, coadministration of gemtuzumab ozogamicin with inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome 
P450 (CYP) or uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) drug metabolising enzymes are 
unlikely to alter exposure to N-acetyl gamma calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide (SmPC section 5.2).  
Based on population PK analyses, the combination of gemtuzumab ozogamicin with hydroxyurea, DNR, 
and AraC is not predicted to cause clinically meaningful changes in the PK of hP67.6 or unconjugated 
calicheamicin(SmPC section 5.2).   
N-acetyl gamma calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide and gemtuzumab ozogamicin had a low potential to 
inhibit the activities of CYP1A2, CYP2A6 (tested only using gemtuzumab ozogamicin), CYP2B6, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5 at clinically relevant concentrations. In vitro, 
N-acetyl gamma calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide and gemtuzumab ozogamicin had a low potential to 
induce the activities of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations (SmPC section 
5.2).   
In vitro, N-acetyl gamma calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide had a low potential to inhibit the activities of 
UGT1A1, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 at clinically relevant concentrations (SmPC section 
5.2).   
In vitro, N-acetyl gamma calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide had a low potential to inhibit the activities of 
P-gp, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), bile salt export pump (BSEP), multidrug resistance 
associated protein (MRP) 2, multidrug and toxin extrusion protein (MATE)1 and MATE2K, organic anion 
transporter (OAT)1 and OAT3, organic cation transporter (OCT)1 and OCT2, and organic anion 
transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1 and OATP1B3 at clinically relevant concentrations (SmPC section 
5.2).   
Based on population pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses, the combination of gemtuzumab ozogamicin with 
DNR and AraC is not predicted to cause clinically meaningful changes in the PK of these agents (SmPC 
section 5.2).   
Saturation of a high percentage of CD33 antigenic sites is presumed to be required for maximum delivery 
of calicheamicin to leukaemic blast cells. Several single agent studies measured target (CD33) saturation 
post-MYLOTARG dose in patients with relapsed and refractory AML. Across all studies, near maximal 
peripheral CD33 saturation was observed post-MYLOTARG dose at all dose levels of 2 mg/m² and above, 
suggesting that a low dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin is sufficient to bind all available CD33 sites (SmPC, 
section 5.1).  
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. Definitive conclusions cannot be 
drawn between the presence of antibodies and potential impact on efficacy and safety due to the limited 
number of patients with positive ADAs. The detection of ADAs is highly dependent on the sensitivity and 
specificity of the assay. The incidence of antibody positivity in an assay may be influenced by several 
Assessment report  
EMA/155284/2018  
Page 64/138 
 
 
 
 
 
factors, including assay methodology, circulating gemtuzumab ozogamicin concentrations, sample 
handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant treatments and underlying disease. For these reasons, 
comparison of incidence of antibodies to gemtuzumab ozogamicin with the incidence of antibodies to 
other products may be misleading (SmPC section 4.8). Mylorarg will be administered to patients who are 
going to be immunosuppressed over the course of the treatment, with little meaningful clinical impact 
expected; taking into consideration that Mylotarg seems not to be very immunogenic (<1%).The CHMP 
recommended the applicant to evaluate immunogenicity of the batches intended for licensing as part of 
post-marketing commitment. Immunogenicityhas been classified as a potential risk in the Risk 
Management Plan (see discussion on clinical safety). 
While the PK of gemtuzumab ozogamicin has been well-characterised over a wide range of doses, there 
is no confirmation of the proposed dose and it’s PK in the target population. The pharmacokinetics of 
gemtuzumab ozogamicin and unconjugated calicheamicin in patients with AML has been described using 
a population PK model, with the pharmacokinetics following the proposed gemtuzumab ozogamicin dose 
simulated in the target population. The CHMP recommended the applicant to evaluate gemtuzumab 
ozogamicin metabolites as part of the planned additional PK study mentioned below. 
The lack of secondary PD data, particularly on QT interval prolongation is reflected as missing information 
in the RMP, however and the CHMP recommended the applicant to evaluate the effect of GO on QTc as 
described in the planned clinical study with the fractionated regimen (see Risk Management Plan). 
The lack of comprehensive data related to AML genetics such as hierarchy of the leukaemic population, 
drug efflux intensity in relation to pharmacodynamics and clinical response is unfortunate. The applicant 
provided additional literature to substantiate this lack of information, based on which the applicant agreed 
to add the requirement for CD33-positive AML to the indication (see discussion on clinical efficacy).  
Based on the above, the CHMP recommended the applicant to conduct a study in patients with relapsed/ 
refractory CD33-positive AML, using single agent Mylotarg to allow for the collection of additional PK, 
exposure-response, QTc and anti-drug antibody (ADA) data using the current, batches of Mylotarg.   
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The PK of gemtuzumab ozogamicin has been reasonably well investigated. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Mylotarg was initially developed as monotherapy for patients with AML in first relapse. The initial single 
agent dosing recommendation was 9 mg/m², infused over a 2-hour period, with a total of 2 doses with a 
14 days treatment free interval. This dosing schedule had been chosen based on the results from the dose 
escalation phase 1 study 101, during which the dose was not escalated beyond 9 mg/m2 because of 
myelosuppression, even though no prospectively defined dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) had been 
encountered.  
Study 205 then evaluated the MTD for Mylotarg in combination with AraC to be 6 and 4 mg/m² on Days 
1 and 8, respectively, plus AraC 100 mg/m² × 7 days. Study 206 confirmed the MTD for Mylotarg in 
combination with 3+7 induction chemotherapy to be 6 mg/m² plus AraC 100 mg/m²/day and DNR 45 
mg/m². Both studies were conducted including patients with de novo AML.  
Assessment report  
EMA/155284/2018  
Page 65/138 
 
 
 
 
 
MyloFrance 1 study further evaluated the fractionated Mylotarg dosing regimen in combination. 
MyloFrance 1 was a multicentre phase 2 uncontrolled trial to assess the safety of fractionated doses of 
GO, given at a dose of 3 mg/m2 on days 1, 4 and 7 (max of 5mg per dose) in adult patients age 18 and 
above with CD33-positive AML in first relapse.  There were no signs of prolonged myelosuppression. 
During the treatment period, grade 3 TEAEs that occurred in >1% patients included sepsis (31.5%), fever 
(15.8%), rash (10.5%), pneumonia (7%), bleeding (7%), mucositis (3.5%), diarrhea (1.75%), 
headaches (1.75%), tachycardia (1.75%) and oedema (1.75%). No grade 4 toxicity was observed. No 
infectious deaths occurred. No grade 3 or 4 liver toxicity was observed. No episodes of VOD occurred. The 
efficacy results were comparable to Phase 1 data using the 9 mg/m2 dose.  
MyloFrance 2 study (18) was a multicentre Phase 1/2 dose escalation study aimed to determine the 
optimal doses of daunorubicin and cytarabine in combination with fractionated doses of Mylotarg (3 
mg/m2 on day 1, 4, and 7) in patients age 50–70years with CD33-positive AML in first relapse and 
adequate PS (ECOG 0-1) and organ function. The primary endpoint was to determine the MTD for DNR 
and AraC doses in combination with 3 mg/m2 GO on days 1, 4, and 7 (max of 5mg per dose), among three 
different dose schedules, namely (45, 100), (60, 100), and (60, 200) mg/m2. A total of 20 patients were 
included; no DLT was observed in neither of the three dose levels even after expanding the third dose 
level to an additional four patients. One grade 4 liver toxicity was observed in the second dose cohort and 
one grade 3 liver toxicity in the third, but all considered not related to the chemotherapy, but to events of 
sepsis. The highest tested dose level of DNR 60 mg/m2 x 3 days and AraC 200 mg/m2 for 7 days was 
considered tolerable in combination with the low dose fractioned Mylotarg.  CR was obtained in 11/20 
patients, CRp in two patients and PR in one patient. A total of 4 patients experienced disease progression. 
There were 2 early deaths, one from infection and one from disease progression. 
Furthermore, analyses of the different GO dosing regimens (3 mg/m2 single dose, 3×3 mg/m2 
fractionated and 6 mg/m2 single dose) during induction for the following safety endpoint (30-day and 
60-day mortality, haemorrhage, infections, hepatotoxicity and haematotoxicity) showed that the single 
dose of 6 mg/m² resulted in a significant increase early mortality, however, the 3x3 mg/m² fractionated 
GO regimen showed similar 30-day and 60-day mortality rates than the single 3 mg/m² GO regimen. The 
risk of Grade 3/4 Haemorrhage, Grade 3/4 infections and hepatotoxicity seems not increased with the 3x3 
mg/m² fractionated Mylotarg regimen compared to single 3 mg/m² or 6 mg/m². The risk of persistent 
neutropenia was not increased by the addition of GO to the intensive chemotherapy, but the risk of 
persistent thrombocytopenia increased with the 3x3 mg/m² fractionated regimen. 
Regarding the single dose of Mylotarg administered during the 2 courses of consolidation, this didn’t 
result in cumulative toxicity; certainly not for those who tolerate GO during induction. 
Overall this confirmed the 3x3 mg/m2 fractionated GO dosing regimen in combination with DNR 60 
mg/m2 x 3 days and AraC 200 mg/m2 for 7 days to be tolerable with comparable efficacy results to Phase 
1 data using the 9 mg/m2 dose.  
2.6.  Main study – ALFA0701 
Methods 
This was a multicenter, randomized,comparative phase 3 study of fractionated doses of the monoclonal 
antibody gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg) in addition to daunorubicin + cytarabine versus 
daunorubicin + cytarabine alone  for induction and consolidation therapy in patients with acute myeloid 
leukemia aged 50 to 70 years.

Figure 4 Study scheme (ALFA0701) 
Premedication, including Polaramine (dexchlorpheniramine) ± Solumedrol (methylprednisolone) 1 
mg/kg, was required 1 hour before the GO infusion and could be repeated if needed. Mylotarg infusion 
was performed under close clinical monitoring, including pulse, blood pressure, and temperature, and 
was to be interrupted if patients experienced dyspnoea or clinically significant hypotension. 
In case of hyperleukocytic AML (leukocyte count >30,000/mm3), rasburicase or allopurinol was 
administered for prevention of tumour lysis syndrome. It was also recommended to postpone Mylotarg 
administration and to perform leukoreduction with oral hydroxyurea first, to administer only AraC for 2 
days before administering DNR and GO according to the usual regimen. 
Salvage therapy: 
Patients who did not receive the second course of induction therapy and did not achieve a CR after the first 
course of induction could receive a salvage course comprised of Idarubicin + AraC as long as the patient 
had an ECOG PS <3 and a creatinine clearance >30 mL/min. Salvage therapy consisted of: 
• 
Idarubicin 12 mg/m2 on Day 1 and Day 2 
•  AraC 1 g/m2 × 2/day on Days 1 to 4  
•  G-CSF starting on Day 6 
Patients who did not respond to induction therapy (including salvage course) discontinued the study.  
Allogeneic transplant 
Patients who experienced CR could be considered for allogeneic transplant. Patients with favourable and 
intermediate I cytogenetic and molecular risk categories were not sent for transplant in first CR. Whereas 
patients with intermediate II or unfavourable cytogenetic and molecular risk categories with a CR were 
considered for transplant if qualified. An interval of 2 months between the last dose of Mylotarg and 
transplant was recommended. The type of pre-transplant conditioning chemotherapy was left to the 
discretion of the treating centre.  
A protocol amendment in December 2009 added that GO should not be used during consolidation in 
patients with a platelet count <100,000/mm3 by Day 45 after the initiation of chemotherapy.

Patients who experienced CR could be considered for allogeneic transplant. Patients with favourable and 
intermediate I cytogenetic and molecular risk categories were not sent for transplant in first CR. An 
interval of 2 months between the last dose of Mylotarg and transplant was recommended. In that respect 
is noted that publications recommend an even longer interval between last Mylotarg dose and HSCT, ie 3 
month (18). Nonetheless, the chosen interval was based on investigators’ recommendation. The type of 
pre-transplant conditioning chemotherapy was left to the discretion of the treating centre. 
Evaluation schedule/ Follow-up 
Clinical and haematological responses were assessed after induction, before each course of consolidation 
and at one to two months after hematologic recovery from the last cycle of consolidation therapy. Full 
blood count (FBC) was assessed 1) at the pre-treatment evaluation, 2) three times per week during 
induction and consolidation, and 3) at the end of treatment visit. The BMA was done 1) on day 15 after 
start of treatment, 2) after haematological recovery from each course of therapy (at least 7 days after end 
of G-CSF treatment) or just before each cycle of consolidation therapy, and 3) at the end of treatment 
visit. 
Patients were evaluated after hematologic recovery every 1 to 2 months from the last cycle of 
consolidation therapy while still in CR/CRp for 2 years, after which the evaluation visits were extended to 
every 6 months. At the time of relapse, both FBC and BMA results were collected. All patients were 
followed until death. 
Objectives 
Primary objective was to compare the efficacy of DNR + AraC + Mylotarg (GO arm) versus DNR + AraC 
(control arm), as measured by event-free survival (EFS).  
Secondary objectives included comparison of the following between the GO arm and control arm: 
•  CR and CRp rates. Definition of CR: 
o Absence of leukemic blast cells in blood and disappearance of all tumours. 
o Percentage of marrow blast cells < 5% after morphological study of bone marrow aspiration. 
o Haemoglobin > 9 g/dL, platelets > 100,000/mm, Neutrophils > 1000/mm and no need for 
transfusion. 
A patient will be considered in CRp if all the above criteria are satisfied with the exception of platelet count 
> 100,000/mm3. 
•  Relapse rate 
•  Duration of remission, as measured by relapse-free survival (RFS) 
•  Overall survival (OS) 
•  Safety profile of Mylotarg in addition to chemotherapy in comparison with the control arm. 
• 
Predictors of response: multi drug resistance (MDR) proteins, cytogenetic risk categories, 
mutation or overexpression of FLT3, MLL, CEBPa, NPM genes. 
•  Relationship between residual disease levels measured by WT1 or NPM1 transcript levels (in 
NPM+ patients) at M1, M3 and M6 and length of remission.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint was EFS defined as the time from date of randomisation to date of induction failure, 
relapse, or death due to any cause, whichever came first.  
The date of induction failure was the date of evaluation of bone marrow response after the last induction 
cycle if a CR (by investigator assessment) had not been achieved.  
The definition of CR was: 
•  Absence of leukemic blast cells in peripheral blood and no investigator report of extramedullary, 
molecular, or cytogenetic disease 
•  Blast cells <5% in BMA with no Auer rods 
•  Neutrophils >1000/mm3, platelets >100,000/mm3, and transfusion independent 
A patient was considered in CRp if all the above criteria were satisfied with the exception of platelet count 
>100,000/mm3; however, the eCRF did not distinguish between CR or CRp, thus, all responder patients 
were assessed as CR/CRp. For patients who experienced a post-induction CR, the IRC reviewers 
determined whether (and if so, when) relapse had occurred, as indicated by any of the following: 
•  Presence of ≥ 5% blasts in BMA or presence of Auer rods 
•  Blasts in the FBC not attributable to BM recovery following chemotherapy or G-CSF  
• 
Investigator report of extramedullary disease, molecular or cytogenetic disease 
Study investigators assessed and classified disease progression in accordance with the International 
Working Group criteria (19). 
Secondary endpoints 
−  Overall Survival defined as the time from date of randomisation to date of death due to any cause. 
−  Relapse-Free Survival defined for patients experiencing CR or CRp as the time from the date of 
remission to the date of relapse or death from any cause, whichever came first. For the primary 
analysis, the date of relapse determined by individual investigators was used to define the RFS.  
−  Hematologic Response. Responses were determined based on investigator’s assessment. A 
patient was considered in complete remission (CR) by the investigator if the following conditions 
were all met: 
•  Leukemic blasts absent from the peripheral blood and no clinical tumours; 
•  Percentage of blasts in the bone marrow is <5%, as measured by morphologic studies 
(aspirates); 
•  Haemoglobin >9 g/dL, platelets >100,000/mm3, ANC > 1000/mm3; 
•  The patient is red cell and platelet transfusion independent. 
−  Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) as measured by WT1 expression for post baseline samples was  
defined as negative if the WT1/ABLx100 (%)is <ULN (ULN is 0.5% for peripheral blood samples 
and 2.5% for bone marrow samples). Peripheral blood samples were classified as positive if the 
Assessment report  
EMA/155284/2018  
Page 70/138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ratio (%) was ≥0.5. Bone marrow samples were classified as positive if the ratio (%) was ≥2.5. 
MRD status as measured by WT1 expression for post baseline samples was based on peripheral 
blood samples. Minimal Residual Disease as assessed by detection of mutated NPM1 transcripts 
by RT-qPCR was classified as positive if NPM1mut/Abl transcripts x 100 (%) was ≥0.1% (0.1% 
was the quantitative detection limit of the assay) for peripheral blood and bone marrow samples. 
MRD status as assessed by detection of mutated NPM1 transcripts for post baseline samples was 
based on bone marrow samples. 
Sample size 
Event-free survival at 3 years was assumed to be 25% in the control arm and 40% (HR=0.66 based on an 
underlying exponential distribution) in the experimental arm. Assuming a type I error of 5% (2-sided) and 
a type II error of 20% for 80% power, a sample size of 140 patients was required in each treatment arm 
(total of 280 patients), in order to obtain a total of 184 events required for EFS analysis. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either standard induction therapy with DNR + 
AraC without (control arm) or with Mylotarg (GO arm).  
Randomization was centralized, and stratified by center. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study treatment was not blinded to patients or treating investigators. The IRC reviewers were blinded 
to the treatment arms.  
Statistical methods 
The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population was the primary population for evaluating efficacy 
endpoints and patient characteristics. The mITT population included all patients who were randomized, 
unless consent was withdrawn prior to the start of treatment. 
The as-treated (AT) population defined as all patients who received at least 1 dose of study medication 
and who were analysed according to the actual treatment received. 
Time-to-event endpoints were summarized using the Kaplan-Meier method and displayed graphically 
when appropriate. Two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for median time-to-event were estimated 
using the Brookmeyer-Crowley method with log-log transformation. Time-to-event endpoints were 
compared between the 2 treatment arms with 2-sided log-rank tests. The log-rank test was used for the 
primary analysis, and the stratified log-rank test was used for sensitivity analyses. HRs and the 
associated 2-sided 95% CIs were estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model. For sensitivity 
analyses, HRs were estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model stratified by key prognostic 
factors and adjusted by other baseline characteristics. 
For the primary EFS analyses, the following method to determine the event dates was used to define the 
EFS. 
Assessment report  
EMA/155284/2018  
Page 71/138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Primary (Method A) 
The date of the first documentation of induction failure based on investigator’s assessment, and the date 
of relapse based on investigator’s assessment, and death date, was used to define the EFS. The date of 
induction failure was considered as the date of evaluation of bone marrow response after the last 
induction cycle if complete remission per the investigator has not been achieved by that time.  
For sensitivity analyses, the following methods to determine the event dates were used to define the EFS. 
• Method A refers to the primary analysis, by investigator assessment and date of post induction 
assessment used as date of induction failure events. 
• Method B refers to independent review. 
• Method D refers to investigator assessment but uses the date of randomization as date of induction 
failure events. 
• 1 refers to the reference date of 01 August 2011. 
• 2 refers to the reference date of 30 April 2013. 
• 3 refers to the reference date of 01 August 2011, with censoring at the last assessment before the 
HSCT. 
The primary study endpoint was derived from investigator assessment. The retrospective efficacy data 
was reviewed by a blinded independent review committee (BIRC) in order to reduce possible bias 
introduced by the local investigators.

Protocol deviations 
Only major protocol deviations pertaining to eligibility criteria and dosing or randomisation errors were 
collected; identified during the retrospective data collection, monitoring visits or programmatically 
derived from the data collected. 
Major protocol deviations were reported in 139 patients; 8 patients had a treatment allocation deviation, 
30 patients had a GO dosing error, 68 patients had a chemotherapy dosing error, 2 patients had source 
data missing during retrospective data collection, and 31 patients had eligibility criteria deviations (copy 
of signed consent from not available at site (9 patients), cardiac function not within normal limits at the 
time of study entry (7 patients), not adequate hepatic and renal function (6 patients), other active 
malignant disease at the time of study entry (2 patients), serology positive for HIV, HBV, or HCV at the 
time of data entry (5 patients), uncontrolled infection at the major time of data entry (1 patient), 
randomisation mistake (1 patient). 19 patients were reported to have more than 1 major protocol 
deviation. The percentage of major protocol deviations per site varied from 0% (site 16; 2 patients 
recruited) to 100% (ie site 21; 1 patient recruited).

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis 
The IPD meta-analysis consisted of 5 randomised investigator-initiated research (IIR) studies, including 
the pivotal Study ALFA-0701 as well as 4 other studies (Medical Research Council [MRC] AML15, National 
Cancer Research Institute [NCRI] AML16, Southwest Oncology Group [SWOG] S0106, and Groupe Ouest 
Est d'Etude des Leucémies aiguës et Autres Maladies du Sang [GOELAMS] AML2006IR).  
The characteristics of the 5 selected trials are summarized in Table 28. 
Table 28 Trials Included in the Individual Patient Data Meta-Analysis 
Results 
A total of 3331 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Of these, 1663 patients (49.9%) were 
randomized to GO while 1668 patients (50.1%) were randomized to No GO. There were no 
post-randomization exclusions from the meta-analysis. The number of elderly patients age 60-69 
represented the majority (33.1%), but ranging from 7.7% of patients age 15-29 up to 10.7% of patients 
age 70 and older; with a total of 22 patients under the age of 18 years included. Sensitivity analysis 
indicated no difference due to age. Slightly more male patients were included (55.4%) and 93% of 
patients with a PS of 0 or 1; 88.1% were treated for de novo AML with 75.5% having had cytarabine, 
daunorubicin, and etoposide based chemotherapy; the majority were in the favourable/intermediate 
cytogenetic or ELN risk group (MRC cytogenetics 62.2% ; ELN 44.9% [62.2% imputed ELN], with 
negative FLT3 or NPM1 status; the minority (12.9%) had known CD33 expression <30%. However, the 
high percentage of data not known needs to be appreciated as well (ie ELN risk group 37.6%, imputed 
ELN 20.3%, FLT3 46.2%, NMP1 50.8%, CD33 positivity 47.5%).

Secondary efficacy endpoints 
The secondary endpoint of EFS was prolonged in the GO arm compared to No GO (OR 0.85, 95% CI: 
0.78-0.93, 2-sided stratified log-rank p=0.0002), corresponding to a 15% reduction in events, with no 
heterogeneity by dose or trial within dose group.  
In the GO arm, 1308 patients (78.7%) achieved an overall response, compared to 1285 (77.1%) in the 
No GO arm. The odds of achieving an Overall Response were not significantly increased in the GO arm (OR 
0.91, 95% CI: 0.77-1.08, p=0.3), or in any of the dose groups. 
In the GO arm, 1189 patients (71.5%) achieved a CR compared to 1166 patients (70.0%) in the No GO 
arm. GO treatment did not significantly increase the odds of achieving CR (OR 0.93, 95% CI: 0.80-1.08, 
p=0.3). 
Of the 1307 GO patients and 1284 No GO patients who achieved a response, 868 patients in the GO arm 
and 916 patients in the No GO arm relapsed or died during follow-up. Overall GO treatment was found to 
significantly prolong RFS compared to No GO (OR 0.84, 95% CI: 0.77-0.93, p=0.0004). 
Clinical impact of change in AAS levels – efficacy 
In a review of drug supply records the AAS status was identified for all GO lots used in the studies 
considered relevant for the Mylotarg development and submitted as either pivotal (ALFA0701) or within 
the IPD meta-analyses (Table 29). 
Table 29 Distribution of GO lots with elevated AAS by study 
Abbreviations: AAS=Amino acid substitution; ALFA=Acute Leukemia French Association; GO=Gemtuzumab ozogamicin; GOELAMS= 
Groupe Ouest Est d'Etude des Leucémies aiguës et Autres Maladies du Sang; MRC= Medical Research Council; NCRI=National Cancer 
Research Institute; SWOG= Southwest Oncology Group. 
In the current product, approximately 32% of the gemtuzumab molecules contain AAS. A retrospective 
analysis was undertaken to characterise the extent of exposure to GO with elevated AAS across the 
clinical development program, evaluating the potential impact of AAS on safety and efficacy of GO in the 
studies included in the meta-analysis. Data on the GO lot administered to individual patients is only 
Assessment report

available for the pivotal trial, with the AAS status either not known or unknown for at least one dose (AAS 
status unknown due to missing GO lot number) for 25% of the patients.  
The report analysed the following groups: 
•  Only elevated AAS GO group: all GO administrations came from lots with elevated AAS, and there 
were no infusions with an unknown GO lot,  
•  Only base AAS GO group: all GO administrations came from lots without elevated (ie, base) AAS, 
and there were no infusions with an unknown GO lot, 
•  Any elevated AAS GO group: at least 1 GO administration came from a lot with elevated AAS. 
Patients could have had infusions with an unknown GO lot. All patients in the only elevated AAS 
GO group are also included in this group.

Non Controlled trials 
Supportive studies 
Out of the 19 clinical trials submitted, the 5 studies included in the meta-analysis are considered 
supportive of the intended indication of treatment of patients with de novo AML, though only the ALFA of 
the proposed posology.  
The overall results of these 4 trials were that remission rates were not improved, although relapse was 
reduced in 4 of 5 trials with a significant survival benefit observed in NCRI trial AML16 comparing a single 
dose of GO (3 mg/m²) to induction chemotherapy, consisting of either DA 3+10 in Course 1 and 3+8 in 
Course 2 or DClo (DNR plus clofarabine) (data not shown). 
Paediatric Data 
In a randomised study (COG AAML0531) that evaluated standard chemotherapy alone or combined with 
Mylotarg in 1,022 newly diagnosed children (94.3% of patients < 18 years of age), and young adults 
(5.7% of patients); median age was 9.7 years (range: 0.003 29.8 years), patients with de novo AML were 
randomly assigned to either standard 5 course chemotherapy alone or to the same chemotherapy with 2 
doses of Mylotarg (3 mg/m2/dose) administered once in induction Course 1 and once in intensification 
Course 2. The study demonstrated that addition of Mylotarg to intensive chemotherapy improved EFS (3 
years: 53.1% versus 46.9%; HR 0.83; 95% CI: 0.70 0.99; p=0.04) in de novo AML owing to a reduced 
relapse risk, with a trend towards longer OS in the Mylotarg arm which was not statistically significant (3 
years: 69.4% versus 65.4%; HR 0.91; 95% CI: 0.74 1.13; p=0.39). However, it was also found that 
increased toxicity (post remission toxic mortality) was observed in patients with low risk AML which was

attributed to the prolonged neutropenia that occurred after receiving gemtuzumab ozogamicin during 
intensification Course 2. Thus, the optimal dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin for paediatric patients was 
not established (SmPC, section 5.1). 
Literature Review 
A systematic literature review was conducted with the aim to identify paediatric clinical trials involving GO 
as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy in order to obtain additional safety data.   
Published papers selected for review from the 376 articles fulfilled all of the following criteria: “Paediatric” 
or “children” in the title, written in English, GO administered in patients with AML, and each study enrolled 
and treated at least 10 patients.  Review articles, meeting abstracts, nonclinical studies, meta-analyses, 
case reports, and papers focusing on APL only were excluded from the literature review. Fifteen studies

children in these studies at 2.1, 5.5 and 8.9 years.  Five studies focused on children receiving a 
combination of GO with chemotherapy; 3 were in the previously untreated setting, one in relapsed

reported were represented by myelosuppression, infection, constitutional symptoms and liver enzyme 
alteration. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
ALFA trial 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria are generally acceptable. The fact that only patients age 50-70 were 
included is not considered an issue in view of the proposed target population, as it reflects a 
representative majority of patients with de novo AML eligible to undergo intensive chemotherapy with 
curative intent. The issue which consequently needed to be addressed in this context is what the 
acceptable lower age cut-off is for which extrapolation of efficacy is considered acceptable, assuming 
similar exposure levels and disease similarity (see discussion below). Patients were not required to be 
CD33-positive, but expression of CD33 will be a requirement for the intended indication considering the 
mechanism of action of Mylotarg. The chosen treatment schedule of induction/ consolidation therapy as 
Assessment report  
EMA/155284/2018  
Page 101/138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
add on to Mylotarg is considered standard of care for patients with de novo AML. The issue around the 
response assessment  being performed by the unblinded investigators involved in the treatment of the 
patients has been addressed by the introduction of a BIRC, though defined in retrospectively. 
The sample size is acceptable. The methods of analyses are also acceptable. However, for the primary 
endpoint the sensitivity analysis using the BIRC and most mature data set (ie April 2013) is the most 
appropriate and will therefore be the main focus.  
Major protocol deviations were recorded for almost 50% of all patients (139/280). A total of 22 patients 
(8%) had a major protocol deviation around lack of eligibility, slightly more in the control arm (7 patients 
GO arm; 15 control arm). Overall, this posed the question to whether trial documentation was according 
to protocol and raises concerns around the robustness of the primary data. However, the additional 
sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results observed. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Demographics and baseline characteristics were as expected for a de novo AML population age 50-70. 
There were no major discrepancies between the two groups apart from slightly more male (54.8% vs 
44.1%) and patients older than 60, respectively 65 years of age in the GO arm (71.9% vs 61.8%; 37% 
vs 29.4%). This can be considered to be in its favour, appreciating that elderly patients usually perform 
worse. The majority had a PS of 0-1 (87.8%) and favourable/intermediate risk AML as per NCCN/ELN 
criteria as well as according to cytogenetics. Genotyping revealed more patients with unfavourable 
genetics, but with almost 50% of data missing or unknown, which limits its usefulness. Patient numbers 
were equally balanced during induction. More patients in the control arm needed a second course of 
induction (34 vs 19). This could be a sign of early efficacy or due to a higher number of patients with 
resistant disease in the control arm (discontinuation due to resistant disease in the control arm 26 vs 17 
patients in GO). Patients receiving one, respectively two courses of consolidation were also equally 
balanced across arms. The different follow-up interventions used for patients (with at least 1 follow-up), 
particularly consolidation regimens for those in CR/CRp were equally distributed between the control and 
investigational arm either (all GO 27.3% vs control 28%; consolidation GO 19.1% vs control 18%), with 
no impact expected on EFS. 
The primary efficacy analysis, investigators review and data cut of August 2011 showed an EFS difference 
of 7.8 months (HR 0.562; 95% CI: 0.415-0.762; 2-sided p=0.0002), corresponding to a 44% reduction 
in the risk of an event for patients in the GO arm. These results were consistent when stratified by NCCN 
or ELN classification. Additional sensitivity analyses, derived by using BIRC data, different censoring and 
more mature data cut off dates were consistent with the primary analysis, but less compelling. Using the 
most conservative analysis performed, (BIRC and most mature data set - April 2013), the HR was 0.705 
(95% CI [0.536-0.928]; p= 0.0161), when stratified according to ELN. Additional sensitivity analyses 
confirmed the robustness of the primary endpoint, including analysis using data from the BIRC, with 
latest data cut off, salvage therapy classified as induction failure and the date of randomisation as date of 
induction failure event (according to Guideline EMA/CHMP/205/95 Rev.5).  
Regarding the secondary endpoints, RFS confirmed a statistical significant difference in favour of the GO 
arm (HR 0.656, 95% CI [0.466, 0.922], p= 0.02480) stratified for ELN risk category.  Response rate, 
including early response (CR/CRp at Day 15 as part of a post hoc analyses), and most importantly OS did 
not show any statistically significant difference. Survival data are available up to April 20130 and can be 
considered mature.  
Overall, the efficacy results from the pivotal trial supported by the meta-analysis showed that Mylotarg 
added to induction chemotherapy improved EFS through prolongation of remission following initial 
Assessment report  
EMA/155284/2018  
Page 102/138 
 
 
 
 
 
chemotherapy, rather than increasing the number of patients who achieve complete remission, as 
confirmed by the absence of a statistically significant difference in the ORR. Subgroup analyses of EFS 
indicated a more encouraging treatment effect with the Mylotarg combination in patients with 
favourable/intermediate risk cytogenetics (HR 0.591; 95% CI (0.407, 0.857), p= 0.0047; vs 
unfavourable HR 1.08). Reflecting on the differences observed for the different risk groups, it can be 
hypothesised that patients with adverse cytogenetics who receive fractioned low dose of Mylotarg seem 
to exhibit less deep responses, translating into shorter, not statistically significant periods of remission. It 
can be argued that, based on distinct biological characteristics, with the pathophysiological route causes 
yet to be fully elucidated, the hard-to-treat poor cytogenetic patient group is less susceptible to Mylotarg 
based induction chemotherapy.  Adequate wording has been added in section 4.4 of the SmPC to reflect 
on the need to individually consider the benefit/risk profile in patients, particularly with adverse 
cytogenetics, once results become available.  
The results of the IPD meta-analysis showed a statistically significant difference in terms of the secondary 
endpoint of EFS, for the subgroup of adverse risk cytogenetics. This is in addition to RFS, not statistically 
significant, but showing a supportive trend of benefit in patients with adverse cytogenetics. While it is 
agreed that the total numbers of the meta-analysis which include all risk groups, are supportive of a 
survival benefit, the differences in the sub-groups are evident in the meta-analysis and broadly consistent 
with the pivotal trial, showing no benefit of Mylotarg treatment in patients with adverse risk cytogenetics 
(OR of 1), as opposed to the favourable/ intermediate risk group.  
Additionally, it must be emphasized that APL is not included in the pivotal trial and this has been reflected 
in the indication.  
AML is a heterogeneous disease, stratified into different disease risk groups. There are also additional 
established independent risk factors, such as age, which is a poor risk factor in adults, associated with 
higher rates of poor risk cytogenetics. Efficacy for the intended indication for patients less than 50 years 
of age is based on full extrapolation, as the pivotal ALFA trial only recruited patients age 50-70 years. It 
is agreed that Mylotarg is considered to have a positive benefit/risk in all patients with newly diagnosed 
CD33-positive AML age 18 and above. This is based on disease similarity, acknowledging that any 
associated (known or unknown) biological differences due to age do not alter the assumed clinically 
meaningful benefits for this patient group.   
No clinical impact of the shift in the AAS could be observed based on the comparability exercise. No clear 
efficacy differences were observed in the data submitted (see also 2.2.4 Discussion on chemical, 
pharmaceutical and biological aspects).  
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
During the initial evaluation, the CHMP raised a concern about the indication needing to be further 
discussed, with reference to the lower age cut-off for which extrapolation of efficacy is considered 
acceptable based on disease similarity. It is now difficult to acknowledge to why one would consider a 
treatment benefit in a patient with AML treated with Mylotarg in combination with 3+7 induction 
chemotherapy at the age of 18 years established, but not at the age of 17 years. The CHMP acknowledged 
that there are differences in the frequency of AML subtypes and common molecular aberrations between 
adults and children in general. In a large survey evaluating the age effect on AML biology and response to 
therapy among paediatric patients, differences were seen in infants, but a distinct biology in TYA patients 
could not be identified (36). In addition, prospective studies that included both paediatric and adult 
patients did not report any outcome differences for the group of TYA patients ((37) (38)).  This is reflected 
in clinical practice, as indeed TYA patients with de novo AML may be treated using adult protocols, such 
Assessment report  
EMA/155284/2018  
Page 103/138 
 
 
 
 
 
as 3+7 induction chemotherapy (39). Overall, based on disease similarity, it can be concluded that TYA 
patients age 15-17 years with CD33-positive AML derive the same benefits than adults from the adult 3+7 
induction chemotherapy in combination with Mylotarg. Furthermore, the PK modelling results confirmed 
the PK similarity between adults and adolescents, supporting the assumption of similar exposure between 
adults and adolescents using BSA based dosing (see discussion on clinical pharmacology). This is further 
supported by the efficacy data from the meta-analyses, which is used as supportive evidence to bridge 
efficacy assumptions to patients less than 50 years of age. The subgroup of TYA patients (15-29 years of 
age, n=132), showed efficacy trends similar to the overall population, if not slightly better. Regarding 
safety it is noted that the 30 and 60-day mortality for TYA patient (15-29 years of age) in the Mylotarg 
arm was none. Despite the limited number, all of this is reassuring, as it confirms what is already known, 
younger TYA patients tend to tolerate intensive chemotherapy better than older patients. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall the robustness of the EFS endpoint and its clinical benefit for patients age 15 and above with de 
novo CD33-positive AML, excluding APL, is considered established. This was supported by improvements 
on relevant secondary endpoints.  
2.7.  Clinical safety 
The summary of clinical safety comprised data from a total of 19 studies conducted in patients with AML; 
11 studies of GO monotherapy conducted by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc, a subsidiary of the applicant and 
9 studies that support the use of Mylotarg in combination with DNR and AraC, of which the 5 IPD 
meta-analysis studies were conducted in patients with de novo AML.

A total of 2,747 patients received GO either as monotherapy or in combination chemotherapy: 
1) GO as monotherapy as part of the legacy Wyeth-sponsored studies: 953 patients with AML (Studies 
201, 202, 203, 101, 102, 103, 100374, 100847, 100863 and 205 [monotherapy part])  
2) GO in combination as part of the legacy Wyeth-sponsored studies: 
•  38 patients received GO in combination with AraC (Study 205)

TEAEs are defined as AEs that commence on or after the first dose date but within 28 days of last dose. 
Patients are counted only once per treatment in each row.  Maximum CTCAE grades are displayed. 
The System Organ Class (SOC) displayed is the SOC associated with the Adverse Reaction. 
MedDRA (v18.0) coding dictionary is applied.  Adverse events graded according to the NCI CTCAE, version 3.0. 
Adverse reactions that are upper case are grouped preferred terms. 
Per the additional data capture data entry guidelines, fatal significant infections were marked as permanently 
withdrawn from the study.  Only significant infections were collected and all were considered severe (≥Grade 3).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Neutropenia 
During the induction phase, 121 (92.4%) patients in the GO arm and 125 (91.2%) patients in the control 
arm had a documented neutrophil recovery to ANC of 500/mm3, and 118 (90.1%) patients in the GO arm 
and 120 (87.6%) patients in the control arm had a neutrophil recovery to ANC of 1000/mm3. Overall the 
majority of patients experienced severe myelosuppression with similar rates in both treatment arms and 
by treatment period. This is supported by the similar median number of RBC transfusions required per 
patient (14.0 in each arm). There was slightly increasing proportion of patients who recovered in the 
subsequent treatment phases post induction (all patients, threshold 1000/mm3: consolidation 1 90.1%, 
consolidation 2 93.8%).  
The IPD meta-analysis confirmed that the odds to experience severe neutropenia tends not to be different 
between GO and no GO treatment.  
Thrombocytopenia  
The median times to recovery of platelets at either threshold (50.00/mm3 or 100.000/mm3) were longer 
for patients in the GO arm than in the control arm (days 34 vs 29, respectively 35 vs 30 days). This is 
supported by the higher median number of platelet transfusions required in the GO arm compared to the 
control (median 23 vs 12). More patients tended to recover to the respective threshold following 
subsequent cycles (100.000/mm3 GO arm: consolidation 1 73.2%, 85.4% consolidation 2), which could 
be explained by the less intensive Mylotarg schedule (ie only one dose per consolidation cycle). Data from 
the pooled monotherapy studies 201, 202, 203 showed that patients younger than 60 years had a higher 
probability to recover to the above platelet thresholds. Similar figures presented for the AFLA trial showed 
no such correlation. 
Although the IPD meta-analysis could not show a statistically significant difference to experience an 
increase odds for severe thrombocytopenia in the GO arm, significant heterogeneity was observed 
between the single and fractioned 3 mg/m2 dosing schedule (p=0.00007), with persistent 
thrombocytopenia occurring in 16.3% of patients randomized to GO 3 × 3 mg/m² fractionated, compared 
to 1.5% of patients in the No GO arm (OR 6.23, 95% CI: 2.70-14.39, p=0.00002). This in general 
emphasises a potential risk increase due to the fractioned dosing schedule.  
Haemorrhage 
TEAEs of Haemorrhage of any grade occurred in the ALFA trial in the majority of patients in both 
treatment arms, with a higher rate in the GO arm: 118 (90.1%) patients in the GO arm and 107 (78.1%) 
patients in the control arm. This included Grade ≥ 3: 22.9% GO arm vs 9.5% control; serious events 
8.4% vs 1.5% in control; unresolved 13.7% vs 7.3% and death GO 2.3% vs 0.7%. 
Treatment with GO resulted in a delay in recovery of thrombocytopenia as well as higher percentages of 
persistent thrombocytopenia and an increased incidence of bleeding. The IPD meta-analysis showed that 
the odds to experience grade 3/4 haemorrhage was higher during induction (prelisted safety source: 
induction OR 2.16 [95% CI (1.46-3.20); p=0.0001] vs treatment period OR 1.87 [95% CI (1.32-2.65); 
p=0.0004].  
Infections 
In the combination therapy study, in patients with de novo AML treated with fractionated doses of 
gemtuzumab ozogamicin in combination with chemotherapy (N=131), 102 (77.9%) patients experienced 
all causality severe (Grade ≥  3) infections. Treatment-related death due to septic shock was reported in 
Assessment report  
EMA/155284/2018  
Page 114/138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2 (1.5%) patients. Fatal severe infection was reported in 2 (1.53%) patients in the MYLOTARG arm and 
4 (2.92%) patients in the control arm (SmPC, section 4.8). 
The incidence of severe infections (Grade 3/4) tended to be lower in the monotherapy studies in the 
relapsed AML setting (studies 201, 202, 203) compared to the setting of add-on Mylotarg to 
chemotherapy in the de novo population (monotherapy: 40.5% of patients with Grade ≥ 3 vs 78% in 
ALFA trial and 81.4% in IPD meta-analysis). There is also no difference in frequency of events between 
GO and no GO in the ALFA trial (GO: 102 patients [77.9%] vs control 106 patients [77.4%]; serious 
40.5% GO vs 36.5% in control; not resolved 3.8% GO vs 3.8% control; death 1.5% GO vs 2.9% control) 
and no difference in time with severe infections between the arms (median weeks 2.7 GO vs 2.4 control), 
though a broader time range can be seen in the GO arm (0-70.4 weeks GO vs 0-56.6 control).  
The meta-analysis showed no statistically significant increase in odds to experience a Grade 3/4 infection. 
There was a trend for a slight increase in the OR when comparing the odds during all treatment periods 
and the induction phase (All treatment period OR 0.85 (95%CI [0.6-1.21]) vs induction treatment period 
OR 1.08 (95%CI [0.8-1.46]). 
MRC cytogenetic risk was found to suggest heterogeneity in OR (p=0.07); patients in the GO arm with 
favourable risk disease had lower odds of infection than those in the No GO arm (OR 0.41, 95% CI: 
0.19-0.90, p=0.03).  
Hepatotoxicity, including hepatic VOD/SOS 
In the combination therapy study, VOD and hepatic laboratory abnormalities were collected. Additional 
characterisation of hepatotoxicity adverse reactions is provided from the monotherapy studies. 
In the combination therapy study (N=131), VOD was reported in 6 (4.6%) patients during or following 
treatment, 2 (1.5%) of these reactions were fatal. Five (3.8%) of these VOD reactions occurred within 28 
days of any dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin. One VOD event occurred more than 28 days of last dose of 
gemtuzumab ozogamicin; with 1 of these events occurring a few days after having started an HSCT 
conditioning regimen. The median time from the last gemtuzumab ozogamicin dose to onset of VOD was 
9 days (range: 2-298 days). VOD was also reported in 2 patients who received Mylotarg as a follow-up 
therapy following relapse of AML after chemotherapy treatment in the control arm of the combination 
therapy study. Both of these patients experienced VOD more than 28 days after the last dose of 
gemtuzumab ozogamicin. One of these patients experienced VOD 25 days after the subsequent HSCT 
(SmPC, section 4.8).  
The potential association of key variables with the risk of developing VOD (both VOD observed at any time 
following exposure to GO and VOD within 28 days of any dose of GO) was assessed by logistic regression. 
The analysis included adult patients treated with GO monotherapy from all relapsed/refractory AML 
studies except dose-finding Study 103, and had data for all key variables. The covariates evaluated in this 
analysis were age, sex, starting dose of GO (mg/m2), total dose of GO (in mg), number of GO doses, 
baseline ALT, baseline AST, baseline bilirubin, hepatic impairment baseline (categorised into 2 categories 
moderate/severe and none/mild) and indicator of HSCT (prior and follow-up). 
Based on this analysis of potential risk factors, adult patients who received Mylotarg as monotherapy, 
patients who had received an HSCT prior to gemtuzumab ozogamicin exposure were 2.6 times more likely 
(95% CI: 1.448-4.769) to develop VOD compared to patients without HSCT prior to treatment with 
gemtuzumab ozogamicin; patients who had received an HSCT following treatment with gemtuzumab 
ozogamicin were 2.9 times more likely (95% CI: 1.502-5.636) to develop VOD compared to patients 
without HSCT following treatment with gemtuzumab ozogamicin; and patients who had moderate/severe

hepatic impairment at baseline were 8.7 times more likely (95% CI: 1.879-39.862) to develop VOD 
compared to patients without moderate/severe hepatic impairment at baseline (SmPC, section 4.8). 
Myelosuppression 
In the combination therapy study in patients with previously untreated de novo AML treated with 
fractionated doses of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in combination with chemotherapy, Grade 3/4 decreases 
in leukocytes, neutrophils, and platelets were observed in 131 (100%), 124 (96.1%), and 131 (100%) 
patients, respectively (SmPC, section 4.8). 
During the induction phase, 109 (83.2%) and 99 (75.6%) patients had platelet recovery to counts of 
50,000/mm3 and 100,000/mm3, respectively. The median times to platelet recovery to counts of 
50,000/mm3 and 100,000/mm3 were 34 and 35 days, respectively. During the consolidation 1 phase, 92 
(94.8%) and 71 (73.2%) patients had a platelet recovery to counts of 50,000/mm3 and 100,000/mm3, 
respectively. The median times to platelet recovery to counts of 50,000/mm3 and 100,000/mm3 were 32 
and 35 days, respectively. During the consolidation 2 phase, 80 (97.6%) and 70 (85.4%) patients had a 
platelet recovery to counts of 50,000/mm3 and 100,000/mm3, respectively. The median times to platelet 
recovery to counts of 50,000/mm3 and 100,000/mm3 were 36.5 and 43 days, respectively (SmPC, section 
4.8). 
Thrombocytopenia with platelet counts < 50,000/mm3 persisting 45 days after the start of therapy for 
responding patients (CR and incomplete platelet recovery [CRp]) occurred in 22 (20.4%) of patients. The 
number of patients with persistent thrombocytopenia remained similar across treatment courses 
(8 [7.4%] patients at the induction phase and 8 [8.5%] patients at the consolidation 1 phase and 
10 [13.2%] patients at the consolidation 2 phase) (SmPC, section 4.8). 
During the induction phase, 121 (92.4%) and 118 (90.1%) patients had a documented neutrophil 
recovery to ANC of 500/mm3 and 1,000/mm3, respectively. The median time to neutrophil recovery to 
ANC of 500/mm3 and 1,000/mm3 was 25 days. In the consolidation 1 phase of therapy, 94 (96.9%) 
patients had neutrophil recovery to counts of 500/mm3, and 91 (94%) patients recovered to counts of 
1,000/mm3. The median times to neutrophil recovery to ANC of 500/mm3 and 1,000/mm3 were 21 and 
25 days, respectively. In the consolidation 2 phase of therapy, 80 (97.6%) patients had neutrophil 
recovery to counts of 500/mm3, and 79 (96.3%) patients recovered to counts of 1,000/mm3. The median 
times to neutrophil recovery to ANC of 500/mm3 and 1,000/mm3 were 22 and 27 days, respectively 
(SmPC, section 4.8). 
In the combination therapy study (N=131), all grades and Grade 3/4 bleeding/haemorrhagic reactions 
were reported in 118 (90.1%) and 27 (20.6%) patients, respectively. The most frequent Grade 3 
bleeding/haemorrhagic reactions were epistaxis (1.5%), haemoptysis (3.1%), and haematuria (2.3%). 
Grade 4 bleeding/haemorrhagic reactions were reported in 4 (3.1%) patients (gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage, haemorrhage, and pulmonary alveolar haemorrhage [2 patients]). Fatal 
bleeding/haemorrhagic reactions were reported in 3 (2.3%) patients (cerebral haematoma, intracranial 
haematoma, and subdural haematoma) (SmPC, section 4.8). 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Serious adverse events  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) were collected following the standard definition as any manifestation that 
suggested the occurrence of an important risk for the patient and/or the existence of a contraindication to 
continuation of treatment, from the time of signing the ICD until withdrawal from the study or 30 days 
after the end of study treatment.

In the ALFA trial more patients experienced a related SAE in the GO compared to the control (61.1% vs 
51.5%). The most common treatment-related SAEs by SOC were: Infections and infestations: 50 
(38.2%) patients in the GO arm and 46 (33.6%) patients in the control arm, blood and lymphatic system 
disorders: 45 (34.4%) patients in the GO arm and 15 (10.9%) patients in the control arm and 
hepatobiliary disorders: 16 (12.2%) patients in the GO arm and 5 (3.6%) patients in the control arm. 
Treatment-related SAEs experienced by >5% of patients in either treatment arm, by MedDRA Preferred 
Terms, were: thrombocytopenia: 32 (24.4%) patients in the GO arm and 5 (3.6%) patients in the control 
arm, bronchopulmonary aspergillosis: 13 (9.9%) patients in the GO arm and 10 (7.3%) patients in the 
control arm, febrile bone marrow aplasia: 12 (9.2% patients) in the GO arm and 7 (5.1%) patients in the 
control arm and septic shock: 9 (6.9%) patients in the GO arm and 7 (5.1%) patients in the control arm. 
Information on the occurrence of SAEs in the IPD Meta-Analysis was collected for each trial and the 
number of patients in whom one or more SAEs occurred (including SAEs with fatal outcome) was 
compared by treatment arm is displayed in Figure 25.

ECG 
Clinically, ECG tests were performed in 11 GO studies and post-baseline ECG tests were obtained in 8 
studies.  In 3 studies, namely, ALFA-0701, 100374 and 100863, ECG tests were performed only at 
screening or baseline.  Since the clinical studies predated the current QT interval prolongation guidance, 
these trials did not collect sufficient data to enable a formal concentration-QTc assessment; primarily 
qualitative ECG assessments were reported (data not shown).

Post marketing experience 
On September 1, 2017, FDA approved Mylotarg for the treatment of newly-diagnosed CD33-positive AML 
in adults and for treatment of relapsed or refractory CD33-positive AML in adults and in paediatric 
patients 2 years and older. Mylotarg may be combined with Ara-C and  daunorubicin (as in the EU) for 
adults with newly-diagnosed AML, or as a stand-alone treatment for certain adult and pediatric patients 
(in USA only). Mylotarg is marketed in Japan (since July 2005) for the treatment of patients with relapsed 
or recurrent CD33-positive AML.  
Safety assessments performed as part of global pharmacovigilance monitoring have been reported in 
PSURs over the past 15 years. 
In the first 2 PSURs for the time period 17 May 2000 to 16 May 2001, changes were made to the 
Reference Safety Information (RSI) provided in the Investigator’s Brochure regarding 
hepatotoxicity/VOD and hypersensitivity reactions, and the corresponding changes were subsequently 
included in a warning for the US market (prior withdrawal). Renal failure secondary to tumour lysis 
syndrome was also added to the tumour lysis syndrome section under the warnings and precautions.  
Since 2001, no new safety findings were identified in the post-marketing setting. Additionally, 
assessments were done during routine pharmacovigilance monitoring including all known safety 
Assessment report  
EMA/155284/2018  
Page 123/138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
information, spontaneous reports, literature, non-interventional studies, and clinical trial reports, with no 
new safety concerns identified and a consistent safety profile as known for Mylotarg.  
A Drug Use Investigation (DUI) also conducted in Japan, under approval conditions as an all-patient 
survey from September 2005 to December 2009.  Of the 753 patients included in this exercise, 367 
patients were aged 65 years or older (48.7%), 366 patients aged 15 to less than 65 years (48.6%), and 
20 children aged less than 15 years (2.7%).   There were 1,444 serious ADRs in 508 patients. Major ADRs 
were as follows: 197 ADRs of platelet count decreased, febrile neutropenia, 169 ADRs of neutrophil count 
decreased, 134 ADRs of white blood cell count decreased, 118 ADRs of sepsis, 98 ADRs of febrile 
neutropenia, 66 ADRs of anaemia, 47 ADRs of pneumonia, 42 ADRs of neutrophil count decreased, 42 
ADRs of venoocclusive liver disease, 31 ADRs of disseminated intravascular coagulation, 28 ADRs of 
thrombocytopenia, 21 ADRs of pyrexia. With regard to the important identified risk of VOD, the following 
has been described: the incidence rate of adverse reactions of VOD was 5.58% (42 AEs of VOD in 42 
patients) and 4.38%, (33 AEs of Grade >3 venoocclusive liver disease in 33 patients) respectively. 
Clinical impact of change in AAS levels – safety 
A comprehensive review of Mylotarg cases meeting PSUR criteria, and reporting preferred terms (PTs) 
relevant to the specified search strategies for each of the important risks of GO in the Pfizer global safety 
database during the exclusively pre-AAS (base AAS) shift time period (cumulatively through 31 
December 2006; 6 years) versus cases reported during the exclusively post-AAS shift (elevated AAS) 
time period (01 January 2012 through 31 May 2017; 5.5 years) has been submitted. This included clinical 
trial cases through this period.  
2.7.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety data collected in a prospective open-ended manner, in line with regulatory requirements, 
describing all Grades of severity (Grade 1 and 2 missing) and accurately reflecting the respective 
frequencies are not available from the ALFA trial. But the extensive experience with Mylotarg in clinical 
trials and the fact that it is still licensed in Japan allows a reassuring qualitative description of the safety 
profile. A total of 2.747 patients received GO either as monotherapy or in combination chemotherapy.  
The most common adverse reactions (> 30%) in the combination therapy study were haemorrhage and 
infection. In monotherapy studies the most common adverse reactions (> 30%) included pyrexia, 
nausea, infection, chills, haemorrhage, vomiting, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, headache, stomatitis, 
diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and neutropenia (SmPC section 4.8). 
Most AEs associated with GO use could be considered expected in the patient population, ie 
meylosuppression, infections or GI events. But there are AE SOCs (predefined) observed with increased 
incidence, such as grade 3/4 mucosal toxicity (16.0% vs 6.6%), pain (14.5% vs 3.6%), and the 
composite of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea (16.8% vs 10.2%). Others considered more directly 
related to Mylotarg and it’s on and off target effects, are prolonged thrombocytopenia and consequential 
increased incidence of serious events of haemorrhage (GO 8.4% vs 1.5%), or hepatotoxicity (8.6% vs 
2.2%), including VOD (GO 4.6% vs 1.5%). The increased incidence of toxicity is supported by the 
meta-analysis showing a significantly higher odd to experience a Grade 3 or 4 toxicity with Mylotarg 
added to chemotherapy (Odds 1.21 [95% CI 1.03, 1.42], p=0.02), which tends to be even slightly higher 
for the induction period (Odds 1.22 [95% CI 1.05, 1.41], p=0.009).  
The same holds true for treatment related SAEs, with SOCs of infections and infestations (GO 38.2% vs 
33.6%), blood and lymphatic system disorders (GO 34.4% vs 10.9%), and hepatobiliary (GO 12.2% vs 
Assessment report  
EMA/155284/2018  
Page 124/138 
 
 
 
 
 
3.6%) observed most. The higher risk to experience a SAE is also supported by the IPD meta-analysis (OR 
1.40, [95% CI: 1.19-1.66], p=0.00006).  
In the combination therapy study ALFA-0701, clinically relevant serious adverse reactions were 
hepatotoxicity, including VOD/SOS (3.8%), haemorrhage (9.9%), severe infection (41.2%), and tumour 
lysis syndrome (1.5%). In monotherapy studies, clinically relevant serious adverse reactions also 
included infusion related reactions (2.5%), thrombocytopenia (21.7%), and neutropenia (34.3%)(SmPC 
section 4.8).  
The most frequent (≥  1%) adverse reactions that led to permanent discontinuation in the combination 
therapy study were thrombocytopenia, VOD, haemorrhage and infection. The most frequent (≥  1%) 
adverse reactions that led to permanent discontinuation in monotherapy studies were infection, 
haemorrhage, multi organ failure, and VOD (SmPC section 4.8). In addition, permanent drug 
discontinuation due to TEAEs tends also to be high in the GO arm (GO discontinuation 49.2% [33/67]; 
chemotherapy discontinuation 36.7% [18/49]). When comparing to the control arm this trend is 
confirmed by less TEAEs reported leading to discontinuation of chemotherapy (13.7% GO arm vs 2.2% 
control arm). This means the likelihood of permanently discontinuing Mylotarg due to AEs was around 
25%, and discontinuation of chemotherapy due to any study treatment related AE was almost 6 times 
higher in the GO arm. Initially, this raised concerns around drug tolerability and would need to be 
outweighed by a clinically meaningful improvement in EFS. This also showed the importance to only 
consider patients for treatment with Mylotarg induction combination who are considered fit enough by 
their treating physician. Based on this, the CHMP considered that Mylotarg should be used only in patients 
eligible to receive intensive induction chemotherapy (SmPC section 4.2).  
The rates of selected TEAEs (Infections/ infestations; Haemorrhage and VOD) were similar between the 
all treated and responder population. The clear difference between the GO arm and the control arm in 
terms of all grade haemorrhage (90.7% in the GO arm versus 81.2% in the control arm and 90.1% in the 
GO arm versus 78.1% in the control arm in responder patients and the overall AT population, 
respectively) and all grade VOD (4.6% in the GO arm versus 2% in the control arm and 4.6% in the GO 
arm versus 1.5% in the control arm in responder patients and the overall AT population, respectively) 
remains. It is overall agreed that Mylotarg leads to an increase of certain TEAEs, but that there was no 
worsening of the imbalance between patients who responded and all patients (AT). As mentioned, in the 
overall AT population and responder patients, the two most frequent reasons for permanent Mylotarg 
discontinuation were identified to be thrombocytopenia and hepatotoxicity. In addition to this,  Mylotarg 
treatment either before or after HSCT and baseline moderate/ severe hepatic impairment have been 
identified as risk factors for an increased risk for developing VOD. Both are now reflected in the proposed 
SmPC, including adequate monitoring recommended as follows:  Due to the risk of VOD/SOS, signs and 
symptoms of VOD/SOS should be closely monitored; these may include elevations in ALT, AST, total 
bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase, which should be monitored prior to each dose of Mylotarg, 
hepatomegaly (which may be painful), rapid weight gain, and ascites. Monitoring only total bilirubin may 
not identify all patients at risk of VOD/SOS. For patients who develop abnormal liver tests, more frequent 
monitoring of liver tests and clinical signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity is recommended. For patients 
who proceed to HSCT, close monitoring of liver tests is recommended during the post-HSCT period, as 
appropriate. No definitive relationship was found between VOD and time of HSCT relative to higher 
Mylotarg monotherapy doses, however, the ALFA-0701 study recommended an interval of 2 months 
between the last dose of Mylotarg and HSCT (SmPC, section 4.4). 
Management of signs or symptoms of hepatic toxicity may require a dose interruption, or discontinuation 
of Mylotarg. In patients who experience VOD/SOS, Mylotarg should be discontinued and patients treated 
according to standard medical practice (SmPC, sections 4.2 and 4.4).

In clinical studies, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, leukopenia, febrile neutropenia, 
lymphopenia, and pancytopenia, some of which were life-threatening or fatal, were reported. 
Complications associated with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia may include infections and 
bleeding/haemorrhagic reactions respectively. Infections and bleeding/haemorrhagic reactions were 
reported, some of which were life-threatening or fatal. 
Complete blood counts should be monitored prior to each dose of Mylotarg. During treatment, patients 
should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection, bleeding/haemorrhage, or other effects of 
myelosuppression. Routine clinical and laboratory surveillance testing during and after treatment is 
indicated. Management of patients with severe infection, bleeding/haemorrhage, or other effects of 
myelosuppression, including severe neutropenia or persistent thrombocytopenia, may require a dose 
delay or permanent discontinuation of Mylotarg (SmPC sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8). Myelosuppression 
(severe [Grade ≥ 3] and/or serious infection and haemorrhage) been classified as an identified risk in the 
Risk Management Plan. 
Regarding the different toxicities in relation to the different risk subgroups, it is agreed that similar rates 
of all grade pre-defined TEAEs in both arms when classified by ELN risk groups has been shown. This is 
certainly the case for infections and infestations (GO arm All Patients 77.9%; 80.9% favourable/ 
intermediate risk; 74.3% adverse risk group), as well as haemorrhage (GO arm all patients 90.1%; 94% 
Favourable/ intermediate risk; 85.7% adverse risk group). It is however evident that all grades VOD 
appeared with a higher incidence in patients with adverse risk AML (8.6%), compared to the favourable/ 
intermediate group (3.6%) and to the all patient population (4.6%). This is in addition to the two fatal 
cases of VOD occurring in the adverse risk group. This is consistent with all-causality SAEs by the SOC 
‘Hepatobiliary disorders’, which was reported with increasing incidence of 7.7%, 13.8% and 17.1% in 
patients in the GO arm for the favourable, intermediate and poor/adverse risk subgroups, respectively, 
compared to an overall incidence of 13.0% of all patients in the GO arm. Similar increase can be observed 
for the all-causality SAEs experienced by >5% of patients for septic shock, reported in 2 (7.7%), 5 
(8.6%) and 4 (11.4%) patients in the GO arm as well as thrombocytopenia reported in 3 (11.5%), 17 
(29.3%) and 13 (37.1%) patients in the GO arm for the favourable, intermediate and poor/adverse risk 
subgroups. The remaining retrospectively collected data showed similar rates of all-grade predefined 
SAEs in both treatment arms when patients were classified by ELN criteria. Consistent positive 
benefit/risk across all cytogenetic risk groups can hence not be concluded (see discussion on clinical 
efficacy). This has been adequately reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
The 30-day mortality rate was numerically higher in the Mylotarg arm (3.8% vs 2.2%), but similar across 
arm at 60-days (GO 5.3% vs control 5.1%). More induction deaths at day 60 were observed in the 
Poor/Adverse risk groups (GO 8.6% [3/35] vs control 11.1% [4/36]) compared with the Favourable/ 
Intermediate risk groups (3.5% [3/84] GO arm vs 4.3% [4/92] control arm). This is consistent for the 
cytogenetic subgroups, showing more induction deaths in the unfavourable group (D30 GO 11.1% [3] vs 
control 3.3% [1]; D60: 14.8% [4] in GO arm vs 10% [3] in control arm) compared to the intermediate 
group (2.2% [2] in GO arm), none with favourable cytogenetics. The trend in mortality difference is 
supported by the 30 and 60-day mortality results from the meta-analysis with heterogeneity in OR 
observed between cytogenetics risk groups. No overall increase in risk of early mortality between arms is 
observed.  
No clinical impact of the shift in the AAS could be observed based on the comparability exercise. No clear 
safety differences were observed in the comprehensive analysis submitted (see also 2.2.4 Discussion on 
chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects).  
In clinical studies infusion related reactions, including anaphylaxis were reported (see section 4.8). There 
have been reports of fatal infusion reactions in the post marketing setting. Signs and symptoms of 
Assessment report  
EMA/155284/2018  
Page 126/138 
 
 
 
 
 
infusion related reactions may include fever and chills, and less frequently hypotension, tachycardia, and 
respiratory symptoms that may occur during the first 24 hours after administration. Infusion of 
MYLOTARG should be performed under close clinical monitoring, including pulse, blood pressure, and 
temperature. Premedication with a corticosteroid, antihistamine and acetaminophen (or paracetamol) is 
recommended 1 hour prior to MYLOTARG dosing (see section 4.2). Infusion should be interrupted 
immediately for patients who develop evidence of severe reactions, especially dyspnoea, bronchospasm, 
or clinically significant hypotension. Patients should be monitored until signs and symptoms completely 
resolve. Discontinuation of treatment should be strongly considered for patients who develop signs or 
symptoms of anaphylaxis, including severe respiratory symptoms or clinically significant hypotension 
(SmPC section 4.4). Infusion-related reactions (including anaphylaxis) from start of infusion to within 24 
hours of end of infusion have been classified as an identified risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
In clinical studies, TLS was reported. Fatal reports of TLS complicated by acute renal failure have been 
reported in the post marketing setting. In patients with hyperleukocytic AML, leukoreduction should be 
considered with hydroxyurea or leukapheresis to reduce the peripheral WBC count to below 30,000/mm3 
prior to administration of Mylotarg to reduce the risk of inducing TLS. Patients should be monitored for 
signs and symptoms of TLS and treated according to standard medical practice. Appropriate measures to 
help prevent the development of tumour lysis-related hyperuricaemia, such as hydration, administration 
of antihyperuricemics (e.g., allopurinol) or other agents for treatment of hyperuricaemia (e.g., 
rasburicase) must be taken (SmPC sections 4.2 and 4.4). Tumour lysis syndrome has been classified as 
an identified risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
No effect of the low levels of unconjugated calicheamicin observed after a 3 mg/m2 or 9 mg/m2 dose of GO 
on ECG parameters have been identified in non-clinical studies (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
No safety signal has been identified in clinical trials, but data are insufficient to make a firm conclusion. In 
conclusion, as no cardiac safety signal has been identified from the clinical trial data of >6000 patients, 
the CHMP recommended the applicant to evaluate the effect of GO on QTc as described in the planned 
clinical study with the fractionated regimen. Furthermore cardiac function is considered missing 
information and this is reflected in the Risk Management Plan. 
Overall, the incidence rate of ADA development after MYLOTARG treatment was < 1% across the 4 clinical 
studies with ADA data. Definitive conclusions cannot be drawn between the presence of antibodies and 
potential impact on efficacy and safety due to the limited number of patients with positive ADAs. Mylorarg 
will be administered to patients who are going to be immunosuppressed over the course of the treatment, 
with little meaningful clinical impact expected; taking into consideration that Mylotarg seems not to be 
very immunogenic (<1%). The CHMP recommended the applicant to evaluate immunogenicity of the 
batches intended for licensing as part of post-marketing commitment.  Immunogenicity has been 
classified as a potential risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
Management of patients with severe infection, bleeding/haemorrhage, or other effects of 
myelosuppression, including severe neutropenia or persistent thrombocytopenia, may require a dose 
delay or permanent discontinuation of Mylotarg (SmPC sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in pregnant women. 
Mylotarg must not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit to the mother outweighs the 
potential risks to the foetus. Pregnant women, or patients becoming pregnant whilst receiving 
gemtuzumab ozogamicin, or treated male patients as partners of pregnant women, must be apprised of 
the potential hazard to the foetus (SmPC, section 4.6).

There is no information on fertility in patients. Based on non-clinical findings, male and female fertility 
may be compromised by treatment with gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Both men and women should seek 
advice on fertility preservation before treatment (SmPC, section 4.6). 
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving Mylotarg. 
Women of childbearing potential, or partners of females of childbearing potential should be advised to use 
2 methods of effective contraception during treatment with MYLOTARG for at least 7 months (females) or 
4 months (males) after the last dose (SmPC, section 4.6). 
There is no information regarding the presence of gemtuzumab ozogamicin or its metabolites in human 
milk, the effects on the breast-fed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for 
adverse reactions in breast-fed children, women should not breast-feed during treatment with Mylotarg 
and for at least 1 month after the final dose (SmPC, section 4.6). 
Mylotarg has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised they 
may experience fatigue, dizziness and headache during treatment with Mylotarg. Therefore, caution 
should be exercised when driving or operating machines (SmPC section 4.7). 
No cases of overdose with Mylotarg were reported in clinical experience. Single doses higher than 9 
mg/m2 in adults were not tested. Treatment of Mylotarg overdose should consist of general supportive 
measures (SmPC section 4.9). 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.7.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of gemtuzumab ozogamicin is considered acceptable, with haemorrhage and 
infection being the most common adverse reactions (> 30%) in the combination therapy.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.2, dated January 2018, is 
acceptable.  
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle 
with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 17th May 2000. The new EURD list entry will therefore 
use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of gemtuzumab ozogamicin with active substances contained in 
authorised medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, 
isomer, mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers gemtuzumab ozogamicin to be a new active substance 
as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.

2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Mylotarg (gemtuzumab ozogamicin) is 
included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, 
was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Mylotarg (gemtuzumab ozogamicin) is proposed for treatment in combination with daunorubicin (DNR) 
and cytarabine (AraC) in adult patients with previously untreated de novo CD33-positive AML. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The current standard of care for the treatment of de novo AML is based on intensive 3+7 (DNR/ AraC) 
induction chemotherapy; in case of remission this is followed by usually two courses of consolidation 
therapy or transplant in patients eligible based on the individual risk category.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main clinical study was study ALFA070, a multicenter, randomized, comparative phase 3 study of 
fractionated doses of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in addition to daunorubicin + cytarabine versus 
daunorubicin + cytarabine alone  for induction and consolidation therapy in patients with AML aged 50 to 
70 years. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Study ALFA070 has provided convincing evidence of clinical efficacy of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in 
combination with daunorubicin + cytarabine compared to daunorubicin + cytarabine alone in terms of the 
primary endpoint EFS, for induction and consolidation therapy in patients with AML. The primary efficacy 
Assessment report  
EMA/155284/2018  
Page 131/138 
 
 
 
 
 
analysis (investigators review - data cut of August 2011), showed an EFS difference of 7.8 months (HR 
0.562; 95% CI: 0.415-0.762; 2-sided p=0.0002), consistent when stratified by NCCN or ELN 
classification. The most conservative sensitivity analysis performed, (BIRC; data set April 2013), 
confirmed the primary analysis (HR 0.705; 95% CI: 0.536-0.928, p=0.0161), when stratified according 
to ELN. The robustness of the EFS was confirmed by appropriate additional sensitivity analyses. 
Regarding the secondary endpoints, RFS confirmed a statistical significant difference in favour of the GO 
arm (HR 0.656, 95% CI: 0.466, 0.922, p= 0.02480) stratified for ELN risk category.  In terms of response 
rate and OS there was a numerical advantage in favour of GO arm although this was not statistically 
significant.  
Efficacy is supported by the primary endpoint OS of the IPD meta-analysis showing it was significantly 
improved in patients randomized to GO than in No GO patients. The OR for GO versus No GO was 0.91 
(95% CI: 0.84-0.99, p=0.02), in favour of the GO arm. Overall pooled median OS was 23.62 months 
(95% CI: 21.22-27.33) in the GO arm and 21.49 months (95% CI: 19.42-23.20) in the No GO arm. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The uncertainties that were identified during the assessment, including the initially proposed indication, 
the age cut-off and the efficacy in patients with adverse cytogenetic risk disease were satisfactorily 
addressed (see discussion on clinical efficacy). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The most common adverse reactions (> 30%, all grades) in the combination therapy study were 
haemorrhage (90.1% vs 20.6%) and infection (77.9% vs 77.4%). In the combination therapy study 
(N=131), VOD was reported in 6 (4.6%) patients during or following treatment, 2 (1.5%) of these 
reactions were fatal. Five (3.8%) of these VOD reactions occurred within 28 days of any dose of 
gemtuzumab ozogamicin. 
Thrombocytopenia with platelet counts < 50,000/mm3 persisting 45 days after the start of therapy for 
responding patients (CR and incomplete platelet recovery [CRp]) occurred in 22 (20.4%) of patients. The 
number of patients with persistent thrombocytopenia remained similar across treatment courses (8 
[7.4%] patients at the induction phase and 8 [8.5%] patients at the consolidation 1 phase and 10 
[13.2%] patients at the consolidation 2 phase). 
The 30-day mortality rate was numerically higher in the GO arm (3.8% vs 2.2%), but similar across arms 
at 60-days (GO 5.3% vs control 5.1%). The increased risk for treatment related mortality in the GO arm 
was driven by increased deaths due to haemorrhage (3.1% vs 0%) and liver toxicity (VOD) (1.5% vs 
0%). 
The most frequent (≥  1%) adverse reactions that led to permanent discontinuation in the combination 
therapy study were thrombocytopenia, VOD, haemorrhage and infection. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
No cardiac safety signal has been identified in clinical trials, but data are insufficient to make a firm 
conclusion. In conclusion, as no cardiac safety signal has been identified from the clinical trial data of 
>6000 patients, the CHMP recommended the applicant to evaluate the effect of GO on QTc as described 
Assessment report  
EMA/155284/2018  
Page 132/138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in the planned clinical study with the fractionated regimen. Furthermore cardiac function is considered 
missing information and this is reflected in the Risk Management Plan.  
The incidence rate of ADA development after gemtuzumab ozogamicin treatment was < 1% across the 4 
clinical studies with ADA data. Definitive conclusions cannot be drawn between the presence of antibodies 
and potential impact on efficacy and safety due to the limited number of patients with positive ADAs. 
Mylotarg will be administered to patients who are going to be immunosuppressed over the course of the 
treatment, with little meaningful clinical impact expected.The CHMP recommended the applicant to 
evaluate immunogenicity of the batches intended for licensing as part of post-marketing commitment. 
Immunogenicity has been classified as a potential risk in the Risk Management Plan.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The proposed indication concerns all patients with untreated de novo AML, except APL. Few 
improvements have been achieved in the treatment of this disease in the last decades and survival

expectance remains poor, highlighting the unmet medical need. Any treatment benefit in the de novo 
setting would be reflected in an increase of patients achieving sustainable first remission rates, allowing 
more patients proceeding to transplant in case eligible as per individual risk profile, ultimately translating 
into improvement in OS. However, any prolongation of remission could be considered of clinical benefit. 
Particularly when looking at first line treatment and the benefit patients might gain by having a prolonged 
time off further therapy in a disease in which relapse usually occurs early. The primary endpoint of EFS, 
evaluated in the ALFA trial is relevant in this clinical context and it is agreed that EFS is a clinically 
meaningful endpoint. An improvement in EFS of around 6 months and a risk reduction to experience an 
event of around 30% is of clear clinical relevance. The effect on overall survival was less clear although, 
also based on supportive evidence from a meta-analysis a small favourable effect seems likely. In any 
case, a detrimental effect in terms of OS in the whole population can be ruled out. 
The efficacy results from the pivotal trial supported by the meta-analysis showed that Mylotarg added to 
induction chemotherapy improved EFS through prolongation of remission following initial chemotherapy, 
rather than increasing the number of patients who achieve complete remission, as confirmed by the 
absence of a statistically significant difference in the overall response rate. The toxicity associated with 
GO, although expected based on the mechanism of action, was also important, including treatment 
discontinuation due to AEs  that occurred more frequently in the GO arm (13.7%) vs. control arm (2.2 %) 
and were mainly due to thrombocytopenia and VOD. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In view of the effect in terms of EFS and the observed toxicity, and that any remaining uncertainties have 
been addressed, the benefit-risk balance in the proposed indication is considered positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Efficacy for the intended indication for patients less than 50 years of age is based on full extrapolation, as 
the pivotal ALFA trial only recruited patients age 50-70 years. It is agreed that Mylotarg is considered to 
have a positive benefit/risk in all patients with newly diagnosed CD33-positive AML age 18 and above. 
This is based on disease similarity, acknowledging that any associated (known or unknown) biological 
differences due to age do not alter the assumed clinically meaningful benefits for this patient group.  
However it is difficult to acknowledge to why one would consider a treatment benefit in a patient with AML 
treated with Mylotarg in combination with 3+7 induction chemotherapy at the age of 18 years 
established, but not at the age of 17 years. The CHMP acknowledged that there are differences in the 
frequency of AML subtypes and common molecular aberrations between adults and children in general. 
However literature data and efficacy data from the meta-analyses were considered as supportive 
evidence to bridge efficacy assumptions to patients less than 50 years of age. The subgroup of TYA 
patients (15-29 years of age, n=132), showed efficacy trends similar to the overall population, if not 
slightly better. Regarding safety it is noted that the 30 and 60-day mortality for TYA patient (15-29 years 
of age) in the Mylotarg arm was none. Despite the limited number, all of this is reassuring, as it confirms 
what is already known, younger TYA patients tend to tolerate intensive chemotherapy better than older 
patients. 
The term "de novo" is used in the indication to exclude secondary leukemia, i.e., AML evolving from 
previous myelodysplasia and forms of acute leukaemia developing after exposure to environmental or 
therapeutic toxins or radiation (therapy related), as reflected in the pivotal trial (see SmPC sections 4.1 
and 5.1).

Additionally, it must be emphasized that APL is not included in the pivotal trial and this has been reflected 
in the indication.  
Subgroup analyses of EFS indicated a more encouraging treatment effect with the Mylotarg combination 
in patients with favourable/intermediate risk cytogenetics. Reflecting on the differences observed for the 
different risk groups, it can be hypothesised that patients with adverse cytogenetics who receive 
fractioned low dose of Mylotarg seem to exhibit less deep responses, translating into shorter, not 
statistically significant periods of remission. It can be argued that, based on distinct biological 
characteristics, with the pathophysiological route causes yet to be fully elucidated, the hard-to-treat poor 
cytogenetic patient group is less susceptible to Mylotarg based induction chemotherapy.  Adequate 
wording has been added in section 4.4 of the SmPC to reflect on the need to individually consider the 
benefit/risk profile in patients, particularly with adverse cytogenetics, once results become available.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Mylotarg is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus decision is of the opinion that Mylotarg is not similar to Vidaza, Dacogen, Ceplene 
and Rydapt within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.  
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the risk-benefit balance of Mylotarg is favourable in the following indication: 
MYLOTARG is indicated for combination therapy with daunorubicin (DNR) and cytarabine (AraC) for the 
treatment of patients age 15 years and above with previously untreated, de novo CD33-positive acute 
myeloid leukaemia (AML), except acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
Assessment report  
EMA/155284/2018  
Page 135/138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the  agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product to be implemented by the Member States 
Not applicable. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that gemtuzumab ozogamicin is a 
new active substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the 
European Union.

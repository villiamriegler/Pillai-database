T2D is a progressive metabolic disease primarily characterised by abnormal glucose metabolism, resulting in 
hyperglycaemia. Uncontrolled hyperglycaemia is associated with adverse long-term consequences such as 
microvascular and macrovascular complications (e.g., retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy and 
cardiovascular disease). The aetiology, pathophysiology and clinical manifestation of T2D in the paediatric 
population are similar to that in adults. The recommended treatment approach for paediatric T2D is similar 
to that in adults, namely the achievement and maintenance of glycaemic control in order to prevent 
long-term complications. Given the similar pathophysiology and progression of adult and paediatric T2D, the 
paediatric treatment guidelines also recommend a step-wise approach starting with lifestyle modifications 
followed by pharmacologic monotherapy and later by combination therapy. Metformin and insulin are 
currently the only approved pharmacologic treatment options for paediatric subjects with T2D in most 
countries. However, more than half of youth with T2D experience a loss of glycaemic control with metformin 
alone or when combined with lifestyle intervention. Although insulin is highly effective in lowering blood 
glucose, its acceptance and use by paediatric subjects with T2D may be limited by such drawbacks as weight 
gain, high risk of hypoglycaemia, complex titration and need for coordination with meals. Given the 
EMA/447330/2019 
Page 6/52 
 
  
  
  
 
 
above-mentioned limitations of currently approved therapies, there is a need for new efficacious, durable, 
safe and tolerable treatment options for paediatric patients with T2D. 
Regulatory guidance 
The aim of this application is to extend the indication for liraglutide (Victoza) for the treatment of T2D in 
children and adolescents aged 10 years and above.  
The liraglutide (Victoza) paediatric development programme was designed in agreement with the FDA and 
the EMA. Key binding elements for the programme were included in the paediatric investigation plan (PIP) 
agreed upon with the EMA (EMEA-000128-PIP01-07-M08). The EMA granted a waiver for the investigation of 
liraglutide (Victoza) in children with T2D less than 10 years of age, as such investigation would be highly 
impractical or impossible due to the very low prevalence of T2D in this age range.  
The MAH did receive EMA Scientific Advice regarding the PIP request for Trial 3659: “At least 30% of study 
patients should be included from EU countries or countries with lifestyle and diabetes care similar to those of 
the EU member states“(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/599380/2018) specifying an approach of comparing WHO 
lifestyle parameters of other countries to the range of these parameters in the EU and considering ISPAD 
guidelines to assure comparability of the treatment recommendations across the non-EU countries included.  
2.1.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable. 
2.2.  Clinical aspects 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Tabular overview of clinical studies: see table 1  
Introduction 
The paediatric clinical development programme for liraglutide builds on the data already available for 
liraglutide in adults. Liraglutide was investigated in children and adolescents (age 10-17 years) with T2D in 
two trials (Table 1):  
• 
• 
a clinical pharmacology trial (Trial NN2211-1800, referred to as Trial 1800) 
a Phase 3a efficacy and safety trial (Trial NN2211-3659, referred to as Trial 3659) 
Both trials were designed and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki4 and ICH Good 
Clinical Practice5.

Abbreviations: PIP = paediatric investigation plan, T2D = type 2 diabetes 
The execution of the paediatric clinical development programme was challenging, mainly due to the slow and 
difficult subject recruitment. The recruitment period for Trial 1800 spanned approximately 2 years. A total of 
14 sites in 4 countries randomised subjects (N=21). Two (2) of the protocol amendments for Trial 1800 were 
implemented to aid recruitment. The recruitment period for Trial 3659 spanned 4 years and 4 months. A 
total of 84 sites in 25 countries screened subjects and 57 of these sites randomised subjects (N=135). Three 
(3) of the protocol amendments for Trial 3659 were done in order to facilitate recruitment and/or reduce the 
sample size. 
2.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
The main objectives of the clinical pharmacology program for the use of liraglutide in paediatric subjects 
aged 10-17 years with T2D were to assess the safety and tolerability and pharmacokinetic properties in this 
population and compare exposure to exposure in the corresponding adult population.  
The short-term clinical pharmacology trial (Trial 1800) provided evidence of safety and tolerability in 
paediatric subjects and that pharmacokinetics in paediatric subjects were consistent with pharmacokinetics 
in adults. In Trial 1800 the half-life was approximately 12 h and CL/F was 1.7 L/h assessed for liraglutide 1.8 
mg at steady state, in accordance with pharmacokinetics in adults. This trial also indicated dose 
proportionality for AUC0–24h and Cmax for liraglutide doses up to 1.8 mg. Based on the safety/tolerability 
results, and the PK data from this trial and the knowledge that the body weight range is similar for 
adolescents and adults with T2D in the patient population, the adult dose range (0.6-1.8 mg) was chosen for 
the phase 3a trial (Trial 3659). 
The phase 3a efficacy/safety trial (Trial 3659) was designed to test the same dose regimen in paediatric 
subjects as used in adults: a starting dose of 0.6 mg for 1 week, thereafter escalating the dose to 1.2 mg and 
1.8 mg according to individual glucose level and safety/tolerability. 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis of a combined data set that included data from Trial 3659, data from 
Trial 1800, and data from two historical clinical pharmacology trials in adults with T2D (NN2211-3534 and 
NN2211-3673) showed as expected (based on previous findings in paediatric and adult trials) that exposure 
was inversely correlated with body weight (the covariate of most importance), that males have lower body 
weight-adjusted exposure than females, and that no clinically relevant difference in exposure was observed 
for the paediatric population versus adults when adjusted for effects of covariates.  
Simulated steady-state concentration-time profiles following liraglutide 1.8 mg once-daily in paediatric 
subjects and adults showed similar body-weight adjusted liraglutide concentrations over the dosing interval.  
Additionally, the exposure in Trial 3659 was compared to exposure in a previous phase 3a trial conducted in 
adults with T2D (NN2211-1573, referred to as Trial 1573). The exposure levels were comparable between 
the paediatric subjects in Trial 3659 and the adults in Trial 1573 (Figure 1) as a result of the similar body 
weights for the subjects in these trials. The body weight range in Trial 1573 (43.7-163.3 kg) was consistent 
with the range observed across several liraglutide trials in adults with T2D (40.3-170.0 kg).6 It is expected, 
therefore, that in general, paediatric subjects aged 10-17 years with T2D will have a similar body weight 
range as compared to adults with T2D.

The exposure-response analysis for change in HbA1c at week 26 in Trial 3659 showed a larger reduction in 
HbA1c with higher exposure, despite factors that could suppress the magnitude of HbA1c reduction: 
individual dose escalation based on FPG and tolerability, use of rescue medication, and suspected possible 
non-compliance.  
In conclusion, the pharmacokinetic data supports the same liraglutide dose regimen for paediatric patients 
aged 10-17 years with T2D, as used by adult patients with T2D. 
2.2.2.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The main objectives of the clinical pharmacology program for the use of liraglutide in paediatric subjects 
aged 10-17 years with T2D were to assess the safety and tolerability and pharmacokinetic properties in this 
population and compare exposure to exposure in the corresponding adult population. In Trial 1800 the 
half-life was approximately 12 h and CL/F was 1.7 L/h assessed for liraglutide 1.8 mg at steady state, in 
accordance with pharmacokinetics in adults.  
Of the 14 subjects treated with liraglutide, one subject stayed on 0.3 mg liraglutide, and three subjects 
stayed on 0.6 mg liraglutide. In the study report, the Applicant has justified the non-escalation by the 
protocol-specified stop in dose escalation if the 3-day average FPG was ≤ 6.1 mmol/L. Overall, the study 
seems well conducted.  
AUC, Cmax and Ctrough increased with increasing dose until 1.8 mg, which is indicative of dose proportionality, 
which is further supported by the dose proportionality analysis provided by the Applicant. Cmax and AUC is 
EMA/447330/2019 
Page 9/52 
 
  
  
  
 
markedly lower in children than what is stated in the SmPC. This is likely due to a higher body weight in the 
paediatric studies than the adult studies on which the SmPC values are based on, as body weight was a 
significant covariate for exposure. In the SmPC section 5.2, it is therefore now stated that the exposure 
(Cmax and AUC) is dependent on body weight, and the body mean weight that corresponds to the Cmax and 
AUC is reported.  Tmax was approximately 8-10 hours for all selected doses with no apparent dose 
dependency. This is acceptable. Tmax in children was similar to Tmax in adults (8-12 hours). Clearance was 
1.7 L/h, which is comparable to the clearance in adults (1.2 L/h). This is acceptable. T½ was assessed at the 
final dose, that is 0.6 mg (n=2) and 1.8 mg (N=9).  
No pharmacokinetic interaction studies were conducted in children. This is considered acceptable as no 
differences in drug-drug interactions are expected between children and adults.  
The Applicant presented data on secondary efficacy parameters from Trial 1800, which showed statistically 
significantly decreases in HbA1c and fructosamine in the Liraglutide treated subjects. The Applicant has not 
shown any dose-response results from study 1800. This would have been appreciated in order to evaluate 
the selection of the liraglutide dose in children. However, as the Applicant has shown dose response curves 
based on modelled data from study 3659, the lack of information regarding dose-response analysis in study 
1800 is acceptable. 
The Applicant has conducted two population PK (popPK) analyses: 1) a covariate analysis combining data 
from the two paediatric trials with data from two trials in adults with type 2 diabetes (Trial 3534 and Trial 
3673); and 2) comparing exposure in the paediatric population (trial 4659) with exposure in adults with type 
2 diabetes (Trial 1573).  
Regarding 1), the covariate analysis: in the two adult studies included in this analysis, concomitant 
treatment with glucose lowering drugs were allowed. This is not considered to affect the pharmacokinetics of 
liraglutide and is thus acceptable. The full model included effects of body weight (centred at 90 kg), sex and 
age group on CL/F and on V/F, which is considered relevant.  
Regarding 2), the exposure comparison: the comparability between the paediatric and adult studies seems 
reasonable.  
Dose proportionality analysis from trial 1800 showed a linear increase AUC with increasing dose from 0.3 mg 
liraglutide up to 1.8 mg. This is endorsed. Based on trial 3659, exposure increased with increasing dose in a 
weight adjusted model, which is endorsed.  
The popPK model showed that exposure increased with lower body weight, that males have lower body 
weight-adjusted exposure than females, and that no clinically relevant difference in exposure was observed 
for the paediatric population versus adults when adjusted for effects of covariates. The SmpC in section 5.2 
now reflects that exposure depends on body weight. The Applicant has included age as a binary variable in 
the model and has thus combined all age groups within the range 10-17 years to one parameter and age 
above 17 years to the other parameter. There were no marked differences between the 10-14 year age 
group and 14-17 year age group regarding exposure.  
Based on simulated steady-state concentration-time profiles following 1.8 mg liraglutide, no marked 
differences between adults and children were observed. This is endorsed.  
Data from the paediatric Trial 3659 and the adult Trial 1573 indicate similar distribution and range of body 
weight and similar concentrations at steady state in adults and paediatric subjects, which is endorsed.  
The exposure response curve shows a decrease in HbA1c with increasing liraglutide concentrations, which is 
endorsed.  
In the SmPC section 4.2 it is stated that some patients are expected to benefit from an increase in dose from 
1.2 mg to 1.8 mg. This was found to be acceptable. Moreover, in section 5.1, the proportion of patients in 
EMA/447330/2019

study 3659 who escalated to 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg respectively, as well who stayed at 0.6 mg, are now 
mentioned. 
2.2.3.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetic data supports the same liraglutide dose regimen for paediatric patients aged 10-17 
years with T2D, as used by adult patients with T2D. As body weight is an important covariate for exposure, 
this is reflected in the SmPC.

Methods 
Trial design 
Trial 3659 was a multinational, multi-centre, randomised, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial with a 
26-week double-blind period followed by a 26-week open-label extension in subjects with T2D aged 10−17 
years. The trial design is shown schematically Figure 2.

carcinoma 
The data from the 1- and 2-year safety follow-up (currently ongoing) will be described in a separate clinical 
trial report after the completion of the last follow-up visit by the last trial subject.  
The main part of the trial consisted of a 2-week screening period, an 11- to 12-week run-in period 
(consisting of 3-4 weeks of metformin titration and 8 weeks of metformin maintenance treatment), a 
26-week double-blind treatment, a 26-week open-label period and a one week follow-up period. A 26-week 
double-blind period was considered adequate to demonstrate an effect on long-term glycaemic control 
(HbA1c) and the 26-week open-label period was implemented to assess the longer-term safety of liraglutide 
treatment. 
The current standard of care for children and adolescents with T2D is metformin treatment or insulin, if 
needed. To ensure adequate care, subjects were treated with metformin at the approved MTD (≥1000 mg) 
throughout the trial. The aim of metformin titration during the run-in period was to reach a daily dose of 
2000 mg. Placebo was chosen as the comparator, as combination therapy with metformin was applied, and 
because no other antidiabetic medication, except for insulin, is widely approved for use in the paediatric T2D 
population.  
In the open-label period, unblinding was done to enable discontinuation of the placebo injections, which are 
considered a burden for children and adolescents. During the open-label treatment period, subjects treated 
with liraglutide continued their treatment regimen unchanged, whereas subjects treated with placebo 
continued treatment with the MTD of metformin (with or without basal insulin). 
For subjects experiencing confirmed hyperglycaemia and meeting the rescue criterion, rescue treatment 
(basal insulin addition or up-titration; followed by addition of rapid-acting insulin, if needed) was allowed. 
Subjects on rescue treatment were to remain in the trial unless hyperglycaemia persisted and they met the 
applicable withdrawal criteria.  
Trial population  
The trial was conducted at 84 sites in 25 countries on 5 continents, thereby ensuring representation of 
children and adolescents from different ethnical and cultural backgrounds. 
Treatments 
At randomisation, liraglutide dosing was started at 0.6 mg daily during the first week and escalated in weekly 
increments of 0.6 mg over the following 2-3 weeks to a maximum dose of 1.8 mg daily. Subjects randomised 
to placebo received doses of equivalent volume.  
Dose escalation was based on: 
• 
• 
tolerability (the dose was not to be increased in case of severe intolerability, as judged by the 
investigator); 
the average of 3 measurements of fasting SMPG on the 3 consecutive days preceding the dose 
escalation visit had to be >6.1 mmol/L (110 mg/dL). 
After the dose escalation period, no further dose escalation was to be performed. If a subject experienced 
severe intolerance or recurrent hypoglycaemia, as judged by the investigator (such as, ≥3 unexplained 
minor hypoglycaemic events, or 1 severe unexplained hypoglycaemic event in a week), the 
liraglutide/placebo dose was to be lowered to the next lower dose. If a subject on liraglutide 0.6 mg/day (or 
placebo dose-volume equivalent) experienced severe intolerance or recurrent hypoglycaemia the subject 
had to be withdrawn from the trial.

Duration of treatment 
The duration of treatment was 52 weeks for the subjects randomised to liraglutide and 26 weeks for the 
subjects randomised to placebo.  
All subjects received metformin (with or without basal insulin) for the duration of the trial. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to confirm the superiority of liraglutide at its maximum tolerated dose (0.6 mg, 
1.2 mg or 1.8 mg daily) versus placebo when added to metformin, with or without basal insulin treatment, 
in controlling glycaemia in children and adolescents (aged 10–17 years) with T2D. 
The secondary objectives were to assess and compare the effect of liraglutide versus placebo (both in 
combination with metformin, with or without basal insulin treatment) on parameters of glycaemic control, 
beta-cell function, body composition, vital signs, growth velocity, safety and tolerability. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to week 26 in HbA1c. 
The primary endpoint and confirmatory secondary endpoints were analysed in a hierarchical manner in the 
following order: 
• 
Primary endpoint (change in HbA1c from baseline to week 26) 
•  Change from baseline in FPG after 26 weeks of treatment 
•  HbA1c < 7.0% after 26 weeks of treatment (yes/no) 
•  Change from baseline in BMI SDS after 26 weeks of treatment 
To conclude on superiority for an endpoint in the list above, the results for that endpoint and for the 
endpoints higher up in the hierarchy had to show superiority of liraglutide over placebo. 
Sample size 
Two protocol amendments were issued to reduce the sample size, from 172 subject to 150 subjects and from 
150 subjects to 94 subjects, due to the difficulties in recruiting subjects to the trial. 
The sample size was determined to evaluate whether liraglutide was superior to placebo with regards to the 
primary endpoint. The primary endpoint was evaluated using a two-sided test and a significance level of 5%.  
Assumptions for the final calculations were as follows: 
•  Change in HbA1c from baseline to week 26: a mean difference of 0.9%-point and a standard 
deviation of 1.2%-point were assumed for liraglutide versus placebo, both in combination with 
metformin with or without basal insulin. This mean difference was chosen based on the effect of 
liraglutide versus placebo observed in the adult population (LEAD-1, -2, -4 and -5 trials)4-7 and Trial 
1800, in which the change in HbA1c after 5 weeks of treatment was an exploratory endpoint. 
• 
The assumed subject withdrawal rates were based on the withdrawal rates in the LEAD-2 trial5 
(approximately 40% in the placebo group and approximately 20% in the active groups). A slightly 
higher withdrawal rate was expected in a paediatric population, therefore, the withdrawal rate for 
the liraglutide group was assumed to be 22%. The primary analysis imputed values for withdrawn 
placebo subjects based on those in placebo completers, and thus the sample size was not adjusted 
for the withdrawal rate in the placebo group.  
EMA/447330/2019 
Page 13/52 
 
  
  
  
A sample size of 47 subjects per treatment arm of the FAS was calculated to yield a power of 80%. Assuming 
a screening failure rate of 65%, 269 subjects needed to be screened 
Randomisation/Blinding (masking) 
After the run-in period, subjects who fulfilled the randomisation criteria listed below were randomised 1:1 to 
either liraglutide or placebo:  
• 
• 
• 
the average of fasting SMPG values taken on the 3 consecutive days leading up to the randomisation 
visit was ≥7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL ) and ≤12.2 mmol/L (220 mg/dL) 
subjects had to have been on a stable dose of metformin ≥1000 mg and ≤2000 mg per day for at 
least 56 days (subjects who entered the trial on >2000 mg continued with that dose at 
randomisation) 
subjects treated with basal insulin had to have been on a stable dose for at least 56 days (stable 
dose of basal insulin was defined as basal insulin adjustments up to 15%). 
Randomisation was performed using centralised allocation via IV/WRS; subjects were stratified by sex and 
age at end of trial (≤14 years or >14 years; ≤14 years was defined as not reaching 14 years and 11 months 
at week 52).  
Subjects randomised to placebo received doses of equivalent volume as liraglutide during the dose 
escalation period and thereafter, to maintain blinding. In the 26-week open-label period, treatment 
allocation was unblinded to all subjects and site staff but was to remain blinded to the Novo Nordisk 
personnel assessing outcomes. The subjects randomised to placebo discontinued placebo injections in the 
open-label period. 
Statistical methods 
Efficacy variables and analysis sets 
The primary objective of Trial 3659 was to confirm the superiority of liraglutide at the maximum tolerated 
dose (0.6 mg, 1.2 mg or 1.8 mg) versus placebo when added to metformin with or without basal insulin 
treatment in controlling glycaemia, in children and adolescents (aged 10–17 years) with T2D.  
A superiority design was chosen based on the beneficial results observed with liraglutide (doses up to 1.8 
mg) in adults with T2D and the exploratory results for pharmacodynamic endpoints in the paediatric Trial 
1800. The safety and tolerability profile of liraglutide in children and adolescents with T2D in Trial 1800 was 
consistent with that observed in adults with T2D. 
The secondary objectives were to assess and compare the effect of liraglutide versus placebo (both in 
combination with metformin with or without basal insulin treatment) on other parameters of glycaemic 
control, beta-cell function, body composition, vital signs, growth (i.e., height velocity), safety and 
tolerability. 
As pre-specified in the protocol, the efficacy analyses were conducted on the full analysis set, defined as 
including all randomised subjects receiving at least one dose of liraglutide or placebo. 
Primary and secondary statistical analyses 
The primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint, the confirmatory secondary endpoints and supportive 
secondary endpoints was based on a PMM using multiple imputations and including data collected after 
initiation of rescue medication or discontinuation of treatment for all subjects in the full analysis set. The 
imputed data sets were analysed using an ANCOVA model with treatment and stratification group (sex*age 
group) as fixed effects and baseline parameter value as a covariate. A pre-specified secondary analysis was 
performed for all endpoints analysed statistically. This analysis was based on a MMRM and excluded data 
EMA/447330/2019 
Page 14/52 
 
  
  
  
collected after initiation of rescue medication or discontinuation of treatment. Fixed effects in the model 
were treatment and stratification group (sex*age group) and baseline parameter value was a covariate, all 
nested within visit. The dichotomous endpoints were analysed using a logistic regression model with missing 
data imputed from either the PMM or MMRM. Furthermore, for the primary endpoint, five additional 
sensitivity analyses were performed that used different approaches to account for the missing data. The 
statistical analyses were performed with a significance level of 5% (two-sided test). 
In order to conclude on superiority for a confirmatory endpoint, the primary analysis (PMM) results for that 
endpoint and for the endpoints higher up in the hierarchy had to show superiority of liraglutide treatment 
over placebo treatment. 
A p-value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. 
In the following sections, the evaluation of clinical efficacy is based on the results of the PMM analysis.

Results 
Participant flow 
In Trial 3659, 135 of 307 screened subjects were randomised (1:1); 66 subjects to the liraglutide group and 
69 subjects to placebo group ( 
Table 2). One (1) subject in the placebo group withdrew before being exposed to treatment and was 
excluded from both the full analysis set (FAS) and the safety analysis set.  
The majority (87.4%; 60 randomised to liraglutide and 58 randomised to placebo) of the 134 exposed 
subjects completed the 26-week double-blind period. A higher proportion of subjects in the liraglutide group 
(86.4%) than in the placebo group (66.7%) completed this period without rescue medication. A total of 56 
(84.8%) subjects randomised to liraglutide and 53 (76.8%) subjects randomised to placebo completed the 
trial (52-week period and 1-week follow-up).  
Of the 10 liraglutide subjects and 16 placebo subjects who withdrew, 6 and 8 subjects, respectively, did so 
due to meeting a withdrawal criterion, and 4 subjects in each group withdrew due to non-compliance. One 
subject randomised to placebo withdrew due to an AE and 3 others for a reason ‘other’. One of the subjects 
in the liraglutide group who withdrew due to non-compliance discontinued liraglutide treatment permanently 
due to an AE (‘hyperglycaemia’).

Dosing 
The planned duration of treatment was 52 weeks for subjects randomised to liraglutide and 26 weeks for 
those randomised to placebo. Subjects initiated liraglutide (and placebo) at a daily dose of 0.6 mg and then 
increased their dose by weekly 0.6 mg increments over 2−3 weeks. The dose escalation was based on 
tolerability, as judged by the investigator, and having FPG >6.1 mmol/L (110 mg/dL; average of 3

consecutive daily SMPGs preceding each dose escalation visit). Once subjects completed their dose 
escalation period, they were to continue on their maximum tolerated dose for the rest of the trial.  
By week 3, 28.6% of the subjects in the liraglutide group were on the 0.6 mg dose, 15.9% were on the 1.2 
mg dose and 55.6% were on the 1.8 mg dose. From week 3 and throughout the duration of the trial (up to 
week 48 in the liraglutide group and up to week 26 in the placebo group), the doses of liraglutide and placebo 
remained relatively constant. The main reason for not escalating the dose to the next level at weeks 1 and 
2 was the attainment of the FPG value of ≤6.1 mmol/L (more frequent in the liraglutide group than in the 
placebo group). Importantly, throughout dose escalation, less than 10% of the subjects in either treatment 
group (6 subjects in the liraglutide group and 4 subjects in the placebo group) refrained from increasing 
their dose due to intolerance. In the liraglutide group, intolerance primarily involved gastrointestinal AEs 
(i.e., nausea and/or vomiting; 4 out of 6 subjects). 
Exposure 
During the double-blind period, cumulative exposure to liraglutide and placebo was 31.0 and 31.4 years, 
respectively, with a mean exposure of 0.47 and 0.46 years per subject, respectively; 38 subjects in the 
liraglutide group and 54 subjects in the placebo group reached the maximum daily dose of 1.8 mg with a 
mean exposure at this maximum dose of 0.39 and 0.40 years per subject, respectively. Subjects in the 
liraglutide group accumulated 59.6 years of exposure over 52 weeks of treatment (mean of 0.90 years per 
subject); accumulated exposure by dose was 17.7 years (0.6 mg), 11.6 years (1.2 mg) and 29.9 years (1.8 
mg).  
Baseline data 
Baseline subject characteristics 
In general, demographics were well balanced between the treatment groups (Table 3). The subjects’ mean 
age was 14.6 years, ranging from 10.0 to 16.9 years at baseline; 30% of the subjects were 10−14 years old 
(age at end of treatment) and 62% of the subjects were female. The subjects had had diabetes for a mean 
of 1.9 years. Mean HbA1c was 7.78 % and mean BMI was 33.9 kg/m2.  
Most subjects resided in North America (35.1%) or Europe (defined in this trial as including Belgium, 
Hungary, Israel, Macedonia, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Turkey and the United Kingdom; 33.6%), with 
the rest residing in South America (i.e., Mexico), Asia, Oceania and Africa. The proportion of subjects from 
EU and EU-like countries (i.e., countries with lifestyle and diabetes care similar to the EU member states) 
was 45%; countries included in this classification are: Australia, Belgium, Canada, Hungary, Israel, Poland, 
Portugal, Macedonia, Mexico, Russia, Spain and United Kingdom. Approximately two-thirds (64.9%) of the 
subjects were White. Racial and ethnic minorities were also represented: 13.4% of the subjects were Asian, 
11.9% were Black/African American and 29.1% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. 
The subject demographic and baseline characteristics were similar between EU countries and EU-like 
countries. Likewise, the subject demographic and baseline characteristics were similar between the US and 
the non-US countries, with the exception of weight-related parameters, which were higher in the US than in 
the non-US countries.

HbA1c 
Treatment with liraglutide led to a reduction in HbA1c from baseline to week 26 (-0.64%), with this reduction 
being maintained in the open-label period up to week 52 (-0.50%); with placebo, HbA1c increased from 
baseline to weeks 26 (0.42%) and 52 (0.80%), as shown in Figure 3 and summarised in Table 4.. The 
estimated treatment differences (ETDs) were statistically significantly in favour of liraglutide both at weeks 
26 and 52 and superiority of liraglutide over placebo at week 26 was confirmed.

Means are estimated from a mixed model of repeated measurements (MMRM) containing treatment (sex*age) group as 
fixed effects and baseline value as covariate, all nested within visit. Results from a pattern mixture model (PMM) are 
shown at weeks 26 and 52. 
For MMRM results data collected after treatment discontinuation or initiation of rescue medication were handled as 
missing data.

The robustness of the conclusions based on the primary analysis of the primary endpoint (change from 
baseline in HbA1c at week 26) was confirmed by six sensitivity analyses. The sensitivity analyses 
consistently showed statistically significant estimated treatment differences in favour of liraglutide (Figure 
4).

HbA1c treatment targets 
At baseline, the proportions of subjects who had achieved various treatment targets were relatively high, 
reflecting the fact that all subjects had to have had at least 8 weeks of treatment with metformin at their 
MTD prior to randomisation (baseline). Thus, some subjects had already improved their HbA1c in the run-in 
period between screening and randomisation. In addition, subjects with HbA1c ≥ 6.5% and ≤ 11%, were 
allowed in the trial, if they were being treated with metformin, or basal insulin, or both. Nevertheless, 
treatment with liraglutide resulted in consistently greater proportions of responders (of all categories) than 
with placebo, both at weeks 26 and 52, with statistically significant odds ratios (except for HbA1c <7.0% 
without severe or minor hypoglycaemic episodes at week 52, for which p=0.072) (Table 5). 
Similar results were obtained using the MMRM imputation.

Plasma glucose  
Fasting plasma glucose 
Treatment with liraglutide led to a reduction from baseline to week 26 in FPG (-1.08 mmol/L), with this 
reduction being maintained in the open-label period up to week 52 (-1.03 mmol/L); with placebo, FPG 
increased from baseline to week 26 (0.80 mmol/L) and week 52 (0.78 mmol/L), as shown in Figure 5 and 
summarised in  
Table 6 Thus, the ETDs were statistically significantly in favour of liraglutide both at weeks 26 and 52, and 
superiority of liraglutide over placebo at week 26 was confirmed.

Self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) 
Subjects were instructed to perform a 7-point SMPG profile prior to the randomisation visit and visits at 
weeks 14, 26 and 52. The SMPG levels were to be recorded before breakfast, 90 minutes after start of

breakfast, before lunch, 90 minutes after start of lunch, before dinner, 90 minutes after start of dinner and 
at bedtime. 
The mean plots of the 7-point SMPG profiles indicated a greater improvement in the liraglutide group than in 
the placebo group at week 26, which is also reflected in the results of the analysis of the mean of the 7-point 
SMPG presented in Table 7. There were no statistically significant differences between the treatment groups 
in the mean of meal increments ( 
Table 8).

It may be noted that the proportion of missing data for the SMPG endpoints was larger than for the fasting 
plasma glucose endpoints, probably attributable to the fact that the SMPG assessments were performed at 
home whereas the fasting glucose samples were taken at site. Home assessments are expected to be a 
greater challenge than site assessments in this trial population, in turn leading to greater variation in the 
results based on self-measured data. 
Body weight-related parameters 
BMI SDS 
Treatment with liraglutide led to a reduction in BMI SDS from baseline to week 26 (-0.254), with a further 
reduction in the open-label period up to week 52 (-0.336); with placebo, BMI SDS decreased less than with 
liraglutide (-0.208 at week 26 and -0.159 at week 52), as shown Figure 6 and summarised in  
Table 9.

Clinical studies in special populations 
This trial was not powered to show differences by subgroups and the number of subjects in the subgroups 
10-14 years was low, therefore, all results should be interpreted with caution. 
Age 
The observed mean changes over time in HbA1c by age group (10-14 years and >14 years) suggest a similar 
difference between liraglutide and placebo treatment in the two age subgroups. 
The difference in the observed mean change from baseline in BMI SDS between liraglutide and placebo 
treatment appeared to be greater in the subgroup >14 years old than in the subgroup 10-14 years old (the 
liraglutide subgroup aged >14 had the largest reduction, and the placebo group aged >14 had the smallest 
reduction, in BMI SDS at week 52). 
Basal insulin 
The influence of treatment with basal insulin at baseline (yes/no) on the change from baseline in HbA1c was 
investigated in a pre-specified exploratory analysis. The treatment difference between liraglutide and 
placebo was larger in the subjects who took basal insulin (in addition to metformin) at baseline than in the 
subjects who did not. However, in both groups there was a clinically relevant and statistically significant 
difference on hbA1c.  
Analysis of clinical information relevant to dosing recommendations 
The clinical pharmacology trial, Trial 1800, provided evidence that the pharmacokinetics and exposure in 
paediatric subjects aged 10 to 17 years with a body weight ranging between 57 kg and 214 kg were similar 
to those in adults. Based on an evaluation of tolerability, safety and the exposure levels in Trial 1800, a 
starting dose of liraglutide 0.6 mg daily, with subsequent weekly increments of 0.6 mg over 2-3 weeks to the 
maximum dose 1.8 mg daily, was chosen for Trial 3659.  
Dose escalation in Trial 3659 was not forced, but dependent both on tolerability (as judged by the 
investigator) and glycaemic control in the individual subject (as assessed by SMPG). By week 3, 28.6% of 
the subjects in the liraglutide group were on the 0.6 mg dose, 15.9% were on the 1.2 mg dose and 55.6% 
were on the 1.8 mg dose. From week 3 and throughout the duration of the trial (up to week 48 in the 
liraglutide group and up to week 26 in the placebo group), the doses of liraglutide and placebo remained 
relatively constant

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Trial 3659 was a multinational, multi-centre, randomised, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial with a 
26-week double-blind period followed by a 26-week open-label extension in subjects with T2D aged 10−17 
years. The main part of the trial consisted of a 26 week double-blind treatment period and a 26-week 
open-label period.  
The design of the trial is acceptable and was in line with the PIP. However, a randomised treatment period 
of 26 weeks is relatively short for a medicine that is intended to be used for many decades.  
The indication as approved in adults was not supported in full by the paediatric data. Liraglutide 
monotherapy has not been investigated in paediatric subjects. During the procedure, therefore the question 
was raised to what extent extrapolation (from adult data and/or from the paediatric data available) is 
possible. In addition, with regard to combined therapy, it should be noted that liraglutide has not been 
studied in combinations other than metformin ±insulin.  
The doses of liraglutide were similar to those used in adults. Given the results of pharmacokinetic trial (Trial 
1800), this is acceptable. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The subjects’ mean age was 14.6 years, ranging from 10.0 to 16.9 years at baseline; 30% of the subjects 
were 10−14 years old (age at end of treatment) and 62% of the subjects were female. The subjects had had 
diabetes for a mean of 1.9 years. Mean HbA1c was 7.78 % and mean BMI was 33.9 kg/m2 (with a mean 
body weight of 91.5 kg).  
Of the 307 screened subjects, 135 were randomised (1:1); 66 subjects to the liraglutide group and 69 
subjects to placebo group. A higher proportion of subjects in the liraglutide group (90.9%) than in the 
placebo group (84.1%) completed the 26-week double-blind period, and the proportion was higher in the 
oldest age group. In general, demographics were well balanced between the treatment groups.  
In the liraglutide group total and mean exposure to 0.6 and 1.2 mg liraglutide were higher and total 
exposure to 1.8 mg was lower compared with the placebo group. This reflects the observation that a smaller 
proportion in the liraglutide group increased their dose to the next level at weeks 1 and 2 compared with the 
placebo group. The main reason for no dose escalation was a fasting plasma glucose of 6.1 mmol/l or lower. 
This is acceptable. Less than 10% of the subjects in either treatment group refrained from increasing their 
dose due to intolerance.  
HbA1c 
Treatment with liraglutide led to a reduction in HbA1c from baseline to week 26 (-0.64%), with this reduction 
being maintained in the open-label period up to week 52 (-0.50%); with placebo, HbA1c increased from 
baseline to weeks 26 (0.42%) and 52 (0.80%). The estimated treatment difference was -1.058 % [-1.653; 
-0.464]95%CI (p=<0.001). In addition, treatment with liraglutide resulted in consistently greater 
proportions of hbA1c <7.0% responders (of all categories) than with placebo, both at weeks 26 and 52, with 
statistically significant odds ratios.  
Glucose  
Treatment with liraglutide led to a reduction from baseline to week 26 in FPG (-1.08 mmol/L), with this 
reduction being maintained in the open-label period up to week 52 (-1.03 mmol/L); with placebo, FPG 
increased from baseline to week 26 (0.80 mmol/L) and week 52 (0.78 mmol/L). 
EMA/447330/2019 
Page 29/52 
 
  
  
  
The mean plots of the 7-point SMPG profiles indicated a greater improvement in the liraglutide group than in 
the placebo group at week 26. 
BMI 
During the blinded treatment period, treatment with liraglutide did not lead to a significant decrease in BMI 
SDS compared to placebo (placebo adjusted change in BMI SDS -0.047[CI -0.153; 0.060]; p-value 0.392). 
This corresponded to a non-significant change in body weight of -1.3 kg [CI -3.013; 0.377]; p=0.128). After 
deblinding, liraglutide was associated with a significant decrease in BMI SDS of -0.177 [CI -0.327; -0.027]; 
p-value 0.021. This corresponded to a change in body weight of -2.8 kg [CI -5.014; -0.535]; p=0.015). 
Other outcome measures 
There were no relevant changes in blood pressure. There were no significant changes in total cholesterol and 
HDL cholesterol. Greater reductions in VLDL cholesterol and triglycerides were observed with liraglutide than 
with placebo, with statistically significant differences at week 26. 
The observed geometric mean daily dose of basal insulin decreased from 23.3 units at baseline to 22.4 units 
at week 26 in the liraglutide group and increased from 23.0 units to 27.1 units in the placebo group.  
Subgroups 
There were no relevant differences by subgroups age and insulin at baseline. However, the number of 
subjects in the subgroups was low. In adults, efficacy was not significantly different between men and 
women.  
2.3.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In paediatric subjects treated with metformin with or without basal insulin, six months of treatment with the 
maximum tolerated dose of liraglutide (0.6, 1.2 or 1.8 mg) was associated with a clinically relevant decrease 
in HbA1c compared to placebo (-1.1 %). After deblinding, the treatment effect of liraglutide on HbA1c was 
sustained up to one year.  
Compared to placebo, small reductions in BMI SDS were seen with liraglutide at 6 months, corresponding to 
a treatment difference of -1.3 kg in body weight. This difference was not statistically significant, hence 
superiority of liraglutide over placebo was not confirmed. After deblinding, the effect of liraglutide on BMI 
SDS increases corresponding to a treatment difference of -2.8 kg after 1 year. This effect was not 
statistically significant, but this may be due to the small number of subjects. The point estimate is in line with 
effects of liraglutide 1.2 and 1.8 mg in the larger adult study LEAD-2 (trial 1572). In addition, in the 
paediatric study, approximately 30% of the patient were using the lowest dose of liraglutide (0.6 mg). 
More subjects in the liraglutide group were not escalated in dose to 1.8 mg due to reach of target or 
intolerability. There were no marked differences with regards to age, which supports a similar posology of 
the youngest and oldest age group. There was however a tendency that those with the lowest body weight 
did not escalate in dose to liraglutide 1.8 mg. The SmPC is now reflecting the influence of body weight on 
liraglutide plasma concentration. There were no relevant differences by subgroups age and insulin at 
baseline. However, the number of subjects in the subgroups was low.  
The design of the trial was acceptable and in line with the PIP.

2.4.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
In the evaluation of safety, results from the larger phase 3a trial (Trial 3659) are given primary focus and are 
described in the following sections. The safety results from the phase 1 trial (Trial 1800) showed that 
liraglutide (0.3−1.8 mg) was safe and well tolerated in paediatric subjects with T2D aged 10−17 years, with 
a safety profile similar to that in adults with T2D. 
In Trial 3659, all safety endpoints addressed the secondary objective and included AEs, hypoglycaemic 
episodes, laboratory parameters related to safety, clinical evaluations, height/growth-related parameters 
and pubertal progression. Medical events of special interest (MESI) are also described. A MESI is an event 
which, in the evaluation of safety, has a special focus. The protocol-defined areas of interest for MESI 
reporting in Trial 3659 are listed in Trial 3659. In addition, MedDRA searches based on SMQs, SOCs, HLGTs, 
HLTs and/or PTs were specified for pre-defined safety areas of interest (Trial 3659). Hypoglycaemic 
episodes were also classified according to the Novo Nordisk classification (minor hypoglycaemia) and the 
ADA classification (Trial 3659). The ADA-classified hypoglycaemic episodes included all reported 
hypoglycaemia. 
The AEs, hypoglycaemic episodes and MESI described in this document are treatment emergent. An event 
(or episode) was defined as treatment emergent if it had an onset on or after the first day of exposure to 
randomised treatment and no later than 7 days (1 day for hypoglycaemic episodes) after the last day on 
randomised treatment (in the placebo group, events in the open-label period were defined as treatment 
emergent although the subjects were only treated with metformin, with or without insulin). All AEs were 
coded using MedDRA version 21.0. Event rates were calculated as events per 1000 PYE. 
All safety parameters were summarised descriptively using the safety analysis set, which included all 
subjects receiving at least one dose of the investigational product or its comparator. In addition, resting 
pulse was analysed in the same manner as other supportive secondary endpoints using a PMM with multiple 
imputations and an MMRM model only including data before initiation of rescue medication. 
The safety evaluation mainly refers to the blinded treatment period (weeks 0 to 26) and the entire treatment 
period (weeks 0 to 52). The open-label treatment period comprised treatment weeks 27−52. 
Patient exposure 
Of the 307 screened subjects, 135 were randomised (1:1); 66 subjects to the liraglutide group and 69 
subjects to placebo group. One subject in the placebo group withdrew before exposure to trial treatment and 
was excluded from both the full analysis set and the safety analysis set. The majority (118) of the 134 
exposed subjects (60 randomised to liraglutide and 58 randomised to placebo) completed treatment in the 
blinded period. A higher proportion of subjects in the liraglutide (86.4%) versus placebo (66.7%) group 
completed this period without rescue medication. A total of 56 (84.8%) subjects treated with liraglutide and 
53 (76.8%) subjects randomised to placebo completed the entire 52-week treatment period. Of the 10 
liraglutide subjects and 16 placebo subjects who discontinued, most were withdrawn for meeting a 
withdrawal criterion (6 and 8 subjects in the two groups, respectively) followed by non-compliance (4 
subjects in each group). One subject randomised to placebo withdrew as a result of an AE and 3 others for 
a reason of ‘other’. In the liraglutide group, one subject discontinued liraglutide treatment permanently due 
to an AE of ‘hyperglycaemia’; however the primary reason for withdrawal was non-compliance.

Adverse events  
A total of 310 and 230 AEs were reported for the liraglutide and placebo groups, respectively, during the 
blinded treatment period. The majority of AEs in both treatment groups were non-serious, mild in severity, 
judged as unlikely to be related to trial product by the investigator and had an outcome of resolved. Although 
the proportions of subjects who experienced AEs were similar in the liraglutide and placebo groups (78.8% 
versus 76.5%, respectively), the rate of AEs was higher in the liraglutide group (9992 versus 7330 events 
per 1000 PYE). The difference in the rate of all adverse events in the liraglutide and placebo groups appeared 
primarily to be driven by the higher rates of GI AEs (primarily nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal 
pain) in the liraglutide group. 
During the entire treatment period, 426 and 321 AEs were reported in the liraglutide and placebo groups, 
respectively. The majority of these occurred during the blinded treatment period: ~73% (310/426) in the 
liraglutide group and ~72% (230/321) in the placebo group. The AE pattern during the entire treatment 
period was very similar to that in the blinded treatment period. 
Common adverse events 
The nature and frequency of the most commonly reported AEs during the entire treatment period were very 
similar to those seen during the blinded treatment period. The most common AEs (occurring in ≥5% of 
subjects) in the liraglutide group during the entire treatment period belonged to the SOC gastrointestinal 
disorders (Figure 7). The proportion of subjects with AEs within the SOC gastrointestinal disorders, as well 
as the AE rate, were higher in the liraglutide group compared to the placebo group during the entire 
treatment period: 56.1% and 2381 events per 1000 PYE versus 36.8% and 896 events per 1000 PYE, 
respectively (Trial 3659). This imbalance was mainly driven by the PTs ‘nausea’, ‘vomiting’, ‘diarrhoea’ and 
‘abdominal pain’, all more prevalent in the liraglutide group (28.8%, 25.8%, 22.7% and 18.2% of subjects, 
respectively). The incidence of all GI AEs was mainly higher in the liraglutide group than in the placebo group 
during the initial 8 weeks of treatment and then remained comparable between the treatment groups until 
the end of the entire treatment period (Figure 8). The prevalence of ongoing GI AEs declined in the placebo 
group during the open-label period (i.e., after treatment allocation unblinding); Trial 3659.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No deaths were reported in Trial 3659. 
A total of 15 SAEs occurred during the entire treatment period. Of the 10 SAEs reported in the liraglutide 
group during the entire treatment period, the majority of events (7) occurred during the blinded treatment 
period. The proportion of subjects with SAEs, as well as the event rate, was higher in the liraglutide group 
than in the placebo group during both the blinded and the entire treatment periods (Table 13). An 
examination of individual PTs did not reveal clear drivers of this imbalance. In the liraglutide group, the SAEs 
occurred as single events and were distributed throughout different SOCs with no apparent clustering. In the 
liraglutide group, all SAEs had an outcome of ‘resolved’ and the majority were considered unlikely to be 
related to treatment by the investigator.

During the blinded treatment period, in the liraglutide group, 2 PTs were within the SOC ‘Gastrointestinal 
disorders’ (‘diarrhoea’ and ‘abdominal pain’), whereas the rest of the SOCs each contained a single PT 
(‘glycosylated haemoglobin increased’, ‘vertigo’, ‘abscess neck’, ‘fibroadenoma of breast’, 
EMA/447330/2019 
Page 33/52 
 
  
  
  
 
 
‘hyperglycaemia’). In the placebo group, 3 out of 4 SAEs were related to loss of glycaemic control (‘diabetes 
mellitus inadequate control’ in 1 subject; ‘hyperglycaemia’ and ‘glycosylated haemoglobin increased’ in 
another subject. The 3 SAEs in 3 liraglutide-treated subjects reported during the open-label treatment 
period were distributed among different PTs (‘viral infections’, ‘nervous system disorders’ and ‘scoliosis’) and 
did not change the conclusion of ‘no SAE clustering within SOCs’ based on the blinded treatment period 
Other significant adverse events 
Medical events of special interest 
The vast majority of MESI in the liraglutide group (9 out of 10 events) and the majority of MESI in the 
placebo group (2 out of 3 events) were reported during the blinded treatment period ). The reported MESI 
in both groups were primarily single events (Table 14). In the liraglutide group, approximately a third of the 
events (3 out of 10) related to accidental overdose and suspicion of overdose and another third of the events 
(3 out of 10) related to elevated clinical laboratory parameters. Three (3) related MESI (‘pancreatic enzymes 
increased’, ‘overdose’ and ‘blood creatinine increased’) were reported for 1 liraglutide-treated subject. The 
detected elevations in laboratory parameters led to a suspicion of overdose in this subject (reported as a 
MESI ‘overdose’).

The results of the MedDRA search for AEs related to allergic reactions showed a numerical imbalance in 
disfavour of liraglutide, although the number of events in both treatment groups was low (liraglutide group: 
12 AEs in 10 subjects, placebo group: 5 AEs in 4 subjects). 
Adverse event leading to withdrawal 
A total of 3 AEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuations were reported (all in the blinded treatment 
period): 1 AE in the liraglutide group and 2 AEs in 1 subject in the placebo group . All 3 AEs were related to 
loss of glycaemic control (liraglutide: ‘hyperglycaemia’, placebo: ‘hyperglycaemia’ and ‘glycosylated 
haemoglobin increased’). The AE in the liraglutide group occurred on study day 23 and was non-serious, mild 
in severity and had an outcome of ‘not resolved’. The subject was withdrawn from the trial; however, the 
primary reason for withdrawal was non-compliance. In the placebo group, the subject withdrew from the 
trial due to the AEs. 
Adverse events leading to dose reduction or temporary treatment discontinuation 
In total, 2 AEs leading to dose reduction were reported, 1 in each group. Both AEs were reported during the 
blinded treatment period, were within the SOC gastrointestinal disorders and were considered to be 
probably related to trial product (liraglutide or placebo) by the investigator. In the liraglutide group, the 
event leading to dose reduction, ‘diarrhoea’, occurred on study day 176 and was serious, moderate in 
severity and had an outcome of ‘resolved’. The daily liraglutide dose was reduced from 1.8 mg to 0.6 mg due 
to the SAE and the subject received the 0.6 mg dose for the remainder of the trial.  
Few AEs leading to temporary discontinuation of liraglutide or placebo were reported (8 AEs in 4 subjects in 
the liraglutide group and 2 AEs in 1 subject in the placebo group), all in the blinded treatment period. 
Hypoglycaemic episodes 
Both in the blinded and the entire treatment periods, the proportion of subjects experiencing hypoglycaemic 
episodes (both minor and ADA-classified) and the episode rates, were higher in the liraglutide group than in 
the placebo group (Table 15). The vast majority of ADA-classified episodes in both treatment groups were 
classified as either asymptomatic or documented symptomatic. Both the proportion of subjects experiencing 
asymptomatic and documented symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes and the episode rates, were higher in 
the liraglutide group than in the placebo group (Table 16). No severe hypoglycaemic episodes occurred in 
the liraglutide group. One (1) severe hypoglycaemic episode was reported in a 15-year-old male subject in 
the placebo group. In addition to placebo, the subject received concomitant daily treatment with metformin 
2000 mg and 35 IU of basal insulin (insulin glargine).

Insulin use within 24 hours prior to the hypoglycaemic episode was associated with higher rates of minor and 
ADA-classified episodes in both treatment groups. However, the proportion of subjects experiencing 
hypoglycaemic episodes, as well as the episode rate, were higher in the liraglutide group than in the placebo 
group irrespective of  insulin use prior to the hypoglycaemic episode (

Laboratory findings 
There were no clinically relevant changes from baseline or differences between groups in safety laboratory 
parameters (haematology, biochemistry, hormones, urinalysis and bone metabolism), although, small 
increases in geometric mean pancreatic enzyme levels were observed in the liraglutide group.  
At week 26, the amylase activity in the liraglutide group was slightly higher compared to baseline and 
compared to that in the placebo group (liraglutide: 55.28 U/L versus placebo: 49.84 U/L). At week 52, the 
amylase activity in the liraglutide group was also slightly higher compared to that in the placebo group 
(liraglutide: 53.49 U/L versus placebo: 51.47 U/L).  
At weeks 26 and 52, lipase activity in the liraglutide group was higher compared to baseline and compared 
to that in the placebo group at these time points: week 26 (liraglutide: 29.16 U/L versus placebo: 24.30 
U/L), week 52 (liraglutide: 29.33 U/L versus placebo: 26.60 U/L)The clinical significance of pancreatic 
enzyme elevations with liraglutide is unknown in the absence of other signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. 
At week 53 (after the end of the entire treatment period), anti-liraglutide antibodies were detected in 5 
(8.5%) subjects in the liraglutide group. The levels of anti liraglutide antibodies in terms of % B/T in the 5 
subjects were low (< 5.3). None were cross reacting with native GLP-1 or were in vitro neutralising 
antibodies. Although the low number of subjects who developed anti-liraglutide antibodies precludes firm 
conclusions, given the low antibody levels and the lack of in vitro neutralising effect, it is unlikely that 
antibody development had an impact on the efficacy and safety of liraglutide during 1 year of treatment. This 
is supported by the observation that HbA1c and FPG response patterns were similar in the subjects who 
developed antibodies and in those who did not.  
Vital signs, physical findings, pubertal progression and other observations 
related to safety 
There were no clinically relevant changes from baseline or differences between the liraglutide and placebo 
groups in resting pulse, physical examination, electrocardiogram, as well as parameters related to pubertal 
progression and growth/height during the entire treatment period. 
Safety in special populations 
Aside from the paediatric population, no other subgroups were defined.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
A total of 3 AEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuations were reported (all in the blinded treatment 
period): 1 AE in the liraglutide group and 2 AEs in 1 subject in the placebo group. All 3 AEs were related to 
loss of glycaemic control (liraglutide: ‘hyperglycaemia’, placebo: ‘hyperglycaemia’ and ‘glycosylated 
haemoglobin increased’). The AE in the liraglutide group occurred on study day 23 and was non-serious, mild 
in severity and had an outcome of ‘not resolved’. The subject was withdrawn from the trial; however, the 
primary reason for withdrawal was non-compliance. In the placebo group, the subject withdrew from the 
trial due to the AEs. 
Post marketing experience 
Liraglutide is not approved for use in the paediatric population.

2.4.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In general, the results of Trial 3659 have demonstrated that liraglutide has a safety profile comparable to 
that in adults with T2D. However, a randomised treatment period of 26 weeks is relatively short for a drug 
that is intended to be used for many decades.  
Total and mean exposure to the 0.6 mg and 1.2 mg doses was higher in the liraglutide group than in the 
placebo group. Fewer subjects in the liraglutide group than in the placebo group (38 versus 54, respectively) 
reached the maximum daily dose of 1.8 mg, hence total exposure to the 1.8 mg dose was lower in the 
liraglutide group than in the placebo group. There was a tendency toward an increased frequency of adverse 
events with increasing dose. 
Adverse events 
Although the proportions of subjects who experienced AEs were similar in the liraglutide and placebo groups 
(78.8% versus 76.5%, respectively), the rate of AEs was higher in the liraglutide group (9992 versus 7330 
events per 1000 PYE). The difference in the rate of all adverse events in the liraglutide and placebo groups 
appeared primarily to be driven by the higher rates of GI AEs (primarily nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and 
abdominal pain) in the liraglutide group. 
A total of 3 AEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuations were reported (all in the blinded treatment 
period): 1 AE in the liraglutide group and 2 AEs in 1 subject in the placebo group. 
Serious averse events 
The proportion of subjects with SAEs, as well as the event rate, was higher in the liraglutide group than in the 
placebo group during both the blinded (9.1% vs 4.4%) and the entire treatment periods (13.6% vs 5.9%). 
There was no SAE clustering within SOCs.  
Gastrointestinal adverse events 
The proportion of subjects with AEs within the SOC gastrointestinal disorders, as well as the AE rate, were 
higher in the liraglutide group compared to the placebo group during the entire treatment period: 56.1% and 
2381 events per 1000 PYE versus 36.8% and 896 events per 1000 PYE, respectively (Trial 3659). The 
incidence of all GI AEs was mainly higher in the liraglutide group than in the placebo group during the initial 
8 weeks of treatment and then remained comparable between the treatment groups until the end of the 
entire treatment period. The proportion of children and adolescents experiencing at least one episode of 
diarrhoea with liraglutide treatment are markedly higher than in adults treated with liraglutide. This might 
reflect a higher risk of diarrhoea among children and adolescents, as the proportion of subjects in the 
placebo group with an episode of diarrhoea is also higher among children than among adults .  
Other adverse events  
The proportion of subjects with medical events of special interest was higher in the liraglutide group than in 
the placebo group (during the entire treatment periods 9.1% vs 4.4%).  
Both in the blinded and the entire treatment periods, the proportion of subjects experiencing hypoglycaemic 
episodes and the episode rates, were higher in the liraglutide group than in the placebo group. During the 
blinded period, ADA defined total hypoglycaemia was 34.8% in the liraglutide group vs. 20.6% in the 
placebo group. In addition, during the blinded treatment period, the proportion of subjects experiencing 
documented symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes (ADA defined) was also higher in the liraglutide group 
than in the placebo group (19.7% vs. 8.8%). No severe hypoglycaemic episodes occurred in the liraglutide 
group. The proportion of subjects experiencing hypoglycaemic episodes, as well as the episode rate, were 
higher in the liraglutide group than in the placebo group irrespective of insulin use prior to the 
hypoglycaemic episode (OC). This risk is described in the SmPC.

There were no clinically relevant changes from baseline or differences between groups in safety laboratory 
parameters (haematology, biochemistry, hormones, urinalysis and bone metabolism), although, small 
increases in geometric mean pancreatic enzyme levels were observed in the liraglutide group. The clinical 
significance of pancreatic enzyme elevations with liraglutide is unknown, but current evidence does not 
suggest negative long term effects. 
Heart rate increased by 4.23 beats/min during the first 6 weeks and declined to near baseline values by 
week 52. As increased heart rate is associated with worse cardiovascular outcome, current evidence does 
not suggest negative long-term effects.  
At week 53 (after the end of the entire treatment period), anti-liraglutide antibodies were detected in 5 
(8.5%) subjects in the liraglutide group. This is in line with the information in the SmPC (8.6%). Given the 
low antibody levels and the lack of in vitro neutralising effect, it is unlikely that antibody development had an 
impact on the efficacy and safety of liraglutide during 1 year of treatment. HbA1c response patterns were 
similar in the subjects who developed antibodies and in those who did not.  
2.4.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
In general, the results of Trial 3659 have demonstrated that liraglutide has a safety profile comparable to 
that in adults with T2D. However, a randomised treatment period of 26 weeks is relatively short for a 
medicine that is intended to be used for many decades. Long term effects in children may be different due 
to the fact that organs are still in a developmental state.  
Similar to adults, the incidence of all GI AEs was mainly higher in the liraglutide group than in the placebo 
group during the initial 8 weeks of treatment and then remained comparable between the treatment groups.  
In contrast to adults, the proportion of subjects experiencing hypoglycaemic episodes were higher in the 
liraglutide group than in the placebo group, irrespective of insulin use prior to the hypoglycaemic episode. 
This is different from the findings with liraglutide in adults. In adults, liraglutide was associated with 
hypoglycaemia in individuals in combination with insulin (or SU), but it was not associated with 
hypoglycaemia without use of insulin (or SU). This risk is described in the SmPC.   
The clinical significance of elevations in pancreatic enzymes, anti-liraglutide antibodies and heart rate 
increase with liraglutide are unknown, but current evidence does not suggest negative long term effects.

2.6.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated.  The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, SmPC guideline 
and other relevant guideline(s). 
Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information. 
2.6.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
T2D is a progressive metabolic disease primarily characterised by abnormal glucose metabolism, resulting in 
hyperglycaemia. Uncontrolled hyperglycaemia is associated with adverse long-term consequences such as 
microvascular and macrovascular complications (e.g., retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy and 
cardiovascular disease). The aetiology, pathophysiology and clinical manifestation of T2D in the paediatric 
population are similar to those in adults.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The recommended treatment approach for paediatric T2D is similar to that in adults, namely the 
achievement and maintenance of glycaemic control in order to prevent long-term complications. Given the 
similar pathophysiology and progression of adult and paediatric T2D, the paediatric treatment guidelines 
also recommend a step-wise approach starting with lifestyle modifications followed by pharmacologic 
monotherapy and later by combination therapy. Metformin and insulin are currently the only approved 
pharmacologic treatment options for paediatric subjects with T2D in most countries. However, more than 
half of youth with T2D experience a loss of glycaemic control with metformin alone or when combined with 
lifestyle intervention. Although insulin is highly effective in lowering blood glucose, its acceptance and use by 
paediatric subjects with T2D may be limited by such drawbacks as weight gain, high risk of hypoglycaemia, 
complex titration and need for coordination with meals. Given these considerations, there is a medical need 
to have alternative treatment options for adolescents with type 2 diabetes that optimize diabetes control and 
reduce complications. Efforts to enrich the currently limited therapeutic armamentarium with newer drugs 
for youth with type 2 diabetes are welcomed. 
EMA/447330/2019 
Page 45/52 
 
  
  
  
 
 
The aim of this application was to extend the indication for liraglutide (Victoza) for the treatment of T2D in 
children and adolescents aged 10 years and above.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The pivotal trial 3659 was a multinational, multi-centre, randomised, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial 
with a 26-week double-blind period followed by a 26-week open-label extension in subjects with T2D aged 
10−17 years. The main part of the trial consisted of a 26 week double-blind treatment period and a 26-week 
open-label period. The design of the trial was acceptable and in line with the PIP.  
The subjects’ mean age was 14.6 years, ranging from 10.0 to 16.9 years at baseline; 30% of the subjects 
were 10−14 years old (age at end of treatment) and 62% of the subjects were female. The subjects had had 
diabetes for a mean of 1.9 years. Mean HbA1c was 7.78 % and mean BMI was 33.9 kg/m2 (with a mean 
body weight of 91.5 kg).  
Of the 307 screened subjects, 135 were randomised (1:1); 66 subjects to the liraglutide group and 69 
subjects to placebo group. A higher proportion of subjects in the liraglutide group (90.9%) than in the 
placebo group (84.1%) completed the 26-week double-blind period.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
HbA1c 
Treatment with liraglutide led to a reduction in HbA1c from baseline to week 26 (-0.64%), with this reduction 
being maintained in the open-label period up to week 52 (-0.50%); with placebo, HbA1c increased from 
baseline to weeks 26 (0.42%) and 52 (0.80%). The estimated treatment difference was -1.058 % [-1.653; 
-0.464]95%CI (p=<0.001). In addition, treatment with liraglutide resulted in consistently greater 
proportions of HbA1c <7.0% responders (of all categories) than with placebo, both at weeks 26 and 52, with 
statistically significant odds ratios.  
Glucose 
Treatment with liraglutide led to a reduction from baseline to week 26 in FPG (-1.08 mmol/L), with this 
reduction being maintained in the open-label period up to week 52 (-1.03 mmol/L); with placebo, FPG 
increased from baseline to week 26 (0.80 mmol/L) and week 52 (0.78 mmol/L).The mean plots of the 
7-point SMPG profiles indicated a greater improvement in the liraglutide group than in the placebo group at 
week 26. 
Other end points 
The observed geometric mean daily dose of basal insulin decreased from 23.3 units at baseline to 22.4 units 
at week 26 in the liraglutide group and increased from 23.0 units to 27.1 units in the placebo group.  
There were no relevant changes in blood pressure. There were no significant changes in total cholesterol and 
HDL cholesterol. Greater reductions in VLDL cholesterol and triglycerides were observed with liraglutide than 
with placebo, with statistically significant differences at week 26 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The Applicant performed a trial in paediatric subjects (treated with metformin with or without basal insulin). 
The indication of the SmPC comprises the use of liraglutide as monotherapy when metformin is considered 
inappropriate (due to intolerance or contraindications) and in addition to other medicinal products for the 
EMA/447330/2019 
Page 46/52 
 
  
  
  
 
treatment of diabetes, and refers for study results with respect to combinations, effects on glycaemic control 
and cardiovascular events, and the populations studied, to sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1 of the SmPC.  
The indication as approved in adults was not supported directly in all respects by available paediatric data. 
Liraglutide monotherapy has not been investigated in paediatric subjects, but due to the similarities 
regarding pharmacology, efficacy and adverse events in adolescents and children aged 10 years and above 
treated with liraglutide on top of metformin, extrapolation to this population regarding monotherapy with 
liraglutide when metformin is not tolerated or contraindicated was found to be acceptable by CHMP. With 
regard to combination therapy, it should be noted that liraglutide has not been studied in combination with 
glucose-lowering agents other than metformin ±insulin, but it should be noted that none of these other 
glucose-lowering agents are currently approved for a paediatric population.  
The doses of liraglutide were similar to those used in adults. Given the results from the pharmacokinetic trial 
data, this was acceptable. However, the liraglutide dose of 1.8 mg was not used in several cases due to low 
glucose levels. It is therefore possible that a dose of 1.2 mg liraglutide is sufficient in most of the individuals, 
and that a dose of 1.8 mg liraglutide is only necessary in a minority of the subjects.  
It is uncertain if treatment with liraglutide is associated with reductions in body weight and BMI. During the 
blinded treatment period, treatment with liraglutide did not lead to a significant decrease in BMI SDS 
compared to placebo (placebo adjusted change in BMI SDS -0.047[CI -0.153; 0.060]; p-value 0.392). This 
corresponded to a non-significant change in body weight of -1.3 kg [CI -3.013; 0.377]; p=0.128). After 
deblinding, liraglutide was associated with a significant decrease in BMI SDS of -0.177 [CI -0.327; -0.027]; 
p-value 0.021. This corresponded to a change in body weight of -2.8 kg [CI -5.014; -0.535]; p=0.015). 
With respect to the effect of liraglutide on HbA1c, there were no relevant differences by subgroups age and 
insulin at baseline. However, the number of subjects in the subgroups was low. In addition, efficacy was 
similar in male and female patients.  
A higher proportion of subjects in the youngest age group did not complete the trial, and the difference 
between age groups in the proportion of completers was more pronounced in the liraglutide group than the 
placebo group, which is a limitation to the favourable effects of liraglutide. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In general, the results of Trial 3659 have demonstrated that liraglutide has a safety profile comparable to 
that in adults with T2D.  
Adverse events 
Although the proportions of subjects who experienced AEs were similar in the liraglutide and placebo groups 
(78.8% versus 76.5%, respectively), the rate of AEs was higher in the liraglutide group (9992 versus 7330 
events per 1000 PYE). The difference in the rate of all adverse events in the liraglutide and placebo groups 
appeared primarily to be driven by the higher rates of GI AEs (primarily nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and 
abdominal pain) in the liraglutide group. 
A total of 3 AEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuations were reported (all in the blinded treatment 
period): 1 AE in the liraglutide group and 2 AEs in 1 subject in the placebo group. 
Serious adverse events 
The proportion of subjects with SAEs, as well as the event rate, was higher in the liraglutide group than in the 
placebo group during both the blinded (9.1% vs 4.4%) and the entire treatment periods (13.6% vs 5.9%). 
There was no SAE clustering within SOCs.  
Gastrointestinal adverse events 
EMA/447330/2019 
Page 47/52 
 
  
  
  
The proportion of subjects with AEs within the SOC gastrointestinal disorders, as well as the AE rate, were 
higher in the liraglutide group compared to the placebo group during the entire treatment period: 56.1% and 
2381 events per 1000 PYE versus 36.8% and 896 events per 1000 PYE, respectively (Trial 3659). The 
incidence of all GI AEs was mainly higher in the liraglutide group than in the placebo group during the initial 
8 weeks of treatment and then remained comparable between the treatment groups until the end of the 
entire treatment period. 
Other adverse events  
The proportion of subjects with medical events of special interest was higher in the liraglutide group than in 
the placebo group (during the entire treatment periods 9.1% vs 4.4%).  
Both in the blinded and the entire treatment periods, the proportion of subjects experiencing hypoglycaemic 
episodes and the episode rates, were higher in the liraglutide group than in the placebo group. During the 
blinded period, ADA defined total hypoglycaemia was 34.8% in the liraglutide group vs. 20.6% in the 
placebo group. In addition, during the blinded treatment period, the proportion of subjects experiencing 
documented symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes (ADA defined) was also higher in the liraglutide group 
than in the placebo group (19.7% vs. 8.8%). No severe hypoglycaemic episodes occurred in the liraglutide 
group. The proportion of subjects experiencing hypoglycaemic episodes, as well as the episode rate, were 
higher in the liraglutide group than in the placebo group irrespective of insulin use prior to the 
hypoglycaemic episode.  
There were no clinically relevant changes from baseline or differences between groups in safety laboratory 
parameters (haematology, biochemistry, hormones, urinalysis and bone metabolism), although, small 
increases in geometric mean pancreatic enzyme levels were observed in the liraglutide group.  
At week 53 (after the end of the entire treatment period), anti-liraglutide antibodies were detected in 5 
(8.5%) subjects in the liraglutide group. Given the low antibody levels and the lack of in vitro neutralising 
effect, it is unlikely that antibody development had an impact on the efficacy and safety of liraglutide during 
1 year of treatment. HbA1c response patterns were similar in the subjects who developed antibodies and in 
those who did not.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety profile in paediatric subjects was largely comparable to that in adults with T2D. However, a 
randomised treatment period of 26 weeks is relatively short for a medicine that is intended to be used for 
many decades.  
The clinical significance of pancreatic enzyme elevations with liraglutide is unknown. Long term effects of 
liraglutide on the developing pancreas are unknown. As seen in adult patients, anti-liraglutide antibodies 
were observed in 8.5% of subjects. While this might not have an effect on efficacy, anti-liraglutide 
antibodies could be still a concern in children. As seen in adult patients, an increase in heart rate was 
observed. As higher heart rate is known to be associated with worse cardiovascular outcome, the higher 
heart rate observed in this high risk population might be still of relevance.  
In contrast to adults, the proportion of subjects experiencing hypoglycaemic episodes was higher in the 
liraglutide group than in the placebo group, irrespective of insulin use prior to the hypoglycaemic episode. 
This is different from the findings with liraglutide in adults. In adults, liraglutide was associated with 
hypoglycaemia in individuals in combination with insulin (or SU), but is was not associated with 
hypoglycaemia without use of insulin (or SU).  
A higher proportion of subjects in the liraglutide group did not increase dose to the maximal dose of 1.8 mg. 
The frequency of adverse events by liraglutide dose is therefore unknown.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The Applicant proposed an extension of indication to include treatment of children and adolescents (age 
10-17 years) with T2D. The subjects’ mean age was 14.6 years and mean BMI was 33.9 kg/m2, suggesting 
that most of these young patients have severe obesity. Metformin and insulin are currently the only 
approved pharmacologic treatment options for paediatric subjects with T2D. However, more than half of 
youth with T2D experience a loss of glycaemic control with metformin alone. Although insulin is highly 
effective in lowering blood glucose, its acceptance and use by paediatric subjects with T2D may be limited. 
There is an unmet medical need for these very obese patients when metformin (with or without insulin) does 
not provide adequate glycaemic control.  
Although liraglutide has not been studied in monotherapy in children, extrapolation from adult studies was 
found to be acceptable by CHMP.  With regard to combination therapy, it should be noted that liraglutide has 
not been studied in combination with glucose-lowering agents other than metformin ±insulin, but none of 
these other glucose-lowering agents are currently approved for a paediatric population with T2D. This was 
therefore considered to be adequate by CHMP. In the text of the indication, reference is made to section 5.1 
of the SmPC with regard to the combinations and populations studied in trials, where it is stated that 
liraglutide in paediatric subjects was only investigated in combination with metformin ± insulin. Accordingly, 
EMA/447330/2019 
Page 49/52 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
the posology in section 4.2 of the SmPC specifically reflects that the combination therapy with a sulfonylurea 
or thiazolidinediones are only valid in adult patients. 
In these paediatric subjects (treated with metformin with or without basal insulin), six months of treatment 
with the maximum tolerated dose of liraglutide (0.6, 1.2 or 1.8 mg) was associated with a decrease in HbA1c 
compared to placebo (-1.1 %). After deblinding, the treatment effect of liraglutide on HbA1c was sustained 
up to one year. This effect is clinically relevant and in line with findings in adults.  
Compared to placebo, only small reductions in BMI SDS were seen with liraglutide at 6 months, 
corresponding to a treatment difference of -1.3 kg in body weight. This difference was not statistically 
significant, hence superiority of liraglutide over placebo was not confirmed. This may be due to the small 
number of subjects. The point estimate is in line with effects of liraglutide 1.2 and 1.8 mg in the larger adult 
study LEAD-2 (trial 1572). In addition, in the paediatric study, approximately 30% of the patients were using 
only the lowest dose of liraglutide (0.6 mg).  
There was an increased risk of both asymptomatic and documented symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes 
with liraglutide. In contrast to adults, the proportion of subjects experiencing hypoglycaemic episodes was 
higher in the liraglutide group than in the placebo group, irrespective of insulin use prior to the episode. This 
risk is now described in the SmPC.  
It is uncertain whether a dose of 1.8 mg is necessary in the majority of the children, as based on the 
dose-response analysis, limited additional benefit in terms of HbA1c decrease was observed between 
liraglutide doses of 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg. Furthermore, a part of the population did not reach the highest dose 
due to reaching acceptable glucose values with a lower dose or adverse events.  
A double-blind randomised treatment period of 26 weeks is relatively short for a medicine that is intended to 
be used for many decades. Long-term effects in children may be different from adults due to the fact that 
their organs are still in a developmental state. Although long-term safety in children is unknown, current 
evidence does not suggest negative long term effects.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Positive effects on HbA1c are in line with what could be expected from data in adults and the adverse events 
appeared to be acceptable. Weight loss after 26 weeks was not statistically significant, but this may be due 
to the smaller number of subjects in the paediatric study. The point estimate is in line with effects of 
liraglutide in adult studies.  There was an increased risk of hypoglycaemia irrespective of insulin use prior to 
the hypoglycaemic episode. This risk is described in the SmPC. The benefit/risk balance is considered 
positive in these subjects. Furthermore, the benefit /risk is considered positive for monotherapy, as it is 
accepted that the results from adults with regards to liraglutide monotherapy can be extrapolated to 
children. As the only approved glucose-lowering agents for paediatric use currently are metformin and 
insulin, the posology in section 4.2 regarding combination therapy reflects that the combination therapy with 
a sulfonylurea or thiazalidinediones are only valid in adult patients. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of liraglutide (Victoza) for the extension of indication to adolescents and children aged 10 
years and above is positive.

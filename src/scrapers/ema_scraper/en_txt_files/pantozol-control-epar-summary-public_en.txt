EPAR summary for the public 
Pantozol Control 
pantoprazole 
This is a summary of the European public assessment report (EPAR) for Pantozol Control. It explains 
how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the medicine to reach its 
opinion in favour of granting a marketing authorisation and its recommendations on the conditions of 
use for Pantozol Control. 
What is Pantozol Control? 
Pantozol Control is a medicine that contains the active substance pantoprazole. It is available as 
gastroresistant tablets (20 mg). ‘Gastroresistant’ means that the tablet’s contents pass through the 
stomach without being broken down until they reach the intestine. This prevents the active substance 
from being destroyed by the acid in the stomach. 
Pantozol Control is similar to a ‘reference medicine’ already authorised in the European Union (EU) 
called Pantozol. 
What is Pantozol Control used for? 
Pantozol Control is used for the short-term treatment of the symptoms of acid reflux in adults. Acid 
reflux is when acid produced in the stomach escapes into the gullet, causing heartburn and acid 
regurgitation (acid flowing up into the mouth). 
The medicine can be obtained without a prescription. 
How is Pantozol Control used? 
The recommended dose of Pantozol Control is one tablet once a day until symptoms have stopped. The 
patient may need to take the medicine for two to three days in a row for symptoms to improve. If 
there is no improvement in symptoms within two weeks of continuous treatment, patients should

consult their doctor. Patients should not take the medicine for longer than four weeks without 
consulting their doctor. 
The tablets should be swallowed whole with liquid before a meal and should not be chewed or crushed.  
How does Pantozol Control work? 
The active substance in Pantozol Control, pantoprazole, is a proton pump inhibitor. It works by 
blocking ‘proton pumps’, proteins found in specialised cells in the stomach lining that pump acid into 
the stomach. By blocking the pumps, pantoprazole reduces acid production, relieving the symptoms of 
acid reflux. 
Pantoprazole-containing medicines have been available in the European Union (EU) since 1994. The 
reference medicine, Pantozol, is only available with a prescription. It is used for long-term treatments 
and is also used to treat a wider range of gastrointestinal diseases (conditions affecting the gut) than 
Pantozol Control. 
How has Pantozol Control been studied? 
Because pantoprazole has been in use for many years, the applicant presented data from the scientific 
literature. The applicant also presented information from two main studies looking at the effects of 
pantoprazole 20 mg in a total of 563 adults who had symptoms of acid reflux, including at least one 
episode of heartburn in the three days before the studies began. The first study compared 
pantoprazole with placebo (a dummy treatment) in 219 adults, and the second compared it with 
ranitidine (another medicine used to treat acid reflux symptoms) in 344 adults. The main measure of 
effectiveness was the number of patients with symptoms of heartburn over the first two weeks of 
treatment. 
What benefit has Pantozol Control shown during the studies? 
Pantoprazole was more effective than placebo and ranitidine at improving the symptoms of acid reflux. 
In the first study, 74% of the patients taking pantoprazole (80 out of 108) and 43% of those taking 
placebo (48 out of 111) had no heartburn after two weeks. Pantoprazole was also more effective than 
placebo at reducing symptoms of acid regurgitation. In the second study, 70% of the patients taking 
pantoprazole (121 out of 172) and 59% of those talking ranitidine (102 out of 172) had no heartburn 
after two weeks of treatment. 
What is the risk associated with Pantozol Control? 
The most common side effects with Pantozol Control (seen in around 1 patient in 100) are diarrhoea 
and headache. For the full list of all side effects reported with pantoprazole, see the package leaflet. 
Pantozol Control must not be used in people who are hypersensitive (allergic) to pantoprazole, soya or 
any of the other ingredients. It must not be used with atazanavir (a medicine used to treat human 
immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection). 
Why has Pantozol Control been approved? 
The CHMP noted that pantoprazole 20 mg was effective in the short-term treatment of reflux 
symptoms and that there is a long safety experience with the medicine as a prescription medicine. It 
was also of the opinion that, based on the experience of the use of pantoprazole, the availability of

Pantozol Control without medical supervision is appropriate. The CHMP therefore decided that Pantozol 
Control’s benefits are greater than its risks and recommended that it be given marketing authorisation. 
Other information about Pantozol Control 
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the EU for Pantozol 
Control on 12 June 2009.

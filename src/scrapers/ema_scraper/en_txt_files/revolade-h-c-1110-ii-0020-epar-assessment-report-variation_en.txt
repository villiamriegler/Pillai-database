2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Severe aplastic anaemia (SAA) is a rare, life-threatening, acquired bone marrow failure disease 
characterized by tri-lineage marrow hypoplasia and a lack of haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells 
(HSPC) due to an immune-mediated attack on the bone marrow. Its diagnosis is of exclusion, 
exhibiting hypocellular bone marrow (<25%) and pancytopenia (with at least 2 of the following: 
absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <0.5 Gi/L; platelet counts <20 Gi/L; reticulocytes <20 Gi/L). Aplastic 
anaemia affects approximately 2 out of every 1 million people in Western countries. Historically, SAA 
was an almost uniformly fatal diagnosis due to infection or haemorrhage resulting from prolonged 
pancytopenia. Outcomes in patients with SAA have improved dramatically due to definitive treatment 
with either intensive immunosuppressive therapy (IST) with anti-thymocyte globulin and cyclosporine 
(ATG/CsA), or haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Observed haematologic responses 
with these treatments led to substantial improvements of survival rates for patients with SAA. 
No therapies are currently approved for the treatment of SAA patients in the European Union, but the 
standard treatment regimen for treatment-naïve SAA is ATG/CsA. Since the establishment of IST as a 
standard treatment for SAA, no subsequent improvements in treatment have been identified. 
Intensification of primary IST for treatment-naïve cases with agents more immunosuppressive than 
hATG, including rabbit ATG, alemtuzumab, or high dose cyclophosphamide, have not been successful. 
Addition of sirolimus or mycophenolate to hATG/CsA has not improved response rates. 
No established standard of care exists for SAA patients with an insufficient response to IST who lack a 
matched related donor for HSCT, other than transfusion support and treatment of infections. 
Alternative donor transplantation (matched unrelated donors) can be effective in selected patients with 
SAA, but there are issues of donor availability, cost, and treatment-related mortality and morbidity. To 
date, outcomes following umbilical cord transplant have been dismal in patients with bone marrow 
failure syndromes. Cord and haploidentical transplants are not recommended outside of clinical trials. 
A second course of IST salvages in some SAA patients who were unresponsive to initial IST could 
induce haematologic responses in approximately 21% to 37% of patients. A third course of IST has 
been shown to be ineffective in patients unresponsive to previous IST. 
Growth factors such as erythropoietin and granulocyte colony stimulating factor have not been shown 
to improve response rates. Androgens have not demonstrated efficacy in combination with IST, but a 
small proportion of IST-refractory patients may respond to androgens based on anecdotal evidence. 
Despite significant improvements in standard supportive care treatments (particularly antifungal 
antimicrobials and other antibiotics), approximately 40% of IST-refractory SAA patients die of bleeding 
or infection within 5 years of diagnosis. Consequently, such patients have a high unmet medical need, 
and outcomes remain unsatisfactory. New treatment options are needed for patients with an 
insufficient response to IST. 
Eltrombopag  is  a  novel,  small  molecule,  non-peptide,  orally  active  thrombopoietin  receptor  (TPO-R) 
agonist  that  functions  in  a  similar  manner  to  endogenous  thrombopoietin  (TPO),  the  main  cytokine 
involved in regulation of megakaryopoiesis and platelet production. 
REVOLADE contains eltrombopag as eltrombopag olamine, the bismonoethanolamine salt of the free 
acid eltrombopag; and is presented as 25, 50, or 75 mg tablet, indicated for:

who are refractory to other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins).  
second line treatment for adult non-splenectomised patients where surgery is contraindicated.  
adult patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection for the treatment of 
thrombocytopenia, where the degree of thrombocytopenia is the main factor preventing the 
initiation or limiting the ability to maintain optimal interferon-based therapy. 
This MAH applied for the following new indication: 
“REVOLADE  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  severe  aplastic  anaemia  (SAA)  who 
have had an insufficient response to immunosuppressive therapy”.  
Following the review, the indication agreed with the CHMP was: 
“Revolade is indicated in adult patients with acquired severe aplastic anaemia (SAA) who were either 
refractory to prior immunosuppressive therapy or heavily pretreated and are unsuitable for 
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. (See Section 5.1)” 
The recommended starting dose of eltrombopag is 50 mg once daily, to be adjusted in 50 mg 
increments every 2 weeks as necessary to achieve the target platelet count ≥ 50,000/µl. A dose of 150 
mg daily should not be exceeded (see SmPC section 4.2). For patients of East Asian ancestry, 
eltrombopag should be initiated at a reduced dose of 25 mg once daily. The treatment should not be 
initiated when the patients have existing cytogenetic abnormalities of chromosome 7 (see SmPC 
section 4.2). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The original ERA for eltrombopag identified a measured partition coefficient (noctanol/ water) for this 
molecule, at pH 7, of greater than 4.5. On the basis of this observation and as a part of the approval, 
the MAH agreed to undertake, as a follow-up measure, a staged Persistent Bio-accumulative Toxicity 
(PBT) assessment of eltrombopag in a stepwise manner in accordance with EU guidelines (FUM001). 
Accordingly, a bioconcentration study: Flow-through fish test (OECD 305) was performed and an 
updated version of the original ERA on the impact of eltrombopag tablets on the environment was 
submitted. 
Further PBT assessment with eltrombopag, was submitted in the context of a Type II variation to 
introduce the HCV indication in November 2011. The post-authorization commitments of the HCV 
submission included the conduct of Phase II Tier A Aquatic studies [Aerobic Transformation in Aquatic 
Sediments system (OECD 308), Daphnia sp. reproduction test (OECD 211), and Fish, early life stage 
toxicity test (OECD 210)] in addition to the following Phase II Tier B terrestrial fate and effect studies: 
•  Aerobic Transformation in Soil (OECD 307) 
•  Soil Microorganisms, Nitrogen Transformation Test (OECD 216) 
• 
• 
•  Collembola Reproduction (ISO 11267) 
Earthworm, Acute Toxicity Test (OECD 207) 
Terrestrial Plants, Growth Test (OECD 208)

•  Sediment – Water Chironomid (OECD 218/219) 
In this submission, eltrombopag was initially investigated for determination of activated sludge 
sorption isotherm, however, no determination of the isotherm was possible in this study. This was due 
to the instability of the test material in aqueous solution at a concentration and pH relevant to the fate 
of the test material in the waste water treatment plant. At the time it was not possible to overcome 
these technical challenges and therefore it was concluded that the physico-chemical characteristics of 
eltrombopag that contributed to the failure of this study suggested a theoretical Koc value for 
eltrombopag of greater than 10,000 L/kg thereby triggering the need for a Phase II Tier B analysis in 
soil. Furthermore, a QSAR (PCKOC) evaluation of eltrombopag predicts that Koc will be significantly 
greater than 10,000 (Log Koc = 5.66).  
Moreover, animal studies used to investigate the absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination 
of eltrombopag, (as part of the original MAA) reveal that it is predominantly excreted in faeces which 
suggests that adsorption to organic material is a characteristic of this substance. However, despite 
these considerations, the MAH has re-conducted an adsorption - desorption study using the batch 
equilibrium method (OECD 106) in the context of MEA 00X; the results of this study and its 
implications, will be provided as part of an updated ERA (across indications).  
In conclusion, the remaining components of the eltrombopag tablets product, including packaging, are 
already introduced into the environment from a variety of sources in much greater quantity. Therefore, 
introducing these components into the environment as a result of the use of this product is not 
expected to result in adverse environmental effects. 
The measured octanol/water partition coefficient for eltrombopag is greater than 4.5, at pH7 
(measured partition coefficient of 4.52 at pH7). On the basis of this observation a staged Persistent 
Bio-accumulative Toxicity (PBT) assessment of eltrombopag was initiated in a stepwise manner in 
accordance with EU guidelines and a bioconcentration: flow-through study in fish (OECD 305) has, 
therefore, been conducted. 
Eltrombopag olamine was shown not to significantly accumulate in fish tissue at test concentrations 
between 7 and 71 times the predicted “worst case” PEC for eltrombopag (0.35 µg/L). In this study, at 
the end of the 10 day depuration period, 88% and 85% of eltrombopag olamine was eliminated from 
the fish tissues at each concentration, respectively. Based on this information the biological half-life for 
eltrombopag is considered to be between 3 and 10 days. Thus, although, on the basis of the results 
from this study it can be concluded that, on the basis of P (Persistence) criteria, eltrombopag is 
persistent, it does not fulfil the criteria for bioaccumulation as defined in the EU Testing Guidelines and 
therefore it can be concluded that eltrombopag does not fulfil the criteria to be considered a PBT/vPvB 
(i.e. Persistent/Bioaccumulative/Toxic or very Persistent/very Bioaccumulative) substance as set out in 
the guidance. 
According to current guidance, the fate of the drug substance, eltrombopag requires further 
consideration. Following use of eltrombopag tablets, all components derived from the drug substance 
will be released into waste water systems.  An updated assessment should contain calculations of the 
PECSURFACEWATER as the sum all of each indication for eltrombopag and will evaluate the predicted 
environmental exposure in the light of the observed no effect concentrations defined in the new 
studies. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for further investigation:

studies.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No clinical pharmacology/pharmacokinetic data in the severe aplastic anaemia population were 
submitted with this application. 
Results from clinical pharmacology studies were provided in the original MAA to support eltrombopag 
use in adult patients with chronic idiopathic thrombocytopaenic purpura. No additional clinical 
pharmacology studies were completed for this application, with the exception of the following 
information from the supportive study ELT116643.  
Preliminary pharmacokinetic (PK) results from Cohort 1 of supportive Study ELT116643 have become 
available. In Cohort 1 of Study ELT116643, a PK sample for plasma concentrations of eltrombopag was 
taken from 23 subjects at the 3 month visit; PK is not being performed in Cohort 2 of the study. 
Thirteen (57%) subjects were female, 2 (9%) were elderly, and 3 (13%) were adolescents. Steady 
state eltrombopag geometric mean PK parameters for the 150 mg daily dose in these 23 subjects were 
Cmax 35.0 µg/mL (50%) and AUC(0-∞) 693.7 µg.h/mL (43%).  
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new PD data in the severe aplastic anaemia population were included in the submission. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
No new relevant studies have been submitted with this application but some information is derived 
from a supportive study Study ELT116643 which evaluates the efficacy of eltrombopag in combination 
with a common immunosuppressive regimen for the treatment of naïve SAA subjects (ATG/CsA). 
The observed eltrombopag exposure in these 23 SAA subjects was 2 to 3 times higher than that 
observed in healthy subjects or patients with chronic ITP. The higher eltrombopag exposure may be 
due to a possible drug-drug interaction between eltrombopag and CsA. Published studies have shown 
CsA inhibits drug transporters such as organic anion transporting polypeptide and breast cancer 
resistance protein (BCRP), thereby potentially impacting plasma levels of substrates of these 
transporters and eltrombopag is a substrate of BCRP (Gupta, 2006). The MAH is planning to conduct a 
drug-drug interaction study in healthy volunteers to further evaluate the potential for a PK drug 
interaction between CsA and eltrombopag, however, as concomitant use of eltrombopag with CsA is 
not expected in refractory SAA, such DDI study is not required under the scope of this extension of 
indication.  
Current PK/PD information is considered sufficient to support the new indication. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Current knowledge of the clinical pharmacology of eltrombopag can be applied in the SAA population.

ECOG Performance Status of 3 or greater 
Treatment with horse or rabbit ATG or Campath within 6 months of study entry. Concurrent 
stable treatment with cyclosporine or G-CSF is permitted. 
Treatments 
The starting dose of eltrombopag was 50 mg daily (25 mg for East Asian subjects), and the dose was 
increased by 25 mg daily every 2 weeks based on platelet counts to a maximum of 150 mg daily (75 
mg for East Asian subjects). The dose of eltrombopag during extended access was at the lowest 
dosage that maintained a stable platelet count until subjects met off-study criteria, or the study was 
closed. Subjects who could not tolerate study medication or did not respond by the Primary Response 
Assessment were discontinued from eltrombopag.  
For subjects who entered the extension, eltrombopag was tapered in subjects who achieved tri-lineage 
haematopoiesis (defined as platelets >50 Gi/L, haemoglobin [Hgb] >10 g/dL in the absence of RBC 
transfusions, and ANC >1 Gi/L for more than 8 weeks). The dose of eltrombopag was decreased to 75 
mg/day for non-East Asians; or to 25 mg/day for East Asians. After 8 weeks at this dose if platelet, 
haemoglobin and neutrophil counts remained above these thresholds, treatment with eltrombopag was 
stopped. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to assess the safety and efficacy of the oral thrombopoietin receptor agonist 
(TPO-R) eltrombopag in SAA subjects with immunosuppressive therapy refractory thrombocytopenia. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was investigator-assessed haematologic response at the Primary 
Response Assessment (week 12 or 16 visit). Haematologic response was defined as meeting 1 or more 
of the following criteria: 
• 
Platelet count increase to 20 Gi/L above baseline, or stable platelet counts with transfusion 
independence for a minimum of 8 weeks;  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/598426/2015  
Page 11/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Haemoglobin increase by >1.5 g/dL for subjects with pre-treatment haemoglobin <9 g/dL, or a 
reduction in the units of RBC transfusions by at least 4 for 8 consecutive weeks, compared with 
the 8 weeks pre-treatment;  
•  ANC increase of 100% (for pre-treatment levels <0.5 Gi/L), or an ANC increase >0.5 Gi/L.  
Subjects with evidence of response at 12 weeks could continue eltrombopag for an additional 4 weeks 
to ensure response prior to being consented for entry into the extended access part of the study. 
Responding subjects were eligible to enter an extended treatment portion of the trial.  
Assessment of response in patients with SAA relies on haematologic improvements in blood counts. 
Patients who no longer meet the criteria for SAA, or who become red cell or platelet transfusion 
independent, have achieved a clinically meaningful response to treatment.   
Other efficacy assessments evaluated in ELT112523 included: 
•  Best lineage response (i.e., uni-lineage, bi-lineage or tri-lineage) was determined to assess 
whether response to eltrombopag improved over time after continued treatment; 
•  Response at each subject’s last assessment (as of the data cut-off date) was examined to 
assess maintenance of effect over time during the extension; 
•  Duration of response and maintenance of response after discontinuation of eltrombopag were 
assessed to evaluate durability of response; 
• 
Transfusion independence for both platelets and RBC was assessed by shift from baseline 
transfusion dependence to independence, and the maximum duration of transfusion 
independence (via summary statistics); 
•  Bone marrow cellularity and haematopoiesis were evaluated to assess reconstitution of the 
bone marrow; and  
•  Health-related quality of life was measured at baseline and 12 to 16 weeks after baseline. 
All subjects were to be evaluated at the NIH at baseline, weeks 5, 9 and 13 (labelled 12 week 
assessment in the reporting analysis plan). Responding patients who entered the extension were 
monitored at the NIH every 3 months. After discontinuation, subjects completed FU visits at week 4 
and 6 months.  
Sample size 
In the original Protocol, the Two-Stage Minimax Design with a response probability of 10% or less to 
terminate the treatment and the hypothesized actual response probability of 30% or more. The sample 
size is determined by testing the null hypothesis H0: p≤10% versus the alternative H1: p ≥30% at a 
significance level of 0.05 and a power of 0.8. At the first stage, 15 subjects will be accrued and the null 
hypothesis will be accepted if no more than 1 subject responds to the treatment within 3 months. If 2 
or more subjects respond to the treatment within 3 months at the first stage, then an additional 10 
subjects will be accrued, bringing the total number of subjects to n=25. The null hypothesis of p≤10% 
will be accepted if the total number of responders within 3 months is 5 or less. By 2 subsequent 
protocol amendments the sample size was increased to 50 patients (Cohort 1). 
Randomisation 
The study was non-randomised. 
Assessment report

Blinding (masking) 
The study was open label. 
Statistical methods 
Study ELT112523 was originally designed as a two-stage study with a maximum of 25 subjects to test 
the null hypothesis that the response rate with this treatment was no greater than 10%. The null 
hypothesis of p≤10% was to be rejected if the total number of responders out of 25 subjects within 12 
weeks was 6 or more: 11 subjects were determined to have responded, so that the objective of the 
design was met and the null hypothesis rejected for this part of the study.  
The primary population for all analyses was comprised of all subjects enrolled into the study who 
received at least 1 dose of study treatment. The probability of a haematologic response is summarized 
in the ELT112523 clinical study report (CSR) using point estimates and 95% Klopper-Pearson 
confidence intervals. The analyses were not adjusted for the original 2-stage design or subsequent 
increase in sample size. Subjects could respond according to 1 or more of 3 criteria: platelets (platelet 
counts and/or platelet transfusions), red cells (Hgb level and/or RBC transfusions), and ANC.  
For subjects who discontinue the study drug prematurely (before 3 months), Platelet count 
measurement will be attempted even if a subject discontinues study drug. Subjects who withdraw from 
the study for reasons other than lack of efficacy or toxicity (rendering platelet count missing) may be 
replaced. All other subjects should be evaluable for efficacy. Based on the assumed drop-out rate of 
15-20% and the goal of having 25 evaluable subjects, 5 additional subjects may be enrolled.

The study was designed to allow continued eltrombopag treatment in responding subjects and 
discontinuation of eltrombopag in non-responding subjects. Subjects with no response to eltrombopag 
treatment by the Primary Response Assessment were to discontinue treatment. Responders were 
allowed to enter an extended treatment portion of the study where they were allowed to taper off 
eltrombopag based upon tri-lineage peripheral blood counts above pre-defined thresholds (defined as 
platelets >50 Gi/L, Hgb >10 g/dL in the absence of RBC transfusion, and ANC >1 Gi/L for more than 8 
weeks).  
Of the 26 subjects who did not meet response criteria, 22 discontinued treatment as per protocol (i.e., 
‘completed scheduled treatment period’). The remaining 4 non responding subjects discontinued 
treatment at or prior to the Primary Response Assessment due to ‘lost to follow-up’ (1 subject), 
‘withdrew consent’ (1 subject) and due to an adverse event (AE; 2 subjects). 
Of the 17 subjects with a response, 3 subjects did not enter the extended treatment phase either due 
to an AE (2 subjects) or due to investigator discretion (1 subject). Of the remaining 14 subjects who 
entered the extension phase, 4 subjects remain ongoing in treatment, 5 subjects met protocol defined

criteria for tri-lineage haematopoiesis and tapered off eltrombopag, and 5 subjects discontinued 
treatment during the extension due to either an AE (1 subject), detection of a cytogenetic abnormality 
(2 subjects) or lack of efficacy (2 subjects). 
Subjects were discontinued from treatment with eltrombopag if no response was observed after 16 
weeks. Subjects were discontinued from treatment with eltrombopag if no haematologic response has 
been observed after 16 weeks or upon detection of new cytogenetic abnormalities. 
Recruitment 
As of the clinical cut-off date of 09 May 2014, 44 subjects had been enrolled in the study. 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol was planned to enrol and treat 25 subjects (Cohort 1).  
The protocol was amended 20 April 2012 to increase enrolment from 25 to a maximum of 45 subjects, 
and to allow subjects with tri-lineage haematopoiesis to taper off eltrombopag.  
The protocol was amended 05 February 2013 to increase enrolment to a maximum of 50 subjects, and 
to allow subjects with tri-lineage haematopoiesis to taper off eltrombopag. Subjects enrolled under 
these amendments are referred to as Cohort 2.  
The pivotal study did not reach the target enrolment of 50 subjects because the NIH decided to stop 
enrolling in the ELT112523 study when their second refractory study (ELT116826), opened. The NIH’s 
rationale for this decision was that the pivotal study had a long period of escalation to the effective 
dose of 150 mg and a short duration of treatment at the effective dose prior to response assessment. 
The NIH considered the dosing and administration of eltrombopag in ELT116826 (starting dose of 150 
mg and 6 month duration of treatment) likely to be more effective than the dosing and administration 
of eltrombopag in ELT112523. Therefore, once ELT116826 was opened the NIH closed enrolment in 
the pivotal study. 
Baseline data 
All  subjects  enrolled  in  the  study  were  platelet  transfusion  dependent,  or  had  untransfused  platelet 
counts  ≤30  Gi/L  at  baseline.  The  majority  of  subjects  had  bi-lineage  or  tri-lineage  cytopenias  at 
baseline  and  were  both  platelet  and  RBC  transfusion  dependent.  All  subjects  had  an  insufficient 
response to prior intensive immunosuppressive therapy (including hATG, rabbit ATG, alemtuzumab and 
cyclophosphamide).  
The median age was 45 years and the majority of subjects were between the ages of 18 and 64 years 
(63%)  (Table  3).  Two  subjects  were  17  years  old  at  entry  into  the  study.  No  subjects  were  over  85 
years of age. A majority of subjects were male (56%) and the most common race was White (47%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/598426/2015  
Page 15/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The median time since diagnosis of SAA until screening was 31 months (range: 10-190 months) (Table 
4). All subjects met criteria for diagnosis of SAA and the baseline median values for ANC, platelets, 
haemoglobin and reticulocytes were indicative of the pancytopenic SAA patient population (Table 4) 
despite inclusion of laboratory values from patients recently transfused. At baseline, 91% of subjects 
were platelet transfusion-dependent and 86% were RBC transfusion-dependent. Subjects received a 
median of 4 platelet transfusions and 4 RBC transfusions in the 4 weeks prior to entry into the study.  
The majority of subjects, 33 (77%), were considered to have ‘primary refractory disease’, defined as 
having no prior adequate response to IST in any lineage. The remaining 10 subjects had insufficient 
platelet response to prior therapies. All 10 had received at least 2 prior IST regimens and 50% had 
received at least 3 prior IST regimens. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/598426/2015  
Page 16/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
All patients enrolled in the study received at least 1 prior ATG based intensive immunosuppressive 
therapy; either horse (95%) or rabbit ATG (58%) were the most common (Table 5). Other ISTs 
received by subjects in this study were alemtuzumab and cyclophosphamide. In addition, 93% of 
subjects received other medications for the treatment of their SAA. Androgens were administered as 
prior treatment to 37% of subjects. The remaining other medications previously received for SAA 
included non-intensive immunosuppressive agents (cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, rituximab, 
daciluzumab, steroids, immunoglobulins), supportive care agents (GM-CSF, Neupogen, Procrit and 
Nplate) and methotrexate. 
Subjects were heavily pretreated, with 84% having received at least 2 prior ISTs and more than 30% 
of subjects having received at least 3 prior immunosuppressive regimens (Table 6). 
Numbers analysed 
Of the 43 subjects who received eltrombopag, 40 (93%) were escalated to the maximum dose of 
eltrombopag 150 mg. Three subjects who did not receive the maximum dose of 150 mg received a 
maximum dose of 125 mg. All 3 subjects had AEs leading to treatment discontinuation or dose 
modifications. Given the design of the study, in which subjects who did not meet response criteria 
were discontinued from treatment after 3 months, the median time on treatment was 3.6 months. 
Nine subjects received eltrombopag for more than 12 months, with a maximum duration of 39 months.

Haematologic response was achieved in 17 subjects (40%) in at least 1 lineage (95% CI: 25-56%). 
One subject had a tri-lineage response, 3 subjects had bi-lineage responses, and the remaining 13 had 
a uni-lineage response. The majority of responders (65%) met platelet response criteria, followed by 
ANC and haemoglobin response criteria (47% and 18%, respectively) (Table 9).  
The prior treatment history of responders was similar to the overall population in the study with 84% 
having received at least 2 IST prior to entry into the study. Baseline disease characteristics were 
similar between responders and non-responders.  In summary, treatment with eltrombopag produced 
a 40% response rate in the heavily pretreated patient population, where no established standard of 
care exists. 
Responders were allowed to continue eltrombopag in the extended treatment portion of the study. 
Fourteen of the 17 responders entered into the extension phase. As of the clinical cut-off date, 10 
responders (65%) were ongoing in the study and continued to maintain a response. 
Secondary endpoints  
Best Response: Best response during the study (defined as the best lineage response, i.e., uni-lineage, 
bi-lineage or tri-lineage, observed during the assessment phase) was determined to assess whether 
response to eltrombopag improved over time after continued treatment. 
Of the 14 subjects who entered the extension phase of the trial, 7 subjects had improvements in more 
than 1 lineage following continuation of treatment in the extension: 
•  5 subjects with uni-lineage response improved to multi-lineage response (bi-lineage or 
tri-lineage). 
•  2 subjects with bi-lineage response improved to tri-lineage response  
At the time of their best response, a total of 5 subjects had tri-lineage responses and 4 additional 
subjects had bi-lineage response. Three of the 4 bi-lineage responders also had improvements in 
haemoglobin >1.5 g/dL; however, as their baseline haemoglobin was above 9 g/dL they are not 
counted as having an erythroid response. The remaining 8 subjects had a uni-lineage best response. 
Last Response 
Response at each subject’s last assessment (Last Response) was examined to assess maintenance of 
effect over time during continued treatment. For 14 of 17 subjects, including all 9 tri-lineage and bi-
lineage responders, the last response assessed was the same as the best response. The remaining 3 
subjects relapsed at the Month 3 Extension visit.  
Duration of Response 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/598426/2015  
Page 18/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Duration of response was assessed for subjects who met the haematologic response criteria at the 
Primary Response Assessment and had at least 2 response assessments. Of the 17 subjects who 
responded, 2 subjects did not have at least 2 response assessments and were not evaluable for 
response duration.  Fifteen responders evaluable for assessment of response duration had a median 
duration of investigator-assessed response of 12.0 month. 
Ten of the 15 responders were ongoing in the extension portion of the study and therefore their 
duration of response was censored at the last response assessment. At the last response assessment, 
the median duration of response for these subjects was 32.9 months (range: 11.0 to 54.8 months). 
The remaining 5 subjects stopped treatment in the extension and are no longer being  followed for 
efficacy (1 subject due to an AE, 1 subject due to a cytogenetic change and 3 subjects due to relapse). 
Transfusion Independence 
Baseline platelet and RBC transfusion dependence was defined as the subject receiving at least 1 
transfusion in the month prior to the first dose of eltrombopag. Post-baseline transfusion independence 
was achieved if subjects who were transfusion dependent at baseline became transfusion free for a 
period of at least 28 (platelets) and 56 days (RBCs). The time period for assessment of transfusion 
independence was anytime during the treatment period and during 4 weeks of the follow-up or the last 
visit, whichever occurred first.  
Platelet Transfusion Independence: Of the 39 subjects who were platelet transfusion dependent at 
baseline, 59% (23 subjects) became platelet transfusion independent during the study. The 4 subjects 
who were platelet transfusion independent at baseline remained platelet transfusion independent 
during the study. The longest platelet transfusion free period for the entire treated population was 33 
days (median). The longest platelet transfusion free period for non-responders was similar (median of 
27 days). The longest platelet transfusion free period for responders was 287 days (median). All 
responders had received at least 1 platelet transfusion in the month prior to study entry, with the 
exception of 2 subjects. 
RBC Transfusion Independence: Of the 37 subjects who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline, 
27% (10 subjects) became RBC transfusion independent during the study. Of the 43 subjects treated 
in the study, 6 subjects (4 responders, 2 non-responders) were RBC transfusions independent at 
baseline. All 6 subjects remained RBC transfusion independent during the study. Thirty-seven of the 43 
subjects in the study received at least 1 RBC transfusion in the month prior to study entry. The longest 
RBC transfusion free period for the entire study population was 32 days (median). The longest RBC 
transfusion free period for non-responders was similar (median of 29 days). The longest RBC 
transfusion free period for responders was 266 days (median). All responders had received at least 1 
RBC transfusion in the month prior to study entry, with the exception of 4 subjects. Seven of the 17 
responding subjects met haemoglobin and/or RBC transfusion independence criteria for response. 
Maintenance of Response after Discontinuation of Eltrombopag 
As of the clinical cut-off date, 7 subjects that discontinued eltrombopag had maintained a response. 
Reconstitution of Haematopoiesis 
Bone marrow examinations were performed during screening, at the Primary Response Assessment 
and every 6 months thereafter. Restoration of bone marrow cellularity and tri-lineage haematopoiesis 
was shown in a proportion of responders.  
Health Outcomes  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/598426/2015  
Page 19/58 
 
 
 
 
 
Health outcome measures were summarized and analyzed as specified by the developers of the 
Medical Outcomes Trust for the Short Form-36 item (SF-36) V2 instrument. Descriptive health 
outcomes results were presented at baseline, post-baseline, and change from baseline. At baseline, 
subjects reported slight to modest impairment in all eight dimensions of HRQoL as well as in physical 
and mental health component scores.  
No changes at all were reported in HRQoL scores.  
Ancillary analyses 
Additional comparisons of results were performed for demographics, the number of prior IST therapies 
and  by  cohort  for  the  ELT112523  study.  No  apparent  differences  in  response  to  eltrombopag  were 
noted; albeit these comparisons were limited by the small numbers of subjects.  
Subpopulations  of  age,  sex  and  race  in  ELT112523  are  summarized  below:  Response  rate  was 
compared  by  gender:  11/24  (46%)  males  and  6/19  (32%)  females  responded  to  treatment  with 
eltrombopag;  Comparisons  of  response  by  age  were  not  performed  because  of  the  small  numbers  of 
subjects  <18  years  or  >65  years.  Comparisons  of  response  by  race  were  not  performed  due  to  the 
small number of subjects in each category. 
The  response  rate  was  similar  when  examined  by  the  number  of  prior  IST  received:  1  prior  IST,  3/7 
(43%); 2 prior IST, 8/22 (36%); 3 prior IST 5/11 (45%); and 4 prior IST 1/3 (33%). 
The response observed in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 was similar: Cohort 1: 11/25 subjects (44%); Cohort 
2 6/18 (33%). 
In addition, given the close relationship between transfusions and platelet/RBC counts, the number of 
patients who achieved a response based on increments in platelet and haemoglobin values above the 
established  threshold  and  those  who  reached  a  response  based  on  transfusions  criteria  has  been 
clarified. A total of 11 subjects met the platelet response criteria, 8 of the 11 subjects met the criteria 
by  having  ‘stable  platelet  counts  with  transfusion  independence  for  a  minimum  of  8  weeks’  at  the 
Primary  Response  Assessment.  Seven  of  the  8  subjects  have  not  required  a  subsequent  platelet 
transfusion  (1  subject  had  a  single  platelet  transfusion  after  platelet  response  and  has  subsequently 
been  platelet  transfusion  independent  for  >250  days).  The  remaining  3  subjects  met  the  platelet 
response criteria by having ‘platelet count increases of at least 20Gi/L above baseline’; none of these 3 
subjects had platelet transfusions within 3 months prior to meeting platelet count response criteria. A 
total of  3  subjects  met the  erythroid  response  criteria  at  the  Primary  Response  Assessment,  one  had 
‘an increase in haemoglobin by >1.5 g/dL over baseline <9g/dL’ and 2 had an ‘absolute reduction of at 
least  4  RBC  transfusions  for  8  consecutive  weeks,  compared  to  the  number  of  transfusions  in  the  8 
weeks pre-treatment’. The 2 subjects who met the reduction in RBC transfusion requirements relapsed 
at the Month 3 Extension visit.  
Regarding  the  maintenance  of  the  effect  after  treatment  discontinuation,  as  of  January  2015  cut-off 
date,  7  subjects  that  discontinued  eltrombopag  had  maintained  a  response,  5  correspond  to  those 
reaching  a  tri-lineage  hematologic  response  who  were  able  to  taper  off  (plus  1  additional  case  not 
previously reported) and stop eltrombopag.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
No pooled analyses and/or meta-analysis have been presented. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
There are no new specific studies in special populations.  
The main study included two 17 years old subjects and 14 (32%) elderly patients, two were over 75 
years old. Study ELT116826 has included 3 adolescents and 1 elderly subject (65-69 year old). Study 
ELT116843 has included 7 adolescents up to date.  
Across the 3 SAA studies (ELT112523, ELT116826 and ELT116643) a discussion of the efficacy and 
safety results in the subset of paediatric populations was presented:  
Children and Adolescents  
At the time of enrolment, a total of 18 (13%) of the 134 SAA subjects enrolled in the SAA dataset are 
less than 18 years of age (Table x). The majority (12 subjects) were enrolled in the treatment naïve 
study (ELT116643), which is not the subject of the current application; 6 subjects (all between the 
ages of 12 and 17) had an insufficient response to immunosuppressive therapy and were enrolled in 
ELT112523 and ELT116826. 
Elderly 
As of the 14 January 2015 clinical cut-off date, a total of 24 (18%) of the 134 subjects in the SAA 
eltrombopag dataset are aged 65 or above (Table 4). The majority of subjects (22 subjects) fall into 
the 65-74 age category. No subjects aged 85 or older have been enrolled, and 2 subjects between 75 
and 84 have been enrolled.

Study ELT116826 
Study Design 
ELT116826 is an ongoing, open-label, non-randomized, single-arm, Phase II, single centre study to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of eltrombopag in subjects aged 2 and above with refractory SAA. This 
was an investigator-sponsored study conducted by the NIH. The investigators at the NIH designed this 
study as a non-randomized, single-arm study due to ethical and practical concerns regarding enrolling 
subjects into a randomized study given the results of ELT112523 and the lack of alternative treatment 
options for this patient population. The starting daily dose of eltrombopag was 150 mg, with dose 
adjustment for East Asian and children. The dose of eltrombopag 150 mg dose was chosen for this trial 
based on the results seen in the pivotal study ELT112523, where nearly all subjects required escalation 
to 150 mg to achieve haematologic response. During the extension protocol the same dose 
adjustments as for Study 23 were included.  
The planned enrolment was 60 subjects to have 49 subjects evaluable for response at 6 months. 
Subjects who could not tolerate the medication or did not respond by 24 weeks discontinued 
eltrombopag. Responding subjects were eligible to enter an extended treatment portion of the study. 
The dose of eltrombopag during the extended access was the lowest dosage that maintained stable 
platelet counts. This study is ongoing and data are included up to clinical cut-off 31 March 2014.

The primary endpoint of the study was haematologic response (platelet count, erythroid or neutrophil) 
at 6 months (24 weeks). Haematological response is defined as:  
-Platelet count increases to 20 Gi/L above baseline, or stable platelet counts with transfusion 
independence for a minimum of 8 consecutive weeks; 
-Haemoglobin increase by >1.5 g/dL (for subjects with pre-treatment haemoglobin <9 g/dL), 
or a reduction in the units of red blood cell transfusion by at least 4 of 8 consecutive weeks 
pre-treatment; 
-Absolute neutrophil count increase of 100% (for pre-treatment levels <0.5 Gi/L), or an ANC 
increase >0.5 Gi/L. 
Secondary endpoints included duration of response (haematological responses at 3 months, 12 months 
and yearly thereafter), relapse, and progression to clonal haematopoiesis (PNH evolution, cytogenetic 
abnormalities in bone marrow, myelodysplasia by morphology, or acute leukaemia), survival, and 
health-related quality of life. 
The planned analysis included descriptive statistics on the proportion of responders (% subjects with 
treatment response).  
Results 
As of the clinical cut-off date of 31 March 2014, 15 of the planned 60 subjects have been enrolled. Five 
subjects have completed 6 months of treatment and are evaluable for the 6 month primary response 
assessment; 4 of the 5 subjects have entered the extension phase of the study. Eight subjects are 
ongoing with <6 months on treatment. The remaining 2 subjects discontinued treatment at the 3 
month assessment due to detection of a cytogenetic abnormality. Median age of subjects was 46 years 
(14, 69), with 3 subjects being in the 12-17 year range. Median baseline lab values were 0.53 –Gi/L 
for neutrophils, 11 Gi/L for platelets, 34.7 Gi/L for reticulocytes and 8.6g/dL for haemoglobin. 
At the 31 March 2014 clinical cut-off date, 11 and 6 subjects, respectively, were evaluable or had 
discontinued treatment at the 3 and 6 month response assessments. At the 3 month assessment 4 of 
11 (36%) evaluable subjects met the haematologic response criteria in at least 1 lineage. At the 6 
month assessment (primary response assessment), 4 of 6 (67%) evaluable subjects met the 
haematologic response criteria in at least 1 lineage. As of the clinical cut-off date, 2 of the 4 subjects 
with a response at the 3 month assessment were evaluable and had maintained their response at 6 
months. The remaining 2 subjects had not had their 6 month assessment as of the clinical cut-off date. 
Updated results (cut-off date March 2015)  
Based upon the 14 January 2015 clinical cut-off date, a total of 16 subjects have completed 6 months 
of treatment with eltrombopag. Five additional subjects were withdrawn from treatment with 
eltrombopag prior to completing 6 months of treatment, but are included in the number of subjects

evaluable for response at 6 months according to ITT principles. A total of 21 subjects were evaluable 
for response at the 6 month primary endpoint in the updated dataset. 
Detailed transfusion data are not available for the ongoing ELT116826 study. 
In the supportive study (ELT116826), 4 subjects had a bleeding SAE reported (craniocerebral injury; 
epistaxis; haemorrhage intracranial; and gastrointestinal haemorrhage). None were considered related 
to eltrombopag. Three of the 4 subjects were non-responders to eltrombopag. The remaining subject 
fell and hit her head after 138 days on eltrombopag, prior to achieving a platelet response. Her platelet 
count was <20Gi/L and the fall resulted in a small intracranial haemorrhage. The subject was 
hospitalized overnight and received a platelet transfusion. The subject remained on the study, 
achieved a tri-lineage response to eltrombopag and as of the clinical cut-off, was continuing on study 
(Day 354). In summary, after achieving the platelet haematologic response criteria, no clinically 
relevant bleeding AEs have been reported across the 2 studies.  
In the supportive study (ELT116826), a total of 6 subjects had at least 1 SAE of infection. Five of these 
subjects did not have an ANC response or had the infection prior to neutrophil response. One subject 
had a SAE of colitis reported during an ANC response (100% increase in ANC to 0.35Gi/L from a 
baseline of 0.14Gi/L). 
Study ELT116643 
Study Design 
ELT116643 is an open-label, single-arm, Phase I/II single centre study to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of eltrombopag in combination with hATG/CsA in treatment naïve subjects with SAA. Sixty-two 
subjects will be enrolled in this study; the first 31 subjects will be enrolled to Cohort 1 (eltrombopag 
treatment for 6 months) and the remaining 31 subjects will be enrolled to Cohort 2 (eltrombopag 
treatment for 3 months). This was an investigator-sponsored study conducted by the NIH. 
The starting daily dose of eltrombopag was determined by subject age and ethnicity, 150 mg once 
daily in the >12 year old subjects (75 mg for East Asian subjects), in combination with a standard 
regimen of hATG/CsA. Eltrombopag was initiated on day 14 to avoid overlap with the known transient 
hepatotoxicities associated with hATG/CsA.  
The dose of eltrombopag 150 mg dose was chosen for this trial based on the results seen in the pivotal 
study ELT112523, where nearly all subjects required escalation to 150 mg to achieve haematologic 
response. Dose delays or dosing interruptions of eltrombopag were permitted when clinically indicated 
at the discretion of the investigator. In both cohorts, the primary endpoint was complete haematologic

response at 6 months. Subject reported outcomes were collected at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 
annually for 5 years. 
Eltrombopag was discontinued at 6 months along with the CsA regardless of response characteristics 
for Cohort 1 subjects. In Cohort 2 subjects, eltrombopag was discontinued at 3 months and CsA was 
continued until 6 months. This study is ongoing and data are included up to clinical cut-off 31 March 
2014. 
The primary endpoint was the rate of complete haematologic response at six months. A complete 
response (CR) was defined as meeting all 3 of the following values on 2 serial blood count 
measurements at least 1 week apart at landmark time points (3 and 6 months): ANC >1 Gi/L,  Platelet 
count >100 Gi/L, Hgb >10 g/dL. 
The key secondary efficacy endpoint was partial response (PR), defined as blood counts no longer 
meeting the standard (‘Camitta’) criteria for severe pancytopenia in SAA, equivalent to 2 of the 
following values obtained on 2 serial blood count measurements at least 1 week apart at landmark 
time points (3 and 6 months): ANC >0.5 Gi/L, platelet count >20 Gi/L and/or Absolute reticulocyte 
count (ARC) >60 Gi/L. The planned analyses include descriptive statistics on the proportions of 
responses (% subjects with partial or complete response). 
Results 
As of the clinical cut-off date of 31 March 2014, 31 of the planned 31 subjects have been enrolled in 
Cohort 1; 16 of the planned 31 subjects have been enrolled in cohort 2. A total of 44 patients have 
received treatment with eltrombopag: 13 are ongoing, 27 have completed the planned eltrombopag 
treatment period and 4 discontinued eltrombopag prior to completion of the planned treatment period.  
Median age of subjects was 39 years (12, 72), with 7 subjects being less than 18 years of age (12-17). 
At the 6 month assessment, the primary endpoint of CR was met by 10 (36%, [95% CI: 19%, 56%]) 
of 28 evaluable subjects and 22 subjects overall (79%) had a CR or PR. At the 3 month assessment, 6 
(18%) of 33 subjects had a CR, and 26 subjects (79%) had an overall response. 
As of the clinical cut-off date, 5 of the 6 subjects with a CR at 3 months were evaluable and 
maintained a CR at the 6 month assessment. The remaining subject had not had his or her 6 month 
assessment as of the clinical cut-off date. The remaining 5 subjects with a CR at 6 months had PR at 
the 3 month assessment. Five of the 10 subjects with CRs reported at 6 months met the SAA criteria in 
all 3 lineages at baseline. Of the subjects who responded, 5 subjects relapsed after per protocol 
discontinuation of eltrombopag at 6 months. No responding subjects relapsed while receiving 
eltrombopag treatment. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The main evidence of the efficacy of eltrombopag in SAA is provided by study ELT112523, a non-
randomized, single-arm, open-label, Phase II study of eltrombopag in subjects with SAA and 
insufficient response after treatment with ATG/CsA. Supportive efficacy is provided from an ongoing 
non-randomized, Phase II, single-arm, open-label dose modification study (ELT116826) in refractory 
SAA subjects, that intend to improve and replicate Study ELT112523 results. Additional data from an 
ongoing, non-randomized, Phase I/II, single-arm, open-label study (ELT116643) of eltrombopag in 
combination with horse anti-thymocyte globulin (hATG)/CsA in treatment naïve SAA subjects is 
provided, although this is less relevant for the claimed indication. These were investigator-sponsored 
Assessment report

studies conducted by the Hematology Branch of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute/National 
Institutes of Health (NHLBI/NIH) and supported by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Considering the rarity of the disease in general, particularly the subset of patients with refractory SAA, 
and also bearing in mind that for these patients there are few treatment options available, mostly 
experimental, the challenges for conducting a randomized controlled trial are acknowledged, therefore 
the submitted evidence, mostly based on two single-arm, non-randomized and open label trials can be 
considered an acceptable approach. 
Study ELT112523 was aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of eltrombopag in subjects with SAA and 
an insufficient response to IST. The primary endpoint was the response rate of investigator-assessed 
haematologic response measured by blood counts (at least improvement in one lineage: platelets, 
haemoglobin or neutrophils) or transfusion-independence at week 12. Changes in transfusion 
requirements might be a relevant palliative effect. Secondary endpoints were mainly aimed to assess 
the improvement or maintenance of the response with long-term treatment, HRQoL, changes in bone 
marrow cellularity/morphology. Patients who reached a response at the primary 12-week assessment 
entered the extension phase, where the dose of eltrombopag was at the lowest dosage that 
maintained a stable platelet count until subjects met off-study criteria. Eltrombopag was tapered and 
stopped in subjects who achieved tri-lineage haematopoiesis (defined as platelets >50 Gi/L, 
haemoglobin [Hgb] >10 g/dL in the absence of RBC transfusions, and ANC >1 Gi/L for more than 8 
weeks).  
The included patient population appears well defined and representative of the intended target 
population. Further, the criteria to define transfusion requirements have been clarified. Although no 
standardised criteria were applied in the study protocols, centre clinical practice criteria were to be 
followed and these appear rather conservative and in line with clinical practice in the EU. Durable of 
transfusion independence responses support that the risk of bias due to the open label design of the 
study and potential change in transfusion practice would be unlikely.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 44 patients age ≥12 years old with diagnosis of SAA with immunosuppressive therapy 
refractory thrombocytopenia were included. The starting dose of eltrombopag was 50 mg daily (25 mg 
for East Asian subjects), and the dose was increased to a maximum of 150 mg daily (75 mg for East 
Asian subjects).  
In contrast to the approved indications, responses to treatment in SAA took up to 16 weeks and nearly 
all subjects (40/43; 93%) escalated to the maximum dose of eltrombopag 150 mg daily. Subjects who 
achieved the ‘trilineage haematopoiesis’ criteria (defined as platelets >50 Gi/L, Hgb >10 g/dL in the 
absence of RBC transfusions, and ANC >1 Gi/L for more than 8 weeks) were tapered off of 
eltrombopag in 75 mg increments every 8 weeks provided criteria continued to be met. Five subjects 
tapered off eltrombopag treatment after meeting these criteria in ELT112523; none of these subjects 
have subsequently relapsed, with median follow-up duration of 20.6 months. Although subject 
numbers are limited, these data support the proposal to reduce the dose by up to 50% once ‘tri-
lineage haematopoiesis’ criteria have been sustained for 8 weeks.  If counts stay stable after 8 weeks 
at the reduced dose, then discontinue eltrombopag and monitor blood counts. If platelet counts drop to 
< 30 Gi/L, Hgb to < 9 g/dL or ANC < 0.5 Gi/L, eltrombopag may be reinitiated at the previous 
effective dose (see SmPC section 4.2). It can be acknowledged that treatment effect may take some 
time in this refractory population where no optimal treatments are available and thus, following 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/598426/2015  
Page 28/58 
 
 
 
 
 
recommendations of the pivotal study, the proposal to discontinue treatment if no response is reached 
at week 16 can be considered a reasonable approach (see SmPC section 4.2).  
Overall, the main study included a heavily pre-treated SAA population. All subjects had an insufficient 
response to prior intensive immunosuppressive therapy (including hATG, rabbit ATG, alemtuzumab and 
cyclophosphamide), in fact 77% of patients were truly refractory patients while 33% were relapse-
refractory (i.e. insufficient responses despite at least 2 prior IS treatment). Subjects were heavily 
pretreated with 84% of subjects having received at least 2 prior immunosuppressive regimens and 
more than 30% of subjects having received at least 3 prior immunosuppressive regimens. The median 
time since diagnosis of SAA until screening was 31 months (range: 10-190 months). All subjects met 
criteria for diagnosis of SAA and the baseline median values for ANC, platelets, haemoglobin and 
reticulocytes were indicative of the pancytopenic SAA patient population despite inclusion of laboratory 
values from patients recently transfused. At baseline, 91% of subjects were platelet transfusion-
dependent and 86% were RBC transfusion-dependent. Subjects received a median of 4 platelet 
transfusions and 4 RBC transfusions in the 4 weeks prior to entry into the study. 
Haematologic response was achieved in 17 out of 43 subjects (40%) in at least 1 lineage (95% CI: 25-
56%). One subject had a tri-lineage response, 3 subjects had bi-lineage responses, and the remaining 
13 had a uni-lineage response at week 12. The majority of responders (65%) met platelet response 
criteria, followed by ANC and haemoglobin response criteria (47% and 18%, respectively). Fourteen of 
the 17 responders entered into the extension phase. As of the clinical cut-off date, 10 responders 
(65%) were ongoing in the study and continued to maintain a response. Of the 14 subjects who 
entered the extension phase of the trial, 7 subjects had improvements in more than 1 lineage following 
continuation of treatment: 5 subjects with uni-lineage response improved to multi-lineage response 
(bi-lineage or tri-lineage), 2 subjects with bi-lineage response improved to tri-lineage response, the 
remaining 8 patients with a response at week 12 remained uni-lineage responders. For 14 of 17 
subjects, including all 9 tri-lineage and bi-lineage responders, the last response assessed was the 
same as the best response. The remaining 3 subjects relapsed at the Month 3 Extension visit.  Of the 
17 subjects who responded, fifteen were evaluable for assessment of response duration and had a 
median duration of investigator-assessed response of 12.0 month. At the last response assessment of 
the 10 patients who were ongoing or completed the extension phase, the median duration of response 
was 32.9 months (range: 11.0 to 54.8 months). The remaining 5 subjects stopped treatment in the 
extension and are no longer being  followed for efficacy (1 subject due to an AE, 1 subject due to a 
cytogenetic change and 3 subjects due to relapse).  
The effect on transfusion dependence is considered another way to interpret the clinical relevance of 
the observed effect. In the absence of a control arm, the assessment of changes in transfusion 
requirements before treatment and after treatment is the most reasonable approach. According to the 
study protocol a patient was considered transfusion independent if remained free of transfusion during 
28 days for platelet or 56 days for RBC at any time during the treatment period. A total of 59% and 
27% of patients became platelet and RBC transfusion independent, respectively. The median of days 
free of platelet or RBC transfusions were 287 days and 266 days, respectively in the 17 responder 
patients, respectively. For non-responders, median days free of transfusions were 27 days for platelets 
and 28.5 days for RBC. So, responders to eltrombopag had a median duration of platelet and RBC 
transfusion independence of approximately 9 and 8 months, respectively, which is considered a 
relevant effect. As of the clinical cut off the maximum duration of platelet and RBC transfusion free 
days was over 3 years and was continuing. Another way of evaluating the transfusion requirements in 
this patient population is to compare the transfusion requirements of responders pre- and post-
treatment with eltrombopag. Nearly half of the responders who were platelet transfusion dependent at 
baseline, had a 100% reduction in platelet transfusion requirements, and 60% had at least a 50% 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/598426/2015  
Page 29/58 
 
 
 
 
 
reduction in platelet transfusion requirements. Nearly a quarter of the subjects who were RBC 
transfusion dependent at baseline, had a 100% reduction in RBC transfusion requirements, and 62% 
had at least a 50% reduction in RBC transfusion requirements. Based upon this analysis, eltrombopag 
treatment resulted in a > 80% reduction in transfusion requirement compared to baseline in 53% of 
platelet transfusion dependent subjects and 54% of RBC transfusion dependent subjects. 
In addition, given the close relationship between transfusions and platelet/RBC counts,  
Eleven (11) patients achieved a response by meeting the platelet response criteria, 8 of the 11 
subjects met the criteria by having ‘stable platelet counts with transfusion independence for a 
minimum of 8 weeks’ at the Primary Response Assessment.  
Bone marrow examinations in responders did not suggest any event of particular concern. By contrary, 
restoration of bone marrow cellularity and haematopoiesis was reported in some responder subjects. 
No changes in HRQOL were detected relative to baseline at the timepoint assessed (Week 12 or 16), 
which is not unexpected given the short period of time and considering that some patients continued 
improving during the long-term follow up. Despite that the MAH argues that there was a trend for 
improvements in responders as well as anecdotal reports of improvements in daily activities, actually 
HRQoL was not properly evaluated beyond week 12 and data available are of little value to make any 
conclusion. 
Response of 40% (17/43 patients) in at least 1 lineage at week 12, with continuous improvements 
observed in 9 patients with continuous treatment, including 5 tri-lineage responses, are considered 
encouraging results for a difficult to treat SAA population. It is recognised that the proportion of 
patient with a relevant benefit maintained in the long term is limited to 9 out of the initially included 
43 patients, which is a small subset of the included population, but might be of relevance in a truly 
refractory SAA population. In fact, it is highlighted that one quarter of responders had multi-lineage 
responses at the Primary Response assessment and that this improved to approximately half of 
responders over time. The median duration of response was 1 year and no subjects with multi-lineage 
responses have relapsed, indicating durability of response. Subjects meeting protocol-defined tri-
lineage blood counts no longer required treatment with eltrombopag and all have maintained their 
responses off of eltrombopag, with a median time off-drug of >20 months.  
The relevance of the effect is in fact further substantiated by the effect in transfusion requirements as 
well as some benefit in terms of bleeding and infections reduction following improvement in blood 
counts. A total of 17 subjects had at least one bleeding AE reported on-therapy; none were considered 
related to treatment and none were serious. The majority of these subjects (15) did not respond to 
eltrombopag or had the bleeding AE prior to platelet response. Following achieving the platelet 
haematologic response criteria, a total of 2 subjects had a single bleeding AE each (ecchymosis and 
contusion, respectively). Concerning the incidence of infectious, a total of 19 subjects in the study had 
at least 1 AE of infection. The majority (11) of the subjects with infections reported were non-
responders. The proportion of non-responders with 3 or more AEs of infections was double (12%) that 
observed in responders (6%). No responders had more than one SAE of infection reported, compared 
to 15% of non-responders. 
The effect on survival was not included as an endpoint and given that non-responders were not 
followed beyond week 16, no conclusions can be drawn. Kaplan-Meier curves have been generated for 
the overall population and for responders: the KM estimate of the 1- year survival rate is 79% for all 
43 subjects and the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the 1-year survival rate for the 17 responders is 93%. In 
the context of the poor outcomes expected in patients who have an insufficient response to IST (40%

mortality from complications of pancytopenia within 5 years of diagnosis), these results should be 
interpreted with caution.  
From an efficacy point of view, only Study ELT116826 provides relevant supportive information for the 
claimed indication. The MAH initially presented very preliminary results corresponding to March 2014 
cut-off date, with only 5 out of 60 subjects reaching the 6 month time point for the primary 
assessment. Updated data with a cut-off date January 2015 (including data available for a total of 21 
subjects with 6-month efficacy assessment) provided consistent results to the pivotal study in the 
refractory SAA population following treatment with eltrombopag. The primary endpoint of haematologic 
response, measured by blood counts (platelets, haemoglobin or neutrophils) or reduction in platelet or 
RBC transfusions was achieved by 46% of subjects at 3 months and by 52% of subjects at the 6 
month primary endpoint. Consistent with the observations from the pivotal study, the improvements in 
response were observed over time, with a higher proportion of responders at 6 months than at 3 
months, and with a higher proportion of multi-lineage responses at 6 months than at 3 months. Some 
support from bleeding events and infectious was observed.  
Although there was no concurrent comparisons and these preliminary data should be interpreted with 
caution, the consistent results from the replicated ongoing phase II study is considered to add 
robustness to the observed effect. Further, in the context of available treatment options results are 
considered clinically relevant and a suitable option for patients otherwise not candidates to HSCT.  
In the SAA patient population eltrombopag is titrated to response based on platelet counts. The 
starting dose in ELT112523 was 50 mg once daily. Dose escalations in 25 mg increments every 2 
weeks were performed based upon platelet response, up to a maximum dose of 150 mg daily. The 
starting dose in ELT116826 and ELT116643 was 150 mg.  
The proposed dose escalating strategy (see SmPC section 4.2) has not been formally tested in any of 
the studies conducted; however, based on available data the proposed posology appears well justified 
and can be supported.  The second phase II study which tests an starting dose of 150 mg is still 
ongoing it appears reasonable awaiting final study results before considering an alternative posology. 
A priori no relevant factors could be identified to select patients likely to respond to eltrombopag. No 
apparent differences in response to eltrombopag based upon the following baseline demographics and 
disease characteristics: age, race, gender, prior treatments, transfusion requirements, number of 
cytopenias, abnormal karyotype, time since last IST and primary refractory or relapsed refractory to 
prior IST.  
Given that hereditary AA were systematically excluded and considering that “insufficient response to 
prior IS therapy” appears too vague to properly define the target population, the CHMPconsiders that 
the indication should be revised to adult patients with acquired severe aplastic anaemia (SAA) who 
were either refractory to prior immunosuppressive therapy or heavily pretreated and are unsuitable for 
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Considering the rarity of the disease, the poor prognosis of subjects with refractory acquired SAA and 
the recognised unmet medical need, results from the two open label non comparative studies provide 
sufficient evidence of a clinically relevant effect in the treatment of adult patients with acquired severe 
aplastic anaemia (SAA) who were either refractory to prior treatments or heavily pretreated and are 
unsuitable for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The primary safety database comes from the pivotal Phase II Study ELT112523 (NIH); supportive 
safety data in SAA subjects are provided from the ongoing Phase II Study ELT116826 (NIH 13-H-
0133) in subjects with an insufficient response to IST. An ongoing ELT116643 in subjects of 2 years of 
age or older with treatment-naïve SAA is also presented. Additional supportive safety data are 
provided from a completed, placebo-controlled Phase I/II Study PMA112509 in subjects with advanced 
MDS or acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) 
Patient exposure 
The Safety Population consists of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of eltrombopag in Studies 
ELT112523, ELT116826, and ELT116643, and all subjects who received at least 1 dose of eltrombopag 
or placebo in Study PMA112509. The safety data from the pivotal Study ELT112523 is not integrated 
with any other eltrombopag safety data.   
Exposure in ELT112523:  
Of the 43 subjects who received eltrombopag in Study ELT112523, 40 (93%) were escalated to the 
maximum dose of eltrombopag 150 mg. Three subjects received a maximum dose of eltrombopag 125 
mg. Enrolment for Study ELT112523 was completed in February 2013. As of the data cut-off date, the 
majority of subjects (33) had completed treatment and follow-up in the study, the remaining 10 
subjects were ongoing in the study (4 subjects continue to receive treatment with eltrombopag, 5 had 
tapered off eltrombopag due to trilineage haematopoiesis and 1 subject discontinued treatment due to 
a cytogenetic abnormality and continued in the study off-therapy for efficacy follow-up).  
As of the safety update of 14.01.2015, 9 subjects were ongoing in the study and 1 was withdrawn 
from the study. Of the 9 subjects ongoing in the study, 3 subjects continue to receive eltrombopag 
(durations of ~2.5-4.5 years) and have maintained responses. Six subjects have tapered off 
eltrombopag due to tri-lineage haematopoiesis (1 additional subject since the Type II variation) and 
have maintained response without additional treatment for SAA as of the 14 January 2015 clinical cut-
off. The subject withdrawn from the study as of this safety update had previously discontinued 
treatment due to a cytogenetic abnormality and continued in the study off-therapy for efficacy follow-
up. After continuing follow-up for approximately 1 year after the last dose of eltrombopag, the 
subjects’ counts began to decline and the subject was referred to another trial.  
The majority of subjects (77%) have received eltrombopag for at least 3 months (Table x). A total of 
12 subjects (28%) have received eltrombopag for over 6 months and 10 (23%) have been exposed to 
eltrombopag for at least 1 year.

Exposure in ELT116826: 
Of the 15 subjects who received eltrombopag up to 150 mg, 5 subjects completed 6 months of 
treatment with eltrombopag and 4 of the 5 subjects had entered the extension phase of the study. 
Enrolment is ongoing for Study ELT116826 in subjects with an insufficient response to prior 
immunosuppressive therapy. As of the clinical cut-off date (January 2015), 28 of the planned 60 
subjects with previously treated SAA have been enrolled in Study ELT116826. Sixteen subjects have 
completed 6 months of treatment and are evaluable for the 6 month primary response assessment. 
Eleven of the 16 subjects are continuing treatment with eltrombopag in the extension. Seven ongoing 
subjects have received treatment for less than 6 months. The remaining 5 subjects discontinued 
treatment prior to completing 6 months of treatment. 
ELT116643 Exposure:  
Of the 44 subjects who received eltrombopag up to 150 mg, 19 subjects completed the planned 6-
month eltrombopag treatment period in Cohort 1 and 8 subjects completed the planned 6-month 
period in Cohort 2.  As of the clinical cut-off date of 14 January 2015, Cohorts 1 and 2 have been fully 
enrolled, and 1 of the planned 31 subjects have been enrolled in Cohort 3. A total of 62 subjects in 
Study ELT116643 have received treatment with eltrombopag compared with 47 subjects in the main 
study (Table 6). As previously reported, 1 subject received treatment with hATG/CsA but did not 
receive eltrombopag due to the detection of a cytogenetic abnormality on the baseline bone marrow 
aspirate. This subject is not included in the assessment of safety. 
Adverse events  
ELT112523  
In Study ELT112523, on-therapy AEs were defined as those that occurred from the date of first dose of 
eltrombopag treatment to 30 days following the date of last dose of eltrombopag treatment. Nearly all 
subjects (93%) experienced at least 1 AE on-therapy and the majority of subjects had at least 1 AE 
considered by the investigator as possibly related to treatment. Five subjects had an AE that led to 
treatment discontinuation.  
Nausea, fatigue, cough, diarrhoea, and headache were the most common AEs, reported by ≥20% of 
subjects. Thirty subjects (70%) in Study ELT112523 had at least 1 AE considered by the investigator

to be related to treatment, nausea, headache, and diarrhoea were the most common AEs (>20%) 
considered related to treatment. Abdominal pain was recorded 12%.  
ELT116826  
As of the clinical cut-off data (31 March 2014) in Study ELT116826, no AEs have led to discontinuation 
of eltrombopag treatment.  
ELT116643  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Study ELT1125223  
Thirty-three percent of subjects had an on-therapy SAE. Two deaths occurred during the on-therapy 
period of the study; a total of 6 deaths occurred during the entire study period.  
As of the clinical cut-off data (31 March 2014) in Study ELT116643, there were 18 (41%) SAE, one of 
them was a SAE possibly related to eltrombopag. There was not AE leading to permanent 
discontinuation of study treatment. 
Deaths 
A total of 6 deaths (14%) were reported during this study. None of the 6 deaths were considered 
related to treatment by the investigator. No subjects died while receiving eltrombopag; 2 subjects died 
of sepsis/infection within 30 days of the last dose of eltrombopag and 4 subjects died more than 110 
days after the last dose of eltrombopag.   
The primary cause of death was disease under study, specifically sepsis/infection in 4 subjects; 3 of 
these subjects did not respond to treatment; 1 subject had a transient ANC response, which was not 
maintained at the Month 3 extension assessment. 
One subject who had monosomy 7 detected in 4/20 metaphases at the Primary Response Assessment 
died from MDS/AML approximately 7 months after discontinuing treatment with eltrombopag. One 
subject died of an unknown cause approximately 4 months after the last dose of eltrombopag. 
SAEs  
The most common SAE reported on-therapy was febrile neutropenia, followed by sepsis and viral 
infection. The percent of responders with infectious SAEs (3/17; 18%) was less than that in non-
responders (8/26; 30%) despite the shorter observation time for non-responders. Most subjects had 
recovered or were recovering from the SAE as of the data cut-off (09 May 2014), although 1 patient 
with aplasic anaemia and other with septic shock died. One subject had an SAE of abdominal 
discomfort that was considered related to treatment by the investigator. 
Since the 9 May 2014 clinical cut-off date for ELT112523, no new SAEs or deaths have been reported 
up to the 14 January 2015 clinical cut-off date. Updated SAE narratives for the 16 subjects with SAEs 
(14 subjects with on-therapy SAEs) reported in the trial have been included. No new cytogenetic 
abnormalities, or cases of MDS or AML have been reported.  
Adverse Events Leading to Permanent Discontinuation of Study Treatment At the time of the data cut-
off for the Type II variation, 4 subjects (9%) in Study ELT112523 had discontinued treatment with 
eltrombopag due to AEs. As of the safety update clinical cut-off date, no additional subjects have 
discontinued treatment with eltrombopag due to AEs.

Study  ELT116826 
Deaths and SAEs 
Six subjects out of 15 have had at least 1 SAE reported, none of which were considered related to 
treatment. No deaths have been reported. At the time of the data cut-off no deaths had been reported 
in Study ELT116826. As of the clinical cut-off date for this safety update, 2 subjects have died off 
therapy, one due to septic shock and diverticular perforation 146 days after the last dose of 
eltrombopag, and one due to sepsis 33 days after the last dose of eltrombopag. Both subjects and the 
events leading to death are presented below in the SAE section and narratives for the subjects are 
provided.  
In Study ELT116826 at the time of the data cut-off for the Type II variation, 6 of the 15 subjects 
(40%) had 11 SAEs reported. As of the clinical cut-off date for this safety update, a total of 8 of 28 
subjects (29%) have had a total of 25 SAEs reported. The most common SAEs reported in this study 
were infection and febrile neutropenia. None of the new SAEs for the safety update were considered 
related to eltrombopag treatment by the investigator. 
Study ELT116643  
Deaths and SAEs 
As of the data cut-off date (31 March 2014), 1 subject died of encephalopathy and respiratory failure 
while on-therapy; neither event was considered related to study treatments. The 55-year-old male 
died of Grade 5 encephalopathy and respiratory failure 71 days after starting eltrombopag following 
ATG/CsA therapy. The subject was hospitalized approximately 1 month prior with recurrent 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the setting of severe neutropaenia. The events were complicated by 
cardiac tamponade and altered mental status requiring intubation and were considered unrelated to 
study treatment.  
During the safety update period, 2 additional deaths have been reported, both occurred off therapy, 
≥11 months after the last dose of eltrombopag.  
-One subject died approximately 11 months after the last dose of eltrombopag. The subject died 
following transplant due to graft versus host disease (GVHD), Group B Strep bacteremia red cell and 
platelet destruction, and cerebral haemorrhage. 
-One subject died approximately 2 years after the last dose of eltrombopag; the cause of death was 
reported as ‘post-BMT, relapsed AML’. 
In Study ELT116643, 18 of the 44 subjects (41%) who received eltrombopag had 31 SAEs reported to 
the MAH. One event of squamous cell carcinoma was considered possibly related to treatment with 
hATG/CsA and eltrombopag. One subject had fatal events of encephalopathy and respiratory failure, 
which were not considered related to treatment. In Study ELT116643 at the time of the data cut-off for 
the Type II variation, 18 of the 44 subjects (41%) who received eltrombopag had 31 serious AEs 
reported. As of the clinical cut-off date for this safety update, a total of 26 of 62 subjects (42%) have 
had a total of 54 SAEs reported. The most common SAE reported in this study was febrile neutropenia 
in 8 subjects. One new event of rash was considered possibly related to eltrombopag. 
Analysis of Adverse Events by Organ System or Syndrome 
Several categories of AEs of special interest were analysed further: hepatobiliary events, treatment 
emergent events (TEEs), cytogenetic abnormalities, and haematologic malignancies. 
Hepatobiliary 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/598426/2015  
Page 35/58 
 
 
 
 
 
Two subjects in Study ELT112523 had ALT or AST >3x the upper limit of normal (ULN) concurrent with 
total bilirubin >1.5xULN. In both cases, bilirubin elevations were due to indirect bilirubin.  
Hepatobiliary AEs were reported for 16 subjects. Thirteen subjects had no changes to eltrombopag 
dosing; 2 subjects (Subjects 25 and 44) had treatment interrupted due to elevated LFTs and 1 subject 
(Subject 21) discontinued treatment due to acute hepatitis B. 
Eleven of the 16 subjects had a maximum laboratory toxicity grade of Grade 1 (5 subjects) or Grade 2 
(6 subjects). Seven of the 11 subjects with Grade 1 or Grade 2 elevations had a history of elevated 
LFTs or entered the study with elevated LFTs. Four subjects had a laboratory toxicity grade of Grade 3 
ALT or AST reported during the study. One additional subject had CTCAE Grade 3 AEs of elevated ALT 
and AST reported. All 4 subjects with Grade 3 hepatobiliary laboratory values had prior history of 
transaminase elevations and/or elevations at baseline.  
As of the clinical cut-off date of 31 March 2014, no hepatobiliary SAEs had been reported in either 
Study ELT116826 or Study ELT116643  
Thromboembolic Events 
No TEEs have been reported during treatment in Study ELT112523, Study ELT116826, or in Study 
ELT116643. One subject (Subject 12) in ELT112523 had an unrelated SAE of deep vein thrombosis 
which occurred 14 months after discontinuation of treatment with eltrombopag. 
Cytogenetic Abnormalities 
Consistent with the known occurrence of cytogenetic abnormalities in SAA, 7% of subjects in Study 
ELT112523 had a cytogenetic abnormality present at baseline. Eight subjects (19%) had a new 
cytogenetic abnormality detected after treatment in Study ELT112523. Of these, 5 subjects had 
cytogenetic abnormalities affecting the structure or number of chromosome 7; all 5 were non-
responders to eltrombopag and the cytogenetic abnormality was detected at the Primary Response 
Assessment. One of these 5 subjects had insufficient bone marrow aspirate at baseline so it is 
unknown whether the cytogenetic abnormality was present in the bone marrow prior to treatment with 
eltrombopag. In 1 subject, the monosomy 7 was transient and was not present on the repeat bone 
marrow 21 days later. The 3 remaining subjects had trisomy 8 and deletion of chromosome 13. 
For the 8 subjects who had a cytogenetic abnormality detected during the study, the median time on 
study to a cytogenetic abnormality was 3.1 months. Three of the 8 subjects with a cytogenetic 
abnormality detected after treatment had evidence of dysplasia in their bone marrow examinations 
A total of 3 subjects were considered to have MDS and are described. Of note, 1 subject with ‘mild 
dyserythropoiesis’ noted on the bone marrow report was not reported to have had MDS by the 
investigator. 
For the 6 subjects who did not respond to eltrombopag, the cytogenetic abnormality was detected at 
the Primary Response visit. The two subjects who responded to treatment with eltrombopag had the 
cytogenetic abnormality detected 13.7 and 9.6 months after initiating treatment with eltrombopag. 
The median time from diagnosis of SAA to detection of cytogenetic abnormality was greater than 5 
years. The time from last IST cytogenetic abnormality ranged from 1 to 4 years. 
In Study ELT116826, cytogenetic abnormalities affecting chromosome 7 (one subject, non-responder) 
and 13 (one subject, non-responder), respectively, were detected post-baseline in 2 subjects (13%) at 
the 3 month response assessment 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/598426/2015  
Page 36/58 
 
 
 
 
 
In Study ELT116643, cytogenetic abnormalities affecting chromosome 7 (one subject, non-responder) 
and chromosome 13 (one subject, complete response), respectively, were detected post-baseline in 2 
subjects (4%) at the 3 month response assessment 
Haematologic Malignancies 
Three subjects in Study ELT112523 were diagnosed by the investigator with MDS following treatment 
with eltrombopag. As of the clinical data cut-off date (31 March 2014), the development of MDS or 
AML had not been reported in Study ELT116826. In Study ELT116643, 1 subject  who did not respond 
after 3 months and developed monosomy 7-associated dysplasia consistent with MDS and discontinued 
treatment.  
Updated safety report for the three ongoing studies 
Study ELT112523: There were no new reports of thromboembolic, hepatobiliary SAEs or AEs leading to 
treatment discontinuation during the safety update period. There were no new reports of cytogenetic 
abnormalities or haematologic malignancies in the safety update period. 
Study ELT116826: There were no reports of hepatobiliary, TEEs, SAEs or AEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation in Study ELT116826. 
With this safety update, 2 (7%) of subjects enrolled in the study had cytogenetic abnormalities 
detected on their baseline bone marrow examination. Both subjects received treatment with 
eltrombopag through the 6 month primary endpoint assessment (1 non-responder and 1 tri-lineage 
responder). 2 additional subjects had new cytogenetic abnormalities detected at the 3 month 
assessment, for a total of 4 (14%). Both of these subjects were responders to treatment, 1 subject 
was discontinued from eltrombopag and 1 subjects is continuing to receive eltrombopag. No new 
cytogenetic abnormalities have been reported at the 6 month assessment or during the extension. A 
brief summary of each subject is provided below. 
One subject had trisomy 6 detected in 7/20 metaphases at the 3 month assessment. The subject was 
a platelet responder at the 3 month assessment. Treatment with eltrombopag was discontinued due to 
the cytogenetic change. At the 6 month follow-up, trisomy 6 was present in 1/20 metaphases. 
One subject had +Y detected in 2/20 metaphases at the 3 month assessment and in 1/20 metaphases 
at the 6 month assessment. The subject was an ANC responder at 3 months and an ANC and RBC 
responder at 6 months. The subject is continuing to receive treatment with eltrombopag in the 
extension portion of the study. 
At the time of the data cut-off for the Type II variation, no subjects had haematologic malignancies 
reported in ELT116826. As of the clinical cut-off for this safety update, 1 subject had leukaemic 
progression reported following treatment in the study and is described below. 
One subject, a 55 year old male, had no mitotic activity for karyotype analysis from the bone marrow 
aspirate at baseline. The subject received eltrombopag, 75 mg for approximately 3 months. The 
subject missed the 3 month assessment and had leukemic progression reported. The subject died from 
sepsis following treatment with induction chemotherapy 33 days after the last dose of eltrombopag. 
Study ELT116643: There were no reports of hepatobiliary or thromboembolic SAEs or AEs leading to 
treatment discontinuation in Study ELT116643 during the safety update period. Updated cases of 
cytogenetic abnormalities and haematologic malignancies are presented below. 
As of the clinical cut-off for this safety update, 2 additional subjects had new cytogenetic abnormalities 
detected off therapy, for a total of 4 subjects (6%) with new cytogenetic abnormalities detected. As

previously reported, 2 subjects had the cytogenetic abnormality detected on-therapy, at the 3 month 
response assessment. A brief summary of all 4 subjects is provided below. 
- One subject (Cohort 1) had monosomy 7 detected at the 3 month response assessment, with no 
response to treatment with hATG/CsA and eltrombopag. Eltrombopag was discontinued. 
- One subject (Cohort 1) had deletion in chromosome 13 detected at the 3 month response 
assessment; this cytogenetic change was not associated with dysplasia. This subject also had a CR 
following treatment with hATG/CsA and eltrombopag at the 3 month response assessment. Treatment 
with eltrombopag was discontinued due to both the CR and the cytogenetic change. 
The 2 additional subjects had cytogenetic abnormalities detected off-therapy, 3 months and 2 years, 
respectively, after the last dose of eltrombopag. 
- One subject (Cohort 2) had monosomy 7 detected in 3 of 22 metaphases at the 6 month primary 
endpoint assessment, 3 months after the last dose of eltrombopag. This subject had a CR at both the 3 
and 6 month response assessments. Approximately 3 months after the detection of monosomy 7, the 
subject was transplanted. 
- One subject (Cohort 1) had a PR at the 3 month response assessment and a CR at the 6 month 
primary endpoint. The CR was maintained at the 1 and 2 year time points. Approximately 2 years after 
the last dose of eltrombopag, a cytogenetic abnormality of +6, +15 was detected in 2 of 21 
metaphases. 
At the time of the data cut-off for the Type II variation, no subjects had haematologic malignancies 
reported in ELT116643. As of the clinical cut-off for this safety update, 1 subject had evidence of 
dysplasia and blasts; this subject subsequently died of relapsed AML post-transplant. No other cases of 
MDS or AML have been reported in the study. 
- One subject (described above under Cytogenetic Abnormalities) had monosomy 7 detected at the 3 
month response assessment, with no response to treatment with hATG/CsA and eltrombopag. 
Eltrombopag was discontinued. A repeat bone marrow examination 1 month later showed evidence of 
dysplasia and an increase in blasts consistent with development of myelodysplastic syndrome. The 
subject died approximately 2 years after the last dose of eltrombopag, cause of death was reported as 
‘post-BMT, relapsed AML’. 
Laboratory findings 
The majority of Grade changes were to Grade 1-2. No chemistry lab parameters had a change to 
toxicity Grade 4.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The observed eltrombopag exposure in 23 SAA subjects treated concomitantly with eltrombopag and 
ATG/CsA was 2 to 3 times higher than that observed in healthy subjects or patients with chronic ITP.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Five subjects (12%) in Study ELT112523 discontinued treatment with eltrombopag due to AEs (see 
table 22) 
As of the clinical cut-off date of 31 March 2014, no subject had discontinued eltrombopag due to an AE 
in either Study ELT116826 or Study ELT116643.

Post marketing experience 
Eltrombopag was first approved for marketing in the EU on 11 March 2010 for the treatment of 
thrombocytopaenia in patients with chronic immune ITP. Eltrombopag is now also approved in the EU 
for the treatment of patients with HCV. 
Based on latest data available from Intercontinental Medical Statistics Health data, it is estimated that 
approximately 35,612 patient years of eltrombopag treatment have been prescribed worldwide as of 
June 2014. This calculation is based on available sales information volume and assumes a once-daily 
dose of 12.5 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, or 75 mg tablets. 
As of 31 March 2014, 10,020 spontaneous and post-marketing AEs (serious and non-serious) have 
been received from the marketed use of eltrombopag (4458 cases). The most frequently reported AEs 
from spontaneous and post-marketing cases are provided in Table 36 and represent AEs reported at a 
1% or higher frequency. As of 31 March 2014, there were 769 cases with a fatal outcome out of the 
4458 cases reported from marketed usage of eltrombopag.  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database was limited to around 102 subjects with SAA studied in the clinical trials 
presented, with long term data limited to 36 patients followed for at least 6 months at submission. 
Only 12 (28%) patients from the pivotal study were enrolled for >6 months in the ELT112523 study, 
and only 9 (21%) >12 months. Given that the two main studies are ongoing and that a substantial 
proportion of patients will discontinue treatment before 6 months provided that no haematological 
response is achieved, safety data available are mostly short-term data. This is an important limitation 
of the current dossier. However, the rarity of the disease should be considered as well as the gained 
experience with eltrombopag in other indications which might provide some supportive safety 
information.  
In general, the profile of adverse events reported seems in line with the well -known safety profile of 
eltrombopag in the already licensed therapeutic indications and no new safety finding have been 
identified. High incidence of SAEs was reported in all clinical trials presented. However, the majority 
were not considered related to the study drug but to the underlying condition. Similarly, the number of 
death cases appears related to the underlying disease and are within the expected rates.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/598426/2015  
Page 40/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The 4 SAE in the ELT 112523 (febrile neutropenia, sepsis, deep vein thrombosis and orthostatic 
hypotension) that occurred in the post therapy study were deemed not related to eltrombopag 
treatment.  
Overall, 3 patients (7%) from Study ELT112523 were diagnosed of MSD following treatment with 
eltrombopag and 1 subject in Study ELT116643 also had MSD. This is a potential risk associated to 
eltrombopag use, which is still under evaluation in a number of studies (See RMP). In this particular 
case, it is difficult to judge if eltrombopag might have contributed given that this is an expected risk in 
SAA, and in particular in the refractory population. Similarly, the 8 subjects (19%) with cytogenetic 
abnormalities (5 affecting the chromosome 7) that occurred in Study ELT112523, the 2 patients in  
ELT116826 study and the 2 subjects of the ELT116643 study with cytogenetic abnormalities at the 3 
month  assessment time points might be of concern. The MAH argued that these data are in line with 
percentages published in the literature (15-20% according to Maciejewski 2002, Scheinberg 2011 and 
Scheinberg 2012) and that data from patients with insufficient response to ATG/CsA do not exist in the 
literature. The MAH has provided further evidence to substantiate that the percentage seen in these 
studies are truly within the expected in the general population with a refractory SAA disease. Given 
that >80% of subjects in the pivotal study had insufficient response to at least 2 ISTs, and the known 
increased risk of new cytogenetic abnormalities and the risk of development of MDS/AML in such 
heavily pre-treated patients, the 7% rate of MDS diagnosis and 19% rate of new cytogenetic 
abnormalities are consistent with the rates observed since the 1980’s with the underlying disease and 
natural history of SAA. However, the uncertainties on the long-term risk remain and this will be further 
investigated in two controlled planned studies. (see RMP). 
An update of the safety database has been provided (cut-off date January 2015). Across the 3 SAA 
studies included in this submission, a total of 133 subjects have been enrolled, nearly all have received 
the maximum dose of eltrombopag 150 mg. A total of 71 subjects with an insufficient response to 
immunosuppressive therapy have been treated with eltrombopag. Of these 71 subjects, 80% received 
eltrombopag for at least 3 months, 39% received eltrombopag for at least 6 months and nearly a 
quarter of the subjects (23%) received eltrombopag for at least 1 year. Therefore updated results 
were consistent in terms of the incidence of SAEs, cytogenetic abnormalities, and haematological 
malignancies- with the initial data. 
Examination of the safety data across the 2 studies conducted in subjects with an insufficient response 
to immunosuppressive therapy, showed similar rates of SAEs, detection of new cytogenetic 
abnormalities and diagnosis of MDS or AML. The proportion of subjects with SAEs in the ELT112523 
and ELT116826 studies were similar, 33% and 29%, respectively. The most common SAEs reported in 
both studies were consistent with that expected for the previously treated SAA patient population, 
primarily infections and febrile neutropenia. At baseline in both studies, 7% of subjects had a 
cytogenetic abnormality detected prior to treatment with eltrombopag. New cytogenetic abnormalities 
were detected in similar proportions in both studies (ELT112523, 19%; ELT116826, 14%).  
In summary, the safety profile across both studies in subjects with an insufficient response to 
immunosuppressive therapy was generally comparable in terms of overall exposure, SAEs and 
cytogenetic abnormalities. 
In the treatment naïve study (ELT116643) 42% of subjects had SAEs based on the clinical cut-off for 
this safety update, the majority of SAEs observed were febrile neutropenia or infectious complications. 
New cytogenetic abnormalities were reported in 6% of subjects in this trial.

No new safety issues were identified for the administration of eltrombopag in subjects with SAA 
following review of safety data collected from ongoing clinical studies ELT112523, ELT116826, and 
ELT116643 through 14 January 2015.   
In general, the assessment of safety of eltrombopag in the SAA population although hampered by the 
lack of a control arm and the overall limited database, is in line with the experience with eltrombopag 
in the currently approved indications. Final safety data from the supportive ongoing Study ELT116826 
will be submitted by last quarter 2018; Final report from study ELT116643 in 1st line SAA treatment 
will be provided in May 2016 (See RMP). 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, the safety and tolerability of eltrombopag appears acceptable, in this refractory and heavily 
pretreated population. No new or unexpected findings have been identified for eltrombopag based on 
the data presented.  Most of the AE and SAE identified are related to the underlying condition and are 
manageable in the clinical practice  
The long-term risk of cytogenetic abnormalities remains as a matter of concern which requires 
additional follow up at post-approval. The MAH will submit final safety data from the supportive 
ongoing Study ELT116826 by Q4 2018. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan

Eltrombopag should not be used in ITP patients 
with hepatic impairment (Child- Pugh score ≥ 5) 
unless the expected benefit outweighs the 
identified risk of portal venous thrombosis. 
If the use of eltrombopag is deemed necessary 
for ITP patients with hepatic impairment the 
starting dose must be 25 mg once daily. After 
initiating the dose of eltrombopag in patients 
with hepatic impairment wait 3 weeks before 
increasing the dose. 
No dose adjustment is required for 
thrombocytopenic patients with chronic HCV and 
mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score ≤ 6). 
Thrombocytopenic patients with chronic HCV 
should initiate eltrombopag at a dose of 25 mg 
once daily. After initiating the dose of 
eltrombopag in patients with hepatic impairment 
wait 2 weeks before increasing the dose. 
There is an increased risk for adverse events, 
including thromboembolic events, in 
thrombocytopenic patients with advanced chronic 
liver disease treated with eltrombopag, either in 
preparation for invasive procedures or in HCV 
patients undergoing antiviral therapy. 
The SmPC (Section 4.2 Posology) states 
the following: 
Renal impairment: No dose adjustment is 
necessary in patients with renal impairment. 
Patients with impaired renal function should use 
eltrombopag with caution and close monitoring, 
for example by testing serum creatinine and/or 
performing urine analysis. 
The SmPC (Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic 
properties) states the following: 
The majority of patients were HCV genotype 1

following: 
Revolade is indicated for adult chronic immune 
(idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) 
splenectomised patients who are refractory to 
other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, 
immunoglobulins). Revolade may be considered 
as second line treatment for adult non-
splenectomised patients where surgery is 
contraindicated. 
Revolade is indicated in adult patients with 
chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection for the 
treatment of thrombocytopenia, where the 
degree of thrombocytopenia prevents the 
initiation or limits the ability to maintain optimal 
interferon-based therapy (see section 5.1).

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
In the non-randomized, single-arm, open-label, Phase II study of eltrombopag in subjects with SAA 
and insufficient response after treatment with ATG/CsA (study ELT112523) haematologic response was 
achieved in 17 out of 43 subjects (40%) in at least 1 lineage (95% CI: 25-56%). One subject had a 
tri-lineage response, 3 subjects had bi-lineage responses, and the remaining 13 had a uni-lineage 
response at week 12. The majority of responders (65%) met platelet response criteria, followed by 
ANC and haemoglobin response criteria (47% and 18%, respectively).  
Fourteen of the 17 responders entered into the extension phase and a total of 7 subjects had 
improvements in more than 1 lineage following continuation of treatment such that a total of 9 
patients had tri-lineage or bi-lineage responses. Five out of 14 patients who entered the extension 
phase stopped treatment early due to AE, cytopenias or relapse (3 patients), while 9 were followed in 
the long term and maintained their best response; five of them despite tapering off and discontinuing 
eltrombopag according to the study protocol.  
In terms of transfusion requirements a total of 59% and 27% of patients became platelet and RBC 
transfusion independent, respectively (meaning free of transfusion during 28 days for platelet or 56 
days for RBC at any time during the treatment period). The median of days free of platelet or RBC 
transfusions were 287 days and 266 days, respectively in the 17 responder patients, respectively. Very 
preliminary results from the supportive Study ELT116826, an ongoing non-randomized, Phase II, 
single-arm, open-label study in refractory SAA subjects, show consistent results: hematologic response 
at 3-month was 46% (24 out of 60 patients) and at 6-month (PEP) was 52% (21 out of 60 patients). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The main evidence is provided by one pivotal study which was open label, single arm and single 
centre. However, the difficulties in conducting randomised controlled studies are acknowledged 
considering the rarity of the disease. To minimise the uncertainties surrounding single arm trials, a 
second supportive study is being conducted; preliminary results show consistent results and add 
robustness to the pivotal study.  
The effect on survival has not been determined and given the design of the study, where non-
responders at week 16 were withdrawn, no reliable estimation can be provided. However, considering 
available treatment options, results are considered overall clinically relevant. The impact on HRQoL 
was not properly evaluated beyond week 12 and data available are of little value to make any 
conclusion. Additional post authorisation efficacy data form the ongoing supportive study are expected 
to clarify these points (see RMP). 
No baseline predictors of response have been identified. However, appropriate stopping rules in order 
to avoid an unnecessary exposure in patients unlikely to respond despite continuing treatment have 
been included in the SmPC.   
Concerning the elderly population, limited experience exists over the age of 75 in SAA. The overall 
incidence of SAEs was somewhat higher to that reported in the overall population, but data are too 
limited (17 over 65 yrs, 2 over 75 yrs) to draw firm conclusion. No dose adjustment is considered 
needed. However, caution is recommended in the SmPC (Section 4.2) when using eltrombopag in 
elderly patients.

Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety of eltrombopag in severe aplastic anaemia was assessed in a single-arm, open-label trial 
(N=43) in which 12 patients (28 %) were treated for > 6 months and 9 patients (21 %) were treated 
for > 1 year. 
Across the 3 SAA studies included in this submission, a total of 133 subjects have been enrolled, 
nearly all have received the maximum dose of eltrombopag 150 mg. A total of 71 subjects with an 
insufficient response to immunosuppressive therapy have been treated with eltrombopag. Of these 71 
subjects, 80% received eltrombopag for at least 3 months, 39% received eltrombopag for at least 6 
months and nearly a quarter of the subjects (23%) received eltrombopag for at least 1 year. 
The most common AEs observed in Study ELT112523 largely reflect the well-known safety profile of 
eltrombopag and events expected in this patient population. Nausea, fatigue, cough, diarrhoea, and 
headache were the most common AEs, reported by ≥20% of subjects. Others like transaminases 
increases, pain in extremity, dyspnoea, pyrexia, febrile neutropenia, abdominal pain, ecchymosis, 
muscle spasms, abdominal pain, arthralgia and insomnia were also commonly reported. 
The most common SAE reported on-therapy was febrile neutropenia, followed by sepsis and viral 
infection. The percent of responders with infectious SAEs (3/17; 18%) was less than that in non-
responders (8/26; 30%) despite the shorter observation time for non-responders. Most subjects had 
recovered or were recovering from the SAE as of the data cut-off (09 May 2014), although 1 patient 
with aplasic anaemia and other with septic shock died. One subject had an SAE of abdominal 
discomfort that was considered related to treatment by the investigator. 
Consistent with the known occurrence of cytogenetic abnormalities in SAA, particularly in heavily pre-
treated patients, a 7% rate of MDS diagnosis and 19% rate of new cytogenetic abnormalities has been 
reported, which appears consistent with the rates observed since the 1980’s with the underlying 
disease and natural history of SAA. However, the uncertainties on the long-term risk remain and this 
will be further investigated in two controlled planned studies (see RMP). A relevant warning  has been 
added in the SmPC section 4.4. 
In clinical trials with eltrombopag in SAA, 4% of patients (5/133) were diagnosed with MDS. The 
median time to diagnosis was 3 months from the start of eltrombopag treatment. Appropriate 
warnings and recommendations on cytogenetics testing of SAA patients refractory to or heavily 
pretreated with prior immunosuppressive therapy, prior to initiation of eltrombopag, at 3 months of 
treatment and 6 months thereafter are included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The assessment of safety of eltrombopag in this population is hampered by the severity of the 
underlying condition, the lack of control arm and the overall limited database.  
The safety risks and particularly cytogenetic abnormalities will be further investigate this risk at post-
approval in two planned academic studies, within reasonable timelines (May 2019 and Dec 2020, see 
RMP).  
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
In the heavily pretreated patient population enrolled in ELT112523, where no established standard of 
care exists, a 40% response rate in at least 1 lineage was observed at week 12. Over time, responses

continued to improve and included multi-lineage responses in a total of 9 out of the 17 responders, 
which is around 20% of the overall treated population. In this small subset of patients responses were 
durable, with a median duration of response of 12 months among the evaluable subjects, and 
responses were associated with variable platelet and red blood cell transfusion free intervals, of over 
8-9 months. Tri-lineage responses have been maintained after discontinuation of eltrombopag in 6 
patients.  
Available results are clinically relevant even considering that the benefit will be limited to a small 
subset of patients that reached a haematological response maintained in the long term (40% in the 
short term, around 20% in the long term). Clinical relevance was substantiated by a reduction in 
transfusion requirements, bleeding events and infections.  
Preliminary results from the ongoing supportive study are consistent and add robustness to the results 
of the pivotal study.  
From a safety point of view, the safety profile of eltrombopag is well known. The limited data provided 
suggest that treatment was in general well tolerated with no unexpected safety findings. The safety 
profile of eltrombopag is considered well characterised and overall it seems a well-tolerated drug in 
this patient population, although data in SAA are limited. Uncertainties remain on the potential risk of 
inducing cytogenetic abnormalities/MDS progression, given that these are expected findings in the 
studied population, hence, difficult to address in the current open label studies. However, the MAH 
commits to further address this risk at post-approval in two planned studies. Although not fully 
powered, these studies will consistently and prospectively assess the risk for developing cytogenetic 
abnormalities and for MDS/AML progression under eltrombopag treatment.  
Benefit-risk balance 
The benefit in terms of haematological response observed in this heavily pretreated population clearly 
outweighs the well-known risks of eltrombopag treatment. Therefore, the benefit/risk for the use of  
Revolade in adult patients with acquired severe aplastic anaemia (SAA) who were either refractory to 
prior immunosuppressive therapy or heavily pretreated and are unsuitable for haematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation – is positive.  
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
Considering the rarity of the disease, the poor prognosis of subjects with refractory acquired SAA and 
the recognised unmet medical need, results from the two open label non comparative studies provide 
evidence of a clinically relevant effect in the treatment of adult patients with acquired severe aplastic 
anaemia (SAA) who were either refractory to prior treatments or heavily pretreated and are unsuitable 
for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.  The safety profile of eltrombopag in the treatment of 
SAA remains unchanged. However there remain some uncertainties on the potential risk of progression 
to MDS/cytogenetic abnormalities associated to eltrombopag treatment. Further investigations to 
address this concern will be conducted at post-approval. In the meantime, an appropriate warning will 
be included in the SmPC (Section 4.4).

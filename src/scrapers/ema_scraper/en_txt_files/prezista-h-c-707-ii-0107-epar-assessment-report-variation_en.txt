The Marketing Authorization Holder, Janssen-Cilag International NV, submitted a Type II Variation to 
extend the use of PREZISTA (darunavir) (800 mg) in combination with COBI (150 mg) for the treatment 
of HIV-1 infection in adolescents (aged 12 years and older with body weight at least 40 kg). 
The use of PREZISTA, in combination with cobicistat, in adolescent patients is supported by the results of 
Study GS-US-216-0128, in HIV-1 infected ART-experienced, virologically suppressed adolescent subjects 
taking darunavir (DRV) (800 mg) and cobicistat (COBI) (150 mg) as single components. 
The new proposed use is also in line with the approved use of COBI (150 mg) tablets (Tybost) in 
adolescents in the EU (EMEA/H/C/002572/II/0051) and with the approved use of the DRV/COBI 800/150 
mg fixed-dose combination (REZOLSTA) in adolescents in the EU (EMEA/H/C/002819/II/0033). 
Study GS-US-216-0128 was already assessed in above-mentioned procedures for Tybost and Rezolsta. 
Therefore, where applicable, the assessment of study GS-US-216-0128 done for Rezolsta is presented in 
this AR for Prezista. 
The application does not fall under the agreed PIP for PREZISTA (Decision P/138/2010, dated 30 July 
2010). The PIP was considered completed as indicated in the compliance statement (dated 9 December 
2011) and in the CHMP Opinion (dated 25 July 2013).  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP.

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
• 
Tabular overview of clinical studies  
Table 1: Tabulated Overview of Study GS-US-216-0128 
Prezista (darunavir) is available as oral suspension 100 mg/ml for this extension and as film-coated 
tablets of 400 and 800 mg. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The appropriateness of the combined use of DRV 800 mg and COBI 150 mg once daily in adolescents 
aged ≥12 years is confirmed by the results from the adolescent cohort of the ongoing Phase 2/3 Study 
GS-US-216-0128 in HIV-1 infected, ART-experienced, virologically suppressed children. Adolescents in 
this cohort received DRV (800 or 675 mg) plus COBI (150 mg once daily) in combination with 2 
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). 
2.3.2.1.  Main study GS-US-216-0128 
Study GS-US-216-0128 is an ongoing open-label, multicohort, two-part, Phase 2/3 study to evaluate the 
PK, safety, and efficacy of COBI-boosted atazanavir (ATV) or COBI-boosted DRV in treatment-
experienced, virologically suppressed, HIV-1 infected, pediatric subjects. Eligible subjects are on a stable 
ARV regimen including 2 NRTIs and either ATV/rtv once daily, or DRV/rtv once daily or twice daily as per 
product label for a minimum of 3 months prior to the Screening visit. The primary objectives of this study 
are to evaluate the steady-state PK and confirm the dose of ATV and COBI or DRV and COBI in HIV-1 
infected, antiretroviral treatment (ART)-experienced, virologically suppressed, pediatric subjects 3 
months to <18 years of age and to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of COBI-boosted ATV or

COBI-boosted DRV, each co-administered with a background regimen through 48 weeks in HIV-1 
infected, ART-experienced, virologically suppressed, pediatric subjects 3 months to <18 years of age. The 
secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and antiviral activity of long-term 
treatment with COBI-boosted ATV or COBI-boosted DRV, each co-administered with a background 
regimen, in HIV-1 infected, ART-experienced, virologically suppressed, pediatric subjects 3 months to 
<18 years of age. 
For the scope of this submission, only data from subjects receiving COBI-boosted DRV in Cohort 1 (≥12 
to <18 years of age) Part A (evaluating the steady-state PK and confirming the dose of DRV and COBI) 
will be discussed. 
Subjects and Methods 
A total of 8 treatment-experienced, virologically suppressed, HIV-1 infected, adolescent subjects (aged 
≥12 to <18 years and weighing ≥35 kg) were included in the DRV+COBI group in Cohort 1 Part A of the 
study. Subjects received the recommended dose of COBI for HIV-1 infected adults (150 mg once daily) in 
combination with approved doses for DRV based on body weight according to the applicable prescribing 
information (800 mg once daily [body weight ≥40 kg; N=7] or 675 mg once daily [body weight ≥30 kg to 
˂40 kg; N=1]), and a background regimen, for 48 weeks. For all subjects, the background regimen had 
to include 2 NRTIs. The background regimen could contain additional ARV agents except for the following 
disallowed agents: saquinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, double PI regimens, raltegravir, EVG, efavirenz, 
nevirapine, delavirdine, maraviroc, etravirine, rilpivirine, dolutegravir, and investigational ARV agents. 
An intensive PK evaluation was performed on Day -1 (for DRV) and Day 10 (for DRV and COBI) for 
subjects enrolled in Cohort 1 Part A. Pharmacokinetic blood samples were collected at pre-dose and up to 
12 hours post-dose on Day -1 (for DRV) and Day 10 (for DRV and COBI). Intensive PK blood samples 
were collected at pre-dose and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 12 hours post-dose on Day -1 (for ATV or DRV) and 
Day 10 (for ATV or DRV and COBI). The pre-dose (0 hours) concentration was also used as a surrogate 
for the concentration at the end of the dosing interval (24 hours) for the purpose of estimating AUCtau 
and Ctau. The primary PK endpoint was AUC from time of administration up to the end of the dosing 
interval (AUCtau) for DRV on Day 10. The secondary PK endpoints were plasma concentration at the end 
of the dosing interval (Ctau), Cmax, and apparent clearance (CL/F) for DRV, and AUCtau, Ctau, Cmax, 
CL/F, and apparent volume of distribution of the drug (Vz/F) for COBI on Day 10. 
To determine whether the exposure of DRV boosted by the adult dose of COBI (150 mg) in adolescents 
was similar to that in adults, statistical comparisons were performed to compare PK data from the current 
study with historical data in HIV-1 infected adults (adult comparator): 
• 
Intensive PK data (AUCtau, Ctau, and Cmax) from adults receiving COBI-boosted DRV in Study GS-
US-216-0130 (N=60). 
• 
Population PK data (AUCtau and Ctau) from adults receiving COBI-boosted DRV in Study GS-US-216-
0130 (N=298). 
In addition, exposures of DRV boosted by COBI in adolescents (on Day 10) were compared with those 
boosted by rtv (on Day -1) in the same pediatric subjects to confirm that exposures of boosted DRV with 
COBI were comparable to those approved in paediatrics with rtv. All subjects were receiving DRV boosted 
by COBI or rtv once daily at least 10 days prior to the intensive PK visits. 
Exposures of COBI were compared with historical data with COBI-boosted DRV from Study GS-US-216-
0130 (intensive PK data; N=60).

Bioanalytical Methods 
Plasma concentrations of DRV and COBI, as well as other ARVs were determined using validated liquid 
chromatographic - mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry methods. Details are provided in the respective 
clinical study reports (CSRs).  
DRV  was  analysed  using  analytical  method  QPS  42-0902,  validated  at  QPS  (Newark,  Delaware,  United 
States)  under  the  responsibility  of  Gilead  Sciences  Inc.  The  calibrated  range  for  DRV  was  20  to  10000 
ng/mL; the inter-run precision ranged from 3.4% to 8.7%; the inter-run accuracy ranged from -9.6% to -
0.3%. The QC concentrations were 60, 800 and 9000 ng/mL. 
COBI (GS-9350) was measured using analytical method QPS 60-1343, validated at QPS (Newark, Delaware, 
United States) under the responsibility of Gilead Sciences Inc. The calibrated range for COBI was 5 to 2500 
ng/mL; the inter-run precision ranged from 5.2% to 113.0%; the inter-run accuracy ranged from -5.8% to 
74.0%. The large precision and accuracy values are attributed to outliers for QC 15 and QC 100 in one run 
that appear to have been inadvertently switched. All QC data points from accepted runs were included in 
the statistical calculations. The QC concentrations were 15, 100, 1000 and 2000 ng/mL. 
Demographics - dosing 
Demographics of the 8 subjects included in the PK dataset are given in Table 11 (See section 2.4.1 Main 
Study). This table shows that mean body weight at baseline was 55 kg (min 37 kg; max 78 kg). One subject 
of the eight subjects included was weighing 37 kg (< 40 kg. male, 12-yr old) and received a DRV dose of 
600 mg (instead of the planned protocol dose of 675 mg), the others received a DRV dose 800 mg. At the 
time of enrolment, this subject weighing 37 kg was on a stable antiretroviral regimen including 2 nucleoside 
reverse  transcriptase  inhibitors  and  ritonavir-boosted  DRV  600  mg.  The  subject  was  able  to  maintain 
virologic suppression with the DRV 600 mg dose, and therefore the dose of DRV remained unchanged when 
the subject began on Study GS-US-216-0128. This subject’s data have been excluded from the primary 
statistical comparisons. 
From the 7 subjects receiving the 800 mg DRV dose, 1 subject was 16-yr old, 3 subjects were 15-yr old, 
two subjects were 14-yr old, and one subject was 12-yr old, which means the adolescent age range of 
12-18 yrs old was reasonably covered. 
Results: Pharmacokinetics of DRV 
All PK parameters were calculated using conventional non-compartmental methods using actual times of 
blood sampling. The mean (SD) steady-state plasma concentration vs time profile for DRV following 
administration of COBI-boosted DRV to virologically suppressed, HIV-1 infected adolescents ≥35 kg on 
Day 10 (N=8) is shown in Figure 1. Maximal plasma concentrations of DRV were achieved at 
approximately 4.50 hours post-dose (median tmax) (Table 2).

Table 3: DRV (Day 10, With COBI) CL/F (Study GS-US-216-0128 Cohort 1 Part A; Intensive PK 
Analysis Set for DRV)  
When compared with historical PK data for DRV administered as DRV+COBI 800/150 mg once daily in 
treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced, HIV-1 infected adults (Study GS-US-216-0130 PK 
substudy), DRV AUCtau and Cmax were similar, and the DRV Ctau was 29% lower, respectively, in 
adolescents receiving COBI-boosted DRV than in adults (Table 4). When compared with the overall adult 
population PK data for DRV in Study GS-US-216-0130, DRV AUCtau and Ctau were 20% and 61% lower, 
respectively, in adolescents receiving COBI-boosted DRV, and the geometric least-squares mean (GLSM) 
ratio and associated 90% CIs were outside the 70% to 143% boundaries (Table 4). 
The lower DRV exposures in adolescents relative to adults were not considered clinically relevant, as the 
DRV Ctau values in adolescents were within the overall range of those observed previously with COBI-
boosted DRV in adults. Importantly, the mean DRV Ctau was approximately 20-fold above the protein-
adjusted half-maximal effective concentration against wild-type HIV-1 virus (55 ng/mL) and no exposure-
efficacy relationship was observed for COBI-boosted DRV in the Phase 3 Study GS-US-216-0130 and 
Phase 3 D/C/F/TAF studies. Further, exposure-efficacy analyses of Phase 3 studies of rtv-boosted DRV 
demonstrated that a 50% reduction in DRV trough concentrations would not impact the mean predicted 
virological response.

Exposures of DRV boosted by COBI (on Day 10) in adolescents were also compared to those boosted by 
rtv (on Day -1) in the same group of subjects (Table 5). All subjects were receiving DRV boosted by COBI 
or rtv once daily at least 10 days prior to the intensive PK visits. The AUCtau and Ctau were 9% and 51% 
lower, respectively, with COBI relative to rtv. Darunavir Cmax was similar.

Results: Pharmacokinetics of COBI 
Steady-state PK parameters for COBI following the administration of DRV+COBI to virologically

The lower and upper bounds of the 95% CIs of CL/F and Vz/F relative to the geometric mean for COBI 
following administration of DRV+COBI were within the FDA-specified boundary of 60% to 140% (Table 
7).

Table 7: COBI CL/F and Vz/F (Study GS-US-216-0128 Cohort 1 Part A; Intensive PK Analysis 
Set for DRV) 
When compared with historical intensive PK data for COBI administered as DRV+COBI 800/150 mg once 
daily in treatment-naïve, and treatment-experienced, HIV-1 infected adults (Study GS-US-216-0130 
intensive PK sub-study; N=60), COBI AUCtau, Cmax and Ctau were 19%, 16% and 28% higher, 
respectively, in adolescents receiving DRV+COBI relative to adults (Table 8).  
The higher COBI exposures in adolescents relative to adults were not considered clinically relevant as 
they were within the overall range of exposures associated with robust PK boosting and safety established 
in the Rezolsta, Symtuza, Tybost, and Genvoya programs in adult and paediatric HIV patients. There was 
a large degree of variability in COBI Ctau in adolescents and adults, which reduced the precision of this 
estimate. This was attributed to the variability in the time of collection of the pre-dose PK sample at the 
intensive PK visit (collected approximately 8.5 to 28 hours post-dose; pre-dose samples were used as a 
surrogate for Ctau.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The appropriateness of the combined use of DRV 800 mg and COBI 150 mg once daily in adolescents 
aged ≥12 years is confirmed by the results from the adolescent cohort of the ongoing Phase 2/3 Study 
GS-US-216-0128 in HIV-1 infected, ART-experienced, virologically suppressed children. Adolescents in 
this cohort received DRV (800 or 675 mg) plus COBI (150 mg once daily) in combination with 2 
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). 
The applicant concluded that no clinically relevant differences in DRV 800 mg exposures with COBI 150 
mg once daily were observed in HIV-1 infected, virologically suppressed adolescents compared with 
adults, and also exposures of COBI were within the safe and efficacious ranges associated with robust PK 
boosting in the Rezolsta, Symtuza, Tybost, and Genvoya programs. The PK data support the use of COBI 
150 mg-boosted DRV (800 mg) in adolescents weighing at least 40 kg.  
In general, this conclusion was supported by the CHMP, as Table 4 shows that the PK parameters AUCtau, 
Cmax and Ctau for DRV were on average at the same level for the adolescents and adults using the 
intensive PK data. For COBI, Table 8 shows that AUCtau and Cmax were similar between adolescents and 
adults, only mean Ctau for the adolescents was 28% higher than for the adults, which means that the 
boosting effect is at least maintained in comparison to the adults. There are no safety issues expected 
with this exposure level. 
From the 7 subjects receiving the 800 mg DRV dose, 1 subject was 16-yr old, 3 subjects were 15-yr old, 
two subjects were 14-yr old and one subject was 12-yr old, which means the adolescent age range of 12-
18 yrs old was reasonably covered. 
In general, the precision of the PK parameter estimates AUC and Cmax were sufficient both for DRV and 
COBI, allowing conclusions to be drawn on the comparison with N=8 adolescent subjects and probably 
also ultimately when the group is reduced to 7 adolescents. There was a large degree of variability in 
Ctau both for DRV and COBI, but both in adolescents and adults, which reduced the precision of this 
estimate. This was attributed to the variability in the time of collection of the pre-dose PK sample at the 
intensive PK visit on Day 10 (collected approximately 8.5 to 28 hours after the previous dose on Day 9).  
CHMP noted that the adolescents PK parameters on Ctau tends to be inexplicably lower than in adults, 
but that might not have significant impact. 
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Results from study GS-US-216-0128 showed that the PK parameters AUCtau, Cmax and Ctau for DRV 
were on average at the same level for the adolescents and adults using the intensive PK data. For COBI it 
was shown that AUCtau and Cmax were similar between adolescents and adults, only mean Ctau for the 
adolescents was 28% higher than for the adults, which means that the boosting effect is at least 
maintained in comparison to the adults. There are no safety issues expected with this exposure level. 
Therefore, Prezista (darunavir) at a dose of 800 mg, co-administered with COBI 150 mg given once daily 
is appropriate for use in adolescents aged ≥12 years and weighing at least 40 kg.

boosted Darunavir (DRV/co), Administered with a Background Regimen (BR) in HIV-1 Infected, 
Treatment-Experienced, Virologically Suppressed Pediatric Subjects 
Methods 
This is an ongoing open-label, multicenter, multicohort, two-part study (Part A and B) evaluating the PK, 
safety, efficacy, and antiviral activity of ATV/co or DRV/co administered with a BR in HIV-1 infected 
treatment-experienced, virologically suppressed paediatric subjects. 
A total of approximately 100 paediatric subjects, ages 3 months to < 18 years, of either sex are being 
enrolled as follows: 
Part A: 
A minimum of 79 subjects are planned to be enrolled to evaluate the steady state PK and confirm the 
dose of ATV/co and DRV/co. Subjects are enrolled sequentially by cohort as follows: 
Table 9: Description of the cohorts classification for Study GS-US-216-0128 
Part B: 
A minimum of 21 additional subjects are planned to be enrolled in Part B to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, and efficacy of the ATV/co or DRV/co regimen. 
For all cohorts in Part B, additional subjects will be screened and initiated sequentially by each age cohort 
and protease inhibitor (PI), ATV or DRV, following confirmation of appropriate COBI exposure and PI 
exposures from the corresponding age cohort in Part A. 
In each cohort, if the minimum number of either ATV/co or DRV/co subjects complete their Day 10 
intensive PK visit before the other, then the data from that treatment may proceed to be analysed. Upon 
acceptable COBI and PI safety and PK data through Day 10, Part B of that cohort and Part A of the 
subsequent cohort will proceed to be opened for that treatment. Part A for the treatment that has not 
completed enrolment will remain open until the minimum number of subjects complete their Day 10 
intensive PK visit.

Objectives 
The primary objectives, related to DRV/co, of this ongoing study, are as follows: 
• 
To evaluate the steady-state PK and confirm the dose of DRV/co in HIV-1 infected, antiretroviral 
treatment-experienced, virologically suppressed paediatric subjects 3 months to < 18 years of 
age 
• 
To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of DRV/co, co-administered with a background 
regimen (BR) through 48 weeks in HIV-1 infected antiretroviral treatment-experienced 
virologically suppressed paediatric subjects 3 months to < 18 years of age 
The secondary objective, related to DRV/co, of this ongoing study, is as follows: 
• 
To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and antiviral activity of long-term treatment of DRV/co, co-
administered with a BR, in HIV-1 infected antiretroviral treatment-experienced virologically 
suppressed paediatric subjects 3 months to < 18 years of age 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The efficacy endpoints were: 
• 
The percentage of subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Weeks 24 and 48 using the US 
FDA-defined snapshot algorithm 
• 
The percentage of subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Weeks 12, 24, and 48, and every 
12 weeks after Week 48 based on Missing = Excluded [M = E] analysis 
• 
The change from baseline in CD4 cell count and percentage at Weeks 24 and 48, and every 12 
weeks after Week 48 
Safety assessments included monitoring of adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medications, clinical 
laboratory tests (including renal, hepatic, and fasting glucose and lipid parameters), physical 
examinations, Tanner stage assessments, and vital signs. 
Sample size 
A sample size of 8 evaluable DRV subjects provided at least 90% power to show that COBI-boosted DRV 
AUCtau in paediatric subjects was similar to AUCtau in adult subjects. For the above sample size 
computation, inter-subject standard deviations (natural log scale) of 0.3 h•ng/mL for DRV AUCtau (based 
on population PK data from 298 adult subjects in Study GS-US-216-0130) were used in the computation. 
It was assumed that equivalent assessments were to be conducted using two 1-sided t-tests each at 0.05 
alpha levels, and equivalence boundaries of 70% to 143 % were applied. 
A sample size of 8 evaluable DRV subjects also provided at least 78% power to target a 95% CI within 
60% and 140% of the geometric mean estimate of CL/F, assuming a %CV of 35.7% for DRV clearance 
(based on population PK data from Study GS-US-216-0130).

Blinding  
Not applicable since this is an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
Efficacy analyses used the Full Analysis Set (FAS) which included all subjects who received at least 1 dose 
of study drug. The proportions of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Weeks 24 and 48 
were evaluated using both the US FDA-defined snapshot algorithm and M = E analyses. The 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) for these percentages were constructed using the Clopper-Pearson Exact 
method. CD4 cell count and CD4% data, including change from baseline, were summarised using 
observed, on-treatment data (ie, data collected up to 1 day after permanent discontinuation of study drug 
or all available data for subjects who were still on study drug). 
Adverse event and clinical laboratory data were summarised using descriptive statistics. Adverse events 
were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Version 21.1. Tanner stage 
assessments were used to evaluate the onset and progression of pubertal changes. Body weight, body 
weight Z-score, height, and height Z-score were summarised.

Protocol deviations 
Table 10 provides information on important protocol deviations that occurred in subjects treated with 
DRV/COBI from Cohort 1 Part A. Protocol deviations were documented during routine monitoring visits.  
Among the 8 subjects treated with DRV/COBI from Cohort I Part A, 4 important protocol deviations have 
been noted in 3 subjects. None of these important protocol deviations affected the overall quality or 
interpretation of the study data.

Baseline data 
In the Safety Analysis Set for Cohort 1 Part A, most subjects (overall 63.6%) were male Table 11. Median 
age (range) in the DRV/co arm was 15 (12 to 16) years. The study enrolled a virologically suppressed, 
HIV-1 infected population, and all subjects in the Safety Analysis Set for DRV/co Cohort 1 Part A had 
baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL. The median (Q1, Q3) baseline CD4 cell count overall in the 
DRV/co group was 1069 (820, 1881) cells/μL, with 100% of subjects having a baseline CD4 cell count ≥ 
500 cells/µL. The mode of infection in all subjects was vertical transmission. At baseline, all subjects in 
the DRV/co arm were asymptomatic.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Extensions of indication to include adolescents for antiretroviral agents are primarily based on 
demonstration of comparable exposure in adolescents vs. adults, and a specific demonstration of antiviral 
efficacy in paediatric patients is not required, as it is stated in the EMA Guideline on the clinical 
development of medicinal products for the treatment of HIV infection.  
In this case, only information on Cohort 1 from study GS-US-216-0128, (subjects from 12 years to < 18 
years old, who received DRV/COBI)  was provided, as this is the data submitted in support of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/425517/2020

extension of indication for Prezista to include adolescents 12 to <18 years of age for the combination 
DRV/co. 
Efficacy endpoints were the percentage of subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Weeks 24 and 48 
using the US FDA-defined snapshot algorithm. 
Protocol amendment 4, describing DRV suspension as alternative options for subjects who were unable to 
swallow tablets and adding language around the potential for the use of dispersible tablets as an oral 
suspension for those who could not swallow tablets, is of interest, especially in light of the large tablet 
size.  
The applicant explained that protocol amendment 4 was installed to specify that DRV will be administered 
as either tablets or oral suspension depending upon the subject’s weight and ability to swallow tablets. 
This option was added in case a subject enrolled in the study and was already taking DRV suspension. A 
subject enrolled while taking darunavir tablet would not have been switched to the suspension. In Cohort 
1, Part A no subjects have taken DRV suspension since none were enrolled taking this formulation. 
Furthermore, no data on the acceptability of the DRV tablets was collected as this is not an objective of 
the study. 
Additionally, body weight is an important parameter, given that DRV dosing in children is weight-based. 
In children (including adolescents) ≥30 to <40 kg, a 675mg DRV dose is recommended, in contrast to the 
800 mg in the Rezolsta FDC tablet. In the current study, DRV and COBI were administered as single 
components, and dose adjustments based on weight were possible. Of note, one of the 8 patients in the 
DRV/co arm had a baseline body weight below 40 kg and hence received the 675 mg DRV dose (see PK 
session of this AR). The applicant was asked to provide the main efficacy and safety information for the 7 
subjects treated with DRV 800 mg + COBI 150 mg, i.e. remove the subject with the lower body weight of 
37 kg as this subject does not belong to the required age/body weight extension. Throughout the report, 
the updated information has been added to the originally provided information, where relevant. 
The ‘Other Reasons’ for which one of the subjects prematurely discontinued the study was withdrew 
consent (last dose was taken at Day38). The applicant clarified that the reason was that the subject’s 
guardian did not want to expose the subject to a non-Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved 
drug. 
The virologic success rate (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) at Week 48 in Study GS-US-216-0128 was 85.7% 
(6/7 subjects) using the FDA Snapshot Approach. 
2.4.3.  None of the subjects experienced protocol-defined virologic 
failure.Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In this small study, the overall efficacy was considered acceptable by the CHMP.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety results from the 7 adolescent subjects weighing ≥40 kg who received the DRV 800 mg dose in 
Study GS-US-216-0128 are presented. The subject weighed <40 kg at screening is not included in the 
analyses.

Patient exposure 
Six of the 7 subjects completed the 48 weeks of treatment. Median (Q1; Q3) exposure DRV (800 mg) and 
COBI (150 mg): 108.7 (49.3; 155.3) weeks. 
Adverse events 
Overall, AEs were reported for 7 (100%) subjects. Common AEs (≥2 [≥28.6%] subjects) were upper 
respiratory tract infection, cough, nasal congestion, myalgia, pharyngitis, vomiting, abdominal pain, 
headache, oropharyngeal pain, back pain, hyperlipidemia, nausea, post-traumatic stress disorder, and 
weight increased. Two (28.6%) subjects experienced study drug-related AEs: nausea and hyperlipidemia 
were reported for both subjects, decreased appetite was reported for 1 (14.3%) subject.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were no deaths. 
One (14.3%) subject experienced a grade 4 AE (reported as a serious adverse event [SAE]) of bipolar 
disorder. No other SAEs were reported. There was no SAE or grade 3/4 AE considered related to study 
drug.  
Laboratory findings 
Lipid-related Events 
Individual fasting metabolic laboratory parameters remained within normal ranges. Hyperlipidemia was 
reported as a grade 2 AE in 2 (28.6%) subjects and led to study drug discontinuation in 1 of the 2 
subjects.  
Renal Events 
Glomerular Function 
Serum creatinine mean and median values were increased at Day 10 and all other timepoints through 
Week 48, with eGFRcr values (based on serum creatinine using Schwartz formula) mirroring these 
changes. 
Changes from baseline in serum creatinine and eGFRcr were consistent with the inhibitory effect of COBI 
on renal tubular secretion of creatinine and are not considered reflective of changes in actual glomerular 
filtration rate based on the observed stable values of cystatin C. 
Other Events 
There were no noteworthy findings for the other events of interest. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
One subject had 2 AEs that led to premature study drug discontinuation: Grade 2 hyperlipidemia that 
started on Day 173 and was considered related to study drug by the investigator, and Grade 1 acanthosis 
nigricans that started on Day 222 and was considered unrelated to study drug. This subject also had an 
SAE of bipolar disorder. The last dose day was Day 614 and last study day was Day 629.

Post marketing experience 
Based on the total of 713,668,997 grams of DRV distributed (from launch to 31 December 2019), the 
estimated exposure is 24,257,590 person-months or 2,021,463 person-years.  
At the time of finalisation of this SCS addendum, 17 Periodic Benefit Risk Evaluation Reports/Periodic 
Safety Update Reports (PBRERs/PSURs) have been generated for DRV covering the period from 23 June 
2006 to 23 December 2019 and summarising the postmarketing safety data obtained by the applicant. 
These concluded that based on the review of nonclinical, clinical, epidemiologic information, scientific 
literature, and postmarketing data, DRV continues to demonstrate a favourable benefit-risk profile for its 
authorised indications. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety of DRV in adolescents has been assessed before and is described in the Prezista (DRV) product 
information. The conclusion of the available data at that time was that the overall safety profile of in 
paediatric patients aged 12 to < 18 years and weighing at least 40 kg was similar to that observed in the 
adult population. There is no indication from the available data that DRV or COBI affects pubertal 
development or growth in adolescents. 
One subject receiving DRV/co prematurely discontinued study drug due to an AE of hyperlipidemia, which 
was considered related to study drug by the investigator. Hyperlipidemia is a known AR with DRV/Cobi 
and is listed as ‘common’ in section 4.8 of the Prezista SmPC 
The current study is considered too small to draw meaningful conclusions regarding the safety profile. 
However, the available safety data from this study did not reveal safety concerns that would preclude it’s 
use in adolescents. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety of DRV in adolescents has been assessed before and is described in the Prezista (DRV) product 
information. The current study is considered too small to draw meaningful conclusions regarding the 
safety profile. However, the available safety data from this study did not reveal safety concerns that 
would preclude it’s use in adolescents. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version with this application (version 27.2).  
The (main) proposed RMP changes were the following: 
1.  Indication in the EEA broadened for PREZISTA co-administered with COBI from “adult patients” to 
“adults and adolescents (aged 12 years and older, weighing ≥40 kg)”. 
2.  The following safety concerns are removed in accordance with GVP V Rev 2:

experienced children >15 kg (DRV/rtv) is no longer considered missing information, the dose 
regimen follow-up questionnaire for DRV is removed from the pharmacovigilance plan. 
4.  As children <18 years of age (DRV/COBI) is no longer considered missing information, trial GS-
US-216-0128 is removed from the pharmacovigilance plan. 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 27.2 is acceptable.

Conclusion on the RMP 
The changes to the RMP (version 27.2) are acceptable to the PRAC and CHMP. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a result of this variation, the respective SmPCs are being updated as follows:  
For Prezista 100 mg/ml oral suspension, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 
For Prezista 75, 150 and 600 mg film-coated tablets, section 4.5  
For Prezista 400 and 800  mg film-coated tablets, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2. 
In addition, and in order to align the SmPC with recommendations for other HIV products, the MAH has 
also taken the opportunity to update section 4.2 of the SmPC with regards to the administration of 
Prezista in case of vomiting in all presentations. 
The Package Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly. 
Assessment report  
EMA/425517/2020 
Page 30/34 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Following Member States comments, the MAH updated the SmPC to delete of boceprevir and simeprivir in 
section 4.5, since both have been withdrawn from the EU market. In addition, the MAH was requested to 
update the DDI information on etravirine however, the MAH justified that the information was based on 
the information available on Intelence (etravirine) SmPC. This was endorsed by CHMP. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
• 
For PREZISTA, full user testing in compliance with the above-mentioned legislative requirements 
was performed on the initial patient leaflet for PREZISTA 300 mg filmcoated tablets (n=37 
participants)(procedure EMEA/H/C/000707, approved on 12 February 2007) and on the patient 
leaflets for PREZISTA 75 mg and 150 mg tablets for use in adolescents (in combination with 
ritonavir) (n=20 participants, ages 14 through 18 years of age were tested)(procedures 
EMEA/H/C/000707/X/20 and EMEA/H/C/000707/X/21, approved on 23 June 2009), 
• 
The proposed updated indication for PREZISTA, co-administered with cobicistat, is an extension of 
the target group of users (i.e. HIV-1 infected adults and paediatric subjects [≥12 to < 18 years 
of age, weighing at least 40 kg]). No new tablet strength or formulation, or new route of 
administration is proposed. 
•  Safety analyses from the study in adolescent subjects did not identify new safety concerns 
compared to the known safety profile of DRV and COBI. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The 2018 annual report from the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS on the global AIDS 
epidemic estimates that worldwide, approximately 160,000 (range: 110,000-260,000) children <15 years 
of age were newly infected with HIV-1 in 2017, down from 270,000 in 2010. An estimated 1.8 million 
adolescents (10-19 years) were living with HIV-1 in 2016 globally. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The aim of ART in children is to achieve undetectable HIV RNA levels, to provide a high barrier to 
resistance development, to maintain viral suppression, and thus to allow normal immune function, whilst 
minimising drug toxicities. 
Current paediatric and adolescent guidelines recommend the use of combination ART (cART) with at least 
3 drugs, usually a dual or triple nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) backbone together with 
either a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI) or a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor 
(NNRTI). Albeit not finalised yet, the 2019 PENTA summary guideline that has been out for public 
consultation recommends for children >12 years of age the use of DRV boosted with either ritonavir or 
cobicistat, or DTG as preferred 3rd agent, in combination with an ABC+3TC or TAF+FTC/3TC backbone. 
Assessment report  
EMA/425517/2020 
Page 31/34 
 
 
  
  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
For an extension of indication to include adolescents, similar exposure in adolescents vs. adults forms the 
basis of approval. As it is assumed that the PK/PD relation for a direct acting antiviral is roughly similar 
regardless of the age of the patient, the efficacy of a dose that yields sufficiently similar exposure in 
children, compared to adults, would be inferred. 
The applicant submitted the following study in support of the proposed use in HIV-1 infected adolescents 
(aged ≥12 to <18 years): 
GS-US-216-0128 (DRV 800 or 675 mg in combination with COBI 150 mg [as single agents] in n=8 ART-
experienced, virologically suppressed subjects). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Results from study GS-US-216-0128 showed that the PK parameters AUCtau, Cmax and Ctau for DRV 
were on average at the same level for the adolescents and adults using the intensive PK data. For COBI it 
was shown that AUCtau and Cmax were similar between adolescents and adults, only mean Ctau for the 
adolescents was 28% higher than for the adults, which means that the boosting effect is at least 
maintained in comparison to the adults. There are no safety issues expected with this exposure level.  
The virologic success rate (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) at Week 48 in Study GS-US-216-0128 was 85.7% 
(6/7 subjects) using the FDA Snapshot Approach. 
None of the subjects experienced protocol-defined virologic failure. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
It should be considered that conclusions on favourable effects were drawn from a very low number of 
subjects. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Two (28.6%) subjects experienced study drug-related AEs: nausea and hyperlipidemia were reported for 
both subjects, decreased appetite was reported for 1 (14.3%) subject. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Study GS-US-216-0128 included only 8 patients on DRV/co. Excluding the subject with body weight 
below the 40 kg cut-off, the total number of patients resulted in only 7. This is considered too small to 
draw meaningful conclusions regarding the Prezista safety profile. However, for darunavir it was already 
concluded that the safety profile in adolescents is comparable to that in adults.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
For extension of the indication to adolescents, it is important to show that exposure in adolescents is 
similar to adults. Further, the development of resistance mutations is important, which in turn may also 
have an impact on 2nd line ARV treatment options. As the target population are adolescents, potential 
effects on pubertal development or growth are also of importance. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
PK analyses show comparable drug exposure in adolescents and adults, which is further supported by the 
submitted efficacy data. Therefore, combining DRV and COBI at doses of 800 mg and 150 mg given once 
daily may be appropriate for use in adolescents aged ≥12 years and weighing at least40 kg. This should 
be balanced against the risk for development of resistance, which in the limited dataset available, seems 
to be acceptable.

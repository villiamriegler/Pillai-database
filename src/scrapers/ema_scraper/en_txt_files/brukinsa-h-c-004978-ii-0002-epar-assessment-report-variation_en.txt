2. Scientific discussion 
2.1. 
Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
The purpose of this submission is to support a type II variation application for zanubrutinib capsules as 
an oral therapy for the treatment of adult patients with marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) who have 
received ≥ 1 prior anti-CD20-based therapy. 
Disease or condition 
BRUKINSA as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with marginal zone 
lymphoma (MZL) who have received at least one-prior anti-CD20-based therapy. 
Epidemiology  
The median age at diagnosis varies between MZL subtypes, ranging from 50 to 69 years; overall, there 
is a higher incidence reported in men than in women (Sriskandarajah and Dearden 2017). MZLs 
comprise about 5% to 17% of all NHLs in adults, with MALT lymphoma as the most common subtype 
(50% to 70% of MZLs), followed by the splenic (20% of all MZLs) and nodal (10% of all MZLs) 
subtypes. 
Biologic features Aetiology and pathogenesis 
MZL is an indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) that originates from memory B lymphocytes 
normally present in the marginal zone of secondary lymphoid follicles within the spleen, lymph nodes, 
and mucosal lymphoid tissues (Kahl and Yang 2008). MZL is categorized by the World Health 
Organization into 3 distinct subtypes: extranodal MZL of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) or 
MALT lymphoma, nodal MZL, and splenic MZL.  
Extranodal MZL can occur at any site, with the stomach being the most common. Additional extranodal 
sites may include, but are not limited to, ocular adnexa, lung, skin, thyroid, and salivary glands. 
Extranodal MZLs are frequently associated with chronic inflammation and infectious agents that can 
give rise to chronic infections, such as Helicobacter pylori in gastric extranodal MZL, Chlamydophila 
psittaci in ocular adnexa extranodal MZL, Campylobacter jejuni in immunoproliferative small intestinal 
disease, and Borrelia burgdorferi in cutaneous extranodal MZL. Hepatitis C infection is associated with 
the occurrence of splenic MZL. Autoimmune conditions that may be associated with the development of 
MZLs include Sjögren syndrome, lymphoepithelial sialadenitis, and Hashimoto thyroiditis (Schreuder et 
al 2017). 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
See section above 
8 
 
Management 
There are no chemotherapy or immunotherapy products specifically approved for MZL in the European 
Union (EU) for patients with treatment-naive or relapsed/refractory (R/R) disease. Historically, very 
few prospective clinical trials have been conducted specifically in this patient population, and even 
fewer comparative, randomized trials have been carried out. Patients with MZL have been enroled and 
treated in clinical trials designed for patients with indolent NHL where the majority were patients with 
FL. 
Figure 1 
Source: Zucca et al., 2020.  
As is evident from the ESMO guideline recommendations, the primary treatment options depend on the 
subtype of MZL:  
Assessment report

Source: Zucca et al., 2020.  
The preferred therapy at relapse or progression, especially for nodal MZL, is not clearly defined and 
commonly approached with regimens used for other indolent NHLs such as follicular lymphoma (FL) 
(Zinzani 2012). 
For patients with recurrent disease and in need of systemic treatment, immunochemotherapy may be 
repeated if the first remission lasted at least 24 months. However, immunochemotherapy is associated 
with significant toxicity in these patients, especially in elderly patients and those with comorbidities. 
Moreover, data that suggest efficacy of these regimens are often based on a small subset of patients 
and/or retrospectively evaluated (Cheah et al 2019). 
Rituximab, although widely used for patients with R/R MZL (as monotherapy or in combination with 
chemotherapy), is only approved for patients with FL and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. 
Bendamustine is approved for indolent R/R NHLs, including MZL, as monotherapy in patients who have 
progressed during or within 6 months following treatment with rituximab or a rituximab containing 
regimen. 
Disease progression remains the cause of death for the majority of patients suffering from MZL 
(Olszewski et al 2013). There is an unmet medical need for effective and safe therapies to improve 
long-term outcomes.

2.1.2.  About the product 
Zanubrutinib (BRUKINSA; also known as BGB-3111) is a small molecule inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine 
kinase (BTK), which forms an irreversible covalent bond at Cys481 within the adenosine triphosphate 
binding pocket of the BTK protein. Zanubrutinib is highly potent against BTK; however, as opposed to 
ibrutinib, zanubrutinib has significantly less epithelial growth factor receptor, Janus kinase 3, tyrosine 
kinase expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma, and interleukin- 2-inducible T-cell kinase inhibitory 
activity, thus potentially reducing the side effects seen with ibrutinib and allowing increased exposure, 
which may translate into improved efficacy.  
Zanubrutinib capsules (80 mg/capsule), 160 mg orally twice a day. 
For the treatment of adult patients with Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia (WM), who have received 
at least one prior therapy, or as a first-line treatment for patients unsuitable for 
chemoimmunotherapy, the marketing authorisation application (MAA) for BRUKINSA obtained a 
positive opinion from the CHMP on 16 September 2021 and received approval from the European 
Commission on 22 November 2021. 
2.1.3. 
The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
No advice was sought or given for this indication.  
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP  
Statement from the Applicant regarding pivotal study BGB-3111-214: This study was conducted 
according to the principles of Good Clinical Practice as described in the International Council for 
Harmonisation guidelines, including the archiving of essential documents. 
2.2. 
 Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data except environmental risk assessment (ERA) studies have been submitted in 
this application, which is considered acceptable. 
2.2.1. 
Introduction 
In relation to the initial MAA, a Phase 1 environmental risk assessment was performed: 
The logKOW value of zanubrutinib is below 4.5 (i.e., 3.2 at pH 5, 3.6 at pH 7 and 3.7 at pH 9). Since, 
Log KOW > 3, bioconcentration factor (BCF) in fish study (OECD 305) is triggered. 
The Phase I PECSURFACEWATER of zanubrutinib (0.022 μg/L) was above the action limit of 0.01 μg/L using 
an Fpen of 0.00014, which was based on prevalence of Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia of 1.4 per 
1000 as stated in the orphan designation application. Furthermore, as there are no indications that 
zanubrutinib affects reproduction of vertebrate organisms at low exposure levels, the applicant 
committed to perform a standard Phase II environmental fate and effects assessment. 
Some of these studies were submitted with this variation.

This summary is written to support the type II variation application of zanubrutinib for the treatment of 
adult patients with relapsed/refractory marginal zone lymphoma (MZL). 
An environmental risk assessment (ERA) in the course of the initial MAA for treatment of Waldenström 
macroglobulinemia (WM) is ongoing, and BeiGene committed to provide the final ERA report by 
December 2022. 
The Phase I and Phase II Tier A assessments except for the fish early life stage toxicity test (OECD 
210) were completed, which triggered Phase II Tier B assessment for sediment and bioaccumulation, 
which has been initiated.  
All studies were conducted at) in accordance with organization for economic cooperation (OECD) 
guidelines and in compliance with the OECD principles of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP). The main 
study results are summarized in Table 1 below.

2.2.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The environmental risk assessment for Brukinsa is ongoing. All finalised studies were conducted at) in 
accordance with organization for economic cooperation (OECD) guidelines and in compliance with the 
OECD principles of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP). 
At this time, the following was concluded:  
1. 
Log KOW > 3, hence a bioconcentration factor (BCF) in fish study (OECD 305) was triggered. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Brukinsa was not considered to be bioaccumulative in fish. 
Brukinsa is not readily biodegradable (OECD 301B). 
A study based on Technical Guidance OECD 308 was referred to concluding that a Phase II Tier 
B assessment for sediment is triggered, but no report was submitted.  
Brukinsa is not a risk to microbial communities (OECD 209), algae (OECD 201) or daphnia 
(OECD 211), however a Fish early life cycle test did not provide a NOEC for larval growth of 
the fathead minnow (NOEC<0.017 mg/L, OECD 210). A new study is planned to be completed 
December 2022. 
5. 
In support of a Phase II Tier B assessment, a sediment-water Chironomid toxicity test (OECD 
218). At 289 mg/kg d.w. sediment emergence of midges was 5% of control. NOEC was 89 
mg/kg d.w. 
A final environmental risk assessment should include the ongoing studies and an updated 
PECSURFACEWATER with the new indication and will be submitted following a CHMP recommendation. 
2.2.4. 
Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The environmental risk assessment is still ongoing.  
In view of the ongoing development of the product the CHMP recommended that the final report, 
including studies to support Phase II tier B assessment and updated PECSURFACEWATER with the new 
indication, to be submitted by Q4 2022/ Q1 2023.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Introduction 
Specific to clinical development in MZL, efficacy data from patients with MZL are available from 2 
studies to support claims of efficacy of zanubrutinib in the intended indication: a Phase 2, open-label 
study of zanubrutinib in patients with relapsed or refractory MZL (Study BGB-3111-214) and a Phase 
1/2 study (BGB-3111-AU-003). 
The updated clinical pharmacology results include: 
• Non-compartmental analysis based on intensive PK data from Study BGB-3111-214 (N=11). 
• External model validation based on the observed PK data of patients with MZL (N=68) in Study BGB-
3111-214 indicated that the PK characteristics of zanubrutinib in patients with MZL are consistent with 
the data from the established population PK model (N=632) in patients with B-cell malignancies. 
• Exposure-efficacy analysis using pooled data from 2 studies (BGB-3111-AU-003 and BGB-3111-214) 
to understand the relationship between exposure and efficacy endpoints in patients with MZL. 
• Exposure-safety analysis using pooled data from 6 studies (BGB-3111-214, BGB-3111-AU-003, BGB-
3111-302, -206, -1002, and -205) to understand the relationship between exposure and safety 
endpoints in patients with B-cell lymphoma. 
• Results from Study BGB-3111-112, a Phase 1, open-label, fixed-sequence study to investigate the 
effect of CYP3A induction by steady-state rifabutin on the single-dose PK of zanubrutinib in healthy 
male subjects.

All patients received zanubrutinib at 160 mg orally twice daily (two 80-mg capsules orally twice daily), 
to be continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, treatment consent withdrawal, or 
study termination. 
Bioanalytical methods 
All bioanalytical methods for zanubrutinib PK analyses were based on high-performance liquid 
chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). These methods were fully validated to 
ensure accuracy, precision, selectivity, sensitivity, reproducibility, and stability. A description of the 
method used to quantify zanubrutinib in human plasma and urine samples is described in Module 2.7.1 
of the initial (WM) MAA. The lower limit of quantitation of zanubrutinib is 1.0 ng/mL.

The method validated by was modified by changing the model of the mass spectrometer from API 
4000 to API 6500 to measure zanubrutinib (BGB-3111) in human plasma from Study BGB-3111-214. 
The partial validation and cross-validation of this method (Interim Report No. 402599-202526-PMV) is

• Cycle 1 Day 1: predose (within 30 minutes prior to dose) and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 hours 
(± 15 minutes) postdose 
• Cycle 1 Day 28: predose (within 30 minutes prior to dose) and at 2 hours (± 15 minutes) 
postdose 
Sparse PK profiling: Blood samples were collected from all patients at all other study sites on 
• Cycle 1 Day 1: predose (within 30 minutes prior to dose), at 2 hours (± 15 minutes) 
postdose, and between 4 to 6 hours (before the patient was discharged from the clinic) 
postdose 
• Cycle 1 Day 28: predose (within 30 minutes prior to dose) and at 2 hours (± 15 minutes) 
postdose 
Pharmacokinetic analysis 
Actual collection times were used for the calculation of PK parameters. For intensive PK profiling, PK 
parameters such as Cmax, AUC0-∞, AUC0-t, and half-life and other appropriate PK parameters after 
single and multiple doses were derived using the standard noncompartmental method and were 
computed in WinNonlin® Enterprise Version 5.2 or higher. Estimates for these parameters were 
summarized (eg, n, mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, median, minimum, maximum, 
geometric mean, and geometric coefficient of variation). 
For intensive PK data, individual and mean plasma zanubrutinib concentration-time data were 
summarized and displayed in both tabular and graphical form. 
The following PK parameter estimates were planned.

Summary Statistics of PK-Exposure 
Eleven patients had intensive PK on Cycle 1 Day 1 following a single dose of zanubrutinib at 160 mg. 
Zanubrutinib was rapidly absorbed after oral administration and reached geometric mean Cmax at 294.7 
ng/mL, with a median tmax of 2 hours. Zanubrutinib was rapidly eliminated and the geometric mean 
of AUC0-6h was estimated as 819.9 ng•h/mL. 
As observed in other zanubrutinib PK studies in patients, zanubrutinib exposure was highly variable. 
Interpatient variability as shown by %GCV after single-dose administration was 40.8% for Cmax and 
45.8% for AUC0-6h.

Table 5 Summary of PK parameters of zanubrutinib following a single dose of 160 mg 
For a patient whose the plasma concentrations at predose and 0.5 hours postdose were 529 ng/mL 
and below the limit of quantitation, the bioanalysis of primary and backup tubes showed similar 
results; thus, the cause of this finding may have been because of an inadvertent switching of the 2 
blood collection tubes at predose and 0.5 hours postdose. The AUC0-6h was recalculated as 868.0 ± 
304.3 hour*ng/mL after switching the plasma concentrations at predose and 0.5 hours postdose; 
switching of the concentrations had a minimal impact on the descriptive statistics of PK parameters.

Dose justification 
The proposed dose regimen in patients with MZL is a 320 mg total daily dose (administered as 160 mg 
twice daily or 320 mg once daily). This is based on the totality of safety, efficacy, PK, and 
pharmacodynamic (BTK occupancy data) data from Study BGB 3111-AU-003, Study BGB 3111-1002, 
and Study BGB-3111-214. 
In Study BGB-3111-AU-003, at dosing regimens of 40, 80, 160, and 320 mg once daily and 160 mg 
twice daily, the maximum tolerated dose was not reached, and no dose-limiting toxicities were 
observed during the dose-escalation part of the study. Moreover, nearly full occupancy of BTK in 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was achieved in patients at all administered doses. The 
BTK occupancy in lymph node tissue was assessed at 160 mg BID and 320 mg once daily. At the 160 
mg twice daily dose, median BTK occupancy of 100% was observed at steady-state trough and 94% in 
the 320 mg once daily group. To maximize the inhibition in target tissues, the 160 mg twice daily dose 
has been used in Study BGB-3111-214 as well as in other ongoing Phase 2/3 clinical studies. The 
results of pivotal Phase 2 Study BGB-3111-214 provided the primary evidence of effectiveness in 
patients with MZL and supported the proposed zanubrutinib dose of 160 mg twice daily. 
In Study BGB-3111-AU-003, ORR was 100% (N=3/3) for the 320 mg once daily dose compared to 
76.5% (N=13/17) for the 160 mg twice daily dose. The CR rate was 33.3 % (N=1/3) for the 320 mg 
once daily dose compared to 17.6 % (N=3/17) for the 160 mg twice daily dose. Although the number 
of MZL patients treated at 320 mg once daily is limited relative to the number of patients at 160 mg 
twice daily dose, there is now extensive experience at the 160 mg twice daily and 320 mg once daily 
doses, with both schedules showing a high level of activity in patients with B-cell malignancies. 
Objective responses have been observed in patients with various B-cell malignancies (including CLL, 
MCL, WM, and FL) at all tested dose levels from 40 mg to 320 mg. Numerically comparable objective 
responses have been observed between once daily and twice daily regimens in patients with MCL and 
WM (Tam et al 2021). Furthermore, no remarkable differences were observed in adverse events 
between the 2 regimens in the safety population in Study BGB-3111-AU-003 (Ou et al 2021). 
Additional data support a 320 mg once daily regimen as an option in addition to the 160 mg twice daily 
regimen for patients with MZL. At the 320 mg once daily dose, a sustained and profound BTK inhibition 
in PBMCs and lymph node tissue were also observed. Given the same total daily dose (320 mg) and 
linear PK, similar exposure/AUC were achieved between the 320 mg once daily and 160 mg BID dose. 
E-R analysis indicated that there was no evident E-R relationship between PK exposure (AUC0-24, Cmax, 
or Cmin) and the safety endpoints (adverse events of interests). There were no significant relationships 
between zanubrutinib exposure and adverse events including cytopenias, infections, and bleeding. 
Higher Cmax observed with the 320 mg once daily dose was not associated with higher adverse event 
rates. In addition, E-R analysis in patients with MZL (Report BGB-3111-CP-009) and other B-cell 
malignancies including MCL (Report BGB-3111-CP-003) and WM (Report BGB-3111-CP-007) indicated 
that efficacy (ORR) does not appear to be significantly impacted by Cmax or Cmin, and therefore the 
same total daily dose and corresponding AUC delivered by the 320 mg once daily dose are expected to 
result in similar ORR as with the 160 mg BID dose. 
The totality of the data summarized here thus supports the recommended dose of a 320 mg total daily 
dose (as 160 mg BID or 320 mg once daily) in adult patients with MZL who had received ≥ 1 prior 
therapy. This is based on consistent and sustained BTK occupancy in PBMCs and target tissue, high 
rates of overall response in patients with relapsed or refractory MZL, and a favorable safety and 
tolerability profile.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Title of Study 
Study BGB-3111-112: A Phase 1, Open-label, Fixed-sequence Study to Investigate the Effect of the 
Moderate CYP3A Inducer Rifabutin on the Pharmacokinetics of Zanubrutinib in Healthy Male Subjects. 
Methods 
Study drug administration 
An overview of the study design is shown in Figure 3. 
All subjects received study drugs in a fixed sequence, as follows: 
• Day 1: Single oral dose of 320 mg zanubrutinib after an overnight fast of 8 to 10 hours 
• Days 3 to 10: Oral dose of 300 mg rifabutin once daily (QD) with food (standard meal) 
• Day 11: Single oral dose of 320 mg zanubrutinib and QD dose of 300 mg rifabutin after an 
overnight fast of 8 to 10 hours. 
Sampling 
On PK sampling days (Days 1 and 11), blood samples for analysis of plasma zanubrutinib were 
collected predose and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 36 hours postdose. The allowed sampling 
windows for PK blood samples were as follows: within 15 minutes prior to dosing for the predose 
sample timepoint; ± 5 minutes for sampling timepoints ≤12 hours; ± 30 minutes for sampling 
timepoint at 24 and 36 hours.

Results 
A total of 13 subjects were enrolled and were evaluable for PK analysis. 
Following the administration of 320 mg zanubrutinib alone on Day 1 and the coadministration with 300 
mg rifabutin on Day 11, median times of the maximum observed plasma concentration (tmax) of 1.50 
and 2.00 hours post-dose were observed, respectively. Systemic exposure to zanubrutinib was lower 
following the coadministration of 320 mg zanubrutinib with 300 mg rifabutin compared to the 
administration of 320 mg zanubrutinib alone, with a geometric mean area under the plasma 
concentration time curve (AUC) approximately 44% lower and maximum observed plasma 
concentration (Cmax) 48% lower. This represented a decreased exposure of 1.8-fold for AUC0-t and 
AUC0-∞, and 1.9-fold for Cmax when zanubrutinib was administered with a moderate CYP3A inducer.

There was a less than a 50% reduction of systemic exposures (AUC) of zanubrutinib following co-
administration of zanubrutinib with rifabutin, a moderate CYP3A inducer, compared to the 
administration of zanubrutinib alone. Thus, based on the emergent data from Study BGB-3111-112, a 
revision to the current dose recommendation for concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inducers is 
proposed; it is recommended that patients use caution with concomitant use of moderate CYP3A 
inducers. This updated recommendation is based on the totality of data, including (1) less than 50% 
decrease in zanubrutinib AUC for concurrent use of a moderate CYP3A inducer, (2) an efficacy signal at 
doses as low as 40 and 80 mg, (3) maximal BTK inhibition (median BTK occupancy of 100%) in PBMC 
samples starting at doses of 40 mg once a day, and (5) no identifiable E-R relationships for efficacy or 
safety endpoints. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Zanubrutinib is a second-generation oral BTK inhibitor that forms an irreversible covalent bond at 
Cys481 within the adenosine triphosphate binding pocket of the BTK protein. 
Primary pharmacology 
No new pharmacodynamic analyses pertaining to BTK occupancy have been conducted since the initial 
WM application. For the latter, “Pharmacodynamic (PD) analyses were performed in the Chinese phase 
1 study BGB-3111-1002 and in the global phase 1/2 study BGB-3111-AU-003 based on PD data from 
13 and 50 subjects, respectively. The primary PD endpoint was the BTK occupancy in peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs)” (Brukinsa EPAR).  
The number of lymph node samples included was low, 12 and 18 samples in patients with 320 mg QD 
and 160 mg BID dosing, respectively.  As per Figure 3 below, from the Applicant’s previously 
submitted Report BGB-3111-AU-003-PD-01, although data was very limited, there was no apparent 
association of lymph node BTK occupancy and tumour types, including MZL:.

2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
This type II variation submission contains an external validation of a previously developed population 
PK model, which was assessed during the MAA of Brukinsa. In this submission, the population PK 
model is mainly used in order to generate exposure estimates for the patients, which are then used in 
an exposure-response analysis. The exposure-response analysis is used as one argument to justify the 
dose, and as one argument to justify that no dose adjustments are necessary when zanubrutinib is 
coadministered with moderate CYP3A4 inducers. 
External validation of a previously developed population PK model 
An established population PK model using data from 632 subjects enrolled in 9 clinical studies in 
patients with B-cell malignancies and healthy volunteers (BGB-3111-103, BGB-3111-104, BGB-3111-
105, BGB-3111-106, BGB-3111-AU-003, BGB-3111-1002, BGB-3111-205, BGB-3111-206, and BGB-
3111-302) (Report BGB-3111-CP-008) was submitted in the initial MAA for WM. It featured a two-
compartment model with first-order elimination from the central compartment, and sequential zero-
order and first-order absorption of the drug. 
Baseline alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and health status were identified as significant covariates on 
CL/F. Health status was identified as a significant covariate on apparent volume of the central 
compartment (Vc/F). Race and body weight did not show a statistically significant impact on the PK of 
zanubrutinib. Other covariates including baseline age, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin, 
creatinine clearance (CRCL), sex, tumor type, and use of acid-reducing agents also did not 
demonstrate a statistically significant impact on the PK of zanubrutinib. 
The PK data in study BGB-3111-214 study were analyzed using the above-mentioned final 
zanubrutinib population PK model via an external validation approach. This study included PK data 
from a total of 68 subjects treated with zanubrutinib (160 mg twice daily) who had ≥1 measurable 
zanubrutinib PK sample post-dose.  
The following data records were removed from the analysis according to data exclusion rules.

Switched peak and trough concentration (n=4) 
Measurable concentrations with missing dosing time (n=3) 
Measurable concentrations were identified as outliers (n=5) 
As a result, the final external model validation dataset was comprised of 68 subjects, defined as 
validation subjects, contributing a total of 289 zanubrutinib concentrations for the external model 
validation. 
Predicted zanubrutinib plasma concentrations for the validation subjects were determined by fixing the 
parameters in the structural and variance model to the parameter estimates in the final population PK 
model using post-hoc Bayesian prediction. The predicted concentrations (PRED) were compared with 
the corresponding observed concentrations (DV). Prediction errors (PE) were calculated for each PRED 
and expressed as a percentage of DV for each data point as follows: 
Bias (mean prediction error [MPE]) was then calculated for each subject as follows: 
Precision (root mean squared prediction error [RMSE]), which describes the imprecision of the 
population predictions relative to the observed concentrations, were calculated from the square-root of 
the arithmetic mean of squared Pe values as follows: 
where DVij and PREDij represent the jth observed and predicted concentration in normal domain, 
respectively, for the ith subject. PEij represents the jth prediction error for the ith subject, and ni denotes 
number of observations for subject i. 
MPE and RMSE were computed for each subject, then t-test was used to check whether the MPE value 
across subjects was significantly different from zero at p<0.01 level. 
The mean bias in the population predictions for validation subjects was 16.4% with 95% confidence 
interval (CI) of (2.96%, 29.8%), which was not significantly different from zero (p value=0.0175). The 
mean imprecision was 73.2% (95% CI [62.5%, 83.9%]). The results suggested that the PopPK model 
well predicted zanubrutinib concentrations in the validation subjects. 
Goodness-of-fit analyses by standard sets of diagnostic plots, prediction-corrected visual predictive 
checks (pcVPCs), and numerical predictive checks (NPCs) were performed. The general goodness-of-fit 
plots for the zanubrutinib validation subjects are shown below. While there was a good concordance 
between individual predicted and observed concentrations, the population predictions well predicted 
the observed concentrations.  
26 
 
 
 
 
The pcVPC evaluated the ability of the model to reproduce the distribution of the PK data in validation 
subjects. A total of 1000 replicates of the studies were simulated using the observed covariates for 
each validation subject, the final PopPK model parameter estimates, the estimated subject specific 
random effects, and the residual error. The pcVPC plot showed that the model well predicted the 
central tendency of the observed PK concentrations.

Overall, the developed zanubrutinib population PK model was able to provide good predictions of 
zanubrutinib PK in Study BGB-3111-214. Hence, the Bayesian post-hoc individual PK parameter 
estimate was used to calculate the predicted PK exposures (AUCss, Cmax,ss, and Cmin,ss) for these 
subjects for E-R analysis. 
Exposure-response analyses 
To support dose recommendations, exposure-safety and exposure-efficacy relationships were 
evaluated in patients with B-cell malignancies receiving zanubrutinib monotherapy in clinical studies. 
The E-R relationship for efficacy endpoint of ORR with the Lugano classification was explored based on 
the data from studies BGB-3111-AU-003 in patients with MZL (N=17) and BGB-3111-214 (N=66). 
Efficacy data cutoff date was 18 January 2021 for BGB-3111-214 and 09 October 2020 for BGB 3111-
AU-003. Patients with both efficacy data and PK data were included in the efficacy analysis (N=83). 
Out of 83 subjects, 81 subjects were treated with 160 mg BID and 2 subjects were treated with 320 
mg QD. Two patients  in study BGB-3111-214 were excluded from the efficacy analysis because the 
central pathology results showed histologic transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. 
The E-R relationship was explored based on IRC-assessed objective response endpoint in patients with 
MZL enrolled in studies BGB-3111-AU-003 and BGB-3111-214. The median exposure values were 
similar between responders (N=59) and non-responders (N=24).  
The probability of response plots by quantiles of zanubrutinib exposure is shown below. The results 
indicated that there was no apparent relationship between IRC-assessed objective response and the 
model predicted AUC0-24,ss or Cmax,ss. However, an apparent exposure-response trend was 
observed between IRC-assessed objective response and the model predicted Cmin,ss.

To investigate the E-R relationship for ORR, the E-R logistic regression model for IRC assessed 
objective response with Cmax,ss, Cmin,ss and AUC0-24,ss were developed based on zanubrutinib 
treated patients in studies BGB-3111-214 and BGB-3111-AU-003. The diagnostic plots of the logistic 
regression model are shown in Figure 8. The logistic regression model results suggested that Cmax,ss, 
Cmin,ss, and AUC0-24,ss were not associated with the probability of OR in zanubrutinib treated 
patients (p value > 0.01).

The E-R relationship for safety endpoints was explored based on data from studies BGB- 3111-1002, 
BGB-3111-205, BGB-3111-206, BGB-3111-302, BGB-3111-AU-003, and BGB-3111-214. The selected 
safety endpoints of interest included: grade ≥3 neutropenia, grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia, grade ≥ 3 
anemia, grade ≥3 infections/infestations, all events of secondary primary malignancies, all events of 
atrial fibrillation and flutter, major bleeding events, any bleeding events, and AE leading to treatment 
discontinuation.  
No apparent E-R relationship was observed for grade ≥ 3 neutropenia; grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia; 
grade ≥ 3 anemia; grade ≥ 3 infections/infestations; all events of secondary primary malignancies; all 
events of atrial fibrillation and flutter; major bleeding events; any bleeding events; and AE leading to 
treatment discontinuation, based on zanubrutinib treated patients in studies BGB-3111-1002, BGB-
3111-205, BGB-3111-206, BGB-3111- 302, BGB-3111-AU-003 and BGB-3111-214. 
The exposure-safety analyses included figures of AUC0-24h,ss Cmax,ss and Cmin,ss stratified by AEs 
(Grade ≥3 neutropenia, Grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia, Grade ≥3 anemia, Grade ≥3 
infections/infestations, all events of secondary primary malignancies, all events of atrial fibrillation and 
30 
 
 
flutter, major bleeding events, any bleeding events) and figures of probability of AE as a function of 
exposure markers. The figures are not copied to this AR for reasons of conciseness. All of the figures 
were highly similar to the exposure-safety analyses presented in the original MAA, since the exposure-
safety dataset is a combination of previously generated safety data and the newly generated safety 
data, with the newly presented data being only a small fraction of the total exposure-safety dataset. As 
such, it is natural that no major changes can be seen in the exposure-safety profile in this updated 
analysis.  
As a new safety endpoint, not included in the exposure-safety analyses presented in the original MAA, 
the relationship between AE leading to treatment discontinuation and exposure was also investigated. 
No exposure-safety trend was detected. 
To summarize, no new exposure-safety signals have been found. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Zanubrutinib is a Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor approved in the EU for treatment of adult 
patients with Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia (WM) who have received at least one prior therapy, 
or in first line treatment for patients unsuitable for chemo-immunotherapy. 
The present type II variation submission concerns approval of zanubrutinib as monotherapy for 
treatment of adult patients with marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) who have received at least one-prior 
anti-CD20-based therapy. The current application’s clinical pharmacology package includes data from a 
Phase 2, open-label study of zanubrutinib in patients with relapsed or refractory MZL (Study BGB-
3111-214), a Phase 1/2 study (BGB-3111-AU-003) and a clinical DDI study (BGB-3111-112). The 
ADME characteristics were described in the original WM marketing application and no changes have 
been proposed to SmPC section 5.2. 
In principle, no new bioanalytical methods were applied for detection of zanubrutinib in human plasma, 
except that a new mass spectrometer was implemented by partial validation during the course of the 
BGB-3111-214 study. This study included a successful incurred sample reproducibility test (ISR). The 
clinical DDI study (BGB-3111-112) also included an ISR evaluation, which passed. Bioanalysis for the -
214 study was conducted at and the -112 study at. The bioanalytical method underwent a full 
validation at both sites.  
The current submission contains an external validation of a previously developed population PK model, 
which was assessed during the MAA of Brukinsa. In this submission, the population PK model is mainly 
used in order to generate exposure estimates for the patients, which are then used in an exposure-
response analysis. The exposure-response analysis is used as one argument to justify the dose, and as 
one argument to justify that no dose adjustments are necessary when zanubrutinib is co-administered 
with moderate CYP3A4 inducers. 
The MAH has calculated mean prediction error and root mean square error to quantify model prediction 
accuracy and precision. The MAH states that Bayesian post-hoc individual predictions were used. If this 
is true, then the value PREDij is based on Empirical Bayesian predictions, given the individuals data, 
i.e. it corresponds to the term “IPRED” typically used in NONMEM vocabulary.  
So, prediction errors are calculated on the basis of individual predictions. This is problematic for a 
number of reasons.  
First, in the case of a high number of observations for a given individual, the individual data will 
predominate the population PK model in the fitting of the individual parameters; shrinkage of Empirical 
Bayes Estimates of random effects will be very low; the result will be an MPEi of approximately zero for 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/896485/2022  
Page 31/124 
 
 
 
the individual with high number of observations, even if the population PK model itself predicts badly. 
The diagnostic defined by the MAH will be unable to detect potential model misspecification in this 
scenario.  
Second, in the case when there are only few observations for a given individual, a high shrinkage of 
Empirical Bayes Estimates of random effects will occur, and the individual PK parameters will be close 
to those predicted by the population PK model. In this case, a more variability in the MPEi value will 
most likely result. So the variability in MPEi will depend on the number of observations for the 
individual. 
Third, using a t-test to check whether the MPE value across subjects was significantly different from 
zero at p<0.01 level, completely ignores the aspect that the MPEi values may be informed by a 
variable number of individual PK observations, e.g. one individual may have 6 PK observations and 
another individual only one PK observation, yet the t-test will not take this into account in any way.  
Fourth, the population PK model contains a combination of additive and proportional residual error. As 
such, it is expected that the relative differences between observations and individual predictions are 
higher at low concentrations. Thus, the concept of calculating PEij as a relative difference between 
observations and individual predictions is flawed.  
All of these problems would have been avoided just by using appropriate residuals, such as the 
conditional weighted residuals (ref: https://doi.org/10.1007/s11095-007-9361-x), which do 
automatically take into account the uncertainty in measurement, between-occasion variability, 
between-subject variability, residual error model, and the number and timing of observations for each 
subject. A t-test of CWRES being different from zero could then have been used.  
However, even though these diagnostics are not considered acceptable, The MAH has included several 
other diagnostics to support the external validation. It is possible to use these other diagnostics to 
evaluate the population PK model external validation. For this reason, no issues are raised. 
No major discrepancies are seen the goodness-of-fit plots; the plots do therefore support the external 
validation of the previously developed population PK model.  
The prediction-corrected VPC suggests no major discrepancies between the previous population PK 
model and the newly generated PK data, therefore supporting the external validation.  
The population PK report also demonstrated that no new covariates can be identified from the newly 
generated PK data. Given that the original population PK model included 632 subjects with some 
subjects having densely sampled PK data, it is not surprising that no new covariates could be identified 
on the basis of 68 subjects with sparse PK sampling.  
Within the exposure-response analyses, a potential exposure-response trend was detected, with 
Cmin,ss as a potential predictor of response probability. However, when this relationship was tested in 
a logistic regression model, the trend was not statistically significant. The MAH states p>0.01, and 
from the relevant results, the exact p-value for the slope being different from zero is 0.113, i.e. 
insignificant. 
The exposure-safety analyses included figures of AUC0-24h,ss Cmax,ss and Cmin,ss stratified by AEs 
(Grade ≥3 neutropenia, Grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia, Grade ≥3 anemia, Grade ≥3 
infections/infestations, all events of secondary primary malignancies, all events of atrial fibrillation and 
flutter, major bleeding events, any bleeding events) and figures of probability of AE as a function of 
exposure markers. All of the figures were highly similar to the exposure-safety analyses presented in 
the original MAA, since the exposure-safety dataset is a combination of previously generated safety 
data and the newly generated safety data, with the newly presented data being only a small fraction of 
32 
 
the total exposure-safety dataset. As such, it is natural that no major changes can be seen in the 
exposure-safety profile in this updated analysis.  
As a new safety endpoint, not included in the exposure-safety analyses presented in the original MAA, 
the relationship between AE leading to treatment discontinuation and exposure was also investigated. 
No exposure-safety trend was detected. 
To summarize, no new exposure-safety signals have been found.  
The MAH uses the lack of observable exposure-response relationship to justify the dose. It is 
acknowledged that nothing in the presented data suggests that the dose should be changed, however 
also noting that the low number of observations and the relatively narrow range of exposures do not 
provide much statistical power for the analysis. As such, while the presented data do not show any 
signs that the dose is suboptimal, from an exposure-response perspective it is also not possible to 
indisputably show that the proposed dose is optimal with the current exposure-response data. Overall, 
based on the efficacy, safety and PK results observed, the selected dose regimen of 320 mg total daily 
dose, identical to the currently approved posology for WM (administered as 160 mg twice daily or 320 
mg once daily) is considered acceptable. 
The Applicant has submitted a clinical DDI study (BGB-3111-112) of zanubrutinib co-administered with 
the moderate CYP3A inducer rifabutin. Rifabutin was found to decrease average zanubrutinib exposure 
by nearly half, with a geometric mean AUC approximately 44% lower and Cmax 48% lower. Based on 
these results, the Applicant proposes to revise the current SmPC recommendation to avoid 
concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inducers, suggesting that moderate CYP3A inducers may instead 
“be used with caution” during zanubrutinib treatment. However, results of Study BGB-3111-112 
became available and were assessed during the initial Brukinsa EU MAA, no new clinical efficacy data 
has been provided by the Applicant pertaining to zanubrutinib dosing regimens below 320 mg daily, 
and data on BTK receptor occupancy in target tissues below the current recommended total daily dose 
of 320 mg are likewise lacking. The lack of observable exposure-response and exposure-safety 
relationships is also used as one argument to justify that no dose adjustments are needed in the 
presence of moderate CYP3A4 inducers. This argument cannot be wholly agreed with. While it is 
agreed that a 50% reduction in exposure in the median patient would not likely result in appreciable 
change in probability of response, no predictions can be made on the basis of the model for the effect 
of 50% exposure reduction in patients who are on the lower end of the exposure range after 160mg 
BID or 320mg QD dose. Thus, the exposure-response and exposure-safety alone are not adequate to 
justify that no zanubrutinib dose adjustments are needed in the presence of moderate CYP3A4 
inducers, and the concern that average decreased zanubrutinib exposure in the order of 50% may 
result in decreased efficacy remains. Accordingly, changes to SmPC recommendations regarding co-
administration of zanubrutinib with moderate CYP3A inducers with the addition of the MZL indication 
are not supported, the currently approved SmPC recommendations to avoid concomitant use of 
moderate CYP3A inducers was maintained. 
2.3.6. 
Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacology package included in the current application includes data from a Phase 2, open-
label study of zanubrutinib in patients with relapsed or refractory MZL (Study BGB-3111-214), a Phase 
1/2 study (BGB-3111-AU-003) and a clinical DDI study (BGB-3111-112). The population PK model and 
the exposure-response and exposure-safety analyses support the proposed dose. Based on data 
submitted with the initial (WM) EU MAA, the two proposed dose regimens, 160 mg twice daily and 
320 mg once daily, were found to give comparable exposure (AUC), and the same posology for the 
MZL indication is considered acceptable based on the efficacy, safety and PK results provided with the 
Assessment report

current application. Moreover, the exposure-response analyses provide support that zanubrutinib 
efficacy in the median patient is unlikely to be compromised in the presence of moderate CYP3A4 
inducers. However, no reliable predictions from the exposure-response model can be made for those 
patients who are on the lower end of the exposure range resulting from 160 mg BID or 320 mg QD 
dose; the SmPC wordings recommend to avoid concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inducers.

Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
See Dose justification the Pharmacokinetics section. 
The proposed dose regimen in patients with MZL is a 320 mg total daily dose (administered as 160 mg 
twice daily or 320 mg once daily). This is based on the totality of safety, efficacy, PK and 
pharmacodynamics (BTK occupancy data) results from study BGB-3111-AU-003, study BGB-3111-
1002, and study BGB-3111-214. 
The BTK occupancy in lymph node tissue was assessed at 160 mg twice daily and 320 mg once daily. 
At the 160 mg twice daily dose, median BTK occupancy of 100% was observed at steady-state trough 
and 94% in the 320 mg once daily group (Module 2.7.2 in initial Marketing Authorisation Application 
for Waldenström macroglobulinemia [WM], Section 3.3). To maximize the inhibition in target tissues, 
the 160 mg twice daily dose has been used in study BGB-3111-214 as well as other ongoing Phase 2/3 
clinical studies. The results of pivotal Phase 2 study BGB-3111-214 provided the primary evidence of 
effectiveness in patients with MZL and supported the proposed zanubrutinib dose of 160 mg twice 
daily. 
2.4.2.  Main study 
Study BGB-3111-214:  
Study BGB-3111-214 is an ongoing Phase 2, single-arm, multicentre, open-label study designed to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of zanubrutinib in patients with R/R MZL who have received ≥ 1 prior 
anti-CD20-based regimen. The study was composed of an initial screening phase (up to 35 days), a 
single-arm treatment phase, and a follow-up phase. Sixty-eight patients (65 planned) were enrolled in 
the study and received zanubrutinib 160 mg orally twice daily in repeated 28-day cycles. Treatment 
with zanubrutinib was continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, withdrawal of 
consent, or study termination by BeiGene. Patients were monitored for safety until 30 days after the 
last dose of study drug. The data cutoff date was 18 January 2021 for inclusion of study data in the 
efficacy summary.  
The MAH has provided updated patient disposition and efficacy results with a cutoff date of 04 May 
2022 (approximately 15 months of additional follow-up efficacy data).

Study BGB-3111-AU-003:  
Part 1 – Dose Escalation 
Patients with a WHO-defined relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoid malignancy—with the exception of 
Burkitt’s lymphoma/leukemia, plasma cell myeloma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, lymphoblastic 
lymphoma, and plasmablastic lymphoma—were enrolled in Part 1 of the study. Part 1 followed a 
modified 3+3 dose-escalation scheme, and the initial planned enrollment was 20 patients. The starting 
dose of zanubrutinib was 40 mg once daily. 
Part 2 – Expansion 
Part 2 of the study had 13 disease- or patient-specific cohorts (ie, 2a through 2m) with planned 
enrollment of 380 patients in total. Enrollment to individual cohorts was generally conducted in parallel 
with the exception of Cohort 2g (relapsed or refractory MCL), which was initiated after enrollment in 
Cohort 2a was complete. The recommended Phase 2 dose of zanubrutinib for evaluation in Part 2 was

determined to be 320 mg administered once daily or 160 mg twice daily but was modified coincident 
with Protocol Version 6 (09 September 2016) to 160 mg twice daily exclusively, for all subsequent 
patients enrolled to Part 2. Under Version 6 (09 September 2016), patients enrolled to Cohort 2a and 
Cohorts 2e through 2j who were receiving zanubrutinib 320 mg once daily had the option to switch to 
160 mg twice daily. 
Title of Study 
Study BGB-3111-214: A Phase 2, Open-label Study of Zanubrutinib (BGB-3111) in Patients with 
Relapsed or Refractory Marginal Zone Lymphoma. 
Supportive Study BGB-3111-AU-003: A Phase 1/2, Open-Label, Multiple-Dose, Dose-Escalation and 
Expansion Study to Investigate the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of the BTK Inhibitor BGB-3111 in 
Patients With B-Cell Lymphoid Malignancies. 
Methods 
Study participants 
Men and women 18 years or older with histologically confirmed MZL including splenic, nodal, and 
extranodal subtypes and have received at least 1 or more prior lines of therapy, including at least 1 
CD20-directed regimen (either as monotherapy or as chemoimmunotherapy), with documented failure 
to achieve at least PR or documented progressive disease after the most recent systemic treatment. 
Eligible patients were required to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status 
(ECOG PS) score of 0 to 2, measurable disease, adequate organ function based on pre-defined 
laboratory parameters, and a life expectancy of ≥ 6 months. 
Patients who had central nervous system involvement, prior treatment with a BTK inhibitor, clinically 
significant cardiovascular disease, active infections requiring systemic therapy, HIV, active hepatitis B 
or C infections; or major surgery within 4 weeks of the first dose of study drug were not eligible for the 
study.  
Treatments 
Patients received zanubrutinib 160 mg orally twice daily continued until disease progression, 
unacceptable toxicity, treatment consent withdrawal, or study termination. Patients who discontinued 
study drug due to reasons other than disease progression remained on study and continued with 
regular disease assessments including imaging studies until documented disease progression, 
withdrawal of consent, initiation of new anticancer therapy, death, or study closure.

Table 8 Dose modifications for haematological toxicities 
Dose Modifications for Non-Hematologic Toxicity 
For non-hematologic toxicities Grade 3 or higher suspected to be treatment related (other than 
hypertension adequately controlled with oral medication or asymptomatic laboratory events), study 
drug was to be withheld until recovery to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline, and then restarted at the original 
dose level. Note that laboratory abnormalities indicative of liver or kidney dysfunction were not 
considered asymptomatic. In this study, asymptomatic lymphocytosis, whether related to study drug 
or not, was not reported as a toxicity; patients were to continue study drug without dose modification 
or treatment interruption as well as all study-related procedures. 
If the event reoccurred at Grade 3 or higher severity, study drug was to be withheld until recovery to 
≤ Grade 1 or baseline and restarted at dose level -1 (80 mg twice daily). In the event of a second, 
Grade 3 or higher occurrence of the event at dose level -1, drug was to be withheld until recovery to ≤ 
Grade 1 or baseline and restarted at level -2 (80 mg once daily). A third occurrence of the event at 
Grade 3 or higher after 2 dose reductions required study drug discontinuation. 
For patients experiencing Grade 3 or higher atrial fibrillation that was symptomatic and/or incompletely 
controlled, study drug may have been restarted at either the original dose or dose level -1 per 
discretion of the investigator, after the atrial fibrillation was adequately controlled. Study drug was to 
be permanently discontinued for any intracranial hemorrhage.

Overall response rate (ORR) is the proportion of patients whose best overall response was 
complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). 
CR rate is the proportion of patients whose best overall response was CR. 
Duration of response (DOR) is the time from the date of earliest response (CR or PR) to the 
date of first documented progressive disease or death from any cause, whichever occurred 
first. 
Progression-free survival (PFS) is the time from initiation of zanubrutinib to the date of first 
documented progressive disease or death from any cause. 
Time to response (TTR) is the time from initiation of zanubrutinib to the date of first 
documented response (CR or PR). 
Time to treatment failure (TTF) is the time from initiation of zanubrutinib to discontinuation of 
study drug for any reason. 
Time to next line of therapy is the time (months) from the first dose of zanubrutinib to the 
start of the first new therapy for MZL. 
Overall survival is the time from initiation of zanubrutinib to the date of death from any cause. 
Table 9 Efficacy objectives and endpoints

For ORR, CR rate, DOR, PFS, and TTR, the primary analyses were performed according to the Lugano 
Classification (Cheson et al 2014). Patients with Independent Review Committee (IRC)-confirmed non-
fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid disease were evaluated using the computed tomography (CT)-based 
criteria. Patients with IRC-confirmed FDG-avid disease who have both pre-treatment and postbaseline 
positron emission tomography (PET) scans were evaluated using the PET-based criteria. Measures 
were employed to ensure consistent and objective response assessment by the IRC. In patients with 
IRC-confirmed FDG-avid disease, target and nontarget lesions selected by the IRC must have been 
FDG-avid to ensure adequate and consistent evaluation of the tracked lesions. In addition, patients 
with histologic evidence of bone marrow and/or gastrointestinal (GI) tract involvement at baseline 
were required to have repeated bone marrow testing and/or endoscopy regardless of PET status to 
confirm CR. Response was downgraded to PR if no repeated testing was done or if retest showed 
persistent involvement of bone marrow and/or GI tract.

Sample size 
Assuming a null hypothesized ORR of 30%, a sample size of 65 patients will provide 82% power for the 
alternative hypothesized ORR of 48%, at a 1-sided alpha level of 0.025 and using the exact binomial 
test. The alternative ORR is based on the observed IRC-assessed ORR for the ibrutinib study in R/R 
MZL (Noy et al 2017). For an observed ORR of 48% (31/65), the 95% exact binomial confidence 
interval is (35%, 60%). 
Randomisation 
This is a single-arm study. 
Blinding (masking) 
BGB-3111-214 is an ongoing open-label, single-arm, multicenter Phase 2 study of zanubrutinib in 
patients with MZL who were relapsed or refractory after ≥ 1 prior anti-CD20-based regimen. Efficacy 
outcomes were evaluated by an Independent Review Committee in accordance with the Lugano 
classification. 
Statistical methods 
Efficacy analysis sets 
The Safety Analysis Set included all patients who were enrolled and received at least 1 dose of study 
drug. Summaries of safety, important protocol deviations, demographics and other baseline 
characteristics, disease history and characteristics, prior anticancer therapies, and medical history 
were performed using the Safety Analysis Set. 
The Efficacy Analysis Set consisted of all patients in the Safety Analysis Set with a confirmed diagnosis 
of MZL. Efficacy analyses were performed using the Efficacy Analysis Set. 
The efficacy analysis set includes all patient who were enrolled, received at least 1 dose of a study 
drug, and had an MZL confirmed diagnosis. According to the Intention to treat principle, all recruited 
patients regardless of their diagnosis and whether they received treatment should have been included 
in the primary efficacy population.  
Primary endpoint: ORR by IRC 
The point estimate and corresponding two-sided Clopper-Pearson 95% CI for ORR will be presented. 
The best overall response is defined as the best response recorded from the start of zanubrutinib 
throughout the study. Patients with no post-baseline response assessment (due to any reason) will be 
considered non-responders for the purposes of this analysis. The primary efficacy analysis will be 
conducted when mature response rate data have been observed, estimated as no later than 12 months 
after the last patient received the first dose of study drug. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
ORR by Investigator and ORR using PET assessment in FDG-avid patients by IRC.  
It will be analyzed using the same statistical methods as ORR by IRC. 
40 
 
 
 
 
PFS by IRC and PFS by Investigator 
Kaplan-Meier methodology will be used to estimate the median and other quantiles of PFS. Two-sided 
95% CIs of median and other quartiles, if estimable, will be constructed with a generalized 
Brookmeyer and Crowley method (Brookmeyer 1982; Klein 1997) with log-log transformation. PFS 
rates at selected landmark time points (e.g. 6-month) will be provided with corresponding 95% CIs 
calculated based on the Greenwood’s formula (Kalbfleisch and Prentice 1980) with log-log 
transformation. The duration of the follow-up for PFS will be determined by reverse Kaplan-Meier 
method (Schemper 1996). 
PFS will be right-censored based on rules provided. The PFS censoring rule will follow FDA Guidance for 
Industry Clinical Trial Endpoints for the Approval of Cancer Drugs and Biologics (FDA 2018). 
Table 10 Censoring rules for analysis of PFS 
OS 
OS will be analyzed using the similar method as described for PFS. 
Patients who remain alive before data cutoff or discontinuation of the study (discontinued study due to 
reasons other than “Death”) will be censored at the time of data cutoff or the last date the patient is 
known to be alive.  
DOR by IRC and DOR by Investigator 
The censoring rules for DOR will follow the PFS censoring rules. Kaplan-Meier methods will be used to 
estimate median and other quartiles and 95% CIs for DOR. Only responders will be included in this 
analysis.

Multiplicity Adjustment 
Not applicable. A strategy for controlling the time 1 error due to multiple secondary endpoint was not 
implemented in the SAP. Therefore, the secondary endpoints are considered exploratory. 
Interim analysis 
No formal interim analyses are planned for this study. Data from the study will be reviewed by the 
study monitoring committee on a periodic basis. Summaries and analyses of subsets of the study data 
may be performed on a periodic basis for submission to professional meetings and for internal 
decision-making. 
The MAH presented information about the efficacy analyses performed during the course of the study. 
The MAH performed two efficacy analyses after the last patient was recruited but before the protocol-
specified primary analysis. Those analyses did not lead to changes to the study conduct. 
Changes in the Planned Analyses 
Per request from the US FDA, the definition of a treatment-emergent adverse event was updated to 
include any event that was associated with a current treatment-emergent adverse event and worsened 
to Grade 5 > 30 days after the last dose of study drug and prior to the initiation of new anticancer 
therapy. In addition, separate sensitivity analyses were performed for Independent Review Committee-
assessed response based on CT assessments only per request from the US FDA. 
The SAP dated 10 June 2020 is the only version of the SAP for this study.

Recruitment 
As of the data cutoff date of 18 January 2021, 68 patients from 31 clinical sites in 9 countries 
(Australia, China, Czech Republic, France, Italy, New Zealand, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and 
the United States [US]) were enroled in this ongoing study (214) and received at least 1 dose of study 
drug. The first patient was treated with zanubrutinib on 19 February 2019 and the last patient enroled 
received their first dose on 06 January 2020. Enrolment in the study is complete.

Baseline data 
A comparison of patient disposition between studies BGB-3111-214 and BGB-3111-AU-003 is 
presented. BGB-3111-AU-003 has a longer follow-up as the study has been ongoing for approximately 
6 years. The median duration of study follow-up was 35.24 months (range: 8.3, 59.2) in study BGB-
3111-AU-003 versus 15.70 months (range: 1.6 to 21.9 months) in study BGB-3111-214. The 
percentage of patients continuing treatment was similar in both studies (study BGB-3111-214, 58.8% 
versus 60.0% in study BGB-3111-AU-003). More patients in study BGB-3111-214 versus study BGB-
3111-AU-003 remained in the study (59 [86.8%] versus 15 [75.0%]) at the data cutoff date. 
Approximately 54% of patients were continuing treatment for more than 1 year in study BGB-3111-
214. Approximately 60.0% of patients in study BGB-3111-AU-003 were continuing treatment for more 
than 2 years and 30% of patients for more than 3 years.

Numbers analysed 
The number (percentage) of patients included in each analysis set is presented below. Two patients 
were excluded from the Efficacy Analysis Set because the central pathology results showed histologic 
transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Patient enrolment was based on the local pathology 
results. Central pathology review was not required before enrolment.

Primary endpoint: Overall response rate (ORR) 
A comparison of the IRC-assessed ORR for studies BGB-3111-214 and BGB-3111-AU-003 is presented. 
BGB-3111-214 and BGB-3111-AU-003 enrolled patients with similar baseline characteristics. Patient’s 
age, gender, ECOG status, MZL subtypes, number, and nature of prior lines of therapies were 
comparable between the studies. Of note, in study BGB-3111-214, 5 (7.6%) of patients with stable 
disease were continuing on study treatment.

ORR by IRC for study 214 was 45/66 (68.2%) with a CR of 25.8%, The ORR of 68.2% ruled out the 
prespecified null hypothesis of 30% with an exact 1-sided p-value <0.0001. Overall response rate was 
defined as the proportion of patients who achieved a best overall response of PR or CR as determined 
by an Independent Review Committee in accordance with the Lugano classification. 
ORR by IRC was a secondary endpoint for study AU003; the results are presented here as they are 
considered supportive of the results from the pivotal study 214. No prespecified null hypothesis exists 
for this study.

As a strategy for controlling the time 1 error due to multiple secondary endpoint was not implemented, 
the secondary endpoints are considered exploratory. 
The MAH has provided updated results from the pivotal study BGB-3111-214 supporting the extension 
of indication to R/R MZL. While the observed CR rate of 25.8% is not particularly high, an ORR of 
68.2% in an indolent disease such as MZL with a median follow-up time for DOR of almost 2 years and 
median DOR not reached (72.9% at 24 months) could be regarded as promising taking into account 
the single arm design of the study. Thus, results from the ongoing phase 3 study should provide 
additional data on time-to-event endpoints to further confirm the observed efficacy results from the 
pivotal study BGB-3111-214. 
Response was rapid in both studies with a similar median TTR (2.79 versus 2.8 months) in study 214 
and study AU003, respectively.  
Ancillary analyses 
Primary and selected secondary endpoints were summarized descriptively for baseline demographic 
and disease characteristic subgroups listed in the Statistical Analysis Plan when there was a sufficient 
number of patients, otherwise relevant subgroups could have been combined. These included: sex, age 
group (< 65 versus ≥ 65 years), ECOG performance status (0 versus ≥ 1), prior line of therapy for MZL 
(< 3 versus ≥ 3), and MZL subtypes. Within-group summary statistics (eg. overall response rate and 
medians for PFS, duration of response and their 95% CIs) were presented in forest plots. The 
subgroup variables and/or the cutoff values were subject to change if warranted to better represent 
the data. 
A forest plot for IRC-assessed ORR by subgroup is presented below.

Design 
Study BGB-3111-214 is a Phase 2, multicentre, single-arm, open-label study of 
zanubrutinib (BGB-3111) in patients with relapsed or refractory marginal zone 
lymphoma who have received at least 1 prior anti-CD20-based therapy.  
 Duration of main phase: 
First patient was enrolled on 19 February 2019 
and the last patient was enrolled on 06 
January 2020. Study data was based on the 
data cutoff date of 18 January 2021.  
For Study BGB-3111-214, the primary efficacy endpoint is ORR according to the 
Lugano Classification (Cheson et al 2014) as assessed by an Independent 
Review Committee (IRC). A two-sided Clopper-Pearson 95% confidence interval 
(CI) for ORR will be calculated. Assuming 48% ORR of zanubrutinib, a sample 
size of 65 patients will provide 82% power to rule out an ORR of 30%, at a 1-
sided alpha level of 0.025 and using the exact binomial test.

Study AU003 is considered supportive and has been presented side-by-side with the pivotal study 214 
in the main study section. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The Applicant has presented two single-arm trials conducted in patients with MZL (all three subtypes 
included). The pivotal study BGB-3111-214 (214) included 66 patients (efficacy analysis). The primary 
endpoint was ORR (the proportion of patients who achieved a best overall response of PR or CR) as 
determined by an Independent Review Committee (IRC) in accordance with the Lugano classification, 
which is considered acceptable in a SAT in an indolent disease such as MZL. The MAH aimed to show 
that the ORR was larger than 30 % based on the observed IRC-assessed ORR for the ibrutinib study in 
R/R MZL (ORR 48 %, Noy et al 2017). However, there are no available data from RCTs supporting the 
assumption that achieving PR, or even CR with continuous, long term treatment with Bruton kinase 
inhibitors in R/R MZL with at least moderate prognosis, translate into PFS or OS benefit. 
Supportive evidence is presented from study BGB-3111-AU-003 (AU003); a phase 1/2 study with 
safety and PK as the primary endpoint (N=20 for MZL).  
The MAH has started a phase 3 randomised, open-label study of zanubrutinib plus rituximab versus 
lenalidomide plus rituximab in patients with R/R MZL, with a targeted sample size of ~374 patients. 
The primary objective is PFS; the secondary objectives are EFS, ORR, CR, DoR and OS. While there are 
uncertainties of the PFS benefit if treating R/R MZL patients with lenalidomide plus rituximab, this 
comparator seems to be acceptable and will also provide additional data from other chemotherapy free 
option, lenalidomide. According to MAH, the estimated primary completion date will be in May 2028. 
The MAH has agreed to the proposal to provide additional efficacy data post-authorisation. As such, the 
abovementioned phase 3 trial is proposed as a PAES. The MAH has agreed to provide the results of the 
RCT as a PAES in order to support the results of the single-arm trial 214.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Zanubrutinib demonstrated high response rates; ORR by IRC was documented in 45/66 (68.2%) 
patients in the pivotal study 214, with a CR of 17/66 (25.8%). Demonstration of efficacy relies on a 
small single arm study with few patients (N=66) and initially very limited median follow-up time. The 
updated analysis of Study BGB-3111-214 provides meaningful additional follow-up data for the 
evaluation of duration of response and PFS: median duration of response follow-up time is 23.4 
68 
 
 
months compared to 8.31 months in the primary analysis; the median PFS follow follow-up time is 
27.4 months compared to 11.14 months in the primary analysis. 
Given the small study populations (N=66 for 214 and N=20 for AU003) no conclusion with regards to 
special populations can be made. With regards to race, there were 11/66 patients from China in study 
214, and 4/20 Asian patients in study AU003. 
In order to substantiate the efficacy results (ORR) the MAH provided updated efficacy results of the 
pivotal study BGB-3111-214 with a data cutoff date of 04 May 2022 which represents approximately 
15.5 months of additional follow-up from the initial data cut on 18 January 2021. While the observed 
CR rate of 25.8% is not particularly high, an ORR of 68.2% in an indolent disease such as MZL with a 
median follow-up time for DOR of almost 2 years and median DOR not reached (72.9% at 24 months) 
could be regarded as promising taking into account the single arm design of the study. Thus, results 
from the ongoing phase 3 study should provide additional data on time-to-event endpoints to further 
confirm the observed efficacy results from the pivotal study BGB-3111-214.

Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy results from single-arm trial 214 show relevant response rates for zanubrutinib in patients with 
R/R MZL. Responses are durable upon longer follow-up and endorse the clinical benefit from this 
treatment. 
In order to further confirm the efficacy of zanubrutinib in patients with R/R MZL, the MAH will submit 
the final study report of the post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES): Study BGB-3111-308: a global, 
multicenter, phase 3, open-label, randomized study of zanubrutinib plus rituximab versus lenalidomide 
plus rituximab in patients with relapsed/refractory marginal zone lymphoma (NCT05100862).  
2.5. 
Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety profile for zanubrutinib monotherapy is derived from 847 patients with MZL and other B-cell 
malignancies enrolled into 7 clinical studies (2 Phase 1 studies, 4 Phase 2 studies and 1 Phase 3 
study):  
Table 31 Studies included in the SCS 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/896485/2022  
Page 69/124 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Safety data are presented for the following 4 patient groups: 
1. 
The 214+AU-003 MZL patient group, which includes BGB-3111-214 (n = 68) + patients with 
MZL (n = 20) enrolled to Study BGB-3111-AU-003, collectively comprising n = 88 patients who 
received at least 1 dose of zanubrutinib. 
2. 
The All Non-China patient group, which includes zanubrutinib-treated patients enrolled to 
studies outside of China including Study BGB-3111-214 and all patients in BGB-3111-AU-003 
and -302 (n = 571). 
3. 
The All China patient group, which includes zanubrutinib-treated patients enrolled to BGB-
3111-214 in China and all patients in studies BGB-3111-1002, -205, -206 and -210, (n = 276). 
70 
 
 
 
 
4. 
The All Zanubrutinib patient group, which includes zanubrutinib-treated patients in the 
aforementioned 7 studies (n = 847). 
Additional safety data from Study BGB-3111-LTE1 (long-term extension [LTE-1]), a study consisting of 
patients rolling over from study BGB-3111-AU-003 who were continuing study treatment or who were 
on long-term safety and survival follow-up at the time of transition to BGB-3111-LTE1 from the BGB-
3111-AU-003 are combined with Study BGB-3111-AU-003 and included in this filing. 
For an additional perspective, selected summaries of comparative safety data from the Phase 3 study 
of zanubrutinib versus ibrutinib in patients with MYD88MUT WM (Study BGB-3111-302, Cohort 1) are 
provided as these data provide head-to-head comparison of the 2 BTK inhibitors in a single 
randomized.  
Patient exposure 
Exposure data for all patient groups are summarized below. Across all patient groups, the median 
relative dose intensity was near 100%.

Race 
An overview of TEAEs for patients in the All Zanubrutinib group is presented by race in Table 38. 
Similar percentages among white and Asian patients reported 1 or more TEAEs (98.5% versus 97.6%, 
respectively), ≥ Grade 3 TEAEs (64.8% versus 66.3%, respectively) as well as TEAEs leading to 
treatment discontinuation (10.7% versus 10.4%, respectively) and death (5.0% versus 5.4%, 
respectively). Events that met the criteria for seriousness were more common in white than Asian 
patients (49.1% versus 41.8%, respectively), an observation that is consistent with that based on 
regional differences (All Non-China and All China groups).

See the pharmacokinetics section.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Across all patient groups, the most common reason for treatment discontinuation was progressive 
disease and the most common reason for study discontinuation was death (Table 4).  
In the 214+AU003 MZL group, 36 patients (40.9%) discontinued study treatment. Fourteen patients 
(15.9%) discontinued study participation. Median follow-up time on study was 16.69 months (range: 
1.6 to 59.2 months). 
In the All China group, 246 patients (89.1%) discontinued study treatment. A total of 237 patients 
(85.9%) discontinued study participation. The large percentages of patients discontinued from study 
treatment and participation are a consequence of the closure of studies BGB-3111-205, 206, and 
1002. 
In the All Zanubrutinib group, 497 patients (58.7%) discontinued study treatment. A total of 394 
patients (46.5%) discontinued study participation. Median follow-up time on study was 32.43 months 
(range: 0.1 to 71.4 months).

Post marketing experience 
Zanubrutinib (BRUKINSA) has received marketing authorization in USA for the treatment of adult 
patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least 1 prior therapy (14 November 
2019) (BRUKINSA US Prescribing Information 2019). 
On 02 June 2020, BRUKINSA 80 mg was approved in China for the treatment of adult patients with 
MCL who had received at least 1 prior therapy, and for the treatment of adult patients with CLL/SLL 
who had received at least 1 prior therapy. 
During the reporting period of 14 November 2019 to 13 February 2021, there were 229 serious events 
reported from approximately 166 cases. General disorders and administration site conditions was the 
most commonly reported SOC (62 serious events in approximately 55 cases). The most frequently 
reported preferred term events included death (28 events) and disease progression (15 events). 
Additional events were reported in the following SOCs: infections and infestations (50 events with the 
most frequent events of pneumonia [11 events] and urinary tract infection [9 events]); neoplasms 
benign, malignant, and unspecified (including cysts and polyps) (16 events); respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorders (16 events); gastrointestinal disorders (14 events); blood and lymphatic system 
disorders (14 events); and investigations (12 events). 
There were less than 10 events reported in the other SOCs. These events came from postmarketing 
solicited reports, spontaneous reports, compassionate use program, and investigator sponsored 
research. 
Cumulatively, as of 13 November 2020, approximately 1,659,352 capsules of zanubrutinib have been 
supplied to the market worldwide (equivalent to 414,838 daily doses based on the recommended daily 
dose of four 80 mg capsules per day; approximately 
13,646.0 person-months; 1,137.2 person-years). The patient exposure was based on postmarketing 
sales data from the USA and China (data on file). 
No changes in the approved product labelling for BRUKINSA are being considered at this time. No 
regulatory actions concerning safety have been taken since the International Birth Date of 14 
November 2019.  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of zanubrutinib has been presented for patients with MZL and other B-cell 
malignancies. Safety data derived from seven clinical studies involving 847 patients treated with 
zanubrutinib monotherapy are generally consistent across studies and patient populations. No new 
safety signal was observed.  
Patients in the 214+AU003 MZL group reported lower frequencies for most commonly reported AEs 
when compared with those in the All Zanubrutinib group, but there the median exposure was twice 
that of the 214+AU003 MZL group.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/896485/2022  
Page 111/124 
 
 
 
 
The incidences of the various AESIs are also of the same magnitude as the current safety pool 
(N=779).  No major differences between the 214+AU003 group and the All Zanubrutinib group were 
seen particularly when looking at the first six months for all groups and the Exposure-Adjusted 
Incidence Rates, and taking into account, that the low number of events for the small 214+AU003 
group (N=88) creates some uncertainty regarding the true incidence in this group. 
In the 214+AU003 MZL group 39.8% reported at least one SAE. SAEs reported in ≥2% of patients 
included pyrexia (8%), pneumonia, influenza, diarrhoea, anaemia, and fall (each 2.3%). In the All 
Zanubrutinib group (where the exposure was longer) 47.1% reported at least one SAE, and PTs 
reported in ≥ 2% of patients included pneumonia (9.6%) and pyrexia (2.5%).

Except for some editorial changes there were no other changes proposed in summary table of 
additional pharmacovigilance activities.  
As no new safety concerns were identified based on the new study results, no adjustment on additional 
pharmacovigilance is expected. The proposed table of additional pharmacovigilance plan is accepted.

Part V Summary of the risk management plan 
This section was updated by inclusion of the new indication and some editorial changes.  
3.1. 
Overall conclusion on the RMP 
 The changes to the RMP could be acceptable provided an updated RMP and satisfactory responses 
to the request for supplementary information in section 5 are submitted.  
4. Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this variation, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.8, and 5.1 of the SmPC are being updated to include 
the treatment of adult patients with marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) who have received at least one-
prior anti-CD20-based therapy. Several issues have been raised, in particular changes to the wording of 
the  indication  and  changes  to  recommendations  regarding  co-administration  of  zanubrutinib  with 
moderate CYP3A inducers.   
The Package Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly. 
Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information. 
4.1.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Brukinsa. The bridging report submitted by the MAH has 
been found acceptable. See inserted document. 
4.1.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Brukinsa (zanubrutinib) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

5. Benefit-Risk Balance 
5.1. 
Therapeutic Context 
The proposed indication for zanubrutinib is for the treatment of (all subtypes) of MZL  in adult patients 
who have received ≥1 prior therapy. 
5.1.1.  Disease or condition 
MZL (Swerdlow et al., 2016) is an indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) that originates from memory 
B-lymphocytes normally present in the marginal zone of secondary lymphoid follicles within the spleen, 
lymph nodes, and mucosal lymphoid tissues (Kahl and Yang 2008). MZL is categorized by the World 
Health Organization into 3 distinct subtypes: extranodal MZL of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue 
(MALT) or MALT lymphoma, nodal MZL, and splenic MZL. MZLs comprise about 5% to 17% of all NHLs 
in adults, with MALT lymphoma as the most common subtype (50% to 70% of MZLs), followed by the 
splenic (20% of all MZLs) and nodal (10% of all MZLs) subtypes. 
Like other indolent NHLs, advanced-stage disease is considered incurable, with most patients 
experiencing a continuing pattern of relapse and remission. Relapse is inevitable for many patients, 
likely due to inadequate response to current therapies, drug resistance, or inability to tolerate 
treatment due to side effects. Ineffective disease control will eventually lead to poor outcomes, 
including fatality.  
5.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There are no chemotherapy or immunotherapy products specifically approved for MZL in the European 
Union (EU) for patients with treatment-naive or relapsed/refractory (R/R) disease.  
However, bendamustine is approved for indolent R/R NHLs, including MZL, as monotherapy in patients 
who have progressed during or within 6 months following treatment with rituximab or a rituximab 
containing regimen. In addition to bendamustine, several products (corticosteroids and several 
chemotherapies) have at least partially overlapping indication with the applied indication for 
zanubrutinib. 
Historically, very few prospective clinical trials have been conducted specifically in this patient 
population, and even fewer comparative, randomized trials have been carried out. Patients with MZL 
have been enrolled and treated in clinical trials designed for patients with indolent NHL where the ee  
As is evident from the ESMO guideline recommendations (Zucca et al., 2020), the primary treatment 
options depend on the subtype of MZL (see Introduction).  
If the relapse of MZL is symptomatic, second-line and subsequent systemic treatments may include 
single-agent rituximab (while not specifically approved in MZL) or chemoimmunotherapy (the same 
regimen or an alternative regimen) can be repeated after a long initial remission (≥24 months). 
However, immunochemotherapy is associated with significant toxicity in these patients, especially in 
elderly patients and those with comorbidities. Moreover, data that suggest efficacy of these regimens 
are often based on a small subset of patients and/or retrospectively evaluated (Cheah et al 2019). 
There is an unmet medical need for effective and safe therapies to improve long-term outcomes.

5.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study BGB-3111-214: A Phase 2, Open-label Study of Zanubrutinib (BGB-3111) in Patients with 
Relapsed or Refractory Marginal Zone Lymphoma. 
Supportive Study BGB-3111-AU-003: A Phase 1/2, Open-Label, Multiple-Dose, Dose-Escalation and 
Expansion Study to Investigate the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of the BTK Inhibitor BGB-3111 in 
Patients With B-Cell Lymphoid Malignancies. 
5.2. 
Favourable effects 
Zanubrutinib demonstrated high response rates; ORR by IRC of 45/66 (68.2%) in the pivotal study 
214 with a CR of 17/66 (25.8%).   
5.3. 
Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The updated analysis of Study BGB-3111-214 provides meaningful additional follow-up data for the 
evaluation of duration of response: median duration of response follow-up time is 23.4 months 
compared to 8.31 months in the primary analysis and median DOR not reached (72.9% at 24 months).    
However, demonstration of efficacy relies on a small single arm study with few patients (N=66) and 
initially very limited median follow-up time. In order to further confirm the efficacy of zanubrutinib in 
patients with R/R MZL, the MAH will submit the final study report of the post-authorisation efficacy 
study (PAES): Study BGB-3111-308: a global, multicenter, phase 3, open-label, randomized study of 
zanubrutinib plus rituximab versus lenalidomide plus rituximab in patients with relapsed/refractory 
marginal zone lymphoma (NCT05100862) (see Annex II). 
5.4. 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety observations in patients with R/R MZL were consistent with findings from the integrated 
safety analyses described in the current SmPC. No new safety signals were found. 
5.5. 
Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The pivotal study 214 was a SAT, which comes with a built-in uncertainty. On the other hand, the 
approved indication (in R/R Waldenström macroglobulinaemia) was based on a phase 3 trial comparing 
zanubrutinib to ibrutinib, and as safety seems comparable between that study, the entire All 
zanubrutinib monotherapy pool and the current MZL study, the uncertainty is considered limited. 
Further, safety of zanubrutinib in patients with R/R MZL, will be studied in the context of BGB-3111-
308: a global, multicenter, phase 3, open-label, randomized study of zanubrutinib plus rituximab 
versus lenalidomide plus rituximab in patients with relapsed/refractory marginal zone lymphoma 
(NCT05100862) (see Annex II) .

Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
5.7.1. 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The MAH has provided efficacy data from one small pivotal SAT (N=66). In study BGB-3111-214 
patients with R/R MZL had a high ORR (68.2%), with a CR rate of 25.8%.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/896485/2022  
Page 121/124 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Whenever patients with indolent lymphoma (like MZL) needs systemic treatment in case of relapsed 
(or refractory) disease, the target is to achieve as good response as possible, i.e. complete response. 
While achieving a response (PR or preferably CR) is of importance, there is no clear correlation of ORR 
to PFS or OS, at least in relapsed / refractory MZL patients.  
In addition, PFS and OS results based on the results from a single arm study, like study 214, are 
considered only descriptive. 
The updated analysis of Study BGB-3111-214 provides meaningful additional follow-up data for the 
evaluation of duration of response: median duration of response follow-up time is 23.4 months 
compared to 8.31 months in the primary analysis and median DOR not reached (72.9% at 24 months).    
The safety features of zanubrutinib have been earlier characterised in the application concerning WM 
as an indication. It can be concluded that zanubrutinib is reasonably well tolerated, and that after the 
addition of this fairly small patient population into the dataset, the safety profile of zanubrutinib 
remains unchanged. 
5.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Based on the updated data with a median study follow-up of 28 months and an RCT accepted as a 
PAES, the benefit/risk is considered positive.  
5.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Additionally, the applicant applied for an extended (10+1-year) marketing protection. 
The MAH has provided a comprehensive review and comparison to the existing therapies for R/R MZL. 
It is agreed with the MAH that rituximab is not specifically approved for the treatment of MZL and thus 
the only relevant comparator is bendamustine.  
Due to design of the studies (bendamustine monotherapy and bendamustine plus rituximab) with very 
limited number of patients, the indirect comparisons with regard to efficacy or safety are of limited 
value and cannot be regarded conclusive. 
However, given the fact that zanubrutinib is administered orally compared to bendamustine which is 
administered intravenously, the significant clinical benefit based on major contribution to patient care 
has been granted. 
A significant clinical benefit of Brukinsa in the claimed indication, in order to benefit from an extended 
(10+1-year) marketing protection period, has been demonstrated provided the responses are 
satisfactory to RSI. 
5.8. 
Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Brukinsa for the treatment of adult patients with marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) is 
considered positive.

6. Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change:

Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition

I and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
 Extension of indication to include treatment of adult patients with marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) who 
have received at least one-prior anti-CD20-based therapy, based on data from 88 patients with R/R 
MZL from 2 ongoing pivotal studies; Study BGB-3111-214: A Phase 2, open-label, single-arm study 
designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of zanubrutinib in patients with R/R MZL, and Study BGB-
3111-AU-003: A first-in-human, Phase 1/2, dose-escalation and selection, PK/pharmacodynamic, 
safety, and efficacy study in adult patients with R/R or treatment-naive B-cell malignancies. As a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated, and the Package Leaflet is 
updated in accordance.  
Version 1.1 of the RMP has also been submitted.  
In addition, the one additional year of market protection requested by the MAH has been granted. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and 
to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I, II and IIIB and to the 
Risk Management Plan are recommended. 
Additional market protection 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of 
Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers that the new therapeutic indication 
brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. 
7. EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR 
module "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan 
Summary of risk management plan for 
Thalidomide Lipomed 100 mg coated tablets 
(Thalidomide) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Thalidomide Lipomed 100 mg coated tablets. 
The RMP details important risks of the product and how these risks can be minimised. 
The summary of product characteristics (SmPC) for Thalidomide Lipomed 100 mg coated tablets and 
the package leaflet give essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how the product 
should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Thalidomide Lipomed 100 mg coated tablets should be read in the context 
of all this information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, 
all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be  included  in  updates  of  the  RMP  for 
Thalidomide Lipomed 100 mg coated tablets. 
I.     
The medicine and what it is used for 
Thalidomide  Lipomed  in  combination  with  melphalan  and  prednisone  is  authorised  as  first  line 
treatment  of  patients  with  untreated  multiple  myeloma,  aged  ≥ 65 years  or  ineligible  for  high  dose 
chemotherapy (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains thalidomide as the active substance and it 
is given by oral route of administration. 
Further information about the evaluation of the benefits of Thalidomide Lipomed 100 mg coated tablets 
can be found in the EPAR for Thalidomide Lipomed, including in its plain-language summary, available 
on the EMA website, under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/thalidomide-lipomed 
II.    
further characterise the risks  
Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or 
Important risks of Thalidomide Lipomed 100 mg coated tablets, together with measures to minimise 
such risks and the proposed studies for learning more about the products’ risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet (PL) and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size − the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
 
 
 
 
•  The medicine’s legal status − the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or without 
prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In  the  case  of  Thalidomide  Lipomed  100 mg  coated  tablets,  these  measures  are  supplemented  with 
additional risk minimisation measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected  continuously  and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. 
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
II.A  List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  of  Thalidomide  Lipomed  100 mg  coated  tablets  are  risks  that  need  special  risk 
management activities to further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be 
safely  administered.  Important  risks  can  be  regarded  as  identified  or  potential.  Identified  risks  are 
concerns for  which there is  sufficient  proof  of  a  link  with the  use  of  Thalidomide  Lipomed  100 mg 
coated tablets. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is 
possible  based  on available  data,  but  this association  has  not  been  established yet  and  needs further 
evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to  information  on  the  safety  of  the  medicinal  product  that  is 
currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

Introduction 
On 21 December 2017, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Revolade (eltrombopag), 
in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric studies do not influence the benefit risk for Revolade and 
that no consequential regulatory action is required. No changes to the paediatric information of the 
current EU Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) are proposed because of this study. 
1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Information on the development program 
Eltrombopag is an orally bioavailable, small molecule thrombopoietin receptor agonist, approved for 
marketing in the EU through the centralised procedure on 15th March 2010.  
Eltrombopag is indicated in the paediatric population for chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic 
purpura (ITP) patients aged 1 year and above who are refractory to other treatments (e.g. 
corticosteroids, immunoglobulins). Two studies, the Phase II PETIT study (TRA108062) and Phase III 
PETIT2 study (TRA115450), formed the basis of the approval of eltrombopag in paediatric patients with 
chronic ITP in the EU. Study PETIT2 was considered the pivotal study while PETIT was presented as 
dose-finding supportive study. It is noted that the paediatric investigation plan (PIP) for the condition 
ITP (EMEA-000170-PIP01-07-M04) only discussed the PETIT study, which was conducted in compliance 
with an agreed paediatric investigation plan (EMEA-C-000170-PIP01-07-M03).  
The hereby submitted study (CETB115BRU01) is an extension study conducted in Russia for pediatric 
chronic ITP patients who have previously been enrolled in the multicenter, multinational study PETIT2. 
The MAH stated that study CETB115BRU01 "An extension study of Eltrombopag in pediatric patients 
with chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP)" is a stand alone study. 
1.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Two pharmaceutical formulations of eltrombopag have been approved in the European Union:  
•  12.5 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg or 75 mg film-coated tablets for oral administration;  
•  25 mg powder for oral suspension (PfOS) for oral administration. 
No new data were submitted for the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study CETB115BRU01. 
Study CETB115BRU01 was a single arm study where all enrolled patients received eltrombopag 
(tablets and/or PfOS).

Clinical study CETB115BRU01:  
"An extension study of Eltrombopag in pediatric patients with chronic immune (idiopathic) 
thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP)” 
  Description 
Study CETB115BRU01 was a multicenter open-label Phase III extension study conducted in Russia to 
evaluate the long-term safety of eltrombopag in pediatric patients with chronic ITP who previously 
participated in the multinational study TRA115450 (PETIT2 study) and who had obtained clinical 
benefit from treatment with eltrombopag.  
  Methods 
•  Objective 
The primary objective of Study CETB115BRU01 was to provide continued treatment to pediatric 
subjects who completed the PETIT2 study and to describe the safety and tolerability of eltrombopag 
when administered to pediatric patients with previously treated chronic ITP. 
No secondary or exploratory objectives were planned. 
•  Study design 
Study CETB115BRU01 was a multicenter open-label Phase III extension study conducted in Russia to 
evaluate the long-term safety of  eltrombopag in pediatric patients with chronic ITP who previously 
participated in the multinational study TRA115450 (PETIT2 study) and who had obtained clinical 
benefit from the treatment. This study allowed dosing of eltrombopag at an individualized dose for 
each patient based upon platelet counts, being 50 Gi/L - 200 Gi/L the target platelet count range. The 
starting dose was based on the patient’s dose at the end of the PETIT2 study, unless a dose 
adjustment was warranted due to platelet count. The maximum dose was 75 mg daily. 
A screening period was followed by a single arm treatment period and a follow-up period in this study: 
- 
A screening period of up to 28 days prior to Day 1 of treatment in this study.

Page 4/15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
-  Open-label, single arm, dose-adjustment, long-term treatment period, in which patients 
continued treatment until at least one of the following criteria were met: 
o  Patient reached 18 years of age: Patient was considered to have completed the study, 
and was discontinued from eltrombopag within 3 months of his/her 18th birthday. 
o  Eltrombopag received local regulatory approval for pediatric chronic ITP. 
- 
Follow-up period. All patients had to complete the 4-week follow-up period, as described 
below, as part of their participation in this study: 
o  Patients who were elected not to continue treatment with eltrombopag (i.e., nonstudy 
treatment) after completion of the study treatment period, had weekly follow-up visits 
for 4 weeks after the last dose of eltrombopag. 
o  Patients who continued treatment with eltrombopag (i.e., non-study treatment) after 
completion of the study treatment periods had a follow-up visit 4 weeks after the last 
dose of eltrombopag. 
•  Study population /Sample size 
Study population 
Patients were eligible if they were pediatric patients with chronic ITP who previously participated in 
thePETIT2 Study and fully completed that study. No sample size re-estimation was planned for this 
study. The main exclusion criteria were any serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical, psychiatric 
disorder, or other conditions that could interfere with the patient’s safety or compliance to the study 
procedures. 
Sample size 
Maximum twelve patients were planned to be enrolled in this study conducted in Russia across 4 
centers. The sample size (n = 12) assumed by the MAH was based on the number of patients 
previously enrolled in the PETIT2 Study  in that country.  
•  Treatments 
Study CETB115BRU01 was a single-arm study where all enrolled patients received eltrombopag 
(tablets or PfOS).  
For patients between the ages of 6 to 17 years old, eltrombopag tablets was administered, however, 
patients between the ages of 6 to 11 years old may use PfOS if they have difficulty swallowing tablets 
and are receiving a dose of eltrombopag of < 40 mg. For patients between the ages of 1 to 5 years 
old, either eltrombopag tablets or PfOS was administered. Any change between PfOS and tablet 
formulations should take into account the differences in bioavailability between formulations. When 
switching from PfOS to tablets, the nearest tablet strength rounding up should be used.  
This study allowed dosing of eltrombopag at an individualized dose for each patient based upon 
platelet counts, being 50 Gi/L - 200 Gi/L the target platelet count range. The starting dose was based

on the patient’s dose at the end of the PETIT2 study, unless a dose adjustment was warranted due to 
platelet count. The maximum dose was 75 mg daily. 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the assessment of long-term safety. The frequency of all AEs was the 
primary variable (endpoint). 
Safety assessments included clinical laboratory evaluation (hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis), 
vital signs, pregnancy, physical findings and other observations related to safety such as liver exams 
and ocular exams (cataracts) and frequency of all adverse events, categorized using Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) toxicity grades. Any abnormal findings were recorded 
in the appropriate CRF form, e.g., Medical History or AE/SAE form. 
The endpoints were summarized utilizing the All Treated Subjects (ATS) analysis set. 
The efficacy was not formally evaluated during this study. Patients could continue treatment as per 
protocol defined criteria as long as clinical benefit was evident. 
•  Statistical Methods 
Planned analysis:  
No formal statistical hypothesis tests were planned. 
All patients who receive at least one dose of study medication were included in the All Treated Patients 
(ATS) analysis set population.  
No data sets were planned for this study.  
As it was anticipated that accrual would be spread thinly across centers and summaries of data by 
center would be unlikely to be informative, data from all participating centers were pooled prior to 
analysis. 
As this is a single arm study, there are no treatment comparisons.  
Categorical data were presented as frequencies and percentages. For continuous data, n, mean, 
standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum were presented. Demographic and baseline 
characteristics were summarized. 
As the duration of treatment for a given patient would depend on efficacy and tolerability, the duration 
of follow-up would vary between patients. Consequently there was no imputation for missing data. 
No interim statistical analyses were planned for this study. 
Results 
•  Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 9 out of 12 patients planned to be included into the extension study CETB115BRU01 received 
eltrombapag treatment. Four patients (44.4%) completed the study while 5 patients (55.6%) 
discontinued from treatment and withdrew from the study.

The main reasons for discontinuation/withdrawal from treatment were decision by patient or proxy (in 
2 patients), lack of efficacy (in 2 patients) and adverse event (1 patient). 
•  Baseline data 
The minimum age of the patients in the study was 4 years and the maximum age was 15 years. The 
median age was 9.0 years. 
Approximately half of the patients were female (4 patients) and half were male (5 patients). 
All of the patients in this study were white.

Adverse events 
Eight out of 9 (88.9%) patients reported at least one adverse event.  
The most commonly affected SOCs were infections and infestations (in 4 patients), nervous system 
disorders (in 2 patients), and respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (in 2 patients). 
The most common AEs by preferred term were nasopharyngitis (in 3 patients), epistaxis (in 2 
patients), and headache (in 2 patients). 
Only 1 patient experienced an AE that was assessed as Grade 3 in severity. This was an autoimmune 
hepatitis (SOC “Hepatobiliary disorders”). 
None of the reported AEs were considered to be related to eltrombopag.

There were no deaths during the study. 
A total of 3 patients (33.3%) experienced serious adverse events (SAEs). In 2 patients SAEs were 
associated with haemorrhagic symptoms (one case of epistaxis and one case of scleral haemorrhage). 
Both SAEs were resolved and the dose of the drug was not changed. 
One patient experienced SAE of autoimmune hepatitis that led to treatment discontinuation. The 
patient narrative for this event is shown below:

None of the SAEs were considered to be related to eltrombopag by the investigator. 
There were no unexpected safety findings in the pediatric patients with chronic ITP who had previously 
participated in the PETIT2 Study).  
1.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Study CETB115BRU01 was a multicenter, single-arm, open-label Phase III extension study conducted 
in Russia to evaluate the long-term safety of eltrombopag in paediatric patients with chronic ITP who 
previously participated in the multinational study TRA115450 (PETIT2 study) and who had obtained 
clinical benefit from treatment with eltrombopag. The primary objective of study CETB115BRU01 was 
to provide continued treatment to paediatric patients who completed the PETIT2 study and to describe 
the safety and tolerability of eltrombopag when administered to paediatric patients with previously 
treated chronic ITP. The study design appears adequate to describe the long-term safety of 
eltrombopag in this setting. 
PETIT2 study was a multicenter, multinational (including 4 centers in Russia) Phase III pivotal study to 
support the approval of eltrombopag in paediatric patients with chronic ITP in the EU. It is noted that 
this pivotal study was not discussed in the agreed paediatric investigation plan (PIP) for the condition 
ITP (EMEA-000170-PIP01-07-M04).  
The maximum sample size (n=12) of the hereby submitted study (CETB115BRU01) was based only on 
the number of patients previously enrolled in the study PETIT2 in Russia across 4 centers.  
A total of 9 out of 12 patients planned to be included into the extension study CETB115BRU01 received 
eltrombapag treatment. Four patients (44.4%) completed the study while 5 patients (55.6%) 
discontinued from treatment and withdrew from the study. The main reasons for 
discontinuation/withdrawal from treatment were decision by patient or proxy (in 2 patients), lack of 
efficacy (in 2 patients) and adverse event (1 patient). 
Data from all participating centers were pooled prior to analysis. 
A total of 8 patients out of 9 (88.9%) reported at least one adverse event. According to the MAH, the 
incidence of AEs in the hereby submitted study corresponds with the results from patients who 
received eltrombopag in PETIT2 study (81.0%).  
There were no deaths during the study.  
A total of 3 patients (33.3%) experienced serious adverse events (SAEs). In 2 patients SAEs were 
associated with haemorrhagic symptoms (one case of epistaxis and one case of scleral haemorrhage). 
Both SAES were resolved without change in the dose of eltrombopag. 
One patient experienced SAE of autoimmune hepatitis that led to treatment discontinuation.  
None of the reported AEs or SAEs were considered to be related to eltrombopag by the Investigator. 
This consideration seems to be acceptable.  
Additionally, there were no unexpected safety findings in the paediatric patients with chronic ITP who 
had previously participated in the PETIT2 study.  
Overall, the safety profile appears consistent to that observed in the PETIT2 study, and continues to be 
consistent to the EU SmPC of eltrombopag.

2.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Eltrombopag (tablets or PfOS) has been authorised for oral use in the paediatric population for chronic 
immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) patient aged 1 year and above who are refractory 
to other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins). 
In accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, the MAH submitted a final report for 
study CETB115BRU01 and stated that this study is a standalone study. 
Results obtained in this study were consistent to the EU SmPC. The scarcity of data from the few 
patients included in the follow-up study CETB115BRU01 do not provide relevant additional data that 
could change  the view about the long-term safety profile of eltrombopag. Thus, on the basis of study 
results, it is considered that no further regulatory action is required. 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

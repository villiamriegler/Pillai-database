1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

as an add-on therapy to other anti-epileptic 
medicines for patients 2 years of age and older.  As a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 
of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is 
updated in accordance. The due date of the final 
PASS Registry report as approved in the procedure 
EMEA/H/C/PSP/S/0093.3 has been reflected in Annex 
II. Version 2.11 of the RMP has also been agreed. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary 
of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

include the relevant information regarding patients 
with renal impairment following the study 1902 
(Pharmacokinetic study of fenfluramine hydrochloride 
in subjects with varying degrees of impaired and 
normal renal function). 
- Update of section 4.4, 4.5 of the SmPC in order to 
reflect the relevant information on CYP1A2 or 
CYP2B6 or CYP2D6 inducers following the study 1904 
(Pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction study of 
fenfluramine hydrochloride with and without 
fluvoxamine (CYP1A2 inhibitor), paroxetine (CYP2D6 
inhibitor) and rifampin (CYP2B6 inducer) in healthy 
subjects). 
As requested, the recommendation of gastric lavage 
was also removed from section 4.9 of the SmPC.

impairment has a limited effect on fenfluramine and 
norfenfluramine exposure that is not expected to be 
clinically significant. No dose adjustment is recommended 
when ZX008 is administered to patients with mild to severe 
renal impairment however a slower titration may be 
considered and if adverse reactions are reported, a dose 
reduction may be needed. 
No dose adjustment is recommended when ZX008 is co-
administered with strong inhibitors of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and 
CYP2D6 enzymes.  A dose increase of ZX008 may be 
considered up to twice the maximum daily dose when 
ZX008 is administered with strong CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 
inducers.

C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
studies of longer duration compared to the already 
approved non-clinical dossier for Fintepla, including cardiac 
toxicity. No carcinogenic potential was observed in mice 
and rats. It appears that fenfluramine and norfenfluramine 
does not bind to melanin, and thus the risk of dermal-, 
ocular- and phototoxicity is limited.

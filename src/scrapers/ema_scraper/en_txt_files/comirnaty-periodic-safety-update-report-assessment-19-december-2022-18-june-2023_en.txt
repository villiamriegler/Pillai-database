Comirnaty : Periodic safety update report assessment 
19 December 2022 to 18 June 2023  
This document consists of: 
1. The PRAC assessment report of the Comirnaty periodic safety update report (PSUR) 
covering the period 19 December 2022 to 18 June 2023 and; 
2. The Comirnaty PSUR itself.  
The PSUR is a pharmacovigilance document intended to provide an evaluation of the risk-
benefit balance of the medicinal product during the reference period mentioned above.  
The objective of the PSUR is to present a comprehensive and critical analysis of the risk-benefit 
balance of the product, taking into account new or emerging safety information in the context 
of cumulative information on risk and benefits. The marketing authorisation holder is legally 
required to submit PSURs at defined time points after the authorisation of a medicinal product. 
EMA’s safety committee, the PRAC, assesses information in the PSUR to determine if there are 
new risks identified for a medicine and/or if its risk-benefit balance has changed. The outcome 
of this assessment is summarised in the PRAC assessment report of the PSUR. 
The PSUR and the PRAC assessment report of the PSUR include information about suspected 
side effects, i.e. medical events that have been observed following the use of the vaccine, but 
which are not necessarily related to or caused by the vaccine itself. Information on suspected 
side effects should not be interpreted as meaning that the vaccine or the active substance 
causes the observed event or is unsafe to use.  
Only a detailed evaluation and scientific assessment of all available data, as 
described in the PRAC assessment report of the PSUR, can determine the impact of 
new data on the benefits and risks of a medicine. 
Further information on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines and on PSUR submission and 
assessment is available on the EMA website. 
This document may contain redactions for commercially confidential information (CCI) and 
protected personal data (PPD) in accordance with applicable legislation and guidance.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
This  is the assessment of PSUR(s)  submitted  in  accordance with the  requirements set out in  the list of 
Union  reference  dates (EURD  list) for tozinameran  (COMIRNATY),  tozinameran/riltozinameran 
(COMIRNATY Original/Omicron  BA.1),  tozinameran/famtozinameran  (COMIRNATY Original/Omicron 
BA.4-5),  raxtozinameran  (COMIRNATY Omicron  XBB.1.5). 
2.  Assessment conclusions and actions 
The  MAH  submitted the 5th  EU  Periodic Safety Update  Report (PSUR)  for Comirnaty (dated  17 Aug 
2023)  covering the  interval  period  19  Dec  2022 to  18 Jun  2023. 
The active substance of Comirnaty is  highly purified single-stranded,  5'-capped  mRNA produced  using 
a cell-free in  vitro transcription from  the corresponding  DNA template,  encoding  the viral  spike protein 
of SARS-CoV-2.  The  nucleoside-modified  mRNA  is  formulated  in  lipid  nanoparticles,  which  enable 
delivery of the  RNA  into host cells to allow expression  of the SARS-CoV-2  S antigen. The vaccine elicits 
both  neutralising  antibody and  cellular immune responses to the spike antigen,  which  may contribute 
to protection against COVID-19. 
Comirnaty is  indicated  for active  immunisation to prevent COVID-19  caused  by SARS-CoV-2,  in 
individuals 6  months of age  and  older. 
Comirnaty was approved  in  the  EU  through a centralised  procedure on  21  December 2020. 
During  the  interval  period,  257,566,530 doses of Comirnaty original  and  bivalent vaccines  were 
shipped  worldwide.  Cumulatively,  4,615,732,025 doses of Comirnaty original  and  bivalent vaccines 
were shipped  worldwide. 
Raxtozinameran  (COMIRNATY Omicron XBB.1.5)  was approved  in  the  EU  on  31 st August 2023,  after 
the data  lock point (DLP). 
There were  no  marketing  authorisation  withdrawals for safety reasons  during the  interval  period. 
During  the interval  period,  the following  signals were evaluated,  not to be  determined risks,  and  no 
new important safety issue  was  identified  based  on  the data  provided  in  the PSUR: 
•  Myositis  (EPITT  19883);  Pemphigus and  Pemphigoid  (EPITT  19859). 
The  following  were  ongoing  signals during the interval  period: 
•  Menstrual  irregularities (closed  after DLP,  no  causal  association  with  Comirnaty and  continue to 
monitor through  routine  pharmacovigilance); 
•  Sensorineural  hearing  loss  (closed  after DLP,  no causal  association  with Comirnaty and 
continue to monitor through  routine pharmacovigilance); 
•  Retinal  vascular occlusion  (ongoing,  MAH's evaluation  is  awaited). 
During  the interval  period,  there were  post-approval  regulatory requests for the following  topics for 
which  no  safety signal  was  identified  based  on  the  information  provided  in  the PSUR: 
•  Multisystem  inflammatory syndrome children/-adults (MIS-C/-A);  Dyspnoea;  Palpitations; 
Tachycardia/Heart Rate  Increase;  Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH);  Pemphigus and 
Pemphigoid  (new cases/data  through  18 Jun  2023). 
During  the interval  period,  the important potential  risk Vaccine-Associated  Enhanced  Disease  (VAED), 
including Vaccine-Associated  Enhanced  Respiratory Disease  (VAERD)  was  removed  from the  list of 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment report 
EMA/PRAC/585967/2023 
Page  4/142 
safety concerns  in  the Comirnaty RMP  and  PSUR,  and  will  continue to  monitor through  routine 
pharmacovigilance. 
Concerning  the adverse event of special  interest (AESI)  the acute disseminated encephalomyelitis 
(ADEM),  the age  stratified  O/E  ratios of more age  groups were  > 1 compared to the previous 4th  PSUR 
and  for the age  group 25-49 years considered  statistically significant. Therefore, the  MAH  was 
requested  to further discuss  in  detail the results of the O/E analyses concerning  ADEM  with focus  on 
the age group 25-49 years within this PSUSA  procedure.  The  MAH  provided  additional  O/E  analyses 
(including  O/E analyses with  only  BC  level  1, 2 and  3 ADEM  cases)  and  a cumulative  review of cases 
reporting ADEM  through  18 Jun  2023,  including causality assessment of the selected  ADEM  cases. 
Overall,  based  on  the data  provided there is  no  evidence for a causal  relationship  between  Comirnaty 
exposure and  ADEM.  Cases  reporting ADEM  should  continue to  be  monitored  with  routine 
pharmacovigilance. 
The  PSUR  cycle  is  aligned  with the  EURD,  one  additional  6-monthly PSUR  will  be  submitted, followed 
by the yearly PSUR. 
The  benefit-risk balance for the use of Comirnaty (tozinameran), Comirnaty Original/Omicron  BA.1 
(tozinameran  and  riltozinameran),  Comirnaty Original/Omicron  BA.4-5  (tozinameran and 
famtozinameran)  and  raxtozinameran  (COMIRNATY Omicron  XBB.1.5)  in  its authorised  indications 
remains  unchanged. 
3.  Recommendations 
Based  on  the  PRAC  review of data on  safety and  efficacy, the  PRAC  considers that the risk-benefit 
balance of medicinal  products Comirnaty Original  (tozinameran),  Comirnaty Original/Omicron  BA.1 
(tozinameran  and  riltozinameran),  Comirnaty Original/Omicron  BA.4-5  (tozinameran and 
famtozinameran)  and  raxtozinameran  (COMIRNATY Omicron  XBB.1.5)  remains  unchanged  and 
therefore  recommends the maintenance of the  marketing  authorisation(s). 
4. 
Issues to be addressed  in the next PSUR 
The  MAH  should  address the following  issues  in  the  next PSUR: 
1.  The  MAH  should  continue to closely  monitor hemophagocytic  lymphohistiocytosis  (HLH)  and 
report all  new (literature) cases  of HLH  including  a WHO-UMC  causality assessment per case 
and  age-stratified observed/expected  analyses  using  21-day and  42-day risk intervals. 
2.  For future  PSURs,  in 'Adverse  Events of Special  Interest (AESis)' of section 'Evaluation  of Other 
Risks  (not categorised  as  important)', the AESis  should  only be  included  and  discussed  in  the 
PSUR  if the reporting  pattern changes  and/or there  is a safety issue/signal. 
3.  For future  PSURs,  in 'Evaluation  of special  situations' of section 'Evaluation of Other Risks  (not 
categorised  as  important)',  lack of therapeutic efficacy should  only be  included  and  discussed 
in  the PSUR  if the  reporting  pattern changes and/or there is a safety issue/signal. 
5.  PSUR frequency 
[8J  No  changes of PSUR  frequency  proposed. 
Of note, in  the  previous 4th  PSUSA  (procedure  EMEA/H/C/PSUSN00010898/202212) changes of the 
PSUR frequency was  proposed:  The  PSUR cycle  is aligned  with  the  list of Union  reference dates

1.  PSUR Data 
1.1.  Introduction 
The  MAH  submitted the 5th  PSUR  for Comirnaty (tozinameran)  (also  referred  to as  BNT162b2  Original), 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron  BA.1  (tozinameran/riltozinameran)  and  Comirnaty Original/Omicron  BA.4-
5 (tozinameran/famtozinameran), covering  the period  19 December 2022 to  18 June  2023, which  is 
assessed  in  this report. 
The  active substance  of Comirnaty is  highly purified single-stranded,  5'-capped  mRNA produced  using 
a cell-free in  vitro transcription from  the corresponding  DNA template, encoding  the viral  spike protein 
of SARS-CoV-2.  The  nucleoside-modified  mRNA  is  formulated  in  lipid  nanoparticles,  which  enable 
delivery of the  RNA  into host cells to allow expression  of the SARS-CoV-2  S antigen. The vaccine elicits 
both  neutralizing  antibody and  cellular immune responses to the spike antigen,  which  may contribute 
to protection against COVID-19. 
Comirnaty was approved  in  the  EU  through a centralised  procedure on  21  December 2020 and  is 
currently indicated for active  immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused  by SARS-CoV-2  virus in 
individuals 6  months of age and  older.  It is  administered  intramuscularly.  Please  refer to the table 
below for formulations,  presentations and  posology in  the approved  populations:

No  changes to the Comirnaty product information were  proposed  as  part of the submission  of the 
PSUR. 
1.2.  Worldwide marketing authorisation status 
BNT162b2  received  first temporary authorisation for emergency supply under Regulation  174 in  the  UK 
on  01  December 2020. 
BNT162b2  received  first regulatory conditional  marketing authorisation  approval  for use  in  individuals 
16 years and  older in  Switzerland  on  19 December 2020.  In the European  Union, conditional  marketing 
authorisation  was granted  on  21  December 2020;  this was  switched  to a standard  marketing 
authorisation on  10 October 2022.  Overall,  BNT162b2 original  received  marketing authorisation 
approval  in  104 countries/regions. 
In 2022, to address the emergence of Omicron variants,  bivalent formulations were developed. 
Bivalent BNT162b2  (original/Omicron  BA.1)  and  bivalent BNT162b2  (original/Omicron  BA.4/BA.5) 
received  marketing  authorisation  approval  in  46 and  73  countries/regions,  respectively.

Rapporteur assessment comment: 
The  provided  information  regarding  the  worldwide  marketing authorisation status is  noted. 
1.3.  Overview of exposure and safety data 
1.3.1.  Actions taken in the reporting interval for safety reasons 
During  the  reporting  period, the following  action  was taken  with  respect to BNT162b2 for safety 
reasons.  In Switzerland  the approval  for bivalent Omi  BA.1  was  not obtained  for individuals  12 to  less 
than  18 years  because there was  no  clinical  data available for that population.  Because 
country-specific packaging  was  not available,  Switzerland  received  EU  packaging that displayed  age  on 
the carton  as  12+ (as  per EU  MA).  Therefore,  an  information  Letter (in  English)  explaining  the 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment report 
EMA/PRAC/585967/2023 
Page  9/142 
discrepancy between  age on  the carton  and  age  approved  by Swissmedic was  provided  with  each 
shipment.  In addition,  the  MAH  provided  electronic versions of the letter in  German,  French  and  Italian 
to the Federal  Office  of Public  Health. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
The  provided  information  is  noted. 
1.3.2.  Changes to reference safety information 
The  reference  safety information  (RSI)  for this PSUR  is the COVID-19  mRNA vaccine Core  Data  Sheet 
(CDS)  version  121.0 dated  25  May 2023,  in  effect at the end  of the  reporting  period  and  included  in 
Appendix  1 of the  PSUR  (not reproduced  here). 
Three  previous CDS  versions  (version  20.0 dated  22  February 2023, version  19.0 dated  22  December 
2022 and  version  18.0 dated  05  December 2022) were also  in  effect during the  reporting  interval. 
Safety-related  changes are  presented  in  Appendix  1.1  of the  PSUR  (not reproduced  here). 
After the  DLP,  an  updated  CDS  (version  22.0) was  made effective on  24 July 2023. This  updated 
version  includes the addition of vaccine  presentations anticipated  for the 2023-2024 new variant 
(Omicron  XBB.1.5);  several  sections of the CDS  have been  reformatted  to simplify and  consolidate the 
existing  information where possible to remove  redundancy and  repetition.  No  new  information related 
to the indication,  dosing,  safety or efficacy/immunogenicity has  been  added  or revised  as  a result of 
the consolidation  or formatting changes. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
The  EU  SmPC  of Comirnaty (version  10 Aug  2023  which  is after the PSUR  DLP)  is  in  line with  the CDS. 
1.3.3.  Estimated exposure and use patterns 
Clinical trials 
Cumulatively,  69,372  participants have participated  in  the  BNT162b2  clinical  development program 
comprising  several  clinical  candidates: 
•  BNT162b2:  63,843participants of which  35,274 had  received  BNT162b2;  26,489 had  received 
BNT162b2  post-unblinding  and  had  received  placebo  before;  959  had  received 
BNT162b2/placebo;  2  had  received  BNT162b2/ Seasonal  inactivated  influenza vaccine  (SIIV); 
1119 had  received  BNT162b2/ SIIV/ placebo. 
•  Variant and  variant-adapted vaccines  based  on  BNT162b2:  8,851  participants. 
•  Early development candidates:  633  participants. 
•  Blinded therapy:  2 participants. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
In the  previous fourth  PSUR,  the  MAH  reported  that 8,958 participants received  blinded therapy,  and 
that in  the current fifth  PSUR only 2 participants  received  blinded  therapy.  The  MAH  should  explain this 
discrepancy concerning  the cumulative  number of clinical  trial  participants receiving  blinded  therapy.

Page  10/142 
•  Placebo:  6,352 participants. 
•  SUV/placebo:  7  participants. 
Of note,  BNT162b2  is  also  being  utilised  in  3 other Pfizer clinical  development programs: 
•  B747:  372  participants received  BNT162b2 as  a study vaccine or as  a comparator in  the clinical 
study B7471026; 
•  C526:  796  participants received  BNT162b2  Bivalent (BNT162b2  original/Omi  BA.4/BA.5) as  a 
study vaccine or as a comparator in  the clinical  study C5261001. 
•  C548:  757  participants received  BNT162b2  Bivalent (BNT162b2  original/Omi  BA.4/BA.5) as  a 
study vaccine  in  the clinical  study C5481001. 
Post-marketing exposure 
The  number of doses cumulatively administered  (as  per public available data for the EU-EEA  countries, 
the US,  and Japan)  is either no longer updated  or currently updated  on  a bi-weekly base.  Considering 
the current status of the vaccination  schedule and the availability of only partial  data  published  on  the 
ECDC  websites for doses of BNT162b2 vaccines  (original and  bivalent)  administered  in  the EU-EEA 
countries,  it is  no  longer applicable to estimate the number of doses administered  from  those  shipped. 
Estimated  administered doses were  provided  separately,  as  available on  the  public source data. 
Worldwide  exposure: 
•  Cumulative exposure: 
o  Approximately a total  of 4,615,732,025 doses of BNT162b2 (original and 
bivalent) were shipped worldwide from the  receipt of the first temporary 
authorisation for emergency supply on  01 Dec 2020 through  18 Jun  2023, of which 
4,154,348,225 were original  and  bivalent adult presentations (including  PBS  and 
Tris/Sucrose);  461,383,800 were original  and  bivalent paediatric presentations; 
686,454,460 were  bivalent vaccines of which  21,075,900 were  for paediatric 
presentations;  2,446,319,885 doses of BNT162b2  (original  and  bivalent) were shipped 
to rest of world. 
o  Table  7 below displays the cumulative  EU/EEA  published  data  with  number of doses 
administered for each  age  group and  by vaccine  type:

2.  Other trials that reported  new significant efficacy information: 
• 
There were  7  ongoing  clinical  trials, of which  3 were  with the  BNT162b2  original  vaccine 
(BNT162-14,  C4591001  and  C4591007) and  3 were with the  bivalent vaccine  (BNT162-21, 
C4591044 and  C4591048);  in  the 7th clinical  trial  (C4591031)  both  original and  bivalent 
vaccine were administered.:

Original  and  bivalent vaccines 
o  C4591031, A phase  3 master protocol  to evaluate additional dose(s) of BNT162b2  in 
healthy individuals previously vaccinated  with  BNT162b2. 
Study C4591031  consists of 6 substudies.  Substudies A and  B (both with  original)  were 
completed  and  provided  clinically important emerging efficacy and  safety findings, 
while for the remaining  4  ongoing  substudies  (C  [original]  and  D through  F [bivalent 
vaccine])  no  clinically significant safety and/or efficacy information  has emerged. 
Study C4591031  Substudy A was  a Phase  3  randomized,  placebo-controlled,  observer 
blind  substudy aimed  at evaluating the safety, tolerability, and  efficacy of a  booster 
dose of BNT162b2.  Participants 216  years of age  who  had  completed  a  2-dose primary 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment report 
EMA/PRAC/585967/2023 
Page  14/142 
series of BNT162b2  in  Study C4591001  at least 6  months prior to randomization,  were 
enrolled  and  randomized  at a  ratio  of 1: 1 to  receive  either BNT162b2  or placebo. 
Randomization  was  stratified  by age,  such  that approximately 60% of participants 
enrolled  were 216 through  55  years of age  and  approximately 40% of participants  >55 
years of age.  Considering  the observation of waning  effectiveness and  recommendation 
for booster doses  in  some countries,  per the  protocol,  participants could  be  unblinded 
from  24  September 2021  onwards and  those  randomized  to  placebo  were offered a 
dose of BNT162b2  30  µg. 
Conclusions from the final  study report for Substudy A: 
■ 
■ 
The  cumulative incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases  showed that BNT162b2 
30 µg  provided  strong  protection against the Delta variant of SARS  CoV  2,  with 
waning  efficacy following the  rise  of the Omicron variant.  Severe COVID-19 
cases  remained  rare  in  the study population,  despite  increasing  cases  overall. 
The  tolerability and  safety profile of BNT162b2  30  µg  in  participants 216 years 
of age at up  to  12 months after booster vaccination  was  acceptable and 
consistent with  results  previously reported  from the clinical  trial experience 
with  BNT162b2  2-dose  primary vaccination. 
Substudy B of C4591031  was  a randomized,  placebo-controlled, observer-blind, 
crossover substudy to evaluate the safety and  tolerability of a booster (third  or fourth) 
dose of BNT162b2.  Participants 212  years of age to ~30  years of age that received  2 or 
3  prior doses of BNT162b2  (30-µg  doses),  with  their last dose at least 4  months (120 
days)  prior to  randomization,  were  enrolled.  Participants were  randomized  at a ratio of 
1: 1 to receive  either BNT162b2 or placebo at their first vaccination visit and  then 
crossed  over to the alternative, four weeks  later and  were stratified  by age  (stratified 
as  12-17,  18-24, and  25-30 years of age).  Serum  samples were tested  for troponin 
before each  administration  of blinded  study intervention, 2 to  5 days after each 
administration, and  1 month after the second  administration. The  percentages of 
participants with  elevated  serum  troponin  I  levels in  participants aged  12 to 30  years 
who  had  received  2 or 3 prior doses of BNT162b2  (30-µg  doses)  showed  no  significant 
difference between  BNT162b2  30  µg  and  placebo. 
•  A total  of 9  and  7  participants (0.7% and  0.5%)  had  elevated  troponin  I  results 
at the  1-month visit (28-35 days)  after BNT162b2 and  placebo  vaccination, 
respectively. 
•  The  percentages of elevated troponin  I  results  were  similar between  the two 
vaccine groups (after BNT162b2  or after placebo)  across age  group, sex,  race, 
and  ethnicity subgroups.  In both  vaccine groups, the  percentages of elevated 
troponin  I  results were  generally higher in  younger age  groups (12-17 years) 
and  males. 
•  At the 4-day visit (2-5 days) after BNT162b2  or placebo,  the difference in 
percentage  of elevated  troponin  I  results  between  the 2 groups was  -0.5% 
(95% CI:  -1.1%, 0.2%), which  was  not statistically significant.  Similarly,  1 
month (28-35  days) after BNT162b2 or placebo, the difference of 0.2% (95% 
CI:  -0.3%, 0.7%)  in  the elevated troponin  I  results  between  the  2 groups was 
also  not statistically significant.

Other clinical trials 
During  this reporting  period,  there was  no  new relevant safety information  reported  from  other non 
Pfizer sponsored  clinical  trials/studies. 
Medication  errors 
Clinical  trial  data 
•  Number of cases:  none;  no  cases  were  retrieved  in  the  PSUR#4. 
Post-authorisation data 
From  the global  safety database,  11,362 cases  reporting  32,838 events (15.3% of 74,102 cases,  the 
total  PM  dataset for the  reporting  period)  indicative of potential  medication  errors were  retrieved 
compared  to  56,865  relevant cases  (20.1%) analysed  in  the PSUR#4. 
Among  the  medication  error cases  (11,362 cases),  compared  to  56,865  medication  errors in  the 
PSUR#4,  the following  scenarios,  categorised  according to the  EMA guidance "Good  practice guide on 
recording,  coding,  reporting  and  assessment of medication errors" (EMA/762563/2014) were 
described: 
•  Medication  errors associated  with  harm  [i.e.,  resulting  in  adverse  reaction(s)]:  360  cases 
(3.2%) compared  to  1670 cases  (2.9%)  in  the PSUR#4. 
•  Medication  errors without harm  [i.e.  not resulting  in  adverse  reaction(s)]:  10,995 cases 
(96.8%) compared to 55,167 (97.0%)  in  the PSUR#4. 
•  Potential  medication errors:  6 cases  (0.1%) compared  to 39  cases  (0.1%)  in  the PSUR#4. 
• 
Intercepted  medication  errors:  1 case  (0.001%) compared  to  3 cases  (0.01%) in  the  PSUR#4. 
MAH's conclusion: 
Overall, among the  11,362 relevant  medication  error PM  cases,  360 cases  (0.5% of the total  interval 
cases,  3.2% of total  relevant medication error cases)  were considered  harmful  because they were 
accompanied  by clinically  relevant co-reported  events. 
The  potential  for medication errors with all  vaccine  presentations are  mitigated through the information 
in  the vaccine  labelling and  available  educational  materials for the  HCPs  administering the vaccine. 
Some  medication  errors are  expected  to occur despite written instructions for handling  the vaccine  and 
educational  activities for the  HCPs  or due to national  or regional  recommendations  regarding  dosing 
schedules that may differ from  recommendations  in  the  product labelling. The  number and  seriousness 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment report 
EMA/PRAC/585967/2023 
Page  18/142 
of the  reported  medication  errors events do  not indicate there  is the  need  for any additional  mitigation 
activity to  prevent harm. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
Clinical  trial  data 
No  cases  indicative of a  medication error were  reported. 
Post-marketing  data 
During  the  reporting  period,  a slight increase of the  number of medication  errors resulting  in  adverse 
reaction(s)  has  been  reported,  i.e.  360 cases  (3.2%) as  compared to  1,670 cases  (2.9%)  in  the 
previous reporting  period.  However,  no  specific trend or pattern was  observed. 
No  new important safety information could  be  identified  regarding  reported  medication  errors.  Current 
risk minimisation  measures are considered  sufficient to  minimize the potential  for medications errors. 
1.3.5.4.  Non-clinical data 
During  the  reporting  period,  no  new non-clinical  safety findings  were  identified. 
1.3.5.5.  Literature 
Nonclinical  (Published) 
A search  of the Medline  and  Em base  databases identified  no  nonclinical  studies that presented 
important new safety findings for BNT162b2. 
Clinical  (Published) 
A search  of the Medline and  Embase  databases identified  no  clinical  trials that presented  important 
new safety findings for BNT162b2. 
However,  during the current reporting  period,  the  literature article "Safety monitoring  of bivalent 
COVID-19  mRNA vaccine  booster doses among children  aged  5-11  years  - United  States,  October 12-
January  1,  2023" (Hause AM,  Marquez P,  Zhang B,  et al.  Safety monitoring of bivalent COVID-19 
mRNA  vaccine  booster doses among children aged 5-11  years  - United States,  October 12-January 1, 
2023)  reported  important safety information about the use  of bivalent vaccines and  young  children. 
Hause  et al  state that no reports of myocarditis were  recorded  in  VAERS  by 01  January 2023  for the 
861,251  children  aged  5-11  years,  who received  a  bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech  booster in  the US  in  the 
same  period. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
The  MAH  identified  no  clinical  trials that presented  important new safety findings after Comirnaty 
exposure. 
For myocarditis,  one article was  retrieved  reporting  that no  cases  of myocarditis were  recorded  in 
VAERS  by 01  January 2023 for the 861,251  children  aged  5-11 years,  who received  a bivalent Pfizer

PRAC  PSUR  assessment report 
EMA/PRAC/585967/2023

sheds  light on  mechanisms of myocarditis with COVID-19  mRNA  vaccines,  and  implicates elevated 
circulating  spike  protein  as  a potential  cause  or marker of myocarditis.  However, further studies are 
needed  to elucidate the  reasons for and  effects of elevated  spike  protein  levels and  whether levels can 
be  monitored to adjust dose and  frequency and  mitigate individualised  risk.  In addition, studies are 
needed  for the identification of risk factors  (including genetic predisposition) and  potential  mechanisms 
and  reasons for sex- and  age-related  differences, as  well  as  the  long-term  impact of myocarditis after 
SARS-CoV-2  vaccination.  The  MAH  is  requested  to discuss the study of Yonker et al.  with a focus on 
the  possibilities to  mitigate individualized  risk on  myocarditis after Comirnaty exposure.  (Request for

Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C/-A) 
Introduction (Appendix 5.2  of the PSUR) 
In August 2021, the  EMA  issued  a signal  assessment report on  MIS-C with  SARS-CoV-2  vaccination  and 
requested  all  MAH  of these vaccines  perform cumulative  review of MIS-C and  MIS-A. 
A cumulative review  of cases  reported  within  MAH's global  safety database was  performed  with a  DLP  of 
02 September 2021.  Analysis of these cases,  in  conjunction  with observed to expected  analysis did  not 
support a causal  relationship  between  Comirnaty and  MIS-C/-A.  In concordance  with  MAH's assessment 
the PRAC  agreed that the signal  be  closed  and  that no update to the product information is  currently 
warranted. 
PRAC  requested  the  MAH  continue to closely  monitor MIS-C/-A and  report on  new cases  in  the  MSSR and 
PSUR.  Cases  were  requested  to be  assessed  using the  Brighton  Collaboration  (BC)  case  definition 1  with 
MIS-C defined  as  patients age  <21 years and  MIS-A those age ~21  years. 
Interval cases  have subsequently been  analysed  and  discussed  in  the following  aggregate safety 
documents: 
•  MSSR#ll (interval  03  September through  26 October 2021), 
•  SBSR#l  (interval  27 October through  15  December 2021)

is  a literature case  report from~- A  15-year-old boy  received  the first dose of 
COVID-19  mRNA vaccine  50  days after contracting  COVID-19.  On  the day after vaccination,  pyrexia, 
bulbar conjunctiva!  hyperaemia,  lip swelling,  and  diarrhoea developed,  with an  increase in  c-reactive 
protein  (CRP),  erythrocyte sedimentation  rate  (ESR),  and  D-dimer;  therefore,  the patient was  diagnosed 
with  MIS-C.  High-dose intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) therapy and  oral  administration of aspirin 
improved the patient's condition. 
MAH  comment: In this case,  on  the currently available data  the case  would be classified as BC level 4  -
the duration of fever is unknown and no measures of disease activity are reported.  It is noteworthy that 
this patient had COVID-19 infection  within 12 weeks of the onset of possible MIS-C;  given COVID-19 
infection is the currently known precipitant it is more likely that this is the cause in  this case. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
This  MIS-C case  reported  insufficient evidence to meet BC  level  1-3 and  therefore  it is agreed  that this 
case  is  considered  BC  level  4. 
BC  Level  1 cases:  definitive cases of MIS-C

Literature 
(multiple enlarged  lymph  nodes,  some  2 cm  in  diameter, with 
surrounding  soft tissue  inflammation).  He  was  prescribed  cephalexin 
for cellulitis.  He  returned  2 days later with fever (39.4°C)  and 
extension  of an  erythematous rash  to the anterolateral  left thorax and 
a new  pruritic macular rash  behind  both  knees  and  thighs.  He  had 
bilateral  conjunctivitis, dry cough,  and  nonbilious vomiting without 
source 5 
abdominal  pain.  He  denied  recent viral  illnesses or previous COVID-
19, known  contacts with  individuals with SARS-CoV-2  infection, skin 
trauma or foreign travel.  Cephalexin  was the only recent medication 
taken. 
He  was admitted and  treated  with IV vancomycin  and  cefazolin  after 
obtaining  blood  and  urine cultures.  He  developed  hypotension 
(systolic blood  pressure  70  mmHg,  unresponsive to intravenous (IV) 
fluids)  and  was transferred  to the  paediatric intensive care  unit (PICU) 
without requiring  inotropic support. Two  nasopharyngeal  SARS-CoV-2 
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain  reaction- nucleic acid 
amplification test (RT-PCR-NAAT)  were  negative. 
Within  24  hours he  developed  a generalised  rash,  cracked  lips and 
strawberry tongue.  Investigations revealed  marked  lymphopenia 
(nadir 0.52 xl0 9/I,  normal  range  (NR)  1.30-5.20), elevated  CRP  (peak 
201.5  mg/I,  NR  <5) and  very elevated  troponins (peak 11368.2 ng/1 
normal  high  range  17.5). Cefazolin  was  discontinued and  ceftriaxone 
was  begun  after drawing  another blood  culture.  The electrocardiogram 
(ECG)  suggested  pericarditis (generalised T-wave abnormalities)  but 
an  echocardiogram  (ECHO)  was  normal. A small  pleural  effusion  was 
seen  on  chest x-ray (CXR). 
He  was  diagnosed  with  MIS-C.  Other diagnoses considered  included 
Kawasaki  disease  (KD), toxic shock syndrome  (TSS),  Mycoplasma 
pneumonia  induced  rash  and  mucositis,  Steven-Johnson-Syndrome 
(SJS),  post-viral  (non  SARS-Cov-2)  perimyocarditis, adenoviral

was  negative. 
He  received  IVIg, methylprednisolone and  acetylsalicylic acid  (ASA). 
Blood  cultures were  negative.  He  did  not meet criteria  for a diagnosis 
of TSS.  Antibiotic therapy was  changed  to azithromycin and  was 
discontinued after a diagnosis of Mycoplasma  pneumoniae induced 
rash  and  mucositis and  SJS  was  excluded. 
Within  24  hours his clinical  state and  troponin  levels rapidly improved. 
Serial  ECGs,  ECHOs  and  CXRs  were  normal.  He  went home in  a stable 
condition  2 weeks after admission. Troponins normalised and  he 
remained  well  6 weeks  post discharge, at which  time ASA  was 
stopped. 
SARS-CoV-2  serological  testing  showed  presence of anti-spike 
antibodies and  absence of anti-nucleocapsid  antibodies. 
MAH comment 
Although meeting the diagnostic criteria for MIS-C it is noteworthy 
(and acknowledged by the article authors) that a bacterial infection 
could not be completely excluded given that the urine culture,  blood 
cultures and throat culture for beta haemolytic streptococci were 
taken after initiation of antibiotic therapy.  The patient's initial 
presentation  with axillary lymphadenopathy with cel/ulitic features 5 
weeks distant from  vaccination  could suggest an infective source. 
The  article authors also acknowledge that the case  could be Kawasaki 
disease  unrelated to SARS-CoV-2  vaccination  however they report 
that the older age and lymphopenia are atypical for KD. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
This  MIS-C case  is considered  BC  level  1 and  possible  related 
to Comirnaty exposure.

The  patient had  elevated  inflammatory markers;  white  blood  cell 
count (WBC)  15.55 x10 3/µI)  (NR 4.3-12.4), CRP  19.3 mg/di  (NR  <1) 
and  mildly elevated cardiac biomarkers,  brain  natriuretic protein 
(BNP)  103.7 pg/ml  (NR <100) and  troponin-I  0.036 ng/ml (NR <0.03) 
with evidence of SARS-CoV-2  infection  including  positive  PCR and 
anti-nucleocapsid antibody. 
The  authors report that although the  patient had  features of 
incomplete  Kawasaki  disease,  given a positive COVID-19 test on  both 
PCR and  anti-N  antibody, the child  met the CDC  case  definition for 
MIS-C and  was  diagnosed  as  such.  He  was treated  with IVIG, steroids 
(IV methylprednisolone  1 mg/kg for one day then  prednisone  1 mg/kg 
twice daily for 4  days) and  daily aspirin. 
ECHO  during the  initial  hospitalisation was  reassuring  with  normal 
cardiac function  and  no  coronary artery dilatation. There was  clinical 
improvement with  resolution  of symptoms and  he  discharged  home  on 
day 6 of the illness with  low-dose aspirin  for 6 weeks. 
A day after completing  the  prescribed  5-day steroid course the patient 
was  readmitted  (day 9) with  a slightly elevated  temperature  (100°F), 
fatigue,  cough,  faint blanching  macular rash  on  the chest and 
abdomen, conjunctivitis and  dry cracked  lips.  Laboratory studies were 
notable for elevations in  WBC  (25.6 x10 3/µI), CRP  (4.4mg/dl) and  D 
dimer (405ng/ml,  RR  0-220). Troponin  and  BNP  were  within  normal 
limits.  He  was  diagnosed  with  recrudescence  of MIS-C with  KD 
features and  started on  IV methlyprednisolone  (1  mg/kg  12 hourly) 
and  low-dose aspirin  with  resolution  of symptoms.  ECHO  on  day  10 
was  significant for new,  moderately dilated coronary arteries with  no 
obvious aneurysms and  the patient was  promptly given a second  dose 
of IVIg following  which  he  remained  afebrile.  On  day  13 he  was 
discharged  with a 2-week taper of prednisolone and  low-dose aspirin. 
Until day 19 of illness he  took 1 mg/kg of prednisolone twice daily. 
On  day 20, the  patient started  a planned  taper of prednisolone  (1 
mg/kg once  daily).  He  then  presented  with  tactile fever,  dry cracked 
lips, conjunctivitis and  abdominal  pain  on  day 22.  Inflammatory

markers  had  increased  since  previous discharge.  ECHO  was  significant 
for severe dilatation to  his coronary arteries:  right coronary artery 
(RCA)  4.5 mm and  left anterior descending  (LAD)  artery 6.7  mm.  He 
was  admitted for the third time and  began  treatment for refractory 
MIS-C with  infliximab and  IV methlyprednisolone  (30mg/kg daily) for 
5 days.  As  the  LAD  dimensions met criteria  for a giant coronary 
aneurysm  he  was  also  given enoxaparin  per the American  Heart 
Association  Kawasaki  guidelines. 
On  day 24  ECHO  continued  to show severe  coronary artery dilatation, 
most significantly for the  LAD  (4.4 mm).  His  inflammatory markers 
and  clinical  course  improved  and  he  was  discharged on  day 27  on 
enoxaparin, daily aspirin  and  a 30-day steroid taper. 
Nearly a month  after discharge,  on  day 55,  the  patient remained 
asymptomatic but his  inflammatory markers  began  increasing  (CRP 
11.1  mg/di) and  his steroid  taper was  further extended. 
On  day 64 a repeat ECHO  showed  improvement in  the  diffuse 
coronary artery dilatation to the  mildly dilated  range,  except for the 
LAD  artery in the moderate range.  A cardiac CT on  day 94  showed 
mild  RCA  dilatation with  3 small- to  medium-sized  RCA  aneurysms in 
the distal  segment not seen  on  ECHO.  The  left main coronary artery 
and  LAD  were  improved to  normal  except for aneurysmal dilatation  at 
the  LAD  at the  level  of the first diagonal  branch  take off (as seen  on 
ECHO). 
On  day  112 the  prednisolone was  discontinued and  on  day  117 his 
inflammatory markers were  notably improved with  CRP<l  mg/di.  His 
last echo on  day  139 prior to article submission  showed  slight 
improvement. 
MAH comment 
It is  noteworthy that on  the initial admission, although meeting the 
CDC criteria  for MIS-C the patient would have been classified as 
Brighton Collaboration level 2b  - only 1  measure of disease activity 
reported (elevated cardiac biomarkers, no differential of the white 
blood cell count is provided).  This  case is reported in  the context of 
positive PCR  for SARS-CoV-2,  positive anti-nuc/eocapsid antibody and

within 55 days  of a symptomatic COVID-19 illness.  Given  that SARS 
CoV-2 is  the current known precipitant of MIS-Cit is  more likely the 
cause in  this case. 
The  authors acknowledge in the report unusual features of this case; 
the development of "delayed giant coronary artery aneurysms" and 
"multiple recrudescent episodes following steroid taper".  Although 
coronary artery changes have been seen  in  cases of MIS,  the 
prominence in  this case is suggestive of an alternative diagnosis of 
Kawasaki disease.  It is noted that approximately 30% of KD patients 
may have coronary artery dilatation at diagnosis,  however frank 
aneurysms may not be seen  until after day 10 of illness/ No 
differential of the white blood cell count is  reported and there is  a 
thrombocytosis which  is perhaps more in  keeping  with KD  than  the 
thrombocytopenia often seen  in  MIS. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
This  MIS-C case  is considered  BC  level  1  and  unlikely related 
to Comirnaty exposure due to a  positive  PCR  for SARS-CoV-2

inferior vena  cava  was  collapsed  on  bedside  ECHO.  IV bicarbonate and 
fluid  resuscitation  were  commenced  with  inotropes and  broad 
spectrum antibiotics. The  patient's mental status fully recovered  after 
7 hours of emergency management.  His  abdomen  was  distended  with 
hypoactive  bowel  sounds and  generalised  tenderness.  Abdominal 
radiography and  CT  revealed  severe  paralytic ileus with  multifocal 
hypo-enhancing  areas  in the  liver and  spleen.  A nasogastric tube was 
inserted  and  oral  intake stopped. 
Although  the  patient did  not have fever or respiratory symptoms  his 
COVID-19  PCR  result was  positive;  he  was  commenced  on  remdesivir 
and  dexamethasone.  He  was  weaned  off ventilator support after 11 
hours and  received  respiratory support via  nasal  cannula.  He  was 
admitted to an  isolation  ward  for further management. 
During  the first 4 days of hospitalisation the absolute  lymphocyte 
count and  platelet count decreased  to  173/ul and  49,000/ul 
respectively.  AST and  ALT  increased  to 447 IU/L and  188 IU/L 
respectively,  total  bilirubin  increased  to  1.8 mg/di.  His  serum  albumin 
level  was  as  low as  2.1  g/dl and  the CRP  peaked  at 33.87  mg/di. On 
hospital day 4 the  patient started  passing  loose  mucoid  stool  7 times 
per day and  had  persistent diffuse tenderness over the distended 
abdomen.  These  abdominal  symptoms and  laboratory findings 
gradually improved and  the  nasogastric tube was  removed  and  oral 
feeding  carefully started on  hospital day 7.  Remdesivir was 
administered for 5 days and  dexamethasone  10 days (discontinued 
without tapering).  No  organisms were  isolated  in  the  blood  or stool 
cultures. 
On  hospital day 15 the  patient suddenly developed  fever up to  39.3°C 
and  started  having  watery diarrhoea  6 times per day. The  following 
day his  blood  pressure dropped to 87/50 mmHg and  heart rate  rose  to 
103 bpm,  hence  he  was  started  on  a continuous infusion of 
norepinephrine. The  patient did  not have a  rash  or conjunctiva!

diagnosed  with  MIS-C based  on  CDC  criteria. 
On  hospital day 17, fever and  diarrhoea  improved without the 
administration of immunosuppressants and  norepinephrine was 
discontinued as  his vital  signs stabilised.  Lab  values gradually 
normalised. The  patient was  discharged  on  hospital  day 24 without 
any complications and  remained  healthy at 1 week follow-up. 
MAH comment 
There  are two phases of illness described;  the first presumed COVID-
19 and the second reported to be MIS.  This  second episode  would be 
classified as BC level one on  the basis of a fever duration 3  days, 
clinical features of diarrhoea and hypotension,  elevated inflammatory 
markers with lymphopenia and elevated BNP. 
During the initial, presumed COVID-19 episode there is a comment of 
"multifocal hypo-enhancing areas in  the liver and spleen" without 
further evaluation of the aetiology.  In combination  with elevated 
transaminases and a markedly low albumin level there could be an 
alternative infectious source/pathology involved.  Also the initial illness 
was marked by diarrhoea and abdominal tenderness as  was  the 
second "MIS" episode,  although stool cultures were negative there is 
no further evaluation on  the aetiology of the diarrhoea. 
Given  COVID-19 infection is  the current known aetiology of MIS-Cit is 
more likely that this  would be  the underlying cause in  this case  than 
vaccination. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
This  MIS-C case  is considered  BC  level  1 and  unlikely related 
to Comirnaty exposure due to a positive  PCR  for SARS-CoV-2. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
The  3  MIS-C BC  level  1 cases  were considered  possible  related  to Comirnaty exposure (n= 1) or unlikely 
related  (n=2).

leukocyturia, erythrocyturia, and  bacteriuria,  with  two urine cultures being 
negative, and  no  other obvious microbial cause  of inflammation was 
found,  including  a nasopharyngeal culture and  two  blood  cultures for 
bacterial  sepsis.  Authors additionally performed tests for toxoplasmosis, 
rubella,  cytomegalovirus, and  herpes simplex,  which  were  all  negative,  but 
authors did  not exclude other viral  infections,  such  as  influenza, 
adenoviruses,  or enteroviruses. 
ECG,  ECHO  and  CXR were all  performed. The  first ECG  showed  a slight 
elevation  in  the ST  segments in  leads I  and  II and  ECHO  showed 
ventricular dysfunction with a shortening  fraction  of 24% and  an  ejection 
fraction  (EF)  of 44%. CXR  showed  a slightly enlarged  cardiac silhouette 
and  congestion  of the  pulmonary vessels. 
The  patient's clinical  condition  worsened  about 8  hours after admission 
with chest  pain  and  hypotension. A second  ECG  revealed  pericardia!  lead 
ST  segment elevation  and  ECHO  showed  myocardial  hypocontractility with 
a severe decrease in  ventricular EF  below  30%.  Cardiac enzymes were 
elevated  compared  to the first measurement;  troponin  I  from  0.18 to 6.37 
(NR 0-0.04ng/ml).  A continuous infusion of noradrenalin was  initiated 
which  improved the blood  pressure and  heart rate. 
After about  16 hours the  patient's condition  worsened  with decreased 
blood  saturation  and  signs of heart failure with  pulmonary vascular 
congestion.  Supportive respiratory care  was  provided  for 24  hours with 
continuous positive airway pressure  (CPAP)  and  rehydration  maintained 
with fluids,  diuretics and  inotropes (dopamine and  noradrenalin).  CXR also 
showed  atelectasis at the  left lower lobe  "as a result of cut-off of the  lower 
left lobar bronchus (mucus plug)". 
The authors report that as  clinical,  laboratory and  additional examinations 
revealed  that the  patient met the  MIS-C criteria  they initiated treatment 
with corticosteroids and  immunoglobulin. Anticoagulation  therapy with 
enoxaparin  was  also administered  due to  high  D-Dimer levels. 
About 48  hours  later, inflammatory parameters began to decrease  and 
condition  gradually improved;  however inotropic support with  continuous 
reduction  was  required  for  10 days due to  low ventricular EF  and 
hypotension.  Pulmonary function  was  improved and  blood  oxygen 
saturation was  effectively maintained with  nasal  oxygen.

On  the  16th day of hospital admission  almost all  laboratory tests were 
within  the  normal  range as  well  as  ECG,  ECHO,  lung  and  abdominal 
ultrasound examinations and  the patient was  discharged  home with 
recommendation  of using  aspirin  80  mg/day for four weeks. 
During  follow-up outpatient visits the  patient's general condition  remained 
stable and  blood test including cardiac enzymes as well  as  ECG  and  echo 
were  normalised. 
MAH comment - This  case is  categorised as BC /eve/ 2b given no body 
temperature is reported (fever is subjective) and the duration of fever 
appears to be 2  days. 
The  patient is  positive for anti-nuc/eocapsid antibodies and therefore an 
association of MIS-C with SARS-CoV-2 infection  cannot be ruled out.  In 
addition,  the authors acknowledge that the possibility of an  undetected 
infection  contributing to the case  cannot be ruled out as testing for other 
viral infections such  as influenza,  adenoviruses,  or enteroviruses was  not 
performed.

RT-PCR-NAAT  were  negative.  CXR,  ECG,  and  ECHO  were  normal. The 
authors report that BC  level  1 criteria  for MIS-C were  met. 
SARS-CoV-2  serology detected anti-spike  but not anti-nucleocapsid 
antibodies.  He  was  admitted  and  treated  with IVIG and  ASA.  He  quickly 
became  afebrile and  was  discharged from  the  hospital  3 days  later. 
On  follow-up a week after discharge,  mild dilatation  of the right distal 
coronary artery was  noted, which  normalized 4  weeks  later along  with the 
remaining  blood  work.  ASA  was  stopped  after 6 weeks of treatment. The 
authors concluded  that the patient had  MIS-vaccination and  will  receive 
longitudinal subspecialty follow-up and  will  be  exempted from further 
SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. 
MAH comment - On  the basis of the reported information,  with a fever 
duration  of 1 day this case has been  categorised as BC level 2b.  Although 
meeting the diagnostic criteria for MIS-Cit is noteworthy (and 
acknowledged by the article authors) that a bacterial infection  could not 
be completely excluded given  that one of the blood cultures was  taken 
after initiation of antibiotic therapy,  and no throat swab for bacterial 
culture was  taken.  The  article authors also acknowledge that the case 
could be Kawasaki disease  unrelated to SARS-CoV-2  vaccination  however 
they report that the older age and lymphopenia are atypical for KD.

The  patient had  severe  mixed  cardiogenic and  vasodilatory shock, 
hypoxaemic respiratory failure and  oliguric kidney  injury. On  hospital  day 
2 he  required  intubation, extracorporeal  membrane oxygenation  (ECMO) 
and  continuous renal  replacement therapy. The authors report that he  had 
multi-organ failure and  cytokine storm with  unremarkable  infectious and 
autoimmune workup and  that the patient met the criteria  for MIS-C.  He 
received  broad  antibiotic cover, IVIG, steroids and  anakinra.  His  cardiac 
function  improved,  he  was  decannulated from  ECMO  after 7 days and 
discharged  to acute  rehab on  day 29  with complete  cardiopulmonary and 
renal  recovery. 
MAH comment - This  case does not report the latency from  vaccination  to 
the onset of the events.  The  BC diagnostic criteria for MIS include a time 
frame of <12 weeks from SARS-CoV-2 infection/exposure/vaccination.  In 
this patient the temporal association is  with  the symptomatic, PCR  positive 
SARS-CoV-2  infection.  Given  that COVID-19 is the current known 
precipitant of MIS this is  the most likely cause in  this case. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
This  MIS-C case  is considered  BC  level  2b and  unlikely related  to 
Comirnaty exposure due to a SARS-CoV-2  infection  2 weeks 
before presentation of complaints.

The  3 MIS-C  BC  level  2b cases  were considered  possible  related  to Comirnaty exposure  (n=l) or unlikely 
related  (n=2). 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
During  the reporting  period,  the  MAH  identified  a total  of 9  potential  new MIS-C cases.  Of these,  3 were 
classified  as  BC  level  1, 4  as  BC  level  2  (of which  1 case  was  reported  and  assessed  in  the previous 
interval  period),  0 as  BC  level  3,  2 as  BC  level  4, and  O as  BC  level  5. 
Of the 3 new MIS-C  BC  level  1 cases,  1 case  was  considered  possible  related  to Comirnaty exposure and 
2 cases  unlikely related. 
Of the  3 new MIS-C BC  level  2b cases,  1 case  was considered  possible  related  to Comirnaty exposure and 
2 cases  unlikely related. 
MIS-A 
Forty-two cases  were  in  patients aged  greater than  or equal  to 21  years and  were classified  in 
consideration  of MIS-A.  Four cases  reported  such  insufficient information as  to  preclude  BC  classification. 
Eight of the 42 cases  were  retrieved  for BNT162b2  Bivalent (Original  and  Omicron  BA.4/BA.5)  and  three 
cases for BNT162b2  Bivalent (Original and  Omicron  BA.1).

During  the reporting  period,  the  MAH  identified  a total  of 42 potential  new  MIS-A cases  (of which  3 cases 
after Comirnaty Original/Omicron  BA.1,  8 cases  Comirnaty Original/Omicron  BA.4-5).  Of these,  0  cases 
were classified  as  BC  level  1,  0 as  BC  level  2,  0 as  BC  level  3,  15 as  BC  level  4,  and  23  as  BC  level  5. 
MAH's conclusion 
In summary,  55  cases  were analysed  for potential  MIS  for the PSUR  period  19 December 2022 through 
18 June 2023. 
Seven  cases  were classified  as  BC  Level  1-3 MIS-C cases  and  there were  no  BC  level  1-3 MIS-A cases.  In 
three of the cases  a temporal association  with  SARS-COV-2  infection was the more  likely cause  of the 
MIS-C than vaccination  and  in  a further case  positive for anti-nucleocapsid antibodies an  anteceding 
SARS-CoV-2  infection as  the cause  cannot be  ruled  out.  In two cases,  from  the same  literature source6, 
an  atypical  Kawasaki  Disease  or bacterial  sepsis could  not be  excluded  as  differential  diagnoses. 
Considering the totality of the data, including the  number of reports received  in  the context of the billions 
of doses of vaccine administered, the MAH  does not consider that the currently available information 
supports a causal  association  between  MIS-C/A and  Comirnaty.  No  updates to current labelling or the 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment report 
EMA/PRAC/585967 /2023

Risk  Management Plan  are warranted  at this time.  Routine  pharmacovigilance on  this topic will  continue 
and  further updates will  be  provided  if warranted. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
MIS-C 
During  the reporting  period,  the MAH  identified  a total  of 9  potential  new MIS-C cases.  Of these,  3 were 
classified  as  BC  level  1,  4  as  BC  level  2  (of which  1 case  was  reported  and  assessed  in  the previous 
interval  period),  0 as  BC  level  3,  2 as  BC  level  4,  and  O as  BC  level  5. 
Of the 3 new MIS-C  BC  level  1 cases,  1 case  was  considered  possible  related  to Comirnaty exposure and 
2 cases  unlikely related. 
Of the 3 new MIS-C BC  level  2b  cases,  1 case  was considered  possible  related  to Comirnaty exposure and 
2 cases  unlikely related. 
Cumulatively,  there are  2  MIS-CBC level  1 cases  (Danish  index case  and  literature case  from  New 
Zealand)  which  are considered  probably related  to Comirnaty exposure,  but considering  the extensive 
exposure of Comirnaty (in  children)  this is  not unexpected  and  does  not present a new safety concern. 
MIS-A 
During  the reporting  period,  the MAH  identified  a total  of 42  potential  new  MIS-A cases  (of which  3 cases 
after Comirnaty Original/Omicron  BA.1,  8 cases  Comirnaty Original/Omicron  BA.4-5).  Of these,  0 cases 
were classified  as  BC  level  1,  0 as  BC  level  2,  0 as  BC  level  3,  15 as  BC  level  4,  and  23  as  BC  level  5. 
Cumulatively,  two BC  level  1 MIS-A cases  (MIS-A BC  level  1 case  from  the 3rd  PSUR and  1 case  from  the 
4th  PSUR)  are considered  probably related  with Comirnaty,  due to the absence  of other aetiologies or 
confounding.  However,  given the extensive exposure of Comirnaty in  adults this is  not considered 
unexpected and  does  not present a new safety concern. 
Based  on  the data  provided,  no  new important information could  be  identified  concerning  MIS-C/-A. The 
data  is  currently insufficient to support regulatory action  and  therefore  no  update of the  product 
information  in  relation to MIS-C/-A is currently warranted. 
The  MAH  should  continue  monitoring  MIS-C/-A cases  after Comirnaty exposure using  routine 
pharmacovigilance and  notify the  PRAC  Rapporteur immediately when  unexpected  numbers or (changes 
in)  patterns of MIS-C/-A cases  are  reported.

Dyspnoea;  Palpitations, Tachycardia/Heart Rate Increase 
Response  to the  PRAC  request  5 from the 4th  PSUR  (EMENH/C/PSUSA/00010898/202212): 
The  MAH should present a case  level analysis for all cumulative positive rechallenge  cases of 
dyspnoea,  palpitations and tachycardia/heart rate increase  with a duration of the events not 
considered stress/anxiety-related reactions,  including cases  with a  TTO  of <2 days.  The  MAH 
should discuss  whether these events should be added in section 4.8 of the Comirnaty SmPC and 
PIL  accordingly. 
MAH's  response  (Appendix 5.3  of the PSUR): 
Methodology 
A search  of the safety database cumulatively through  18 June  2023 was  conducted  for all  BNT162b2 
vaccines  (original  and  bivalent presentations)  for cases  where these events were  reported  after at least 2 
unique doses of the vaccine:  PTs  (MedDRA v.  26.0):  Dyspnoea,  Palpitations, Tachycardia,  Heart rate 
increased.  These  cases  were considered  the "positive rechallenge cases" per the  PRAC  request. 
It is  worth  noting that the concept of dechallenge/rechallenge is typically more  relevant to medications 
rather than  preventative vaccines;  consequently the safety database is  configured  in  such  a way that 
dechallenge/rechallenge data fields are  not available for vaccination-associated  ICSRs.  Therefore,  this 
analysis was  performed  retrieving  the date of each  vaccination  dose and the onset date of the associated 
AE(s). 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
The  MAH's choice  is  not accepted  to configure the safety database  in  such  a way that 
dechallenge/rechallenge data fields are  not available for vaccination-associated  ICSRs  [based  on  the 
MAH's  rationale that the concept of challenge/rechallenge  is  'typically more relevant to medications rather 
than  preventative vaccines']. 
Information regarding  dechallenge/rechallenge  in  relation  to  (re)occurrence of the observed AEs  is  an 
essential  aspect of causality assessment. 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment report 
EMA/PRAC/585967 /2023 
Page  43/142 
Although  it is  acknowledged  that dechallenge  information  might be  less  relevant for vaccines,  consistently 
observed  positive  rechallenges  (i.e.,  after multiple primary/booster doses)  do  provide supportive evidence 
for a causal  role  of the vaccine. 
Note that also for medications dechallenge/rechallenge  information could  be  either relevant/informative, 
or not,  depending  on  the PK/PD  and  suspected  adverse drug  reaction.  Relevance  should  be  decided  on 
case-by-case  basis.  Not systematically/routinely documenting  dechallenge/rechallenge information up 
front based  on  the  MAH's  gross generalisation, would  seriously hamper causality assessment,  hence 
regulatory authority review. 
Dyspnoea 
Search  criteria  - PT:  Dyspnoea. 
Cumulatively through  18 June  2023,  67,974 cases  reporting the  PT  Dyspnoea  were  retrieved.  Of these, 
1079 cases  (1.6%) were  positive rechallenge cases  for 503  unique individuals.  Of note, the  1079 cases 
were comprised  of 1145 events of dyspnoea  that were  reported  with  2  up  to  5 doses of the vaccine. 
These  cases  originated from  PM  sources;  271  cases  were  MC  and  808  NMC.  Case  details for the  1079 
cases are available in  Appendix  1 -Table  1 of the PSUR  (not reproduced  here). 
Case  data/demographics related  to the  503  unique  individuals: 
•  Reported  gender:  female  (329),  male (159) and  unknown  (15). 
•  Reported  age  in  years  (n  =  471),  range:  2-95,  mean:  48.6,  median:  49.0. 
•  Country most frequently reported  (>3%):  Germany (182), UK  (52),  Norway (50),  Denmark (36), 
France  (26),  Sweden  (23),  Finland  (19). 
•  Medical  history (n  =  245):  the most frequently(>  8)  reported  relevant medical  conditions 
included Asthma  and  Hypertension  (37 each),  Seasonal  allergy  (35),  Hypersensitivity (19), 
Chronic obstructive  pulmonary disease and  Depression  (13 each),  Hypothyroidism,  Migraine, and 
Pain  (12 each), Allergy to animal  (11),  Drug  hypersensitivity (10),  Fibromyalgia, 
Hypercholesterolemia, and  Mite allergy  (9 each). 
•  COVID-19  Medical  history (n  =  35):  COVID-19  (24), Suspected  COVID-19  (11) and  Post-acute 
COVID-19  syndrome  (3). 
Out of the  1145 events of dyspnoea  involving  503  individuals,  one third of the events  (384,  33.5%) of the 
events was  serious;  301  (26.3%) of the events were  recovering/recovered  (with  and  without sequelae). 
Out of the  503  individuals, 89  individuals reported  latency from  each  vaccine dose to dyspnoea  for at 
least 2 doses.  Latency  in  these  individuals ranged  from  the day of vaccination  to  501  days following 
vaccination. 
The  cases  most likely to be  stress or anxiety reactions to vaccination  are those with a  latency within  1-2 
days of vaccination.  There were  57  individuals with  such  a latency for at least one of the occurrences of 
dyspnoea,  however 9 of these  had  disparate  latencies for each  vaccination  dose  (e.g.,  Dl latency O days 
and  D2  latency 26  days), suggesting that a dissimilar condition  was  occurring  after each  dose  despite the 
reported  PT  being  the same.  Most of the 57  individuals with  latencies within  2 days of vaccination  did  not 
provide information  on  the duration  of dyspnoea.  When  provided  (n= 18), the dyspnoea  lasted  from  15 
minutes to  264 days. 
There were  32  individuals with  latencies  >3 days from  vaccination  (range of 4  days to  501  days).  A 
minority (9)  individuals had  latency of at least one of the dyspnoea  events occur between  3 and  7  days 
from  dosing  but the remaining  had  larger latencies making  it less  likely a relationship  between 
vaccination  and  the events was  causal.

MAH's conclusion 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment report 
EMA/PRAC/585967 /2023 
Page  45/142 
Overall,  of the individuals with  recurrent dyspnoea  following  vaccination  and  sufficient data  on  latency 
and  duration  of the events,  most events of dyspnoea  had  an  onset close to the time of vaccination  and 
lasting  less than  2 weeks. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
Concerning  dyspnoea, cumulatively retrieved  were  67,974 post-marketing cases.  Of these,  1079 cases 
(1.6%) were  positive  rechallenge cases  for 503  unique individuals. 
Out of the  503  individuals,  13 reported  both  duration and  latency of their events of dyspnoea  of which 
most events of dyspnoea  had  an  onset close  to the time of vaccination  and  lasting  less than  2 weeks. 
There were  57  individuals with a latency within  2 days for at least one of the occurrences of dyspnoea. 
Most (68%) of the  57  individuals with  latencies within  2 days of vaccination  did  not provide information 
on  the duration  of dyspnoea. 
Taking  into account the relative  low  number of rechallenge/recurrent dyspnoea  reports and  the  high 
Comirnaty exposure,  the rechallenge/recurrent dyspnoea events are considered  not unexpected  and 
coincidence  reports. 
Based  on  the data  provided,  no new important information could  be  identified  concerning  dyspnoea. 
There  is  not sufficient evidence to conclude a causal  association  between  dyspnoea and  Comirnaty 
exposure. 
Palpitations 
Search  criteria  - PTs:  Palpitations. 
Cumulatively through  18 June  2023,  37,311  cases  reporting the  PT  Palpitations were  retrieved.  Of these,

Out of the 91  individuals,  only 20 provided  latency data  after each  of the 2 doses.  Latency in  these 
individuals  ranged  from  the day of vaccination  to  251  days following  vaccination. 
There were  13 individuals with a latency within  1-2 days of vaccination  for at least one of the occurrences

MAH's conclusion 
Overall,  the incomplete  nature of the data does not allow  better characterisation  of the event or 
substantiate that palpitations are causally  related  to the vaccine. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
Concerning  palpitations, cumulatively retrieved  were  37,311  post-marketing  cases.  Of these,  173  (0.5%) 
were  positive rechallenge cases  for 91  unique individuals. 
Out of the 91  individuals, only 33  provided  palpitation  duration  data for both  of the  palpitation  events, 
and  2 of the individuals also  had  latency information. 
There were  13 individuals with a latency within  1-2 days of vaccination  for at least one of the occurrences 
of palpitations. 
The  incomplete data of the retrieved  palpitations cases  hampered  causality assessment. 
Based  on  the data  provided,  no new important information could  be  identified  concerning  palpitations. 
There  is  not sufficient evidence to conclude a causal  association  between  palpitations and  Comirnaty 
exposure.

The  224 cases  were  comprised  of 235  events  of tachycardia  (128)  and  heart  rate  increased  (107) that 
were  reported  with  2,  3 or 4  doses  of the vaccine.  These  224 cases  involved  106 individuals.  All  cases

MAH's conclusion 
Overall,  the  incomplete  nature of the data does  not allow  better characterization  of the events 
tachycardia  or increased  heart rate or substantiate that they are causally  related  to the vaccine. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
Concerning  tachycardia  and/or heart rate increased, cumulatively retrieved  were 42,530 post-marketing 
cases.  Of these,  224 (0.5%) were  positive  rechallenge cases  (comprised  235  events of tachycardia  [128] 
and  heart rate  increased  [107]) for unique  106 individuals. 
Out of the  106 individuals, for only  12 both  latency and  duration  data  were available. 
Out of the  106 individuals,  38 individuals had  a short latency of 0-2 days. 
The  incomplete data of the retrieved  tachycardia  and/or heart rate  increased  cases  hampered  causality 
assessment. 
Based  on  the data  provided,  no  new important information could  be  identified  concerning  tachycardia 
and/or heart rate increased.  There is  not sufficient evidence to conclude a causal  association  between 
tachycardia  and/or heart rate increased  and  Comirnaty exposure. 
MAH's overall conclusion 
A further review of details at the case  level for cumulative  rechallenge/recurrent cases  of dyspnea, 
palpitations and  tachycardia/heart rate  increased  after vaccination  was  performed. 
All  times to onset and  event durations were  included.  While  many events were  reported,  a  relatively small 
proportion of them were  recurrent cases.  A still  smaller proportion of those contained  adequate  latency 
and  duration  data for assessment.  Of these,  the majority of reports  have times to onset that are close to 
vaccination  and  durations that are short. 
The further analysis revealed  little new  information  and  none with enough  strength of evidence to add  as 
adverse  reactions to section  4.8 Undesirable effects of the Comirnaty Sm PC.  These events will  continue to 
be  monitored with  routine  pharmacovigilance. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
MAH's  conclusion  is  endorsed that based  on  the current available  information, a causal  association  of 
dyspnoea,  palpitations, tachycardia  and/or increased  heart rate with  Comirnaty is  not supported.  No 
changes to the  product information is  warranted and  routine pharmacovigilance  should  be  continued.

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) 
Response  to the  EMA  request (21  Jul  2023): 
It has come to our attention on accumulating literature articles on hemophagocytic 
lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)  with  COVID-19 vaccines,  and more particularly on  a new hypothesis of 
a possible involvement of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)  reactivation.  Some case  reports describing 
EBV-positive HLH after COVID-19  vaccination  have been  recently published (Arand et al., 2023; 
Takana  et al.,  2023;  Lin  et al., 2022;  Tang  et al., 2021).  We  would ask to further discuss  this 
topic in  the upcoming PSUR,  and particularly any new data from  the literature. 
MAH's  response  (Appendix 5.5  of the  PSUR) 
Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)  is  a syndrome of defective apoptosis,  a disruption of the 
regulatory pathway that terminates immune and  inflammatory responses  and  results  in  excessive 
immune activation.  HLH  can  be  induced  by genetic disorders (familial)  or environmental  causes.  Familial 
HLH  is  rare,  while environmental causes  in  adults include infection  (most commonly  EBV),  autoimmunity, 
HIV infection and  malignancy.  HLH  in  adults may be  confused  with  or misdiagnosed  as  sepsis,  mainly due 
to similar clinical  manifestations and  the  lack of specific clinical  and  laboratory findings for its diagnosis. 
HLH's  immune dysregulation with  unchecked  inflammation  leads to the typical  clinical  presentation of 
fever,  cytopenia,  splenomegaly,  and/or hemophagocytosis;  ferritin  >500 mcg/L and  soluble  CD25 
elevation.  HLH  is  treated  with  immunosuppressive agents and/or chemotherapy.  Treatment of pediatric 
HLH  with  multi-agent chemotherapy can  be  applied  in  adult patients,  although  the  dose  and  type of drug 
need  to  be  adjusted.  It is  highly recommended  that allogenic hematopoietic stem cell  transplantation 
should  be  used  in  patients who  become  reactivated  or are  refractory to the initial treatment as  soon  as 
possible to improve survival. 1,2

Rapporteur assessment comment: 
Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis  (HLH)  is  an  aggressive  and  life-threatening  syndrome of excessive 
immune activation.  It most frequently affects infants from  birth to  18 months of age,  but the disease  is 
also  observed  in  children  and  adults of all  ages.  HLH  can  occur as  a familial  or sporadic disorder,  and  it 
can  be  triggered  by a variety of events that disrupt immune homeostasis.  Infection  is a common trigger 
both  in  those with  a genetic predisposition and  in  sporadic cases.  Clinical  features and  diagnosis of 
hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis - UpToDate 
Prompt treatment is  critical,  but the greatest barrier to a successful  outcome  is often a delay in  diagnosis 
due to the rarity of this syndrome,  variable clinical  presentation,  and  lack of specificity of the clinical  and 
laboratory findings.  If left untreated,  patients with  HLH  survive for only a few  months,  due to progressive 
multi-organ failure Treatment and  prognosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis - UpToDate 
Literature 
A cumulative  search  of literature was  conducted  through  23  July 2023,  to identify articles describing 
BNT162b2 and the MedDRA  PT  Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in  the  Medline,  Biosis and  Embase 
database. 
The  search  revealed  11  relevant case  reports including Tanaka 3 .  Lin4  was  included  in  the last signal 
evaluation. Two of the 4  articles cited  by EMA  PRAC,  Arand 5  did  not specify the COVID-19 vaccine  and 
Tang 6,  reported  an  inactivated COVID-19 vaccine  case  in  China  and  will  not be  discussed  further. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
A literature search  revealed  11  relevant case  reports which  included Takana  et al.  (2023) sited  by the 
EMA  as  one of the four recently  published  articles,  please  refer to case  report  3 below. 
The  MAH  stated  that the publication  of Lin  et al.  (2022) was  included  in  the  last signal  evaluation. 
However,  in  the  previous PSURs  no  evaluation of the  publication  of Lin  et al.  (2022)  seems to  be 
included.  Lin  et al  (2022) reported  a case  of a  14 year old  previously healthy girl  with  HLH  after dose  1 
(TTO  15  days). The  authors concluded  that the HLH  could  be  the  net result of both acute 
immunostimulation after COVID-19 vaccination  and  EBV  infection and  suggested  that the  immune 
activation after COVID-19 vaccination  is  likely to interfere with  the adequate  immune response to certain 
infectious pathogens,  resulting  in  a hyperinflammatory syndrome. Therefore,  the case  is  considered 
possible  related  to Comirnaty exposure. 
The two  remaining  publications cited  by the EMA,  Arand  et al.  (2023)  and  Tang  et al.  (2021), were 
considered  not relevant publications by the  MAH  because Arand  et al.  did  not specify the  mRNA COVID-19 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment report 
EMA/PRAC/585967 /2023 
Page  51/142 
vaccine and  Tang  et al.  reported  an  inactivated  COVID-19 vaccine case  in  China.  For the study of Arand 
et al.  this is  not accepted  because a mRNA  COVID-19 vaccine  was  reported  and  therefore of relevance for 
Comirnaty:  Literature case  report of a  17 year old  male with  Epstein-Barr virus-associated  HLH  after dose 
2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine  (TIO 2 weeks)  which  is  considered  possible  related  to  mRNA COVID-19 
vaccine exposure. 
Case  report 1: Simpson  et.al: A Case  of a Relapsing Remitting Macrophage Activating Syndrome After 
Covid-19 Vaccine In a  Teenager with  UNC13D Heterozygous Variant of Uncertain Significance.7 
A  15-year-old previously  healthy female developed  fatigue,  fevers,  myalgia,  chest pain,  splenomegaly 
and  lymphadenopathy  10 days after receiving  her first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.  Her symptoms recurred 
10 days after receiving  the second  dose.  Her myocarditis,  MIS-C,  and  infectious work up was  negative 
except for positive  EBV  IgG.  Laboratory studies  revealed  anemia,  hypertriglyceridemia, 
hypofibrinogenemia,  and  hyperferritinemia.  She  initially responded  to decadron;  however,  her symptoms 
recurred  with  steroid taper.  Bone  marrow biopsy  revealed  hemophagocytosis.  Whole  exome sequencing 
(WES)  revealed  a heterozygous variant of uncertain significance  in  UNC13D  c.962C>A (p.Thr321Asn). 
She  had  multiple re-admissions with significantly elevated  inflammatory markers,  including  IL2-R, IL-18 
and  CXCL9.  Each  episode was  complicated  by an  acute viral  infection.  She  responded  to  high dose 
steroids,  anti-lL-1, and  JAK  inhibitors;  the weaning  of decadron  triggered  flares.  Per the authors,  she 
continues to require  increasing  doses of the JAK  inhibitor,  baricitinib. The  authors hypothesize she 
developed  MAS  due to a combination  of genetic  predisposition,  prior EBV  infection,  and  immune stress 
associated  with  the COVID-19 vaccine. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
Literature case  report of a  15 year old  female with  Macrophage Activating  Syndrome (MAS)  after dose  1 
(TIO  10 days) and  dose  2  (recurrence,  TIO  10 days)  which  was  hypothesized  to  be  developed  due to a 
combination  of genetic predisposition,  prior EBV  infection,  and  immune stress associated  with  the COVID-
19 vaccine. 
The term  MAS  is  usually  used  when  a hemophagocytic syndrome develops in  children  systemic juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis (sJIA,  formerly called  Still's disease,  systemic onset JIA,  or systemic onset juvenile 
rheumatoid  arthritis.  MAS  should  be  thought of as  HLH  in  the setting  of a rheumatologic disorder rather 
than  as  a separate syndrome.  Clinical  features and  diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis -
UpToDate 
However,  none  of these conditions have  been  diagnosed  in  this  reported  patient despite extensive testing. 
Therefore,  this case  is  considered  not a HLH  case.  The  (recurrence of)  MAS  complaints after dose  1 and 
dose  2,  is  likely caused  by the combination  of genetic  predisposition  and  (prior)  EBV  infection  rather than 
Comirnaty exposure. 
The  case  is  considered  not valid  for causality assessment concerning  HLH  and  Comirnaty. 
Case  report  2:  Maarten et.al:  Case report:  Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome presenting as 
hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. 8 
A 49-year-old man  presented  to the emergency department following  a week of night sweats and fever 
up to 39C.  He  complained  of right upper quadrant pain,  dyspnea,  headache,  photophobia,  and  diplopia. 
The  patient was  a metal worker and  kept guinea  pigs,  hamsters and  rabbits.  No  other animal contact was 
reported. Two weeks  before  presentation,  he  received  a second  dose of the  BNT162b2  mRNA  COVID-19 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment report

Page  52/142 
vaccine.  There was  no  history of recent travel.  He  smoked  actively, drank alcohol  sporadically and  used 
no  drugs. There were  no  known  allergies and  the family  history, including active or recent infections, was 
negative.  He  presented  with  hemorrhagic fever, type  1 respiratory insufficiency and  acute kidney injury. 
Diagnostic work up showed  a hyperinflammatory syndrome,  hypertriglyceridemia,  hemophagocytosis, 
very high ferritin  and  significantly elevated  sCD25.  He  was  diagnosed  with  hemophagocytic 
lymphohistiocytosis based  on  the HLH-2004 criteria.  Serological testing  indentified  Puumala  virus (a 
hantavirus)  as the causal  pathogen  and  the authors attributed this to the patient's hamsters. The  patient 
was  successfully treated  with  pulse corticosteroids,  intravenous immunoglobins and  supportive therapy. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
Literature case  report of a 49 year old  male with  HLH  after dose  2 (TTO  2 weeks)  which  was  probably 
caused  by  Puumala  virus (a  hantavirus). 
The  case  is  considered  unlikely related  to Comirnaty exposure. 
Case  report 3:  Tanaka  et.al: Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative disorders after BNT162b2 
mRNA  COVID-19 vaccination. 3 
Epstein-Barr virus-associated  lymphoproliferative disorders (EBV-LPD)  is a rare disease characterized  by 
persistent or recurrent inflammation accompanied  by  EBV  infection  of T or NK cells that is  not self 
limiting, and  it is  fatal,  if untreated. After receiving  the first dose of the  BNT162b2  mRNA  COVID-19 
presented  to the hospital  with  a 2-week history of fever.  Laboratory 
vaccine,  a 79-year-old  male  in -
results  indicated  pancytopenia, elevated  liver transaminase  levels,  hyperferritinemia, and 
hypofibrinogenemia.  Computed tomography  revealed  hepatosplenomegaly,  but lymphadenopathy was  not 
observed.  A bone  marrow biopsy,  a random  skin  biopsy,  and  a liver biopsy  revealed  no  malignancy,  but 
an  infectious evaluation  revealed  EBV  viremia  (5.19  Log  IU/ml).  Flow  cytometry and  RT-PCR  revealed 
that the EBV  genome was  localized  in  NK  cells,  suggesting the diagnosis of EBV-NK-LPD.  He  was treated 
with  prednisolone,  intravenous immunoglobulin, and  etoposide,  but the EBV-DNA  load  failed  to decrease, 
and  he  died  2  months later. The  authors conclude that although the  mechanisms and  risk factors for EBV 
LPD  after BNT162b2  mRNA  COVID-19 vaccination  remain  unknown,  it was  possible that reactivation  of 
EBV  after COVID-19 vaccination  may occur. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
Literature case  report of a 79  year old  male with  lymphoproliferative disorders (EBV-LPD)  after dose  1 
(TTO  2 weeks)  probably caused  by  persistent or recurrent inflammation accompanied  by  EBV  infection. 
Although the mechanisms and  risk factors for EBV-LPD  after Comirnaty exposure  remain  unknown, the 
authors concluded  that reactivation  of EBV  after COVID-19 vaccination  may be  possible. 
Therefore, the case  is considered  possible  related  to Comirnaty exposure.

Rapporteur assessment comment: 
Literature case  report of a 48 year old  women  with  HLH  after booster dose  (TTO  6 days) and  affected  by 
transfusion-dependent ~-thalassemia.  The  underlying thalassemia  is  considered  a confounding  factor for 
the onset of fever and  the worsening  of anaemia  with subsequent neutropenia and  thrombocytopenia, 
although  the clinical  presentation  compatible with  HLH  which  was  hypothesized  by the authors to be  likely 
triggered  by the vaccination  (even  after the administration  of first doses without adverse  reactions). 
The  case  is  considered  unlikely related  to Comirnaty exposure. 
Case  report 5:  Sprute et.al:  Correspondence to:  hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis after SARS-CoV-2 
vaccination .10 
The  authors,  responding  to an  inquiry,  provided  more information about a  published  case  report.  They did 
not provide an  age of the patient nor what SARS-COV  2 vaccine the  patient received.  The  patient's 
medical  history was  unremarkable for underlying  diseases associated  with  HLH.  The  only pre-existing 
condition  was  a pilonidal  disease which  had  been  surgically drained 4 years  prior.  In addition to imaging 
and  microbiological,  viral  and  rheumatological  diagnostic approaches  listed  in  the case  report,  blood 
cultures were  repeatedly  negative and  serological  testing  for Brucella  spp.,  Chlamydia trachomatis, 
Coxiella  burnetii,  Echinococcus,  Entamoeba  histolytica,  Leishmania, Treponema  pallidum  and  Yersinia  was 
unremarkable.  Mycoplasma  pneumoniae  infection was excluded  as  trigger due to stable titers over time. 
The  authors consider the SARS-CoV-2  vaccine as the  most plausible trigger for HLH.  No  information was 
given  regarding  Epstein-Barr virus infection. 
Rapporteur assessment comment:

Case  report 6:  Ashizawa et.al: Macrophage activation syndrome after BNT162b2 mRNA  vaccination 
successfully treated with corticosteroids. 11 
A previously healthy 51-year-old woman  in-developed high  fever,  headache,  and  atypical  genital 
bleeding  on  the following  day after a second  dose of BNT162b2  vaccine.  She  presented to the hospital  5 
days after the vaccination  without history of contact with  COVID-19  patients.  On  admission,  laboratory 
tests revealed  thrombocytopenia,  elevated  fibrin  degradation  products,  elevated  D-dimer,  lactate 
dehydrogenase  (LDH)  and  ferritin.  No  thrombosis,  infarction,  hemorrhage or abnormal opacity of lung 
field  was  present.  A SARS-CoV-2  polymerase chain  reaction,  blood  cultures,  antinuclear antibody, 
rheumatoid  factor,  and  cardiolipin  antibodies were all  negative.  Argatroban  and  intravenous 
immunoglobulin were  initiated due to the possibility of thrombotic thrombocytopenia  which  has  been 
reported  after the ChAdOxl  nCov-19 vaccine.  However,  her general  condition  and  her laboratory test 
results such  as  LDH,  ferritin,  and  transaminase levels deteriorated.  Steroid  pulse therapy 
(methylprednisolone  lg daily for 3 days)  followed  by oral  prednisolone for the diagnosis of MAS  triggered 
by SARS-CoV-2  vaccination  was  initiated.  After the corticosteroid  treatment,  her symptoms and 
laboratory data  improved without relapse.  The  authors did  not provide any data  regarding  Epstein-Barr

with  adult-onset Still's disease 
The  authors  report the case  of a twenty-year-old female  in 
(AOSD),  who developed  MAS  six days after receiving  her first dose of BNT162b2  COVID-19 vaccine  with 
ferritin  levels of 136,680 µg/I  (ref.:  13-150 µg/I). Treatment with  methylprednisolone  (250  mg/d 
intravenously)  and  intravenous immunoglobulins was started, and  anakinra  was  increased  to  3xl00 mg/d 
subcutaneously.  Initial treatment response  was  moderate with  reduced  but remaining  fever,  decreasing 
ferritin  levels,  and  normalizing cell  counts after four days.  She  eventually received  additional cyclosporin 
to achieve stable  remission  (2xl00 mg/d). After 2 weeks,  she  was  discharged  with  her previous anakinra 
dose,  cyclosporin  and  a steroid tapering  regimen.  Despite  her immunosuppressive treatment, the first 
vaccination  had  shown  positive antibody development against SARS-CoV-2.  Her planned  second 
vaccination  with  BNT162b2  was  discussed  by an  interdisciplinary team and  they recommended  that she 
wait for a synthetic protein-based  vaccine  (e.g.  NVX-CoV2373  (protein-based vaccine,  Novavax)) to be 
approved  by regulators,  in  the hope for a  less  inflammatory response.  Follow-up over a period  of 4  month 
showed  disease control  and  no  clinical  signs of relapse. 
Rapporteur assessment comment:

Case  report 8: Awan et.al:  COVID-19  vaccination-related hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis presenting 
as acute liver failure. 13 
In September 2021, a 33-year-old  healthy man  in  the. with a past medical  history of hyperlipidemia 
and  seasonal  allergies presented  to the emergency department with fever,  rash,  malaise, elevated  liver 
enzymes,  and  leukopenia.  He  had  received  his second  dose  of the Pfizer COVID  vaccine  on  August 25, 
2021,  and  3 days later developed  fever  (102F), chills,  and  headaches.  He  was  sent home for outpatient 
follow-up and  eventually saw  a hematologist for persistent cytopenia,  believed  to  be  a likely sequela  of a 
viral  infection.  He  tested  negative for COVID-19,  although serology was  positive for COVID-19 antibodies 
due to vaccination.  The  patient continued  to  have  intermittent fevers,  body aches,  and  a  15-lb weight 
loss,  eventually culminating  in  his first hospitalization on  October 22,  2021, for fever of unknown origin

and  acute liver injury.  During  this hospitalization, the  patient had  pancytopenia  and  elevated  liver 
function  tests (LFTs).  Abdominal  ultrasound  revealed  splenomegaly,  and  a bone  marrow biopsy was 
unremarkable.  Viral,  fungal,  protozoa!,  helminthic,  and  bacterial  etiologies were  ruled  out.  A liver biopsy 
revealed  significant hepatic inflammation without any confirmatory etiology.  At this  point,  rheumatology 
started the  patient on  prednisolone for adult-onset Stills disease  (AOSD),  with fever, 
myalgias/arthralgias,  rash,  splenomegaly,  and  elevated  ferritin.  The  patient improved and  was  discharged 
home on  prednisone  20  mg twice a day with  gastroenterology follow  up,  as  LFTs  did  not return  to  normal. 
On  November 23,  2021,  the patient followed  up  with a  hepatologist;  LFTs  had  improved  remarkably. 
Rheumatology tapered  his steroids to 40  mg  and  started to work on  procurement of canakinumab. 
However,  soon  after steroid  tapering,  the  patient developed arthralgias,  rash,  jaundice,  and  fever,  again 
resulting  in  hospitalization  on  December 14,  2021,  for management of AOSD  flare-up.  His  LFTs  and 
inflammatory markers continued  to worsen  despite being  on  methylprednisolone,  anakinra,  and 
intravenous immunoglobulin.  Since  he was  no  longer meeting the Cush  and  Fautrel  criteria,  the 
rheumatologists were  not convinced  he  had  AOSD.  Due to lack of response to therapy, there was  concern 
that he  had  secondary HLH.  The  H-score was  274,  showing  a  >99% probability of HLH.  Therefore,  he  was 
started  on  the  HLH  2004  protocol  (etoposide and  dexamethasone).  Repeat bone  marrow biopsy on 
January  10,  2022,  showed  marrow consistent with  HLH.  He  continued to worsen  clinically.  Due to severe 
liver dysfunction,  etoposide was  discontinued  on  January  13,  2022.  His  inflammatory markers,  LFTs,  and 
cytopenia  continued  to worsen,  and  ultimately,  he  was  in  multiorgan failure,  after which  he was 
transitioned  to comfort care.

Case  report 9:  Shimada et.al: A case of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis after BNT162b2  COVID-19 
(Comirnaty®)  vaccination. 14 
An  85-years-old -woman  with  a  10-year history of nephrosclerosis with  hypertension  presented 
to the hospital  with  a history of fever,  temperature  >  38°C for 7 days,  and  nonspecific fatigue.  The 
patient was admitted  12  days after the first COVID-19 vaccination  with Comirnaty®.  Preliminary 
examination of the patient revealed  the following  findings:  body temperature,  39°C;  blood  pressure, 
120/80 mm Hg;  heart rate 90  beats/minute,  SpO2  90% to 95%.  No  palpable or superficial  lymph  nodes 
were observed.  No  abnormalities were found  on  auscultation.  Laboratory data showed  white blood  cell 
400  x  103/µL (Neut 0%  Lymph  60%,  Mono  34%,  Blast 2%), Hb  8.1  g/dl, Pit  28.7  x  104/µL, C Reactive 
Protein  9.64 mg/dl.  Other findings were elevated  levels of serum  lactate dehydrogenase,  904  U/L (124-
222),  soluble IL-2 R 1450U/ml (1-613), IL-6 37  pg/ml ( <7), and  ferritin  2284  ng/ml  (10-80).  Chest and 
abdominal  computed tomography (CT)  revealed  no  bilateral  lung consolidation,  pleural  effusion,  or 
splenopmegaly.  Bone  marrow aspiration  was  performed,  and  microscopic examination  revealed 
agranulocytosis and  anemia.  The  bone  marrow aspirate show two histiocytes phagocytosing  erythrocytes. 
On  the second  day of admission,  pulsed  intravenous (IV)  methylprednisolone (500 mg/day for 3 
consecutive  days) and  granulocyte-colony stimulating factor was  started, followed  by oral  prednisolone 
(30 mg  once  daily). The  patient's temperature  normalized  within  12  hours of steroid  initiation,  and 
concurrent symptomatic and  biochemical  improvements were observed.

Case  report  11:  Park et.al: A Case  of Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis following Second Dose of 
COVID-19 Vaccination. 16 
A 21-year-old man in-was transferred  from  another hospital  with  an  uncontrolled  high  fever (above 
39°C),  pancytopenia,  and  an  elevated total  bilirubin  concentration  (10.27 mg/dl). He  experienced 
general  weakness,  a fever,  myalgia,  and  a non-pruritic skin  rash.  The  patient had  no  known  or related 
medical  history and  was  in  good  physical  condition  before  receiving  the second  dose of the  BNT162b2 
vaccine  2 weeks  prior.  He  was  started on  empirical  intravenous antibiotics (Tazoperan,  piperacillin  and 
tazobactam)  for fever of unknown origin  and  steroid  pulse therapy (intravenous methylprednisolone,  1.5 
mg/kg/day) 4  days  before the hospital  transfer.  Blood  and  urine cultures were negative.  A bone  marrow 
biopsy revealed  normocellular marrow with  substantial  histiocytosis and  active  hemophagocytosis, 
without any malignant cell  infiltration.  A real-time  polymerase chain  reaction  of oro- and  nasopharyngeal 
swabs was  negative for SARS-CoV-2  and  other respiratory viruses.  There  was  no  evidence of acute or 
active infection with cytomegalovirus;  Epstein-Barr virus;  parvovirus  B19;  hepatitis A,  B,  and  C;  human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV);  or Korean  endemic viruses  related  to hemorrhagic fever with  renal 
syndrome.  Autoimmune antibody tests were  negative. The  patient subsequently received  high-dose 
dexamethasone  (20 mg/day for 7 days) and  a 25% dose  reduction  on  a weekly basis without etoposide 
or other treatment modalities.  Nineteen  days after steroid  pulse therapy, the patient was  discharged  in 
good  physical  condition  without any constitutional  symptoms,  with  normal  laboratory values and  the

disappearance of the skin  rash.  After discharge,  the  patient received  oral  steroids,  which  were tapered 
weekly,  and  stopped  after the third  month of follow-up without any evidence of HLH  relapse. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
Literature case  report of a  21  year old  men  with  HLH  after dose  2  {TTO  2 weeks).  The  patient met the 
HLH  criteria for both  measures:  he  fulfilled  all  eight of the  HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria  and  had  an 
hemophagocytic syndrome (HS)core of 319  (In the validation  set,  the median  HScore was  222  [IQR 202-
284] for positive cases  and  129  [IQR 77-152] for negative cases,  Fardet  L,  Galicier L,  Lambotte O,  Marzac C,

hemophagocytic syndrome.  Arthritis  Rheumatol.  2014;66[9]:2613-2620). 
There was  no  clear precipitant of HLH  other than the second  dose  of the  BNT162b2 vaccine.  The  patient 
had  no  remarkable  medical  history,  was  not taking  any medications,  and  had  no  active or recent bacterial 
or viral  infection  or autoimmune disease.  After his diagnosis,  the  patient recovered  entirely without 
relapse  or sequelae  with the administration  of dexamethasone steroid  pulse therapy with slow tapering. 
The  case  is  considered  probable related  to Comirnaty exposure. 
MAH's literature summary 
The ten  new case  reports of HLH  in  the  literature do not provide  significant new  safety information that 
would  support a causal  association  between  vaccination  with  BNT162b2  and  the development of HLH. 
Viruses such  as  Epstein-Barr-virus infection  is  a major contributor to the development of HLH,  however 
the  new  literature case  reports do  not provide convincing  evidence that COVID-19 vaccination  leads to 
reactivation  of Epstein-Barr virus which then  triggers HLH. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
Through  23  Jul  2023,  in  total  14 case  report publications were  reported,  4  case  reports cited  by the EMA 
and  10 new other case  reports retrieved  by the  MAH,  of which: 
•  1 case  report was  considered  probable related  to Comirnaty exposure; 
•  5 case  reports were considered  possible  related  (including  Lin  et al.  [2022], Tanaka  et al.  [2023], 
Arand  et al.  [2023]  cited  by the  EMA); 
•  3 case  reports were considered  unlikely related;  and 
•  5 case  reports were considered  not relevant cases  (4 cases  with  no  diagnosed  HLH  and  1 case 
reported  an  inactivated  COVID-19 vaccine)  for causality assessment concerning  HLH  and  Comirnaty. 
Safety database review 
The  Safety database was  searched  from  23  September 2022  (the DLP  for the previous evaluation of HLH) 
to 23  July 2023  using  the MedDRA  (v.  26.0)  PT:  Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis for all  BNT162b2 
vaccines.  19 cases  were  retrieved. 
Fourteen  (14) cases  were female and  5 cases  male,  the  mean  age  was 48.9 years  (min  12 and  max 88 
years).  There were  3 fatal  reports.  The  top reporting  countries were Japan  (6), Germany (4), Australia 
(3) and  United  States (3). There were  10 spontaneous and  9  literature reports,  all  serious.  Two  reports 
were duplicates <••••••■ and 
Six (6) cases  were  literature reports already reported  in  the literature section.s,7,7,15,14,9  5 cases  contained

hematopoiesis was  normal 
without malignant findings. 
Virus  multi tests and 
antinuclear antibody showed 
negative  results. These  results 
led  to a diagnosis of 
haemophagocytic syndrome, 
and  from  16Dec2022, 
treatment with  prednisolone  2 
mg/kg/day was  started. The

Narrative 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
The  case  is  considered  unlikely related  to Comirnaty exposure.  Due  to the TIO of 3  months 
after dose  2 it is  not likely that Comirnaty exposure was the cause  of HLH. 
MAH comment:  The  time to 
onset is  very long suggesting 
alternative cause. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
From  23  Sep  2022 to 23  Jul  2023, the  MAH  retrieved from  the safety database  19 HLH  cases,  of which  2 
case  reports were duplicates,  resulting  in  18 unique case  reports: 
•  1 case  report was  considered  possible  related  to Comirnaty exposure; 
•  6 case  reports were  considered  unlikely related; 
•  6 case  reports were  already discussed  in  the  literature section  above; 
•  5 cases  reports contained  insufficient information for a  medical  assessment. 
Routine statistical reports 
To  support routine signal  detection  activities in  addition to the  non-statistical  reports, the  MAH  generates 
statistical  reports including  EB0S. 
The  EB05>2  report is  a product-specific  Bayesian  (Multi-Item Gamma  Poisson  Shrinker) computer 
generated statistical data  mining  report,  which  provides data on  product or adverse event combinations 
for which there  is an  emerging  statistic of disproportionate reporting,  using  an  EB05>2 as  the metric or 
threshold  and  using  a subtraction  option  to omit the  most previously reviewed  events from  subsequent 
views.  The  objective of this analysis was to  identify emerging  new  events as  part of the signal  detection. 
On  cumulative  review of the EB0S  report (May  2023) for the  relevant PT's,  the obtained  value for HLH 
was  0.75 for BNT162b2  and  0.6 for BNT162b2  BA4/5 and  has  not been  reported  for BNT162b2  BAL 
Summary:  The  EB0S  is  less than  the  EB05>2 threshold,  thus indicating  no  emerging  statistical signal  for 
HLH. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
The  MAH  stated  that the EB0S  is  less than the EB05>2 threshold  (May 2023),  indicating  no  emerging 
statistical signal  for HLH. 
MAH's summary and conclusion 
An  updated  literature and  safety database search  including  routine statistical  reports did  not reveal  any 
new significant safety information and  a causal  relationship  between  vaccination  with  BNT162b2  and the 
development of haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis or the reactivation  of Epstein-Barr virus infection 
leading  to the development of haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis cannot be  concluded.  The topic will 
be  monitored  using  routine  Pharmacovigilance. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)  is a rare disorder characterized  by an  overwhelming systemic 
inflammatory reaction.  The  aberrant activation of macrophages,  natural  killer cells,  and  cytotoxic T cells 
leads to the overproduction of cytokines,  especially interleukin  {IL)-1, IL-2, IL-6, and  tumor necrosis 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment report 
EMA/PRAC/585967 /2023 
Page  63/142 
factor-alpha,  as  well  as  hemophagocytosis of hematopoietic cells  in  the  bone  marrow. The  resulting 
tissue/organ  destruction  means that the disease  is  life-threatening.  Multisystem  inflammatory syndrome 
in  children  (MIS-C),  also  a disorder caused  by the dysregulated  immune system,  is  associated  with  SARS 
CoV-2  infection.  MIS-C is similar to HLH  in  increased T-cell  activation and  plasma  cytokines/chemokines, 
but differs in  the extent of the stimulation.  Patients with  MIS-C usually present with  cardiac  problems 
including  myocarditis and  often  involve gastrointestinal disorders.  Patients with  HLH  experience an 
unremitting  high  fever,  cytopenia,  coagulopathy,  hepatic dysfunction, and  organomegaly,  with or without 
lymphadenopathies.  If not treated appropriately, the  patient's condition  may rapidly deteriorate to 
terminal  multiorgan failure  and  subsequent death. Therefore,  early diagnosis and  urgent treatment are 
critical  for survival.  HLH  can  be  classified  as  either familial,  characterized  by genetic defects causing 
lymphocyte cytotoxicity, or acquired/secondary HLH  (sHLH),  usually triggered  by infection,  autoimmune 
disease,  or malignancy. 16 
Literature 
In total  14 case  report publications were  reported,  4  case  reports cited  by the  EMA  and  10 new other case 
reports  retrieved  by the  MAH,  of which: 
•  1 case  report was  considered  probable related  to Comirnaty exposure; 
•  5 case  reports were  considered  possible  related  (including  Lin  et al.  [2022], Tanaka  et al.  [2023], and 
Arand  et al.  [2023]  cited  by the  EMA); 
•  3 case  reports were  considered  unlikely related;  and 
•  5 case  reports were considered  not relevant cases  (4 cases  with  no  diagnosed  HLH  and  1 case 
reported  an  inactivated  COVID-19 vaccine)  for causality assessment concerning  HLH  and  Comirnaty. 
Post-marketing 
From  MAH's  safety database  19 HLH  cases  were  retrieved,  of which  2 case  reports were duplicates, 
resulting  in  18 unique case  reports: 
•  1 case  report was  considered  possible  related  to Comirnaty exposure; 
•  6 case  reports were considered  unlikely related; 
•  6 case  reports were  already discussed  in  the  literature section  above; 
•  5 cases  reports contained  insufficient information for a medical  assessment. 
Cumulatively,  1 HLH  case  (women  21  years old)  is  considered  probably related  with  Comirnaty (due to 
the absence  of other aetiologies or confounding)  and  6  HLH  cases  (women  12,  14,  20  years old;  men  17, 
33,  79  years old) are considered  possible  related.  However,  given  the extensive exposure of Comirnaty 
this is  not considered  unexpected  and  does  not present a new safety concern  at the  moment. 
Based  on  the data  provided,  no  new  important information  could  be  identified  concerning  HLH.  The  data 
is  currently insufficient to support regulatory action  and  therefore no  update of the Comirnaty product 
information  in  relation to HLH  is  currently warranted. 
However, the  MAH  should  continue to closely monitor HLH  and  all  new  (literature)  cases  of HLH  including 
a WHO-UMC  causality assessment per case  and  age-stratified observed/expected  analyses  using  21- and 
42-day risk intervals,  should  be  reported  in  the  next PSUR.  Request for next PSUR

Pemphigus and  Pemphigoid 
Introduction/background 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment report 
EMA/PRAC/585967 /2023 
Page  65/142 
In December 2022,  a signal  assessment report was  issued  by the  EMA  (PAM-SDA-061)  on  Comirnaty and 
pemphigus and  pemphigoid.  Following  submission  of a signal  evaluation  report,  the MAH  received  an 
adopted  PRAC  recommendation  on  14 April  2023 that stated: 
Having considered the available evidence from  EudraVigilance,  literature,  the data submitted by 
the MAH and the analysis by EMA  of real-world data,  the PRAC has concluded that the current 
evidence is  insufficient to establish a causal relationship between Comirnaty and pemphigus or 
pemphigoid.  The  MAH should continue  to monitor these  topics in  PSURs. 
In the next PSUR  (OLP 18 June 2023),  the MAH should perform a review of all new emerging data 
(which  were not assessed in  the current signal procedure) on pemphigus and pemphigoid 
(separately) after exposure to Comirnaty,  including data  from  clinical trials,  post-marketing 
exposure and new scientific literature.  The  MAH should perform the assessment of causality,  an 
0/E analysis and provide all case narratives within  this review. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
Please  also  refer to the closed  signal  procedure Pemphigus and  Pemphigoid  (EPITT  19859). 
Appendix 5.6 of the PSUR has been created to review the new emerging data on  pemphigus 
and pemphigoid. 
Autoimmune  bullous dermatoses in  the  pemphigus family cause  loss  of cell-to-cell  adhesion 
(acantholysis)  in  the mucocutaneous membranes due to antibodies against proteins on  the cell  surface of 
keratinocytes (e.g.,  desmogleins).  It is  rare  and  may  be  idiopathic or drug-induced  but also  seems to 
have a relationship with  certain  HAL class II genes as  evidenced  by  its  higher prevalence in  individuals of 
Mediterranean and  Ashkenazi  decent.  Subtypes include  pemphigus vulgaris,  pemphigus foliaceus,  IgA 
pemphigus and  paraneoplastic pemphigus.  It is  largely a disease  of adults  but may also  affect children 
and  the  male-to-female ratio worldwide is  about equal.  Diagnosis  is  based  on  histopathology and  direct 
immunofluorescence of the specimen  and  is  supported  by the  presence of pathogenic antibodies in  the 
serum. 1 
The  bullous form  of pemphigoid  is  also  an  autoimmune condition  and  thought to involve autoantibodies 
directed  against hemidesmosomes that attach  basal  keratinocytes with  the basement membrane at the 
dermal-epidermal junction.  Risk factors for this condition  are also  thought to include hereditary 
predisposing  factors such  as  HLA types in  addition  to infections and  certain  drugs.  Pemphigoid  has  a 
tendency to occur in  elderly  males (>70 years)  and  is  no  longer considered  a rare dermatologic disease  in 
the elderly.  Its incidence varies from  2.4 to 21.7 new cases/million/year-and  prevalence  has  been 
increasing.  Diagnosis  is  based  on  the presence of clinical  features,  direct immunofluorescence of tissue 
(linear deposits of IgG or C3  along  the epidermal  basement membrane)  and  serum  autoantibodies 
against BP180  and/or BP230  antigens. 2,3 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
Pemphigus and  pemphigoid  are  rare  autoimmune blistering  diseases of the skin  and/or mucous 
membranes. 
Pemphigus affects the epidermis and  causes  lesions and  blisters that are easily  ruptured. 
Pemphigoid  affects a lower layer of the skin,  between  the epidermis and  the dermis, creating  tense 
blisters that do  not break easily.  Sometimes pemphigoid  may look like  hives or eczema  without blisters. 
Over-active  immune system  leads to skin  cells  separating  from  each  other, fluid  collecting  between  skin 
layers and  blisters formation. 
Clinical trial data 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment report 
EMA/PRAC/585967 /2023 
Page  66/142 
There  is  no  new placebo-controlled clinical  trial  data  from the  large pivotal  Pfizer-run  clinical  studies 
C4591001  and  C4591007 that were  previously presented.  The  pemphigus/pemphigoid AEs  reported  had 
either occurred  after placebo or with times to onset longer than  ~3 months after receipt of BNT162b2 
vaccine. 
Safety database 
Methodology 
Utilizing  PSUR criteria,  MAH's  safety database was searched  cumulatively through  18 June  2023 for 
BNT162b2,  BNT162b2/BNT162b2 OMI  BA.1  and  BNT162b2/BNT162b2 OMI  BA.4-5 cases  coded  with any 
of the following  PTs  (MedDRA version  26.0):  Benign  familial  pemphigus;  Linear IgA disease;  Mucous 
membrane pemphigoid;  Ocular pemphigoid;  Paraneoplastic  pemphigus;  Pemphigoid;  Pemphigus; 
Pemphigus disease area  index.  Cases  included  in  the previous signal  evaluation  performed  by the  MAH 
(end  date  15  Nov  2022)  were excluded  from  the search. 
As  of 23  June  2023, there were  52  cases  of pemphigoid  and  35  cases  of pemphigus retrieved  for review. 
Results - Pemphigus 
The  35  serious cases  of pemphigus were from  spontaneous reports  (22) and  literature (13);  all  were 
reported  for BNT162b2  (original)  except 1 report coincident with administration of Bivalent BNT162b2 
(Original  + Omicron  BA.4/BA.5). They were  reported  from  Germany (7), Italy (5),  France  and  Japan  (4 
each),  Canada  (3), Greece,  Morocco and  UK  (2 each)  and  Portugal,  South Africa, Thailand, Tunisia, 
Turkey and  US  (1  each)  in  a relatively equal  number of males (18) and  females  (17)  ranging  in  age from 
17 to 86 years of age  (mean  55.6).  Most  reports described  patients between  31  and  74 years of age.  The 
outcome of the cases  was  reported  as  recovered/recovering  (with  or without sequelae)  in  45.7%,  not 
recovered  in  28.6% and  unknown in  25.7% of reports.  There  were  no fatal  cases. 
As  requested  by  EMA,  narratives of all  the cases  are provided  in  Appendix  5.6.1  of the  PSUR  (not 
reproduced  here). 
Of the  35  cases,  18 did  not mention the  means to a clear diagnosis of pemphigus (e.g., cutaneous or

unclassifiable and  not further discussed. 
Of the remaining  17 cases  with  biopsies,  2 describe the occurrence of pemphigus long  after vaccination

Rapporteur assessment comment: 
From  15 Nov  2022 through  23  Jun  2023,  35  cases  of pemphigus concerning  33  unique cases  were 
retrieved  from  MAH's  safety database of which: 
•  5 cases  were considered  possible  related  to Comirnaty exposure; 
•  7 cases  were considered  unlikely  related;  and 
•  21  cases  were considered  unassessable. 
Results - Pemphigoid 
The  52  serious cases  of pemphigoid  were from  spontaneous reports  (42) and  literature (10). There  were 
42 cases  reported for BNT162b2  (original),  7 for Bivalent BNT162b2  (Original  + Omicron  BA.4/BA.5) and 
3 reported  for Bivalent BNT162b2  (Original  + Omicron  BA.1). 
They  were  reported  from Australia  (9),  UK  (8), Japan  and  France  (7), Germany and  US  (6 each),  Estonia 
(2) and  Belgium,  Greece,  Portugal,  Spain,  Sweden, Thailand  and Turkey (1  each)  in  a larger number of 
females  (35) than  males (16)  - one  report did  not provide sex data. The  patients  ranged  in  age from  31 
to 90 years of age  (mean  68.9). The  largest age  group was  75  years and  older (21, 40.4%) and  the next 
largest was  65-74 (17,  32.7%); this is  consistent with  the known  epidemiology of pemphigoid. 
Case  outcome was  reported  as  recovered/recovering  (with or without sequelae)  in  52%, not recovered  in 
36.5% and  unknown in  11.5% of reports.  There  were  no  fatal  cases. 
As  requested  by  EMA,  narratives of all  the cases  are  provided  in  MAH's documentation, Appendix  5.6.2 of 
the PSUR  (not reproduced  here). 
Of the  52  cases,  25  did  not mention the  means to a clear diagnosis of pemphigus (e.g., skin  biopsy 
and/or serum  antibodies).  Due  to the lack of assuredness of the diagnosis of interest, these cases  are 
considered  unclassifiable and  not further discussed.  Of note, among those  25 cases,  there were  2  patients 
who described  similar events following  >1 COVID-19 vaccination. 
Of the  remaining  27 cases,  21  were  reported  to  have  biopsies and  the remaining  6 described  serum 
antibody testing.  One  of the  27  cases  will  not be  further discussed  because  it was  discussed  among  the 
pemphigus cases  above.  Four additional  cases  are also  not further discussed  because they are assessed 
as  unlikely to be  associated  with  vaccine:  2 that lacked  information about time to onset of pemphigoid 
following  vaccination  and  2 that reported  very distant times to onset,  190 days and  215  days, 
respectively. 
Two  cases  (II■■■■■ and ■■■■■■■) describing a woman  in  her 70s  in -had  very 
similar details and  confirmed  as  duplicates during this assessment.  They are  noted  by an  asterisk in  Table 
2. 
Four cases  described  2 unique patients who  reported  pemphigoid  after each  of 2 doses of Comirnaty (see 
table for details).

Details of the remaining  22 cases  are  in  the table below.  These  could  be  considered "possible or better" if 
the WHO-UMC  case  causality assessment for medication  is applied 6,  however it should  be  recognized  that 
for AEFis,  it is  seldom  possible to achieve  a straightforward  answer about causality at the  individual case 
level  and  causality assessment  must also  occur at the  population  level.7

Patient with  complicated  medication

blistering and  peeling  skin  on  the face 
and  extremities approximately  10 days 
after a 5th  dose of COVID-19 vaccine

eosinophil  count of 44.3% and  anti 
BP180  antibodies.  She was treated 
with oral  prednisone  and  had  not 
recovered  at the time of the report. 
While  there is a temporal association

From  15  Nov  2022 through  23  Jun  2023,  52  cases of pemphigoid  concerning  49 unique cases  were

•  28  cases  were considered  unassessable. 
Routine Statistical Reports 
To  support routine signal  detection  activities in  addition to the non-statistical  reports, the  MAH  generates 
statistical  reports including  EB05>2. The  EB05>2  report is  a product-specific Bayesian  (Multi-Item 
Gamma  Poisson  Shrinker) computer-generated statistical  data  mining  report,  which  provides data on 
product or adverse  event combinations for which  there is  an  emerging statistic of disproportionate 
reporting,  using  an  EB05>2 as  the  metric or threshold  and  using  a subtraction option to omit the  most 
previously reviewed  events from  subsequent views. 
On  cumulative  review of the EB05  report for the PT's  were as  follows:

triggered by COVID-19 vaccinations: An Australian case series.  Frontiers in  Medicine,  VOLUME=9, 
YEAR=2023 
At a single academic  blistering disease centre in  Sydney, Australia,  a retrospective  review was  conducted, 
identifying  59  patients with AIBD  seen  between  February 2021  and  November 2022.  According  to the 
authors, four patients had  induction  of bullous  pemphigoid  (1  BNT162b2,  3 AstraZeneca),  three  patients 
had  a flare  of preexisting  bullous  pemphigoid  (2  BNT162b2,  1 AstraZeneca),  one  patient had  induction of 
pemphigus (BNT162b2),  and  two patients had  a flare of pre-existing  pemphigus vulgaris (BNT162b2). 
Five  of the  10 cases  described  did  not have  a known  measurement of disease activity prior to vaccination. 
Two  reported  flares  occurred  shortly after the vaccination  (5 and  6 days,  respectively)  while the 
remaining  patients were  reported  to  have flares from  15 to  123 days (mean  61.3 days) after vaccination.

Venereal,  37:  e35-e36.  https://doi.org/10.1111/jdv.18503. 
The  Dermatology Centre of the University of Naples  Federico  II in  Italy collected  data on  43  patients with 
BP  who  had  three COVID-19 vaccine doses  (BNT162b2  and  mRNA-1273  were  the vaccines administered). 
In the  majority of the cases  (90.6%),  no  disease  worsening  or onset of new  lesions was  observed.  In the 
remaining  4  (10.4%) cases,  patients experienced  disease  worsening  5- 8 days after the vaccination. 
Notably,  all  subjects were  previously treated  with  oral  corticosteroids  ±  azathioprine and  they were all 
under control  before  undergoing  vaccination.  The  patients who  had  a worsening  of the disease were 
managed  without significant complications and  completed  their vaccine schedule.

and  healthy individuals (HI) up to 4 weeks after booster immunization with  either BNT162b2  or 
mRNA1273.  Cytofluorimetric analysis revealed  an  increase in  Thl and Th17.1  cells  in  patients with 
pemphigus at 4 weeks after booster vaccination,  whereas Th17 cells concomitantly decreased.  Th2  cells 
showed  no  significant changes.  The  authors observed  a similar trend  in  the  BP  group  but not in  HI. 
Intracellular cytokine  expression  2 and  4  weeks  after booster immunization,  showed  pemphigus patients 
had  a significant increase in  interferon-y production  in T memory cells.  Serum  levels of interferon-y,  IL-4, 
IL-17A and  IL-6 were  not or minimally affected at weeks  2 and  4  after vaccination. 
Disease  activity,  as  determined by the Autoimmune  Bullous  Skin  Disorder Intensity Score,  remained 
stable  in  all  patients. The  authors concluded  that the study reports initial evidence,  that mRNA  booster 
vaccines elicit a robust and  specific anti  spike  protein  humeral  reaction  and  T- cellular activity without

influencing  disease activity in  pemphigus and  BP.  Importantly,  booster vaccinations with  BNT162b2 or 
mRNA1273  only minimally influenced  autoantibody titres specific for DSGl/3 or BP180/230.  Concomitant 
immunosuppressive drugs as  studied  except for rituximab  up  to 3  months prior to vaccination  were 
reported  to  have  little effect on  the antibody titres and  possible  relevance to avoiding  disease 
reactivation.

This  multicenter study included  247 patients with  pemphigus from three tertiary dermatology clinics with 
the specialized  outpatient clinic for autoimmune blistering  diseases  in Turkey.  Patients were asked 
standardized  questions in  person  or via  telephone calls.  Also,  demographic data were  collected  from 
patients' files.  Two  hundred  forty-four of 247  patients took the survey between August and  September 
2021.  Total  175 of 244  (71.7%)  patients were vaccinated  against COVID-19.  The  percentage of vaccine 
types were  36.9,  34.4,  and  0.4 to Sinovac,  Pfizer-BioNTech,  and  Oxford  AstraZeneca,  respectively.  Total 
number and  percentage of patients who  experienced  pemphigus flare after vaccination  was  18 (10.3%). 
Fifteen  of 18 experienced  flares  after the first vaccine  administration,  and  three of 18 after the second 
administration. Total  seven  of 18 flares were with  Sinovac,  and  11  of 18 were with  Pfizer-BioNTech. 
Patients who  needed further treatment or treatment change  after a vaccination-induced  flare  was  7 
(38.8%).  Additionally,  one  patient other than the study group developed  pemphigus vulgaris after the 
first administration  of the Pfizer BioNTech  SARS  COV-2  vaccine during this  period.

The  study included  patients aged  218 years,  who  presented  to  13 different dermatology clinics  in  Turkey 
between July 2021  and  September 2021  after developing dermatological  events following  the 
administration  of the COVID- 19 vaccine.  A total of 269  patients  [116 women  (43.1%),  153 men 
(56.9%)] were  included  in  the study.  It was  observed that the dermatological events that most frequently 
developed after vaccination  were  urticaria  (25.7%),  herpes zoster (24.9%),  maculopapular eruption 
(12.3%), and  pityriasis rosea  (4.5%).  Bullous  pemphigoid  (BP)  development was  more common  in  the 
inactivated vaccine group than  in  the mRNA vaccine group (1.86% and  0.37%,  respectively). 
Case  report:  (Chen,  H.-C.,  Ma,  5.-H.,  Wang,  L.-H.,  Chang,  Y.-T.  and Wu,  C.-Y.  (2023),  Pemphigus 
aggravation following Pfizer-BioNTech  vaccination: A case report and review of literature.  Int J Rheum 
Dis,  26:  1187-1190.  https://doi.org/10.1111/1756-185X.14581 
A 39-year-old  man  with  a history of hypertension  presented  1 week following  dose  1 of Pfizer-BioNTech 
(BNT)  COVID- 19 vaccine.  Two  months prior to admission,  he  had  experienced  unhealed  oral  ulcers and 
crusted  erosions over the scalp,  which  were  relatively stable under topical treatment at a  local  clinic. 
However,  within  1 week of COVID-19 vaccination,  painful  vesicles  and  erosions  progressed  rapidly over 
his trunk and  limbs. The  patient was transferred  to the emergency department due to progressive 
disease.  Examination  revealed  coalescing  erosions and  scattered flaccid  blisters over the patient's trunk 
and  limbs,  involving a total  body surface area  of approximately 30%.  Diffuse oral  mucosal  erosions and 
bilateral  injected  conjunctiva  with  purulent discharge were also  observed.  A skin  biopsy  performed  under 
the  suspicion  of pemphigus vulgaris (PV)  revealed  intraepidermal acantholysis.  Direct 
immunofluorescence examination  revealed  intercellular deposits of immunoglobulin  G in  the epidermis. 
The  patient was  transferred  to the  burn  unit due to extensive  involvement (initial  Pemphigus  Disease 
Area  Index score,  73).  High- dose  methylprednisolone (1  mg/kg/d) and  subsequent rituximab (2  1000-
mg  doses  2 weeks apart) were  initiated due to severe  and  uncontrolled  disease status.  However,  despite 
aggressive immunosuppressants use,  new  blisters and  erosions developed  after rituximab administration. 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment report 
EMA/PRAC/585967 /2023 
Page  84/142 
Thus,  azathioprine (200 mg/d) was  initiated  (2 weeks after rituximab infusion).  After serial  treatment, the 
disease  activity was  controlled,  and  the erosions gradually healed.  The  patient was  discharged and 
followed-up at the outpatient department with  low-dose azathioprine  (100 mg/d) and  methylprednisolone 
(8  mg/d) for maintenance.  Due to concerns  of pemphigus flares,  the patient declined to receive  a second 
dose of the SARS-CoV-2  vaccine. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
Literature case  report of a 39  old  man  with  pemphigus after dose  1 (TTO  1 week).  Within  1 week of 
vaccination,  painful  vesicles  and  erosions  progressed  rapidly over his trunk and  limbs.  However, two 
months prior to admission,  he  had  experienced  unhealed  oral  ulcers and  crusted  erosions over the  scalp 
which  is  considered  a more likely cause  of the pemphigus and  not the Comirnaty exposure. 
This case  is considered  unlikely related  to Comirnaty exposure. 
MAH's literature summary 
Although  case  reports of pemphigus /  pemphigoid  reactivation  and  new  occurrence of pemphigus / 
pemphigoid  conditions  have been  observed,  the updated  literature search  did  not reveal  any significant 
new  safety information. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
The  MAH  stated  that above described  literature case  reports of pemphigus,  pemphigoid  were already 
included  in  the post-marketing  section  above. 
One  additional  literature case  report was  considered  unlikely related  to Comirnaty exposure. 
Observed to expected analyses 
The  MAH  conducted  unadjusted  observed  to expected  ratio  (O/E) analyses for the  147 pemphigus cases 
and  359  pemphigoid  cases  reported  cumulatively through  15  May  2023 globally.  Age-specific O/E  ratios 
are  restricted  to the US/EEA  because  exposure data  is available at this level  of detail for these  regions.

Based  on  the selected  background  rates and  the estimated  number of exposure person-years through  15 
May  2023,  O/E  ratios were well  below  one  for both  pemphigus and  pemphigoid  in  a 28-day risk window. 
This suggests that the number of observed  cases  may not be  higher than expected  in  the absence  of 
Pfizer-BioNTech  COVID-19 vaccines. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
All  O/E  ratios were well  below  one  for both  pemphigus and  pemphigoid  in  a 28-day risk window. 
MAH's summary and conclusion 
The  risk of development of pemphigus and  pemphigoid  is  most likely multifactorial;  conditions with 
unclear etiologies are  likely to  be  hypothesized to be  related  to a  known  occurrence when  one can  be 
identified  (e.g.,  new exposure).  While  this may be  a  logical  step,  temporal  proximity to vaccine  exposure 
is  not sufficient to conclude causality.  While  well-described  individual cases  without alternative etiologies 
have been  used  in  pharmacovigilance to justify causal  relationships  between vaccines/medications and 
adverse events,  it remains  unclear if this is  a reasonable  approach  when  a vaccine  has  been  administered 
to an  unprecedented  number of diverse individuals globally.  Population  level  evidence  needs to  be 
considered. 
Nonetheless,  this review of additional  safety database cases  does  not provide information  different from 
the previous  review;  most cases  either lack important information  or describe additional  factors that may 
be  contributory to the development of the event.  Likewise, the  new  literature does  not clearly support 
that pemphigus/pemphigoid  is caused  by vaccination.  Additionally, the  updated  age  and  sex-stratified 
observed  to expected  analyses for the vaccines suggest that the observed  number of cases  of potential 
pemphigus and  pemphigoid  are  not higher than  expected  in  the absence  of COVID-19 vaccination. 
Overall,  the available data  is  insufficient to conclude a causal  association  between  BNT162b2 vaccination 
and  pemphigus/pemphigoid. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
Pemphigus 
From  the  previous  pemphigus signal  procedure  (EPITT  19859), through  15  Nov 2022, there were 
identified  2 probable cases,  8  possible cases,  and  6  unlikely/unassessable cases  among  the  16 pemphigus 
cases  with  diagnostic tests. 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment report 
EMA/PRAC/585967 /2023 
Page  87/142 
From  16 Nov  2022 through  23  Jun  2023,  36 cases  of pemphigus concerning  34  unique cases  were 
retrieved  from  MAH's  safety database of which: 
•  5 cases  were considered  possible  related  to Comirnaty exposure; 
•  8 cases  were considered  unlikely related;  and 
•  21  cases  were considered  unassessable. 
Overall,  through  23  Jun  2023: 
•  2 pemphigus cases  were considered  probable  related  to Comirnaty exposure; 
•  13 pemphigus cases  were considered  possible  related; 
•  35  pemphigus cases  were considered  unlikely related/unassessable. 
Pemphigoid 
From  the previous  pemphigoid  signal  procedure (EPITT  19859), through  15  Nov 2022, there were 
identified  7  probable cases,  22  possible cases,  and  93  unlikely/unassessable cases  among  the  122 
pemphigoid  cases  with diagnostic tests. 
From  16 Nov  2022 through  23  Jun  2023,  52  cases  of pemphigoid  concerning  49  unique cases  were 
retrieved  from  MAH's  safety database of which: 
•  7 cases  were considered  possible  related  to Comirnaty exposure; 
•  14 cases  were considered  unlikely related;  and 
•  28  cases  were considered  unassessable. 
Overall,  through  23  Jun  2023: 
•  7 pemphigoid  cases  were  considered  probable  related  to Comirnaty exposure; 
•  29  pemphigoid cases  were considered  possible  related; 
•  135  pemphigoid  cases  were considered  unlikely related/unassessable. 
Literature 
The  updated  pemphigus/pemphigoid  literature search  did  not reveal  any significant new  safety 
information. 
O/E  analyses 
All  O/E  ratios were well  below  one for both  pemphigus and  pemphigoid  in  a 28-day risk window. 
In conclusion  based  on  provided  data,  MAH's conclusion  is  endorsed that there is  not sufficient evidence 
to conclude a causal  association  between  Comirnaty and  pemphigus/pemphigoid. The  MAH  should 
continue monitoring  pemphigus/pemphigoid  cases  after Comirnaty exposure using  routine 
pharmacovigilance and  notify the  PRAC  Rapporteur immediately when  unexpected  numbers or (changes 
in)  patterns of pemphigus/pemphigoid  cases  are  reported.

Following  receipt of an  EMA  PRAC  adopted  recommendation 
(EMNPRAC/3178/2023) for this signal  on  12 January 2023,  myositis and 
vaccination  with  BNT162b2  (original  and  bivalent) was  evaluated  by the 
MAH.  Evaluation consisted  of the  review of non-clinical  data  that showed 
common  occurrence of injection site  reactions  but no  microscopic 
evidence of any inflammatory process  in  muscle sites beyond  the 
injection  site on  necroscopy (e.g.,  gastrocnemius  tongue,  heart). The

clinical  study database for 4  completed  and  7 ongoing  Pfizer-run  clinical 
studies was  searched  for relevant reports  per the MedDRA search 
strategy for myositis. Three cases  were  retrieved,  all  assessed  by  the 
investigators as  not related:  One  report of dermatomyositis in  the pivotal 
study of >44,000 participants (C4591001)  occurring  on  day 44 after 
dose  3 of BNT162b2;  1 report of worsening  dermatomyositis in  a study 
of immunocompromised  participants (C4591024)  in  a 6-year-old with a 
history of juvenile dermatomyositis occurring  76 days after dose  2 of 
BNT162b2;  also  in  C4591024,  1 report of myositis in  a 4 year-old  with a 
history of renal  transplantation occurring  74 days after dose  3 of 
BNT162b2.  The  literature search  retrieved  10 articles (1  was  a pre-print) 
that were  mostly retrospective cohort studies in  patients with 
inflammatory myopathies who were  surveyed  or otherwise assessed  for 
flares following  vaccination.  Some studies reported  new cases  of myositis 
and  flares  of underlying disease  in  a minority of patients,  but most 
authors acknowledged that it was  not possible to assume a causal 
association  based  on  their results.  Indeed, the potential  mechanisms for 
as  association  hypothesized  by  the authors were  not uniform. The  MAH's 
safety database disproportionality analysis was  unremarkable and  a 
review of the  1017 cases  retrieved  were of variable quality. There  were 
16 cases  (15 individuals) without alternative aetiologies that had 
temporality with vaccination.  The  O/E  ratios  in  some age  groups and  risk 
windows were greater than  1 suggesting  that the  number of reported 
cases  may be  higher than  expected  compared  to  unvaccinated  persons, 
however, the  risk windows for myositis following  Comirnaty vaccines  are 
unclear, and  the caveats of the O/E  analyses,  including the  use  of several 
risk windows,  one  background  rate,  the  unknown degree of 
underreporting, the small  number of observations in  some  age 
stratifications and  the possibility of the numerator including  patients with 
a medical  history of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM)  (that was 
not reported  in  the case),  need  to  be  weighed  in  consideration.  Overall, 
in  the context of the  >4 billion  doses of BNT162b2 original  and  bivalent 
shipped  since  Dec  2020, the totality of the data  did  not allow a causal 
link to be  concluded. 
In the 2nd  adopted  PRAC  recommendation  (12 May  2023), the  PRAC 
agreed that a causal  association  between  Comirnaty and  myositis could 
not be  concluded,  and  no  update to the  product information  and/or the 
risk management plan  was  warranted. 
MAH's  response  (Appendix 5 of the  PSUR)  to the  PRAC's  request  included 
in  the signal  AR  (PAM-SDA-063,  EPITT:  19883) to explore the feasibility 
of using healthcare data  prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic to

Evaluation 
The  MAH  was  requested  to explore the feasibility of using  healthcare data 
prior to and  during the COVID-19  pandemic to  better understand the 
occurrence of myositis in  a  broad  population and  provide  proposals to 
obtain  more  recent background  incidence  rates  (during the 
pandemic/immunization  campaigns).  The  MAH  is  conducting  an  updated 
literature review to identify recently  published  studies on  IIM incidence 
rates  prior to and/or during the COVID-19  pandemic.  In addition, the 
MAH  is  conducting  a feasibility for analysis of annual  incidence rates for 
IIM in  the Optum  Clinformatics closed  claims database for the timeframe 
01  January 2019 to  most current data  available.  The  proposed  definition 
for IIM cases  would  include ICD-10-CM  diagnosis codes for myositis and 
be  based  on  an  algorithm for case  identification  in  healthcare databases 
that has  been  used  in  published  papers.  In future O/E  analyses of 
myositis, the  MAH  proposes to include  updated  O/E  analyses  based  on 
pre-COVID-19  published  background  rates,  as  well  as  IIM incidence rates 
from the healthcare database during  2019 and  during the COVID-19  era. 
Additional  Note:  PRAC  also  recommended  to include  myositis in  ongoing 
PASSs  in  the pharmacovigilance  plan  (C4591009;  C4591010;  C4591011; 
C4591012;  C4591021). The  MAH  confirms that myositis will  be  added  as 
an  endpoint to C4591009  and  C4591021.  Due to the end  of data 
collection  in  June  2023  for a planned  final  study report in  December 2023 
for C4591012  myositis will  not be  added  to that PASS.  Because  PRAC 
recommended  that C4591010  be  removed  from  the RMP  at the  next 
regulatory opportunity,  when  study termination commences  it will 
preclude the addition of myositis as  a PASS  endpoint.  Due  to the 
significant operational  challenges experienced  with C4591011,  myositis 
will  not be  added to that PASS. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
Please  refer to the  Myositis signal  procedure  (EPITT  19883) which  concluded  closely  monitor 
Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM)/autoimmune myositis,  and  IIM flares through  routine 
pharmacovigilance and  evaluation as  an  AESI  in  ongoing  PASS(s). 
MAH's  proposal  is  agreed,  that future O/E  analyses of myositis will  be  based  on  pre-COVID-19 
published  background  rates,  as  well  as  IIM incidence rates from  the healthcare database during 
2019 and  during the COVID-19 era. 
Myositis will  be  added  to as  an  endpoint to PASS  C4591009  and  PASS  C4591021. 
Pemphigus and 
Pemphigoid 
Following  receipt of an  EMA  PRAC  adopted  recommendation 
(EMNPRAC/868335/2022) for this signal  on  01  December 2022, 
pemphigus/pemphigoid  was  evaluated  by the MAH.  On  14 Apr 2023,  the 
PRAC  concluded  that the current evidence was  insufficient to establish  a 
causal  relationship  between  Comirnaty and  pemphigus or pemphigoid. 
They requested  that within  PSUR  5 the MAH  perform a  review of new

emerging data  on  pemphigus and  pemphigoid;  this can  be  found  in 
Appendix  5.6 of the  PSUR  (not reproduced  here). The  outcome of this 
updated  review does  not change  the  MAH  previous assessment which 
concluded  that there is  insufficient evidence for a causal  association 
between  Comirnaty and  pemphigus/pemphigoid. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
Please  refer to the previous pemphigus/pemphigoid  signal  procedure  (EPITT  19859) and  the 
assessment of appendix 5.6 of the  PSUR  reporting  MAH's  review of new emerging  data on 
pemphigus and  pemphigoid,  in  section  2.2 'Signal evaluation' above,  concluding  that there is

Signal 
Evaluation Plan 
Following  closure of the  EMA  PRAC  signal  Heavy menstrual  bleeding  and 
Menstrual 
irregularitiesa  Amenorrhea,  the  MAH  determined that the  broader concept of menstrual 
irregularities (not limited to HMB  and  Amenorrhea)  should  be  evaluated.  See 
appendix 5.7  of the  PSUR  (not fully  reproduced  here): 
MAH's summary and conclusion of the repeated review of menstrual 
irregularities 
A repeated  review of menstrual  irregularities was  undertaken in  order to 
ensure  an  up  to date  understanding of the adverse  event reports  received  and 
accumulating  medical  literature. 
The  difficulties of discerning  causality of menstrual  irregularities to the vaccine 
have been  discussed  in  other documents,  including  in  Pfizer/BNT's signal 
evaluation documents produced for the  EMA  PRAC,  and  include that menstrual 
irregularities are common  and  may be  multifactorial  in  etiology. 
Menstrual  irregularities were  not widely reported  in  the  large  pivotal clinical 
trial  study in  adults and  no  imbalance  between  BNT162b2 and  placebo groups 
was  noted. The  spontaneously  reported  cases  are  mostly non-medically 
confirmed  and  non-serious without trends toward events of clinical 
significance.  There  are  notable differences in  regional  reporting  of menstrual 
irregularities, with the  bulk of reports from  the  UK and  Western  European 
countries and  significantly fewer from  the  US,  Australia  and  Japan,  which  are 
countries with  robust pharmacovigilance  systems and  which  account for an 
overall  high  proportion of ICSRs  received  in  the  Pfizer safety database.  This 
observation  may indicate that non-causal  factors  may be  playing  a role  in 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment report 
EMA/PRAC/585967 /2023 
Page  92/142 
reporting.  With  such  widespread  global  administration of primary doses of 
BNT162b2,  many ICSRs  have been  received  and  even  what may historically be 
considered  a  large number of ICSRs for a vaccine,  cannot be  considered 
similarly with  the COVID-19 vaccine  in  the  pandemic setting  where the number 
of doses administered  worldwide was  unprecedented.  Careful  review of the 
accumulating  literature focusing  on  the highest quality studies,  provided 
reassurance that menstrual abnormalities reported  following  vaccination  do  not 
appear to be  clinically consequential.  Study observations have  included: 
weak/small  observations of temporary changes  in  menstrual cycle  length, 
inconsistent (some  point toward,  and  others do  not) changes  in  the  length  of 
reported  menses,  inconsistent (some  point toward, and  others do not) 
observations of heavier than  usual  menstrual  bleeding. 
Overall,  based  on  the strength and  quality of evidence and  lack of clear 
mechanism, a causal  association  between  Comirnaty and  menstrual 
irregularities is  not supported  at this time and  no  changes to the core  data 
sheet or core  safety concerns  is  warranted. To  improve detailed  data collection 
in  the COVID-19 vaccine clinical  studies,  Pfizer has created  specific case  report 
forms to use  if menstrual  irregularities are  reported  and  Pfizer will  continue to 
monitor menstrual  irregularities with  routine pharmacovigilance. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
Please  refer to the closed  signal  procedure heavy menstrual  bleeding  (EPITT  19783) in  which 
heavy menstrual  bleeding  was  added  as  an  ADR  in  Comirnaty PI,  the closed  signal  procedure 
amenorrhoea  (EPITT  19784), and  the  updated  review of amenorrhea  in  the previous 4th  PSUR 
concluding  that a causal  association  between vaccination  with Comirnaty and  amenorrhoea  was 
lacking. 
In the current 5th  PSUR,  the  MAH  reported  the  results of a  repeated  review of menstrual 
irregularities (not limited to heavy menstrual  bleeding  and  amenorrhoea) through  31  Mar 2023 
for post-marketing  cases  (731  serious medically confirmed  cases  with  a reasonable  latency 
between  1-90 days post vaccination)  and  through  11  Jul  2023 for relevant literature (6  high 
quality articles).  Based  on  provided  data,  MAH's  conclusion  is  endorsed that a causal  association 
between  Comirnaty and  menstrual  irregularities is  not supported  at this time and  that the  MAH 
should  continue to monitor menstrual  irregularities through  routine  pharmacovigilance. 
Of note, after DLP  of this PSUR  a safety signal  concerning  postmenopausal  haemorrhage after 
COVID-19  mRNA vaccine  (nucleoside-modified)  was  started,  confirmed  and  is  ongoing,  please 
refer to  procedure  EPITT  19989. 
Sensorineural  Following  receipt of a request by TGA  (Australia)  for an  "updated signal 
hearing Iossa 
analysis" on  this topic in  the  next PSUR,  the  MAH  re-opened  this signal  and 
provides a full  evaluation  in  Appendix  5.4 of the PSUR  (not fully reproduced 
here): 
MAH's summary and conclusion of the updated signal analysis 
sensorineural hearing loss 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment report 
EMA/PRAC/585967 /2023 
Page  93/142 
Data  from  the pivotal  Pfizer led  COVID-19 vaccine clinical  studies,  post-
authorization  safety database and  medical  literature were  reviewed  for this 
evaluation.  In addition,  O/E  analyses were  reviewed. 
Participants in  the  placebo-controlled,  blinded  periods of the clinical  studies 
reported  a low number of hearing  loss  events in  the vaccination  group and 
placebo group,  with  no  meaningful difference between  the 2 groups. 
The  spontaneously reported  cases  are of variable quality.  While there are 
individual  cases  that report events temporally close to the time of 
vaccination(s)  and  provide detailed  information  without alternative 
explanations for hearing  loss,  the  nature of SNHL and  its myriad etiologies is 
such  that the possibility of coincidental  occurrence versus causality of the 
vaccine cannot be  discounted. The  number of vaccine doses administered 
globally,  and  the subsequent number of adverse  event reports  received  for the 
vaccine are  unprecedented  in  the field  of pharmacovigilance. The vast numbers 
call  into question the traditional  use  of individual "sentinel" cases  to determine 
a causal  relationship and  raise  the  importance of population  level  data.  Overall, 
the literature does  not support an  increased  risk of SNHL following  vaccination 
with  Comirnaty. 
No  signal  of disproportionate reporting  has  been  observed  in  the Pfizer safety 
database for any of the Preferred Terms included  in  the safety database 
search. 
The  O/E  analyses  (through  15 May  2023)  on  deafness and  SNHL supports that 
the reports of hearing  loss  and  tinnitus in  the  stratified  populations and  doses 
are  not greater than  would  be  expected  as  background  occurrences. 
Considering  the totality of the data  available,  a causal  association  between 
Comirnaty and  sensory neural  hearing  loss  is  not supported,  this topic will  be 
monitored  using  routine  pharmacovigilance. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
A review  of hearing  loss  was  included  in  the  previous 3rd  PSUR  in  which  PRAC  endorsed  the  MAH 
conclusion  that a causal  association  between  Comirnaty and  hearing  loss  or tinnitus could  not be 
concluded  (procedure  EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010898/202206). 
In the current 5th  PSUR,  the  MAH  reported  the  results of an  updated  review of sensorineural 
hearing  loss  requested  by TGA  (Australia) through  18 Jun  2023  including  literature (13 articles), 
post-marketing  cases  (BC  level  1:  132 cases;  BC  level  2:  9;  BC  level  3:  1;  BC  level  4:  205;  BC 
level  5:  72  cases)  and  O/E  analyses  (all O/E  ratios well  below  1).  Based  on  provided  data,  MAH's 
conclusion  is  endorsed that a causal  association  between  Comirnaty and  sensorineural  hearing 
loss  is  not supported  at this time and  that the  MAH  should  continue to monitor sensorineural 
hearing  loss through  routine  pharmacovigilance.

MAH's risk assessment of new information 
Based  on  the  interval data,  no  significant new  safety information  was  identified  pertaining to the  risk of 
myocarditis and  pericarditis with  BNT162b2. 
This  risk is  communicated  in  the  BNT162b2 CDS,  in: 
•  Section 4.4, Special  warnings and  precautions for use  - General  recommendations,  which  includes 
information on  appropriate action to be  taken, as  follows:  "Very rare cases  of myocarditis and 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment report

Page  96/142 
pericarditis have  been  reported following  vaccination  with TRADENAME.  Typically, the cases  have 
occurred  more often  in  younger men  and  after the second  dose of the vaccine and  within  14 days 
after vaccination.  Based  on  accumulating data, the  reporting  rates of myocarditis and  pericarditis 
after primary series  in  children  ages  5 through  < 12 years are lower than  in  ages  12 through  17 
years.  Rates of myocarditis and  pericarditis in  booster doses do  not appear to  be  higher than after 
the second  dose  in  the  primary series.  The  cases  are  generally mild,  and  individuals tend  to 
recover within  a short time following  standard  treatment and  rest.  Healthcare  professionals 
should  be  alert to the signs and  symptoms of myocarditis and  pericarditis in  vaccine  recipients". 
•  Section 4.8, Undesirable effects as  adverse drug  reaction  in  the  post authorisation experience. 
•  Appendices A and  B of the  BNT162b2  CDS. 
This  risk will  continue to  be  monitored through  routine and  additional  pharmacovigilance activities as  per 
EU-RMP v.  9.0 adopted  on  10 November 2022. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
During  the interval  period,  1,014 potentially relevant cases  of myocarditis and  pericarditis were  retrieved: 
711  cases  reporting  myocarditis and  379 cases  reporting  pericarditis.  In 76  of these  1014 cases,  both 
myocarditis and  pericarditis were  reported. 
Myocarditis and  pericarditis are included  as  ADRs  in  the Comirnaty  EU  SmPC  section 4.8 with frequency 
very rare,  and  a warning/precaution  regarding  myocarditis and  pericarditis  in  section  4.4: 
There  is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following  vaccination  with  Comirnaty.  These  conditions can 
develop  within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within  14 days.  They have been observed 
more often after the second vaccination,  and more often in  younger males (see section 4.8).  Available data  indicate 
that most cases recover.  Some cases required intensive care support and fatal cases have been observed. 
Healthcare professionals should be alert to  the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis.  Vaccinees 
(including parents or caregivers) should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms 
indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such  as (acute and persisting) chest pain, shortness of breath,  or palpitations 
following  vaccination. 
Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to  diagnose and treat this condition. 
Based  on  provided  data concerning  myocarditis and  pericarditis,  MAH's  conclusion  is  endorsed that no 
new safety information could  be  identified. The  MAH  should  continue to monitor cases  reporting 
myocarditis and  pericarditis after Comirnaty exposure with  routine and  additional  pharmacovigilance. 
2.3.2.  Evaluation of important potential  risks 
In the  PSUR#4,  the  MAH,  based  on  the review of clinical  trial data,  cumulative  PM  data, individual  review 
of cases,  and  real  world  data on  mRNA vaccine effectiveness,  proposed  to  remove the important potential 
risk of Vaccine-Associated  Enhanced  Disease  including  Vaccine-Associated  Enhanced  Respiratory  Disease 
(VAED/VAERD)  from  the  list of the safety concerns.  In the AR  of the  PSUR#4 
(EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010898/202212), the  PRAC  agreed  to  remove VAED/VAERD  from  the  list of safety 
concerns  in  both  RMP  and  PSUR. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
Please  refer regarding  the assessment of the Comirnaty  EU-RMP  version  10.1 to the ongoing  procedure 
EMEA/H/C/005735/11/0188/G which  include the  removal  of VAED/VAERD  from the  list of safety concerns.

2.3.3.  Evaluation of other risks (not categorised as important) 
Adverse events of special  interest (AESis) 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
The  MAH  stated  that,  no  new safety issues/signals or reporting  pattern changes were  detected  concerning 
the cardiovascular AESis,  haematological AESis,  dermatological AESis,  facial  paralysis,  hepatic AESis, 
musculoskeletal AESis,  other AESis,  respiratory AESis,  vasculitic events,  local  adverse reactions,  and/or 
severe reactogenicity.  Consequently these topics are  not discussed  in  this section. 
Response  to the  PRAC  request  1 from the 4th  PSUR  (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010898/202212): 
For future PSURs  in  the section  'Evaluation  of AESI's~  the AESis in  subjects with Malnutrition;  HIV 
infection should only be included and discussed in  the PSUR  if the reporting pattern changes 
and/or there is a safety issue/signal. 
MAH's  response: 
No  new  safety issue/signal  or reporting  pattern  change  was  identified  upon  review of the  incremental  data 
for the AESis  in  subjects with  Malnutrition;  HIV infection. Therefore,  this topic is  not discussed  in  the 
PSUR. 
I Rapporteur assessment comment: 
Noted. 
Anaphylactic AESis 
Search  criteria:  Anaphylactic reaction; Anaphylactic shock; Anaphylactoid reaction; Anaphylactoid shock. 
Clinical  trial  data 
•  Number of cases:  none,  compared to  1 case  (0.32%)  retrieved  in  the PSUR#4. 
Post-authorisation  data 
•  Number of cases:  188 (original  [101],  bivalent Omi  BA.1  [24],  bivalent Omi  BA.4/BA.5  [63]; 
0.25% of 74,102 cases,  the total  PM  dataset), compared  to 421  cases  (0.15%)  retrieved  in  the 
PSUR#4. 
•  Reported  relevant PTs:  Anaphylactic reaction  (146), Anaphylactic shock (43), Anaphylactoid 
reaction  (7). 
•  Relevant event outcome fatal  (4),  resolved/resolving  (109),  resolved  with sequelae  (7),  not 
resolved  (16),  unknown  (60).  In 4  cases  (reporting 4  relevant events with  fatal  outcomes),  the 
reported  causes  of death were Anaphylactic  reaction  (3),  Dyspnoea  (2), Anaphylactic shock, 
Blood  pressure  decreased,  Cardiac failure  acute,  Cerebrovascular accident,  Depressed  level  of 
consciousness,  Respiratory  rate decreased,  Shock (1  each).  All  cases  involved elderly subjects 
(Age  range:  77 to  102 years).  Medical  history was  provided  in  3 cases and  included  PTs  under the 
SOC  Cardiac disorders (4 events),  Metabolism  and  nutrition disorders,  Nervous system  disorders 
(3 events each),  Gastrointestinal  disorders,  Social  circumstances,  Surgical  and  medical 
procedures,  Vascular disorders (2 events each),  Endocrine  disorders,  Psychiatric disorders,  Renal 
and  urinary disorders  (1  event each). 
Analysis Original  versus  Bivalent Vaccines 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment report 
EMA/PRAC/585967 /2023 
Page  98/142 
The  majority of the anaphylaxis cases  were  reported  after administration  of the original vaccine  (52%) 
rather than the  bivalent Omi  BA.4/BA.5 vaccine  (35.7%);  the  PT  most frequently  reported  was 
Anaphylactic  reaction  (70% versus 86%).  Few  cases  of anaphylaxis were  reported  after the 
administration  of bivalent Omi  BA.1,  therefore a meaningful  comparison  of the  PTs  reported  with the 
other 2 vaccines was  not possible. 
O/E  analysis 
Since anaphylaxis has  already been  identified as  a risk of vaccination,  the goal  of the observed versus 
expected  analysis is  risk estimation  rather than signal  identification.  Risk of anaphylaxis is  reported  per 
dose administered  and  compared to rates of anaphylaxis observed  for other vaccines  rather than  rates  in 
an  unexposed  population. 
The  MAH  has conducted  unadjusted  observed  versus expected  analyses for the 9,112 cumulative cases of 
anaphylaxis reported  through  18 June  2023.  Anaphylaxis cases  were  identified  using  the following  PTs: 
anaphylactic shock,  anaphylactic reaction,  anaphylactoid  shock,  and  anaphylactoid  reaction.  A 
background  rate of 1.31 anaphylaxis cases  per million vaccine doses  was  assumed. 
Considering the current status of the vaccination  schedule  and  the availability of only  partial data 
published  worldwide and  on  the  ECDC  websites for doses of BNT162b2 vaccines  (original and  bivalent) 
administered  in  the EU-EEA  countries, the number of doses administered  from  those shipped  was 
estimated  by applying the same administration  percentage  used  in  the  previous PSUR  (76%). Therefore, 
an  estimated  3,507,956,339 doses  (76% of shipped  doses)  were administered. 
Expected  counts were determined  by multiplying the  number of doses administered  by  the expected  rates 
per dose. 
An  O/E  ratio of 1.983 (95% CI  1.942, 2.024) was  observed  for BNT162b2  compared  to the background 
rate for anaphylaxis cases  observed  in  the  US.  This  rate  has  steadily declined  each  reporting  period  from 
the 9.47  (95% CI, 8.61,  10.40) first reported  in  Summary Monthly Safety  Report 2  (through  31  January 
2021) and  has  remained  consistent with that reported  in  the  most recent PSUR.  The  reason  for the 
decline  is  unknown  but could  reflect decreased  reporting,  changes  in  the accuracy of the exposure 
estimate, or changes in  population  being  vaccinated. 
MAH's  conclusion 
No  new significant safety information was  identified  based  on  the  review of these cases  and  on  the 
analyses  by age  group,  O/E,  and  original  vs  bivalent vaccines.  Safety surveillance will  continue. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
No  new important safety information  concerning  anaphylaxis could  be  identified from  the data  in  current 
PSUR.  At the moment, the current risk minimisation  measures described  in  the Comirnaty  product 
information are considered  adequate. 
COVID-19 AESis 
This AESI  with the  MedDRA search  criteria  - SMQ  COVID-19  (Narrow and  Broad)  OR  PTs  Ageusia; 
Anosmia* was foreseen  as  a way to monitor for possible cases  of VAED/VAERD.  Because,  as  agreed  by 
EMA,  VAED/VAERD  has  been  removed  as  a safety concern  (Important potential  risk)  after >2.5 years of 
surveillance, COVID-19 will  no  longer be  considered  an  AESI  for discussion  in  the  PSUR,  however, 
discussion  of lack of efficacy cases  will  continue as  per PSUR  requirements.

Clinical  trial  data 
•  Number of cases:  2 (original  [2];  2.4% of 82  cases,  the total  CT dataset), compared  to 4  cases 
(1.3%)  retrieved  in  the  PSUR#4.  None of the events were  related  to BNT162b2.

Clinical  trial  data 
•  Number of cases:  none;  no  cases  were  retrieved  in  the PSUR#4. 
Post-authorization data 
•  Number of relevant cases:  156 (original  [139],  bivalent Omi  BA.1  [8], bivalent Omi  BA.4/BA.5 
[9];  0.2% of 74,102 cases,  the total  PM  dataset), compared  to  178 cases  (0.06%)  retrieved  in 
the  PSUR#4. 
•  Subjects' gender:  female  (103),  male  (50) and  unknown (3). 
•  Subjects' age  in  years:  n  =  135, range:  14-86, mean:  46.3,  median:  46.0.  When  the subjects' 
age  group was  provided  (n= 137), there were  7 paediatric,  113 adults, and  17 elderly subjects. 
Analysis Original  versus  Bivalent Vaccines 
The  majority of the  long  COVID-19  cases  was  reported  after administration  of the original vaccine  (89%), 
therefore a meaningful  comparison  of the  PTs  reported  in  the 3 vaccines groups was  not possible. 
O/E analysis 
The  current age-stratified  observed  to expected  analysis for ageusia/anosmia  in  the  12-17 years age 
group using  the 21-day risk window had  a O/E  ratio  >1  (1.162;  95% CI  0.927,  1.439) compared  to the 
previous  PSUR.  Of note, the background  rates  used  in  the O/E  analyses were  updated  for 
ageusia/anosmia,  using  the  new ACCESS  publication1,  which  reports one combined  incidence  rate for <19 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment report 
EMA/PRAC/585967 /2023 
Page  100/142 
years and therefore may over- or underestimate background  incidence for some  pediatric age-groups. 
The  confidence  intervals included  1 so  are therefore  not statistically significant,  however, the AE  reports 
for that age  group were  reviewed: 
There were  84  cases  in  which  either ageusia  (71  events), anosmia  (48 events) or both  were  reported 
(total  of 522 AEs).  The  cases  were  reported  between  17 April  2021  and  22  November 2022 and  largely 
described  primary dosing  (dose  1 or 2).  Most cases  were  in  females  (63.1%) compared to males (35.7%) 
and  the  mean  age  was  15.2 years.  Cases  were  mostly non-serious (65.5%);  57  (67.9%) were  non 
medically confirmed  and  27  (32.1%) were  medically confirmed.  Countries contributing at least 10% of 
the cases  were the UK  (20.2%), the US  (16.7%) and  France  (10.7%).  Outcome was  recovered  (with  or 
without sequelae)  or recovering  in  the 39.3% of the cases,  not recovered  in  46.4% of cases and  unknown 
in  14.3% of the cases.  All  reports were  for BNT162b2  (original). 
Concomitant medications were  reported  in  only 13 cases  while  11  reported  medical  histories of COVID-19 
or suspected  COVID-19 and  3  reported  concurrent COVID-19.  Only 4  cases  were  reports of anosmia  alone 
and  7 cases  were  reports of ageusia  alone.  Upon  review of the cases,  the only notable trend apart from 
temporality to vaccination  was the co-reporting of adverse events reflective of systemic reactogenicity 
events and  in  many cases  symptoms of what may also  reflect upper respiratory infections in  this age 
populations.  The  most common  co-reported  events were  pyrexia  (32.1 %), headache  (31.0%), cough 
(22.6%), fatigue  (19.0%),  nausea  (13.1%), oropharyngeal  pain  (11.9%), dyspnoea  (11.9%),  malaise 
(11.9%) and  myalgia  (10.7%). 
Overall,  the information does not represent a new significant finding  or signal.  Reports  of anosmia  and 
ageusia  will  continue to  be  reviewed  by  routine pharmacovigilance.

MAH's  conclusion 
No  new  significant safety information was  identified  based  on  the  review of these cases and  on  the 
analyses  by age  group,  O/E and  original  vs  bivalent vaccines.  Safety surveillance will  continue  and  long 
COVID-19 will  be  discussed  in  the next PSUR  if warranted. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
The  age-stratified observed  to expected  analysis for ageusia/anosmia  in  the  12-17 years age  group using 
the  21-day risk window showed  a O/E  ratio of 1.162 (95% CI  0.927,  1.439) which  is  elevated compared 
to the  previous  PSUR  (O/E  ratio  < 1). The confidence  interval  included  1 and  therefore considered  not 
statistically significant.  As  a  reason  for the elevated  O/E  ratio the  MAH  stated  that the  background  rates 
used  in  the O/E  analyses were  updated for ageusia/anosmia,  using  the  new ACCESS  publication,  which 
reports one combined  incidence  rate for < 19 years and  therefore  may over- or underestimate background 
incidence for some  pediatric age-groups. 
However, the AE  reports  (84 cases  in  which  either ageusia  [71  events],  anosmia  [48 events]  or both) for 
that 12-17 years age  group were  reviewed  and  did  not represent a new significant safety finding  or 
signal. 
No  new important safety concern  could  be  identified for COVID-19 AESis. 
The  MAH  stated  that the MedDRA search  criteria  - SMQ  COVID-19  (Narrow and  Broad)  OR  PTs  Ageusia; 
Anosmia  was foreseen  as a way to  monitor for possible cases of VAED/VAERD.  Because VAED/VAERD  has 
been  removed  as an  important potential  risk,  COVID-19 will  no  longer be  considered  an  AESI  for 
discussion  in  the  PSUR.  This  is  endorsed,  routine pharmacovigilance  is considered  sufficient.

No  new significant safety information was  identified  based  on  the  review of these cases and  on  the 
analyses  by age  group,  O/E,  and  original  vs  bivalent vaccines.  Safety surveillance will  continue. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
For ADEM  (narrow definition), the age  stratified O/E  ratios of more age  groups (18-24 years,  25-49 years, 
and  50-59 years  using  the  21-day risk window and  25-49 years  using  the 42-day risk window)  were  >1 
compared  to the previous 4th  PSUR  (25-49 years age group using the 21-day risk window:  O/E  ratio  1.10 
(95% CI  [0.85,  1.40]).  Furthermore,  in  this PSUR  for the age  group 25-49 years  using  the 21-day risk 
window the O/E  was  1.87 (95% CI  1.47, 2.35), which  is  considered  statistically significant.

Therefore,  the MAH  is  requested  to further discuss  in  detail the  results of the O/E  analyses concerning 
acute disseminated encephalomyelitis  (ADEM,  narrow definition)  with  focus  on  the age group 25-49 
years,  and  perform a cumulative review of (literature)  cases  reporting ADEM  after Comirnaty exposure 
using ADEM  Brighton Collaboration  case  definition and  WHO-UMC  causality assessment per case,  and  an 
updated cumulative O/E analysis,  if applicable.  The  MAH  should  evaluate whether ADEM  should  be  added 
as  an  ADR  in  the Comirnaty Pl.  Request for supplementary information 
Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in  Children /  Adults 
Search  criteria:  PTs  Cytokine release syndrome;  Distributive shock;  Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome; 
Multisystem inflammatory syndrome;  Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults;  Multisystem 
inflammatory syndrome in  children; Systemic inflammatory response syndrome. 
Clinical  Trial  Data 
•  Number of cases:  none;  no  cases  were  retrieved  in  the PSUR#4. 
Post-authorization data 
•  Number of relevant cases:  55  (original  [45],  bivalent Omi  BA.1  [3],  bivalent Omi  BA.4/BA.5  [8]; 
0.07% of 74,102 cases  in  the total  PM  dataset),  compared to 92  (0.03%)  retrieved  in  PSUR#4. 
•  Relevant  PTs:  Multiple organ  dysfunction syndrome (22),  Multisystem  inflammatory syndrome 
(15),  Multisystem  inflammatory syndrome in  children  (7),  Multisystem  inflammatory syndrome in 
adults (5), Systemic inflammatory response  syndrome  (4),  Distributive shock (3). 
•  Relevant event outcome:  fatal  (16),  resolved/resolving  (14),  not resolved  (11),  unknown (15). 
o  Fatal  cases  (15).  In  15 fatal  cases  (reporting  16 relevant events with fatal  outcome), the 
reported  causes of death were coded  to Multiple organ  dysfunction  syndrome (14),  Renal 
failure and Thrombosis (4 each),  Septic shock (3),  Pancreatitis acute,  Cardiogenic shock, 
Cerebrovascular accident,  Necrosis  ischaemic,  Confusional  state,  Pulmonary embolism, 
COVID-19  pneumonia,  Sepsis, Thrombocytopenia,  Cerebral  infarction,  Cardiac arrest, 
Infarction and  Ischaemic stroke (2 each).  Of 15 cases,  11  involved elderly subjects. 
When  the medical  history was  provided  (12 cases),  the  most frequently (;?:2)  reported 
medical  conditions included  Hypertension  (4), Type  2 diabetes  mellitus (3), 
Cholecystectomy,  Diverticulitis,  Dyslipidaemia,  Glomerulonephritis,  Hypothyroidism and 
Obesity (2 each). 
Analysis Original  versus  Bivalent Vaccines 
PM:  original  (45 cases),  bivalent Omi  BA.1  (3 cases),  bivalent Omi  BA.4/BA.5  (8 cases).  There were  no 
paediatric patients administered  bivalent vaccines. 
Among  the three groups,  the  PT  Multiple organ  dysfunction syndrome was the  most frequently reported: 
there were  17 cases  in  the original  group, 4  cases  in  the bivalent Omi  BA.4/BA.5 group and  2 cases  in  the 
bivalent Omi  BA.1  group. 
The  remaining  relevant PTs  were distributed as  follows: 
• 
• 
PT  Multisystem inflammatory syndrome was  reported  in  cases  involving  patients administered the 
original  vaccine  (13 cases)  and  the  bivalent Omi  BA.4/BA.5 vaccine  (2 cases); 
PTs  Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and Systemic inflammatory response 
syndrome were  reported  exclusively in  cases  involving  patients administered the original  vaccine 
(7 cases and  4 cases,  respectively); 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment report 
EMA/PRAC/585967 /2023 
Page  104/142 
• 
• 
PT  Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in  adults was  reported  in  cases  involving patients 
administered the original  vaccine  (3 cases)  and the  bivalent Omi  BA.4/BA.5 vaccine  (2 cases); 
PT  Distributive shock was  reported  in  cases  involving  patients administered the original vaccine  (2 
cases)  and  the  bivalent Omi  BA.1  vaccine  (1  case). 
O/E analysis 
•  O/E analysis was  performed  for Multisystem  inflammatory syndrome:  For the  MIS  analysis,  the 
21-24 years age  group using  the 21-day risk window  meets the signal  criteria  with  an  O/E  ratio 
greater than  ;  however the results are  not statistically significant as  the 95% confidence  intervals 
include  1.  For all  other age groups and  risk windows,  the O/E  ratio is  less than  1.  This  result is 
consistent with the analyses  in  the  most recent  PSUR.

MAH's  conclusion 
No  new significant safety information was  identified  based  on  the  review of these cases and  on  the 
analyses  by age  group,  O/E,  and  original  vs  bivalent vaccines.  Safety surveillance will  continue. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
Please  refer regarding  new cases  of MIS-C/ -A to section  2.2 Signal  evaluation  of this AR. 
The  results of the O/E  analyses for multisystem inflammatory syndrome showed  an  O/E  ratio above  1 for 
the age group 21-24 years  using the 21-day risk window,  (O/E  ratio  1.39, 95% CI  0.64;1.64) which  is 
considered  not statistically significant (same results as  in  the previous 4th  PSUR). 
No  new important safety concern  could  be  identified for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in 
children/adults.

While  the overall O/E  was  <1 and  consistent with  previous PSURs,  the  results for the  12-17 age  group 
(1.822;  95% CI  0.996,  3.057) and  70+ years age  group  (1.441;  95% CI  1.025,  1.971) group are above 
1 using  the  21-day risk window and  for the  12-17 year age  group (1.667;  95% CI  1.018, 2.574)  using 
the 42-day and  the 95% Cis did  not include  1.  The  age-groups reported  in  the  background  publication  do 
not align  exactly with the  PSUR age  groupings and  may underestimate the  background  rates for certain 
groups,  however, the AE  reports for these age  groups were  reviewed: 
The  MedDRA search  strategy for the AESI  Multiple sclerosis  is  comprised  of the  PTs  Multiple sclerosis, 
Multiple sclerosis  relapse  and  Optic neuritis. 
12- to 17-year-olds 
There  were  13 cases  reporting  at least one of these  PTs  for the  12-17-year age  group  (7 events of 
multiple sclerosis/multiple sclerosis  relapse  and  8 events of optic neuritis)  using the 21-day risk window. 
The  cases  were  reported  between  23 August 2021  and  19 April  2022 and  largely described  primary 
dosing  (dose  1 or 2).  Most cases  were  in  females  (84.6%) compared  to males  (15.4%) and  the  mean  age 
was  15.4 years.  Latency  ranged  from  the  day of vaccination to 40 days after vaccination  (mean  10.3 
days). The  cases  were all  categorized  as  serious;  nine (9) of the cases  were  medically confirmed  and  4 
were  non-medically confirmed.  Cases  were from Taiwan,  EU  and  North America.  All  reports were  for 
BNT162b2  (original).  Out of the  13 cases,  5 provided  a description of MRis with  abnormalities consistent 
with demyelination,  however only  1 of these  reported  an  lumbar puncture with IgG oligoclonal  bands  (and 
in  this case  the  patient's neurological  symptoms were  reported  as  starting  11  days prior to dose  1). The 
remaining  8 described  no  diagnostic test results or tests (e.g.,  MRI,  ophthalmological exams) that were 
normal. 
There  were  20  cases  reporting  at least one of these  PTs  for the  12-17-year age  group  using the 42-day 
risk window.  Seven  of the 20  cases  were  included  in  the  21-day  risk window group above.  The  remaining 
13  cases  were  reviewed  and  1 was  determined by this reviewer to  be  a duplicate of one  of the  21-day risk 
window cases.  In another case  the  patient was found  to  be  36  years old.  The  remaining  11  cases  (6 
events of multiple sclerosis and  6 events of optic neuritis) were all  for BNT162b2  (original) and  were 
reported  between  17 March  2021  and  09  February  2023,  largely describing  primary dosing  (dose  1 or 2). 
Six of the  patients were female and  5 male and  they  ranged  in  age from  13 to  17 years  (1  with  no  age 
reported).  Latency  ranged  from  4  days to 2.5  months and  1 case  described  a history of multiple sclerosis. 
All  11  cases  were from  the  EU  and  were  serious;  7 were  medically confirmed  (4  non-medically 
confirmed).  Upon  review,  one case  described  papilledema  and  macular edema  and  was  determined  by the 
reporter to not be  optic neuritis.  Of the remaining  10 cases,  1 described  concurrent COVID-19  and  1 
described  information that was  more consistent with anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein  occurring  in 
conjunction  with an  upper respiratory infection and  5 provided  no  supportive diagnostic information. The 
remaining  3 cases  provided  some diagnostic imaging that was  potentially supportive of the adverse event 
of interest (described  MRI  scans  with  lesions or otherwise consistent with  inflammatory optic neuropathy 
or demyelination). 
70 + year olds 
There  were  39  cases  reporting  at least one of the  PTs  for the 70+ year age  group (17 events of multiple 
sclerosis  relapse,  12 events of multiple sclerosis and  11  events of optic  neuritis). 
The  cases  were  reported  between  22  February  2021  and  15 February 2023.  Most cases  were  in  females 
(33,  84.6%) compared to males (6,  15.4%); ages  ranged  from  70  to 81  years  (mean  73.6). The  cases 
were all  categorized  as  serious;  14 (35.9%) were  medically confirmed  and  25  (64.1%) were  non 
medically confirmed.  Cases  were from the  EU  (31) and  the US  (8). All  reports were  for BNT162b2 
(original). The  majority of the  reports  (28,  71.8%)  provided  no diagnostic information supportive of 
multiple sclerosis or optic  neuritis;  1 of the  28 cases  reported  concurrent COVID-19.  The  remaining  11 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment report 
EMA/PRAC/585967 /2023 
Page  108/142 
cases  had  MRis consistent with demyelination,  optic neuritis or multiple sclerosis or had  ophthalmological 
exams that were suspicious for or diagnostic of optic neuritis;  except 1 case  that described  a patient 
whose ophthalmologist diagnosed  ischemic optic neuritis. The  remaining  10 cases  occurred  after doses  1, 
2 or 3 with a latency ranging  from  the same day of vaccination  to 26 days (unspecified  latency in  2 
cases).  Of the  10 reports providing  medical  history, 4  had  medical  histories of either multiple sclerosis or 
optic neuritis.  Outcomes were  recovered  or recovered  with  sequelae  in  6,  not recovered  in  3 and  unknown 
in  1 report. 
Upon  review,  many of the cases  in  these age  groups do  not clearly describe the diagnoses of interest for 
monitoring the AESI  of multiple sclerosis. The available information  does  not support a new significant 
finding  or signal.  Multiple sclerosis will  continue to  be  monitored  with  routine  pharmacovigilance.

MAH's  conclusion 
No  new  significant safety information was  identified  based  on  a review of these cases and  on  the analyses 
by age group,  O/E and  original vs  bivalent vaccines.  Safety surveillance will  continue. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
For multiple sclerosis  it is  noted that in  the O/E analyses,  the O/E  ratio was  >1  for the  12-17 age group 
(1.822;  95% CI  0.996,  3.057) and  70+ years age  group (1.441;  95% CI  1.025,  1.971) group using  the 
21-day risk window and  for the  12-17 year age  group  (1.667;  95% CI  1.018,  2.574)  using  the 42-day 
risk window.  These  are considered  (borderline)  statistically significant and  is  new compared  to the 
previous 4th  PSUR.  However,  based  on  the  provided  data, the review of the cases  reporting  multiple 
sclerosis did  not support new significant safety information concerning  multiple sclerosis and  Comirnaty 
exposure. 
No  new  important safety concern  could  be  identified for neurological AESis.

o  Fatal  cases  (3).  In 3 cases  (reporting  3 relevant events with fatal  outcome), the reported 
causes  of death were coded  to Granulomatosis with  polyangiitis  (2) and  Nephrotic 
syndrome  (1).  Medical  history was  provided  in  all  3 cases and  included  Fluid  retention, 
Haemodialysis, and  Glomerulonephritis and  Renal  failure  (1  each). 
Analysis Original  versus  Bivalent Vaccines 
PM:  original  (92), bivalent Omi  BA.1  (3), and  bivalent Omi  BA.4/BA.5  (8). The  number of cases  for 
bivalent Omi  BA.1,  and  bivalent Omi  BA.4/BA.5  (5 and  8,  respectively)  are too small  to all  for a 
meaningful comparison  to the occurrence of Glomerulonephritis/nephrotic syndrome in  cases  treated  with 
BNT162b2. 
O/E analysis 
O/E analysis was  performed  for Glomerulonephritis/nephrotic syndrome.  All  O/E  ratios were  < 1. 
MAH's  conclusion 
No  new  significant safety information  has emerged  based  on  the  review of these  cases  and  on  the 
analyses  by age  group,  O/E and  original  vs  bivalent vaccines.  Safety surveillance will  continue. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
No  new  important safety concern  could  be  identified for glomerulonephritis and  nephrotic syndrome

o  Fatal  cases  (78).  In 78 cases  (reporting  92  relevant events with  fatal  outcome),  the 
reported  causes of death  (~3)  were coded  to the  PTs  Cerebrovascular accident (24), 
Cerebral  haemorrhage (15),  Ischaemic stroke  (12), Cerebral  infarction  (8),  Cerebral 
thrombosis (7), Subarachnoid  haemorrhage  (5),  Haemorrhage intracranial  (3). 
Analysis Original  versus Bivalent Vaccines 
PM:  original  (571),  bivalent Omi  BA.1  (52),  and  bivalent Omi  BA.4/BA.5  (141). 
•  Among  the frequently  (~3%) reported  stroke related  events by original  cases,  bivalent Omi  BA.1 
cases,  and  bivalent Omi  BA.4/BA.5 cases during the reporting  interval,  it was  observed  that: 
o  PTs  Cerebral  ischaemia  and  Cerebral  venous sinus thrombosis were  reported  at a higher 
frequency  in  subjects administered original  when  compared  to subjects administered 
bivalent Omi  BA.1  and  bivalent Omi  BA.4/BA.5  (Cerebral  ischaemia  [3.5% in  original  vs 
none in  bivalent Omi  BA.1  and  2.8% in  bivalent Omi  BA.4/BA.5],  Cerebral  venous sinus 
thrombosis  [6.5% in  original  vs  none  in  bivalent Omi  BA.1  and  2.1% in  bivalent Omi 
BA.4/BA. 5]). 
o  PT  Cerebral  haemorrhage was  reported  at a higher frequency  in  subjects administered 
bivalent Omi  BA.4/BA.5  (11.3%) when  compared to subjects administered original  (6.8%) 
and  bivalent Omi  BA.1  (3.8%).  No  significant difference observed  in  the other most 
frequently reported  events among these groups. 
0/E analysis 
• 
0/E analysis was  performed  for Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis,  Ischemic stroke and 
Hemorrhagic stroke.  0/E ratios for ischemic stroke and  hemorrhagic stroke were well  below  1. 
For the CVST analysis using  the  low  background  rate  {Table  12),  males and females  18-24 and 
25-49 years,  as  well  as  overall  monovalent dose  1 and  dose  2,  meet the signal  criteria  with  an 
0/E ratio greater than  1 in  either the 21-day and/or 42-day risk windows.  However, the 95% Cls 
for some age groups included  1,  indicating that the result is  not statistically significant.  For all 
other stratifications using  the  low  background  rate,  the 0/E ratio is  less  than  1.  Using  the  mid 
range  background  rate  (Table  13), all  stratifications have an  0/E ratio less than  1.  These  results 
are consistent with  the analyses  in  the most recent  PSUR.

MAH's  conclusion 
No  new  significant safety  information  have  emerged  based  on  the  review  of these  cases  and  on  the 
analyses  by  age  group,  O/E and  original  VS  bivalent vaccines.  Safety surveillance will  continue. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
It is  noted  that for cerebral  venous sinus thrombosis the O/E analysis results for the  18-24 and  25-49-
year age  groups (in  both  males and females)  using  the low background  rate for both  the 21-day and  42-
day risk windows (O/E ratios  > 1) are consistent with the previous 3rd  and  4th  PSURs.

Rapporteur assessment comment: 
No  new important safety concern  could  be  identified for thromboembolic AESis. 
MAH's overall AESI conclusion 
Considering that the  review  of the cases  reporting AESis  identified  no  new  significant safety information, 
the  MAH  proposes to  include and  discuss AESis  in  future  PSURs  only if the reporting  pattern changes 
and/or significant new safety information is  evident.

At this time, the  BNT162b2 vaccines  have been  administered  to an  unprecedented  number of individuals 
worldwide and  approximately 30  months of clinical  trial safety data  review,  post-authorization 
surveillance  and  signal  management activities have elapsed.  The  safety profile  of the COVID-19 vaccine  is 
well-characterized,  however surveillance will  continue. 
Based  on  regulatory authority feedback,  knowledge gained  about the product safety profile,  and  the 
recognition that AESis for products will  evolve over time as  knowledge about a product's safety profile 
grows,  it is  appropriate to review the AESI/TME  list and  revise  it as  needed  to stay current and  improve 
surveillance.  Pfizer will  continue to utilize and  refine the AESI  list as  appropriate for signal  detection 
activities (including  O/E  analyses)  and  in  preparation for safety aggregate reports.  At present,  the AESI 
list is  synonymous with the targeted  medical  event (TME)  list which  is  a  MedDRA-based  list of >1900 
unique  PTs,  leading  to  more of a SOC-based  approach  of aggregate case  review.  Commensurate with the 
safety profile of the vaccine, the future AESI  list will  reflect specific medical  conditions coupled  with 
appropriate  MedDRA-derived  search  strategies for each  AESI. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
MAH' s proposal  is  agreed to include and  discuss AESis  in  future  PSURs  only if the  reporting  pattern 
changes and/or significant new  safety information is  evident. 
For future  PSURs,  in  'Adverse  Events of Special  Interest (AESis)' of section 'Evaluation of Other Risks  (not 
categorised  as  important)', the AESis should  only be  included  and  discussed  in  the PSUR  if the  reporting 
pattern changes and/or there is  a safety issue/signal.  Request for next PSUR 
Response  to the  PRAC  request 2 from the 4th  PSUR  (EMENH/C/PSUSA/00010898/202212): 
For future PSURs  in  the section  'Evaluation  of Other Risks  (not categorised as important)~  the 
reactogenicity on  individuals previously exposed or not to SARS-COV-2,  the systemic adverse 
reactions,  and the age-related adverse reactions should only be included and discussed in  the 
PSUR  if the reporting pattern changes and/or there is a safety issue/signal. 
MAH's  response: 
No  new  safety issue/signal  or reporting  pattern  change  was  identified  upon  review of the incremental  data 
for the reactogenicity on  individuals previously exposed  or not to SARS-COV-2,  the systemic adverse 
reactions,  and  the age-related  adverse  reactions.  Therefore, these topics are  not discussed  in  the  PSUR.

the  overdose,  abuse,  misuse,  and  drug dependency, occupational  exposure,  off-label  use,  and/or 
unexpected therapeutic effect.  Consequently these topics are  not discussed  in  this section.

Lack of therapeutic efficacy 
Search  Criteria:  PTs  Drug ineffective,  Vaccination  failure. 
Clinical  trial  data 
• 
There was  no  lack of efficacy cases  in  the clinical  trial  dataset for both this reporting  period  and 
for the reporting  period  of PSUR#4. 
Post-authorization data 
•  Number of cases:  7048  (original  [4896],  bivalent Omi  BA.1  [196],  bivalent Omi  BA.4/BA.5 
[1956])  (9.5% of 74,102 cases,  the total  PM  dataset), compared  to  56,095 cases  (19.8%)  in 
PSUR#4. 
• 
The  increase  in  the  reporting  proportion of LOE  cases  was  multifactorial: 
o  A high  number of cases  were  reported  from Austria  (40,496 cases  in  the current PSUR), 
as  compared  to the  previous PSURs  (31,629 cases  in  PSUR  #3, 9009 cases  in  PSUR  #2 
and  204 cases  in  PSUR  #1) due to the active solicitation  of LOE  cases,  including 
retrospective cases,  by the Austrian  Board  of Health starting from August 2021. 
Additionally,  reviewing  Austria  cases,  it is  notable that these case  reports,  although 
received  during the current reporting  period,  were  reflective of events that had  occurred 
during earlier vaccination  campaigns with  BNT162b2  Original. 
o 
In addition, the epidemiology of the virus has changed  since  December 2021  in  that the 
Omicron variant has  become  predominant in  most regions.  The  majority of the  LOE  cases 
received  during the current reporting  interval  involved the  monovalent vaccine,  the 
efficacy of which  against Omicron  variants is  less than against the previous dominant 
variants of concern.  The  first approval  of BNT162b2  bivalent vaccine  was  received  in  US 
on  02 Sep  2022. 
o  Of note, there are  BNT162b2  LOE  reports created  from AE  reports received  for 
Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir (Paxlovid®)  based  on  the  BNT162b2 vaccine  history reported  in  the 
cases  (AEs  reported for Paxlovid  in  individuals with  COVID  19 following  vaccination  with 
BNT162b2 will  be  appropriately databased as  LOE  cases  for BNT162b2  as  well). 
SARS-CoV-2  Variants  (48 cases) 
• 
In 48 of the 7048 cases,  information  on  SARS-CoV-2  variants was  provided: 
o  Delta  variant (10 cases), 
o  Omicron variant (40 cases).

Literature 
•  During  the reporting  interval,  there were  no  new significant data  received  from  literature sources. 
MAH's  conclusion 
No  new safety signals  have emerged  based  on  a review of these cases. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
No  new important safety concern  could  be  identified for lack of therapeutic efficacy. 
For future  PSURs,  in  'Evaluation of special  situations' of section 'Evaluation  of Other Risks  (not 
categorised  as  important)',  lack of therapeutic efficacy should  only be  included  and  discussed  in  the PSUR 
if the  reporting  pattern  changes and/or there is a safety issue/signal.  Request for next PSUR 
Update on special  populations 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
The  MAH  stated  that,  no  new safety issues/signals or reporting  pattern  changes were detected concerning 
the use  in  frail  patients with co-morbidities,  and/or interactions with  other vaccines.  Consequently these 
topics are not discussed  in  this section. 
Response  to the  PRAC  request 4  from the 4th  PSUR  (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010898/202212): 
For future PSURs  in  the section  'Update  on special populations~  the use  in  elderly should only be 
included and discussed in  the PSUR  if the reporting pattern changes and/or there is a safety 
issue/signal. 
MAH's  conclusion:  Upon  review of the incremental data of cases  reported  in  elderly population,  no  new 
safety issues/signals or reporting  pattern changes  were detected. This  population  has  been  removed  from 
the populations discussed  in  this section.

inflammation (1  each). 
o  The  3 fatal  cases are summarised  below: 
■  The  1st  case  (NMC)  reported  only  PT  Death  as  the fatal  AE.  Neither cause  of death 
nor information on  autopsy was  provided  in  this case  involving a 2-year-old  male 
subject "who died  after being  vaccinated  (timing of vaccination  and  date of death 
was  not reported.)".  Limited  information was  provided,  precluding  any  meaningful 
assessment. 
■  The  2nd  case  (MC)  originated from  Japanese  Pharmaceuticals and  Medical  Devices 
Agency  (PMDA),  in  which  the  1-year-old male subject received  dose  3 (maroon 
cap)  for COVID-19  immunisation on  16 February  2023.  On  the  next day,  he 
experienced  minor pyrexia  and  productive cough.  On  18  February  2023, the 
subject developed cardio-respiratory arrest and  his  body temperature decreased 
and  died  on  the same day,  although  treatments included endotracheal  intubation, 
gastric intubation,  intraosseous  needle placement,  adrenaline intravenous 
injection,  and  Meylon  (sodium  bicarbonate)  intravenous injection.  In this case,  the 
subject had  severe  underlying  diseases  (such  as  blood  calcium  abnormal,  blood 
phosphorus abnormal,  cardiac failure,  cardiac  hypertrophy, congenital  nephrotic 
syndrome, gastrooesophageal  reflux disease,  gene mutation  [Pierson  syndrome], 
hypertension,  hypertensive  heart disease,  hyperuricaemia,  peritoneal  dialysis, 
respiratory disorder,  respiratory muscle weakness,  therapeutic aspiration, and 
upper respiratory tract inflammation),  making  it difficult to determine the causal 
relationship  between the vaccination  and  the fatal  event (PT coded  to Cardio 
respiratory arrest). 
■  The  3rd  case  (MC)  originated from Taiwan  Center for Disease Control,  which 
involved a 4-year-old  male subject,  who  experienced  events with  PTs  coded  to

In 4  MC  cases,  limited  information was  provided,  precluding  any meaningful 
assessment.  The  subjects' medical  history/underlying conditions,  concomitant 
medications, or date of death  were  not reported.  Neither lab data  nor information 
on  autopsy was  provided  in  these 4 cases. 
In 2 NMC  cases  reported  by a lawyer,  both adolescents (unspecified  ages)  were 
reported  to  have  sudden  cardiac arrest within  a week of BNT162b2 vaccination. 
Although  it was  not reported  if autopsies were  performed, the reporter stated  that 
"pathologists recognized  signs of poisoning  and  concluded  that poisoning  by the 
vaccine-induced  spike  protein  was  more  likely to lead  to death." Information on 
subject's medical  history,  concomitant medications and  date of death was  not 
provided. 
In  1 MC  case,  a  17-year-old male  subject received  expired  BNT162b2 for COVID-
19 immunisation  (PT coded  to Expired  product administered). The  subject 
experienced  fatal  events  (acute myocardial  infarction,  headache,  pain,  and 
vomiting)  about 2  months after vaccination.  The  subject's medical  history, 
concomitant medications,  date of death and  information  on  autopsy were  not 
reported. 
In 4  cases,  the  underlying  medical  conditions could  have  predisposed  to the 
occurrence of the fatal  AEs: 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment report 
EMA/PRAC/585967 /2023 
Page  121/142 
•  One  (1)  MC  case  involved  a  14-year-old male subject,  who  received 
BNT162b2  dose  1, 0.3  ml  single for COVID-19  immunisation and 
neuromuscular disease  (fatal  PT  coded  to Off label  use).  Other fatal  PTs 
were coded  to Circulatory collapse,  Pyrexia,  Dyspnoea,  Hypotonia, 
Hyperpyrexia,  Chills,  Pericarditis,  and  Myocarditis.  The  subject's death 
was  possibly due to  his severe  underlying conditions,  coded  as  Becker's 
muscular dystrophy, cerebral  palsy,  cochlea  implant, COVID-19, 
hypoacusis,  intellectual  disability,  language  disorder,  mental disability, 
neuromyopathy,  physical  disability,  quadriparesis,  and  wheelchair user. 
•  One  (1)  NMC  case  involved a  15-year-old female subject who  had 
• 
• 
underlying  myeloid  leukaemia, which  could  attribute to her fatal  events 
(myocarditis, disease  recurrence,  and  myeloid  leukaemia). 
In  1 MC  case,  a  14-year-old female subject had  severe  underlying 
condition  of Dravet syndrome and  COVID-19  and  was  medicated  with 
multiple antiepileptic drugs, which  were confounding factors for the 
causality assessment between  BNT162b2 vaccination  and  her fatal  events 
(vaccination  failure,  COVID-19,  hyperthermia,  shock,  COVID-19 
pneumonia, and  cardiac arrest). 
In  1 MC  case,  although the  medical  history was  not reported,  the  17-year 
old  female  subject received  multiple concomitant medications (such  as 
amitriptyline,  azathioprine,  buprenorphine, colecalciferol,  etanercept, 
paracetamol,  piroxicam,  prednisolone,  and  zoledronic acid),  which  were 
confounding factors for determination of the causal  relationship  between 
BNT162b2 vaccination  and  the fatal  events (arrhythmogenic right 
ventricular dysplasia,  Escherichia  sepsis,  and  vomiting). 
■ 
In the  remaining  2 cases,  potential explanations other than  vaccination  for death 
are  not evident in  the  reports  however in  the first case  there is  very  limited 
information  provided: 
• 
• 
In  1 NMC  case,  a  12-year-old female  subject died  of myocardial  infarction 
5 days after receiving  BNT162b2 as  dose  1, single for COVID-19 
immunisation. The  subject's medical  history,  concomitant medications, 
and  information on  autopsy were  not reported. 
In  1 MC  literature case  reporting  a  14-year-old female subject with 
following  fatal  PTs  Myopericarditis,  Cardiac failure,  Arrhythmia, 
Arrhythmia  supraventricular,  Myocarditis,  Pericarditis,  and  Sudden  death, 
no  confounding  factors  have  been  identified. Autopsy result showed 
inflammatory findings of pericardia!  tissue. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
During  the interval  period,  post-marketing  1,287 cases  were  retrieved  including  13 fatal  cases  of which  9 
medically confirmed  fatal  cases:  1 literature case  reporting  vaccine-related  myopericarditis that led  to 
severe arrhythmias and  progressive  heart failure  as  the cause  of death,  3 cases  with  underlying  medical 
conditions,  and  5 cases  had  limited  information.  In the  previous 4th  PSUR there were  reported  28  fatal 
cases  of which  21  medically confirmed fatal  cases  (45 medically confirmed fatal  cases  in  the  3rd  PSUR, 
and  40  medically confirmed  fatal  case  in  the  2nd  PSUR). 
No  important new  information could  be  identified  regarding  the use  of Comirnaty in  children/adolescents 
12-17 years of age.

Analysis of confounders and  risk factors 
•  Among  the 2961  cases  involving  paediatric subjects,  763  cases  included  one or more confounders 
that prevented a clear causality assessment:  co-suspect and/or concomitant drugs (355 cases) 
and/or underlying  medical  history (546 cases). 
Literature 
•  During  the reporting  period,  a literature article  reporting  important safety information about the 
use  of bivalent vaccines  and  children  aged  5-11 years was  identified.  Please  refer to Section  11 
Literature of the  PSUR for further details. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
Please  refer to section  1.2.5.5 'Literature' in  this AR  regarding  the publication of Hause et al.  reporting 
that no  reports of myocarditis were  recorded  in  VAERS  by 01  January 2023  for the 861,251  children  aged 
5-11  years,  who  received  a bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech  booster in  the  US  in  the same  period. 
MAH's  conclusion 
Upon  review,  the most frequently reported  AEs  indicative of vaccination  errors had  a higher reporting 
proportion  in  paediatric groups  <5 years and ;::,:5  Years  and .::;11  Years  of Ages  compared to the ;::,:12  years 
of age;  while the most frequent AEs  indicative of reactogenicity type  had  a higher reporting  proportion  in 
paediatric group a2 years of age  compared  to groups of <5 years and  ;::,:5  Years and .::;11  Years of Ages. 
Of the frequently reported  AEs  (;::,:2%)  in  the  paediatric dataset,  Pyrexia  had  a higher reporting  proportion 
compared  to the non-paediatric dataset (4.7% vs  2.6%). The  medication errors reported  in  this 
population  were  in  large  majority not associated  with  harm. 
No  new  significant safety information was  identified  based  on  the  review of the cases  reported  in  the 
overall  paediatric population.  The  most frequently reported  AEs  were consistent with  the known 
reactogenicity and  safety profile of the vaccine  and  listed  in  Section 4.4 Special  warnings and  precautions 
for use  and/or in  Section  4.8 Undesirable effects of the CDS. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
Based  on  provided  data,  MAH's  conclusion  is  endorsed  that no  important new information  could  be 
identified  regarding  the  use  of Comirnaty in  paediatric groups  <5 years,  ;::,:5  years  - .::;11  years,  and a2 
years of age.

Two  (2) serious retrospective  maternal cases  reported  event coded  to the  PT Abortion 
spontaneous (1  each),  which  occurred  in  the vaccinated  pregnant females.  In these  2 cases  only 
the event of abortion  spontaneous was  reported  and  the trimester of exposure was  unknown.  Of 
these  2 cases,  in  1 case  the subject had  a medical  history of hypertension and  was on 
concomitant medication  ethinylestradiol,  levonorgestrel which  might have contributed to the 
reported  event.  In the  remaining  case  there was  limited  information  regarding the obstetric 
history which  precluded  meaningful causality assessment.

available in  7 cases.  Of these  7 cases,  in  3 cases  foetus  was  exposed  during  1st trimester, 
in  3 cases  foetus  was  exposed  during  2nd  trimester and  in  1 case  foetus  was  exposed 
during  3rd  trimester.  Of these  12 cases,  in  1 case  mother of the baby  had  a medical 
history of tobacco  use which  might have contributed  to the  reported  event i.e., 
hypospadias and  cerebral  calcification.  In the remaining  11  cases,  there was  limited 
information  regarding  mother's obstetric  history which  precluded  meaningful  causality 
assessment. 
o  Pregnancy outcome:  Spontaneous abortion:  14 cases  reported  spontaneous abortion.  Of 
these  14 cases,  information  regarding  trimester of exposure was  provided  in  2 cases.  Of 
these 2 cases,  in  1 case  foetus was  exposed  during  1st trimester,  in  1 case  foetus was 
exposed  during  2nd  trimester. The  clinical  events in  these  14 cases  other than  exposure 
related  events were coded  to PTs  Congenital  anomaly (5),  Foetal  growth  restriction  (4), 
Foetal  cardiac disorder,  Foetal  chromosome abnormality (2 each),  Brain  malformation, 
Cerebellar hypoplasia,  Double outlet right ventricle,  Foetal  cardiac arrest,  Foetal  death, 
Foetal  disorder,  Foetal  malformation, Skeletal  dysplasia  (1  each).  In these  14 cases,  there 
was  limited  information  regarding  obstetric history or co  suspect medications of mother 
which  precluded  meaningful causality assessment. 
o  Pregnancy outcome:  Elective termination:  3 cases  reported  elective termination of 
pregnancy  due to foetal  defects.  In all  these  3 cases,  foetus was exposed  during  1st 
trimester. The events reported  in  these  3 cases  other than exposure  related  events were 
coded  to PTs  Abortion  induced,  Congenital  central  nervous system anomaly,  Exomphalos, 
Foetal  cystic  hygroma,  Foetal  death,  Foetal  heart rate abnormal  (1  each).  In these 3 
cases,  there was  limited information regarding  obstetric history or co  suspect  medications 
of mother which  precluded  meaningful causality assessment. 
o  Pregnancy outcome:  Stillbirth:  1 case  reported foetal  death/ neonatal death. This case 
reported  stillbirth with  foetal  defects.  In this case  foetus was  exposed  during  1st 
trimester. The events reported  in  this case  other than exposure related  events were

this case,  there was  limited information  regarding  obstetric history or co  suspect 
medications of mother which  precluded  meaningful causality  assessment. 
o  Pregnancy outcome:  Live  birth without congenital  anomaly:  27  cases  reported  live birth 
babies without congenital  anomaly.  Of these  27  cases,  information  regarding  trimester of 
exposure was available in  7 cases.  Of these  7 cases,  in  1 case,  foetus was exposed  during 
1st trimester,  in  1 case,  foetus was  exposed  during  2nd trimester,  and  in  5 cases,  foetus 
was  exposed  during  3rd  trimester. The frequently  reported  events (:?:2)  in  these  27  cases 
other than  exposure related  events were coded  to PTs  Premature baby (6),  Foetal  heart 
rate deceleration  abnormality, Infantile apnoea, Jaundice neonatal  (2 each).  In these 
remaining  27 cases,  there was  limited  information  regarding  mother's obstetric  history 
which  precluded  meaningful causality assessment.

During  the interval  period,  119 lactation cases  (0.2% of the total  PM  dataset)  compared to 302 cases 
(0.1%) were  retrieved  in  the 4th  PSUR. 
Regarding  the  57  cases  with  pregnancy outcome:  12 (21%) of these cases  reported  live birth with 
congenital  anomalies,  14 cases  (25%)  reported  spontaneous abortion,  3 cases  (5%)  reported  elective 
termination of pregnancy,  1 case  (2%)  reported  foetal  death/ neonatal  death, and  27 cases  (47%) 
reported  live  birth  babies  without congenital  anomaly.  Compared  to the  pregnancy outcomes in  the 
previous interval  period  (n=125) these  were 47 (38%),  10 (8%), 4  (3%), 9  (7%), and  55  (44%) 
respectively.

Overall,  based  on  provided  data  in  the current PSUR,  it is agreed  that no  new safety concerns  were 
identified for use  in  pregnant/lactating women.  The Comirnaty product information  reflects that 
Comirnaty can  be  used  during  pregnancy and  breastfeeding.

2.4.1.  Characterisation of important identified and potential risks 
• 
• 
Important Identified  Risk:  Myocarditis and  Pericarditis 
Important Potential  Risk:  In the  PSUR#4,  the MAH,  based  on  the review of clinical  trial  data, 
cumulative  PM  data, individual  review of cases,  and  real  world  data  on  mRNA vaccine 
effectiveness,  proposed to remove the  important potential  risk of VAED/VAERD  from the  list of 
the safety concerns.  In the AR,  the  PRAC  agreed  to  remove VAED/VAERD  from the  list of safety 
concerns  in  both  RMP  and  PSUR. 
Please  see Appendix 8  of the  PSUR  (not reproduced  here) for the characterisation  of the important 
identified  and  important potential  risks  of BNT162b2,  consistent with  Part II, Module SVII of the 
BNT162b2  EU-RMP version  10.0 approved  on  22 Jun  2023. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
Please  refer regarding  the important identified  and  potential  risks to section  2.1 'Summary of safety 
concerns' of the AR  above.  During the reporting  period,  the important potential  risk Vaccine-Associated 
Enhanced  Disease  (VAED),  including Vaccine-Associated  Enhanced  Respiratory  Disease  (VAERD)  was 
removed  from  the list of safety concerns  in  the Comirnaty EU-RMP.

3.  Benefit evaluation 
BNT162b2  is  indicated  for active immunisation to  prevent COVID-19 caused  by  SARS  CoV-2 virus in 
individuals 6  months of age  and  older. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
There are no  new data on  efficacy that alters previous assessments which  are described  in  the approved 
product information  of Comirnaty. 
After DLP  in  August 2023,  an  adapted Comirnaty vaccine targeting the Omicron  XBB.1.5  subvariant 
named  Comirnaty Omicron  XBB.1.5  (raxtozinameran)  has  been  authorised  (procedure 
EMENH/C/005735/11/0183) to  be  used  for preventing  COVID-19  in  adults and  children  from  6  months of 
age.  In line with  previous recommendations  by  EMA and the European  Centre for Disease  Prevention  and 
Control  (ECDC),  adults and  children from  5 years of age  who  require vaccination  should  have a single 
dose,  irrespective of their COVID-19 vaccination  history.  Children from  6  months to 4 years of age  may 
have one or three doses depending on  whether they have completed  a primary vaccination  course or 
have  had  COVID-19. 
4.  Benefit-risk balance 
During  the reporting  period  of the PSUR,  the important potential  risk Vaccine-Associated  Enhanced 
Disease  (VAED),  including Vaccine-Associated  Enhanced  Respiratory Disease  (VAERD)  was  removed  from 
the  list of safety concerns  in  both  RMP  and  PSUR,  as the available  cumulative data  (clinical  trial and  post 
marketing) showed  no  safety information that substantiates retaining  VAED/VAERD  as an  important 
potential  risk.  VAED/VAERD  should  continue to monitor through  routine pharmacovigilance. 
The  risks  have been  evaluated  in  the context of the  benefits of the vaccine.  No  additional  changes to the 
Comirnaty risk minimisation  measures are warranted. 
Based  on  the  PRAC  Rapporteur review of the available safety and  efficacy/effectiveness data from  the 
current reporting  period  for the Comirnaty  PSUR,  the benefit-risk balance of Comirnaty Original 
(tozinameran),  Comirnaty Original/Omicron  BA.1  (tozinameran  and  riltozinameran),  and  Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron  BA.4-5  (tozinameran and  famtozinameran)  remains  unchanged. 
The  MAH  should  continue to  review the safety of Comirnaty,  including all  reports of adverse events and 
should  propose an  update of the  product information  if an  evaluation  of the safety data  identifies 
important new safety  information, as  applicable. 
In the  previous 4th  PSUSA  (procedure  EMEA/H/C/PSUSN00010898/202212) changes  of the  PSUR 
frequency  was  proposed:  one additional  6-monthly PSUR  (DLP  December 2023) will  be  submitted, then  a 
first yearly  PSUR  (DLP  December 2024), to  be  followed  by further yearly  PSURs  according  to the  list of 
Union  reference dates (EURD). 
5.  PRAC  Rapporteur request for supplementary information 
1.  Regarding  exposure in  clinical  trials,  in  the previous fourth  PSUR the  MAH  reported  that 8,958

Rapporteur assessment comment: 
The difference in  the  number of cumulative clinical  trial  participants receiving  blinded therapy between 
the 4th  and  5th  PSUR  is  due to unblinding  of the participants' study intervention for the studies C4591007,

PRAC request 2:  Regarding myocarditis,  the MAH is requested to discuss the study of Yonker et al. 
(Yonker LM,  Swank Z,  Bartsch  YC,  et al.  Circulating Spike Protein  Detected in  Post-COVID-19 mRNA 
Vaccine  Myocarditis.  Circulation.  2023;147:867-876.  DOI: 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.061025) with 
a  focus on  the possibilities to mitigate individualized risk on myocarditis a~er Comirnaty exposure. 
MAH  response 
In the Yonker et al  publication, the authors evaluated  blood  samples from  61  subjects who  had  received  a 
COVID-19  mRNA vaccination.  A subset of the subjects had  developed  myocarditis (n=16) and  another 
subset (n=45) did  not develop myocarditis (vaccinated  control  subjects). The  authors evaluated  blood 
and  plasma  samples from  all  subjects  looking  for differences between  samples from  subjects that 
experienced  myocarditis versus vaccinated  control  subjects.  Specifically, they examined  the differences in 
the concentrations of SARS-CoV-2  antibodies,  SARS-CoV-2 antigens (eg, full  length spike  protein), and 
cytokines,  and  performed  haematology and T-cell  profiling.  Of all  the analytical  comparisons, the findings 
that correlated  with statistical significance with  myocarditis were  increased  circulating  cytokines (eg,  IL-8, 
IL-6, IL-10, IL-1 B,  TNF  a, IFN y)  and  unbound,  circulating  full  length spike  protein.  Elevations in 
circulating  cytokines in  patients with  post-vaccine associated  myocarditis have  been  previously described 
in  the literature (Barmada  et al,  2023). 1  However, a statistically significant correlation  is  not indicative of 
a causal  relationship  between  circulating  cytokines or unbound, circulating full  length spike  protein  and 
vaccine-associated  myocarditis,  given  that the mechanism  behind  myocarditis is  not fully elucidated.  As 
such, the interpretation  of the  MAH  is  that these  findings are  interesting and  may be  worth  further 
investigation.  However,  at this time, the findings,  which  were obtained  from  patients with ongoing 
myocarditis, could  only be  used  as  potential  indicators of post-vaccine associated  myocarditis in  addition 
to other more traditional  parameters (such  as  clinical  presentation, troponin, cardiac  imaging, or 
endomyocardial  biopsies),  as  opposed  to causal  agents. Therefore, the  MAH  considers that without 
causality between these findings and  the occurrence of myocarditis, there is  no  intervention or 
individualised  risk mitigation that can  be  implemented. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
MAH's conclusion  is endorsed,  that at this time,  a statistically significant correlation  is  not a proof of a 
causal  relationship  between  circulating  cytokines or unbound, circulating  full  length  spike  protein  and 
vaccine-associated  myocarditis,  because the mechanism  behind  myocarditis is  not fully elucidated. 
Without causality between  these findings and  the occurrence of myocarditis, there is  no  risk mitigation 
that can  be  implemented.

PRAC request 3:  Regarding the AESI acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM),  the MAH is 
requested to further discuss in detail the results of the O/E analyses concerning ADEM (narrow definition) 
with focus on the age group 25-49 years,  and perform a cumulative review of (literature) cases reporting 
ADEM a~er Comirnaty exposure using ADEM Brighton Collaboration case definition and WHO-UMC

MAH  response 
Observed versus expected analysis 
The  MAH  conducted  unadjusted  observed  to expected  ratio  (O/E) analyses for the ADEM  cases  reported 
cumulatively through  15  May  2023  globally. These  analyses were  conducted  to provide additional detail 
related  to O/E  results  provided  in  the  PSUR,  specifically sensitivity analyses  using  a  higher background 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment report 
EMA/PRAC/585967 /2023 
Page  130/142 
rate for ADEM  as  well  as  a refined  case  definition  using  the ADEM  Brighton  Collaboration  case  definition 
for certainty levels  1-3. 
Methods 
Observed  cases  were defined  using  the following  PT:  acute disseminated encephalomyelitis.  In Table  2 
and Table  3,  O/E  results  using  21- and  42-day risk windows  post Pfizer-BioNTech  COVID-19 vaccines 
(any dose) are provided  using  low and  high  background  rates,  respectively,  for calculation  of the 
expected  cases  in  the denominator and  all  observed  cases  with the specified  PT  in  the numerator. 
Sensitivity analyses were  repeated  in  Table  4 and Table  5 using  low and  high  background  rates, 
respectively,  and  only observed  cases  that met the ADEM  Brighton  Collaboration 2  certainty levels  1-3 in 
the numerator. The  O/E  results are  reported  globally overall  for all  ages,  and  then further stratified  by 
age  in  the  US  and  EEA  countries because these  regions  made detailed vaccine  administration data 
publicly available in  a standardised, central  online location. 
The  overall  expected  case  counts of ADEM  were estimated  using  a range  of population  -based  background 
incidence rates from the vACCine  covid-19 monitoring  readinESS  (ACCESS)  project. 3  The  conservative, 
low-range background  rate source  was  Willame C et al  (2023),4  which  presents pooled  age- and  sex 
stratified  results for selected  AESis  according  to the ACCESS  recommendations.  These  rates  represent the 
narrow ACCESS  clinical  definitions and  are for the time  periods  2017-2019.  Sex-stratified  rates  in  the 
supplementary materials of the manuscript were averaged to obtain  the age-specific  rates.  This source 
reported  a pooled  incidence rate for ADEM  of 0.21/100,000 person-years overall.  Sensitivity analyses 
used  higher-range ACCESS  background  rates  reported  by the Foundation for the Promotion  of Health and 
Biomedical  Research  of Valencia  Region  (FISABIO)  database,  which  provided  an  incidence rate of 
0.51/100,000 person-years overall. 5 
The  expected  case counts of ADEM  were estimated  based  on  these  background  incidence  rates, the 
estimated  number of Pfizer-BioNTech  vaccine doses through  15  May  2023,  and  the length of risk 
windows.  COVID-19 vaccine  administrations were  limited to the  Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine  when 
available. 6,7,8  For countries where the  Pfizer-BioNTech  COVID-19 vaccine  is  authorised,  but manufacturer 
stratified  data  were  not available, the doses administered  were assumed  to  be  divided equally by the 
number of brands of vaccines authorised  during that period.  The  estimate of administered  doses  may not 
reflect COVID-19 vaccine doses administered  in  countries that did  not publicly report administration  rates. 
Results 
Based  on  the selected  background  rates and  the estimated  number of exposure PY through  15  May  2023 
after any dose of Pfizer-BioNTech  COVID-19 vaccines,  O/E  ratios  were well  below  1 overall  for all  ages 
combined  globally for both  risk windows of 21- and  42-days using  the  low and  high  background  rates 
(Table  2, Table  3,  Table  4, Table  5).  However,  results varied  by age-groups depending  upon  the 
background  rate and  Brighton  Collaboration  level  of certainty used  to define cases. 
In Table  2,  using  the low background  rate and  all  ADEM  cases,  O/E  ratios were  > 1 for three  age  strata 
(18-24 years,  25-49 years,  and  50-59 years)  in  the 21- day risk window.  Only the result for 25-49 years 
was  statistically significant.  In the 42-day risk window,  only the O/E  ratio for 25-49 years of age was  > 1, 
but this finding  was  not statistically significant.

After including only ADEM  cases  meeting  Brighton  Collaboration  certainty levels  1-3 in  the  numerator, the

All  O/E  ratios were  < 1 using  the high  background  rate and  including  only the cases  meeting  Brighton 
Collaboration  certainty  levels  1-3 in  the numerator (Table  5). 
These  results  suggest that the  number of ADEM  cases  post-vaccination  is  not higher than expected  in  the 
absence  of Pfizer-BioNTech  COVID-19 vaccines  when  using  a range  of background  rates from  pre-2020 
timeframe and  including only cases  meeting  Brighton Collaboration  certainty levels  1-3. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
The O/E  analyses  performed  by  the  MAH  were  based  on  the selected  (ACCESS)  background  rates and  the 
estimated  number of exposure through  15 May  2023. 
The O/E  ratio was  (only) for the age  group 25-49 above  1 and  statistically significant (1.8  [95%CI 
1.4;2.3]) using  a 21-day  risk window and  low-range  background  rate of ADEM,  indicating that there are 
more ADEM  cases  observed  after vaccination  in  persons aged  25-49 years than expected. 
When  the  MAH  used  only the  Brighton  Collaboration  certainty  levels  1-3 of the reported  ADEM  cases  in 
the O/E  analysis in  persons aged  25-49 years,  (the details of assignment of BC  levels  not provided  by the 
MAH)  the O/E  ratio was  1 and  not statistically significant (1.0  [95%CI 0.8;1.4]). 
Limitations 
There are several  limitations to O/E  analyses for signal  detection. The observed  case  counts  are  likely to 
be  underestimated due to the spontaneous reporting  nature with  passive safety surveillance.  Additional 
reasons for underestimations include incomplete reporting  and  lags  in  reporting.  Spontaneous reporting 
systems are  prone to  reporting  bias whereby  events that have  been  previously identified as  potentially 
related  to vaccine are  more  likely to be  reported  even  if they do  not meet the clinical  definition. 
Conversely,  events that have  not been  previously associated  with a vaccine are  more  likely to be 
underreported  due to  lack of recognition  of a  potential  association.  Furthermore,  some observed  cases 
were  missing  age  and/or TTO  information.  Missing  values were  imputed  based  on  the  known  distribution 
of observed  cases  with these characteristics. 
Regarding  the expected  case  counts,  estimates of both exposure to vaccine and  the  background  rate  have 
limitations. The exposure estimate assumes that the number of reported  vaccine administrations is 
complete and  accurate when  in  fact not all  countries administering vaccine  have reported  to the data 
source.  Also,  country-specific dose volume data  are dynamic and  specific to the date of download  from 
the websites,  and  subject to retrospective updates at the country level. 9  The expected  count also 
assumes the  background  rates of the COVID-19 vaccinated  population  in  the absence  of vaccination  is  the 
same as  those  in  the  historical cohort.  The  background  rates  used  in  these analyses are derived from 
studies prior to the COVID-19 era  and  in  individual  countries.  It is  possible that the delivery of healthcare, 
population demographics, and  the  underlying  health status of the populations used  for the  background 
rate estimates differ from those expected  in  the vaccinated  population. 
The  risk windows of ADEM  following  Pfizer-BioNTech  COVID-19 vaccines  are  unclear.  Misspecification  of 
risk window  as  wider than  the true risk window could  potentially  underestimate the  risk estimates.  We 
queried  21- and  42-day risk windows to cover a wide  range  of periods during which  one  is  expected  to be 
at risk of this acute event if there is  a causal  association  between  the event and  vaccination.

Literature review 
A cumulative search  of literature was  conducted  through  14 Nov 2023 to  identify articles describing 
BNT162b2 and the MedDRA  preferred term (PT)  Acute disseminated  encephalomyelitis in  the Medline, 
Biosis and  Embase database.  There were  5 relevant literature articles, and the associated  case  reports 
are summarised  in  the safety database  review section  of this review. 
Sturkenboom  et.  aI 10  conducted  a  retrospective cohort study including subjects from  01  Jan  2020 to  31 
Oct 2021,  in  primary and/or secondary health  care  data from 4  European  countries:  Italy, Netherlands, 
UK,  and  Spain.  The  cohort comprised  25,720,158 subjects who  had  received  first and  second  doses of 
Pfizer,  AstraZeneca,  Moderna  or Janssen  COVID-19 vaccines.  Twenty-nine of the author-identified AESis, 
including  ADEM,  were analysed.  The  incidence of ADEM  was  estimated  as  very rare  with an  incidence of 
1.05 per 100,000 PY,  and  Poisson  regression  did  not show an  association  between ADEM  and  any of the 
vaccine studied,  including  Comirnaty. 
Nabizadeh  et.  al 11  conducted  a comprehensive systematic review of ADEM  following  COVID-19 vaccination 
using  3 databases:  PubMed,  Scopus,  and  Web  of Science.  Studies that reported  the occurrence of ADEM 
after COVID-19 vaccination  were eligible for inclusion  in  the authors' publication  as  were observational 
studies, case  reports,  and  case  series that reported  cases of ADEM  with sufficient detail to confirm  the 
clinical  diagnosis.  A total of 159 studies were  retrieved  from the databases after duplicate  removal. 
Twenty studies with a total of 54  cases  were  included.  Among  included  patients, 45  (85.1  %) developed 
ADEM  after the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine,  and  7 (12.9 %) cases after the second  dose.  The 
median  time  interval  between  vaccination  and  neurological symptoms was  14 days  (range from  12 hours 
to 63  days). Twelve (22.2 %) patients experienced  symptoms of muscle weakness,  10 (18.5 %) had  loss 
of consciousness,  9  (16.6 %) patients had  urinary complaints,  9  (16.6 %) had  visual  impairments, and  5 
(9.2 %) experienced  a seizure.  Four (13.8 %) patients died  and  46 (85.1 %) had  clinical  improvement; 
improvement in  brain  MRI  was  observed  in  44 (81.4 %) patients. The  authors concluded  that it is  not 
clear whether ADEM  could  be  a  potential  complication  of COVID-19 vaccination  based  on  the current 
evidence. 
Kim  et.  al 12  conducted  a disproportionality analyses of CNS  demyelinating disease following  COVID-19 
vaccination  in  the Vigibase compared  with  those cases  for the entire database and  for all  other viral 
vaccines.  The authors identified  220 cases of ADEM.  The  authors found  a weak association  between 
mRNA-based  Covid  vaccines and  ADEM  (IC025=0.78,  ROR025=1.83)  using  a  broad  definition of ADEM 
and  the entire ADR database (including AEs  from  all  vaccine and  all  medications),  however, the  mRNA 
based  Covid  vaccines did  not have a signal  of disproportionality for ADEM  ((IC025=-l.45, ROR025=0.24) 
when  using  a broad  definition  and  the AEs  database for all  other viral  vaccines  (excluding  medication 
related  events and  vaccine other than  viral  vaccines). 
Li  et.  al 13  conducted  a descriptive cohort study in  public healthcare service settings in  Hong  Kong.  This 
study included  around  3.9  million  Hong  Kong  residents,  of which  1,122,793 received  at least 1 dose of 
vaccine  (BNT162b2:  579,998;  CoronaVac:  542,795), and  721,588 completed  2 doses  (BNT162b2: 
388,881;  CoronaVac:  332,707). ADEM  was  1 of 16 pre-specified conditions studied.  Within  28  days 
following  vaccination the cumulative  incidence for ADEM  per 100,000 persons was  O after BNT162b2  Dose 
1 and  0.55 after BNT162b2 dose  2.  The authors concluded  that the age-standardised  incidence rate was 
not significantly higher than  the non-vaccinated  individuals. 
Frontera  et.al 14  utilised  publicly available data from  the US  VAERS  collected  between  01  Jan  2021  and  14 
Jun  2021  to  identify neurological events following  mRNA  or adenovirus vector COVID-19 vaccine

administration. All  free text events that were  reported  within  42 days of COVID-19 vaccine administration 
were  manually reviewed  and  grouped  into  36  individual  neurological diagnostic categories  including 
ADEM.  For the 3 authorised COVID-19 vaccines,  306,907,697 doses were administered during the study 
timeframe. The  authors estimated the number of events of ADEM  per 1,000,000 vaccine doses as  0.06 
for BNT162b2.  The  authors also  conducted  an  observed  versus expected  analysis for BNT162b2  using 
pre-COVID  background  incidence rates of ADEM  in  the  US  which  was  0.97  (95% CI  0.46-1.78),  indicating 
that the observed  incidence of ADEM  was  not higher than  expected. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
Through  14 Nov  2023,  5 relevant articles were  retrieved  by the  MAH: 
1.  The study of Sturkenboom et al. 10  showed  in  4  EU  countries  no  association  between ADEM  and  any of 
the vaccine  studied,  including Comirnaty. 
2.  The  study of Nabizadeh  et al. 11  concluded  in  the executed  systematic review that it is  not clear 
whether ADEM  could  be  a  potential complication  of COVID-19 vaccination. 
3.  The study of Kim  et al. 12  reported  in  Vigibase that the mRNA-based  Covid  vaccines did  not have a 
signal  of disproportionality for ADEM. 
4.  The study of Li  et al. 13  showed  in  Hong  Kong  that for ADEM  the age-standardised  incidence rate in 
vaccinated  persons was  not significantly higher than  the non-vaccinated  persons. 
5.  The  study of Frontera  et al, 14 performed  an  O/E  analysis in  VAERS  and  indicated  that the  observed 
number of ADEM  cases  was  not higher than expected. 
Based  on  the  information from the  retrieved  literature,  no  new important safety information concerning 
ADEM  after Comirnaty exposure could  be  identified. 
Cumulative review of ADEM  cases 
A cumulative  review  of ADEM  cases  within  Pfizer's global  safety database up to the  DLP  of the  PSUR  (18 
Jun  2023) was  performed. The  database was  searched  for all  BNT162b2;  BNT162b2/BNT162b2 OMI  BA.1; 
BNT162b2/BNT162b2 OMI  BA.4-5  and  BNT162b2  OMI  cases  reporting the  MedDRA version  26.0 PT Acute 
disseminated encephalomyelitis  (ADEM).  The  limitations of post-marketing  adverse drug  event reporting 
should  be  considered  when  interpreting these data: 
•  Reports are submitted voluntarily,  and  the magnitude of underreporting  is  unknown.  Some of the 
factors that may influence whether an  event is  reported  include:  length of time since  marketing, 
market share of the drug,  publicity about a drug or an  AE,  seriousness of the reaction,  regulatory 
actions,  awareness  by health  professionals and  consumers of adverse drug event reporting,  and 
litigation. 
•  Because  many external  factors  influence whether or not an  AE  is  reported,  the spontaneous 
reporting  system  yields  reporting  proportions not incidence  rates.  As  a result,  it is  generally not 
appropriate to make between-drug  comparisons  using these  proportions;  the spontaneous 
reporting  system  should  be  used  for signal  detection  rather than  hypothesis testing. 
In some  reports,  clinical  information  (such  as  medical  history, validation  of diagnosis,  time from 
drug  use to onset of illness,  dose,  and  use  of concomitant drugs)  is  missing  or incomplete,  and 
follow-up information  may not be  available. 
• 
•  An  accumulation of AE  reports does  not necessarily indicate that a particular AE  was caused  by 
the drug;  rather,  the event may be  due to an  underlying disease or some other factor(s)  such  as 
past medical  history or concomitant medication.

Rapporteur assessment comment: 
The  limitations of post-marketing AE  reporting  are acknowledged. 
One  hundred  ninety-nine cases  were cumulatively retrieved  out of 1,839,454 total  cases;  all  were  serious 
and  8 were fatal.  The  large  majority of cases  (191) were  reported  for BNT162b2;  7 were  reported  for 
BNT162b2/BNT162b2 OMI  BA.4-5 and  1 was  reported for BNT162b2/BNT162b2 OMI  BA.1.  Fourteen  of 
the reports were from  literature articles and  the  remaining  were spontaneously reported;  none were from 
the  Pfizer/BNT clinical  studies.  Countries reporting  >5 cases  were:  Japan  (84), Germany (35),  UK  (11), 
US  and  France  (10),  Italy (8), and  Austria  (6). The  Brighton  Collaboration  case  definition,  guidelines and 
decision  tree for ADEM  were  used  in  the review of cases  to designate BC  level  of diagnostic certainty 
(Level  1 is  highest level  of diagnostic certainty) for each  of the  199 cases  (see Table  6).

Level  1 is the highest level  of diagnostic certainty and  Level  3 is the  lowest level.  Level  3 cases  lack brain 
MRI  information.  Level  4  cases  are those  in  which  ADEM  is  reported  but insufficient information  is 
provided  to  meet the case  definition.  Level  5 cases  are those that are  not a case  of ADEM  based  on  the 
case  details  provided. 
Per the  BC  decision  tree,  exclusion  criteria  for ADEM  cases are as  follows:  other diagnosis confirmed, 
brain  MRI findings  inconsistent with ADEM,  recurrence or relapse  3 months or longer after symptomatic 
nadir and  proven  acute infectious aetiology. 
It should  be  acknowledged  that BC  criteria  are  most useful  when  applied to clinical  study reports which,  in 
comparison  to spontaneous reports,  generally are of a higher scientific quality and  have a higher 
likelihood  of responses to follow-up  queries. 
The  remaining  review  is  focused  on  the  BC  Level  1 and  2  reports  because they have the  highest level  of 
diagnostic certainty.  For these  reports,  the WHO-UMC  causality assessment system  was  applied  as 
requested.  It should  be  noted  that the  WHO-UMC  system  was designed  for application to AEs  following 
exposure to  medications,  not vaccines.  Dechallenge contributes to the WHO-UMC  causality judgement,  in 
particular for "certain" and "probable/likely" causality assessments.  Due to the nature of vaccines,  the 
concept of dechallenge is  not a criterion that can  be  applied.  This  limits its use  as  a causality tool.  The 
WHO  Causality assessment of an  adverse event following  immunisation 15  notes that causality assessment 
of a case  is  meant to assist in  determining the level  of certainty of such  an  association.  The framework 
states that a case  with  adequate  information  may ultimately be  classified  into  1 of 3 categories: 
consistent causal  association  to  immunisation,  indeterminate,  or inconsistent causal  association  to 
immunisation. 
Additionally,  it is  notable that ADEM  is a rare disorder with an  incompletely understood  pathogenesis and 
no  specific diagnostic tests.  These features are apt to increase the  likelihood  of ADEM  being  attributed to 
vaccination  and  indeed,  historically,  many vaccines  have  had  cases of ADEM  reported  following their 
administration.  However,  a large US  Vaccine  Safety Datalink study in  2016  16failed to show a statistically 
increased  risk of ADEM  in  almost 64 million vaccine doses,  to any vaccine except Tdap  (and  this was 
based  on  2 cases).

Rapporteur assessment comment: 
Through  18 Jun  2023,  199 cases  reporting ADEM  were  retrieved  in  MAH's global  safety database. 
The  majority (n=191, 96%) were  reported  for BNT162b2 original. 
Thirteen cases  (12  patients) were classified  by the  MAH  as  BC  level  1,  78  as  BC  level  2,  26 as  BC  level  3, 
44 as  BC  level 4  and  38  cases  (37  patients)  as  BC  level  5. 
BC  Level  1 reports 
Reports qualify as  Level  1 if they do  not describe specific exclusion  criteria  and  if they  include brain 
histology describing diffuse or multifocal demyelination or if they include even  1 of BC-required  CNS  signs 
and  symptoms,  brain  MRI  with  white matter lesions and  no  recurrences or relapses for 3 months or 
longer after a symptomatic nadir. There are  13  Level  1 cases  describing  12 patients. The  cases  described 
7 female and  5 male patients  13  Level  1 cases  describing  12 patients. The  cases  described  7 female and 
5 male patients,  ranging  in  age  from  25  to 73  years  (mean  44.9);  all  were serious and  none were fatal. 
Time from  vaccination  to onset of the event of interest ranged  from  3 to  132 days (not specified  in  1 
case)  and  outcome was  recovered/recovering/recovered  with  sequelae  in  9,  not recovered  in  1 and 
unknown  in  1 report. 
Table  7  (not reproduced  here)  showed the ADEM  cases  considered  BC  level  1,  including  MAH's  causality 
assessment. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
MAH's causality assessment of the  12 ADEM  patients considered  BC  level  1 is accepted: 
Table 7 ADEM  cases 
BC  level  1.pdf 
In 6 patients  (4 females and  1 male;  3  patients between  25-49 years old  and  3  patients  >49 years old) 
the ADEM  was  considered  possible  related  to Comirnaty exposure,  in  5 patients unlikely related,  and  1 
patient was  unassessable.  However,  detailed  case  descriptions were  not provided  (only case  summaries 
of the  12  patients considered  ADEM  BC  level  1), which  hampers assessor's causality assessment. 
BC  Level  2 reports 
Reports qualify as  Level  2 if they do  not describe the  specific exclusion  criteria  mentioned above and  if 
they describe even  1 of the BC-required  signs/symptoms,  an  MRI  with  white  matter lesions and  <3 
months of follow-up to capture any recurrence or relapse.  Because follow-up for level  2  reports  is  <3 
months following  the  nadir of symptoms, there is  an  uncertainty whether or when  a recurrence  may occur 
(signifying the diagnosis is  not ADEM);  this makes it difficult to assess  a causality  higher than "possible" 
since the diagnostic certainty is  questionable. There are  78  Level  2 cases. 
Thirty-one of the 78  Level  2 reports were assessed  as  having  an  unlikely causality: 
•  Twenty-three of the 31  provided  information supportive of an  alternate explanation  for the 
described  neurological abnormalities (potential ADEM).  These  included  infectious pathogens (eg, 
H.  zoster,  EBV,  non-specific pre-occurring  viral  infection) malignancies (eg,  CNS  malignant 
lymphoma, Chronic  lymphocytic leukemia,  malignancy  requiring  previous whole  brain  radiation 
therapy)  and  medical  histories of other brain  disorders (eg,  multiple sclerosis,  cardioembolic 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment report 
EMA/PRAC/585967 /2023 
Page  138/142 
stroke, venous  malformation,  post-infectious rhombencephalitis,  idiopathic myelitis,  unspecified 
baseline  motor and  sensory aberrations). 
•  Eight of the 31  did  not describe time to onset or provided  a time to onset that was  distal to 
vaccination  (eg,  36 to 75  days). 
Nine of the 78  Level  2  reports were assessed  as  having a conditional  causality.  These  cases  included  a 
competing  diagnosis to ADEM  with  more data  needed for a proper assessment of the diagnosis.  The  most 
common  other diagnoses  noted  were demyelinating  disorders like transverse myelitis and  multiple 
sclerosis. 
Twelve of the 78  Level  2 reports were assessed  as  having an  unassessable causality.  Ten  of them  lacked 
sufficient information about medical  history or the work-up (including  MRI  and  disease course) that they 
could  not be judged. Two  of the  12 cases  described  neurological  events that occurred  after Dose  4  in 
patients who  had  had  an  interchange of different COVID-19 vaccines. 
The  remaining  26 Level  2 cases  are described  in Table 8  (not reproduced  here). The cases  described  15 
female and  11  male patients,  ranging  in  age from  6 to 83  years  (mean  44.8);  all  were serious and  none 
were fatal.  Time from  vaccination to onset of the event of interest ranged  from  1 to 30  days and  outcome 
was  recovered/recovering/recovered  with  sequelae  in  19, not recovered  in  3 and  unknown in  4  reports. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
Of the 78  BC  level  2 ADEM  cases,  31  cases  were considered  unlikely related  to Comirnaty exposure and 
21  cases  unassessable.  However, detailed case  descriptions were  not provided  which  hampers assessor's 
causality  assessment. 
MAH's causality assessment of the 26  remaining  ADEM  patients considered  BC  level  2 is  accepted: 
Table 8 ADEM  cases 
BC  level  2.pdf 
In 24  patients  (14 females  and  10 males;  6  patients  <25 years old,  7  patients between  25-49 years old, 
11  patients  >49 years old)  the ADEM  was  considered  possible  related  to Comirnaty exposure  and  in  2 
patients unlikely related.  However,  detailed case  descriptions were not provided  (only case  summaries of 
the 26 patients considered  ADEM  BC  level  2), which  hampers assessor's causality assessment. 
Routine statistical reports 
To  support routine signal  detection  activities in  addition to the non-statistical  reports, the  MAH  generates 
statistical  reports including  EB05>2. The  EB05>2  report is  a product specific  Bayesian  (Multi-Item 
Gamma  Poisson  Shrinker) computer-generated statistical data  mining report,  which  provides data on 
product or AE  combinations for which  there  is an  emerging  statistic of disproportionate reporting,  using 
an  EB05>2 as  the  metric or threshold  and  using  a subtraction  option  to omit the most previously 
reviewed  events from  subsequent for more in-depth  review. 
On  cumulative  review of the EB05  report for ADEM,  the EB05  scores  were as  follows:

the selected  PT.

Rapporteur assessment comment: 
There was  no  signal for ADEM  following  MAH's  routine signal  detection activities. 
MAH's discussion and conclusion 
The  results of the  updated  O/E analysis suggest that the number of ADEM  cases  post-vaccination  is  not 
higher than expected  in  the absence of Pfizer-BioNTech  COVID-19 vaccines when  using  a range  of 
background  rates from  pre-2020 timeframe and  including  only cases  meeting  Brighton  Collaboration 
certainty levels  1-3. 
The  review of the available  scientific literature showed  that the incidence of ADEM  after vaccination  is 
very rare and  a causal  relationship with  vaccination  with  BNT162b2  is  not supported.  One  study 14 
conducted  an  observed versus expected  analysis for BNT162b2  using  pre-COVID background  incidence 
rates of ADEM  in  the  US  which  was  0.97 (95% CI  0.46-1.78),  indicating that the observed  incidence of 
ADEM  was  not higher than  expected  in  the absence of vaccination  with  BNT162b2. 
The  search  of the safety database  using  the  PT ADEM  revealed  a total of 199 cases  out of >1.8 million 
COVID-19 vaccine AE  reports in  the global safety database.  The  majority were  reported for BNT162b2 
original,  13 cases  (12  individuals) were classified  as  BC  1,  78 as  BC  2,  26  as  BC  3,  44 as  BC  4  and  38 
cases  (37 individuals)  as  BC  5. 
Six cases  of BC  1 and  24 cases  of BC  2 were classified  as  possibly  related,  mainly based  on  timing  after 
immunisation.  Given that ADEM  is  a diagnosis of exclusion,  many cases  assessed  as  possible do  not 
provide full  work-up details that would  allow exclusion  of all  other possible causes  of ADEM  therefore the 
"possibly related" assessments are considered  to  be  quite conservative and  should  be  regarded  in  the 
context of the totality of the data on  ADEM  and  Comirnaty.  No  cases  were  assessed  to  be  probably nor 
certainly related  to vaccination  with  BNT162b2. 
Routine statistical  reports did  not show an  emerging  statistical signal for ADEM. 
The totality of data  reviewed  does  not provide enough  evidence to support the conclusion  of a causal 
relationship  between  vaccination  with  BNT162b2  and the occurrence of ADEM,  therefore the  MAH  does 
not consider any Product Information nor RMP  updates are  necessary,  and  this topic will  continue to  be 
monitored with  routine pharmacovigilance. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
O/E  analyses of ADEM  through  15 May 2023 
The O/E  ratio was  only for the age  group 25-49 above  1 and  statistically significant (1.8  [95%CI 
1.4;2.3]) using  a  21-day risk window and  low-range background  rate of ADEM,  indicating that there are 
more ADEM  cases  in  persons aged  25-49 years observed  after vaccination than expected.  However, when 
using  only the  Brighton  Collaboration  certainty levels  1-3 of the reported  ADEM  cases  in  the O/E analyses, 
the O/E  ratio for the age group 25-49 was  1 and  not statistically significant (1.0  [95%CI 0.8;1.4]). 
Literature through  14  Nov 2023 
No  new important safety information concerning  ADEM  after Comirnaty exposure could  be  identified from 
the  retrieved  5 relevant articles. 
Cumulative review of ADEM  cases  through  18 Jun  2023 
199 cases  reporting ADEM  were  retrieved  in  MAH's global  safety database.  Thirteen  cases  (12  patients) 
were classified  by the MAH  as  BC  level  1, 78  as  BC  level  2,  26  as  BC  level  3,  44 as  BC  level  4 and  38 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment report 
EMA/PRAC/585967 /2023 
Page  140/142 
cases  (37 patients) as  BC  level  5. 
Causality assessment was  performed  by the MAH  for the ADEM  cases  considered  BC  level  1 (12  patients) 
or BC  level  2 (78 patients): 
BC Level 1  reports  - in  6  patients (of which  3 patients 25-49 years old)  the ADEM  was  considered 
possible  related  to Comirnaty exposure,  in  5 patients unlikely related,  and  1 patient was  unassessable. 
BC Level 2  reports  - in  24  patients (of which  7  patients 25-49 years old)  the ADEM  was considered 
possibly  related  to Comirnaty exposure,  in  33  patients unlikely related,  and  in  21  patients was 
unassessable. 
Routine signal  detection 
There was  no  signal for ADEM  following  MAH's  routine signal  detection activities. 
In conclusion,  based  on  the data  provided  by the  MAH  there is  no  evidence for a causal  relationship 
between  Comirnaty exposure  and  ADEM.  Cases  reporting  ADEM  should  continue to be  monitored with 
routine pharmacovigilance.

COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (nucleoside modified) 
Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 5 
Reporting Period 
19 December 2022 through 18 June 2023 
•  Tris/Sucrose BA.4/BA.5 (5/5 micrograms/dose)- for age 5 years to <12 years 
[Dark blue cap];8 
•  Tris/Sucrose BA.4/BA.5 (5/5 micrograms/dose)- for age 5 years to <12 years 
[Light blue cap];9 
•  Tris/Sucrose BA.4/BA.5 (1.5/1.5 micrograms/dose)- for age 6 months to <5 
years [Maroon cap] .10 
The active substance of each of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine presentations is a highly 
purified single-stranded, 5'-capped mRNA produced using a cell-free in vitro transcription 
from the corresponding DNA template, encoding the viral spike (S) protein of severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Original). 
The nucleoside-modified mRNA in Original BNT162b2 and Bivalent BNT162b2 is 
formulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), which enable delivery of the RNA into host cells to 
allow expression of the SARS-CoV-2 S antigen.  The vaccine elicits both neutralising 
antibody and cellular immune responses to the spike (S) antigen, which may contribute to 
protection against COVID-19. 
CO MIRNA TY® is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 disease caused 
by SARS-CoV-2 virus, in individuals 6 months of age and older. 
8 Multi-dose cap vials, first approved in EU after DLP on 22 June 2023.

BNT162b2 original/ BNT162b2 Omi BA.2 [104], and BNT162b2 original/ BNT162b2 
Omi BA.4/BA.5  [2965]); 
•  633 participants exposed to other early development candidates (including BNT162al 
[30], BNT162bl  [411], BNT162b3 and BNT162c2 [96 participants each]). 
There were 2 participants exposed to blinded therapy, 6352 to placebo, and 7 to seasonal 
inactivated influenza vaccine (SIIV)/placebo. 
BNT162b2 is also being utilised in 3 other Pfizer clinical development programs: 372 
participants received BNT162b2 as a study vaccine in the clinical study B747102612
participants received BNT162b2 Bivalent (BNT162b2 original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) as a study 
vaccine in the clinical study C5261001 13  and 757 participants received BNT162b2 Bivalent 
(BNT 162b2 original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) as a study vaccine in the clinical study C5481001. 14 
,  796 
From the receipt of the first temporary authorisation for emergency supply on 
01  December 202015  through 18 June 2023, approximately 4,615,732,025 doses of 
BNT162b2 (original and bivalent) were shipped from BioNTech and Pfizer worldwide. 
Considering the current status of the vaccination schedule and the availability of only partial 
data published on the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) websites 
for doses ofBNT162b2 vaccines (original and bivalent) administered in the EU- European 
economic area (EEA) countries, it is no longer applicable to estimate the number of doses 
administered from those shipped.  Out of the cumulative number of shipped doses, 
11  Participants to more than one clinical trial (e.g., extension study) are counted once when receiving the 
same treatment in the parent study. 
12  A phase 3, randomized, double blind trial to describe the safety and immunogenicity of 20 valent 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine when co-administered with a booster dose ofBNT162b2 in adults 65 years of 
age and older.

COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (nucleoside modified) 
Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 5 
Reporting Period 
19 December 2022 through 18 June 2023 
In addition, World Health Organization (WHO) had approved the Emergency Use Listing 
(EUL) ofBNT162b2. 
There were no marketing authorisation withdrawals for safety reasons during the reporting 
interval. 
The reference safety information (RSI) for this PSUR is the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine Core 
Data Sheet (CDS) version 21.0 dated 25 May 2023, in effect at the end of the reporting 
period. Three (3) previous CDS versions (version 20.0 dated 22 February 2023, version 19.0 
dated 22 December 2022 and version 18.0 dated 05 December 2022) were also in effect 
during the reporting period. No safety-related changes were made to CDS version 20.0. 
Safety-related changes included updates of the following Sections: 4.2. Posology and method 
of administration (CDS version 21.0), 4.8. Undesirable effects (CDS versions 21.0 and 19.0), 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties (CDS version 19.0), Appendix A and Appendix B (CDS 
versions 21.0 and 19.0). 
During the reporting period, the following signals were evaluated: 
Signals determined not to be risks: Myositis, Pemphigus and Pemphigoid. 
Ongoing signals:  Sensorineural Hearing Loss, Retinal Vascular Occlusion, and Menstrual 
Irregularities. 
During the reporting period, one action was taken with respect to BNT 162b2 for safety 
reasons. In Switzerland the approval for bivalent Omi BA. I was not obtained for individuals 
12 to less than 18 years because there was no clinical data available for that population . 
Because country-specific packaging was not available, Switzerland received EU packaging 
that displayed age on the carton as  12+ (as per EU MA).  Therefore, an information Letter (in 
English) explaining the discrepancy between age on the carton and age approved by 
Swissmedic was provided with each shipment.  In addition, the MAH provided electronic 
versions of the letter in German, French and Italian to the Federal Office of Public Health. 
Requests addressed in this PSUR were received from the European Medicines Agency 
(EMA), WHO, and 3 Health Authorities (HA) (Health Canada, Medsafe [New Zealand 
Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Authority], and Therapeutic Goods Administration, 
Australia [TOA]).  The Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) requests 
were received in Assessment Reports (ARs) of PSUR #4 and of signals.  The WHO requests 
were received in the EUL Procedure.  Topics covered in these requests are summarised in the 
table below.

Re  uest(s) 
The signal of Pemphigus and Pemphigoid (EMENH/C/005735/SDN061 - EPITT 
19859) is closed and in the next PSUR, the MAH should perform a review of all 
new emerging data (which were not assessed in the current signal procedure) on 
pemphigus and pemphigoid (separately) after exposure to the vaccine, including 
data from clinical trials, post-marketing exposure and new scientific literature. The 
MAH should perform the assessment of causality, an observed versus expected 
O/E  anal  sis and  rovide all case narratives within this review. 
MAH will continue closely monitor Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) / 
autoimmune myositis, and IIM flares through routine pharmacovigilance, 
including (but not restricted to) any relevant new cases and scientific literature on 
possible pathogenic mechanisms, as appropriate. 
In addition, the MAH will explore the feasibility ofusing healthcare data from 
prior to and during the COVID-19 era to better understand the occurrence of 
myositis in a broad population. Specifically, the MAH is expected to increase their 
efforts, and provide proposals to obtain more recent/contemporaneous IIM 
back  ound incidence rates, i.e. durin  the  andernic/immunisation cam  ai  ns. 
Pre  nanc  outcome in clinical trials. 
Provide the cumulative review for post-market cases, with a focus on reports 
following bivalent vaccination. An updated review of any new literature ( e.g., 
prospective cohort studies) on the risk of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) 
followin  monovalent and/or bivalent Comirna  COVID-19 vaccination. 
Presentation and discussion of interim reports of the studies C4591010, C4591021 
and C4591022. 
Adverse events re  orted in <5- ear-old should bes  lit b  dose 1, 2 and 3.

According to the European Union Risk Management Plan (EU-RMP) version 9.0 dated 
04 November 2022 (EMEA/H/C/005735//11/0147) approved on 10 November 2022, in effect 
at the beginning of the reporting period, safety concerns for BNT162b2 are: 
• 
• 
Important identified risk: Myocarditis and Pericarditis. 
Important potential risk: Vaccine-associated enhanced disease (V AED) including 
Vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (V AERD). 20 
•  Missing information: Use in pregnancy and while breast feeding; Use in 
immunocompromised patients; Use in frail patients with co-morbidities (e.g., chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], diabetes, chronic neurological disease, 
20 The important potential risk of V AEDN AERO was removed from the list of safety concerns in RMP 
version 10.0 (procedures EMENH/C/005735/X/0176, EMENH/C/005735/11/0177, and 
EMENH/C/005735/X/0180). Additionally, the Rapporteur agreed to remove the important potential risk of 
V AEDN AERO from the list of safety concerns for the PSUR #5 reporting period [ as per PSUR #4 PRAC AR 
(EMENH/C/PSUSN00010898/202212)] .

Interaction with other vaccines; Long term safety data. 
No new safety concerns were identified during the reporting period. 
After the DLP, 
• 
an updated CDS (version 22.0) was made effective on 24 July 2023; this updated version 
includes the addition of vaccine presentations anticipated for the 2023-2024 new variant 
(Omicron XBB.1.5), several sections of the CDS have been reformatted to simplify and 
consolidate the existing information where possible to remove redundancy and repetition. 
No new information related to the indication, dosing, safety or efficacy/immunogenicity 
has been added or revised as a result of the consolidation or formatting changes. 
•  Signals: 
A new signal (Mastitis/Breast swelling) was opened based upon an enquiry from the 
Australian regulatory authority (TGA). The signal is ongoing. 
The ongoing signals (Menstrual irregularities and Sensorineural Hearing Loss) were 
closed as no risk on 26 July 2023 and on 19 July 2023, respectively. 
•  The EU-RMP versions (with version number agreed with EMA) and associated

Reporting Period 
19 December 2022 through 18 June 2023 
Risks have been evaluated in the context of the benefits of the vaccine.  Based on the 
available safety and efficacy/effectiveness data from the reporting interval for BNT162b2 
original and bivalent vaccines (Omi BA.1  and Omi BA.4/BA.5), the overall benefit-risk 
profile ofBNT162b2 remains favourable.  No further changes to the BNT162b2 RSI or 
additional risk minimisation measures are warranted in addition to those above mentioned.

COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (nucleoside modified) 
Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 5 
Reporting Period 
19 December 2022 through 18 June 2023 
1. INTRODUCTION 
This is the 5th PSUR for the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (nucleoside modified), 
COMIRNATY®, also referred to as BNT162b2,4 covering the reporting interval 
19 December 2022 through 18 June 2023. 
The format and content of this PSUR is in accordance with the Guideline on GVP Module 
VII-Periodic safety update report (EMA/816292/2011  [December 2013]), with ICH 
Guideline E2C (R2) Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report [Step 5, January 2013]),21  and 
Consideration on core requirements for RMPs of COVID-19 vaccines - coreRMP19 
guidance v.  3.1  (EMA/PRAC/73244/2022 [01  September 2022]). 
BNT162b2 is highly purified single-stranded, 5'-capped mRNA produced using a cell-free 
in vitro transcription from the corresponding DNA templates, encoding the viral S protein of 
SARS-Co V-2.  The nucleoside-modified mRNA is formulated in LNPs, which enable 
delivery of the RNA into host cells to allow expression of the SARS-Co V-2  S antigen.  The 
vaccine elicits both neutralising antibody and cellular immune responses to the S antigen, 
which may contribute to protection against COVID-19. 
Indication: Active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-Co V-2 virus in 
individuals 6 months of age and older.  It is administered intramuscularly. 
Please refer to the table below for formulations, presentations and posology in the approved 
populations. 
21  The corePSUR19 guidance, was discontinued on 30 March 2023 .

according to the Safety Data Exchange Agreement(s) in place.  Data from respective 
contractual party(s) are included in the report when applicable. 
2. WORLDWIDE MARKETING APPROVAL STATUS 
BNT162b2 received first temporary authorisation for emergency supply under Regulation 
174 in the UK22  on 01  December 2020. 
BNT 162b2 received first regulatory conditional marketing authorisation approval for use in 
individuals  16 years and older in Switzerland on 19 December 2020.  In the European Union, 
conditional marketing authorisation was granted on 21  December 2020; this was switched to 
a standard marketing authorisation on 10 October 2022. Overall, BNT162b2 original 
received marketing authorisation approval in 104 countries/regions. 
In 2022, to address the emergence of Omicron variants, bivalent formulations were 
developed. Bivalent BNT 162b2 ( original/Omicron BA. I) and bivalent BNT 162b2 
( original/Omicron BA.4/BA.5) received marketing authorisation approval in 46 and 73 
countries/regions, respectively. The MAHs and the number of countries where the different 
MAHs hold the authorisation are presented in Table 2. 
The approved indication is for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by 
SARS-CoV-2. Of note, on 18 April 2023, US FDA has simplified the vaccination schedule 
for most individuals, and granted EUA for BNT162b2 original/Omicron BA.4/BA.5 to be 
used for all doses administered to individuals 6 months of age and older. The approved 
indication in terms of age limits and the recommended posology may vary in countries where 
COVID-19 vaccine is available. 
Different dosages are available for use in different age groups. 
22  On 01  January 2021, conditional marketing authorisation approval was also granted in the UK and the 
approval is currently active .

COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (nucleoside modified) 
Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 5 
Reporting Period 
19 December 2022 through 18 June 2023 
In addition, WHO had approved the EUL ofBNT162b2. 
There were no marketing authorisation withdrawals for safety reasons during the reporting 
interval. 
3. ACTIONS TAKEN IN THE REPORTING INTERVAL FOR SAFETY REASONS 
During the reporting period, the following action was taken with respect to BNT 162b2 for 
safety reasons. In Switzerland the approval for bivalent Omi BA. I was not obtained for 
individuals 12 to less than 18 years because there was no clinical data available for that 
population.  Because country-specific packaging was not available, Switzerland received EU 
packaging that displayed age on the carton as  12+ (as per EU MA).  Therefore, an 
information Letter (in English) explaining the discrepancy between age on the carton and age 
approved by Swissmedic was provided with each shipment.  In addition, the MAH provided 
electronic versions of the letter in German, French and Italian to the Federal Office of Public 
Health. 
4. CHANGES TO REFERENCE SAFETY INFORMATION 
The RSI for this PSUR is the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine CDS version 21.0 dated 
25 May 2023, in effect at the end of the reporting period and included in Appendix 1. 
Three (3) previous CDS versions (version 20.0 dated 22 February 2023, version 19.0 dated 
22 December 2022 and version 18.0 dated 05 December 2022) in effect during the reporting 
period, are included in Appendix 1.2, Appendix 1.3  and Appendix 1 .4, respectively. No 
safety-related changes were made to CDS version 20.0. 
Safety-related changes (presented in Appendix 1.1) included updates of the following 
sections: 
•  4.2. Posology and method of administration (CDS version 21.0), to include Bivalent 
(Original/Omicron BA.4/BA.5) presentation, 15/15 micrograms/dose (grey cap) as 
primary series and booster for ages 6 months and above and to update dosing interval. 
•  4.8. Undesirable effects (CDS versions 21.0 and 19.0), to include updated median follow 
up time values and safety profiles for the age groups (12 and older, 5 through< 12 years, 
2 to 4 years, 6 months through 23 months of age) after Bivalent use in clinical setting. 
Diarrhoea was added as adverse reaction(> 10%) in Children 5 through <12 years of age 
- after 2 doses. 
•  5.1  1 Pharmacodynamic properties (CDS version 19.0) to include efficacy information in 
participants 6 months through 4 years of age - after 3 doses. 
•  Appendix A and Appendix B (CDS versions 21.0 and 19.0) to include frequencies and 
frequency categories (Very Common, Common, Uncommon or Rare) for some AD Rs in 
different age groups.

COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (nucleoside modified) 
Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 5 
Reporting Period 
19 December 2022 through 18 June 2023 
After the DLP, an updated CDS (version 22.0) was made effective on 24 July 2023. This 
updated version includes the addition of vaccine presentations anticipated for the 2023-2024 
new variant (Omicron XBB.1.5); several sections of the CDS have been reformatted to 
simplify and consolidate the existing information where possible to remove redundancy and 
repetition. No new information related to the indication, dosing, safety or 
efficacy/immunogenicity has been added or revised as a result of the consolidation or 
formatting changes. 
5. ESTIMATED EXPOSURE AND USE PATTERNS 
In the PRAC AR of the PSUR #4 (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010898/202212), the following 
request was made:  The MAH should continue to report on the administered 1st,  2nd,  3rd,  4th,

MAH Data 
The number of doses cumulatively administered ( as per public available data for the 
EU-EEA countries,26 the US,27  and Japan28
on a bi-weekly base.  Considering the current status of the vaccination schedule and the 
availability of only partial data published on the ECDC websites for doses ofBNT162b2 
vaccines (original and bivalent) administered in the EU-EEA countries,29  it is no longer 
applicable to estimate the number of doses administered from those shipped.  Estimated 
administered doses were provided separately, as available on the public source data. 
)  is either no longer updated or currently updated 
Approximately a total of 4,615,732,02530  doses ofBNT162b2 (original and bivalent) were 
shipped worldwide from the receipt of the first temporary authorisation for emergency supply 
on 01  December 2020 through 18 June 2023.  The worldwide estimated cumulative number 
of shipped doses by vaccine presentation, region and countries and by age group based on 
data provided in the shipment tracker (Order Book)31  through 18 June 2023  is showed in

Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 5 
Reporting Period 
19 December 2022 through 18 June 2023 
6. DATA IN SUMMARY TABULATIONS 
6.1. Reference Information 
The MedDRA version 26.0 has been used to code adverse events/reactions in summary 
tabulations. 
6.2. Cumulative Summary Tabulations of Serious Adverse Events from Clinical Trials 
Appendix 2.1  provides a cumulative summary tabulation, from the MAH' s safety database, 
of SAEs reported in Pfizer clinical trial cases received by the MAH. This appendix is 
organised according to MedDRA SOC. This appendix includes SAEs originated from the 
following studies: BNT162-1733
C4591020, C4591024, C4591030, C4591031, C4591044 and C4591048. 
,  C4591001, C4591005, C4591007, C4591015, C4591017, 
Appendix 2.1.1  provides a cumulative summary tabulation, from the MAH's safety database, 
of SAEs reported in BioNTech and Fosun clinical trial cases. This appendix includes SAEs 
originated from the following studies: BNT162-0l, BNT162-03, BNT162-04, BNT162-06, 
BNT162-14, and BNT162-21. 
6.3. Cumulative and Interval Summary Tabulations from Post-Marketing Data Sources 
In the Medsafe assessment of the Comimaty EU-RMP version 8 the following request was 
made: It is acknowledged that the clinical studies (C4591031  Substudy E and D) were 
conducted outside of New Zealand.  Therefore,  the race and ethnicity datasets do not provide 
information on all the ethnicities relevant to New Zealand.  The sponsor should commit to 
present data,  where available,  information on race and ethnicity,  including Maori and 
Pacific peoples in the PSURs and SSRs that are submitted to Medsafe . 
Response 
The Appendix 2.2.6 displays, for the PM dataset, demographic interval data including 
ethnicity and race, when available. 
Appendix 2.2 provides the overall (including original and bivalent vaccines) cumulative and 
interval summary tabulation of adverse drug reactions by PT from post-marketing sources. 
Appendix 2.2.1  through Appendix 2.2.4 provide cumulative and interval summary tabulation 
of adverse drug reactions by PT from post-marketing sources by vaccine type [BNTl 62b2 
original and BNT162b2 bivalent (Omi BA.I, Omi BA.4/BA.5, Omi)]. These tabulations 
include serious and non-serious reactions from spontaneous sources, as well as serious 
adverse reactions from non-interventional studies and other non-interventional solicited 
33  Thirty-eight (38) clinical trial cases from BioNTech protocol BNT162-l 7 were entered in the global 
safety database as Pfizer sponsored study to allow appropriate reporting to the US FDA as IND Application 
safety reports, since Pfizer assumed responsibility of this reporting on sponsor's behalf.  As such, the 
cumulative summaries of all SAEs from Pfizer sponsored trials in Appendix 2.1  and cumulative summaries of 
SAEs in Appendix 2.1.1  have been updated to reflect the more appropriate categorisation.  No data was lost 
from previous reports .

Reporting Period

sources. The cumulative data include all data up to  18 June 2023 and the interval data are 
from  19 December 2022 to  18 June 2023. This appendix is organised according to SOC and 
presents data for spontaneous cases (including regulatory authority and literature cases) 
separately from non-interventional sources. 
Please note that adverse event totals presented for safety topic evaluations in Section 16 
Signal and Risk Evaluation, may differ from Appendix 2.2 through Appendix 2.2.4 totals, 
due to the fact that Appendix 2.2 only displays the number of serious reactions from 
non-interventional studies and solicited sources as  described above, whereas the safety topic 
evaluation includes all reported events. Cases from non-interventional studies and other non 
interventional solicited sources must contain at least 1 serious related event to meet PSUR 
inclusion criteria and may also contain additional events that are considered unrelated, all of 
which would be evaluated. 
The cumulative Summary tabulations (Appendix 2.2 through Appendix 2.2.4) and the data 
related to the current reporting period and included in the body of the PSUR, do not include 
(due to a technical issue) a set of 575 cases (all received in the current reporting period) 
reporting as only suspect BNT162b2 Multivalent NOS. A separate cumulative(= interval) 
Summary tabulation for these 575 cases is provided as Appendix 2.2.5. 
Upon review of these 575 cases, there were 6 fatal cases, 31  cases reporting Drug ineffective, 
3 cases of maternal exposure during pregnancy, 6 cases of myocarditis and pericarditis34 
(none of which with a fatal outcome),  1 case ofMIS-C/A (SIRS), 8 cases involving 
paediatric subjects, and 104 cases indicative of other AESis. Upon review, the safety profile 
of this subset of cases did not differ from the safety profile of the overall population; all these 
cases will be included in the next PSUR. 
Appendix 2.2.6 displays, for the PM dataset, demographic interval data, including ethnicity 
and race when available. 
7.  SUMMARIES OF SIGNIFICANT SAFETY FINDINGS FROM CLINICAL 
TRIALS DURING THE REPORTING INTERVAL 
Table 23  below summarizes the study treatments in the clinical studies by original vaccine or

Reporting Period 
19 December 2022 through 18 June 2023 
Table 24.  Summary of Results from Clinical Trials Completed During the 
Reporting Period - Remaining Trials 
Protocol ID 
BNT162-01 
Protocol Title 
A multi-site, phase I/II, 2-Part, dose-
escalation trial investigating the safety 
and immunogenicity of four 
prophylactic SARS-CoV-2 RNA 
vaccines against COVID-19 using 
different dosing regimens in healthy 
and immunocompromised adults. 
Conclusions 
Based on the totality of the safety data, BNT162bl 
and BNTl 62b2 were generally well tolerated and 
had acceptable safety profiles in healthy 
participants and BNT 162b2 was generally well 
tolerated and had an acceptable safety profile in IC 
participants, at the dose levels tested. For 
BNT162bl, twice dosing at 60 µg was not 
considered acceptable due to dose-related 
increases in reactogenicity. 
Participants dosed with BNT162bl  and 
BNTl 62b2 showed a strong, dose-dependent 
functional antibody response which was 
independent of age. The induced immune response 
was found to be multi-epitopic by BNTl 62b2. 
The more favourable tolerability profile of 
BNTl 62b2 was the main driver for choosing 
dosing with two doses of 30 µg  BNTl 62b2 for 
further study in the Phase II/III evaluation of 
efficacy. 
7 .2. Ongoing Clinical Trials 
During the reporting period, there were 12 ongoing35  sponsor-initiated clinical trials. 
1)  Safety Trials (see Appendix 4.2 for a list of ongoing interventional safety studies) 
There were 3 ongoing clinical trials. 
a)  PASS: 
►  Original Vaccine 
♦  C4591015: A phase 2/3, placebo-controlled, randomized,  observer-blind study to 
evaluate the safety,  tolerability,  and immunogenicity of a SARS-Co V-2 RNA 
vaccine candidate (BNTJ 62b2) against COVID-19 in healthy pregnant women 18 
years of age and older is an ongoing PASS. No clinically important new 
information has emerged from this ongoing PASS. 
♦  C459102436
: A phase 2b,  open-label study to evaluate the safety,  tolerability,  and 
immunogenicity of vaccine candidate BNT162b2 in immunocompromised 
35  Includes ongoing studies as well as  studies in which participant enrollment and follow-up have been 
completed, but the analysis and CSR are in-progress . 
36  On 10 November 2022 in the final Assessment report for PAM-MEA-016.4, the CHMP granted 
permission to cease enrollment in Study C4591024 due to the futility reasons. The study started to recruit 
participants in October 2021, when all countries provided vaccine against COVID-19 after the authorization at 
first to the most vulnerable population, which includes the immunocompromised individuals, making difficult

Study C4591031  consists of 6 substudies.  Substudies A and B (both with 
original) were completed37  and provided clinically important emerging efficacy 
and safety findings, while for the remaining 4 ongoing substudies (C  [ original] 
and D through F [bivalent vaccine]) no clinically significant safety and/or 
efficacy information has emerged. 
Study C4591031  Substudy A was a Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, 
observer-blind substudy aimed at evaluating the safety, tolerability, and efficacy 
of a booster dose ofBNT162b2. Participants ~16 years of age who had 
completed a 2-dose primary series ofBNT162b2 in Study C4591001  at least 6 
months prior to randomization, were enrolled and randomized at a ratio of 1: 1 to 
receive either BNT162b2 or placebo. Randomization was stratified by age, such 
that approximately 60% of participants enrolled were ~16 through 55 years of 
age and approximately 40% of participants >55 years of age. Considering the 
observation of waning effectiveness and recommendation for booster doses in 
some countries, per the protocol, participants could be unblinded from 24 
September 2021  onwards and those randomized to placebo were offered a dose of 
BNT162b2 30 µg. 
Conclusions from the final study report for Substudy A: 
•  The cumulative incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases showed that 
BNT162b2 30 µg provided strong protection against the Delta variant of 
SARS-CoV-2, with waning efficacy following the rise of the Omicron 
variant. Severe COVID-19 cases remained rare in the study population, 
despite increasing cases overall. 
•  The tolerability and safety profile ofBNT162b2 30 µgin participants ~16 
years of age at up to  12 months after booster vaccination was acceptable and 
consistent with results previously reported from the clinical trial experience 
with BNT 162b2 2-dose primary vaccination. 
Substudy B of C4591031  was a randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind, 
crossover substudy to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a booster (third or 
fourth) dose of BNT162b2.  Participants ~12 years of age to :'.530 years of age that 
received 2 or 3 prior doses ofBNT162b2 (30-µg doses), with their last dose at 
least 4 months (120 days) prior to randomization, were enrolled.  Participants 
were randomized at a ratio of 1: 1 to receive either BNT 162b2 or placebo at their 
first vaccination visit and then crossed over to the alternative, four weeks later 
and were stratified by age (stratified as  12-17, 18-24, and 25-30 years of 
age).  Serum samples were tested for troponin before each administration of 
blinded study intervention, 2 to 5 days after each administration, and 1 month 
after the second administration.  The percentages of participants with elevated 
serum troponin I levels in participants aged 12 to 30 years who had received 2 or 
37  Final CSRs were issued for Substudy A (27 February 2023) and Substudy B (24 May 2023) of Study 
C4591031  during the reporting interval.

Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 5 
Reporting Period 
19 December 2022 through 18 June 2023 
3 prior doses ofBNT162b2 (30-µg doses) showed no significant difference 
between BNT162b2 30 µg  and placebo. 
•  A total of 9 and 7 participants (0.7% and 0.5%) had elevated troponin I 
results at the  I-month visit (28-35 days) after BNTl 62b2 and placebo 
vaccination, respectively. 
•  The percentages of elevated troponin I results were similar between the two 
vaccine groups (after BNT162b2 or after placebo) across age group, sex, 
race, and ethnicity subgroups. In both vaccine groups, the percentages of 
elevated troponin I results were generally higher in younger age groups (12-
1 7 years) and males. 
•  At the 4-day visit (2-5 days) after BNT162b2 or placebo, the difference in 
percentage of elevated troponin I results between the 2 groups was -0.5% 
(95% CI:  -1.1 %, 0.2% ), which was not statistically significant. Similarly,  1 
month (28-35 days) after BNTl 62b2 or placebo, the difference of 0.2% 
(95% CI:  -0.3%, 0.7%) in the elevated troponin I results between the 2 
groups was also not statistically significant.

practice guide on recording, coding, reporting and assessment of medication errors" 
(EMA/762563/2014) were described: 
•  Medication errors associated with harm [i.e., resulting in adverse reaction(s)]: 360 cases 
(3.2%) compared to 1670 cases (2.9%) in the PSUR #4. 
•  Medication errors without harm [i.e., not resulting in adverse reaction(s)]:  10,995 cases 
(96.8%) compared to 55,167 (97.0%) in the PSUR #4. 
•  Potential medication errors: 6 cases (0.1 %) compared to 39 cases (0.1 %) in the PSUR #4. 
• 
Intercepted medication errors:  1 case (0.001 %) compared to 3 cases (0.01 %) in the 
PSUR#4. 
Of note, some cases involved more than one medication error.

Overall, among the 11,362 relevant medication error PM cases, 360 cases (0.5% of the total 
interval cases, 3.2% of total relevant medication error cases) were considered harmful 
because they were accompanied by clinically relevant co-reported events. 
The potential for medication errors with all vaccine presentations are mitigated through the 
information in the vaccine labelling and available educational materials for the HCPs 
administering the vaccine. 
Some medication errors are expected to occur despite written instructions for handling the 
vaccine and educational activities for the HCPs or due to national or regional 
recommendations regarding dosing schedules that may differ from recommendations in the 
product labelling. The number and seriousness of the reported medication errors events do 
not indicate there is the need for any additional mitigation activity to prevent harm.

11. LITERATURE 
In the AR of the 13th SMSR / 2nd  SBSR (EMA/PRAC/202255/2022), the following request 
was made: The MAH is requested in future  SSRs and PSURs to present all relevant literature 
concerning the safety of Comimaty ( also besides the database Medline and Embase) that is 
published during the reporting period. 
Response 
Please refer to the content of this Section. 
Nonclinical (Published) 
A search of the Medline and Embase databases identified no nonclinical studies that 
presented important new safety findings for BNT162b2. 
Clinical (Published) 
A search of the Medline and Embase databases identified no clinical trials that presented 
important new safety findings for BNT162b2. 
However, during the current reporting period, the literature article "Safety monitoring of 
bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccine booster doses among children aged 5-11  years - United 
States, October 12-January 1, 2023" (Hause et al.) reported important safety information 
about the use of bivalent vaccines and young children. 
Hause et al state that no reports of myocarditis were recorded in V AERS by O 1 January 2023 
for the 861,251  children aged 5-11  years, who received a bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech booster 
in the US in the same period.

United States, October 12-
January 1, 2023 
On October 12, 2022, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued 
Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for bivalent (mRNA encoding the 
spike protein from the SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strain and BA.4/BA.5 Omicron 
variants) formulations of Pfizer-BioNTech and Modema mRNA COVID-19 
vaccines for use as  a single booster dose ~2 months after completion of 
primary series or monovalent booster vaccination for children aged 5-11 
years (Pfizer-BioNTech) and 6-17 years (Modema); on December 8, 2022, 
FDA amended the EUAs to include children aged ~6 months. The Advisory 
Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that all persons 
aged ~6 months receive an age-appropriate bivalent mRNA booster dose. The 
safety of bivalent mRNA booster doses among persons aged ~12 years has 
previously been described. To characterize the safety of bivalent mRNA 
booster doses among children aged 5-11  years after receipt of bivalent Pfizer-
BioNTech and Modema booster doses, CDC reviewed adverse events and

Abstract 
health impacts reported to v-safe, a voluntary, smartphone-based U.S. safety 
surveillance system established by CDC to monitor adverse events after 
COVID-19 vaccination, and to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System 
(V AERS), a U.S. passive vaccine safety surveillance system co-managed by 
CDC and FDA. During October 12-January 1, 2023, a total of 861,251 
children aged 5-11  years received a bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech booster, and 
92,108 children aged 6-11  years received a bivalent Moderna booster. Among 
3,259 children aged 5-11  years registered in v-safe who received a bivalent 
booster dose, local (68.7%) and systemic reactions (49.5%) were commonly 
reported in the week after vaccination. Approximately 99.8% ofreports to 
V AERS for children aged 5-11  years after bivalent booster vaccination were 
nonserious. There were no reports of myocarditis or death after bivalent 
booster vaccination. Eighty-four percent ofVAERS reports were related to 
vaccination errors, 90.5% of which did not list an adverse health event. Local 
and systemic reactions reported after receipt of a bivalent booster dose are 
consistent with those reported after a monovalent booster dose; serious 
adverse events are rare. Vaccine providers should provide this information 
when counseling parents or guardians about bivalent booster vaccination. 
Preliminary safety findings from the first  11  weeks of bivalent booster 
vaccination among children aged 5-11  years are reassuring.  Compared with 
the low risk of serious health effects after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, the 
health effects ofSARS-CoV-2 infection include death and serious long-term 
sequalae. ACIP recommends that all persons aged ~ 6 months receive an age-
appropriate bivalent mRNA booster dose ~2 months after completion of a 
COVID-19 primary series or receipt of a monovalent booster dose. 
All Other Published Sources 
A search of the Medline and Embase databases identified no new information that presented 
important new safety findings for BNT162b2 . 
Unpublished manuscripts 
During the reporting period, no new information that presented important new safety findings 
were identified.

After the DLP, 
•  An updated CDS (version 22.0) was made effective on 24 July 2023; this updated version 
includes the addition of vaccine presentations anticipated for the 2023-2024 new variant 
(Omicron XBB.1.5), several sections of the CDS have been reformatted to simplify and 
consolidate the existing information where possible to remove redundancy and repetition. 
No new information related to the indication, dosing, safety or efficacy/immunogenicity 
has been added or revised as a result of the consolidation or formatting changes. 
•  Signals: 
o  A new signal (Mastitis/Breast swelling) was opened based upon an enquiry from 
the Australian regulatory authority (TGA). The signal is ongoing . 
o  The ongoing signals (Menstrual irregularities and Sensorineural Hearing Loss) 
were closed as no risk on 26 July 2023  and on 19 July 2023, respectively. 
•  The CHMP approved on 22 June 2023, the EU-RMP versions 9.1  through 9.5, up 
versioned to version 10.0 of the EURMP in the context of the procedures

COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (nucleoside modified) 
Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 5 
Reporting Period 
19 December 2022 through 18 June 2023 
There were no safety signals related to product quality defects or issues identified during 
product complaint investigations. 
Overall, the most frequently (2::  65  occurrences) reported product issues regardless of lot 
number included the following PTs: Product temperature excursion issue (1058), Product 
colour issue (99), and Product label issue (65). 
•  Cases reporting the PT Product temperature excursion issue described product storage 
deviations. 
•  Cases reporting PT Product colour issue described a colourless appearance for the 
vaccine.  The PQC investigation results were pending in these cases. 
•  Cases reporting the PT Product label issue described vaccine administration after the 
beyond-use date, bivalent given as primary dose and second dose, bivalent given 
instead of monovalent, incorrect route of administration (subcutaneous)/bivalent 
diluted by mistake and injected, monovalent given as  1st and 2nd dose, monovalent 
given instead of bivalent, and no expiration date. 
•  The number of product issues did not show a trend that would require a change to the 
RSI. Vaccine administration and details on product storage are adequately described 
in the RSI.  The expiry date is printed on every package. The monovalent and bivalent 
primary series/booster doses are adequately described on the product 
packaging/labelling. The product quality investigations performed for the cases that 
reported PT Product colour issue were pending. 
Surveillance for any correlation ("AE/PC alert") between the number of cases reporting AEs 
and the number of product quality complaints received in the review period is performed 
through review of AE/PC reports and SAE/PC reports, and review of AE-batch/lot trending 
reports. In support to this process as needed, a review of AE data related to respective PCs 
may be requested to support trend analysis and notifications . 
AE/PC alerts are reviewed and evaluated to establish whether there is an association between 
the reported adverse event and the product quality defect or complaint. Upon safety 
evaluation, alerts are closed or undergo evaluation and escalation as per standard procedures. 
Conclusion 
Based on the review of the cases with the most frequently reported lot numbers, no new 
safety issues were identified.

Long-term safety data 
In the PSUR #4, the MAH, based on the review of clinical trial data, cumulative PM data, individual review 
a. 
of cases, and real-world data on mRNA vaccine effectiveness, proposed to remove the important potential risk 
ofV AEDN AERD from the list of the safety concerns. In the AR, the PRAC agreed to remove V AEDN AERD 
from the list of safety concerns in both RMP and PSUR. 
During the reporting period, the MAH submitted the following versions of the EU-RMP: 
1.  Version 9 .1  submitted on 03  March 2023: 
To support the extension of the indication to paediatric individuals aged 6 months to 4 
years to receive bivalent Omicron BA.4/BA.5 modified vaccine (Comimaty 
original/Omicron BA.4-5 (3  micrograms) for primary series and as a 4th dose booster. 
To support the variation of the indication to paediatric individuals aged 5 to  11  years 
to receive bivalent Omicron BA.4/BA.5 modified vaccine (Comimaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4/BA.5 (10 micrograms) for primary series. 
To support the variation of the indication to individuals  12 years of age and older to 
receive bivalent Omicron BA.4/BA.5 modified vaccine (Comimaty Original/Omicron 
BA.4-5 (30 micrograms) for primary series. 
2.  Version 9.2 submitted on 14 April 2023:

Evaluation 
Myositis 
Following receipt of an EMA PRAC adopted recommendation 
(EMA/PRAC/3178/2023) for this signal on 12 January 2023, myositis and 
vaccination with BNTl 62b2 ( original and bivalent) was evaluated by the MAH . 
Evaluation consisted of the review of non-clinical data that showed common 
occurrence of injection site reactions but no microscopic evidence of any 
inflammatory process in muscle sites beyond the injection site on necroscopy ( e.g., 
gastrocnemius, tongue, heart). The clinical study database for 4 completed and 7 
ongoing Pfizer-run clinical studies was searched for relevant reports per the 
MedDRA search strategy for myositis. Three cases were retrieved, all assessed by 
the investigators as not related: One report of dermatomyositis in the pivotal study 
of>44,000 participants (C4591001) occurring on day 44 after dose 3 of 
BNT162b2;  1 report of worsening dermatomyositis in a study of 
immunocompromised participants (C4591024) in a 6-year-old with a history of 
juvenile dermatomyositis occurring 76 days after dose 2 ofBNT162b2; also in 
C4591024, 1 report ofmyositis in a 4 year-old with a history ofrenal 
transplantation occurring 74 days after dose 3 ofBNT162b2. The literature search 
retrieved 10 articles (1  was a pre-print) that were mostly retrospective cohort 
studies in patients with inflammatory myopathies who were surveyed or otherwise 
assessed for flares following vaccination. Some studies reported new cases of 
myositis and flares of underlying disease in a minority of patients, but most authors 
acknowledged that it was not possible to assume a causal association based on their 
results. Indeed, the potential mechanisms for as association hypothesized by the

authors were not uniform. The MAH's safety database disproportionality analysis 
was unremarkable and a review of the 1017 cases retrieved were of variable 
quality. There were  16 cases (15 individuals) without alternative aetiologies that 
had temporality with vaccination. The O/E ratios in some age groups and risk 
windows were greater than 1 suggesting that the number of reported cases may be 
higher than expected compared to unvaccinated persons, however, the risk 
windows for myositis following Comimaty vaccines are unclear, and the caveats of 
the O/E analyses, including the use of several risk windows, one background rate, 
the unknown degree of underreporting, the small number of observations in some 
age stratifications and the possibility of the numerator including patients with a 
medical history ofIIM (that was not reported in the case), need to be weighed in 
consideration. Overall, in the context of the >4 billion doses ofBNT162b2 original 
and bivalent shipped since Dec 2020, the totality of the data did not allow a causal 
link to be concluded. 
In the 2nd adopted PRAC recommendation (12 May 2023), the PRAC agreed that a 
causal association between Comimaty and myositis could not be concluded, and no 
update to the product information and/or the risk management plan was warranted. 
Refer to Appendix 5 for the response to the PRAC's request included in the signal 
AR (PAM-SDA-063, EPITT:  19883) to explore the feasibility ofusing healthcare 
data prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic to better understand the 
occurrence of myositis in a broad population and provide proposals to obtain more 
recent background incidence rates (during the pandemic/immunization campaigns). 
Following receipt of an EMA PRAC adopted recommendation 
(EMA/PRAC/868335/2022) for this signal on 01  December 2022, 
pemphigus/pemphigoid was evaluated by the MAH. On 14 Apr 2023, the PRAC 
concluded that the current evidence was insufficient to establish a causal 
relationship between Comimaty and pemphigus or pemphigoid. They requested 
that within PSUR 5 the MAH perform a review of new emerging data on 
pemphigus and pemphigoid; this can be found in Appendix 5.6. The outcome of 
this updated review does not change the MAH previous assessment which 
concluded that there is insufficient evidence for a causal association between 
Comimatv and pemphilllis/pemphigoid .

cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported following vaccination with 
TRADENAME. Typically, the cases have occurred more often in younger men and after 
the second dose of the vaccine and within 14 days after vaccination. Based on 
accumulating data, the reporting rates of myocarditis and pericarditis after primary series 
in children ages 5 through <12 years are lower than in ages  12 through 17 years. Rates of 
myocarditis and pericarditis in booster doses do not appear to be higher than after the 
second dose in the primary series. The cases are generally mild, and individuals tend to 
recover within a short time following standard treatment and rest. Healthcare 
professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis in 
vaccine recipients". 55

Fatal cases (3): 
A  14-year-old male subject, dose  1 (monovalent [original]), medically confirmed, Germany: 
Medical history: Becker's muscular dystrophy, COVID-19, Cerebral palsy, Cochlea 
implant, Hypoacusis, Intellectual disability, Language disorder, Mental disability, 
Neuromyopathy, Physical disability, Quadriparesis and Wheelchair user. 
Co-suspect medications: none. 
Concomitant medications: none. 
PTs with fatal outcome: Off label use, Circulatory collapse, Pyrexia, Dyspnoea, 
Hypotonia, Hyperpyrexia, Chills, Pericarditis and Myocarditis. 
Time to onset (myocarditis): not reported . 
Causes of death: In addition to the above events that had a fatal outcome, the autopsy 
reported Arnold-Chiari malformation, Marfanoid habitus, Myocarditis and Pericarditis. 
- Comment: The subject with Becker's muscular dystrophy received the 1st dose of 
BNT162b2 for COVID-19 immunisation and neuromyopathy (off label use) and had the 
above reported events that had a fatal outcome the next day of receiving the vaccine. 
There is no information regarding the circumstances around the time of death. In this 
case, the subject's co-morbidities preclude an individual contributory role of the vaccine 
towards the fatal outcome. 
A  14-year-old female subject, dose 3 (monovalent [original]), medically confirmed, Japan: 
Medical history: Orthostatic intolerance. 
Co-suspect medications: none. 
Concomitant medications: none. 
PTs with fatal outcome: Myopericarditis, Myocarditis, Pericarditis, Cardiac failure, 
Arrhythmia, Arrhythmia supraventricular, and Sudden death.

COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (nucleoside modified) 
Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 5 
Reporting Period 
19 December 2022 through 18 June 2023 
Time to onset (myocarditis): 2 days. 
-
- Causes of death: In addition to the above events that had a fatal outcome, the autopsy 
reported Myocarditis, Pericarditis, Pulmonary congestion, and Pulmonary oedema. 
- Comment: The subject with a medical history of orthostatic intolerance received 3rd dose 
ofBNT162b2 and 2 days later was found dead. In this case, a COVID-19 antigen 
quantification test performed using a nasopharyngeal swab taken before autopsy yielded 
negative results. Based on the available information, a vaccine-related multiple-organ 
inflammation (myopericarditis) was diagnosed based on the presence of erythrocyte 
laden macrophages as well as congestive oedema of the lungs on histology suggested 
signs of heart failure from the previous day. Although the extent of inflammation was 
relatively narrow, reporter commented that the presence of foci centered on the atria and 
breathlessness are the findings that raise the suspicion of heart failure  several hours 
before death and led to the diagnosis that the cause of death was vaccine-related 
myopericarditis, which led to severe arrhythmias and progressive heart failure. 
A  15-year-old female subject, dose 2 (monovalent [original]), non-medically confirmed, 
Italy: 
- Medical history: Myeloid leukaemia. 
- Co-suspect medications: none. 
- Concomitant medications: none. 
-
-
- Causes of death: Myocarditis. It was not reported if an autopsy was performed. 
- Comment: The subject with a medical history of myeloid leukaemia in the year 2020 
PTs with fatal outcome: Myocarditis. 
Time to onset (myocarditis): 2 days . 
underwent transplant (on an unknown date).  She received the 1st dose ofBNT162b2 in 
September 2021  and the 2nd dose ofBNT162b2 in January 2022. On an unspecified day 
in January 2022, she developed myocarditis and underwent an unspecified surgery for 
myocarditis and was noted with the recurrence of myeloid leukaemia. It was only 
reported that subject died on 22 February 2022. 
Subjects aged 16 - 17 years

COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (nucleoside modified) 
Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 5 
Reporting Period 
19 December 2022 through 18 June 2023 
Fatal cases (3): 
A 22-year-old male subject, dose 3 (bivalent Omi BA.4/BA.5), medically confirmed, Japan: 
Medical history: none 
Co-suspect medications: none. 
Concomitant medications: none. 
PTs with fatal outcome: Myocarditis, Cardio-respiratory arrest, Ventricular fibrillation, 
Cardiogenic shock. 
Time to onset (myocarditis): 3 days. 
Causes of death: As mentioned above, the events coded to the PTs Myocarditis, 
Cardio-respiratory arrest, Ventricular fibrillation, Cardiogenic shock had a fatal outcome. 
An autopsy was performed, and the cause of death was being evaluated at the time of 
reporting. 
Comment: Limited information: Three (3) days after receiving the 3rd dose of novel 
coronavirus vaccine, the subject experienced suspected myocarditis and was admitted to a 
medical emergency center. When the subject was brought in, the ventricular fibrillation 
was persisting and ECMO was started. The subject was in cardiogenic shock state and 
underwent insertion of Impella CPSA. Despite intensive treatment, he showed no 
improvement and expired 7 days post the vaccination. There is no information in the case 
regarding how or why myocarditis was suspected and if confirmed. Limited information 
provided regarding the subject's medical history limits a meaningful causality assessment 
in this case. 
A 24-year-old male subject, dose 2 (monovalent [original]), non-medically confirmed, US: 
Medical history: none 
Co-suspect medications: none . 
Concomitant medications: none. 
PTs with fatal outcome: Myocarditis, Cardiac failure. 
Time to onset (myocarditis): 40 days. 
Causes of death: As mentioned above, the events coded to the PTs Myocarditis, and 
Cardiac failure.  An autopsy report from the coroner's office showed COVID-19 
vaccine-related myocarditis. 
Comment: The subject received the first dose on 27 August 2021  and was noted with 
blood in his urine. However, he received the second dose on 17 September 2021, and he 
also developed flu-like symptoms that did not resolve. He was visited to the emergency 
department and was treated with amoxicillin/clavulanate, Mucinex and Nyquil. However, 
he was visited again to the emergency department with several symptoms, but none were 
related to cardiac events according to the report. His cough worsened, was found with a 
sinus infection and also developed photosensitivity. Despite intensive treatment, he died 
on 27 October 2021. In this case, based on the available information, a contributory role

COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (nucleoside modified) 
Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 5 
Reporting Period 
19 December 2022 through 18 June 2023 
of the infection cannot be ruled out and it is notable that although detailed history of the 
infectious condition is available for the subject, there is no detail provided regarding the 
myocarditis diagnosis. 
A 21-year-old female subject, dose 2 (monovalent [original], Modema), non-medically 
confirmed, Australia: 
- Medical history: Antiphospholipid syndrome, Appendicectomy, Coagulopathy 
- Co-suspect medications: davesomeran, elasomeran. 
- Concomitant medications: none. 
-
PTs with fatal outcome: Interchange of vaccine products, Cardiac failure, Myocardial 
infarction, and Myocarditis. 
- Time to onset (myocarditis): Not reported. 
- Causes of death: As mentioned above, the events coded to the PTs Cardiac failure, 
Myocardial infarction, and Myocarditis. It is unknown if an autopsy was performed. 
- Comment: The subject with a relevant medical history of coagulopathy received the first 
and the second doses ofBNT162b2 in September and October 2021  followed by 
Modema vaccine for the third dose (booster) on 18 February 2022. On the next day, the 
subject developed events coded to the PTs Syncope, Fall and Head injury. She also had 
events coded to the PTs Malaise, Fatigue, Illness, Abdominal pain upper, Vomiting and 
Pyrexia. She was hospitalized and diagnosed with heart failure.  On 05  March 2022, she 
was drifting in and out of consciousness (PT: Altered state of consciousness). Despite 
treatment on 27 March 2022, she died. Her medical certificate stated that she died of 
myocardial infarction and that she had subacute myocarditis.  In this case, due to 
presence of myocardial infarction that is an ischemic condition, criteria for myocarditis 
are not met.

COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (nucleoside modified) 
Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 5 
Reporting Period 
19 December 2022 through 18 June 2023 
PTs with fatal outcome: Acute cardiac event, Myocarditis, Cardiovascular insufficiency. 
Time to onset (myocarditis): 27 days. 
-
-
- Causes of death:  Clinical autopsy showed lymphocytic myocarditis in the AV-node/ 
bundle of His which was believed to have triggered an acute cardiac event; widespread 
acute aspiration in the lungs; brain with oedema and chronic contusion. Autopsy reported 
cardiovascular insufficiency and myocarditis. 
- Comment: Limited information reported - the subject who received 3 doses of Comimaty 
received the bivalent Omi BA.1  as the 4th dose and developed the above events that had 
a fatal outcome. Due to limited information and a long latency from the vaccination, an 
individual role of vaccine in inducing myocarditis is unassessable.

a.  All serious occurrences. 
b.  For those cases where the event resolved/ resolved with sequelae. 
Fatal cases (23): 
Of these 23  cases, there were  18 medically confirmed cases and 5 non-medically confirmed 
cases. 
•  Non-medically confirmed cases (5): 
Of these 5 non medically confirmed cases, all the cases were elderly subjects where the age 
ranged from 71  to 90.  In these 5 cases, the subject's medical history such as coronary artery 
disease, chronic kidney disease, arteriosclerosis, cardiac disorder, Parkinson's disease or long 
latency period (such as 84 days,  111  days, 585 days) precluded a meaningful causality 
assessment. 
•  Medically confirmed cases (18): 
Of the  18 medically confirmed cases, there were  10 elderly and 8 adult subjects. Of these 
10 elderly cases, where the subjects' age ranged from 71  to 87 years, in 2 cases, the latency 
of the myocarditis events was :S24 hours, where in both the cases, subjects' medical history 
such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, autoimmune thyroiditis, cerebral infarction, obesity, 
thrombophlebitis, precluded an individual contributory role of the BNT162b2 vaccine 
towards the fatal events. In the remaining 8 elderly cases, the subjects' elderly age, or the 
medical history such as hypertension, arterial occlusive disease, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, metastases, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, or long latency periods (such as 
ranging from 56 to 80 days) or limited information on the above details precluded an 
individual contributory role of the BNT162B2 vaccine towards the fatal events . 
In the remaining 8 cases, the subjects' age ranged from 41  to 64 years. In these 8 cases,  1 
case reported co-suspect medication- elasomeran (Modema), where an individual 
contribution of the suspect vaccine towards the fatal event cannot be established. In 1 case, 
the latency was reported as  1 72 days which limits a meaningful causality assessment towards 
an individual contributory role of the BNT162b2 vaccine. In 4 cases, there was limited 
information regarding the subjects' medical history and/or other therapy details such as  onset

COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (nucleoside modified) 
Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 5 
Reporting Period 
19 December 2022 through 18 June 2023 
PTs with fatal outcome: Myopericarditis. 
Time to onset (myocarditis): ::;1  day. 
- Concomitant medications: none. 
-
-
- Causes of death: Arrhythmia and Myopericarditis. 
- Comment: In this case, the subject with a BMI of 31, underwent inpatient opiate 
withdrawal after a herniated disc within 2 weeks prior to receiving the BNT 162b2 
(COVID-19 immunisation vaccine). After receiving the BNT162b2 vaccine, the subject 
died within 12 hours. There was limited information regarding the clinical course of the 
event and the concomitant medications, which limited a meaningful causality assessment. 
A 43-year-old female subject, dose 3 (monovalent [original]), medically confirmed, 
Singapore: 
PTs with fatal outcome: Myocarditis, Pericarditis, and Cardiac arrest. 
Time to onset (myocarditis): :Sl  day. 
- Medical history: none. 
- Co-suspect medications: none. 
- Concomitant medications: none. 
-
-
- Causes of death: Myocarditis, Pericarditis, and Cardiac arrest. 
- Comment: In this case, the subject received the first and second dose ofBNT162b2 in 
June 2021  and received the third dose on 09 December 2021. The next day, the subject 
was hospitalized with atypical chest pain and intrathoracic mass but was found normal 
and discharged. However, she was re-hospitalized as she felt unwell again.  She was 
awaiting further tests to evaluate pulmonary embolism, pericarditis and myocarditis but 
developed cardiac arrest on 12 December 2021, was resuscitated and admitted to ICU. 
The subject had poor prognosis of neurological condition post the cardiac arrest, was 
extubated and died on 13 December 2021. Relevant investigations for this subject 
included normal troponin at admission that increased post-cardiac arrest, normal ECG 
with sinus rhythm, normal CRP. Limited information regarding the diagnostic certainty 
of myocarditis is provided, and in view of the cardiac arrest that occurred, the fatal 
outcome appears more likely related to the preceding cardiac arrest and brain 
dysfunction.

Fatal cases (4): 
Of the 4 cases reporting a fatal outcome, in 1 case, the subject who received BNT162b2 
( original) for COVID-19 immunisation had an underlying medical condition of congestive 
heart failure which confounded the fatal event of carditis (PT:  Carditis). In this case, there 
was limited information regarding the therapy details such as therapy date, onset date of the 
events, latency details, concomitant medications, treatment provided, clinical course details 
of the events and/or autopsy details . 
In the remaining 3 cases (BNT162b2 [original] 2 cases; bivalent Omi BA.4/BA.5  1 case), 
there was too limited information regarding the therapy details such as therapy date, onset 
date of the events, latency details, age, gender, medical history, concomitant medications,

COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (nucleoside modified) 
Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 5 
Reporting Period 
19 December 2022 through 18 June 2023 
•  Relevant event outcome: fatal (6), resolved/resolving (120), resolved with sequelae (17), 
not resolved (106), unknown (132). 
Cumulatively, there were 11,114 cases ofpericarditis which constitute 0.6% of the overall 
PM dataset (1,839,454).  During the current reporting period, there were 379 cases that 
reported pericarditis which constitute 0.5% of 74,102 cases of the total PM dataset, and 
majority (93.9%) of these cases were spontaneously reported.  Of these 379 cases, the 
majority of the cases (271  cases; 71.5%) were reported from adult population with the ages 
ranging from  18 to 64 years of age.  Of these 379 cases where the female subjects (190 cases; 
50.1 %) and the male subjects (179 cases; 47.2%) were reported similar in proportion.  In the 
majority (315 cases; 83 .1 % ) of the cases, the event of pericarditis was reported after the 
original booster dose and relatively less after the bivalent booster doses ( original + Omi BA.1 
or original+ Omi BA.4/BA.5) (16.9%). 
Of the 379 cases reporting events indicative ofpericarditis, 195 cases (51.5%) were 
medically confirmed.  Of the 379 cases, in 109 cases (28.8% of the cases reporting 
pericarditis related events) the events were confounded by subjects' relevant medical history 
such as cardiac disorders, neoplasms, COVID-19, immune disorders, embolic disorders etc 
and/or relevant co-suspect medications.  Of the total 379 cases, in 113 cases (29.8%) the 
cases were confounded by co-reported events indicative of an alternate aetiology, such as 
neoplasms, ischaemic cardiomyopathy/coronary artery disease, infections, or the long time to 
onset of the pericarditis event post-vaccination (>21  days) did not match a suspected vaccine 
induced event.  Of the 379 cases, in 294 cases (77.6%) limited information was available on 
subject's age, latency of events, and/or medical history confounding causality assessment. 
Based on the review of these cases reporting pericarditis events, there was no new significant 
safety information identified during the current reporting period. Hence, no label update is 
warranted based on the analysis of these cases.

0/E Analysis 
O/E analysis was performed for Myocarditis/Pericarditis (see Appendix 5.8 Observed versus 
Expected Analyses for Adverse Events of Special Interest) . 
Conclusion 
Evaluation ofMyocarditis and Pericarditis did not reveal any significant new safety 
information for this interval. 
16.3.2. Evaluation of Important Potential Risks 
In the PSUR #4, the MAH, based on the review of clinical trial data, cumulative PM data, 
individual review of cases, and real-world data on mRNA vaccine effectiveness, proposed to 
remove the important potential risk of V AEDN AERD from the list of the safety concerns. In 
the AR of the PSUR #4 (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010898/202212), the PRAC agreed to 
remove V AEDN AERD from the list of safety concerns in both RMP and PSUR. 
16.3.3. Evaluation of Other Risks (not categorised as important) 
In the PRAC AR of the PSUR #3  (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010898/202206), the PRAC 
requested that For future PSURs in the section  'Evaluation of AESis ',  the cardiovascular 
AESis, haematological AESis, dermatological AESis, facial paralysis,  hepatic AESis, 
musculoskeletal AESis, other AESis, respiratory AESis, vasculitic events,  local adverse 
reactions,  and/or severe reactogenicity should only be included and discussed in the PSUR if 
the reporting pattern changes and/or there is a safety issue/signal.

Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 5 
Reporting Period 
19 December 2022 through 18 June 2023 
Response 
Upon review of the incremental data of cases evaluated for all the above mentioned topics, 
no new safety issues/signals or reporting pattern changes were detected. These topics have 
been removed from the text of the PSUR. 
In the PRAC AR of the PSUR #4 (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010898/202212), the following 
request was made:  The MAH should continue to  closely monitor MIS-Cl-A as outlined in 
PRAC's signal recommendation (EPITT 19732) and all new cases of MIS-Cl-A  including a 
WHO causality assessment should be reported in the future PSURs. 
Response 
Please refer to (Appendix 5.2) for the review of the cases received in the reporting interval. 
As part of the approval letter for the emergency use of Tozinameran- COVID-19 mRNA 
vaccine (nucleoside modified)-COMIRNATY®, the WHO requested the MAH to provide 
additional data on vaccine immunogenicity,  effectiveness and safety on population groups 
represented in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs)  including individuals with 
conditions such as malnutrition and populations with existing co-morbidities such as 
tuberculosis,  human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)  infection and other high prevalent 
infectious diseases. 
In the PRAC AR of the PSUR #4 (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010898/202212), the following 
request was made: For future PSURs in the section  'Evaluation of AESI's ',  the AESis in 
subjects with Malnutrition; HIV infection should only be included and discussed in the PSUR 
if the reporting pattern changes and/or there is a safety issue/signal. 
Response 
Please refer to Section 16.3.3.1. 
There were no other risks that were classified as listed adverse events in which the previous 
PSUR or PSUR assessment report recommended/requested continued monitoring in future 
PSURs and/or risks not categorized as important in which new information has become 
available during the reporting interval that allows further characterisation of a previously 
recognized risk. 
16.3.3.1. Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESis) 
The company's AESI list takes into consideration the lists of AES Is from several expert 
groups and regulatory authorities including but not limited to the following: Brighton 
Collaboration (SPEAC), ACCESS protocol, US CDC (preliminary list of AESI for V AERS 
surveillance), MHRA (unpublished guideline).

Hypersensitivity, Multiple allergy, Seasonal allergy) and/or co-suspect which may have 
contributed to the anaphylaxis related events. 
Analysis by age group 
CT: there are no case reporting anaphylaxis in the CT dataset. 
PM: Paediatric60  (12 - 6 children, 6 adolescents), Adults61  (109), Elderly62  (49) and 
Unknown (18). 
No significant difference was observed in the reporting proportion of anaphylaxis 
relevant PTs between adult and elderly populations. Due to the relative low volume of 
cases in the paediatric population, a meaningful comparison of the same with the other 
age groups was not possible. 
Analysis Original versus Bivalent Vaccines 
The majority of the anaphylaxis cases were reported after administration of the original 
vaccine (52%) rather than the bivalent Omi BA.4/BA.5 vaccine (35.7%); the PT most 
frequently reported was Anaphylactic reaction (70% versus 86% ). Few cases of anaphylaxis 
were reported after the administration of bivalent Omi BA.1, therefore a meaningful 
comparison of the PTs reported with the other 2 vaccines was not possible. 
0/E Analysis 
O/E analysis was performed for Anaphylaxis (see Appendix 5.8 Observed versus Expected 
Analyses for Adverse Events of Special Interest). 
Conclusion 
No new significant safety information was identified based on the review of these cases and 
on the analyses by age group, O/E, and original vs bivalent vaccines.  Safety surveillance will 
continue. 
16.3.3.1.2. COVID-19 AESis 
This AESI with the MedDRA search criteria - SMQ COVID-19 (Narrow and Broad) OR PTs 
Ageusia; Anosmia63  was foreseen as a way to monitor for possible cases of V AEON AERO. 
Because, as agreed by EMA, V AEON AERO has been removed as a safety concern 
(Important potential risk) after >2.5 years of surveillance, COVID-19 will no longer be 
60 Aged less than 17 years. 
61  Aged at least 18 years and less than 65 years. 
62  Aged at least 65 years.

Analysis by age group 
PM: Paediatric (120), Adults (4868), Elderly (2036), Unknown (714). 
No significant difference was observed in the reporting proportion of COVID-19 relevant 
PTs between adult and elderly populations. Due to the relative low volume of cases in the 
paediatric population, a meaningful comparison with other age groups was not possible. 
Analysis Original versus Bivalent Vaccines 
The majority of the long COVID-19 cases was reported after administration of the original 
vaccine (89%), therefore a meaningful comparison of the PTs reported in the 3 vaccines 
groups was not possible. 
0/E Analysis 
O/E analysis was performed for Ageusia/anosmia (see Appendix 5.8 Observed versus 
Expected Analyses for Adverse Events of Special Interest and Appendix 5 .8.1  for age of 
stratified observed cases with O/E ratio > 1 ). 
Conclusion 
No new significant safety information was identified based on the review of these cases and 
on the analyses by age group, O/E and original vs bivalent vaccines. Safety surveillance will 
continue and long COVID-19 will be discussed in the next PSUR if warranted.

conditions included Hypertension (4), Type 2 diabetes mellitus (3), Cholecystectomy, 
Diverticulitis, Dyslipidaemia, Glomerulonephritis, Hypothyroidism and Obesity (2 each). 
Analysis by age group 
PM: Paediatric (8  [1  Child, 7 Adolescents]), Adult (25), Elderly (19), Unknown (3). 
- Among the relevant multisystem inflammatory syndrome events, it was observed that: 
•  PT Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome was reported at a higher frequency in the 
elderly population compared to the adult population (78.9% of the elderly population 
vs 24.0% of the adult population). No cases were reported in the paediatric 
population. 
•  PT Multisystem inflammatory syndrome was reported at a higher frequency in the 
adult population compared to paediatric and elderly populations ( 48% of the adult 
population vs  12.5% of the paediatric population and 10.5% of the elderly 
population). 
•  PT Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children was reported, as expected, 
primarily in the paediatric population (87.5% were in the paediatric population). 
•  PT Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults was reported only in the adult and 
elderly populations (12.0% in the adult population and 10.5% in the elderly 
population); no cases, as expected, were reported in the paediatric population. 
•  PT Systemic inflammatory response syndrome was reported only in patients of 
unknown age and in adults (66.7% in the population of unknown age and 8.0% in the 
adult population); no cases were reported in the paediatric population . 
•  PT Distributive shock was observed only in the adult and elderly populations (8.0% 
in the adult population and 5.3% in the elderly population; no cases in paediatric 
population). 
Analysis Original versus Bivalent Vaccines 
PM: original (45  cases), bivalent Omi BA.I (3  cases), bivalent Omi BA.4/BA.5 (8 cases). 
There were no paediatric patients administered bivalent vaccines. 
Among the three groups, the PT Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome was the most 
frequently reported: there were 17 cases in the original group, 4 cases in the bivalent Omi 
BA.4/BA.5 group and 2 cases in the bivalent Omi BA. I  group. 
The remaining relevant PTs were distributed as follows: 
•  PT Multisystem inflammatory syndrome was reported in cases involving patients 
administered the original vaccine (13  cases) and the bivalent Omi BA.4/BA.5 vaccine (2 
cases); 
•  PTs Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and Systemic inflammatory 
response syndrome were reported exclusively in cases involving patients administered the 
original vaccine (7 cases and 4 cases, respectively);

Reporting Period 
19 December 2022 through 18 June 2023 
Analysis by age group 
CT: Paediatric 1 Child], Adult (1). 
- A meaningful comparison between the different age groups is not possible due to the low 
number of cases. 
PM:  Paediatric (62  [1  Infant,  19 Child, 42 Adolescent]), Adult (813), Elderly (287), 
Unknown (101). 
- Among the most frequently(> 2% of all cases) reported relevant neurological events, it 
was observed that: 
•  Frequently reported seizure-related AEs (PTs Epilepsy. Febrile convulsion. 
Generalised tonic-clonic seizure. and Seizure) were reported at higher frequencies in 
the paediatric population compared to the adult population and the elderly population 
(19.4%, 9.7%, 9.7%, and 38.7%, respectively, in the paediatric population vs 9.5%, 
1.0%, 2.7% and 16.5%, respectively, in the adult population, and 7.7%, none,  1.7%, 
and 14.3%, respectively, in the elderly population). This pattern is consistent with the 
known epidemiology of seizures. 
•  The PTs Neuropathy peripheral and Polyneuropathy were reported at higher 
frequencies in the elderly population compared to the paediatric population and the 
adult population (11.5% and 19.9%, respectively, in the elderly population vs 4.8%% 
and none, respectively, in the paediatric population, and 12.6% and 9.4%, 
respectively, in the adult population). 
•  The PTs Multiple sclerosis and Multiple sclerosis relapse were reported at higher 
frequencies in the adult population compared to the paediatric population and the 
elderly population (9.6% and 2.7%, respectively, in the adult population vs 4.8% and 
none, respectively, in the paediatric population, and 2.4% and 1.1 % in the elderly 
population, respectively). 
•  The PTs Trigeminal neuralgia and Fibromyalgia were reported more frequently in the 
adult population and the elderly population compared to the pediatric population 
(4.8% and 10.0%, respectively, in the adult population and 2.4% and 5.2%, 
respectively, in the elderly population vs none in the pediatric population). 
•  The PT Guillain-Barre syndrome was reported more frequently in the elderly 
population than in the adult or pediatric populations (17.8% vs 8.0% and 4.8%, 
respectively).

COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (nucleoside modified) 
Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 5 
Reporting Period 
19 December 2022 through 18 June 2023 
Analysis by age group 
PM: Paediatric (8  [1  Child, 7 Adolescent]), Adult (59), Elderly (31) and Unknown (5). 
- The most frequently reported Glomerulonephritis and Nephrotic Syndrome AE in adults 
and elderly subjects coded to the PT Nephrotic syndrome (28.8% and 41.9% of adults 
and elderly, respectively).  The PT IgA nephropathy was higher in adult population when 
compared to elderly population (25.4% in adults vs 3.2% in elderly).  Other PTs were 
reported in similar reporting proportions in both adults and the elderly.  Due to the 
relative low volume of cases in the paediatric population and for cases with age 
unknown, a meaningful comparison of the same with the other age groups was not 
possible. 
Analysis Original versus Bivalent Vaccines 
PM: original (92), bivalent Omi BA.1  (3), and bivalent Omi BA.4/BA.5 (8).  The number of 
cases for bivalent Omi BA.1, and bivalent Omi BA.4/BA.5 (5  and 8, respectively) are too 
small to all for a meaningful comparison to the occurrence of Glomerulonephritis/nephrotic 
syndrome in cases treated with BNT162b2. 
0/E Analysis 
O/E analysis was performed for Glomerulonephritis/nephrotic syndrome (see Appendix 5.8 
Observed versus Expected Analyses for Adverse Events of Special Interest). 
Conclusion 
No new significant safety information has emerged based on the review of these cases and on 
the analyses by age group, O/E and original vs bivalent vaccines. Safety surveillance will 
continue.

Analysis Original versus Bivalent Vaccines 
PM: original (571), bivalent Omi BA.I  (52), and bivalent Omi BA.4/BA.5 (141). 
- Among the frequently (2:3%) reported stroke related events by original cases, bivalent 
Omi BA. I cases, and bivalent Omi BA.4/BA.5 cases during the reporting interval, it was 
observed that: 
•  PTs Cerebral ischaemia and Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis were reported at a 
higher frequency in subjects administered original when compared to subjects 
administered bivalent Omi BA.I and bivalent Omi BA.4/BA.5 (Cerebral ischaemia 
[3.5% in original vs none in bivalent Omi BA.I  and 2.8% in bivalent Omi 
BA.4/BA.5], Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis [6.5% in original vs none in bivalent 
Omi BA. I and 2.1 % in bivalent Omi BA.4/BA.5]). 
•  PT Cerebral haemorrhage was reported at a higher frequency in subjects administered 
bivalent Omi BA.4/BA.5 (11.3%) when compared to subjects administered original 
(6.8%) and bivalent Omi BA.I (3.8%). No significant difference observed in the other 
most frequently reported events among these groups. 
O/E Analysis 
O/E analysis was performed for CVST, Ischaemic stroke and Haemorrhagic stroke, 
respectively (see Appendix 5.8 Observed versus Expected Analyses for Adverse Events of 
Special Interest). 
Conclusion 
No new significant safety information have emerged based on the review of these cases and 
on the analyses by age group, O/E and original vs bivalent vaccines. Safety surveillance will

COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (nucleoside modified) 
Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 5 
Reporting Period 
19 December 2022 through 18 June 2023 
Analysis Original versus Bivalent Vaccines 
There are no differences in reporting proportion between cases involving administration of 
original vaccine ( 11  cases) compared to cases involving administration of bivalent vaccines 
(12 cases, of which 4 bivalent Omi BA. I and 8 bivalent Omi BA.4/BA.5). 
Sudden death was the only reported PT in 15 cases ( of which 4 bivalent Omi BA. l, 6 
bivalent Omi BA.4/BA.5, and 5 original vaccine). 
In the remaining 8 cases, other fatal SAEs were reported along with Sudden death: 
•  Six ( 6) cases involved administration of the original vaccine; in 5 of these cases, 
along with the PTs Sudden death, cardiac SAEs (3  cases), or Pulmonary embolism (2 
cases) were reported; in the last case the co-reported fatal PTs were Musculoskeletal 
chest pain, Dyspnoea, Loss of consciousness, Syncope, and Resuscitation. 
•  Two (2) cases involved administration of the bivalent Omi BA.4/BA.5; cardiac SAEs 
were the co-reported fatal PTs in both cases. 
0/E Analysis 
O/E analysis was performed for Sudden death (see Appendix 5.8 Observed versus Expected 
Analyses for Adverse Events of Special Interest). 
Conclusion 
No new significant safety information has emerged based on the review of these cases and on 
the analyses by age group, O/E and original vs bivalent vaccines. Safety surveillance will 
continue.

COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (nucleoside modified) 
Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 5 
Reporting Period 
19 December 2022 through 18 June 2023 
PM: Paediatric (14  [3  Child,  11  Adolescent]), Adults (689), Elderly (408), Unknown (106). 
- Due to the relative low volume of cases in the paediatric population, a meaningful 
comparison of the same with the other age groups was not possible. No significant 
difference was observed in the reporting proportion of the most frequently (2'.:50 
occurrences) reported thromboembolic AES Is, between the adult and elderly populations. 
Analysis Original versus Bivalent Vaccines 
PM: original (968), bivalent Omi BA.1  (89), and bivalent Omi BA.4/BA.5 (160).  No 
significant difference observed in the most frequently (2'.:5%) reported events among these 
groups. 
O/E Analysis 
O/E analysis was performed for Arterial thromboembolism, Deep vein thrombosis, 
Disseminated intravascular coagulation, Thrombotic thrombocytopenia syndrome and 
Venous thromboembolism respectively (see Appendix 5.8 Observed versus Expected 
Analyses for Adverse Events of Special Interest). 
Conclusion 
No new significant safety information has emerged based on the review of these cases, and 
on the analyses by age group, O/E and original vs bivalent vaccines. Safety surveillance will 
continue. 
Overall AESI Conclusion 
Considering that the review of the cases reporting AES Is identified no new significant safety 
information, the MAH proposes to include and discuss AES Is in future PSURs only if the 
reporting pattern changes and/or significant new safety information is evident. 
At this time, the BNT162b2 vaccines have been administered to an unprecedented number of 
individuals worldwide and approximately 30 months of clinical trial safety data review, post 
authorization surveillance and signal management activities have elapsed. The safety profile 
of the COVID-19 vaccine is well-characterized, however surveillance will continue. 
Based on regulatory authority feedback, knowledge gained about the product safety profile, 
and the recognition that AESis for products will evolve over time as knowledge about a 
product's safety profile grows, it is appropriate to review the AESI/TME list and revise it as 
needed to stay current and improve surveillance. Pfizer will continue to utilize and refine the 
AESI list as appropriate for signal detection activities (including O/E analyses) and in 
preparation for safety aggregate reports.  At present, the AESI list is synonymous with the 
targeted medical event (TME) list which is a MedDRA-based list of> 1900 unique PTs, 
leading to more of a SOC-based approach of aggregate case review. Commensurate with the 
safety profile of the vaccine, the future AESI list will reflect specific medical conditions 
coupled with appropriate MedDRA-derived search strategies for each AESI.

Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 5 
Reporting Period 
19 December 2022 through 18 June 2023 
16.3.4. Evaluation of Special Situations 
In the PRAC AR of the PSUR #3  (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010898/202206), the following 
request was made: For future PSURs in the section  'Evaluation of special situations',  the 
overdose, abuse,  misuse,  and drug dependency,  occupational exposure,  off-label use,  and/or 
unexpected therapeutic effect should only be included and discussed in the PSUR if the 
reporting pattern changes and/or there is a safety issue/signal. 
Response 
Upon review of the incremental data of cases evaluated for all the above-mentioned topics, 
no new safety issues/signals or reporting pattern changes were detected. These topics have 
been removed from the evaluation of special situations discussed in 
Section 16.3.4. Evaluation of Special Situations of the PSUR. 
New data identified during the reporting interval for use ofBNT162b2 by special subject 
situations is described below. 
16.3.4.1. Lack of Therapeutic Efficacy 
Lack of efficacy cases 
Search criteria - PTs Drug ineffective; Vaccination failure. 
Of the 7062 cases,  14 cases were determined to be non-contributory and were not included in 
the discussion for the following reasons: 
-
-
-
Two (2) cases are not considered as true lack of efficacy cases because the subjects 
developed COVID-19 infection between days  1-13 from the first dose. 
In 3 cases, subjects did not develop COVID-19 infection. 
In 9 cases, the lack of efficacy PT did not refer to original or bivalent COVID-19 
vaccme. 
Clinical Trial Data 
There was no lack of efficacy cases in the clinical trial dataset for both this reporting period 
and for the reporting period of PSUR #4. 
Post-Authorisation Data 
•  Number of cases: 7048 (original [4896], bivalent Omi BA.1  [196], bivalent 
Omi BA.4/BA.5 [1956]) (9.5% of 74,102 cases, the total PM dataset), compared to 
56,095 cases (19.8%) in PSUR #4 . 
•  MC cases (2010), NMC cases (5038).

16.3.5. Update on Special Patient Populations 
In the PRAC AR of the PSUR #3  (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010898/202206), the following 
request was made: For future PSURs in the section  'Update on special patient populations', 
the use in frail patients with co-morbidities, and/or interactions with other vaccines should 
only be included and discussed in the PSUR if the reporting pattern changes and/or there is a 
safety issue/signal. 
Response 
Upon review of the incremental data of cases reported in frail patients with comorbidities 
and/or interactions with other vaccines, no new safety issues/signals or reporting pattern 
changes were detected. These populations have been removed from the populations discussed 
in Section 16.3.5 Update on Special Patient Populations of the PSUR. 
As part of the approval letter for the emergency use of Tozinameran - COVID-19 mRNA 
vaccine (nucleoside modified)- COMIRNATY®, the WHO requested the MAH to present 
the outcome of the cases of pregnancy observed in the clinical studies. 
Response 
Please refer to Section 16.3.5.2 Use in Pregnant/Lactating Women  for a general overview of 
the use ofBNT162b2 in this population. 
In the AR of the PSUR #4 (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010898/202212), the following request 
was made: For future PSURs in the section  'Update on special populations',  the use in 
elderly should only be included and discussed in the PSUR if the reporting pattern changes 
and/or there is a safety issue/signal. 
Response 
Upon review of the incremental data of cases reported in elderly population, no new safety 
issues/signals or reporting pattern changes were detected. This population has been removed 
from the populations discussed in Section 16.3.5 Update on Special Patient Populations of 
thePSUR. 
The populations of immunocompromised patients and of patients with autoimmune or 
inflammatory disorders are summarised in Section 16.4.2 Description of Missing 
information. 
16.3.5.1. Use in Paediatric Patients 
Search criteria - Paediatric cases are identified as cases where the Age Range derived field 
value for the patient is "Less than or equal to  17 years". Cases indicative of exposure to the 
vaccine during the mother's pregnancy or through breastfeeding were excluded.

The 3 fatal cases are summarised below: 
The I st case (NMC) reported only PT Death as the fatal AE. Neither cause of death nor 
information on autopsy was provided in this case involving a 2-year-old male subject "who 
died after being vaccinated (timing of vaccination and date of death was not reported.)". 
Limited information was provided, precluding any meaningful assessment. 
The 2nd  case (MC) originated from Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency 
(PMDA), in which the 1-year-old male subject received dose 3 (maroon cap) for COVID-19 
immunisation on 16 February 2023. On the next day, he experienced minor pyrexia and 
productive cough. On 18 February 2023, the subject developed cardio-respiratory arrest and 
his body temperature decreased and died on the same day, although treatments included 
Endotracheal intubation, gastric intubation, intraosseous needle placement, adrenaline 
intravenous injection, and Meylon (sodium bicarbonate) intravenous injection. In this case, 
the subject had severe underlying diseases (such as blood calcium abnormal, blood 
phosphorus abnormal, cardiac failure, cardiac hypertrophy, congenital nephrotic syndrome, 
gastrooesophageal reflux disease, gene mutation [Pierson syndrome], hypertension, 
hypertensive heart disease, hyperuricaemia, peritoneal dialysis, respiratory disorder, 
respiratory muscle weakness, therapeutic aspiration, and upper respiratory tract

vaccination and the fatal event (PT coded to Cardio-respiratory arrest). 
The 3rd case (MC) originated from Taiwan Center for Disease Control, which involved a 4-
year-old male subject, who experienced events with PTs coded to Arrhythmia, Loss of 
consciousness, Seizure, Sinus tachycardia, Supraventricular tachycardia, Muscle rigidity, and 
Cyanosis and died 11  days after the second dose ofBNT162b2. The subject's medical history 
and concomitant medications were not reported. No autopsy was performed. Causality

COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (nucleoside modified) 
Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 5 
Reporting Period 
19 December 2022 through 18 June 2023 
The  13  fatal cases are summarised below: 
In 4 MC cases, limited information was provided, precluding any meaningful assessment. 
The subjects' medical history/underlying conditions, concomitant medications, or date of 
death were not reported. Neither lab data nor information on autopsy was provided in these 4 
cases. 
In 2 NMC cases reported by a lawyer, both adolescents (unspecified ages) were reported to 
have sudden cardiac arrest within a week ofBNT162b2 vaccination. Although it was not 
reported if autopsies were performed, the reporter stated that "pathologists recognized signs 
of poisoning and concluded that poisoning by the vaccine-induced spike protein was more 
likely to lead to death." Information on subject's medical history, concomitant medications 
and date of death was not provided. 
In 1 MC case, a 17-year-old male subject received expired BNT162b2 for COVID-19 
immunisation (PT coded to Expired product administered). The subject experienced fatal 
events ( acute myocardial infarction, headache, pain, and vomiting) about 2 months after 
vaccination. The subject's medical history, concomitant medications, date of death and 
information on autopsy were not reported. 
In 4 cases, the underlying medical conditions could have predisposed to the occurrence of the 
fatal AEs: 
•  One (1) MC case involved a 14-year-old male subject, who received BNT162b2 dose  1, 
0.3 ml single for COVID-19 immunisation and neuromuscular disease (fatal PT coded to 
Off label use). Other fatal PTs were coded to Circulatory collapse, Pyrexia, Dyspnoea, 
Hypotonia, Hyperpyrexia, Chills, Pericarditis, and Myocarditis. The subject's death was 
possibly due to his severe underlying conditions, coded as Becker's muscular dystrophy, 
cerebral palsy, cochlea implant, COVID-19, hypoacusis, intellectual disability, language 
disorder, mental disability, neuromyopathy, physical disability, quadriparesis, and 
wheelchair user . 
•  One (1) NMC case involved a 15-year-old female  subject who had underlying myeloid 
leukaemia, which could attribute to her fatal events (myocarditis, disease recurrence, and 
myeloid leukaemia). 
• 
• 
In 1 MC case, a 14-year-old female subject had severe underlying condition of Dravet 
syndrome and COVID-19 and was medicated with multiple antiepileptic drugs, which 
were confounding factors for the causality assessment between BNT l 62b2 vaccination 
and her fatal events (vaccination failure, COVID-19, hyperthermia, shock, COVID-19 
pneumonia, and cardiac arrest). 
In 1 MC case, although the medical history was not reported, the  17-year-old female 
subject received multiple concomitant medications (such as amitriptyline, azathioprine, 
buprenorphine, colecalciferol, etanercept, paracetamol, piroxicam, prednisolone, and 
zoledronic acid), which were confounding factors for determination of the causal 
relationship between BNT 162b2 vaccination and the fatal events ( arrhythmogenic right 
ventricular dysplasia, Escherichia sepsis, and vomiting).

COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (nucleoside modified) 
Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 5 
Reporting Period 
19 December 2022 through 18 June 2023 
In the remaining 2 cases, potential explanations other than vaccination for death are not 
evident in the reports however in the first case there is very limited information provided: 
• 
• 
In 1 NMC case, a 12-year-old female subject died of myocardial infarction 5 days after 
receiving BNT162b2 as dose  1, single for COVID-19 immunisation. The subject's 
medical history, concomitant medications, and information on autopsy were not reported. 
In 1 MC literature case73  reporting a 14-year-old female subject with following fatal PTs 
Myopericarditis, Cardiac failure, Arrhythmia, Arrhythmia supraventricular, Myocarditis, 
Pericarditis, and Sudden death, no confounding factors have been identified. Autopsy 
result showed inflammatory findings of pericardia! tissue. 
Analysis of confounders and risk factors 
Among the 2961  cases involving paediatric subjects, 763  cases included one or more 
confounders that prevented a clear causality assessment: co-suspect and/or concomitant drugs 
(355 cases) and/or underlying medical history (546 cases). 
Literature 
During the reporting period, a literature article reporting important safety information about 
the use of bivalent vaccines and children aged 5-11  years was identified. Please refer to 
Section 11  Literature for further details. 
Conclusion 
Upon review, the most frequently reported AEs indicative of vaccination errors had a higher 
reporting proportion in paediatric groups < 5 years and ~5  Years and :S  11  Years of Ages 
compared to the ~ 12 years of age; while the most frequent AEs indicative of reactogenicity 
type had a higher reporting proportion in paediatric group ~ 12 years of age compared to 
groups of< 5 years and ~5  Years and :S  11  Years of Ages. Of the frequently reported AEs 
(~2%) in the paediatric dataset, Pyrexia had a higher reporting proportion compared to the 
non-paediatric dataset (4.7% vs 2.6%). The medication errors reported in this population 
were in large majority not associated with harm. 
No new significant safety information was identified based on the review of the cases 
reported in the overall paediatric population. The most frequently reported AEs 74 were 
consistent with the known reactogenicity and safety profile of the vaccine and listed in 
Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use and/or in Section 4.8 Undesirable 
effects of the CDS.

2023, 63:  102244(1-4). 
74  For the CT cases, the analysis was focused on AEs assessed as related to BNT162b2 or blinded therapy.

Clinical Trial Data 
•  Number of pregnancy cases: 2 (2.4% of the total 82 cases from the CT dataset).  Cases 
originated from clinical studies BNT162-17 and C4591007 (1  each) and study treatment 
was reported as BNT162b2 B.1.1.7, BNT162b2 B.1.617.2 (1) and blinded therapy (1). 
•  Country/region of incidence:  an~  (1  each). 
•  Two (2) serious retrospective maternal cases reported event coded to the PT Abortion 
spontaneous (1  each), which occurred in the vaccinated pregnant females.  In these 
2 cases only the event of abortion spontaneous was reported and the trimester of exposure 
was unknown.  Of these 2 cases, in 1 case the subject had a medical history of 
hypertension and was on concomitant medication ethinylestradiol, levonorgestrel which 
might have contributed to the reported event.  In the remaining case there was limited 
information regarding the obstetric history which precluded meaningful causality 
assessment. 
Post-Authorisation Data 
•  Number of pregnancy cases: 464 (original [397], bivalent Omi BA.1  [34], bivalent Omi 
BA.4/BA.5  [33]; 0.6% of 74,102 cases, the total PM dataset), compared to 988 cases 
(0.3%) retrieved in the PSUR #4.  These 464 cases represent 422 unique pregnancies 
(2 cases [ a mother case and a foetus/baby case] or 3 cases [ a mother case and 
2 foetus/baby cases for twins] were created for 41  pregnancies). 
•  Country/region of incidence (~20):  Sweden (152), UK (76), Germany (53), US (29), 
France (26), Norway (20). 
•  Of the 407 mother cases, 62 cases reported exposure to vaccine in utero without the 
occurrence of any clinical event.  The pregnancy exposure events were coded to the PTs 
Maternal exposure during pregnancy (47), Maternal exposure timing unspecified (13), 
Maternal exposure before pregnancy (2). 
•  There were 345 mother cases of which 169 were serious and 176 were non-serious 
reporting additional clinical events, which occurred in the vaccinated pregnant females.

trimester, in 3 cases foetus was exposed during 2nd trimester and in 1 case foetus was 
exposed during 3rd trimester.  Of these 12 cases, in 1 case mother of the baby had a 
medical history of tobacco use which might have contributed to the reported event 
i.e., hypospadias and cerebral calcification.  In the remaining 11  cases, there was 
limited information regarding mother's obstetric history which precluded meaningful 
causality assessment. 
Pregnancy outcome:  Spontaneous abortion:  14 cases reported spontaneous abortion . 
Of these  14 cases, information regarding trimester of exposure was provided in 
2 cases.  Of these 2 cases, in 1 case foetus was exposed during  pt trimester, in 1 case

Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 5 
Reporting Period 
19 December 2022 through 18 June 2023 
Literature 
Review of the literature did not identify any new safety information regarding the use of 
BNTl 62b2 in pregnant/lactating women. 
Conclusion 
There were no safety signals regarding use in pregnant/lactating women that emerged from 
the review of these cases or the medical literature. 
16.4. Characterisation of Risks 
In the PSUR #4, the MAH, based on the review of clinical trial data, cumulative PM data, 
individual review of cases, and real-world data on mRNA vaccine effectiveness, proposed to 
remove the important potential risk ofVAEDN AERD from the list of the safety concerns. In 
the AR, the PRAC agreed to remove V AEDN AERD from the list of safety concerns in both 
RMP  and PSUR. 
16.4.1. Characterisation of Important Identified and Potential Risks 
A typical medicinal product has multiple risks associated with it and individual risks vary in 
terms of severity, effect on individual patients, and public health impact. 
What constitutes an important risk depends upon several factors including the impact on the 
individual subject, the seriousness of the risk and its severity, and the impact on public 
health. In addition, risks, which, whilst not normally serious enough to require specific 
warnings or precautions but which occur in a significant proportion of the treated population, 
affect the quality of the treated person's life, and which could lead to serious consequences if 
untreated should also be considered.  Risks may be related to nonclinical or clinical safety or 
quality issues.  The intended purpose and impact of the product e.g., whether it is intended to 
prevent disease, to prevent particular serious outcomes due to a condition or to reduce 
progression of a chronic disease must also be considered when characterising risks. 
The following were considered in characterising risk(s) of this product: 
• 
frequency of risk; 
•  public health impact (severity and seriousness/reversibility/outcomes); 
• 
impact on the individual patient ( effect on quality of life or could lead to serious 
consequences if left untreated); 
• 
risk factors (including patient factors, dose, at risk period, additive or synergistic factors); 
•  preventability (ie, predictability of a risk, whether risk factors have been identified, or 
possibility of detection at an early stage which could mitigate seriousness); 
•  potential mechanism; 
• 
evidence source(s) and strength of the evidence .

COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (nucleoside modified) 
Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 5 
Reporting Period 
19 December 2022 through 18 June 2023 
Internal and external datasets were used to populate the table below with available data.  In 
addition to literature searches for the drug itself and its class, external data sources were 
consulted. 
Please see Appendix 8 for the characterisation of the important identified and important 
potential risks77  ofBNT162b2, consistent with Part II, Module SVII of the BNT162b2 
EU-RMP version 10.0 approved on 22 June 2023. 
The threshold for investigating a safety concern further will depend upon the indication, the 
target population, and the likely impact on public health.  For example, a safety concern with 
a vaccine might have a lower threshold for investigation than the same issue in a medicinal 
product used in the palliative treatment of metastatic cancer.  The risks for BNT162b2 are 
well managed.  No special investigations to further characterise any of these risks are 
necessary. 
Summary information from clinical trials and post-marketing sources received by the MAH 
through 18 June 2023 is provided in Section 16.4.1.1  and Section 16.4.1.2.

16.4.2. Description of Missing Information 
Table 57 describes missing information associated with the use ofBNT162b2.

Use in

patients79 
Description 
The safety profile of the vaccine in pregnant and/or breastfeeding women was not 
studied in the pivotal clinical trial and the maternal clinical trial was terminated 
early due to participant recruitment difficulties. Many pregnant women have 
chosen to be vaccinated despite the lack of clinical trial safety data. It will be 
important to follow these women for pregnancy and birth outcomes. The timing of 
vaccination in a pregnant woman and the subsequent immune response may have 
varying favourable or unfavourable impacts on the embryo/foetus. The clinical 
consequences ofSARS-CoV-2 infection to the woman and foetus during 
pregnancy is not yet fully understood and the pregnant woman's baseline health 
status may affect both the clinical course of her pregnancy and the severity of 
COVID-19. These factors and the extent to which the pregnant woman may be at 
risk of exposure to SARS-Co V-2 will influence the benefit risk considerations for 
use of the vaccine. 
Cases indicative of use in pregnancy and while breastfeeding received during the 
reporting interval are summarised in Section 16.3.5.2 Use in Pregnant/Lactating 
Women. 
The vaccine is being studied in an ongoing clinical trial of individuals with 
immunocompromised conditions.

or inflammatory disorders were 
consistent with those observed in the 
overall population. 
Exacerbation or Flare-up 
Of the 330 cases that reported PTs 
indicative of exacerbation or flare,  130 
cases were determined to be non-
contributory and were not included in the 
discussion for the following reason: 
-
The events referred to an 
exacerbation/progression of an 
underlying condition that was not an 
autoimmune or inflammatory disorder 
(e.g., pain, fatigue, menstruation, 
COVID-19/long COVID ). 
Therefore, 200 cases are included in the 
analysis below .

Long term safety data 
During the reporting interval, 2 PM cases ( of which 1 serious) reported the 
interaction with the influenza vaccine inact split 4V and pneumococcal vaccine. 
The non-serious case reporting an interaction with the original COVID-19 vaccine 
and pneumonia vaccine did not report any additional AEs.  The serious case 
reporting an interaction with the bivalent Omi BA.4/BA.5 and influenza vaccine 
inact split 4V co-reported the following AEs: Encephalopathy, Decreased appetite, 
and Constipation (1  each) . 
At the time of the initial submission, 2-month post dose 2 safety data were 
available for approximately half of the patients who have received BNT162b2 
mRNA vaccine in Study C4591001. 
The ongoing non-interventional safety studies will collect longer term post-
marketing safety data.

17. BENEFIT EVALUATION 
17.1. Important Baseline Efficacy and Effectiveness Information 
BNT162b2 is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by 
SARS-Co V-2 virus in individuals 6 months of age and older. 82 
17.1.1. Clinical Study Data in Individuals 2::12  Years of Age 
Study C4591001  is a multicenter, placebo controlled- efficacy study in participants 12 years 
of age and older.  Randomisation was stratified by age:  12 through 15 years of age, 
16 through 55 years of age, or 56 years of age and older, with a minimum of 40% of 
participants in the 2::56-year stratum. 83  The study excluded participants who were 
immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological diagnosis of 
COVID-19. 82  Participants with pre-existing stable disease, defined as disease not requiring 
significant change in therapy or hospitalisation for worsening disease during the 6 weeks 
before enrolment, 84 were included as were participants with known stable infection with 
HIV, HCV, orHBV. 82 
Efficacy analyses were performed with confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued during blinded 
placebo-controlled follow-up through 13  March 2021, representing up to 6 months of 
follow-up after dose 2 for participants in the efficacy population, see table below.

Efficacy against severe COVID-19 
As of 13 March 2021, vaccine efficacy against severe COVID-19 is presented only for 
participants with or without prior SARS-Co V-2 infection (Table 61) as the COVID-19 case 
counts in participants without prior SARS-Co V-2 infection were the same as those in 
participants with or without prior SARS-Co V-2 infection in both the TRADENAME and 
placebo groups.

Reporting Period 
19 December 2022 through 18 June 2023 
TRADENAME in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (n = 190) was non-inferior to the 
immune response in participants 16 through 25 years of age (n = 170), based on results for 
SARS-Co V-2 neutralising titers at 1 month after dose 2.  The GMT ratio of the adolescents 
12 to  15 years of age group to the participants 16 through 25 years of age group was 1.76, 
with a 2-sided 95% CI of 1.47 to 2.10, meeting the 1.5-fold non-inferiority criterion (the 
lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR >0.67) which indicates a statistically greater 
response in the adolescents 12 to 15 years of age than that of participants 16 through 25 years 
of age. 96 
Efficacy and immunogenicity in participants 2".:  16 years of age after booster dose 
Neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers and SI-binding IgG antibodies were evaluated at 
6 months after dose 2 for Study C4591001. The data noted the persistence of a robust 
immune response elicited by BNT162b2 30 µg vaccination in adults for up to 6 months; and 
also suggest, based on the modest decline in GMTs and GMCs from  1 month to 6 months 
after receiving dose 2, that vaccinees may benefit from a booster dose at 6 months or 
thereafter. Study C4591031  was designed to assess a booster dose in this participant 
population. 
Study C4591031  Substudy A is a Phase 3 randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind 
substudy to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of a booster dose of BNTl 62b2. 
Participants 2".:16  years of age who have completed a 2-dose primary series ofBNT162b2 in 
Study C4591001, at least 6 months prior to randomisation, were enrolled and participants 
were randomised at a ratio of 1: 1 to receive either BNT 162b2 or placebo.  Randomisation 
was stratified by age, such that approximately 60% of participants enrolled were to be 2".: 16 to 
55 years of age and approximately 40% of participants >55 years of age . 
Considering the observation of waning effectiveness and recommendation for booster doses 
in some countries, per the protocol, participants could be unblinded from 24 September 2021 
onwards and those randomised to receive a booster dose of placebo were offered a dose of 
BNT162b2 30 µg to receive a booster of active vaccine . 
In the 6-month interim report for Substudy A, efficacy analysis of a single booster dose of 
BNT 162b2 30 µg from 7 days after booster dose during the blinded placebo-controlled 
follow-up period was evaluated; also, incidence of COVID-19 cases through the entire study 
follow-up period in participants who received BNT l 62b2 initially or subsequently after 
unblinding was analysed. 
Demographics of participants in the evaluable efficacy populations without evidence of 
infection prior to 7 days after booster vaccination were similar in the BNT162b2 and placebo 
groups.  This analysis population had similar demographics compared to the overall safety

population, as did the evaluable efficacy population participants with or without evidence of 
infection prior to 7 days after booster vaccination and the all-available efficacy population. 
For participants without evidence of infection prior to 7 days after booster vaccination in the 
evaluable efficacy population, the median duration of blinded follow-up after booster 
vaccination was 2.8 months as of the data cutoff date and was similar to the safety 
population.  Of these participants originally randomized to the BNT162b2 group, the total 
exposure from booster vaccination to the data cutoff date was ~6 months for most 
participants (99.0%). 
Follow-up times after booster vaccination for participants with or without evidence of 
infection prior to 7 days after booster vaccination in the evaluable efficacy population were 
similar to the evaluable efficacy population. 
After unblinding, in the all-available efficacy population, there were 7 cases meeting severe 
criteria; all occurred after 20 December 2021, when the Omicron variant was the 
predominant strain, in participants who were baseline SARS-Co V-2 negative.  In original 
BNT l 62b2 participants, there were 5 severe cases: 3 met the FDA definition,  1 met the CDC 
definition, and 1 met both definitions. In placebo participants who later received BNT162b2, 
there were 2 severe cases that met the FDA definition. 
These results indicate that a booster dose ofBNT162b2 30 µg  given ~6 months after the 
primary 2-dose series of BNT l 62b2 30 µg  vaccination provided protection against 
COVID-19, and protection was strongest during the Delta variant wave, and sustained up to 4 
months after vaccination; longer term protection against Delta variant relative to placebo 
cannot be estimated from this study due to unblinding and crossover of placebo control 
participants. For the same reason, RVE of boosted to non-boosted participants during the 
Omicron variant wave cannot be estimated in this study.  Although the IR during Omicron 
wave is much higher than that of Delta wave, the IR in those participants that were  'later' 
vaccinated is lower than those participants that were 'early' vaccinated, which implies better 
protection against Omicron with recent vaccination . 
Clinical Study Data for Omicron BA.I-Adapted Vaccines in Individuals ~18 Years of Age 
Substudy D of C4591031  is a randomized substudy composed of open-labeled and observer 
blinded groups to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a 2-dose primary 
series ofBNT162b2 Omi, and as a booster (third, fourth, or fifth) dose.  Participants ~18 
years of age to ~55 years of age were emolled.  The study consists of 3 cohorts: 
Participants in Cohort 1 completed a 2-dose primary series ofBNT162b2 
(30-µg  doses), with their last dose 90 to 240 days prior to emollment. Participants were 
randomized at a ratio of 1 : 1 : 1 either to receive 1 dose ( third) of BNT l 62b2 Omi ( Group 1 ), 2 
doses (third and fourth) ofBNT162b2 Omi, 4 weeks apart (Group 2), or 1 dose (third) of 
BNT162b2 (Group 2b). Randomization was stratified by age (stratified as  18-30 and 
31-55 years of age). 
Participants in Cohort 2, emolled from Study C4591001  and C4591031  Substudy A, 
completed a 2-dose primary series and received a single booster (third) dose ofBNT162b2,

age). 
In Cohort 3, participants 18 through 55  years of age who were COVID-19 vaccine--nai've and 
had not experienced COVID-19 were enrolled to receive 2 doses (primary series) of 
BNT162b2 Omi, 3 weeks apart, with a dose ofBNT162b2 approximately 5 months later 
(Group 5). 
Interim analysis performed at 1 month post dose for cohort 2 demonstrated, for the primary 
and secondary immunogenicity analyses for the Omicron variant, BNT162b2 Omi 30 µg met 
the pre-specified criteria for simple superiority with respect to GMR and noninferiority with 
respect to seroresponse rate when compared to BNT162b2 30 µg  when administered as a 
fourth dose. 
In participants without prior evidence of infection up to  1 month after Dose 4, for the 
Omicron (BA. I) variant: 
•  The ratio of GMTs for the BNT162b2 Omi group to BNT162b2 group (GMR) was  1.75 
(2-sided 95% CI:  1.39, 2.22). As the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for GMR was 
> 1, the simple superiority of BNT162b2 Omi to BNT162b2 for the Omicron variant was 
achieved based on GMR at 1 month after Dose 4. 
•  Seroresponse rates to the Omicron variant were 62.3% in the BNT162b2 Omi group and 
39.3% in the BNT162b2 group, and the difference in proportions of participants who 
achieved seroresponse to Omicron variant between the BNT162b2 Omi and BNT162b2 
groups was 23.0% (2-sided 95% CI:  11.1 %, 34.3%). As the lower bound of the 2-sided 
95% CI for GMR was greater than the prespecified margin of -5%, noninferiority of 
BNT162b2 Omi to BNT162b2 for the Omicron variant was achieved based on 
seroresponse rates at 1 month after Dose 4.  The lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI was 
greater than 0%, suggesting higher seroresponse to Omicron variant in BNT 162b2 Omi 
recipients than BNT162b2 recipients. 
•  The GMR (BNT162b2 Omi / BNT162b2) was 1.75 (2-sided 95% CI:  1.39, 2.22). As the 
lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for GMR was not> 1.5, "super" superiority of 
BNT162b2 Omi to BNT162b2 for the Omicron variant was not achieved at 1 month after 
Dose 4 based on the prespecified criterion. 
Substudy E of C4591031  is a randomized, observer-blinded substudy to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, and immunogenicity of high-dose BNT162b2 (60 µg),  high-dose BNT162b2 
Omi (60 µg),  and a high-dose combination ofBNT162b2 and BNT162b2 Omi at 60 µg  (30 
µg  each), given as a single dose.  Participants in two age groups;  18 to 55 years and >55 
years of age who have received 3 prior doses ofBNT162b2 (30-µg  doses), with the most 
recent dose being 5 to  12 months (150 to 360 days) prior to randomization. Participants >55 
years of age were randomized at a ratio of 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1 to receive BNTl 62b2 at 30 µg, 
BNT162b2 at 60 µg,  BNT162b2 Omi at 30 µg,  BNT162b2 Omi at 60 µg,  a combination of 
BNT162b2 and BNT162b2 Omi at 30 µg  (15  µg  each), or a combination ofBNT162b2 and

BNT162b2 Omi at 60 µg  (30 µg  each) as a fourth dose.  Participants 18 to 55 years of age 
were randomized to receive bivalent BNT162b2 and BNT162b2 Omi at 60 µg  (30 µg  each), 
bivalent BNT162b2 and BNT162b2 Omi at 30 µg  (15  µg  each), or BNT162b2 Omi at 60 µg 
as a fourth dose. 
Individuals >55 Years of Age (Study C4591031  Substudy E) 
For the primary and secondary immunogenicity analyses for the Omicron variant, BNT162b2 
Omi 30 µg  and 60 µg  and the BNT162b2 +BNT162b2 Omi 30 µg  and 60 µg  groups met the 
prespecified criteria for superiority with respect to GMR and noninferiority with respect to 
seroresponse rate when compared to BNT162b2 30 µg  group, when administered to 
BNT162b2-experienced participants as  fourth dose. 
• 
'Simple' superiority ofBNT162b2 Omi 60 µg,  bivalent BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 Omi 60 
µg,  and bivalent BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 Omi 30 µg  to BNT162b2 30 µg  were met, as 
the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for GMR was > 1 for each of the three 
compansons. 
•  Noninferiority based on seroresponse for BNT162b2 Omi 60 µg,  bivalent BNT162b2 + 
BNT162b2 Omi 60 µg,  and bivalent BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 Omi 30 µg  to BNT162b2 
30 µg  were met, as the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in 
percentages of participants with seroresponse is >-5% for each of the three comparisons. 
Although not formally claimed due to multiplicity, monovalent Omicron-modified 
vaccine BNT162b2 Omi 30 µg  also had lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the 
difference in percentages of participants with seroresponse (>-5%) consistent with 
noninferiority criterion . 
• 
"Super" superiority ofBNT162b2 Omi 60 µg  to BNT162b2 30 µg  for the Omicron 
variant was achieved based on the prespecified criterion, as the lower bound of the 2-
sided 95% CI for GMR was> 1.5. Although not formally claimed due to multiplicity, 
monovalent Omicron-modified vaccine BNT162b2 Omi 30 µg  also had GMR and lower 
bound of 95% CI (> 1.5) consistent with the super superiority criterion . 
•  Noninferiority for reference strain based on the GMR was met in both bivalent vaccine 
groups (BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 Omi 30 µg  and 60 µg)  as the lower limit of the 2-sided 
95% CI for the GMR is greater than 0.67 (1.5-fold criterion). 
•  Overall, for all BNT162b2, BNT162b2 Omi and BNT162b2 Omi + BNT162b2 
recipients, there were no clinically meaningful differences between subgroups for 
neutralizing GMTs and seroresponse rates, for the Omicron variant except for baseline 
SARS-Co V-2 status. GMTs at 1 month-post-dose were substantially higher while 
seroresponse rates were generally lower for participants who were baseline positive 
compared to those who were baseline negative for SARS-Co V-2.

vaccination, the GMTs for Omicron BA.1 neutralizing titers across all vaccine groups 
evaluated were higher when compared to participants >55 years of age: 
•  The ratio of GMTs for participants 18 through 55 years of age in the bivalent BNT162b2 
+ BNT162b2 Omi 30 µg,  bivalent BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 Omi 60 µg  and monovalent 
BNT162b2 Omi 60 µg  groups, respectively, to participants >55 years of age in the 
bivalent BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 Omi 30 µg  was 1.47 (2-sided 95% CI:  1.11, 1.94), 1.68 
(2-sided 95% CI:  1.26, 2.25), and 3.34 (2-sided 95% CI:  2.50, 4.46), respectively. GMRs 
for the reference strain were also > 1 for all vaccine groups. 
•  Seroresponse rates to the Omicron BA.1  variant for participants 18 through 55 years of 
age were 87.6%, 88.5%, and 95.6% in the bivalent BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 Omi 30 µg, 
bivalent BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 Omi 60 µg  and monovalent BNT162b2 Omi 60 µg 
groups, respectively. The difference in percentages of participants 18 through 55 years of 
age with seroresponse to Omicron BA.1  variant in the bivalent BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 
Omi 30 µg,  bivalent BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 Omi 60 µg  and monovalent BNT162b2 
Omi 60 µg  groups, respectively compared with participants >55 years of age in the 
bivalent BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 Omi 30 µg  group was 20.7% (2-sided 95% CI:  9.8%, 
31.3%), 21.5% (2-sided 95% CI:  10.7%, 32.0%) and 28.6% (2-sided 95% CI:  18.9%, 
38.4%), respectively.  Seroresponse rates for reference strain were similarly high for all 
vaccme groups. 
•  GMTs were substantially elevated over levels observed before study vaccination for 
Omicron BA.1  in the bivalent BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 Omi 30 µg  group (1245.3 and 
80.9, respectively), while GMTs in participants >55 years of age in the bivalent 
BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 Omi 30 µg  group at 1-month post-dose compared with 
prevaccination were 846.9 and 107.1, respectively. The monovalent BNT162b2 Omi 
60 µg  showed the highest response against Omicron BA.1  (increased from  114.9 to 
2828.3) followed by the bivalent BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 Omi 60 µg  group (increased 
from 83.2 to 1424.7). GMTs were also substantially elevated over levels observed before 
study vaccination for the reference strain, across all vaccine groups. 
•  The GMFRs from study vaccination to 1 month post dose for the Omicron BA.1  variant 
were higher for the bivalent BNT162b2 +BNT162b2 Omi 30 µg  (15.4 [2-sided 95% CI: 
12.4, 19.2]), bivalent BNT162b2 +BNT162b2 Omi 60 µg  (17.1  [2-sided 95% CI:  13.7, 
21.4]) and monovalent BNT162b2 Omi 60 µg  (24.6 [2-sided 95% CI:  19.3, 31.4]) 
compared to participants >55 years of age in the bivalent BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 Omi 
30 µg  group (7.9 [2-sided 95% CI:  6.2,  10.2]). In participants 18 to 55 years of age, 
monovalent BNT162b2 Omi 60 µg  showed the highest Omicron BA.1  GMFR compared 
to bivalent vaccines at either dose level. GMFRs from study vaccination to  1 month post 
vaccination against the reference strain were high for participants 18 through 55 years of 
age across all vaccine groups than participants >55 years of age in the bivalent 
BNTl 62b2 + BNTl 62b2 Omi 30 µg  group. 
•  The proportion of participants 18 through 55 years of age who achieved seroresponse in 
SARS-Co V-2 50% neutralizing titers at  I-month post-dose for the Omicron BA. I variant 
was 87.6%, 88.5% and 95.6% in the bivalent BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 Omi 30 µg,

groups, respectively. Proportion of participants achieving seroresponse for reference 
strain were similarly high for all vaccine groups. 
Analysis of immunogenicity data from C4591031  Substudy E demonstrated a robust vaccine 
elicited immune response to both monovalent and bivalent Omicron BA. I-modified vaccines 
when administered as a booster ( dose 4) to BNT 162b2-experienced participants 18 through 
55 years of age. In vaccine-experienced individuals, a booster dose elicited robust 
neutralization titers to Omicron BA. I and the reference strain. 
17.1.2. Clinical Study Data in Children 5 Through <12 Years of Age 
Efficacy and immunogenicity after 2 doses 
Study C4591007 is a Phase 1/2/3 study comprised of an open-label vaccine dose-finding 
portion (Phase  1) and a multicenter, multinational, randomized, saline placebo-controlled, 
observer-blind efficacy portion (Phase 2/3) that has enrolled participants 5 through <12 years 
of age. 
An initial descriptive efficacy analysis of Study C4591007 was performed in 1968 children 5 
through <12 years of age without evidence of infection prior to 7 days after dose 2.  This 
analysis evaluated confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 cases accrued up to a data cut-off date 
of 08 October 2021.97 
The descriptive vaccine efficacy results in children 5 through <12 years of age without 
evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection are presented in Table 63. None of the cases 
accrued met criteria for severe COVID-19 or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in 
children (MIS-C).  No cases of COVID-19 were observed in either the vaccine group or the 
placebo group in participants with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.96

Note: Confirmed cases were determined by Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and at least 
1 symptom consistent with COVID-19 (symptoms included: fever; new or increased cough; new or increased 
shortness of breath; chills; new or increased muscle pain; new loss of taste or smell; sore throat; diarrhea; vomiting). 
Participants who had no evidence of past SARS-Co V-2 infection (i.e., N-binding antibody [serum] negative at 
* 
Visit 1 and SARS-CoV-2 not detected by NAAT [nasal swab] at Visits 1 and 2), and had negative NAAT (nasal 
swab) at any unscheduled visit prior to 7 days after dose 2 were included in the analysis.

c.  Total surveillance time in 1,000 person-years for the given endpoint across all participants within each group at

surveillance period. 
d. 
n2 = Number of participants at risk for the endpoint. 
A formal efficacy analysis to assess the secondary vaccine efficacy hypotheses was also 
performed, as the required number of SARS-Co V-2 cases for hypotheses testing has been 
accrued. In the evaluable efficacy (2-dose) population without evidence of SARS-Co V-2 
infection prior to 7 days after dose 2, the observed VE was 88.2% (2-sided 95% CI:  76.2%, 
94.7%) for first COVID-19 cases confirmed from ~7 days after dose 2 to before dose 3 
through the blinded follow-up period.  This VE is consistent with the primary series results of 
previous studies ofBNT162b2 in adolescent and adult populations. Importantly, while 
participants were randomized 2:1  to BNT162b2 or placebo, there were fewer (10 versus 42) 
first cases confirmed in the BNT162b2 group than in the placebo group.  Notably, most of 
the COVID-19 cases in this VE analysis accrued from Summer to Autumn 2021, during a 
time that the highly transmissible Delta variant was circulating in the US and globally.  This 
was confirmed by next-generation sequencing which showed that the majority of cases in the 
BNT162b2 and placebo groups were of the Delta variant lineage.  Among the small number 
of participants who were unblinded in late December 2021  or later, few Omicron variant 
cases were identified in the BNT162b2 and placebo groups.  This is notable because this VE 
analysis captures only the earliest stages of the first global Omicron variant wave. 
Among confirmed COVID-19 cases, it was more common (31.0% versus 20.0%) for 
participants in the placebo group to report ~4 signs and symptoms of COVID-19 than those 
in the BNT162b2 group. New or increased cough, fever,  and sore throat were commonly 
reported (greater than 46.2% overall) among cases in both the BNT l 62b2 and placebo 
groups. In contrast, new or increased muscle pain was much more common (28.6% versus 
0%) in the placebo group compared to the BNT162b2 group.

Subgroup analyses identified no clinically meaningful differences in efficacy parameters; 
however, some subgroups had small sample sizes in the study population, so caution is 
warranted in extrapolating these efficacy findings to all demographic subgroups. 
Taken together, these results indicate that a 2-dose series of BNT162b2 10 µgin children 5 to 
12 years of age provided protection against COVID-19 during the peak of the global Delta 
variant wave. 
An analysis of SARS-Co V-2 50% neutralising titers (NT50)  1 month after dose 2 in a 
randomly selected subset of participants, demonstrated effectiveness by immunobridging of 
immune responses comparing children 5 through less <12 years of age in the Phase 2/3 part 
of Study C4591007 to participants 16 through 25 years of age in the Phase 2/3 part of Study 
C4591007 who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS-Co V-2 infection up 
to 1 month after dose 2, meeting the prespecified immunobridging criteria for both the GMR 
and the seroresponse difference with seroresponse defined as achieving at least 4-fold rise in 
SARS-CoV-2 NT50 from baseline (before dose  1). 
The ratio of the SARS-CoV-2 NT50 in children 5 through <12 years of age to that of young 
adults 16 to 25 years of age was 1.04 (2-sided 95% CI:  0.93,  1.18), as presented in

Reporting Period 
19 December 2022 through 18 June 2023 
•  The GMR for participants with available titers at I-month post-dose 3 compared to those 
with available titers at  I-month post-dose 2 was 2.17 (2-sided 95% CI:  1. 76, 2.68). 
•  The observed proportion of participants who achieved seroresponse (ie, ~4-fold rise in 
SARS-Co V-2 neutralizing titers from pre-dose  1, or ~4 x  LLOQ for a pre-dose 1 
measurement <LLOQ) was high (100.0%) at  I-month post-dose 2, waned by pre-dose 3 
(77.6%), and was increased at 1 month after dose 3 (98.5%). The difference in 
seroresponse rates at I -month post-dose 3 compared with at  I-month post-dose 2 
was -1.5% (2-sided 95% CI:  -8.0%, 2.4%). 
Additionally, based on the FFRNT (a supportive assay), a third (booster) dose ofBNT162b2 
10-µg elicited neutralizing titers against a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant and 
recombinant wild-type (reference) strain of SARS-CoV-2 in an evaluable immunogenicity 
population of29 children 5 to <12 years of age who were without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 
infection. 
•  The observed I -month post-dose 2, neutralizing GMTs for the Omicron variant and 
reference strain were 27.6 and 323.8, respectively which increased at I-month post-dose 
3 to 614.4 and 1702.8 and, respectively, representing an increase from post-two-dose 
primary series to post-booster vaccination of 22-fold for Omicron and 5-fold for the 
reference strain. 
•  The GMR of neutralizing titers against Omicron versus the reference strain at  I-month 
post-dose 2 was 0.09 (2-sided 95% CI:  0.07, 0.10) and increased to 0.36 (2-sided 95% CI: 
0.28, 0.47) at  I-month post-dose 3, representing a fold-rise from  I-month post-dose 2 to 
I-month post-dose 3 that was 4-times higher for the Omicron titers than for the reference 
strain titers obtained in the FFRNT assay. 
The immune response associated with a booster (third) dose ofBNT162b2 10 µg 
administered approximately 6 months after the second dose to children 5 to <12 years of age 
is expected to confer protection against COVID-19 including disease caused by Omicron. 
This is in the context of previously observed immunogenicity and efficacy results across 
paediatric, adolescent, and adult populations in the clinical development program and 
available real-world data, which have collectively shown that a booster (third) dose of 
BNT162b2 substantially increases the magnitude and breadth of neutralization and provides 
protection against symptomatic SARS-Co V-2 infection caused by variants including 
Omicron. 
17.1.3. Clinical Study Data in Children 6 Months Through <5 Years of Age 
Study C4591007 is the ongoing, randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase  1/2/3 paediatric 
study in healthy children from 6 months to <12 years of age.  The paediatric vaccination 
series for children 6 months to <5 years of age was initially planned as a two-dose series 
given 3 weeks apart.  The Phase 2/3 primary immunogenicity objective in children from 6 
months to <5 years of age was immunobridging the immune responses against SARS-Co V-2 
wild-type strain from children 2 to <5  years and 6 months to <2 years of age in Study 
C4591007 compared to young adults 16 to 25 years of age in the Phase 3 efficacy Study 
C4591001. Immunobridging data after dose 2 met success criteria for the 6 months to <2

years group and did not meet GMR success criteria (but met seroresponse criteria) for the 2 
to <5 years of group, compared to young adults  16 to 25 years of age. 
Immunogenicity after 3 doses 
Given emerging real-world data in the Omicron wave that two-dose protection against 
symptomatic infection was only modest, a third dose was evaluated for children <5 years of 
age. Immunobridging data after dose 3 met success criteria for the 6 months to <5  years age 
group, compared to young adults  16 to 25 years of age. 
Immunobridging (i.e., effectiveness) data were analysed from approximately 4500 children 
across the 6 months to <5  years of age groups who were randomized 2: 1 to receive three 
doses of BNTl 62b2 3 µg or placebo with median follow-up of approximately 2 months after 
dose 3 (inclusive of blinded and open-label periods). 
Immunobridging Results 
Immunobridging success criteria were met for both age groups, comparing the GMR and 
seroresponse for each C4591007 group who received three doses ofBNT162b2 3-µg to 
adults 16 to 25 years of age in C4591001  who received two doses ofBNT162b2 30-µg. Note, 
the CI lower bounds of the GMRs were ~1, indicating statistical significance. 
•  For children 2 to <5 years of age, the GMR for titers at 1-month post-dose 3 of 
BNT 162b2 3 µg compared to young adults 16 to 25 years of age at 1-month post-dose 2 
ofBNT162b2 30 µg,  all of whom were without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, 
was  1.30 (2-sided 95% CI:  1.13, 1.50) and the difference in proportions who achieved 
seroresponse was 1.2% (2-sided 95% CI:  -1.5%, 4.2%). 
•  For children 6 months to <2 years of age, the GMR for titers at 1-month post-dose 3 of 
BNT 162b2 3 µg compared to young adults 16 to 25 years of age at 1-month post-dose 2 
ofBNT162b2 30 µg,  all of whom were without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, 
was  1.19 (2-sided 95% CI:  1.00, 1.42) and the difference in proportions who achieved 
seroresponse was 1.2% (2-sided 95% CI:  -3.4%, 4.2%). 
Wild-type Strain SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization 
Three doses ofBNT162b2 elicited robust immune responses to wild-type SARS-CoV-2 in 
children who received 3-µg doses and in young adults who received 30-µg doses. 
•  For children 2 to <5 years of age without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, the 
observed GMT before vaccination (20.7) was increased prior to dose 3 (401.1) and then 
substantially increased at 1-month post-dose 3 (1535.2). The GMFR at 1-month post 
dose 3 was 73.3  and the seroresponse rate was  100%. 
•  For children 6 months to <2 years of age without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 
infection, the observed GMT before vaccination (20.8) was increased prior to dose 3 
(317 .0) and was substantially increased at 1-month post-dose 3 (1406.5). The GMFR at 
1-month post-dose 3 was 68.4 and the seroresponse rate was  100%.

Reporting Period 
19 December 2022 through 18 June 2023 
Patterns observed for children in wild-type SARS-Co V-2 neutralization at I-month post 
dose 3 were generally comparable to young adults 16 to 25 years of age at  I-month post 
dose 2. 
Omicron Variant SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization 
Three doses ofBNT162b2 increased neutralizing titers to Omicron and Delta variants of 
SARS-CoV-2 in children who received 3-µg doses and in adults who received 30-µg doses. 
•  For children 2 to <5 years of age without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection who 
received three doses ofBNT162b2 3-µg,  FFRNT assay results showed neutralizing titers 
against a recombinant Omicron variant increased from before dose 3 (14.0) to  I-month 
post-dose 3 (82.5). This represents a 5.9-fold increase in Omicron neutralizing titers from 
before dose 3 to  I-month post-dose 3. 
•  For children 6 months to <2 years of age without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 
infection, FFRNT assay results showed neutralizing titers against a recombinant Omicron 
variant increased from before dose 3 (16.3) to  I-month post-dose 3 (127.5). This 
represents a 7.8-fold increase in Omicron neutralizing titers from before dose 3 to 
1-monthpost-dose 3. 
•  Substantial increases in titers against a recombinant Delta variant and a wild-type 
reference strain were also observed after the second and third doses in both paediatric age 
groups. 
Efficacy 
Descriptive efficacy analyses for Phase 2/3  Study C4591007 populations of children 
6 months to <2 years of age were initially based on symptomatic COVID-19 cases accrued 
from dose  1 to a data cutoff date of 29 April 2022 due to the urgency of ensure an available 
vaccine for this age group.  VE was estimated across the total population of participants 6 
months to <5 years of age randomized 2:1  to receive BNT162b2 3-µg vs placebo, which 
included 992 BNT162b2 recipients and 464 placebo recipients who received three doses of 
study intervention.  Based on COVID-19 cases confirmed from at least 7 days post-dose 3 to 
the cutoff date, observed VE was 80.3% (2-sided 95% CI:  13.9%, 96.7%).  Based on cases 
from dose  1 onwards, observed VE was 25.5% (2-sided 95% CI:  7.7%, 39.6%). 
Protocol-specified efficacy analyses for Phase 2/3  Study C4591007 populations of children 
6 months to <5  years of age were based on symptomatic COVID-19 cases accrued from dose 
1 to a data cutoff date of 17 June 2022, with a median follow-up of 2.2 months post-dose 3 of 
the three-dose series.  These analyses were based on all cases confirmed since dose  1 to the 
data cutoff date, and cases confirmed from at least 7 days after dose 3 to the data cutoff date 
among participants without or with or without evidence of prior SARS-Co V-2 infection. 
These analyses were triggered by the protocol objective to evaluate VE after accrual of at 
least 21  confirmed cases across the combined age groups of 2 to <5 years and 6 months to 
<2 years of age who both previously met immunobridging success criteria.

COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (nucleoside modified) 
Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 5 
Reporting Period 
19 December 2022 through 18 June 2023 
Observed Vaccine Efficacy in Population of Children 6 Months to <5 Years 
The per protocol efficacy analysis was based on cases confirmed at least 7 days post-dose 3 
to the data cutoff date of 17 June 2022, observed VE in the dose 3 evaluable population was 
?::72.5%, irrespective of population and/or evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
Post-dose 3 case sequence analysis identified all cases with determinant sequencing results as 
Omicron sublineages, with observed VE of approximately 71 % to 83% against the most 
frequently identified sublineages (BA.2.12.1  and BA.2). Few cases were identified as BA.4 
or BA.5, precluding reliable estimation or meaningful interpretation of VE against these 
sublineages whether considered separately or combined.  Excluding cases involving 
coinfection with other respiratory pathogens did not meaningfully impact observed VE.  This 
notably corresponds to a period of Omicron variant predominance, during which substantial 
infection surges have continued in the US and globally.  This was confirmed by sequencing 
data and analyses showing high VE against Omicron BA.2 and BA.2.12.1  sublineages, at a 
time when BA.4 and BA.5 were just beginning to emerge. 
The overall observed VE for each age group was generally consistent with the combined 
population results. 
The totality of available data indicates vaccinating children 6 months to <5 years of age with 
three doses ofBNT162b2 3-µg affords a high level of protection against symptomatic 
COVID-19 accrued up to a data cutoff date of 17 June 2022 in the evaluable efficacy 
population without evidence of prior infection. 
17.1.4. Real World Data for Omicron Variant 
Omicron-specific VE for the time period 19 December 2022 to  18 June 2023 
The following two real world data studies reported on the effectiveness and durability of the 
original vaccines during periods of Omicron BA.4/5 and XBB dominance, the strains 
predominant during the reporting period. These studies were selected as they provided the 
most recent evidence available for the present reporting period . 
On 15 March 2023, the Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA) Network Open 
published a study by Link-Gelles et al.2 estimating original COVID-19 mRNA vaccine 
effectiveness against illness and severe disease by vaccination status during Omicron BA.4 
and BA.5 sublineage periods. Brand specific effectiveness estimates were not reported.  This 
test negative case-control study was conducted in 10 US states with data from 82,229 
emergency department (ED) and urgent care (UC) encounters and 21,007 hospitalizations 
with COVID-19-like illness and a molecular test for SARS-CoV-2 from 16 December 2021 
to 20 August 2022. Estimated effectiveness of2 doses of original mRNA vaccine against 
hospitalization was 25% (95% CI,  17%-32%) at 150 days or more after vaccination, 68% 
(95% CI, 50%-80%) for a third dose 7 to 119 days after vaccination, and 36% (95% CI, 29%-
42%) for a third dose  120 days or more after vaccination. Among patients aged 65 years or 
older who had received a fourth vaccine dose, VE against hospitalization was 66% (95% CI, 
53%-75%) at 7 to 59 days after vaccination and 57% (95% CI, 44%-66%) at 60 days or more 
after vaccination. Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, ICU admission or in 
hospital death occurred in 21.4% of patients during the BA.I period vs  14.7% during the

BA.4 and BA.5 period (standardized mean difference: 0.17). In this study, VE associated 
with protection against medically attended COVID-19 illness was lower with increasing time 
since last dose and estimated VE was higher after receipt of 1 or 2 booster doses compared 
with a primary series alone. 
On 6 June 2023, Wee et al. 3 reported in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases a study of 
long-term real-world protection afforded by third mRNA doses against symptomatic SARS 
Co V-2 infections, COVID-19-related emergency attendances and hospitalizations amongst 
Singaporeans aged 60 years and over during an Omicron XBB wave. The study reported on a 
population-based cohort that included all Singaporeans aged 2::60 years with no documented 
prior SARS-Co V-2 infection who had previously received 3 or more doses of original 
mRNA vaccines, over a 4-month period during transmission of Omicron XBB. 506,856 
boosted adults were included, contributing 55,846,165 person-days of observation. The 
authors reported adjusted incidence-rate-ratio (IRR) for symptomatic infections, ED 
attendances and hospitalizations at different time-intervals from both first and second 
boosters, using Poisson regression; with the reference group being those who received their 
first booster 90 to 179 days prior. Brand specific effectiveness estimates were not reported. 
Protection against symptomatic infections among those who received a third vaccine dose 
(first booster) waned after 180 days with increasing adjusted IRRs. Adjusted IRR against 
symptomatic infection at 2::360 days following third vaccine dose was 1.45 (95% CI,  1.33 to 
1.57). However, protection against ED attendances and hospitalizations did not wane, with 
comparable or lower adjusted IRRs with increasing time from third vaccine doses. Adjusted 
IRR against ED attendance and hospitalization 2::360 days from third dose was 0.73 (95% CI: 
0.62-0.85) and 0.58 (95% CI:  0.49 - 0.70), respectively. This study shows the effectiveness 
of a booster dose in reducing ED attendances and hospitalizations amongst older adults aged 
2::60 years with no documented prior SARS-Co V-2 infection, during an Omicron XBB wave; 
up to and beyond 360 days post-booster. 
17 .2. Newly Identified Information on Efficacy and Effectiveness 
17.2.1. Clinical Study Data for Omicron-Adapted Vaccines in Individuals 2:12 Years of 
Age 
Individuals >12 Years of Age (Study C4591044) 
Analysis of immunogenicity data at 1 month post study vaccination from Study C4591044 
Cohort 2 and Cohort 2 and 3 combined for BNT 162b2-experienced participants > 12 years of 
age who received a booster (dose 4) ofBNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/Omi BA.4/BA.5) 30 µg or 
60 µg  demonstrated a robust vaccine-elicited immune response. 
These data show that a booster (dose 4) dose ofBNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/Omi BA.4/BA.5) 
30 µg  or 60 µg  elicited higher Omicron BA.4/BA.5 specific neutralization titers at 1 month 
after study vaccination in both age groups of 18 to 55  and >55 years compared with 
comparator groups ofBNT162b2-experienced participants 18 to 55 years and >55 years of 
age from C4591031  Substudy E who received a booster (dose 4) dose ofBNT162b2 Bivalent 
(WT/Omi BA.I) 30 µg vaccine.

COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (nucleoside modified) 
Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 5 
Reporting Period 
19 December 2022 through 18 June 2023 
Increased neutralizing responses with the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/Omi BA.4/BA.5) 
vaccine and the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/Omi BA.I) vaccine were observed regardless of 
baseline SARS-Co V-2 infection status, with the greatest GMFRs observed in participants 
without prior infection and the higher titers observed in participants with prior infection. 
Within baseline positive or baseline negative groups, anti-Omicron BA.4/BA.5 and anti 
reference strain neutralizing titers were higher in participants 12 through 17 years of age in 
the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/Omi BA.4/BA.5) 30 µg  compared with other age and vaccine 
groups at both prevaccination and 1 month after vaccination. 
Superiority ofBNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/Omi BA.4/BA.5) 30 µg  to BNT162b2 30 µgin the 
>55-year age group from C4591031  Substudy E was met with respect to anti-Omicron 
BA.4/BA.5 neutralizing titers. Noninferiority based on Omi BA.4/BA.5 seroresponse and 
anti-reference strain immune response based on GMR was also met in the >55 years of age 
group. 
Noninferiority of the anti-Omicron BA.4/BA.5 response based on GMR and seroresponse for 
BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/Omi BA.4/BA.5) 30 µg  participants 18 through 55 years of age to 
participants >55 years of age in the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/Omi BA.4/BA.5) 30 µg  were 
also met. 
Immune response against Omicron BA.4/BA.5 was higher in all age groups (18 through 55 
and >55  years) when compared to control groups from Study C4591031  Substudy E who 
received BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/Omi BA.I) vaccine, with a substantially larger increase in 
baseline negative participants. Immune responses against the Omicron BA. I and the 
reference strain were comparable for both bivalent vaccines in baseline positive participants, 
and a trend of higher increases for baseline negative participants was observed in participants 
who received BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/Omi BA.4/BA.5). Immune responses against 
Omicron sublineages (BA.4.6, BA.2.75.2 and BQ.1.1) were also higher compared to 
BNTl 62b2 vaccine. Immune responses against Omicron XBB were limited. 
In summary, these data indicate the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/Omi BA.4/BA.5) vaccine is 
more immunogenic against circulating Omicron sublineages and suggest that vaccines 
containing contemporary versions of SARS-Co V-2 may provide increased protection against 
COVID-19. 
17 .2.2. Clinical Study Data in Children 5 Through <12 Years of Age 
Analysis ofimmunogenicity data from C4591048 Group 2 for BNT162b2-experienced (i.e., 
they had 3 prior doses of 10 µg original BNT 162b2, with the last dose being 90 to 240 days 
before enrollment) participants 2:5  years to <12 years of age who received a booster (Dose 4) 
with BNT162b2 Bivalent (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) 10 µg  indicated a robust immune 
response against Omicron BA.4/BA.5. Immune responses against Omicron BA.4/BA.5 were 
generally similar to that of the comparator group, Study C4591007 participants of the same 
age who received a third dose of the original BNT162b2 vaccine. Immune responses against 
the reference strain were also comparable for the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi 
BA.4/BA.5) and BNT162b2 groups .

COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (nucleoside modified) 
Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 5 
Reporting Period 
19 December 2022 through 18 June 2023 
The relative magnitude of the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 immune response after Dose 3 of original 
BNT162b2 is unexpected and may reflect differences in natural exposure and dose intervals 
between the 2 groups (5.5 months [range 3.5-8.5 months] vs 6.5 months [range 6.3-7.6 
months]  for BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) dose interval between Dose 3 and Dose 4 
and BNT162b2 dose interval between Dose 2 and Dose 3, respectively). As this analysis did 
not compare 2 contemporaneous randomized groups, there may have been an imbalance 
between the 2 groups in some measurable or non-measurable factors. 
Based on the descriptive immunogenicity and safety data up to  1 month after vaccination 
with bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) in Study C4591048 participants ~5 
years to < 12 years of age, the 10-µg bivalent booster (Dose 4) with the bivalent BNT 162b2 
(Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) vaccine has a favourable benefit-risk profile in this population. 
17.2.3. Clinical Study Data in Children 6 Months Through <5 Years of Age 
Based on the  I-month post dose immunogenicity data in the 60 participants (~6 months to 
<5 years of age) and new variants of concern neutralization data in 31  participants (~6 
months to <5 years of age) from C459 l 048 Substudy B Group 2 for BNT l 62b2-experienced 
(i.e., they had 3 prior doses of 3 µg  original BNTl 62b2, with the last dose being 60 to 240 
days before emollment), the 3-µg  dose of the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) 
vaccine elicited a robust immune response. 
Analysis of immunogenicity data at 1 month after study vaccination in the evaluable 
immunogenicity population with or without evidence of infection for participants ~6 months 
to <5 years of age who received a fourth dose of bivalent BNT162b2 at 3 µg  demonstrated a 
higher vaccine-elicited immune response against Omicron BA.4/5 compared to a subset of 
participants ~6 months to <5  years of age in the C459 l 048  Substudy B Group 2 who 
received 3 prior doses ofBNT162b2 at 3 µg. 
Overall, as previously observed in adults the postvaccination Omicron XBB.1.5 and BQ.1.1 
neutralization titers were reduced compared with the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 neutralization 
titers. The reduced difference in Omicron XBB.1.5 neutralizing titers among baseline 
negative participants who received the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) 
vaccine compared with those that received the original BNT162b2 suggests that the 
advantage of the bivalent vaccine as the fourth dose may diminish as the variant becomes 
more distant. Overall, the collective data reinforce the importance of a bivalent booster dose 
in this pediatric age group and deploying vaccines that are closely matched to current 
circulating strains. 
17.2.4. Real World Data for Omicron-Adapted Vaccines 
During the current reporting period, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
published a real-world data study on 26 May 2023 reporting vaccine effectiveness for the 
adapted (bivalent) mRNA vaccines, which was subsequently updated and presented during 
the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting on 23  June 2023. This study 
was identified as the best study describing vaccine effectiveness for the adapted vaccine 
during the reporting period and is summarized below.

COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (nucleoside modified) 
Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 5 
Reporting Period 
19 December 2022 through 18 June 2023 
On 26 May 2023, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a report on updated 
bivalent BA.4/5 mRNA vaccine durability in preventing medically attended COVID-19-
associated illness among adults.4  The study applied a test-negative design on 18,943 and 
66, 141  hospitalized patients with and without immunocompromising conditions, 
respectively, within the VISION network during September 13, 2022-April 21, 2023, across 
five sites in seven states. Brand specific effectiveness estimates were not reported. During the 
first 7-59 days after vaccination, compared with no vaccination, VE for receipt of a bivalent 
vaccine dose was 62% (95% CI:  57%-67%) among adults without immunocompromising 
conditions and 28% (95% CI:  10%--42%) among adults with immunocompromising 
conditions. At 120-179 days after receipt of bivalent dose, VE against hospitalization 
declined to 24% (95  CI:  12%-33%) among adults without immunocompromising conditions 
and 13% (95% CI:  -13%-33%) among adults with immunocompromising conditions. 
Effectiveness of a bivalent booster against critical COVID-19 illness did not show signs of 
waning durability with comparable VE estimates over time among both immunocompetent 
and immunocompromised patients. VE was generally lower for adults with 
immunocompromising conditions. This study showed that a bivalent booster dose provided 
the highest protection, and protection was sustained through at least 179 days against critical 
outcomes, including intensive care unit (ICU) admission or in-hospital death. These data 
support updated recommendations allowing additional optional bivalent COVID-19 vaccine 
doses for certain high-risk populations. 
On 23  June 2023, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published updated data5 on 
vaccine effectiveness of monovalent and bivalent doses from the VISION6 and IVY7 
networks -two large networks of hospitals across  10 and 20 states, respectively. During 
January to May, 2023, a time when Omicron XBB sublineages were the predominant 
circulating virus strain, VISION reported waning VE against hospitalization among 
immunocompetent adults. Adjusted effectiveness of a bivalent BA.4/BA.5 booster against 
hospitalization was 51 % (95% CI:  35%-63%) at 7-89 days after receipt of vaccine dose 
which waned to 20% (95% CI:  7%-32%) at 90-179 days after receiving the vaccine. There 
was no evidence of waning VE against critical illness in immunocompetent adults with VE of 
58% (95% CI:  15%-79%) and 48% (95% CI:  23%-65%) at 7-89 and 90-179 days after 
receiving vaccine, respectively. In the XBB era, data from the IVY network found waning 
VE against hospitalization among immunocompetent adults from 54% (95% CI:  39 to 65) to 
6% (95% CI:  -27 to 30) at 7-59 and 120-179 days after receiving vaccine, respectively. 
Among immunocompromised adults in the VISION network, VE against both hospitalization 
and critical illness were generally lower compared to immunocompetent adults. Among 
immunocompromised adults, adjusted VE at 7-59 days after receiving bivalent vaccine was 
27% (95% CI:  9%--41 %) and 41 % (95% CI:  8%-62%) against hospitalization and critical 
illness respectively. 
Recently, the World Health Organization,8 US Food and Drug Administration,9 and 
European Medicines Agency10  all provided updated guidelines and recommendations for 
SARS-Co V-2 antigen composition for updated COVID-19 vaccines beginning in the fall of 
2023. The WHO and EMA affirm that currently available COVID vaccines, including those 
based on the original virus, continue to provide substantial protection against severe disease 
and death. All three agencies recommended that the SARS-Co V-2 vaccine composition be 
updated to a monovalent COVID-19 vaccine with an XBB-lineage of the Omicron variant

with a preference for XBB.1.5 to ensure cross-reactivity against current dominant and 
emerging strains. 
17 .3. Characterisation of Benefits 
Data in Section 17 .1  demonstrates a high degree of efficacy against symptomatic and severe 
COVID-19 in non-immunocompromised people over 12 years of age, during the period at 
least 7 days following the second dose of vaccine in the pre-Omicron era. Efficacy is evident 
separately and at a similar level in people 12-15 years of age,  16-64 years of age, 65  to 7 4 
years of age and 75  years of age and older.  Efficacy also appears largely independent of risk 
factors (having at least 1 of the CMI categories) and obesity.  Efficacy is also high against 
severe disease after the first dose. The emergence of the Omicron variant, and its 
sublineages, impacted the level of efficacy seen against milder disease; however, protection 
remained strong against severe disease, particularly after booster dose(s). Efficacy has also 
been demonstrated in the 5 to <12 years of age and 6 months to <5 years of age groups. 
Section 17 .2 describes the newly identified information on immunogenicity and effectiveness 
of a booster dose of Omicron-modified vaccines in individuals 2::12  years of age, 5 to <12 
years of age, and 6 months through <5 years of age. 
18. INTEGRATED BENEFIT-RISK ANALYSIS FOR APPROVED INDICATIONS 
18.1. Benefit-Risk Context-Medical Need and Important Alternatives 
BNT162b2 indications are provided in Section l  Introduction. 
Incidence 
COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus labelled as SARS-Co V-2.  The disease first 
emerged in December 2019, when a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause 
was recognised in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. 11  The number of infected cases 
rapidly increased and spread beyond China throughout the world.  On 30 January 2020, the 
WHO declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and thus a 
pandemic. 12 
Estimates of SARS-Co V-2 incidence change rapidly. The MAH obtained incidence and 
prevalence estimates using data from Worldometer, a trusted independent organisation that 
collects COVID-19 data from official reports and publishes current global and 
country-specific statistics online. 13 
As of06 July 2023, the overall number of SARS-CoV-2 cases was over 691  million 
worldwide. 14 
Table 66 shows the cumulative number of cases and deaths as of 06 July 2023  for the US, 
UK, and EU-27 countries.  In the EU and the UK, by 06 July 2023, the total number of 
confirmed cases had accumulated to almost 210 million people, or 408,583 per 1,000,000 
population.  Across countries in the EU, the cumulative number of confirmed cases ranged 
from  172,706 to 670,727 cases per 1,000,000 population.  Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria

virus but remain asymptomatic are less likely to be tested and therefore mild cases are likely 
underreported. 13  Further, as at-home rapid testing kits have become more readily available 15 
and formal testing resources reach capacity due to the Omicron variant, the true estimate of 
cases is expected to be larger than formally reported counts. The numbers should therefore be 
interpreted with caution. While there is limited information on number of cases attributable 
to specific variants, case counts for the majority of months in 2022 through current are likely 
to reflect the Omicron variant, which is currently the predominant strain in many countries, 
including in the US 16 where Omicron XBB.1.5 was responsible for 27.0%, XBB.1.16 was 
responsible for  19.9%, XBB.1.9.2 was responsible for  13.0%, XBB.1.9.1  was responsible for 
11 .4%, and XBB.2.3 was responsible for  10.6% of all SARS-Co V-2 specimens sequenced by 
the CDC during the week ending 24 June 2023. 
The main existing treatment options: 
Through 18 June 2023, other COVID-19 vaccines were authorised17  in the European Union 
including COVID-19 Vaccines (recombinant, adjuvanted) [BIMERVAX (EU/1/22/1709), 
Nuvaxovid (EU/1/21/1618), Valneva vaccine (EU/1/21/1624), and VidPrevtyn Beta 
(EU/1/21/1580)]; COVID-19 vaccine (Ad26.COV2-S [recombinant]) JCOVDEN [previously 
Janssen vaccine (EU/1/20/1525)]; COVID-19 Vaccine (CHADOXI-S [recombinant]) 
Vaxzevria [previously AstraZeneca vaccine (EU/1/21/1529)]; elasomeran [Spikevax 
(EU/1/20/1507)].

mortality and morbidity: 
Symptoms of COVID-19 
The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 vary widely, from asymptomatic infection in 17 to 
45% of patients, across age groups18
21  to critical illness and death.  The rate of asymptomatic 
-
infection decreases with increasing age and long-term care facilities are associated with a 
lower rate of asymptomatic infection when compared to household transmission or other 
healthcare facilities. 21  A meta-analysis has estimated that 46.7% of infections in children are 
asymptomatic. 21  The most common symptoms ofCOVID-19 are fever,  cough, and shortness 
of breath for both children and adults. 22
review, researchers examined 1,140 cases of COVID-19 in children from 23 published 
studies.  They reported that 11 % of cases were asymptomatic. Among symptoms, fever was 
reported in 48%, cough in 37%, and any nasopharyngeal symptom in 22%.24

Progression and Timeline of Severe Disease Requiring Hospitalisation 
Those with severe disease will require hospitalisation to manage their illness. Based on data 
that have been systematically collected for the US by the CDC between 01  August 2020 and 
08 July 2023, there were 6,209, 122 total hospital admissions for patients with confirmed 
COVID-19 in the US. 28  For the week ending 09 July 2023, 0.5 per 100,000 population 
(country range: 0.0-3.1) were hospitalised due to COVID-19 in 7 countries of the EU/BEA 
with available data. 28 
The most common symptoms in patients are fever (42-80%), shortness of breath (35-71 %), 
fatigue (33-62%), cough (77-84%), chills (63%), myalgias (63%), headache (59%), and 
diarrhoea (33%)29
32  COVID-19 patients also commonly experience gustatory disorders 
-
(44%) and olfactory disorders (53%).33  Among unhospitalised children< 18 years of age, 
89% experienced one or more typical symptoms of COVID, including fever,  cough, 
shortness of breath, and 22% experienced all three. 31  Approximately 17% to 40% of those 
34
35 
hospitalised with COVID-19 experience severe symptoms necessitating intensive care30
• 
, 
with 31 % of children hospitalised experiencing severe COVID-19 that necessitates intensive 
care or invasive ventilation or ends in death. Risk factors for severe COVID-19 in 
hospitalised children include presence of a comorbid condition, younger age, and male sex. 36 
More than 75% of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 require supplemental oxygen.37 
Studies early in the pandemic demonstrated that time from onset of illness to ARDS was 
8-12 days and time from onset of illness to ICU admission was 9.5-12 days.25  In 5 countries 
of the EU/BEA with available data, 0.1  per 100,000 population (country range 0.0-0.6) were 
in the ICU due to COVID-19 as of 09 July 2023.28  A meta-analysis found that, of patients 
<19 years of age,  11 % went to the ICU, non-invasive ventilation was administered among 
12%, and 4% required mechanical ventilation. 19  A study of 82 cases in three paediatric 
hospitals noted that older children and those with higher body mass index or multiple 
comorbidities were more likely to receive respiratory support. 38 
Mortalitv 
As of 08 July 2023, there were 1,134,710 deaths reported in the US for all age groups.28  As 
of the week ending on 09 July 2023, the mortality rate was 1.3 per million population 
(country range: 0.0- 7.7) in the EU.28 
Mortality data are also presented from W orldometers, an independent organisation that 
publishes current, reliable COVID-19 statistics online.  The mortality of SARS-Co V-2 
infection is defined as the cumulative number of deaths among detected cases. 
As of08 July 2023, the overall SARS-CoV-2 mortality for the EU+ UK was  1,465,418 
deaths, or 2,853 per 1,000,000 population. Reported mortality among EU countries and the 
UK ranged from  1,115 to 5,615 deaths per 1,000,000 population.  Cyprus, Netherlands, and 
Denmark reported the lowest mortality; Bulgaria, Hungary, and Croatia reported the 
highest. 14

COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (nucleoside modified) 
Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 5 
Reporting Period 
19 December 2022 through 18 June 2023 
In the US, as of 08 July 2023, the mortality was 1,168,414 deaths (3490 per 1,000,000 
population).  Mortality in the US was higher than that of the UK (3322 per 1,000,000). 14 
Overall reported mortality among hospitalised COVID-19 patients varies from 12.8% to 26% 
in the EU and UK and US. 35, 39-41 
Complications of COVID-19 and Post-acute COVID 
Evidence has shown that a range of persistent symptoms can remain long after the acute 
SARS-Co V-2 infection.  This condition has been called long COVID or post-acute COVID 
by some recognised research institutes; a universally accepted definition of long COVID has 
yet to be established. 
Studies have shown that long COVID can affect individuals with COVID-19 across a wide 
spectrum of severity, from those with very mild acute disease to the most severe forms. 
Studies around the world have reported various incidence rates for long COVID with 
different follow-up examination times after the acute infection, including 76% of people at 6 
months, one study reporting 32.6% at 60 days while another reporting 87% at 60 days, and 
96% at 90 days.  Findings are not fully consistent nor comparable across studies, but they do 
show that a substantial proportion of people who have had COVID-19 may develop long 
COVID.42 
Assuming at least 10% ofCOVID-19 survivors develop long COVID, it is estimated that 5 
million people are facing long COVID globally.43 
This illness is poorly understood as it affects COVID-19 survivors at all levels of disease 
severity, even younger adults, children, and those not hospitalised.  While the precise 
definition of long COVID may be lacking, the most common symptoms reported in many 
studies are fatigue and dyspnoea that last for months after acute COVID-19.  Other persistent 
symptoms may include cognitive and mental impairments, chest and joint pains, palpitations, 
myalgia, smell and taste dysfunctions, cough, headache, and gastrointestinal and cardiac 
issues. 
Presently, there is limited literature discussing the possible pathophysiology, risk factors, and 
treatments in long COVID, which the current review aims to address. In brief, long COVID 
may be driven by long-term tissue damage (e.g., lung, brain, and heart) and pathological 
inflammation ( e.g., from viral persistence, immune dysregulation, and autoimmunity). The 
associated risk factors may include female sex, more than five early symptoms, early 
dyspnoea, prior psychiatric disorders, and specific systemic inflammatory or 
pro-inflammatory biomarkers (e.g., elevated D-dimer and CRP values, and low lymphocyte 
count), although more research is required to substantiate such risk factors. 43 
Studies that have evaluated a potential impact of SARS-Co V-2 vaccination on long COVID 
include: 
Ayoubkhani et al. 44  described that a first dose of COVID-19 vaccine was associated with a 
reduction in long COVID symptoms of 12.8% (95% confidence interval -18.6% to -6.6%,

P<0.001), and evidence suggested a sustained improvement after a second dose, with an 
initial 8.8% decrease (95% confidence interval-14.1% to -3.1%, P=0.003) in the odds of 
long COVID, with a subsequent decrease by 0.8% per week (-1.2% to -0.4% per week, 
P<0.001), at least over the median follow-up of 67 days in this study. 
No evidence was found of differences in this relationship by sociodemographic 
characteristics, health related factors, vaccine type, or duration from infection to vaccination. 
Although causality cannot be inferred from this observational evidence, vaccination may 
contribute to a reduction in the population health burden oflong COVID.44 
Furthermore, Kuodi et al. 45  showed that two doses of BNT 162b2 vaccine reduced the risk of 
the most common long COVID symptoms after COVID-19 infection, in a cross-sectional 
study preformed between 15 March 2020-15 November 2021. They found that patients who 
received 2 doses ofBNT162b2 were 54% to 82% less likely to report 7 of the 10 most 
commonly reported symptoms compared with unvaccinated patients (all P<0.04). 
Post COVID has also been described in children. A national survey in the UK found 7-8% of 
children with COVID-19 reported continued symptoms at >12 weeks.46 
Long COVID can appear after mild to severe infections, and after MIS-C. Most common 
symptoms:  similar to adults and include fatigue, headache, insomnia, trouble concentrating, 
muscle and joint pain, and cough. Impact on quality of life: limitations of physical activity, 
feeling distressed about symptoms, mental health challenges, decreased school 
attendance/participation. 
Post-COVID conditions may be less likely to occur after vaccine breakthrough in 
adolescents. 47
48 
' 
Persons who were previously vaccinated were less likely to have symptoms between 12 and 
20 weeks after infection compared to persons who were unvaccinated (OR 0.22; 95% 0.20, 
0.25) with a lower occurrence ofpost-COVID conditions after infection compared to persons 
who were unvaccinated. 47
48 
, 
Further research is needed, but vaccination may contribute to a reduction in the population 
health burden of long COVID. 
18.2. Benefit-Risk Analysis Evaluation 
Based on the safety data presented in Section 16 and the benefits presented in Section 17, this 
section presents an overall qualitative evaluation of the benefit risk analysis of BNT162b2 in 
prevention of COVID-19 infection.  With respect to benefit, the nature, clinical importance, 
duration, efficacy profile, and pharmacokinetic benefits of BNT 162b2 were considered. 
With respect to the risks, data from clinical trials, post-marketing, and literature sources were 
considered as well as important potential and identified risks, if applicable.

Reporting Period

Limitations 
Some limitations of the benefit-risk analysis may include missing information in certain 
special populations and the inherent limitations of the various data sources, as summarised 
below. 
These limitations were considered when evaluating the overall benefit-risk profile of 
BNT162b2. 
Clinical trials: 
a) The participants in clinical trials are a relatively homogeneous group as they all meet study 
inclusion criteria.  Importantly, certain populations may be excluded. 
b) Close monitoring required as part of study participation likely identifies relatively 
common events.  Events that are dose-related and pharmacologically predictable events may 
be distinguished.  However, clinical studies may not be powered to pick up rare safety issues. 
Non-interventional (observational) study data: 
a) There is limited control over patient assessment as patient monitoring and diagnostics are 
per standard of care; no additional clinical monitoring is generally conducted. 
b) Patient specific methodological challenges such as potential biases from patient selection, 
loss of patients through study attrition, and overall patient recall are also inherent limitations. 
Post-marketing data: 
a) Reports originate from multiple sources (consumer and healthcare professional) and they 
can be poorly characterised from a medical perspective. 
b) Limited or incomplete information is common, including indication, medical history, 
concomitant medication use, and reason for reporting as an AE, making it difficult to fully 
characterise events and associated risk factors. 
c) Difficult to contextualise quantitatively, as voluntary and sporadic reporting do not allow 
complete knowledge of total exposure or total number of events ever experienced in the 
exposed population.  These data are generally not suitable to make between-drug 
compansons. 
18.2.1. Benefits 
Please refer to Section 17 Benefit Evaluation. 
18.2.2. Risks 
An assessment of the important identified risks was performed using the following data 
sources: pre-clinical studies, clinical studies, post-marketing experience, and literature as 
applicable. Interval findings are summarised in Table 67.

19. CONCLUSION AND ACTIONS 
Risks have been evaluated in the context of the benefits of the vaccine. Based on the 
available safety and efficacy/effectiveness data from the reporting interval for BNT162b2 
( original and bivalent vaccines Omi BA.1  and BA.4/BA.5), the overall benefit-risk profile of 
BNT162b2 remains favourable.  No further changes to the BNT162b2 RSI or additional risk 
minimisation measures are warranted in addition to those above mentioned. 
The MAH will continue to review the safety of BNT162b2, including all reports of adverse 
experiences and will revise the product documents if an evaluation of the safety data yields 
significant new information .

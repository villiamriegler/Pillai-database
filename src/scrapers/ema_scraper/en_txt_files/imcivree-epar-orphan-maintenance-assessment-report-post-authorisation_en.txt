procedure) 
2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
2.1.  Orphan medicinal product designation 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Product (COMP) opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan 
medicinal product designation in 2019 was based on the following grounds: 
“The sponsor TMC Pharma (EU) Limited submitted on 20 May 2019 an application for designation as an 
orphan medicinal product to the European Medicines Agency for a medicinal product containing 
setmelanotide for treatment of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”). The 
application was submitted on the basis of Article 3(1)(a) first paragraph of Regulation (EC) No 
141/2000 on orphan medicinal products. 
Having examined the application, the COMP considered that the sponsor has established the following: 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing setmelanotide was 
considered justified based on preliminary clinical data showing significant decrease in hyperphagia 
and weight in patient’s with the condition;  
the condition is chronically debilitating due to rod-cone dystrophy which leads to visual impairment 
and blindness. This can be associated with speech and learning difficulties as well as ataxia, renal 
disease and obesity. Less common are diabetes mellitus, congenital heart disease and anosmia;  
the condition was estimated to be affecting 0.2 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, at the 
time the application was made;  
Thus, the requirements under Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products are fulfilled. 
The sponsor has also established that there exists no satisfactory method of treatment in the European 
Union for patients affected by the condition. 
Thus, the requirement under Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products is fulfilled. 
The COMP concludes that the requirements laid down in Article (3)(1) (a) and (b) of Regulation (EC) 
No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products are fulfilled. The COMP therefore recommends the 
designation of this medicinal product, containing setmelanotide as an orphan medicinal product for the 
orphan condition: treatment of Bardet-Biedl syndrome”.

3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
type II variation 
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
The approved therapeutic indication “treatment of obesity and the control of hunger associated with 
genetically confirmed Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) in adults and children 6 years of age and above” 
falls within the scope of the designated orphan condition “Treatment of Bardet Biedl syndrome (BBS)”. 
Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a rare pleiotropic autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in 
as many as 24 different genes, all of which participate in cilia functioning and is therefore considered a 
primary ciliopathy. Extensive research suggests the obesity phenotype in BBS is caused by impaired 
transport of the leptin receptor (LEPR) to the ciliary membrane of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) 
neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons are 
activated by energy surfeits and inhibited by energy deficits. When activated, these cells inhibit food 
intake and facilitate weight loss. Conversely, decreased activity in POMC cells is associated with 
increased food intake and obesity. Under normal conditions, leptin, a hormone predominantly made by 
adipose cells, stimulates firing and gene expression in POMC neurons, promoting the secretion of 
alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH). Alpha-MSH stimulates the melanocortin-4 receptor 
(MC4R) located in the second order neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus 
and results in decreased hunger and weight and increased energy expenditure. Impaired or absent 
LEPR signalling in POMC neurons would be expected to reduce MC4R stimulation in second order 
neurons, resulting in an increase in appetite, reduced metabolic rate, and increased weight.  
Genotype–phenotype correlations are poor which leads to considerable variability in the phenotypic 
expression. The BBS phenotype evolves slowly throughout the first decade of life with the result that 
most patients are diagnosed in late childhood or early adulthood. Features associated with BBS include 
retinopathy (rod-cone dystrophy), obesity, polydactyly, genital abnormalities, renal defects, 
neurocognitive and behavioral impairments, speech deficits, ataxia, and developmental delay.  
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP, see 
EPAR. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
There has been no change to the chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature of the condition 
since the orphan designation in 2019. 
The condition is primarily associated with polydactyly and rod-cone dystrophy which leads to visual 
impairment and blindness. Neurocognitive and behavioral impairments, speech difficulties as well as 
ataxia, renal disease and obesity are also common. Less common are diabetes mellitus, congenital 
heart disease and anosmia. It is noted that the condition is not life-threatening.

Number of people affected or at risk 
At the time of designation, the sponsor’s formal estimate of the prevalence of BBS in the EU was 0.2 
per 10,000. This was mainly based on relevant literature searching up to January 2019 which revealed 
that the most conservative (highest) estimate of BBS prevalence in an EU country (Denmark) was 
1:47,000 (Hjortshøj 2007, Eurostat 2019).  
To reassess the prevalence, the sponsor conducted a new literature search from January 2019 to 
August 2021. New prevalence data were available for 3 of the 30 countries in the European Economic 
Area (EEA), i.e. France [including La Réunion], Italy and Poland, see Table 1.

10,000 persons in the EU for BBS is still considered to be applicable by the COMP and remains well 
below the 5 in 10,000-patient threshold for orphan designation.

Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
There are no approved therapies for treatment of obesity and reduction of hyperphagia in patients with 
BBS.  
The only pharmacologic treatments available are products for general obesity/weight management; 
however, there is limited experience with these therapies in patients with MCR pathway associated 
obesity such as BBS. In general, these therapies have not been successful in early-onset extreme 
genetic obesity as these therapies fail to address the MC4R pathway signalling defect that leads to 
obesity and hyperphagia in these patients.  
The absence of drug therapy and unsuitability of surgical intervention leaves only lifestyle modification 
(i.e., diet and exercise) as available therapeutic interventions for patients with severe obesity. These, 
however, are rarely successful over the short-term and almost never effective in the long-term due to 
the intense drive to eat caused by the absence of satiety signals.  
There are no official guidelines in Europe for the treatment or management of BBS. 
Significant benefit 
Not applicable.

4.  COMP position adopted on 25 July 2022 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Product (COMP) considered that the designated orphan condition 
is “treatment of Bardet Biedl syndrome.”  
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of Bardet Biedl syndrome (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated 
to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be approximately 0.2 in 10,000 persons in the 
European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to relentless hunger and morbid obesity. The condition 
can also be associated with rod-cone dystrophy which leads to visual impairment and blindness, 
speech and learning difficulties as well as ataxia and renal disease. Less common are diabetes 
mellitus, congenital heart disease and anosmia;  
there is, at present, no satisfactory method for the treatment of that has been authorised in the 
European Union for patients affected by the condition.  
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Imcivree, setmelanotide for 
treatment of Bardet Biedl syndrome (EU/3/19/2192) is not removed from the Community Register of 
Orphan Medicinal Products.

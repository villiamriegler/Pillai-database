Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for lutetium (177Lu) chloride, the 
scientific conclusions of the CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on extravasation from the literature and the existing warning on extravasation in 
the summary of product characteristics, and furthermore , considering the risk of radiation nephropathy 
and appropriate methods to detect renal disease from the literature and spontaneous reports, the PRAC 
concluded that the product information of products containing lutetium (177Lu) chloride should be 
amended accordingly. 
Furthermore, in view of available data on pancytopenia and neutropenia from the literature, studies and 
from spontaneous reports including in some cases a close temporal relationship and a plausible 
mechanism of action, and on xerostomia from studies and a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC 
considers a causal relationship with lutetium (177Lu) chloride is established and concluded that the 
product information of products containing lutetium (177Lu) chloride should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for lutetium (177Lu) chloride the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing lutetium (177Lu) chloride is unchanged subject 
to the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

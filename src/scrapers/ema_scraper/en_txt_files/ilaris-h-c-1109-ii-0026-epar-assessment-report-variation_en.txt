2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Canakinumab  (Ilaris)  is  a  recombinant  human  monoclonal  anti-human  antibody  of  the  IgG1/kappa 
isotype  subclass.  It  binds  selectively  and  with  high  affinity,  to  interleukin-1β  (IL-1β)  with  no  cross-
reactivity with IL-1α or the IL-1 receptor antagonist. The  IL-1β-canakinumab  complex cannot bind to 
the IL-1 receptor, rendering the bound IL-1β functionally ineffective. 
Canakinumab is authorized for the treatment of Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS) and 
for the symptomatic treatment of adult patients with frequent gouty arthritis attacks (at least 3 attacks 
in  the  previous  12 months)  in  whom  non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs)  and  colchicine 
are contraindicated, are not tolerated, or do not provide an adequate response, and in whom repeated 
courses of corticosteroids are not appropriate. 
SJIA  (Systemic  juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis)  is  a  serious,  rare  condition  responsible  for  high  childhood 
mortality and severe morbidity, including arthritis, joint deformities and systemic manifestations which 
can lead to severe disabilities. SJIA presents as recurrent systemic symptoms, including spiking fevers, 
rash,  lymphadenopathy,  hepatosplenomegaly,  serositis  and  arthritis.  SJIA  is  associated  with  elevated 
erythrocyte  sedimentation  rate  (ESR),  C-reactive  protein  (CRP)  levels,  and  neutrophil  and  platelet 
counts,  which  reflect  systemic  inflammation.  It  is  often  accompanied  by  anemia  and  elevated 
transaminases (Ravelli and Martini 2007). 
Joint damage is seen within 2 years, up to 50-70% have active arthritis as adults, 30-40% have long-
term  disabilities,  and  25-50%  need  major  surgery  including  joint  replacement  (Hashkes  and  Laxer 
2005).  Standard  therapies  such  as  NSAIDs  (non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs),  methotrexate 
(MTX) and corticosteroids are often insufficient to adequately control disease symptoms. 
High doses of corticosteroids are often necessary to treat and avoid flares. Reduction of steroid use is a 
clinically  meaningful  objective  as  chronic  use  is  associated  with  Cushing  syndrome,  obesity, 
hypertension,  fractures,  cataracts  and  growth  retardation  (Manson,  et  al  2009).  Tocilizumab,  an  IL-6 
receptor antagonist, was recently approved (RoActemra in European Union August 2011), as treatment 
for patients with poor response to NSAIDs and systemic corticosteroids. 
Although  the  underlying  cause  of  SJIA  is  not  yet  clear,  SJIA,  like  CAPS,  is  widely  seen  as  an  auto-
inflammatory condition driven by innate pro-inflammatory cytokines, including the interleukins 1 and 6 
(IL-1 and IL-6). Canakinumab was designed to specifically inhibit IL-1β and investigated to determine 
its  impact  on  fever  and  other  disease  symptoms,  as  well  as  composite  measures  of  clinical  response 
and flares. 
The  current  submission  aims  to  extend  the  indication  of  Canakinumab  to  the  treatment  of  active 
Systemic  Juvenile  Idiopathic  Arthritis  (SJIA)  in  patients  aged  2 years  and  older  who  have  responded 
inadequately  to  previous  therapy  with  non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs)  and  systemic 
corticosteroids. Ilaris can be given as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate. 
Protocol assistance was given from CHMP (EMA Scientific Advice Letter, 2008) on the primary efficacy 
variable  of  the  paediatric  adapted  ACR30  at  15  days  and  was  accepted  as  a  valid  marker  of  reduced 
disease burden.

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
No new non-clinical studies were submitted in this application which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. Additional pharmacology information and an update of the pharmacokinetic data for the specific 
systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis indication relevant for this application are reported below. 
2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
The rationale for neutralizing IL-1β in sJIA is based on literature data. Animal models for sJIA are not 
available  due  to  the  very  specific  and  not  fully  understood  pathophysiology  of  sJIA.  Evidence  for  a 
pivotal  role  of  IL-1β  in  the  pathophysiology  of  sJIA  comes  from  clinical  studies.  Pascual  et  al  (2005) 
demonstrated that sera from sJIA patients induced vast overexpression of IL-1β ex vivo when used to 
stimulate human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Also, this study found IL-1β itself up-regulated in 
peripheral blood from sJIA patients leading to the hypothesis that blockade of IL-1 signalling in these 
patients  may  ameliorate  disease.  Treatment  with  anakinra,  a  recombinant  human  interleukin-1 
receptor antagonist, indeed improved systemic symptoms, such as fever, and joint inflammation. This 
initial  report  was  subsequently  confirmed  in  a  number  of  open  label  and  controlled  studies  using 
anakinra (Zeft et al 2009; Quartier et al 2011). 
The pharmacology data as provided with the marketing authorisation application is also applicable for 
the present application and no new data is considered necessary by the CHMP.  
2.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
A detailed comparison of pharmacokinetics of canakinumab in NHP vs. human adults and sJIA patients 
(see  table  below)  and  an  up-date  of  the  safety  margin  using  systemic  concentration  values  from 
subjects which are representative of the sJIA population (in the table below) is provided.

h Vss = Vd+Vp and was derived from the population estimates of Vd and Vp for a typical sJIA patient: BW= 33 kg, 
Age=9yrs.  Similarly,  T1/2  was  derived  from  formula  T1/2=0.693*Vss/CL,  where  CL  and  Vss  are  population 
estimates from a typical adult sJIA patient [ACZ885 sJIA Modeling Report]. 
n.a. not available or not applicable 
Human  PK  and  total  IL-1β  data  were  described  by  a  population  based  PK-binding  model.  This  model 
was  updated  from  the  original  model  included  in  the  CAPS  submission  with  data  from  sJIA  clinical 
trials, as well as data from gouty arthritis patients and additional new data from RA and CAPS patients. 
The  kinetics  of  canakinumab  and  its  binding  to  IL-1β  is  presented  fully  across  the  age  group  of  sJIA 
population. 
Using  the  population  PK  parameter  values  from  the  PK-binding  model,  canakinumab  concentration-
time profiles were simulated for a typical sJIA patient weighing 33 kg, based on a dosing regimen of 4 
mg/kg every 4 weeks for six months, to ensure that steady state is achieved. The AUC and Cmax from 
the  last  dosing  interval  were  estimated  for  each  subject  in  sJIA  trials,  and  summary  statistics  were 
calculated  for  these  two  exposure  metrics.  The  AUC  from  0-tau  at  steady  state  was  calculated,  and 
divided by tau (dose interval) to obtain the average steady-state (Cavg,ss) concentration.  
The simulated exposure data and exposure multiples were compared to data from the marmoset GLP 
toxicology study (see table below). 
Comparison based on observed canakinumab concentrations in marmosets and predicted steady state 
concentrations  in  sJIA  patients  show  that  plasma  concentrations  that  are  well  tolerated  in  animals 
exceed  62-fold  (Cmax)  and  104-fold  (Cavg)  the  plasma  concentrations  in  paediatric  SJIA  patients, 
treated with up to 4 mg/kg via the subcutaneous route every 4 weeks.

b Parameters in sJIA patients were compared with highest mean (male and female) AUC0-24h,ss/24h and Cmax,ss, 
respectively,  observed  at  150  mg/kg  s.c.  in  13  week  study  in  marmosets  [Study  0470033]  to  calculate  the 
exposure multiple; AUC0-24h was normalized to 24h in marmosets administered ACZ885 twice weekly to get an 
approximate of Cavg; in sJIA patients, average steady-state canakinumab concentration (Cavg,ss) was derived as 
AUCss/tau, where tau depicts 4 week (28 days) dosing frequency. 
c Parameters in sJIA patients were compared with highest mean (male and female) AUC0-96h,ss/96h, observed at 
100 mg/kg i.v. in 26 week study in marmosets [Study 0380070] to calculate the exposure multiple; tau or dosing 
interval is approximately 96h in marmosets administered ACZ885 twice weekly; in sJIA patients, average steady-
state  canakinumab  concentration  (Cavg)  was derived  as AUCss/tau,  where  tau depicts 4 week  (28 days)  dosing 
frequency. 
2.2.4.  Toxicology  
No new additional toxicological investigations were performed and therefore no new data are provided 
in this submission.

2.2.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
According  to  Directive  2001/83/EC  and  Guideline  EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00,  medicinal  products 
consisting  of  substances  occurring  naturally  in  the  environment,  such  as  electrolytes,  vitamins, 
proteins  etc.  do  not  need  to  be  accompanied  by  an  environmental  risk  assessment  because  they  are 
unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. 
2.2.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No  new  non-clinical  studies  were  performed  to  support  this  variation  application  as  the  non-clinical 
data reviewed in the context of the canakinumab initial MAA are applicable for the present application. 
This was considered acceptable by the CHMP.  
Exposure multiples were newly calculated based on up-dated human pharmacokinetic data in children 
with sJIA. The available studies in marmosets provide a sufficiently high exposure multiple to establish 
an adequate safety margin of the proposed s.c. dose of 4 mg/kg canakinumab. 
2.2.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The  non-clinical  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetic  and  toxicity  data  which  were  evaluated  during  the 
initial marketing authorization of canakinumab are considered appropriate to support the proposed use 
of canakinumab in patients with sJIA.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The clinical program to demonstrate efficacy and safety in the target indication and population includes 
2 pivotal, blinded, placebo-controlled phase III studies (Studies G2305 and G2301), 1 phase II dose-
ranging study (Study A2203), and 1 uncontrolled extension study (Study G2301E1). 
Canakinumab  is  approved  in  the  EU  to  treat  CAPS  at  the  dose  of  2  mg/kg  for  patients  with  a  body 
weight  below  40  kg  and  150  mg  for  patients  with  a  bodyweight  above  40  kg  administered 
subcutaneously (s.c.) every 8 weeks. This registration dossier aims to obtain marketing authorization 
of  canakinumab  for  the  treatment  of  active  SJIA  in  patients  aged  2  years  and  above,  at  a 
recommended dose of 4 mg/kg (maximum total single dose of 300 mg) administered subcutaneously 
every 4 weeks. 
The  open-label  repeated  dose  range  finding  study  A2203  was  used  to  define  the  dose  used  in  the 
phase III trials (4 mg/kg). The efficacy of 4 mg/kg every 4 weeks was investigated in two randomized, 
double-blind,  placebo-controlled  pivotal  trials  G2305  and  G2301.  Study  G2305  was  planned  to 
demonstrate the superiority of a single dose of canakinumab 4 mg/kg versus placebo in patients with 
active SJIA. Study G2301 was a 2-part study. Part I (consisting of 4 subparts, Ia-Id) was designed to 
confirm the efficacy of canakinumab 4 mg/kg every 4 weeks seen in G2305 but in an open-label study 
design (Part Ia), and to assess whether canakinumab allows for successful tapering of steroid therapy 
(Part Ic). Part II was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of canakinumab versus placebo in delaying 
the onset of a new flare event in a treatment withdrawal study design. 
Study  G2301E1,  an  open-label  extension  study  to  G2305  and  G2301,  was  planned  to  support  long-
term efficacy.

The combined efficacy data analysis is used to evaluate the 12-week efficacy of canakinumab 4 mg/kg 
given every 4 weeks in canakinumab treatment-naïve patients in various subgroups. 
Furthermore, data from CAPS studies were presented to support safety of canakinumab in a population 
with another auto-inflammatory condition. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.   
Table 3.  Tabular overview of clinical studies  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  of  canakinumab  and  total  IL-1β  kinetics  (free  and  antibody  bound)  have 
been  characterized  in  healthy  subjects  as  well  as  in  various  patient  populations  (including  CAPS, 
asthma, psoriasis and RA patients) in the original CAPS submission, and subsequently in gouty arthritis 
patients.  In  this  submission,  the  PK  of  canakinumab  and  total  IL-1β  kinetics  pertinent  to  the  SJIA 
patients are presented. 
Phase  II  and  III  studies  conducted  primarily  to  determine  the  appropriate  canakinumab  dose  and  to 
establish  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  canakinumab  in  SJIA  patients  also  included  evaluation  of 
canakinumab serum concentrations (studies [A2203], [G2305], [G2301], and [G2301E]).  
The corresponding PK/PD parameters derived from the non-compartmental or compartmental analysis 
are summarized in the table below.

Methods – analysis of data submitted 
The collection of serum samples for canakinumab and IL-1β PK/PD analyses in studies A2203, G2305, 
G2301and G2301E1 was based on sparse sampling approach. The population based PK-binding model 
included  in  the  original  CAPS  submission  was  previously  derived  to  describe  the  PK  of  canakinumab 
and total IL-1β properties. The model was updated to include data from SJIA clinical trials, as well as 
data from other disease population. 
Canakinumab was analyzed in human serum using a specific competitive ELISA method with an LLOQ 
of 200 ng/mL. Total IL-1β was determined in human serum using a sandwich ELISA method based on 
a  commercially  available  kit  (Quantikine-HS  kit  from  R&D  Systems)  with  a  lower  limit  of  detection  of 
0.1 pg/mL. 
The  incidence  of  canakinumab  antibodies  was  evaluated  in  all  SJIA  clinical  studies  and  the  impact  of 
antibodies  on  safety,  efficacy,  and  exposure  was  evaluated.  Anti-canakinumab  antibodies  in  serum 
were  measured  by  surface  plasmon  resonance  spectroscopy  using  the  first  established  and  formerly 
used  Biacore®  binding  assay  in  study  A2203,  and  by  a  recently  developed  more  sensitive 
homogeneous bridging Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) assay in studies G2305, G2301 and G2301E1. 
The PK- efficacy response relationship of canakinumab in SJIA patients was first investigated for Study 
A2203 and was subsequently analysed with data from Phase 3 SJIA studies. PK-safety relationship of 
canakinumab was explored using the data from Phase III studies G2305 and G2301. 
PK Results  
Study A2203 
This  study  was  a  Phase  II,  multi-center,  open  label,  repeat  dose  range  finding  study  to  assess  the 
clinical safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of canakinumab in patients 
with  active  systemic  juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis  (SJIA).  The  study  consisted  of  2  stages,  a  repeated 
single dose escalation in Stage I and a fixed dose re-dosing upon relapse in Stage II. 
In  Stage  I,  a  total  of  23  unique  patients  with  three  patients  being  enrolled  twice  in  different  cohorts 
were randomized to one of 3 starting doses of canakinumab 0.5, 1.5 or 4.5  mg/kg, corresponding to 
cohorts  I,  II  or  III,  respectively.  If  patients  treated  with  first  dose  did  not  show  measureable 
improvement, a second injection of the same dose of canakinumab was administered between Day 3 to 
Day  9.  Patients  who  experience  a  measurable  improvement  were  re-dosed  upon  each  relapse  until 
they  entered  Stage  II  of  the  study.  In  Stage  II,  all  responding  patients  received  a  fixed  dose  of  4 
mg/kg  canakinumab.  During  this  period  corticosteroid  tapering  was  allowed  at  the  discretion  of  the 
investigator  and  according  to  local  medical  practice.  In  Stage  I,  serum  canakinumab  (PK)  and  IL-1β 
(PD)  samples  were  collected  at  baseline  (Day  1)  and  trough  samples  were  taken  pre-dose  during 
treatment  period  on  Days  2,  3,  8,  15,  29,  43,  57,  71,  85,  99,  113,  127,  141  and  155.  Sampling 
continued every two weeks until the last patient from the highest dose cohort completed two cycles of 
remission. No PK or PD samples were taken in Stage II.

The enrolled patients had an average age of 10 years (range: 4 to 19 years). 26 (23 unique subjects, 
plus  3  re-enrolled)  pharmacokinetic  profiles  were  obtained.  5  data  sets  had  missing  data  at  the 
terminal  phase,  therefore non-compartmental  PK  parameters  were  calculated from  21  data  sets  from 
subjects  receiving  canakinumab  dose  ranging  from  0.5  to  9  mg/kg  (see  table  below).  Peak  serum 
concentration of canakinumab (Cmax) per dose group could not be evaluated in most subjects, since 
the majority of them received a second dose within 7 days of the first dose. In the six subjects for who 
only  had  a  single  s.c.  injection  of  canakinumab,  peak  serum  levels  were  reached  in  approximately  2 
days.  Apparent  half-life  following  the  single  s.c.  dose  administration  was  16.7  (SD=5.45)  days. 
Average  apparent  clearance  (CL/F)  of  0.256  (SD=  0.0993)  L/d  and  average  apparent  volume  of 
distribution  (Vz/F)  of  5.94  (SD=2.54)  L  was  reported  for  these  pediatric  patients.  Moderate  inter-
subject variability with a coefficient of variation of approximately 39 % was observed in CL/F.

The summary of mean exposure parameters per dose regimen is shown in the table below. These data 
indicate that there is approximate dose proportionality of Cmax and AUC in this patient population.  
The IL-1β data collected in this study were pooled with data from other canakinumab studies. 
Study G2305 
This  study  was  a  Phase  III  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo  controlled,  single  dose  study  to  assess 
the  efficacy  and  safety  of  canakinumab  in  patients  with  SJIA  and  active  system  manifestation.  The 
primary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  demonstrate  that  the  proportion  of  patients  who  met  the 
adapted ACR Pediatric 30 criteria on Day 15 was higher with canakinumab compared to placebo. 
A total of 84 patients, in  40 centers in 18 countries, with an average age of  9 years (range: 2 to 19 
years) were randomized to treatment (43 to canakinumab and 41 to placebo). Patients were followed 
for  4  weeks,  with  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  (Adapted  ACR  pediatric  30  on  Day  15),  secondary 
efficacy endpoints and safety analysis up to Day 29. 
Patients  received  a  s.c.  injection  of  canakinumab  (4  mg/kg)  or  placebo  on  Day  1.  The  maximal  total 
single  dose  of  canakinumab  allowed  was  300  mg.  Serum  canakinumab  and  IL-1  β  samples  were 
collected at baseline (Day 1), Days 3, 15 and 29 (or Premature Patient Withdrawal (PPW)). PK samples

were also collected in case of flare and in case of an anaphylactic reaction (a sample at the time of the 
event and also 8 weeks later). 
A population pharmacokinetic model with two-compartment disposition and first-order absorption was 
developed  to  characterize  the  PK  properties  of  canakinumab  obtained  from  only  this  study  [G2305] 
population.  The  IL-1β  data  collected  in  this  study  was  pooled  with  data  from  other  canakinumab 
studies.  Since  there  was  only  s.c.  dosing  in  this  study,  the  values  for  Ka  and  F  were  fixed  to  known 
values  for  the  product  types  from  a  previous  model  with  extensive  data  from  all  product  types.  The 
mean (SD) values of individual PK parameter estimated for patients in various age groups (2 to <4, 4 
to <6, 6 to <12, and 12 to <20 years) are shown in the table below. 
The  mean  total  distribution  volume  (Vss)  [Volume  of  distribution  of  the  serum  compartment  (Vc)  + 
Volume of distribution of the tissue compartment (Vp)] in the oldest age group patients (i.e. 12 to <20 
years) was approximately 5.98 L and the mean total serum clearance (CL) was estimated to be 0.219 
L/day. The CL and Vss of  canakinumab were progressively lower as the age in the patient population 
decreased,  as  a  result  that  clearance  and  volume  of  distribution  of  canakinumab  were  a  function  of 
body weight. These results suggested the appropriateness of body weight–based dosing for patients in 
various age groups (2 to < 20). 
Table 6.  Summary of mean (SD) of PK parameters by age group [G2305] 
Study G2301 
G2301  was  a  Phase  III,  multicenter,  two-part  study  with  an  open-label,  single-arm  active  treatment 
(Part  I)  followed  by  a  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  event-driven  withdrawal  design 
(Part II) of canakinumab in patients with SJIA and active system manifestation. 
The  primary  objective  of  the  study  in  Part  I  was  to  assess  if  monthly  canakinumab  4  mg/kg  allowed 
tapering of steroids in at least 25% of patients. The main objective in part II was to demonstrate that 
the time to flare was longer with canakinumab than with placebo. 
In  Part  I,  patients  received  a  single  dose  of  canakinumab  (4  mg/kg)  subcutaneously  (s.c.)  every  4 
weeks.  Part  I  had  four  subparts.  Parts  Ia  and  Ib  aimed  to  induce  and  maintain  at  least  an  ACR30 
response  without  tapering  of  steroids  and  to  ensure  patients  had  8  weeks  canakinumab  treatment 
before  Part  Ic,  which  aimed  to  reduce  steroid  dose  prior  to  entering  Part  II.  Part  Id  was  designed  to 
stabilize patients on an achieved steroid dose for 4 weeks before entering Part II. The planned duration 
of Part I was a maximum of 32 weeks (Part Ia: 4 weeks; Part Ib: 4 weeks; Part Ic: up to 20 weeks; 
Part  Id:  4  weeks).  In  Part  II  (double-blind  withdrawal  period),  patients  were  randomized  to 
canakinumab  or  placebo  in  a  1:1  ratio,  and  received  a  s.c.  injection  of  canakinumab  (4  mg/kg)  or 
placebo  every  4  weeks.  The  study  was  stopped  when  the  required  number  of  37  flare  events  had 
occurred in Part II. 
A  total  of  177  patients,  from  63  centers  in  21  countries,  entered  Part  I  with  an  average  age  of  8.7 
years (range: 1 to 19 years). In Part II, 100 patients (50 patients in canakinumab and 50 patients in 
placebo) with an average age 9.1 years (range: 2 to 19 years) entered the study. Serum canakinumab 
(PK) and IL-1β (PD) samples were collected at baseline (Day 1), Days 3, 15, 29, 57, end of Part Ic (or

Day 197) visit, and end of Part Id (or Day 225) visit, in part I, every 6 months (pre-dose) during part 
II  and  end  of  study  (or  PPW).  PK  samples  were  also  planned  in  case  of  flare  and  in  case  of  an 
anaphylactic reaction (a sample at the time of the event and also 8 weeks later). 
The arithmetic mean trough concentrations (SD) of canakinumab on Day 29, Day 57, end of Part Ic (or 
Day 197) visit, and end of Part Id (or Day 225) visit were 11.29 (5.497), 17.03 (7.928), 20.82 (9.782) 
and  26.84  (9.893)  μg/mL,  respectively.  The  MAH  analyzed  common  subjects  that  had  concentration 
data on Day 197 and 225. The mean±SD canakinumab concentrations for 43 common subjects at Day 
197  and  225  were  similar;  23.4±8.98  μg/ml  (at  day  197)  vs.  23.6±7.33  μg/ml  (at  day  225).  These 
concentrations  show  that  the  steady  state  is  maintained  at  Day  197  and  225.  The  PK  model-based 
analysis  of  these  data  was  performed  separately,  after  pooling  with  data  from  other  canakinumab 
studies.  
Study G2301E1 
G2301E1 was a Phase III, and open label extension to 2 pivotal trials G2305 and G2301. 
The  objective  of  the  study  was  to  assess  the  long-term  safety,  tolerability,  and  immunogenicity  of 
canakinumab in patients with SJIA and active system manifestation. 
Eligible  patients  aged 2  to  <  20  years  with  a  confirmed  diagnosis  of  SJIA  and  who  had  responded to 
canakinumab treatment in studies G2305 and G2301 were enrolled in this extension study to receive 
canakinumab 4 mg/kg every 4 weeks s.c. for up to 2 years. 
An  option  to  receive  a  dose  of  2  mg/kg  every  4  weeks  s.c.  was  available  for  individual  patients  who 
had achieved steroid tapering or who were steroid free. 
A total of 147 patients from 61 centers in 20 countries with an average age of 9.5 years (range: 2 to 
20 years) were enrolled in the study. Serum canakinumab (PK) and IL-1β (PD) samples were collected 
at  baseline  (Day  1),  Days  169,  337,  505,  673  (or  PPW),  every  6  months  (predose)  for  patients  who 
continued  beyond  Day  673.  PK  samples  were  also  planned  in  case  of  flare  and  in  case  of  an 
anaphylactic reaction (a sample at the time of the event and also 8 weeks later). Efficacy was assessed 
every 12 weeks, except for CRP which was measured every 4 weeks. 
The  population  of  patients  entering  G2301E1  was  diverse,  due  to  patients’  prior  study  participation 
status.  To  obtain  a  better  understanding  the  following  subgroups  were  defined  for  analysis:  Group  1 
(G2301 Part II discontinuations), Group 2 (G2301 Part II responders), Group 3 (G2301 Part I steroid 
tapering failures) and Group 4 (all others). 
Mean  trough  concentration  (SD)  at  baseline  was  16.10  (13.80),  34.39  (14.82),  12.67  (8.673)  and 
12.75 (7.552) μg/mL for Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. At week 24, mean trough concentrations 
(SD) were 20.88 (10.05), 20.43 (9.042), 17.13 (11.50) and 19.32 (14.99) μg/mL for Groups 1, 2, 3, 
and 4, respectively. The week 24 values in all groups did not indicate further increase from the values 
observed on Day 197 and 225, reflecting that the steady state is maintained. 
The  PK  model-based  analysis  of  these  data  was  performed  separately,  after  pooling  with  data  from 
other canakinumab studies.  
Population PK analysis 
The definitive assessment of canakinumab pharmacokinetics and IL-1β kinetics was based on the PK-
binding model that included all subjects in SJIA Phase II/III program. 
Objectives 
• 
To  update  the  established  population-based  PK-Binding  model  previously  developed  with 
additional data from SJIA patients pooled from studies A2203, G2305, G2301 and G2301E1

• 
• 
To  describe  the  pharmacokinetics  of  canakinumab  and  its  pharmacodynamics  of  bindings 
to IL-1β in SJIA patients 
To employ model-based simulation to estimate the steady-state exposures of canakinumab for 
SJIA pediatric patients stratified by age group (2-3, 4-5, 6-11, 12-19) and bodyweight (≤ 40 kg, > 40 
to ≤ 70 kg and > 70 kg) 
• 
To  determine  whether  canakinumab  given  4  mg/kg  s.c  every  4  weeks  provides  sufficient 
exposure to prevent flares in SJIA pediatric patients 
Data source 
The  NONMEM  dataset  used  for  the  PK-Binding  model  were  derived  previously  in  the  original  analysis  
but  updated  with  the  additional  SJIA  studies  including  other  disease  populations  (eg,  CAPS,  Gouty 
Arthritis,  Rheumatoid  Arthritis,  Japanese  Healthy  Volunteer,  Non-Japanese  Healthy  Volunteer,  and 
Psoriasis)  totaling  28  clinical  studies  including  their  extensions.  Pooling  of  different  studies  were 
required  to  provide  PK  and  IL-1β  information  for  the  sparsely  sampled  SJIA  studies  to  support 
estimation from the PK-Binding model.  
A separate dataset containing only SJIA pooled studies was created . It contained additional variables 
including  the  records  for  observed  flares  for  which  the  posthoc  estimates  from  the  PK-Binding  model 
will be merged to create a new dataset for simulating steady-state kinetics. 
Covariates: Summary of Demographic data  
A summary of the demographic variables for each SJIA studies are listed in the table below pertaining 
to  specific  covariates  previously  identified  to  affect  the  PK  properties  of  canakinumab  exposure 
[ACZ885 CAPS Modeling Report].

Methods 
The  analysis  was  performed  using  the  NONMEM  software  system,  NONMEM  VI  version  2 
extended/super  extended  (Icon  Development  Solutions,  Ellicott  City,  MD,  USA),  the  NMTRAB 
subroutines  version  III  level  1.1,  and  the  PREDPP  model  library  version  V  level  1.0  utilizing  the 
MODESIM  high  performance  computing  environment  accessed  from  GPSII.  Data  preparation  and 
presentation were performed using SAS® software version 8.2 (SAS Institute Inc) and S-Plus Version 
8.01 (Insightful Corporation). 
A summary of the parameters in the model is listed in the table below:

The table above shows that relatively precise estimate were obtained for PK Binding model fixed effect 
(structural  PK)  parameters.  The  covariate  effect  parameters  were  less  precisely  estimated  which  is

understandable given the relatively small size (sparse samples) of the analysis dataset for SJIA and is 
reflected  with  zero  being  included  in  the  95%  confidence  interval.  Residual  within-patient  error  was 
relatively low for both total canakinumab and total IL-1β (25.7% and 37% CV, respectively), implying 
reasonably high predictability of the model to describe both canakinumab and total IL-1β data.  
The  population  mean  clearance  of  canakinumab  (CLD)  for  a  SJIA  patient  with  body  weight  of  70  kg 
(reference  value)  and  serum  albumin  of  43  mg/mL  (reference  value)  was  0.196±0.01  L/day  which  is 
consistent with the previously reported values across other indications. The volumes of distribution of 
the  central  (VD)  and  peripheral  compartment  (VP)  were  3.63±0.19  L  and  2.64±0.15  L,  respectively. 
The central volume would equate well with that of plasma and the ratio of the central and peripheral 
volumes  suggest  that  approximately  42%  of  the  drug  distributed  from  the  central  compartment  into 
the peripheral space. The typical values for CLD, VD and VP when adjusted to a bodyweight reference 
of  33  kg  was  0.106±0.007  L/day,  1.55±0.091  L  and  1.66±0.095  L,  respectively.  The  estimated 
terminal half-life was 22 days. The time to steady state was approximately 110 days (5 half-lives). The 
degree  of  unexplained  intersubject  variation  in  the  primary  PK  parameters  was  approximately  30  to 
45% for clearance and the two volumes (Table 9-1). 
Covariates  for  the  pharmacokinetic  parameters  were  the  same  as  in  the  previous  model:  bodyweight 
on clearance and the two volumes of distribution, allometrically scaled with weight, plus serum albumin 
on clearance and age on the subcutaneous drug absorption rate, both with a negative exponent.  
In the backward deletion of covariates for albumin and weight on CLD, weight on VD and VP and age 
on  KA  the  significance  of  the  covariates  identified  in  the  population-based  PK-Binding  model  was 
confirmed.  All  covariate-parameter  relationships  were  statistically  significant  (p-value  <  0.0001), 
confirming the importance of these covariates in the population-based PK-Binding model. 
The  final  model  fitted  well  both  the  total  canakinumab  and  the  total  IL-1β  data,  indicating  that  the 
model  assumptions  of  pseudo-equilibrium,  shared  volumes  of  distribution,  and  complex  clearance 
equivalent  to  drug  clearance  were  reasonable.  The  plots  of  the  weighted  residuals  versus  time  and 
versus predicted values were well centered with few outliers. The plots of observed versus population 
average predicted concentrations and versus individual predicted concentrations showed the predicted 
concentrations were uniformly distributed along the line of identity. 
Shrinkage  (Table  9-1)  was  low  for  the  clearance  of  canakinumab  (9.3%)  and  the  rate  of  IL-1β 
production (13.8%), reasonable for IL-1β clearance (26.4%) and the volume of distribution (21.2%). 
It  was  more  than  30%  for  the  binding  constant,  rate  of  absorption,  the  peripheral  volume,  the 
intercompartmental permeability flow (PSD and PSL) for canakinumab and IL-1β, respectively. 
Further  graphical  assessments  by  comparing  the  relationship  between  the  individual  parameters  (eg 
CLD,  VD,  VP,  KA)  and  covariates  in  the  PK-Binding  model  showed  a  general  trend  confirming  age, 
bodyweight  and  albumin  are  influencing  covariates  on  the  PK  of  canakinumab  as  shown  in  the  figure 
below.

Plots of the normalized random effects of those parameters versus the included explored covariates for 
the  final  model  were  well  centered  with  no  obvious  trends  confirming  that  the  relationships  were 
described properly. Potential relationships between PK parameters and continuous covariates (e.g. age, 
weight,  height,  scr)  and  categorical  covariates  (gender,  Race,  Ethnicity)  were  graphically  assessed 
(scatterplots).  No  apparent  relationship  was  evident  for  the  PK  parameters  and  the  other  tested 
covariates. 
Plots  of  the  random  effect  of  the  parameters  in  the  final  model  versus  body  weight,  age,  serum 
albumin, SJIA studies, cell line, race , ethnicity, gender and disease indications showed no trends and 
therefore these covariates were not explored further in the PK-Binding model. 
The  result  of  the  performance  check  demonstrates  that  the  model  is  generally  consistent  with  the 
observed values for SJIA with respect to time. Figure 10-25 represents the 90% prediction interval and 
observed concentration and shows that there was reasonable overall agreement between the nominal 
and expected percentage of observed values outside the 90% prediction interval. Overall, 26% of the 
observed  concentrations  were  outside  the  90%  prediction  interval,  with  19%  falling  below  and  7% 
falling above the interval with a slight over-prediction.

A summary of pharmacokinetic parameters in a typical SJIA patients (typical value at 33 kg and 43 g/L 
albumin)  is  presented  in  Table  3-3.  In  SJIA  patients,  for  a  model  typical  body  weight  of  33  kg  and 
serum albumin of 43 g/L, the estimated serum clearance of canakinumab was 0.106 ± 0.00689 L/day. 
The corresponding volume of distribution at steady state was 3.21 L. The estimated half-life (T1/2) of 
canakinumab  was  22  days.  Serum  clearance  of  canakinumab  and  its  volumes  of  distribution  were 
dependent  on  body  weight  in  an  allometric  relationship.  The  exponent  was  approximately  0.823  ± 
0.0367 for clearance with a formula CLD = 0.106× (BW/33 kg)0.823 (see table below).

Model- based predictions 
Simulated Steady-state Exposure of Canakinumab in SJIA population 
Using the individual post-hoc estimates of the PK parameters (eg, CLD, VD, VP), individual estimates 
of steady-state exposure of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUCss), peak (CMAXss) 
and trough (CMINss) concentrations were simulated using the population based PK-Binding model for 
only  the  SJIA  patients  pooled  from  the  Phase2a  (A2203)  and  Phase3  (G2305,  G2301,  G2301E1) 
studies.  
The  model  prediction  showed  comparable  exposures  across  the  different  age  groups  where  their 
overall average (±SD) for CMINss,  CMAXss and  AUCss were 14.68±8.80 μg/mL, 36.50±14.92 μg/mL 
and 696.09±326.55 µg*day/mL, respectively.

A  higher  median  of  exposure  for  CMINss  (19  versus  11.4  µg/ml)  and  AUCss  (880  versus  594 
µg*day/mL) for the higher bodyweight group (> 40 kg) than lower bodyweight group (≤ 40  kg)  was 
observed.  
Absorption and absolute bioavailability 
After  single  dose  s.c.  administration  of  canakinumab,  peak  serum  levels  were  reached  by 
approximately 2 days.  
The  absolute  bioavailability  of  canakinumab  after  s.c.  administration  was  estimated  using  population 
PK-binding model. The rate and extent of absorption were independently estimated for the 4 product 
types  (see  table  below),  with  product  D  as  the  current  available  marketed  drug.  Bioavailability  and 
absorption rate constants of the product types were similar, ranging from 62-72% and 0.25-0.30 d-1, 
respectively.  The  absolute  bioavailability  of  canakinumab  (mean  ±  SE)  for  Product  Types  A,  B,  C,  D 
were 62.2 ± 3.72, 64.1 ± 3.49, 72.5 ± 3.83, and 68.9 ± 3.65%, respectively. Based on the relative 
bioavailability  of  D/C  of  0.95  ±  0.002  (mean  ±  SEM),  it  can  be  concluded  that  there  is  no  apparent 
difference in the two product types.  
Table 13.  Absorption  rate  and  bioavailability  parameters  for  all  product  types  (mean  ± 
SE) based from their typical values 
The  s.c.  bioavailability  estimates  of  canakinumab  of  approximately  60-70%  is  comparable  to  the 
bioavailability estimates of other IgG monoclonal antibodies. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Canakinumab exhibited dose proportionality in CAPS patients. In Study A2203, sJIA patients received 
s.c.  administration  of  0.5,  1.0,  1.5,  3.0,  4.5  or  9.0  mg/kg  canakinumab  and  PK  parameters  were 
obtained  by  non-compartmental  analysis.  As  shown  in  Figure  3-2,  dose  normalized  AUCinf  values 
remained  unchanged  with  increasing  dose  within  the  dose  range  studied.  Thus,  dose  proportionality 
can also be concluded for the sJIA population. 
Figure 6.  Canakinumab dose proportionality in SJIA patients [A2203] 
There was no indication of changes in canakinumab pharmacokinetic properties over time as supported 
by  the  population  PK-binding  model.  Single  dose  pharmacokinetics  of  canakinumab  in  SJIA  subjects 
was studied in A2203 whereas only sparse samples were collected from multiple dose phase III clinical 
studies. While a direct comparison is not possible, the AUC0-inf value after single dose obtained from 
A2203  study  based  on  fewer  subjects  are  comparable  to  the  steady  state  AUCtau  obtained  from  the

PopPK  analysis.  Figure  3-3  shows  a  plot  of  the  weighted  residuals  versus  time  for  canakinumab 
following multiple dosing from the population PK-binding model, with the assumption of time-invariant 
PK. The values were randomly distributed around zero value and show no directional shift, suggesting 
the time-independent PK assumption in the model is valid. This is consistent with the results reported 
in the original CAPS submission.

Special populations 
Patients versus healthy subjects 
The  pharmacokinetic  parameters  of  canakinumab  in  SJIA  patients  and  from  various  other  patient 
population and healthy subjects were estimated by the PK-binding model. 
The  clearance  of  canakinumab  was  not  overly  impacted  by  patient  population  or  disease.  There  was 
little  difference  between  the  SJIA  clearance  and  that  of  other  patient  populations;  at  most  10-24% 
difference  for  non-Japanese  healthy  volunteer  (slower  clearance)  and  Rheumatoid  Arthritis  (higher 
clearance). 
Gender 
A  total  of  111  female  and  90  male  subjects  were  included  in  SJIA  clinical  studies.  No  gender-related 
difference was observed in any of the PK parameters of canakinumab after correction for body weight. 
Race 
A total of 6 Asians, 9 black, 173 Caucasians and 13 others were included in SJIA clinical studies. While 
the  number  of  patients  from  other  races  was  small,  there  was  no  indication  of  race  effect  on  PK 
parameters. 
Body Weight 
Clearance  is  the  main  parameter  of  interest  as  it  is  the  determinant  of  overall  systemic  exposure 
(AUC=F*DOSE/CL).  It  is  known  that  clearance  increased  with  body  weight  based  on  the  principle  of 
allometry and provides a rational for bodyweight-based dosing to ensure comparable exposures (AUC) 
in patients with broad range of bodyweights.  
Serum clearance of canakinumab and its volumes of distribution were dependent on body weight in an 
allometric relationship. The exponent was approximately 0.823 ± 0.0367 for clearance with a formula 
CLD = 0.106× (BW/33 kg)0.823. 
Canakinumab  clearance  versus  body  weight  relation  has  the  allometric  exponent  of  0.823  (95%  CI: 
0.751 – 0.895), which is less than 1. While the effect of body weight can be eliminated by body weight 
based  dosing  if  the  allometric  exponent  is  equal  to  one,  the  effect  of  body  weight  on  canakinumab 
pharmacokinetics was nonetheless minimized when the dose was given on body weight basis, with only 
Ilaris

a slightly lower body-weight normalized clearance at higher body weight. When stratified by weight, a 
higher exposure was observed for AUCss for the higher bodyweight group (>40 kg) (see figure below). 
However, it must be noted that the range of exposures overlap entirely with each other. 
Figure 8.  Steady-state  exposures  of  canakinumab  for  SJIA  patients  stratified  by 
bodyweight 
Age 
SJIA patients from all four SJIA clinical trials were included to assess the PK exposure across the age 
group of 2- <20 years. Thus the database in the PK-binding model included 201 SJIA patients, out of 
which  24  were  of  age  2-3,  40  subjects  were  age  4-5,  86  were  between  6-11,  and  51  were  12  and 
above. Demographic data for SJIA studies are summarized in the table below. 
Table 14.  Demographic data for SJIA studies 
The key pharmacokinetic parameters such as canakinumab clearance and volume of distribution were 
plotted by age after correction for the subject’s body weight. 
The  body-weight  normalized  canakinumab  clearance  showed  a  slight  trend  when  plotting  versus  age 
across  different  disease  indications  containing  adult  populationor  in  SJIA  pediatric  studies  alone.  No 
significant difference can be found in exposure as represented by AUCss across all the age groups from 
2 to <20 years old, including age group 2 to <4. 
Impaired renal function 
There  were  no  severely  renal  impaired  subjects  included  in  the  SJIA  studies.  Since  canakinumab  is  a 
human IgG immunoglobulin with large molecular size (~150 kDa), little intact immunoglobulin can be 
filtered by the kidney, hence little antibody is expected to be excreted in the urine. 
In CAPS, clearance values of four subjects with moderate to end stage renal insufficiency were similar 
to mean clearance values in patients with normal renal function [SCPS original CAPS submission].

In  gout,  the  mean  serum  clearance  of  canakinumab  was  found  to  be  16%  and  22%  lower  for  gouty 
arthritis  patients  with  mild  (CrCl:  50–80  mL/min)  and  moderate  (CrCl:  30–<50  mL/min)  renal 
impairment, respectively, than in those with normal renal function (CrCl > 80 mL/min).  
Impaired hepatic function 
No formal study has been performed with canakinumab in patients with impaired hepatic function as it 
is known that the majority of IgG elimination occurs via intracellular catabolism, following fluid-phase 
or receptor medicated endocytosis. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No  formal  clinical  drug  interaction  studies  or  in  vitro  metabolism/drug  interaction  studies  between 
canakinumab  and  other  medicinal  products  have  been  performed.  Since  macromolecules  such  as 
canakinumab  are  primarily  eliminated  via  intracellular  catabolism,  the  effect  of  drug  interactions 
through cytochrome P450 system on pharmacokinetics of canakinumab is not expected. 
It  is  reported  that  the  synthesis  of  CYP450  enzymes  is  suppressed  by  increased  levels  of  cytokines 
(e.g.,  IL-1,  IL-6,  TNF-alpha)  during  chronic  inflammation  (Aitken  and  Morgan  2007,  Sunman  et  al 
2004, Chaluvadi et al 2009). Anti-cytokine antibodies such as canakinumab that target and neutralize 
these  proinflammatory  cytokines  or  their  receptors  are  capable  of  restoration  of  CYP450  enzymes  to 
normal  levels  (Ashino  et  al  2007).  This  is  clinically  relevant  for  CYP450  substrates  with  a  narrow 
therapeutic  index  where  the  dose  is  individually  adjusted.  On  initiation  of  canakinumab  in  patients 
being treated with this type of medicinal product, therapeutic monitoring of the effect or of the active 
substance  concentration  should  be  performed  and  the  individual  dose  of  the  medicinal  product 
adjusted as necessary. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Canakinumab  binds  with  high  affinity  specifically  to  human  IL-1  beta  and  neutralises  the  biological 
activity  of  human  IL-1  beta  by  blocking  its  interaction  with  IL-1  receptors,  thereby  preventing  IL-1 
beta-induced gene activation and the production of inflammatory mediators. 
Primary pharmacology  
Canakinumab binding to human IL-1β results in the formation of a canakinumab-IL-1β complex. As the 
complex  is  cleared  slower  than  the  free  IL-1β,  an  increase  in  total  IL-1β  is  observed  indicating 
successful binding, which is observed in SJIA patients measured from all SJIA clinical trials. 
The binding parameters were estimated by the PK-binding model and reported below as mean ± SEM 
(see  table  below).  The  clearance  of  IL-1β  was  calculated  to  be  6.22  L/day  in  SJIA  patients,  with  a 
terminal  half-life  of  4.2  days.  The  production  rate  of  IL-1β  is  8.05  ±  0.913  ng/day.  The  ability  of 
canakinumab  to  bind  to  IL-  1β  is  captured  by  the  apparent  in  vivo  dissolution  constant,  Kd,  with  a 
population estimate of 1.5 ± 0.264 nM.

The  clearance  of  IL-1β  was  substantially  (75-302%)  higher  in  all  other  indications  than  that  in  SJIA, 
while the IL-1β production rate (RLI) in all other indications was in general lower than that in SJIA by 
0.5  –  40%.  Specifically,  the  IL-1β  clearance  was  75.5%  higher  in  CAPS  than  that  in  SJIA,  and  the 
production  rate  in  CAPS  was  only  22%  higher  (see  table  below).  The  slower  clearance  and  higher 
production rate of IL-1β in SJIA is considered by the applicant to indicate the possible need for a higher 
dose. 
Table 15.  Deviation  of  PD  Parameters  from  SJIA  Patients  for  Other  Study  Populations 
(displayed as percentage of SJIA Typical Value) 
The figure below shows the relationship between age and the body weight normalized IL-1β clearance, 
as well as the IL-1β production rate. There is a modest trend of higher IL-1β production rate (RLI) and 
clearance (CLL), resulting a modest higher overall turnover of IL- 1β in younger children.

Secondary pharmacology 
Influence on other biomarkers 
No information is given whether determinations of other biomarkers than IL-1ß were conducted in the 
sJIA studies. 
During the single dose study in the CAPS population the soluble serum biomarkers TNFa, IL-6, IL-1ra 
(IL-1  receptor  antagonist),  sIL-1R  (soluble  IL-1  receptor)  and  sCTX  (C-terminal  cross-linking 
telopeptide of type I collagen) had been determined in order to explore the influence of IL-1ß blockade 
Ilaris 
Assessment report

on  other  cytokines/biomarkers  involved.  It  was  observed  that  IL-6  and  IL-1ra  returned  from  high 
baseline levels  to  the  normal  range  and  remained within  normal  limits  during  the  long lasting  clinical 
response, while levels of IL-1R, TNF-alpha and sCTX did not change.  
During  the  pivotal  CAPS  study  (CACZ885D2304)  also  IL-1ra  and  IL-6,  and  additionally  IL-18,  MMP-1 
and  MMP-3  were  measured:    In  Part  I  (single  SC  dose  of  150  mg),  IL-6  levels  tended  to  decrease 
following the first injection with canakinumab. In Part II of the study, IL-6 levels tended to remain low 
in the canakinumab treatment group, while in placebo treated group, levels of this cytokine tended to 
rise.  IL-1ra  and  IL-18  levels  did  not  change  in  Parts  I  and  II.  Data  on  MMP-1  and  MMP-3  were  too 
sparse at the time of this report to allow analysis. 
Influence on effectiveness of vaccination  
The  use  of  live  vaccines  was  prohibited  in  the  SJIA  studies.  Study  A2106  (previously  submitted  in 
gouty  arthritis  dossier)  evaluated  the  efficacy  of  influenza  and  meningococcal  vaccination  in  healthy 
adult  volunteers  exposed  to  canakinumab  300  mg  s.c.  This  study  found  no  effect  of  canakinumab 
administration  on  development  of  antibody  response  after  vaccination.  The  ongoing  study  D2307  is 
evaluating the protective antibody levels following immunization with inactivated (killed) vaccines, and 
the  safety  of  canakinumab  with  concomitant  vaccination  in  children  aged  ≤4  years  with  CAPS.  The 
planned  actions  highlight  routine  pharmacovigilance  activities  resulting  in  the  cumulative  review  in 
each PSUR. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products 
Canakinumab binds to and neutralizes the activity of human IL-1β, a proinflammatory cytokine. Hence, 
any other biologic drugs targeting the immune system (for example, TNF blockers, anakinra, 
rituximab, abatacept, tozilizumab) may lead to a synergistic immune suppression. Therefore, 
concomitant therapy with such biologics is prohibited.  
Immunogenicity 
Canakinumab  is  a  human  recombinant  protein.  The  potential  for  development  of  antibodies  to 
canakinumab has been assessed in SJIA clinical studies and the results are summarized in this section. 
Anti-canakinumab  antibodies  (ADAs)  were  tested  in  serum  of  pediatric  patients  following  single  or 
multiple  administrations  of  canakinumab.  Assessments  were  done  at  multiple  time  points  during  the 
treatment  phase  depending  on  the  study  design  but  always  included  a  baseline  pre-dose 
measurement, and an end of study sample. Collection of additional samples in case of anaphylaxis was 
implemented  in  all  the  SJIA  clinical  study  protocols.  A  sample  for  measurement  of  canakinumab 
concentration  was  taken  concomitantly  with  the  one  for  testing  immunogenicity  to  facilitate  correct 
interpretation of the immunogenicity data. 
Results across the studies 
In  the  SJIA  population,  a  total  of  14  unique  patients  had  anti-canakinumab  antibodies  detected  in  at 
least 1 sample out of 196 patients in SJIA clinical program who contributed to immunogenicity testing. 
Of these 14 patients, 8 had anti-canakinumab antibodies only at baseline, while 6 had post-treatment 
anti-canakinumab antibodies, representing an incidence of 3.1% (6/196) of positive anti-canakinumab 
antibodies in canakinumab treated SJIA patients. None of the patients had neutralizing antibodies. 
Of the 6 patients who had post-treatment anti-canakinumab antibodies, only one patient met definition 
of  persistent  positive  immunogenicity  and  in  this  patient  there  was  no  evidence  of  loss  of  efficacy  or 
reported allergy/hypersensitivity AE. This patient also had negative anticanakinumab antibody testing 
afterwards with continued canakinumab dosing.

There was no evidence of change of drug levels, IL-1β binding or loss of efficacy in any of the 6 post-
treatment  immunogenicity  positive  patients.  One  SJIA  patient  with  post-treatment  anti-canakinumab 
antibodies  had  an  AE  (mild  eyelid  edema  )  suggestive  of  hypersensitivity  within  a  plausible  time  to 
onset.  This  AE  was  successfully  treated  with  an  antihistamine  and  the  patient  remained  in  the  study 
without  clinical  relapse  and  no  antibodies  detected  afterwards  upon  re-treatment.  No  anaphylactic  or 
anaphylactoid  reactions  or  SAE  related  to  immunogenicity  were  reported.  AEs  potentially  related  to 
immunogenicity  were  mostly  mild  and  were  mainly  injection  site  reactions,  rash  and  urticaria  events 
which did not recur upon redosing with canakinumab. There was no evidence of immune-related loss of 
efficacy either by direct antibody detection or by indirect evidence of decreased canakinumab levels or 
target binding. 
In addition to the SJIA integrated immunogenicity analysis, a similar report was written about analysis 
performed  in  the  canakinumab  CAPS  and  Gouty  arthritis  clinical  programs.  The  incidence  of  positive 
anti-canakinumab antibodies was 3/194 (1.5%) in CAPS and 17/799 (2.1%) in Gouty arthritis. In the 
immunogenicity  report,  information  on  relationships  between  immunogenicity,  PK  and  IL-1β  binding, 
and safety and efficacy in these patient populations is also reported  
In  summary,  canakinumab  showed  low  immunogenicity.  The  incidence  of  treatment  related  anti-
canakinumab antibodies was 3.1% in SJIA patients. No patient had neutralizing antibodies. In one case 
the presence of anti-canakinumab antibodies was linked to a mild hypersensitivity AE. No anaphylactic 
or anaphylactoid reactions or SAE related to immunogenicity were reported. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Exposure-efficacy relationship 
PK-flare model for dose selection 
Exposure-efficacy response relationship was initially explored in SJIA patients in study A2203. A non-
linear  mixed  effect  PK-flare  model  was  fitted  to  the  Phase  II  data.  The  PK-flare  model  establishes  a 
relationship between drug concentrations (exposure) and primary clinical manifestation of the disease- 
that  is  a  flare.  The  PK-flare  model  allowed  estimation  of  the  critical  flare  concentration,  Ki,  at  which 
there is a 50:50 probability of clinical relapse (flare) and was determined to be 2 μg/mL (74% CV).  
The  PK-flare  model  was  used  to  perform  simulations  for  the  probability  of  relapse  (flare)  for  SJIA 
patients  given  doses  from  1-7  mg/kg  administered  s.c..  The  metric  was  the  proportion  of  patients 
relapsing (flaring) at the end of 4 weeks (Table 3-6). At a dose of 4 mg/kg s.c., the median percentage 
of  patients  predicted  to  relapse  within  4  weeks  was  estimated  at  6%  (95%  CI,  1–21%).  The  median 
percentage  of  patients  predicted  to  relapse  at  3  mg/kg  or  2  mg/kg  was  approximately  11%  or  18%, 
respectively.  The  incremental  efficacy  gain  between  4  and  7  mg/kg  was  not considered large  enough 
considering the wide confidence intervals to justify higher dosing. 
Based on these data, a fixed dose regimen of monthly canakinumab at 4 mg/kg up to a maximum 300 
mg  s.c.  injection  was  chosen  as  the  recommended  dose,  to  ensure  low  probability  of  relapse  in 
majority of patients.

Simulated Concentration of Canakinumab at the Visit Time of Flare in SJIA Patients 
Simulated concentrations of canakinumab at flare for the combined SJIA pooled studies showed a wide 
distribution  ranging  from  0  to  41μg/mL,  with  the  median  predicted  concentration  centered  at  5.8 
μg/mL.  
There is a statistical difference (p-value < 0.0001, unpaired t-test) in the concentration at flare versus 
no flare.  
The predicted mean concentration at flare for combined SJIA pooled studies was determined to be 8.1 
±  9.1  μg/mL  (112%  CV)  whereas  predicted  mean  concentration  at  no  flare  was  14.5  ±  10.4  μg/mL 
(72%  CV).  Comparison  across  the  different  studies  showed  differences  in  the  mean  predicted 
concentration at flare for studies A2203 (4.77 ± 7.5 μg/mL), G2305 (0.5 ± 1.8 μg/mL), G2301 (11.6 ± 
9.3 μg/mL) and G2301E1 (12.9 ± 8.8 μg/ml). 
Examination  of  the  mean  predicted  trough  concentration  at  flare  in  all  SJIA  studies  or  for  only  the 
Phase  3  studies  with  and  without  exclusion  of  LLOQ  was  statistically  significant  from  the  mean 
predicted trough concentration at no flare (Phase 3 studies: 13.1 ± 8.68 μg/mL (flare) vs 16.9 ± 9.53 
μg/mL (no flare); p-value < 0.0001).

To  further  understand  how  the  exposures  of  canakinumab  for  the  different  SJIA  studies  may  prevent 
flares, the figure below subsets each study by treatment arms.

For  G2305  efficacy  study  where  SJIA  patients  are  randomized  to  either  placebo  or  4  mg/kg  s.c  of 
canakanimab,  a  difference  in  trough  concentration  at  flare  versus  no  flare  is  observed.  Higher 
incidence of flares in the placebo group is seen (31 total number of flares vs 3 total number of flares in 
canakinumab  treatment).  Similar  findings  were  seen  for  G2301  for  those  treated  and  randomized  to 
placebo group.  
Further separation of part I and part II in G2301 was done where Figure 5-10 shows a boxplot of only 
G2301  Part  II  for  placebo  versus  maintenance;  a  2-fold  higher  incidence  of  flares  occurred  in 
comparison  to  the  treated  group  maintained  on  4  mg/kg  of  canakinumab.  The  predicted  trough 
concentration at flare for the placebo group (or washout period) in part II of G2301 showed majority of 
subjects  with  an  estimated  null  canakinumab  concentration  at  flare.  Estimated  mean  trough 
concentration at flare for Part II of G2301 excluding LLOQ (see table below) was statistically different 
from the mean predicted trough concentration at no flare (12.9 ± 13 μg/mL vs 18.1 ± 12.3 μg/mL).

Table 18.  Summary  of  Canakinumab  Trough  Concentration  at  Flare  and  No  Flare  for 
G2301 Part II: Prevention of Flare 
Stratifying by age and bodyweight group, the predicted concentration of canakinumab at the visit time 
for the assessment of flare was comparable among the groups ranging from 7 to 13 μg/mL.Assuming 
this predicted concentration of canakinumab at flare (ranging from 7 to 13 μg/mL) is a closer value of 
Ki  at  steady-state,  sufficient  exposure  is  covered  by  4  mg/kg  s.c  dosage.  The  average  steady-state 
trough  and  peak  level  for  canakinumab  in  SJIA  patients  are  15  μg/mL  and  37  μg/mL,  respectively. 
Subsequently, 4 mg/kg s.c admininstered every 4 weeks maintained steady-state trough levels above 
predicted concentration at flare. 
In  conclusion,  the  few  flares  that  do  occur  are  expected  as  the  PK-Flare  model  had  projected  at  4 
mg/kg s.c dose, a 6% probability of relapse to take place. More than 95% of subjects administered 4 
mg/kg s.c dose of canakinumab had their steady-state trough levels above the previous estimated Ki. 
Simulated Concentration of free IL-1ß at the Visit Time of Flare in SJIA Patients 
It is interesting to note that those that do flare, not only have lower concentration of canakinumab but 
also slightly higher predicted level of free IL-1β than that predicted at no flare. This was a consistent 
trend observed in all SJIA studies.  
Predicted free IL-1β at flare were comparable across the age groups with median value of 0.87 pg/mL 
suggesting  minimal  difference  in  IL-1β  level  at  the  concentration  at  flare.  Of  note,  the  lower 
bodyweight group (≤ 40 kg) had a 20% higher predicted free IL-1β for both flare and no flare.  
PK-hazard model based on G2301 part II data 
The  exposure-  efficacy  response  analysis  of  canakinumab  in  SJIA  patients  were  performed  with  the 
data from G2301 Part II. The analysis was to assess whether 4 mg/kg every 4 weeks dosing regimen is 
appropriate for SJIA patients and provided insights into where this dose (4 mg/kg every 4 weeks) lies 
within the broader dose response relationship.

Study  G2301  Part  II  employed  a  withdrawal  design  for  patients  randomized  to  placebo  (see  above). 
Together  with  the  patients  in  canakinumab  arm,  the  data  set  provided  a  wide range  of  canakinumab 
concentrations  that  enabled  estimation  of  an  exposure-flare  reduction  relationship.  The  incidents  of 
flare  in  Study  G2301  part  II  were  modeled  as  a  time-varying  (non-homogeneous)  Poisson  process, 
implemented  as  a  discrete  hazard  model.  Canakinumab  was  postulated  to  suppress  the  background 
hazard  of  flare  in  a  concentration-dependent  manner,  with  an  inhibitory  Emax  model  linking 
canakinumab  concentration  to  the  flare  hazard  reduction.  In  the  discrete  hazard  model,  the  time-
varying  flare  hazard  function  takes  into  account  both  the  disease  severity  of  a  patient  and  the 
therapeutic  effect  from  canakinumab,  including  the  flare  rate  per  week.  For  canakinumab  exposure, 
the  dosing  history  was  used  to  calculate  the  weekly  average  canakinumab  concentration  of  each 
patient using the PK binding model. 
The final model was a heterogeneous background hazard model which reflected a small portion of high 
hazard patients. The model was able to capture the observed Kaplan-Meier curves of both the placebo 
and canakinumab arms well (Figure 3-8). The only significant covariate retained in the discrete hazard 
model  were  baseline  steroid  dose  at  the  end  of  Part  I  of  the  study,  no  other  covariates  (age,  daily 
steroid usage and baseline ACR strata) offered further improvement to the hazard model. In contrast 
to the pre-defined statistical analysis, the exposure-flare reduction relationship takes into account the 
protective effect of residual canakinumab concentrations for placebo patients during the initial period of 
the  withdrawal  design.  This  model-based  analysis  is  potentially  more  sensitive  than  the  pre-defined 
statistical  analysis.  The  model  demonstrates  that  canakinumab  decreases  significantly  (p<0.001)  the 
risk of flare with potentially full suppression in a concentration-dependent manner, where median IC50 
was estimated to be 3.27 μg/ml (Range: 0.529-7.27 μg/ml). 
Figure 12. Observed Kaplan-Meier and point-wise median of 500 simulated Kaplan-Meier 
curves  or  flaring  for  placebo  (left)  and  canakinumab  (right)  base  on  the 
heterogeneous background hazard model 
Based on the final parameters estimated from the exposure-hazard model, simulations of canakinumab 
exposure-flare  reduction  relationship  in  SJIA  was  performed  (see  tables  below).  Trial  simulations 
suggested that at the end of 12 months, the probability of flare was 63% (90% CI: 55% to 71%) for 
the  placebo  arm.  For  the  treatment  arms  ranging  from  1  mg/kg  to  6  mg/kg  canakinumab,  the 
probabilities of flare were 37%, 30%, 26%, 24%, 22%, 21%. Specifically, 4 mg/kg dose reduces flare 
rate over placebo by 39% at the end of 12 months, consistent with the clinical observed data.

Greater than 4 mg/kg dose would provide only marginal gain in flare reduction over 6 and 12 months, 
while  less  than  4  mg/kg  dose  would  significantly  increase  risk  to  experience  a  flare  over  6  and  12 
months. The results support 4 mg/kg as an appropriate dose in preventing flare events in patients.

Exposure-safety relationship 
Potential  relationships  between  canakinumab  exposure  and  various  adverse  events  as  well  as  the 
clinically notable abnormalities in laboratory parameters were explored. 
The analyses were based on the data from the canakinumab treatment groups in two Phase III studies 
in SJIA, Study G2305 and Study G2301 (Part I only). Canakinumab exposure was estimated by popPK 
binding model. The AE included in this analysis were abdominal pain, cough, headache, infection, MAS, 
pyrexia,  SAE  of  infection,  and  vomiting;  laboratory  parameters  were  hemoglobin  levels,  platelet 
counts, absolute neutrophil counts or absolute WBC counts; as well as AST, ALT, estimated creatinine 
clearance and total cholesterol. 
In  the  combined  population  of  these  2  studies,  patients  received  up  to  8  s.c.  doses  of  4  mg/kg 
canakinumab, given at 4-week intervals. The total treatment duration was divided into 8 periods based 
on the timing of canakinumab administration, which allowed analysis of trends over time on treatment. 
Estimated  canakinumab  exposure  data  were  available  for  188  patients,  although  the  number  of 
patients  declined  over  time.  The  average  canakinumab  concentration  was  lower  in  the  early  dosing 
periods since the time to steady state was approximately 110 days. 
The  distribution  of  the  canakinumab  exposure  (average  concentration)  for  subjects  with  and  without 
adverse and laboratory abnormality event were displayed in each of Periods 1 to 8. 
The average canakinumab concentration was similar between patients who had AEs and those who did 
not have AEs in each of the 8 studied dosing periods. In patients who experienced adverse events of 
abdominal  pain,  cough,  headache,  infection,  MAS,  fever,  and  vomiting,  canakinumab  concentrations 
were similar to those who did not have the events.  
The  relationship  between canakinumab  exposure  and  longitudinal  incidence  of  events  was  graphically 
investigated  by  line  plots  presenting  the  time  course  of  the  individual  estimated  canakinumab 
concentration and the individual estimated canakinumab concentration at the time of first event (in the 
period)  if  any.  AEs  did  not  occur  at  peak  canakinumab  concentrations.  This  was  also  the  case  for 
infection  SAEs.  These  findings  suggest  that  there  was  no  relationship  between  canakinumab 
Ilaris

concentration and AEs, but should be interpreted cautiously given the small number of events in some 
cases. 
Similarly,  canakinumab  concentrations  in  patients  who  had  notable  laboratory  abnormalities  (of  liver 
function  parameters  ALT  and  AST;  estimated  creatinine  clearance;  hemoglobin  levels,  platelet  counts 
or absolute WBC counts)  were similar to those in patients without such abnormalities, and there was 
no  particular  trends  with  respect  to  the  time  course  of  canakinumab  concentrations  in  patients  with 
abnormalities.  This  suggests  that  there  was  no  relationship  between  canakinumab  concentration  and 
these abnormal laboratory values. 
Patients who had low neutrophil counts (post-baseline values of < 0.9 x LLN) had higher canakinumab 
concentrations than subjects who had neutrophil counts that remained within the normal range. This is 
consistent with a known pharmacodynamic effect of canakinumab.

and without laboratory abnormality event by period 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Four  studies  (studies  [A2203],  [G2305],  [G2301],  and  [G2301E])  contributed  sparse  PK  data  from 
SJIA  patients  at  the  age  of  1-19  years.  Single  dose  PK  after  4  mg/kg  canakinumab  in  SJIA  patients 
could  not  be  determined  properly  due  to  sparse  data,  especially  with  regard  to  Cmax  and  Tmax. 
However,  from  AUC  estimations  dose  proportionality  can  also  be  assumed  in  this  population.  Tmax 
appeared  to  be  earlier  (2.6  days)  in  SJIA  patients  than  in  former  populations  (7d).  Even  though 
determination of Tmax is imprecise due to sparse sampling this observation could plausibly be related 
to a faster absorption rate in children, since a clear relationship between ka and age has been found in 
the population PK analysis. 
The  NONMEM  dataset  used  for  the  PK-Binding  model  derived  previously  including  other  disease 
populations  (eg,  CAPS,  Gouty  Arthritis,  Rheumatoid  Arthritis,  Japanese  Healthy  Volunteer,  Non-
Japanese Healthy Volunteer, and Psoriasis) was updated with the sparse PK data of the additional SJIA 
studies  totalling  28  clinical  studies  including  their  extensions.  Canakinumab  and  total  IL-1β  plasma 
concentration-time  data  were  adequately  described  by  the  population-based  PK-Binding  model. 
However,  predictability  for  the  IL-1ß  data  was  much  lower  than  for  the  canakinumab  concentration

data.  Also  predictability  for  rate  of  absorption  (and  thus  Cmax  and  Tmax)  is  low  due  to  lack  of 
observed data in the early time range. Therefore, individual estimates of the model parameters Cmax, 
Tmax  and  IL-1ß  have  to  be  interpreted  with  caution.  Based  on  the  population  PK  analysis  the  PK 
properties of canakinumab relevant to SJIA population were estimated as follows: 
All  covariate-parameter  relationships  formerly  identified  (bodyweight  on  clearance  and  the  two 
volumes of distribution, allometrically scaled with weight, plus serum albumin on clearance and age on 
the  subcutaneous  drug  absorption  rate)  were  confirmed  to  be  statistically  significant  (p-value  < 
0.0001),  confirming  the  importance  of  these  covariates  in  the  population-based  PK-Binding  model. 
Potential  relationships  between  all  PK  parameters  and  continuous  covariates  (eg  age,  weight,  height, 
scr)  and  categorical  covariates  (gender,  Race,  Ethnicity)  were  graphically  assessed.  No  apparent 
relationship was evident for the PK parameters and the other tested covariates. 
The  covariate  effect  of  Albumin  on  canakinumab  clearance  in  SJIA  patients  is  low,  the  effect  of  body 
weight on CL and V and of age on absorption rate is more relevant. 
Serum clearance of canakinumab and its volumes of distribution were dependent on bodyweight. The 
estimated serum clearance of canakinumab was 0.106 ± 0.00689 L/day in SJIA patients (typical value 
at  mean  body  weight of  33  kg  from  SJIA  clinical  trials  ).  The  corresponding  volume  of  distribution  at 
steady state was 3.21 L.  
Canakinumab  clearance  versus  body  weight  relation  has  the  allometric  exponent  of  0.823  (95%  CI: 
0.751  –  0.895),  which  is  less  than  1.  Therefore,  the  effect  of  body  weight  on  canakinumab 
pharmacokinetics was not completely compensated when the dose was given on body weight basis. A 
slightly  lower  body-weight  normalized  clearance  at  higher  body  weight  leads  to  a  higher  exposure 
(AUCss) for the higher bodyweight groups (> 40 kg). 
A clear inverse relationship is observed between absorption rate and age. This means that absorption 
is faster the younger the patients are. This is reflected by an apparently smaller Tmax observed than in 
adults.  Whether  this  might  be  accompanied  by  a  higher  bioavailability  in  younger  children  was  not 
investigated, but estimations of steady state exposure by age do not indicate a big effect.  
Following  subcutaneous  administration  of  canakinumab  (product  type  D),  the  estimated  absolute 
bioavailability (F) in SJIA  patients was 68.9 ± 3.65% which was similar to other formulations applied 
and to the observed value in CAPS patients (63-70%).  
After  repeated  administration  of  4  mg/kg  every  4  weeks  s.c.,  the  accumulation  ratio  of  canakinumab 
was 1.6 fold in SJIA patients. The overall predicted mean (±SD) for Cmin,ss, Cmax,ss and AUC,ss were 
14.7±8.8 μg/mL, 36.5 ± 14.9 μg/mL and 696.1 ± 326.5 μg.day/mL, respectively.  
A lower (30-40%) median of exposure for Cmin,ss (11.4 versus 19 µg/ml) and AUCss (594 versus 880 
µg*day/mL)  for  the  lower  bodyweight  group  (≤40  kg)  than  higher  bodyweight  group  (>  40  kg)  was 
estimated. 
As  expected  from  the  selected  dosing  regimen,  the  predictions  confirm  that  steady  state  exposure  of 
canakinumab  in  sJIA  patients  is  higher  than  that  obtained  in  CAPS  children  or  adults  after 
administration of 150 mg/2 mg/kg 8weekly. This population reaches the highest steady state levels of 
canakinumab  observed  so  far  in  studied  populations,  resulting  in  about  twice  the  exposure  of  adult 
CAPS patients after 150 mg s.c. 8-weekly (Cmax,ss: 22,4 µg/ml, AUC8w,ss: 704 µg*day/ml). 
The estimated terminal half-life was 22 days, which is consistent with the value estimated in CAPS or 
gouty  arthritis  patients  (26  days).  Time  to  steady  state is  expected to be  approximately  110 days  (5 
half-lives) which means that after about 4 months (4 dose intervals) steady state should be reached. 
There was no indication of changes in pharmacokinetic properties over time.  
Ilaris 
Assessment report

Canakinumab  pharmacokinetics  is  similar  across  different  disease  population  including  asthma, 
rheumatoid  arthritis,  CAPS,  gout  and  SJIA  when  comparing  their  bodyweight  normalized  clearance. 
Final parameter estimates for IL-1ß kinetics differ between the populations. 
The data provided indicate that there is no disease effect in the PK of canakinumab. CL values at 70 kg 
BW are comparable in all populations. The absolute number of male and female patients in the data 
pool of sJIA patients was sufficient for testing gender as a category covariate. No indication for a 
gender effect was seen. 
It  cannot  be  excluded  that  canakinumab  potentially  increases  the  clearance  of  CYP450  metabolized 
drugs  via  IL-1  neutralisation.  Potential  interactions  with  drugs  eliminated  by  CYP450  enzyme  are 
addressed in the RMP and appropriately labeled in the Product in formation. 
Pharmacodynamics: 
As  expected  from  former  trials  with  canakinumab  in  other  populations  an  increase  in  total  IL-1β 
indicating successful binding is observed in SJIA patients from all SJIA clinical trials. 
From  sparse  IL-1ß  data  in  all  studies  by  means  of  the  PK  binding  model  values  were  estimated  for 
binding affinity (Kd about 1nM) and for the half-life of free IL-1ß (4 days) which are comparable to that 
estimated in CAPS patients. A slower clearance and higher production rate of un-complexed IL-1ß was 
estimated  for  SJIA  patients  compared  to  other  populations.  The  IL-1β  clearance  rate  in  CAPS  was 
75.5%  higher  than  that  of  SJIA,  suggesting  higher  levels  of  IL-1β  in  SJIA  patients  which  might  be  a 
possible  reason  for  the  need  for  a  higher  dose.  In  younger  children  with  SJIA,  there  was  a  modest 
trend of higher production rate and clearance of IL-1β, resulting in a modest higher overall turnover of 
IL-1β.  
No data are available on either the effects of live vaccination or the secondary transmission of infection 
by live vaccines in patients receiving Ilaris. Therefore the SmPC state that live vaccines should not be 
given concurrently with Ilaris unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. 
There is a potential risk of interaction between canakinumab and other drugs blocking IL-1 (e.g. 
anakinra) and drugs blocking TNF. This has been addressed in the RMP/SmPC accordingly.  
Immunogenicity 
Canakinumab  showed  low  immunogenicity.  The  incidence  of  treatment  related  anti-canakinumab 
antibodies was 3.1% (6/196) in SJIA patients which is similar to that observed in CAPS (3/194; 1.5%) 
and  in  Gouty  arthritis  (17/799;  2.1%).  No  patient  had  neutralizing  antibodies.  One  SJIA  patient  with 
post-treatment  anti-canakinumab  antibodies  had  an  AE  (mild  eyelid  edema)  suggestive  of 
hypersensitivity  within  a  plausible  time  to  onset.  No  anaphylactic  or  anaphylactoid  reactions  or  SAE 
related to immunogenicity were reported. 
Exposure-response relationships: 
Efficacy  
The range of predicted canakinumab concentrations at flare in all SJIA studies is extremely large (from 
zero to up 41 µg/mL), almost as wide as those predicted for no flare (from zero up to 60 µg/mL). 
However,  the  mean  estimated  trough  concentration  at  flare  was  statistically  lower  than  the  mean 
estimated  trough  concentration  at  no  flare  in  phase  3  clinical  studies  (13.1  ±  8.68  μg/mL  vs  16.9  ± 
9.53 μg/mL; p-value < 0.0001). 
There  is  a  (weak)  relationship  between  canakinumab  plasma  concentrations  and  probability  of  flare 
and  a  Ki  (concentration  for  50%  flare  probability)  of  2  µg/mL  was  estimated  which  is  comparable  to 
Ilaris 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/427081/2013  
Page 39/165 
 
 
 
that estimated for the CAPS population. More than 95% of subjects administered 4 mg/kg s.c dose of 
canakinumab had their steady-state trough levels above Ki. 
By  means  of  this  model  it  was  predicted  that  at  a  dose  of  4  mg/kg  s.c.,  the  median  percentage  of 
patients  predicted  to  relapse  within  4  weeks  was  estimated  at  6%  (95%  CI,  1–21%).  The  median 
percentages  of  patients  predicted  to  relapse  were  much  higher  at  2  mg/kg  and  3  mg/kg,  and  were 
approximately  11%  and  18%,  respectively.  The  efficacy  improvement  between  4  and  7  mg/kg  was 
marginal. 
An  exposure-hazard  model  based  on  G2301  Part  II  data  demonstrated  that  canakinumab  decreased 
significantly (p<0.001) the risk of  flare with potentially full suppression in  a concentration-dependent 
manner (IC50 = 3.27 (range: 0.530, 7.27) μg/ml). The baseline steroid dose at the end of part I of the 
study had significant influence on risk of flare. 
The exposure-hazard model predicted that the 4mg/kg dose reduced flare rate over placebo by ~39% 
at the end of 12 months, consistent with the clinical data observed. The model predicted that greater 
than 4mg/kg dose would provide only marginal improvement in flare reduction over 6 and 12 months, 
while doses less than 4mg/kg dose would significantly increase risk to experience a flare over 6 and 12 
months. 
Safety 
There was a lack of an exposure-safety relationship for the AEs evaluated including Cough, Headache, 
Infection,  MAS,  Pyrexia,  SAE  infection.  Except  for  infection,  the  observation  was  based  on  limited  AE 
incidence. 
Subjects  with  neutropenia  had  higher  canakinumab  levels  than  subjects  without  neutropenia.  The 
“IC50  parameter  for  the  neutrophil  loss“  was  estimated  to  be  about  9.1  ug/mL  being  about  2.5  to  3 
times higher than the “IC50 parameter for the freedom of flares” equal to 3.27 ug/mL derived from the 
PK-hazard model. The majority of SJIA patients has Ctrough values > 9.1 µg/mL. Neutrophil values of 
less than 90% of the LLN mainly occurred at concentrations of 30ug/mL and above. This is comparable 
with  the  IC90  for  efficacy.  Dosing  with  canakinumab  4  mg/kg  reduces  the  neutrophils  levels  from 
approximately  2-32*  109/L  at  baseline  to  1-16*109/L  at  steady  state  (5%  reach  >  grade  2).  Thus, 
there  is  a  narrow  but  acceptable  window  of  discrimination  between  efficacy  and  safety.  Information 
and  precautions  with  regards  to  this  side  effect  is  appropriately  reflected  in  the  product  information 
(see also discussion on safety). 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The data provided on pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and on PK / PD modelling are considered 
appropriate  to  support  the  proposed  extension  of  the  indication  to  the  treatment  of  active  Systemic 
Juvenile  Idiopathic  Arthritis  (SJIA)  in  patients  aged  2 years  and  older  who  have  responded 
inadequately  to  previous  therapy  with  non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs)  and  systemic 
corticosteroids. Ilaris can be given as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate.

2.4.2.  Main studies 
Study G2305 
A  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo  controlled,  single-dose  study  to  assess  the  initial  efficacy  of 
canakinumab (ACZ885) with respect to the adapted ACR pediatric 30 criteria in patients with Systemic 
Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (sJIA) and active systemic manifestations. 
Methods 
Study participants 
Patients  were  randomized  in  a  total  of  40  centers  in  18  (EU  and  non  EU)  countries.  Male  or  female 
patients  aged  2  to  <20  years  with  a  confirmed  diagnosis  of  sJIA  as  per  International  League  Against 
Rheumatism (ILAR) definition at least 2 months prior to enrollment with an onset of disease <16 years 
of  age.  Patients  must  have  had  active  disease  defined  as:  at  least  2  joints  with  active  arthritis; 
documented  spiking,  intermittent  fever  (body  temperature  >38°  C)  for  at  least  1  day  during  the 
screening  period  within  1  week  before  study  drug  administration;  and  C-reactive  protein  (CRP)  >30 
mg/L (normal range < 10 mg/L). 
No concomitant use of second line agents such as disease-modifying and/ or immunosuppressive drugs 
was allowed with the exception of: 
• 
Stable dose of methotrexate (maximum of 20 mg/ m2/ week) for at least 8 weeks prior to the 
screening visit, and folic/folinic acid supplementation (according to standard medical practice of 
the center) 
• 
• 
Stable  dose  of  no  more  than  one  non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory  drug  for  at  least  2  weeks 
prior to the screening visit 
Stable  dose  of  glucocorticoid  treatment  ≤  1.0  mg/kg/day  (maximum  60  mg/day  for  children 
over 60 kg) in 1-2 doses per day of oral prednisone (or equivalent) for at least 3 days prior to 
randomization.  
Treatments 
Patients  received  a  s.c.  injection  of  canakinumab  (4  mg/kg)  or  placebo  on  Day  1.  The  maximal  total 
single  dose  of  canakinumab  allowed  was  300  mg.  Any  patient  who  required  a  dose  greater  than  150 
mg (patients >37.5 kg) received two s.c. injections. 
Patients who did not show clinical improvement prior to Day 15 as well as those who did not achieve 
an adapted ACR pediatric 30 criteria (ACR30) at Day 15 were discontinued from the study. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to show superiority of canakinumab compared to placebo with 
regards to the primary variable.

X-ray (radiograph) of the hands and wrists (both sides) 
Patients (volunteers who consented at Screening) with an affected hand and/or wrist had articular x-
rays  of  both  hands  and  wrists  (left  and  right  side)  performed.  (Note:  Assessed  at  baseline  only.  The 
purpose  was  to  have  a  baseline  for  patients  who  may  have  rolled  over  into  study  CACZ885G2301  or 
CACZ885G2301E1.) 
Monitoring of sexual maturation (Tanner stages) 
Physical development in children, adolescents and adults from 6 – 20 years of age was monitored by 
the  Tanner  stages  (also  known  as  the  Tanner  scale).  (Note:  Assessed  at  baseline  only.  The  purpose 
was  to  have  a  baseline  for  patients  who  may  have  rolled  over  into  study  CACZ885G2301  or 
CACZ885G2301E1.) 
Sample size 
The planned sample size was 122 patients (61 patients per treatment group). The anticipated sample 
size for the interim analysis was 84 patients. Anticipating responder rates of 60% for the active group 
and 30% for the placebo group, it was calculated that with 122 (61 per group) patients Fisher’s exact 
test would have about 90% power to detect this difference when applying a type I error of 2.5% (one-
sided). 
A  total  of  84  patients  were  randomized  (43  to  canakinumab  and  41  to  placebo),  treated,  and  all  are 
included in the efficacy and safety analysis populations. 
Randomisation 
Patients  were  centrally  randomized  in  an  1:1  ratio  (canakimumab:placebo)  stratified  by  number  of 
active joints (≤ 26 /   >26),  non-responder to anakinra (yes /  no), and level  of current corticosteroid 
use (≤ 0.4 mg/kg / > 0.4 mg/kg). 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind, randomized study. The following blinding methods were used:  
1. 
Randomization  data  were  kept  strictly  confidential  until  the  time  of  unblinding,  and  were  not 
accessible  by  anyone  else  involved  in  the  study  with  the  exception  of  the  independent, 
unblinded qualified study person at the investigator’s site who prepared the study medication. 
2. 
The identity of the canakinumab/placebo treatments were concealed by the use of study drugs 
in  form  of  syringes  filled  with  reconstituted  canakinumab  solutions  that  were  all  identical  in 
appearance,  but  the  actual  canakinumab  (or  placebo)  vials  with  lyophilisate  were  supplied 
“open-label”

Statistical methods 
Superiority of canakinumab over placebo with regard to ACR30 response at day 15 was to be assessed 
by  means  of  a  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  (CMH)  test  adjusted  for  the  stratification  factors  at 
randomisation.  For  the  primary  analysis,  patients  who  discontinued  due  to  any  reason  prior  day  15 
were  considered  non-responders.  Homogeneity  across  strata  was  assessed  by  means  of  a  Breslow  & 
Day test.  
If  the  primary  objective  was  achieved,  secondary  endpoints  were  to  be  assessed  according  to  a  pre-
specified hierarchy to evaluate superiority of canakinumab over placebo. In order to control the overall 
Type  I  error  rate  testing  had  to  stop  as  soon  as  statistical  significance  failed  for  the  first  time. 
Categorical variables were to be analysed by means of a CMH test, continuous variables by means of 
ANCOVA models. All efficacy analyses were to be based on the full analysis set (FAS) of all randomized 
patients who received at least one dose of study drug. 
In  general  data  were  described  by  statistical  characteristics  (continuous  variables:  mean,  standard 
deviation, median, minimum, maximum, 25% and 75% quantiles; categorical variables: absolute and 
relative frequencies) stratified for treatment. Treatment differences were described by point estimates 
and their 95%-confidence intervals. 
According protocol amendment 4, a pre-planned interim analysis was performed after 84 patients had 
achieved  the  primary  endpoint.  Based  on  an  error  spending  function  approximating  O'Brien-Fleming 
boundaries it was calculated that for the primary analysis an alpha level of 0.00697 was to be applied 
at interim to protect the overall false positive rate of the trial at 0.025. The alpha level to be used for 
testing the secondary parameters (0.01612) was based on an adjustment according Pocock. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 84 patients were randomized, 43 to canakinumab and 41 to placebo (Table 10-1). The only 
reported reason patients discontinued from the study was unsatisfactory therapeutic effect. A majority 
of patients in the placebo group discontinued from the study for this reason (90.2%) while only 14.0% 
of patients in the canakinumab group discontinued for this reason. There were no discontinuations due 
to safety reasons.

Conduct of the study 
There  are  five  protocol  amendments,  however,  Amendment  2  was  retracted  before  implementation 
(see below). Previous sections of this report describe the study conduct as amended. The key features 
of each amendment are summarized below: 
Protocol  Amendment  1  was  written  to  change  the  criteria  for  which  a  patient  would  discontinue 
between Days 15-29 due to declining efficacy after first demonstrating a clinical response (a minimum 
adapted ACR Pediatric 30 response) at Day 15. 
Protocol  Amendment  2  was  written  to  ensure  that  joint  counts  were  performed  by  a  trained  joint 
assessor, however, the amendment was retracted on 28-Oct-2009 following feedback from the health 
authorities. 
Protocol Amendment 3 was written based on feedback from health authorities to: 1) clarify absence of 
fever in the secondary objectives, 2) ensure that patients were on a stable dose of corticosteroids at 
least 3 days prior to baseline, and 3) clarify the transition of CACZ885G2305 placebo or canakinumab 
patients  to  study  CACZ885G2301  or  CACZ885G2301E1,  respectively,  if  they  did  not  maintain  a 
minimum adapted ACR Pediatric 30 response after Day 15. 
Protocol Amendment 4 was written to implement an interim analysis.  
Protocol  Amendment  5  was  written  to  describe  the  implementation  of  an  adjudication  committee  for 
MAS and the follow-up to be conducted on MAS cases that are identified in the study. 
No other changes in study conduct occurred. 
Protocol deviations 
The proportion of patients with any protocol deviation was higher in the canakinumab group (79.1%) 
compared with the placebo group (53.7%). 
The three most common protocol deviations were the following: 
• Body temperature not taken orally or rectally: 11 (25.6%) vs. 5 (12.2%) 
• Missing hematology value: 10 (23.3%) vs. 6 (14.6%) 
• Missing important safety evaluation (ECG, vital signs): 7 (16.3%) vs. 4 (9.8%) 
Protocol deviations for exclusion from a per protocol analysis were pre-defined although a per protocol 
analysis  was  not  planned  nor  performed.  Three  patients  in  each  treatment  group  had  this  type  of 
protocol  deviation:  patient  was  not  discontinued  despite  not  meeting  the  adapted  ACR  30  pediatric 
criteria at Day 15. 
There was one protocol deviation that was not captured: Patient 0147/00007 in the placebo group did 
not  have  a  CRP  level  >30  mg/L  at  baseline  (as  required  by  the  inclusion  criteria).  However,  this 
deviation  did  not  exclude  the  patient  from  any  analysis.  In  addition,  protocol  deviations  for  two 
patients in the canakinumab group and three patients in the placebo group identified in Amendment 1 
to the initial CSR (14-Nov-2011) have been incorporated in this CSR. 
One  additional  type  of  protocol  deviation  was  identified  before  database  re-lock:  urine  protein  ≥  2+ 
(considered  moderately  to  severely  impaired)  at  study  entry.  One  patient  had  this  protocol  deviation 
(0020/00001). These additional protocol deviations had no impact on the analyses.

Baseline data 
The majority of patients were Caucasian and female, and the average age was 9 years. The youngest 
patients in the entire population (i.e., those patients 2-<4 years of age) were all in the canakinumab 
group. There was a lower number of patients aged 6 - <12 years in the canakinumab group compared 
with  the  placebo  group.  Baseline  demographics  were  otherwise  generally  comparable  for  the  two 
treatment groups.

The  majority  of  patients  had  no  prior  use  of  anakinra  (63.1%  of  patients  overall).  Of  those  who  had 
used  anakinra  before,  most  had  taken  it  within  the  previous  week  (21  of  31  patients  overall). 
Approximately half of the patients with prior use discontinued anakinra for reasons other than lack of 
efficacy or tolerability (16 of 31 patients overall). There were no relevant differences between the two 
treatment groups in the prior use of anakinra.

Thirteen (30.2%) patients in the canakinumab group and 15 (36.6%) patients in the placebo 
group had prior use of etanercept; all had discontinued use due to lack of efficacy. 
One (2.3%) patient in the canakinumab group and 2 (4.9%) patients in the placebo group had 
prior use of tocilizumab; the drug had been discontinued for either lack of efficacy or lack of 
tolerability. 
Three (7.0%) patients in the canakinumab group and 4 (9.8%) patients in the placebo group 
had prior use of adalimumab and in all cases it had been discontinued due to lack of efficacy. 
No patients in either treatment group reported prior use of abatacept. 
Most patients had a relevant past or current medical history/condition (62.8% canakinumab vs. 75.6% 
placebo). The most common medical histories by system organ class (i.e., ≥15.0% in either group) for 
canakinumab  vs.  placebo,  respectively,  were  infections  and  infestations  (37.2%  vs.  29.3%), 
gastrointestinal disorders (20.9% vs. 26.8%), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (18.6% 
vs.  17.1%),  skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders  (20.9%  vs.  12.2%),  and  blood  and  lymphatic 
system  disorders  (9.3%  vs.  17.1%).  The  most  common  histories  by  preferred  term  (i.e.,  ≥10.0%  in 
either  group)  were  varicella  (11.6%  vs.  2.4%)  and  anemia  (4.7%  vs.  14.6%).  The  profile  of  medical 
histories was as expected for this patient population.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy results 
The  primary  efficacy  variable  was  the  proportion  of  patients  who  responded  to  treatment  at  Day  15 
according to the adapted ACR Pediatric 30 criteria (ACR30). The two treatment groups were compared 
using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test adjusting for stratification factors: number of active joints (≤ 
26, > 26),  non-responder to anakinra  (yes or  no if  either responder to anakinra or never exposed to 
anakinra),  and  level  of  current  corticosteroid  use  (≤  0.4  mg/kg  oral  prednisone  [or  equivalent]  or  > 
0.4 mg/kg oral prednisone [or equivalent]). The proportion of patients who  had an ACR30 at Day 15 
was  higher  in  the  canakinumab  group  (83.7%)  compared  with  the  placebo  group  (9.8%).  Patients  in 
the  canakinumab  group  were  more  likely  to  respond  to  treatment  compared  with  patients  in  the 
placebo group (odds ratio of 62.29; p<0.0001).

The  primary  analysis  was  repeated  using  an  unstratified  Fisher’s  exact  test.  The  results  revealed 
similar findings; the odds ratio was 47.57, in favour of canakinumab; the difference in proportions was 
-73.96%  (CI:  -88.26,-59.67)  (p<0.0001).  The  response  to  treatment  according  to  the  adapted  ACR 
Pediatric 30 criteria at Day 15 was summarized by stratification variable, age category, and gender. In 
general,  response  to  canakinumab  was  consistent  across  these  subgroups  including  the  youngest 
patients (2-<4 years of age). In fact, 7/9 (77.8%) of the patients in the youngest age category had an 
ACR70 or higher at Day 15 or Day 29. 
Corticosteroid usage at baseline did not affect response to canakinumab: the proportion of responders 
was 84.8% (28/33 patients) in the lower steroid use category and 80% (8/10 patients) in the higher 
steroid  use  category.  Note  that  the  proportion  of  responders  to  canakinumab  in  the  >26  joints 
category was lower (6/9 or 66.7%) but this may have been due to the low number of patients in the 
category  overall.  The  proportion  of  responders  in  the  ≤26  joints  category  was  88.2%  (30/34 
patients).There  were  a  total  of  6  patients  in  the  canakinumab  group  and  3  patients  in  the  placebo 
group  who  had  previously  used  and  discontinued  anakinra  due  to  lack  of  efficacy.  Of  these  patients, 
5/6 (83.3%) in the canakinumab group were ACR responders at Day 15 (2 with ACR50, 1 with ACR70, 
and 2 with ACR100); all 3 patients in the placebo group were non-responders at Day 15. 
Secondary efficacy results 
A  closed  testing  procedure  was  performed  for  secondary  efficacy  variables.  Each  of  the  steps  in  the 
closed testing procedure was satisfied, as shown in the table below. 
Closed testing procedure on secondary endpoints (Full analysis set) 
Response according to adapted ACR pediatric criteria 
The percentage of responders to treatment according to the adapted ACR pediatric criteria is shown in 
Figure 11-1. A majority of the canakinumab group achieved a minimum ACR70 at Day 15 (60.5%) and 
at  Day  29  (67.4%)  compared  with  one  placebo  patient  (2.4%)  at  this  ACR  level  at  the  same  time 
points. There was a much higher proportion of patients in the canakinumab group at each ACR level at 
Day 15 or 29 in comparison to patients in the placebo group. In the canakinumab group, there was a 
small decline in the proportion of patients who had an ACR30 from Day 15 to Day 29, an increase in 
the  proportion  of  patients  with  an  ACR50,  70,  or  90  from  Day  15  to  Day  29,  and  the  proportion  of 
patients with an ACR100 (33%) remained stable between Day 15 and Day 29.

In addition to the significance of canakinumab versus placebo demonstrated for ACR30 at Day 15, the 
proportion  of  patients  with  an  ACR30  at  Day  29  or  an  ACR50,  70,  90,  or  100  at  Days  15  or  29  was

Adapted ACR pediatric criteria response variables 
Physician’s global assessment of disease activity  
The  physician’s  global  assessment  of  disease  activity  using  a  0-100  mm  VAS  is  the  first  response 
variable  in  the  adapted  ACR  pediatric  criteria.  At  baseline,  the  median  values  were  67.0  mm  for 
canakinumab and 66.0 mm for placebo. Patient’s response to canakinumab  was apparent as early as 
day 3 at which time the median change from baseline was -25.0 mm for canakinumab (n=42) vs. -2.5 
mm for placebo (n=38). At Day 15, the median change was -40.0 mm for canakinumab (n=43) vs. -
2.0 mm for placebo (n=25). At Day 29, the median change was -43.0 mm for canakinumab (n=38) vs. 
-17.0 mm for placebo (n=7). The median percent changes from baseline were approximately -50%, -
69%,  and  -83%  for  canakinumab  vs.  -3%,  -5%,  and  -38%  for  placebo  at  Days  3,  15,  and  29, 
respectively.  
Note  that  the  number  of  patients  in  the  placebo  group  decreased  over  time  due  to  early 
discontinuation from the study for unsatisfactory therapeutic response. 
The physician’s global assessment of disease activity was also summarized by response to treatment, 
ACR criteria, age category and gender. In general, the results were consistent for all ACR responders 
at  Day  15  regardless  of  gender  and  age  (including  the  youngest  of  patients).  In  the  youngest  age 
category  (2-<4  years  of  age),  the  median  changes  from  baseline  for  canakinumab  were  -40.0  mm 
(n=9),  -42.0  mm  (n=9),  and  -56.0  mm  (n=7)  and  the  median  percent  changes  from  baseline  were 
approximately -80%, -93%, and -96% at Days 3, 15, and 29, respectively. There were no patients in 
the placebo group in the youngest age category. 
Patient’s global assessment of patient’s overall well being 
The patient’s (or parent’s) global assessment of the patient’s overall well-being using a 0-100 mm VAS 
is the second response variable in the adapted ACR pediatric criteria. 
At baseline, the median values were 63.0 mm for canakinumab and 61.0 mm for placebo. At Day 15, 
the median change was -36.0 mm for canakinumab (n=43) vs. 2.0 mm for placebo (n=25). At Day 29, 
the  median  change  was  -49.5  mm  for  canakinumab  (n=38)  vs.  -11.0  mm  for  placebo  (n=7).  This 
represented  a  median  -73%  and  -91%  change  from  baseline  for  canakinumab  vs.  1%  and  -17%  for 
placebo  at  Days  15  and  29,  respectively.  Note  that  the  number  of  patients  in  the  placebo  group 
decreased  over  time  due  to  early  discontinuation  from  the  study  for  unsatisfactory  therapeutic 
response. 
The patient’s (or parent’s) global assessment of the patient’s overall well-being was also summarized 
by  response  to  treatment,  ACR  criteria,  age  category,  and  gender.  In  general,  the  results  were 
consistent  for  all  ACR  responders  at  Day  15  regardless  of  gender  and  age  (including  the  youngest  of 
patients).  In  the  youngest  age  category  (2-<4  years  of  age),  the  median  changes  from  baseline  for 
canakinumab  were  -27.0  mm  (n=9)  and  -61.0  mm  (n=7)  representing  median  -94%  and  -97% 
changes from baseline at Days 15 and 29, respectively. There were no patients in the placebo group in 
the youngest age category.

Number of active joints 
The number of joints with active arthritis is the fourth response variable in the adapted ACR pediatric 
criteria.  At  baseline,  the  median  number  was  higher  for  canakinumab  vs.  placebo  (10  vs.  7).  At  Day 
15, the median number decreased by 6 for canakinumab (n=43) vs. none for placebo (n=41). At Day 
29,  the  median  number  decreased  by  5  for  canakinumab  (n=38)  vs.  1  for  placebo  (n=7).  These 
decreases  represent  median  -67%  and  -86%  changes  from  baseline  for  canakinumab  vs.  0%  and  -
32%  for  placebo  at  Days  15  and  29,  respectively.  Note  that  the  number  of  patients  in  the  placebo 
group  decreased  over  time  due  to  early  discontinuation  from  the  trial  for  unsatisfactory  therapeutic 
response. 
The number of joints with active arthritis was also summarized by response to treatment, ACR criteria, 
age  category,  and  gender.  In  general,  the  results  were  consistent  for  all  ACR  responders  at  Day  15 
regardless of gender and age (including the youngest of patients). In the youngest age category (2-<4 
years of age), the median number of joints with active arthritis decreased from baseline by 5 at Day 
15 (n=9) and 4 at Day 29 (n=7), which equated to a median -100% change from baseline at both time 
points  (i.e.,  the  median  number  of  active  joints  post  baseline  at  the  two  time  points  was  0).  There 
were no patients in the placebo group in the youngest age category. 
Number of joints with limited range of motion 
The number of joints with a limited range of motion is the fifth response variable in the adapted ACR 
pediatric criteria. At baseline, the median number was higher for canakinumab vs. placebo (8 vs. 6). At 
Day 15, the median number had decreased by 5 for canakinumab (n=43) vs. none for placebo (n=41). 
At Day 29, the median number decreased by 4.5 for canakinumab (n=38) vs. 1 for placebo (n=7). The 
median  percent  changes  from  baseline  were  approximately  -73%  and  -83%  for  canakinumab  vs.  0% 
and -33% for placebo at Days 15 and 29, respectively. Note that the number of patients in the placebo 
group  decreased  over  time  due  to  early  discontinuation  from  the  study  for  unsatisfactory  therapeutic 
response.  The  number  of  joints  with  a  limited  range  of  motion  was  also  summarized  by  response  to 
treatment, ACR criteria, age category, and gender. In general, the results were consistent for all ACR 
responders  at  Day  15  regardless  of  gender  and  age  (including  the  youngest  of  patients).  In  the 
youngest age category (2-<4 years of age), the median number of joints with limited range of motion 
decreased  from  baseline  by  4  at  both  Days  15  (n=9)  and  Day  29  (n=7),  and  the  median  percent 
change from baseline was -100% at both time points. There were no patients in the placebo group in 
the youngest age category. 
C-reactive protein (CRP) 
CRP  level  is  the  sixth  response  variable  in  the  adapted  ACR  pediatric  criteria.  CRP  values  were 
standardized  to  a  normal  range  of  0-10  mg/L.  At  baseline,  median  CRP  values  were  141.3  mg/L  for 
canakinumab and 136.9 mg/L for placebo. Patient’s response to canakinumab was apparent as early as 
Day 3 at which time the median change from baseline was -76.7 mg/L for canakinumab vs. -7.4 mg/L 
for placebo. At Day 15, the median change was -100.0 mg/L for canakinumab (n=43) vs. 5.7 mg/L for 
placebo  (n=25).  At  Day  29,  the  median  change  was  -132.0  mg/L  for  canakinumab  (n=39)  vs.  -15.0 
mg/L for placebo (n=7). The median percent changes from baseline were approximately -55%, -91%, 
and -91% for canakinumab vs. -4%, 5%,  and -13% for placebo at Days 3, 15, and 29, respectively. 
Note  that  the  number  of  patients  in  the  placebo  group  decreased  over  time  due  to  early 
discontinuation from the study for unsatisfactory therapeutic response.

Fever at Day 3 
All patients in the canakinumab group had a normal body temperature at Day 3 compared to 86.8% of 
patients  in  the  placebo  group.  The  difference  between  the  two  treatment  groups  was  statistically 
significant (p=0.0098). 
Pain intensity (0-100 mm VAS) as part of CHAQ 
At baseline, the patient’s mean pain intensity was 69.7 mm for canakinumab and 60.9 mm for placebo. 
At Day 15, the mean change was -50.0 mm for canakinumab (n=43) vs. 4.5 mm for placebo (n=25). 
At Day 29, the mean change was -56.9 mm for canakinumab (n=38) vs. -11.4 mm for placebo (n=7). 
The  mean  percent  changes  from  baseline  were  approximately  -69%  and  -80%  for  canakinumab  vs. 
40% and -27% for placebo at Days 15, and 29, respectively. Note that the number of patients in the 
placebo  group  decreased over  time  due  to  early  discontinuation  from  the  study  due  to  unsatisfactory 
therapeutic  response.  A  comparison  between  the  treatment  groups  showed  that  the  LS  means  in 
overall  pain  intensity  were  statistically  significantly  lower  in  the  canakinumab  treatment  group 
compared with the placebo group at Days 15 and 29 (both, p<0.0001). 
CHQ-PF50 
Health-related  quality  of  life  was  assessed  in  patients  aged  5-18  years  old  using  the  CHQPF50.  At 
baseline, the median CHQ-PF50 physical score was 19.2 for canakinumab (n=28) and 18.1 for placebo 
(n=35). At Day 15, the median change was 17.7 for canakinumab (n=28) vs. 1.2 for placebo (n=22). 
At Day 29, the median change was 23.5 for canakinumab (n=26) vs. 13.5 for placebo (n=6). Note that 
the number of patients in the placebo group decreased over time due to early discontinuation from the 
study for unsatisfactory therapeutic response. 
For  the  CHQ-PF50  psychosocial  score,  the  baseline  median  value  was  40.0  for  canakinumab  (n=28) 
and 44.9 for placebo (n=35). At Day 15, the median change was 7.2 for canakinumab (n=28) vs. -0.7 
for  placebo  (n=22).  At  Day  29,  the  median  change  was  8.8  for  canakinumab  (n=26)  vs.  2.1  for 
placebo (n=6). Note that the number of patients in the placebo group decreased over time due to early 
discontinuation  from  the  study  for  unsatisfactory  therapeutic  response.  A  comparison  between  the 
treatment groups showed that the LS mean changes from baseline over time in the CHQ-PF50 physical 
and psychosocial scores were both statistically significantly higher in the canakinumab treatment group 
compared with the placebo group (both, p<0.005). 
CHAQ disability score 
The CHAQ functional ability score is the third response variable in the adapted ACR pediatric criteria. At 
baseline,  the  median  values  were  1.6  for  canakinumab  and  1.5  for  placebo.  At  Day  15,  the  median 
change was -1.0 for canakinumab (n=43) vs. -0.1 for placebo (n=25). At Day 29, the median change 
was -1.1 for canakinumab (n=38) vs. 0.1 for placebo (n=7). Note that the number of patients in the 
placebo  group  decreased  over  time  due  to  early  discontinuation  from  the  study  for  unsatisfactory 
therapeutic response. The minimal clinical important difference (MCID)  for improvement cited to be -
0.19 (Brunner, et al 2005) was well exceeded at Day 15 in the canakinumab group, and further clinical 
improvement was seen at Day 29. The improvement observed at Days 15 and 29 exceeded the MCID 
by a factor of 5. 
A comparison between the treatment groups showed that the LS mean change from baseline over time 
in the CHAQ© disability score was significantly greater in the canakinumab treatment group compared 
with  the  placebo  group  (p=0.0002).  The  estimated difference  of -0.69  shows a  treatment  effect  over 
the course of the study that is approximately 3.6 times (range of 1.7 to 5.5 times) the cited MCID of -
0.19 (Brunner, et al 2005).

In general, the results were consistent for all ACR responders at Day 15 regardless of gender and age 
(including  the  youngest  of  patients).  In  the  youngest  age  category  (2-<4  years  of  age),  the  median 
changes from baseline for canakinumab were -1.0 (n=9) and -0.75 (n=7). There were no patients in 
the placebo group in the youngest age category. 
Ancillary analyses 
EQ-5D or EQ-5D proxy 
Health-related quality of life was explored over time by use of the EQ-5D (for patients ≥ 12 years of 
age) and EQ-5D proxy (for patients 8 - 11 years of age. The numbers of patients with data at baseline 
and  Day  29  were  22  in  the  canakinumab  group  and  25  in  the  placebo  group.  The  proportions  of 
patients  who  had  “some  health  problems”  at  baseline  and  “no  health  problems”  at  Day  29  in  the 
canakinumab  (n=20)  vs.  placebo  group  (n=4)  for  the  following  domains  were:  mobility  (59.1%  vs. 
4.0%),  self-care  (45.5%  vs.  4.0%),  usual  activities  (45.5%  vs.  4.0%),  pain  discomfort  (40.9%  vs. 
4.0%),  and  anxiety  depression  (22.7%  vs.  4.0%).  Overall,  the  results  were  consistent  with  those  of 
the CHAQ. 
PDSS 
The level of sleepiness was explored over time by use of the PDSS for patients 11-15 years of age. The 
number of patients with data is low overall, and no patients in the placebo group had data at Day 29. 
Mean values at baseline were 18.0 in the canakinumab group (n=7) and 14.0 in the placebo group 
(n=6). At Day 29, the mean change from baseline was -4.3 in the canakinumab group (n=6). 
Flare 
The occurrence of flare was an assessment during the course of the study, but it was not an endpoint 
of  the  study.  Some  patients  will  roll  over  into  the  longer  term  studies  CACZ885G2301  and 
CACZ885G2301E1, and flare will be evaluated further in those studies. 
The assessment was made in relation to the previous visit. 
Three patients in the canakinumab group flared, and the flare occurred at the last study visit (i.e., end 
of the study visit). At the time of the flare, two of the patients were ACR non-responders and the third 
was an ACR90 responder. 
• 
• 
• 
0051/00002 (ACR50 responder at Day 15; non-responder at end of the study [Day 29])  
0040/00002 (ACR100 responder at Day 15; ACR90 responder at end of the study [Day 30]) 
0083/00001 (ACR90 responder at Day 15; non-responder at end of the study [Day 29]) 
Of  these  three  patients,  Patient  0040/00002  is  the  only  one  who  flared  and  who  also  had  an  ACR 
responder  status  at  Day  29  (ACR90).  At  that  time  point,  the  physician's  global  assessment  had 
worsened,  CRP  increased  dramatically,  the  number  of  active  joints  increased  (to  2  compared  to  0  at 
Day 15), and the number of joints with limited range of motion increased (to 3 compared to 0 at Day 
15). Unlike ACR calculation, flare calculation was compared to the previous visit (i.e., Day 15). Thirty-
one patients in the placebo group flared. With the exception of one patient, all of these patients were 
non-responders at the time of the flare.

Inactive disease 
Inactive  disease  was  included  in  the  assessments  during  the  course  of  the  study,  but  it  was  not  an 
endpoint  of  the  study.  Some  patients  will  roll  over  into  the  longer  term  studies  CACZ885G2301  and 
CACZ885G2301E1,  and  inactive  disease  will  be  evaluated  further  in  those  studies.  At  Day  15,  14 
(32.6%)  patients  in  the  canakinumab  group  had  inactive  disease;  13  of  these  had  an  ACR100  and  1 
had an ACR90. Twelve of the 14 patients continued to have inactive disease at Day 29. One additional 
patient who had active disease at Day 15 had inactive disease at Day 29 when ACR status went from 
ACR90 to ACR100. No patients in the placebo group had inactive disease. 
Study G2301 
A  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo  controlled  withdrawal  study  of  flare  prevention  of  canakinumab 
(ACZ885)  in  patients  with  Systemic  Juvenile  Idiopathic  Arthritis  (sJIA)  and  active  systemic 
manifestations. 
Methods 
This was a multicentre two-part study with an open-label, single-arm active treatment (Part I) followed 
by a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven withdrawal design (Part II). In Part I, 
patients received a single dose of canakinumab (4 mg/kg) subcutaneously (s.c.) every 4 weeks. Part I 
had four subparts. Parts Ia and Ib aimed to induce and maintain at least an ACR30 response without 
steroid  tapering.  Part  Ic  aimed  to  reduce  steroid  dose  prior to the  potentially  long  duration  of  Part  II 
and  to  evaluate  steroid  tapering  in  responders.  Part  Id  was  designed  to  stabilize  patients  on  an 
achieved steroid dose before entering Part II (withdrawal period). In Part II, patients were randomized 
to canakinumab or placebo in a 1:1 ratio, and received a s.c. injection of canakinumab (4 mg/kg) or 
placebo every 4 weeks. 
The planned duration of Part I was a maximum of 32 weeks (Part Ia: 4 weeks;Part Ib: 4 weeks; Part 
Ic:  up  to  20  weeks;  Part  Id:  4  weeks).  The  actual  median  duration  for  all  patients  in  Part  I  was 
approximately 16 weeks (maximum of 33.3 weeks). 
The  average  planned  duration  of  Part  II  was  estimated  to  be  75  weeks  resulting  in  an  average  total 
study duration of 109 weeks. The actual median duration in Part II was approximately 31.6 weeks in 
the canakinumab group (maximum of 88.1 weeks) and 23.4 weeks in the placebo group (maximum of 
81 weeks). 
The  study  was  stopped  when  the  required  number  of  37  flare  events  had  occurred  in  Part  II  and  all 
eligible patients had completed Parts Ic and/or Id.

Part I (open-label treatment period) 
Part  I  was  an  open-label,  active  treatment  period  to  identify  canakinumab-treated  patients  who  met 
the  adapted  ACR  Pediatric  30  criteria  (ACR30)  at  Day  15,  and  to  allow  for  patients  who  continued  to 
maintain a minimum ACR30 response at Day 57 to taper their steroid dose. The maximum duration of 
Part I was 32 weeks, corresponding to a maximum of 8 doses of canakinumab. Part I had 4 subparts: 
Ia to Id. 
• 
• 
• 
Parts  Ia  and  Ib  aimed  to  induce  and  maintain  at  least  an  ACR30  response  without  steroid 
tapering. 
Parts  Ic  aimed  to  reduce  steroid  dose  prior  to  the  potentially  long  duration  of  Part  II  and  to 
evaluate steroid tapering in responders. 
Parts  Id  was  designed  to  stabilize  patients  on  an  achieved  steroid  dose  before  entering  Part 
II (withdrawal period). 
Part Ia 
Once patient eligibility was confirmed at screening, patients entered Part Ia and received the first dose 
of canakinumab (4 mg/ kg) s.c. on Day 1. The duration of Part Ia was 4 weeks. 
In brief, rollover patients eligible to enroll in Part Ia were the following: 
• 
• 
• 
placebo patients from CACZ885G2305; 
canakinumab  patients  in  CACZ885G2305  who  did  not  complete  the  study  or  who  were  non-
responders at Day 15; or  
patients  who  completed  study  CACZ885A2203  and  flared  ≥  6  months  after  their  last 
canakinumab dose 
No steroid dose tapering was allowed. Steroid doses were to remain stable for the full duration of Part 
Ia. 
Patients who met the ACR30 criteria at Day 15 continued in the study. Patients who did not maintain a 
minimum  ACR30  response  between  Day  15  and  Day  29  were  discontinued  from  the  study  but  were 
eligible to enter the extension study CACZ885G2301E1. 
Part Ib

Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/427081/2013

Patients who completed Part Ia and continued to meet at least an ACR30 entered Part Ib on Day 29. 
The  duration  for  Part  Ib  was  4  weeks.  Canakinumab  patients  who  completed  CACZ885G2305  and 
continued to meet a minimum adapted ACR30 were allowed to rollover into the study. No tapering of 
steroids was allowed. Steroid doses were to remain stable for the full duration of Part Ib. Patients who 
were steroid free and who completed Part Ib were able to enter Part Id directly. 
Patients who did not maintain a minimum ACR30 response between Day 29 and Day 57 during Part Ib 
were discontinued from the study but were eligible to enter the extension study CACZ885G2301E1. 
Part Ic (steroid tapering) 
Patients  who  completed  Part  Ib  and  who  entered  the  study  using  an  oral  steroid  entered  Part  Ic  and 
were observed for up to 20 weeks for their ability to taper/eliminate concomitant oral steroid use while 
maintaining an ACR30 response. Patients entering the study steroid-free could advance directly to Part 
Id. 
Rules for steroid tapering were as follows  
• 
• 
Steroid  tapering  was  initiated  if  the  patient  had  achieved  a  minimum  adapted  ACR  50  and 
no fever. 
For  oral  prednisone  (or  equivalent)  doses  >  0.1  mg/kg/day,  the  dose  was  tapered  at  0.1 
mg/kg  of  oral  prednisone  (or  equivalent)  per  week.  If  and  when  the  oral  prednisone  (or  equivalent) 
dose  was  at  0.1  mg/kg/day,  the  dose  was  reduced  to  0.05  mg/kg/day  of  oral  prednisone  (or 
equivalent)  for  1  week,  then  to  0.05  mg/kg/every  48  hours  for  the  next  2  weeks  and  then 
discontinued. 
Patients who did not maintain a minimum ACR30 response were discontinued from the study, but were 
eligible  to  enter  the  extension  study  CACZ885G2301E1  unless  the  loss  of  the  ACR30  response  was 
considered a consequence of steroid tapering. 
Patients eligible for entry into Part Id and Part II were the following: 
• 
• 
Patients  with  a  steroid  dose  >  0.8  mg/kg  oral  prednisone  (or  equivalent)  at  the  start  of  Part 
Ic who were able to reduce their steroid dose to ≤ 0.5 mg/kg oral prednisone (or equivalent). 
Patients with a steroid dose ≥ 0.5 mg/kg and ≤ 0.8 mg/kg oral prednisone (or equivalent) at 
the start of Part Ic who were able to reduce their steroid dose by at least 0.3 mg/kg/day oral 
prednisone (or equivalent) from baseline. 
• 
Patients  who  were  able  to  achieve  an  oral  prednisone  (or  equivalent)  dose  ≤  0.2  mg/kg/day 
at the end of Part Ic. 
Patients  who  were  unable  to  reduce  their  steroid  dose  to  qualify  for  Part  Id  and  Part  II  were 
discontinued from the study, but were eligible to enter the extension study CACZ885G2301E1. Patients 
who  were  able  to  taper  off  of  steroids  prior  to  completing  Part  Ic  and  who  maintained  a  minimum 
ACR30 entered Part Id. 
Part Id 
Steroid-free  patients  who  completed  Part  Ib  and  patients  who  completed  Part Ic  entered  Part  Id,  the 
duration  of  which  was  4  weeks.  No  tapering  of  steroids  was  allowed.  Steroid  doses  were  to  remain 
stable for the full duration of Part Id. 
Patients  who  did  not  maintain  a  minimum  ACR30  response  were  withdrawn  from  Part  Id,  but  were 
eligible  to  enter  the  extension  study  CACZ885G2301E1.  The  purpose  of  Part  Id  was  to  ensure  that 
patients had received at least 12 weeks of treatment with canakinumab prior to entering Part II, and

that patients who were on steroids were on a stable steroid dose for at least 4 weeks prior to entering 
Part II. 
Part II (withdrawal period) 
Patients  who  continued  to  meet  at  least  an  ACR30  at  the  end  of  Part  I  were  randomized  to  either 
canakinumab  or  placebo  in  a  ratio  of  1:1.  Patients  received  an  s.c.  injection  of  study  drug 
(canakinumab 4 mg/kg or placebo) on the first day of Part II and thereafter every 4 weeks. 
Randomization was stratified by oral prednisone (or equivalent) dose at the end of Part I (two strata: 
≤ 0.4 mg/kg, > 0.4 mg/kg) and degree of adapted ACR Pediatric response reached at the end of Part 
Id  (two  strata:  >  adapted  ACR  Pediatric  50  criteria  met  [e.g.,  ACR70,  90  or  100],  ≤  adapted  ACR 
Pediatric 50 criteria met [e.g., ACR 30 or 50]). 
Steroid  doses  were  to  remain  stable  for  the  first  24  weeks  of  treatment  in  Part  II  (i.e.,  no  steroid 
tapering was allowed).  
• 
• 
Patients  who  were  on  ≤  0.2  mg/kg  oral  prednisone  (or  equivalent)  maintained  their  steroid 
dose for the first 24 weeks as well as the remainder of Part II. 
Patients on an oral prednisone (or equivalent) dose > 0.2 mg/kg and ≤ 0.5 mg/kg and no flare 
after  at  least  24  weeks  participation  could  re-start  steroid  tapering.  Patients  who  flared  per 
definition or who did not maintain a minimum ACR30 response at any time during Part II, even 
if  due  to  steroid  tapering,  were  discontinued  from  Part  II.  They  were  eligible  to  enroll  in  the 
extension study CACZ885G2301E1. 
Patients who flared per definition or who discontinued from the study while in Part II were counted as 
having a flare event in the primary analysis. 
Patients  who  maintained  a  status  of  inactive  disease  for  at  least  24  weeks  in  Part  II  and  then 
discontinued could enter the extension study CACZ885G2301E1 (e.g., to taper their steroids). 
Study participants 
Male  or  female  patients  aged  2  to  <20  years  with  a  confirmed  diagnosis  of  sJIA  as  per  International 
League  Against  Rheumatism  (ILAR)  definition  at  least  2  months  prior  to  enrollment  with  an  onset  of 
disease  <16  years  of  age.  Patients  must  have  had  active  disease  defined  as:  at  least  2  joints  with 
active arthritis; documented spiking, intermittent fever (body temperature >38° C) for at least 1 day 
during  the  screening  period  within  1  week  before  study  drug  administration;  and  C-reactive  protein 
(CRP) >30 mg/L (normal range < 10 mg/L). 
No concomitant use of second line agents such as disease-modifying and/ or immunosuppressive drugs 
was allowed with the exception of: 
•

screening visit, and folic/folinic acid supplementation (according to standard medical practice of 
the center) 
• 
• 
Stable  dose  of  no  more  than  one  non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory  drug  for  at  least  2  weeks 
prior to the screening visit

Efficacy assessments consisted of the ability to taper steroids, flare events, the adapted ACR Pediatric 
response (components shown below), parent’s or patient’s assessment of pain based on the 0-100 mm 
VAS in the CHAQ©, and the CHQ-PF50. 
The  primary  efficacy  variable  for  Part  I  was  the  proportion  of  patients  who  were  on  oral  steroids  at 
entry into Part I and who were able to taper oral steroid as per protocol, from start of Part I to end of 
Part Ic. 
The primary efficacy variable for Part II was the time to a flare event in Part II. Flare events included 
flares as well as discontinuations from Part II of the study (for any reason other than inactive disease 
for at least 24 weeks in Part II). 
Sample size 
Anticipating  a  flare  rate of  25%  for the  active  group  and  70%  for  the placebo  group  at  week  24  and 
reasonable  assumptions  about  the  distribution  of  flares  (exponential  and  a  mixture  of  Weibull  and 
exponential), it was calculated that 37 events were to be observed in order for a log-rank test (with 1-
sided type I error 0.025) to detect such a difference in favour of the active treatment with 90% power. 
It  was  estimated  that  about  10%  of  the  patients  entering  part  I  were  steroid  free  and  that  90% 
qualified  for  tapering  steroids  before  entering  part  II.  Among  the  steroid  free  patients,  60%  were 
expected  to  respond  to  treatment  with  canakinumab  in  part  I,  45%  of  patients  on  steroids  entering 
part I qualify for steroid tapering, out of these patients 60% would successfully taper. Anticipating an 
overall 10% dropout rate, these assumptions resulted in about 214 patients to be enrolled into part I 
of the study in order to achieve about 58 patients to be randomized into the withdrawal part (part II) 
of the study. 
Randomisation 
Part  II  of  the  study  has  a  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  event-driven  withdrawal 
design. 
Patients  were  centrally  randomized  into  part  II  of  the  trial  in  an  1:1  ratio  (canakimumab:placebo) 
stratified for oral prednisone  dose at the end of part I ( ≤ 0.4 mg/kg / > 0.4 mg/kg) and degree of 
adapted ACR Pediatric response at the end of part I ( > ACR50 / ≤  ACR50). 
Blinding (masking) 
Part I was an open-label, active treatment period.  
Part  II  is  a  double-blind,  randomized,  event-driven  treatment  period.  The  following  blinding  methods 
were used: 
1. 
Randomization  data  were  kept  strictly  confidential  until  the  time  of  unblinding,  and  were  not 
accessible  by  anyone  else  involved  in  the  study  with  the  exception  of  the  independent, 
unblinded  pharmacist/nurse/physician  or  authorized  personnel  at  the  investigator’s  site  who 
prepared the study medication. 
2. 
The identity of the canakinumab/placebo treatments were concealed by the use of study drugs 
in  form  of  syringes  filled  with  reconstituted  canakinumab  solutions  that  were  all  identical  in 
appearance,  but  the  actual  canakinumab  (or  placebo)  vials  with  lyophilisate  were  supplied 
“open-label”.

Statistical methods 
The confirmatory analysis was done for part II of the study. The primary (null-) hypothesis of shorter 
time  to  first  flare  in  the  canakinumab  group  (compared  to  placebo),  versus  the  alternative  of  a 
prolonged time to flare under canakinumab (compared to placebo) was tested by means of a log-rank 
test stratified for the randomization strata applying a (one-sided) type I error of 0.025. In addition a 
COX-regression model (using randomisation strata as explorative variables) was used to calculate the 
hazard ration (HR) including the corresponding 95%-CI.  
If  the  primary  objective  was  achieved,  all  secondary  endpoints  in  part  II  were  assessed  in  a  closed 
testing procedure according to a pre-defined hierarchy to evaluate the superiority of canakinumab over 
placebo. Testing was continued as long as each test showed statistical significance at the 2.5% level. 
The  efficacy  analyses  were  performed  on  the  population  of  all  subjects  entering  study  part  II  who 
received a least one dose of study drug during this study part.  
The data from the open-label, active treatment (part I) were analysed descriptively. 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) for Part I (Full Analysis Set I) consisted of all patients who received at least 
one dose of study drug in Part I. 
The FAS for Part II (Full Analysis Set II) consisted of all randomized patients who received at least one 
dose of study drug in Part II. Following the intent-to-treat principle, patients were analyzed according 
to the treatment they were assigned to at randomization in Part II. 
There was no Per-Protocol Analysis Set.

had  participated  in  study  CACZ885A2203)  or  Part  Ib  (32  patients  who  had  received  canakinumab  in 
study  CACZ885G2305  and  completed  the  study).  Ninety-two  patients  using  a  steroid  at  baseline 
entered Part Ic and 103 patients entered Part Id.

The  primary  reason  for  discontinuation  from  Part  I  of  the  study  was  unsatisfactory  therapeutic  effect 
for  72  (40.7%)  patients.  All  72  patients  were  withdrawn  by  the  investigator  for  protocol-driven, 
efficacy-related  reasons  (i.e.,  no  initial  response  at  Day  15  [n=27]  or  loss  of  response  after  Day  15 
[n=15], steroid tapering failure [n=26], and pre-protocol Amendment 1, i.e., CRP ≥10mg/L [n=2] or 
flare [n=2])  
Most  of  the  72  patients  (46,  63.9%)  were  studied  further  after  entry  into  the  extension  study.  Note 
that patients who discontinued for failure to achieve an initial response at Day 15 in Part Ia were not 
allowed by protocol to enter the extension. 
Part II 
A total of 100 patients entered the randomized, double-blind withdrawal period in Part  II (50 in each 
treatment  group)  and  63  completed  (i.e.,  had  no  flare  event)  Part  II  (78%  canakinumab;  48% 
placebo) (Table 10-2). Patients were considered to have completed the study if they either i) achieved 
24 consecutive weeks of inactive disease or ii) were still active in Part II at the time of study closure 
(i.e.,  after  the  37  flare  events  were  achieved).  The  primary  reason  for  discontinuation  in  Part  II  for 
both  treatment  groups  was  unsatisfactory  therapeutic  effect  (22%  canakinumab;  40%  placebo).  All 
discontinuations due to AEs (n=4, 8%) were in the placebo arm. 
One  patient,  in  the  placebo  group,  was  discontinued  due  to  a  protocol  deviation  (unblinding  due  to 
serious adverse event of gastrointestinal viral infection) (Patient 0042/00101).

Recruitment 
First patient enrolled: 06-Jul-2009 
Last patient completed: 12-Sep-2011 
Conduct of the study 
The  study  protocol  was  amended  seven  times.  Previous  sections  of  this  report  describe  the  study 
conduct as amended. The key features of each amendment are summarized below: 
Protocol Amendment 1 was written to change the criteria for which a patient would discontinue due to 
flare  in  Part  I,  to  that  of  not  having  achieved  ACR30  response  or  not  maintaining  a  minimum  ACR30 
response. Also the stable steroid dose level that allowed a patient to taper off steroids after 24 weeks 
in Part II was lowered to a threshold of > 0.2 mg/kg/day. Lastly, the entry criteria for rollover patients 
from  the  CACZ885G2305  and  CACZ885A2203  studies  was  changed  so  that  the  requirement  of 
intermittent fever and CRP > 30 mg/L would not be applicable. 
Protocol  Amendment  2  was  written  to  ensure  patients  from  study  CACZ885A2203  could  continue  to 
receive  continuous  treatment  in  subsequent  phase  III  studies  provided  that  the  patient  did  not  meet 
the discontinuation criteria of CACZ885A2203 or the safety discontinuation criteria of CACZ885G2301. 
Protocol Amendment 3 was written to ensure that the joint counts were performed by a trained joint 
assessor,  who  should  not  be  involved  in  any  other  aspects  of  the  patient’s  care,  and  the  same 
evaluator was performing these assessments at all visits. Amendment 3 was retracted on 28-Oct-2009 
based on feedback from the health authorities. 
Protocol  Amendment  4  was  written  based  on  feedback  from  the  EMEA  to  update  the  following:  to 
replace “absence of fever” in the secondary objectives with “body temperature ≤ 38°C”; to ensure that 
patients  were  on  a  stable  dose  of  corticosteroids  for  at  least  3  days  prior  to  baseline;  to  clarify  the 
transition  of  CACZ885G2305  placebo  patients  to the  CACZ885G2301  study  if  they  did  not  maintain  a 
minimum  ACR30  response  between  Days  15  and  29;  and  to  clarify  the  handling  of  CACZ885A2203 
rollover  patients  when  there  was  a  gap  of  at  least  6  months  between  the  patient’s  last  dose  in 
CACZ885A2203  and  entry  into  CACZ885G2301.  Early  in  the  study,  the  criteria  for  eligibility  to  taper 
oral steroids included having a CRP level <10 mg/L. Protocol Amendment 5, released approximately 1 
year after the original protocol, eliminated this criterion so that patients who were doing well clinically 
were not unnecessarily exposed to higher steroid doses than required. Some patients who enrolled in 
the study prior to this amendment may have not have the chance to initiate steroid tapering (in Part Ic 
or Part II) or the chance to taper their steroids successfully in Part Ic. As such, however, the primary 
objective of Part I of the study, to assess if canakinumab allowed tapering of steroids as per protocol in 
at least 25% of the patients, was still met. This amendment also clarified the visits to be completed in 
Part I by steroid-free patients at study start. 
Protocol  Amendment  6  was  written  to  describe  the  implementation  of  an  adjudication  committee  for 
macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and follow-up to be conducted on MAS cases identified during 
the study. This amendment also provided information on ending the study in the event that there are 
patients still active in Part I at the time the 37th flare was reached in Part II. 
Protocol Amendment 7 was written to introduce the possibility performing an interim analysis, (which, 
in  finality,  was  not  performed).  This  amendment  also  adjusted  the  statistical  hypothesis  in  the 
statistical  methods  section  for  Part  I  to  be  fully  aligned  with  the  objective.  These  amendments  were 
not  considered  to  have  affected  the  interpretation  of  study  results  as  they  were  minor  and  occurred 
prior to study unblinding.

No other changes in study conduct occurred. 
Changes in planned analysis 
The following changes were made to the planned analysis: 
• 
A  supportive  analysis  for  Part  I  was  added  to  repeat  the  primary  analysis  for  patients  with 
steroid  level  >0.2  mg/kg/day  at  study  entry.  The  proportion  of  patients  who  successfully 
tapered steroid according to the protocol was tested one-sided against 25%. 
• 
The exploratory assessments of PDSS and EQ-5D state of health and utility scores (EQ- 5D for 
patients ≥ 12 years of age or EQ-5D proxy  for patients 8 – 11 years of age) for Part  II were 
conducted  by  means  of  an  analysis  of  covariance  of  the  change  in  score  from  end  to  start  of 
Part II, adjusted for baseline (date of randomization) measurement. This approach was chosen 
instead  of  a  repeated  measures  model  adjusted  for  visit,  because  of  the  low number  of  visits 
with PDSS and EQ-5D measurements (two visits only) during Part II. 
• 
Similarly,  the  analysis  of  covariance  model  with  repeated  measures  approach  to  evaluate 
between-treatment  differences  in  joint  erosions  was  not  conducted  due  to  the  low  number  of 
visits with x-ray measurements of hands and wrists. 
• 
• 
• 
The  same  notable  abnormality  for  calcium  was  selected  for  the  <16  years  old  as  for  the  ≥16 
years old. 
An  analysis  of  an  improvement  disability  score  (decrease  ≥0.19)  from  baseline  or  worsening 
(increase ≥0.13) from baseline, or neither a decrease nor an increase has been added. 
A post hoc sensitivity analysis was performed comparing the steroid calculations performed by 
Novartis  vs.  that  of  the  investigator-calculated  prednisone  equivalent  dose  in  the  clinical 
database. 
Protocol deviations – Part I (open-label treatment) 
The  majority  of  patients  had  at  least  one  protocol  deviation  in  Part  I  (72.3%),  most  of  which  were 
minor. Protocol deviations for exclusion from a per  protocol analysis were pre-defined although a per 
protocol analysis was not planned nor performed. A total of 8 (4.5%) patients had this type of protocol 
deviation: 4 patients with loss in ACR response (after an initial response) who were not discontinued, 2 
patients for whom steroid tapering was not initiated (based on investigator’s judgment) although they 
were eligible, 1 patient for whom steroid tapering was initiated although the patient was not eligible, 
and 1 patient who did not meet ACR30 at Day 15 and was not discontinued. 
Protocol deviations – Part II (double-blind placebo withdrawal period) 
The number of patients with at least one protocol deviation in Part II is 31 (62%) in the canakinumab 
group  and  33  (66%)  in  the  placebo  group.  Protocol  deviations  for  exclusion  from  a  per  protocol 
analysis were not planned nor performed. 
Baseline data 
Demographic and other baseline characteristics – Part I (open-label treatment) 
Baseline  demographics  of  patients  entering  Part  I  are  shown  in  the  table  below.  Most  (85.3%)  were 
Caucasian, gender was distributed comparably (45% male, 55% female), and the average age was 8.7 
years with a large proportion of patients aged 6-11 years (43%).

Prior use of biologic drugs, specifically anakinra, tocilizumab, etanercept, abatacept, and adalimumab: 
• 
A total of 83 (46.9%) patients had prior  use of anakinra; the drug  had been  discontinued for 
lack  of  efficacy  (n=37,  20.9%),  lack  of  tolerability  (n=20,  11.3%),  or  for  “other”  reason. 
Thirty-seven (20.9%) reported being a non-responder. 
• 
A total of 58 (32.8%) patients had prior use of etanercept; in most cases (n=56, 31.6%) it had 
been discontinued due to lack of efficacy with a few cases for “other” reason. Fiftysix (31.6%) 
reported being a non-responder. 
• 
• 
• 
A total of 10 (5.6%) patients had prior use of tocilizumab; the drug had been discontinued for 
either lack of efficacy or lack of tolerability 
A total of 9 (5.1%) patients had prior use of adalimumab and all had discontinued due to lack 
of efficacy  
No patients reported prior use of abatacept

Most patients had a relevant past or current medical history/condition coming into Part I of the study 
(80.2%). The most common histories by preferred term (i.e., ≥5.0%) were anemia (10.7%), varicella 
(9.6%), pyrexia (8.5%), arthralgia (7.9%), cough (7.9%), eczema (7.9%), histiocytosis hematophagic 
(preferred term for MAS) (6.8%), rash (5.6%), hypertension (5.1%), and abdominal pain (5.1%). The 
more common events were reported in a similar or slightly higher percentage of the patients who were 
taking  oral  steroids  at  study  entry.  The  profile  of  medical  histories  was  as  expected  for  this  patient 
population. 
Demographic and other baseline characteristics – Part II (double-blind withdrawal period) 
Baseline  demographics  and  disease  characteristics  of  patients  randomized  into  Part  II  are  shown  in 
Table  11-5  and  Table  11-6,  respectively.  Demographics  were  similar  between  treatment  groups 
although fewer patients were 4-5 years old in the canakinumab group (10%) compared to the placebo 
group  (22%)  and  more  patients  were  6-11  years  old  in  the  canakinumab  group  (48%)  compared  to 
the placebo group (36%). 
Disease history was broadly similar between the two treatment groups with the following exceptions: 
• 
• 
• 
The  median  time  from  sJIA  diagnosis  to  study  entry  (~2.7  years  for  canakinumab  vs.  ~1.8 
years for placebo) 
2 or more flares in the 12 months prior to study entry (58% of canakinumab patients vs. 40% 
of placebo patients) 
The  presence  of  systemic  signs  after  the  first  6  months  of  disease  (90%  of  canakinumab 
patients vs. 72% of placebo patients) 
Comparability  between  the  two  treatment  groups  showed  no  significant  differences  for  any  baseline 
demographic or disease characteristic.

Outcomes and estimation 
Analysis of efficacy – Part I 
Primary efficacy results – Part I (open-label treatment) 
The primary objective of Part I of the study was to assess if canakinumab allowed tapering of steroids 
as per protocol in at least 25% of the patients who entered the study taking a steroid. The objective 
was  achieved  as  44.5%  of  the  patients  who  were  taking  steroids  at  entry  into  Part  I  achieved 
successful steroid tapering at the end of Part Ic (p<0.0001; 90% CI: 37.1, 52.2) (Table 11-7). 
Of  those  patients  who  entered  Part  Ic  taking  an  oral  steroid,  62%  (57/92)  were  able  to  successfully 
taper their steroid dose. 
Table 32.  Oral steroid tapering in Part I (Full analysis set I) 
The  primary  analysis  was  repeated  including  only  those  patients  who  were  taking  steroids  >0.2 
mg/kg/day at study entry and the results were consistent. Of the 78 patients in this subcategory, 34 
(43.6%) were able to successfully taper their steroid regimen according to the protocol-defined criteria 
(p=0.0003; 90% CI: 34.0, 53.5). 
Novartis calculated the prednisone equivalent daily dose as an exploratory evaluation. The results of a 
post hoc sensitivity analysis were similar to those of the a priori analysis shown in Table 11-7: 43.8% 
of the patients who were taking steroids at entry into Part I achieved successful steroid tapering at the 
end of Part Ic (p<0.0001; 90% CI: 36.3, 51.4). 
Secondary efficacy results – Part I (open-label treatment) 
Steroid reduction 
Of the 128 patients taking oral steroids at study entry, 
• 
92 (71.9%) had a minimum ACR50 response at the end of Part Ib; of these, 87 were eligible to 
enter Part Ic and taper steroids 
• 
• 
10 (7.8%) had a maximum ACR30 response at the end of Part Ib; of these, 4 were eligible to 
enter Part Ic and taper steroids 
26 (20.3%) were non-responders at the end of Part Ib and were ineligible to enter Part Ic and 
taper steroids. However, 1 of the 26 non-responders did enter Part Ic (protocol deviation). This 
patient  (0034/00106)  who  was  not  a  successful  steroid  taperer,  was  still  a  non-responder  at 
the end of Part Ic and was then discontinued from the study. 
The number of patients who were steroid free or who had an oral steroid dose at a level of > 0mg/kg 
and ≤ 0.2 mg/kg or > 0.2 mg/kg at the end of Part Ic is shown in the table below. 
Ilaris 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/427081/2013

About one-half of the patients who entered Part I taking oral steroids had an oral steroid dose ≤ 0.2 
mg/kg at the end of Part Ic (66/128, 51.6%); the majority of these patients were steroid free (42/66, 
63.6%). 
The  majority  of  the  patients  who  entered  Part  Ic  taking  oral  steroids  had  an  oral  steroid  dose  ≤0.2 
mg/kg  at  the  end  of  Part  Ic  (66/92,  71.7%),  and  the  majority  of  these  patients  were  steroid  free 
(42/66, 63.6%). 
Table 33.  Oral steroid dose at end of Part Ic (Full analysis set) 
The level of steroid tapering achieved in successful steroid taperers is provided in the table below. Most 
of the patients who entered the study taking oral steroids at baseline were taking < 0.5 mg/kg/d. 
Table 34.  Level of steroid tapering in successful steroid taperers (Full analysis set I) 
As  shown  in  Table  11-8,  a  total  of  66  patients  were  either  steroid  free  (n=42)  or  on  a  low  dose  of 
steroids  (≤0.2  mg/kg/day)  (n=24)  at  the  end  of  Part  Ic.  Of  these  66,  a  total  of  53  patients  were 
successful steroid taperers (see table above). Therefore, a total of 13 patients were either steroid free 
(n=1) or on a low dose of steroids (n=12) at the end of Part Ic, yet they were not among the group of 
successful steroid taperers. The reasons may have included the following: 
patients were not eligible for steroid tapering (including not having a qualifying CRP level as required 
prior to  Protocol  Amendment  5  or  not  having  a  minimum  ACR50  at  the  end of  Part  Ic),  tapering  was 
not  initiated  at  the  investigator’s  discretion,  or  an  ACR  measurement  was  not  available  at  the  end  of 
Part Ic. 
For the 57 patients who achieved successful steroid tapering at the end of Part Ic, the median baseline 
dose  was  0.27  mg/kg/day,  and  the  median  change  from  baseline  was  -0.26  mg/kg/day,  a  median 
percentage change of -100% (see table below).

Effect on body temperature 
At Day 3 of Part Ia, nearly all of the patients with body temperature measurements had no fever (≤38° 
C) (139/141, 98.6%). The mean baseline body temperature for all 177 patients in Part I was 37.18°C. 
Response according to adapted ACR pediatric criteria 
At  Day  15  in  Part  Ia,  81.3%  were  responders,  58.3%  had  a  minimum  ACR70,  and  18.0%  had  an 
ACR100. 
At  Day  29  (end  of  Part  Ia/beginning  of  Part  Ib),  88.8%  were  responders,  68.8%  had  a  minimum 
ACR70, and 30.6% had an ACR100. 
At Day 57 (end of Part Ib), 94.3% were responders, 78.7% had a minimum ACR70, and 38.3% had an 
ACR100. 
The time spent in Part Ic, the steroid tapering phase of the study, varied depending on the success of 
oral steroid tapering. If successful, a patient would continue to Part Id; if not, the patient remained in 
Part Ic for the maximum time allotted (20 weeks). In general, during Part Ic, the proportion of patients 
with  a  minimum  ACR30/50/70/90  response  remained  fairly  stable,  however,  the  proportion  with  a 
minimum ACR100 decreased over time (e.g., from  28.8% [23/80] at Day 85 to 15.9% [7/44] at the 
last  Part  Ic  visit,  Day  169).  (Note  that  the  number  of  patients  with  data  decreased  over  time  in  Part 
Ic.) 
At  the  end  of  Part  Id  (Day  225),  100%  were  responders,  93.2%  had  a  minimum  ACR70,  and  55.3% 
had an ACR100. 
At  the  end  of  Part  I  (last  assessment  available):  77.1%  were  responders,  64.6%  had  a  minimum

Approximately  30-40%  of  the  patients  with  a  minimum  ACR50  or  ACR70  had  elevated  CRP  levels 
during the course of the study. 
About 50% of the 65 patients who achieved a minimum ACR50 or ACR70 and had a normalized CRP in 
Part  I  did  so  within  15  and  16  days,  respectively.  A  total  of  37  patients  had  previously  used  and 
discontinued  anakinra  due  to  lack  of  efficacy.  Of  the  37  patients,  5  entered  Part  Ib  directly  from 
CACZ885G2305  and  were  responders  at  Day  15  of  that  study.  Of  the  remaining  32  patients,  19 
(59.4%) were responders at Day 15 of this study (2 with ACR30, 4 with ACR50, 7 with ACR70, 2 with 
ACR90 and 4 with ACR100), 11 were non responders and 1 had a missing assessment (patient 40/110 
as discontinued at Day 4). 
The  level  of  adapted  ACR  pediatric  response  was  assessed  at  the  time  of  the  visit  by  a  standardized 
procedure  at  PRINTO/PRCSG.  These  data  were  recalculated  by  Novartis  after  database  lock  when  it 
could be assured that the data had been verified. Relevant differences in ACR response in Part I of the 
study were the following:  
• 
Five  patients  who  were  ACR  responders  per  PRINTO/PRCSG  were  non-responders 
(0059/00101,  0060/00102,  0040/00119,  0040/00103,  0040/00116),  and  two  patients  who 
were non-responders per PRINTO/PRCSG were ACR responders (0040/00108 and 0207/00101) 
at one or more visits following Novartis’ recalculation. 
CHAQ 
The CHAQ functional ability score is the third response variable in the adapted ACR pediatric criteria. At 
baseline, the median CHAQ score was 1.8. 
From the beginning of Part Ia to the start of Part Ic, the median change from baseline showed a strong 
improvement starting at Day 15 (-0.6, -54.4%) with further improvement at Day 57 (-1.0, -80.7%). 
During  Part  Ic  (steroid  tapering),  the  level  of  improvement  seen  earlier  in  the  study  decreased,  as 
reflected by the median change from baseline at Day 85 (-0.9 [-75.0% improvement]) and at Day 169 
(-0.8 [-61.5% improvement]), which would be expected as a result of the design of this portion of the 
study.

At  the  end  of  Part  Id  (Day  225),  the  median  change  from  baseline  was  -1.3  (-100%)  showing 
resumption of continued CHAQ score improvement for responders to canakinumab treatment. 
For  each  time  point  shown,  the  median  change  from  baseline  showed  a  treatment  effect  that  was 
several times the cited minimal clinical important difference (MCID) of -0.19 (Brunner, et al 2005). The 
median change from baseline at the end of Part I of -0.9 (-79.4%) indicates a treatment effect that is 
approximately 4.6 times the MCID. 
The degree of improvement seen with canakinumab treatment in the CHAQ disability score in Part I is

• 
From  the  beginning  of  Part  Ia  to  the  start  of  Part  Ic,  the  percentage  of  patients  showing  a 
MCID  of  improvement  was  high  and  increased  with  continued  canakinumab  treatment 
(103/140 [73.6%] at Day 15 to 118/141 [83.7%] at Day 57). 
• 
During  Part  Ic  (steroid  tapering),  a  MCID  of  improvement  was  seen  consistently  in  ≥80%  of 
patients  (e.g.,  65/80  [81.3%]  at  Day  85,  58/67  [86.6%]  at  Day  113,  43/52  [82.7%]  at  Day

• 
• 
At the end of Part Id (Day 225), the percentage of patients showing an MCID of improvement 
relative to baseline was 91/103, 88.3%. 
At the end of Part I (last assessment available), 135/175 patients (77.1%) showed an MCID of 
improvement in the CHAQ disability score. 
CHQ-PF50 
Health-related quality of life was assessed in patients aged 5-18 years old using the CHQPF50. 
For the CHQ physical health score: 
• 
From the beginning of Part Ia to the start of Part Ic, the median change from baseline showed 
an improvement starting at Day 15 (14.0 [+46.8%]) that increased over time (23.3 [+75.5%] 
at Day 57). 
• 
• 
During  Part  Ic,  an  improved  score  was  evident  despite  the  intervention  of  steroid  tapering 
(median changes from baseline of 26.1 (+80.8%) at Day 141 and 25.2 (+78.5%) at Day 197). 
At the end of Part Id (Day 225), the median change from baseline was 25.1 (+94.0%).

During Part Ic, an improved score was maintained despite the intervention of steroid tapering 
(median changes from baseline of 14.2 [+32.0%] at Day 141 and 11.9 [+29.2%] at Day 197). 
At the end of Part Id (Day 225), the median change from baseline was 11.8 (+30.6%). 
At  the  end  of  Part  I  (last  assessment  available),  the  median  change  from  baseline  was  8.2 
(+21.7%). 
Analysis of efficacy – Part II  
Part II of the study was a double-blind withdrawal treatment period. Patients were randomized in Part 
II  to  canakinumab  or  placebo  in  a  1:1  ratio.  It  should  be  kept  in  mind  that  patients  in  the  placebo 
group had received canakinumab in Part I of the study. 
Primary efficacy results – Part II (double-blind withdrawal period) 
The  primary  objective  of  Part  II  was  to  demonstrate  that  the  time  to  flare  was  higher  with 
canakinumab than with placebo. Patients who flared per definition or who discontinued from the study 
while in Part II (for any reason other than inactive disease were counted as having a flare event in the 
primary analysis. A total of 6 patients discontinued from Part II for reasons other than flare or lack of 
efficacy (loss of ACR response), and they all were in the placebo group: 4 due to adverse events, 1 due 
to protocol deviation (unblinding due to SAE), and 1 due to withdrawal of consent. 
The study achieved the primary objective of Part II. The probability to experience a flare event in Part 
II  was  lower  for  canakinumab  treatment  compared  with  placebo  treatment  (see  table  below).  This 
corresponds  to  a  statistically  significant  relative  risk  reduction  to  flare  of  64%  (hazard  ratio  of  0.36; 
95%  CI:  0.17  to  0.75;  p=0.0032).  The  median  time  to  flare,  which  was  236  days  for  the  placebo 
group, was not observed for the canakinumab group as less than 50% of patients experienced a flare 
event in Part II. 
Table 36.  Survival analysis of time to flare in Part II (Full analysis set II) 
The figure below shows that in the first 4 months in Part II, the probability to flare was similar in both 
treatment  groups.  Beyond  4  months,  the  rate  of  flare  remained  constant  for  the  placebo  group 
whereas only a few flares were observed in the canakinumab group.

The primary analysis was repeated whereby patients discontinuing the study for any reason (with the 
exception  of  flare)  were  censored  at  the  time  of  study  discontinuation.  The  results  showed  a  non-
significant  relative  risk  reduction  to  flare  of  49%  with  canakinumab  treatment  relative  to  placebo 
(hazard ratio of 0.51; 95% CI: 0.23 to 1.12; p=0.0445). 
Secondary efficacy results – Part II (double-blind withdrawal period) 
If the primary objective for Part II had been achieved, secondary endpoints were assessed in a closed 
testing procedure to evaluate superiority of canakinumab over placebo. This was performed in order to 
control the overall Type I error rate (α = 0.025, one sided tests) in the evaluation of these secondary 
efficacy variables. 
Testing for statistical significance was performed for the following secondary variables:  
1. 
2. 
3. 
Maintenance of adapted ACR Pediatric 30/50/70/90/100 criteria during Part II 
Change in disability over time by CHAQ© 
Change in HRQoL over time by CHQ-PF50© (physical and psychosocial summary scores) 
Only the first step in the closed testing procedure was satisfied, as shown in the table below.

Maintenance of efficacy 
A  survival  analysis  of  the  time  to  worsening  in  ACR  level  in  Part  II  is  shown  in  the  table  below.  The 
probability  of  experiencing  a  worsening  in  ACR  level  in  Part  II  was  lower  for  the  canakinumab  group 
compared with the placebo group. This corresponds to a statistically significant relative risk reduction 
of  51%  for  worsening  in  ACR  level  (hazard  ratio  of  0.49;  95%  CI:  0.27  to  0.90;  p=0.0131).  This 
satisfies  the  requirement  for  the  success  of  the  1st  endpoint  in  the  closed  testing  procedure.  The 
median  time  to  worsening  in  ACR  level,  which  was  141  days  for  the  placebo  group,  could  not  be 
observed  for  the  canakinumab  group  as  less  than  50%  of  patients  experienced  a  worsening  in  ACR 
level in Part II. 
Table 38.  Survival analysis of time to a worsening in ACR level during Part II 
The  figure  below  shows  that  in  the  first  2  months  in  Part  II,  the  probability  not  to  worsen  (i.e., 
maintain  ACR  response)  was  similar  for  both  treatment  groups.  Beyond  2  months,  the  probability  of 
patients to maintain their ACR response was greater with canakinumab vs. placebo. 
Figure 21. Kaplan-Meier  estimates  of  the  probability  not  to  worsen  in  ACR  response 
during Part II, by treatment (Full analysis set II) 
The  level  of  adapted  ACR  pediatric  response  was  assessed  at  the  time  of  the  patient  visit  by  a 
standardized  procedure  at  PRINTO/PRCSG  in  agreement  with  Novartis.  These  data  were  recalculated 
by  Novartis  after  database  lock  when  it  could  be  assured  that  the  data  had  been  verified.  There  was 
one relevant difference in ACR response in Part II: 
• 
One  placebo  patient  (0115/00101)  was  an  ACR  responder  per  PRINTO/PRCSG  and  a  non-
responder following Novartis’ recalculation (at one visit). 
CHAQ disability score 
The CHAQ functional ability score is the third response variable in the adapted ACR pediatric criteria. At 
the beginning of Part II, the median value at baseline in the CHAQ score was 0 for canakinumab and

0.1 for placebo. At the end of Part II (last assessment available), the median change from the start of 
Part  II  was  0  for  both  groups.  A  comparison  between  the  treatment  groups  showed  there  was  no 
difference  between  canakinumab  and  placebo  in  the  LS  mean  change  from  the  start  of  Part  II  over 
time in Part II in the CHAQ© disability score (p=0.4571) (see table below). The requirements for the 
success  of  the  2nd  endpoint  were  not  met,  and,  therefore,  the  4-step  closed testing  procedure  stops 
here. 
Table 39.  Change  in  CHAQ  disability  score  in  Part  II:  Repeated  measures  ANCOVA,  by 
treatment (Full analysis set II) 
The number of patients showing a MCID of improvement (decrease ≥ 0.19) or worsening (increase ≥ 
0.13)  in  the  CHAQ  disability  score  from  the  beginning  of  Part  II  showed  little  difference  between  the 
treatment  groups  as  far  as  a  MCID  of  improvement,  but  there  were  more  patients  with  a  MCID  of 
worsening  in  the  placebo  group  vs.  the  canakinumab  group.  At  the  end  of  Part  II  (last  assessment 
available), 7/50 (14.0%) patients in the canakinumab group and 6/50 (12.0%) patients in the placebo 
group showed a MCID of improvement, while 9/50 (18.0%) patients in the canakinumab group showed 
a MCID of worsening compared to 16/50 (32.0%) patients in the placebo group. 
The  results  of  a  repeated  measures  logistic  model  on  improvement  and  worsening  in  the  CHAQ 
disability score from the beginning of Part II showed no significant differences between the treatment 
groups for an MCID of either improvement or worsening. 
CHQ-PF50 
Health-related quality of life was assessed in patients aged 5-18 years old using the CHQPF50. 
• 
At the start of Part II, the median CHQ-PF50 physical score was 50.0 for canakinumab (n=40) 
and 50.8 for placebo (n=38). At the end of Part II, the median change from the start of Part II 
was 1.4 for canakinumab (n=39) vs. -3.1 for placebo (n=37). 
• 
For  the  CHQ-PF50  psychosocial  score,  the  median  value  at  the  start  of  Part  II  was  57.5  for 
canakinumab  (n=40)  and  55.4  for  placebo  (n=38).  At  the  end  of  Part  II,  the  median  change 
from the start of Part II was 0.1 for canakinumab (n=39) vs. -1.1 for placebo (n=37). 
A comparison between the treatment groups showed that the LS mean changes from the start of Part 
II  over  time  in  the  CHQ-PF50  physical  and  psychosocial  scores  were  numerically  higher  in  the 
canakinumab  treatment  group  compared  with  the  placebo  group  but  the  differences  were  not 
statistically significant (see table below).

Adapted ACR pediatric criteria response variables 
Physician’s global assessment of disease activity 
The  physician’s  global  assessment  of  disease  activity  using  a  0-100  mm  VAS  is  the  first  response 
variable in the adapted ACR pediatric criteria. 
At baseline, the mean value was 66.5 mm (n=177).

the  intervention  of  steroid  tapering  (e.g.,  68/79  [86.1%]  at  Day  85,  60/66  [90.9%]  at  Day 
113, 45/51 [88.2%] at Day 141, and 36/43 [83.7%] at Day 169).

• 
At  the  end  of  Part  Id  (Day  225),  the  percentage  of  patients  showing  this  level  of  decrease  in 
pain was 95/102 (93.1%). 
Overall  during  Part  I  (maximum  decrease),  152/174  patients  (87.4%)  showed  ≥  20  mm 
decrease in pain.

Part II (double-blind withdrawal period) 
Adapted ACR pediatric criteria response variables 
Physician’s global assessment of disease activity 
The  physician’s  global  assessment  of  disease  activity  using  a  0-100  mm  VAS  is  the  first  response 
variable in the adapted ACR pediatric criteria. The  median value was 0 mm  at the start of Part  II for 
both  treatment  groups  (n=50  for  each  group).  At  the  end  of  Part  II  (last  assessment  available),  the 
median change from the start of Part II was 0 mm for canakinumab and 0.5 mm for placebo (n=50 for 
each group. 
Parent’s or patient’s global assessment of patient’s overall well being  
The parent’s or patient’s global assessment of the patient’s overall well-being using a 0-100 mm VAS is 
the second response variable in the adapted ACR pediatric criteria. The median value was 2.0 mm for 
both canakinumab and placebo at the start of Part II (n=50 for each group). At the end of Part II (last 
assessment available), the median change from the start of Part II was 0 mm for canakinumab and 1.0 
mm for placebo (n=50 for each group). 
Number of active joints / number of joints with limited range of motion 
The number of joints with active arthritis is the fourth response variable and the number of joints with 
a  limited  range  of  motion  is  the  fifth  response  variable  in  the  adapted  ACR  pediatric  criteria.  At  the 
start of Part II, the median number of both variables was 0 for both treatment groups (n=50 for each 
group). At the end of Part II (last assessment available), the median change from the start of Part II 
was also 0 for both variables for both treatment groups (n=50 for each group).  
C-reactive protein (CRP) 
CRP level is the sixth response variable in the adapted ACR pediatric criteria. The median value for CRP 
(standardized in mg/L) was 5.0 mg/L for canakinumab and 7.9 mg/L for placebo at the start of Part II 
(n=50 for each group). At the end of Part  II (last assessment available), the absolute median values 
were 5.0 mg/L for canakinumab and 17.9 mg/L for placebo. The median change from the start of Part 
II was 0 mg/L for canakinumab and 2.1 mg/L for placebo (n=50 for each group). 
Pain intensity (0-100 mm VAS) as part of CHAQ 
The median value was 1.0 mm at the start of Part II for both treatment groups (n=50 for each group). 
At  the  end  of  Part  II  (last  assessment  available),  the  median  change  from  the  start  of  Part  II  was  0 
mm for both treatment groups (n=50 for each group). 
A  comparison  between  the  treatment  groups  showed  a  greater  decrease  in  the  parent’s  or  patient’s 
assessment of pain from the start of Part II in canakinumab group (LS mean change of -7.1 mm in the 
canakinumab  group  vs.  -3.6  mm  in  the  placebo  group),  but  the  difference  was  not  significant 
(p=0.0536). Overall during Part II (maximum decrease), 5 (10.0%) patients in the canakinumab group 
and  1  (2.0%)  patient  in  the  placebo  group  showed  a  ≥  20  mm  decrease  in  pain  on  VAS  from  the 
beginning of Part II. 
Exploratory efficacy results – Part I (open-label treatment) 
EQ-5D or EQ-5D proxy 
Health-related quality of life was explored over time by use of the EQ-5D (for patients ≥ 12 years of 
age) and EQ-5D proxy (for patients 8 - 11 years of age). 
Ilaris 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/427081/2013  
Page 85/165 
 
 
 
The mean EQ-5D state of health score at baseline was 41.9 (n=96). The mean change from baseline 
was 39.2 at Day 57 (n=76), 42.9 at Day 197 (n=40), 43.8 at Day 225 (n=54), and 35.3 at the end of 
Part 1 (last assessment available) (n=92). 
The  median  EQ-5D  utility  score  at  baseline  was  0.25  (n=96).  The  median  change  from  baseline  was 
0.45 at Day 57 (n=77), 0.45 at Day 197 (n=40), 0.48 at Day 225 (n=54), and 0.41 at the end of Part 
1 (last assessment available) (n=93). 
Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale (PDSS) 
The level of sleepiness was explored over time in Part I by use of the PDSS for patients 11-15 years of 
age. The mean value at baseline was 16.4 (n=33). The mean change from baseline was -4.3 at Day 57 
(n=26),  -5.1  at  Day  197  (n=14),  -3.6  at  Day  225  (n=21),  and  -2.5  at  the  end  of  Part  1  (last 
assessment available) (n=33). 
Growth velocity 
Although  the  impact  of  treatment  with  canakinumab  on  growth  velocity  was  an  exploratory  objective 
for Part I, this endpoint was evaluated in patients with the longest time duration in the study, i.e., in 
Part II. 
Physical development based on Tanner scale 
Although the observation period was small, no unexpected effects on physical development were seen. 
Exploratory efficacy results – Part II (double-blind withdrawal period) 
Inactive disease 
Over Part II, Kaplan-Meier estimates showed that the median time to inactive disease from the start of 
Part  II  was  30.0  days  for  canakinumab  vs.  33.0  median  days  for  placebo.  Although  there  was  no 
significant  difference  between  the  two  treatment  groups,  the  hazard  ratio  was  >1  indicating  a 
treatment  benefit  in  favor  of  canakinumab  (hazard  ratio  of  1.26;  p=0.1446).  Of  note  is  that 
approximately one-half of the patients entering Part II already had inactive disease at the start of Part 
II (26 patients in the canakinumab group and 27 patients in the placebo group). At the end of Part II, 
the  proportion  of  patients  who  had  inactive  disease  was  higher  in  the  canakinumab  group  (31/50, 
62.0%) compared with the placebo group (17/50, 34.0%). A statistically significantly higher likelihood 
of  inactive  disease  was  seen  with  canakinumab  treatment  compared  with  placebo  (CMH  test:  odds 
ratio of 3.4 (95% CI: 1.5, 8.0); p=0.0020).  
Patients  were  considered  to  have  completed  the  study  if  they  achieved  24  consecutive  weeks  of 
inactive disease. Twenty patients in the canakinumab group and two patients in the placebo group had 
at least 24 weeks of inactive disease during Part II and remained in the study.  
Growth velocity 
Part II of the study was chosen to evaluate growth as it was the longer of the two observation periods 
of  the  study.  The  impact  of  treatment  with  canakinumab  on  growth  velocity  was  evaluated  at  an 
exploratory  level  and  results  should  interpreted  with  caution  due  to  the  limited  number  of  patients 
available  to  observe  changes  in  height  and  the  limited  and  varied  time  of  observation.  In  addition, 
multiple  factors  such  as  age  during  the  observation  period,  onset  of  puberty,  nutritional  status, 
concomitant  medications,  etc,  influence  a  child’s  growth  and  would  need  to  be  taken  into 
consideration.

Canakinumab  appeared  to  have  no  negative  affect  on  height  as  reflected  by  a  small  but  positive 
increase  in  the  median  change  from  baseline  in  height  percentile  at  the  end  of  the  study  (+2.09) 
demonstrate that for the canakinumab group, the largest changes in height percentiles occurred in the 
two lowest categories. The percentage of patients in the canakinumab group who entered the study in 
the  lowest  height  percentile  category  (20th  percentile)  was  51%;  at  the  end  of  the  study,  the 
percentage had decreased to 39%. The percentage of patients in the canakinumab group in the 20th 
to <40th percentile category increased from 22% at baseline to 31% at the end of Part II. 
All of other higher height percentile categories increased slightly by a few percentages. For those in the 
placebo  group,  there  was  essentially  no  change  between  baseline  and  the  end  of  study  height 
percentile categories. 
The changes seen in weight and BMI percentiles were similar to those for height. 
Physical development based on Tanner scale 
No unexpected effects on physical development were seen. 
Joint erosions 
The  impact  of  treatment  with  canakinumab  on  the  progression  of  joint  erosions  in  the  affected  hand 
and/or  wrist  by  x-ray  is  an  exploratory  objective  for  Part  II  (in  a  subset  of  volunteer  patients). 
However, this endpoint will be evaluated at the pooled level, rather than the individual study level. 
EQ-5D or EQ-5D proxy 
Health-related quality of life was explored over time by use of the EQ-5D (for patients ≥ 12 years of 
age) and EQ-5D proxy (for patients 8 - 11 years of age).  
EQ-5D state of health score  
At the start of Part II, the median EQ-5D state of health score was 90.0 for canakinumab (n=28) and 
95.0 for placebo (n=25). At the end of Part II, the median change from the start of Part II was 1.5 for 
canakinumab and -4.0 for placebo.  
A  comparison  of  the  LS  mean  changes  from  the  start  of  Part  II  showed  no  significant  difference 
between  the  treatment  groups  in  the  EQ-5D  state  of  health  score  at  the  end  of  Part  II  (estimated 
difference of 9.60; 95% CI: -5.40, 24.59; p=0.1017). 
EQ-5D utility score 
At the start of Part II, the median EQ-5D utililty score was 1.0 for canakinumab (n=28) and 0.85 for 
placebo  (n=25).  At  the  end  of  Part  II,  the  median  change  from  the  start  of  Part  II  was  0  for  both 
canakinumab and placebo.  
A  comparison  of  the  LS  mean  changes  from  the  start  of  Part  II  showed  no  significant  difference 
between the treatment groups in the EQ-5D utility score at the end of Part II (estimated difference of 
0.12; 95% CI -0.05, 0.28; p=0.0869) 
Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale (PDSS) 
The level of sleepiness was explored over time by use of the PDSS for patients 11-15 years of age. The 
number of patients with data is low overall. At the start of Part II, the median PDSS score was 14.0 in 
the  canakinumab  group  (n=12)  and  11.0  in  the  placebo  group  (n=11).  At  the  end  of  Part  II,  the 
median  change  from  the  start  of  Part  II  was  2.0  in  the  canakinumab  group  and  0.5  in  the  placebo 
group.

A comparison of the LS mean changes from the start of Part II showed no significant difference 
between the treatment groups at the end of Part II (estimated difference of 0.3; 95% CI: -5.5, 6.1; 
p=0.5403).

Global Assessment of Patient’s overall 
wellbeing based upon the 0–100 mm VAS in 
the CHAQ© 
3. Functional ability: CHAQ© 
4. Number of joints with active arthritis using 
the ACR definition (The ACR definition of 
active arthritis is any joint with swelling, or in 
the absence of swelling, limitation of motion 
accompanied by either pain on motion or 
tenderness not due to deformity) 
5. Number of joints with limitation of motion 
6. Laboratory measure of inflammation: CRP 
(standardized to a normal range of 0-10

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Data from 178 subjects of the phase III trials G2305, G2301 and G2301E1 (not complete, data up to 
interim  database  lock  10-Aug-2012)  were  pooled  on  an  individual  level  because  most  patients  were 
enrolled  in  more  than  one  study  (i.e.,  these  patients  were  reported  once).  Patients  from  the  study 
A2203  who  rolled  over  into  G2301  were  excluded.  The  aim  of  the  combined  efficacy  analyses  is  to

evaluate  the  12-week  efficacy  of  canakinumab  in  canakinumab  treatment  naïve  patients  in  various 
subgroups  based  on  demographic  and  baseline  disease  parameters  and  characterize  specific  patient 
groups. 
Study populations 
The  main  combined  demographic  and  baseline  disease  characteristics  of  patients  in  the  12-  week 
efficacy  pooled  group  (see  table  below)  generally  matched  those  of  the  contributing  studies,  i.e., 
patients  with  active  disease,  often  severe  and  considered  to  have  a  poor  prognosis.  Patients  were 
predominantly  Caucasian  (84.8%)  and  56.2%  female,  with  a  mean  age  of  8.5  years.  Twenty-four 
(13.5%) of the patients were aged 2-<4 years. 
Table 43.  Demographic and baseline disease characteristics – 12 weeks efficacy pooled 
group (Full analysis set) 
Pooled study participation and withdrawals from the phase III program for the 12-week efficacy pooled 
group  are  shown  in  Table  3-10.  The  majority  (81.5%)  of  patients  completed  12  weeks  participation. 
The main reason for discontinuation from the phase III program was unsatisfactory therapeutic effect 
(16.9%).

Adapted ACR pediatric response/criteria components 
A clinically relevant, fast response to canakinumab treatment was seen in the 12-week pooled efficacy 
group  as  demonstrated  by  the  adapted  ACR  pediatric  response  at  Day  15  and  29.  Further, 
maintenance of that response was seen at Day 57 and 85 (Table 3-26). A minimum ACR30 response 
was  sustained  over  time.  An  improvement  in  response  was  also  seen  over  time,  particularly  at  the 
ACR90 and ACR100 level. The proportion of patients who achieved a status of “inactive disease” in the 
12-week efficacy pooled group was 20.2% at Day 15, 25.8% at Day 29, 30.3% at Day 57, and 28.1% 
(50/178) at Day 85 (Table 3-26). 
Median  changes  (median  %  changes)  (improvements)  from  baseline  in  the  adapted  ACR  pediatric 
criteria response components 1 through 6 and a high proportion of patients with an absence of fever in 
the preceding week (component 7) were seen in the 12-week pooled efficacy group at Day 15 and Day 
29,  including  improvement  in  both  arthritic  and  systemic  measurements  of  SJIA.  The  12-week 
combined efficacy data also shows improvements in  ACR components that extend beyond Day 29, at 
Day 57 and 85.

Table 46.  ACR response variables 1-7 (12 week pooled data) 
The majority of patients in the 12-week efficacy pooled group with a maximum ACR30 response at Day 
15  maintained  their  response  (≥ACR30)  beyond  Day  15:  Day  29  (13/17,  76.5%),  Day  57  (14/16, 
87.5%), and Day 85 (11/14, 78.6%). Moreover, most of these patients improved beyond Day 15, i.e.,

they  achieved  an  ACR50  response  or  greater:  Day  29  (11/17,  64.7%),  Day  57  (11/16,  68.8%),  and 
Day  85  (11/14,  78.6%).  The  majority  of  patients  with  a  maximum  ACR70  response  at  Day  15  also 
maintained their response (≥ACR70) beyond Day 15: Day 29 (33/37, 89.2%), Day 57 (31/37, 83.8%), 
and  Day  85  (30/36,  83.3%).  Many  of  these  patients  continued  to  improve  beyond  Day  15,  i.e., 
achieved an ACR90 or ACR100 response at Day 29 (15/37, 40.5%), Day 57 (18/37, 48.6%), and Day 
85 (21/36, 58.3%). 
A  large  proportion  of  patients  achieve  an  ACR70  by  Day  16  of  treatment  (58%).  The  proportion 
increases to 82% by Day 71. 
The probability of a patient to lose an ACR30 response after an initial response at Day 15 increases to 
7.8% at Day 16, 10.6% at Day 43, and 15.4% at Day. 
CHAQ clinically meaningful change 
A  high  proportion  of  patients  in  the  12-week  efficacy  pooled  group  showed  an  improvement  in  the 
CHAQ disability score (based on the cited minimal clinically important difference by Brunner et al 2005, 
defined as a decrease ≥ 0.19 from baseline): 72.5% at Day 15, 71.3% at Day 29, 67.4% at Day 57, 
and 64.6% at Day 85. 
CRP normalization 
Almost  all  of  the  patients  (172/175,  98.3%)  had  an  elevated  CRP  (>  10  mg/L)  at  baseline.  The 
proportions of patients with a CRP that was elevated at Day 15 and Day 29 were similar (62.9% and 
60.4%,  respectively).  The  proportions  decreased  to  43.9%  and  45.8%  at  Day  57  and  Day  85, 
respectively. 
Parent’s or patient’s assessment of pain (VAS) 
Summary statistics for the parent’s or patient’s assessment of pain using a 0-100 mm VAS as part of 
the CHAQ are provided for the 12-week pooled group in. Improvements in pain on VAS were observed 
starting at Day 15, with small further improvements seen over time. At baseline, the mean value was 
67.1 mm (n=178). The mean changes (mean % changes) from baseline were -44.5 mm (-61.7%) at 
Day 15 (n=174), -51.4 mm (-73.4%) at Day 29 (n=157), -53.3 mm (-79.6%) at Day 57 (n=142), and 
-55.2 mm (-83.0%) at Day 85 (n=134). 
Comparison of results in subpopulations 
Clinically  relevant,  fast  and  sustained  responses  to  canakinumab  treatment  as  demonstrated  by  the 
adapted ACR pediatric criteria were seen across subgroups of age (including the youngest of patients, 
2-<4  years  of  age,  as  well  as  patients  2,  3,  and  4  years  of  age)  gender,  race,  body  weight,  disease 
duration,  active  disease  joint  count,  baseline  oral  steroid  level,  prior  reported  treatment  (anakinra, 
steroids [oral or i.v.], methotrexate, or NSAIDs), as well as concomitant therapy (oral steroids and/or 
methotrexate) consistent with the overall efficacy seen in the 12-week efficacy pooled group. 
Methods of subgroup analysis in the pooled group 
Data  on  ACR  pediatric  response  criteria  were  pooled  from  the  two  pivotal  studies  G2305  and  G2301 
and  the  long-term  extension  study  G2301E1  (12-week  efficacy  pooled  group)  to  better  evaluate  the 
efficacy  of  canakinumab  in  various  subgroups.  Comparisons  were  made  both  within  and  across  the 
respective  subgroups.  Analysis  of  the  12-week  efficacy  pooled  group  was  performed  for the  following 
subgroups based on baseline characteristics: 
•

Demographic factors 
Age 
Clinically  relevant,  fast  and  sustained  responses  to  canakinumab  treatment  as  demonstrated  by  the 
adapted ACR pediatric criteria were seen across the age groups at Days 15, 29, 57, and 85. 
Gender 
Clinically  relevant,  fast  and  sustained  responses  to  canakinumab  treatment  as  demonstrated  by  the 
adapted ACR pediatric criteria were seen for both genders at Days 15, 29, 57 and 85. 
Race 
Clinically  relevant,  fast,  and  sustained  responses  to  canakinumab  treatment  as  demonstrated  by  the 
adapted  ACR  pediatric  criteria  were  seen  at  Days  15,  29,  57,  and  85  for  both  Caucasians  and  non-
Caucasians with no relevant differences in response rates seen between the two groups. Note that the 
number  of  patients  who  were  Caucasian  was  large  (n=151)  in  comparison  to  those  who  were  non-
Caucasian (n=27). 
Body weight 
Clinically  relevant,  fast,  and  sustained  responses  to  canakinumab  treatment  as  demonstrated  by  the 
adapted  ACR  pediatric  criteria  were  seen  at  Day  15  and  Day  29  across  the  body  weight  groups 
although  response  rates  were  generally  higher  for  patients  weighing  >  40  kg  compared  to  patients

weighing  ≤  40  kg.  Note  that  the  number  of  patients  who  weighed  >  40  kg  was  small  (n=46)  in 
comparison to those who weighed ≤ 40 kg (n=132). 
Baseline disease factors 
Disease duration 
Clinically  relevant,  fast  and  sustained  responses  to  canakinumab  treatment  as  demonstrated  by  the 
adapted  ACR  pediatric  criteria  were  seen  at  Day  15,  29,  57  and  85  in  the  12-week  pooled  efficacy 
group for patients with ≤ 6 or > 6 months disease duration. 
Number of joints with active arthritis 
Clinically  relevant,  fast  and  sustained  responses  to  canakinumab  treatment  as  demonstrated  by  the 
adapted  ACR  pediatric  criteria  were  seen  at  Day  15,  29,  57  and  85  in  the  12-week  pooled  efficacy 
group  for  patients  with  ≤10  or  >10  active  joints.  The  response  rates  for  patients  with  a  lower  joint 
count were generally higher compared to those with a higher joint count. 
Baseline oral steroid level 
Clinically  relevant,  fast  and  sustained  responses  to  canakinumab  treatment  as  demonstrated  by  the 
adapted  ACR  pediatric  criteria  were  seen  at  Day  15,  29,  57  and  85  in  the  12-week  pooled  efficacy 
group  regardless  of  baseline  oral  steroid  use/dose.  In  general,  ACR  response  rates  were  higher  for 
steroid-free patients compared with those using oral steroids at baseline, and those in the higher oral 
steroid  dose  level  category  (>0.4  mg/kg/day)  had  lower  response  rates  compared  to  those  on  lower 
steroid  doses  (≤0.4  mg/kg/day),  a  trend  that  was  more  apparent  the  higher  the  ACR  response  level 
achieved. 
Previous exposure to other therapies 
Clinically  relevant,  fast  and  sustained  responses  to  canakinumab  treatment  as  demonstrated  by  the 
adapted  ACR  pediatric  criteria  were  seen  at  Day  15,  29,  57  and  85  in  the  12-week  pooled  efficacy 
group in subgroups of previous exposure to other therapies, consistent with the overall efficacy seen in 
the 12-week efficacy pooled group. 
Previous exposure to anakinra, tocilizumab 
Clinically  relevant,  fast  and  sustained  responses  to  canakinumab  treatment  as  demonstrated  by  the 
adapted  ACR  pediatric  criteria  were  seen  at  Day  15,  29,  57  and  85  regardless  of  previous  anakinra 
exposure. ACR response rates were generally lower in patients who discontinued anakinra due to lack 
of efficacy compared with patients who discontinued anakinra for other reasons or patients who were 
never exposed to anakinra. Note that the numbers of patients who discontinued anakinra due to lack of 
efficacy (n=32) is small in comparison to those who were never exposed (n=100). 
Prior reported steroid use 
Clinically  relevant,  fast  and  sustained  responses  to  canakinumab  treatment  as  demonstrated  by  the 
adapted ACR pediatric criteria were seen at Day 15, 29, 57 and 85 regardless of prior reported steroid 
(oral and/or i.v.) use. Response rates were generally comparable for patients with or without prior use 
although  there  is  some  variability  between  the  two  groups  at  higher  ACR  response  levels  (ACR70, 
ACR90, ACR100) suggesting that those without prior steroid use have higher response rates compared 
to those with prior use. Patients requiring steroids, however, tend to have a more severe disease state 
than those not requiring steroids. The number of patients with no prior use is small (n=31) compared 
to those with prior use (n=147).

Clinically  relevant,  fast  and  sustained  responses  to  canakinumab  treatment  as  demonstrated  by  the 
adapted  ACR  pediatric  criteria  were  seen  at  Day  15,  29,  57  and  85  regardless  of  prior  reported  MTX 
treatment  (Table  3-40).  Response  rates  were  generally  comparable  for  patients  with  or  without  prior 
MTX  use  although  there  is  some  variability  between  the  two  groups  at  higher  ACR  response  levels 
(ACR70,  ACR90,  ACR100)  suggesting  that  those  without  prior  MTX  use  have  higher  response  rates 
compared  to  those  with  prior  use.  Patients  requiring  MTX,  however,  tend  to  have  a  more  severe 
disease state than those not requiring MTX.  
Prior reported NSAID use 
Clinically  relevant,  fast  and  sustained  responses  to  canakinumab  treatment  as  demonstrated  by  the 
adapted  ACR  pediatric  criteria  were  seen  at  Day  15,  29,  57  and  85  regardless  of  prior  NSAID  use. 
Response rates were generally comparable for patients with or without prior NSAID use although there 
is  some  variability  between  the  two  groups  at  higher  ACR  response  levels  (ACR70,  ACR90,  ACR100) 
suggesting  that  those  without  prior  NSAID  use  have  higher  response  rates  compared  to  those  with 
prior use. The number of patients with no prior use is small (n=45) compared to those with prior use 
(n=133). 
Prior reported steroid, MTX, or NSAID use 
Clinically  relevant,  fast  and  sustained  responses  to  canakinumab  treatment  as  demonstrated  by  the 
adapted ACR pediatric criteria were seen at Day 15, 29, 57 and 85 regardless of prior reported steroid 
(oral and/or i.v.), MTX, or NSAID use. Response rates were generally comparable for patients with or 
without  prior  use  although  there  is  some  variability  between  the  two  groups  at  higher  ACR  response 
levels (ACR70, ACR90, ACR100) suggesting that those without prior steroid use have higher response 
rates  compared  to  those  with  prior  use.  Patients  requiring  steroids,  however,  tend  to  have  a  more 
severe disease state than those not requiring steroids. The number of patients with no prior use is very 
small (n=6) compared to those with prior use (n=172). 
Canakinumab and concomitant therapies 
Clinically  relevant,  fast  and  sustained  responses  to  canakinumab  treatment  as  demonstrated  by  the 
adapted  ACR  pediatric  criteria  were  seen  at  Day  15,  29,  57  and  85  in  subgroups  of  concomitant 
therapy use, consistent with the overall efficacy seen in the 12-week efficacy pooled group. 
ACR30  response  rates  were  higher  in  patients  who  used  canakinumab  monotherapy  as  well  as 
canakinumab+steroids+MTX  compared  with  canakinumab+steroids  and  canakinumab+MTX.  For  the 
higher  ACR  categories  (ACR70-ACR100),  response  rates  were  higher  in  patients  who  used 
canakinumab  monotherapy  compared  to  all  three  other  concomitant  use  subcategories,  and  the 
response rates were lowest in patients using canakinumab+steroids+MTX. The number of patients who 
used  canakinumab+MTX  was  small  (n=19)  as  well  as  for  those  who  used  canakinumab  monotherapy 
(n=29)

Outcome during treatment phase 
Clinically relevant, fast and sustained responses to canakinumab treatment were seen at Day 15, 29, 
57  and  85  in  patients  whose  CRP  normalized  (<10  mg/L)  or  was  elevated  (≥10  mg/L)  at  Day  15, 
consistent  with  the  overall  efficacy  seen  in  the  12-week  efficacy  pooled  group.  ACR  response  rates 
were generally lower for patients with an elevated CRP at Day 15 compared with those whose CRP was 
normal at Day 15, a trend that was more apparent the higher the ACR response level achieved. 
Selected  demographic  and  baseline  disease  characteristics  in  the  12-week  efficacy  pooled  group  are 
summarized by CRP normalization at Day 15 in Table 3-45. Patients who had an elevated CRP at Day 
15  tended  to  be  female  (59.5%)  and  of  a  lower  weight  (≤40  kg,  80.2%)  compared  to  those  with  a 
normal CRP at Day 15 (48.4% female and 64.1% weighing ≤40 kg). Those whose CRP levels did not 
normalize at Day 15 also appeared to have a more active disease state at baseline as they had higher 
values  in  ACR  components,  and  a  higher  proportion  were  receiving  MTX,  steroids,  or  NSAIDs  at 
baseline.

Supportive study 
Long-term efficacy data  
Study G2301E1, an extension study to the 2 pivotal studies G2305 and G2301, provided further data 
to  confirm  the  long-term  efficacy  and  safety  of  canakinumab  4  mg/kg  every  4  weeks.  The  study  is 
ongoing and the results presented here are of an IA including data up to the time of interim database 
lock, 10-Aug-2012. 
The  median  duration  in  the  study  at  the  time  of  interim  database  lock  was  49  weeks  (range  3-  144 
weeks). All of the 147 patients received at least one dose of 4 mg/kg; 33 patients (22.4%) received 1-
4  doses,  19  patients  (12.9%)  received  5-8  doses,  30  patients  (20.4%)  received  9-12  doses,  and  28 
patients (19.0%) received 13-16 doses. The remainder of patients received 17 or more doses. 
Study G2301E1 enrolled patients who previously participated in studies G2301 or G2305. Patients were 
randomized  to  canakinumab  or  placebo  in  study  G2301  Part  II;  both  canakinumab  and  placebo 
patients were allowed to enter study G2301E1. In study G2305, patients who had been randomized to 
canakinumab were allowed to enter study G2301E1. Patients were allocated into 1 of 4 analysis groups 
according  to  their  status  at  the  end  of  their  participation  in  the  previous  study.  The  rate  of 
discontinuation due to unsatisfactory therapeutic effect was highest in Group  3 (47.5%) compared to 
the  other  groups  (Group  1:  15.2%;  Group  2:  1.6%;  and  Group  4:  18.2%).  The  patients  in  Group  3 
entered  the  extension  study  from  study  G2301  Part  I  as  steroid  tapering  failures  and  as  such  had  a 
comparatively poorer prognosis. 
In  general,  baseline  demographic  and  characteristics  were  similar  for  the  4  analysis  groups.  The 
majority of patients were Caucasian, and slightly more than half were female. The mean age was 9.5 
years.  Patients  in  Group  2  came  into  the  extension  study  from  study  G2301  Part  II  with  a  minimum 
ACR30 response, and as such their level of disease was less active in comparison to the 3 other groups 
(e.g., lower CRP, lower number of affected joints, and less need for steroids). 
Exploratory efficacy: Response according to adapted ACR pediatric criteria in study G2301E1 
Most  of  the  patients  who  entered  the  extension  study  as  non-responders  regained  their  responder 
status at Month 3 (25/40, 62.5%). A substantial proportion achieved a minimum ACR70 (18/25, 72%), 
ACR90 (12/25, 48%), or ACR100 (7/25, 28%). 
Group  1 comprises 33 patients who discontinued prematurely due to flare from study G2301 Part II. 
Of  the  33,  10  had  been  randomized  to  canakinumab  and  23  had  been  randomized  to  placebo  at  the 
start of Part II. 
Approximately half of the 33 patients (48.5%) were ongoing and 5 (15.2%) completed 96 weeks of the 
study  at  the  time  of  IA  database  lock.  Five  patients  (15.2%)  discontinued  due  to  unsatisfactory 
therapeutic  effect,  four  (12.1%)  discontinued  due  to  AEs,  one  patient  (3.0%)  discontinued  due  to  a 
protocol deviation, and two patients (6.1%) withdrew consent. 
Even though these patients flared in study G2301 Part II, most who entered as a nonresponder were 
able to regain their response in the extension study. At Month 3, 12/17 patients (70.6%) who entered 
the  extension  as  a  non-responder  achieved  a  minimum  ACR30  response  and  10  (58.8%)  had  a 
minimum ACR70 response. At Month 6, 10/13 (76.9%) had a minimum ACR70. At the time of interim 
database lock, 10/17 patients (58.8%) had a minimum ACR70.

Group 2 comprises 63 patients who were minimum ACR30 responders at the time study G2301 Part II 
completed. Of the 63, 39 had been randomized to canakinumab and 24 had been randomized to 
placebo at the start of Part II. The majority of the 63 patients (93.7%) in this group were ongoing at 
the time of IA database lock. Four patients (6.3%) discontinued the study. One patient discontinued 
due to an adverse event (AE), and another patient due to an unsatisfactory therapeutic effect. Two 
patients’ condition no longer required study drug.  
A large majority achieved a minimum ACR30 response at Month 3 (62/63, 98.4%) as well as 
maintained an ACR90 response or better throughout the study until interim database lock (60/63, 
95.2%). 
Group  3  comprises  40  patients  defined  as  steroid  tapering  failures  in  study  G3201  Part  I  (includes 
patients  who  did  not  reach  Part  Ic).  All  40  patients  received  canakinumab  treatment  in  Part  I. 
Approximately  one-quarter  of  the  40  patients  (27.5%)  were  ongoing  and  six  patients  (15.0%) 
completed 96 weeks of the study at the time of IA database lock. Unsatisfactory therapeutic effect led 
to  the discontinuation  of 19/40 patients  (47.5%).  Two  patients  (5.0%)  discontinued  prematurely  due 
to AEs and two patients (5.0%) withdrew consent. 
At Month 3, 9/16 (56.3%) who entered the extension as a non-responder achieved a minimum ACR30 
response. At Month 6, 8/9 (88.9%) had a minimum ACR30 response. 
Group  4  is  a  mixed  group  of  11  patients  who  did  not  fulfill  the  criteria  for  any  of  the  other  analysis 
groups.  Of  the  11  patients,  8  came  from  study  G2301,  3  came  from  study  G2305,  and  all  had 
previously  received  canakinumab  treatment.  Less  than  half  of  the  11  patients  (36.4%)  were  ongoing 
and four patients (36.4%) completed 96 weeks of the study at the time of IA database lock. Only two 
patients  (18.2%)  discontinued  prematurely  due  to  unsatisfactory  therapeutic  effect  and  one  patient 
(9.1%) withdrew consent. 
Of the 6 patients who were non-responders at extension study entry, 4 (66.7%) achieved a minimum 
ACR30 response at Month 3; all had a minimum ACR70 response. 
Exploratory efficacy: canakinumab dose reduction in study G2301E1 
Canakinumab dose reduction in extension study G2301E1 from 4 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg was permitted in 
steroid-free  patients  only  when  the  treating  physician  requested  it  and  Novartis  agreed  that  this  was 
within study design and protocol allowance. 
Twenty-six  patients  received  at  least  three  consecutive  2  mg/kg  doses  (no  patient  received  only  two 
consecutive  reduced  doses).  The  mean/median  number  of  reduced  doses  received  was  10/9  and  the 
mean/median  number  of  days  of  exposure  to  the  reduced  dose  was  268/224.5.  The  age  of  the  26 
patients ranged from 4 to 19 years and eight were aged 4 to 6 years. All 26 patients had an ACR100 
throughout  the  time  the  reduced  dose  was  given.  No  patient  who  received  a  reduced  canakinumab 
dose discontinued from the study due to unsatisfactory therapeutic effect. 
Exploratory efficacy: Steroid reduction in study G2301E1 
Steroid tapering was optional in extension study G2301E1 and was permitted only if the patient had a 
minimum ACR50 response and no fever. The mean and median steroid levels decreased from baseline 
of  the  extension  study  to  the  time  of  interim  database  lock  (last  observation),  and  some  patients 
successfully tapered or eliminated their steroid dose. 
Overall,  69  patients  entered  the  extension  study  on  oral  steroids.  Twenty  of  these  (29.0%)  were 
steroid-free and 13 (18.8%) were able to successfully reduce their steroid dose at the time of interim 
database  lock.  Twenty-seven  (39.1%)  did  not  attempt  tapering  and  9  (13.0%)  failed  an  attempt  at 
steroid tapering. Details by analysis group are as follows:

Group  1:  Twelve  of  the  33  patients  (36.4%)  in  this  group  were  on  oral  steroids  upon  entering  the 
extension  study.  Of  the  12,  2  (16.7%)  successfully  tapered  their  steroid  dose  and  4  (33.3%)  were 
steroid-free  at  interim  database  lock.  One  patient  (8.3%)  was  unsuccessful  and  5  (41.7%)  did  not 
attempt  tapering.  The  median  steroid  dose  at  extension  study  baseline  was  0.195  mg/kg/day;  the 
median percent change from baseline to interim database lock was −21%. 
Group  2:  Nine  of  the  63  patients  (14.3%)  in  this  group  were  on  oral  steroids  upon  entering  the 
extension  study.  Of  the  9,  1  patient  (11.1%)  successfully  tapered  their  steroid  dose  and  4  (44.4%) 
was steroid-free at interim database lock. Four patients (44.4%) did not attempt tapering. The median 
steroid  dose  at  extension  study  baseline  was  0.080  mg/kg/day;  the  median  percent  change  from 
baseline to interim database lock was −75%. 
Group  3: All 40 patients in this group were on steroid treatment upon entering the extension study. 
Seven  of  the  40  (17.5%)  successfully  tapered  their  dose  and  10  (25%)  were  steroid-free  at  interim 
database  lock.  Seven  (17.5%)  patients  were  unsuccessful  in  tapering  and  16  (40%)  patients  did  not 
attempt steroid tapering. The median steroid dose at extension study baseline was 0.380 mg/kg/day; 
the median percent change from baseline to interim database lock was −24%. 
Group 4: Eight of the 11 (72.7%) patients in this group were on oral steroids at study entry. Of the 8, 
3  (37.5%)  successfully  tapered  their  steroid  dose  and  2  (25.0%)  were  steroid  free  at  the  time  of 
interim database lock. One was unsuccessful in tapering and two did not attempt tapering. The median 
steroid  dose  at  extension  study  baseline  was  0.355  mg/kg/day;  the  median  percent  change  from 
baseline to interim database lock was −16%.  
Exploratory efficacy: Inactive disease in study G2301E1 
Many  patients  were  able  to  achieve  a  status  of  “inactive  disease”  during  the  extension  study, 
particularly in patients who were ACR responders at the completion of study G2301 Part II (Group 2). 
Over all patients, 65/130 (50.0%) had inactive disease at Month 3, and 76/146 (52.1%) had inactive 
disease at the time of interim database lock (last observation).  
Details by analysis group are as follows: 
Group  1:  At Month 3, 12 of 29 patients assessed (41.4%) met the criteria for inactive disease. At the 
time of interim database lock, 14 of 33 patients assessed (42.4%) met the criteria.  
Group  2:  At  Month  3,  47  of  63  patients  assessed  (74.6%)  met  the  criteria  for  inactive  disease.  At 
interim database lock, 54 of 63 patients assessed (85.7%) met the criteria. 
Group  3:  At  Month  3,  4  of  30  patients  assessed  (13.3%)  met  the  criteria  for  inactive  disease.  At 
interim database lock, 5 of 40 patients assessed (12.5%) met the criteria. 
Group 4: At Month 3, 2 of 8 patients assessed (25.0%) met the criteria for inactive disease. At interim 
database lock, 3 of 10 patients assessed (30.0%) met the criteria. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  dose  finding  study  provided  useful  information  regarding  the  appropriate  dose  for  the  pivotal 
studies. The chosen dose of 4 mg/kg every 4 weeks is supported by the results of study A2203. 
Study G2305 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, single-dose study to assess the initial 
efficacy  of  canakinumab  (ACZ885)  with  respect  to  the  adapted  ACR  Pediatric  30  criteria  in  patients 
with Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (sJIA) and active systemic manifestations.

Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/427081/2013  
Page 110/165 
 
 
 
The study plan and design of the pivotal study G2305 is appropriate to assess the efficacy and safety 
of canakinumab in the described target population. The numbers of protocol deviations are rather high. 
34 of 43 (79%) canakinumab treated patients had a protocol deviation and 22 of 41 (53.7%) placebo 
treated patients.  
The objectives and endpoints of study G2305 are sufficient to assess efficacy of a short term treatment 
to observe effect on signs and symptoms of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. 
Study G2301 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled withdrawal study of flare prevention of 
canakinumab  (ACZ885)  in  patients  with  Systemic  Juvenile  Idiopathic  Arthritis  (sJIA)  and  active 
systemic manifestations. 
The  study  design  of  the  second  pivotal  trial  G2301  was  discussed  with  the  CHMP  during  a  scientific 
advice  procedure  in  2008.  This  design  was  modified  to  include  steroid  tapering  in  part  I,  and  part  II 
was adapted to be event driven. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are adequate to include the target 
population with active sJIA. 
The  objectives  and  endpoints  of  this  multicenter  two  part  study  G2301  are  appropriate  to  allow  the 
assessment of clinically meaningful efficacy and safety in the target population. The major aim of the 
study was to evaluate whether monthly canakinumab 4 mg/kg allowed for steroid tapering in at least 
25% of patients (Part I) and to demonstrate that time to flare was longer with canakinumab than with 
placebo (Part II). 
The rate of protocol deviations in both parts of the study is high with 72.3% in Part I and 64% in Part 
II.  The  relevant  protocol  deviations  include  missing  body  temperatures,  missing  hematology  values, 
missing  biochemistry  values,  missing  ECGs  etc.  The  deviations  are  not  considered  major  and  are 
therefore not expected to bias results.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
G2305 
The baseline patient- and disease characteristics show a balanced treatment population. However, all 
children  of  the  very  low  age  group  are  in  the  canakinumab  group.  Disease  characteristics  are  typical 
for patients with moderate active SJIA. Regarding the prior use of anakinra and other DMARDs there 
were no major differences between the two treatment groups. 
The primary endpoint of the study was met as the proportion of patients who had an ACR30 at Day 15 
was  higher  in  the  canakinumab  group  (83.7%)  compared  with  the  placebo  group  (9.8%).  Patients  in 
the  canakinumab  group  were  more  likely  to  respond  to  treatment  compared  with  patients  in  the 
placebo group (odds ratio of 62.29; p<0.0001). 
The use of corticosteroids at baseline had no influence on the efficacy of canakinumab. 
The results of the response to treatment according to the adapted ACR pediatric criteria are showing a 
statistically  significant  difference  in  the  treatment  effect  of  canakinumab  compared  to  placebo  at  all 
time points. The numbers of ACR responders are increasing between day 15 and day 29 and even do 
not  decline  for  ACR100  responders.  All  individual  ACR  components,  reflecting  systemic  and  joint 
symptoms,  showed  improvements  towards  normal  levels.  30%  of  canakinumab  patients  had  inactive 
disease after 4 weeks treatment. 
These  data  demonstrate  a  clinically  relevant  statistically  significant  superiority  of  canakinumab 
compared to placebo. 
Secondary endpoints and exploratory analyses give consistent results.

G2301 
Baseline  characteristics,  disease  characteristics  and  data  on  prior  use  of  biologic  DMARS  represent  a 
typical  patient  population  of  children  with  active  systemic  juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis.  The  profile  of 
medical  history  and  prior medication  is  as  expected.  Patients  baseline  and  disease  characteristics  are 
well balanced in the canakinumab and placebo treatment group. There were slightly more patients 6-
11 years old in the canakinumab group. 
Part I of the study met its primary endpoint as 44.5% of the patients were able to taper their steroid 
dose. This result is clinically important as frequent long term use of corticosteroids is accompanied by 
severe and major side effects especially in children (p<0.0001; 90% CI: 37.1, 52.2). 
128  patients  entered  Part  I  of  the  study  taking  oral  steroids.  At  the  end  of  part  Ic  42  patients  were 
steroid free (32.8%). 66/128 patients (51.6%) had an oral steroid dose of ≤0.2 mg/kg at the end of 
Part  Ic.  Therefore  treatment  with  canakinumab  showed  the  ability  to  taper  the  oral  use  of 
corticosteroids. 
The  ACR  pediatric  response  levels  gained  during  the  treatment  time  show  a  robust  and  prolonged 
treatment effect with even improved efficacy after longer treatment. 
The results of the CHAQ disability score indicate a clinically meaningful improvement over the period of 
Part  I  of  the  study.  The  fact  that  a  MCID  of  improvement  was  even  seen  during  the  time  of  steroid 
tapering is reassuring and supports the overall efficacy of canakinumab treatment. 
Nearly the same results as for the CHAQ score can be seen for the quality of live assessment using the 
CHQ-PF50 tool. Improvement in quality of live was maintained despite steroid tapering supporting the 
efficacy of canakinumab. 
Results  of  the  assessment  of  adapted  ACR  pediatric  criteria  response  variables  are  equally  showing 
improvement with canakinumab treatment in all variables. 
The  results  of  the  exploratory  endpoints  in  Part  I  support  the  efficacy  of  canakinumab  in  the  target 
population. 
The  primary  endpoint  of  Part  II,  time  to  flare,  was  met  for  canakinumab  treatment.  The  risk  to 
experience a disease flare was 64% reduced with canakinumab compared to placebo (p=0.0032). It is 
further shown that the probability to experience a disease flare is similar for placebo and canakinumab 
in  the  first  four  month  of  treatment.  After  this  time  point  the  rate  of  flares  was  much  lower  in  the 
canakinumab group than in the placebo group. 
The results of the secondary endpoint assessing maintenance of efficacy based on a survival analysis of 
the  time  to  worsening  in  ACR  level  in  Part  II  are  showing  a  reduced  probability  of  worsening  in  ACR 
level  for  the  canakinumab  group.  This  result  is  statistically  significant  with  a  one-sided  p-value  of 
0.0131.The  probability  not  to  worsen  in  the  ACR  levels  is  in  the  first  two  month  identical  for  placebo 
and canakinumab treatment and diverges from this time point on in favor of canakinumab treatment. 
The  results  of  the  CHAQ  disability  score  in  Part  II  of  the  study  do  not  show  in  this  randomized 
withdrawal  setting  a  statistically  significant  difference  in  the  treatment  groups.  At  the  end  of  the 
treatment period a slight superiority of prolonged canakinumab treatment could be assumed. Keeping 
in  mind  that  all  of  the  100  patients  starting  Part  II  are  ACR30  responders  and  were  treated  with 
canakinumab already for a longer time these results are comprehensible. 
The results of the change in CHQ-PF50 scores in Part II are not showing any difference in treatment of 
placebo  or  canakinumab  during  the  withdrawal  period.  As  explained  above  this  might  be  due  to  the 
fact  that  all  patients  were  already  treated  with  canakinumab  in  Part  I  and  a  possibly  prolonged

treatment  effect  and  therefore  the  treatment/withdrawal  time  in  Part  II  was  too  short  to  produce  a 
meaningful difference. 
The  results  of  the  adapted  ACR  pediatric  response  criteria  variables  are  of  descriptive  character.  A 
trend  for  sustained  efficacy  in  the  canakinumab  group  compared  to  reduced  effect  of  placebo 
treatment (tendency for resuming disease activity) can be seen. However, the differences are too small 
to be of any statistical significance. 
The  results  of  the  exploratory  endpoints  of  Part  II  of  the  study  are  supportive  to  demonstrate 
prolonged efficacy of canakinumab treatment in this sensitive patient population. 
Importantly,  at  the  end  of  Part  II,  the  proportion  of  patients  who  had  inactive  disease  was  higher  in 
the canakinumab group (31/50, 62.0%) compared to the placebo group (17/50, 34.0%). A statistically 
significantly higher likelihood of inactive disease was seen with canakinumab treatment compared with 
placebo  (CMH  test:  odds  ratio  of  3.4  (95%  CI:  1.5,  8.0);  p=0.0020).  Furthermore,  canakinumab 
treatment seems to have a small positive effect on the growth velocity as demonstrated by increase in 
the median change from baseline in height percentile at the end of the study (+2.09). For patients in 
the placebo group, no change between baseline and the end of study height percentile categories could 
be demonstrated. The changes seen in weight and BMI percentiles were similar to those for height. 
The  12  week  pooled  efficacy  data  show  a  sustained  treatment  effect  over  time.  A  proportion  of 
58%  of  patients  achieve  an  ACR70  by  Day  16  of  treatment.  The  proportion  of  patients  in  the  pooled 
group who achieved a status of inactive disease at day 85 was 28% (50/178).  
In  the  secondary  endpoint  analysis  of  the  pooled  data  it  is  shown  that  treatment  with  canakinumab 
over  the  time  of  12  weeks  leads  to  a  slight  increase  of  response  in  the  different  criteria  apart  from 
CHAQ. The improvement of CHAQ disability score decreases over time. 
The MAH performed a number of different subgroup  analysis with data from 178 patients in the 12 
week  pooled  group  of  studies  G2305,  G2301,  and  G2301E1.  The  chosen  efficacy  endpoint  for  this 
subgroup analysis is appropriate. 
Response to canakinumab treatment as demonstrated by the adapted ACR pediatric criteria was seen 
across subgroups of age (including the youngest of patients, 2-<4 years of age, as well as patients 2, 
3, and 4 years of age) gender, race, and body weight consistent with the overall efficacy seen in the 
12-week efficacy pooled group. A response to canakinumab treatment was also seen in subgroups of 
disease duration, active joint count, and baseline oral steroid level and in all other assessed subgroups. 
The response rates for patients with a lower joint count were generally higher compared to those with 
a higher joint count. 
ACR  response  rates  were  higher  for  steroid-free  patients  compared  with  those  using  oral  steroids  at 
baseline,  and  those  in  the  higher  oral  steroid  dose  level  category  (>0.4  mg/kg/day)  had  lower 
response  rates  compared  to  those  on  lower  steroid  doses  (≤0.4  mg/kg/day),  a  trend  that  was  more 
apparent the higher the ACR response level achieved. 
ACR response rates were generally lower in patients who discontinued anakinra due to lack of efficacy 
compared  with  patients  who  discontinued  anakinra  for  other  reasons  or  patients  who  were  never 
exposed  to  anakinra.  Response  rates  were  generally  comparable  for  patients  with  or  without  prior 
steroid use, although there is some variability between the two groups at higher ACR response levels 
(ACR70, ACR90, ACR100) suggesting that those without prior steroid use have higher response rates 
compared to  those  with  prior  use.  The  same  effect  can  be  seen  for  prior  MTX  use  and  prior  DMARDs 
use.  Patients  requiring  these  medications,  however,  tend  to  have  a  more  severe  disease  state  than 
those not requiring MTX, steroids and DMARDs.

Study  G2301E1,  an  extension  study  to  the  2  pivotal  studies  G2305  and  G2301,  provided  further 
data to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of canakinumab 4 mg/kg every 4 weeks. 
The  presented  data  is  complex  due  to  the  different  treatment  regimens  and  treatment  durations.  Of 
the 147 patients assessed at time of the interim analysis 76 (52.1%) had inactive disease. 
In general the efficacy data of the long term extension study support the results gained from the two 
pivotal trials. 
69  patients  entered  the  extension  study  on  oral  steroids.  Twenty  of  these  (29.0%)  were  steroid-free 
and  13  (18.8%)  were  able  to  successfully  reduce  their  steroid  dose  at  the  time  of  interim  database 
lock.  Twenty-seven  (39.1%)  did  not  attempt  tapering  and  9  (13.0%)  failed  an  attempt  at  steroid 
tapering. These results are seen as very important in light of the paediatric population and the possible 
side  effects  of  long  term  steroid  therapy.  The  study  showed  that  even  patients  with  no  initial  ACR30 
response were able to gain this response and  were  further able to reduce their steroid dose. Overall, 
data  from  the  extension  study  G2301E1  show  that  canakinumab  treatment  is  effective  in  the  target 
population with sJIA over longer time periods. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The  efficacy  of  canakinumab  in  treating  SJIA  was  demonstrated  in  2  pivotal  phase  III  studies.  The 
efficacy criteria, sample size and duration of exposure are appropriate. 
Overall, data from the two pivotal studies and the extension study show that canakinumab treatment 
is  effective  in  the  target  population  with  sJIA,  allows  steroid  dose  reduction  and  tapering  in  an 
important  proportion  of  paediatric  patients,  can  induce  inactive  disease,  and  efficacy  is  maintained 
over longer time period (so far median treatment duration 49 weeks). 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Approximately  2,500  subjects  have  been  treated  with  Ilaris  in  blinded  and  open-label  clinical  trials  in 
patients with CAPS, gouty arthritis or other IL-1 beta mediated diseases, and healthy volunteers. The 
cumulative  patient  exposure  since  the  first  launch  of  the  product  is  estimated  to  be  approximately 
1284 patient-treatment-years (PTY). 
As part of a specific obligation (SO) at the initial MA a CAPS registry was initiated and data collection is 
ongoing  with  232  CAPS  patients  enrolled  (cut-off  30  June  2012).  According  to  the  assessment  the 
safety  profile  was  comparable  to  the  known  profile  and  no  new  potential  safety  concerns  were 
identified. 
From  the  third  annual  re-assessment  (16  October  2012)  safety  data  from  175  CAPS  patients  in 
completed  clinical  trials  is  available.  The  most  frequently  reported  adverse  events  included  upper 
respiratory  tract  infections  and  nasopharyngitis  across  all  CAPS  studies.  Dose  and  duration  of 
treatment apparently had no impact on the type or frequency of adverse events.

The  RMP  version  5.0  includes  Macrophage  Activation  Syndrome  (MAS)  as  a  risk  under  potential  off-
label  pediatric  use  in  patients  with  SJIA  since  MAS  is  specific  to  SJIA.  The  Investigator  Brochure  and 
the patient informed consent include detailed information on MAS events. For the approved indication 
(CAPS), the risk of MAS has adequately been addressed in the RMP. 
The safety database for the new indication claimed encompasses: 
•  3 completed SJIA studies A2203, G2305 and G2301,  
• 
interim  report  from  the  ongoing  extension  Study  G2301E1.  Patients  from  both  G2305  and 
G2301 could be eligible to enter into this open-label extension trial 
Patient exposure 
For the current submission 201 SJIA patients, with 301 patient-years of exposure were treated in the 1 
Phase II and 3 Phase III clinical trials. Of these, 130 patients received treatment of at least 48 weeks 
duration,  with  78  being  treated  for  at  least  96  weeks.  Median  duration  of  exposure  was  617  days 
(minimum 4, maximum 1829 days). The median number of doses given was 22 with a minimum of 1 
and maximum of 49.  
Study A2203 
Detailed description of the study and the assessment of data can be found in in the pharmacokinetic 
chapter (2.3.2) of this report and in the chapter on PK/PD modelling (2.3.4).  
Table 48.  Overall exposure by treatment duration [n(%)] 
All  patients  who  entered  Stage  II  of  the  study  received  a  dose  of  4  mg/kg.  Single  doses  were  given 
when a patient relapsed; 10 patients received treatment in Stage II (1 in Cohort I, 5 in Cohort II and 4 
in  Cohort  III).  The  number  of  doses  received  in  Stage  I  ranged  from  1  to  11  and  in  Stage  II  ranged 
from 1 to 8.  
Study G2305 
This  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  multi-centre  (40  centres  in  18  countries)  single  dose,  29-day 
Phase  III  trial  enrolled  84  SJIA  patients  (43  canakinumab  and  41  placebo)  aged  2-20  years.  Total 
patient-years exposure in 43 canakinumab patients was 3.25 and in 41 placebo patients it was 1.20. 
Study G2301 
This was a two-part Phase III study with an open-label, single-arm active treatment (Part Ia, b, c, d) 
followed by a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven withdrawal design (Part II).

•  Part  I  encompassed  177  patients;  all  of  which  received  a  single  dose  of  canakinumab  (4 
mg/kg) subcutaneously (s.c), with a maximum total single dose of 300 mg every 4 weeks. The 
median  duration  of  exposure  in  Part  I  was  113  days.  Most  patients  (80.2%)  received 
between 2 and 8 doses of canakinumab. Overall, the mean / median number of doses in Part I 
was 4.25 / 4.0 
•  Part  II  enrolled  100  patients  (50  verum  and  50  placebo)  who  received  a  single  dose  of 
canakinumab  (4  mg/kg)  or  placebo  s.c.  every  4  weeks.  The  median  duration  of  exposure  in 
Part II was higher in the canakinumab group than in the placebo group (221.5 vs. 163.5 days), 
as  more  patients  in  the  placebo  group  discontinued  early  from  Part  II  due  to  unsatisfactory 
therapeutic effect. The total patient-years exposure in Part II was  31.84 years for the 
canakinumab  group  and  24.78  years  for  the  placebo  group.  A  higher  percentage  of 
patients  in  the  canakinumab  group  received  more  than  8  doses  of  study  drug  compared  with 
those  in  the  placebo  group  (46.0%  vs.  28.0%),  also  related  to  the  higher  rate  of 
discontinuation in placebo patients. 
Study G2301E1 
Study G2301E1 is an ongoing open label extension study to characterize the long-term safety and 
efficacy in patients from previous studies G2305 and G2301. All patients who demonstrated at 
minimum adapted ACR pediatric 30 response at Day 15 from their originating study were eligible to 
participate. An interim analysis performed with a cut-off date of Aug 10, 2012 included 147 patients 
who had a median 343 days (range: 3 to 144 weeks) of exposure. Total exposure was 156 patient 
years. 
Concomitant medication  
In  general  166/201  patients  (82.6%)  had  had  previous  steroid  treatment.  At  baseline  169  (84.1%) 
were using MTX or oral steroids.  
Study A2203 
All 23 patients received concomitant treatment (mainly NSAIDs, prednisone, antibiotics, Vitamin D). No 
prohibited  medications  were  administered.  The  majority  of  the  patients  (19  out  of  23)  were  under 
concomitant steroid treatment at baseline and 16 patients had used anakinra.

Study G2305 
Patients had to be off any previous biologic agent for an appropriate washout period, but could be on a 
stable dose of methotrexate and/or corticosteroid at a prednisone equivalent dose of ≤1.0mg/kg/day. 
The  majority  of  patients  had  taken  (and  discontinued)  medications  prior  to  the  start  of  study  drug 
(79.1%  canakinumab  vs.  75.6%  placebo).  The  most  common  of  these  medications  (i.e.,  ≥10.0%  of 
patients  in  either  group)  were  anakinra  (32.6%  vs.  31.7%),  etanercept  (23.3%  vs.  17.1%), 
prednisone  (23.3%  vs.  7.3%),  prednisolone  (16.3%  vs.  22.0%),  methylprednisolone  (14.0%  vs. 
12.2%), methotrexate (16.3% vs. 12.2%), and ibuprofen (4.7% vs. 17.1%). 
Study G2301 
•  Part I 
177 patients (128 on corticosteroids; 49 steroid-free) entered Part 1. The most frequently used other 
prior  medications  (≥15%)  were  anakinra  (35.6%),  prednisone  (20.3%),  etanercept  (17.5%), 
prednisolone (16.9%) and methotrexate (16.9%). 
Nearly all patients (175/177; 98.9%) took a concomitant medication on or after the start of study drug 
in  Part  I.  Concomitant  steroids  were  used  by  74.0%  of  patients  in  Part  I  and  consisted  primarily  of 
prednisone  (36.2%)  and  prednisolone  (28.8%).  Over  half  of  patients  (54.2%)  used  concomitant 
methotrexate  or  methotrexate  sodium.  Concomitant  NSAIDs  were  used  by  72.9%  of  patients  and 
consisted mainly of ibuprofen, indomethacin and naproxen. 
•  Part II 
Most of the 100 patients took a concomitant medication on or after the start of study drug in Part II, 
with  no  meaningful  difference  between  the  treatment  groups  (94.0%  canakinumab  vs.  92.0% 
placebo).  Concomitant  use  of  steroids  was  reported  more  frequently  for  the  placebo  group  (30.0%) 
than the canakinumab group (16.0%), with prednisolone (10.0% canakinumab and 12.0% placebo) as 
the  most  common  steroid.  Over  half  of  patients  in  both  treatment  groups  used  concomitant 
methotrexate  or  methotrexate  sodium  (58.0%  canakinumab  and  52.0%  placebo).  Concomitant 
NSAIDs, mainly ibuprofen, indomethacin and naproxen, were used by a greater proportion of placebo 
patients (70.0%) than canakinumab patients (58.0%). 
Study G2301E1  
Most patients (97.3%) were taking at least one concomitant medication on or after the start of study 
drug.  Concomitant  steroid  medications  were  taken  by  57.1%  of  patients;  concomitant  methotrexate 
medications  were  taken  by  56.5%  of  patients  and  concomitant  NSAIDs  were  taken  by  66.7%  of 
patients.  Concomitant  medications  used  by  ≥10%  of  patients  were  indomethacin  (16.3%), 
paracetamol  (40.1%),  ibuprofen  (31.3%),  naproxen  (17.7%),  prednisone  (23.1%),  prednisolone 
(22.4%),  methylprednisolone  (19.7%),  folic  acid  (40.8%),  methotrexate  (45.6%),  methotrexate 
sodium (11.6) amoxicillin (12.9%), omeprazole (30.6%), and ergocalciferol (10.9%). 
Adverse events  
General 
A total of 171/200 (85.1%) experienced adverse events. The most often affected system organ classes 
(SOCs)  were  infections  and  infestations  (71.1%),  followed  by  gastrointestinal  disorders,  (52.7%), 
musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders  (41.8%),  and  respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal 
disorders (38.3%). This sequence was the same when adjusted by exposure (see below).

The  most  frequently  reported  AEs  by  preferred  term  were  nasopharyngitis  (29.4%),  cough  (25.9%), 
pyrexia  (25.9%),  vomiting  (22.9%),  diarrhea  (22.4%),  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (22.4%)  and 
headache (20.9%).  
Severity 
Most  AEs  were  of  mild  or  moderate  intensity;  with  16.9%  of  SJIA  patients  having  severe  AEs  (this 
compares to the data on severe AEs in CAPS children at 15.6%). AEs of gastrointestinal disorders were 
mainly  mild;  3.0%  of  SJIA  children  had  severe  events.  AEs  of  infections  and  infestations  were  also 
mainly mild or moderate, with 6.0% of SJIA children having severe events. Among the most frequent 
AEs, there were no cases of severe nasopharyngitis, cough or upper respiratory tract infection. 
Exposure-adjusted incidence rates 
Exposure-adjusted incidence rates of AEs in total did not increase over time on treatment (1684.1 vs. 
802.2  AEs  per  100  patient  years  for  first  4  weeks  vs.  after  48  weeks),  suggesting  that  undesirable 
effects do not increase with continued canakinumab therapy. 
Most specific AEs showed either decreasing rates or no clear pattern of change over time. The only AEs 
showing  slight  increases  in  rate  over  time  were  musculoskeletal  events  (preferred  terms  juvenile 
arthritis, pain in extremity, and arthralgia). 
The incidence rate of SAEs did not increase with time (199.0 vs. 39.9 per 100 patient years in first 4 
weeks  vs.  after  48  weeks),  suggesting  there  is  no  progression  of  undesirable  effects  or  immune 
suppression  with  continued  use  of  canakinumab.  There  was  no  indication  that  a  severe  AE  outcome 
(deaths) increased over time.

Plasma canakinumab levels and AEs 
Plasma  canakinumab  levels  were  not  higher  in  patients  with  selected  AEs  (e.g.,  infection,  MAS, 
pyrexia,  SAE  of  infection  and  abdominal  pain)  compared  to  those  without  these  AEs.  There  was  no 
clear relation of time of AEs to peak plasma levels.  
Study A2203 
All patients experienced at least one AE, (22/23 in Stage I and 11/11 in Stage II). In general the most 
common  AEs  were  upper  respiratory  tract  infections,  rhinitis,  nasopharyngitis,  pharyngitis,  tonsillitis 
and gastroenteritis.  
Stage I (n= 23) 
A total of 19 patients (83%) had gastrointestinal disorders, whereby abdominal pain/ upper abdominal 
pain (47.8%) and vomiting (35%) were the most common AEs, mainly experienced by patients in the 
1.5  and  4.5  mg/kg  groups,  followed  by  nausea  and  diarrhoea  in  4  patients  each  (17%).  Sixteen 
patients  (69%)  were  classified  as  having  an  infection,  these  were  mainly  rhinotracheitis, 
gastroenteritis, nasopharyngitis, and URTI.

General  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  were  experienced  by  13  patients  (57%).  Pyrexia 
(30%)  was  a  common  AE  with  the  rate  increasing  with  increasing  dose;  this  was  followed  by  cough, 
headache and rhinitis (26% each) which were mainly experienced by patients in the 1.5 mg/kg group. 
Cardiac arrhythmia and pericarditis was experienced by 1 patient, both were SAEs  
Stage II (n=11)  
The  majority  of  the  patients  73%  (8/11)  were  listed  in  the  SOC  “infections  and  infestations”,  these 
were mainly gastroenteritis (27%) and influenza (18%). 
Gastrointestinal disorders were also high and observed in 7/11 (64%), mainly diarrhoea (3/11; 27 %) 
There are 2 cases of rectal hemorrhage and one of anal erosion and one of haematochezia.  (see SAEs) 
Respiratory  disorders  were  common  (54%;  mainly  cough).  One  case  of  MAS  and  1  syncope  occurred 
(see MAS and SAE below)  
Severity of AEs  
Most  of  AEs  were  of  mild  to  moderate  severity,  unrelated  to  study  drug  and  did  not  lead  to 
discontinuation.  
Study G2305  
A total of 24/43 patients (55.8%) had AEs in the canakinumab group vs. 16/41 (39%) in the placebo 
group. 
The most commonly affected primary system organ classes were infections and infestations (30.2% vs. 
12.2%  in  placebo  group;  primarily  nasopharyngitis,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  and  bronchitis), 
gastrointestinal  disorders  at  (16.3%  vs  4.9%;  primarily  diarrhea,  abdominal  pain),  skin  and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders (14.0% vs. 2.4%; primarily maculo-papular rash), and nervous system 
disorders  (primarily  headache).  Other  AEs  occurred  in  individual  patients  in  both  groups,  without  a 
distinct  pattern  or  signal  emerging.  MAS  occurred  in  one  patient  each  of  both  verum  and  placebo 
groups. 
Severity of AEs  
All AEs were either mild (canakinumab 44.2% and placebo 36.6%) or moderate (canakinumab 11.6% 
and placebo 2.4%) in severity; no severe AEs were reported.  
AEs requiring significant additional therapy were found more often in the canakinumab group (39.5% 
vs. 19.5%); additional therapy was primarily required for infections, gastrointestinal disorders and skin 
disorders  
AEs by age group  
In general, there were no significant differences amongst the age categories in the canakinumab group 
with  respect  to  frequency  or  nature  of  AEs,  however,  the  youngest  age  category  (i.e.,  2-<4  years  of 
age) had a relatively lower proportion of patients reporting AEs compared with other age categories, as 
well as compared with the overall population.  
In the canakinumab group, AEs were reported for: 
4/9 (44.4%) patients in the 2-<4 age group, (vs. 0 in the placebo group) 
5/8 (62.5%) patients in the 4-<6 age group, (vs. 3/7 (42.9%)) 
8/14 (57.1%) patients in the 6-<12 group, (vs. 11/22 (50.0%)) 
7/12 (58.3%) patients in the >12 age group. (vs. 2/12 (16.7%)).

AEs by gender  
The  reporting  frequency  of  AEs  was  generally  comparable  for  the  two  genders.  In  the  canakinumab 
group, AEs were reported for 9/16 (56.3%) male patients and 15/27 (55.6%) female patients. In the 
placebo group, AEs were reported for 6/18 (33.3%) male patients and 10/23 (43.5%) female patients. 
Of  the  common  reported  AEs,  infections  and  infestations  AEs  were  seen  at  a  comparable  rate  in  the 
two genders, while gastrointestinal disorders (f=22.2% vs. m= 6.3%) and skin (f= 18.5 vs. m= 6.3%) 
AEs  were  seen  more  often  in  females,  and  neurological  disorder  AEs  were  seen  more  often  in  males 
(f=3.7% vs. m=18.8%) 
Study G2301 
•  Part I 
A total of 78.0% (138/177) of patients experienced an AE during Part I. The most commonly affected 
primary  SOCs  were  infections  and  infestations  (54.8%;  primarily  nasopharyngitis,  upper  respiratory 
tract infection and rhinitis), gastrointestinal disorders (29.4%; primarily vomiting, abdominal pain and 
diarrhea),  and  respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders  (20.9%;  primarily  cough),  skin  and 
subcutaneous disorders (18.6%; primarily eczema), followed by musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders (16.4%, primarily arthralgia) general and administration disorders (15.8%, primarily pain in 
extremity)  and  nervous  system  disorders  (15.8%;  primarily  headache).  The  most  frequent  AEs  by 
preferred  term  were  nasopharyngitis  (15.3%),  headache  (13.0%)  and  cough  (11.3%).  MAS  was 
reported in 4 (2.3%) patients (see below). 
Severity of AEs Part I 
The majority of AEs were either mild (51.4%) or moderate (21.5%) in severity. Nine (5.1%) patients 
had  a  severe  AE.  Of  these  patients,  5  had  multiple  severe  events.  Four  (2.3%)  patients  had 
hematophagic  histiocytosis  (MAS);  all  4  cases  were  reported  as  severe  AEs  and  as  SAEs  and  were 
adjudicated  by  the  independent  MAS  Adjudication  Committee  (MASAC).  Most  severe  AEs  were  also 
reported as SAEs, except for the following 3 events: 
o 
increased  serum  ferritin  (patient  0057/00101);  this  patient  had  an  SAE  of  traumatic 
fracture; 
o  anxiety  (patient  0115/00109);  this  patient  had  multiple  severe  AEs  /  SAEs  including 
MAS;  
o  pyrexia (patient 0510/00101); this patient had 2 other severe AEs / SAEs. 
•  Part II 
A  total  of  50  patients  participated  in  Part  II  (50  in  the  verum  and  50  in  the  placebo  group).  AEs 
occurring  in  Part  II  of  the  study  were  reported  for  80.0%  of  patients  in  the  canakinumab  group  and 
70.0%  in  the  placebo  group.  For  both  treatment  groups,  infections  and  infestations  were  the  most 
commonly  affected  primary  SOC  in  Part  II  (54.0%  canakinumab  and  38.0%  placebo)  and  consisted 
predominantly of nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection and rhinitis. 
In the canakinumab group, arthralgia (24.0%) was the most frequently reported AE by preferred term 
followed by cough (16.0%), and nasopharyngitis and pyrexia (both 14.0%). In the placebo group, the 
most  frequently  reported  AEs  were  nasopharyngitis  and  rhinitis  (both  14.0%),  followed  by  cough 
(12.0%), and arthralgia, pyrexia and upper respiratory tract infection (each 10.0%). MAS was reported 
in 1 (2.0%) patient in the placebo group.

In  both  verum  and  placebo  treatment  groups,  the  majority  of  AEs  occurring  were  mild  (36.0% 
canakinumab  vs.  34.0%  placebo)  or  moderate  (34.0%  vs.  28.0%)  in  severity.  Severe  AEs  were 
reported  in  5  (10.0%)  patients  on  canakinumab  and  3  (6.0%)  patients  on  placebo,  and  3  of  these 
patients (1 canakinumab and 2 placebo) had multiple severe AEs. 
One  patient  (0011/00101)  who  was  randomized  to  placebo  after  previously  receiving  canakinumab 
experienced  9  severe  AEs  in  Part  II,  all  associated  with  hematophagic  histiocytosis  (MAS)  which  was 
reported 5 months after entering Part II and 192 days since the last canakinumab dose in Part I. Most 
severe AEs were also reported as SAEs, except for the following 4 events: 
o 
rash papular (patient 0094/00102 randomized to canakinumab),  
o  arthralgia (patient 0135/00101 randomized to canakinumab),  
o 
coagulopathy  (patient  0011/00101  randomized  to  placebo);  this  patient  had  multiple  severe 
AEs / SAEs,  
o  pruritus  (patient  0042/00101  randomized  to  placebo);  this  patient  had  multiple  severe  AEs  / 
SAEs 
Exposure- adjusted AEs Part II  
The incidence of adverse events was adjusted to the exposure (rate per 100 patient days) to account 
for the unequal exposure in the verum and placebo arms and the overall rate was found to be similar 
in  both  groups;  in  the  canakinumab  group  (n=  50)  there  were  272  adverse  events  (=  2.34  /  100 
patient  days)  and  229  in  the  placebo  group  (=  2.53  /  100  patient  days).  However,  some  differences 
were noticeable: 
The  canakinumab  group  had  a  higher  exposure-adjusted  incidence  of  musculoskeletal  and  connective 
tissue disorders (0.42 canakinumab vs. 0.19 placebo), particularly arthralgia (0.15 vs. 0.06) and back 
pain (0.09 vs. 0.00); and  gastrointestinal disorders (0.36 vs. 0.25) such as abdominal pain (0.12 vs. 
0.06) compared with the placebo group. 
AEs  that  were  more  frequent  in  the  placebo  group  compared  with  the  canakinumab  group  included 
infections  and  infestations  (0.63  placebo  vs.  0.59  canakinumab),  such  as  nasopharyngitis  (0.15  vs. 
0.09) and rhinitis (0.17 vs. 0.05); nervous system disorders (0.27 vs. 0.08), primarily headache (0.24 
vs.  0.04);  investigations  (0.14  vs.  0.09);  respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders  (0.25  vs. 
0.18); and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (0.27 vs. 0.19). 
Study G2301E1 
Most patients (128/147; 87.1%) experienced at least one AE.  
Exposure  adjusted  (per  100  patient  days)  incidence  rates  for  adverse  events  were  calculated.  The 
system  organ  class  (SOC)  with  the  highest  100-day  exposure  adjusted  incidence  rate  was  infections 
and  infestations  (0.632;  mainly  nasopharyngitis  (0.105),  rhinitis  (0.075),  upper  respiratory  tract 
infection  (0.083),  and  gastroenteritis  (0.047)).  The  SOCs  with  the  next  highest  incidence  rates  were 
gastrointestinal  disorders  (0.342;  mainly  vomiting,  diarrhoea,  abdominal  pain),  followed  by 
musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissues  disorders  (0.253;  mainly  arthralgia,  juvenile  arthritis)  and 
respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (0.239; mainly cough).

Severity of AEs  
Most  patients  experienced  AEs  that  were  considered  mild  (40.8%)  or  moderate  (32.0%)  in  severity. 
Twenty-one patients (14.3%) experienced AE(s) that were considered severe. The only severe events 
that  were  experienced  by  more  than  1  patient  were  pyrexia,  gastroenteritis,  varicella,  hematophagic 
histiocytosis (2 patients in each, 1.4%); and juvenile arthritis (7 patients, 4.8%). 
Adverse events that required significant additional therapy  
A  total  of  112  patients  (76.2%)  experienced  AE(s)  that  required  significant  additional  therapy.  The 
most  commonly  affected  SOCs  (≥10%)  in  this  category  were  infections  and  infestations  (55.1%), 
musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders  (29.3%),  gastrointestinal  disorders  (23.8%), 
respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders  (19.0%),  general  disorders  and  administration  site 
conditions  (17.0%),  skin  and  subcutaneous  disorders  (17.0%),  injury,  poisoning  and  procedural 
complications (13.6%), nervous system disorders (12.9%). 
Adverse drug reaction (ADRs)  
General 
Potential ADRs were identified by the applicant as AE terms that were either listed ADRs in the CDS, or 
showed higher rates than placebo. 
The  main  ADRs  of  the  2  pivotal  studies  identified  from  AE  reports,  their  rates  of  occurrence  and 
frequency category are shown in the table below (see table below).

Study G2305 
AEs suspected to be related to study medication (by the investigator) were reported in 5/43 /patients 
(11.6%) in the canakinumab group and 1/41 patient (2.4%) in the placebo group. In the canakinumab 
group, the suspected AEs were  
•  1  patient  with  bronchopneumonia,  rash  maculo-papular,  MAS,  hepatitis,  neutropenia,  and 
leukopenia,  
•  1 patient with allergic edema,  
•  1 patient with headache and varicella, 
•  1 patient with dizziness,  
•  1 patient with pruritus 
In the placebo group, the suspected related AEs were fatigue and thirst in 1 patient.  
Study G2301 
•  Part I (only canakinumab)  
Adverse  drug  reactions  were  reported  in  30/177  (16.9%)  patients.  Infections  and  infestations  (8 
patients,  4.5%)  and  gastrointestinal  disorders  (6  patients,  3.4%)  were  the  most  commonly  affected 
SOCs of drug-related AEs. Most drug-related AEs by preferred term occurred in 1 or 2 patients, except 
for  hematophagic  histiocytosis  (4  patients)  and  headache  (3).  Gastrointestinal  non-specific 
inflammation  and  dysfunctional  conditions  were  the  most  frequently  reported  Standardized  MedDRA 
Query  (SMQ)  category  (25.4%),  followed  by  oropharyngeal  disorders  (12.4%).  Drug-related  hepatic 
disorder  was  reported  in  9  (5.1%)  patients,  consisting  mainly  of  investigations  for  liver-related  signs 
and symptoms (7 patients, 4.0%). 
•  Part II (canakinumab vs placebo)  
Adverse drug reactions were reported in 13/50 (26.0%) patients in the canakinumab group and 6/50 
(12.0%) in the placebo group. The most common drug-suspected AEs in the canakinumab group were 
related  to  infections  and  infestations  (7  patients,  14.0%),  followed  by  skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue 
disorders  (3  patients,  6.0%)  and  investigations  (2  patients,  4.0%).  In  the  placebo  group,  the 
predominant  SOCs  of  drug-related  AEs  were  investigations  (3  patients,  6.0%),  followed  by 
gastrointestinal  disorders,  infections  and  infestations,  and  respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal 
disorders (each occurring in 2 patients, 4.0%). 
The  two  treatment  groups  had  similar  incidences  and  types  of  Standardized  MedDRA  Query  (SMQs) 
reported,  except  for  oropharyngeal  disorders  which  were  more  frequent  in  the  canakinumab  group 
than  in  the  placebo  group  (24.0%  vs.  12.0%),  particularly  with  respect  to  oropharyngeal  infections 
(16.0% vs. 6.0%). Hepatic disorders, consisting entirely of liver-related investigations, were reported 
with comparable frequency between the treatment groups (8.0% canakinumab vs. 10.0% placebo).

Adverse events of special interest  
•  Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) 
Background information 
In rheumatology, MAS is most strongly associated with the systemic form of juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
(SJIA). In fact, it accounts for much of the morbidity and mortality seen in this disease. About 10% of 
the  patients  with  SJIA  develop  overt  life-threatening  MAS  [S  Sawhney,  Arch  Dis  Child  2001;85:421–426; 
retrospective  study  in  (n=143)  mainly  SJIA,  nine  developed  MAS,  2  thereof  died],  and  this  may  occur  at  any 
time point during the course of SJIA. (Adapted from: Grom A. Current Opinion in Rheumatology 2010,22:561–
566 and S. Davì, A. An international consensus survey of diagnostic criteria for macrophage activation syndrome in 
systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis,”J. Rheum., vol. 38, no. 4, pp. 764–768, 2011.)  
The  diagnosis  of  MAS  is  challenging  because  it  is  a syndrome  defined  by  a  constellation  of  signs  and 
symptoms that evolve rapidly and can be similar to both active SJIA and sepsis. 
MAS  is  a  severe,  potentially  fatal  condition  associated  with  excessive  activation  and  expansion  of 
macrophages and T cells (mainly CD8+) leading to an overwhelming inflammatory reaction.  
A  fall  in  the  ESR  and  platelet  count,  particularly  in  a  combination  with  persistently  high  CRP  and 
increasing  levels  of  serum  D-dimer  and  ferritin,  should  raise  a  suspicion  of  impending  MAS.  In  MAS, 
serum  IL-18  levels  are  elevated  out  of  proportion  compared  with  other  cytokines.  This  is  in  distinct 
contrast to in other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. In healthy individuals IL-18 levels are in the 
realm  of  100  pg/mL,  in  diseases  with  systemic  inflammation  the  levels  rarely  exceed  300  pg/mL, 
whereas in MAS IL-18 can be in the nanogram per milliliter range. 
MAS can be confirmed by evidence of macrophage hemophagocytosis in the bone marrow. An infective 
trigger  may  herald  the  onset  of  MAS  in  predisposed  patients.  Multisystem  involvement  is  a  poor 
prognostic sign. 
The main clinical manifestations of MAS include fever, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, severe 
cytopenias, liver dysfunction, and coagulopathy consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation. 
The  pathognomonic  feature  of  MAS  is  the  expansion  of  well  differentiated  macrophages  exhibiting 
hemophagocytic activity. These macrophages are typically found in bone marrow or lymph nodes, but 
they may infiltrate almost any organ in the body and may account for many of the systemic features of 
this syndrome, including cytopenias and coagulopathy.  
Occult MAS  
In  a  controlled  study  by  Behrens  et  al  (Behrens  E.  J  Rheumatol  2007;34:1133–8)  they  investigated  the 
prevalence of “occult MAS” in children with SJIA by reviewing bone marrow aspirates (BMA). 
Patients  diagnosed  with  SJIA  who  underwent  bone  marrow  aspiration  were  identified  retrospectively. 
Patients  admitted  with  a  diagnosis  of  fever  of  unknown  origin  and  discharged  with  a  diagnosis  other 
than SJIA or malignancy, and who had a BMA, were identified as controls. The BMA were reviewed by a

single  hematopathologist  for  evidence  of  MAS,  ranging  from  activated  macrophages  to  frank 
hemophagocytic cells. 
Eight  of  15  (53%)  patients  with  SJIA  had  BMA  suggestive  of  MAS.  Two  of  15  patients  (13%)  were 
diagnosed clinically with MAS. Three patients (20%) were noted to have frank hemophagocytosis, only 
one  of  whom  was  diagnosed  with  MAS  clinically.  There  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  in 
the  laboratory  values  for  the  patients  with  and  without  evidence  of  MAS  on  BMA.  There  was  no 
evidence of increased macrophage activity or hemophagocytosis in any of the control BMA. Occult MAS 
appears  to  be  common  in  patients  with  SJIA  who  undergo  BMA.  This  suggests  that  macrophage 
activation  may  be  integral  to  the  pathogenesis  of  SJIA,  with  implications  for  treatment.(adapted  from: 
Behrens E. J Rheumatol 2007;34:1133–8) 
Reported cases of MAS in canakinumab SJIA studies  
Reported cases of MAS were reviewed and adjudicated by an independent MAS adjudication committee 
(MASAC).  
According  to  the  study  report  MAS  was  reported  in  12  patients  (10  canakinumab  and  2  placebo), 
including two (1 canakinumab and 1 placebo patient) with a fatal outcome: 
•  1 in Study A2203 (1 canakinumab) 
•  2 in Study G2305 (1 canakinumab (prior bronchopneumonia) and 1 placebo)  
•  5 in Study G2301 (4 canakinumab and 1 placebo) 
•  4 in Study G2301E1 (4 canakinumab; possibly 8 see CHMP’s comment below) 
In  3  of  these  patients,  the  diagnosis of  MAS  was  confirmed  by  the  demonstration  of  hemophagocytic 
macrophages in the bone marrow. 
Corticosteroid (CS) dose reduction 
Corticosteroid  (CS)  dose  reduction  was  part  of  the  protocol  design  of  study  G2301  (Part  Ic)  and  was 
allowed at the discretion of the investigator in the extension study G2301E1. 
Since  in  clinical  practice  MAS  may  be  triggered  by  a  flare  of  the  disease  brought  on  by  aggressive 
steroid taper, the possibility that steroid dose reduction might have been a contributing factor in some 
patients  was  considered  in  the  analysis.  Overall,  CS  tapering  did  not  appear  to  increase  the  risk  of 
MAS.  Of  the  12  reported  AEs  of  MAS,  8  of  the  patients  had  entered  the  program  on  a  concomitant 
corticosteroid and of these, 7 reduced their corticosteroid dose or completely discontinued it during the 
trial. Only two of these patients had reduced their corticosteroid dose within short period prior to MAS. 
• 
• 
Patient  510_101  from  study  G2301  had  MAS  reported  on  the  same  day  as  her  first  CS  dose 
reduction. She also had a confirmed acute EBV infection which was the likely trigger. 
Patient  145_201  in  study  G2301E1  had  CS  dose  reduction  on  Days  59-164  and  MAS  on  Day 
198.  The  last  CS  dose  change  was  a  dose  increase  in  response  to  increased  SJIA  activity 
approximately 3 weeks after completing part IC in study G2301 when he had an ACR100. 
In  addition  to  steroid  taper  during  the  study,  in  many  patients  steroid  dose  reduction  had  been 
performed  just  prior  to  the  study  entry  to  meet  certain  eligibility  criteria  (i.e  presence  of  systemic 
features, CRP >3 mg/dL etc.). Of the six patients who developed MAS within 90 days of entering the 
study, only one (Patient G2301 82_00103) had a steroid dose reduction (from 0.83 mg/kg/day to 0.6 
mg/kg/day) within 7 days prior to the entry.

Of  the  30  patients  who  were  initially  identified  by  the  MASAC,  3  cases  were  adjudicated  as  probable 
and 2 as possible MAS (=5). Two deaths occurred:  one patient (11/101) had received 8 canakinumab 
doses,  then  6  doses  of  placebo  (15/F/Bl;  Day  390),  the  other  patient  11/109;  13/M/bl;  Day  64  had 
received 3 doses of canakinumab.  
Study G2301E1 
All  patients  were  on  canakinumab  in  the  open-label  extension  study;  of  the  11  patients  who  were 
initially identified by the MASAC, 3 cases were adjudicated as probable and 3 as possible MAS (=6).  
MAS cases identified outside the SJIA clinical program 
Search  of  the  most  currently  available  data  from  the  FDA  AERs  database  (data  cut-off  date  of  March 
31,  2012)  performed  by  Novartis  identified  13  patients  with  reported  MAS.  This  group  includes  all 
patients with MAS reported as an AE in the clinical study program (up to that date). Novartis estimated 
that as of March 31, 2012, thirty patients with SJIA had been prescribed Ilaris outside a canakinumab 
clinical  study.  It  is  not  known  how  close  this  estimation  is  to  the  true  number  since  the  diagnosis  of 
SJIA is tracked differently in various countries and in some countries, including the United States, the 
physician  diagnostic  code  for  SJIA  does  not  exist  making  it  difficult  to  determine  the  true  diagnosis. 
Nevertheless, based on the 3 MAS reports among all SJIA patients treated with canakinumab outside a 
clinical study, an estimated crude incidence in this group was determined to be 10% (3/30).  
Of the 3 cases identified outside the clinical program, one was adjudicated to be probable MAS, the two 
other cases were categorized as “unlikely”, both of these resulted in death (see table below).

Infections  
As  expected  from  the  mode  of  action  of  canakinumab  ,  the  incidence  of  infections  was  higher  in  the 
canakinumab arm compared to in the placebo arm (see Study G2305). There was 1 fatal outcome of 
sepsis from an untreated urinary tract infection more than 2 years after receiving the last canakinumab 
dose in a SJIA trial (see Deaths below).  
There were SAEs of infections in 30/201 patients (15%), 2 patients (1%) discontinued due to the SAE 
infection.  No  single  serious  infection  preferred  term  occurred  in  more  than  2  (1%)  of  SJIA  patients, 
patients, except gastroenteritis and varicella, both in 4 (2%) of patients.  
Potential  opportunistic  or  unusual  infections  were  prospectively  defined  as  systemic  herpes  or  fungal 
infections, or those caused by toxoplasma, mycobacterium, aspergillus, pneumocystis, or cryptococcus 
pathogens, polyoma or cytomegalovirus, and Kaposi sarcoma. In a prospective search for these terms, 
cases  potentially  suggestive  of  an  opportunistic  infection  were  identified  but  not  medically  confirmed. 
One  patient  was  being  treated  for  a  serious  streptococcal  infection  and  was  found  to  have 
asymptomatic toxoplasmosis. This was not considered to be an opportunistic infection.

Three of the four deaths occurred a considerable time after the last dose of canakinumab (4 months to 
2  years).  The  fourth  patient  died  after  developing  MAS  approximately  3  weeks  after  the  last  dose  of 
canakinumab, after severe gastroenteritis and subsequent pulmonary hypertension. 
Study A2203 
No deaths occurred either during the study or the follow-up period.  
However  a  death  was  reported  for  a  female  patient,  2.25  years  after  the  last  injection  of  study 
medication. The cause of death was pneumococcal sepsis (encephalitis) 
Study G2301E1 
No patients died during the study.  
However, one patient (0115/00201), a 9-year old female Caucasian, discontinued from the study due 
to unsatisfactory therapeutic effect and died due to disease progression approximately 3 months after 
discontinuing from the study. 
Study G2305 
No deaths occurred during the study. 
Study G2301 
•  Part I 
One patient died during Part I. Patient 0115/00109, a 13-year-old Black male, experienced an SAE of 
severe adenovirus gastroenteritis on Day 40 which resolved on Day 57. He then experienced SAEs of 
pulmonary hypertension, pyrexia, increased serum ferritin and interstitial lung disease on Day 62. Two 
days later, on Day 64, the patient was diagnosed with MAS. This case was adjudicated by the MASAC 
as  clinically  consistent  with  MAS  with  either  histologic  confirmation  or  meets  current  formal 
hemophagocytic  lymphohistiocytosis  (HLH)  guideline  criteria.  The  patient  received  3  doses  of  study 
drug (Day 1 in Part Ia, Day 31 in Part Ib and Day 59 in Part Ic). He discontinued treatment due to the 
SAEs and died on Day 81 due to pulmonary hypertension which occurred in association with MAS. 
•  Part II 
No deaths occurred on treatment during Part II.  
However,  one  patient  in  the  placebo  group  died  about  1  month  after  receiving  the  sixth  dose  of 
placebo  in  Part  II.  This  death  was  not  included  in  the  clinical  database  because  the  patient  had 
discontinued  the  study  2  days  before  death  (1  month  after  sixth  and  last  placebo  dose),  but  it  was 
reported  to  the  safety  database.  Patient  0011/00101,  a  15-year-old  Black  female  randomized  to 
placebo in Part II, died on Day 399 (31-Jul-2011) approximately 1 month after receiving the sixth and 
last dose of placebo on Day 365 (27-Jun- 2011) and 2 days after discontinuing the study due to MAS. 
The  patient  received  8  doses  of  canakinumab  in  Part  I  and  6  doses  of  placebo  in  Part  II.  She  was 
initially hospitalized with acute nephrolithiasis which was treated conservatively and then discharged in 
good  condition.  Four  months  later,  she  experienced  SAEs  of  renal  colic,  cardiac  arrest,  pneumonia, 
sepsis (urosepsis), septic shock, a small intracranial hemorrhage and MAS.  
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
General  
Serious  adverse  events  occurred  in  30.8%  of  SJIA  patients  (62.7  SAEs  per  100  patient-years 
exposure).  Infection  SAEs  affected  14.9%  of  patients  in  total  (16.3  SAEs  per  100  patient-years

exposure). No specific infection SAE affected more than 2 (1%) patients, except for gastroenteritis and 
varicella, both occurring in 4 (2%) of patients. 
Study A2203 
In  total  13  patients  (10  in  Stage  I  and  3  in  Stage  II)  had  an  SAE,  two  of  these  patients  had  SAEs 
suspected to be related to study drug. All patients continued in the study.  
Two patients had SAEs that were suspected to be related study drug: 
Patient 5210 (1.5 mg/kg), a 5 year old, Caucasian male had an EBV infection of moderate severity in 
period 4 of Stage I. This patient was noted to have a viral illness prior to receiving his sixth injection 
after a relapse on day 347 of the study. He experienced persistent fever, arthritis and severe anemia 
with  initial  reticulopenia  and  hepatitis  following  this  injection  and  was  admitted  to  hospital  11  days 
after the injection where a serological test was found to be positive for Ign EBV. His condition improved 
and the patient continued in the study receiving a further injection in Stage I and 7 injections in Stage 
II of the study. 
Patient  5408  (at  1.5mg/kg  dose  level),  a  12  year  old,  Caucasian  female  experienced  moderate 
hematoma, moderate prolonged APTT, mild gastroenteritis and mild syncope in period 1 of Stage II, all 
of which were suspected to be related to study drug. This patient had received 4 injections in Stage I 
prior to receiving the first injection in Stage II on study day 355. The patient reported pain in the right 
calf  muscle  38  days  after  this  injection;  she  had  no  thrombosis  or  fever.  An  ultrasound  showed  a 
hematoma in the right calf. Five days later the patient had a vasovagal collapse and was hospitalized 
and she was found to have a prolonged APTT. The patient also developed gastroenteritis. The patient 
was  discharged  3  days  later.  She  completely  recovered  from  the  gastroenteritis  and  all  other 
symptoms had improved.  The patient continued in the study receiving a further 7 injections in  Stage 
II.

Study G2305 
A total of four patients had SAEs, two in each treatment group. Of these, two patients had MAS, one in 
each treatment group. Three of the patients had serious infections: bronchopneumonia (canakinumab; 
bronchopneumonia may have triggered MAS), varicella (canakinumab; child had been vaccinated), and 
gastroenteritis (placebo). No SAEs led to discontinuation, and all resolved without sequelae. 
Study G2301 
•  Part I 
SAEs were reported in 15 (8.5%) patients (one of whom is the patient who died) and led to study drug 
discontinuation  in  5  (2.8%)  patients.  Serious  infections  were  the  most  commonly  reported  class  of 
SAEs  (7  patients,  4.0%)  and  consisted  of  single  events  with  no  predominance  of  organ  class  or 
pathogen. Four (2.3%) patients had MAS (preferred term hematophagic histiocytosis); whereby two of 
these patients had both MAS and a serious infection. The four remaining patients had other disorders 
(hepatitis, abdominal pain, medical device complication and arthritis)  
•  Part II 
SAEs  were  reported  in  6  patients  in  each  of  the  two  treatment  groups  (i.e.  12.0%  each)  and  led  to 
study  drug  discontinuation  in  3  (6.0%)  patients  on  placebo  and  none  on  canakinumab.  Two  (4.0%) 
patients in each treatment group had a serious infection. One patient in the placebo group had MAS. 
The  SOC  “investigations”  (mainly  hepatic  enzymes  increased)  was  increased  in  the  verum  group 
compared to the placebo group (4% vs. 0).  
Study G2301E1 
A total of 30 patients (20.4%) experienced at least 1 SAE.  
Infection and infestations were seen in 15/147 (10.2%; varicella (3, 2%) and gastroenteritis (2, 1.4%) 
were  the  only  infections  reported  in  more  than  1  patient  as  an  SAE;  the  others  were  CMV  infection, 
device  related  sepsis,  febrile  infection,  gastrointestinal  infection,  impetigo,  parvovirus  infection, 
peritonitis,  pharyngitis  streptococcal,  pneumonia,  pseudocroup,  scarlet  fever,  septic  shock,  tonsillitis 
streptococcal,  toxoplasmosis  (see  section  on  infections  above),  varicella,  wound  infection,  yersinia 
infection).  
Musculoskeletal  /  connective  tissue  disorders  were  observed  in  15/147  (10.2%);  13/15  were  SJIA-
related  AEs).  4  patients  experienced  pyrexia,  4  patients  (2.7%)  (or  possibly  8  patients  -see  MAS 
discussion above) experienced MAS.

Laboratory findings 
General  
Hematology 
Hematolgy  summary  data  from  all  SJIA  paediatric  pooled  (A2203,  G2305,  G2301,  G2301E1  up  to 
G2301E1 interim analysis database lock, also compared to CAPS).  
Eosinophils 
There was no clear relationship between patients with elevated eosinophil counts and increased rate of 
hypersensitivity  reactions.  AEs  related  to  atopy  or  allergy  were  reported  in  temporal  association  with 
the elevated eosinophil counts in 11 patients, but there were no such AEs in 54 patients. Ten patients

had  AEs  related  to  atopy  or  allergy,  but  which  did  not  occur  within  a  short  time  (42  days)  of  the 
abnormal eosinophil counts.  
Neutrophils 
An  increased  rate  of  infections  was  not  observed  among  the  patients  with  low  neutrophil  counts.  38 
patients had a Grade 2 neutrophil count; thereof 18 had infections (mostly mild, no severe infections). 
Three of the 11 SJIA patients with Grade 3 neutrophil counts had infection AEs that occurred within 42 
days  of  the  low  neutrophil  count.  The  one  patient  with  a  Grade  4  absolute  neutrophil  count  did  not 
have any infection AEs reported at or near the time the abnormality was reported. 
Platelets 
The 8 patients (4.0%) with low platelet counts (<100 x 109/L) did not have bleeding-related AEs.  
Canakinumab exposure and hematological abnormalities  
Canakinumab predicted exposure data were available for 188 patients, although the numbers declined 
over  time.  Canakinumab  concentrations  in  patients  with  notable  abnormalities  of  hemoglobin  levels, 
platelet  counts  or  absolute  WBC  counts  were  similar  to  those  in  patients  without  such  abnormalities. 
Patients who had low neutrophil counts (post-baseline values of < 0.9 x LLN) had higher canakinumab 
concentrations than subjects who had neutrophil counts that remained within the normal range. 
Clinical Chemistry  
In canakinumab-treated SJIA patients, elevations of serum transaminases (ALT and/or AST) 
occurred  in  approximately  41%  of  patients,  whereby  37.8%  had  at  least  one  elevated  alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) value, 34.3% had an elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) value, 10.0% 
had an elevated alkaline phosphatase value, and 1.5% had an elevated bilirubin value. No cases met 
the definition of Hy’s Law.  
In  canakinumab-treated  patients,  an  apparent  ≥25%  decrease  in  estimated  creatinine  clearance  was 
recorded in 14.6% of patients. 
One  patient  (0.5%)  had  an  elevated  cholesterol  value  of  ≥1.5×ULN  and  one  (0.5%)  had  a  notable 
triglyceride value of ≥5.7 mmol/L. 
These  laboratory  changes  were  not  associated  with  clinical  sequelae,  and  none  of  them  resulted  in 
study discontinuation. 
Laboratory values: comparison between verum and placebo groups  
Decreased  white  blood  cell  counts  (WBC)  ≤ 0.8 × LLN  were  reported  in  5  (10.4%)  patients  on 
canakinumab  and  2  (4.0%)  on  placebo.  Decreased  absolute  neutrophils  counts  (ANC)  to  <1x109/L 
were reported in 3 (6.0%) patients on canakinumab and 1 (2.2%) on placebo. One case of ANC counts 
<0.5x109/L  was  observed  with  canakinumab  and  none  with  placebo.  Mild  decreases  (<LLN  and 
>75x109/L)  in  platelet  counts,  which  were  transient  were  observed  in  3  (6.3%)  patients  on 
canakinumab and 1 (2.0%) on placebo. 
Notably high ALT and/or AST values >3×ULN were reported in 2 (4.1%) patients on canakinumab and 
1 (2.0%) on placebo.

Creatinine Clearance 
Study A2203 
All of the patients had at least one clinical laboratory test result outside of the normal range at some 
point  during  the  study.  Generally  these  either  occurred  only  at  one  or  two  time  points  with  no 
consistency for any variable or the values were out of range at screening and/or baseline and remained 
so throughout the study. The majority of patients had low albumin values and low hemoglobin values 
throughout the study.

Antibodies  
Six (3.1%) of SJIA patients had positive anti-canakinumab binding antibodies, none were neutralizing 
and  they  were  not  associated  with  the  development  of  any  immunogenicity-associated  AEs  that 
indicated hypersensitivity or the presence of any allergic reactions or other clinical sequelae. 
Furthermore no real loss of efficacy cases could be observed within CAPS and gouty arthritis. Changes 
in  drug  clearance  were  also  analysed  as  potential  early  signals  of  anti-drug  antibodies  (ADA)  which 
could  lead  to  loss  of  efficacy.  The  model-based  parameters  provided  no  evidence  of  unusual 
pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic behaviour in subjects that were identified as ADA positive.

Safety in special populations 
There were no dedicated trials in special patient populations (e.g. renal / hepatic impairment). 
The company has been requested to provide an analysis of AEs by age group and gender (as done for 
Study G2305) in Studies A2203, G2301 and G2301E1 (see AEs above) . 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No drug-drug interaction studies were performed. In the SPC under Section 4.5 the following is stated: 
An  increased  incidence  of  serious  infections  has  been  associated  with  administration  of  another  IL-1 
blocker  in  combination  with  TNF  inhibitors.  Use  of  Ilaris  with  TNF  inhibitors  is  not  recommended 
because this may increase the risk of serious infections. 
The expression of hepatic CYP450 enzymes may be suppressed by the cytokines that stimulate chronic 
inflammation,  such  as  IL-1  beta.  Thus,  CYP450  expression  may  be  reversed  when  potent  cytokine 
inhibitory therapy, such as canakinumab, is introduced. This is clinically relevant for CYP450 substrates 
with a narrow therapeutic index where the dose is individually adjusted. On initiation of canakinumab 
in patients being treated with this type of medicinal product, therapeutic monitoring of the effect or of 
the  active  substance  concentration  should  be  performed  and  the  individual  dose  of  the  medicinal 
product adjusted as necessary. 
No data are available on either the effects of live vaccination or the secondary transmission of infection 
by  live  vaccines  in  patients  receiving  Ilaris.  Therefore,  live  vaccines  should  not  be  given  concurrently 
with  Ilaris  unless  the  benefits  clearly  outweigh  the  risks.  Should  vaccination  with  live  vaccines  be 
indicated after initiation of Ilaris treatment, the recommendation is to wait for at least 3 months after 
the last Ilaris injection and before the next one. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The rate of discontinuation due to AEs was 9.5%, mainly due to SJIA flares (4.5%) or to MAS (2.5%). 
This rate is higher than in the CAPS population where discontinuations due to AEs were only 3.9%. The 
nature of AEs leading to discontinuation covered all SOCs and their main preferred terms as described 
under adverse events.

Study A2203 
In  general,  a  total  of  6/23  patients  (26.1%)  discontinued  the  study  mainly  due  to  unsatisfactory 
therapeutic effect (21.7%).  
Most  of  AEs  were  of  mild  to  moderate  severity,  unrelated  to  study  drug  and  did  not  lead  to 
discontinuation. 
Study G2305 
No patient discontinued study treatment due to adverse events. 
Study G2301 
•  Part I 
Five  (2.8%)  patients  experienced  at  least  one  AE  during  Part  I  that  led  to  discontinuation  of  study 
drug: 
o  Patient 0115/00109 did not complete Part I due to death from pulmonary hypertension 
(see deaths above) 
o  Two  patients  (0034/00107  and  0510/00101)  discontinued  due  to  hematophagic 
histiocytosis (MAS). The MAS was adjudicated by the MASAC as some clinical features 
of MAS, but with alternative explanation (drug reaction) for patient 0034/00107 and as 
clinically  consistent  with  MAS  with  either  histologic  confirmation  or  having  met  the 
current formal HLH guideline criteria for patient 0510/00101  
o  Patient  0020/00104  discontinued  due  to  increased  C-reactive  protein,  increased  liver 
enzymes (alkaline phosphatase was 507 U/L on Day 57), increased platelet count and 
increased WBC count. 
o  Patient 0120/00102 discontinued due to juvenile arthritis (sJIA exacerbation). 
•  Part II 
Six  (12.0%)  patients  in  the  placebo  group  and  none  in  the  canakinumab  group  discontinued  study 
treatment during Part II due to an AE. The 6 placebo patients who discontinued due to an AE in Part II 
were as follows: 
o  Patient  0011/00101  had  multiple  AEs  leading  to  death:  cardiac  arrest,  pneumonia, 
sepsis (urosepsis), septic shock, a small intracranial hemorrhage and MAS (see deaths 
above).  
o  Patient  0042/00101  had  multiple  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation:  maculopapular  rash, 
oral  disorder,  measles,  pneumonia,  and  respiratory  failure  (distress).  All  events  were 
also reported as SAEs. 
o  Patient  0081/00103  discontinued  due 
to 
juvenile  arthritis 
(acute 
sJIA 
exacerbation/flare). This event was also reported as an SAE. 
o  Patient  0040/00111  discontinued  due  to  non-serious  rash  (worsening  due  to

o  Patient 0115/00107 discontinued due to non-serious vomiting. 
o  Patient 0148/00103 discontinued due to non-serious uveitis.

Study G2301E1  
A total of 9/147 (6.1%) patients experienced AEs that resulted in discontinuation of study drug  
Eight  of  these  patients  were  also  SAEs.  The  events  that  led  to  discontinuation  were  juvenile 
arthritis/arthralgia  (7  patients;  4.8%)  and  histiocytosis  haematophagic  (2  patients,  1.4%); 
hepatobiliary disorders (1.4%), splenomegaly, pericarditis, abdominal pain and pyrexia in one patient

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Approximately  2,500  subjects  have  been  treated  with  Ilaris  in  blinded  and  open-label  clinical  trials  in 
patients with CAPS, gouty arthritis or other IL-1 beta mediated diseases, and healthy volunteers. The 
cumulative  patient  exposure  since  the  first  launch  of  the  product  is  estimated  to  be  approximately 
1284 patient-treatment-years (PTY). 
For  the  current  submission 201  SJIA  patients,  with  301  patient-years  of  exposure  were  treated  for  a 
median of 617 days (minimum 4, maximum 1829 days) with a median number of 22 doses (minimum 
1 and maximum 49). This exposure is considered an adequate dataset for the extension of indication. 
The median duration of exposure is acceptable given the chronic nature of SJIA. However, the median 
duration  may  be  too  short  to  correctly  assess  the  rate  of  occurrence  of  rarer  and  infrequent  events 
such  as  MAS.  Thus  the  applicant  will  perform  a  post  authorisation  registry  to  capture  long-term  data 
and provide new information on possible correlations as outlined in the RMP. 
The  safety  database  for  SJIA  encompasses  3  completed  studies  A2203,  G2305  and  G2301,  and  an 
interim report from the ongoing extension Study G2301E1.  
Prior to this submission the main identified canakinumab risks included serious infections, neutropenia 
and  thrombocytopenia.  In  addition,  following  the  4th  PSUR  (1  Jan  2011  –  30  Jun  2011)  the  concern 
with regard to an increased frequency of Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) in patients with SJIA 
was raised.  
In  the  SJIA  pooled  population,  85.1%  of  patients  experienced  at  least  1  AE. The  most  often  affected 
system  organ  classes  (SOCs)  in  SJIA  studies  were  infections  and  infestations  (71.1%),  followed  by 
gastrointestinal  disorders,  (52.7%),  musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders  (41.8%),  and 
respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders  (38.3%).  This  sequence  was  the  same  when  adjusted 
by  exposure.  The  most  frequently  reported  AEs  by  preferred  term  were  nasopharyngitis  (29.4%), 
cough  (25.9%),  pyrexia  (25.9%),  vomiting  (22.9%),  diarrhea  (22.4%),  upper  respiratory  tract 
infection (22.4%) and headache (20.9%).  
Most  AEs  were  of  mild  or  moderate  intensity;  with  16.9%  of  SJIA  patients  having  severe  AEs  (this 
compares to the data on severe AEs in CAPS children at 15.6%). AEs of gastrointestinal disorders were 
mainly mild, only 3.0% of SJIA children and no CAPS children having severe events. AEs of infections 
and infestations were mainly mild or moderate, with 6.0% of SJIA children and 7.8% of CAPS children 
having severe events. 
In  general  plasma  canakinumab  levels  were  not  higher  in  patients  with  selected  AEs  (e.g.,  infection, 
MAS, pyrexia, SAE of infection and abdominal pain) compared to those without these AEs. In contrast 
more adverse events were seen in the studies on SJIA than in the studies on other indications which  
could be due to the higher dose applied in this indication. Canakinumab dose reduction from 4 mg/kg 
to  2  mg/kg  in  steroid  free  patients  was  permitted  in  the  extension  study  G2301E1  on  the  request  of 
the  treating  physician.  Twenty-six  patients,  aged  4  –  19  years,  received  at  least  three  consecutive  2 
mg/kg  doses.  All  26  patients  had  an  ACR100  throughout  the  time  the  reduced  dose  was  given.  No 
Ilaris

patient who received a reduced canakinumab dose  discontinued from the study due to unsatisfactory 
therapeutic effect. 
While the number of patients successfully reducing canakinumab dose is limited to date, a reasonable 
conclusion can be drawn from the available data that dose reduction can be achieved in some patients.  
To gain more insight on canakinumab dose reduction, the MAH committed within the RMP to a new 
phase IV study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of canakinumab dose reduction or dose interval 
prolongation in canakinumab treatment- naïve patients who are both responders and who satisfy pre-
defined criteria.  
In general the ADRs mirror the main AEs as listed above (i.e. infections and gastrointestinal disorders) 
In Study G2301 for the SOC infections ADRS were seen in ~ 55% of the patients (vs. 38% in the 
placebo group) and in 30% in the 4-week study G2301 (compared to 12% in the corresponding 
placebo group). In Study G2301 for the SOC gastrointestinal disorders ADRS were seen in ~ 14-16% 
of the patients (vs. 12% in the placebo group) and in 7% in the 4-week study G2301 (compared to 
2.4% in the corresponding placebo group). Infections, gastroenteritis and abdominal pain are included 
as adverse drug reactions (ADR) in the SmPC. Infections including gastrointestinal infections is an 
identified risk of canakinumab treatment and included in the RMP with appropriate pharmacovigilance 
activities and risk minimization measures.  
There were 4 deaths in SJIA patients; none were considered related to canakinumab by the reporting 
investigator. Three of the four deaths occurred a considerable time after the last dose of canakinumab 
(4 months to 2 years). The fourth patient died after developing MAS approximately 3 weeks after the 
last dose of canakinumab, after severe gastroenteritis and subsequent pulmonary hypertension. As the 
occurrence  of  gastroenteritis  or  other  infections  are  increased  under  canakinumab  this  in  turn  could 
have  triggered  the  further  sequence  of  events.  The  SmPC  includes  appropriate  warning  statements 
with  regards  to  an  increased  incidence  of  serious  infections  and  infection  is  followed  as  an  important 
identified risk in the RMP. 
After an in-depth review of the 8 pulmonary complication AEs identified by SMQs and SOC reviews of 
the  SJIA  and  CAPS  pediatric  pooled  populations,  all  except  chronic  bronchitis  (2  AEs  in  one  patient) 
were single events. Four events were complications of MAS or SJIA flare.  
The available patient population is too small to draw any firm conclusions toward a direct link between 
canakinumab and pulmonary complications. There is an unconfirmed signal for increased incidence of 
pulmonary complications in SJIA patients treated with IL-1 inhibitors. To closely monitor these events 
in the remit of the RMP pulmonary complications were made as potential risk. 
Serious adverse events occurred in approximately a third of SJIA patients (62.7 SAEs per 100 patient-
years exposure). Infection SAEs affected 14.9% of patients in total (16.3 SAEs per 100 patient-years 
exposure). No specific infection SAE affected more than 2 (1%) patients, except for gastroenteritis and 
varicella,  both  occurring  in  4  (2%)  of  patients.  With  the  exception  of  MAS  and  musculoskeletal 
disorders  the  SAE  profile  (but  not  the  frequencies)  was  similar  between  the  SJIA  and  CAPS  pediatric 
populations. Overall more patients had SAEs in SJIA than in CAPS (30.8% vs. 18.2 %).  
Infections  are  a  known  risk  for  canakinumab,  as  well  as  for  the  class  of  anti-IL-1  therapies.  When 
adjusted  for  exposure  (per  100  patient  years),  there  was  a  slight  increase  in  infections  in  the  SJIA 
population compared to CAPS (264.9 vs 238.4 respectively). The nature of the infections did not seem 
to  undergo  major  changes  from  those  previously  described  and  opportunistic  infections  were  not  a 
concern. The role of canakinumab in the development of infection is unclear; however, infection is an 
identified risk for canakinumab and included in the RMP with appropriate risk minimization measures. 
In  addition,  warning  statements  in  the  PI  makes  prescribers  and  patients  aware  about  the  increased 
risk of infections.

The  main  difference  between  the  SJIA  and  the  CAPS  population  is  the  occurrence  of  MAS.  All  cases 
were  adjudicated  by  the  MASAC.  When  comparing  the  occurrence  of  MAS  in  the  canakinumab  and 
placebo  groups  across  the  different  trials  and  adjusting  this  to  100  patient-years  (4.3  vs.  7.7 
respectively), there does not seem to be an increase in MAS in the canakinumab group.  
This calculation is, however, fraught with difficulty given the small numbers in the placebo group and a 
tenth of the exposure years. In addition the background incidence of MAS is difficult to estimate from 
the mainly uncontrolled/retrospective reports in the literature.  
No  definite  conclusion  can  be  made  about  a  possible  increase  of  MAS  in  SJIA  patients  treated  with 
canakinumab.  In  a  planned  Pharmachild  registry  the  applicant  committed  to  capture  AEs  of  special 
interest  in  subjects  with  SJIA,  such  as  MAS  as  outlined  in  the  RMP.  Within  this  registry  the  applicant 
will also provide 3 years of analysis on patients for all of the identified and potential risks. 
A further reason of concern is founded on the absence of treatment naïve patients as a consequence of 
the  withdrawal  design  of  Study  G2301.  The  withdrawal  design  is  in  accordance  with  EMA 
recommendations to obtain data for an optimal efficacy assessment. In case adverse events show an 
unequal distribution across the study groups of part II (as occurred in G2301), external validity may be 
questioned. To address this issue, the MAH opened enrolment of the extension study G2301E1 to new 
canakinumab-naïve  patients  and  extended  the  study  end  date  to  June  2014  to  allow  for  additional 
collection of long-term efficacy and safety data as outlined in the RMP.  
The potential risk of MAS is appropriately mitigated with inclusion of warnings in 4.4. of the SmPC. In 
addition,  the  prescription  of  canakinumab  is  restricted  to  specialist  physicians  experienced  in  the 
diagnosis  and  treatment  of  SJIA.  In  order  to  increase  the  effectiveness  of  risk  communication  and 
management, physician information will be provided to all prescribing physicians educating them about 
the early diagnosis, risk factors (e.g. infections and SJIA flare) and treatment of MAS as outlined in the 
RMP. 
An alert card indicating in lay language the potential risk for MAS will be provided to all patients with 
SJIA receiving canakinumab. The alert card will also request patients to contact their doctors in case of 
SJIA aggravation or development of an infection.  
Lack of efficacy 
In  Study  G2301  Part  II  the  canakinumab  group  had  a  higher  exposure-adjusted  incidence  of 
musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders  (0.42  canakinumab  vs.  0.19  placebo),  particularly 
arthralgia (0.15 vs. 0.06) and back pain (0.09 vs. 0.00) compared with the placebo group.  
The exposure-adjusted incidence rates have been re-calculated after omitting AEs for which alternative 
explanations  could  be  identified.  In  this  analysis,  combined  AEs  in  both  “Joint  subgroup”  and 
“Musculoskeletal  pain  subgroup”  were  approximately  twice  more  common  in  the  canakinumab  group 
compared  to  the  placebo  group,  while  no  statistical  difference  in  the  incidence  rates  was  observed. 
Musculoskeletal  pain  is  listed  as  a  common  adverse  drug  reaction  in  the  SmPC  and  was  made 
important identified risk in the RMP for canakinumab treatment in SJIA. 
Summarising,  in  the  pooled  data  of  all  SJIA  studies  the  rate  of  discontinuation  due  to  AEs  was  5.5% 
and the rate of discontinuation due to unsatisfactory therapeutic event was 31.3%. This unsatisfactory 
therapeutic  outcome  is  rather  high  (especially  in  comparison  to  CAPS);  taken  together  with  the 
musculoskeletal  disorders  and  additional  medication  needed  for  these  disorders  the  benefit  is 
somewhat narrowed.  
Approximately  20%  of  patients  did  not  reach  the  ACR  Pediatric  30  response.  Also,  there  were  a 
number of subjects who initially responded but subsequently lost their response. Thus, there is still a 
group of patients who do not respond to this anti-IL-1 β targeting therapy.

To minimize the risk of lack of efficacy the SmPC states that continued treatment with Ilaris in patients 
without clinical improvement should be reconsidered by the treating physician. As outlined in the RMP 
additional long term data on safety and efficacy in SJIA will be generated by the following activities: 
(1)Pharmachild registry; (2) the re-opened first extension to open label study G2301E1; (3) the phase 
IV dose reduction study.  
Laboratory findings 
Changes in laboratory parameters in SJIA depend on the activity of the underlying inflammatory state 
and the type of treatment that ensues. Generally, SJIA patients present with anemia, neutrophilia, and 
thrombocytosis,  but  also  often  have  transaminase  elevations.  Treatment  such  as  canakinumab  can 
revert these changes by reducing the inflammation through reduction of IL-1β, this in turn can result in 
increases  in  hemoglobin,  reduction  of  neutrophils  and  reduction  of  platelets.  Improvements  in  CRP, 
ferritin, and fibrinogen were seen with canakinumab treatment compared with placebo consistent with 
clinical improvement of sJIA.  
The  most  common  clinically  notable  hematology  abnormalities  relative  to  upper  or  lower  limit  of 
normal (ULN, LLN) were eosinophil counts ≥1.1 x ULN (37.5% of SJIA patients); lymphocyte counts < 
LLN  (23.0%),  WBC  counts  ≤0.8  x  LLN  (16.5%)  and    low  hemoglobin  (8.5%).  Low  neutrophil  counts 
(<1.0 x 109/L) occurred in 6.0% of patients, including 1 (0.5%) patient with a CTC Grade 4 neutrophil 
count (<0.5 x 109/L) on a single assessment. 
Neutropenia has already been an identified risk for the other canakinumab approved indications and is 
appropriately  labelled  in  SmPC.  The  neutrophil  count  was  the  only  safety  parameter  for  which  a 
concentration  dependency  could  be  observed.  The  “IC50  parameter  for  the  neutrophil  loss”  is 
estimated to  be  about  9.1  ug/mL.  Patients  who  had  low  neutrophil  counts  (post-baseline  values  of  < 
0.9  x  LLN)  had  higher  canakinumab  concentrations  than  subjects  who  had  neutrophil  counts  that 
remained within the normal range. On the other hand, the “IC50 parameter for the freedom of flares” 
equals  to  3.3  ug/mL derived  from  the  PK-hazard  model  (IC90:  29.4  µg/mL).  Thus,  there  is  a  narrow 
but acceptable window of discrimination between efficacy and safety. Predicted steady state values for 
serum canakinumab in sJIA patients after 4 mg/kg 4-weekly (mean of all ages) are 14.7 (Ctrough,ss) 
and  36.5  (Cmax,ss)  µg/mL.  Due  to  the  higher  dosing  regimen  these  levels  are  markedly  higher 
compared  to  the  canakinumab  levels  in  CAPS  children  <40  kg  after  the  2  mg/kg  8-weekly  dosing 
regimen (4 and 19.9 µg/mL, respectively). Cmax predictions are highly uncertain due to the lack of PK 
samples around Cmax in the pivotal studies. An increased rate of infections was not observed among 
the patients with low neutrophil counts. 
The  small  proportion  of  patients  (4.0%)  with  low  platelet  counts  (<100  x  109/L)  had  no  evidence  of 
bleeding-related  AEs.  Thrombocytopenia  was  already  an  identified  risk  for  the  other  canakinumab 
indications and is appropriately labelled in the PI. Patients with elevated eosinophil counts did not show 
an  increased  rate  of  hypersensitivity  reactions.  Only  a  minor  part  of  the  patients  had  concomitant 
allergies.  Eosinophilia  was  made  potential  risk  in  the  RMP  and  cumulative  reviews  on  cases  of 
eosinophilia will be provided in the PSURs. 
Leukopenia  is  a  frequent  finding  in  the  SJIA  population  treated  with  canakinumab.  16.5%  of  patients 
had  notable  leukopenia  i.e.  WBC  equal  to  or  less  than  0.8  X  LLN.  Most  events  were  leukopenia  only 
(70.6%)  while  25%  comprised  of  leukopenia  and  neutropenia  and  4.4%  of  leukopenia,  neutropenia 
and lymphocytopenia. 
To  balance  adequately  the  risk  of  the  laboratory  findings  Leukopenia  was  made  identified  risk  in  the 
RMP for SJIA patients and leukopenia was included within the existing neutropenia warnings in SmPC 
Section 4.4 and SmPC.

In canakinumab-treated SJIA patients, elevations of serum transaminases  (ALT and/or AST) occurred 
in approximately 41% of patients, whereby 37.8% had at least one elevated alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT)  value,  34.3%  had  an  elevated  aspartate,  34.3%  had  an  elevated  aspartate  aminotransferase 
(AST)  value,  10.0%  had  an  elevated  alkaline  phosphatase  value,  and  1.5%  had  an  elevated  bilirubin 
value.  Notably  high  ALT  and/or  AST  values  >3×ULN  were  reported  in  2  (4.1%)  patients  on 
canakinumab and 1 (2.0%) on placebo. No cases met the definition of Hy’s Law. 
The MAH analyzed and reviewed hepatic enzymes over time for all studies no clear trends were seen 
and  hepatic  values  generally  remained  stable  over  time.  In  the  placebo  controlled  Part  2of  Study 
G2301 no definite distinctions could be made between the placebo and verum groups. The magnitude 
of  the  difference,  compared  with  the  comparator  group  (placebo  or  active  substance),  on  the  liver 
parameters of interest was not large enough to suggest a causal relationship however due to the fact 
that  DILI  events  were  observed  in  several  canakinumab  clinical  trials  drug  induced  liver  disease  was 
included  as  an  identified  risk  in  the  RMP  to  be  followed  up  within  the  Pharmachild  SJIA  registry  and 
cumulative reviews in coming PSURs.  
In the SJIA pooled safety population 29 (14%) patients had at least one notable decreased estimated 
creatinine clearance and 75 (37%) patients had at least one notable urinary proteinuria but without 
clinical evidence of genuine renal function deterioration. Eight patients (4%) had both a notable 
decrease in creatinine clearance and urinary proteinuria simultaneously at least once. Noticeably fewer 
CAPS vs SJIA paediatric patients had positive testing for proteinuria (15.6% vs 35.6%).” 
Decreased creatinine clearance and urinary proteinuria was added to the identified risks in the RMP (to 
be followed by the Pharmachild registry) and to 4.8 of the SmPC.  
2.5.3.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
SJIA is a serious condition responsible for high childhood mortality and severe morbidity and disability. 
Taking into consideration that therapeutic options are limited and partially very toxic, the safety profile 
for canakinumab treatment in SJIA patients is acceptable. Safety concerns are considered adequately 
balanced  with  the  proposed  SmPC  and  RMP.  Further  data  on  identified  and  potential  risks  will  be 
provided  through  the  Pharmachild  registry  and  the  re-opened  first  extension  to  open  label  study 
G2301E1.  Further  the  applicant  committed  to  generate  efficacy  and  safety  data  on  dose  reduction  or 
dose interval prolongation in SJIA as outlined in the RMP.  
2.5.4.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged.  
2.6.  Risk management plan

corticosteroids. Ilaris can be given as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate. 
could  be  acceptable  provided  an  updated  risk  management  plan  and  satisfactory  responses  to  the 
questions detailed in this Section are submitted. 
This advice is based on the following content of the Risk Management Plan:

The PRAC considers that the following issues should be addressed: 
•  Decreased creatinine clearance and urinary proteinuria should be added to the identified risks 
in the RMP 
•  DILI should be re-classified from a potential to an identified risk  
• 
• 
Leukopenia should be considered as an additional identified risk in the RMP in addition to the 
already listed neutropenia 
Pulmonary complications in SJIA should be included in the RMP and classified as identified risk

•  Musculoskeletal pain and arthralgia should be considered as an identified risk for the RMP of 
the SJIA indication 
• 
Eosinophilia in SJIA-patients should be included in the RMP and classified as a potential risk. 
Routine risk minimisation measures are Pharmacovigilance activities should be considered to minimise 
and further characterise these new identified and potential risks which are not included in the RMP. 
The  PRAC  also  noted  the  higher  rate  of  discontinuation  due  to  unsatisfactory  therapeutic  response  in 
SJIA compared to CAPS. The MAH is therefore requested to present clear guidance for the continuation 
or withdrawal of Ilaris in non-responding patients with SJIA. 
Due  to  the  uncertainties  regarding  the  validity  of  the  tuberculosis  screening  tests  in  Ilaris-treated 
patients the MAH should present a cumulative overview of all events of tuberculosis and all events of 
positive test results. The analysis should include the Post-marketing experience and the CTs stratified 
to  the  indication  for  Ilaris  including  the  SJIA  study  program.  The  type  of  screening  test  used  (e.g. 
tuberculin  skin  test,  interferon  gamma  release  assay  or  chest  X-ray)  and  the  outcome  should  be 
considered. 
Finally, the MAH is asked to include the findings from PK/PD data from the SJIA program in the RMP in 
order  to  substantiate  the dose  dependency  of  neutropenia  in  children /  adolescents  and  to  remind  of 
the relatively small therapeutic window

The  other  issues  raised  in  the  PRAC  assessment  of  the  RMP  were  also  adequately  addressed  in  the 
updated RMP provided by the MAH.  
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information   
As a consequence of this new indication sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC 
have  been  updated.  Annex  II  and  sections  1,  2,  3  and  4  of  the  Package  Leaflet  were  updated 
accordingly. 
Particularly, a new warning with regard to Leukopenia and Macrophage activation syndrome has been 
added to the product information. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Changes  were  also  made  to  the  PI  to  bring  it  in  line  with  the  current  Agency/QRD  template,  SmPC 
guideline and other relevant guideline(s), which were reviewed by QRD and accepted by the CHMP. 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
MAH  show  that  the  package  leaflet  does  not  yet  meet  the  criteria  for  readability  as  set  out  in  the 
Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. The 
applicant  will  address  the  following  minor  issues  concerning  the  user  consultation  with  target  patient 
group population on the package leaflet: 
• 
To submit an additional reduced readability test (1 round of testing with ten participants) with 
the next forthcoming type II variation which will affect the content of the package leaflet. 
In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised to amend contact details for the 
local representatives of Malta and Croatia. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Clinically  highly  relevant,  rapid  and  sustained  efficacy  of  canakinumab  in  the  treatment  of  SJIA  has 
been demonstrated. Canakinumab was superior to placebo in achieving the adapted ACR pediatric 30 
criteria  at  Day  15  (83.7%  vs.  9.8%;  odds  ratio  of  62.3;  95%  CI:  12.7,  306.1,  p<0.0001).  In  the 
pooled  12-week  efficacy  data,  79.8%  of  subjects  achieved  ACR30  response  and  57.3%  achieved 
ACR70  response  by  Day  15  and  maintenance  of  the  response  was  demonstrated  in  patients  initially 
responding  to  treatment.  The  number  of  subjects  achieving  highest  ACR  responses  (ACR90  and 
ACR100)  was  increasing  with  time  up to  Day  85.  Successful  steroid  tapering was  achieved  by  44.5% 
(p<0.0001;  90%  CI:  37.1,  52.2).  The  probability  to  experience  a  flare  event  was  lower  for 
canakinumab  treatment  compared  with  placebo  treatment  (relative  risk  reduction  to  flare  of  64%; 
hazard ratio of 0.36; 95% CI: 0.17 to 0.75; p=0.0032).  
Ilaris 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/427081/2013  
Page 158/165 
 
 
 
 
In the ongoing extension study, with the longest follow-up periods between 2 and 3 years, the efficacy 
of canakinumab was largely maintained. 
With  regard  to  the  concomitant  therapies,  patients  who  used  canakinumab  monotherapy  showed 
highest response rates based on ACR30-100 criteria; significant responses were also seen in patients 
with concomitant methotrexate. In addition, relevant responses were seen in the group of patients who 
discontinued anakinra or tocilizumab due to lack of efficacy. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Approximately 20% of patients did not reach the ACR Pediatric 30 response. It is uncertain how long 
the treatment should be continued if no rapid clinical response is seen. To minimize this risk of lack of 
efficacy the SmPC states that continued treatment with Ilaris in patients without clinical improvement 
should be reconsidered by the treating physician. 
There were a number of subjects who initially responded but subsequently lost their response. So far it 
is not finally assessable if a long term effect will be sustained. As outlined in the RMP additional long 
term data on safety and efficacy in SJIA will be generated by the following activities: 
(1)Pharmachild registry; (2) the re-opened first extension to open label study G2301E1; (3) the phase 
IV dose reduction study.  
It  is  currently  unknown  if  patients,  who  achieve  inactive  or  stable,  less  active  disease  might  be 
maintained with a lower dose or less frequent dosing schedule long-term. While the number of patients 
successfully reducing canakinumab dose is limited to date, a reasonable conclusion can be drawn from 
the available data that dose reduction can be achieved in some patients. This is in so far relevant from 
a safety perspective as more adverse events were seen in the studies on SJIA than in the studies on 
other indications which  could be due to the higher dose applied in this indication. 
To  gain  more  insight  on  canakinumab  dose  reduction,  the  MAH  committed  within  the  RMP  to  a  new 
phase  IV  study  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  canakinumab  dose  reduction  or  dose  interval 
prolongation in canakinumab treatment- naïve patients who are both responders and who satisfy pre-
defined criteria.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
In the SJIA pooled population, 85.1% of patients experienced at least 1 AE. The SOCs most frequently 
affected  by  AEs  were  ‘Infections  and  infestations’  (71.1%  of  patients);  ‘Gastrointestinal  disorders’ 
(52.7%);  and  ‘Musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders’  (41.8%).  Most  AEs  were  of  mild  or 
moderate  intensity.  In  particular,  gastrointestinal  AEs  such  as  vomiting,  diarrhea,  abdominal  pain, 
upper  abdominal  pain  and  nausea  were  frequently  reported  in  the  SJIA  population  compared  to  the 
CAPS  population.  Infection  is  an  expected  side  effect  of  canakinumab  due  to  its  mode  of  action. 
Infections  including  gastrointestinal  infections  are  an  identified  risk  of  canakinumab  treatment  and 
included  in  the  RMP  with  appropriate  pharmacovigilance  activities  and  risk  minimization  measures. 
Gastroenteritis and abdominal pain are included as adverse drug reactions in the SmPC for SJIA. 
Serious infections, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred both in the CAPS and SJIA studies but 
overall more patients had SAEs in SJIA than in CAPS. With the exception of MAS and musculoskeletal 
disorders the SAE profile (but not the frequencies) was similar between the SJIA and CAPS in this more 
severely diseased population. 
Ilaris 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/427081/2013  
Page 159/165 
 
 
 
Whereas neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and infection have been already identified risk for the other 
canakinumab indications and are appropriately labelled in the product information leukopenia is a 
frequent finding in the SJIA population treated with canakinumab. Leukopenia was made identified risk 
in the RMP for SJIA patients and the risk is considered adequately mitigated with the inclusion of 
leukopenia within the existing neutropenia warnings in SmPC Section 4.4. Musculoskeletal pain is listed 
as a common adverse drug reaction in the SmPC and was made important identified risk in the RMP for 
canakinumab treatment in SJIA. 
Decreased  creatinine  clearance  and  urinary  proteinuria  without  renal  function  deterioration  was 
observed in the SJIA pooled safety population. Noticeably fewer CAPS vs SJIA paediatric patients had 
positive  testing  for  proteinuria  (15.6%  vs  35.6%).    Decreased  creatinine  clearance  and  urinary 
proteinuria  was  added  to the  identified  risks  in  the  RMP  and  to  4.8  of  the  SmPC  concerning  the  SJIA 
indication. 
MAS  was  classified  under  the  SOC  neoplasma,  thus  neoplasmas  were  higher  in  SJIA  than  in  CAPS 
solely  due  to  MAS:  8.6  vs.  2.1.  MAS  may  occur  spontaneously  during  a  flare  of  SJIA,  or  may  be 
triggered  by  any  infectious  agent.  When  comparing  the  occurrence  of  MAS  in  the  canakinumab  and 
placebo  groups  across  the  different  trials  and  adjusting  this  to  100  patient-years  (4.3  vs.  7.7 
respectively), there does not seem to be an increase in MAS in the canakinumab group. However, the 
role of canakinumab in this setting is still under evaluation; on the one hand canakinumab can trigger 
infections  and  thus  release  a  cascade  of  events  leading  to  MAS.  On  the  other  hand  by  reducing  the 
flares  in  SJIA,  the  equation  may  be  balanced  in  favour  of  less  MAS  events.  (See  next  paragraph  on 
“Uncertainty”). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Macrophage  activation  syndrome  (MAS)  is  a  well-known  and  potentially  fatal complication  of  SJIA.  In 
the  scientific  community  a  clear  understanding  of  the  pathogenesis  and  aetiology  of  MAS  is  still 
lacking. The background incidence of is difficult to estimate due to the fact that robust epidemiological 
data are missing and thus the role of canakinumab  in this setting is  hard to calculate. This is further 
encumbered  by  the  design  of  the  pivotal  trial  G2301:  due  to  the  withdrawal  approach  (albeit  in 
accordance with EMA recommendations to obtain data for an optimal efficacy assessment) there are no 
treatment naïve patients to compare to. Study G2305, although placebo controlled, is relatively small 
and  short  and  therefore  also  does  not  suffice.  Triggers  of  MAS  include  modifications  of  drug  therapy. 
The role of  novel biologic therapies with respect to the risk or the severity of MAS is  not fully known 
and no definite conclusion can be made about a possible increase of MAS in SJIA patients treated with 
canakinumab. For the granting of a marketing authorisation the potential risk of MAS is appropriately 
mitigated with inclusion of the appropriate warnings in 4.4. of the SmPC. In addition, the prescription 
of  canakinumab  is  restricted  to  specialist  physicians  experienced  in  the  diagnosis  and  treatment  of 
SJIA.  In  order  to  increase  the  effectiveness  of  risk  communication  and  management,  physician 
information will be provided to all prescribing physicians educating them about the early diagnosis, risk 
factors (e.g. infections and SJIA flare) and treatment of MAS as outlined in the RMP. 
An alert card indicating in lay language the potential risk for MAS will be provided to all patients with 
SJIA receiving canakinumab. The alert card will also request patients to contact their doctors in case of 
SJIA  aggravation  or  development  of  an  infection.  In  the  planned  Pharmachild  registry  the  applicant 
committed to capture AEs of special interest in subjects with SJIA, such as MAS as outlined in the RMP.  
Furthermore  the  MAH  opened  enrolment  of  the  extension  study  G2301E1  to  new  canakinumab-naïve 
patients and extended the study end date to June 2014 to allow for additional collection of long-term 
efficacy and safety data as outlined in the RMP.

Assessment report

As  described  in  the  discussion  on  safety  there  is  an  unconfirmed  signal  for  increased  incidence  of 
pulmonary complications in SJIA patients treated with IL-1 inhibitors. The available patient population 
is  too  small  to  draw  any  firm  conclusions  toward  a  direct  link  between  canakinumab  and  pulmonary 
complications. These events will be closely monitored as potential risk as outlined in the RMP.  
DILI events (elevations of serum transaminases) were observed in several canakinumab clinical trials 
in  SJIA  patients.  The  magnitude  of  the  difference,  compared  with  the  comparator  group  (placebo  or 
active  substance),  on  the  liver  parameters  of  interest  was  not  large  enough  to  suggest  a  causal 
relationship and no cases met the definition of Hy’s Law. Drug induced liver disease was included as an 
identified  risk  in  the  RMP  and  additional  information  will  be  provided  within  the  Pharmachild  SJIA 
registry. 
Within  the  planned  registry  the  applicant  will  provide  3  years  of  analysis  on  patients  for  all  of  the 
identified and potential risks. 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Treatment with canakinumab is efficacious regarding ACR response and statistically superior to placebo 
in  a  paediatric  population  with  systemic  juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis.  Canakinumab  administration  in 
this population allows in a statistically significant and clinically important proportion of treated patient 
a  reduction  of  glucocorticoid  treatment.  The  risk  to  suffer  a  disease  flare  is  statistically  significant 
reduced with canakinumab compared to placebo treatment. 
These  results  are  seen  as  clinically  very  important  in  a  severe  childhood  disease  with  restricted 
treatment options. Especially the possibility for reducing the steroid dose is important in view of long 
term severe side effects.  
A  higher  number  of  SAEs  and  clinically  notable  abnormalities  in  laboratory  parameters,  including 
haematology and transaminase values were observed in the treatment of SJIA compared to CAPS. An 
increased rate of infections was not observed among the patients with low neutrophil counts and DILI 
events did not meet the definition of Hy’s Law. 
Summarising,  in  the  pooled  data  of  all  SJIA  studies  the  rate  of  discontinuation  due  to  unsatisfactory 
therapeutic  event  was  31.3%.  Taken  together  with  the  musculoskeletal  disorders  being  a  common 
adverse drug reaction in SJIA patient treated with canakinumab and additional medication needed for 
these  disorders  the  benefit  is  somewhat  narrowed.  Furthermore  as  the  efficacy  of  canakinumab  is 
reliant on the compliance of the patient the importance of gastrointestinal disorders becomes apparent.

Two pivotal studies demonstrate that treatment with canakinumab is statistically superior to placebo in 
the defined response variables (e. g. 79.8% ACR30, 70.2% ACR50, 57.3% ACR70, 36.5% ACR90, and 
21.3% ACR100; pooled data at Day 15). In study G2305, 32.6% of patients achieved inactive disease 
at  Day  15.  All  ACR  components  (including  systemic  and  joint  symptoms)  moved  towards  normal.  In 
study G2301 Part I, steroids were eliminated in 32.8% patients and successfully tapered in 44.5%. The 
risk  of  experiencing  a  flare  event  was  64%  lower  for  canakinumab  compared  with  placebo  after  the 
withdrawal of canakinumab treatment (Part II). 
Data from the extension study also demonstrate that responses are maintained and often improve with 
continued therapy, providing a high degree of benefit to the majority of patients.

On  the  whole  a  similar  safety  profile  in  SJIA  was  seen  when  compared  to  CAPS  albeit  with  higher 
frequencies  of  the  adverse  events  mainly  in  gastrointestinal  disorders,  infections  and  respiratory 
disorders, Creatinine renal clearance decreased and Proteinuria. The risk of these unfavorable effects is 
appropriately mitigated with the proposed SmPC and RMP. 
Furthermore, the applicant committed to provide 3 years of analysis on patients for all of identified and 
potential  risks  within  the  canakinumab  RMP,  in  addition  to  missing  information  on  pregnancy,  long-
term  safety  and  efficacy,  and  the  long-term  effect  of  canakinumab  on  renal  function  through  the 
planned registry. 
The  main  new  potential  safety  concern  is  that  of  MAS,  which  can  be  triggered  by  a  SJIA  flare  or  an 
infection. From the current evaluation it is not possible to reject or confirm any increased risk of MAS 
events  following  Ilaris  treatment.  Precautionary  measures  as  described  above  are  considered  to 
adequately mitigate the risk of MAS and in the planned registry the applicant committed to capture AEs 
of special interest in subjects with SJIA, such as MAS as outlined in the RMP. 
Considering the severity of SJIA, the efficacy of canakinumab outweighs the  known and the potential 
risks of the treatment.  
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
SJIA  is  a  serious,  rare  condition  responsible  for  high  childhood  mortality  and  severe  morbidity, 
including  arthritis,  joint  deformities  and  systemic  manifestations  e.g.  anaemia,  hepatosplenomegaly, 
lymphadenopathy, serositis, hepatitis, tenosynovitis, stunted growth, which in turn can lead to severe 
disability. One of the immunological features of SJIA is the increased IL-1 levels. 
Many patients are not controlled by current standard treatment with NSAIDs and/or methotrexate and 
must  resort  to  corticosteroids.  Chronic  use  of  high  corticosteroid  doses  leads  to  additional  morbidity, 
such as growth retardation, osteoporosis, cataracts, cushingoid appearance, increased susceptibility to 
infections,  hypertension  and  glucose  intolerance.  MTX  is  a  highly  toxic  immunosuppressant  and  can 
lead to myelosuppression, severe GI disorders, hepato- and neuro- and nephrotoxicity and interstitial 
pneumonitis. The only other recently approved therapy in SJIA is tocilizumab (an anti-IL-6 monoclonal 
antibody). So far no comparator studies of tozilicumab versus canakinumab were undertaken.  
Canakinumab  is  a  fully  human  monoclonal  anti-IL-1  beta  antibody  binds  with high  affinity  specifically 
to human IL-1 beta and neutralises the biological activity of human IL-1 beta by blocking its interaction 
with  IL-1  receptors,  thereby  preventing  IL-1  beta-induced  gene  activation  and  the  production  of 
inflammatory mediators. 
In  the  current  application,  canakinumab  has  shown  clinically  highly  relevant,  rapid  and  sustained 
efficacy  in  the  treatment  of  SJIA.  Especially  the  possibility  to  reduce  the  corticosteroid  dose  or  to 
become  steroid-free  is  of  utmost  importance  for  the  wellbeing  and  development  of  these  juvenile 
patients. Administration by subcutaneous injection (e.g. by the parent/ self-injection) will be a practical 
advantage, in comparison to i.v. infusion (as in tocilizumab treatment) or to daily s.c. injections (as in 
off-label anakinra treatment). Long term extension data support prolonged efficacy.  
Based  on  AE  reporting  rates,  the  overall  safety  of  canakinumab  in  the  SJIA  pediatric  population  was 
comparable  to  that  in  the  CAPS  population.  Exposure  adjusted  incidence  rates  of  AEs  generally 
decreased  over  time,  including  the  rate  of  infections.  There  were  no  patients  with  true  opportunistic 
infections in the SJIA clinical program. The safety profile of the SJIA long-term population was similar 
to that of the overall SJIA pediatric population, but more data will become available post authorization 
through the planned registry the extension of the open label study G2301E1 and the planned phase IV 
dose reduction study.

The MAH is proposing the following wording of the indication: “Ilaris can be given as monotherapy or in 
combination  with  methotrexate”.  In  clinical  practice,  concomitant  methotrexate  may  be  beneficial 
particularly for patients with severe arthritic symptoms of SJIA. For patients presenting predominantly 
with systemic symptoms such as fever, monotherapy with canakinumab may be preferable. Initiating a 
biological  treatment  in  juvenile  patients  only  after  the  more  traditional  methotrexate  treatment  has 
failed  is  not  considered  feasible  in  the  context  of  SJIA.  Some  SJIA  patients  present  mainly  with 
systemic  symptoms  including  fever  and  methotrexate  would  not  be  an  optimal  treatment  for  these 
subjects. Hence, the indication as suggested by the MAH is acceptable. 
The  CHMP  considers  that  Canakinumab  has  clearly  demonstrated  its  clinically  and  statistically 
significant  efficacy  to  support  the  claimed  indication  and  that  the  known  risks  can  be  appropriately 
mitigated. The benefits of the treatment outweigh the risks. 
The overall benefit risk profile is considered favorable. 
4.  Recommendations 
Final Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends, by the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation(s) accepted 
Type 
C.1.6 a) 
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
II 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one 
Extension  of  Indication  to  include  new  indication/population  for  Ilaris  for  the  treatment  of  active 
Systemic  Juvenile  Idiopathic  Arthritis  (SJIA)  in  patients  aged  2 years  and  older  who  have  responded 
inadequately  to  previous  therapy  with  non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs)  and  systemic 
corticosteroids. Ilaris can be given as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate. 
As a consequence sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.7, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated. Annex 
II and sections 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the Package Leaflet were updated accordingly. 
Furthermore, the PI is being brought in line with the latest QRD template version 9.0. 
In  addition,  the  MAH  took  the  opportunity  to  include  the  contact  details  of  the  Croatian  local 
representative  and  to  update  the  contact  details  of  the  Maltese  local  representative  in  the  Package 
Leaflet. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the SmPC, Annex II and Package Leaflet. 
Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
•  Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The  marketing  authorisation  holder  shall  submit  periodic  safety  update  reports  for  this  product  in

Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
•  Risk management plan (RMP) 
The  MAH  shall  perform  the  required  Pharmacovigilance  activities  and  interventions  detailed  in  the 
agreed  RMP  presented  in  Module  1.8.2  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation  and  any  agreed  subsequent 
updates of the RMP.  
An updated RMP should be submitted:  
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency;  
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result 
of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
If the dates for submission of a PSUR and the update of a RMP coincide, they can be submitted at the 
same time. 
Additional risk minimisation measures   
The  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  shall  ensure  that,  prior  to  launch,  all  physicians  who  are 
expected  to  prescribe/use  Ilaris  are  provided  with  a  physician  information  pack  containing  the 
following: 
• 
• 
• 
The Summary of Product Characteristics 
Physician information 
Patient Alert Card 
The physician information should contain the following key messages: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The  risk  of  serious  infections,  including  opportunistic  bacterial,  viral  and  fungal  infections  in 
patients treated with Ilaris; 
The risk of acute injection-related reactions; 
For  CAPS  patients:  the  need  to  instruct  patients  on  proper  techniques  for  self-administration 
when the patient is willing and capable to do so, and guidance for Health Care Professionals on 
how to report administration errors; 
The  identified  or  potential  risk  of  immunogenicity  that  might  lead  to  immune-mediated 
symptoms.  For  gouty  arthritis  patients:  highlighting  that  intermittent  therapy  or  re-exposure 
after a long treatment-free interval may be associated with an enhanced immune response (or 
loss of immune tolerance) to Ilaris and thus re-treated patients must be considered at risk of 
hypersensitivity reactions; 
For  chronic  therapy  in  CAPS:  the  need  for  Health  Care  Professionals  to  perform  an  annual 
clinical  assessment  of  patients  regarding  a  potential  increased  risk  for  the  development  of 
malignancies; 
•  As  treatment  with  Ilaris  should  not  be  initiated  in  patients  with  neutropenia,  the  need  to 
measure  neutrophil  counts  prior  to  initiating  treatment  and  again  after  1  to  2 months.  For 
chronic  therapy  in  CAPS  patients  or  repeated  therapy  in  gouty  arthritis  patients,  it  is 
recommended to assess neutrophil counts periodically during treatment;

• 
For  SJIA  patients,  the  need  for  Health  Care  Professionals  to  be  attentive  to  symptoms  of 
infection  or  worsening  of  SJIA,  as  these  are  known  triggers  for  macrophage  activation 
syndrome (MAS) which is a known, life-threatening disorder that may develop in patients with 
rheumatic conditions, in particular SJIA patients. If MAS occurs, or is suspected, evaluation and 
treatment should be started as early as possible; 
The need to monitor patients for changes in their lipid profiles; 
The unknown safety of Ilaris in pregnant and lactating women, thus the need for physicians to 
discuss this risk with patients if they become or plan to become pregnant; 
The proper patient management as regards the interaction with vaccination; 
The possibility to include patients in the registry study to facilitate the collection of long term 
efficacy and safety data; 
The role and use of patient alert card. 
Specific  Obligation  to  complete  post-authorisation  measures  for  the 
marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances 
This  being  an  approval  under  exceptional  circumstances  and  pursuant  to  Article  14(8)  of  Regulation 
(EC) No 726/2004, the MAH shall conduct, within the stated timeframe, the following measures: 
Description 
The  MAH 
is  requested 
to  provide  reports  on 
the  ß-Confident  registry 
(CACZ885D2401),  which  was  designed  to  provide  data  on  long-term  safety  and 
effectiveness  of  Ilaris  treatment  in  paediatric  and  adult  CAPS  patients  in  routine 
Due date 
Annually 
within 
annual 
the 
re-
clinical  practice.  In  these  reports  the  MAH  is  requested  to  specifically  assess  cases 
assessment 
for whom there is a loss of efficacy (patients reported to have discontinued Ilaris for 
lack-of-therapeutic response) to determine whether this is due to changes over time 
in  PK/PD  or  antibody  development  (where  data  is  available)  or  in  whom  a  dose 
adjustment  has  led  to  improved  therapeutic  response  (patients  with  a  dose  up 
titration without discontinuation for lack-of-therapeutic response). 
The  MAH  is  required  to  provide  updates  on  the  recruitment  rates  and  any 
intermediary results annually within the annual re-assessment. 
The  patients  should  be  included  in  the  Registry  until  both  following  conditions  are 
met: 5 years recruitment period and 200 patients included. 
Paediatric data 
The  CHMP  reviewed  the  available  paediatric  data  of  studies  subject  to  the  agreed  Paediatric 
Investigation  Plan  P/0108/2012  and  the  results  of  these  studies  are  reflected  in  the  Summary  of 
Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

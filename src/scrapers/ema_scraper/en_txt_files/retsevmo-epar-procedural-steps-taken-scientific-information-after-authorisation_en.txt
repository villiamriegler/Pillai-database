solid or primary central nervous system tumours. As 
a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of 
the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is 
updated in accordance. Version 5.3 of the RMP has 
been agreed.

The results of study J2G-MC-JZJV have shown a significant 
to reflect the final results from the drug-drug 
interaction (DDI) study J2G-MC-JZJV; this is a phase 
1, single-center, open-label, DDI study to investigate 
the effect of selpercatinib on the pharmacokinetic 
profiles of dabigatran, a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) 
substrate, in healthy volunteers. The Package Leaflet 
is updated accordingly. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
increase in Cmax (43%) and AUC0-∞ (38%) of dabigatran 
(single dose at D1 and D8) after a single dose of 
selpercatinib (single dose at D8) in healthy volunteers. 
Selpercatinib is therefore a mild inhibitor of P-gp and 
caution should be used when taking a sensitive P-gp 
substrate (e.g., fexofenadine, dabigatran etexilate, 
colchicine, saxagliptin), and particularly those with a 
narrow therapeutic index (e.g., digoxin).

(LOXO-RET-17001) on the clinical safety and efficacy 
of selpercatinib in patients with RET-mutant MTC 
who are cabozantinib and vandetanib treatment-
naïve (MTC:-Cab/-Van). LIBRETTO-001 is a global, 
multicohort, open-label, Phase 1/2 study in adult and 
adolescent patients with advanced RET-altered 
tumours.  As a consequence, sections 4.1 and 5.1 of 
the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is 
updated in accordance.  Version 3.0 of the RMP has 
also been submitted.   
As part of the application the MAH is requesting a 1-

The application also includes an updated Phase II 
Environmental Risk Assessment in order to reflect 
the patient population as per the approved 
indication.

1. 
Introduction 
Keppra (levetiracetam – LEV) is currently authorised in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or 
without secondary generalisation in patients with epilepsy. It is also authorised as adjunctive therapy 
in  the  treatment  of  partial  onset  seizures  with  or  without  secondary  generalisation  in  adults  and 
children  from  4  years  of age with epilepsy and in the treatment of myoclonic seizures in adults and 
adolescents from 12 years of age with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). 
The MAH has applied for an extension of the indication for Keppra to include adjunctive therapy in 
the  treatment  of  primary  generalised  tonic-clonic  (PGTC)  seizures  in  adults  and  children  4  years  of 
age and older with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE). The IGEs are those syndromes or diseases 
that are a primary epilepsy condition and are thought or known to have a genetic cause. The IGEs are 
estimated to constitute approximately one quarter of the incidence of epilepsy. IGE usually arises in 
childhood or adolescence, but a large number of patients continue to have seizures in adult life. There 
are a number of different epilepsy syndromes within the group of IGEs. The main types are childhood 
absence epilepsy (CAE), juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE), JME, and epilepsy with grand mal seizures 
on  awakening.  In  these  syndromes,  primary  generalized  tonic-clonic  (PGTC)  seizures  can  occur  as 
isolated events or in association with other generalized seizure types (e.g. myoclonic seizures, absence 
seizures). PGTC seizures have a usual onset during childhood or adolescence, but may appear later. 
They  occur  without  warning  or  aura.  The  electroencephalogram  pattern  for  PGTC  seizures  is 
generalised spike-and-wave or polyspike wave. 
In addition to section 4.1 of the SPC, the MAH proposed to update section 4.8 to reflect the safety data 
generated  by  the  pivotal  study  and  to  introduce  minor  grammatical  changes  to  section  4.2.  The 
Package Leaflet (PL) was revised accordingly. 
2.  Clinical aspects 
GCP 
The  clinical  trials  were  performed  in  accordance  with  GCP,  as  stated  by  the  MAH.  In  addition,  the 
MAH confirmed that the ethical requirements of the clinical trial directive 2001/20/EC were applied 
for clinical trials conducted outside the EU. 
Clinical efficacy  
The clinical programme was based on a pivotal double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study in 
patients with IGE with PGTC (N01057). A long-term follow-up study (N167), open to enrolment to 
patients  who  completed  N01057  as  well  as  patients  from  other  studies  with  primary  generalized 
seizures, was included to provide supportive long-term efficacy and safety in the proposed indication. 
Further supportive data from Study N166, the primary basis for the authorised indication in patients 
with myoclonic seizures, were provided (Table I).

TREATMENT PERIOD 
METHODS 
Objectives 
The main objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LEV as adjunctive treatment 
(3000  mg/day,  given  b.i.d.  or  a  target  dose  of  60  mg/kg/day  in  children,  given  b.i.d.)  in  adults  and 
children (4 to 65 years) with IGE with PGTC seizures. 
Study Participants  
Among the inclusion criteria were: 
Male/female aged 4-65 years. 
• 
One or two concomitant anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). 
• 
Diagnosis of IGE with uncontrolled PGTC seizures and at least 3 documented PGTC seizures 
• 
during the 8-week combined baseline period (at least 1 PGTC seizure in the 4-week historical 
baseline period and at least 1 PGTC seizure during the 4-week prospective baseline period).

Treatments 
The study consisted of several periods: 
• 
Combined baseline period: 4-week historical baseline followed by 4 weeks single-blind placebo 
(PBO) prospective baseline. 
Up-titration  period  (4  weeks):  LEV  3000  mg/day  (provided  as  500-mg  tablets)  or  matching 
PBO. 
Evaluation period (20 weeks): during the first week patients were allowed one dose reduction to 
2000 mg/day (and were not allowed to subsequently increase the dose). 
Down-titration or conversion to open label LEV (long-term follow-up study N167). 
• 
• 
• 
The  mean  daily  dose  of  levetiracetam  during  the  evaluation  period  (exclusive  of  up-  and  down-
titrations) was 2887.2 mg/day which is close to the target dose of 3000 mg/day. 
Randomisation and sample size 
Treatments  were  allocated  to  subjects  by  means  of  a  centralised  randomisation  process.  The 
randomisation  was  stratified  by  region  and  weight  category  [adults,  children  and  adolescents  <  16 
years (> 40 kg, 31-40 kg and 20-30 kg)].  
The ITT population consisted of 164 individuals (73 male and 91 female) ranging in age from 5 years 
to 62 years.  Seventy of 84 patients randomised to PBO (82.56 %) and 69 of 79 patients randomised to 
LEV  (86.3  %)  completed  the  double-blind  evaluation  period.  The  most  common  reason  for 
discontinuation in the active group was loss to follow-up (5 patients; 6.5 %) and withdrawal of consent 
(4  patients;  5.2  %).  In  the  PBO  group,  adverse  events  (4  patients,  4.9  %)  and  lack  of  efficacy  (3 
patients; 3.8 %) were the most common reasons. 
Endpoints 
Primary efficacy variable 
The primary efficacy variable was the percentage reduction from the combined baseline period in the 
PGTC seizure frequency over the treatment period. 
The  percentage  reduction  in  the  PGTC  seizure  frequency  per  week  was  also  assessed  over  the 
evaluation period. 
Secondary efficacy variables 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Absolute  reduction  in  PGTC  seizure  frequency  per  week  from  the  combined  baseline  period 
during the treatment period. 
Percent  reduction  in  seizure  days  per  week  (all  seizures)  from the prospective baseline period 
during the treatment period. 
Responder  rates  in  PGTC  seizure  frequency,  and  in  seizure  days  (all  seizures)  per  week.  A 
responder was defined as a subject with a ≥ 50% reduction in the applicable measure from the 
 baseline  period  to  the  treatment  period.  The  baseline  seizure  frequency  is  calculated  over  the 
 combined  baseline  period,  and  the  baseline  seizure  days  per  week  calculated  over  the 
 prospective baseline period. 
Categorized  response  to  treatment  in  PGTC  seizures:  Subjects  were  grouped  into  4  categories 
(less  than  –25%,  -25%  to  <25%,  25%  to  <75%  and  75%  to  100%)  according  to  the  percent 
reduction from the combined baseline period in PGTC seizures frequency during the treatment 
period. A similar grouping constructed on seizure days for all seizures used only the prospective 
baseline period. 
Percent of seizure-free subjects, with respect to all seizures, and with respect to PGTC seizures 
during the evaluation period and the entire treatment period.

Because the distributions of percent reductions in seizure frequency / seizure days from baseline were 
skewed with most values centering around the lower values and the extreme values tailing off to the 
right, the median difference in absolute and percent reduction between LEV and PBO was estimated 
with  the  Hodges-Lehmann  method  and  statistically  tested  with  the  Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney  test  in 
addition  to  the  originally  planned  ANCOVA  with  rank  transformation.  Responder  rates  in  PGTC 
seizure  frequency  per  week  were  compared  between  treatment  groups  using  a  logistic  regression 
analysis with treatment group as factor and the baseline PGTC seizure frequency as the covariate. The 
treatment  difference  in  categorized  responses  has  been  tested  with  a  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  test 
based on ranks. Differences in seizure freedom were inferentially tested using Fisher’s exact test.

Concomitant AED medication 
The  most  commonly  used  AEDs  during  the  treatment  period  were  valproic  acid  (53,2  %)  and 
lamotrigine (27 % of the patients). At baseline, 50 % of the patients took one concomitant AED and 
44 % two AEDs. Of 11 patients who took more than two AEDs during the treatment period, use of 
lorazepam “as needed” accounted for all but three. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy variable:  
During  treatment,  patients  randomized  to  PBO  had  a  mean  28.30%  (median  44.57%)  reduction  in 
PGTC  seizure  frequency  per  week  from  a  mean  of  1.20  (median  0.62)  PGTC  seizure  frequency per 
week  at  combined  baseline.  In  the  LEV  group  the  mean  percent  reduction  was  56.37%  (median 
77.58%) from a mean of 1.27 (median 0.62) PGTC seizure frequency per week at combined baseline. 
The  difference  between  the  treatment  least-square  means  in  percent  reduction  from  baseline  was 
statistically significant (p = 0.004).  
A  similar  result  was  obtained  when  the  primary  efficacy  hypothesis  of  no  difference  in  mean 
percentage reduction in PGTC seizure frequency per week was tested using an ANCOVA model with 
treatment groups as factor and combined baseline PGTC seizure frequency as covariate (TableV).

Responder rate 
A  subject  was  defined  as  a  responder  if  the  percent  reduction  in  PGTC  seizure  frequency  per 
week from combined baseline to treatment period was greater or equal to 50 %. The percentage 
of responders in the LEV group was 72.2 % vs. 45.2 % in the PBO group (p<0.001).  
Seizure freedom with respect to all seizures and PGTC seizures 
Seizure  freedom  was  assessed  over  the  evaluation  period  and  the  treatment  period  for  both 
PGTC seizures and all seizure types. The results are presented in table VII.

50 % responder rate over the treatment period in absence, myoclonic and PGTC exclusively subgroups 
An analysis of responder rates within the subgroups of patients with exclusively PGTC seizures, those 
who  experienced  absence  seizures  during  either  the  combined  baseline  or  the  treatment  period,  and 
those who experienced myoclonic seizures during the prospective baseline or the treatment period was 
performed. The results are presented in table IX.

Newly occurring seizure types 
• 
Some subjects did not experience any episodes of a particular seizure during prospective baseline but 
presented episodes during the treatment period. Seven patients in the PBO group and 10 in the LEV 
group had no myoclonic seizures during prospective baseline but presented myoclonic seizures during 
the treatment period. Likewise, 7 patients in the PBO group and 13 in the LEV group had no absence 
seizures during prospective baseline but presented absence seizures during the treatment period. 
In a further analysis, the set of ITT patients never having experienced myoclonic seizures at any time 
(in  the  subjects’  life  history  including  combined  baseline)  before  randomization  was  identified.  The 
numbers and percentages of these subjects experiencing myoclonic seizures for the first time during 
the treatment period were calculated. An analogous analysis was performed for absence seizures. The 
results are presented in table X.

SUPPORTIVE RESULTS FROM STUDY N166 AND OPEN-LABEL FOLLOW-UP STUDY N167 
Study N166 
Study  N166  was  intended  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  LEV  as  adjunctive  treatment  of 
myoclonic seizures at a dose of 3000 mg/day (given twice daily, b.i.d.) in adolescents ((cid:31)12 years) and 
adults  ((cid:31)65  years)  with  IGE.  It  was  a  16-week  (inclusive  of  4-week  up-titration),  multicenter, 
randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  add-on  study  performed  in  subjects  with  IGE 
experiencing myoclonic seizures (Type IIB) as their primary seizure type.  
A subgroup analysis in N166 was conducted on the PGTC subgroup, defined as all subjects having at 
least  1  tonic-clonic  seizure  during  the  baseline  and/or  treatment  period.  A  total  of  42  subjects  (20 
subjects in the PBO group and 22 subjects in the LEV group) presented tonic-clonic seizures during 
baseline or treatment. The median percent reduction on tonic-clonic seizure frequency was 48% in the 
PBO group and 84% in the LEV group. These differences were not statistically significant (p=0.1228). 
Study N167 
Study N167 is an ongoing, open-label, long-term follow-up study. The main objective is to evaluate 
the  safety  and  efficacy  of  LEV  up  to  a  maximum  dose  of  4000  mg/day  (or  80  mg/kg/day  bid  for 
children and adolescents less than 50 kg). A total of 135 patients with IGE entered N167 from N1057 
or N166. These patients who were included from N166 were restricted to those who received LEV and 
had PGTC seizures either at baseline, during the prior study of participation or in N167.  
Mean  LEV  dose  was  2948  mg/day  (range  750-4000  mg/day).  Most  patients  remained  on  the  target 
dose  from  study  N01057,  3000  mg/day,  even  though  dose  modification  was  allowed.  The  primary 
endpoint is the number and percentage of subjects having at least 6 months of seizure freedom.  
All but 4 subjects in the ITT (PGTC) population remained on LEV for at least 6 months. For PGTC 
seizures, there were 64 subjects (47.4%) seizure free for 6 months at any time and 36 subjects (26.7%) 
seizure free for 6 months beginning from Visit 1.

The  median  percent  reduction  from  baseline  in  PGTC  seizure  frequency  per  week  during  the  N167 
evaluation period was 82.0%. Overall, 97 subjects (71.9%) were categorized as responders as they had 
a 50% or greater reduction in PGTC seizure frequency during the evaluation period. When responder 
rates were evaluated over analysis interval and duration of exposure cohorts, the responder rates were 
maintained over time during N167. Eleven of 135 subjects (8.1%) had a period of LEV monotherapy 
of at least 91 days, and the majority remained seizure-free for 90% of their monotherapy periods. 
Eight subjects had worsening of seizures (≥ 25 % increase in PGTC seizure frequency per week, or 
days per week with myoclonic or absence seizures). Four of these concerned worsening of myoclonic 
seizures, two worsening of absence seizures and three worsening of PGTC seizures (in one patients, 
there was worsening of both PGTC and myoclonic seizures). 
CONCLUSIONS ON CLINICAL EFFICACY  
The clinical efficacy programme was based on a pivotal double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized 
study in patients with IGE with PGTC seizures. 
The mean percent reduction in PGTC seizure frequency from the baseline to the treatment 
period (primary endpoint) was statistically significant in the LEV group (56.5 % in the LEV 
group vs. 28.2 % for PBO group). The responder rate was also significantly higher in the LEV 
group (72.2 % vs. 45.2 %). In addition, PGTC seizure freedom was achieved in 24.1 % in the 
LEV group compared to 7.1 % in the PBO group for the group of completers over the 
treatment period. The CHMP epilepsy guideline states that the analysis of efficacy should be 
based on the period when patients are stabilised on a fixed dose of the study drug (i.e. the 
evaluation period in this case) and not the treatment period (which includes up-titration + 
evaluation phases). However, the analyses performed showed similar results for both periods. 
Therefore, the efficacy of LEV as adjunctive therapy for PGTC seizures is considered to be 
sufficiently demonstrated.  
The  CHMP  noted,  however,  that  the  number  of  children  in  the  main  study  was  very  limited  as  the 
majority of patients were older than 16 years whilst only one child was below 6 years of age, and 8 
children were in the interval 6-12 years. Therefore, the MAH was requested to further justify how the 
data collected support the treatment of patients aged less than 16 years old in the claimed indication. 
Considering the further data submitted, the CHMP concluded that, due to the very limited number of 
children in Study N01057, a reliable evaluation of safety and efficacy in subjects with PGTC seizures 
in  this  age  group  is  not  possible.  The  age  limit  of  4  years  proposed  by  the  MAH  is  therefore  not 
acceptable  to  the  CHMP.    The  Committee  considered  a  lower  age  limit  of  12  years,  which  would 
restrict  the  new  indication  to  adults  and  adolescents,  consistently  with  the  same  age  groups  as 
currently  approved  for  Keppra  in  the  treatment  of  myoclonic  seizures.  In  summary,  the  CHMP 
considered  the  lower  age  limit  for  the  applied  new  indication  to  be  increased  to  12  years,  and 
recommended  the  corresponding  amendment  to  the  SPC  and  PL.  The  MAH  agreed  with  the 
conclusions of the CHMP and provided updated Product Information accordingly. 
In addition to the above point, the CHMP also noted that an analysis of efficacy within seizure type 
subgroups indicated no effect of LEV on absence seizures, and newly occurring absence seizure were 
more frequent in the LEV group (14.9 % vs. 5.7 %). Likewise, 7 patients in the PBO group and 13 in 
the  LEV  group  had  no  absence  seizures  during  prospective  baseline  but  presented  absence  seizures 
during the treatment period. The MAH was therefore asked to further discuss this.  
In their answer, the MAH performed an analysis of the efficacy within seizure type subgroups for the 
pivotal  study  N01057.  Considering  the  further  analysis  performed  by  the  MAH,  the  CHMP  still 
concluded  that,  in  the  pivotal  study  N01057,  the  results  showed  that  levetiracetam  increased  the 
proportion  of  responders  in  all  seizure  subtypes  except  for  absence  seizures,  indicating  that 
levetiracetam had no effect on the frequency of absence seizures. Therefore, a statement to be added to 
section  4.4  of  the  SPC  to  this  end  was  provided  by  the  CHMP.  Changes  to  the  proposed  text  for

section  5.1  were  also  recommended  by  the  CHMP.  The  MAH  agreed  with  the  conclusions  of  the 
CHMP and provided updated Product Information accordingly. 
Finally,  the  CHMP  considered  the  analysis  of  responders  showed  a  higher  PBO  response  in  study 
N01057  (45.2%)  than  has  been  reported  for  add-on  studies  in  partial  epilepsy.  Factors  such  as 
regression to the mean, and the effects of participating in a clinical trial are likely to contribute to a 
high PBO response. The MAH was, however, asked to address this issue and discuss in more detail the 
reasons for the high PBO response. 
In their answer, the applicant discussed several factors which are likely to have contributed to the high 
placebo response in study N01057. The CHMP considered the answer from the MAH satisfactory, and 
the issue resolved. 
Clinical safety 
PATIENT EXPOSURE 
The safety populations included are based on subjects with PGTC seizures. This includes all subjects 
in N01057 and subsets of subjects in N166 and N167. 
• 
• 
For N01057, the population considered for the safety analysis is the ITT population. 
For N166, the population included corresponds to the subjects who had a PGTC seizure during 
N166 baseline and/or at any subsequent post-randomization time, either in N166 and/or N167 
study participation. 
For N167, the population included is defined as “all subjects” from studies N01057 and N166 
who  took  at  least  one  dose  of  LEV  in  N167  prior  to  the  clinical  cut-off  date,  and  who  had  a 
PGTC (IIE) seizure at N166 or N01057 Baseline. 
• 
This represents a total of 214 subjects, including 164 from N01057 and 50 from N166. Of these, 192 
were exposed to LEV and provide on-treatment safety data.  
ADVERSE EVENTS  
In  study  N01057,  57  patients  randomized  to  PBO  (67.9%)  and  57  patients  randomized  to  LEV 
(72.2%)  experienced  one  or  more  treatment  emergent  adverse  events  (AEs),  considered  related  to 
treatment in about one-half of the cases (25 patients randomized to placebo (29.8%) and 31 patients 
randomized to LEV (39.2%). Most of the events were mild or moderate in intensity. 
The  most  frequently  reported  treatment-emergent  AEs    (incidence  of  approximately  10%),  were 
headache,  nasopharyngitis,  and  fatigue.  Nasopharyngitis  was  more  common  amongst  patients 
randomized to LEV (13.9% as compared to 4.8%) but was judged treatment related in only one of the 
patients randomized to LEV. Irritability and mood swings were the only other AEs in N01057 more 
common  amongst  patients  randomized  to  LEV  than  to  PBO  (difference  ≥  3%).  Both  tended  to  be 
judged  treatment-related  in  patients  randomized  to  LEV.  The  only  treatment-related  AE  occurring 
more commonly in the PBO group than in the LEV one was nausea.  
Somewhat greater proportions in the N166 ITT (PGTC) subset had treatment-emergent AEs (75.0% of 
patients  randomized  to  PBO  and  92.3%  of  patients  randomized  to  LEV).  Similarly,  approximately 
one-half had one or more events that were treatment-related (10 patients randomized to PBO [41.7%] 
and  12  patients  randomized  to  LEV  [50.0%]).  The  majority  of  the  events  were  mild  or  moderate  in 
intensity.  Headache  and  fatigue  were  the  most  commonly  reported  AEs.  The  most  common  AEs  is 
given in Table XII.

SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAES) / DEATHS / OTHER SIGNIFICANT EVENTS  
One death was reported in N01057, coded as a sudden death in epilepsy (SUDEP). The female patient 
was found dead in her home, 197 days after having been randomized to LEV. On autopsy, the death 
was  attributed  to  “poorly  controlled  epilepsy  with  a  grand  mal  seizure.”  The  event  was  judged 
possibly treatment related by the investigator. 
Across all studies (inclusive of the treatment-emergent SAEs in the PBO controlled studies), 26 LEV-
exposed patients experienced at least one SAE. The most common pertained to seizure-related events 
(for the most part not treatment related) or were psychiatric in nature (treatment related). An overview 
of all SAEs is provided in Table XIII.

Seizure-related SAEs 
Eleven  of  the  SAEs  were  seizure-related,  occurring  in  10  patients.  Of  these,  one  was  considered 
possibly treatment related. One SAE occurred 2 days following the last dose; for the remaining, none 
resulted  in  discontinuation.  In  1  patient  with  status  epilepticus  and  significant  sequelae  (including 
coma,  multi-organ  failure,  and  deep  venous  thrombosis),  LEV  was  temporarily  discontinued.  Two 
additional patients had SAEs that were sequelae of seizures, not treatment related. 
Psychiatric SAEs 
Five patients had SAEs that were psychiatric in nature. All were judged treatment related. 
Two were mood disorders: depression followed by a suicide attempt in 1 patient and worsening of pre-
existing depression that resulted in discontinuation. Two were psychotic disorders: one associated with 
suicidal ideation and resulted in discontinuation and one described as worsening schizophrenia. One 
was a behaviour disorder, violent episode, coded as a behaviour disorder.  
Of  the  remaining  SAEs,  one  patient  suffered  a  myocardial  infarction  that  was  not  treatment-related. 
One  patient  developed  a  diffuse  erythematous  rash  that  required  hospitalization  and  treatment  with 
intravenous  corticosteroids  and  antihistamines,  with  temporary  treatment  interruption  of  LEV  and, 
eventually, permanent discontinuation of valproic acid; the event resolved after 24 days.  One woman 
was reported to be pregnant while down-titrating from LEV. An ultrasound indicated that fetal death 
occurred  about  3  weeks  after  the  last  dose  and  was  judged  possibly  related  to  treatment  by  the 
investigator. On follow-up, the final diagnosis of fetal tissues indicated a rare hydropic, degenerating 
“chronic” villi.

CONCLUSIONS ON CLINICAL SAFETY 
The spectrum of AEs is similar to that reported previously in studies on partial seizures. A relatively 
high incidence of CNS-related adverse events and psychiatric adverse events was observed. No new or 
unexpected safety issues were reported. Section 4.8 of the SPC was updated to reflect the frequency of 
undesirable effects in the studies. 
3. 
PHARMACOVIGILANCE  
The CHMP did not require the MAH to submit a risk management plan because the safety profile of 
Keppra  was  considered  unlikely  to  be  different  as  adjunctive  therapy  in  the  treatment  of  primary 
generalised tonic-clonic seizures as compared to the approved epilepsy indications.  
4. 
 CONCLUSION 
On 16 November 2006 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the 
amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet.

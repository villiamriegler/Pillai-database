2. Scientific discussion 
2.1 Introduction 
Problem statement 
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprising primarily of Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s 
disease (CD), is a relapsing remitting condition characterized by chronic inflammation at various 
sites in the gastrointestinal tract. UC and CD are chronic, lifelong diseases that cause 
considerable morbidity as well as increased mortality in a patient population with an average age 
in the early 40s.  
IBD affects 1.4 million of people in the United States and 2.2 million of people in Europe, and its 
peak onset is in persons 15 to 30 years of age. CD generally involves the ileum and the colon, 
but it can affect any region of the intestine, often discontinuously. Otherwise UC involves the 
rectum and may affect part of the colon or the entire colon in an uninterrupted pattern 
(pancolitis). Since IBD are chronic diseases, patients will go through periods in which the disease 
flares up and causes symptoms. These periods are followed by remission, in which symptoms 
disappear or decrease. Patients are often afflicted by abdominal cramps and pain, bloody 
diarrhoea, severe urgency to have a bowel movement, lack of appetite, weight loss and anaemia 
due to the intestinal bleeding. Moreover, patients with IBD could develop some extra-intestinal 
manifestation such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis. Clinical 
complications in CD may include the development of fistulae and perianal diseases or the 
formation of strictures and obstructions, whereas the most important complication of UC is an 
acute non-obstructive dilatation of the colon called “toxic mega-colon”. Moreover, both CD and 
UC patients have increased risk of developing colon cancer. 
The intestinal immune system has a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of IBD. Both innate and 
adaptive immune systems are implicated in the development of the aberrant immune response 
that leads to the intestinal tissue damage. In healthy subjects the immune response to the vast 
number of dietary and microbial antigens present in the lumen, is typically non-inflammatory, 
favouring a state of immune hypo-responsiveness. This adaptation is crucial for the maintenance 
of health. In mammals, intestinal homeostasis is controlled by the interplay between the 
Entyvio 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/676643/2013 
Page 9/166 
 
  
 
epithelial cells and immune cells and this adjusts the host response to the daily charge of 
antigens derived from the microbiota and food proteins. Otherwise when an infection mediated 
by pathogens occurs, the immune response becomes inflammatory.  
The recognition of luminal antigens is particularly mediated by dendritic cells (DCs), a specialized 
class of antigen presenting cells (APCs) that orchestrate innate and adaptive immune responses. 
DCs migrate from peripheral tissues to secondary lymphoid organs, where they present antigen 
to T cells, leading to the activation of T lymphocytes. These latter express T cell receptor (TCR) 
and can be divided into two major sub-groups, T helper (Th) expressing CD4, and T cytotoxic 
(Tc) expressing CD8. CD4+ Tcells become activated when they encounter DC that express 
antigen-complexed to MHC class II molecule on the plasma membrane. Once activated, they 
divide rapidly and secrete cytokines that regulate the active immune response. Activated CD4+ T 
cells can differentiate into one of several subtypes, including Th1, Th2, Th17, T regulatory (Treg) 
or T follicular helper (TFH), which secrete different cytokines to facilitate a different type of 
immune response. Similarly, CD8+ T cells are activated by cells expressing antigen in the 
context of MHC class I proteins and they have a major role in the destruction of tumour and 
viral-infected cells.  
In IBD CD4+ Tcells play a major role in the activation/regulation of the inflammatory response. 
For many years, it has been assumed that CD is mainly mediated by Th1 cells, while UC is a Th2-
like type of inflammation. This has been supported by increased levels of Th1 cytokines such as 
Interferon (IFN) γ and interleukin (IL-)12 in CD and increased expression of Th2 related 
cytokines such as IL-13 and IL-4 in UC. Th1 cells have a major role in the protection against 
intracellular microbes, while Th2 cells are involved in the allergic responses and in the protection 
against extracellular parasites. Development of both Th1 and Th2 cells subsets are controlled by 
certain transcription factors such as T box expressed in T cells (T-bet) and signal transducer and 
activator transcription factor (STAT) 4 in Th1 cells, and GATA-binding protein (GATA-) 3 and 
STAT6 for Th2 cells. Th1 differentiation is driven by IL-12 and IFN-γ secreted by DCs after the 
binding/identification of the specific antigen, while IL-4 (in the absence of IL-12) drives Th2 
differentiation. However, more recently, emerging evidences have contributed to show that the 
inflamed gut of patients with CD and with UC is also massively infiltrated with another subset of 
Th cells, namely Th17 and characterized by the production of high levels of cytokines such as IL-
17A, IL-17F and IL-22.   
Once activated, antigen-primed cells relocate to peripheral sites and exert effector activities upon 
renewed antigen challenge. To achieve this, lymphocytes must travel between lymphoid and 
non-lymphoid organs via the blood and then exit the circulation to enter antigen-containing 
tissues. An essential step in this migration process is the adhesion of circulating lymphocytes to 
the endothelium of post capillary venules, which is a multistep process. In the first step, which is 
mediated by selectins or integrins, lymphocytes are captured (“tethering”) and poorly interact 
with the endothelial cells (“rolling”). Once they are rolling, they can undergo “activation,” which 
is usually mediated by chemokines presented on the venular endothelium. Chemokines bind to 
specific G-protein-coupled receptors and trigger intracellular signals that lead to activation of 
integrins and the lymphocytes arrest (“sticking”) on the endothelial surface. Only when all steps 
are completed lymphocytes can transmigrate into a tissue.  
CD4 Tcells that migrate to the small intestine lamina propria express the integrin alpha4beta7 
and the chemokine receptor CCR9. These traffic molecules, as well as their corresponding 
Entyvio 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/676643/2013 
Page 10/166 
 
  
ligands, are essential for efficient T-cell migration into the small bowel. The main alpha4beta7 
ligand, MAdCAM-1, is expressed on intestinal lamina propria venules and the CCR9 ligand 
CCL25/TECK is strongly expressed by epithelial cells in the small intestine and in lamina propria 
venules. The integrin alpha4beta7 is also important for T-cell migration into the colon, even 
during inflammation. However, the large bowel is devoid of CCR9+ cells, and its ligand CCL25 is 
not expressed in this compartment. Consistently, CCR9 desensitization or CCL25 blockade 
decreased adhesion of T cells in small bowel, but not colon venules. Thus, other chemoattractant 
pathways may direct T cell migration to the colon mucosa. 
The calculated annual mortality rate in IBD is 1.0% to 1.4%. Pharmacological treatments exist 
for the treatment of UC, but there remains a significant unmet medical need for more effective 
and safer treatments for both induction and maintenance of remission. Failure of medical therapy 
leads to colectomy in approximately 1 year in 17% of UC patients with moderately to severely 
active disease while taking concomitant medical therapy including corticosteroids and/or 
immunosuppressants. Colectomy rates range from 9% (distal colitis) to 35% (pancolitis) over 5 
years, depending on the extent of colon involved For CD, although pharmacological treatments 
exist, there remains a significant unmet medical need for more effective and safer treatments for 
both induction and maintenance of remission. For many CD patients, at some stage of their 
disease, approaches such as surgical removal of highly diseased, strictured, or stenotic segments 
of the bowel is the only option. However, for CD, surgery often is not curative as CD can recur in 
any part of the gastrointestinal tract; after bowel resection with primary anastomosis, CD recurs 
at the site of the anastomosis in essentially all patients. Further contributing to morbidity of CD 
is its unique tendency to cause fistulization, often resulting in fecal discharge through the skin, 
the vagina, or the urinary tract. 
The standard approach to therapy for UC and CD is generally step-wise and directed, based on 
disease activity and the extent and location of disease. Initial treatment often begins with anti-
inflammatory agents, progressing to more potent agents for patients who fail to demonstrate a 
response. Conventional pharmacologic treatments for these diseases include the 5-
aminosalicylates (5-ASAs), corticosteroids, and immunomodulators (thiopurines such as 
azathioprine [AZA] and 6-mercaptopurine [6-MP]) for both UC and CD, along with methotrexate 
(MTX) for CD. In addition, standard practice often involves using these treatments in 
combination. Although these treatments are effective for some patients with UC or CD, many 
patients either do not respond adequately or become refractory to these conventional therapies, 
and some may become dependent on long-term corticosteroid therapy, increasing their risk of 
developing the serious toxicities associated with long-term corticosteroid use. In addition, long-
term use of AZA and related immunosuppressants increases the risk of lymphoma and serious 
systemic infections. Monoclonal antibodies directed against TNFα (e.g. infliximab and 
adalimumab) have been approved for treatment of UC and CD in the European Union (EU). 
These agents have substantially improved the care of patients with UC and CD by inducing and 
maintaining remission and decreasing the need for hospitalizations and surgeries, and other 
complications. Although TNFα antagonists represent an important addition to the pharmacologic 
armamentarium for both UC and CD, they are effective in only a subset of patients, with roughly 
two-thirds of patients in controlled trials not in remission at the end of the first year of therapy. 
In addition, controlled studies have demonstrated that, after failure of 1 TNFα antagonist, a 
patient’s response to a second TNFα antagonist is substantially lower. The TNFα antagonists are 
also associated with a number of serious safety concerns based on their suppression of systemic

immunity, including reactivation of tuberculosis (TB); various bacterial, viral, fungal, and 
opportunistic infections; and malignancies such as hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma. 
Because of the ineffectiveness and toxicities experienced with immunomodulating therapies for 
moderately to severely active UC and CD, there remains considerable need for safer and more 
effective therapies. Patients who fail both conventional and TNFα antagonist therapy typically 
have no other medical therapeutic options available to them and often progress to surgical 
remedies. Despite potent immunomodulating combination therapies (eg, AZA plus a TNFα 
antagonist), many patients continue to experience disease flares and complications of their 
disease that may require frequent hospitalizations, abdominal surgeries, and treatment of 
infections, including abscess drainage. These complications contribute to a substantial morbidity. 
Thus, there is a pressing need for alternative therapy effective in patients who do not respond, 
lose response, or are intolerant to currently available treatments for UC and CD. In addition, 
given the toxicities associated with chronic immunosuppression of the immune system associated 
with corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and TNFα antagonists, there is a need for new targeted 
therapies, particularly one that reduces the gastrointestinal inflammatory process without 
increasing the risk for toxicities commonly seen with the currently available agents. Vedolizumab 
is a gut-selective anti-inflammatory agent that was developed to help fulfill this important unmet 
medical need. 
About the product 
Vedolizumab is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody directed against 
the human lymphocyte integrin α4β7. The mechanism of action of vedolizumab is based upon its 
exclusive binding of the α4β7 integrin, a key mediator of gastrointestinal inflammation. The α4β7 
integrin is expressed on the surfaces of both T and B lymphocyte subpopulations, including at the 
surface of a discrete subset of memory T lymphocytes, designated α4β7hi, that preferentially 
migrate into the gastrointestinal tract and cause the inflammation that is characteristic of UC and 
CD. Vedolizumab binds to the α4β7 integrin and selectively inhibits adhesion of these cells to one 
of the α4β7ligands mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1), thereby preventing 
these cells entering the gut lamina propria and gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). 
Vedolizumab does not bind to, or inhibit function of, the α4β1 and αEβ7 integrins. The inhibition 
of α4β7 integrin is a shared mechanism of action of both vedolizumab and natalizumab and has 
thus raised a question of whether or not vedolizumab may also increase the risk of PML. The gut-
selective profile of vedolizumab is attributable to 2 distinct pharmacologic properties. 
Vedolizumab binds solely to the α4β7 but not the α4β1 integrin, unlike natalizumab, which binds 
to both. As a result, the binding of vedolizumab is specific for α4β7 expressing cells including the 
gut-tropic subset of lymphocytes. The ability of natalizumab to bind to the α4β1 integrin 
broadens its mechanism of action to modulate the systemic immune system as the α4β1 integrin 
is more widely expressed by leukocytes than is the α4β7 integrin, and the α4β1 integrin 
mediates pleiotropic activities that are not regulated by the α4β7 Integrin. Review of the 
scientific evidence published to date in peer-reviewed scientific journals supports the concept 
that PML associated with natalizumab results from antagonizing the α4β1 integrin and not the 
α4β7 integrin. The mechanism of action of vedolizumab represents a novel, selective intestinal-
targeted approach relevant to the pathophysiology of both UC and CD. By virtue of this gut-
selective mechanism of action, vedolizumab provides anti-inflammatory activity with the

potential for avoiding systemic immunosuppression and many of the side effects which are 
associated with existing UC and CD therapies. Hence, vedolizumab may offer a significant 
additional treatment option for the management of UC and CD patients who have failed 
conventional or TNFα antagonist therapy.

2.2 Quality aspects 
2.2.1 Introduction 
Vedolizumab is a recombinant humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody to the human α4β7 integrin. 
It is composed of two light chains of the kappa subclass and two heavy chains linked together by 
two disulfide bridges to form a Y-shaped molecule that is typical of IgG1 immunoglobulins as 
shown in the figure below. Each molecule contains twelve intra-chain and four inter-chain 
disulfide bonds and an asparagine-linked glycosylation site on each heavy chain at residue 301 
(see Figure 1). 
Figure 1: Structural Representation of Vedolizumab 
The mechanism of action of Vedolizumab is to selectively block the adhesion of α4β7 + T cells 
and B cells to their natural ligand MAdCAM-1.  
The isoelectric point is 7.6-8.3, the predicted mass for unmodified protein is 146,837 Da.

2.2.2 Active Substance 
Manufacture 
Manufacturing 
The manufacturing of Vedolizumab active substance is performed by AbbVie Bioresearch Center.  
The fermentation and harvesting process 
Vedolizumab active substance (AS) is manufactured using recombinant Chinese hamster ovary 
(CHO) cells that secrete the antibody into the culture medium.  
The inoculum expansion starts with the thawing of one Working Cell Bank (WCB) ampoule 
followed by culturing the cells at increasing volumes and, finally, into the production bioreactor. 
Vedolizumab antibody is harvested from the production bioreactor. 
The purification process  
An affinity column selectively captures the Vedolizumab antibody from the clarified harvest.  
After further purification and filtration steps to separate Vedolizumab antibody from process-
related impurities, the antibody is brought to the  target concentration.  
The active substance is, bottled, and stored at the designated temperature until shipment to the 
finished product manufacturing site.  
Process Control / Process Validation 
The manufacturing process is controlled using process parameters and process controls. 
The applicant has defined Normal Operating Ranges (NORs) and the control limits are 
acceptable. 
The use of animal derived materials in the manufacturing process is minimized. The BSE/TSE 
contamination risk from animal-derived materials used in the manufacturing process is 
considered very low. 
Manufacturing development 
The manufacturing process used to produce the AS has been changed twice, evolving from 
process A to process B, and then to process C, a further adjustment of process C was carried 
out, scaling it up.   
Comparability  
Comparability between the different processes was evaluated.  No indication of significant 
differences between processes B and C are evident. Process C clinical scale is considered 
comparable to Process C commercial scale.  
Control of materials 
All raw materials used in the production of the active substance are either of compendial quality 
or tested according to internal specifications.  
No raw materials of human or animal origin are used.

Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/676643/2013 
Page 16/166 
 
  
Cell Banks  
The Master Cell Bank and Working Cell Bank were prepared under cGMP conditions, and have 
been described. 
The Post-Production Cell Bank (PPCB) was prepared from cells obtained from a cGMP production 
culture. The cell banks were verified to be acceptable for use with regard to adventitious agents. 
Cell Line Generation and Cell banking 
A CHO cell line was utilized as the host cell line in the generation of the production cell line. After 
adaptation to growth in suspension, a serum-free, suspension bank of host CHO-cells was 
established. This host cell bank was then transfected, amplified, and the final production cell line 
was selected.  
After their adaptation to suspension growth, the bank of CHO cells underwent testing for virus 
and other adventitious agents, to ensure that they were suitable for use as host cells for creation 
of the production cell lines.  
The MCB, WCB, and PPCB were more extensively tested for viruses and other adventitious 
agents. The cell banks were verified to be acceptable for use with regard to adventitious agents. 
Specification 
Characterisation 
The characterisation of the active substance was satisfactory. The presented analytical results 
show that the AS has the expected primary, secondary and tertiary structures and physical-
chemical properties. Moreover Vedolizumab has the expected biological properties.   
Impurities  
The impurity profile of Vedolizumab was studied, identifying process- and product-related 
impurities, extractables and leachables. 
Control of active substance 
The active pharmaceutical ingredient, Vedolizumab, is not described in a pharmacopoeia and is 
controlled using an in-house specification.  This specification is used for active substance release 
testing and monitoring of stability.  
The analytical methods specifically developed for release and stability testing of the active 
substance have been appropriately validated. A summary for the procedure and validation of 
each analytical method was provided.  
The methods used evaluate Purity, Identity, Protein Concentration, and Potency.   
Batch analysis data 
The applicant provides an extensive justification of specifications. This justification is acceptable.

Reference standard 
The primary active substance reference standard was manufactured using the commercial 
manufacturing process.  Extensive characterization of the reference standard was performed.   
Container closure system 
The compatibility of the container closure system with the active substance formulation has been 
demonstrated through long-term stability studies. The potency, purity, and other quality 
attributes of the active substance are maintained following long term storage.  
Stability 
Stability studies based on ICH guidelines have been conducted for Vedolizumab active substance.  
Relevant parameters were selected to study the stability profile of the active substance. The 
analytical methods were validated and are described in the relevant sections of the dossier.  
The data from primary stability and supporting stability studies support the proposed shelf life at 
the designated storage condition in the proposed container closure system.  
2.2.3 Finished Medicinal Product 
The Vedolizumab finished product (FP) is a sterile, lyophilised formulation provided in a single-
use vial containing 300 mg of Vedolizumab antibody. Vedolizumab FP is filled into 20 mL Type I 
(Ph. Eur, USP) borosilicate glass vials. The vials are closed with a rubber stopper and sealed with 
a 20 mm aluminium seal with a plastic cap.  
Sterile Water for Injections (WFI) is used as a diluent for reconstitution. This diluent is 
commercially available and is not supplied with the FP. The reconstituted FP is then diluted into 
commercially available 250 mL of normal saline (Sterile 0.9 % sodium chloride). When 
reconstituted with 4.8 mL of sterile WFI, the vial contains an overfill. This overfill is necessary to 
withdraw the 5 mL, 300 mg dose.  
Pharmaceutical Development 
The reconstituted FP contains 60 mg/mL of active Vedolizumab antibody, histidine (as L-histidine 
and  L-histidine monohydrochloride),  L-arginine hydrochloride,  sucrose, and  polysorbate 80.  
The excipients were chosen to provide optimal buffering capacity, enhance stability, and protect 
the antibody during manufacture and storage. All excipients used in the FP formulation were 
determined to be compatible with each other and are appropriate for maintaining stability as 
demonstrated by the FP stability studies. 
Manufacture of the product 
Manufacturing development 
The FP was produced using three different processes: Process A, Process B and Process C, the 
current, commercial lyophilised formulation.  
An extensive analytical assessment was performed to support each new process and each 
change in manufacturer.   
Entyvio 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/676643/2013 
Page 18/166 
 
  
Manufacturing process 
The FP manufacturing process is an aseptic process with a sterile filtration step and sterility 
assurance included as a release criterion. The manufacturing process involves sterile filtration, 
aseptic filling and partial stoppering, lyophilisation, stoppering, and sealing of the vials. The 
sealed vials are capped, inspected, and bulk packaged for shipment to the labelling/packaging 
facility where they are labelled, packaged, and stored for commercial distribution.  
Process Validation 
The finished product process includes formulation and freeze drying in the final container. The 
use of Normal Operating Ranges (NOR) to set specifications is acceptable. 
Product specification 
Control of the Finished Product 
The finished product is not described in a pharmacopoeia and is controlled using an in-house 
specification. This specification is used for Finished Product release and shelf-life monitoring. 
The analytical methods for release and stability testing of the finished product have been 
appropriately validated. A summary for the procedure and validation of each analytical method 
was provided.  
The methods used evaluate Identity, Purity, Potency, and Protein concentration.   
In addition, compendial methods are performed at release and during stability testing of the 
finished product. 
Container closure system 
The primary container closure system consists of a single-use 20 mL, untreated, clear Type I 
glass tubing vial with a rubber stopper and an aluminium seal with a plastic flip-off cap. 
Compatibility of the primary packaging and the issue of leachables is sufficiently addressed in the 
dossier.  
Stability of the product 
Stability studies based on ICH guidelines were carried out for primary stability lots.  
Relevant parameters were selected to study the stability of the finished product. The analytical 
methods were appropriately validated.  
The data from primary stability studies support a shelf life of 36 months for the finished product 
when stored at the labelled storage condition of 5°C ± 3°C in the specified container closure 
system.  
Adventitious agents 
The information regarding the acceptability of animal-derived raw materials with respect to 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSEs) provided by the Applicant are deemed 
satisfactory as includes information of the source of animals with respect to geography, age, and

nature of the animal tissue. The relevant certification has been provided. Compliance with the 
TSE Guideline (EMEA/410/01 – rev. 3) has been sufficiently demonstrated. 
The manufacturing steps considered for virus validation studies are acceptable. The virus 
validation studies were performed in specialized laboratories in compliance with GLP Regulations. 
The selected model viruses are appropriate, as enveloped and non-enveloped viruses are 
included.  
Overall reduction factors are satisfactory and demonstrate the efficacy of the manufacturing 
process to remove/inactivate possible viral contaminants. The adventitious safety evaluation is 
overall acceptable. The approach used to assess residual retrovirus transmission risk can be 
considered appropriate and demonstrate a negligible risk for retrovirus-like particles (RLVPs).  
2.2.4 Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The control of the manufacturing process was extensively discussed during the course of the 
procedure. 
The proposed approach to control the manufacturing process was subject to a Major Objection. 
It was proposed that the applicant resolve these deficiencies either by re-writing the operating 
parameters in line with the data from the full scale batch validation, or by including a sufficient 
number of batches in order to increase the reliability of the estimate of intervals. Moreover, the 
applicant was requested to add a number of additional in-process control limits for fermentation 
steps and to revise the control strategy.  
To address the Major Objection, the operating parameters were tightened to reflect the 
manufacturing batches. The operating conditions were extensively revised.  
The Applicant has responded satisfactorily to all of the other quality concerns and questions 
identified during the course of procedure. 
2.2.5 Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
Based on the review of the data on quality, the manufacture and control of the Vedolizumab 
Active Substance and the Finished Product are considered acceptable.  
The Quality of the product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the 
conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform 
clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in satisfactory way.  
Safety concerning adventitious agents including viruses and TSE has been sufficiently assured. 
2.3 Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1 Introduction 
Vedolizumab is a humanized immunoglobulin (Ig)G1 mAb that binds exclusively to the α4β7 
integrin. It does not bind to the α4β1 integrin or the αEβ7 integrin, and is therefore designed to 
be highly selective. 
Entyvio 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/676643/2013 
Page 20/166 
 
  
Immunosurveillance is characterised by the preferential migration of lymphocyte subsets through 
specific tissues. It has been demonstrated that the α4β1 integrin mediates memory T lymphocyte 
migration into the CNS, bone marrow, and skin, via firm adhesion to VCAM-1 (vascular cell 
adhesion molecule 1). However, memory T lymphocytes expressing the α4β7 integrin 
preferentially migrate into the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, via firm adhesion to MAdCAM-1 
(mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1). These mechanisms of lymphocyte migration also 
mediate inflammation.  
The primary pharmacologic target of Vedolizumab is a subpopulation of leukocytes that 
expresses high levels of the α4β7 integrin. This subpopulation of cells is a pivotal mediator of gut 
inflammation. 
Vedolizumab is composed of 2 light chains of the kappa subclass and 2 IgG1 heavy chains. 
Vedolizumab was generated via grafting of the murine Act-1 mAb complementarity-determining 
regions (CDRs) into human IgG1 heavy and light chains. Vedolizumab and Act-1 share the same 
antigen recognition motifs (or CDRs) in the variable region of both the heavy and light chains.  
Pivotal non-clinical studies on safety pharmacology and general toxicity, including reproduction 
toxicity studies, were conducted in accordance with GLP principles. Toxicokinetic and some 
pharmacokinetic studies were also conducted according to GLP, while some other studies were 
not strictly GLP. These studies appeared to conform to adequate scientific standards of quality.

The specificity of vedolizumab for binding to human α4β7 integrin versus human α4β1 or αEβ7 
integrins was demonstrated with cell lines selectively expressing only one of these integrins. 
Using antibodies specific for the integrin subunits α4, αE, β1, and β7, it was shown that: a) 
RPMI8866 cells (a human B cell lymphoma-derived cell line) express α4 and β7 but not β1 or αE; 
b) RAMOS cells (a human B cell lymphoma-derived cell line) express α4 and β1 but not β7 or αE 
and c) αEβ7-L1.2 (murine pre-B cell lymphoma) cell transfectants express αE and β7 but not α4 
or β1. Vedolizumab bound to RPMI8866 cells but not to RAMOS or αEβ7 L1.2 cell transfectants, 
indicating binding to α4β7 but not α4β1 or αEβ7. 
Human Leukocytes Bound by vedolizumab 
The expression profile of the α4β7 integrin in human whole blood from healthy subjects was 
investigated to identify specific leukocyte subtypes whose function could be potentially inhibited 
by vedolizumab and conversely, leukocytes whose function could not be directly inhibited by 
vedolizumab. It was shown that discrete subpopulations of human leukocytes, expressing either 
the α4β1 or the α4β7 integrin, exist in vivo. Vedolizumab targets a smaller population of 
leukocytes than that targeted by dual α4β1 and α4β7 integrin-specific antagonists. These limited 
targeted cells are likely a primary determinant of the gut-selective pharmacologic profile of 
vedolizumab. 
Selectivity of vedolizumab for Inhibition of α4β7 Mediated Cell Adhesion Interactions 
Selectivity and potency of vedolizumab for blocking the adhesive interactions between the 
integrins α4β1 or α4β7 and the cell adhesion molecules MAdCAM-1, VCAM-1, and fibronectin 
were determined with cell lines selectively expressing only one of these adhesion molecules. 
These data showed that: a) α4β7 binds to MAdCAM-1, VCAM-1 and fibronectin, while α4β1 binds 
to VCAM-1 and fibronectin but not to MAdCAM-1; b) vedolizumab is a sub-nanomolar inhibitor of 
in vitro cellular adhesion mediated by interactions between α4β7 and MAdCAM-1 or fibronectin 
and c) vedolizumab does not inhibit α4β7-VCAM-1, α4β1-VCAM-1, or α4β1-fibronectin-mediated 
adhesive interactions. The selectivity of vedolizumab was maintained at 400 μg/ml, a 
concentration that is above mean Cmax in humans (115 µg/ml) after a single 30-minute IV 
infusion at 300 mg.

Binding affinities 
A comparison of the relative potencies of multiple lots (process A and B material only) of 
vedolizumab and Act-1 (a murine homologue of vedolizumab) was carried out  in competition 
binding assays in human whole blood lymphocytes from healthy subjects. Mean IC50 values for 
the inhibition of either vedolizumab- or Act-1-biotin binding to B and memory CD4 T lymphocytes 
by vedolizumab were within a range of 0.045 to 0.060 µg/ml (0.3 to 0.4 nM) and for Act-1, 
mean IC50 values were in the range 0.059 to 0.078 µg/ml (0.39 to 0.52 nM). The binding 
affinities of several lots of vedolizumab (including CHO and NS0-derived material) and Act-1 for 
the α4β7 integrin on human whole blood B and memory CD4-T lymphocytes were similar 
(process A and B material only). 
Binding affinity of vedolizumab was very similar for α4β7 integrins in cynomolgus monkey and 
human whole blood lymphocytes from healthy subjects. The IC50 values for the inhibition of 
vedolizumab binding to either B or memory CD4 T lymphocytes by vedolizumab were 0.059 
μg/ml (0.39 nM) and 0.060 μg/ml (0.40 nM) for monkey and human B cells, respectively and 
0.057 μg/ml (0.37 nM) and 0.055 μg/ml (0.38 nM) for monkey and human memory CD4 T 
lymphocytes, respectively. The binding affinity of vedolizumab was very similar for the α4β7 
integrin of rabbit and human whole blood lymphocytes from healthy subjects. The IC50 values 
for the inhibition of vedolizumab binding to either B or CD4+ T lymphocytes were 0.039 ± 0.009 
μg/ml (0.26 nM) and 0.051 μg/ml (0.34 nM) for rabbit and human B cells, respectively and 
0.063 μg/ml (0.42 nM) and 0.070 μg/ml (0.47 nM) for rabbit and human CD4+ T lymphocytes, 
respectively. 
The kinetics of reconstitution of α4β7 function in human cd4-positive memory T 
lymphocytes after removal of vedolizumab 
Non-clinical studies have shown that the pharmacodynamic effects of vedolizumab are reversible 
upon removal of the antibody. The mechanism of reversal was investigated in human purified or 
whole blood CD4 memory T lymphocytes . This study aimed to observe the mechanism of the 
vedolizumab receptor pharmacodynamic (PD) effect in terms of whether bound vedolizumab 
causes α4β7 receptor internalisation and, if it did, the mechanism and kinetics of the restoration 
of α4β7 function after removal of vedolizumab. These data showed that the pharmacologic 
activity of cells inhibited by vedolizumab could be partially restored within 24 hours after removal 
of vedolizumab, with near complete restoration within 4 days. 
Species cross-reactivity 
The species cross-reactivity of vedolizumab was assessed using mouse, rat, guinea pig, New 
Zealand white rabbit, cynomolgus monkey, rhesus monkey, and human whole blood stained with 
vedolizumab and Act-1. Binding of vedolizumab and Act-1 to α4β7 was measured by saturation 
binding and in competition binding experiments and quantified by flow cytometry. It was shown 
that vedolizumab and Act-1 bind with similar subnanomolar affinity to α4β7 in rabbit, 
cynomolgus monkey, rhesus monkey and human blood. Neither vedolizumab nor Act-1 bound to 
the α4β7integrin expressed in mouse, rat, or guinea pig blood. Rabbits and rhesus and 
cynomolgus monkeys were therefore shown to be pharmacologically appropriate species to use 
when testing vedolizumab.

Comparative studies Binding affinity of vedolizumab process A and B 
The relative potencies of multiple lots of Process A and CHO-derived vedolizumab (process B) for 
binding to the α4β7 integrin on peripheral blood lymphocytes in human whole blood were 
determined. Data indicated that the binding affinities of Process A material and CHO derived 
vedolizumab were nearly identical.  
Tissue Cross-reactivity studies 
GLP-compliant tissue cross-reactivity studies were conducted on monkey and normal human 
tissues. Binding was restricted to leukocytes in lymphoid tissues, within the lumens of blood 
vessels, or as low-grade inflammatory infiltrates in various non-lymphoid tissues. 
Cotton-top Tamarin 
In vivo, colitic cotton-top tamarins (these develop a type of colitis spontaneously) were used to 
determine the functional relevance of α4β7 in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory disease. 
Animals were given 2.0 mg/kg Act-1, the murine vedolizumab precursor, for 8 days.  There was 
improvement in stool quality throughout the study, starting on Day 3, in animals given Act-1 
compared to controls.  Histopathology evaluated on Day 5 revealed a reduction in inflammatory 
infiltrates with Act-1 treatment compared to the control group, demonstrating anti-inflammatory 
activity. 
Evaluation of humanised monoclonal antibodies against alpha 4 integrins in the rhmog 
(myelin oligodendrocyte protein) induced experimental autoimmune Encephalomyelitis 
(EAE) model in Rhesus monkeys 
As part of the evaluation of vedolizumab in the context of other integrin antagonists and 
unwanted effects (such as PML), a study  was conducted to determine if specific blockade of the 
α4β7 integrin with vedolizumab would affect immune surveillance and inflammation of the 
central nervous system (CNS) in a NHP model of EAE. Animals were given intravenous (IV) doses 
once a week of vedolizumab, vehicle control or the positive control antibody natalizumab. 
Exposure was demonstrated. All 7 animals exposed to vedolizumab exhibited trough vedolizumab 
concentrations that exceeded the EC50 (27.6 ng/ml) for α4β7saturation in vitro between Day 7 
and 21. 
Clinical Signs 
Fifty percent (4 of 8) of vehicle-dosed animals and 57% (4 of 7) of vedolizumab-dosed animals 
developed symptoms of EAE, whereas 14% (1 of 7) of natalizumab-exposed animals developed 
symptoms of EAE. Vehicle and vedolizumab-exposed animals developed EAE with similar 
kinetics, whereas clinical symptoms of EAE were delayed or prevented in the natalizumab group. 
Since natalizumab is a dual α4β1 and α4β7 integrin antagonist, whereas vedolizumab is a 
selective α4β7 integrin antagonist, the results of this study indicate that antagonism of the α4β1 
integrin impairs development of clinical symptoms of EAE.

Infiltration of the CNS as Measured by Leukocyte Count in the CSF  
Normal immune surveillance of the CNS was demonstrated by increases in the level of CSF 
leukocytes in this model. Conversely, impaired CNS immune surveillance is indicated by no 
increases in the level of CSF leukocytes in this model. An increase in the level of white blood cells 
(WBCs) in the CSF was observed in animals that developed EAE as compared to their pre-
exposure levels. The mean values of WBCs in the CSF of the vehicle control and vedolizumab 
groups were higher at necropsy than at predose sampling. This CSF infiltrate consisted primarily 
of total T lymphocytes, helper and cytotoxic T lymphocyte subsets and monocytes, and total B 
lymphocytes to a far lesser extent. A decrease in the level of NK cells was observed, thought to 
be a result of an indirect consequence of other subsets increasing. In contrast, the mean level of 
WBCs in the CSF of the natalizumab group was unchanged from predose sampling. These data 
are consistent with data from a chronic toxicology study in which vedolizumab did not decrease 
CSF parameters (WBC counts, red blood cell [RBC] counts, and total protein concentrations) or T 
lymphocyte populations in healthy NHP. These data are also consistent with clinical data showing 
that natalizumab decreased the levels of WBCs, helper and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and B 
lymphocytes in the CSF of patients with multiple sclerosis or who developed PML (Literature 
reference Stuve O, Marra CM, Jerome KR, Cook L, Cravens PD, Cepok S, et al. Immune 
surveillance in multiple sclerosis patients treated with natalizumab. Ann Neurol. 2006;59(5):743-
7)).  
It was concluded that antagonism of the α4β1 integrin is associated with impairment of leukocyte 
infiltration into the CSF, since increases in levels of CSF leukocytes were observed for the vehicle 
control and vedolizumab groups, but not with the dual α4β1 and α4β7 integrin antagonist 
(natalizumab) group.  
Infiltration of the CNS as measured by brain MRI 
The clinical symptoms of rhesus EAE result from inflammation and demyelinating lesions in 
cerebral white matter that are initiated by autoreactive helper T lymphocytes.  
The mean values for lesion loads in brain hemispheres from the vehicle or vedolizumab groups 
were shown to be similar and were higher than the mean value observed for the animals given 
natalizumab, indicating that less immune surveillance of the CNS occurred in the natalizumab 
group. It was therefore concluded that antagonism of the α4β1 integrin impairs the development 
of white matter lesions, since natalizumab, the dual α4β1 and α4β7 integrin antagonist, delayed 
or prevented the development of EAE compared to vedolizumab.  
Infiltration of the CNS as measured by brain tissue histopathology 
Qualitatively comparable demyelination was observed in the white matter of vehicle controls and 
in animals given vedolizumab. Qualitatively comparable inflammation was observed in the white 
matter of control animals and in animals given vedolizumab. These findings were not seen in 
animals given natalizumab.

Leukocytosis in the Vasculature 
Vascular leukocytosis results from impaired migration of leukocytes out of the vessels and into 
peripheral tissue of organs, such as the CNS. Levels of total leukocytes and various leukocyte 
subsets in the vasculature were monitored as an inverse indicator of immune surveillance of 
peripheral tissue. Animals given natalizumab showed a significant (p <0.05) vascular 
leukocytosis and lymphocytosis compared to controls. The leukocytosis consisted of significant (p 
<0.05) elevations in monocytes, lymphocytes, basophils, and eosinophils, but not neutrophils. 
The lymphocytosis consisted of significant (p <0.05) elevations in total T lymphocytes, total and 
memory helper T lymphocytes, total and memory cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and total B 
lymphocytes, but not NK cells. No differences in leukocyte count, erythrocyte count, reticulocyte 
count, platelet count, and differential counts of neutrophils (segmented), lymphocytes, 
monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils were observed in animals given vedolizumab compared to 
controls. There were no differences between animals given vedolizumab and controls (observed 
by flow cytometry analysis) of lymphocyte subpopulations, most notably total B lymphocytes, 
total T lymphocytes, helper T lymphocytes, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, memory helper T 
lymphocytes, memory cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and NK cells. It was therefore concluded that 
dual α4β1 and α4β7 integrin antagonist natalizumab induces a broad-spectrum, vascular 
leukocytosis in contrast to the selective α4β7 integrin antagonist vedolizumab, which does not 
induce leukocytosis. This leukocytosis results from inhibiting migration of leukocytes from the 
vasculature, which, in turn, impairs immune surveillance of peripheral tissue. 
Migration of leukocytes into the CNS 
The frequency of mononuclear leukocytes that recognized MOG in each animal was assessed to 
determine if vedolizumab and natalizumab affected the induction of these autoreactive cells. The 
aim of this study was to gain mechanistic insight into any potential effects on EAE. The presence 
of recombinant human MOG (rhMOG)-reactive leukocytes (i.e., pathogenic cells) was determined 
in ex vivo proliferation assays of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and splenocytes from 
animals given vehicle, natalizumab, or vedolizumab. These data indicate that 21 of 22 animals 
contained a quantity of autoreactive cells that was sufficient to induce EAE, thus showing that 
the inhibition of EAE by natalizumab did not result from failure to induce autoreactive cells. It 
was concluded that the inhibitory effect of the dual α4β1 and α4β7 integrin antagonist 
natalizumab on the development of EAE in rhesus monkeys may result from impaired migration 
of autoreactive leukocytes from the vasculature into the CNS, thereby preventing recognition of 
endogenous MOG expressed by oligodendrocytes (i.e., immune surveillance of the CNS) and the 
development of EAE.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Cytokine release or T lymphocyte activation 
The potential of vedolizumab to mediate cytokine release or T lymphocyte activation was 
examined by incubating 400 µg/ml of antibody in diluted whole blood at 37ºC for up to 24 hours 
and evaluating activation by measuring cytokine release into the processed plasma and the 
expression of T lymphocyte activation cell surface markers. Vedolizumab did not elicit increases 
in concentration of the cytokines IFNγ TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 (P70), IL-12

(P40), IL-17, and IL-23. In addition, no effect was observed on the expression of the T 
lymphocyte activation markers CD25 and CD69.  
Human regulatory T cell function  
The potential effects of vedolizumab, the anti-α4 mAb natalizumab, and the anti-β7 mAb FIB504 
on the suppressive activity of the total regulatory T (Treg) cell population, and more specifically 
of the gut-homing subset of this population, were investigated  in vitro in peripheral blood from 
healthy human volunteers (study RPT-01954). There were no consistent effects of vedolizumab 
(anti- α4β7), natalizumab (anti- α4), or FIB504 (anti-β7) on the suppressive activity of the total 
and gut-homing subset of Treg cells, as compared to vehicle control or an isotype control 
antibody. These results suggest that the in vivo activity of vedolizumab does not affect Treg 
function. 
Complement-Dependent Cytotoxicity (CDC) of Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear 
Cells (PBMCs) Fc-mediated cytotoxic 
The potential CDC activity of vedolizumab was compared in human peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMCs) to that of OKT3 (muromonab-CD3 – known Fc-mediated cytotoxicity). The assay 
measured lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release from PBMCs incubated with rabbit complement in 
the presence of vedolizumab (test article), OKT3 (positive control), or human IgG1/kappa  
(MLN1202, the isotype control for MLN0002) at various concentrations. Vedolizumab did not 
cause CDC in vitro in mononuclear cells isolated from human peripheral blood.  
Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) of a α4β7 -expressing 
RPMI8866  cells 
Cytoxicity was measured using CytoTox 96 Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay kit. ADCC was not 
induced by either vedolizumab or Act-1 at concentrations as high as 10 µg/ml, a concentration 
approximately 100- to 200-fold over what is needed for saturation binding of vedolizumab to 
RPMI 8866 cells. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Telemetered Cynomolgus monkeys were given the control article by a 1-hour IV infusion on Day 
1. Four animals per dose (10 and 100 mg/kg) were given a 1 hour IV infusion of vedolizumab on 
Day 6. Vedolizumab was well tolerated and there were no test article-related changes in clinical 
signs or effects on heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and ECG parameters (qualitative and 
quantitative) up to 100 mg/kg. From approximately 1 hour after the end of infusion (120-minute 
time point) through the end of the recording period, the mean arterial pressure (MAP) was 
approximately 5 to 15 mmHg less at 10 and 100 mg/kg vedolizumab compared to controls. On 
review of the procedure during the collection of the MAP measurements, it was noted that the 
primate jackets and ambulatory infusion pumps were removed after the administration of the 10 
and 100 mg/kg vedolizumab were completed on Day 6. In contrast, the primate jackets 
remained on the animals following administration of the control dose on Day 1 in preparation for 
dosing on Day 6. The Applicant stated that it was subsequently learned that animals wearing a 
jacket similar to the one used in this study results in an increase in the MAP which returns to 
pre-jacketed values upon its removal (Soloviev, MV et. al., Safety Pharmacology Society 
Entyvio

meeting, San Diego, California, September 2006). Therefore, the difference in MAP between 
control and vedolizumab groups was considered to be due to the effect of the jackets during the 
control group recordings. The 100-mg/kg dose is associated with a mean Cmax (5260 µg/ml) 
approximately 46 times the geometric mean Cmax (115 µg/ml) in humans after a single 300-mg 
30-minute IV infusion. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The Applicant stated that no studies of pharmacodynamic drug interactions have been conducted 
as vedolizumab is a humanized antibody and does not modulate production of cytokines, which 
can affect drug metabolism. This was considered acceptable to the CHMP. 
2.3.3 Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic studies 
The PK and TK profile of vedolizumab was investigated in numerous in vivo studies in New 
Zealand white rabbits and NHP. These two species have been shown to be pharmacologically 
responsive to vedolizumab.

c  The TK, PD, and PAHA analyses for the initial 13-week study were non-GLP-compliant, 
while the definitive 13-week study was GLP-compliant. 
Methods of analysis 
In the early GLP compliant studies of vedolizumab (Process A), non-GLP-compliant methods were 
used to measure vedolizumab concentrations, primate anti-human antibody (PAHA) levels, and 
levels of free α4β7 sites and bound vedolizumab. Suitable validation data have been provided. 
The methods used for analysis were acceptable to the CHMP. 
Process change 
To support process changes in manufacturing vedolizumab, a GLP-compliant single-dose 
toxicology study was conducted with intravenous doses of 0, 10 and 30 mg/kg.  The study 
showed similar serum Cmax, AUC0-168hr and TK profiles in NHP/monkeys 
Absorption  
The intended route of administration is IV therefore there are no absorption data. The lack of 
absorption data was accepted to the CHMP given the biological nature of the product. 
Distribution 
Dedicated studies of tissue distribution or protein binding and red blood cell distribution were not 
conducted with vedolizumab. The lack of specific distribution data was accepted to the CHMP 
given the biological nature of the product.  
Metabolism 
Metabolism studies were not conducted with vedolizumab, in accordance with International 
Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline S6(R1), which states that classical 
biotransformation studies are not required for biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals, as the 
expected consequence of their metabolism is degradation to small peptides and individual amino 
acids, and the metabolic pathways are therefore generally understood.  
Excretion 
Dedicated excretion studies were not conducted with vedolizumab, in accordance with ICH 
Guideline S6(R1), which states that routine studies that attempt to assess mass balance are not 
useful. This was agreed by the CHMP. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
No studies of PK drug interactions have been conducted as vedolizumab is a humanized antibody 
and does not modulate production of cytokines, which can affect drug metabolism. The lack of 
specific PK drug interaction data was accepted by the CHMP given the biological nature of the 
product.

Overall pharmacokinetic characteristics 
The PK of vedolizumab was characterized by low CL (0.180 to 0.266 ml/hr/kg), low apparent Vss 
(80.7 to 88.3 ml/kg), and long terminal elimination t1/2 (336 to 362 hr). Vedolizumab was 
immunogenic in animals, with lower immunogenic titers at higher doses. The PD of vedolizumab 
was independent of cell type (CD20+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD45+/-). In the toxicology studies, 
saturation of α4β7 (as measured by the bound vedolizumab assay) was rapid and, in all NHPs 
and most New Zealand white rabbits, was maintained throughout the dosing interval and the 
duration of the dosing phase of the studies at the highest dose (100 mg/kg).  
The exposure at the NOAEL of 100 mg/kg in monkeys is approximately 46 and 18 times higher 
than the geometric mean clinical Cmax and AUC, respectively, after a single 300-mg 30-minute 
intravenous (IV) infusion. The results of the PK/TK studies demonstrate that there was adequate 
exposure and a demonstrable PD effect in the toxicology studies.  
Immunogenicity 
The immunogenicity of vedolizumab was assessed by measuring rabbit and primate antihuman 
antibodies (RAHA and PAHA) to determine whether antihuman antibodies affected exposure to 
vedolizumab in animals. As expected with a humanized mAb, vedolizumab is immunogenic in 
animals, with lower titers at higher doses. Overall, the incidence of RAHA and PAHA was variable 
across single- and repeat-dose studies and across doses. RAHA/PAHA had a neutralising effect on 
the PK and PD of vedolizumab in some of the animals at the low and mid doses (10 and 30 
mg/kg), but continuous α4β7 saturation was achieved in animals that did not develop a 
neutralising RAHA/PAHA effect. At the highest dose (100 mg/kg), RAHA/PAHA had little effect on 
the PK or PD of vedolizumab. At this dose (NOAEL), continuous saturation of the target, α4β7, 
was maintained throughout the dosing and recovery phases of the study in nearly all of the 
animals in the GLP-compliant repeat-dose toxicology studies.

a Immunogenicity was assessed as part of the general toxicology studies. 
b Part of the 13-week repeat-dose toxicology study 
Three manufacturing processes of vedolizumab (processes A, B and C) were used. A comparative 
GLP-compliant single-dose intravenous infusion toxicology study with process B and process C 
material was conducted in male and female cynomolgus monkeys. Process B and C material 
showed similar serum Cmax, AUC0-168hr, and TK profiles at 10 and 30 mg/kg vedolizumab.  
A comparative GLP-compliant 2 week IV repeat dose study was conducted with Process A and B 
material. One animal given process A vomited on Day 1 approximately 4 minutes after the start 
of infusion and had mild to moderate swelling of the left eye. One animal given process B 
material vomited approximately 2 minutes postdose on Day 4. The signs resolved without 
treatment. Transient increases in aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 
were noted in most animals at 1 or more time points after dosing. These occurred with similar 
frequency with Process A or B material. TK parameters (AUC and Cmax) were generally not 
comparable in this study. However the mean Tmax for process A was biased by the data from 
one animal where the Tmax was 48 hours. In the other 3 animals in this dose group the Tmax 
occurred at 0.5 hours postdose (the earliest sampling time point). The exposure to vedolizumab 
(as measured by either Cmax or AUC) was slightly higher for process A after both the first and 
last dose. The pharmacodynamics of both materials were broadly similar for both CD4+ and CD8+ 
cells.  
Single dose toxicity 
A comparative GLP-compliant single-dose intravenous infusion toxicology study with process B 
and process C material was conducted in male and female Cynomolgus monkeys. Animals were 
given IV doses of 10 or 30 mg/kg of either process B or C material. Controls were given 50-mM 
histidine, 125-mM arginine, 100-mg/ml sucrose, and 0.6-mg/ml polysorbate 80. Animals were 
observed for 7 days after dosing. Both process and B material were well tolerated with no in-life 
clinical signs noted or effects on food consumption, body weight, serum chemistry or 
haematology parameters. Process B and Process C material showed similar serum Cmax, AUC 
from 0 to 168 hours (AUC0-168hr). There were no marked differences in the extent of binding to 
the target α4β7 sites between process B and process C material. Pronounced PAHA was not 
observed (all titers were ≤ 100).

Repeat dose toxicity 
Non-human primate 
2 weeks    
Male cynomolgus monkeys were given a 30-minute infusion (Day 1) and slow bolus 
(approximately 1-minute) IV injection (Days 4, 8, 11, and 15) of process A or B vedolizumab at 
10 mg/kg. One animal given process A material vomited on Day 1 approximately 4 minutes after 
the start of infusion and had mild to moderate swelling of the left eye. One animal given process 
B material vomited approximately 2 minutes postdose on Day 4. The signs resolved without 
treatment. There were no effects on body weight or test article-related effects on haematology 
parameters. Transient increases in aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST) were noted in most animals at 1 or more time points after dosing. These occurred with 
similar frequency with Process A or B material. These elevations were of unknown significance 
and were not observed in subsequent studies.  
13 weeks    
Male and female cynomolgus monkeys were given I.V doses of vedolizumab (process B) at 10, 
30, or 100 mg/kg once every 2 weeks (Days 1, 15, 29, 43, 57, 71, and 85) by slow intravenous 
infusion. No changes in clinical signs, body weight, food consumption, ophthalmology, ECG, 
clinical pathology, urinalysis, immunological assessments, organ weights, and macroscopic data 
were observed. An increased number of Balantidium protozoa were noted in the cecum and colon 
of 1 of 12 animals dosed at 30 mg/kg and 2 of 12 animals dosed at 100 mg/kg, respectively. 
This was not associated with adverse effects. Balantidium protozoa were not observed in 
recovery animals. Because predose Balantidium levels in the cecum and colon were unknown, 
the significance of this finding was uncertain. The Applicant stated that the possibility of a test 
article-related effect upon intestinal flora cannot be ruled out. The NOAEL was considered to be 
100 mg/kg. 
 Vedolizumab was immunogenic in most animals. In general, the PAHA had an effect on the TK 
and PD of vedolizumab, with the effect being most pronounced at 10 mg/kg. The α4β7sites on 
peripheral lymphocytes were shown to be saturated with vedolizumab for the duration of this 
study. 
A bound site assay was used in this study to monitor levels of the gut-homing subset (α4β7high) 
of memory (CD45RA-) helper (CD4+) T lymphocytes in the vasculature of monkeys. At predose, 
this gut-homing subset represented 19% to 28% of the overall memory helper T lymphocyte 
population in the vasculature. After administration of vedolizumab, these percentages increased 
to highs of 61% by Day 29. This elevation persisted for the duration of the investigation at 30 
and 100 mg/kg, but was reduced by Day 29 at 10 mg/kg, indicating that the response was lost 
in some at this dose. These data indicate that the relative proportion of the gut-homing subset 
within the overall memory helper T lymphocyte population in the vasculature increased 3- to 4-
fold, possibly because egress into the gut submucosa was blocked by vedolizumab. No changes 
were observed in any other leukocyte subset examined, including the overall memory helper T 
lymphocyte population, indicating, according to the Applicant, that the relative increase in the 
Entyvio 
Assessment report

Page 32/166 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
percentage of gut-homing memory helper T lymphocytes is caused by an increase in the absolute 
number of cells expressing α4β7 in the vasculature.  
NK cells are a constituent of innate immunity that expresses the α4β7 integrin. Potential effects 
of vedolizumab on NK cell cytolytic activity were assessed ex vivo from samples taken at predose 
and postdose. No significant effect of vedolizumab was observed on NK cell cytolytic activity. 
 T cell-dependent antigen response (TDAR) was also examined. Primary TDAR was induced 
during the third month of exposure to vedolizumab by immunising monkeys SC with keyhole 
limpet hemocyanin (KLH). Animals at all doses mounted primary IgM and IgG TDARs to KLH that 
were comparable to controls and there were no significant differences in group mean anti-KLH 
IgM or IgG TDARs, compared to mean control values. Exposure to vedolizumab does not 
decrease systemic TDAR in the NHP. 
26 weeks  
Male and female cynomolgus monkeys were given I.V doses of vedolizumab (process B) at 10, 
30, or 100 mg/kg once on Days 1, 15, 29, 43, 57, 71, 85, 99, 113, 127, 141, 155, and 169 with 
by IV infusion. A 12 week recovery period was included on this study. There were no in-life 
behavioural effects and there were no test article-related changes on food consumption, 
electrocardiology, ophthalmology, clinical pathology, cerebrospinal fluid evaluations, organ 
weights or macroscopic data evaluated through to Day 183 (26 weeks).  
Microscopic findings consisted of minimal to mild lymphoid depletion in the Peyer’s patches of the 
GI tract in males at all doses and increased epithelial regeneration in stomachs of both sexes, 
with lymphoplasmacytic gastritis at all doses. An effect on Peyer’s patches is consistent with the 
role of α4β7 in mediating lymphocyte trafficking into this secondary lymphoid organ. After an 
approximately 12-week dose-free period, lymphoid depletion in the Peyer’s patches of the GI 
tract was only noted in 1/4 animals at 100 mg/kg (a female); microscopic changes in the 
stomach did not differ between animals given vedolizumab and controls. The NOAEL was 
considered to be > 100 mg/kg.  
Vedolizumab was immunogenic in most animals. In general, PAHA had an effect on the TK and 
PD, with the effect being most pronounced at 10 mg/kg. PAHA had no effect on TK and PD at 
100 mg/kg.  
At predose, free α4β7 integrin was detected on 32% to 36% of this population. Free α4β7 
integrin could not be detected on this population within 30 minutes after the initial infusion and 
at predicted trough exposure levels (i.e., pre-infusion) for the remainder of the study, in contrast 
to controls. These data demonstrate that the target was saturated by vedolizumab throughout 
this study.  
A bound site assay was used to monitor levels of the gut-homing subset (α4β7high) of memory 
(CD45RA-) helper (CD4+) T lymphocytes in the vasculature. At predose, the gut-homing subset 
of memory helper T lymphocytes represented 15% to 22% of the overall population of 
lymphocytes in the vasculature of these animals. After dosing, these percentages increased to 
highs of 64% to 73%. This elevation persisted for the duration of the study at all doses. These 
data indicate that the relative proportion of the gut-homing subset within the overall memory 
helper T lymphocyte population in the vasculature increased 3- to 4-fold, as egress into the gut

submucosa was blocked by vedolizumab. No changes were observed in any other leukocyte 
subset, including the overall memory helper T lymphocyte population, indicating that the relative 
increase in the percentage of gut-homing memory helper T lymphocytes is caused by an increase 
in the absolute number of cells expressing α4β7 in the vasculature. 
Vedolizumab also induced a reduction in the frequency of leukocytes expressing β7 integrins in 
the GI tract of these monkeys, consistent with the pharmacologic inhibition of α4β7– MAdCAM-1 
binding by Vedolizumab. Therefore, it can be postulated that the Vedolizumab associated 
increase in gut-homing memory helper T lymphocytes in the vasculature was a consequence of 
impaired lymphocyte migration into the tissue. 
Rabbits 
12 weeks   
Male and female New Zealand white rabbits were given I.V doses of 30 or 100 mg/kg 
vedolizumab once every 2 weeks (Days 0, 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, and 84). A 4 week recovery period 
was included in this study.  
Two of the 20 animals exposed to vedolizumab were found dead. The cause of death for these 
animals was not determined from the microscopic examination. Clinical pathology changes 
consisted of increased urea nitrogen (BUN) and AST and decreased lower red cells, haemoglobin, 
haematocrit, and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and higher mean 
corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) compared to values at 
predose in these animals. Similar clinical pathology changes were not seen in animals that 
survived until the end of the in-life phase. The female that died also had higher mean absolute 
and percent lymphocytes; these changes were considered test article-related, as similar changes 
were observed in surviving animals at the scheduled primary necropsy on Day 98. The cause of 
these deaths was unknown. These deaths are not believed to be test article-related as similar 
effects were not seen in the GLP-compliant embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study in rabbits 
and 13-week repeat-dose toxicity study in NHPs.  
In those animals that were euthanized at the end of the in-life phase, haematologic and 
histologic effects were consistent with the mechanism of action of vedolizumab (inhibition of 
α4β7, resulting in retention of α4β7+ leukocytes within the vasculature). Higher spleen weights 
were correlated with lymphoid hyperplasia and increased amyloidosis of the periarteriolar 
lymphoid sheaths (PALS) of the spleen. Similar observations have been made in other species, 
such as mice, with elevated serum amyloid protein A, which is the precursor of secondary 
amyloid protein Infusion of non-human species with a humanized mAb results in recognition of 
the non-self-protein by the animal’s immune system. The lymphoid hyperplasia was attributed to 
this immunogenicity. The splenic effects were attributed to this immunogenicity, and not to 
antagonism of the α4β7integrin, and were therefore not considered adverse. 
The applicant defined the NOAEL as 100 mg/kg for this study.  
There were no pronounced sex-related differences in serum concentrations or derived TK 
parameters. Vedolizumab was immunogenic in most animals. RAHA affected the TK and PD, with 
the effect being most pronounced at 30 mg/kg. At 100 mg/kg, vedolizumab was detected up to 
14 days after the last dose (Day 84) in 8 of 9 animals and up to 42 days after administration of 
Entyvio 
Assessment report

Page 34/166 
 
  
 
the last dose in 4 of 4 animals. At 30 mg/kg, vedolizumab was detected up to 14 days after the 
last dose in 4 of 9 animals. After the last dose, exposure to vedolizumab (as measured by either 
Cmax or AUC) increased as the dose increased. This increase was greater than dose-proportional 
due to the presence of neutralising RAHA. 
At 100 mg/kg, saturation of α4β7 (as measured by the bound vedolizumab assay) was 
maintained throughout the dosing interval and for the duration of the dosing phase of the study 
in the majority of animals. At 30 mg/kg, the effect of neutralizing RAHA on the PK and PD was 
pronounced, with approximately 60% of the animals having reduced exposure to vedolizumab 
and a reduced PD response. 
Findings common across both species 
Minimal to mild small lymphoid follicles (a decrease in the size) in the submucosal lymphoid 
nodules (Peyer’s patches) of the sacculus rotundus was seen in the 3 month rabbit study at 30 
and 100 mg/kg. In the 6 month monkey study, minimal to mild lymphoid depletion in the Peyer’s 
patches of the gastrointestinal tract was seen in males at all doses (10, 30, and 100 mg/kg). 
After a 12-week dose free period, lymphoid depletion in the Peyer’s patches of the 
gastrointestinal tract was noted in one animal at 100 mg/kg dosed animals (a female). It should 
be noted that although animals were dosed for 6 months (as an IV infusion every 2 weeks), the 
presence of complete saturation of α4β7 sites on peripheral lymphocytes in all animals during the 
12-week dose-free period demonstrated that animals were exposed to pharmacological 
concentrations of vedolizumab for 9 months. These lymphoid effects were considered to be due 
to pharmacology (decreased trafficking of peripheral lymphocytes to the gut). It is agreed that 
this is probably the case.

Immunogenicity seemed lower at higher doses in animals which was suggested to reflect 
induction of immune tolerance.   
The primary goal of a further study was to compare PK and pharmacodynamic profiles between 
Processes B and C, additionally immunogenicity was tested at 7 days post dose. TK and PD non-
clinical data, together with quality evaluation, support the comparability between Vedolizumab 
Processes B and C. 
Genotoxicity 
Genotoxicity studies were not conducted as vedolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody 
and so are not required in-line with ICH Guideline S6(R1). Given the biologic  nature of 
vedolizumab the lack of genotoxicity studies was accepted by the CHMP.  
Carcinogenicity 
Conventional carcinogenicity risk assessment studies (ie, rodent bioassays) have not been 
conducted with vedolizumab as rodents are not pharmacologically responsive to this mAb. This is 
consistent with ICH Guideline S6(R1).  
Effect of Act-1 Antibody on the Growth of the α4β7 Expressing RPMI 8866 Human B-Cell 
Lymphoma Cell Line (non-GLP). 
A study was carried out to investigate the effect of Act-1 on the growth rate of a human chronic 
myeloid B cell line that expresses the α4β7 integrin targeted by Vedolizumab. The effect of the 
Act-1 antibody was assessed during a 4-day period during which the cells proliferated

approximately 6 times. Cells were plated into 96-well plates at 30,000 cells per well and treated 
either with the IgG1 control or the Act-1 antibodies at concentrations ranging from 0.039 to 20 
µg/ml. The first cell growth assay was performed 24 hours after antibodies were added to the 
cells, then once every consecutive day for a total of 4 measurements. Both the control and Act-1 
antibodies had a minimal inhibitory effect on cell growth. Statistical analysis of the data showed 
that both antibodies inhibited cell growth, although the degree of cell growth inhibition in the 
Act-1 groups was lower than in the corresponding IgG1 groups, a difference that was most 
visible at Days 3 and 4. Over all it was shown that binding of Act-1 to a hematopoietic tumour 
cell line that expresses the α4β7 integrin did not enhance cell proliferation in vitro. 
Binding Specificity of Act-1 in malignant human tumours (non-GLP) 
A study was conducted to characterise immunohistochemical staining of Act-1 with malignant 
human tumour tissues. Act-1 was tested at 2 and 20 μg/ml on 10 samples of human colon 
malignant adenocarcinoma. All 10 samples demonstrated Act-1- specific staining of cytoplasmic 
granules and membranes of mononuclear cells (representing the resident or infiltrating 
lymphocyte population, with a lack of staining in surrounding neoplastic tissue). This pattern of 
staining is consistent with the expression pattern of α4β7 integrin, which is expressed on the 
surface of lymphocytes.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
No studies of fertility and early embryonic development have been conducted.  
A GLP-compliant study was conducted in rabbits to evaluate potential for embryofetal toxicity 
(Study WIL-416044 Amendment 1). The NOAEL for maternal toxicity and embryofetal 
developmental was considered to be 100 mg/kg.  
The vehicle control or vedolizumab (10, 30 or 100 mg/kg) was administered as an intravenous 
infusion to 4 groups of 25 time-mated female New Zealand White rabbits on Gestation Day 7. For 
the TK, RAHA and PD evaluations, an additional 3 rabbits/group were administered the vehicle or 
test article on a comparable regimen as main study rabbits. The exposure to vedolizumab 
showed trends towards increasing in a greater than dose-proportional manner. At 100 mg/kg 
(the highest dose examined), saturation of binding to α4β7 sites was achieved throughout the 
study period. Immunogenicity in the 10 mg/kg group was greater than those in the higher dose 
groups and the PD effects appeared to be broadly similar at doses with no immunogenic 
response. 
All females survived to the scheduled laparohysterectomy. There were no test article-related 
clinical findings at any dose level. Slightly lower mean maternal body weight gains and food 
consumption were noted in the 100 mg/kg group immediately following infusion (Gestation Day 
7 to 8) and when the entire period of major organogenesis (Gestation Days 7 to 20) was 
evaluated. However, a slight compensatory increase in mean body weight gain was noted in this 
group during Gestation Days 20 to 29, when test article exposure would have been minimal at 
best (previous toxicokinetic data indicates test article exposure is maintained for at least 2 
weeks). There were no test article-related effects on maternal net body weight, net body weight 
gain, or gravid uterine weight, and intrauterine growth and survival were unaffected at all dose 
levels. 
Entyvio

Based on the lack of maternal and embryo/fetal effects and no significant effects on mean 
maternal body weight gain and food consumption during the period of major organogenesis, 100 
mg/kg was considered to be at least the NOAEL for maternal toxicity and embryo/fetal 
developmental toxicity. 
Prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function 
Pregnant female cynomolgus monkeys were given a 20- to 30-minute IV infusion every 2 weeks 
from Days 20 to 140 of gestation at 10 or 100 mg/kg vedolizumab (process B material). All 
surviving dams and infants were euthanized on Day 181 postpartum. Vaginal smears were 
examined daily from Day 20 postcoitum until delivery. In infants, external abnormalities, 
morphologic measurements, neurobehavioral test battery, grip strength, and anatomic pathology 
were examined. Organ weights and macroscopic and microscopic findings were also assessed.  
Two of 12 dams at 100 mg/kg were euthanized due to poor clinical condition secondary to 
diarrhoea, weight loss and dehydration. This was not considered test article-related as 
microscopic evaluation revealed crypt microabscesses throughout the large intestine that were 
consistent with bacterial infections common in cynomolgus monkeys. These infections were 
considered to have caused the moribundity. Stress during gestation and a generally weak 
condition after birth may have increased the susceptibility of these dams to infection. None of 
the other 10 high dose animal (100 mg/kg) showed comparable symptoms, nor the 12 low dose 
(10 mg/kg) animals. .  
In other animals there was no increase the incidence of prenatal loss or death, or stillbirth. No 
effects were seen in clinical signs, body weight, or food consumption and there was no 
macroscopic evidence of organ toxicity in dams. There were no test article-related effects on the 
number of infants born, clinical signs, and infant development. At the end of the study (Day 181 
postpartum), the survival rate of the infants was similar across all groups. There were no test 
article-related effects on infant clinical pathology and organ weights, and there was no 
macroscopic or microscopic test article-related organ toxicity. 
The NOAEL both maternally and for off-spring was considered to be > 100 mg/kg. 
 In all infants born to dams dosed at 100 mg/kg, vedolizumab was detected in the serum at 
concentrations of approximately 10-100 µg/ml on Day 28. 
Vedolizumab was detected at low levels on Day 28 postpartum in the breast milk in 3 /11 
animals at 100 mg/kg. Vedolizumab was not detected in the breast milk at 10 mg/kg. 
Vedolizumab was present at low levels in the serum of infants at both doses. On Day 28 
postpartum, vedolizumab was detected in 3/7 infants at 10 mg/kg and all infants at 100 mg/kg. 
On Day 120 postpartum, vedolizumab was detected at a low concentration in 1 infant at 100 
mg/kg. Amniotic fluid was not sampled; the presence of vedolizumab in infant serum is 
attributed to placental transfer, rather than as a result of ingestion of breast milk. 
Vedolizumab was immunogenic in some dams. In general, the PAHA had an effect on the TK and 
PD of vedolizumab, with the effect being most pronounced at 10 mg/kg. Pharmacodynamic 
results showed a high percentage of cells staining positive for bound Vedolizumab, and a low 
percentage of cells staining positive for free α4β7 sites through to Gestation Day 277. 
Entyvio 
Assessment report

Page 38/166 
 
  
A PAHA response existed in some infants at both doses. Positive titers were seen in 2/7 infants 
at 10 mg/kg and in 1/9 infants at 100 mg/kg. A PAHA response existed in the mother of these 
infants and it could not be determined whether the PAHA detected in infants was derived from 
the infant and/or mother. The PD response in infants whose mothers were dosed with 
vedolizumab tracked closely with the PD response in the mothers. On Day 28 postpartum, target 
saturation was noted in all infants at 100 mg/kg. On Day 120 postpartum, target saturation was 
noted in 3/9 infants at 100 mg/kg. On Day 181 postpartum, no target saturation was noted in 
any of the infants at 100 mg/kg. 
Studies in which the offspring (juvenile animals) are dosed and/or further evaluated  
Toxicology studies in juvenile animals have not been conducted. The Applicant argued that α4β7 
integrin does not play a role in mammalian growth and development (literature references have 
been provided) and that the developmental effects of inhibiting the α4β7 integrin can be studied 
sufficiently in mice with genetic ablation of the β7 integrin gene (Itgb7) as vedolizumab binds to 
the α4β7 integrin, but not to the α4β1 integrin. Homozygous null mice (mice with no functional 
α4β7integrin protein) are healthy and have a normal life span, thus confirming that α4β7 is not 
necessary for growth and development in the mouse. 
In addition vedolizumab did not affect prenatal and postnatal development in cynomolgus 
monkeys. In the 13-week study, all males (4/4) at 100 mg/kg were sexually immature at the 
termination of the study, while in the 26-week study, 3/4 males at 100 mg/kg were sexually 
immature at the end of the study. In both these repeat-dose toxicology studies, all females were 
sexually mature. The NOAEL was considered to be 100 mg/kg in both studies.  
Local Tolerance  
A GLP study was conducted to determine the local irritancy potential of Process C material when 
administered by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection to male New Zealand white rabbits. The 
incidence and severity of the macroscopic and microscopic observations were similar in animals 
given vedolizumab compared to controls.  
Immunotoxicity 
A repeat-dose study in cynomolgus monkeys was conducted to compare the potential 
immunotoxicity, TK, and PD of natalizumab (Lot 090324A) and vedolizumab (process C material) 
when given by IV infusion once weekly for 3 weeks. Vedolizumab elevated the level of gut-
homing memory T cells (α4β7 hi/CD4+/CD45RA-) in peripheral blood approximately 3-fold which 
was consistent with results from the 13 and 26 week toxicology studies. Natalizumab was 
immunogenic in all animals. Vedolizumab elicited a more selective pharmacodynamic effect. It 
did not affect levels of these relatively large leukocyte subpopulations in peripheral blood, but 
specifically elevated levels of gut-homing memory helper (CD4+/CD45RA-/ α4β7+) T 
lymphocytes. The data also demonstrated that natalizumab and vedolizumab did not inhibit the 
recall adaptive immune response to tetanus toxoid (TT) by recall IgM and IgG TDAR, 10 to 20 
days after challenge with TT. 
To determine if α4β7 blockade would interfere with T cell responses at sites other than the 
gastrointestinal tract, rhesus monkeys given Act-1 were challenged intradermally with TT in a 
model of cutaneous delayed type hyper-sensitivity.  Compared to controls those animals given 
Act-1 had no significant difference in CD3+ T cell or HAM-56+ monocyte/macrophage cell density 
Entyvio 
Assessment report

Page 39/166 
 
  
 
within the inflammatory foci. Anti-TT antibody titres were measured by enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for 29 days after challenge.  Compared to controls, Act-1 did not 
inhibit systemic humoral immunity, as both groups mounted comparable antitetanus antibody 
titres.  It was therefore concluded that blocking the α4β7 integrin did not affect the ability to 
mount adaptive immune responses in the skin. 
Other toxicity studies 
Microscopic examination of the injections sites were carried out as part of the GLP-repeat-dose 
toxicology studies in rabbits and monkeys. No test article related effects at the injection sites 
were observed. Process B material was used in these studies. Vedolizumab was well tolerated in 
patients with UC or CD when administered as a 30-minute IV infusion at weeks 0, 2, and 6, and 
then every 4 or 8 weeks at a dose of 300 mg. 
2.3.5 Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Vedolizumab is a sequence of amino acids and a protein and in accordance with the CHMP 
guideline on the environmental risk assessment (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) is exempted from 
testing because of the chemical structure. 
2.3.6 Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology  
The only pharmacology studies that used process C material (the proposed clinical material) 
were the studies that investigated effects on activity of Treg cells and T lymphocyte proliferation. 
No other studies (binding specificity or selectivity) were conducted with process C material.  
However, a GLP-compliant single dose study in monkeys was conducted using material form both 
processes B and C and this showed similar pharmacodynamics and toxicokinetic profiles; in 
addition, a 3 week immunotoxicity study has been conducted in monkeys with process C material 
and there are clinical data with process C material. The Applicant was asked to provide more 
information on the comparability of vedolizumab made by processes B and C (used in clinical 
trials). The applicant did not provide any in vitro pharmacodynamics characterisation in support 
of the comparability but relied on a claim that material from each process was tested in humans 
and were shown to be equivalent (clinical trial C13009 in healthy subjects). This was accepted by 
the CHMP. 
The Applicant demonstrated that vedolizumab selectively binds to the α4β7 integrin and that the 
functional activity of the α4β7 integrin occurs by inhibition of adhesion to MAdCAM-1 and 
fibronectin. The Applicant discussed the functions of MAdCAM-1 and fibronectin and the 
implications of blocking interactions between these molecules and α4β7. Some studies show that 
the expression of MAdCAM-1 is necessary but not sufficient for mediating physiological effects 
within a tissue (i.e. the brain in the EAE model). However, some non-clinical and clinical evidence 
accounts for a localised activity of vedolizumab in inhibiting the immune response in the 
gastrointestinal tract. Moreover, α4β7 seems not to be required for mediating fibronectin 
physiological function (i.e. biological redundancy of integrins and widespread distribution of 
Entyvio 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/676643/2013 
Page 40/166 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
fibronectin). Thus, these data are in support of the selective action of vedolizumab on the 
gastrointestinal tract. However, no information is available on whether this pattern remains 
unchanged under conditions in the disease state.  
In support of the claimed binding specificity of vedolizumab to gut homing α4β7high helper T 
lymphocytes, the Applicant referred to data on eosinophils expressing low levels of α4β7 in the 
peripheral blood of CD patients (study C13007) as well as in the placebo group showing that 
mean values remained unchanged from baseline and following vedolizumab treatment.  
The issue on the potential effect of vedolizumab on Treg in patients was considered important in 
light of the role of Treg cells in the inflamed lamina propria in patients where they are expected 
to be higher than in the peripheral blood, as well as in healthy subjects. The only available 
results on vedolizumab binding to Treg cells and their function are in healthy subjects showing 
that vedolizumab bound to about 10% of these cells and did not affect the suppressive activity of 
α4β7-expressing Treg cells. From this evidence, it could be inferred that Treg function in 
patients’ gut mucosa is not affected.  
When bound to α4β7, vedolizumab is internalised by a mechanism consistent with antibody-
mediated capping. Human memory T lymphocytes remain viable upon removing vedolizumab.  
The Applicant’s discussion of the modifications of α4β7 integrin following binding of vedolizumab 
is adequate.   
In cross-reactivity studies rabbits and rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys were shown to be 
pharmacologically appropriate species to use when testing vedolizumab. No unanticipated cross-
reactivity or off-target staining was noted in each of monkey and human tissues. Binding of 
vedolizumab in these studies was consistent with the expected patterns of α4β7 integrin 
expression. 
As part of the evaluation of vedolizumab in the context of other integrin antagonists and 
unwanted effects (such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, PML), a study was 
conducted to determine if specific blockade of the α4β7 integrin with vedolizumab would affect 
immune surveillance and inflammation of the central nervous system in monkeys with 
experimentally induced autoimmune encephalomyelitis, in comparison with the effect of the dual 
α4β1/α4β7 antagonist natalizumab. Monkeys were given IV weekly doses of 30 mg/kg 
vedolizumab, which did not inhibit clinical symptoms, leukocytic infiltration of cerebrospinal fluid, 
cerebral inflammation or demyelination, or affect levels of leukocytes, lymphocytes, and 
monocytes. These results showed that vedolizumab had no effect on immune surveillance in this 
experimental system.  
The Applicant was asked to discuss further the risk of inducing PML by use of vedolizumab, with 
consideration for the possibility that an immunocompromised status in patients with 
inflammatory bowel disease could contribute to PML. The Applicant further discussed results from 
the publication provided with the initial MAA (Haanstra et al. 2013) and provided a 
comprehensive discussion of the known mechanisms involved in PML occurrence. Results 
reported by the Applicant suggested that vedolizumab did not block migration of leukocytes into 
the brain. As to whether this risk is different in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, the 
Applicant cited in support, data from clinical studies in which no sign of inhibition of CNS immune 
surveillance or of PML were associated to vedolizumab in patients with inflammatory bowel 
disease. On the basis of the limited safety data collected so far, although the risk of PML

associated with vedolizumab cannot be completely ruled out, from a mechanistic point of view it 
is suggested that vedolizumab could have a lower risk than natalizumab for developing PML. Of 
note, PML risk is considered a potential risk as described in the RMP and will be monitored in the 
post marketing setting. 
The data provided by the applicant showed that the action of vedolizumab does not involve CDC. 
The potential for vedolizumab to induce antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) of RPMI8866 
cells that express α4β7 was examined in vitro. The CHMP concluded that the action of 
vedolizumab does not involve ADCC.  
Vedolizumab did not activate leukocytes in vitro. Incubation of human whole blood with 
vedolizumab at 400 μg/ml did not induce release of cytokines or affect expression of cell surface 
markers of T lymphocyte activation. In contrast, positive controls did induce cytokine release and 
increase expression of cell activation markers on T lymphocytes. Vedolizumab appears to lack 
agonist activity. 
The effects of vedolizumab on the gastrointestinal, urinary, pulmonary and central nervous 
systems were evaluated for functional and structural changes in GLP-compliant repeat-dose 
toxicology studies of up to 26 weeks in pharmacologically responsive species. This is acceptable 
to the CHMP. Vedolizumab did not cause adverse functional or structural effects in the 
gastrointestinal, urinary, pulmonary or central nervous systems at 100 mg/kg in monkeys, a 
dose associated with a mean Cmax of 5260 µg/ml, ~46-fold the mean human Cmax (115 µg/ml) 
after a single 300 mg 30 minute IV infusion.  
Pharmacokinetics 
Vedolizumab had low serum clearance and serum apparent volume of distribution at steady-state 
was moderately greater than the serum volume. Therefore distribution is expected to be limited. 
The terminal t 1/2 was long (336 to 362 hours) and vedolizumab exhibited a generally linear PK 
over the dose range of 10 to 100 mg/kg in rabbits and monkeys. These data are in-line with 
other antibodies.  
The immunogenicity of vedolizumab was assessed by measuring rabbit and primate antihuman 
antibodies (RAHA and PAHA). RAHA/PAHA had a neutralising effect on the PK and PD of 
vedolizumab in some of the animals at the low and mid doses (10 and 30 mg/kg), but 
continuous α4β7 saturation was achieved in animals that did not develop a neutralising 
RAHA/PAHA effect. At the highest dose (100 mg/kg), RAHA/PAHA had little effect on the 
pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. At this dose (the no observed adverse effect level 
(NOAEL)), continuous saturation of the target, α4β7, was maintained throughout the dosing and 
recovery phases in nearly all of the animals in the repeat-dose toxicology studies.  
Vedolizumab was excreted at low levels for 28 days postpartum in the breast milk of cynomolgus 
monkeys given 100 mg/kg vedolizumab during gestation. Vedolizumab was found to be present 
at low levels in the serum of infants whose mothers were dosed with vedolizumab during the 
gestation period.  However, the presence of vedolizumab in infant serum is mainly attributed to 
placental transfer, rather than as a result of ingestion of breast milk. 
Processes B and C showed similar serum Cmax, AUC0-168hr, and TK profiles after a 10 and 30 
mg/kg intravenous infusion of vedolizumab was given to cynomolgus monkeys.

Toxicology 
13 and 26 week studies were conducted in which cynomolgus monkeys were given i.v. doses of 
10, 30 or 100 mg/kg vedolizumab every 2 weeks. In the 13 week study there were no in-life 
behavioural effects or effects on body weight, food consumption, ophthalmology, ECG, clinical 
pathology, urinalysis, immunological assessments, organ weights, and microscopic data. An 
increased number of Balantidium protozoa were noted in the cecum and colon of 1 and 2 females 
at 30 and 100 mg/kg, respectively. As predose Balantidium levels in the cecum and colon were 
unknown, the significance of this finding was uncertain. The Applicant stated that the possibility 
of a test article-related effect upon intestinal flora cannot be ruled out. It is likely that this was 
not test article-related; however given that vedolizumab is targeting the gut, a test article-
related effect upon intestinal flora cannot be ruled out.  
Vedolizumab modulates intestinal immunity by inhibiting lymphocyte trafficking into the 
gastrointestinal tract. Potential effects on gastrointestinal immune response and the risk of 
enteric infections associated with vedolizumab administration were evaluated in the clinical 
development program. Opportunistic infections are a potential risk as described in the risk 
management plan. 
In the 26 week study there were no in-life behavioural effects and there were no test article-
related changes on food consumption, electrocardiology, ophthalmology, clinical pathology, 
cerebrospinal fluid evaluations, organ weights or macroscopic findings. Microscopic findings 
consisted of minimal to mild lymphoid depletion in the Peyer’s patches of the gastrointestinal 
tract in males at all doses and increased epithelial regeneration in stomachs of both sexes, with 
lymphoplasmacytic gastritis at all doses. The Applicant stated that an effect on Peyer’s patches is 
consistent with the role of α4β7 in mediating lymphocyte trafficking into this secondary lymphoid 
organ. After an approximately 12-week dose-free period, lymphoid depletion in the Peyer’s 
patches of the gastrointestinal tract was only noted in 1/4 animals at 100 mg/kg (a female). 
Once again vedolizumab was immunogenic in most animals. In general, PAHA had an effect on 
the TK and PD which was most pronounced at 10 mg/kg. The NOAEL was considered to be ≤100 
mg/kg. 
A 13 week rabbits study was conducted in which animals were given 30 or 100 mg/kg 
vedolizumab once every 2 weeks.  
Two of the 20 animals exposed to vedolizumab were found dead at 30 and 100 mg/kg. The 
cause of death for these animals was not determined from the microscopic examination. Clinical 
pathology changes consisted of increased urea nitrogen (BUN) and AST and decreased lower red 
cells, haemoglobin, haematocrit, and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and 
higher mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) compared to 
values at predose in these animals. Similar clinical pathology changes were not seen in animals 
that survived until the end of the in-life phase.  
These effects were also not seen in the embryofetal developmental toxicity study in rabbits. 
Those animals that were killed at the end of the scheduled in-life period showed increased 
globulin and total protein, reduced albumin-to-globulin (A:G) ratio; increased mean absolute and 
percent lymphocytes, resulting in increased mean total white cell counts.

Small lymphoid follicles (a decrease in the size) of the submucosal lymphoid nodules (Peyer’s 
patches) of the sacculus rotundus and increased mean absolute and relative spleen weights that 
correlated with lymphoid hyperplasia and increased amyloidosis of the periarteriolar lymphoid 
sheaths (PALS) of the spleen were noted at 30 and 100 mg/kg.  
The effect of small lymphoid follicles was reversible (still observed in 1 male at 100mg/kg male). 
The increased globulin, decreased A:G ratio, increased mean absolute and relative spleen 
weights, and splenic lymphoid hyperplasia (M&F), and increased amyloidosis in males were seen 
at the end of the recovery period at 100 mg/kg. 
The Applicant stated that in those animals that were euthanized at the end of the in-life phase, 
haematological and histological effects were consistent with the mechanism of action of 
vedolizumab (inhibition of α4β7, resulting in retention of α4β7+ leukocytes within the 
vasculature). Higher spleen weights were correlated with lymphoid hyperplasia and increased 
amyloidosis of the periarteriolar lymphoid sheaths (PALS) of the spleen. Similar observations 
have been made in other species, such as mice, with elevated serum amyloid protein A. Infusion 
of non-human species with a humanised antibody results in recognition of non-self protein by the 
animal’s immune system. Lymphoid hyperplasia was attributed to this immunogenicity. The 
splenic effects were also attributed to this immunogenicity and not to antagonism of the 
α4β7integrin, and were therefore not considered adverse by the Applicant. This was accepted by 
the CHMP. 
The Applicant stated that the minimal to mild lymphoid depletion in Peyer’s patches and an 
analogous decrease in leukocytes expressing the β7 integrin in crypt epithelium noted 
represented a pharmacological effect of vedolizumab (decreased trafficking of peripheral 
lymphocytes to the gut); however, there was no evidence of systemic immunosuppression, 
consistent with pharmacological antagonism of the α4β7/MAdCAM-1 pathway. 
Vedolizumab was immunogenic in most animals. RAHA affected the TK and PD, with the effect 
being most pronounced at 30 mg/kg. Vedolizumab was still detected in each animal at the end of 
this recovery period. The Applicant therefore defined the NOAEL as 100 mg/kg for this study. 
Reproductive toxicology  
No specific studies of fertility and early embryonic development have been conducted. A GLP-
compliant study was conducted in rabbits to evaluate potential for embryofetal toxicity.  
The vehicle control (sterile saline, USP) or vedolizumab (10, 30 or 100 mg/mL) was administered 
as an intravenous infusion to 4 groups of 25 time-mated female New Zealand White rabbits on 
Gestation Day 7. For the TK, RAHA and PD evaluations, an additional 3 rabbits/group were 
administered the vehicle or test article on a comparable regimen as main study rabbits. The 
exposure to vedolizumab showed trends towards increasing in a greater than dose-proportional 
manner. At 100 mg/kg (the highest dose examined), saturation of binding to α4β7 sites was 
achieved throughout the study period. Immunogenicity in the 10 mg/kg group was greater than 
those in the higher dose groups and the PD effects appeared to be broadly similar at doses with 
no immunogenic response. 
All females survived to the scheduled laparohysterectomy. There were no test article-related 
clinical findings at any dose level. Slightly lower mean maternal body weight gains and food

Assessment report

consumption were noted in the 100 mg/kg group immediately following infusion (Gestation Day 
7 to 8) and when the entire period of major organogenesis (Gestation Days 7 to 20) was 
evaluated. However, a slight compensatory increase in mean body weight gain was noted in this 
group during Gestation Days 20 to 29, when test article exposure would have been minimal at 
best (previous toxicokinetic data indicates test article exposure is maintained for at least 2 
weeks). There were no test article-related effects on maternal net body weight, net body weight 
gain, or gravid uterine weight, and intrauterine growth and survival were unaffected at all dose 
levels. 
Based on the lack of maternal and embryo/fetal effects and no significant effects on mean 
maternal body weight gain and food consumption during the period of major organogenesis, the 
NOAEL for maternal toxicity and embryofetal developmental was considered to be greater than 
or equal to 100 mg/kg, the highest dose investigated.  
In this study there were a number of findings that were not discussed in the final summary 
reports. 1) Malaligned sternebrae were observed in 3 fetuses at 100 mg/kg and in 1 fetus at 30 
mg/kg (not seen in controls). The mean litter proportion of malaligned sternebrae at 100 mg/kg 
(1.9% per litter) was outside the range of the historical control data (0.0% to 1.1% per litter). 
The Applicant noted that slightly malaligned sternebrae without other indications of 
developmental toxicity is not a test article-related effect. 2) 13th full rib. A dose related increase 
in 13th full rib variation was also seen. 3) Spherical enlargement of the rib was noted at 30 and 
100 mg/kg (none in control). Taken together, these effects could be indicative of an effect on the 
axial skeleton. In response, the Applicant summarised evidence to the effect that the frequency 
observed is not higher than historical controls and that consequently, there is no indication that 
these effects were caused by vedolizumab on sternebrae. This was accepted by the CHMP.  
Prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function was examined in pregnant 
female cynomolgus monkeys. Two (2) of 12 dams at 100 mg/kg were euthanized due to poor 
clinical condition that was consistent with bacterial infections common in cynomolgus monkeys 
throughout the large intestine that were consistent with bacterial infections. No other high dose 
animal (100 mg/kg) showed comparable symptoms. Despite the final summary's stating that 
both animals delivered healthy infants, the final study report states that the infant of one of the 
dams that was euthanized early was also euthanized due to poor clinical condition along with its 
mother on Day 34 post-partum. The poor clinical condition of the infant was considered related 
to poor condition of the mother and was not considered test article-related. Histopathological 
evaluation of this male infant showed mucosal atrophy in parts of the intestine; in the ileum it 
was accompanied by lymphoid atrophy of the Peyer’s patches and villous atrophy. Additional 
findings were moderate atrophy in the bone marrow of the sternum, spleen, and thymus. The tail 
had an area of marked necrosis and a severe ulceration. The atrophy of the lymphatic system 
was considered due to the poor condition of the infant secondary to insufficient nutrition and was 
not considered test article-related. While it can be accepted that most of the findings noted in 
this infant were not test article-related and probably due to insufficient nutrition and the poor 
condition of the dam, mucosal atrophy in parts of the intestine that was accompanied in the 
ileum by lymphoid atrophy of the Peyer’s patches was noted. Based on the data provided by the 
applicant, the CHMP concluded that due to the excessive pathology present in this animal, the 
evidence was too weak to associate causally with vedolizumab. This was also the conclusion for a 
finding that lymphoid depletion was observed not to be completely reversed in animals allowed a 
Entyvio

12 week recovery period. As these monkeys did not show any signs of infection, this issue was 
considered by the CHMP as not to be of clinical relevance.  
Concerning fertility, the 26 week general toxicity study in monkeys given vedolizumab is judged 
insufficient to conclude an absence of an effect, although an effect on male fertility is unlikely. 
However as no definitive conclusion can be drawn on the male reproductive organs in the 
cynomolgus monkey repeat dose general toxicity study the following wording has been included 
in the SmPC: “‘No specific fertility studies in animals have been performed with vedolizumab. No 
definitive conclusion can be drawn on the male reproductive organs in the cynomolgus monkey 
repeat dose general toxicity study, but given the lack of binding of vedolizumab to male 
reproductive tissues from monkeys and humans and the intact male fertility in β7 integrin-
knockout mice, it is not expected that vedolizumab will affect male fertility”.  
In relation to the risk of cancer, there were instances where monkeys showed lymphoplasmacytic 
gastritis and epithelial regeneration. The data provided by the applicant showed that these are 
common findings in control monkeys and such findings are not seen in β7 knockout mice 
indicating that their occurrence is unlikely to be linked to vedolizumab. This was accepted by the 
CHMP. The incidence of certain malignancies, in particular lymphoma and colorectal cancer, may, 
in theory, increase in patients on long-term immunosuppressive therapies, particularly those 
which target cell-mediated immunity. Patients with prior exposure to immunosuppressants or 
immunomodulators (e.g., TNFα antagonists, natalizumab) may be at a greater risk for 
developing certain malignancies. This potential risk is addressed in the product information and 
the RMP. 
2.3.7 Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The Applicant demonstrated that vedolizumab selectively binds to the α4β7 integrin and that the 
functional activity of the α4β7 integrin occurs by inhibition of adhesion to MAdCAM-1 and 
fibronectin. Although vedolizumab pharmacodynamics characterisation was only performed in 
human peripheral blood from healthy subjects, its gut selective action is sufficiently supported by 
efficacy and safety clinical results in the target population. 
The murine precursor of vedolizumab proved to alleviate gastrointestinal inflammation in a non-
human primate model of ulcerative colitis (colitic cotton top tamarins). 
Reassuring data on non-human primates with experimentally induced autoimmune 
encephalomyelitis (but not suffering from inflammatory bowel disease) showed that vedolizumab 
does not compromise the central nervous system immunosurveillance. However this does not 
allow to completely ruling out a risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) 
associated to vedolizumab. The PML risk is considered a potential risk as described in the RMP 
and will be monitored in the post marketing setting. 
Pharmacokinetic data were consistent with expectations for a humanised monoclonal antibody 
given to animals. The general toxicity studies were acceptable to support registration of the 
product.  
No specific fertility studies in animals have been performed with vedolizumab. No definitive 
conclusion can be drawn on the male reproductive organs in cynomolgus monkey repeated dose 
toxicity study, but given the lack of binding of vedolizumab to male reproductive tissue in 
Entyvio 
Assessment report

monkey and human, and the intact male fertility observed in β7 integrin-knockout mice, it is not 
expected that vedolizumab will affect male fertility.  
Vedolizumab did not cause developmental toxicity in pregnant animals.

2.4.2 Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
Bioavailability 
VDZ is administered intravenously. 
During clinical development, a phase 1 study (Study C13010) was performed to determine 
vedolizumab bioavailability when administered SC and IM, relative to IV administration. The 
study was composed of 3 dosing cohort. Subjects received a single dose of 180 mg vedolizumab 
(~ 4 mg/kg) as an SC injection, IM injection, or IV infusion (over 30 minutes). 
Forty-two subjects were planned for the study, and a total of 42 subjects were enrolled (14 per 
dosing cohort). 
Blood specimens for the determination of serum vedolizumab concentrations were obtained as 
follows: 5 minutes after then end of infusion (IV group only), and 6, 24, 72, 120 (except for the 
IV group), 168, 336, 672, 1008, 1512, 2016, 2520, and 3024 hours after start of 
infusion/injection 
Following IM and SC administration, vedolizumab, achieves maximum concentration at 5-7 days 
post injection. The Cmax following IM and SC injection was approximately 1/3 of the Cmax 
following 30-minute IV infusion. There was no difference in the terminal elimination profile of IM 
and SC cohorts compared to the IV cohort, indicating that the elimination of vedolizumab is not 
absorption rate-limited.

of test to reference (e.g., SC vs. IV infusion and IM vs. IV infusion) and the associated 80% CI 
are presented in the table reported below. 
Bioequivalence  
Study C13009 was conducted to evaluate the PK, PD, safety, and tolerability of Process C 
vedolizumab. This study also evaluated the relative bioavailability of Process C vedolizumab 
compared to Process B vedolizumab. An overview of the study design is presented in Table 16.

Table 20 Summary of Vedolizumab Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Intravenous 
Infusions (C13001) 
Elimination 
Metabolism 
Vedolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody and the primary routes of elimination are likely 
to be proteolytic degradation, similar to that of physiological immunoglobulins, and receptor-
mediated clearance. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality 
Single-dose PK data following IV administration are available over a dose range of 0.2 to 10 
mg/kg and 180 to 750 mg vedolizumab. Maximum vedolizumab serum concentrations were 
achieved at or near the end of infusion and declined in a bi-exponential manner. Concentration-
time profiles showed some evidence of nonlinearity once concentrations reached approximately 1 
to 10 ug/mL, suggesting clearance may increase at low concentrations.  
Dose proportionality was evaluated in C13001 as dose-normalized AUC0-inf versus dose. 
The dose normalized AUC0-inf increased with increasing dose until 2.0 mg/kg, as shown in 
Figure 5, indicating non-proportionality in PK over the lower dose range (0.2-2.0 mg/kg). From 
2.0 to 10.0 mg/kg, however, no further increases in dose-normalized AUC0-inf were observed

Figure 5 Mean (± Standard Deviation) Dose-Normalized AUC0-inf by Dose Cohort 
(Study C13001) 
Similarly, estimates of clearance, volume of distribution, and terminal half-life were dose 
dependent over the dose range 0.2 to 2.0 mg/kg. As dose increased, clearance was reduced, 
distribution volume increased, and consequently, the terminal half-life was prolonged. From 2.0 
to 10.0 mg/kg, however, there was no apparent change in these parameters, which suggests a 
saturation of a rapid elimination process for vedolizumab at low concentrations. Slower linear 
elimination processes likely account for a large fraction of clearance of vedolizumab at higher 
doses. 
The only study to investigate more than 1 fixed dose of vedolizumab was Study C13009, which 
included 300 mg and 600 mg vedolizumab. In this study, Cmax and AUC0-inf increased 
proportionally to dose (Table 21), while clearance and volume parameters appeared to be dose 
independent over this dose range.  
Table 21 Summary of Single-Dose Pharmacokinetic Parameters Across the 180- to 750-
mg Vedolizumab Dose Range () 
Study C13010 investigated 180 mg vedolizumab, and the clearance and volume parameters 
were similar to those in C13009 at 300 and 600 mg. This apparent linear PK at doses of 180 mg

(equivalent to 2.4 mg/kg in a 75-kg person) and above is consistent with the data from the 
studies with mg/kg dosing. 
Time dependency 
Repeat-dose PK data following IV administration are available over a dose range of 0.5 to 10.0 
mg/kg from studies in patients with UC and CD, including Studies C13002, M200-021, M200-
022, and L299-016. 
Study C13002 was a Phase 2, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind Study to 
Determine the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of MLN0002 
Following Multiple Intravenous Doses in Patients with Ulcerative Colitis. Process B vedolizumab 
was used in the study.  
Among the main objectives this study was also designed to define the multiple-dose PK of 
MLN0002 for a range of IV doses in subjects with UC. 
Approximately 45 subjects were to be enrolled in 1 of 3 cohorts (2.0, 6.0, and 10.0 mg/kg) and 
randomized in a 4:1 ratio of MLN0002 to placebo. Subjects were to receive 4 doses of study drug 
on Days 1, 15, 29, and 85 and were to be followed until Day 253. 
PK samples (Standard PK Sampling Schedule) were collected on Day 1 (prior to and 2 and 12 
hours after dosing) and on Day 2 (24 hours after dosing), Day 3 (48 hours after dosing), Day 4 
(72 hours after dosing), Day 8 (at any time), Days 15 and 29 (prior to and 2 hours after dosing), 
Days 43, 57, 71 (at any time), Day 85 (prior to and 2 and 12 hours after dosing), Day 86 (24 
hours after dosing), Day 87 (48 hours after dosing), Day 89 (96 hours after dosing), and at any 
time on Days 92, 99, 113, 127, 141, 155, 169, 183, 197, 211, 225, 239, and 253. 
Pharmacokinetics results 
The PK parameters of vedolizumab following a 30-minute IV infusion of 2.0 to 10.0 mg/kg 
MLN0002 by dose cohort are summarized in the following Table: 
Entyvio 
Assessment report

Pharmacokinetic parameters were generally consistent for Day 1 and Day 85.  
Cmax increased with increasing dose in a linear manner on both Day 1 and Day 85.  
The Cmax on Day 85 was approximately 1.0-fold to 1.2-fold higher than the Day 1 Cmax across 
all dose cohorts.  
AUC (following first dose and the fourth dose) increased with increasing dose in a linear manner. 
Comparing between Day 1 and Day 85, the AUC for the 14-day post dose interval (AUCDay0-14 
and AUC Day85-99) was approximately 1.3-fold to 1.5-fold higher across all dose cohorts, indicating 
that that the 8-week interval between the Day 29 dose and the Day 85 dose was sufficiently long 
to allow for almost complete elimination of vedolizumab from the serum prior to the dosing on 
Day 85. 
MLN0002 concentrations achieved following dosing on Day 85 were similar to those following 
dosing on Day 1. The mean elimination half-life was approximately 15 to 20 days across the dose 
range tested.  
Two subjects developed persistent HAHA positivity in this study. In 1 of these subjects, a faster 
clearance of vedolizumab and loss of α4β7 receptor saturation was observed as compared to the 
HAHA-negative subjects in the respective dose level. 
Special populations 
Impaired hepatic function 
There were no specific PK studies performed in those with hepatic disease and the pivotal trials 
excluded those with AST ALT or alkaline phosphatase levels that were >3 x ULN.

Weight 
Body weight-adjusted dosing was used in a total of 10 clinical studies, primarily during early 
clinical development (L297-005, L297-006, L297-007, L299-016, M200-021, M200- 022, 
C13001, C13002, C13004, and C13005). Single and multiple doses ranging from 0.15 to 10.0 
mg/kg were investigated 
The change from body weight-adjusted dosing to fixed dosing of vedolizumab was made 
following Study C13005, which investigated the PK of vedolizumab administered at a dose of 6 
mg/kg in healthy subjects across predefined ranges of low and high body weights. In addition, 
population PK analyses were conducted to assess the importance of weight as a predictor of 
vedolizumab PK. Fixed doses of vedolizumab were used in all subsequent studies including 4 
phase 1 studies (C13009, C13010, C13012, and C13013) and all 4 phase 3 studies (C13006, 
C13007, C13008, and C13011). 
Study C13005: Single Intravenous Dose in Subjects With Low and High Body Weight (Process B) 
Table 23 Summary of Vedolizumab Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Intravenous 
Infusion  
Weight-adjusted dosing of vedolizumab resulted in a higher mean Cmax and mean AUC0-inf in 
heavier subjects compared to subjects with low body weight. Both weight-normalized CL and Vz 
were lower in the high body weight cohort than in the low body weight cohort. After 
normalization by body surface area (BSA), both CL and Vz were similar between the 2 cohorts; 
hence, there was no notable difference in BSA-normalized exposure (AUC0-inf/BSA) by body 
weight. 
The PK findings suggest that weight-adjusted dosing does not provide similar exposure of 
vedolizumab to subjects of varying body size. 
Exposure relevant for safety evaluation 
Finally, once data from phase 3 studies were available, a population PK model was developed 
from pooled data from phase 1, 2, and 3 studies to assess the effects of patient demographic 
characteristics and other covariates on vedolizumab PK and to characterize the PK-PD 
relationships.

No dedicated clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of immunomodulators that 
can affect or be affected by vedolizumab during co-administration. Concomitant 
immunomodulator therapies were tested using a population PK approach. The effect of 
concomitant therapy on vedolizumab Clearance (CLL) was not considered to be clinically 
meaningful based on covariate effect sizes of less than ± 25% from the typical reference 
population value when evaluated across a representative range of covariate values and 
categories in the dataset. The effects of the concomitant administration of immunomodulators on 
CLL are illustrated in Figure 6.

2.4.3 Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The α4β7 integrin is expressed on the surface of a discrete subset of T lymphocytes that 
preferentially migrate into the GI tract and cause inflammation that is characteristic of UC and 
CD. Vedolizumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds exclusively to the α4β7 
integrin and inhibits adhesion of these cells to mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 
(MAdCAM-1), but not vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). Disruption of this interaction 
prevents transmigration of T lymphocytes across the endothelium into inflamed parenchymal 
tissue. Vedolizumab also blocks α4β7-mediated cell binding to an alternatively spliced domain of 
fibronectin, connecting segment-1 (CS-1) in vitro, which is a component of extracellular matrix. 
Vedolizumab does not bind to, nor inhibit function of, the α4β1 and αΕβ7 integrins. Specifically 
inhibiting the α4β7/MAdCAM-pathway alleviates GI inflammation, without impairing immune 
surveillance of the central nervous system (CNS), nor inhibition of systemic immune responses.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
Integrins are obligate heterodimers consisting of 2 distinct chains, designated the α and β 
subunits, of which 24 distinct types have been identified to date. This large variety of 
heterodimers reflects the distinct functional roles of various integrins in cellular physiology. 
T cells express several integrin family members that are involved in activation, trafficking, and 
retention in tissue 
The α4β7 integrin is expressed by discrete subpopulations of memory T lymphocytes. α4β7 
mediates the migration of these cells selectively into the GI tract by binding to MAdCAM-1 on the 
vascular lumen. 
Human Tissues and Cells Targeted by MLN0002 
Tissue cross-reactivity studies of Act-1 and MLN0002 were consistent with the known pattern of 
α4β7 expression. The data demonstrated that the primary pharmacologic target of MLN0002 is 
subpopulations of leukocytes. 
Human Leukocytes Bound by MLN0002 
The expression profile of the α4β7 integrin in human whole blood was investigated to identify 
specific leukocyte subtypes whose function could be potentially inhibited by MLN0002 and 
conversely, leukocytes whose function could not be directly inhibited by MLN0002. The 
expression pattern of α4β7 was found to be more restricted than the expression pattern of α4β1 
in human whole blood. For example, substantially lower percentages of monocytes and 
lymphocytes expressed α4β7 than α4β1 (Table 24). 
Table 24 Percentages of Various Cell Types Expressing Alpha 4 Beta 1 and Alpha 4 Beta 
7 
Consequently, there are large subpopulations of lymphocytes within human whole blood that 
express the α4β1 integrin but not α4β7 (Table 25).

Table 25 Percentages of Various Lymphocyte Subpopulations Expressing Alpha 4 Beta 
1 and Alpha 4 Beta 7 
The converse is also true, particularly for memory T lymphocytes. The α4β1 and α4β7 integrins 
are expressed in a reciprocal manner by memory T lymphocytes. The α4β1 and α4β7 integrins 
were not co-expressed by subpopulations of human memory helper and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, 
indicating that discrete populations exist in vivo. The expression pattern of the α4β7 integrin in 
these subpopulations was inversely related to β1 expression levels (Table 26). 
Table 26 Percentages of Subpopulations of Helper and Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes 
Expressing Alpha 4 Beta 1 and Alpha 4 Beta 7 
The data illustrate that discrete subpopulations of human leukocytes, expressing either the α4β1 
or the α4β7 integrin, exist in vivo. The implications of these data are that the α4β7 integrin-
specific antagonist MLN0002 targets a smaller population of leukocytes than the population 
targeted by dual α4β1 and α4β7 integrin-specific antagonists. This limited scope of targeted cells 
is likely a primary determinant of the gut-selective pharmacologic profile of MLN0002. 
Study C13012 was a phase 1, single-arm study to evaluate the effects of vedolizumab on the 
CD4+:CD8+ lymphocyte ratio in the CSF of healthy subjects.  
The primary objective was: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
to evaluate the change in CSF CD4+:CD8+ lymphocyte ratio before and after a single 450-
mg intravenous (IV) dose of vedolizumab. 
The secondary objectives were: 
To determine if reversal of the normal CSF CD4+:CD8+ lymphocyte ratio to < 1 occurs after 
a single 450-mg IV dose of vedolizumab 
To assess the safety and tolerability of a single 450-mg IV dose of vedolizumab

All subjects received a single dose of 450 mg vedolizumab as an IV infusion over 30 minutes.  
CSF was obtained by lumbar puncture (LP) before and 5 weeks after dosing. Peripheral blood 
samples for serum vedolizumab concentrations and PD markers were obtained to confirm 
vedolizumab exposure and α4β7 binding saturation, respectively. Vedolizumab concentration was 
also analyzed in the post-dose CSF sample. Peripheral blood CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes were 
measured in parallel with CSF samples before and after dosing to determine if changes in 
peripheral blood may have affected lymphocyte counts in the CSF. Testing for HAHA to 
vedolizumab was also conducted. 
Effect on CD4+:CD8+ Ratio in Cerebrospinal Fluid 
Results for the 2 key study endpoints in the CD4+:CD8+ evaluable population are presented in 
the table reported below. 
For the primary endpoint, change from baseline in the CSF CD4+:CD8+ ratio, the results showed 
essentially no change in the mean CD4+:CD8+ lymphocyte ratio before and after vedolizumab 
dosing (mean of 3.59 and 3.61, respectively). The mean of the difference in ratios before and 
after vedolizumab dosing was 0.013 (90% confidence intervals [CI]: -0.337, 0.363). 
For the secondary endpoint, the p-value (p <0.001, 1-sided, 1-sample t-test) was highly 
significant, showing that the CD4+:CD8+ ratio after vedolizumab dosing is not less than 1. 
Similar results were observed in the CD4+:CD8+ evaluable population with Week-16 
assessments and in the safety population. 
Effect on CD4+ and CD8+ Cells in Cerebrospinal Fluid 
There were no significant mean or mean percentage changes from baseline in either absolute cell 
counts or percentage of cells for CSF CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes in the CD4+:CD8+ evaluable 
population (see Table below). The 95% CI for the differences between baseline and Week 5 
included zero for both cell populations. The mean change in percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ cells 
in the CSF after a single dose of vedolizumab was <1%.

Baseline changes for percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes at both baseline and Week 5 
are consistent with published data from studies of healthy subjects. 
Similar results were observed for the CD4+:CD8+ evaluable population with Week-16 
assessments and the safety population. 
Secondary pharmacology 
MLN0002 was engineered to contain 2 amino acid changes (Leu239 and Gly241 to Ala) in the FcR 
binding region of the heavychain in order to eliminate competent binding mechanism chain. The 
potential CDC activity of MLN0002 was compared in vitro in human peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMCs) to that of OKT3. No cytotoxicity was observed in the presence of MLN0002 or IgG1 
isotype control at concentrations as high as 10 µg/mL, a concentration that was approximately 
20-fold greater than that needed to achieve saturation binding of MLN0002 to human whole 
blood cells. In contrast, OKT3 induced CDC in PBMCs in a dose-dependent manner. These results 
suggest that the in vivo activity of MLN0002 does not involve CDC. 
Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) is another common Fc-mediated cytotoxic 
mechanism of action for therapeutic mAbs, such as the anti-CD20 mAb rituximab, in vivo. The Fc 
portion of MLN0002 was also engineered to eliminate binding to FcRs. The potential ADCC 
activity of MLN0002 in vitro in RPMI8866 cells, which express high levels of the α4β7 integrin and 
CD20, was compared to that of rituximab in vitro. No ADCC was observed in the presence of 
MLN0002 or IgG1 isotype control at concentrations as high as 10 µg/mL, a concentration which 
was approximately 100-fold greater than that needed to achieve saturation binding of MLN0002 
to RPMI8866. In contrast, rituximab induced ADCC in RPMI8866 cells in a dose-dependent 
manner. These results suggest that the in vivo activity of MLN0002 does not involve ADCC. 
Binding of vedolizumab to leukocytes in human whole blood in vitro did not elicit cytokine 
production, including γ-interferon, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, IL-
4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 (P70), IL-17, IL-12 (P40), and IL-23 proteins. Complement-dependent 
cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) are common Fc-
mediated cytotoxic mechanisms for mAbs in vivo. No CDC or ADCC was observed in vitro with 
vedolizumab at concentrations as high as 10 μg/mL. The effect of vedolizumab on human 
regulatory T (Treg)-cells has also been studied in human peripheral blood in vitro, and the data 
suggest that vedolizumab does not inhibit the suppressive effects of Treg cells.

Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
The relationship between vedolizumab serum concentration and extent of α4β7 binding 
saturation by vedolizumab was investigated during the clinical development program. In Study 
C13001, maximum α4β7 binding saturation was rapidly achieved following vedolizumab 
administration (0.2-10.0 mg/kg); hence, it was not possible to draw a clear relationship between 
vedolizumab dose or concentration with α4β7 binding inhibition. 
Figure 8 Mean Percentage of Baseline Percentage of MAdCAM-1-Fc+ Over Time by Dose 
Cohorts (Study C13002) 
Based on graphical evaluation from study C13002, the loss of near maximal inhibition (> 10% of 
baseline) of Act-1 began by Days 183, 225, and 211 in the 2.0, 6.0, and 10.0 mg/kg cohorts, 
respectively, and loss of near maximal inhibition of MAdCAM-1-Fc began by Days 169, 211, and 
197 in the 2.0, 6.0, and 10.0 mg/kg cohorts, respectively (Figure 8). Inhibition of both Act-1 and 
MAdCAM-1-Fc was much lower in patients receiving placebo, and the data were highly variable. A 
slight dose related trend in AUEC0-tlast was detectable between 2.0 and 6.0 mg/kg vedolizumab, 
although the values were similar following 6.0 and 10.0 mg/kg vedolizumab (Figure 9). Faster 
clearance of vedolizumab and loss of α4β7 binding saturation was observed in 1 of the 2 
patients with persistent HAHA-positivity compared to HAHA-negative patients. 
The relationship between Act-1 and vedolizumab serum concentrations was modeled using an 
Emax model, and the concentration at half maximum effect (IC50) values were low (ranging 
from 0.093-0.611 ug/mL dependent on inclusion of phase 1 or 2 data and MLN0002 [Process A] 
or vedolizumab [Process B] material), indicating that saturation is achieved at low vedolizumab 
concentrations.

Figure 9 Percentage of Baseline Inhibition of Percentage of Act-1+ and Percentage of 
MAdCAM+ AUEC(0-tlast) Versus Dose Cohort (C13002) 
Vedolizumab led to near-complete saturation of the α4β7 integrin at all dose levels used in the 
clinical program; consequently, inhibition of α4β7 binding to Act-1 or MAdCAM-1 was found to be 
an insensitive predictor of clinical response. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or 
substances  
Study C13013 was conducted to assess the effect of a single dose of 750mg VDZ on the immune 
response to systemic and mucosal antigenic challenge. 
The primary objective was to determine the rates of seroconversion to a hepatitis B vaccine 
series after a single 750-mg intravenous (IV) dose of vedolizumab or placebo. 
The secondary objectives were: 
• 
• 
To determine the rates of seroconversion to an oral cholera vaccine (Dukoral) series after a 
single 750-mg IV dose of vedolizumab or placebo 
To assess the mean (geometric) change in hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs), after a 
single 750-mg IV dose of vedolizumab or placebo 
Based on the results of this study, the following conclusions can be made: 
• 
• 
• 
Treatment with vedolizumab prior to vaccination with the intramuscular hepatitis B  vaccine 
series did not affect seroconversion rates 
The overall quantitative response to hepatitis B vaccination (as expressed by  geometric 
mean anti-HBs) was not affected by serum vedolizumab concentrations  similar to the 
therapeutic range 
The percentage of subjects who responded to an oral killed cholera vaccine was reduced by 
pretreatment with vedolizumab

2.4.4 Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Vedolizumab is administered by intravenous (IV) infusion, therefore absorption is not relevant 
and the bioavailability is expected to be 100%. A phase 1 study (Study C13010) was performed 
to determine VDZ bioavailability of subcutaneously (SC) and intramuscular (IM) administration. 
Following IM and SC administration, vedolizumab achieves maximum concentration at 5-7 days 
post injection. The Cmax following IM and SC injection was approximately 1/3 of the Cmax 
reached after 30 minutes post IV infusion. There was no difference in the terminal elimination 
profile of IM and SC cohorts compared to the IV cohort, indicating that the elimination of VDZ is 
not limited to the absorption rate.  
Three processes of MLN0002, have been used in nonclinical evaluations and in clinical 
development program and are identified as Process A, Process B, and Process C. These processes 
show differences in the manufacturing and/or drug substance/drug product formulation. 
The relative bioavailability of Process C and Process B was assessed in study C13009. All PK 
parameters obtained from these processes were very similar as confirmed by statistical analysis 
of the bioequivalence, thus indicating that Process B and Process C are bioequivalent (geometric 
mean ratio of Process B/Process C  for Cmax and AUC are close to 1) 
Data from phase 1 studies showed a Vz value of vedolizumab of approximately 0.04 L/kg and PK 
analyses performed in the population PK study indicated that the distribution volume of VDZ is 
approximately 5 litres.  
The volume of distribution of VDZ clearly indicates that the drug is essentially confined in the 
systemic circulation, as expected for a protein with a high molecular weight (approximately 
146,000 Da). 
Vedolizumab is a therapeutic monoclonal antibody and is not expected to bind to plasma 
proteins, for this reason, plasma protein binding of vedolizumab has not been evaluated, which is 
acceptable to the CHMP. Since the expected consequence of metabolism of vedolizumab is 
degradation to small peptides and single amino acid, no studies were performed to assess the 
route of excretion of vedolizumab; this is in line with ICH S6(R1) guideline and accepted by the 
CHMP.  Moreover, vedolizumab is a high molecular weight protein and the contribution of renal 
clearance is negligible. 
Population PK analyses indicated that vedolizumab has a total body clearance of approximately 
0.157 L/day and a plasma half-life of 25 days. The half-life value is consistent with those of 
therapeutic antibodies (typically 3-4 weeks), which is also similar to that of endogenous IgGs. 
This relatively long half-life is probably due to binding to neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), which 
protects the antibody from proteolysis. 
Low doses (≤ 2 mg/kg) of vedolizumab are linked to a decrease of CL, whereas doses higher than 
2 mg/kg that lead to a dose-proportional increase of exposure are not associated to a 
corresponding increase of the CL. This is probably due to a saturable clearance mechanism that 
is predominating at low concentrations (probably mediated by binding to the cell surface target), 
while at higher concentrations this mechanism is saturated and the drug is eliminated through a 
general mechanism of IGgs elimination. This mechanism was also observed with other 
therapeutic antibodies.

Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/676643/2013 
Page 64/166 
 
  
PK parameters were generally consistent for Day 1 and Day 85. Cmax of VDZ increased dose 
dependently on both Day 1 and Day 85. The Cmax on Day 85 was approximately 1.0-fold to 1.2-
fold higher than Day 1 across all dose cohorts. Consistently, AUC (following first dose and the 
fourth dose) also increased in a dose-dependent manner. Day 1 AUC analysis as compared to 
Day 85, both analysed for 14 days post dose interval (AUCDay0-14 and AUC Day85-99) was 
approximately 1.3-fold to 1.5-fold higher across all dose cohorts, indicating that that the 8-week 
interval between the Day 29 and the Day 85 was long enough to allow almost complete 
elimination of VDZ from the serum. The only time-dependent change in PK is due to the 
formation of HAHA. 
The findings of the Population PK analysis showed an influence of body weight on weight-
normalized CL and Vz (consistent with data from phase 1 study C13005). Weight was found to 
influence the clearance and exposure, because higher body weight increases the drug clearance. 
However, the effect should not have any clinical relevance.  
The effect of basal albumin level on the clearance is consistent with the observation that the 
clearance of other therapeutic antibodies (i.e. infliximab, adalimumab) was higher in patients 
with lower albumin levels. Importantly, patients with low albumin levels also had lower response 
rates to infliximab (Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2010 May;48(5):297-308).  
An exploratory analysis was performed by the Applicant showing that increasing Caverage leads to 
a higher probability of clinical remission, clinical response, and enhanced clinical response at 
Week 6. However, a possible bias should be taken into account in this exposure-response 
relationship exploratory analysis considering that there are baseline covariates that are or may 
be related to both exposure and the probability of clinical response or remission in the placebo 
group. 
An exposure-response models for clinical remission and clinical response adjusted for four 
covariates: baseline ALB, baseline FeCP, baseline CRP, and prior anti-TNF_ use for CD and 
baseline ALB, baseline FeCP, and prior anti-TNF_ use for UC was developed. The exposure-
response relationships estimated in the adjusted models provide some evidence that the 
exploratory, unadjusted models do not adequately characterize the effect of exposure in this 
patient population.  
In conclusion, the adjusted models for clinical response and clinical remission make an 
assumption that the exposure-response relationship does not depend on baseline ALB, baseline 
FeCP, baseline CRP, or prior TNF_ use for UC and CD. 
Population PK analysis failed to find a clinically significant effect of HAHA status on the clearance. 
However, findings of phase 1 and 2 studies clearly showed that in HAHA positive subjects, 
clearance of the drug and loss of binding saturation to α4β7 sites were faster than in non-
positive subjects. PK data after a single dose indicate that PK of VDZ is essentially the same in 
both HS and patients.  
Data from phase 1b/2 studies show that: 1) HAHA formation increase the clearance of the drug 
and decreases its PD effects; 2) Process A is highly immunogenic; 3) immunogenicity of the drug 
produced by CHO (Process B and C) is lower than Process A.  
Entyvio 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/676643/2013 
Page 65/166 
 
  
Trough concentration data from phase 3 studies are remarkably similar across studies, thus 
indicating a low variability of the clearance of the drug. Steady-state is reached by week 22, 
which is consistent with the half-life value found in phase 1 studies. 
There was no evidence for a direct interaction with transporters or metabolising enzymes. 
However, monoclonal antibodies that are cytokine modulators may modify the metabolism of 
drugs that are substrates for P450 enzymes through their effects on the regulation pathways of 
P450 enzymes. The effect of vedolizumab on cytokines has been evaluated in vitro in human 
leukocytes isolated from peripheral blood and in clinical studies. Binding of VDZ to leukocytes in 
human whole blood did not elicit cytokine production, including γ-interferon, TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, 
IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 (P70), IL-17, IL-12 (P40), and IL-23 proteins, thus suggesting that VDZ is 
not a cytokine-modulator. 
To evaluate the effect of other drugs on vedolizumab PK, concomitant immunomodulator 
therapies were tested using a population PK approach. The immunomodulator drugs were tested 
individually in the model: azathioprine, methotrexate, mercaptopurine, and aminosalicylates and 
the effects of the concomitant administration of immunomodulators on CL L were not considered 
clinically relevant. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Two PD assays (Act-1 and MAdCAM-1-Fc) have been used during the development program. 
Although termed PD assay by the applicant these assays were designed to assess the lack of Act-
1 and MAdCAM-1-Fc binding to the cells of interest; namely memory CD4 and CD8 cells 
expressing the α4β7 integrin.  It is noted that as cells in peripheral blood express the α4β7 
integrin and this integrin has been shown to bind to MAdCAM-1 on mucosal epithelium, but 
epithelia such as  respiratory and urogenital have also been described to express MAdCAM. 
However it is understood that the knowledge of α4β7 positive cell trafficking into mucosa other 
than GI has not been fully elucidated. The increased incidence of URTIs is highlighted in the 
SmPC and described in the RMP. 
In the phase 3 program (Studies C13006, C13007, C13008, and C13011), positive samples were 
confirmed for specificity, titered, and examined for the ability to neutralize vedolizuamb activity.  
The immunogencity assays used for the phase 3 trials overall are considered adequate by the 
CHMP.  
In view of the potential risk of PML, the lack of blockade of binding of α4β7 to VCAM by 
vedolizumab and the lack of mobilisation of stem cells by vedolizumab, together with the non-
clinical studies all support the applicant’s proposal that the risk of PML is not considered high. In 
addition assessment of lymphocyte trafficking into the CSF was assessed. Study C13012 was 
conducted to evaluate the effects of vedolizumab on the CD4+:CD8+ lymphocyte ratio in the 
CSF of healthy subjects. These results are consistent with a lack of a vedolizumab effect on 
lymphocyte numbers within the CSF and support the position that vedolizumab does not inhibit 
lymphocyte trafficking into the CSF.   
2.4.5 Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall the PK and pharmacodynamic effects of VDZ have been extensively studied and there are 
no major concerns in relation to the PK or pharmacodynamics. PK data and Population PK

Assessment report

analysis showed no accumulation and steady state PK levels with maintenance dosing of 300mg 
either every 4 or every 8 weeks. PK data also show that concomitant administration of 
immunomodulators has no significant impact on the PK. 
In clinical trials with VDZ at single doses ranging from 0.2 to 10 mg/kg and fixed doses from 180 
to 750 mg, binding of Mad-CAM-1-Fc to α4β7 binding on subsets of circulating lymphocytes was 
blocked.  This PD effect was present when serum VDZ levels were at ~1ug/ml and above. A 
similar PD effect was noted on other cells tested such as B cells. 
The range of cells bound by VDZ is broad, but in terms of the lymphocyte subpopulations that 
express α4β7 it has been shown that this is a smaller population than the cells expressing 
α4β1 which are bound by natalizumab. As VDZ is specific for α4β7 and the known function of 
α4β7 is binding to Mad-CAM in the gut, VDZ will block this interaction. Mad-Cam is expressed in 
other mucosal surfaces and the effect of blocking cellular trafficking to other mucosal sites is not 
clear. 
As a result of two amino acid changes in the Fc region, VDZ does not activate complement nor 
bind to Fc Receptors and so cannot be implicated in antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity nor 
does VDZ stimulate cytokine release from lymphocytes. After treatment with a single 750mg 
dose of VDZ in healthy controls it was shown that response to a systemic immunisation 
(Hepatitis B) was non-inferior to the responses seen in the control group. The immune response 
to an oral vaccine (Cholera) was reduced by VDZ.  It is not clear at this point whether chronic 
VDZ treatment may impact on immune response to systemic immunisation. This lack of data is 
reflected in the product information and described in the RMP. 
 Although no cases of PML have been identified within the VDZ clinical programme, there remains 
a potential risk. This is considered less than for natalizumab in view of the more restricted range 
of cells bound by VDZ, the absence of an increase in circulating stem cells, the lack of an effect 
on lymphocyte trafficking into the CSF, and the supportive non-clinical studies. This risk is 
addressed in the product information and the risk minimization activities adequately described in 
the RMP.  
No effect on systemic immune responses but a decrease in gut immune responses was observed.    
Although the range of cell bound by VDZ is broad there is little scientific information on the effect 
of VDZ binding to non-gut homing cells. It is however noted that increased URTIs were observed 
in the clinical trials with VDZ. This is addressed in the RMP. 
2.5. Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1. Dose response studies 
Studies C13007, C13011, and L199-016 were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials 
in patients 18 years of age and older with active CD. In these studies, induction efficacy was 
assessed by evaluating the effects of vedolizumab treatment on clinical response, clinical 
remission, and other measures of disease activity. The rationale for the posology was the same 
as that for the UC indication (study C13006).  
The strategy for dose selection in this phase 3 study was based on the following considerations:

•  Clinical efficacy and dose response in phase 2 
•  Suppression of HAHA formation 
•  Serum concentration of vedolizumab at the efficacious doses in phase 2 studies (PK 
considerations) 
•  Maintenance of α4β7 receptor saturation (PD considerations) 
A dose of 300 mg vedolizumab (approximately equivalent to 4 mg/kg vedolizumab for a 75-kg 
patient) was selected for the Induction Phase dosing (Weeks 0 and 2). This selection was based 
on the phase 2 findings that 2 mg/kg vedolizumab administered Q4W as induction therapy was 
an efficacious dose for both CD and UC, but that maximal efficacy may not have been achieved. 
Evidence from other biologic agents suggested that incorporating a loading regimen may induce 
an immune tolerance effect. Also, formation of HAHA following vedolizumab treatment is dose 
dependent. Therefore, doses higher than those that might ordinarily be acceptable short-term in 
the absence of HAHA are required to sustain remission throughout the dosing intervals. The 
favourable safety profile of vedolizumab induction doses up to 10 mg/kg supported selection of 
this dose for induction therapy in this study. 
In the Maintenance Phase, dosing regimens of 300 mg vedolizumab administered Q8W and 
300 mg vedolizumab administered Q4W were to be evaluated in separate treatment arms. 
The regimen of dosing Q8W was based on the phase 2 studies where 2 mg/kg vedolizumab 
administered Q4W effectively induced clinical remission in UC and CD. Based on modeling and 
simulations across the dose range (0.5 to 10 mg/kg), it was expected that a dose of 4 mg/kg 
Q8W would provide a similar total vedolizumab exposure as achieved with the most efficacious 
dose (2 mg/kg administered Q4W) in the phase 2 studies. 
The regimen of dosing Q4W aimed to ensure that minimum vedolizumab concentrations, similar 
to those observed at the efficacy endpoints in the phase 2 studies, are maintained over the 
dosing interval in the majority of patients. Vedolizumab treatment was generally well tolerated in 
79 healthy subjects and IBD patients that were treated with doses and/or dose regimens 
resulting in concentrations that exceeded the median predicted steady-state vedolizumab peak 
and trough concentrations for the proposed dose (300 mg vedolizumab administered Q4W). 
Both dosing regimens were expected to suppress immunogenicity during multiple dosing, 
thereby maintaining sufficient vedolizumab exposure and α4β7 receptor saturation throughout 
the dosing interval which, in previous efficacy studies, have been shown to result in clinical 
efficacy.

Methods 
Study C13006 was the main pivotal designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of VDZ as 
induction and maintenance treatments in patients with moderately to severely active UC who had 
an inadequate response to, loss of response to, or intolerance to immunomodulators or TNFα 
antagonists. 
Figure 7 shows the overall C13006 trial design, indicating the Induction Phase and the 
Maintenance Phase treatment periods.  
Figure 7 Overview of Induction and Maintenance Studies  
Study Participants  
Subjects had to have a diagnosis of UC established at least 6 months and moderately to severely 
active UC as determined by a Mayo score of 6 to 12 with an endoscopic subscore ≥ 2 within 7 
days prior to the first dose of study drug. 
They also were required to have evidence of UC extending proximal to the rectum (≥ 15 cm of 
involved colon) and an inadequate response to, loss of response to, or intolerance of at least 1 of 
the following: azathioprine (≥ 1.5 mg/kg) 6-mercaptopurine (≥ 0.75 mg/kg) or TNFα antagonists 
(infliximab). 
Treatments 
Randomized patients were treated with infusions of double-blind study (VDZ 300mg or saline for 
placebo arm) drug at Weeks 0 and 2. These patients (Cohort 1) compose the population 
evaluated for primary efficacy and are referred to as the C13006 Induction Study Intent-to-treat 
(ITT) population.

Figure 8 Patient Treatment Overview 
During the Induction Phase, patients randomized (Cohort 1) or assigned (Cohort 2) to VDZ 
received an intravenous infusion of VDZ 300 mg at Weeks 0 and 2. VDZ administered to Cohort 
1 patients was blinded and VDZ administered to Cohort 2 patients was open label as cohort 2 
was enrolled to increase the number of subjects available to enter into the maintenance phase of 
the study. 
During the Maintenance Phase, double-blind VDZ was administered to the 2 VDZ dosing regimen 
groups in the ITT population (300 mg administered every 4 weeks or every 8 weeks). Patients in 
the VDZ every 4 weeks treatment group received double-blind VDZ infusions every 4 weeks from 
Week 6 to Week 50, (i.e., Weeks 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34, 38, 42, 46, and 50). Patients 
who were randomized to the every 8 weeks dosing regimen received active study drug at Weeks 
6, 14, 22, 30, 38, and 46, and, to maintain blinding, placebo saline infusions at Weeks 10, 18, 
26, 34, 42, and 50. VDZ-treated patients in the non-ITT population (induction non-responders) 
received open-label VDZ infusions every 4 weeks from Week 6 through Week 50, i.e., the every 
4 week induction dosing regimen was maintained without interruption from the Induction Phase 
through the duration of the Maintenance Phase.

Sample size 
A total of 895 patients with moderately to severely active UC were enrolled in Study C13006. 
Maintenance phase  
The sample size calculation for the Maintenance Study was based on the number of patients who 
received vedolizumab (in either Cohort 1 or Cohort 2) in the Induction Phase and achieved 
clinical response at Week 6. Power estimates based on a total sample size of 372 patients (124 
per arm) and a two-sided 5% significance level are provided in Table 28. 
Table 28 Power Estimates for the Primary and Key Secondary Efficacy Analyses in the 
Maintenance Study 
Intent-to-Treat Population 
For the maintenance efficacy analyses, the ITT population was defined as all randomized patients 
who received vedolizumab during the Induction Phase and met the protocol definition of clinical 
response at Week 6, as assessed by the investigator, were randomized, and received any 
amount of double-blind study drug in the Maintenance Phase. This population was used for the 
primary efficacy analysis and all proportional-based endpoints, such as remission, response, and 
corticosteroid-free remission.  
Modified Intent-to-Treat Population 
Maintenance Study Modified ITT Population 
The Modified ITT population for maintenance analyses included all patients randomized as Week 
6 responders who received vedolizumab during the Induction Phase, met the protocol definition 
of clinical response at Week 6, and then received any amount of study drug and had a baseline 
(Week 0) and at least 1 post Week 6 measurement in the Maintenance Phase for the endpoint 
under consideration. 
This population was used for change from baseline (Week 0) analyses such as analyses of IBDQ, 
SF-36 and EQ-5D. Patients in this population were analyzed according to the treatment they 
were randomized to receive, regardless of any errors of dosing.

Maintenance Study Per-Protocol Population 
Patients were to be included in the Maintenance Study Per-Protocol population if they met the 
following criteria according to the specified hierarchy: 
•  Confirmed diagnosis of UC of at least 6 months duration and an enrolling Mayo score 
between 6 and 12 (inclusive) with an endoscopic subscore of ≥ 2 
•  Received the correct study medication as assigned 
•  Did not have the treatment assignment unblinded by the investigator 
•  Met 1 or more of the following criteria for treatment failure prior to week 52: 
o  Failed as assessed by the investigator 
o  Received any non-study drug due to lack of efficacy 
o  Had surgery due to lack of efficacy 
o  Had a drug-related AE leading to discontinuation 
•  Received 80% of doses of study drug, as assigned 
•  Did not receive concomitant corticosteroids or other potentially effective medications (except 
as permitted per protocol) for an unrelated comorbid condition (e.g., prednisone for 
idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura) 
•  Had a valid Week 52 or ET assessment for complete Mayo score Analyses using the Per-
Protocol population are provided as sensitivity analyses. 
Randomisation 
Randomization occurred via a central randomization interactive voice response system (IVRS).  
The eligibility criteria for both cohorts were identical. In Cohort 1, eligible UC patients were 
randomized to treatment with double-blind vedolizumab or placebo in a 3:2 ratio. The 3:2 
randomization ratio was chosen to increase the number of patients exposed to vedolizumab. The 
randomization was stratified for 2 factors: 1) concomitant use of oral corticosteroids; and 2) 
previous exposure to TNFα antagonists and/or concomitant immunomodulators (6-
mercaptopurine [6-MP] or azathioprine). 
Blinding (masking) 
Induction phase C13006 
To maintain the blind, all study personnel directly involved with the trial execution, operation, 
conduct and monitoring, and all study site personnel, except the site investigational pharmacist 
or designee, were blinded to the patient treatment assignments for the duration of the study. 
Statistical methods 
Induction Study 
The primary endpoint (proportion of patients with clinical response at Week 6) was tested using 
the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) chi-square test at a 5% significance level, with stratification 
according to the randomization stratification factors (concomitant use of oral corticosteroids 
[yes/no] and previous exposure to TNFalfa antagonists and/or concomitant immunomodulator 
use [yes/no]). The CMH chi-square p value and the risk difference, along with its 95% two-sided 
Entyvio

confidence interval (CI), were provided. The secondary endpoints (proportion of patients in 
clinical remission at Week 6 and the proportion of patients with mucosal healing at Week 6) were 
analysed in the same fashion as the primary endpoint. The overall Type I error rate at 5% was 
controlled through closed sequential methods. The secondary assessments were performed 
sequentially. The first secondary endpoint was tested only if the primary comparison was 
significant, and the second secondary endpoint was tested only if the first secondary endpoint 
was significant for vedolizumab. 
For the proportion-based exploratory analyses, the proportions and absolute treatment 
differences are provided along with their corresponding 95% 2-sided CIs.  For continuous 
variables, the changes from baseline (Week 0) over time were summarized. Changes in HRQOL 
were assessed by analyses in the IBDQ, SF-36, and EQ-5D scores at Week 6.  The mean changes 
from baseline (Week 0) in IBDQ, SF-36, and EQ-5D scores are presented by treatment arm along 
with the 95% 2-sided CIs for the differences in mean changes from baseline (Week 0) based on 
an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model.   
Maintenance Study 
For the 2 dose regimen assessments of the primary endpoint (proportion of patients with clinical 
remission at Week 52), the CMH chi-square test was used to compare the 2 treatment groups at 
the 5% level of significance with stratification according to the randomization stratification 
factors (enrollment in Cohort 1 or 2 in the Induction Phase, concomitant use of oral 
corticosteroids [yes/no], and previous exposure to TNF alpha antagonists and/or concomitant 
immunomodulator use [yes/no]). The CMH chi-square p value and the absolute treatment 
difference along with its 95% 2-sided CI were calculated. The absolute treatment difference was 
the primary test. In addition, the relative risks were calculated along with the 95% 2-sided CI 
estimate. For the 2 comparisons of the primary endpoint, the Hochberg method was applied to 
control the overall Type I error rate at a 5% significance level. Sensitivity Analyses for the 
primary endpoint were performed considering the Completers (Observe Case) Population and 
Per-Protocol Population. The secondary efficacy endpoints (proportion of patients with durable 
clinical response at Week 52, proportion of patients with mucosal healing at Week 52, proportion 
of patients with durable clinical remission at Week 52, proportion of patients with corticosteroid-
free remission at Week 52) were analyzed in the same fashion as the primary endpoint. To 
maintain the overall Type I error rate at 5% for the 2 dose regimen comparisons for each 
secondary endpoint, the Hochberg method was used. To further maintain the overall Type I error 
rate at 5%, the secondary assessments were also performed sequentially. The first secondary 
endpoint was tested only if 1 or both of the primary comparisons were significant, and the next 
secondary endpoint was tested only if the previous secondary endpoint was significant for at 
least 1 dose. For the proportion-based exploratory analyses, the proportions and absolute 
treatment differences are provided along with their corresponding 95% 2-sided CI. For 
continuous variables, the changes from baseline (Week 0) over time were summarized.  Changes 
in HRQOL were assessed by analyses of the IBDQ, SF-36, and EQ-5D questionnaire scores. The 
mean changes from baseline (Week 0) in IBDQ, SF-36, and EQ- 5D scores were tabulated by 
treatment arm along with 95% 2-sided CIs for the differences in mean changes from baseline 
(Week 0) based on an ANCOVA model. Time to UC-related hospitalization, time to colectomy, 
and time to UC-related procedure were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. The 95% CIs 
around the median were calculated. Time to major UC-related events (defined as the 
Entyvio 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/676643/2013

combination of hospitalizations, colectomies, and UC-related procedures) was assessed using the 
Marginal Cox Model for multiple Events (Wei, Lin, and Weissfeld Cox-Regression). To apply the 
Wei, Lin, and Weissfeld method, a separate test statistic (log-rank test) first needed to be 
computed for each type of event using Cox proportional hazard models adjusting for concomitant 
medication use at baseline (Week 0), prior exposure to TNFalfa antagonists, geographic region, 
and Mayo score at baseline (Week 0).

Figure 14 Study Drug Assignment and Disposition of All Patients in Induction Phase – 
Study C13006 
A total of 1406 patients were screened for enrollment in the study. Of these, 511 patients failed 
screening due to the following reasons: did not meet enrollment criteria (394 patients); withdrew 
consent (36 patients); sponsor’s discretion (10 patients); SAE (6 patients); and other or 
unknown reason (65 patients).  
Thus, 895 patients were enrolled in the study and randomized to treatment. Of these, 374 
patients were enrolled into Cohort 1 and 521 patients were enrolled into Cohort 2 (including 
additional patients, per protocol, as recommended by the DSMB based on their monitoring of 
unblinded response and attrition rates).

In the ITT Population, a greater proportion of placebo-treated patients discontinued treatment 
than did vedolizumab-treated patients (62% placebo vs. 37% and 33% in the vedolizumab Q8W 
and Q4W dosing regimens, respectively). The most frequent reason for discontinuation across all 
of the ITT Population treatment groups was lack of efficacy, which occurred in 48% of the 
placebo group and less frequently in the vedolizumab groups (25% and 26%, respectively). 
Discontinuations due to adverse events were twice as frequent in the placebo group (12% vs. 
6% and 5% in the two vedolizumab groups, respectively). Most of the patients in the ITT 
population continued into the long-term Study C13008.

Protocol Deviations Leading to Exclusion from the Per-Protocol Population, Induction 
A total of 21 patients (11 patients from the placebo group and 10 patients from the ITT 
vedolizumab group) had at least 1 protocol deviation and are excluded from the Per-Protocol 
population. For both groups, an invalid Day 43/ET assessment was the most common protocol 
deviation. An invalid Day 43/ET assessment may have been due to either a clinical assessment 
outside Days 36 to 56 (inclusive) or a sigmoidoscopy performed outside Days 29 to 56 
(inclusive). 
Baseline data 
Induction phase  
Patients were predominantly white (82%), male (59%) with a mean age of 40.3 years (range 
18-78 years) and a mean weight of 73.4 kg (range 32-174 kg). Overall, baseline demographics 
were similar for VDZ and placebo patients in the ITT population. With respect to geographic 
distribution, 37% were enrolled at sites in North America and 63% were enrolled at sites outside 
of North America, including 22% in sites located in Asia, Australia, and Africa, 19% in 
Western/Northern European sites, 13% in Central European sites, and 8% in Eastern European 
sites. 
The mean duration of disease was 6.9 years (median 4.9 years) and the mean baseline disease 
activity, as assessed by the baseline Mayo score, was 8.6. Fifty percent of patients had a 
complete Mayo Score of 9 to 12 (inclusive), 64% of patients had baseline fecal calprotectin of > 
500 μg/g, and most of the patients had left-sided colitis (38%) or pancolitis (37%). Most of the 
patients did not have history of extraintestinal manifestations (67%). The ITT population 
treatment groups were comparable with respect to disease characteristics. The baseline 
demographic characteristics and baseline disease characteristics of the Cohort 2 patients were 
similar to those of patients in Cohort 1. Enrollment of patients with prior TNFα antagonist use 
was limited to no more than 50%; in the entire study population, 52% of patients were TNFα 
antagonist naive. 
Concomitant medications (induction phase) 
Most placebo and VDZ patients used at least 1 concomitant medication (UC-related and non-UC 
related). Of the standard medications used for UC, 5-ASAs were the most common and were 
used by 74% of patients. There were no notable treatment differences between the groups in the 
use of concomitant medications for UC. 
Maintenance phase C13006 
Baseline demographics were similar to the induction phase. Baseline disease characteristics are 
shown in table 5.

Table 5 Baseline Ulcerative Colitis Disease Characteristics – Maintenance Phase Safety 
Population  
Baseline disease activity, as assessed by mean Mayo score and category of Mayo score, was 
similar in the 3 groups, as was the category of baseline fecal calprotectin. There were treatment 
differences in mean baseline fecal calprotectin; however, due to large variability in the values, it 
is unlikely that these represent actual differences. In general, baseline disease characteristics in 
the non-ITT treatment groups were similar to those in the ITT treatment groups, with the 
exception of median UC durations (4.5 years and 4.6 years in the non-ITT placebo and VDZ 
groups, respectively). 
Prior TNFα antagonist use was similar in the ITT population treatment groups (37-42%), as was 
prior use of other UC treatments. The majority of patients had exposure to systemic 
corticosteroids and / or immunomodulators: 97% of combined placebo patients and 98% of 
combined VDZ patients had exposure to corticosteroids; 75% of combined placebo patients and 
76% of combined VDZ patients had exposure to immunomodulators. 
Concomitant medications (maintenance phase) 
Of the standard medications for UC, 5-ASAs were the most common and were used by 70% to 
78% of patients.

Crohn’s disease (CD) 
Study C13007 (GEMINI II): A Phase 3, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Blinded, Multicenter 
Study of the Induction and Maintenance of Clinical Response and Remission by Vedolizumab 
(MLN0002) in Patients With Moderate to Severe Crohn’s Disease 
Methods 
Study C13007, was a multinational study conducted at 285 sites. This trial was designed to 
support the registration of VDZ for induction and maintenance treatment of a broad population of 
patients who have failed 1 or more standard therapies for CD, including immunomodulators 
(azathioprine, 6-MP, or methotrexate) and TNFα antagonists. To ensure that the efficacy of VDZ 
could be evaluated in patients who are naïve to TNFα antagonists, enrollment of patients with 
previous TNFα antagonist exposure was to be limited to no more than 50% of the overall study 
population. 
Study C13007 was designed to comprise 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies 
conducted under 1 protocol which, operationally, consisted of 2 phases: 
• 
• 
• 
The Induction Phase, designed to establish the efficacy and safety of VDZ for the induction of 
clinical response and clinical remission, and 
The Maintenance Phase, designed to establish the efficacy and safety of VDZ for the 
maintenance of clinical response and clinical remission. 
Patients in the Induction Phase were to continue on into the Maintenance Phase according to 
protocol-defined criteria. Although conducted under 1 protocol for operational efficiency, the 
2 phases described above included 2 separate sequential double-blind, placebo-controlled 
efficacy studies. Patients who met protocol-specified criteria for clinical response during 
induction were eligible for randomization into the maintenance efficacy study. Each study has

• 
Patients who were too ill or who could not benefit from medical treatment (such as patients 
with symptomatic stenoses, patients with severe disease that required surgical treatment, 
and patients with extensive surgeries) were excluded. Patients with serious comorbidities or 
who had neurological conditions that could confound the assessments for potential cases of 
PML were also to be excluded. 
Treatments 
During the Induction Phase, patients randomized (Cohort 1) or assigned (Cohort 2) to VDZ were 
to receive an IV infusion of VDZ 300 mg at Weeks 0 and 2. VDZ administered to Cohort 1 
patients was to be blinded and VDZ administered to Cohort 2 patients was to be open label. 24 
different batches were used in C13007. Patients randomized to placebo were to receive 250 mL 
of 0.9% sodium chloride IV at Weeks 0 and 2. 
During the maintenances phase the active arms received 300mg VDZ as maintenance treatment 
administered either every 4 weeks (Q4W) or every 8 weeks (Q8W).

Sample size 
Approximately 1059 patients were planned to be enrolled into this study from approximately 500 
sites worldwide. An initial cohort (Cohort 1) of 370 patients was to be randomized in the 
Induction Phase, based on the sample size requirements of the Induction Study. Approximately 
689 patients were then to be enrolled in Cohort 2. The number of patients to be enrolled in 
Cohort 2 was determined by the sample size requirements of the Maintenance Study. The 
protocol allowed for up to 100 additional patients to be enrolled into Cohort 2 (increasing the 
total number of study participants to 1159), depending on the observed overall response rate in 
the combined cohorts, to ensure that at least 501 patients with clinical response at Week 6 to 
vedolizumab treatment were randomized in the Maintenance Phase.

Randomisation 
The IVRS provided treatment assignments based on randomization numbers. 
Blinding (masking) 
All patients and all study personnel except for those directly involved with study drug preparation 
(e.g., the site pharmacist) were to be blinded to study drug assignment for the entire study. 
Study drug was to be masked by the unblinded site pharmacist using IV bag covers to maintain 
blinding.  
Statistical methods 
Induction study: The primary endpoints (proportion of patients with clinical remission at Week 
6 and proportion of patients with enhanced clinical response at Week 6 in the ITT Population) 
were tested using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) chi-square test at a 5% significance level, 
with stratification based on the following stratification factors: concomitant use of oral 
corticosteroids [yes/no] and previous exposure to TNFα antagonists or concomitant 
immunomodulator use [yes/no]. The CMH chi-square p value and the risk difference, along with 
its 95% confidence interval (CI), were provided. In addition, the relative risk was provided with 
the 95% two-sided CI. The Hochberg method was used to preserve alpha for the 2 primary 
endpoints. For the Induction Study, there was 1 secondary assessment of clinical efficacy (mean 
CRP levels), which compared the treatment difference between vedolizumab and placebo. To 
further maintain the overall Type I error rate at 5%, the secondary endpoint was to be tested 
only if at least 1 of the primary comparisons was significant. 
Maintenance study: for the 2 dose regimen assessments of the primary endpoint (proportion 
of patients with clinical remission at Week 52), the CMH chi-square test was used to compare the 
2 treatment groups at the 5% level of significance with stratification according to the 
randomization stratification factors (enrollment in Cohort 1 or 2 in the Induction Phase, 
concomitant use of oral corticosteroids [yes/no], and previous exposure to TNFα antagonists or 
concomitant immunomodulator use [yes/no]). The CMH chi-square p value and the absolute 
treatment difference along with its 95% two-sided CI are provided. In addition, the relative risks 
are provided along with the 95% two-sided CI estimate. For both assessments of the primary 
endpoint, the Hochberg method was applied to control the overall Type I error rate at a 5% 
significance level. The secondary efficacy endpoints were analyzed using closed testing 
procedures. To maintain the overall Type I error rate at 5% for the 2 dose regimen comparisons 
for each secondary endpoint, the Hochberg method was used as described above. To further 
maintain the overall Type I error rate at 5%, the secondary assessments were also performed 
sequentially. The first secondary endpoint was to be tested only if 1 or both of the primary 
comparisons were significant and the next secondary endpoint was to be tested only if the 
previous secondary endpoint was significant for at least 1 dose. For the proportion-based 
exploratory analyses, the proportions and absolute treatment differences were provided along 
with their corresponding 95% two-sided CIs. For continuous variables, the changes from baseline 
(Week 0) over time were summarized. Changes in HRQOL were assessed by analyses of the 
IBDQ, SF-36, and EQ-5D questionnaire scores. The mean changes from baseline (Week 0) in 
IBDQ, SF-36 and EQ-5D scores are presented by treatment arm along with 95% two-sided CIs

Conduct of the study 
Four amendments have been done at the original protocol version (26 June 2008) of which two 
were specific for US (Amendment 2 - 28 October 2008 and Amendment 4 - 21 April 2009). 
Protocol Deviations:  
- Induction Study ITT Population, a total of 23 patients (8 placebo; 15 vedolizumab) had at least 
1 unmet entry criterion, mainly criterion number 2.  
An additional 63 patients in the open label vedolizumab group had violations of 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, the most common failure was to meet the inclusion criterion for 
baseline CDAI score. 
- Maintenance study ITT population, a total of 32 patients (8 placebo; 12 vedolizumab Q8W and 
12 vedolizumab Q4W). All the inclusion/exclusion criteria deviations occurred in ≤2% of 
vedolizumab combined group as well as non-ITT placebo group. The most common deviations 
concerned the inclusion criterion number 2 and number 6.

Baseline data 
Baseline Demographics and disease characteristics (induction phase) 
The population consisted of 47% males and 89% of the population were white Caucasian. The 
mean age was 36.1 years (range 18-77 yrs) mean weight was 69.8 kg (range 30-167 kg) and 
the geographical distribution was 36% from North America, 23% from Western/Northern Europe, 
19% from Central Europe, 8% from Eastern Europe and 14% from Asia/Australia/Africa. The 
baseline demographics were well balanced between the treatment groups.  
The mean duration of disease was 9.0 years (median 7.0 years) and the mean baseline disease 
activity, as assessed by the baseline CDAI score, was 323.6. It is noted that median (minimum 
values) includes CDAI value of 132. Baseline CDAI scores were >330 in 44% of the patients. The 
majority of patients had a baseline CRP >10 mg/L (53%), a baseline fecal calprotectin  500 μg/g 
(56%), and disease involvement of both the ileum and colon (55%). A history of prior surgery 
for CD was reported for 42% of patients. The majority of the patients had no history of fistulizing 
disease (63%); 15% of the patients had a draining fistula at baseline. Extraintestinal 
manifestations of the disease were present at baseline in 62% of patients; 82% of patients had a 
history of extraintestinal manifestations. Most patients had never smoked or were former 
smokers (73%). 
The baseline disease characteristics of the treatment groups in the Induction Study ITT 
Population were generally comparable, although the VDZ group had greater proportions of 
patients with CD duration of ≥7 years (50%) and with a history of prior surgery for CD (45%) 
compared to the placebo group (43% and 36%, respectively). The baseline disease 
characteristics of the open-label VDZ group were generally similar to those observed in the 
Induction Study ITT Population.

Approximately half of the patients in the Induction Study ITT Population (placebo 49%; VDZ 
50%) reported prior TNFα antagonist use. Of the 368 patients in the Induction Study ITT 
Population, 21% had failed 1 TNFα antagonist, 21% had failed 2 TNFα antagonists, and 5% had 
failed 3 TNFα antagonists. The proportions of patients who had previously failed TNFα antagonist 
therapy or were naïve to TNFα antagonist therapy were similar between the treatment groups. In 
addition, the treatment groups were similar with respect to the number of TNFα antagonist 
therapies patients had previously failed. 
In the Induction Study ITT Population, 79% of the patients used at least 1 concomitant IBD 
medication during the study. Corticosteroids were the most commonly used (49%), followed by 
5-ASAs (46%) and immunomodulators (35%). 
Baseline Demographics and disease characteristics maintenance phase 
All patients who completed the Induction Phase entered the Maintenance Phase. The 
Maintenance Study ITT Population includes VDZ-treated patients who had a clinical response at 
Week 6; at the start of the Maintenance Phase, these patients were randomized to 1 of 2 VDZ IV 
dosing regimens (300 mg Q4W or Q8W) or placebo.

The demographic characteristics of the all VDZ combined group were generally consistent with 
those observed in the Maintenance Study ITT Population, including the greatest proportion of 
patients enrolling from sites in North America (39%). In addition, the demographic 
characteristics of the non-ITT VDZ patients (Week 6 non-responders) were consistent with those 
of the Maintenance Study ITT Population (Week 6 responders).  
Although the majority of patients in each of the treatment groups had baseline CDAI scores ≤ 
330, the frequency was highest in the VDZ Q4W group (62%), followed by the placebo (56%) 
and the VDZ Q8W (51%) groups. Median CDAI scores in the Maintenance Study ITT population 
followed a similar pattern with a median score of 322.0 in the VDZ Q8W group, 316.0 in the VDZ 
Q4W group, and 315.0 in the placebo group.

design.  
The non-ITT VDZ group comprises those patients who received VDZ in the Induction Phase and 
were assessed by the investigator as not having achieved clinical response at Week 6; these 
patients received VDZ 300 mg Q4W for the duration of the study. These patients contribute to 
the safety analyses in the Maintenance Phase, and exploratory efficacy analyses were done for

Table 20 Primary Efficacy Endpoints of Clinical Remission and Enhanced Clinical 
Response at Week 6 – Induction Study ITT Population 
In line with the statistical plan to control the Type I error rate statistical significance has been 
shown on the clinical remission endpoint as the p-value of 0.0206 is less than 0.025. Statistical 
significance was not shown for the enhanced clinical response endpoint.  
The pre-specified Hochberg method was applied to control for the overall Type I error rate at a 
5% significance level for the multiple comparisons of the primary endpoints. Since the p value 
for the endpoint of enhanced clinical response at Week 6 was > 0.05, the p value for the 
endpoint of clinical remission at Week 6 was tested at the 0.025 level of significance. As the p 
value for clinical remission at Week 6 was < 0.025 (p = 0.0206), the study is considered to have 
met the primary endpoint of clinical remission at Week 6.

Study C13011 (GEMINI III): A Phase 3, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Blinded, Multicenter 
Study of the Induction of Clinical Response and Remission by Vedolizumab in Patients with 
Moderate to Severe Crohn’s Disease 
Methods 
Study C13011 was a phase 3, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial 
conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of VDZ for the induction of clinical response and 
remission in patients with moderately to severely active CD.  
Of the total patients enrolled, approximately 75% were to have previously failed TNFα antagonist 
therapy and approximately 25% were to have been naïve to TNFα antagonist therapy. 
After completing the Week 10 assessments, patients were eligible to enrol in Study C13008 
(open-label, long-term safety study) if study drug was well tolerated, and no major surgical 
intervention for CD occurred or was required.

Table 22 Patient Disposition 
Study Participants  
A total of 416 patients were enrolled in this phase 3, multinational, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study that was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of VDZ for the 
induction of clinical response and remission in patients with moderately to severely active CD 
with inadequate response to 1 or more of the following therapies: immunomodulators, 
corticosteroids, and/or TNFα antagonists. Of the total patients enrolled, 75% were to have 
previously failed TNFα antagonist therapy, and 25% were to have been naïve to TNFα antagonist 
therapy and, by design, had failed corticosteroid and/or immunosuppressive therapy.  
Inclusion and exclusion criteria for Study C13011 were similar to those for Study C13007. Key 
inclusion criteria related to CD included, but were not limited to, diagnosis of CD established at 
least 3 months prior to enrollment; moderately to severely active CD as determined by a CDAI 
score of 220 to 400 and 1 of the following: 
 a) CRP level > 2.87 mg/L, 
 b) ileocolonoscopy with photographic documentation of a minimum of 3 nonanastomotic 
ulcerations (each > 0.5 cm in diameter) or 10 aphthous ulcerations consistent with CD, or 
 c) fecal calprotectin > 250 mcg/g stool during the Screening period in conjunction with CT 
enterography, MR enterography, contrast-enhanced small bowel radiography, or wireless capsule 
endoscopy revealing Crohn’s ulcerations; CD involvement of the ileum and/or colon; 
documentation of surveillance colonoscopy within 12 months of screening visit for patients with 
long-term history of extensive colitis or pancolitis; inadequate response or intolerance to either 
immunomodulators, corticosteroid, and/or TNFα antagonists. 
Treatments 
Patients randomized to vedolizumab were to receive a 300-mg IV infusion at Weeks 0, 2, and 6. 
Patients randomized to placebo were to receive 250 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride IV at Weeks 0, 
2, and 6.

Sample size 
The study was adequately powered for the primary endpoint, as well as for the key secondary 
endpoints. Power estimates for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were based on a 
Entyvio

Page 97/166 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
total sample size of 396 for the overall study population and 296 for the TNFα antagonist failure 
subpopulation. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either 300 mg vedolizumab or placebo at Weeks 0, 2, 
and 6. Enrollment of patients was monitored by the IVRS to ensure that approximately 75% of 
the overall population had previously failed TNFα antagonist therapy and approximately 25% 
were naïve to TNFα antagonist therapy.  
The randomization to treatment assignment was stratified by the presence or absence of each of 
the following, as entered into the IVRS at screening: 
• 
Previous failure of TNFα antagonist therapy or naïve to TNFα antagonist therapy 
•  Concomitant use of oral corticosteroids 
•  Concomitant use of immunomodulators (6-MP, azathioprine, or methotrexate) 
Randomization schedules were generated and archived by the Biostatistics department at 
Millennium. Each patient who was qualified for treatment was assigned a unique randomization 
number. The IVRS provided treatment assignments based on these randomization numbers. 
Blinding (masking) 
In order to maintain the blind, all study site personnel, except the investigational pharmacist or 
designee, were blinded to the patient treatment assignments for the duration of the study. 
Statistical methods 
The proportion-based endpoints, such as clinical remission, sustained clinical remission, and 
enhanced clinical response, were to be tested using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) chi-
square test at a 5% significance level with stratification according to concomitant use of oral 
corticosteroids and concomitant use of immunomodulators (6-MP, azathioprine, or methotrexate) 
for the TNFα antagonist failure subpopulation, or with stratification according to previous failure 
of TNFα antagonist therapy, concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, and concomitant use of 
immunomodulators (6-MP, azathioprine, or methotrexate) for the overall population. The CMH 
chi-square p-value and the risk difference, along with its 95% two-sided confidence interval (CI), 
were provided. The risk difference was the primary test. In addition, the relative risk was 
provided along with the 95% two-sided CI estimate. 
To maintain the overall Type I error rate at 5%, the secondary endpoint analyses were 
performed sequentially. Specifically, clinical remission at Week 6 for the overall population was 
to be tested only if the primary endpoint comparison was significant; the set of analyses for 
clinical remission at Week 10 for the TNFα antagonist failure subpopulation and the overall 
population was to be tested only if the endpoint of clinical remission at Week 6 for the overall 
population was significant. The remaining secondary endpoints were to be tested only if the 
comparison for the previous secondary endpoint was significant. 
In addition, the Hochberg method was to be applied to each secondary endpoint pair in order to 
control the overall Type 1 error rate at a 5% significance level.

the patients having been diagnosed for ≥ 7 years (57%). The mean baseline disease activity, as 
assessed by the baseline CDAI score, was statistically significantly higher in the VDZ group 
(313.9) than the placebo group (301.3), with 37% of VDZ-treated patients having a baseline 
CDAI score > 330 compared with 29% of the placebo-treated patients. The majority of the 
patients had a baseline CRP > 10 mg/L (50%), a baseline fecal calprotectin > 500 μg/g (58%), 
and disease involvement of both the ileum and colon (61%). A history of prior surgery for CD 
was reported for 44% of the patients. Twelve (12) % of the patients had a draining fistula at 
baseline. Extraintestinal manifestations of the disease were present at baseline in 59% of the 
patients. 75% of subjects had failed anti-TNF therapy.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint for this study was the proportion of patients in clinical remission at 
Week 6 in the TNFα Antagonist Failure ITT Subpopulation. 
In the TNFα Antagonist Failure ITT Subpopulation, no statistically significant difference was 
observed between the VDZ and placebo groups for the proportions of patients in clinical 
remission at Week 6. Of the 158 patients who received VDZ, 24 (15.2%) achieved clinical 
remission at Week 6 compared with 19 of 157 (12.1%) patients who received placebo. The 
treatment difference from placebo was 3.0% (95% CI: -4.5, 10.5; p = 0.4332), with a relative 
probability of achieving clinical remission at Week 6 of 1.2 (relative risk with 95% CI: 0.7, 2.2). 
Study C13011 failed its primary endpoint which was for anti-TNF failure patients. This was a 
stringent endpoint to attempt and unlike C13007 where the primary endpoint of clinical 
remission at week 6 was met by a mixed setting population.  Of note is that from the additional 
analyses presented for both CD studies it is apparent that the effect of VDZ is slower in onset 
than other therapies (e.g. anti-TNFs). Based on the mechanism of action as the effect is to 
decrease T cells entering the gut, but not affect the cells already in situ in the gut, although the 
levels and activity of VDZ in the gut itself are not known, this delay could be expected.

Since the primary efficacy endpoint did not reach statistical significance, formal hypothesis 
testing could not be performed for the ranked secondary endpoints.  . 
Clinical Remission at Week 6 – Overall ITT Population 
In the Overall ITT Population, which included patients who had previously failed or were naïve to 
TNFα antagonist therapy, 19.1% of VDZ-treated patients and 12.1% of placebo-treated patients 
achieved clinical remission at Week 6; the treatment difference from placebo was 6.9%.  
Clinical Remission at Week 10 – TNFα Antagonist Failure ITT Subpopulation and Overall ITT 
Population  
In the TNFα Antagonist Failure ITT Subpopulation, 26.6% of VDZ-treated patients and 12.1% of 
placebo-treated patients achieved clinical remission at Week 10; the treatment difference from 
placebo was 14.4%. The proportion of patients who achieved clinical remission at Week 10 
increased from 15.2% at Week 6 in the VDZ group and was essentially unchanged from Week 6 
(12.1%) in the placebo group. 
In the Overall ITT Population, 28.7% of VDZ-treated patients and 13.0% of placebo-treated 
patients achieved clinical remission at Week 10; the treatment difference from placebo was 
15.5%. The proportion of patients who achieved clinical remission increased from 19.1% at 
Week 6 in the VDZ group and showed little change from Week 6 (12.1%) in the placebo group. 
This numerical difference between both the overall ITT population and the anti-TNF failure ITT 
population in clinical remission at week 10 compared with placebo is consistent with the delayed 
effect seen with VDZ and although these results have to considered exploratory, they are 
biologically consistent with efficacy from VDZ and in line with the primary endpoint which was 
met for study C13007. 
Sustained Clinical Remission – TNFα Antagonist Failure ITT Subpopulation and Overall ITT 
Population 
In the TNFα Antagonist Failure ITT Subpopulation, 12.0% of VDZ-treated patients and 8.3% of 
placebo-treated patients achieved sustained clinical remission; the treatment difference from 
placebo was 3.7%. In the Overall ITT Population, 15.3% of VDZ-treated patients and 8.2% of 
placebo-treated patients achieved sustained clinical remission; the treatment difference from 
placebo was 7.0%.

Sensitivity Analysis of CRP Changes 
To assess the robustness of the CRP changes at Week 6,  ANCOVA on the 
ranks of CRP change from baseline as the response variable and treatment 
group, baseline CRP values, stratification factors (concomitant use of 
corticosteroids and previous exposure to TNFα antagonists and/or 
concomitant use of immunomodulators) as independent variables were used 
using the ITT population. 
Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) 
The mean changes from baseline (Week 0) to Week 6 in IBDQ, SF-36, and 
EQ-5D scores were presented by treatment arm along with 95% two-sided 
confidence intervals for the differences in mean changes from baseline 
(Week 0) based on an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model.

Analysis 
description 
Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) 
Changes in HRQOL were assessed by analyses of the IBDQ, SF-36, and EQ-5D 
scores. The mean changes from baseline (Week 0) in IBDQ, SF-36 and EQ-5D 
scores were presented by treatment arm along with 95% two-sided confidence 
intervals for the differences in mean changes from baseline (Week 0) based on an 
ANCOVA model. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Individual studies:  
In support of the second line indication of vedolizumab the Applicant provided analyses on the 
subgroup of naïve anti-TNF-alpha patients from C13007 and C13011 studies considered either 
individually or pooled. In Study C13007 and C13011, approximately 52% and 25%, respectively, 
of the study populations were TNFα antagonist-naïve, data from these patients were included in 
the pooled analysis. 
Efficacy results obtained in the subgroup of naïve anti-TNF alpha patients from both studies are 
summarized in the Figure 103.c below and briefly reported:

Remission 
In study C13007 week 6 clinical remission was achieved by 17.4% of vedolizumab treated 
patients and 9.2% of placebo patients, with a gain over placebo of 8.2 and a NNT of 12.2. In the 
exploratory analysis at Week 10 of the C13007 safety population, clinical remission rates were 
higher for patients in both groups (27.8% for the vedolizumab group and 15.1% for the placebo 
group), with a difference from placebo of 12.7% and a NNT of 7.9. The difference over placebo 
increased from Week 6 (8.2) to week 10 (12.7) when comparing results from C13007 study and 
exploratory analysis of the C13007 safety population (Figure 103c).

Enhanced clinical response 
In study C13007, week 6 enhanced clinical response was achieved by 42.2% of vedolizumab 
patients and by 30.3 placebo patients, with a gain over placebo of 11.9% and a NNT of 8.4. In 
the exploratory analysis at Week 10 of the C13007 safety population, enhanced clinical response 
was achieved by 47.4% of vedolizumab patients and by 35.6% of placebo, with a difference from 
placebo of 9.0 and a NNT of 11 (Figure 103c). 
In order to support a similar treatment effect of vedolizumab when compared to Adalimumab 
and Infliximab the Applicant submitted comparison data on maintenance of clinical remission in 
naïve patients for VDZ (week 52), Adalimumab (week 56) and Infliximab (week 54).

Pooled analysis  
In support of the second line indication of vedolizumab, the Applicant reported a pooled analysis 
already presented in the initial MAA combining TNFα antagonist-naïve patients in the ITT 
population of the 2 induction studies and reaching a sample size of 277 naïve patients.   
From a methodological perspective the pooling was justified by the similar criteria to define 
failure of conventional therapy, treatment schedule and efficacy assessment for both C13007 and 
C13011 studies. Efficacy results indicated differences in the patient population of the 2 studies 
that should be considered for the pooled data. In this combined analysis, week 6 clinical 
remission was achieved by 22.7% of vedolizumab patients and 10.6% of placebo (p=0.0054), 
with a gain over placebo of 12.6% and a calculated NNT of 8.2. Week 6 enhanced clinical 
response was achieved by 40.3% of vedolizumab patients and 27.6% of placebo (p=0.0316), 
with a gain over placebo of 12.1% and a calculated NNT of 7.9. 
The pooled analysis, including a larger sample size of patients, gives better results that the those 
from the two studies separately considered with a gain over placebo of 12% when remission or 
enhanced clinical response are considered. (C13007: gain over placebo remission 8.2%; gain 
over placebo enhanced response 11.9%. C13011: gain over placebo remission 19.5%; gain over 
placebo enhanced response 15.2%).  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint, Induction 
The secondary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in serum CRP levels at Week 6.  
Among patients in the Induction Study ITT Population, no treatment difference was observed for 
changes from baseline in CRP. The median change from baseline at Week 6 in CRP was -0.5 
mg/L in the placebo group and -0.9 mg/L in the VDZ group.

Table 21 Primary and Secondary Maintenance Efficacy Endpoints at Week 52 – 
Maintenance Study ITT Population (C13007 Maintenance Study) 
Supportive studies 
UC  
Study M200-022: This is a phase 2 placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, parallel 
group, multicenter, study which involves patients with mild to moderate active ulcerative colitis 
(UC). One-hundred-eighty-one (181) patients were enrolled and randomized in 3 arms: placebo, 
0.5 mg/kg LDP-02, or 2.0 mg/kg LDP-02. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether the two 
doses of LDP-02 (0.5 and 2.0 mg/kg) reduced UC disease activity in patients who were not 
receiving corticosteroid or immunosuppressive therapy and to assess the safety and tolerability 
of LDP-02. As a secondary objective, the study was aimed to obtain PK/PD information. The 
primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who underwent in remission after treatment, 
(defined as a 0 or 1 in the total UCCS score Modified Baron score with no evidence of rectal 
bleeding at the Day 43).  
Clinical remission was also evaluated at Day 29.  
Entyvio 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/676643/2013 
Page 114/166 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
The primary endpoint was met: the percentage of patients with clinical remission at day 43 was 
higher in both 0.5mg/kg and 2mg/kg LDP-02 arms than in the placebo. Similar differences from 
placebo are noted when the two doses are compared.  
No statistically significant difference in remission rate at day 29 was reported between treatment 
groups and placebo. 
A positive effect of VDZ is supported by results from secondary endpoints, which are consistent 
with those from the primary endpoint. Overall these findings support the anti-inflammatory 
activity of VDZ in the colon, but not at systemic level (i.e. CRP serum concentration levels), with 
a peak of activity at week 6 similarly achieved by the use of both LDP-02 doses. The Applicant 
discussed the reasons for not observing differences in CRP serum concentrations after VDZ 
treatment and recognized that a later effect of vedolizumab treatment when compared to that of 
TNFα antagonist could depend on the different mechanism of action of these drugs and in 
particular, for active UC data do not support CRP as a useful marker in vedolizumab treated 
patients. 
Both VDZ doses showed a significant improvement in UC disease-related parameters as 
compared to placebo at Day 43. 
The reduced drug effect after day 43 could be expected since probably related to VDZ PK/PD 
characteristics (half-life of 25 days). Indeed, the posology proposed by the Applicant is doubled 
(300mg) for each administration and performed at day 0, 14 and 42. In line with the 
characteristic behaviour of UC inflammatory activity, patients in the placebo group showed an 
improvement of the condition after 43 days.  
CD 
Study L299-016 
Study L299-016 is a phase 2, LDP-02 (VDZ), randomized, double-blind, parallel group, 
multicenter, study that involves patients with mildly to moderately active CD, who were not 
treated with corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressives. A total of 185 patients were enrolled 
and randomly divided into 3 treatment groups: placebo, 0.5 mg/kg LDP-02, or 2.0 mg/kg LDP-
02. All patients received the medical product in two different intravenous (IV) administration on 
Days 1 and 29. The study was aimed to evaluate whether LDP-02 reduced CD activity and to 
obtain PK/PD data.  
Endpoints: 
Primary: evaluation of the percentage of patients with a clinical response at Day 57, defined as 
a reduction from baseline in the CDAI score of at least 70 points.  
Secondary: 1) the proportion of patients with a clinical remission at Day 57 (CDAI score ≤150); 
2) proportion of patients at each visit who met the criteria for clinical remission and clinical 
response; 3) changes in mean CDAI and Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) 
scores; 4) changes in the serum concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP); 5) time to relapse, 
remission and response (Kaplan-Meier time-to-event); 6) proportion of patients who met the 
criteria of treatment failure at Day 29. 
Entyvio 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/676643/2013 
Page 115/166 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Results: The proportion of patients achieving a clinical response at day 57 did not differ respect 
of placebo group (53% of patients in the 2.0 mg/kg LDP-02 group and 49% of patients in the 0.5 
mg/kg LDP-02 group compared with 41% of subjects on placebo), thus indicating that the 
primary endpoint of the study was not met. The other secondary endpoints evaluated by the 
Applicant were only partially and heterogeneously met, thus making difficult the evaluation of 
the study. Overall, it seems that there is an improvement in the disease activity only in some 
evaluation days and those days are often discontinuous thus suggesting that there was no 
relationship between the treatment and the amelioration of the pathology.  
In this case the improvement of the clinical parameters analysed could be associated to the 
relapsing/remitting nature of this pathology and not to the effect of VDZ. As seen in other 
studies, CRP plasma concentration was not reduced by the treatment with VDZ.  
The other secondary endpoints were not met. However the doses used in this study were far 
lower than the phase 3 clinical trials. 
2.5.3 Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Ulcerative Colitis  
The demonstration of the efficacy of VDZ in UC patients is based on one phase 3 pivotal trial, 
Study C13006, conducted under a single protocol but analyzed as 2 studies: the C13006 
Induction Study (week 0-6) and the C13006 Maintenance Study (week 6-52). Supportive 
evidence is derived by two phase II studies: the proof-of-concept and 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) M200-022, study, and the C13002 PK/PD study. 
Moreover, the C13008 and C13004 open-label safety studies with exploratory efficacy endpoints 
support long-term efficacy. The number of studies and overall the clinical development 
programme in UC indication are considered appropriate.  
The main study C13006 (phase 3, multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled trial) was designed to support treatment efficacy and safety in moderately to severely 
active UC patients who have failed 1 or more standard therapies, including corticosteroids, 
thiopurines and Infliximab). Two cohorts of patients, sequentially enrolled with identical eligibility 
criteria, were contained in the 6-week induction phase: Cohort 1 which included patients 
randomized and treated with double-blind study drug and Cohort 2 which included patients 
treated with open-label VDZ. Patients were enrolled in Cohort 2 to ensure that the sample size of 
induction responders randomized into the Maintenance Study provided sufficient power for the 
Maintenance Study primary efficacy analysis. These patients received open-label VDZ and did not 
contribute to the efficacy analyses done in the Induction Study. The use of this strategy by the 
Applicant in view of having an adequate sample size to evaluate efficacy in the maintenance 
setting is acknowledged by the CHMP.  
The “enrichment design” of the study (week 6), allowing only responders to enter the double-
blind maintenance phase, is acknowledged as it is commonly adopted in clinical trials conducted 
in IBD setting. The Maintenance Phase began at Week 6, included study drug dosing at Week 6 
and every 4 weeks or 8 weeks thereafter, and concluded with Week 52 assessment. Three 
groups of patients were contained in the Maintenance Phase and they were assigned to 
Entyvio 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/676643/2013

treatments arms on the basis of their induction treatment assignment and response to therapy: 
1)VDZ-treated patients with treatment response at Week 6 of the Induction Phase were 
randomized to receive or VDZ every 4 weeks (ITT population Q4W), or every 8 weeks (ITT 
population Q8W), or placebo (ITT population placebo); 2) VDZ-treated patients with no 
treatment response at Week 6 of the Induction Phase continued treatment with VDZ, 
administered every 4 weeks (maintenance non-ITT population VDZ q4w); 3) patients on double-
blind placebo in the Induction Study continued on double-blind placebo during the Maintenance 
Phase, regardless of treatment response during induction (maintenance non-ITT placebo).  
The different dose regimen (every 4 weeks or 8 weeks) to which patients might have been 
randomized in the maintenance phase gives the opportunity to evaluate additional data and to 
support the choice of the dose regimen. Moreover, a prolonged treatment with VDZ in patients 
not responders at week 6 gives information about the potential gain in efficacy when treatment 
is prolonged beyond 6 weeks.  
The duration of the maintenance phase of the study was from week 6 to 52, whereas EMA 
guideline recommends duration of at least 1 year. To address this deviation the Applicant 
submitted supplemental analyses which were accepted by the CHMP.  
Key inclusion criteria (age, UC diagnosis, UC activity, UC extension, inadequate response or 
intolerance to at least 1 immunomodulators, corticosteroids, and/or a TNFalpha antagonist 
(Infliximab)) are generally in line with those of recent studies conducted on the same category of 
patients.  
The study was designed against placebo, however conventional therapies (5-ASAs, 
corticosteroids, immunomodulators, antibiotics, probiotics, and antidiarrheals) were 
concomitantly administered to patients. The lack of an anti-TNFα compound comparator arm 
represents a limit of the study in consideration of today’s standard of care.  
Primary and secondary objectives of both induction and maintenance studies are clearly stated 
and represent those commonly studied in the UC indication. However, it is noted that in contrast 
with EMA guidelines and with scientific advices, the primary endpoint was the proportion of 
patients with clinical response at week 6 and not with clinical remission. 
The exploratory endpoint, data on sustained response/remission (Partial Mayo score) at every 
visit (from week 6 to week 52), is agreed by the CHMP, since maintenance of remission during 
52 weeks is a relevant secondary endpoint recommended by the EMA guideline. 
The grading for the assessment of rectal bleeding, in the definition of clinical remission, including 
a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 (absence of bleeding) or 1 (minimal bleeding), although not 
required by the EMA guideline is acceptable to the CHMP in view of its common use in clinical 
trials with comparators. 
Although above deviations have been identified from EMA guidance, overall the study design of 
both phases is considered adequate. 
Baseline demographics were similar in the ITT induction and maintenance population (except for 
geographic region in the maintenance study). Overall, the treatment groups were comparable 
with respect to disease characteristics and to the extent and nature of treatment failure to UC 
therapies, baseline UC therapies in both induction and maintenance studies. In the induction 
Entyvio 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/676643/2013 
Page 117/166 
 
  
study, approximately 40% of patients had a history of failure to a TNFα antagonist and a similar 
proportion had failed immunomodulators (without TNFα antagonist failure). Fewer patients failed 
corticosteroids alone (17%). In the maintenance study a reasonable difference was reported in 
the non-ITT Q4W treatment group (e.g. Week 6 non-responders) in which a higher proportion of 
patients who had prior TNFα antagonist failure was recorded (49%, compared to 30%, 35%, and 
32% in the ITT placebo, VDZ Q8W, and VDZ Q4W groups, respectively).  
Taken together the reported characteristics reflect those of the target population of the sought 
indication. 
The large majority of patients concluded the induction study. In the maintenance study 
approximately 50% of VDZ treated and 70% of placebo patients discontinued study treatment 
mainly due to lack of efficacy (54% placebo and 38% VDZ). 
Crohn’s disease 
The pivotal trial for Crohn’s disease included patients with moderate to severe CD and has the 
same design as study C13006. The trials in both indications included subjects who failed or were 
intolerant to immunomodulators or anti-TNF therapy. The posology was the same for all three 
trials with 300mg VDZ at weeks 0, 2 and 6 (induction phase) followed by 300mg every 4 or 
every 8 weeks thereafter until week 52.   
An additional pivotal trial in Crohn’s disease was conducted in predominantly those who had 
failed anti-TNF therapy (75%) which was an induction trial of 10 weeks (C13011) with no 
maintenance phase.  
Following these trials patients could enter into the long-term open label study C13008. 
The claimed indication: “Vedolizumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease who have had an inadequate response with, lost 
response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a tumour necrosis factor-alpha 
antagonist” is based on two phase 3 induction studies, C13007 and C13011 and one phase III 
maintenance study (C13007). These studies are supported by a phase 2 studies (L299-016) and 
two long-term, open-label safety studies with exploratory efficacy endpoints (C13008 and 
C13004). The number of studies and overall the clinical development programme in CD 
indication are considered appropriate.  
The main C13007 Study (phase 3, multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled trial) was designed to include 2 separate phases that were then analyzed as 2 
separate studies (Induction study and Maintenance study). The Applicant’s choice to study under 
two separate trials VDZ efficacy in induction and maintenance setting is in accordance with EMA 
guideline (CPMP/EWP/2284/99 Rev. 1). 
The Induction study was a 6-week trial that included 2 cohorts with same eligibility criteria: 
Cohort 1, in which patients were randomized and treated with double-blind study drug; Cohort 2, 
in which patients were treated with open-label VDZ but were not included in the efficacy 
induction population. The adoption of this strategy, aimed at having an adequate sample size to 
evaluate efficacy in the maintenance setting, is acknowledged. The “enrichment design” of the 
study (week 6) allowing only responders to enter the double-blind maintenance phase is 
commonly adopted in clinical trials conducted in IBD setting.  
Entyvio 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/676643/2013 
Page 118/166 
 
  
The maintenance study included all CD patients (cohort 1 and 2) who completed the induction 
phase: the second phase of the C13007 study started at week 6 and concluded at week 52. 
According to pre-specified criteria, VDZ-treated patients from both cohorts who showed a clinical 
response at week 6 were randomized 1:1:1 to VDZ administered every 4 weeks (Q4W-ITT 
population), VDZ administered every 8 weeks (Q8W-ITT population), or placebo (ITT 
population). 
The different dose regimen (every 4 weeks or 8 weeks) to which patients might have been 
randomized in the maintenance phase gives the opportunity to compare data and support the 
choice of the dose regimen. 
The double blind maintenance phase for the evaluation of remission is not compliant with the 
EMA guideline requiring a minimum duration of 52 weeks. However, the use of disease activity 
data from the first study visit of the long-term safety Study C13008 can supply the missing data 
on remission at week 52, and so this can be accepted.  
The inclusion and exclusion criteria are considered adequate for the target population. However, 
it is noted that: 
•  Among the inclusion criteria, the cut-off chosen for CRP level (>2.87 mg/L) was chosen by 
the Applicant based on the upper limit of normal range of used laboratories. The role of CRP 
as biomarker of disease inflammation in UC and CD patients treated with vedolizumab has 
been discussed and differences have been pointed out with regard to its sensitivity and role 
in the two diseases.  
• 
• 
The absence of mucosal healing data at the enrolment is still considered a weakness of the 
study, since it is a clinical relevant parameter.  
-The adopted definition of inadequate response to immunomodulators is not considered 
appropriate both from a regulatory (EMA CHMP/EWP/18463/2006) as well as from a clinical 
point of view. However, during the procedure, the applicant justified the definitions utilized 
for “inadequate response” and these are accepted by the CHMP.  
•  Definition of failure to infliximab induction treatment was considered inadequate by EMA SA 
(EMEA/H/SA/765/1/FU/2/2010/III) since not in line with recommendations provided in the 
infliximab product information for ulcerative colitis. It was recognized by the Applicant that 
the adoption of this criterion allows the inclusion of patients not “classically” defined as TNF 
alpha non responders. It is noteworthy that information on previous doses of infliximab was 
not collected. However, data coming from the extrapolation of those from C13007 study 
allow concluding that this adopted definition would not favour the active treatment. 
• 
The definition of inadequate response to Adalimumab induction dose treatment (80 
mg/40mg) instead of the proper induction dose (160mg/80mg) was considered 
inappropriate. The Applicant justified the definition of inadequate response to Adalimumab 
induction dose treatment 80 mg/40mg according to SmPC posology labelling. In study 
C13007 roughly 40% (VDZ combined group) of patients previously failed adalimumab 
therapy due to inadequate response. However, it should be considered that in clinical 
practice the high induction dose (160/80mg) is widely used. Moreover, a recent study 
conducted in a nationwide real life cohort of unselected moderately to severe CD patients 
Entyvio 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/676643/2013

• 
• 
reported that 73% of 720 patients started on high dose adalimumab induction (160/80mg) 
(Baert F, J of Crohn’s and Colitis 2013). 
The definition of history of intolerance as the occurrence of a previous infection was not 
agreed. But the issue is considered resolved in view of the limited number of patients and of 
the proportional distributed between vedolizumab and placebo arms.  
The definition of inadequate response to corticosteroids lacks the specification of the time 
interval between the 2 failed attempts of dose tapering. This information was not collected as 
part of the clinical studies. However, the definition used by the applicant can be accepted as 
it is recognized that patients with inadequate response to corticosteroids were limited in 
number and equally distributed between the placebo and the vedolizumab groups across 
studies.  
The study was designed against placebo, however conventional therapies were concomitantly 
administered to patients. The lack of an anti-TNF-alpha compound as comparator arm represents 
a limit of the study in consideration of today’s standard of care.  
The definitions of the primary and secondary endpoints of both induction and maintenance 
studies are in line with previous evidence. Induction study: the two co-primary endpoints are 
acknowledged for their clinical significance and for being in line with regulatory guidelines. The 
main secondary endpoint was aimed to evaluate the efficacy of VDZ treatment on systemic 
inflammatory response (CRP levels). Exploratory analyses of the induction study were aimed to 
evaluate the consistency of the main study endpoints in various subgroups of patients (previous 
exposure or failure to anti TNF-alpha; concomitant therapies) and to correlate two different 
disease activity scores (CDAI and HBI). Maintenance study: the primary and the main secondary 
endpoints of the maintenance study are considered acceptable. Exploratory analyses of the 
maintenance study were aimed at assessing the effect of VDZ maintenance therapy on various 
aspects of clinical response (achievement and durability), on other meaningful clinical aspects. 
Moreover, the study was aimed to correlate CD-associated genetic polymorphisms and serum 
biomarkers with therapeutic response to the drug.  
Although above deviations have been identified from EMA guidance, overall the study design of 
both phases is considered adequate. 
In the ITT Population of the induction study the majority of patients in each group completed the 
induction phase of the study, with similar reasons that led to premature discontinuation. In the 
ITT Population of the maintenance study 47.3% of patients completed the study and the majority 
of patients discontinued due to lack of efficacy (31% and 38% in the Q4W and Q8W, 
respectively). Overall, baseline demographics and disease activity characteristics of the induction 
and maintenance populations were similar among groups and might be considered 
representative of the target population. However, the CHMP noted that in the Induction study, 
about 55% of patients had a CDAI <330 indicating a population with prevalent moderate disease 
activity. In order to clarify if this could represent a selection bias positively influencing efficacy 
results, the Applicant provided the number of patients with baseline CDAI score <220, and the 
number of patients with levels of foecal calprotectin higher than 250 μg/g and/or CRP serum 
concentration higher than 2.87 mg/L in patients with CDAI score higher or lower than 330. The 
data provided supported that the percentage of patients was low and equally distributed in both 
C13007 and C13011 studies.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Ulcerative colitis 
For the UC pivotal study (induction phase) the primary endpoint was the proportion of patients in 
clinical response at week 6. The results were in favour of VDZ with a treatment difference from 
placebo (PLA) of 21.7% (p<0.001). 
The secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients in clinical remission at week 6 
(16.9% in VDZ group vs. 5.4% PLA; p<0.009) and mucosal healing at week 6 (40.9% VDZ 
group vs. 24.8% PLA; p<0.0012). For the induction phase of study C13006 in UC the primary 
and secondary endpoints were clinically and statistically significant demonstrating that VDZ is 
effective in UC induction. Exploratory analysis included assessment of induction endpoint 
comparing those with and without prior anti-TNF failure. These results showed a smaller 
difference between VDZ and PLA in the anti-TNF failure patients (6.6% at week 6) compared 
with those without prior anti-TNF failure (16.5%). However the results were in favour of VDZ 
treatment in the anti-TNF failure group. 
The primary endpoint for the maintenance phase of study C13006 was the proportion of patients 
in clinical remission at week 52 in those on 4 weekly (Q4W) and 8 weekly (Q8W) dosing as 
compared with placebo. Secondary endpoints included the proportion with durable clinical 
response, mucosal healing, remission and reduction in steroid usage at week 52. For the primary 
endpoint of clinical remission at week 52 the differences from placebo were 26.1% in the Q8W 
(p<0.0001), 29.1% in Q4W (p< 0.001). All secondary endpoints for the maintenance phase were 
also met with similar high levels of statistical significance. Multiple additional analyses were 
conducted including clinical remission by study visit which showed that maintenances of 
remission occurred out to week 52 with no reduction in response.  
Exploratory analyses in the maintenance phase also assessed response in those with prior anti-
TNF failure. In keeping with the induction phase, the response and treatment difference was less 
for this group as compared with those without prior anti-TNF failure, but the results were in 
favour of the vedolizumab group. 
Additional endpoints included patient reported outcomes all of which were in favour of 
vedolizumab. For the UC indication the available data support the applicant’s revised proposal to 
wait until week 10 before considering continuation of therapy in anti-TNFα naïve-patients who fail 
to show a response. In patients non responder to anti-TNFα therapy, the option to wait till week 
10 could be clinically relevant.   
The Applicant discussed the proposal to wait until week 14 before considering continuation of 
therapy in UC anti-TNFα naïve-patients who fail to show a respond at week 6 and provided data 
on remission and clinical response on week 6 non responders anti TNF-alpha naïve and TNF-α 
failed patients at week 10 and week 14.  
In the anti TNF-alpha naïve subpopulation, the gain from week 10 to week 14 was of 4.8% in the 
placebo group and of 2.9% in the combined VDZ group on remission and of 7.3% in the placebo 
and of 6.5% in the VDZ combined group on clinical response.

In patients non responder to anti-TNF alpha therapy, the gain from week 10 to week 14 was of 
5.6% in the placebo group and of 2.4% in the combined VDZ group on remission and of 2.8%% 
in the placebo and of 7.5% in the vedolizumab combined group on clinical response. The 
evidence generated from these results was not considered strong enough to maintain the 
previous SmPC proposal in UC patients to wait until week 14 to observe the therapeutic benefit 
and thus treatment continuation. Therefore the Applicant agreed to shorten the time period of 
observation to carefully reconsider continuation of therapy if no evidence of therapeutic benefit is 
observed by Week 10. This is reflected in the product information and agreed by the CHMP.  
Crohn’s disease 
C13007 Induction study (naïve population, second line indication).  
For the Induction phase of C13007 the primary efficacy endpoint (proportions of patients who 
achieved clinical remission at Week 6 (CDAI score ≤ 150 points) was met, 14.5% vedolizumab 
group vs. 6.8% placebo group; difference from placebo 7.8% (p=0.0206; RR 2.1, 95%CI 1.1-
4.2).  
The co-primary efficacy endpoint (enhanced clinical response at Week 6, a ≥100-point reduction 
from baseline in CDAI score) was not met (31.4% vedolizumab group vs. 25.7% placebo group; 
difference from placebo 5.7% - p=0.2322; RR 1.2, 95%CI 0.9-1.7). The results from the co-
primary endpoints are in contrast from a clinical point of view. Data provided by the applicant 
during the procedure excluding from C13007 study 7 patients (2 placebo and 5 vedolizumab) 
who achieved clinical remission at Week 6 but not CDAI-100 response, showed that the gain over 
placebo in terms of clinical remission at week 6 is even smaller than what previously calculated 
(+7.1% at week 6 in the post-hoc analysis versus +7.8% at week 6 in the previous one), and 
consequently also more distant from the effect size considered clinical relevant for the calculation 
of the sample size (~+ 16%). Results of a post-hoc sensitivity analysis excluding these 7 
patients showed that 12.6% of VDZ patients and 5.5% of PLB patients achieved remission at 
week 6. In addition, the placebo response was lower than the expected (6.8% vs. the expected 
21%). This enhances the potential of detecting smaller treatment effect differences as 
statistically significant. 
Subgroup analyses for clinical remission at Week 6 in the C13007 Induction Study ITT population 
according to demographics and disease activity characteristics were not impressive. In particular, 
the difference between patients with baseline CDAI ≤330 (RR 3.1; 95%CI 1.3, 7.1) and patients 
with baseline CDAI >330 (RR 0.8; 95% CI 0.2.3) could be an explanation of failure of one of the 
primary endpoints. During the procedure, the Applicant provided the forest plot for subgroup 
analyses of enhanced clinical response at Week 6. The relative risk for subgroup analyses of 
enhanced clinical response had the same trend of that for clinical remission but it was closer to 1 
in many subgroups. With regard to CDAI ≤ or ≥330 subgroups, patients having a CDAI score 
≤330 and thus a moderate disease activity had a relative risk favouring vedolizumab whereas 
those having a CDAI ≥330 and thus a severe disease had a relative risk favouring placebo. The 
same trend is noted also for CRP either for values ≤ or ≥ of 5 than for values ≤ or ≥ of 1. Taken 
together, data on enhanced clinical response showed that vedolizumab is more effective in 
patients with moderate disease activity, as shown by both CDAI score and CRP indexes, than in 
those with high disease activity.

The secondary endpoint of the C13007 Induction study (change in serum C-reactive protein 
levels at Week 6) was also not met, showing a median change from baseline at Week 6 in CRP of 
-0.5 mg/L in the placebo treated patients and -0.9 mg/L in the VDZ treated patients. This effect 
on CRP levels could reflect the scarce influence on systemic inflammatory response, which is 
probably due to the mechanism of action of VDZ.  
Exploratory post-hoc subgroup analyses (Ancillary analyses) showed no clinically meaningful 
differences. In particular, no significant differences were found in the remission rates when the 
analysis was performed in patients who received prior/failed TNFalpha antagonist.  
Exploratory analyses examined the effects of concomitant corticosteroids and immunomodulators 
on induction of remission with vedolizumab. Combination treatment, most notably with 
concomitant corticosteroids, appeared to be more effective in inducing remission in Crohn’s 
disease than vedolizumab alone or with concomitant immunomodulators, which showed a smaller 
difference from placebo in the rate of remission. Clinical remission rate in GEMINI II at Week 6 
was 10% (difference from placebo 2%, 95% CI: -6, 10) when administered without 
corticosteroids compared to 20% (difference from placebo 14%, 95% CI: -1, 29) when 
administered with concomitant corticosteroids. In GEMINI III at Week 6 and 10 the respective 
clinical remission rates were 18% (difference from placebo 3%, 95% CI: -7, 13) and 22% 
(difference from placebo 8%, 95% CI: -3, 19) when administered without corticosteroids 
compared to 20% (difference from placebo 11%, 95% CI: 2, 20) and 35% (difference from 
placebo 23%, 95% CI: 12, 33) respectively when administered with concomitant corticosteroids. 
These effects were seen whether or not immunomodulators were also concomitantly 
administered. This information has been included in the SmPC. 
C13011 Induction study (anti-TNFalpha failed population, third line indication) 
C13011 study was the supportive induction study aimed to evaluate VDZ efficacy in a 
subpopulation mostly composed of patients who failed anti-TNFalpha therapy. After completing 
the Week 10 assessments, patients were eligible to enrol in Study C13008 (open-label, long-
term safety study) if study drug was well tolerated, and no major surgical intervention for CD 
occurred or was required. Patients who did not enrol in Study C13008, whether they completed 
Week 10 or withdrew early from the study, were to complete the Final Safety visit (Week 22, or 
16 weeks after the last dose of study drug). In addition, after the end of the study, all patients 
who did not enrol in Study C13008 were to participate in a 2-year follow-up survey.  Additional 
data with the results of the follow-up questionnaires out to June 2013 were provided by the 
applicant. Rates of dysplasia, colon cancer and other malignancies remained low. Rates for 
surgery/colectomy showed no change over time off study.   
With regard to the C13011 Induction study, the primary efficacy endpoint (the proportion of 
patients with clinical remission at Week 6 in the TNFα antagonist failure subpopulation) was not 
met, showing a proportion of VDZ treated patients achieving clinical remission of 15.2% with no 
significant treatment difference from placebo (3.0%). Instead, clinical remission at Week 6 in the 
entire study population (secondary endpoint) was met. 
When Clinical remission was measured at Week 10, a significant proportion of VDZ treated 
patients achieved this endpoint with a similar treatment difference from placebo in both the TNF 
alpha antagonist failure subpopulation (14.4%) and entire study population (15.5%). This result 
might suggest the need of an additional treatment dose (i.e. week 0, 2 and 6) and a longer time 
(10 weeks) of follow-up in order to observe a clinically relevant benefit.

Assessment report

Page 123/166 
 
  
Sustained clinical remission in the TNFα antagonist failure subpopulation was not met, whereas 
enhanced clinical response at Week 6 in the TNF alpha antagonist failure subpopulation was 
statistically significant in VDZ treated patients and increased over time (difference from placebo 
at week 6: 16.9%; difference form placebo at week 10: 22.0%).  
In the TNFα Antagonist Failure ITT Subpopulation, 12.0% of VDZ-treated patients and 8.3% of 
placebo-treated patients achieved sustained clinical remission; the treatment difference from 
placebo was 3.7%. In the Overall ITT Population, 15.3% of VDZ-treated patients and 8.2% of 
placebo-treated patients achieved sustained clinical remission; the treatment difference from 
placebo was 7.0%. The reasons for the difference in response between the overall ITT population 
and the anti-TNF failure are not known. Whether this is due to the VDZ effect requiring longer in 
the anti-TFNα failure patients is unclear although those with anti-TFNα failure often to have more 
long-standing and more severe disease. Those with shortest duration of disease had a largest 
treatment effect as compared with placebo, which could in part explain the difference in the anti-
TFNα failure group and the overall group. During the procedure, the applicant provided evidence 
that there was no impact of disease location in terms of efficacy responses to VDZ. 
Taken together, the main findings of C13011 induction studies are considered of weak-moderate 
clinical relevance. 
Further evidence was provided by the Applicant to support a possible indication in third line 
(after both conventional therapy and anti-TNFalpha) e.g. week 6 compared to week 10 data on 
clinical remission in TNFα antagonist failure patients of Study C13007 and study C13011 and the 
indication for 3rd line in CD is considered acceptable particularly in view of the recognized unmet 
need, since no therapeutic alternatives are at present available in this anti-TNF alpha failed 
population. However, changes and specifications on the proposed posology have been 
implemented by the applicant in particular if no evidence of therapeutic benefit is observed by 
Week 14 then therapy should not be continued. This was agreed by the CHMP. 
C13007 Maintenance study (naïve population, second line indication) 
In the C13007 maintenance study, the primary endpoint (the proportion of patients with clinical 
remission at Week 52) was met, with a significant treatment difference from placebo (Q8W arm: 
17.4% ((p = 0.0007), with a relative risk of 1.8 (95% CI: 1.3, 2.6)); Q4W arm: 14.7%) in 
favour of VDZ treated patients. The stratification of patients at week 6 by response status and 
not by remission status led to an imbalance, in terms of clinical remission, across different 
treatment groups with the highest proportion of patients in response in the placebo group. The 
above mentioned imbalance could have impacted on results.  
Subgroup analyses of both Q4W and Q8W regimens, conducted according to demographic 
variables and disease characteristics, showed similar results. Many differences had a CI crossing 
the 0 and some of them supported results in contrast with a clinical expectation (i.e. for disease 
duration >7 years VDZ Q4W seems to give better results than for shorter disease duration; 
patients with CDAI at baseline >330 seem to have a better outcome if treated with Q8W 
regimen). Overall these results should only be considered exploratory and it is not possible to 
draw supplementary indication on particular subgroups that may benefit from VDZ treatment.  
The proportion of patients with enhanced clinical response at Week 52 was one of the secondary 
endpoints and it was met with a significant treatment difference from placebo of 13.4% in Q8W 
Entyvio 
Assessment report

arm and 15.3% in Q4W arm. Subgroup analyses showed CI often crossing the boundary and no 
meaningful differences between the 2 treatment arms were noted. Ancillary analysis of durability 
of clinical response (i.e. durability and enhanced durability of clinical response at Week 52) were 
consistent with results obtained from clinical response at 52 days showing always higher and 
almost always significant better results in both VDZ Q4W and Q8W treatment groups as 
compared to placebo group.  
The proportion of patients, with corticosteroids at week 6, in corticosteroid-free clinical remission 
at Week 52 showed a significant difference from placebo of 15.9% in Q8W arm and 12.9% in 
Q4W arm. Despite the intrinsic limitation of the definition of corticosteroid-free remission (i.e. 
how long the patient should have been off steroid and in remission to meet the endpoint), these 
results should be interpreted as absence of influence of either VDZ maintenance regimen Q4W or 
Q8W on endpoint achievement. Ancillary analysis of clinical remission and corticosteroid-free for 
90 or 180 days at week 52 (patients who were using corticosteroids at baseline) reported a 
greater proportion of patients in remission in those treated with VDZ (significant results only in 
the Q8W group, with a difference from placebo of 14.6%) as compared with patients who 
received placebo.  
A durable remission is the only and ambitious measure (secondary endpoint) of clinical remission 
in the timeframe comprised between week 6 and 52. The proportion of patients in durable clinical 
remission at Week 52 failed to show significant differences among treatment groups, although a 
positive trend is noted in Q8W arm. The Applicant supported the durability of vedolizumab 
efficacy by using less stringent endpoints i.e. CDAI-100 and CDAI-100 at >80% of study visits 
including week 52 and durable clinical remission for ≥60% of study visits including week 52 and 
showing that the number of patients enrolled in C13007 study achieving durable clinical response 
(CDAI-70) and durable enhanced clinical response (CDAI-100) as well as  durable clinical 
remission for ≥60% of study visits was statistically higher in VDZ treated patients when 
compared to placebo.  
In contrast to what was observed in the induction study, significant changes from baseline in CRP 
levels in patients with elevated CRP at baseline were noted in VDZ treated patients with respect 
to placebo. In light of the results obtained from induction and maintenance studies about CRP 
serum concentration the Applicant discussed the role of CRP as a biomarker of disease 
inflammatory activity in CD patients treated with VDZ. The Applicant defined the cut-off of 2.87 
mg/L for CRP based on the upper limit of normal range of used laboratories. The role of CRP as 
biomarker of disease inflammation in UC and CD patients treated with vedolizumab has been 
discussed and differences have been pointed out with regard to its sensitivity and role in the two 
diseases.  
In support of the second line indication the Applicant reported subgroup analysis of naïve anti-
TNF-alpha patients from C13007 and C13011 studies considered either individually or pooled. 
Better results in clinical remission at week 6 were obtained in the naïve population of the C13011 
study than in the C13007 study (difference from placebo 8.2% and 19.2%, NTT 5.2 vs. 12.2). 
The difference in the therapeutic effect of vedolizumab in the 2 studies is rather large. One 
reason could be the different sample size between the two studies. However, similar differences 
are noted also in the response of the placebo group. Data provided by the applicant highlighted 
that baseline disease activity in TNFα antagonist naïve patients was higher in those enrolled in 
Study C13007 than those in study C13011: CDAI score (316.2 and 296.8, respectively), 
Entyvio 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/676643/2013 
Page 125/166 
 
  
percentage of patients with baseline CDAI > 400 (15% and 3%, respectively). Accordingly, also 
baseline inflammatory indexes were higher in TNFα antagonist naïve patients of C13007 when 
compared to those of C13011: baseline CRP mean (SD): 22.6 (27.6) and 15.8 (16.49), 
respectively; baseline fecal calprotectin 1350.6 (2128.80) and 1076 (1572.91), respectively. This 
may limit the reliability of the pooled analysis proposed by the Applicant.  
 The CHMP highlighted that full response to Vedolizumab requires longer treatment periods 
compared to adalimumab and infliximab and that second line treatment with vedolizumab would 
expose patients to longer treatment with an ineffective drug before switching to other treatment 
options compared to what would happen if the second line drug were adalimumab or infliximab. 
The Applicant acknowledged the lower treatment effect of vedolizumab induction therapy in the 
naïve pooled C13007 and C13011 subpopulations when compared with adalimumab 160/80 mg 
induction dose in naïve patients or Infliximab. A similar degree of treatment effect is recognized 
for adalimumab 80/40mg and Vedolizumab 300mg. In order to support a similar treatment effect 
of vedolizumab when compared to adalimumab and Infliximab the Applicant submitted 
comparison data on maintenance of clinical remission in naïve patients for VDZ (week 52), 
adalimumab (week 56) and Infliximab (week 54). Taking into account the limitations of indirect 
comparisons of data across studies with different drugs, the CHMP noted that the adalimumab 
data reported by the Applicant referred to the overall CD population and not to the naïve subset 
of patients to whom the comparison should have been made. When the naïve subgroup of 
adalimumab patients is considered, percentages differ as follow: remission at week 56 PLB 
(12/89) 14%; ADA 40mg eow (36/87) 42% difference from PLB 28; ADA 40mg ew (41/86) 48% 
difference from PLB 36. These data suggest that efficacy rates may be higher in adalimumab 
patients compared to VDZ, though the limitations of cross-trial comparisons must be taken into 
account. The CHMP concluded that in patients with Crohn’s disease, some patients may require 
up to 14 weeks treatment with vedolizumab to achieve remission. Possible explanations include 
the mechanism of action and individual patient disease factors, as this was a very treatment 
experienced population studied. The CHMP therefore requested the inclusion of the following 
information in the SmPC: “Induction of remission in Crohn’s disease may take up to 14 weeks in 
some patients. The reasons for this are not fully known and are possibly related to the 
mechanism of action. This should be taken into consideration, particularly in patients with severe 
active disease at baseline not previously treated with TNFα antagonists”. 
Overall it is recognized that a later effect of vedolizumab treatment when compared to that of 
TNFalpha antagonist could depend on the different mechanism of action of these drugs. In 
particular, for active UC data there is little support for CRP as a useful marker in vedolizumab 
treated patients. On the contrary, CRP could be a useful biomarker in CD patients treated with 
vedolizumab but the evaluation should not be performed at an early time point, but at least 
beyond 6 weeks of therapy.  
Although the numbers were low, in study C13011 a higher response in those with colonic 
involvement as compared with only ileal involvement was noted. In order to understand whether 
the effect of vedolizumab differs between the small and large bowel, the applicant presented the 
efficacy outcomes for induction and maintenance phases for patients from both studies (C13007 
and C13011) by disease location and the data analysis did not reveal any consistent difference in 
efficacy related to disease location.

2.5.4 Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Conclusions on clinical efficacy in Ulcerative colitis 
Results from clinical studies showed a significant efficacy of VDZ in the treatment of adult 
patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate 
response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a tumour 
necrosis factor-alpha antagonist.  Efficacy has been clearly demonstrated for UC in both 
induction and maintenance. There was no difference in results between the Q4W and Q8W 
posology for the maintenance phase. VDZ provides an additional therapy for UC for those who 
have failed previous immunomodulators and to a lesser extent in those who have failed anti-TNF 
therapy.   
On the basis of the whole data set the CHMP considers the benefit of vedolizumab sufficiently 
demonstrated for both UC indications (second and third line). 
Conclusions on clinical efficacy in Crohn’s disease 
For the Induction phase of study C13007 the primary efficacy endpoint (proportions of patients 
who achieved clinical remission at Week 6 (CDAI score ≤ 150 points) was met. The gain over 
placebo (Study C13007) in terms of clinical remission (+7.8% at week 6) was small and and 
lower than that expected (+21%). 
For the maintenance phase of study C13007 the primary endpoint of clinical remission was 
statistically significant. Two out of the three secondary endpoints (enhanced clinical response [≥ 
100-point decrease in CDAI score from baseline] and corticosteroid-free clinical remission at 
Week 52) were also statistically significantly in favour of VDZ. One of the secondary endpoints 
(durable remission) was not met.  
The rationale for the second line indication presented by the Applicant was based on the 
similarity of the patient populations in studies C13007 and C13011 (supporting the validity of 
results obtained in both studies in the overall benefit-risk assessment), the favourable safety 
profile of VDZ compared to anti-TNFs, the comparability of the efficacy of VDZ with anti-TNF 
drugs (given the limitations of comparing results between studies and the delayed action of 
VDZ), and the overall clinical relevance of the benefits observed for VDZ in terms of the 
proportion achieving remission and the length of time required for this to occur. The CHMP 
concluded that  vedolizumab’s efficacy is greater in the second line indication compared with the 
third line, albeit delayed and possibly less effective compared with anti-TNFalpha drug. The lack 
of systemic immunosuppression, with no cases of extra-pulmonary or systemic TB with VDZ in 
contrast to anti-TNFs, and the long-lasting efficacy in those who respond, combine to make VDZ 
a useful option for 2nd line CD patients. It is, however, acknowledged that there is extensive 
clinical experience with anti-TNFs in CD and the side effect profile is more comprehensive than is 
currently available for VDZ.  
Evidence was provided by the Applicant to support an indication in third line (after both 
conventional therapy and anti-TNFalpha). The data showed that clinical remission and clinical 
enhanced response in the anti TNF failure populations of both C13011 and C13007 studies 
showed small effect of vedolizumab over placebo at Week 6 (6.2% and 0.9%, respectively) but 
greater percentages at Week 10 with a gain over placebo in remission of 7.4% (C13007) and 
14.4% (C13011) and in enhanced response of 16.3% (C13007) and 22% (C13011). This 
Entyvio 
Assessment report

Page 127/166 
 
  
 
indication for 3rd line in CD is therefore considered acceptable by the CHMP particularly in view of 
the recognized unmet need, since no therapeutic alternatives are at present available in this 
anti-TNF alpha failed population.  
Therapy for patients with Crohn’s disease should not be continued if no evidence of therapeutic 
benefit is observed by Week 14 as mentioned in the product information. 
Exploratory analyses also suggested that vedolizumab administered in patients without 
concomitant corticosteroid treatment may be less effective for induction of remission in Crohn’s 
disease than in those patients already receiving concomitant corticosteroids. As requested by the 
CHMP, this information is reflected in the product information. 
2.6 Clinical safety 
The focus of the safety evaluation is on data from the placebo-controlled 52-week 
induction/maintenance studies (C13006 conducted in patients with UC and C13007, conducted in 
patients with CD) and from an ongoing open-label, single arm, extension study C13008 
(conducted in patients with UC or CD). The dose level studied in all the phase III studies was 300 
mg fixed dose.  
Safety data coming from phase I and phase II studies conducted both in patients and in healthy 
volunteers have not been included in the safety evaluation.

Study 13008 
Study C13008 is an ongoing, multinational, single-arm, open-label phase 3 study evaluating the 
long-term safety of VDZ in patients with moderate to severe UC or CD. For Study C13008, all 
AEs were summarized from the first dose of study drug in Studies C13004, C13006, C13007, and 
C13011 for the patients who received VDZ. AEs were counted during the time of active drug 
administration, including a pre-specified follow-up after the fixed dose of study drug. For 
example, AEs for patients who received VDZ in the Induction Phase and placebo in the 
Maintenance Phase of Studies C13006 and C13007 were counted if the AE occurred between the 
first dose and the last dose of the Induction Phase plus 4 weeks (i.e., through Week 6), and at 
any time during Study C13008. AEs were not counted during the time of placebo administration. 
SAE collection continues through the Final Safety visit (16 weeks after the last on-study dose of 
VDZ). The addition of 16 weeks accounts for the known duration of detectable VDZ serum 
concentrations after the last dose. 
For study C13008 the Safety Population (used for the safety analysis) is defined as all patients 
who participated in Studies C13004, C13006, C13007, or C13011 and who received any amount 
of VDZ in this study.  
AEs following re-exposure to VDZ were analyzed in patients who responded to VDZ during the 
Induction Phase of Studies C13006 and C13007, were randomized to placebo during the 
Maintenance Phase, and were subsequently re-exposed to VDZ after entering Study C13008 
(maintenance ITT placebo group). 
Patients without prior treatment with VDZ were also enrolled in Study C13008 (i.e., de novo 
patients). There were no deaths reported in any de novo patient from study entry through 20 
October 2012 or in any rollover patient from 16 July 2012 (cut-off date for the safety analysis) 
through 20 October 2012. 
Ongoing Poststudy, Long-term Follow-up Survey 
Since 2007, all subjects who participated in a VDZ clinical trial are to complete a 2-year 
telephone follow-up survey from the date of last dose of study drug. A questionnaire is 
administered via telephone at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after the final dose of study drug, and it 
requests information on: pregnancy, infections, colorectal dysplasia or cancer, lymphoma, any 
other type of cancer, IBD-related surgeries, and the development of PML. 
As of 08 November 2012, 1289 of 1694 (76%) patients provided responses to at least 1 post-
study follow-up survey after participating in Study C13001, C13002, C13004, C13005, C13006, 
C13007, C13008, C13009, C13010, C13011, C13012, or C13013.  Additional data with the 
results of the follow-up questionnaires out to June 2013 were provided by the applicant during 
the procedure. 
The safety populations analyzed in the present Assessment Report are the following: 
• 
• 
The UC induction/maintenance safety population includes safety data across the Induction 
and Maintenance Phases of Study C13006.   
The overall UC safety population includes safety data from Studies C13002, C13004, 
C13006, and C13008. For a patient who participated in multiple studies (e.g., participated in

Studies C13002, C13004, and C13008), all safety data during VDZ exposure are combined 
for the patient. 
The CD induction safety population includes safety data from the Induction Phase of Study 
C13007 and from Study C13011. 
The CD induction/maintenance safety population includes safety data across the Induction 
and Maintenance Phases of Study C13007. 
The overall CD safety population includes safety data from Studies C13004, C13007, 
C13011, and C13008. For a patient who participated in multiple studies (e.g., participated in 
Studies C13007 and C13008), all safety data during VDZ exposure are combined for the 
patient. 
The overall UC and CD safety population includes safety data from Studies C13002, C13004, 
C13006, C13007, C13011, and C13008.  
The long-term safety of VDZ in patients with UC or CD includes data from the ongoing, 
single-arm extension Study C13008. Most patients in Study C13008 had participated in a 
qualifying VDZ study (Studies C13002, C13004, C13006, C13007, and C13011). The protocol 
was amended in February 2012 to allow enrolment of UC and CD patients without previous 
VDZ treatment (de novo patients). Because enrolment of de novo patients did not begin until 
May 2012, safety data from these patients in Study C13008 are not included in the SCS.  
In order to provide a comparison between placebo and continuous VDZ exposure, the safety 
evaluation focuses on two groups:  
patients who received placebo during induction and maintenance (non-ITT placebo)  
combined VDZ group: patients who received VDZ during induction and maintenance 
(patients who responded to VDZ induction treatment and were randomized to double blind 
VDZ Q8W or Q4W dosing in maintenance and patients who did not respond to VDZ induction 
treatment and were assigned to open-label VDZ Q4W dosing in maintenance.  
The safety issues of special interest related to VDZ mechanism of action include infections, 
malignancies and PML. The most frequently reported AEs in both patients with UC and patients 
with CD were gastrointestinal events and infections. No PML cases were reported. 
The safety profile of similar medicinal products (anti TNF alpha agents) is almost overlapping 
with that of VDZ, although for VDZ TBC cases were new infections and no cases of extra-
pulmonary TB nor disseminated TB were noted and, at present, no cases of PML with VDZ are 
reported probably due to the different selectivity in the mechanism of action when compared to 
natalizumab.  
Patient exposure 
As of 16 July 2012 (cut-off date for safety data for the MAA) a total of 2708 patients had 
received at least one dose of VDZ (1089 patients with UC, 1619 patients with CD). Patients were 
exposed to VDZ for a mean of 430 days in phase 3 studies combined. Across all phase 2 and 
phase 3 clinical studies, 1195 patients were exposed for ≥12 months and 502 patients were 
exposed for ≥24 months. 621 patients with either UC or CD received ≥ 24 infusions, and 125 
received ≥ 36 infusions.

Overall Safety Population: Exposure to VDZ by Month  
Discrete intervals analysis 
To analyze safety in patients receiving VDZ over time, an analysis was conducted of events that 
occurred at discrete intervals of 3 to 6 months. These analyses were conducted in the UC overall 
safety population, CD overall safety population, and UC and CD combined overall safety 
population. For each PT within each time interval, the AE rate was calculated as the number of 
patients for whom the onset of the AE was within the time interval divided by the number of 
patients who started the time interval.  
Adverse events 
An overall summary of AEs for the UC (Study C13006) and CD (Study C13007) 
induction/maintenance patient populations is presented in the following Tables.

CD (Induction/Maintenance patient population Study C13007) 
Gastrointestinal events (mostly worsening of the underlying CD or UC and other gastrointestinal 
events potentially related to underlying disease) occurred with similar frequency in UC and CD 
patients and in the combined VDZ and non-ITT placebo treatment groups. A post-hoc analyses 
was conducted by removing AEs in the gastrointestinal system organ class (SOC). This resulted 
in increased frequency of all other AEs, whereas the rates of SAEs and AEs leading to 
discontinuation substantially decreased. 
UC: Drug-related AEs were approximately 30% of all AEs in all groups, with the exception of the 
maintenance non-ITT placebo group (23%), as expected. Excluding gastrointestinal AEs, less 
than 5% of AEs accounted for drug discontinuation, independently of dose regimen. The inclusion 
of gastrointestinal AEs, importantly increased the discontinuation rate (double or even more), 
indicating a lack of efficacy particularly in the placebo groups ITT and non-ITT. AEs and deaths in 
patients who discontinued were not relevant and almost similarly distributed. 
CD: The incidence of AEs was higher in CD patients than UC patients. Including gastrointestinal 
disorders, AEs were 36% in the overall VDZ group vs. 26% in the non-ITT placebo group. SAEs 
were 7 vs. 11% in the non-ITT placebo and VDZ combined group respectively, but the frequency 
was more than double when gastrointestinal disorders were considered: 16% and 24% in the 
non-ITT placebo and VDZ combined group respectively. Of these, most resulted in the 
discontinuation of the drug. 
AEs by SOC UC: With regard to AEs by SOC, the main difference is noted in the SOC of 
infections and infestations with the highest difference (11%) in the vedolizumab combined group 
(42%) versus non-ITT placebo group (31%), and with higher rates in VDZ Q8W versus Q4W 
(51% versus 45%). A smaller difference between VDZ combined and non-ITT placebo group is 
noted in the following SOCs: skin disorders 6%, cardiac disorders 3%, psychiatric disorders 3%, 
nervous system disorders 2%. No difference is reported in the SOC of blood disorders.  
AEs by SOC CD: There were fewer infections and infestations reported in the VDZ combined 
group (39%) compared with the non-ITT placebo group (44%).  
Entyvio 
Assessment report

Page 132/166 
 
  
 
Another difference of note concerns Respiratory disorders that were more frequent in the VDZ 
combined group (12%) as compared to non-ITT placebo (7%)  
Blood disorders were similarly reported across vedolizumab treated patients and placebo 
patients.   
With regard to extra intestinal manifestations, the most common SOC was muscoloskeletal and 
connective disorders which was higher in CD patients VDZ treated as compared to UC patients 
(44% vs. 22%). Indeed, eye disorders were similarly reported in both CD and UC but mostly 
described in VDZ treated patients (9%vs 4%).  
AE BY PT UC (Induction/Maintenance patient population Study C13006) 
In the UC Induction/Maintenance safety population (Study C13006), the most common AEs by 
Preferred Term (occurring in at least 3% of patients) are summarized by frequency and incidence 
density in the following tables taking into account the maintenance ITT and non ITT safety 
populations, respectively.

In UC patients, among the AEs by PT reported in >3%, the following are of note: 
•  Respiratory infections (combining together nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract and 
bronchitis): 25% in VDZ combined group (with no difference between dose regimens) vs. 
15% in non-ITT placebo (delta 10%); 
•  Colitis ulcerative slightly higher in the non-ITT placebo group (19%) than in the VDZ 
combined group (16%), suggesting a lack of efficacy; 
•  Headache more common in the VDZ combined group (13%) than in non-ITT placebo group 
(9%). 
The comparison of AEs by incidence density was similar to the comparison of frequencies. 
AE by PT CD (Induction/Maintenance patient population Study C13007) 
For the CD induction/maintenance safety population, the most common AEs by preferred term 
(occurring in at least 3% of patients in the combined VDZ group) are summarized by frequency 
and incidence density for the ITT placebo, non-ITT placebo, and combined VDZ groups in the 
following Tables taking into account the maintenance ITT and non ITT safety populations, 
respectively: 
Entyvio 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/676643/2013 
Page 134/166 
 
  
 
 
 
 
In CD patients, the most common AEs by PT reported in the combined VDZ group were CD, 
arthralgia and pyrexia. 
Infections combined together (nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract bronchitis, sinusitis and 
urinary tract infections) occurred in 30% of VDZ combined group and in 20% of non-ITT placebo 
group with a difference of 10%. 
AEs (occurring in at least 3% of patients in the combined VDZ group) higher in VDZ group were 
CD (delta 4% compared to non-ITT placebo) and fatigue (delta 4% compared to non-ITT 
placebo) while abdominal pain was higher (delta 4% compared to non-ITT placebo) in the 
placebo group. It is of note that the definition used by the Applicant for mild intensity of an AE 
(=Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated) appears entirely subjective and different 
Entyvio 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/676643/2013 
Page 135/166 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
from the definition of the CTCAE Version 4.0, that requires the absence of intervention 
(=Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not 
indicated). 
Apart from this limitation, safety data showing a homogeneous distribution of AE by severity 
between VDZ treated patients and placebo group in both diseases are reassuring. 
Taking into account the above mentioned limitation, approximately 30% of SAEs in UC and 25% 
of SAEs in CD were graded as mild, while 50% of SAEs in UC and 45% of SAEs in CD as 
moderate. Homogeneous distribution by severity was noted across all groups.  
Severe SAEs accounted for 10% in UC and 18-19% in CD in both VDZ combined and placebo 
non-ITT population groups. 
The most commonly reported SAEs in both diseases are gastrointestinal disorders, suggesting 
limited efficacy of the study drug, and infections which is well known to be an AE of special 
interest for VDZ as well as for biological agents used in IBD treatment. 
In general, there was no clinically meaningful increase in the commonly reported AEs (≥5% of 
VDZ-treated patients) with continued VDZ treatment through 36 months.  
Adverse Events of special interest:  
AEs of special interest were selected based on the mechanism of action of VDZ, anticipated risks 
associated with study drug exposure, and known co-morbidities that occur in patients with IBD.  
AEs of special interest included infection AEs, gastrointestinal AEs, malignancies, nervous system 
AEs, and infusion-related AEs. 
Infections UC: The proportion of patients with at least 1 infection in induction/maintenance 
safety population was higher in the combined VDZ groups (42%) compared to non-ITT placebo 
group (31%) with a delta of 10%. Moreover, differences among dosing regimens were noted (ITT 
VDZ Q8W 51%, ITT VDZ Q4W 45% and non-ITT VDZ Q4W 39%) with the highest reported in the 
Q8w group.  
The most common infections according to HLT were: upper respiratory tract infections (VDZ 
combined group 25 and non–ITT placebo 15) which are the most commonly reported also in anti-
TNFalfa agent patients and in general in patients treated with immunomodulant therapies; 
gastrointestinal infections (considered grouped: 24 in the combined VDZ and 4 in non-ITT 
placebo) which are related to the underlying disease. Two sepsis (1 patient each in the non-ITT 
placebo and combined VDZ groups) and no TB cases were reported.  
Concomitant corticosteroids and/or immunomodulators did not significantly increase rates of 
infection.  
The majority of Clostridium difficile, candida, herpes infections, although not severe in intensity, 
were reported in VDZ treated groups with similar frequency in Q8W and Q4W dose regimens. 
In the overall safety population, commonly reported infections (i.e Upper respiratory tract 
infections, Lower respiratory tract and lung infections, Abdominal and gastrointestinal infections) 
did not increase with exposure to VDZ through 36months. In this population, one case of TB 
considered as primary is reported.   
Entyvio 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/676643/2013 
Page 136/166 
 
  
 
Infections CD: In the overall CD safety population, the distribution of AEs according to HLT in 
the SOC of infections and infestations was similar to that observed in UC patients. The most 
common were: respiratory infections (combined upper and low) 29% in the VDZ combined group 
and 23% in the non-ITT group; gastrointestinal 8% in the VDZ combined group and infections 
5% in the non-ITT group. For these infections an increase is noted in the Q4W group.  
Concomitant corticosteroids and/or immunomodulators did not significantly increase rates of 
infection.  
Serious infections were reported in 45/814 patients (6%) of VDZ combined group and 4/148 
(3%) of non-ITT placebo group.  
The main SAEs grouped for clinical categories were reported in VDZ treated patients: abscess at 
any site (total of 30, 25 VDZ and 5 PLB), gastrointestinal infections (total of 7, all VDZ), sepsis 
(total of 6, 5 VDZ and 1 PLB). The occurrence of abscess and gastrointestinal infections are 
related to clinical complications of CD. It is of note that the number of sepsis cases is higher than 
that observed in UC. Moreover, the great majority of Clostridium difficile, Candida and Herpes 
Infections were reported in the VDZ treated patients and with a higher rate when compared to 
UC patients. The commonly reported infections as well as serious adverse events by SOC did not 
increase at discrete 3 or 6 month intervals through 36 months, the majority occurred within 12 
months. 
Three TB cases considered related to the study drug were reported in the overall safety 
population.  
GI events: The majority of gastrointestinal events are consistent with the underlying disease.  
Malignancies: Patients with IBD are at increased risk for colorectal cancer. A population-based 
study from Sweden estimated that the overall risk of colorectal cancer in inflammatory bowel 
disease (IBD) was 95 cases per 100,000 (Söderlund S, et al. Gastroenterology 2009). The risk of 
colorectal cancer in patients with UC appears to have decreased over time but it is unclear if this 
is due to improved medical therapy and dysplasia surveillance. The risk is related to the duration 
and anatomic extent of the disease 
In UC, the approximate cumulative incidence of CRC is 5 to 10% after 20 years and 12 to 20% 
after 30 years of disease but active surgical approach in medical treatment failures and long-
term use of 5-ASA drugs may have reduced the incidence. The risk of CRC in longstanding CD 
involving the colon is probably comparable to UC. However, not all studies reached these 
conclusions and thus the magnitude of risk in patients with CD remains unsettled. The severity of 
inflammation may also be an important marker of risk.  
In the overall population, the reported cases of colon cancer (3 in UC study, 1 in CD study and 1 
in the Long-Term Safety Study C13008) were all described after a mean of 9 years after 
diagnosis.  
For all these colon cancer reported cases the Applicant provided, during the procedure, previous 
exposure to Immunomodulators and anti-TNFalpha therapies. One patient with CD and 3 patients 
with UC were diagnosed with colon cancer (one of whom diagnosed with metastases to the 
peritoneum). 2 patients previously to VDZ received both AZA/ 6MP and infliximab and 1 each 
Entyvio 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/676643/2013 
Page 137/166 
 
  
received AZA/ 6MP or infliximab alone. One patient received AZA 75 mg for 38 weeks 
concurrently to VDZ.  
Nervous system (PML) 
As natalizumab, an integrin antagonist indicated for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (in EU 
and USA) and CD (in USA) is associated with an increased risk of PML, natalizumab exposed 
population has been used as a benchmark to estimate the risk of PML in VDZ exposed patients. 
Three cases of PML out of 3116 treated patients (1/1000) were observed in the clinical trial 
setting with natalizumab. Following the initial identification of natalizumab’s association with PML 
risk, three factors have been identified as increasing the risk of PML in natalizumab treated 
patients: positive anti-JC virus antibody status, prior use of immunosuppressants and increased 
duration of natalizumab treatment (especially beyond two years). The incidence of PML in 
natalizumab treated patients in the post-marketing setting is continuously increasing likely due 
to the increasing patient years of exposure to Tysabri with a greater proportion of the overall 
Tysabri-treated population reaching Tysabri exposures of ≥ 2 years.  
As of February 2012, the estimated incidence of PML with natalizumab treated patients reaches 
11.1/1000 in the highest risk patients group (JCV positive patients, exposed to Tysabri between 
25 and 48 months, with prior immunosuppressant use). 
The Applicant proposed a first PML risk evaluation comparing PML incidences between 
natalizumab and VDZ based on boundaries of confidence intervals. This method does not take 
into account different treatment duration between post-marketing data and clinical trial data. By 
applying incidence of PML derived from natalizumab trial data (incidence 1/ 1000; CI95% 0.2-
2.8), a huge number of patients would be necessary to demonstrate an inferior risk with an 
upper bound lower than 0.20. The second method proposed by the Applicant takes into account 
stratification by risk factors in estimating the incidence of PML. Using PML incidence in 
natalizumab treated patients stratified by risk factors, the expected cases of PML in VDZ clinical 
trial program is 5.17. The probability of observing 0 cases, corresponding to the above expected 
number, is 0.0057, showing that PML risk is significantly lower than with natalizumab.  
Cardiovascular AEs 
Cardiac AEs for the maintenance studies in both UC and CD showed a higher rate in the VDZ 
groups (4%, 3% respectively) compared with placebo (1%).   
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
UC: Overall in Study C13006, 11% of patients in the non-ITT placebo, 16% of patients in the ITT 
placebo and 12% in the combined VDZ group reported at least 1 SAE. 
The frequency of SAEs was higher (15%) in patients who had not responded to VDZ during 
induction (non-ITT VDZ Q4W dose group) than in the ITT VDZ Q8W and in the ITT VDZ Q4W.  
SAEs resulting in study discontinuation were higher in the ITT placebo (=patients who received 2 
doses of VDZ during induction and placebo during maintenance) patients (6%) compared to 
those in the combined VDZ group (3%). The most common SAEs were in the SOC of Infections 
and infestations and the gastrointestinal disorders  
Entyvio 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/676643/2013 
Page 138/166 
 
  
 
 
CD: SAEs were reported with the highest percentage in the combined VDZ group (24%) and with 
similar frequency in the ITT placebo and non-ITT placebo groups (15% and 16%, respectively). 
Among VDZ treatment groups a higher frequency (29%, delta of 10 when compared to other 
groups) of SAEs was observed in patients who failed to respond to VDZ at Week 6. 
As previously reported, SAEs that occurred most frequently in the CD induction/maintenance 
safety population were in the gastrointestinal disorders SOC probably due to lack of efficacy. 
Concomitant medications did not negatively influence SAEs occurrence.  
The frequency of SAEs with continued VDZ treatment did not significantly increased through 36 
months. 
Deaths 
A total of 12 deaths were reported, 4 in UC patients (all classified by investigator as not related) 
of which 1 in C13006 and 3 in C13008 studies and 8 in CD patients of which 5 in C13007 and 3 
in C13008 studies. 
Post studies deaths: 
In the vedolizumab clinical program there were 9 post study deaths as of 14 March 2013. There 
were 2 post study deaths in Study C13006, 1 post study death in Study C13007 and C13004 and 
5 post study deaths in Study C13008. The time from last dose of study drug ranged from 140 
days to 659 days. Sepsis was reported in a total of 3 subjects which was the most common PT 
related to the fatalities. Malignancies occurred in 2 of the deaths and the remaining 4 deaths 
were single events. Of the 9 deaths, 2 deaths were considered related to vedolizumab. 
Listing 139.a Deaths Occurring Following Completion of or Withdrawal From 
Participation in Vedolizumab Clinical Studies 
All deaths occurred more than 140 days from the last dose of vedolizumab. The two cases which 
were considered as related are both UC patients with colon cancer. None of the post-study 
deaths can be ascribed with any reasonable degree of certainty to vedolizumab.  An open

question is whether vedolizumab could play a role in accelerating tumour growth or in the long-
term be associated with an increased incidence of colonic carcinoma.  This question would be 
difficult to assess in view of the fact that UC has an increased incidence of colonic carcinoma and 
many patients had been pre-treated with potent immunosuppressives before receiving 
vedolizumab. It will be necessary for continued collection of data over time to address the 
possible risk as described in the RMP. 
Laboratory findings 
UC: The most common laboratory abnormality was absolute lymphocyte count <0.5×109/L. In 
the UC induction/maintenance safety population, 5 patients (3%) from the non-ITT placebo 
group and 31 patients (5%) in the combined VDZ group. Of patients having absolute lymphocyte 
counts <0.3 × 109/L only one who received VDZ experienced upper respiratory tract infection. No 
important difference was noted in leukocyte count. Other hemocromocytometric parameters such 
as haemoglobin and platelets were not importantly affected. A numerically higher number of VDZ 
treated patients experienced increased levels of the pancreatic enzyme lipase (i.e. lipase >2 
UNL: 3 non-ITT placebo 12 VDZ combined), prolongation of coagulation time (i.e. PT>1.25 UNL: 
8 non-ITT placebo 26 VDZ combined). However, a higher frequency was reported in non-ITT 
placebo group probably due to the different size of placebo non-ITT and VDZ combined groups.  
CD: Similarly to patients affected by UC, in CD patients the most common laboratory finding was 
lymphocyte count (<0.5×109/L). In the CD induction/maintenance safety population, 13 patients 
(9%) from the non-ITT placebo group and 39 patients (5%) in the combined VDZ group. Of 
these patients 6 patients had an absolute lymphocyte counts <0.3 × 109/L (1 ITT placebo, 1 non-
ITT placebo, and 4 combined VDZ), reporting 2 SAE (one C. difficile colitis in the VDZ group and 
one anal abscess in the non-ITT placebo).  
More than in UC patients, in CD patients a numerically higher number of patients experienced 
increased levels of liver transaminases or pancreatic enzymes (i.e. amylase >2 UNL: 4 non-ITT 
placebo 13 VDZ combined; lipase >2 UNL: 3 non-ITT placebo 16 VDZ combined), prolongation of 
coagulation time (i.e. PT>1.25 UNL: 4 non-ITT placebo 33 VDZ combined). However, no 
significant difference was reported in terms of frequencies between groups or even better in non-
ITT placebo probably due to the different size of placebo non-ITT and VDZ combined groups.  
Vital signs: Data from induction/maintenance UC and CD studies as well from the long term 
safety C13008 study do not report significant abnormal ECG findings.  
A similar incidence of ECG abnormalities in VDZ and in placebo treated patients was noted. Some 
non-specific ECG findings not related to QT changes were observed in patients treated with VDZ.  
Overall, preclinical and clinical data do not raise any concern on a potential effect of the drug on 
QT interval. 
Safety in special populations 
Overall the analysis of AEs by intrinsic factors such as age, sex, race, creatinine clearance was 
not done due to the small size of included groups.  
Entyvio 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/676643/2013 
Page 140/166 
 
  
 
 
 
 
The Applicant analysed AEs by SOC and HTL according to body weight categories (<70 kg, ≥70 
to ≤90 kg, >90 kg) for the UC and CD combined induction safety population, combined 
induction/maintenance safety population. The analysis of AEs according to body weight category 
did not show clinically important differences in the safety profile between the low (<70 kg) and 
the mid (≥70 to ≤90 kg) weight subgroups. The evaluation of the high weight subgroup (>90 
kg) does not allow to draw conclusions due to the small number of patients in this subgroup 
(approximately 15% of UC and CD patients), especially in the placebo arm.  
Immunological events 
Investigator-defined, infusion-related events in the induction/maintenance safety populations 
occurred as follow: 
UC: in 28 (5%) of 967 patients in the VDZ combined group and 1 patient (<1%) in the non-ITT 
placebo group.  
CD: in 33 (4%) of 967 patients in the VDZ combined group and 8 patients (5%) in the non-ITT 
placebo group.  
The majority of reported reactions were mild or moderate in intensity and few resulted in 
discontinuation of study treatment. One serious event was reported in a CD patient. 
Immunogenicity: The overall HAHA rate in the combined VDZ group was of 4% during treatment. 
Instead the frequency of HAHA increased post treatment (5 half-lives after last dose, 16 weeks) 
and was approximately of 10%. 
Due to small numbers of HAHA positive patients, no firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the 
impact of immunogenicity on the overall efficacy observed in phase 3 studies. 
With regard to safety issues, infusion-related reactions were reported for 61 patients exposed to 
continuous VDZ in the induction/ maintenance Studies C13006 and C13007 of whom a total of 3 
patients were HAHA positive (all had persistent HAHA and 2 had neutralizing antibodies). 
The available data do not support a clear link between HAHA and infusion-related reactions. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Safety related to drug-drug interaction (such as immunosuppressive agents) is not of concern 
with the exception of safety such as infections and infestations or cancer where it is known to 
increase in patient taking immunosuppressant drugs. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The most common AEs leading to discontinuation in both UC and CD patients were due to loss of 
efficacy. A small percentage of patients discontinued due to infections occurrence or to skin 
disorders.

2.6.1 Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety populations from phase III studies included induction and maintenance safety populations 
as well as overall safety populations from Studies C13002, C13004, C13006, C13007, C13011, 
and C13008. Although safety data coming from phase I and phase II studies have been 
submitted by the Applicant, they have not been included in the safety evaluation because they 
represent limited and heterogeneous safety data (short term, different dose regimens, healthy 
subjects, small numbers). 
Across all phase II and phase III trials 1195 patients with UC or CD were exposed to VDZ ≥12 
months and 502 patients were exposed ≥24 months. The number of patients exposed long-term 
is considered adequate. 
The most common AEs by SOC reported in both UC and CD patients were gastrointestinal events 
and infections. Gastrointestinal events (mostly worsening of the underlying CD or UC and other 
gastrointestinal events potentially related to underlying disease) occurred with similar frequency 
in UC and CD patients. 
In UC patients, infections and infestations were reported with the highest difference (11%) in the 
VDZ combined group as compared to non-ITT placebo group, and with higher rates in VDZ Q8W 
versus Q4W (51% versus 45%). Moreover, a smaller difference between VDZ combined and non-
ITT placebo group is noted in the following SOCs: skin disorders 6%, cardiac disorders 3%, 
psychiatric disorders 3%, nervous system disorders 2%. No difference is reported in the SOC of 
blood disorders.  
Infection and infestations in CD patients were reported in 39% of the VDZ combined group and 
in 44% of non-ITT placebo group. Of note are also Respiratory disorders that were more frequent 
in the VDZ combined group (12%) as compared to non-ITT placebo (7%). Blood disorders were 
similarly reported across VDZ treated patients and placebo patients.   
With regard to extra intestinal manifestations, the most common SOC was muscoloskeletal and 
connective disorders which was higher in CD patients VDZ treated as compared to UC patients 
(44% vs. 22%). Eye disorders were similarly reported in both CD and UC but mostly described in 
VDZ treated patients (9% vs. 4%).  
AEs by PT were mostly overlapping between UC and CD patients, with some differences linked in 
part to the underlying disease. In UC patients, among the AEs by PT reported in >3% of VDZ 
treated patients were respiratory infections (combining together nasopharyngitis, upper 
respiratory tract and bronchitis) and headache. In CD patients, the most common AEs by PT 
reported in the combined VDZ group were infections (combined together nasopharyngitis, upper 
respiratory tract bronchitis, sinusitis and urinary tract infections) CD, arthralgia and pyrexia. 
Similar frequencies in PT AEs were reported between the two VDZ dosage regimens, with the 
exception of pyrexia and headache most commonly described in the Q4W regimen.  
No significant differences in the safety profile (AEs distribution according to PT) were highlighted 
combining the C13006 and C13007 studies (total of 1434 patients) as compared to results 
coming from the single studies. The most commonly reported AEs were headache, 
nasopharyngitis, arthralgia. Nasopharyngitis is the most common infection reported in these 
patients. Arthralgia is the most common extra-intestinal manifestation. Headache is highlighted 
as a very common (>1/10) ADR in the product information. Headache frequency did not increase 
Entyvio 
Assessment report

Page 142/166 
 
  
over time with continued VDZ treatment exposure. Only 1 vedolizumab treated patient 
experienced an AE of headache that led to discontinuation. No VDZ treated patients experienced 
a SAE of headache.  
The AEs considered by the investigator related to study drug were those most commonly 
reported in both pathologies. 
Approximately 30% of SAEs in UC and 25% of SAEs in CD were graded as mild while 50% of 
SAEs in UC and 45% of SAEs in CD as moderate. Severe SAEs accounted for 10% in UC and 18-
19% in CD in both VDZ combined and placebo non-ITT population groups.  
The most commonly reported SAEs in both diseases are gastrointestinal disorders, meaning lack 
of efficacy of the study drug, and infections which is well known to be an AE of special interest 
for VDZ as well as for biological agents used in IBD treatment.  
In order to better clarify the reversibility rate of the reported SAE in UC and CD patients, the 
Applicant provided during the procedure, an updated analysis, excluding patients who were 
assigned to placebo after receiving VDZ during induction. The rate of unresolved SAEs was 
comparable amongst patients receiving placebo and VDZ. 
In general, there was no clinically meaningful increase in the commonly reported AEs (≥5% of 
VDZ-treated patients) with continued VDZ treatment through 36 months in both UC and CD 
patients. AEs by months of VDZ exposure showed stable or decreased frequencies through 12 
months with the exception of ulcerative colitis which picked at 6 <12 months, reflecting the loss 
of efficacy.  
Among AEs of special interest in VDZ treated patients are: infections, gastrointestinal disorders, 
nervous system disorders. With the exception of nervous system disorders, these are similar to 
those reported for of anti-TNFalpha drugs.  
In UC patients, the most common infections according to HLT were: upper respiratory tract 
infections which are the most commonly reported also in anti-TNFalpha agent patients and in 
general in patients treated with immunomodulant therapies; gastrointestinal infections which are 
related to the underlying disease. Two sepsis (1 patient each in the non-ITT placebo and 
combined VDZ groups) and no TB cases were reported. Concomitant corticosteroids and/or 
immunomodulators did not significantly increased rates of infection.  
In the overall safety population, commonly reported infections did not increase with exposure to 
VDZ through 36months. In this population, one case of TB considered as primary is reported.  
In CD patients, the distribution of AEs according to HLT in the SOC of infections and infestations 
was similar to that observed in UC patients. The most common were: respiratory infections 
(combined upper and low); gastrointestinal infections. For these infections an increase is noted 
in the Q4W group. Concomitant corticosteroids and/or immunomodulators did not significantly 
increase rates of infection.  
The main infections related SAEs, grouped for clinical categories, were reported in VDZ treated 
patients: abscess at any site, gastrointestinal infections, sepsis (total of 6, 5 VDZ and 1 PLB). 
The occurrence of abscess and gastrointestinal infections are related to clinical complications of 
CD. It is of note that the number of sepsis cases is higher than that observed in UC.  
Entyvio 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/676643/2013 
Page 143/166 
 
  
Moreover, the great majority of Clostridium difficile, Candida and Herpes Infections were 
reported in the VDZ treated patients and with a higher rate when compared to UC patients. The 
commonly reported infections as well as serious adverse events by SOC did not increase at 
discrete 3 or 6 month intervals through 36 months, the majority occurred within 12 months. 
During the procedure the applicant demonstrated that the 4 patients that developed tuberculosis 
during VDZ phase 3 studies all received corticosteroids before study entry (treatment duration 
not known) and 2 received corticosteroids concomitantly with VDZ. Three patients used either 
AZA or 6-MP before study entry (treatment duration not known) and 1 patient used them 
concomitantly with VDZ. One patient had used infliximab more than 60 days before study entry. 
All 4 cases (3 cases of pulmonary TB and 1 case of latent TB, i.e. positive QuantiFERON test) 
appear to be new infections acquired on study, as they all had negative chest X-rays and 
negative QuantiFERON tests at baseline. Vedolizumab is contraindicated in patients with active 
tuberculosis. Before starting treatment with vedolizumab, patients must be screened for 
tuberculosis according to the local practice. This information is reflected in the product 
information. 
The most common reported gastrointestinal AEs in UC patients were colitis (excluding infective), 
nausea and vomiting symptoms. These gastrointestinal events are consistent with the underlying 
UC.  
In the CD induction/maintenance safety population, the most common SAE was Crohn’s disease 
meaning lack of efficacy. These events were potentially related to the underlying disease and 
reported in a higher percentage of patients with CD as compared to those with UC.  
Patients with IBD are at increased risk for colorectal cancer. The risk is related to the duration 
and anatomic extent of the disease. The severity of inflammation may also be an important 
marker of risk.  In the overall population, the reported cases of colon cancer (3 in UC study, 1 in 
CD study and 1 in the Long-Term Safety Study C13008) were all described after a mean of 9 
years after diagnosis. For all these colon cancer reported cases the Applicant provided during the 
procedure, previous exposure to Immunomodulators and anti-TNFalpha. One patient with CD and 
3 patients with UC were diagnosed with colon cancer (one of whom diagnosed with metastases 
to the peritoneum). 2 patients previously to VDZ received both AZA/ 6MP and infliximab and 1 
each received AZA/ 6MP or infliximab alone. One patient received AZA 75 mg for 38 weeks 
concurrently to VDZ.  
Considering that, in UC and CD patients of all severities, colon cancer is more frequently 
observed than in the general population, the possibility of occurrence of cancer with long 
exposure to vedolizumab cannot be excluded. This potential risk is addressed the RMP.  
The most common nervous system events were in the HLT of headaches NEC in both categories 
of patients. The only SAE in the Nervous system disorders SOC that occurred in a UC patient in 
the ITT VDZ Q4W group was syncope and in the CD population one transient ischemic attack 
occurred in a VDZ treated patient. No cases of PML were observed. 
An adequate risk minimization action plan (RAMP algorithm) described in the RMP has been 
implemented in all VDZ clinical trials since 2007 and no PML case has been identified so far. 
Although it is acknowledged that data available up to now seem to indicate that the PML risk with 
VDZ is lower than with natalizumab, a residual risk of PML cannot be completely ruled out, in 
particular due to limited available data on long term treatment effect combined with high 
Entyvio 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/676643/2013 
Page 144/166 
 
  
frequency of prior immunosuppressive use in UC and CD patients (around 80% compared to 
18% of natalizumab patients in the post-marketing setting. Only 1 healthy volunteer in study 
C13013 had a positive finding on the objective PML checklist on two separate occasions. 
Although no PML cases were identified within the vedolizumab clinical studies, PML is identified 
as an important potential risk in the RMP. The post marketing surveillance described in the RMP 
is highly important since this product is likely to be used long term (mean duration of exposure is 
only roughly 1 year in VDZ placebo controlled clinical trial) and there is a high frequency of prior 
immunosuppressive use in UC and CD patients. 
Cardiac AEs for the maintenance studies in both UC and CD showed a higher rate in the VDZ 
groups (4%, 3% respectively) compared with placebo (1%).  Although a direct cardiotoxic effect 
from vedolizumab is not expected based on its structure/function, non-clinical and healthy 
volunteer data, there was some suggestion of an increase in cardiac AEs mainly arrhythmias. 
However, although a slightly higher incidence of cardiac AEs compared to placebo was observed 
in VDZ-subjects with no cardiac history, the rates of cardiac AEs in those with a history of cardiac 
disease or with no cardiac disease but at least one cardiac risk factor were no higher in VDZ-
treated subjects than those treated with placebo, and there was no effect of monthly or 8-weekly 
dosing on the incidence of events.   
SAEs and deaths: The most common SAEs in both UC and CD patients were in the SOC of 
Infections and infestations and the gastrointestinal disorders. Among drug related SAEs there 
were 4 Respiratory SOC disorders (2 patients pulmonary thrombotic and embolic disorders and 2 
patients pulmonary embolism).Two young patients treated with vedolizumab developed 
pulmonary embolism while randomized in Study C13006. Both of these patients had a long 
standing history of moderate to severe UC and treatment with corticosteroids which both may 
increase the risk of developing pulmonary embolism. In addition, one of the patients had a major 
surgery performed before her episode of pulmonary embolism and in the second case the patient 
received 4 additional doses of vedolizumab after the pulmonary embolism was considered 
resolved. The Applicant provided a satisfactory explanation excluding a potential effect of 
vedolizumab on vascular endothelium. 
The frequency of SAEs was slightly higher in patients taking concomitant medications 
(corticosteroids and/or immunomodulators) or in patients who failed a prior anti TNFalpha 
therapy. 
A total of 12 deaths were reported, 4 in UC patients (all classified by investigator as not related) 
of which 1 in C13006 and 3 in C13008 studies and 8 in CD patients of which 5 in C13007 and 3 
in C13008 studies. Patients with CD reported a higher number of deaths than those with UC, with 
the most common cause being sepsis (3 cases out of 8, 2 adjudicated as related to study drug). 
Narratives highlight that sepsis occurred at the time of or following abdominal surgery for CD 
exacerbation/complications or due to devices implantation. It is well known that IBD patients are 
more prone to complications due to immunosuppression in light of the background therapy. No 
cases of death due to colon cancer have been reported during the induction/maintenance 
studies. One case of colon cancer and one of peritoneal carcinomatosis were reported as post 
study deaths. 
Laboratory abnormalities: the most common laboratory abnormality in both UC and CD 
patients was the absolute lymphocyte count <0.5×109/L. In the UC induction/maintenance safety 
Entyvio 
Assessment report

Page 145/166 
 
  
population, this AE affected 5 patients (3%) from the non-ITT placebo group and 31 patients 
(5%) in the combined VDZ group. Of patients having absolute lymphocyte counts <0.3 × 109/L 
only one who received VDZ experienced upper respiratory tract infection. No important 
difference was noted in leukocyte count.  
In the CD induction/maintenance safety population, 13 patients (9%) from the non-ITT placebo 
group and 39 patients (5%) in the combined VDZ group had lymphocyte count <0.5×109/L. Of 
these patients 6 patients had an absolute lymphocyte counts <0.3 × 109/L (1 ITT placebo, 1 non-
ITT placebo, and 4 combined VDZ), reporting 2 SAE (one C. difficile colitis in the VDZ group and 
one anal abscess in the non-ITT placebo).  
In both UC and CD populations, other hemocromocytometric parameters such as haemoglobin 
and platelets were not importantly affected.  
Overall the analysis of AEs by intrinsic factors such as age, sex, race, creatinine clearance was 
not done due to the small size of included groups. With regard to body weight, the Applicant was 
advised by CHMP (2010) to put some emphasis on distinguishing the effect of body size and 
obesity in phase III trials given the clear relationship between body weight and clearance and 
since a flat dose is proposed. The analysis of AEs according to body weight category did not show 
clinically important differences in the safety profile between the low (<70 kg) and the mid (≥70 
to ≤90 kg) weight subgroups. The evaluation of the high weight subgroup (>90 kg) does not 
allow to draw conclusions due to the small number of patients in this subgroup (approximately 
15% of UC and CD patients), especially in the placebo arm. However, among patients receiving 
VDZ in the combined vedolizumab group, the frequency of patients with at least one AE was 
similar across the three subgroups by weight (<70 kg; ≥70 to ≤90 kg; >90 kg).  
Overall higher incidence of AEs (i.e. infections, arthralgia) was associated to patients who 
experienced prior TNFalpha antagonist failure in both UC and CD patient’s populations. 
The overall HAHA rate in the combined VDZ group was of 4% during treatment. Instead the 
frequency of HAHA increased post treatment (5 half-lives after last dose, 16 weeks) and was 
approximately of 10%. 
Infusion-related reactions were reported for 61 patients exposed to continuous VDZ in the 
induction/ maintenance Studies C13006 and C13007 of whom a total of 3 patients were HAHA 
positive (all had persistent HAHA and 2 had neutralizing antibodies). Infusion-related events in 
the induction/maintenance safety populations occurred similarly in VDZ treated patients in both 
UC and CD (5% and 4%, respectively) as compared to non-ITT placebo groups (<1% UC and 5% 
CD). The majority of reported reactions were mild or moderate in intensity and few resulted in 
discontinuation of study treatment. One serious event was reported in a CD patient. The 
recommendations reported product information are agreed by the CHMP. The available data do 
not support a clear link between HAHA and infusion-related reactions. 
The most common AEs leading to discontinuation in both UC and CD patients were due to loss of 
efficacy. A small percentage of patients discontinued due to infections occurrence or to skin 
disorders.

2.6.2 Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of VDZ does not raise major objections and can be considered reassuring in 
both UC and CD indications, although differences between these two pathologies have been 
reported (with higher incidence of AEs in CD).   
AEs of special interest, in particular infections, PML and malignancy will be carefully monitored in 
the post-approval safety studies as described in the RMP.  
Clinical studies showed reassuring data on systemic immunosuppression in terms of response to 
immunization in healthy volunteers or opportunistic infections including PML and TB. However, 
the occurrence rate of these events with long-term exposure and in patients pre-treated with 
anti TNFalpha drugs and/or concomitant immunosuppressants is still not known. This lack of data 
is reflected in the product information and described in the RMP. 
1.4.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the 
legislative requirements.    
1.5.  Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
PRAC Advice 
Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 2.1, the PRAC considers by 
consensus that the risk management system for Entyvio (Vedolizumab) for the treatment: 
• 
• 
of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an 
inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy 
or a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) antagonist 
of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease who have had an 
inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy 
or a TNFα antagonist 
is acceptable with minor revisions in section III of the RMP to ensure consistency throughout the 
RMP in the milestones of the studies described in the PhV Plan. These issues were addressed with 
the submission of version 2.2 of the Risk Management Plan following the PRAC meeting in 
February 2014.  
This advice is based on the following content of the Risk Management Plan:

Administration 
Method of administration 
Entyvio is administered as an 
intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. 
Patients should be monitored during 
and after infusion (see section 4.4) 
SmPC Section 4.3 Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active 
substance or to any of the excipients 
listed in section 6.1 
SmPC Section 4.4 Special Warnings 
and Precautions for Use 
All patients should be observed 
continuously during each infusion. For 
the first two infusions, they should also 
be observed for approximately two 
hours following completion of the 
infusion for signs and symptoms of 
acute hypersensitivity reactions. For all 
subsequent infusions, patients should 
be observed for approximately one 
hour following completion of the 
infusion. 
In clinical studies, infusion-related 
reactions (IRR) and hypersensitivity 
reactions have been reported, with the 
majority being mild to moderate in 
severity (see section 4.8). 
If a severe IRR, anaphylactic reaction, 
or other severe reaction occurs, 
administration of Entyvio must be 
discontinued immediately and 
appropriate treatment initiated (e.g., 
epinephrine and antihistamines) (see 
section 4.3). 
If a mild to moderate IRR occurs, the 
infusion rate can be slowed or

interrupted and appropriate treatment 
initiated. Once the mild or moderate 
IRR subsides, continue the infusion.  
Physicians should consider 
pretreatment (e.g., with antihistamine, 
hydrocortisone and/or paracetamol) 
prior to the next infusion for patients 
with a history of mild to moderate IRR 
to vedolizumab, in order to minimize 
their risks (see section 4.8). 
SmPC Section 4.8 Undesirable Effects 
In GEMINI I and II controlled studies, 
4% of vedolizumab-treated patients 
and 3% of placebo-treated patients 
experienced an adverse event defined 
by the 
investigator as infusion-related 
reaction (IRR) (see section 4.4). No 
individual Preferred Term reported as 
an 
IRR occurred at a rate above 1%. The 
majority of IRRs were mild or 
moderate in intensity and <1% 
resulted in 
discontinuation of study treatment. 
Observed IRRs generally resolved with 
no or minimal intervention following 
the infusion. Most infusion related 
reactions 
occurred within the first 2 hours. Of 
those patients who had infusion related 
reactions, those dosed with 
vedolizumab had more infusion related 
reactions with in the first two hours as 
compared to placebo patients with 
infusion related reactions. Most 
infusion related reactions were no- 
serious and occurred during the 
infusion or within the first hour after 
infusion is completed. 
One serious adverse event of IRR was 
reported in a Crohn’s disease patient 
during the second infusion (symptoms 
reported were dyspnoea, 
bronchospasm, 
urticaria, flushing, rash, and increased 
blood pressure and heart rate) and was 
successfully managed with 
discontinuation of infusion and 
treatment with antihistamine and 
intravenous hydrocortisone. In patients 
who received vedolizumab at Weeks 0 
and 2 followed 
by placebo, no increase in the rate of 
IRR was seen upon retreatment with 
vedolizumab after loss of response.

SmPC Section 4.8 Undesirable effects 
In GEMINI I and II (C13006 and 
C13007) controlled studies, the rate of 
infections was 0.85 per patient-year in 
the vedolizumab-treated patients and 
0.70 per patientyear in the placebo-
treated patients. The infections 
consisted primarily of nasopharyngitis, 
upper respiratory tract infection, 
sinusitis and urinary tract infections. 
Most patients continued on 
vedolizumab after the infection 
resolved. 
SmPC Section 4.4 Special Warnings 
and precautions for use 
Vedolizumab is a gut-selective integrin 
antagonist with no known systemic 
immunosuppressive activity (see 
section 5.1).  
Physicians should be aware of the 
potential increased risk of opportunistic 
infections or infections for which the 
gut is a defensive barrier (see section 
4.8).  
Entyvio treatment is not to be initiated 
in patients with active, severe 
infections until the infections are 
controlled, and 
physicians should consider withholding 
treatment in patients who develop a 
severe infection while on chronic 
treatment with Entyvio. Caution should 
be exercised when considering the use 
of vedolizumab in patients with a 
controlled chronic severe infection or a 
history of 
recurring severe infections. Patients 
should be monitored closely for 
infections before, during and after 
treatment. 
Entyvio is contraindicated in patients 
with active tuberculosis (see section 
4.3). Before starting treatment with 
vedolizumab, patients must be 
screened for tuberculosis according to 
the local practice. If latent tuberculosis 
is diagnosed, appropriate treatment 
must be started with anti-tuberculosis 
treatment in accordance with local 
recommendations, before beginning 
vedolizumab. 
SmPC Section 4.8 Undesirable Effects 
In GEMINI I and II controlled studies, 
the rate of infections was 0.85 per 
patient-year in the vedolizumab-
treated patients and 0.70 per patient-
year in the placebo-treated patients.

The infections consisted 
primarily of nasopharyngitis, upper 
respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, 
and urinary tract infections. Most 
patients continued on vedolizumab 
after the infection resolved. 
In GEMINI I and II controlled studies, 
the rate of serious infections was 0.07 
per patient year in vedolizumab-
treated patients and 0.06 per patient 
year in 
placebo-treated patients. Over time, 
there was no significant increase in the 
rate of serious infections. 
In controlled and open-label studies in 
adults with vedolizumab, serious 
infections have been reported, which 
include tuberculosis, sepsis (some 
fatal), 
salmonella sepsis, listeria meningitis, 
and 
cytomegaloviral colitis. 
Other routine risk minimisation 
measures: 
Entyvio treatment should be initiated 
and supervised by specialist healthcare 
professionals experienced in the 
diagnosis and treatment of ulcerative 
colitis or Crohn’s disease. (SmPC

SmPC Section 4.4  Special Warnings 
and Precautions for Use 
Infections  
Some integrin antagonists and some 
systemic immunosuppressive agents 
have been associated with progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy 
(PML),which is a rare and often fatal 
opportunistic infection caused by the 
John Cunningham (JC) virus. 
Vedolizumab binds the α4β7 integrin 
which is present on a subset of 
leukocytes. By binding to the α4β7 
expressed on gut-homing lymphocytes, 
vedolizumab exerts an immune-
suppressive effect on the gut. Although 
no systemic immunosuppressive effect 
was noted in healthy controls the 
effects on systemic immune system 
function in patients with Inflammatory 
Bowel Disease patients is not known. 
No cases of PML were reported in 
clinical studies of vedolizumab 
however, healthcare professionals 
should monitor patients on 
vedolizumab for any new onset or 
worsening of neurological signs and 
symptoms as outlined in physician

SmPC Section 4.8 Undesirable Effects 
Overall, results from the clinical

increased risk for malignancy with 
vedolizumab treatment; however, the 
number of 
malignancies was small and long-term 
exposure was limited. Long-term 
safety evaluations are ongoing.

Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential are 
strongly recommended to use 
adequate contraception to prevent 
pregnancy and to continue its use for 
18 weeks after the last treatment with 
Entyvio. 
Pregnancy 
There are limited amount of data from 
the use of vedolizumab in pregnant 
women. 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or 
indirect harmful effects with respect to 
reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
Entyvio is to be used during pregnancy 
only if the benefits clearly outweigh 
any potential risk to both the mother 
and fetus. 
Breastfeeding 
It is unknown whether vedolizumab is 
excreted in human milk or absorbed 
systemically after ingestion.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Ulcerative Colitis  
In the induction phase, a statistical significant gain was observed in the primary endpoint, the 
proportion of patients with clinical response at Week 6, in vedolizumab-treated patients 
compared to placebo (21.7%). Subgroup analyses for clinical response at Week 6 showed a 
consistent treatment benefit of vedolizumab across all age categories, gender and disease 
severity. Results on the primary endpoint were confirmed by data on the secondary endpoint 
showing larger percentage of patients in clinical remission in the vedolizumab arm (16.9%) 
compared to placebo (5.4%). Exploratory analyses indicated that efficacy is maintained in anti-
TNF failure patients (6.6% at week 6), although at lower levels, compared with results in 
patients without prior anti-TNF failure (16.5%). 
In the maintenance study, a proportion of approximately 40-45% vedolizumab-treated patients 
achieved remission at Week 52 (primary endpoint), with a gain over placebo of 26.1% in the 
Q8W dosing group and 29.1% in the Q4W dosing group, and relative risks of similar magnitude 
for both dosing regimens, 2.7 for Q8W, 2.8 for Q4W. The efficacy was maintained in most 
subgroup analyses for clinical remission at Week 52, with some non significant differences with 
respect to race, region foecal, and calprotectin. The benefit of vedolizumab was observed both in 
anti-TNF alpha naïve and experienced patients, although treatment effect was somewhat lower in 
the anti-TNF alpha experienced patients. 
Results from secondary endpoints were consistent with those achieved in the primary endpoint, 
all in favour of vedolizumab treated groups with similar responses observed with both dosing

regimens. Durable clinical response (clinical response at Weeks 6 and 52), a key secondary 
endpoint of the Maintenance Study, was significantly higher in vedolizumab treated patients with 
a RR of 2.4 for Q8W dosing and of 2.2 for Q4W dosing versus placebo, respectively; mucosal 
healing at Week 52 was significantly better in both vedolizumab dosing regimens versus placebo 
(RR of 2.6 for Q8W dosing and 2.8 for Q4W dosing); corticosteroid-free remission at Week 52 in 
patients who were on corticosteroid at week 6 was significantly higher in vedolizumab treated 
patients (RR compared to placebo of 2.3 for vedolizumab Q8W and of 3.3 for vedolizumab Q4W). 
The proportion of patients at Week 52 who achieved clinical remission and have been 
corticosteroid-free for 90 days or for 180 days was shown in an exploratory analysis to be higher 
in vedolizumab-treated groups and in particular in Q4w dosing regimen. 
Crohn’s disease 
Second line indication 
In the C13007 Induction study, one of the co-primary endpoints, the proportion of patients with 
clinical remission at Week 6, was met (treatment difference from placebo of 7.8). According to 
the statistical plan, being the pre-defined more stringent level of significance (p< 0.025) reached 
for this endpoint the study is considered technically positive. The pooled analysis of naïve 
C13007 and C13011 subpopulations, including a larger sample size of patients, gives better 
results than those from the two studies separately with a gain over placebo of 12% when 
remission or enhanced clinical response are considered (C13007: gain over placebo remission 
8.2%; gain over placebo enhanced response 11.9%. C13011: gain over placebo remission 
19.5%; gain over placebo enhanced response 15.2%). 
In the maintenances phase of Study C13007, vedolizumab at both dosing regimens (300 mg 
Q8W and 300 mg Q4W) met the primary endpoint of clinical remission at Week 52. Positive 
results were also observed in 2 of the 3 secondary endpoints, i.e. enhanced clinical response and 
corticosteroid-free clinical remission at Week 52. These results were supported by data on 
durability of clinical response (i.e. durability and enhanced durability of clinical response at Week 
52) from ancillary analysis. 
Third line indication 
The induction Study C13011 was performed on a population mainly consisting of prior anti-TNF 
experienced CD patients (75%). Although the study failed its primary efficacy endpoint, the 
proportion of patients in clinical remission at Week 6 in the TNFalpha antagonist failure 
subpopulation, a better benefit was shown at a later time point (week 10).  
The data also showed that clinical remission and clinical enhanced response in the anti TNF 
failure populations of both C13011 and C13007 studies showed small effect of vedolizumab over 
placebo at Week 6 (6.2% and 0.9%, respectively) but greater percentages at Week 10 with a 
gain over placebo in remission of 7.4% (C13007) and 14.4% (C13011) and in enhanced 
response of 16.3% (C13007) and 22% (C13011). The efficacy in this subpopulation of anti-
TNFalpha failed patients is considered acceptable in view of the limited therapeutic options 
available at present.

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
The beneficial effects of VDZ appeared more evident in those patients on concomitant 
corticosteroids, as reflected in the product information. Exploratory analyses also suggested that 
vedolizumab administered in patients without concomitant corticosteroid treatment may be less 
effective for induction of remission in Crohn’s disease than in those patients already receiving 
concomitant corticosteroids. As requested by the CHMP, this information is reflected in the 
product information for consideration by the treating physician. 
Data suggest that some patients with Crohn’s disease may require up to 14 weeks treatment 
with vedolizumab to achieve remission. Possible explanations include the mechanism of action 
and individual patient disease factors. The CHMP therefore requested the inclusion of the 
following information in the SmPC: “Induction of remission in Crohn’s disease may take up to 14 
weeks in some patients. The reasons for this are not fully known and are possibly related to the 
mechanism of action. This should be taken into consideration, particularly in patients with severe 
active disease at baseline not previously treated with TNFα antagonists”.  
Crohn’s disease. 
Second line  
In the induction study, only one of the co-primary endpoints, proportion of patients with clinical 
remission at Week 6, was met, whereas no statistical significance was reached in the proportion 
of patients with enhanced clinical response at Week 6. In addition, the gain over placebo in 
terms of clinical remission was small and the placebo response was lower than the expected 
(6.8% vs. the expected 21%). This enhances the potential of detecting smaller treatment effect 
differences as statistically significant. However the CHMP acknowledged that the the placebo 
clinical remission rate in Study C13007 is driven by the significant number of refractory patients 
studied.   
In the anti-TNFalpha naïve population, better results in clinical remission at week 6 in the naïve 
population of the C13011 study than in study C13007 (difference from placebo 8.2% and 19.2%, 
NTT 5.2 vs. 12.2 respectively) were reported. The difference in the therapeutic effect of 
vedolizumab in the 2 studies is rather large. One reason could be the different sample size 
between the two studies. However, similar differences are noted also in the response of the 
placebo group. The data provided highlighted that baseline disease activity in TNFα antagonist 
naïve patients was higher in those enrolled in study C13007 than those in study C13011, which 
may support the hypothesis that the patient population of C13007 and C13011 studies was 
different.  
Third line 
Results from the other induction study C13011, showing a gain in clinical remission, in patients 
who previously failed anti-TNFalpha therapy, only at week 10 might suggest, together with the 
observation of a continuous increase in enhanced clinical response from week 6 to week 10 the 
need of an additional treatment dose (week 0, 2, 6) and a longer time of follow-up (10 w) in 
order to observe a clinical relevant benefit in the TNFalpha antagonist failed patients. However, it 
is still uncertain the magnitude of the gain over time in this refractory population. In order to 
avoid ineffective treatment, therapy should not be continued in patients failing to respond by 
week 14 as described in the product information.

In the maintenance study, the stratification of patients at week 6 by response status and not by 
remission status led to an imbalance, in terms of clinical remission, across different treatment 
groups with the highest proportion of patients in response being observed in the placebo group. 
It is possible that this imbalance may have favoured the placebo group in the analyses of results 
on clinical remission. No difference was observed in the durable remission in the timeframe 
comprised between week 6 and 52. However clinical remission at Week 52 was in favor of 
vedolizumab treated patients. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of VDZ does not raise major objections and could be considered reassuring in 
both UC and CD indications, although differences between these two pathologies have been 
reported (with higher incidence of AEs in CD).   
In the combined studies of GEMINI I and II the adverse reactions that occurred in >5% were 
nausea, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, arthralgia, pyrexia, fatigue, headache, 
cough. Infusion-related reactions were reported in 4% of patients receiving vedolizumab. 
In the shorter (10-week) placebo controlled induction trial, GEMINI III, the types of adverse 
reactions reported were similar but occurred at lower frequency than the longer 52 week trials. 
AEs of special interest, in particular infections, PML and malignancy will be carefully monitored in 
the post-approval safety studies as described in the RMP.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Clinical studies showed reassuring data on systemic immunosuppression in terms of response to 
immunization in healthy volunteers or opportunistic infections including PML and TB. However, 
the occurrence rate of these events with long-term exposure and in patients pre-treated with 
anti TNFalpha drugs and/or concomitant immunosuppressants is still not known. This lack of data 
is reflected in the product information and described in the RMP. 
The incidence of certain malignancies, in particular lymphoma and colorectal cancer, may, in 
theory, increase in patients on long-term immunosuppressive therapies, particularly those which 
target cell-mediated immunity. Patients with prior exposure to immunosuppressants or 
immunomodulators (e.g., TNFα antagonists, natalizumab) may be at a greater risk for 
developing certain malignancies. This potential risk is addressed in the product information and 
the RMP. 
The immune response to an oral vaccine (Cholera) was reduced by VDZ. It is not clear at this 
point whether chronic VDZ treatment may impact on immune response to systemic 
immunisation. This lack of data is reflected in the product information and described in the RMP. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The availability of a new agent in IBD for patients who have failed either conventional therapy or 
anti-TNFs is considered an important benefit for patients. This is particularly the case for an 
Entyvio 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/676643/2013 
Page 160/166 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
agent with a novel mechanism of action, and a safety profile that is potentially preferable to that 
of anti-TNF agents.  
The benefits of vedolizumab in both CD and UC have been adequately demonstrated in the 
clinical programme, although it is acknowledged that the magnitude of the effect is limited in the 
second line indication in CD, with regard to the time required for induction of remission and the 
effect size compared to anti-TNFs drugs. Vedolizumab administered without concomitant 
corticosteroids for induction of remission in Crohn’s appeared less effective than in combination 
with concomitant corticosteroid treatment (regardless of use of concomitant 
immunomodulators). This information is adequately reflected in the product information. 
The safety profile in both indications is at present mainly related to infections, particularly gut 
infections. Opportunistic infections or extra-pulmonary TB cases have not been observed.  It is 
acknowledged that the risk of PML is potentially lower than for natalizumab, and although no 
cases of PML have been described in the clinical programme to date, there is an absence of long 
term safety data. The risk of PML will be monitored in the post-approval safety studies as 
described in the RMP.   
Benefit-risk balance 
Ulcerative Colitis. Results from both induction and maintenance study consistently indicate a 
benefit of vedolizumab treatment in the UC population. The benefit of vedolizumab was observed 
both in anti-TNF alpha naïve and experienced patients supporting both second line and third line 
indications. The treatment effect is considered clinically relevant, although somewhat lower in 
the anti-TNF alpha experienced patients and of smaller magnitude with respect to maintenance 
compared to previous anti-TNF-alpha drugs.  
Crohn’s disease. The rationale for the second line indication presented by the Applicant was 
based on the similarity of the patient populations in studies C13007 and C13011 (supporting the 
validity of results obtained in both studies in the overall benefit-risk assessment), the favourable 
safety profile of VDZ compared to anti-TNFs, the comparability of the efficacy of VDZ with anti-
TNFs (given the limitations of comparing results between studies and the delayed action of VDZ), 
and the overall clinical relevance of the benefits observed for VDZ in terms of the proportion 
achieving remission and the length of time required for this to occur. The CHMP concluded that 
as efficacy is greater in the second line indication compared with the third line, albeit delayed 
and possibly less effective compared with anti-TNFs, the lack of systemic immunosuppression, 
with no cases of extra-pulmonary or systemic TB with VDZ in contrast to anti-TNFs, and the 
long-lasting efficacy in those who respond, combine to make VDZ a useful option for 2nd line CD 
patients. In the third line indication (after conventional therapy and anti-TNFalpha the data 
showed that clinical remission and clinical enhanced response in the anti TNF failure populations 
of both C13011 and C13007 studies showed small effect of vedolizumab over placebo at Week 6 
(6.2% and 0.9%, respectively) but greater percentages at Week 10 with a gain over placebo in 
remission of 7.4% (C13007) and 14.4% (C13011) and in enhanced response of 16.3% (C13007) 
and 22% (C13011). This indication for 3rd line in CD is therefore considered acceptable by the 
CHMP particularly in view of the recognized unmet need, since no therapeutic alternatives are at 
present available in this anti-TNF alpha failed population.

Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Ulcerative colitis. On the basis of the evidence generated from both induction and maintenance 
the efficacy of vedolizumab in the ulcerative colitis indication is considered sufficiently and 
robustly demonstrated. The availability of a product with demonstrated efficacy in patients not 
responding to anti-TNF therapy is considered valuable, and the magnitude of effect observed in 
both second and third line treatments, clinically significant. The significant clinical efficacy of 
vedolizumab treatment is considered to overcome the risk represented by limited information on 
the long-term safety of the drug, which is considered manageable with strict monitoring.   
Crohn’s disease. The efficacy of vedolizumab in the second and third line indications in CD is, 
on balance, considered adequate to outweigh the potential risks. The magnitude of the effect is 
limited in the second line indication in CD, with regard to the time required for induction of 
remission and the effect size compared to anti-TNFs, however the effect size compared to 
placebo, especially when administered with concomitant corticosteroids, is considered of clinical 
relevance for an agent with a different mechanism of action to existing therapies, and with a 
safety profile that would appear to be beneficial to that of the anti-TNF agents.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by 
majority decision that the risk-benefit balance of Entyvio in the “treatment of adult patients with 
moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response with, lost 
response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a tumour necrosis factor-alpha 
(TNFα) antagonist”and “treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s 
disease who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either 
conventional therapy or a tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) antagonist”” is favourable and 
therefore recommends  the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following

Patients treated with Entyvio should be monitored for any new onset or worsening of 
neurological signs and symptoms such as those listed below: 
o  Progressive weakness on one side of the body or 
o 
clumsiness of limbs 
o  Disturbance of vision 
o  Changes in thinking, memory, and orientation, leading to confusion and personality 
changes

•  Any patients with new onset or worsening signs and symptoms suggestive of PML should be 
considered for neurological referral at a center equipped to diagnose PML 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of data on the quality properties of the active substance, the CHMP 
considers that vedolizumab is qualified as a new active substance.

DIVERGENT POSITION EXPRESSED BY CHMP MEMBERS 
The undersigned members of CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s opinion recommending the 
granting of a Marketing Authorisation for Entyvio in the claimed indications. The reasons for 
divergent opinion were as follows: 
The magnitude of vedolizumab effect over placebo obtained in Study C13007 is considered of 
limited clinical value (+7.1% at week 6, sensitivity analysis) and distant from the effect size 
considered clinical relevant for the calculation of the sample size (~+ 16%) in the claimed 
second line indication where other treatment options that showed higher efficacy are available. 
Moreover, the only secondary endpoint was not met. 
The reliability of the pooled analysis of the two studies C13007 and C13011 proposed by the 
Applicant to increase treatment effect and achieve statistical significant difference from placebo 
is questionable. Significant differences in induction of remission in response to treatment were 
obtained in the anti-TNFalpha naïve population of the two studies (difference from placebo 8.2% 
and 19.2%, NTT 5.2 vs. 12.2, in the C13007 and C13011 study, respectively). Moreover, higher 
response rates are observed not only in the vedolizumab arm but also in the placebo arm.  
Baseline disease activity (CDAI score, % pts CDAI>400, inflammatory indexes: mean CRP, fecal 
calprotein) in TNFalpha antagonist naïve patients was higher in patients enrolled in Study 
C13007 than in those in Study C13011. 
These observations indicate that the populations of the two studies are significantly different and 
thus the pooling is not acceptable.  
Inadequate response to vedolizumab requires longer time periods to be recognised compared to 
available anti-TNF alpha drugs. This is of concern particularly for patients with high disease 
activity, experiencing rectal bleeding, anaemia and frequent episodes of diarrhoea who would 
remain symptomatic while on vedolizumab whereas other potentially more effective induction 
therapies are available.  
Potential differences in the safety profile between anti-TNFalpha drugs and VDZ are not 
considered to counterbalance the lack of benefit in patients with high disease activity.  
In light of all the above mentioned considerations, the clinical benefit/risk ratio of Vedolizumab in 
the second line indication (patients naïve to anti-TNFalpha drugs) in Crohn’s disease is 
considered negative.

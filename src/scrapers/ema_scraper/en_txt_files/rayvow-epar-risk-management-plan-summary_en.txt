Chemical class: 5-HT1F receptor agonist 
Summary of mode of action: Lasmiditan is a low molecular weight 5-HT1F 
receptor agonist with a nonvascular, primarily neural mechanism of action. It 
has high affinity for the human 5-HT1F receptor and >440-fold selectivity for 
the human 5-HT1F receptor relative to the 5-HT1B receptor. 
Important information about its composition: The drug product is composed 
of lasmiditan hemisuccinate and the inactive ingredients croscarmellose 
sodium, magnesium stearate (nonbovine), microcrystalline cellulose, purified 
water, sodium lauryl sulphate, starch.  
See eCTD Module 1.3.1  
Current: Lasmiditan is indicated for the acute treatment of the headache phase 
of migraine attacks, with or without aura in adults. 
Proposed:  Not applicable 
Current: In general, the recommended initial dose in adults is 100 mg 
lasmiditan for acute treatment of migraine attacks. If necessary, the dose can be 
increased to 200 mg for greater efficacy or can be decreased to 50 mg for 
greater tolerability. If the migraine headache recurs within 24 hours of an initial 
response after taking 50- or 100-mg lasmiditan, a second dose of the same 
strength may be taken. The second dose should not be taken within 2 hours of 
the initial dose. No more than 200 mg should be taken in 24 hours.  
Proposed: Not applicable 
Current:  RAYVOW 50 mg film-coated tablets, RAYVOW 100 mg film-

Module SI - Epidemiology of the Indication(s) and Target Population(s)  
SI.1 Migraine  
Migraine has 2 main categories based on headache days per month. Episodic migraine (EM) is 
characterised by <15 headache days per month and chronic migraine (CM) is characterised by 
≥15 headache days per month (Adams et al. 2015). Of the 2 types, EM occurs most frequently 
and represents ≥90% of the migraine population (Lipton et al. 2017; Buse et al. 2010). When 
available, the epidemiology data will focus on the more common episodic type. 
SI.1.1 Incidence  
The incidence of migraine varies by geographic region. In an abstract describing a systematic 
review of migraine in Europe, authors reported an estimated 77 million people with migraine, 
with an incidence of up to 39.2/1000 person years (pys) (Benhaddi et al. 2018). In Denmark, the 
average annual incidence of any migraine from 1994 to 2002 was 17.6 per 1000 pys in adults 
aged 20 to 49 years (23.4 per 1000 pys in women and 11.2 per 1000 pys in men); the average 
annual incidence of migraine without aura, 12.0 per 1000 pys, was greater than that of migraine 
with aura, 5.6 per 1000 pys (Le et al. 2012). A lower incidence was observed in a UK database 
study (1994 to 2001) where the estimated incidence rate was 3.69 cases per 1000 pys for a first 
diagnosis of migraine in those aged ≤79 years. The incidence rate was highest in those aged 10 to 
19 years (6.43 per 1000 pys), relatively stable in those aged 20 to 49 years (approximately 
4.5 per 1000 pys), and lowest in older patients aged 70 to 79 years (1.32 per 1000 pys). Incidence 
across all ages is greater in women than men, 5.21 and 2.13 per 1000 pys, respectively (Becker et 
al. 2008a). The cumulative migraine incidence as determined in the American Migraine 
Prevalence and Prevention study (AMPP) by Stewart et al. (2008) was 21% in females and 7.5% 
in males. The median age of onset was 23.2 years for females and 25.5 years for males. The 
AMPP data was used to model age-standardized incidence rates; the peak incidence was 
18.2/1000 in females aged 20 to 24 years and 6.2/1000 in males aged 15 to 19 years (Stewart et 
al. 2008).  
SI.1.2 Prevalence  
The 2010 Global Burden of Diseases Study reports a global prevalence of 14.7% (10.68% in 
males and 18.79% in females) for migraine in the all ages combined population (Vos et al. 
2012). Estimates of migraine prevalence in the global adult population is estimated to be 11% to 
11.5% (Stovner et al. 2007; Merikangas 2013). A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 
community-based and observational studies (n=302 studies involving 6 216 995 participants) 
reports a global migraine prevalence of 11.6% (6.9% of males and 13.8% of females) and 
European prevalence of 11.4% (Woldeamanuel and Cowan 2017). Prevalence of EM from the 
International Burden of Migraine Study (IBMS) and the AMPP study ranges from 11% to 17.1% 
in females and 5% to 8% in males (Katsarava et al. 2012; Payne et al. 2011). A review article of 
epidemiology studies using the International Classification of Headache Disorders second edition 
criteria reports the weighted average 12-month prevalence of CM to be 0.5% (range: 0.2% to 
LY573144 
EU Risk Management Plan (Version 1.1) 
Page 7 
2.7%) and of migraine with aura to be 4.4% (range: 1.2% to 5.8%) (Merikangas 2013). Given 
that the 12-month prevalence weighted average of definite or probable migraine was 18.5% 
across these studies, migraine with aura represents approximately one-quarter of adult patients 
with migraine (Merikangas 2013). 
The frequency of EM in the IBMS study ranged from 5.6% in Australia to 12.3% in the UK to 
17.1% in France (Blumenfeld et al. 2011). In a review of headache prevalence studies conducted 
in European countries, the mean prevalence of current migraine in adults was reported as 14.7% 
(8% in males and 17.6% in females) (Stovner and Andree 2010). Prevalence ranged from 4.8% 
to 18.1% among individual country studies (Korolainen et al. 2019; Hagen et al. 2018). The 
lowest prevalence was observed in a retrospective register study that included migraineurs using 
occupational health care in Finland, where the point prevalence of migraine was 4.8% (7.4% 
versus 2.1% in men) among 369 383 individuals in the cohort (Korolainen et al. 2019). In a 
questionnaire given to a representative sample of the Greek general population (N=10 008), the 
1-year prevalence of migraine that reduced activity was 8.2% (Mitsikostas et al. 2018). 
Similarly, in a nationally representative cross-sectional survey (European Health Survey) in 
Spain, the overall 1-year prevalence of migraine among 22 842 individuals was 8% (95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 8, 9) (Roy et al. 2019). In a Swedish study, the 1-year prevalence of 
migraine among 1668 randomly selected individuals was higher at 13.2% (±1.9%) (Dahlöf and 
Linde 2001). The 1-year prevalence of definite migraine was highest in the smaller fourth wave 
of the Nord-Trondelag Health Survey in Norway (n=232 subjects interviewed) at 18.1% (95% 
CI: 13.1, 23.1) (Hagen et al. 2018).  
SI.1.3 Demographics of the Population and Risk Factors for the 
Disease  
The male to female sex ratio for lifetime migraine remains stable at 1:2 to 1:3 and is generally 
consistent across countries (Merikangas 2013). When stratified by migraine type, the male 
to female gender ratio for EM is higher, with a range spanning approximately 1:3 to 1:4 (Buse 
and Lipton 2013; Adams et al. 2015). Patients with migraine are predominantly female 
(approximately 3:1) with a higher prevalence from 18 to 49 years (Buse et al. 2013).  
The most common age of onset of migraine is in the second and third decades of life (Jensen and 
Stovner 2008). In the Eurolight study, migraine prevalence peaked at 33.5% in the age range 
30 to 40 years for males; in females, there was a prevalence plateau at 37% to 40% in the age 
range of 20 to 60 years. After age 60 years, prevalence fell in both genders (males: 12.2%; 
females: 22.3%) (Steiner et al. 2014). Similar results were seen in a large US health care 
database where the frequency of migraine (any evidence) by age group was: 0 to 9 years (1%), 
10 to 19 years (10%), 20 to 29 years (17%), 30 to 39 years (21%), 40 to 49 years (21%), 50 to 59 
years (16%), 60 to 69 years (9%), 70 to 79 years (3%), 80+ years (1%) (Pressman et al. 2016). 
Several risk factors for migraine are reported in the literature; these include female sex, younger 
age (teenagers and younger adults aged less than 50 years have the highest incidence and 
prevalence), and a family history of migraine (Stewart et al. 2006; Merikangas 2013; Dzoljic 
et al. 2014). For some migraine comorbidities, such as asthma (Becker et al. 2008b; Martin et al. 
2016) and depression (Patten et al. 2008; Modgill et al. 2012), a bidirectional association has 
LY573144 
EU Risk Management Plan (Version 1.1) 
Page 8 
been found; people with migraine are more likely to have asthma or depression, and people with 
asthma or depression are more likely to have migraine. Strong inference of the aetiology is 
limited as treatment-seeking for these primary disorders may increase the opportunity to detect 
migraine, or vice versa. Obesity has been associated with more frequent and more disabling 
migraine headache (Bigal et al. 2007); and in the EM population, depression is associated with 
an increased risk of transitioning to CM (Ashina et al. 2012). 
SI.1.4 Main Existing Treatment Options  
Triptans are commonly recommended for acute treatment of migraine (NICE 2015; Sarchielli et al. 
2012; Swedish Headache Society 2018; Lantéri-Minet et al. 2014). Seven triptans are currently 
approved for the acute treatment of migraine in the US, Canada, and Europe (See Table SI.1). 
Labelling for the triptans includes a class labelling, which contraindicates their use in patients 
with ischaemic coronary artery disease (CAD), coronary artery vasospasm, Wolff–Parkinson–
White syndrome, peripheral vascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, and a history of stroke, 
and recommends cautious use in patients with and without relevant cardiovascular (CV) history 
because myocardial ischaemia, myocardial infarction, Prinzmetal’s angina, life-threatening 
arrhythmias, cerebrovascular events, and sensations of pain, tightness, and pressure in the chest, 
neck, throat, and jaw have been reported (Imigran Tablets 50 mg summary of product 
characteristics; Maxalt 5 mg Tablets summary of product characteristics; Zomig Tablets 2.5 mg 
summary of product characteristics; Naramig Tablets 2.5 mg summary of product 
characteristics).

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and other analgesics, including combination 
analgesics, are often recommended for mild to moderate attacks, or when triptans are 
contraindicated or ineffective. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be less effective for the

treatment of moderate to severe headaches than many available triptans (Cameron et al. 2015; 
Xu et al. 2016). The National Institute for Health Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that 
NSAIDs or paracetamol should be taken in combination with triptans (NICE 2015). Nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs may have side effects involving the gastrointestinal system and may 
include warnings concerning CV disease (Naproxen 500 mg Tablets summary of product 
characteristics; Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists’ Collaboration [CNT] et al. 2013).  
Recommendations for the use of ergot derivatives vary, ranging from advising that they should 
be avoided to advising that use should be restricted to low frequency, severe migraine attacks 
that are unresponsive to other treatment options (Sarchielli et al. 2012; NICE 2015). Opiates and 
barbiturates are not recommended for the treatment of migraine headaches and should be 
avoided (Sarchielli et al. 2012; NICE 2015; Lantéri-Minet et al. 2014). 
Gepants (CGRP antagonists) are a new class of drug for acute treatment of migraine. Two 
gepants, ubrogepant and rimegepant, have been approved by the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) for the acute treatment of migraine, but none are currently approved in the 
EU (Tepper 2020). 
SI.1.5 Natural History of the Indicated Condition in the Untreated 
Population, Including Mortality and Morbidity  
Natural History 
Migraine is a serious, chronic, disabling neurological disease characterised by severe headache 
attacks. These headaches typically last from 4 to 72 hours if left untreated, are generally 
unilateral in nature, and frequently include throbbing or pulsating pain, often with associated 
symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, sound, or movement. The natural 
history of migraine is worse in women. Women experience more frequent, longer lasting, and 
more severe headaches compared with men and have a greater risk of transition from EM to CM 
than men (odds ratio [OR] = 2.9, 95% CI = 1.2, 6.9), even after adjusting data for triptan use and 
headache frequency (Finocchi and Strada 2014). 
Migraine can be a progressive disease; in some patients, the condition can transform from EM to 
CM. An analysis in the AMPP study estimated that this transition from EM to CM occurs at a 
rate of about 2.5% per year and is associated with increased migraine frequency and use of 
barbiturates and opioids (Bigal et al. 2008; Lipton 2009). Chronic migraine can also remit to EM, 
with 1 study reporting a 2-year transition rate of 26% of CM patients to EM patients (Katsarava 
et al. 2012). 
Mortality 
Although serious and disabling, migraine by itself is not immediately life-threatening or fatal. An 
Icelandic study determined that the hazard ratio (HR) of all-cause mortality in adult patients with 
migraine was slightly increased when compared with patients without migraine in adjusted 
analyses (HR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.08, 1.23) (Gudmundsson et al. 2010). An increased risk of 
mortality from cardiovascular disease (CVD) was reported in patients with migraine (HR = 1.22, 
95% CI = 1.10, 1.36) (Gudmundsson et al. 2010). 
LY573144 
EU Risk Management Plan (Version 1.1) 
Page 10 
Morbidity 
Cardiovascular: Migraine is associated with an increased risk of a number of CV events, which 
are in turn associated with increased morbidity. These associations were more significant in 
patients with migraine with aura (Bigal et al. 2010). Meta-analyses of observational studies 
identified an increased relative risk (RR) of stroke as 2.16 (migraine with aura, RR = 2.88; 
migraine without aura, RR = 1.56) (Etminan et al. 2005).  
Spector et al. (2010) conducted a meta-analysis of 21 observational studies that examined the 
risk of ischaemic stroke in patients with migraine and reported an overall pooled effect estimate 
of 2.04 (95% CI 1.72, 2.43) (Spector et al. 2010). In a nationwide, population-based study of 
Danish hospitals and outpatient clinics from 1995 to 2013 (n=51 032 migraine patients; 
n=510 320 general population) that evaluated incident CV events, after adjustment for the 
covariables, migraine was associated with myocardial infarction (adjusted HR 1.49, 95% CI: 
1.36, 1.64), ischaemic stroke (2.26, 95% CI: 2.11, 2.41), and haemorrhagic stroke (1.94, 95% CI: 
1.68, 2.23), as well as venous thromboembolism (1.59, 95% CI: 1.45, 1.74) and atrial fibrillation 
or atrial flutter (1.25, 95% CI: 1.16, 1.36) (Adelborg et al. 2018). In another Danish study 
including 46 418 twins in Denmark, any CVD (composite) was increased in those with migraine 
compared to those without migraine (14.3% versus 10%; OR: 1.51; 95% CI: 1.33, 1.71; p<.001) 
(Le et al. 2011). Another Danish study that captured incident migraine from 2005 through 2013 
(N=97 431 migraine patients) reported that at baseline 24.3% of patients took CV medication, 
1.7% had cerebrovascular disease, 0.6% had CAD, and 0.2% had peripheral vascular disease 
(Thomsen et al. 2019). 
Psychiatric: Suicidal ideation (Ratcliffe et al. 2008) and suicidal attempt (Ratcliffe et al. 2008; 
Breslau et al. 2012) have been reported to be increased in patients with migraine compared with 
those without migraine. Limited data are available on suicide in European patients with 
migraine. Breslau et al. (2012) reported a baseline prevalence of suicide attempt of 9.1% among 
adult patients aged 25 to 55 years in the US with migraine (n=496). The 2-year cumulative 
incidence of suicide attempt was 8.7% compared with 1.3% in controls (Breslau et al. 2012). 
When adjusted for other confounders, suicide attempt was increased 4-fold (OR = 4.43, 95% 
CI = 1.93, 10.2) among patients with migraine (Breslau et al. 2012). 
In a large systematic review of migraine and psychiatric comorbidity, a bidirectional association 
of major depression and panic disorder was observed with migraine (Dresler et al. 2019). The 
prevalence of major depression varied by country, from 6.1% to 73.7%, while the prevalence 
odds ratios varied from 0.8 to 5.8. The risk of suicide attempts is particularly increased in 
migraine subjects with comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms (Dresler et al. 2019). Anxiety 
was more prevalent than depression in all migraine studies reported here. In a cross-sectional 
survey of adults in 10 EU countries (Eurolight), depression was prevalent in 6.9% and anxiety 
was present in 19.1% of migraine subjects. Migraine was associated with depression in males 
(OR: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.3, 3.4; p=.002) and females (OR: 1.8; 95% CI: 1.1, 3.1; p=.030) and also 
with anxiety in males (OR: 4.2; 95% CI: 2.8, 6.3; p<.0001) and females (OR: 2.4; 95% CI: 1.7, 
3.4; p<.0001) (Lampl et al. 2016). In a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis conducted using 
data captured through the Migraine Buddy app among individuals with migraine in 17 European 
LY573144 
EU Risk Management Plan (Version 1.1) 
Page 11 
countries, 40.9% of those with EM experiencing 8 to 14 migraine days per month and 34.7% of 
those experiencing 4 to 7 migraine days per month reported anxiety and/or depression symptoms 
during migraine attacks (Vo et al. 2018). In a nationally representative cross-sectional survey 
(European Health Survey) in Spain, among 1902 individuals with migraine in the past 1 year, 
28% of females and 17% of males reported chronic anxiety. Among females, 20%, 27%, 31%, 
and 34% reported mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively, while 
11%, 12%, 14%, and 21% of men reported these symptoms (Roy et al. 2019). In a retrospective 
register study of patients with migraine using occupational healthcare in Finland (n=17 623) 
compared with age and gender matched controls (n=17 623) a depressive episode was observed 
in 13.0% of participants with migraine and 7.1% of controls, a recurrent depressive disorder was 
reported in 4.8% and 2.5%, respectively, and other anxiety disorders were reported in 14.1% and 
7.9%, respectively (Korolainen et al. 2020). In a nationwide population-based postal survey in 
France, among subjects who had migraine attacks during the last 3 months (n=1957) 50.6% were 
anxious and/or depressive (28.0% anxiety alone, 3.5% depression alone, 19.1% both) (Lantéri-
Minet 2005).

Module SII – Nonclinical Part of the Safety Specification  
SII.1 Toxicity  
Key issues from the toxicology studies are described in terms of target organ systems. 
CNS Findings 
Lasmiditan is a central nervous system (CNS)-active drug, and treatment of mice, rats, and dogs 
was associated with CNS-related clinical signs including tremors, ataxia, hypoactivity, head 
shaking, clonic movements, and convulsions. These signs progressed in severity as dose (and 
thus, maximum observed drug concentration [Cmax] exposures) increased and generally occurred 
1 to 2 hours post dose. Convulsions and/or mortality occurred only at oral or intravenous (IV) 
doses associated with high Cmax values (>10-fold that at the clinical dose of 200 mg). The lowest 
no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for CNS signs in the dog, the most sensitive species 
for these effects, was 30 mg/kg (Week 39 Cmax and area under the concentration versus time 
curve [AUC] exposures >8-fold the clinical exposure at the 200-mg dose). 
In repeat-dose studies in rats, lasmiditan treatment was associated with pigmentary inclusions in 
the cytoplasm of large motor neurons in the brain stem and spinal cord. These findings, which 
were observed histologically in the 26-week chronic toxicity study and the carcinogenicity study, 
were considered to represent increased autophagocytosis in lasmiditan-treated rats when 
compared with controls. The intracellular neuronal inclusions were rat-specific (that is, not 
evident in the morphologic pathology findings from studies in mice or dogs dosed at a maximum 
tolerated dose for as long as 39 weeks) and were associated with prolonged exposure (that is, 
present in 26-week and lifetime carcinogenicity studies and not in studies of ≤13-week duration). 
The inclusions were not considered adverse as there was no evidence of a corollary adverse 
morphologic effect (for example, inflammation, necrosis). The neuronal inclusions observed in 
rats are not considered predictive of risk in humans based on the rat-specific nature of the 
finding. 
Cardiovascular System 
The in vitro human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) half maximal inhibitory concentration 
(IC50) for lasmiditan is approximately 10-fold higher than the human plasma unbound lasmiditan 
concentrations (Cmax,u) at the 200-mg dose. In the in vivo CV safety pharmacology study in 
conscious dogs using surgically implanted telemetry devices, there were no important effects on 
CV function or haemodynamics after single IV doses up to 6 mg/kg (Cmax approximately 1277 
ng/mL, approximately 5-fold higher than human exposure at the 200-mg dose). Increases in 
QRS, QT, and QTc intervals were reported in a 39-week toxicity study in dogs 
(electrocardiograms [ECGs] collected using surface electrodes) at the high dose of 50 mg/kg 
(reduced to 40 mg/kg based on the nature of multiple adverse clinical signs). The Cmax and AUC 
exposures for these findings were >10-fold human exposure at 200 mg clinical dose. Given these 
large exposure multiples, the findings are not considered to have clinical significance, 
particularly in light of the negative findings in a Phase 1 thorough QT (TQT) study. 
LY573144 
EU Risk Management Plan (Version 1.1) 
Page 14 
Vasoconstriction: In multiple assays, which included a positive control (sumatriptan), lasmiditan 
showed no vasoconstrictive effects. Lasmiditan did not contract rabbit saphenous vein rings ex 
vivo, a model that correlates highly with human coronary artery constriction (Nelson et al. 2010). 
Furthermore, in in vitro pharmacology studies, lasmiditan did not induce constriction of the 
human internal mammary artery, human proximal coronary artery, or human distal coronary 
artery ex vivo. Finally, lasmiditan did not change coronary or carotid artery diameter in 
anesthetized beagle dogs. Sumatriptan, the positive control, showed vasoconstrictive effects in 
all of these experiments. These data are consistent with a lack of evidence for vasoconstriction in 
clinical experience (Krege et al. 2019). 
Renal System 
Lasmiditan treatment was associated with changes in the kidney characterised in studies with rats 
of ≤13 weeks in duration. The changes were manifested as altered renal function with associated 
histopathologic changes, including renal medullary tubule degeneration and regeneration. The 
NOAEL in the 13-week rat study was 30 mg/kg corresponding to exposures >6-fold greater than 
human exposure at a 200-mg dose. Exacerbation of chronic progressive nephropathy was also 
observed in the 13-week and 6-month studies and was attributed to an age-related, spontaneously 
occurring condition in rats. No treatment-related histopathologic effects on the kidneys were 
observed in dogs treated for up to 39 weeks, and there were no renal safety concerns observed 
from the integrated clinical data. As a result, the rat findings are not considered to be of 
relevance to human use. 
Reproductive/Developmental Toxicity 
Lasmiditan treatment was not associated with effects on male or female fertility in a rat study of 
fertility and early embryonic development.  
In embryofoetal development studies with rats and rabbits, there were no test article‒related 
increases in external, visceral, or skeletal malformations. Developmental effects (decreased 
foetal body weights and associated skeletal variations) occurred at maternally toxic doses 
(250 mg/kg, rats and 115 mg/kg, rabbit) corresponding to exposures which were approximately 
50- and 2.4-fold higher in rats and rabbits, respectively, than exposures at a clinical dose of 
200 mg (maternal toxicity included clinical signs, decreased body weight or body weight gain, 
decreased food consumption; in rabbits, these effects led to the moribund sacrifice of 1 doe 
[75 mg/kg] and 1 doe which aborted [115 mg/kg]). Exposures at the NOAEL doses (175 mg/kg, 
rats and 75 mg/kg, rabbits) were approximately 30- and 1.2-fold higher, respectively, than 
exposures at a clinical dose of 200 mg. In the rabbit only, a slight increase in postimplantation 
loss and a low incidence of foetal CV (ventricular septal) defects (2 foetuses from 2 separate 
litters) were also observed at 115 mg/kg. Through the course of development, 2 additional 
embryofoetal development studies were conducted in rabbits (1 via the IV route and another with 
oral doses similar to those in the definitive oral study); the increased postimplantation loss and 
CV defects were not observed in either of these studies. 
In the rat pre/postnatal study, prolonged gestation and parturition were observed and the number 
of stillborn pups and the frequency of postnatal death was increased; however, effects occurred 
LY573144 
EU Risk Management Plan (Version 1.1) 
Page 15 
at a maternally toxic dose of 225 mg/kg which corresponded to exposures estimated to be greater 
than 40-fold higher than human exposure at 200 mg; the NOAEL of 150 mg/kg/day 
corresponded to exposures greater than 30-fold higher than human exposure at the 200-mg dose.  
Genotoxicity and Carcinogenicity 
Lasmiditan was not genotoxic or carcinogenic in rats or transgenic mice.  
Drug Abuse Liability 
In rats, lasmiditan was not associated with physical dependence and did not generalize to the 
benzodiazepine, lorazepam. Lasmiditan was weakly self-reinforcing in a self-administration 
study in heroin-maintained rats (see Module SVI.1). 
SII.2 Safety Pharmacology  
Other than the findings already discussed above, no significant effects related to Safety 
Pharmacology were observed. 
SII.3 Other Toxicity-Related Information or Data  
To support clinical trials with paediatric patients, a juvenile toxicology study was conducted in 
male and female rats treated with lasmiditan from postnatal day 21 to 77. As for adult rats (in the 
13-week study), adverse findings of renal tubule and collecting duct degeneration and 
regeneration occurred in males in the 50- and 150-mg/kg group. There were no significant 
lasmiditan-related effects on sexual maturity, neurobehavioral function, or reproduction. Based 
on renal toxicity in males, the NOAEL was the lowest dose of 15 mg/kg.  
There were no other significant effects observed in the nonclinical studies. 
Conclusion 
Based on the findings from the nonclinical studies and relatively limited experience on use in 
pregnancy in humans, adverse pregnancy outcomes will be classified as an important potential 
risk for lasmiditan.

Module SIII - Clinical Trial Exposure  
The initial randomized placebo-controlled studies were single dose studies; therefore, the data in 
Table SIII.1 only reflect the subset of patients from the completed open-label extension long-
term study (COL MIG-305/H8H-CD-LAHL [305/LAHL]) who treated 2 or more migraine 
attacks per month on average in the time period of interest. Given the as needed (PRN) use of 
lasmiditan for acute treatment of migraine, exposure to the drug in person-time is only possible 
for the long-term study (Table SIII.1) and is not calculated for exposure based on placebo-
controlled single dose studies (Table SIII.2, Table SIII.3, and Table SIII.4). It should be noted 
that person time is calculated using the time between the dates of the first and last dose, even 
though the drug is only taken as needed for migraine attacks.  
Table SIII.2 and Table SIII.4 show the distribution of patients across all oral Phase 2 and Phase 3 
studies by age and by gender (Table SIII.2) or ethnic origin (Table SIII.4). Patients are only 
counted once if they rolled over from a placebo-controlled study into the open-label extension. 
Table SIII.3 shows exposure data by dose across the Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical development 
programme based on exposures from individual studies. Patients are counted in both feeder and 
the open-label long-term study if they participated in both. 
Cumulatively, more than 6500 adult subjects/patients have received lasmiditan in the clinical 
development programme, including 777 in completed Phase 1 studies and 5916 in completed or 
ongoing Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies. The programme has included more than 30,000 migraine 
attacks treated with lasmiditan.

Module SIV - Populations Not Studied in Clinical Trials  
SIV.1 Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Studies within the Development 
Programme  
Criterion: Patients <18 years of age 
Reason for exclusion: The safety and efficacy for patients <18 years of age has not yet been 
established; paediatric trials are ongoing. The efficacy and safety of this molecule in Phase 3 
clinical trials were first studied and established in adults.  
Is it considered to be included as missing information? No 
Rationale: While the clinical development programme did not include children and adolescents, 
given the pharmacology and known safety profile of lasmiditan, the likely safety profile in 
patients <18 years is not expected to be different from adult patients. In addition, data from a 
pharmacokinetic study in children with migraine showed pharmacokinetic findings (in patients 
>40 kg) similar to those in adults with adverse events consistent with the known safety profile of 
lasmiditan. Early data from the ongoing Phase 3 studies (double-blind placebo-controlled H8H-
MC-LAHV [LAHV] and open-label H8H-MC-LAHW [LAHW]), suggest similar tolerability 
and safety profile in children and adolescents, with no new patterns or trends observed in the 
adverse events reported. 
Criterion: Women who are pregnant 
Reason for exclusion: This is a standard exclusion criterion in clinical development. Nonclinical 
studies using pregnant rats and rabbits demonstrated adverse effects on the embryos, foetuses, 
and offspring in association with maternal toxicity. However, there is insufficient information on 
the effects of lasmiditan on human maternal and foetal health. Women of childbearing potential 
are expected to comprise a significant proportion of the target migraine population. Through 12 
June 2020, there were 26 pregnancies in maternal exposure (total female exposure N=4987) and 
1 pregnancy from paternal exposure reported during the clinical development programme. Of the 
26 pregnancies reported, 16 were exposed to lasmiditan during the first trimester of their 
pregnancy. There were no patients exposed to lasmiditan beyond the first trimester. The 
remaining 10 pregnancies were not temporally related to lasmiditan dosing. Outcomes from the 
16 pregnancies that were exposed to lasmiditan included 5 normal births, 3 spontaneous 
abortions, 1 elective termination, and 1 premature birth. Additionally, 3 cases are awaiting 
follow-up information regarding the birth and delivery and 3 cases were lost to follow-up.  
Is it considered to be included as missing information? No 
Rationale: While pregnant women were excluded from clinical trials, given the pharmacology 
and known safety profile of lasmiditan, the likely safety profile in pregnant women is not 
expected to be different from other adult patients. In addition, data from use of lasmiditan in 
pregnant women will also be available from planned safety studies in this population to assess 
adverse pregnancy outcomes. 
LY573144 
EU Risk Management Plan (Version 1.1) 
Page 21 
Criterion: Patients with CVD 
Phase 2 studies excluded patients with history or evidence of CAD, ischaemic or haemorrhagic 
stroke, controlled or uncontrolled historical or current hypertension and those with use of 
hemodynamically active CV drugs. The first Phase 3 study (COL MIG-301/H8H-CD-LAHJ 
[301/LAHJ]) limited the exclusion to those with a known history or evidence of CAD, clinically 
relevant arrhythmia, and uncontrolled hypertension. The Phase 3 studies, COL MIG-302/H8H-
CD-LAHK (302/LAHK) and H8H-MC-LAIJ (LAIJ) did not exclude these patients.  
Reason for exclusion: Patients with CV conditions were excluded in earlier studies to avoid 
exposing such patients to an investigational drug whose safety profile was not fully established. 
The exclusion criteria were then removed from Studies 302/LAHK and LAIJ in order to 
specifically assess the safety of lasmiditan in this population as the mode of action of lasmiditan 
was not predicted to have adverse ischaemic CV effects. The CVD noted at baseline in oral 
placebo-controlled Phase 2 and 3 studies (by SMQ) included 63 patients with ischaemic heart 
disease, 136 patients with cardiac arrhythmias, 30 patients with cardiomyopathy, and 48 patients 
with ischaemic CNS vascular conditions. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information? No 
Rationale: The Phase 2/3 clinical development programme for lasmiditan included a well-
balanced population across lasmiditan- and placebo-treated patients in the placebo-controlled 
studies (COL MIG-202/H8H-CD-LAHO [202/LAHO], H8H-JE-LAIH [LAIH], 301/LAHJ, 
302/LAHK, LAIJ) with respect to the presence of baseline CVD (16.3% of lasmiditan-treated 
patients and 16.9% of placebo-treated patients) and 1 or more CV risk factors (CVRFs) 
(lasmiditan-treated patients 62.4% with 1, 23.2% with 2, and 4.6% with 3 CVRFs; placebo-
treated patients: 61.5% with 1, 23.5% with 2, and 4.9% with 3 CVRFs) in addition to their 
migraine history. The rates of risk factors appear to be generally representative of the overall 
migraine population. In the oral placebo-controlled trials 16.3% of patients on lasmiditan 
reported CVD at baseline, with hypertension (and related conditions) reported most frequently 
(n=642, 13.1%). The CVDs noted at baseline (by SMQ) included 63 patients with ischaemic 
heart disease, 136 patients with cardiac arrhythmias, 30 patients with cardiomyopathy, and 48 
patients with ischaemic CNS vascular conditions when combined across placebo and lasmiditan 
treatment groups. These numbers, although relatively lower compared with self-reported CV 
events in the AMPP study (Buse et al. 2017), are reflective of the migraine population that were 
included based on inclusion criteria. 
Safety in patients with CVD or CVRFs is not expected to be different from in those patients 
without CVD or CVRFs. 
Criterion: Patients with significant hepatic and renal impairment. 
Reason for exclusion: To avoid exposing a patient with an acute or known serious hepatic and/or 
renal condition to an investigational drug whose safety profile is not fully established. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information? No 
LY573144 
EU Risk Management Plan (Version 1.1) 
Page 22 
Rationale: Lasmiditan undergoes hepatic and extrahepatic metabolism primarily by non- 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, with ketone reduction to the alcohol S-M8 representing the 
major pathway. Renal excretion is a very minor route of lasmiditan clearance. Recovery of 
unchanged lasmiditan in urine was low, with approximately 2% of the dose recovered by 24 
hours post dose and was consistent for all dose levels. Given that the target population for 
migraine is predominantly young adults, the proportion of these patients with pre-existing renal 
and/or hepatic conditions will likely be limited. Further, in 2 separate studies of lasmiditan in 
patients with impaired hepatic function (Study COL MIG-114/H8H-CD-LAHF [114/LAHF]; 
mild hepatic impairment n=8 and moderate hepatic impairment n=8) and impaired renal function 
(Study COL MIG-113/H8H-CD-LAHN [113/LAHN]; severe renal impairment n=8), lasmiditan 
was generally safe and well-tolerated by subjects with normal hepatic/renal function and by 
subjects with mild-to-moderate hepatic/severe renal impairment.  
Overall, during the clinical development programme, there has been no pattern or trend observed 
for renal or hepatic adverse events. 
SIV.2 Limitations to Detect Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trial Development 
Programmes  
The clinical development programme is unlikely to detect certain types of adverse reactions such 
as rare adverse reactions, adverse reactions with a long latency, or those caused by prolonged 
exposure because lasmiditan is developed for acute treatment of migraine with PRN use and 
most Phase 2 and 3 placebo-controlled studies were based on treatment of a single migraine 
attack. 
The size of the lasmiditan-exposed patient group in migraine oral placebo-controlled clinical 
trials (N=4861) means that detection of adverse drug events with a 95% level of certainty is 
limited to those which occur at a frequency of greater than 1 in 1620 patients (0.06%).  
SIV.3 Limitations in Respect to Populations Typically Under-represented in 
Clinical Trial Development Programmes  
Since lasmiditan is developed for acute treatment of migraine with PRN use and most Phase 2 
and 3 placebo-controlled studies were based on treatment of single migraine attack, calculation 
of exposures in person-time was not feasible for typically under-represented populations.

Lasmiditan was first approved in the US (first global approval) on 11 October 2019 by the FDA 
(FDA 2019). However, marketing authorization was not granted until the final recommendation 
of the Drug Enforcement Administration to place lasmiditan (REYVOW) in Schedule V of the 
Controlled Substance Act (DEA 2020). This occurred on 31 January 2020 and lasmiditan has 
only been available by prescription since that date. 
As of 31 July 2020, 11 140 800 mg of lasmiditan have been sold in the postmarketing 
environment. All sales as of 31 July 2020 have occurred in the US. The number of patients 
cannot be adequately estimated at this time due to small volume sales and limited period of 
market availability.

SVI.1 - Potential for Misuse for Illegal Purposes  
Results from the human abuse potential study (H8H-MC-LAHB [LAHB]) showed higher drug 
liking for lasmiditan compared with placebo in recreational poly drug users. At a 
supratherapeutic dose of 400 mg lasmiditan, this effect was not significantly different from that 
seen with alprazolam. However, there is no evidence indicating that lasmiditan produces any 
physical dependence based on a lack of withdrawal symptoms observed in a multiple-ascending 
dose study where healthy subjects took a daily dose of study drug for 7 consecutive days (Study 
H8H-MC-LAHE [LAHE]).  
Additionally, in the oral Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies (202/LAHO, LAIH, 301/LAHJ, 
302/LAHK, LAIJ [double-blind and open label extension], and 305/LAHL), lasmiditan 
(N=5916) was associated with treatment-emergent adverse events ([TEAEs] defined as an 
adverse event [AE] that has its onset or worsens in severity within 48 hours of a lasmiditan dose) 
that are considered to be potentially associated with abuse liability (key AL terms) such as 
‘feeling abnormal’ (n=79, 1.3%), ‘euphoric mood’ (n=35, 0.6%), ‘abnormal dreams’ (n=27, 
0.5%), ‘hallucination, visual’ (n=14, 0.2%), ‘feeling drunk’ (n=13, 0.2%), ‘hallucination’(n=11, 
0.2%), ‘dysphoria’ (n=5, 0.1%), ‘mental impairment’ (n=5, 0.1%), 
‘depersonalisation/derealisation disorder’ (n=4, 0.1%), ‘hallucination, auditory’ (n=2, 0.0%), 
‘apathy’ (n=1, 0.0%) and illusion (n=1, 0.0%). These key abuse liability (AL) TEAEs that are 
more specific for the assessment of AL occurred uncommonly, but the majority were reported 
numerically more frequently for lasmiditan-treated patients than for placebo-treated patients. In 
the Phase 2/3 placebo-controlled trials (Studies 202/LAHO, LAIH, 301/LAHJ, 302/LAHK, and 
LAIJ) key AL TEAEs of feeling abnormal (p<.001), euphoric mood (p=.022), and hallucination, 
visual (p=.040) were reported with a significantly higher frequency in the lasmiditan-treated 
group than in the placebo-treated group. Drug misuse/abuse will be classified as an important 
potential risk in the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

SVII.1 Identification of Safety Concerns in the Initial RMP Submission  
SVII.1.1 Risks Not Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of 
Safety Concerns in the RMP  
Risks with minimal clinical impact on patients (in relation to the severity of the indication 
treated)  
 
Injuries secondary to neurological adverse drug reactions (ADRs):  
Although neurological ADRs (dizziness, somnolence, paraesthesia, fatigue, hypoesthesia, 
and incoordination) are commonly reported AEs with lasmiditan exposure, the majority 
of these AEs were not associated with serious outcomes such as injuries or accidents in 
the clinical development programme. Of the 2388 patients (from the oral Phase 2 and 
Phase 3 studies) with at least 1 reported CNS TEAE, 9 patients had accidents and or 
injuries that were noted to be in temporal proximity to the treatment-emergent nervous 
system AEs. On review, none of these were determined to be a consequence of the 
neurological AEs. Neurological events, although frequently observed with lasmiditan 
treatment, have not been associated with serious injuries/accidents or other adverse 
consequences that could lead to individual or public health risks and thus, are not 
considered important safety concerns at this point.  
Adverse reactions with clinical consequences, even serious, but occurring with a low frequency 
and considered to be acceptable in relation to the severity of the indication treated  
  Serotonin syndrome: 
Serotonin syndrome has been identified as an ADR with lasmiditan and may occur with 
lasmiditan alone or when used concomitantly with other drugs known to increase 
serotonin levels. While the impact of a serious serotonin syndrome may be high for an 
individual requiring medical intervention and discontinuation of lasmiditan, given that 
the use of lasmiditan is as a PRN drug and the rarity of severe/serious events, the risk for 
serotonin syndrome is considered minimal from a public health perspective and for the 
benefit-risk profile of lasmiditan at large. The adverse reaction of serotonin syndrome is 
thus not considered an important safety concern at this point.  
Known risks that require no further characterisation and are followed up via routine 
pharmacovigilance namely through signal detection and adverse reaction reporting, and for 
which the risk minimisation messages in the product information are adhered by prescribers (for 
example, actions being part of standard clinical practice in each EU Member state where the 
product is authorised) 
  None 
Known risks that do not impact the risk-benefit profile

SVII.1.2 Risks Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of 
Safety Concerns in the RMP  
Important Identified Risk 1: CNS effects and impaired ability to drive and use machines  
Risk-Benefit Impact: 
A simulated driving study (COL-MIG-106/H8H-CD-LAHG [106/LAHG]) demonstrated a dose-
dependent impact of lasmiditan on simulated driving as measured by standard deviation of lateral 
position (SDLP), lane exceedance, speed deviation, and other measures of driving safety. Effects 
on attention were also measured 90 minutes after a single oral dose of lasmiditan and at the 
approximate time of peak concentration of lasmiditan. For SDLP, 73% to 96% of subjects 
exceeded the impairment threshold of 4.4 cm (comparable to 0.05% blood alcohol concentration, 
the most common equivalent of legal alcohol limit for driving globally) across all 3 doses of 
lasmiditan (50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg). The increase in SDLP with the 200 mg dose was 
similar to a 1 mg dose of alprazolam. Although there were subjects who did not report TEAEs, 
they still demonstrated impairment in the simulated driving tests. In addition, although the 
majority of subjects said they felt safe to drive prior to the driving simulator assessment (80% of 
the subjects following the 50 mg dose of lasmiditan and 55% of subjects at the 200 mg dose), 
>50% showed driving impairment.  
A second study (H8H-MC-LAIF [LAIF]) conducted with 100 mg and 200 mg lasmiditan 
demonstrated that clinically meaningful impairment had resolved by 8 hours after dosing. 
Although a definitive association between lasmiditan use and road traffic accidents in the Phase 
2 and Phase 3 clinical trial population has not been seen, the ability to detect infrequent events 
such as road traffic accidents is limited in clinical trials, and it is possible that minor events were 
incompletely ascertained. Despite common reports of TEAEs that may impair mental ability in 
lasmiditan-treated patients in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 programs, no clear association was 
observed with road traffic accidents, impaired ability to use machinery, or other accidents and 
the occurrence of those TEAEs. Whilst a clear association between the observed effects and 
significant adverse outcomes has not been demonstrated in clinical trials, impairment of driving 
or use of machinery after exposure to lasmiditan can have serious consequences for both the 
patient as a driver and also for others (passengers, drivers of other vehicles involved in the 
accident, or pedestrians) in the real world. As a result, the risk of CNS effects and impaired 
ability to drive and use machines is considered an important identified risk based on its likely 
impact on the overall benefit-risk of lasmiditan exposure in the context of migraine treatment. 
LY573144 
 
EU Risk Management Plan (Version 1.1) 
Page 29 
Important Potential Risk 1: Adverse pregnancy outcomes 
Risk-Benefit Impact: In embryofoetal development studies with rats and rabbits, decreased 
foetal body weights and skeletal variations occurred concomitant with maternal toxicity in both 
rats and rabbits following exposure to lasmiditan. At the maternally toxic dose (115 mg/kg) in 
rabbits only, there was a slight increase in postimplantation loss, and foetal CV (ventricular 
septal) defects occurred at a low incidence. In a rat pre- and postnatal study, prolonged gestation 
and parturition and an increased number of stillborn pups and increased frequency of postnatal 
death occurred in conjunction with maternal toxicity (225 mg/kg).  
There have been 26 pregnancies in the completed and ongoing Phase 2 and 3 studies with limited 
information on outcomes. As such, the current data are too limited to draw conclusions about the 
effect of lasmiditan exposure during pregnancy in humans. 
The nonclinical effects observed following lasmiditan treatment of pregnant animals occurred at 
exposures associated with maternal toxicity and which were at higher doses than would be used 
in humans, and no adverse outcomes have been demonstrated to date. As a result, there is no 
current impact on benefit-risk in human use. However, women of childbearing potential will 
constitute a significant proportion of the target patient population in the treatment of migraine, so 
if further human experience on use in pregnancy provides consistent evidence of significant 
adverse pregnancy outcomes effects, this risk, when balanced against the potential benefit for a 
nonlife-threatening condition like migraine, will impact the benefit-risk of lasmiditan.  
Important Potential Risk 2: Drug misuse/abuse 
Risk-Benefit Impact: Based upon the findings from a human abuse potential study in 
recreational drug users (Study LAHB), lasmiditan 100 and 200 mg doses demonstrated higher 
drug liking compared with placebo based on Drug Liking scores. The supra-therapeutic dose of 
lasmiditan (400 mg) was not significantly different from alprazolam, indicating a potential for 
abuse in recreational drug users.  
From the Phase 2 and 3 studies in patients treated with lasmiditan, there have been reports of 
euphoric mood, feeling drunk, feeling abnormal, and hallucinations that could be associated with 
AL.  
Patients with recent or current evidence of abuse of any drug, prescription or illicit, or alcohol 
were excluded from the clinical studies; however, it is possible that those with such history 
and/or risk factors (including comorbidities that predispose patients to drug abuse such as 
depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder) may misuse and/or abuse lasmiditan when 
prescribed in real-world practice (Back and Brady 2008; Peterlin et al. 2011). Given the adverse 
consequences (including psychological, behavioural, and social changes) related to drug 
misuse/abuse, if this risk was confirmed in every day clinical practice and in more extensive 
patient exposures than included in clinical development to date, the benefit-risk of lasmiditan 
would be adversely impacted.

EU Risk Management Plan (Version 1.1) 
Page 30 
Missing Information 1: Long-term intermittent use 
Risk-Benefit Impact: The maximum treatment exposure duration was 12 months in the 
migraine clinical development programme. During this period, patients were exposed to varying 
frequency of doses based on the frequency of their migraine attacks. Although the current data 
do not pose any concern related to use of lasmiditan for 1 year, migraine is a chronic condition, 
and it is anticipated that acute intermittent treatment will continue for long periods of time. 
Long-term use is considered to be missing information worthy of further study to collect more 
data on outcomes in a larger population and for longer periods of time than occurred in clinical 
development. If the data demonstrate that long-term use is associated with clinically meaningful 
adverse outcomes or morbidity, this could impact the benefit-risk in the context of acute 
treatment of a nonlife-threatening condition such as migraine.

SVII.3 Details of Important Identified Risks, Important Potential Risks, 
and Missing Information  
SVII.3.1 Presentation of Important Identified Risks and Important 
Potential Risks  
Important Identified Risk: CNS effects and impaired ability to drive and use machines 
Potential mechanisms:  
As a centrally penetrant selective 5HT1F receptor agonist, the most common adverse effects 
observed with lasmiditan are of neurological nature, including dizziness and somnolence. It is 
plausible that these adverse effects may contribute to or cause impaired driving and the use of 
machinery.  
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence: 
A simulated driving study in healthy volunteers demonstrated a dose-dependent impact of 
lasmiditan on driving, as observed by a number of different measures of driving safety. Adverse 
effects on attention were also observed 90 minutes after a single oral dose of lasmiditan and at 
the approximate time of peak concentration of lasmiditan. In this driving study, 73% to 96% of 
subjects who received any of the 3 doses of lasmiditan (50 mg, 100 mg, or 200 mg) showed 
impairment greater than the legal alcohol limit for driving (0.05% blood alcohol content). The 
majority of subjects felt safe to drive prior to the simulated driving assessment, but >50% 
showed driving impairment.  
A second study conducted with 100 mg and 200 mg lasmiditan demonstrated that clinically 
meaningful driving impairment had resolved by 8 hours after dosing. 
LY573144 
EU Risk Management Plan (Version 1.1) 
Page 31 
Despite common reports of TEAEs that may impair mental ability in lasmiditan-treated patients, 
in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 programs, no clear association was observed with road traffic 
accidents, impaired ability to use machinery, or other accidents and the occurrence of those 
TEAEs. However, the role of the CNS effects in contributing to an impairment in driving or in 
using machinery cannot be excluded.  
Characterisation of the risk: 
  Frequency in the simulated driving study (106/LAHG):  
o  Total collisions represent the sum of collisions with other vehicles and off-road crashes 
in a 100 km highway simulated driving test. These counts also include the number of 
times that a lane deviation exceeded 4 feet (that is, a crash-likely event). The mean 
number of total collisionsa with lasmiditan were: 
o  1.3 (50 mg) 
o  2.3 (100 mg) 
o  4.4 (200 mg) 
aNearly all collisions in the total collision score were due to off-road collisions.  
 
In the integrated clinical trial database (as of 12 June 2020) 
o  There were 4 AEs of driving-related accidents reported in the oral placebo-controlled 
Phase 2/3 studies.  
o  In all oral lasmiditan studies (including uncontrolled studies), a total of 12 unique 
driving accidents were identified, 10 of which were AEs. In the 2 accidents reported as 
TEAEs (1 considered a TEAE because of imputed dosing and the other event occurring 
2 days after the last dose), the patient was the driver at the time of the accident; both 
were nonserious and of mild and moderate severity. One of these TEAEs reported a 
related injury of ‘contusion’.  
o  Three additional driving-related incidents of relevance were identified from Studies 
LAIJ and LAIH based on the ‘Assessment of Driving Accidents and Violations’ 
questionnaire. Of these, 2 were in patients on lasmiditan and 1 in a patient on placebo. 
In the 2 lasmiditan patients (both drivers at the time of the incident), 1 incident 
occurred 3 hours postdosing with 200 mg and 1 at 10 hours postdosing with 100 mg. 
The incidents were not reported as TEAEs (no severity noted), and 1 of these presented 
with TEAE of paraesthesia and fatigue at the time of the incident. 
  No driving/machinery use related accidents have been reported from postmarketing use of 
lasmiditan through 12 June 2020.  
Risk factors and risk groups: 
No specific risk factors and/or risk groups that have a risk higher than the overall population 
have been identified.  
Preventability: 
There are currently no data on the predictability of this risk or factors that would increase the 
risk, and no information that would indicate that this risk can be detected at an early stage in 
order to mitigate serious outcomes. Although a dose-dependent impact on various driving related 
parameters was observed in the simulated driving study, overall, the majority of subjects at all 
LY573144 
EU Risk Management Plan (Version 1.1) 
Page 32 
doses had driving impairment. Furthermore, on self-reported measures indicating the extent to 
which subjects were aware of CNS sedative effects, only 20% and 44.7% of the subjects reported 
not feeling safe to drive following the 50 mg and 200 mg dose of lasmiditan respectively, in spite 
of clear evidence of driving impairment. The Reference Safety Information, and hence local 
labels, will reflect relevant data and include a cautionary statement for prescribers emphasizing 
the risk and the importance of adhering to the period of driving restriction (8 hours post dose) to 
mitigate/minimise the risk. A similar statement will also be included in the outer packaging of 
the drug carton. 
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product: 
Driving impairment/use of machinery can have serious consequences for both the patient as a 
driver/user and others (passengers or drivers of other vehicles involved in the accident). As a 
result, if this risk is not adequately managed, then benefit-risk overall will be impacted in the 
context of migraine treatment. 
Public health impact: 
Given that serious injury/accidents secondary to driving impairment/use of machinery following 
lasmiditan use may involve other individuals as well as the patient, if this risk is realised it could 
potentially have a significant public health impact.  
Important Potential Risk: Adverse pregnancy outcomes 
Potential mechanisms:  
The potential mechanisms by which lasmiditan may cause impaired embryo foetal development 
and/or adverse pregnancy outcomes have not been identified. 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence: 
In nonclinical studies in which pregnant rats and rabbits were dosed with lasmiditan, the 
offspring had decreased body weights and skeletal variations were observed. In rabbits only, 
there was a small increase in post implantation loss (miscarriage) and in the number of foetal CV 
defects. An increased number of stillborn pups and an increase in the frequency of postnatal 
death occurred in rats. All effects occurred in circumstances of maternal toxicity (that is, where 
there were significant reductions in maternal body weight and food consumption, and at 
exposures higher than would be used in patients).  
Characterisation of the risk: 
There have been 26 pregnancies in the completed Phase 2 and 3 studies with limited information 
on outcomes (female lasmiditan exposure n=4987). Of the 26 pregnancies reported, 16 patients 
were exposed to lasmiditan during the pregnancy. Outcomes of these 16 pregnancies included 5 
normal births (0.10%), 3 spontaneous abortions (0.06%), 1 elective termination (0.02%), and 1 
premature birth (0.02%). Additionally, 3 of these cases are awaiting follow-up information 
(0.06%) regarding the birth and delivery and 3 were lost to follow-up (0.06%). As such, the 
LY573144 
EU Risk Management Plan (Version 1.1) 
Page 33 
current data are too limited to draw conclusions on the characterisation of this risk in 
humans.  
No pregnancies have been reported from postmarketing use of lasmiditan. 
Risk factors and risk groups: 
Women of childbearing potential who become pregnant during treatment with lasmiditan are the 
at risk population, but no specific risk factors for abnormal foetal outcomes have been identified.  
Preventability: 
The Reference Safety Information and local labels will reflect that there are insufficient human 
data to establish the safety of lasmiditan during pregnancy. It will also clearly state that 
lasmiditan should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit justifies the potential 
risk to the foetus. However, it is likely that women exposed to lasmiditan will become pregnant 
in routine clinical practice, as the indicated population is predominantly women of childbearing 
potential. Therefore, it is unlikely that this risk will be entirely preventable in everyday clinical 
practice.  
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product: 
The findings from the nonclinical developmental and reproductive toxicity studies and their 
potential implications on use in human pregnancy exposure have been classified as an important 
potential risk, as the current data are too limited to draw any definitive conclusions or refute 
any similar adverse effects in pregnant women. In addition, the potential for other adverse 
effects of lasmiditan on human foetal development is not known.  
If data from further systematic study or other data sources demonstrate that use in pregnant 
women with migraine is associated with adverse outcomes to the mother, foetus, or baby, there 
could be an impact on the benefit-risk in the context of migraine treatment, depending on the 
clinical significance of the findings from these studies. 
Public health impact: 
Although nonclinical effects were observed at higher doses associated with maternal toxicity and 
with daily dosing during gestation and lactation in toxicology studies, the impact on human 
exposure is unknown. The existing data on pregnancy outcomes in pregnant women treated with 
lasmiditan is very limited, with no evidence to date of medically significant abnormalities in the 
foetus or offspring. Therefore, the population-level impact is not readily quantifiable, but overall 
is expected to be low. 
Important Potential Risk: Drug misuse/abuse 
Potential mechanisms:  
Although it is primarily a CNS active substance, the potential mechanism by which lasmiditan 
may cause drug misuse or abuse has not been identified.  
LY573144 
 
EU Risk Management Plan (Version 1.1) 
Page 34 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence: 
The findings from nonclinical studies with lasmiditan were either not indicative of or 
inconclusive with respect to any misuse or abuse potential. The main evidence source came from 
a clinical human abuse potential study in users of multiple recreational drugs (Study LAHB). 
This study demonstrated that the possibility for lasmiditan to have a higher AL than placebo 
could not be excluded. The mean Drug Liking scores with lasmiditan were shown to increase 
with increasing doses up to 400 mg and, at this highest dose, were seen at a similar rate to that 
observed following administration of the positive control, alprazolam. The subjects in the study 
considered that the effects of lasmiditan were most similar to those of benzodiazepines. In 
addition, there was a clear dose-related trend in the incidence of AEs reported in this study that 
could indicate abuse potential of lasmiditan, especially somnolence, euphoric mood, and a 
feeling of relaxation. In the Phase 2/3 placebo-controlled studies, the number of lasmiditan-
treated patients reporting feeling abnormal; hallucination, visual; or euphoric mood was 
statistically significantly greater than in placebo-treated patients.  
Characterisation of the risk: 
In the Lilly Search Category (LSC) for Abuse Liability Terms, 1759 (36.4%) lasmiditan-treated 
patients reported at least 1 AL TEAE compared with 177 (8.4%) placebo-treated patients in the 
Phase 2/3 placebo-controlled studies (202/LAHO, LAIH, 301/LAHJ, 302/LAHK, LAIJ). The 
most frequently reported (≥2%) AL TEAEs (lasmiditan vs. placebo) were dizziness (n=960, 
19.9% vs. n=68, 3.2%), somnolence (n=350, 7.2% vs. n=47, 2.3%), paraesthesia (n=306, 6.4% 
vs. n=30, 1.4%), fatigue (n=258, 5.3% vs. n=20, 1.0%), and asthenia (n=122, 2.5% vs. n=4, 
0.2%), which do not, by themselves, signify abuse potential, but rather are common TEAEs 
within the lasmiditan clinical programme. Therefore, several key terms from the LSC list are 
considered more specific to abuse potential and capture events that may represent either of the 
following were used to better characterise AL 
 
rewarding effects (for example, euphoric mood), which could lead to abuse in humans, 
or  
  effects which could reduce or offset the likelihood of abuse (for example, dysphoria) 
The frequency of the occurrence of TEAEs for these key terms in the oral placebo-control Phase 
2 and Phase 3 studies are summarised in Table SVII.1.

In the integrated database through 12 June 2020, there have been reports of key AL TEAEs 
(based on all oral integrated lasmiditan exposure across studies). Events reported in ≥10 patients 
included: feeling abnormal (n=79, 1.3%); euphoric mood (n=35, 0.6%); abnormal dreams (n=27, 
0.5%); hallucination, visual (n=14, 0.2%); feeling drunk (n=13, 0.2%); and hallucination (n=11, 
0.2%). 
No definitive patterns of abuse of lasmiditan were reported or identified during the Phase 2 and 
Phase 3 clinical trials based on medical review of the data. 
No events of abuse or misuse of lasmiditan have been reported from postmarketing data through 
12 June 2020. 
Risk factors and risk groups: 
No specific risk factors or risk groups have been identified from the clinical trial programme in 
patients. However, based on a clinical human abuse potential study, it is possible that certain 
patient groups could be more likely to misuse and/or abuse lasmiditan when it is prescribed. 
These could include patients with recent or current evidence of abuse of any drug (including 
prescription medicines, illicit drugs, or alcohol), or those with other conditions that might 
predispose them to drug abuse such as depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder 
(Back and Brady 2008; Peterlin et al. 2011).  
Preventability: 
The Reference Safety Information, and hence local labels, will reflect relevant data and include a 
cautionary statement for prescribers to assess patients for history of risk factors and/or abuse as 
well as evaluate for any signs of lasmiditan abuse.  
However, the extent to which this effect is preventable is unknown at this stage.  
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product: 
Given the adverse consequences (including psychological, behavioural, and social changes) 
related to drug misuse/abuse, if this risk was observed in every day clinical practice and in more 
extensive patient exposures than included in clinical development to date, the benefit-risk of 
lasmiditan would be adversely impacted.  
Public health impact: 
Although the adverse consequences (including psychological, behavioural, and social changes) 
related to drug misuse/abuse may impact the benefit-risk of lasmiditan at an individual patient 
level, the likelihood of a public health impact is low. 
SVII.3.2 Presentation of the Missing Information  
Missing Information: Long-term intermittent use 
Evidence source:  
The long-term safety of lasmiditan beyond 1 year of intermittent use has not been established 
through the clinical trial programme. As migraine is a chronic condition, long-term intermittent 
LY573144 
EU Risk Management Plan (Version 1.1) 
Page 37 
use is anticipated in routine clinical practice, although assessment of utilisation patterns for 
triptans suggests that the majority of patients discontinue the prescribed treatment within 1 year 
(Lombard et al. 2018). If lasmiditan use patterns are similar to triptan use patterns, then there 
may be a small population of patients that utilise lasmiditan for more than 1 year, which will 
need to be identified to study safety concerns in that subgroup.  
Anticipated risk/consequence of the missing information:  
It could be anticipated that with long-term use, adverse effects that are infrequent and/or have a 
longer latency period could occur. Therefore, further evaluation of adverse events with a low 
frequency and/or long latency is warranted.

III.2 Additional Pharmacovigilance Activities  
Lasmiditan Exposure and Driving 
Study Short Name and Title: Study H8H-MC-B006: Lasmiditan Use and Motor Vehicle 
Accidents in Real-World Settings in the US 
Rationale and Study Objectives: 
A driving simulation study (106/LAHG) has demonstrated a dose-dependent impact of 
lasmiditan on simulated driving and on an embedded divided attention test measured at 
90 minutes after taking a single oral dose of lasmiditan. Study LAIF, which was conducted to 
determine the duration of effect of 100 mg and 200 mg lasmiditan compared with placebo on 
simulated driving performance at 8, 12, and 24 hours after dosing, demonstrated that clinically 
meaningful impairment was resolved by 8 hours after dosing. The clinical trial data on use of 
lasmiditan in patients and any association with road traffic accidents was limited and 
inconclusive. In the Phase 2/3 studies, despite a higher frequency of TEAEs that may represent 
impairment in mental ability in lasmiditan-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients, 
there were no associations between those TEAEs and driving accidents.  
A post marketing observational study is proposed to investigate lasmiditan use and motor vehicle 
accidents in real-world settings. Specifically, the primary study objective is the following  
  To evaluate the potential relationship between real-world lasmiditan use and motor 
vehicle accidents in the US. 
Study Design: 
An observational study is proposed in a real-world setting to establish a background rate of 
motor vehicle accidents for patients prescribed lasmiditan, patients prescribed other antimigraine 
medications, and/or migraine patients without any antimigraine prescriptions. The observational 
study will evaluate the association between lasmiditan and driving impairments, adjusting for 
LY573144 
EU Risk Management Plan (Version 1.1) 
Page 40 
confounding factors, if a sufficient number of lasmiditan-treated patients will accrue during the 
study period.  
This study will recruit experienced drivers and will administer patient baseline and follow-up 
surveys on a monthly basis over a 12-month period to collect data on medication use, driving 
behaviors and any accident information. Patient survey data will be linked with data from the US 
Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) for car accident validation in Connecticut, North 
Carolina, Florida and Washington to validate details on reported motor vehicle accidents and to 
obtain additional details on these events. A descriptive interim analysis is planned to provide 
baseline assessment of lasmiditan-treated patients. 
Study Population: 
The study population of interest includes patients with migraine exposed to lasmiditan, other 
antimigraine prescriptions, and untreated patients.

Lasmiditan Exposure During Pregnancy and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes 
Study Short Name and Title: Study H8H-MC-B002: Observational Cohort Study of Exposure to 
Lasmiditan During Pregnancy 
Rationale and Study Objectives: 
Pregnant women were not included in the clinical development programme; however, the 
indicated population for migraine is predominantly women, many of whom are of childbearing 
age. For risk management purposes, this represents missing information and adverse outcomes in 
pregnancy could impact the benefit-risk. Adverse effects, including abnormal embryo-foetal 
development and reproductive toxicity, were observed in rats and rabbits exposed to maternally 
toxic doses of lasmiditan during nonclinical development. Although it is uncertain how well the 
findings in the animal studies can predict the effects in humans, the potential for adverse 
pregnancy outcomes in pregnant women treated with lasmiditan are safety concerns that warrant 
further investigation.  
A postmarketing pregnancy study is planned to describe exposure to lasmiditan before or during 
pregnancy and to investigate any association between maternal exposure of lasmiditan before or 
during pregnancy and adverse outcomes including major congenital malformations, spontaneous 
abortions, stillbirths, preterm births, and small-for-gestational-age births. This study plans to 
compare the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with lasmiditan exposure 
LY573144 
EU Risk Management Plan (Version 1.1) 
Page 41 
during pregnancy to the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes in unexposed comparator 
groups.  
The objectives are 
  To estimate the prevalence of major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions, 
stillbirths, preterm births, and small-for-gestational-age births in pregnant women with 
migraine exposed to lasmiditan and pregnant women not exposed to lasmiditan. 
  To compare the prevalence of major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions, 
stillbirths, preterm births, and small-for-gestational-age births in pregnant women with 
migraine exposed to lasmiditan to pregnant women not exposed to lasmiditan. 
Study Design: 
This is a comparative safety study conducted among pregnant women using electronic claims 
data. The comparative analysis will assess pregnancy, maternal, and infant outcomes, comparing 
pregnant women exposed to lasmiditan to pregnant women not exposed to lasmiditan. Utilisation 
among patients treated with lasmiditan and other acute migraine medications (such as triptans) 
will also be described. Medical record review will be used to obtain additional information on 
outcomes and confounders where feasible. 
Study Population: 
The source population for this study will include pregnant women with a migraine diagnosis 
exposed to lasmiditan compared to unexposed pregnant woman in the US.

Drug Utilisation Study 
Study Short Name and Title: Study H8H-MC-B005: Real-World Observational Study to Assess 
Drug Utilisation Patterns in the US Among Migraine Patients Treated with Lasmiditan 
Rationale and Study Objectives: 
Drug abuse/misuse is an important potential risk based on drug liking data observed in 
recreational drug users treated with lasmiditan. Real-world use of lasmiditan will be studied by 
accessing a healthcare database in order to evaluate use patterns (abuse/misuse) after approval as 
well as duration of use.  
Study objectives are

to assess off-label treatment with lasmiditan among paediatric and adolescent migraine 
patients, and 
to describe characteristics of lasmiditan treated patients, including patients treated beyond 
1-year. 
Study Design:  
Cohort study using a US electronic claims database to assess drug utilisation patterns. The 
potential for abuse and misuse will be assessed by evaluating irregular prescription refill 
behaviours over a period of 2 years. Treatment patterns will be described and, where possible, 
diagnosis information will confirm indication for use.

Long-Term Safety Study 
Study Short Name and Title: Study H8H-MC-B010: Real-World Observational Study to Assess 
Safety Outcomes in the US among Migraine Patients Treated with Lasmiditan Long-Term. 
Rationale and Study Objectives: 
Migraine is a chronic condition; therefore, long-term lasmiditan use beyond 1 year is reasonably 
anticipated in routine clinical practice. Adverse effects that are infrequent, have a longer latency 
period, and/or are infrequent among migraine patients could occur. 
Given the clinical study designs, specifically the respective inclusion/exclusion criteria and the 
duration of studies, use of lasmiditan over a longer (>1 year) duration of time have not been 
adequately studied. Treatment patterns for patients treated with lasmiditan and safety outcomes 
among these patients will be studied by accessing a healthcare database. Among patients treated 
beyond 1 year, incidence rates for safety outcomes such as CV, malignancies, and other rare 
events will be described.  
Study objectives are

 
 
to assess safety outcomes among patients treated with lasmiditan for longer than 1 year, 
and 
to describe characteristics of lasmiditan treated patients treated long-term, beyond 1 year. 
Study Design: 
Cohort study using a US electronic claims database to assess safety outcomes among patients 
treated with lasmiditan for longer than 1 year. Treatment patterns among patients treated for 
longer than 1 year will be described and, where possible, diagnosis information will confirm 
indication for use. To evaluate long-term safety, this study will assess safety outcomes for long-
term users, patients treated with lasmiditan beyond 1 year. Safety outcomes will include known 
and emergent outcomes using electronic claims data for patients identified as long-term 
intermittent users. 
Patient duration of exposure cannot be accurately estimated at this time, and limitations in 
patient follow-up exist in real-world data sources, such as patients switching between treatment 
providers. It is intended to initiate patient follow-up from start of exposure until the patient 
discontinues therapy, the patient is lost to follow-up, or occurrence of an event, at which point 
they will be censored.

Part VI: Summary of the Risk Management Plan  
Summary of Risk Management Plan for RAYVOW (lasmiditan 
hemisuccinate)  
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for RAYVOW. The RMP details 
important risks of RAYVOW, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will 
be obtained about RAYVOW’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
RAYVOW’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how RAYVOW should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for RAYVOW should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all of which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
RAYVOW’s RMP. 
I - The Medicine and What It is Used for  
RAYVOW is authorised for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults (see 
SmPC for the full indication). It contains lasmiditan hemisuccinate as the active substance and it 
is given by tablet. 
Further information about the evaluation of RAYVOW’s benefits can be found in RAYVOW’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s webpage (link to the EPAR summary landing page). 
II - Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or 
Further Characterise the Risks  
Important risks of RAYVOW, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about RAYVOW’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (for 
example, with or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including the periodic safety update report assessment, so that immediate 
LY573144 
EU Risk Management Plan (Version 1.1) 
Page 52 
action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance 
activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of RAYVOW is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of Important Risks and Missing Information  
Important risks of RAYVOW are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of RAYVOW. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to 
information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (for example, on the long-term use of the medicine).

Additional pharmacovigilance 
activities 
A simulated driving study in healthy volunteers demonstrated a dose-
dependent impact of lasmiditan on driving, as observed by a number of 
different measures of driving safety. Adverse effects on attention were also 
observed 90 minutes after a single oral dose of lasmiditan and at the 
approximate time of peak concentration of lasmiditan. In this driving 
study, 73% to 96% of subjects who received any of the 3 doses of 
lasmiditan (50 mg, 100 mg, or 200 mg), showed impairment greater than 
the legal alcohol limit for driving (0.05% blood alcohol content). The 
majority of subjects felt safe to drive prior to the simulated driving 
assessment, but >50% showed driving impairment.  
A second study conducted with 100 mg and 200 mg lasmiditan 
demonstrated that clinically meaningful driving impairment had resolved 
by 8 hours after dosing. 
Despite common reports of TEAEs that may impair mental ability in 
lasmiditan-treated patients in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 programs, no clear 
association was observed with road traffic accidents, impaired ability to 
use machinery, or other accidents and the occurrence of those TEAEs. 
However, the role of the CNS effects in contributing to an impairment in 
driving or in using machinery cannot be excluded. 
No specific risk factors and/or risk groups that have a risk higher than the

Important potential risk: adverse pregnancy outcomes 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
In nonclinical studies in which pregnant rats and rabbits were dosed with 
lasmiditan, the offspring had decreased body weights and skeletal 
variations were observed. In rabbits only, there was a small increase in 
post implantation loss (miscarriage) and in the number of foetal CV 
defects. An increased number of stillborn pups and an increase in the 
frequency of postnatal death occurred in rats. All effects occurred in 
circumstances of maternal toxicity (that is, where there were significant 
reductions in maternal body weight and food consumption, and at 
exposures higher than would be used in patients). 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
Women of childbearing potential who become pregnant during treatment 
with lasmiditan are the at risk population, but no specific risk factors for 
abnormal foetal outcomes have been identified.

The findings from nonclinical studies with lasmiditan were either not 
indicative of or inconclusive with respect to any misuse or abuse potential. 
The main evidence source came from a clinical human abuse potential 
study in users of multiple recreational drugs (Study LAHB). This study 
demonstrated that the possibility for lasmiditan to have a higher AL than 
placebo could not be excluded. The mean Drug Liking scores with 
lasmiditan were shown to increase with increasing doses up to 400 mg 
and, at this highest dose, were seen at a similar rate to that observed 
following administration of the positive control, alprazolam. The subjects 
in the study considered that the effects of lasmiditan were most similar to 
those of benzodiazepines. In addition, there was a clear dose-related trend 
in the incidence of AEs reported in this study that could indicate abuse 
potential of lasmiditan, especially somnolence, euphoric mood, and a 
feeling of relaxation. In the Phase 2/3 placebo-controlled studies, the 
number of lasmiditan-treated patients reporting feeling abnormal; 
hallucination, visual; or euphoric mood was statistically significantly 
greater than in placebo-treated patients. 
No specific risk factors or risk groups have been identified from the 
clinical trial programme in patients. However, based on a clinical human 
abuse potential study, it is possible that certain patient groups could be 
more likely to misuse and/or abuse lasmiditan when it is prescribed. These 
could include patients with recent or current evidence of abuse of any drug 
(including prescription medicines, illicit drugs, or alcohol), or those with 
other conditions that might predispose them to drug abuse such as 
depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (Back and Brady 
2008; Peterlin et al. 2011).

Study short name: Study H8H-MC-B006: Lasmiditan Use and Motor Vehicle Accidents in Real-
World Settings in the US  
Purpose of the study: A driving simulation study (106/LAHG) has demonstrated a dose-
dependent impact of lasmiditan on simulated driving and on an embedded divided attention test 
measured at 90 minutes after taking a single oral dose of lasmiditan. Study LAIF, which was 
conducted to determine the duration of effect of 100 mg and 200 mg lasmiditan compared with 
placebo on simulated driving performance at 8, 12, and 24 hours after dosing, demonstrated that 
clinically meaningful impairment was resolved by 8 hours after dosing. The clinical trial data on 
use of lasmiditan in patients and any association with road traffic accidents was limited and 
inconclusive. In the Phase 2/3 studies, despite a higher frequency of TEAEs that may represent 
impairment in mental ability in lasmiditan-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients, 
there were no associations between those TEAEs and driving accidents.  
A post marketing observational study is proposed to investigate lasmiditan use and motor vehicle 
accidents in real-world settings. Specifically, the primary study objective is the following  
  To evaluate the potential relationship between real-world lasmiditan use and motor 
vehicle accidents in the US. 
Study short name: Study H8H-MC-B002: Observational Cohort Study of Exposure to 
Lasmiditan During Pregnancy  
Purpose of the study: Pregnant women were not included in the clinical development 
programme; however, the indicated population for migraine is predominantly women, many of 
whom are of childbearing age. For risk management purposes, this represents missing 
information and adverse outcomes in pregnancy could impact the benefit-risk. Adverse effects, 
including abnormal embryo-foetal development and reproductive toxicity, were observed in rats 
and rabbits exposed to maternally toxic doses of lasmiditan during nonclinical development. 
Although it is uncertain how well the findings in the animal studies can predict the effects in 
humans, the potential for adverse pregnancy outcomes in pregnant women treated with 
lasmiditan are safety concerns that warrant further investigation.  
A postmarketing pregnancy study is planned to describe exposure to lasmiditan before or during 
pregnancy and to investigate any association between maternal exposure of lasmiditan before or 
during pregnancy and adverse outcomes including major congenital malformations, spontaneous 
abortions, stillbirths, preterm births, and small-for-gestational-age births. This study plans to 
compare the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with lasmiditan exposure

during pregnancy to the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes in unexposed comparator 
groups.  
The objectives are 
  To estimate the prevalence of major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions, 
stillbirths, preterm births, and small-for-gestational-age births in pregnant women with 
migraine exposed to lasmiditan and pregnant women not exposed to lasmiditan. 
  To compare the prevalence of major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions, 
stillbirths, preterm births, and small-for-gestational-age births in pregnant women with 
migraine exposed to lasmiditan to pregnant women not exposed to lasmiditan. 
Study short name: Study H8H-MC-B005: Real-World Observational Study to Assess Drug 
Utilisation Patterns in the US Among Migraine Patients Treated with Lasmiditan 
Purpose of the study: Drug abuse/misuse is an important potential risk based on drug liking data 
observed in recreational drug users treated with lasmiditan. The use of lasmiditan will be studied 
by accessing a healthcare database in order to evaluate use patterns (abuse/misuse) after 
approval. 
Study objectives are 
 
 
 
 
to assess drug utilisation patterns for lasmiditan prescriptions over a period of up to 
2 years after market availability in order to identify potential patterns of drug misuse or 
abuse 
to identify patients treated for longer than 1 year and describe treatment patterns 
to assess off-label treatment with lasmiditan among paediatric and adolescent migraine 
patients, and 
to describe characteristics of lasmiditan-treated patients, including patients treated 
beyond 1-year. 
Study short name: Study H8H-MC-B010: Real-World Observational Study to Assess Safety 
Outcomes in the US among Migraine Patients Treated with Lasmiditan Long-Term 
Purpose of the study: Migraine is a chronic condition; therefore, long-term lasmiditan use 
beyond 1 year is reasonably anticipated in routine clinical practice. Adverse effects that are 
infrequent, have a longer latency period, and/or are infrequent among migraine patients could 
occur. 
Given the clinical study designs, specifically the respective inclusion/exclusion criteria and the 
duration of studies, use of lasmiditan over a longer (>1 year) duration of time have not been 
adequately studied. Treatment patterns for patients treated with lasmiditan and safety outcomes 
among these patients will be studied by accessing a healthcare database. Among patients treated 
beyond 1 year, incidence rates for safety outcomes such as CV, malignancies, and other rare 
events will be described. 
Study objectives are

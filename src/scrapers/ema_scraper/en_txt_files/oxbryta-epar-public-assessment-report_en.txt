1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Global Blood Therapeutics Netherlands B.V. submitted on 23 December 2020 an application for 
marketing  authorisation  to  the  European  Medicines  Agency  (EMA)  for  Oxbryta,  through  the  centralised 
procedure falling within Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to 
the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 22 June 2017.  
Oxbryta was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/16/1769 on 18 November 2016 in the following 
condition: Treatment of sickle cell disease. 
The applicant initially applied for the following indication: 
“Oxbryta is indicated for the treatment of haemolytic anaemia in adults and paediatric patients 12 years of age 
and  older  with  sickle  cell  disease  (SCD).  Oxbryta  can  be  administered  alone  or  in  combination  with 
hydroxycarbamide.” 
Following  the  CHMP  positive  opinion  on  this  marketing  authorisation,  the  Committee  for  Orphan  Medicinal 
Products  (COMP)  reviewed  the  designation  of  Oxbryta  as  an  orphan  medicinal  product  in  the  approved 
indication. More information on the COMP’s review can be found in the Orphan maintenance assessment report 
published 
under 
the 
‘Assessment 
history’ 
tab 
on 
the 
Agency’s 
website: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/Oxbryta    
1.2.  Legal basis, dossier content  
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical and 
clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature substituting/supporting 
certain test(s) or study(ies). 
1.3.  Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant  to  Article  7 of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006,  the  application included  EMA  Decision  P/0489/2020 
dated 21 December 2020 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP) and on the granting of a 
waiver  and  a  deferral  for  voxelotor  in  accordance  with  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006  of  the  European 
Parliament and of the Council.  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP was not yet completed as some measures were deferred.

1.4.  Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
1.4.1.  Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan 
medicinal products. 
1.5.  Applicant’s requests for consideration 
1.5.1.  Accelerated assessment 
The applicant requested accelerated assessment in accordance with Article 14(9) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004. Upon examination of the request the CHMP concluded that the unmet medical need in patients 
with haemolytic anaemia associated with SCD is acknowledged, the innovative character of the mechanism of 
action is recognised and the provided evidence indicate that the drug has an effect on anaemia and 
haemolysis markers. However, provided data do not allow to assess to what extent the pivotal trial 
population represents the population with high unmet medical need. This precludes the assessment of the 
potential of the product to address the major public health interest and to provide major therapeutic 
innovation. Therefore the CHMP did not agree to the request for an accelerated assessment, as it was 
considered not sufficiently substantiated.  
1.5.2.  New active substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance voxelotor contained in the above medicinal product to be 
considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a medicinal 
product previously authorised within the European Union. 
1.6.  PRIME 
Voxelotor was granted eligibility to PRIME on 23 June 2017 in the following indication: Sickle Cell Disease. 
Eligibility to PRIME was granted at the time in view of the following: 
• 
• 
The unmet medical need has been justified on the basis of reduced survival of affected patients, 
clinical complications and morbidity;  
The potential to significantly address the unmet medical need has been justified on the basis of 
preliminary clinical observations, supporting that treatment with the proposed product may result in 
reduced haemolysis and improvements in haemoglobin levels.  
Upon granting of eligibility to PRIME, Paula van Hennik was appointed by the CHMP as rapporteur. 
A kick-off meeting was held on 22/01/2018. The objective of the meeting was to discuss the development 
programme and regulatory strategy for the product. The applicant was recommended to address the 
following key issues through relevant regulatory procedures:

Ms Audrey Sultana and Dr Peter Mol 
The applicant received protocol assistance on three occasions as mentioned in the table above for the 
development of Oxbryta for the treatment of haemolytic anaemia due to sickle cell disease (SCD) in adults 
and paediatric patients 12 years of age and older as monotherapy or in combination with hydroxycarbamide. 
The protocol assistance pertained to the following quality and clinical aspects: 
Quality: 
•  API starting materials for the commercial manufacturing of drug substance.   
• 
• 
Proposed control strategy for the potentially mutagenic impurities assessed in the manufacturing 
process. 
Proposed stability plan and dissolution method to support the shelf life of one of the strengths 
intended for commercial use. 
Clinical: 
•  Design of the Phase 3 study GBT440-031, specifically the appropriateness of the study population, 
sample size, study duration and the primary and key secondary endpoints to support a MAA in adults 
and adolescents. 
•  Acceptability of the proposed single Phase 3 study GBT440-031 together with supportive evidence 
from the Phase 1/2 programme including studies GBT440-001/GBT440-024 and GBT440-007 to 
support a MAA in adults and adolescents. 
• 
Paediatric development. 
Assessment report

•  Acceptability of the safety database for the initial MAA.  
•  Agreement that haemoglobin polymerisation leading to haemolytic anaemia is a key pathophysiologic 
hallmark of sickle cell disease and driver of progressive end-organ damage, morbidity and mortality. 
•  Agreement that an increase in haemoglobin and decrease in haemolysis, if maintained over long-
term, is a suitable endpoint to demonstrate clinical benefit of voxelotor in patients with SCD. 
•  Discussion concerning the overall development programme and whether it provides a sufficient basis 
to evaluate the benefit-risk profile of voxelotor for the treatment of SCD in adults and paediatric 
patients 12 to 17 years of age.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The applicant initially proposed the following indication: 
Treatment of haemolytic anaemia in adults and paediatric patients 12 years of age and older with sickle cell 
disease (SCD). Oxbryta can be administered alone or in combination with hydroxycarbamide. 
The applicant subsequently adjusted the initial wording of the indication as requested by the Rapporteurs, in 
order to be more specific on the origin of haemolytic anaemia; the approved indication is:  
“Oxbryta is indicated for the treatment of haemolytic anaemia due to sickle cell disease (SCD) in adults and 
paediatric patients 12 years of age and older as monotherapy or in combination with hydroxycarbamide.” 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an orphan disease in the European Union (EU) which affected 2.6 in 10,000 people 
in  the  EU  in  2017  (EHA,  2019).  SCD  is  the  most  prevalent  genetic  disease  in  France  and  the  UK,  and  its 
frequency  is  steadily  rising  in  many  other  countries  of  Central  and  Southern  Europe  (Colombatti,  2016; 
Thalassaemia International Federation, 2013). Approximately 50% of individuals afflicted with SCD are younger 
than 18 years of age (based on United States [US] epidemiological data), with clinical manifestations occurring 
across all paediatric age groups including in children < 1 year of age (Brousseau, 2010; Ansa, 2012). 
Importantly, the prevalence of SCD in Europe is rising due to migration to Europe from countries with high 
SCD prevalence (Angastiniotis, 2013; Colombatti, 2016; EHA, 2019). For example, approximately 4.8% of 
immigrants in France are from at risk populations (Thalassaemia International Federation, 2013), and the 
number of migrants and migrant newborns with HbSS (sickle Hb with two sickle Hb genes) in Germany 
increased by 60% between 2007 and 2015 (Kunz, 2017). 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of autosomal recessive inherited disorders caused by mutations in HBB, 
which  encodes  haemoglobin  subunit  β,  resulting  in  the  presence  of  a  mutated  form  of  haemoglobin, 
haemoglobin S (HbS). The most common form of SCD found is homozygous HbS disease (HbSS). In SCD, a 
single amino acid substitution in the β-globin chain leads to polymerisation of mutant haemoglobin S (HbS), 
impairing erythrocyte  rheology  and  decreasing  RBC  survival  to  about 10-20 days.  Erythrocytes  that  contain 
mostly  haemoglobin  polymers  assume  a  sickled  form  and  are  prone  to  haemolysis.  These  erythrocyte 
abnormalities in SCD manifest in haemolytic anaemia.  
The polymerisation of deoxy HbS is the primary and indispensable event in the molecular pathogenesis of sickle 
cell disease. However, polymerisation, although the primary pathophysiologic event, alone does not account 
for  all  of  the  pathophysiology  of  sickle  cell  disease.  Downstream  events  following  polymerisation,  including 
changes in red cell membrane structure and function, disordered red cell volume control, increased red cell

adherence  to  vascular  endothelium,  misregulation  of  vasoactivity,  and  inflammation  contribute  to  vaso-
occlusive crises (VOC) and haemolysis that are the hallmarks of sickle cell disease (UpToDate 2021, Piel et al, 
NEJM 2017). 
VOCs occur due to adhesive events among red blood cells and other cell types, obstructing the vasculature 
that accompanies with episodes of pain. Triggers for VOC vary and can include inflammation, stress, increased 
viscosity, decreased flow, haemolysis, or a combination of factors.  
With haemolysis, i.e. intravascular destruction of sickle erythrocytes, the products of haemolysis (cell-free 
haemoglobin, arginase 1, asymmetric dimethylarginine, and adenine nucleotides) are released which damage 
the vascular system. This is associated with an increased risk of developing specific clinical complications of 
pulmonary and systemic vasculopathy, including pulmonary hypertension, leg ulcers, priapism, chronic kidney 
disease and large-artery ischemic stroke (Kato et al, 2012). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
SCD causes significant morbidity and mortality. Morbidity, frequency of crisis, degree of anaemia and the organ 
systems  involved  vary  considerably  from  individual  to  individual.  Screening  for  HbS  at  birth  is  currently 
mandatory. For the first 6 months of life, infants are protected largely by elevated levels of Hb F. SCD usually 
manifests early in childhood, in the following ways: 
Signs and symptoms 
•  VOC: Approximately half the individuals with homozygous HbS disease experience VOC. The frequency of 
crises is highly variable. Some individuals have as many as 6 or more episodes annually, whereas others 
may have episodes only at great intervals or none at all. Each individual typically has a consistent pattern 
for crisis frequency. 
•  Acute and chronic pain: Pain episodes are the most distinguishing clinical feature of SCD and are typically 
associated with VOC. Also, chronic pain can develop as sequalae of vaso-occlusive events.  
•  Anaemia: Universally present, chronic and haemolytic in nature. 
•  Acute chest syndrome: Young children present with chest pain, fever, cough, tachypnea, leukocytosis, and 
pulmonary infiltrates in the upper lobes; adults are usually afebrile, dyspneic with severe chest pain, with 
multilobar/lower lobe disease. 
• 
Pulmonary hypertension: Increasingly recognised as a serious complication of SCD. 
•  Splenic sequestration: Characterised by the onset of life-threatening anaemia with rapid enlargement of 
the spleen and high reticulocyte count. 
• 
Infection: Organisms that pose the greatest danger include encapsulated respiratory bacteria, particularly 
Streptococcus pneumoniae; adult infections are predominantly with gram-negative organisms, especially 
Salmonella. 
•  Central nervous system (CNS) involvement: Most severe manifestation is stroke. 
•  Hand-foot syndrome: This is a dactylitis presenting as bilateral painful and swollen hands and/or feet in 
children. 
Assessment report  
EMA/102184/2022 
Page 12/161 
 
 
 
 
•  Genitourinary involvement: Kidneys lose concentrating capacity; priapism is a well-recognised complication 
of SCD 
•  Dermatologic involvement: Leg ulcers are a chronic painful problem 
Further,  manifestations  such  as  aplastic  crisis,  growth  retardation,  delayed  sexual  maturation,  bone  pain, 
avascular  necrosis  of  the  femoral  or  humeral  head,  ophthalmologic  involvement,  cardiac  involvement, 
gastrointestinal involvement may occur.   
(Medscape, UpToDate, Nature: https://www.nature.com/articles/nrdp201810). 
2.1.5.  Management 
Available therapies in SCD 
There  are  multiple  components  to  the  management  of  SCD,  including  the  prevention  and  treatment  of  the 
complications of SCD, as well as the potential cure for this illness. 
The  only  curative  treatment  currently  available  for  SCD  is  bone  marrow  transplantation.  This  treatment  is 
primarily  limited  to  children  and  adolescents,  with  use  of  a  matched  sibling  donor  and  a  myeloablative 
conditioning regimen. 
Therapies to prevent VOC and associated pain episodes in SCD: 
Hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea [HU]) (Siklos, 2017; Xromi, 2019) and Adakveo (crizanlizumab) (Adakveo, 
2020) are approved therapies in Europe for patients with SCD.  
•  Hydroxycarbamide  reduces  DNA  synthesis,  which  shifts  the  haematopoiesis  from  HbS  to  HbF 
production. The HbF suppresses polymerisation of HbS. 
o  Siklos  {HU)  is  indicated  for  the  prevention  of  recurrent  painful  vaso-occlusive  crises  (VOCs) 
including ACS in adults, adolescents and children older than 2 years suffering from symptomatic 
Sickle Cell Syndrome (Siklos, 2017) 
o  Xromi (HU) is indicated for the prevention of VOC complications of SCD in patients over 2 years of 
age (Xromi, 2019).  
•  Adakveo  (crizanlizumab),  a  monoclonal  antibody  directed  against  P  selectin,  which  was  granted 
conditional marketing authorisation in October 2020 for the prevention of recurrent VOCs, or pain crisis, 
in patients with SCD aged 16 years and older (Adakveo, 2020). 
Therapy to treat haemolytic anaemia in SCD 
There  is  currently  no  EU  approved  therapy  for  the  treatment  of  haemolytic  anaemia  associated  with  SCD, 
though transfusions are applied. 
• 
Transfusions  
o  Regularly  scheduled  blood  transfusion  therapy  (also  called  chronic,  prophylactic  or  preventive 
transfusion) involves periodic transfusion of the patient at regularly scheduled intervals, with the 
frequency guided by the patient's symptoms, haemoglobin (Hgb), and percent sickle Hgb (HgbS). 
This  strategy  could  be  effective  in  reducing  morbidity  of  most  complications  of  SCD.  Regular 
Assessment report

transfusions are used in the secondary prevention of stroke, acute chest syndrome (ACS), painful 
events,  priapism  and  pulmonary  hypertension.  Potential  benefit  of  transfusion  therapy  must  be 
weighed  against  potential  risks,  including  transfusion  reactions,  blood-borne  viral  infection,  iron 
overload and alloimmunisation. 
o  Prophylactic  transfusion  is  used  to  reduce  perioperative  complications  in  patients  with  SCD 
undergoing surgery and to reduce the incidence of a range of vaso-occlusive complications of SCD. 
• 
Erythropoietin is used off-label in patients with SCD primarily in the setting of chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
(Epogen, 2018; NHLBI, 2014). However, the clinical efficacy has not been established. 
Unmet medical need 
There is an unmet medical need in SCD for new targeted, mechanism based, preventive and potentially disease 
modifying therapies. These includes therapies to address haemolytic anaemia in SCD. To date, no drugs have 
been approved that specifically and directly target HbS polymerisation, the underlying mechanism of SCD.  
The unmet medical need, extent of the disease burden as well as limitations of the available treatment options 
are also supported by the Pilot “CHMP early contact with patient organisations” that is described below. 
Pilot “CHMP early contact with patient organisations”  
Feedback was collected from the network of sickle cell disease organisations who surveyed their members, as 
well as through direct interviews by Eurordis. Among others, feedback was received from the French patient 
organisation  SOS-Globi,  the  Dutch  patient  organisation  “Oscar  Nederland”,  Thalassemia  International 
Federation that includes patient groups representing SCD. In total 46 patients responded to the survey and 
one additional patient provided his view outside the survey.  
The  results  of  the  survey  summarised  below  should  however  be  interpreted with  caution  due  to the  limited 
sample  size  and  limited  number  of  treatment  centres  and  countries  participating.  In  addition,  respondents 
included a significant number of patients who were more severely affected than the population investigated in 
the  Oxbryta  pivotal  trial,  judging  by  the  annual  rate  of  VOC  and  number  of  patients  who  received  RBC 
transfusions in the pivotal study. 
Results 
Disease experience 
Fatigue caused by chronic anaemia and pain are noted as main symptoms reported. Patients describe pain as 
chronic and not localised, but everywhere from the back to their legs, arms, and can be very severe. Painkillers 
typically have no or little effect (paracetamol, tramadol, nefopam, caffeine, morphine derivatives, non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs).  
Impact on daily life 
The impact of the disease on patient’s life can be considerable, the patient/family might even decide to relocate 
near to a care centre. Focus on the onset of a crisis prevails. The lives of patients and their relatives are subject 
to  many  restrictions:  the  impossibility  of  practicing  many  physical  activities  (skiing,  swimming  or  other), 
difficulties to go on vacation, limitation of social life. The patient must adapt his professional life according to 
the fatigue.

Treatments  
Based on the Dutch survey (17 patients), most of the SCD patients use medications daily. Most commonly used 
medications  are  medicines  for  pain,  to  reduce  crises  frequency  (hydroxycarbamide),  to  reduce  anaemia,  to 
treat or prevent infections. When anaemia is severe, hydroxycarbamide is used. However, adverse reactions, 
such as severe headache is the limiting factor for hydroxycarbamide use. In general, there is limited choice in 
treatment  options,  and  substantial  part  of  the  patient  population  are  not  satisfied  with  their  treatment  and 
consider the beneficial effects to be of limited size and/or duration. Currently the ultimate treatment is bone 
marrow transplant. The main limiting factor is the availability of a donor. 
Of note, Adakveo (crizanlizumab) was not mentioned in the discussions, probably as very recently authorised 
(October 2020).  
Treatment  of  complications  consists  of  folate,  anticoagulant  treatment,  hydroxycarbamide,  painkillers,  and 
erythrocytapheresis.  
Patients expectations from a new treatment (ranked) 
- 
-

a treatment that reduces the frequency of crisis; 
a treatment which would increase timing between erythrocytapheresis treatments; 
a treatment which would reduce pain; 
a treatment which reduces the risk of infections; 
a treatment which does not expose to pain as a side-effect (headaches). 
2.2.  About the product 
Mode of action 
Sickle  cell  disease  (SCD)  is  a  group  of  inherited  disorders  caused  by  mutations  in  HBB,  which  encodes 
haemoglobin subunit β, resulting in the presence of a mutated form of haemoglobin, haemoglobin S (HbS). 
The primary cause of sickle cell anaemia is that HbS, when deoxygenated in the venous capillaries of peripheral 
tissue, has the capacity to polymerise. HbS polymers injure the sickle erythrocyte, leading to increased density, 
reduced  deformability,  increased  adhesivity,  and  a  shortened  Red  Blood  Cell  (RBC)  life  span,  leading  to 
haemolytic  anaemia.  Due  to  the  chronic  anaemia,  O2-carrying  capacity  is  decreased,  which  limits  the  total 
amount  of  O2  that  can  be  carried  to  tissues  (Kato,  2018).  In  addition,  Hb-O2  affinity  is  decreased  due  to 
increased 2,3-DPG concentrations in sickle RBCs.  In patients with SCD, O2 extraction (ie, tissue extraction of 
Hb-bound  O2)  is  preserved  but  limited  by  reduced  O2  content  and  impaired  O2  delivery.  With  increased 
metabolic demand (ie, stress situations or exercise), O2 delivery may therefore be insufficient.   
Voxelotor  (GBT440)  is  an  orally  bioavailable  small  molecule  which  acts  as  HbS  polymerisation  inhibitor. 
Voxelotor  inhibits  the  process  of  polymerisation  by  allosterically  stabilising  the  oxygenated  state  of  HbS  by 
means of increasing the Hb-oxygen (Hb-O2) affinity. This stabilisation increases the ratio of oxygenated HbS 
Assessment report  
EMA/102184/2022 
Page 15/161 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to  deoxygenated  HbS.  This  would  provide  a  sufficiently  prolonged  delay  time  for  RBCs  to  pass  through  the 
hypoxic  environment  of  distal  capillaries  and  arterioles  without  sickling  prior  to  reoxygenation  in  the  lungs 
(Oksenberg, 2016).  
Voxelotor is claimed to bind covalently and reversibly via a Schiff-base to the N-terminal valine of one of the 
α-chains of Hb (Metcalf, 2017). It is claimed a dose-dependent pharmacodynamic effect of increasing affinity 
of Hb for oxygen (Hb-O2 affinity). By this, it expects to prevent RBC sickling, haemolysis and the resulting end-
organ damage and morbidity. 
The agreed indication is as follows: 
“Oxbryta is indicated for the treatment of haemolytic anaemia due to sickle cell disease (SCD) in adults and 
paediatric patients 12 years of age and older as monotherapy or in combination with hydroxycarbamide.” 
The recommended dosage of voxelotor is 1500 mg taken orally once daily (QD) with or without food. 
For patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C), the recommended dosage of voxelotor is 1000 mg 
taken QD with or without food. No dosage adjustment of voxelotor is required for patients with mild or moderate 
hepatic impairment. 
Paediatric population 
The recommended dosage of Oxbryta in patients 12 to < 18 years of age is the same as for adults; 1500 mg 
dose (three 500 mg film-coated tablets) taken orally once daily with or without food. 
The safety and efficacy of Oxbryta in paediatric patients below the age of 12 years have not been established 
yet. 
2.3.  Type of application and aspects on development 
The applicant submitted a request for an accelerated assessment. Upon examination of the request the CHMP 
concluded  that  the  unmet  medical  need  in  patients  with  haemolytic  anaemia  associated  with  SCD  is 
acknowledged, the innovative character of the mechanism of action is recognised and the provided evidence 
indicate that the drug has an effect on anaemia and haemolysis markers. However, provided data do not allow 
to assess to what extent the pivotal trial population represents the population with high unmet medical need. 
This precludes the assessment of the potential of the product to address the major public health interest and 
to provide major therapeutic innovation. Therefore the CHMP did not agree to the request for an accelerated 
assessment, as it was considered not sufficiently substantiated 
2.4.  Quality aspects

The product is available in high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle with a polypropylene child-resistant cap 
and an aluminium induction seal. The bottle also contains a silica gel desiccant canister and polyester coil. as 
described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.4.2.  Active Substance 
2.4.2.1.  General information 
The chemical name of voxelotor is 2-hydroxy-6-((2-(1-isopropyl-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)pyridin-3-yl) 
methoxy)benzaldehyde corresponding to the molecular formula C19H19N3O3. It has a molecular weight of 
337.4 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1 Active substance structure 
The chemical structure of voxelotor was elucidated by a combination of mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy and ultraviolet spectroscopy The solid state properties of the 
active substance were measured by single crystal X-ray crystallography. Voxelotor has a non - chiral molecular 
structure. 
The  active  substance  is  a  white  to  yellow  to  beige  non-hygroscopic  solid.  Based  on  the  Biopharmaceutics 
Classification System (BCS), voxelotor is classified as a Class 2 compound. Voxelotor has low aqueous solubility 
and high permeability as demonstrated in an in vitro study. Since voxelotor aqueous solubility is not high in 
most ingested conditions, a conventional-release tablet was formulated consistent with rapid disintegration for 
maximal absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. 
Polymorphism  has  been  observed  for  voxelotor.  Form  II  has  been  selected  for 
clinical  and  commercial  use  and  has  been  consistently  produced  by  the 
manufacturing  process.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  there  is  no  polymorph 
conversion during the finished product manufacturing. 
2.4.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Voxelotor  is  synthesised  in  six  main  steps  via  a  convergent  route  using  well defined  starting  materials  with 
acceptable specifications.  
A  comprehensive  overview  of  all  development  activities  regarding  the  manufacturing  process,  the  various 
control  strategies  (organic  impurities,  potentially  mutagenic  impurities,  nitrosamine  impurities,  elemental 
impurities, inorganic impurities, residual solvents / organic volatile impurities, polymorphic form, particle size, 
Assessment report

selection  and  justification  of  the  starting  materials,  risk  assessment  and  determination  of  critical  process 
parameters,  has  been  provided  and  found  acceptable.  Adequate  in-process  controls  are  applied  during  the 
synthesis. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents 
have been presented. Based on provided studies, proven acceptable ranges have been defined. The available 
development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from commercial scale batches fully 
support the proposed PARs. 
The  characterisation  of  the  active  substance  and  its  impurities  are  in  accordance  with  the  EU  guideline  on 
chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
2.4.2.3.  Specification 
The  active  substance  specification  includes  tests  for:  appearance,  identification  (IR,  HPLC),  polymorph 
identification  (XRPD),  assay  (HPLC),  impurities  (HPLC),  residual  solvents  (GC),  palladium  content  (ICP-MS), 
water content (KF), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.) and particle size (laser diffraction). 
Consistent with the ICH M7(R1), an assessment of potential mutagenicity for actual and potential impurities 
that may be present in voxelotor arising from the manufacture and storage of the active substance has been 
performed.  The  assessment  has  identified  PMIs.  The  control  strategies  for  all  PMIs  has  been  presented  and 
found acceptable. 
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  non-compendial  methods  appropriately 
validated  in  accordance  with  the  ICH  guidelines.  Satisfactory  information  regarding  the  reference  standards 
used for assay and impurity testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on nine commercial scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
2.4.2.4.  Stability 
Stability  data  on  three  pilot  scale  batches  of  active  substance  from  the  proposed  manufacturer  stored  in  a 
container closure system representative of that intended for the market for up to 36 months under long term 
conditions (25ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according 
to the ICH guidelines were provided. Up to 24 months stability data are available for six supportive stability 
batches of the active substance. Supportive stability batches were manufactured at pilot and production scale 
by the second proposed manufacturer using the same proposed commercial process. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance, polymorph identification, assay, impurities, water content 
and  microbial  limits.  The  analytical  methods  used  were  the  same  as  for  release  with  the  exception  for  the 
impurity reporting. The methods were stability indicating. 
All tested parameters were within the specifications on both storage conditions. No trends are apparent under 
either long-term or accelerated storage conditions. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. 
The photostability and forced degradation studies demonstrate that the voxelotor is insensitive to acid, base, 
temperature, or light. 
Assessment report

The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months with no special storage conditions 
in the proposed container. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Voxelotor tablet, 500 mg, is a light yellow to yellow, oval-shaped, biconvex, film-coated tablet of approximately 
18  mm  ×  10  mm,  with  “GBT  500”  debossed  on  one  side.  The  finished  product  tablet  is  developed  as  an 
immediate-release oral solid dosage form. 
Pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements. 
Active substance particle size and polymorphic form are the properties extensively evaluated as they may affect 
the performance of the finished product. The particle size of the active substance can potentially impact the 
dissolution of finished product. To minimize the particle size impact on the tablet dissolution profile, the particle 
size distribution control for the active substance was established and controlled via the specifications. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. 
Each component in the film-coating system conforms to the Ph. Eur., USP-NF compendial standards, and is 
accepted  by  E  number–Purity  Criteria  according  to  Commission  Regulation  (EU)  No.  231/2012  for  Food 
Additives.  There  are  no  novel  excipients  used  in  the  finished  product  formulation.  The  list  of  excipients  is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. The chemical compatibility of the 
active  substance  with  the  formulation  excipients  under  accelerated  storage  condition  (40  °C/75%  RH)  was 
evaluated.  The  study  results  demonstrated  that  all  selected  excipients  were  compatible  with  the  active 
substance. 
The finished product was initially developed in two solid oral dosage forms: capsules and tablets. The capsule 
dosage forms, including powder in capsule (PIC) and common blend (CB) capsule, were initially developed and 
used in early clinical studies. 
The tablet dosage form was developed to improve the manufacturing process and to support potentially higher 
clinical  doses.  A  tablet  dosage  strength  of  300  mg  was  first  developed  to  support  clinical  studies.  Oxbryta 
tablet, 500 mg, was later developed as the proposed commercial finished product.  
Based on the desired daily dose of 1500 mg and the suitable tablet size, voxelotor tablet, 500 mg, was selected 
as the proposed commercial dosage form. The common blend approach enables the use of the same formulation 
compositions for the 500 mg dosage strength. 
Based on total tablet weight it is assumed that size is rather large. Three such tablets should be taken once a 
daily.  The  applicant  provided  additional  details  and  compares  for  the  two  patient  population  groups  other 
existing products in the market having comparable large tablet sizes. 
Elderly patients: The applicant compared the product to five other registered products (4x film-coated tablet, 
1x extended release tablet), four of them with a larger length and one with an almost similar length, and two 
of them with a larger width. Based on the comparison with the five other registered products (four of them via 
EU centralised procedure), it has been assumed that for the comparably sized proposed tablet the problem of 
Assessment report  
EMA/102184/2022

swallowing  for  elderly  patients  is  not  to  be  expected.  In  addition,  the  proposed  oval  shape  is  assumed  to 
improve swallowability of the Oxbryta tablet. 
Paediatric patients (adolescents 12 - <18 years old): A metformin 1000 mg tablet of 9.8 x 19.0 mm, meant 
for children of 10 years above and registered in the UK, slightly larger than the proposed Oxbryta tablet, is the 
most relevant example of a comparably-sized proposed tablet product. Another EU registered product, Sovaldi 
film-coated tablet, possesses a larger length (20 mm) but a smaller width (9 mm). Based on the comparison 
with  other  registered  products  (three  of  them  via  centralised  procedure),  it  has  been  assumed  that  for  the 
comparably sized proposed Oxbryta tablet, the problem of swallowing for adolescents of 12- <18 years old is 
not to be expected. In addition, this assumption is supported by a literature reference, which suggests that the 
majority of adolescent patients are capable of swallowing a 22 mm long capsule. 
The  manufacturing  development  have  been  evaluated  through  the  use  of  risk  assessment  and  design  of 
experiments to identify the critical process parameters. A risk analysis was performed using the failure mode 
effect analysis (FMEA) method in order to define critical process steps and process parameters that may have 
an influence on the finished product quality attributes. The risk identification was based on the prior knowledge 
of  products  with  similar  formulations  and  manufacturing  processes  as  well  as  on  the  experience  from 
formulation  development,  process  design  and  scale-up  studies.  The  critical  process  parameters  have  been 
adequately identified. 
The  commercial  manufacturing  process  involves  standard  and  conventional  pharmaceutical  operations, 
including  pre-blending,  dry  granulation,  final  blending,  tablet  compression,  film-coating,  and  packaging.  A 
tablet dosage strength of 300 mg was first developed to support the clinical studies. Voxelotor tablet, 500 mg, 
was later developed as the proposed commercial finished product presentation.   
The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated. 
The primary packaging is high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle with a polypropylene child-resistant cap and 
an  aluminium  induction  seal.  The  material  complies  with  Ph.Eur.  and  EC  requirements.  The  choice  of  the 
container  closure  system  has  been  validated  by  stability  data  and  is  adequate  for  the  intended  use  of  the 
product. 
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  six  main  steps:  pre-blending,  dry  granulation,  final  blending,  tablet 
compression, film-coating, and packaging. 
Adequate  IPCs  for  compression  and  for  film-coating  are  applied.  CPPs  are  applied  for  roller  compaction, 
compression, and film-coating are controlled, ensuring that the quality of the product is maintained. 
As the process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process, major steps of the manufacturing process 
will be validated in line with provided validation protocol, which was found acceptable. 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: appearance, 
identification  (UV,  HPLC),  assay  (HPLC),  uniformity  of  dosage  units(HPLC),  degradation  products  (HPLC), 
dissolution (Ph. Eur., HPLC), water content (Ph. Eur., KF) and microbial purity (Ph. Eur.).

The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a risk-based 
approach  in  line  with  the  ICH  Q3D  Guideline  for  Elemental  Impurities.  The  information  on  the  control  of 
elemental impurities is satisfactory.  
During the procedure a major objection (MO) was raised on the absence of a risk assessment concerning the 
potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product. In response, a risk assessment has been 
performed  considering  all  suspected  and  actual  root  causes  in  line  with  the  “Questions  and  answers  for 
marketing  authorisation  holders/applicants  on  the  CHMP  Opinion  for  the  Article  5(3)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No 
726/2004  referral  on  nitrosamine  impurities  in  human  medicinal  products”  (EMA/409815/2020)  and  the 
“Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in 
human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the information provided, it is accepted that there 
is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no specific 
control measures are deemed necessary. 
In accordance with ICH Q3C guideline, the residual solvents are adequately controlled in the active substance 
and  excipients.  No  solvents  are  involved  in  the  manufacture  of  finished  product.  The  daily  exposure  to  the 
residual  solvents  through  the  finished  product  is  within  the  permitted  limits  and  no  routine  monitoring  of 
residual solvents in the finished product is proposed and accepted. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities 
testing has been presented. 
Batch  analysis  data  are  provided  on  18  commercial  scale  batches,  confirming  the  consistency  of  the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  The methods and 
specification  in  place  at  the  time  of  release  for  the  respective  products  were  appropriate  for  the  stage  of 
development and the intended use of the product. 
The  finished  product is  released  on  the  market based  on the  release  specifications, through  traditional  final 
product release testing. 
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
Different dosage strengths of the finished product were developed to support clinical and stability studies (300 
and 900 mg) and commercialisation (500 mg). Limited batch history and stability data are available for the 
500  mg tablet  strength.  To  support the  shelf  life  for  the  500  mg  commercial dosage  strength,  a  bracketing 
strategy  was  utilised  in  the  primary  stability  studies  that  are  based  on  ICH  Q1D.  The  design  factors  in  the 
bracketing strategy include dosage strength, container closure material of construct and size, and fill. Three 
primary stability lots of each finished product configuration, were fully tested for stability in accordance with 
the test frequency recommended by ICH Q1A. 
Stability data on 3 common blend batches for the 300 mg tablet each manufactured at commercial scale of the 
finished product stored for up to 12 months under long term conditions (25ºC / 60% RH), for up to 24 under 
intermediate  /  long  term  conditions  (30ºC  /  75%  RH)  and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated  conditions 
(40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Further data on 3 supportive batches of 500 
mg tablets have been provided. The container closure system used for the stability samples are of the same 
packaging material used for the proposed commercial finished product with the exception of size as defined in 
the bracketing strategy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/102184/2022 
Page 21/161 
 
 
 
Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  assay,  degradation  products,  dissolution,  water  content  and  microbial 
limits. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
No significant changes and no apparent trends were observed under any of the storage conditions. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New 
Drug  Substances  and  Products.  The  photostability  and  forced  degradation  studies  demonstrated  that  the 
finished product is insensitive to acid, base, temperature, or light. 
Considering the amount of stability data available, further data on in use stability were not requested. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 3 years with no special storage conditions as stated 
in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
2.4.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. During the procedure a major objection (MO) was raised on the absence 
of a risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product. The 
risk assessment has been performed as requested and, based on the information provided, it is accepted that 
there is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no 
specific control measures are deemed necessary. 
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics,

2.5.1.  Introduction 
Voxelotor is a compound that is designed to bind the oxygen loaded haemoglobin (Hb) and stabilises this form. 
This is an important feature as oxygen loaded sickled Hb (HbS) is less prone to result in vaso-occlusive crises 
and the consequences of it. Haemoglobulin is a hetero-tetramer of 2 α-globulins and 2 β-globulins. Although 
sickle cell patients harbour a mutation in the β-globulin, which apparently influences the affinity for oxygen, 
voxelotor appears to bind to the α-globulin.  
As support for the treatment of haemolytic anaemia by voxelotor in sickle cell patient from 12 years and older 
the  applicant  submitted  an  extensive  number  of  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  pharmacology  studies,  which  will  be 
summarised below.

Voxelotor binds to the N-terminal valine residue of an alpha chain; a single voxelotor molecule binding per 
HbS tetramer in a 1:1 stoichiometry.  
The voxelotor binding site is distant from the heme pockets => does not sterically prevent dissociation of 
O2 from HbS.

•  Hb purified from SS blood (SS blood from transfused sickle cells donor): 30% HbS / 70%HbA and whole 
blood: 70/90% HbS. 
•  Voxelotor dose dependently decreases the p50 in purified Hb and whole blood from subjects with SCD. 
•  Because the N-terminal valine of the α chain of Hb is conserved across all mammals, voxelotor elicits an 
increase in Hb-O2 affinity in all blood samples as evidenced by the reduction in p50 values. 
•  Table  3  shows  the  p50  values  for  control  and  voxelotor-treated  blood  from  healthy  subjects  (HbAA), 
subjects with SCD (HbSS), and various animal species: voxelotor-modified Hb has a higher O2 affinity 
than unmodified Hb.

At different pH, voxelotor caused a left-shift of the OEC (indicating an increase in the Hb-O2 affinity) 
relative to control at each pH but the shift of the OEC is similar with or without Voxelotor at pH 6,8 and pH

Results and main findings 
2,3-DPG, the major allosteric effector for Hb, provides another physiologic mechanism to augment O2 
offloading from Hb but in presence of Voxelotor, the right shift of the OEC is observed.  
In this assay, inhibition of HbS polymerisation by voxelotor was assessed by its ability to increase the 
delay time (DT) prior to the onset of HbS polymers: At 25, 50, and 100 μM, voxelotor delayed 
polymerisation of deoxy-HbS (50 μM) with a ΔDT of 4.6, 8.8 and 13.1 minutes, respectively.

PK/PD model: In study PRC-18-043 the applicant used in vivo patient data as well as ex vivo data to find the best predictor for Hb-O2 affinity 
by means of PK/PD modelling. For the treatment, the applicant aims at a concentration voxelotor:Hb of 1:3. The maximal voxelotor bound Hb 
concentration in blood will is thus aimed at ~30 %. As this population has a higher affinity for O2 but also shows less efficient oxygen offloading 
or dissociation, the voxelotor-Hb population will be visible in lower left corner of an OEC. The p20 is regarded a relevant parameter to reflect 
the effect  of  voxelotor  treatment  on  O2  affinity  of  the  voxelotor-Hb  population.  This  parameter  is less  likely  to  be  contaminated with  a  Hb 
population not bound to voxelotor. The delta p20 is reflecting the change in p20 between control and sample. It is anticipated that control 
situation reflects untreated SS blood / SCD subjects and sample is reflecting voxelotor treated SS blood / SCD subjects. When considering both 
model development and model robustness, ∆p20 appears the best parameter to relate to voxelotor mediated change in Hb-O2 binding.

Results and main findings 
•  No decrease for mice with a low % Hb occupancy. 
•  Voxelotor-treated  mice  that  achieved  >  32%  Hb  occupancy  versus  the  vehicle-treated  SS  mice 
showed a decrease in % reticulocyte count 36 ± 11% (n = 4) vs 52 ± 2% (n = 10). 
In this study, occupancy was calculated as a molar ratio of the concentrations of voxelotor to Hb in blood as determined by the % Hct (obtained 
at Cmax (4 h post last oral dose), as MCHC data was not available. The applicant has provided additional information on the calculation of the 
Hb occupancy in the preclinical studies. The occupancy was calculated according to the equations (1) and (2) depicted below; however, instead 
of the estimated Hb concentration of 5000 µM included in the equation 2, the MCHC value, as estimated in the preclinical studies, was used. 
MCHC is a mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration, which represents the average concentration of haemoglobin inside a single red blood 
cell.  It  is  not  measured  directly  in  the  studies,  but  is  calculated  from  the  haemoglobin  concentration  in  the  whole  blood,  divided  by  the 
haematocrit  level,  which  in  turn  represents  the  volume  percentage  of  the  red  blood  cells  in  the  whole  blood.  Thus  the  Hb  occupancy  was 
calculated as a ratio between the voxelotor concentration in the red blood cells, calculated from equation 4, to the haemoglobin concentration 
within a single blood cell (MCHC) expressed in µM.  
The MCHC value was converted from g/dL, as reported in the studies, into µM by dividing it by the molecular weight of Hb (64458 g/mol). 
The average MCHC values of two sexes at a particular timepoint were used in the calculations.  
The concentration of voxelotor in the red blood cells was determined from equation 2:  
(1) 
(2) 
The results indicated that the increases in voxelotor blood exposure are accompanied by corresponding increases in % Hb occupancy (See 
section 2.5.4.2 Repeat doses toxicity).

2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Voxelotor (GBT440) was investigated in a range of in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) and toxicokinetic 
(TK) studies in the C57BL/6J mouse, Sprague Dawley (SD) rats, New Zealand White rabbits and Cynomolgus 
monkeys  (Macaca  fascicularis).  These  studies  were  conducted  to  define  the  absorption,  distribution, 
metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of voxelotor following oral (PO) and parenteral administration (IV). Data 
from  these  studies  were  used  to  characterise  the  PK  and  TK  properties  of  voxelotor  to  support  nonclinical 
toxicology evaluations and to support its intended clinical use. Voxelotor has a low water solubility (~51 µg/mL).  
Methods  of  analysis:  Liquid  chromatography  with  tandem  mass  spectrometry  (LC-MS/MS)  methods  were 
employed to analyse blood and plasma samples from both GLP and non-GLP nonclinical studies in rat, mouse, 
rabbit, dog and monkey. In general, GBT440 and an internal standard, GBT1592 (GBT440-D7), were extracted 
using liquid-liquid extraction and analysed by a Sciex API 4000 LC-MS-MS equipped with an HPLC column. The 
analytical range (LLOQ – ULOQ) for blood samples was 200 to 200,000 ng/mL, for plasma samples was 10 to 
10,000 ng/mL and for rat milk was 10.0 to 10,000 ng/mL. For non-GLP, 50 to 100,000 ng/mL and 10 to 20,000 
ng/mL for blood and plasma, respectively. The methods met all validation criteria with respect to accuracy, 
precision,  sensitivity,  linearity,  reproducibility,  and  matrix  stability.  Incurred  sample  reproducibility  for 
nonclinical sample analysis was conducted once per method per species.

Abbreviations: AUC, area under the concentration-time curve; AUC0-∞, AUC from time 0 to infinity; CLs, system clearance; 
Cmax, maximum concentration; %CV, percent coefficient of variation; F, bioavailability; t1/2, half-life; Tmax, time to peak 
concentration; Vss, volume of distribution at steady state. 
Note: The blood: plasma ratio was calculated by comparing AUC of blood and plasma concentration-time profiles of 
voxelotor during the terminal phase (e.g., 24 to 144 hours) to ensure equilibrium between the 2 matrices was reached. 
Absorption 
In an in-vitro study, voxelotor showed a high permeability when using a polarised monolayer of Madin-Darby 
Canine Kidney (MDCK)-MDR1 cells or Caco-2 cells. The influence of the gut and the liver (first-pass effect) on 
the oral absorption process of voxelotor was studied in the rat by measuring the portal and femoral vein blood 
levels. The fraction of voxelotor that escaped the gut and liver were 0.64 and 0.74, respectively, suggesting 
that oral bioavailability was moderately restricted by gut absorption or by liver first-pass metabolism. 
In  fasted  male  Sprague  Dawley  rats,  the  single  dose  PK  of  voxelotor  was  studied  following  IV  dosing  at 
1.6 mg/kg  and  oral  gavage  dosing  at  7.2 mg/kg  voxelotor  hydrochloride  (n = 4).  Following  IV  and  oral 
administration  in  rats,  the  plasma  concentrations  of  voxelotor  declined  in  a  bidirectional  fashion  but  blood 
concentration increased or was constant for hours before declining. Distribution volume (Vss) was low for blood 
(0.05 L/kg), indicating mainly distribution to blood volume, and high in plasma (2.8 L/kg), i.e. 4-fold more than 
body water. Clearance was low for blood and plasma (0.031 and 1.80 mL/min/kg). Terminal elimination half-
life  (t1/2)  values  in  blood  and  plasma  were  similar  (19.1  and  21.8 hrs,  respectively).  Following  oral 
administration, absorption was fast in plasma (Tmax 1.25 hrs) and moderate in blood (5 hrs). Exposure, based 
on AUC, in blood was ~70-fold higher than in plasma but oral bioavailability was similar for blood and plasma 
when using a solution formulation (~60%) or suspension (~46%). 
Dose linearity of pharmacokinetics was evaluated in the rat. Upon oral dosing of voxelotor (HCl-salt), blood 
exposure  (Cmax,  AUC0–∞)  increased  about  10-fold  less  than  dose-proportional  over  the  dose  range  of  10 to 
1000 mg/kg. No differences were found in exposure, when using the free base, hydrochloride salt, or sulphate 
salt (100 - 1000 mg/kg) in the 0.5% methylcellulose plus 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) formulation or 
when  using  the  voxelotor  free  base  polymorphic  Form II  or  Form N.  API  particle  size  did  also  not  influence 
absorption as the free base form II, milled versus non-milled, gave similar exposure. A food effect study showed 
only a modest decline (30%) in bioavailability in the fed rat (10 mg/kg). 
In fasted male and female Beagle dogs, the single dose PK was studied following IV dosing at 1.0 mg/kg and 
oral gavage dosing at 2.5 mg/kg voxelotor hydrochloride (n = 4/sex). Following IV and oral administration in 
dogs, the plasma concentration of voxelotor declined in a bidirectional fashion but blood concentration increased 
or was constant during the first 8 hrs before slowly declining. Distribution volume (Vss) was low for blood (Vss 
0.17 L/kg), indicating slightly more than blood volume, and for plasma high (8.4 L/kg), i.e. 14-fold more than 
body water. Clearance was low for blood and plasma (0.031 and 1.29 mL/min/kg). Terminal elimination half-
life (t1/2) values in blood and plasma were very high (60 – 100 hrs but measured only up to 72 hrs). Following 
oral  administration,  absorption  was  fast  in  plasma  (Tmax  0.65  hrs)  and  moderate  in  blood  (Tmax  8  hrs). 
Exposure, based on AUC, in blood was 70 to 80-fold higher than in plasma. Oral bioavailability was similar for 
blood or plasma (32% - 42%).

In  male  Beagle  dog  (n=3),  orally  dosed  with  100  mg/kg  voxelotor,  no  differences  were  found  in  exposure, 
when using a capsule, filled with voxelotor Form II, milled drug substance, or a suspension (0.5% w/w Methocel 
E50 containing 0.01% w/w polysorbate 80 and 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7), nor was a food effect seen. 
The  latter  formulation  was  used  in  the  majority  of  the  nonclinical  studies  including  the  GLP  toxicology  and 
safety  pharmacology  studies.  Upon  oral  dosing  of  voxelotor  (free  base),  blood  exposure  (Cmax,  AUC0–∞) 
increased less than dose-proportional over the dose range of 50 to 1000 mg/kg. 
In  fasted  male  Cynomolgus  monkeys,  the  single  dose  PK  of  voxelotor  was  studied  following  IV  dosing  at 
1.0 mg/kg  and  oral  gavage  dosing  at  4.25 mg/kg  voxelotor  hydrochloride  (n = 3).  Following  IV  and  oral 
administration,  the  plasma  concentration  of  voxelotor  declined  in  a  multidirectional  fashion  but  blood 
concentration increased or was constant during the first 18 hrs before declining. Distribution volume (Vss) was 
low for blood (Vss 0.041 L/kg), indicating less than blood volume, and for plasma high (2.3 L/kg), i.e. ~4-fold 
more  than  body  water.  Clearance  was  low  for  blood  and  plasma  (0.016  and  0.94 mL/min/kg).  Terminal 
elimination half-life (t1/2) values in blood and plasma were similar (36 and 28 hrs). Following oral administration, 
absorption was moderate in plasma (Tmax 4.6 hrs) and slow in blood (Tmax 18 hrs). Exposure, based on AUC, 
in blood was ~70-fold higher than in plasma. Oral bioavailability was similar for blood or plasma (~35%). 
In fasted male C57BL/6J mice, the single dose PK of voxelotor was studied following IV dosing at 71 mg/kg 
and PO dosing at 30 mg/kg voxelotor hydrochloride (n = 3 mice/time point). The blood sampling times, up to 
24h, were too short to give an accurate value of the blood PK parameters, although it is clear that a similar PK 
profile as with the other studied species was found, i.e. that voxelotor resides more in blood than in plasma.  
Upon multiple dosing of voxelotor in rat, dog or monkey, both blood and plasma exposure increased less than 
dose-proportional. In the dog, the accumulation of voxelotor over time was less than expected based on its 
long elimination half-life and did not follow linear PK profile in that only a 1.2-fold increase in exposure was 
seen with a 5-fold increase in dose. In the monkey, plasma voxelotor exposure seemed to have reached steady-
state after eight days of dosing, while for voxelotor blood exposure this was not yet (52 – 74%) achieved. In 
the multiple dose safety studies in rat (4, 13 & 26 wk), dog (4 wk) and monkey (13 & 39 wk), the toxicokinetics 
(TK) of voxelotor was determined. The increase in exposure in blood was less than dose-proportional, while, 
generally, in plasma it was more dose-proportional. Accumulation over time was, dependent on the dose and 
duration of dosing, between 1.0 and 3.5. 
Distribution 
The in vivo tissue distribution of  14C-voxelotor (14C-GBT440) was investigated in the male albino SD rat and 
the partially-pigmented Long Evans rat after oral administration of 10 mg/kg (150 µCi/kg) using quantitative 
whole-body  autoradiography  (QWBA)  at  0.5  h  up  to  72  h  (SD)  and  up  to  672  h  (Long  Evans)  post  dosing. 
Tissue distribution in non-pigmented rats was comparable to that in the pigmented male rats. Following oral 
administration,  radioactivity  was  quickly  distributed  to  all  tissues  studied  but  mainly  confined  to  the  blood 
(RBCs) compartment. The highest 14C-related radioactivity was found at 4 – 8 hours post dose in bile, blood, 
lung, spleen (red pulp), liver, bone marrow, and kidney. Tissue to blood ratio (T/B) was generally found to be 
lower than 0.5 for all tissues during the first 24 hours post dose. At 336 hrs post single dose administration of 
14C-voxelotor, radioactivity was very low but still measurable in blood, liver, lung, eye uveal tract and kidney. 
Radioactivity was found to cross the blood brain barrier, but exposure was at least 30-fold lower than in the 
blood. As pigmented and non-pigmented skin were similarly labelled, it is concluded that there is no melanin 
binding. At 672 hrs post dose, no radioactivity was still measurable.

The  partitioning  of  voxelotor  into  plasma  and  blood  was  determined  after  single-dose  administration  of 
voxelotor  to  mouse,  rat,  dog  and  monkey.  The  blood  to  plasma  (B/P)  ratio,  based  on  exposure  (AUC)  was 
found to be about 70 (62 - 81), indicating a red blood cell (RBC) partitioning of >99%. In human, the B/P ratio, 
based  on  the  exposure  (AUC0-24)  upon  daily  oral  dosing  of  1500  mg  voxelotor,  corresponds  to  an  RBC 
partitioning of about 96%. 
Protein binding studies with voxelotor were performed in vitro with plasma (in the absence of Hb) from human, 
monkey, dog, rat, and mouse at 5 µM and 50 µM using an ultracentrifugation method. Plasma protein binding 
of voxelotor was 99.6% in dog or mouse plasma and 99.8% in human, monkey and rat plasma. Voxelotor had 
higher binding affinity to albumin than to alpha-1-acid glycoprotein.  
Developmental and reproductive toxicity studies were performed in SD rats and New Zealand White rabbits. In 
the rat pre- and postnatal development study, voxelotor was found to be excreted in the milk and exposure in 
milk  was  about  26%  –  41%  of  the  maternal  plasma  exposure.  On  lactation  day  10,  plasma  exposure  of 
voxelotor  was  found  in  the  pups,  which  amounted  to  ~3.6%  of  maternal  plasma  voxelotor  concentration, 
indicating that voxelotor is readily excreted in the milk leading, subsequently, to plasma exposure in the pups. 
Metabolism 
Metabolism of voxelotor was evaluated in both in vivo and in vitro studies. In vivo metabolism with metabolite 
identification  was  evaluated  in  rats  and  dogs,  providing information  on  possible  metabolic  pathways.  Blood, 
plasma, bile, faecal homogenates, and urine were pooled and profiled for metabolites of 14C-GBT440 (voxelotor, 
LoQ = 1%). Structures of the metabolites were identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-
MS and/or LC-MS/MS) and were verified against reference standards, when available. 
Following a single oral administration of 10 mg/kg  14C-voxelotor to male SD rats (n=3), radio-HPLC profiles 
showed  that  unchanged  voxelotor  was  the  major  source  of  circulating  radioactivity  in  blood  (99%)  and  in 
plasma (~80%). In rats 14C-voxelotor was metabolised by both phase I and phase II biotransformation. The 
largest of the five circulating radioactive metabolites in plasma were M24 (~8%) and M11 (~6%). It should be 
noted that the extraction recovery was low, ~50% for plasma and 63% for blood. In urine, containing about 
one  tenth  of  the  radioactive  dose,  unchanged  voxelotor  and  40  metabolites  were  found,  of  which  M23  was 
excreted as the largest radioactive component (~1% of the radioactive dose), while the others were <0.6%. 
In faeces, containing three quarters of the radioactive dose, most of the excreted radioactivity was associated 
with unchanged voxelotor (15%) and 20 metabolites, of which GBT1659 (3.4%), GBT1226 (3.4%), GBT921 
(1.5%)  and  M19  (1.2%)  were  each  above  1%  of  the  radioactive  dose.  In  bile,  obtained  from  bile  duct 
cannulated (BDC) rats (n=2), given a single intravenous administration of 2 mg/kg 14C-voxelotor, unchanged 
voxelotor (~7%) and 21 metabolites were found, of which the glucuronides M11 and M13C (both ~10%), M80 
and M84 (both ~7%) were each above 4% of the radioactive dose. 
Following  a  single  oral  administration  of  20  mg/kg  14C-voxelotor  to  male  Beagle  dogs  (n=3),  unchanged 
voxelotor  was  the  major  source  of  circulating  radioactivity  in  blood  (92-97%)  and  was  the  second  most 
abundant species in plasma (22-32%). In dogs, 14C-voxelotor was metabolised by both phase I and phase II 
biotransformation.  The  major  circulating  radioactive  components  in  plasma  were  M24  (34%),  unchanged 
voxelotor  (22-32%),  GBT1659/GBT921  (combined  12-15%)  and  M113C  (8%).  In  urine,  containing  about  a 
quarter  of  the  radioactive  dose,  unchanged  voxelotor  with  15  metabolites  were  found  and  GBT1659  was 
excreted in urine as the major radioactive component (~4.5% of the radioactive dose). In faeces, containing 
two third of the radioactive dose, most of the excreted radioactivity was associated with unchanged voxelotor

(15%)  and  14  metabolites,  of  which  GBT1659/GBT921  (~10%)  and  GBT1226  (1%)  were  above  1%  of  the 
radioactive dose.  
A  comparison  with  rats  and  dogs  was  made  of  metabolites  present  in  humans.  In  humans,  an  AME  study 
indicates that M218/1 (named as M24 in rat and dog) was a major circulating metabolite in plasma accounting 
for 16.8% of the total radioactivity in the 0 to 48-hour pooled plasma samples. M218/1, named as M24, was 
also  found  in  plasma  of  rats  and  dogs  as  8.1%  and  34%,  respectively,  of  total  radioactivity  upon  oral 
administration of 14C-voxelotor. M24 (M218/1) was identified as a phase II sulphate-conjugated metabolite of 
O-dealkylated voxelotor, and it is likely to be pharmacologically inactive as evidenced by the non-partitioning 
into the whole blood (RBCs). None of the Phase I metabolites represented more than 10% of total drug related 
exposure in human plasma or blood. All metabolites, except two trace human phase II metabolites, M419/1 
and M673/1 (< 1% of total radioactivity in human AME study), were detected in either rat or dog. Overall, the 
circulating plasma metabolite profiles of rats and dogs are considered similar to that of humans. 
The in vitro metabolite profile of voxelotor was obtained following incubation with Sprague-Dawley rats, beagle 
dogs,  Cynomolgus  monkeys,  and  human  liver  microsomes  and  hepatocytes.  Voxelotor,  studied  at  1 µM  or 
10 µM,  was  moderately  (10%  to  49%  after  2  hrs)  metabolised  through  both  Phase I  (O-dealkylation, 
mono-oxidations and reductions) and Phase II (glucuronidation and sulfation) metabolisms in both animal and 
human hepatocytes. Thirteen metabolites were identified, and no unique metabolite was observed from human 
liver microsomes or hepatocytes that was not also formed by rat, dog, or monkey microsomes or hepatocytes. 
The applicant provided a comparative table of voxelotor metabolites, specifying the percentage in all species, 
including human. There was no unique metabolite observed from human liver microsomes or hepatocytes that 
was not also formed by mouse, rat, dog, or monkey microsomes or hepatocytes. 
In vitro  metabolism  studies  using  human  liver  microsomes  and  recombinant  enzymes  are  consistent  with 
voxelotor  metabolism  by  CYP  1A1,  1B1,  2B6,  2C9,  2C19,  3A4,  and  3A5  enzymes.  With  respect  to  Phase  II 
metabolism  pathway  multiple  sulfation  (SULT  1A1,  1A3,  1B1,  1C4)  or  glucuronidation  (UGT  1A1,  1A3,  1A4, 
1A6, 1A9, 2B7, and 2B15) enzymes are possibly involved. Further study showed comparable contribution of 
the two main UGT enzymes, 1A1 and 1A9. 
Excretion 
After single oral administration of [14C]voxelotor, the excretion of radioactivity was predominantly through the 
faecal (biliary) pathway, and, for the intact rat, and dog, this accounted for 79% and 66% of the radioactivity 
dose, while the urinary route contributed 9.7% and 26%. The total recovery of radioactivity, ten days after 
dosing,  was  high  in  the  rat  (92%),  dog  (96%)  and  human  (>90%).  In  bile  duct-cannulated  rats,  following 
intravenous administration, excretion into the bile, faeces, urine and expired air was 84.2%, 1.8%, 7.5% and 
0.9%  of  the  radioactivity  dose,  respectively,  indicating  a  predominant  biliary  clearance.  The  main  route  of 
elimination of voxelotor is by metabolism. Following oral administration to rat or dog, 15% to 16% of the dose 
was excreted into faeces as unchanged voxelotor and this was <0.1% into urine. Most of the [14C]voxelotor–
related  radioactivity,  66%  and  51%,  was  excreted  into  faeces  as  20  and  13  metabolites  in  rat  and  dog, 
respectively. Similarly, in humans, 63% of the administered radioactivity was found in the faeces (~34% as 
intact drug) while 35% was excreted in the urine after 22 days (97% of the administered dose).  
In conclusion, following intravenous or oral administration, voxelotor was primarily cleared after metabolism 
via biliary excretion and faecal elimination in the tested preclinical species (rat and dog) and in human. Renal 
clearance plays a lesser role.

Major findings associated with repeat-dose administration of voxelotor in mice, rats and Cynomolgus monkeys 
were changes in hematopoietic parameters and gastrointestinal (GI) intolerance that was attributed to local 
irritation.  
Hematologic  changes  included  increased  RBCs,  reticulocytes,  and  haematocrit,  with  increased  cellularity  of 
bone  marrow  and  extramedullary  haematopoiesis  in  spleen  consistent  with  exaggerated  pharmacology  of 
voxelotor in normal animals. The exposure in dogs in the 4-week study at the highest tolerated dose was not 
sufficiently  high  to  cause  decreased  tissue  O2  extraction  and  dogs  did  not  have  erythroid  or  bone  marrow 
changes,  therefore  dogs  were  not  further  considered  as  test  species.  The  GI  effects  were  accompanied  by 
decreased food consumption, decreased body weights and/or body weight gain and early terminations (early 
sacrifice and or early death). Other findings attributed to voxelotor include induction of CYP enzymes in the 
liver of rats, altered T cell-dependent antigen response in rats and monkeys, and prolongation of QTc intervals 
in monkeys.  
The pharmacological effects observed in rats, mice and monkeys were largely comparable. Voxelotor induced 
a dose-dependent increase in the red blood mass (RBC, HCT,  Hb) which correlated microscopically with the 
increased hypercellularity of the bone marrow and extramedullary haematopoiesis in the spleen. 
The  calculated  Hb  occupancies  by  voxelotor  and  the  observed  haematological  effects  in  the  studies  with 
different species are presented below:

In vitro bacterial reverse mutation assays and in vivo evaluations (micronucleus and comet assays) from rats 
dosed up to 2000 mg/kg/day did not demonstrate evidence of mutagenicity or clastogenicity (studies PRC-
14-060-R and PRC-14-059-R). Therefore, there is a low risk of voxelotor being genotoxic in man. 
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity of voxelotor was studied in the 2-year study with rats study (PRC-16-009) and the 26-week 
study with transgenic mice (study PRC-17-006). In rats, increased incidence of hepatocellular adenoma and 
adrenal pheochromocytoma was seen in high-dose females (100 mg/kg/day). Voxelotor was demonstrated to 
induce  liver  enzymes  in  repeated  dose toxicity  studies,  leading  to  hepatocellular  hypertrophy  and increased 
liver weight in subchronic studies. Induction of CYP450 enzymes is a well-known non-genotoxic mode of action 
for  rodent  hepatocarcinogenesis,  resulting  in  the  CAR  nuclear  receptor  activation  and  subsequent  increased 
hepatocellular proliferation; however, the latter response is not observed in humans. Therefore, the observed 
increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas is not considered to represent carcinogenic risk for humans.  
Benign pheochromocytoma is a commonly occurring tumour in rats and up to date there are no indications that 
the  substances  inducing  pheochromocytomas  in  animal  experiments  also  induce  corresponding  tumours  in 
humans. Therefore, the increased incidence of pheochromocytomas in high-dose females observed in the rat 
study is also not considered to represent carcinogenic risk to humans. No increased tumour incidence was seen 
in the 26-week study with transgenic mice administered voxelotor up to the dose level of 500 mg/kg/day.  
The applicant has provided a justification that an increased incidence and severity oval cell hyperplasia seen in 
female rats administered ≥ 30 mg/kg/day is a rare spontaneous lesion which is possibly related to the CYP 
induction. In the literature it has been demonstrated that dose-related increases in hepatocellular adenomas 
are a common finding in rats administered compounds that cause induction of CYP enzyme activity (Maronpot, 
2010; Hall, 2012) and that rodent liver is more sensitive in response to CAR/PXR/PPAR activation than human 
liver.  
The sciatic nerve mineralisation and axonal degeneration seen in rats was considered to be an exacerbated 
background change which occurred at incidences comparable with historical control data. Thus this effect was 
not considered adverse.

2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity  of  voxelotor  was  studied  in  the  fertility  and  early  embryonic 
development (FEED) study in rats, embryo-foetal developmental (EFD) toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, pre- 
and postnatal developmental toxicity study in rats and a dose-range finding study in juvenile rats. In the FEED 
study, statistically significantly reduced sperm motility, reduced percentage of normal sperm and the increased 
percentage of abnormal sperm in cauda epididymis, increased testicular and prostate weight and decreased 
seminal vesicles weight were observed in the high-dose animals (250 mg/kg/day). The reproductive function 
was not affected. In the absence of testicular changes in the available long-term studies and the adverse effects 
on the male fertility these findings are considered non-adverse. Voxelotor did not have an effect on the embryo-
foetal development in either rats or rabbits at dose levels causing maternal toxicity.  
In the pre- and post-natal developmental toxicity study reduced pup viability index and reduced F1 generation 
body weight (in males until post-pairing day 55, in females until maturation day 7) was seen at the dose level 
of 250 mg/kg/day. The applicant hypothesised that decreased pup survival (PND 0-4) and persisting effects on 
body weight noted in rat pups at this dose level were related to maternal toxicity. However, voxelotor is also 
readily  excreted  in  milk  of  lactating  rats.  Milk  exposure  was  up  to  0.4-fold  plasma  exposure  of  the  dams, 
leading, subsequently, to plasma exposure in the pups.  
Mating of  F1  animals  from  the treated  F0  dams  resulted in  slightly  (not  statistically  significantly)  decreased 
male and female fertility indices, with an apparent dose-response trend (M: 86, 83, 74 and 71%, F: 95, 91, 83 
and 82% in controls, low-, mid- and high-dose groups, respectively). In order to check whether male fertility 
was adversely affected by treatment, the F1 males from treated females were additionally mated with naïve 
females.  In  this  case  no  adverse  effects  on  fertility  were  noted.  In  the  F1  dams  from  the  treated  females, 
statistically  significantly  reduced  number  of  corpora  lutea,  number  of  implantation  sites  and  number  of  live 
pups were observed compared to control animals. However, the observed values were still within the historical 
control ranges provided by the applicant and therefore appear to be caused by the unusually high (outside the 
historical control ranges) values in the concurrent controls.  
In the dose-range finding juvenile toxicity study, decreased body weight gain and dehydration were observed 
in  high-dose  (250  mg/kg/day)  pups.  Furthermore,  increased  red  cell  mass  and  spleen  weight  in  high-dose 
animals were observed, consistent with pharmacological action of voxelotor. As the observed effects in juvenile 
animals were consistent with the effects seen in adult animals, no full study was conducted. 
2.5.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
2.5.4.7.  Local tolerance  
Local tolerance of voxelotor was evaluated in two in vitro  eye irritation assays and an in vivo skin irritation 
study. Based on the results of the study, voxelotor was not irritating to either skin or eyes. However, these 
studies are considered irrelevant for the envisaged administration route (oral). In the conducted repeated dose 
toxicity  studies  with  rats,  dogs  and  monkeys  voxelotor  caused  gastrointestinal  tract  irritation.  This  effect  is 
considered clinically relevant.

EMA/102184/2022

2.5.4.8.  Other toxicity studies 
Phototoxicity  of  voxelotor  was  evaluated  in  an  in  vitro  and  an  in  vivo  assays.  While  positive  results  were 
obtained in vitro, in vivo voxelotor gave no indication of phototoxicity.  
No  dependence  studies  have  been  conducted;  however,  the  secondary  pharmacology  studies  provide 
evidence of inhibition of DOPA and GABA receptors by voxelotor in vitro. However, the voxelotor exposures in 
plasma were factor 90- to 180-fold lower than the IC50 values derived in the DOPA and GABA receptor assays 
in vitro. Furthermore, no evidence of CNS toxicity was seen in the available safety pharmacology study with 
rats and in the overall repeated dose toxicity studies. Thus voxelotor is not expected to induce dependence 
based on available data.  
With regard to impurities the specified impurity GBT441 has been qualified through toxicological studies 
according to ICH Q3A(R2). The applicant has provided an adequate Ames test with GBT441 which was 
negative. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In  the  ERA  of  the  applicant,  the  Fpen  was  refined  based  on  the  prevalence  of  sickle  cell  disease  (1.5  per 
10,000), which gives an Fpen of 0.00015 (resulting in a refined PECsw of 0.1125 μg/L. However, EMA’s public 
summary  on  opinion  on  orphan  designation  EU/3/16/1769  for  voxelotor  (as  adopted  by  the  Committee  for 
Orphan Medicinal Product (COMP) provides a different prevalence number: 3.2 in 10,000, which gives a new 
Fpen  of  0.00032.  The  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  (Report  VY23FR)  has  been  adapted  to  reflect  this 
recalculated value. There is no impact on the safety assessment based on this 2-fold increase in the Fpen value, 
given  that  both  values  generate  the  Phase  I  estimate  of  the  PECsw  > 0.01 μg/L.  The  applicant  was  also 
requested  to  append  study  report  FT36BR  (Griffiths,  2019)  with  the  measured  pH  values  during  the  study, 
which was needed to finalise the risk assessment for the surface water compartment. The amended report has 
been evaluated and is considered acceptable.  
Voxelotor  is  not  Persistent,  bioaccumulative  and  toxic  substance  (PBT),  nor  very  Persistent  very 
Bioaccumulative (vPvB).

2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Assessment of pharmacology data submitted and further analysis requested allowed to conclude the following: 
•  Affinity and dissociation constants for voxelotor to Hb for human HbS, HbA and HbF and for the animal 
equivalents and it is not expected that the voxelotor-Hb binding is different or not-reversible in animals. 
• 
• 
Partitioning / binding data for voxelotor to whole blood, plasma, RBC, Hb and HSA as well as information 
on the free voxelotor fraction in blood and data on accumulation in one of those fractions for human 
AA, AS, SC and SS subjects show that plasma ratio for healthy AA subjects is lower than for SS subjects, 
mainly due to the slightly higher Hb levels in plasma in SS subjects. 
The effect of voxelotor on the curve blood with low versus high level of HbF (~2 and ~30 %) looks 
different. The meaning of this difference is not clear. In the clinical part the relation between efficacy 
and percentage of HbF in blood is also discussed. 
•  Regarding  the  PK/PD  model,  from  the  pool  of  blood  included  in  the  model  development  and  model 
testing, the range of % haemoglobin (Hb)F included was 0% to 45%, with a median of 12% HbF. This 
means that HbF was at forehand not considered a factor to be of influence on the level of voxelotor Hb 
occupancy.  It  is  questioned  whether  this  is  a  fair  decision  however  in  the  clinical  part  the  relation 
between HbF percentage and efficacy from treatment with voxelotor is further discussed. In the model, 
a distinction was made for AA or SS blood by means of use of different equations for both types of 
blood.  Apparently  the  MCHC  values  are  even  a  bit  underestimated,  and  consequently  the  Hb 
occupancies are slightly overestimated. 
Overall,  the  primary  pharmacodynamic  studies  provided  adequate  evidence  that  voxelotor  binds  to  and 
stabilises  oxygen  loaded  Hb,  but  also  affects  the  dissociation  of  O2  from  voxelotor  bound  Hb.  Voxelotor 
preferentially partition to the RBC, which however differs between healthy and diseased blood / RBCs, which 
may be caused by a higher plasma Hb level in blood from SCD subjects. Voxelotor improves the sickling of 
blood, the blood viscosity and the deformability of RBCs, which is most effective at Hb-occupancies higher than 
the intended 30% in in vitro experiments due to experimental limitations. The effective dose in vivo is based 
on  clinical  data.  From  animal  experiments  a  target level  of  voxelotor  Hb  occupancy  ≥11%  was  sufficient  to 
increase  Hb  O2  affinity  and  reduce  ex  vivo  sickling,  however,  prolongation  of  RBC  half-life  and  decrease  in 
reticulocyte  count  were  only  observed  at  higher  Hb  occupancy  of  ≥32  %.  First  signs  of  compensatory 
erythropoiesis is observed in Cynomolgus monkey at voxelotor-Hb occupancy of 35%.   
Further signs of hypoxia and the immunosuppressive action of voxelotor were observed in animals in which a 
voxelotor-Hb  occupancy  of  ~50%  was  reached.  In  animals  there  seems  to  be  only  a  narrow  window  for 
Assessment report  
EMA/102184/2022 
Page 57/161 
 
 
 
 
 
voxelotor-Hb  occupancy  that  appears  safe  and  effective.  It  is  also  not  very  clear  whether  increase  in 
reticulocytes  (due  to  compensatory  erythropoiesis  and/or  haematopoiesis)  is  taken  into  account  in  the 
calculation of the voxelotor-Hb occupancies. It is considered that the support for an effective and safe dose 
should be based on clinical data and that accompanying voxelotor-Hb occupancies are controlled in patients. 
This is considered important as the increase O2 affinity of voxelotor-Hb also compromises the O2 off-loading 
capacity.  It  can  be  considered  that  the  body  needs  to  find  a  new  balance,  involving  the  generation  of  new 
reticulocytes.  
The results of the calculations of the Hb occupancy at different timepoints in the toxicological studies are further 
discussed in the toxicology section and can be accepted. It is considered that the support for an effective and 
safe dose in patients should be based on clinical data only. In that respect this issue is regarded solved from 
non-clinical of view. 
From  the  pharmacokinetic  point  of  view,  the  preclinical  species  rat,  dog  and  monkey  can  be  used  for  non-
clinical safety assessment. It should be considered, however, that due to the strong binding to Hb the whole 
blood PK behaviour is disturbed, and plasma PK seems more appropriate to assess peripheral voxelotor effects.  
Voxelotor was found to be excreted in the milk and exposure in milk was about 26% – 41% of the maternal 
plasma exposure. On lactation day 10, plasma exposure of voxelotor was found in the pups, which amounted 
to ~3.6% of maternal plasma voxelotor concentration. In conclusion, voxelotor is readily excreted in the milk 
leading, subsequently, to plasma exposure in the pups. This has been reflected in sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the 
SmPC . 
Overall, the toxicology programme revealed that the exaggerated pharmacological action of voxelotor leads to 
lower  offloading  of  oxygen  to  tissues  and  compensatory  erythropoiesis  in  the  bone  marrow  and  spleen  in 
different species (rat, mouse, monkeys). The applicant stated that this occurs only above the Hb occupancy by 
voxelotor above 50% and will not occur in patients for whom 30% Hb occupancy by voxelotor is envisaged. 
Based on the additionally provided calculations of the Hb occupancy at the different timepoints in the preclinical 
studies, it can be agreed that the Hb occupancy appears to be relatively stable after reaching the steady state, 
which occurs after 13 weeks of dosing in rats and monkeys, and that no appreciable degree of compensatory 
erythropoiesis occurs in case Hb occupancy  < 50%. However, as the safety margins between the preclinical 
studies and the anticipated clinical exposure are very low, the applicant has agreed to include compensatory 
erythropoiesis as an identified risk to be evaluated in the PSUR.  
Voxelotor caused gastro-intestinal tract effects in rats and monkeys, which were particularly severe in monkeys. 
These effects are also considered clinically relevant. However, as in the pivotal clinical studies the majority of 
adverse events of diarrhoea was Grade 1 or Grade 2, self-limiting, and manageable without the need for dose 
interruption,  dose  reduction,  or  treatment  discontinuation.  Therefore,  diarrhoea  an  identified  risk  is  not 
considered important  for  inclusion  in the list of  safety  concerns in  the  RMP;  nevertheless,  the  applicant  will 
monitor these findings in the PSUR. 
A number of adverse effects were observed in the test animals at dose levels comparable or even lower than 
the  anticipated  clinical  exposure.  These  include  in  particular  overall  low  tolerability  of  voxelotor  in  monkeys 
(mortality  at  EM  ~0.9  based  on  plasma  Cmax);  the  immunosuppressive  action  of  voxelotor,  manifested  as 
significantly reduced IgG (rats, monkeys) and IgM (monkeys) titres, delayed antibody response (monkeys) and 
changes in the relative lymphocyte distribution (rats) at EM of ~0.5 in monkeys and ~4.5 in rats (based on 
plasma Cmax); prolonged QT and QTc intervals in monkeys at EM of ~2.5 (based on plasma Cmax) and gastro-
intestinal tract lesions in rats and monkeys (EM ~ 1.5 in monkeys based on plasma Cmax). While poor tolerability 
Assessment report

Page 58/161 
 
 
 
in  monkeys  was  explained  by  the  applicant  by  adverse  gastro-intestinal  tract  effects,  it  is  considered  more 
likely that it was caused by opportunistic infections due to immunosuppressive action of voxelotor. In view of 
these findings the applicant has agreed to include the immunosuppression as an identified risk in Part II module 
SII of the Risk Management Plan. The prolonged QT and QTc intervals could have been related to the poor 
condition of the animals, as they were not seen in the 39-week study at comparable (slightly lower) exposure 
levels. Furthermore, based on the calculated free voxelotor concentrations in plasma and IC50 values for the 
hERG channel inhibition in vitro the “true” QT interval prolongation due to hERG channel inhibition by voxelotor 
is considered not likely. 
Implications  of  the  assessment  of  non-clinical  data  for  the  Safety  Specification  of  the  Risk 
Management  Plan  (RMP):  The  following  non-clinical  safety  observations  were  considered  relevant  for  the 
clinical  safety  to  the  extent  that  it  will  be  included  by  the  applicant  in  the  Part  II  module  SII  of  the  Risk 
Management Plan:  
1)  Compensatory erythropoiesis observed in rats, monkeys and mice (early stages observed at EM ~0.5 
of the anticipated clinical exposure in rats and ~0.6 in monkeys based on plasma Cmax). In addition, 
the applicant will monitor these findings in the PSUR. 
2)  The  immunosuppressive  action  of  voxelotor,  manifested  as  increased  mortality  due  to  opportunistic 
infections in monkeys, significantly reduced IgG (rats, monkeys) and IgM (monkeys) titres, delayed 
antibody response (monkeys) and changes in the relative lymphocyte distribution (rats) at EM of ~0.5 
in monkeys and ~4.5 in rats (based on plasma Cmax). 
Environmental Risk Assessment: The applicant concludes that voxelotor is unlikely to represent a risk to 
the aquatic or terrestrial environments and is not bio-accumulative but is very persistent in sediment which is 
reflected in Sections 5.3 and 6.6 of the SmPC. 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
From a non-clinical point of view, although uncertainties remain about the degree to which Hb occupancy can 
be controlled and its correlation with the induction of compensatory erythropoiesis, these issues are not further 
pursued in view of the obtained clinical safety data in healthy subjects and SCD patients. The applicant has 
agreed  to  include  the  compensatory  erythropoiesis,  immunosuppression  and  adverse  gastro-intestinal  tract 
effects action as important non-clinical safety findings in Part II module SII and as identified risks in Part II 
module SVII of the Risk Management Plan) which provides sufficient reassurance.  
Therefore, from a non-clinical point of view, a voxelotor is considered approvable.

2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of voxelotor have been investigated in 18 clinical studies (16 studies in healthy volunteers 
and 3 studies in patients) in whole blood, plasma and red blood cells. Only the PK of voxelotor in whole blood 
and plasma is reported. The PK of voxelotor in red blood cells is a calculated value based on the concentration 
in whole blood and plasma and the haematocrit value. Therefore, the PK of voxelotor in red blood cells is an 
indirect derived value.

Single dose studies were performed over a dose range of 100 to 2800 mg voxelotor. Multiple dose studies were 
performed over a dose range of 600 to 1800 mg voxelotor. In addition, several in vitro studies were performed 
to investigate the permeability, metabolism, transporter substrate potential and the inhibition and induction 
potential towards CYPs, UGTs, SULTs and transporters. 
Physical-chemical properties 
Voxelotor has a molecular weight of 337.38 g/mol. Voxelotor is a weak base and has better solubility in low pH 
buffers than in higher pH buffers. Voxelotor does not have any stereocentres.  
Analytical methods 
Voxelotor was analysed in K2-EDTA whole blood or plasma using LC-MS/MS. The analytical methods used to 
determine voxelotor in whole blood and plasma appear to be sufficiently validated. The LLOQ ranged from 10 
to 120 ng/mL in whole blood and from 0.10 to 6.0 ng/mL in plasma between the different analytical methods. 
Population PK (PopPK) modelling: A PopPK model was developed to describe the PK of voxelotor in plasma and 
whole  blood  in  patients  with  sickle  cell  disease.  The  joint  model  structure  is  quite  empirical  with  an  effect 
compartment  describing  the  whole  blood  and  plasma  concentrations.  A  limitation  to  this  approach  is  that 
differences between plasma and whole blood pharmacokinetics can only be detected in the blood to plasma 
ratio and the rate constant representing the delay between plasma and whole blood pharmacokinetics. Blood 
volume was included in the model as covariate, which is derived using body weight, height and gender. The 
final model adequately describes both plasma and whole blood pharmacokinetics reasonably well in patients 
aged  12  years  and  older.  Parameter  estimates  are  reasonable  and  no  clear  structural  deviations  can  be 
observed in the goodness-of-fit plots.  
Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling: The PBPK model was developed to investigate the PK 
in paediatric patients with sickle cell disease and to extrapolate the DDI results in healthy volunteers to patients 
with sickle cell disease. The final PBPK model was able to predict the PK in plasma and whole blood within 1.3-
fold of observed exposures for patients aged 12 years and older.  
Absorption  
The PK of voxelotor in plasma and whole blood were investigated in 9 single dose (100-2800 mg voxelotor) 
clinical  studies  and  3  repeated  dose  (300-1800  mg voxelotor  once  daily)  clinical  studies in healthy  subjects

under fasted conditions. Following a single dose, voxelotor is rapidly absorbed in plasma in healthy subjects 
and slower in whole blood. Median plasma tmax was around 2 hours (2-8 h) in plasma and ~18 hours (10-24 
h) in whole blood. The tmax in whole blood decreased to ~8 hours following repeated dosing. Voxelotor is dose-
proportional over the 100 to 2800 mg dose range in both plasma and whole blood. Steady-state is reached 
around 12 days in healthy subjects. In plasma, the observed accumulation ratio ranged from 2.1-fold to 5.8-
fold for the Cmax and from 2.8 fold to 6.7-fold for the AUC0-24 following repeated once daily dosing. In whole 
blood, the accumulation ratio ranged from 2.9-fold to 5.6 fold for the Cmax and from 2.8-fold to 6.0-fold for the 
AUC0-24  following  repeated  once  daily  dosing.  No  time-dependency  was  observed;  the  elimination  half-life 
observed  after  a  single  dose  was  comparable  to  the  elimination  half-life  after  repeated  dosing  in  healthy 
volunteers.

concentration - time curve (B) after a single dose (study GBT440-001) 
No  information  was  provided  on  the  intra-individual  variability  in  healthy  volunteers.  In  plasma,  the  inter-
individual  variability  was  ~30%  for  the  Cmax  and  ~25%  for  the  AUC.  In  whole  blood,  the  inter-individual 
variability was ~25% for the Cmax and ~20% for the AUC. 
The absolute oral bioavailability was not investigated. The absorption of voxelotor following oral administration 
is ~35% (24.8-41.4%) based on the elimination of radioactivity in urine, but up to ~60% if it is assumed that 
only the first 48-hour radioactivity in faeces is unabsorbed voxelotor. The effect of first pass metabolism on 
the systemic exposure is unknown. Based on the mass balance study, two hours after dosing (tmax) voxelotor 
accounted for 35% of the radioactivity in plasma and 65% was metabolite. These data indicate that extensive 
first pass metabolism may occur following absorption after oral administration. Thus, the oral bioavailability of 
voxelotor is most likely moderate to low (~12% to 30%). 
Concomitant  administration  with  a  moderate-fat  breakfast  had  a  small  effect  on  voxelotor  plasma  PK  (Cmax 
20% higher and AUCinf 32% higher) and no effect on the whole blood PK. Concomitant administration with a 
high-fat meal had a more pronounced effect on the voxelotor plasma PK (Cmax 95% higher and AUCinf 43% 
higher) and whole blood PK (Cmax 45% higher and AUCinf 42% higher). Overall, food resulted in higher exposure 
to voxelotor compared to fasted conditions, with increasing exposure with higher fat content. 
Different formulations were used during development. The different clinical formulation appear not to lead to 
significantly different exposure based on the PK data from the 3 bioequivalence studies.

Distribution 
The in vitro plasma protein binding of voxelotor is >99%. 
The in vivo blood-to-plasma ratio of voxelotor was ~33:1 (ranging from 15:1 to 45:1) after a single dose and 
~23:1 (ranging from 15:1 to 38:1) after repeated dosing. At the clinical dose of 1500 mg following repeated 
dosing, the blood-to-plasma ratio was ~19:1. 
Voxelotor is able to permeate Caco-2 cells via passive diffusion and is a high permeable compound. 
The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) was ~800 L in healthy volunteers based on plasma data. If the oral 
bioavailability  ranges  from  ~12  to  30%,  the  volume  of  distribution  is  96  L  to  240  L,  indicating  extensive 
distribution. 
Elimination 
In  vivo  human  studies  indicate  that  voxelotor  is  extensively  metabolised  through  Phase  I,  Phase  II,  and 
combinations of Phase I and II metabolism. The major human metabolites are M218 (O-dealkylation-sulfation; 
10-17%),  M515  (reduction-glucuronidation),  and  M513  (glucuronidation)  (combined  7.9-17%).  Voxelotor  is 
oxidised to many minor metabolites and directly glucuronidated to M513. The major human metabolite M218 
is formed by oxidation and subsequent sulphate conjugation. The second most abundant plasma metabolite, 
M515, is formed by reduction and subsequent glucuronidation. The major metabolite M218 was not observed 
in one of the excreta (most likely the sulphate is deconjugated in faeces by the microflora or in urine due to 
the pH). The glucuronide metabolites M513 and 515 have been observed in urine and not in faeces, this may 
be  because  the  glucuronide  metabolites  are  only  excreted  via  urine  or  are  deconjugated  by  the  intestinal 
microflora when excreted via faeces. 
In vitro studies indicate that voxelotor is metabolised by multiple CYP, UGT and SULT isozymes. Voxelotor is 
metabolised  by  CYP3A4,  2C19,  1A1,  2B6,  3A5  and  2C9.  In  addition,  voxelotor  is  glucuronidated  mainly  by 
UGT1A1 and 1A9 and to a lower extent also by UGT1A3, 1A4, 1A6, 1A9, 2B7, and 2B15. Furthermore, SULT1B1 
and 1C4 are the main SULT isozymes involved in the sulphate metabolite of voxelotor M218 and SULT1A1 and 
1A3 are involved to a lower extent. 
Transporters 
In  vitro  experiments  were  performed  to  investigate  if  voxelotor  was  a  substrate  of  P-glycoprotein,  BCRP, 
OATP1A2  OATP1B1,  OATP1B3  and  BSEP.  Voxelotor  was  not  a  substrate  of  these  transporters  at  the  tested 
concentrations (up to 30 µM for OATP1A1, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and BSEP and up to 300 µM for P-glycoprotein 
and BCRP). 
Excretion 
In the mass balance study, voxelotor radioactivity is eliminated via urine (35%) and faeces (63%). Data from 
the first 48 hour following dosing indicates that up to 60% of the dose may be absorbed. Thus, around half of 
the absorbed radioactivity dose is eliminated via urine and half via faeces. 
Voxelotor is slowly cleared from plasma and whole blood. The t½ is 108 h in plasma and 77 h in whole blood. 
Assessment report  
EMA/102184/2022 
Page 67/161 
 
 
 
 
 
The  apparent  clearance  from  plasma  is  ~5.5  L/h  and  from  whole  blood  0.16  L/h.  If  the  oral  bioavailability 
ranges from ~12 to 30%, the clearance is 0.66 L/h to 1.65 L/h for plasma and 0.019 L/h to 0.048 L/h for whole 
blood, indicating low clearance from the body. 
PK in patients with sickle cell disease 
Following repeated dosing with 1500 mg once daily to patients with sickle cell disease, the Cmax is ~14 µg/mL 
(CV% = 25) in plasma and 180 µg/mL (CV% = 31) in whole blood. The AUC is 278 µg × h/mL (CV% = 29) in 
plasma and 3830 µg × h/mL (CV% = 34) in whole blood. The PK is similar in paediatric patients aged 12-17 
years  compared  to  adults.  The  population  pharmacokinetic  model  estimates  a  half-life  in  plasma  of  ~39  h 
following a 1500 mg dose. The estimated apparent clearance is 6 L/h. 
Voxelotor was administered under fasted conditions in study GBT440-001, but independent of food in studies 
GBT440-007 and GBT440-031. The overall impact of the food effect is considered limited in patients with sickle 
cell disease (based on the PopPK model). 
The PK of voxelotor in subjects with sickle cell disease is different from that in healthy subjects. In plasma, the 
exposure after repeated dosing with 1500 mg voxelotor once daily is ~1.6-fold higher in healthy volunteers 
compared to patients with sickle cell disease. In whole blood, the exposure after repeated dosing with 1500 
mg voxelotor once daily is ~2.0-fold higher of healthy volunteers compared to patients with sickle cell disease.  
The PopPK estimates an intra-individual variability of 24% in plasma and of 17% in whole blood. The inter-
individual variability was higher in patients with sickle cell disease compared to healthy volunteers, but this is 
most likely due to different sickle cell genotypes which appear to have an effect on the PK. 
Furthermore, the blood-to-plasma ratio of voxelotor following repeated dosing was ~16.6:1 in patients with 
sickle cell disease which is slightly lower than in healthy volunteers (~19:1). 
The accumulation ratio in patients with sickle cell disease was ~2.5-fold for the Cmax and ~3-fold for the AUC 
in  plasma  following  repeated  dosing  and  ~3-fold  for  the  Cmax  and  AUC  for  whole  blood.  The  accumulation 
following repeated dosing is less than in healthy volunteers. Steady-state is reached around 8 days in patients 
with sickle cell disease which is 4 days less than in healthy volunteers. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Special populations 
The effect of renal function and hepatic function were investigated in dedicated clinical studies. In addition, the 
effect of haematocrit, renal function, gender, race, weight and age was investigated using the developed final 
PopPK model. 
Haematocrit 
Time-varying haematocrit concentration was a significant covariate in the population pharmacokinetic model 
that influenced the blood to plasma ratio. 
Genetic polymorphisms 
Voxelotor is metabolised by many CYP and UGT isozymes. It is therefore unlikely that genetic polymorphisms 
in one of these isozymes will significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of voxelotor.

Renal impairment 
Renal  function  had  minor  effects  on  voxelotor  exposures  in  plasma  in  healthy  volunteers  (a  20%  higher 
exposure in subjects with severe renal impairment). Furthermore, a 17 to 35% higher exposure was observed 
in patients with sickle cell disease with baseline Cystatin C levels of 0.52-0.71 mg/mL). Overall, renal function 
had minor effects on voxelotor exposures in healthy volunteers and patients with sickle cell disease. No dose 
adjustment is needed in patients with impaired renal function. 
Hepatic impairment 
In plasma, the Cmax was 1.2-fold higher in subjects with mild hepatic impairment, 1.5-fold higher in subjects 
with  moderate  hepatic  impairment  and  1.4-fold  higher  in  subjects  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  and  the 
AUCinf was 1.1-fold higher in subjects with mild hepatic impairment, 1.2-fold higher in subjects with moderate 
hepatic impairment and 1.9-fold higher in subjects with severe hepatic impairment. In whole blood, increase 
in exposure was similar to that in plasma. No dose adjustment is warranted in subjects with mild to moderate 
hepatic impairment, but it is recommended to reduce the daily dose of voxelotor to 1000 mg in subjects with 
severe hepatic impairment. The Cmax values in patients with severe hepatic impairment dosed at 1000 mg once 
daily are expected to be similar to those in patients with normal hepatic function treated at the recommended 
dose of 1500 mg daily. The AUC is expected to be ~25% higher in subjects with severe hepatic impairment 
compared to those in patients with normal hepatic function treated at the recommended dose of 1500 mg daily. 
This is not considered to be of clinical relevance. 
Race 
Voxelotor PK is similar in white and black patients. In Arab or middle-eastern subjects, whole blood observed 
trough exposures were statistically higher than exposures in other subjects (31% higher than black subjects). 
The difference in exposure will not lead to any difference in clinical practice. 
Gender 
Gender was not a significant covariate in the final PopPK model, but blood volume (derived by bodyweight, 
height and gender) was a significant covariate. Therefore, gender was indirectly a significant covariate. The 
applicant  estimated  that  female  subjects  had  an  approximately  10%  higher  exposure  compared  to  male 
subjects. This difference is not considered to be clinically relevant. 
Age 
The effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of voxelotor was based on simulations with a 1500 mg once daily 
dose  using  the  final  PopPK  model.  Age  was  not  a  significant  covariate  in  the PopPK  model.  However,  blood 
volume was a significant covariate in the model, which was estimated using body weight, height and gender. 
The addition of blood volume to the PopPK model, on the parameter representing the volume of distribution of 
the  central  compartment,  resulted  in  the  loss  of  an  age  effect.  Age  and  blood  volume  were  found  to  be 
correlated. Therefore, potential age affects are accounted for using the addition of blood volume. The difference 
between adolescents and adults in blood volume did not lead to statistically significant increases in voxelotor 
exposure. 
Weight 
Body weight was not a significant covariate in the final PopPk model. However, blood volume was included in 
the model, which is derived using body weight, height and gender. Therefore, body weight is influencing the 
pharmacokinetics of voxelotor through the estimated blood volume covariate.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Voxelotor as victim 
In vitro data indicate that voxelotor is metabolised via multiple routes (CYP3A4, 2C19, 1A1, 2B6, 3A5 and 2C9; 
UGT1A1 and 1A9 and SULT1B1 and 1C4). A clinical DDI study with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (itraconazole) 
showed no effect on the PK of voxelotor, indicating that the other enzymes are able to take over if CYP3A4 is 
inhibited. PBPK modelling indicated that strong CYP3A inhibitors had no effect on the PK of voxelotor, confirming 
the clinical DDI study in healthy volunteers. 
The effect of a strong inducer on the PK of voxelotor was not investigated.  
In a clinical DDI study, the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole did not affect the PK of voxelotor indicating that 
an increase in gastric pH does not affect the absorption of voxelotor. Furthermore, the PopPK model indicated 
that hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea) did not have an effect on the PK of voxelotor. 
Voxelotor as perpetrator 
In  vitro  data  indicate  that  voxelotor  is  an  inhibitor  of  CYP3A4  at  maximal  intestinal  concentrations  and  at 
maximal systemic concentrations. In addition, voxelotor is a time dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4 at maximal 
systemic concentration. In addition, voxelotor is an in vitro inhibitor of CYP2B6, 2C8, 2C9, and 2C19 at maximal 
systemic  concentration.  Clinical  DDI  studies  were  performed  with  voxelotor  as  inhibitor  towards  CYP1A2 
(caffeine), 2C8 (rosiglitazone), 2C9 (S-warfarin), 2C19 (omeprazole), 2D6 (metoprolol) and 3A4 (midazolam). 
No interaction of voxelotor was observed of substrates of CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6. A slight effect 
was observed towards the CYP3A4 substrate (~1.6-fold increase in AUC), indicating that voxelotor is a mild 
CYP3A4 inhibitor at this dosing. The clinical DDI studies were performed with a dose of 900 mg voxelotor for 2 
days followed by 600 mg for 2 days. The Cmax and AUC were much lower than observed in patients at steady 
state. 
In  vitro  data  indicate  that  voxelotor  was  not  an  inhibitor  of  UG1A1,  1A9  and  2B7  at  maximal  systemic 
concentration.  Due  to  solubility  issues,  no  concentrations  up  to  maximal  intestinal  concentrations  could  be 
investigated for UGT1A1. No inhibition was observed towards UGT1A1 up to 100 µM (the highest concentration 
investigated). 
In vitro data indicate that voxelotor is an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein at maximal intestinal concentrations and 
at maximal systemic concentrations. Voxelotor is an inhibitor of OATP1B1, OAT3, MATE1 and BSEP at maximal 
systemic concentration and also for OATP1B1 at maximal portal vein concentrations. A clinical DDI study was 
performed with voxelotor as inhibitor towards P-glycoprotein (digoxin). The study indicated that voxelotor is 
not an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein at clinically relevant concentrations.  
No clinical DDI studies were performed towards OATP1B1, OAT3 and MATE1.  
In vitro data indicates that voxelotor may be an inducer of CYP2B6 via CAR at maximal systemic concentrations.  
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Assessment report

Voxelotor  is  an  orally  bioavailable  small-molecule  haemoglobin  S  polymerisation  inhibitor  that  allosterically 
modifies haemoglobin (Hb)-O2 affinity. A single voxelotor molecule binds per Hb tetramer in a 1:1 stoichiometry 
(one  molecule  per  Hb  tetramer),  with  high  partitioning  into  the  RBC.  Voxelotor  causes  a  dose  dependent 
decrease in p20 and p50 (the partial pressure of oxygen resulting respectively in 20% and 50% saturation of 
haemoglobin  with  oxygen),  indicating  an  increase  in  Hb-O2  affinity.  Mechanistically,  voxelotor  delays  the 
transition from oxyHb to deoxygenated Hb in hypoxic conditions, indicating the stabilisation of the oxyHb state. 
It is hypothesised that increasing Hb oxygen affinity in at least 20-30% of HbS, inhibits HbS polymerisation 
and,  as  a  result,  RBC  sickling.  This  target  is  based  on  the  experience  In  patients  with  sickle  hereditary 
persistence of foetal haemoglobin (s/HPFH), where it was shown that the dilution of HbS by 20% to 30% foetal 
haemoglobin  (HbF)  in  all  RBCs  suffices  to  inhibit  HbS  polymerisation.  Similar  to  HbF,  oxyhaemoglobin  is  a 
potent inhibitor of HbS polymerisation. Therefore, the therapeutic target of 20% to 30% Hb modification by 
voxelotor was used as a target in the clinical studies. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Pharmacodynamics  of  voxelotor  is  based  on  (1)  in  vitro  studies  in  human  blood  and  (2)  clinical  studies  in 
healthy volunteers and SCD patients.  
Study  GBT440-001  is  the  key  clinical  study  for  the  investigation  of  the  clinical  pharmacology  profiling  of 
voxelotor. This was a Phase 1, first-in-human, multiple-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled, double blind, 
single  and  multiple  ascending  dose  (MAD)  study  to  evaluate  safety  and  tolerability  of  voxelotor  in  healthy 
subjects and in subjects with SCD.  
Based on the in vitro data, a model was established to determine the percentage haemoglobin modification 
(%HbMOD) and occupancy by voxelotor. The model is based on the oxygen equilibrium curves (OECs), which 
are modulated by the change in haemoglobin oxygen (Hb-O2) affinity by voxelotor. For this model, ∆p20 was 
chosen as the best parameter to predict the voxelotor/Hb ratio (% Hb modification) at or below 40%. 
Therefore,  ∆p20  values  from  blood  samples  of  subjects  dosed  with  voxelotor  in  Clinical  Study  GBT440-001 
were used to calculate the % Hb modification, based on the equations below: 
AA Blood 
SS Blood 
Note: The numerators (0.07 and 0.16) are the Y intercepts for AA and SS blood, respectively. The denominators 
(24.58 and 27.33) respectively are the slopes obtained from the linear fit of the model. 
The %HbMOD mean values, which are based on ∆p20, increased with increasing dose in both healthy subjects 
and  subjects  with  SCD  after  single  and  multiple  dosing  and  p20  values  generally  decreased  with  increasing 
dose, indicating an increase in Hb-O2 affinity. In healthy subjects there was also a decrease in p50 values with 
increasing dose but less than seen in p20 and in SCD patients no difference in p50 was observed with increasing 
dose. As an example, the data after multiple dosing is presented below.

This estimate of % Hb modification was correlated to the % Hb occupancy which is defined as the molar ratio 
of the voxelotor concentration in RBCs to the estimated Hb concentration (5000 µM) in RBCs (equation below) 
from voxelotor-dosed subjects. 
The voxelotor concentration in RBCs was determined using the voxelotor concentration (µM) in whole blood 
and plasma (obtained from pharmacokinetic data) and the haematocrit (Hct) (obtained from haematology labs) 
as described in the equation below. 
It  was  observed  that  %Hb  occupancy  calculated  from  calculated  voxelotor  RBC  concentration  was  a  good 
predictor of the pharmacodynamic effect of increasing Hb-O2 affinity based on oxygen equilibrium curve (OECs) 
measurements (Δ p20). Therefore, %Hb occupancy was used in clinical studies assessing voxelotor to predict 
the PD effect of increasing Hb-O2 affinity. (see figure below)

Haematological Response in SCD Subjects 
Treatment response was evaluated by improvement in measures of haemolysis including evidence of increase 
in  Hb  and  reduction  from baseline  in  indirect  bilirubin,  reticulocytes,  and  LDH.  The  change  from  baseline  in 
percent of sickled red cells was also evaluated. 
In subjects (n = 13) receiving treatment with voxelotor for ≥90 days, a clinically meaningful increase in Hb 
(≥1 g/dL) was observed in 46% (6/13) versus 0% (0/14) of placebo subjects with concordant improvements 
in bilirubin and reticulocyte count demonstrating rapid and sustained reduction in haemolysis and a greater 
than 70% median decline in sickled red cells (see table below)

Secondary pharmacology 
Study GBT440-0115, a thorough QT (TQT) was conducted in healthy subjects to 
investigate the effect of voxelotor on the QT interval/QT interval corrected for heart 
rate (QTc) and also evaluated the relationship of plasma voxelotor concentration 
and  electrophysiologic  effects.  Moxifloxacin  was  included  as  a  positive  control  to 
establish that the study was sufficiently sensitive to detect a small QT effect, thus 
demonstrating assay sensitivity (ICH, 2015; Shah, 2005). 
Effect on Heart Rate 
Mean ∆HR on voxelotor was larger than with placebo on Days 4 and 14, the days 
when plasma concentrations of voxelotor reached meaningful levels. Mean placebo-
corrected ∆HR (ΔΔHR) ranged from 4.9 to 8.7 bpm on Day 4 and from 6.0 to 10.2 
bpm on Day 14, thereby demonstrating a small drug effect on HR. 
Effect on Cardiac Repolarisation: the QT Interval 
A  mild,  but  not  apparently  dose-  or  concentration-dependent  effect  of  voxelotor 
was seen on ∆∆QTcF on Days 4 and 14. On Day 4, mean ∆∆QTcF exceeded 5 msec 
at several time points, with a largest mean value of 8.0 msec (90% CI: 4.60, 11.42 
msec) at 24 hours post-dose. On Day 14, with higher plasma concentrations than 
on Day 4, the difference was smaller, with mean ΔΔQTcF ranging from 0.8 msec at 
12 hours post-dose to 5.4 msec at 1 hour post dose.

The predicted ΔΔQTcF at the GM peak voxelotor concentration overall and within 
each day is shown in table 20. Based on this concentration-QTc analysis, a QT effect 
(ΔΔQTcF) above 10 msec can be excluded in voxelotor plasma concentration of up 
to approximately 30 µg/mL.

Exposure-response analyses 
Exposure-response (ER) and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) analyses of voxelotor efficacy in adult 
and  adolescent  subjects  up  to  at least  week  72  were  performed in  study  GBT-CP-014,  for  a  pooled  dataset 
including  data  from  adolescent  subjects  in  GBT440-007  and  all  subjects  in  GBT440-031.  The  changes  from 
baseline  in  Hb  and  other  measures  of  haemolysis  were  evaluated  as  a  function  of  time-matched  model-
predicted  whole  blood  voxelotor  concentrations.  Figure  5  shows  CFB  Hb  increasing  with  whole-blood 
concentration, consistent with the mechanism of action of the drug.

The data was also analysed by subject age (adolescent versus adult), and by nominal time of visit (≤ 12 weeks, 
12 to 24 weeks, and 24 to 72 weeks). The same trends were observed as observed for the data including all 
subjects  and  all  visits  indicating  that  the  ER  relationship  is  similar  for  adults  and  adolescents  and  does  not 
change over time. Relationships with other covariates were consistent. The slope in subjects with HU use was 
marginally  shallower  than  in  subjects  without  HU  use;  however,  both  cohorts  surpass  the  targeted  1  g/dL 
increase at the median 1500 mg exposure. No differences were observed by sex, SCD genotype, weight, or 
race. No clinically impactful differences in the relationship between CFB Hb and covariates were observed.

indirect bilirubin, and LDH, the % CFB was larger at higher whole blood concentrations, and all relationships 
were statistically significant (p < 0.001). The magnitude of the % CFB for percent reticulocytes and for indirect 
bilirubin was noticeably larger than the magnitude of the % CFB for LDH and for absolute reticulocytes. While 
some patients did achieve substantial reductions in LDH and absolute reticulocytes, the mean responses for 
the 900 mg and 1500 mg dose groups were similar.

The analyses were also evaluated facetted by bins of nominal time. For all four measures of haemolysis, the

Pharmacokinetics 
Assessment report

The pharmacokinetics of voxelotor have been investigated in 19 clinical studies (16 studies in healthy volunteers 
and 3 studies in patients) in whole blood, plasma and red blood cells. The PK was sufficiently investigated in 
patients with sickle cell disease aged 12 years and older. The PK of voxelotor in subjects with sickle cell disease 
is different from that in healthy subjects (exposure and blood-to-plasma ratio is higher in healthy volunteers 
compared to patients). Some uncertainties remain regarding drug-drug interactions (voxelotor as victim and 
as perpetrator). 
Population PK (PopPK) modelling: A PopPK model was developed to describe the PK of voxelotor in plasma and 
whole  blood  in  patients  with  sickle  cell  disease.  The  joint  model  structure  is  quite  empirical  with  an  effect 
compartment  describing  the  whole  blood  and  plasma  concentrations.  A  limitation  to  this  approach  is  that 
differences between plasma and whole blood pharmacokinetics can only be detected in the blood to plasma 
ratio and the rate constant representing the delay between plasma and whole blood pharmacokinetics. Blood 
volume was included in the model as covariate, which is derived using body weight, height and gender. The 
final model adequately describes both plasma and whole blood pharmacokinetics reasonably well in patients 
aged  12  years  and  older.  Parameter  estimates  are  reasonable  and  no  clear  structural  deviations  can  be 
observed in the goodness-of-fit plots.  
Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling: The PBPK model cannot be used to waive PK studies 
in subjects <12 years of age. Furthermore the PBPK model to extrapolate the DDI studies in healthy volunteers 
to patients with Sickle cell disease, to predict the inhibition potential of voxelotor towards transporter inhibition 
and  to  predict  the  effect  of  induction  on  the  PK  of  voxelotor  was  not  acceptable.  The  PBPK  model  was  not 
sufficiently  qualified to  predict the  effect of  voxelotor  as  inhibitor towards  CYP2C8,  2C9,  2C19  and 3A4  and 
OAT3.  In  addition,  also  the  PBPK  model  to  predict  the  effect  of  induction  on  the  PK  of  voxelotor  instead  of 
performing a clinical DDI study is currently not acceptable. The model cannot be verified with clinical induction 
data. 
Pharmacokinetic Interaction studies 
The effect of a strong inducer on the PK of voxelotor was not investigated. A strong PXR inducer may lead to a 
significant  decrease  in  voxelotor  exposure  and  to  decreased  efficacy.  Therefore,  concomitant  use  of  strong 
CYP3A4 inducers with voxelotor should be avoided due to the risk of decreased efficacy of voxelotor. This has 
been reflected in section 4.5 and 5.2 of the SmPC. Since PXR inducers are not commonly used concomitantly 
in patients with sickle cell disease, no clinical DDI study is currently warranted and a warning is sufficient. 
It is currently unknown if voxelotor is a substrate of P-glycoprotein, BCRP, OATP1A2, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 
at clinically relevant concentrations. Therefore, currently no clinical transporter DDI studies are warranted. 
The suitability of the DDI studies to predict clinical DDIs with voxelotor as perpetrator towards CYP2C8, 2C9, 
2C19 and 3A4 is questioned (in vitro data already indicated that voxelotor is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2 and 
2D6  at  clinically  relevant  concentrations).  The  clinical  DDI  studies  were  performed  with  a  dose  of  900  mg 
voxelotor for 2 days followed by 600 mg for 2 days which is much lower than the 1500 mg dose of voxelotor 
administered to patients. Furthermore, the Cmax and AUC were much lower than observed in patients at steady 
state. It is currently unknown if voxelotor is a clinically relevant inhibitor of CYP2B6, 2C8, 2C9, and 2C19 at 
maximal systemic concentration in patients with Sickle cell disease. Based on the available data that voxelotor 
is  at  least  a  moderate  inhibitor  of  CYP3A4  and  should  not  be  co-administered  with  CYP3A4  substrates  with 
narrow  therapeutic  index.  However,  it  cannot  be  excluded  that  voxelotor  is  more  than  a  moderate  CYP3A4

inhibitor. The inhibition potential towards CYP2C8, 2C9, 2C19 and 3A4 will be investigated as part of the Post-
Authorisation Measure (PAM) proposed by the applicant towards CYP2B6 inhibition in one cocktail DDI study.  
A clinical DDI study with voxelotor as inhibitor towards OATP1B1, OAT3 and MATE1 will be performed as PAM. 
It is unknown if voxelotor may inhibit BCRP at maximal intestinal concentrations. However, no in vitro studies 
can be performed to investigate this due to cytotoxicity problems at such high concentrations. The applicant 
reviewed  the  safety  data  for  subjects  who  used  BCRP  substrates  concomitantly  with  voxelotor.  Only  three 
subjects received concomitant BCRP substrates. None of these three subjects showed an increase in adverse 
events  compared  with  subjects  who  did  not  receive  concomitant  BCRP  substrates.  This  may  indicate  that 
voxelotor  is  not  a  clinically  relevant  inhibitor  of  BCRP.  However,  three  subjects  is  too  limited  to  draw  firm 
conclusions.  A  DDI  study  will  be  performed  with  rosuvastatin  as  substrate  for  OATP1B1  to  investigate  the 
inhibition  potential  of  voxelotor  towards  OATP1B1.  The  applicant  is  advised  to  include  measurement  of 
Coproporphyrins I as biomarker for OATP1B1 to distinguish between potential OATP1B1 and BCRP inhibition, 
since rosuvastatin is a substrate of OATP1B1 and BCRP and Coproporphyrin I is a functional marker of OATP1B1 
activity. 
The clinical DDI studies were performed with voxelotor given for 3 days, this is too short to investigate the 
effect of induction. A clinical DDI study with voxelotor as inducer towards CYP2B6 will be performed as PAM. 
The  inhibition  potential  of  voxelotor  towards  UGT1A1,  1A9  and  2B7  is  also  currently  unknown,  but  will  be 
investigated at clinically relevant concentrations as a PAM. 
Effect  of  voxelotor  on  other  medicinal  products  such  as  CYP3A4  substrates,  CYP2B6  substrates,  CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 substrates have been reflected in section 4.5 of the SmPC. In addition, recommendations 
have  also  been  included  with  regards  to  transporter-mediated  drug  interactions  and  concomitant  use  of 
voxelotor  with  digoxin  in  section  4.5  of  the  SmPC.  In  vitro  drug  interactions  and  transporter-mediated 
interactions have also been reflected in section 5.2 of the SmPC.Drug-drug interaction potential with voxelotor 
and OATP1B1, OAT3 and MATE1 substrates, and the drug-drug interaction potential with voxelotor on CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 substrates has been added as missing information in the RMP and the 
applicant will provide the results of the following studies post-marketing:

CYP3A4 in Healthy Subjects;

Pharmacodynamics 
Pharmacodynamic data of voxelotor is based on in vitro studies in human blood and clinical studies in healthy 
volunteers and SCD patients.  
Based on the in vitro study PRC-18-043, with donor blood from healthy or SCD subjects, a model to determine 
haemoglobin modification (%HbMOD) and occupancy by voxelotor was established using oxygen equilibrium 
curves (OEC) and four parameters (p20, ∆p20, p50, ∆p50) describing the change in Hb O2 affinity resulting 
from the binding of voxelotor to Hb. Changes in p20 (∆p20) was identified as the most optimal parameter to

serve as predictor of voxelotor/Hb ratio (% Hb modification- the proportion of Hb molecules modified to a high 
Hb-O2 affinity form by voxelotor) in blood from healthy subjects or from subjects with SCD.  
Based on the clinical pharmacology Study GBT440-001, it was also shown that %HbMOD is directly correlated 
to voxelotor RBC concentration, which is calculated from and correlated to the concentration of voxelotor in 
blood. Also, %HbMOD was found to be directly correlated to percent Hb occupancy, which is calculated as the 
molar  ratio  of  the  voxelotor  concentration  in  RBCs  to  the  estimated  Hb  concentration  (MCHC,  5000  µM)  in 
RBCs.  It  is  not  clear  if  using  the  individual  patient  values  for  Hb  concentration  in  RBCs,  and  not  estimated 
values to calculate Hb occupancy, would have resulted in a different proportion of patients reaching the target 
20%  Hb  occupancy.  However,  as  the  primary  endpoint  was  haemoglobin  response,  this  was  not  further 
pursued.  
Due to this direct correlation between %HbMOD (that is reflective of Hb-O2 affinity) and Hb occupancy, the 
latter was used to approximate the PD effect of increase in oxygen affinity in the further clinical studies.  
The main clinical pharmacology Study GBT440-001 showed a decrease in p50 and p20 (pO2 at which there 
is 50% or 20% saturation of Hb with O2, accordingly) following a single or multiple dose of voxelotor treatment, 
compared to the placebo values. A smaller decrease was observed in p50 compared to p20, which is in line 
with a greater effect of voxelotor (left shift) at lower pO2. The targeted %HbMOD or % Hb occupancy were not 
achieved in this study, where only multiple doses up to 1000 mg were used. Increase in blood O2 saturation 
and a decrease in measured p50 values after voxelotor 1500 mg use following 14 days were also observed in 
another Study GBT440-0111. However, only 3 subjects were assessed in the voxelotor 1500 mg group that 
decrease the reliability of any conclusion. 
In  addition  to  PD  parameters  that  reflect  oxyHb  stabilisation  by  voxelotor,  several  parameters  related  to 
haemolytic anaemia were measured in the Study GBT440-001, such as total Hb levels, indirect bilirubin, % 
reticulocytes and LDH. Overall, the data presented support the potential of voxelotor to reduce haemolysis by 
decreasing  RBC  sickling.  The  increase  in  haemoglobin  values  observed  in  the  voxelotor-treated  subjects 
compared to placebo, was accompanied by a decrease in the markers of haemolysis. Also, a decrease in RBC 
sickling was observed in almost all voxelotor groups.  
Since targeted %HbMOD or % Hb occupancy were not achieved in the Study GBT440-001 and no plateau was 
reached with respect to the effect on haemolysis markers, a PK/PD model was developed to estimate the dose 
of voxelotor by which 30% Hb occupancy can be reached. This dose was estimated to be 1500 mg and was 
further tested in the pivotal Study GBT440-031 (see section 3.3.5 for details). 
As  voxelotor  is  for  the  most  part  present  in  RBCs  and  its  PD  effect  is  located  inside  the  RBCs,  whole  blood 
concentration was chosen as a measure of exposure in the Exposure-Response (ER) analysis from the Phase 
2  (GBT440-007)  and  Phase  3  study  (GBT440-031)  where  the  registration  dose  of  1500  mg  was  tested.  ER 
analysis showed an exposure-dependent effect of voxelotor on Hb and haemolysis markers, such as indirect 
bilirubin, LDH, %reticulocyte and absolute reticulocyte count: change from baseline (CFB) or % CFB was larger 
at  higher  whole  blood  concentrations.  The  relationships  were  consistent  when  adults  and  adolescent  were 
analysed  separately.  When  analysis  was  split  according  to  time  (≤12  weeks,  12  to  24  weeks  and  24  to  72 
weeks), the correlation between blood concentration and Hb effect remained unchanged over time. However, 
for four measures of haemolysis, the relationship with whole blood concentration flattened over time to some 
degree, with the relationship being non-significant for % CFB Absolute Reticulocytes between 24 to 72 weeks. 
The dose of 1500 mg was shown to be more effective compared to the 900 mg, which supports the choice for 
the registration dose of 1500 mg.

A dedicated TQT study in healthy volunteers has been performed to evaluate any possible treatment induced 
QT effect of voxelotor. Although some time points in the Day 4 data may suggest for some QT effect, though 
not formally powered for such an analysis, these observations were not repeated at the Day 14 point results 
at higher concentration levels. Therefore, based on such lack of consistency in the by time analyses and the 
provided powered concentration-QT response analyses, which show no clear relationship, it is reasonable to 
conclude that no relevant QT prolongation effect is to be expected with voxelotor within the therapeutic dose 
range. 
Even though pharmacodynamic interactions were not specifically discussed, the effect of voxelotor on Hb 
levels was shown to be independent on the concomitant HU use.  
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacodynamics of voxelotor is complex. As expected from the mechanism of action, voxelotor leads to 
the increase in Hb affinity for O2, stabilising Hb in the oxygenated state. However, uncertainties remain about 
the consequences this Hb modification has on the ability of voxelotor-bound Hb to release O2 and contribute 
to the tissue oxygenation. This is discussed in the clinical sections (please see discussion in sections 3.2, 3.3.6, 
3.3.9, 5). The pharmacokinetics of voxelotor were sufficiently investigated in healthy volunteers and patients 
with Sickle cell disease. There are some remaining uncertainties regarding drug-drug interactions (voxelotor 
as  victim  and  as  perpetrator)  which  will  be  investigated  in  studies  submitted  as  PAMs  (see  also  RMP  cat  3 
studies). 
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
This application is based on efficacy data obtained from the following studies: 
- 
Pivotal phase 3 study GBT440-031 
-  Ongoing open label extension study GBT440-034 of study GBT440-031  
- 
Phase 2 study GBT440- 007 Part B in paediatric patients 
Please see below for more information. 
2.6.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No formal dose-response study has been performed. The data from phase 1 study GBT440-001 and its open-
label extension (OLE) (GBT440-024) were used for dose determination for the Phase 3 study, supported with 
results from safety, PK, and PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) analyses. 
In the GBT440-001 study, voxelotor treatment resulted in a dose dependent increase in Hb O2 affinity; the 
pharmacodynamic (PD) effect is reflected by a decrease in change in partial pressure of oxygen at which Hb

oxygen saturation of 20% and 50% is achieved (p20 and p50, respectively). Likewise, the related percent Hb 
modification in subjects with SCD increased with increasing voxelotor dose. Exposure response analysis and 
PK/PD modelling of GBT440-001 data demonstrate a highly significant and liner relationship between exposure 
and improvement in haemolysis measures (i.e. at the doses tested, a plateau on improvement in haemolysis 
measures has not been reached). The greatest Hb increase was seen in cohorts (Part C of study GBT440-001) 
dosed for 90 days with 700 mg and 900 mg dose. 
The therapeutic target of 20% to 30% of % Hb occupancy was used to select the doses evaluated in the pivotal 
Phase  3  Study  GBT440  031  (please  see  rationale  for  this  target  in  the  Pharmacodynamics  section).  In  the 
GBT440-001 study, the targeted %Hb occupancy was not achieved with maximum dose tested for >90 days 
being 900 mg. Therefore, modelling and simulation of PK data was used to predict that voxelotor 900 mg and 
1500 mg doses would achieve voxelotor blood concentrations at minimum observed concentration (Cmin) in 
the median subject equivalent to Hb modification of 16% (2.5th–97.5th percentile, 7%–31%) and 26% (2.5th–
97.5th percentile, 12%–52%), respectively. Based on this prediction, 25% of subjects at the 900 mg dose and 
76% of subjects at the 1500 mg dose were predicted to achieve the therapeutic target of > 20% Hb occupancy. 
Also, the effects of 900 mg and 1500 mg dose were predicted by the model (see table 21Error! Reference 
source not found.), where 1500 mg dose of voxelotor was predicted to have a higher efficacy compared to 
the lower 900 mg dose. Based on this modelling, two doses were chosen to be tested in the Phase 3 study – 
900mg and 1500 mg.

2.6.5.2.  Main study(ies) 
Title of study 
Study GBT440-031 was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre 72-week study of subjects 
aged 12 to 65 years with sickle cell disease (SCD), including haemoglobin (Hb) sickle cell disease with 2 sickle

cell  genes  (HbSS),  haemoglobin  sickle  cell  disease  with  1  HbS  sickle  cell  gene  and  1  haemoglobin  C 
gene(HbSC), HbSβ thalassemia, or other sickle cell syndrome variants. 
Methods 
Study Participants 
Key study eligibility criteria (selection): 
•  Male or female, aged 12 to 65 years, inclusive, with documented SCD (HbSS, sickle haemoglobin (S) and 1 
beta zero thalassemia gene [HbSβ0thalassemia], sickle haemoglobin (S) and 1 beta plus thalassemia gene 
[HbSβ+thalassemia], haemoglobin sickle cell disease with 1 HbS sickle cell gene and 1 haemoglobin C [HbC] 
gene [HbSC], or other sickle cell syndrome variants). 
•  Subjects had had at least 1 episode of VOC in the previous 12 months. For study eligibility, VOC was defined 
as a previously documented episode of acute chest syndrome (ACS) or acute painful crisis (for which there 
was no explanation other than VOC) that required prescription or health-care professional–instructed use of 
analgesics for moderate to severe pain (documentation required to exist in the subject medical record prior 
to screening). 
•  Hb ≥ 5.5 and ≤ 10.5 g/dL at screening 
•  For subjects taking HU, the dose of HU was required to be stable for at least 90 days before the subject 
signed the informed consent form, with no anticipated need for dose adjustments or initiation during the 
study, in the opinion of the investigator. 
Key exclusion criteria (selection): 
•  More than 10 VOCs within the past 12 months that required a hospital or emergency room or clinic visit 
•  Subjects  who  received  regularly  scheduled  blood  (RBC)  transfusion  therapy  (also  termed  chronic, 
prophylactic, or preventive transfusion) or had received an RBC transfusion for any reason within 60 days 
of signing the ICF or at any time during the Screening period 
•  Subjects who were hospitalised for sickle cell crisis or other vaso-occlusive event within 14 days prior to 
signing the ICF (ie, a vaso-occlusive event could not take place within 14 days prior to signing of the ICF) 
•  Hepatic dysfunction characterised by alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 4 × upper limit of normal (ULN) 
•  Subjects with clinically significant bacterial, fungal, parasitic, or viral infection that required therapy: 
-  Subjects with acute bacterial infection requiring antibiotic use were to delay Screening/enrollment until the 
course of antibiotic therapy had been completed. 
-  Subjects with known active hepatitis A, B, or C or who were known to be human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV)–positive 
•  Severe renal dysfunction (estimated glomerular filtration rate at the Screening Visit, as calculated by the 
central laboratory, < 30mL/min/1.732 or on chronic dialysis) 
Assessment report  
EMA/102184/2022

•  History of unstable or deteriorating cardiac or pulmonary disease within 6 months prior to consent 
•  Receipt of erythropoietin or other hematopoietic growth factors within 28 days of signing ICF or anticipated 
need for such agents during the study 
Treatments 
The study comprised 3 periods:  
•  Screening (28–35 days),  
• 
• 
Treatment Period (2–72 weeks), and  
End-of-Study Follow-Up Visit at 4 weeks (± 7 days) after the last dose of study drug. 
In the double-blind treatment period the subjects in Groups 1 and 2 were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 
daily doses of voxelotor 900 mg, voxelotor 1500 mg, or matching placebo OD. The 300 mg capsule was used 
at the time the study was initiated; however, the 300 mg tablet formulation became available shortly thereafter. 
Thus, the majority of subjects received only the tablet formulation. Subjects in voxelotor 1500 mg received 5 
×  300-mg  voxelotor  capsule  or  tablet;  subjects  in  voxelotor  900  mg  group  received  3  ×  300-mg  voxelotor 
capsule or tablet and 2 × placebo capsule or tablet; and subjects in the placebo group received 5 × placebo 
capsule or tablet orally. 
Dose could be reduced by 1 tablet in case of study drug-related Grade 2 or higher AEs.  
All approved therapies for SCD were allowed under the protocol; none were withheld. This included pain control, 
HU,  L-glutamine,  and  blood  transfusions.  HU  dose  was  to  be  stable  for  at  least  90  days  before  the  subject 
signed the ICF to avoid confounding the interpretation of the safety and efficacy endpoint in this study. 
Objectives/ endpoints 
The objectives/endpoint of the study are presented below. 
Table 22 Objectives and endpoints of Study GBT440-031 
Primary Objective 
Primary Endpoint 
The  primary  objective  was  to  assess  the 
effect of voxelotor compared with placebo on 
improvement in Hb in adults and adolescents 
with SCD. 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  is  Hb  response  at 
Week 24. 
Hb response was based on the difference between 
the  average  value  of  haemoglobin  levels  at  Week 
20  (Hb20)  and  Week  24  (Hb24)  compared  to 
baseline  haemoglobin  level  (HbB).  A  subject  was 
considered to be an Hb responder if [mean (Hb20, 
Hb24)  –  HbB]  >  1  g/dL.  If  Hb20  or  Hb24  was 
missing, then the calculation used the non-missing 
Hb 
level.  Subjects  were  classified  as  non-
responders if any of the non-responder criteria were

met: Hb assessment was missed at both Week 20 
and  Week  24;  HU  treatment  was  initiated  post-
randomisation  and  prior 
to  Week  24;  RBC

•  Measures  predictive  of  response  to 
voxelotor 
Note: A VOC was defined in the protocol as a composite of acute painful crisis or ACS including the following: 
-  moderate to severe pain lasting at least 2 hours;  
- 
- 
- 
no explanation other than VOC;  
required oral or parenteral opioids, ketorolac, or other analgesics prescribed or directed by a healthcare 
professional;  
required  documentation  in  the  subject  medical  record  that  the  subject  was  seen  or  contacted  the 
physician within 1 business day of the event.  
The event may have taken place in a medical setting (hospital, clinic or emergency room). Priapism and acute 
chest syndrome (ACS) events that met the protocol definition of a VOC event were also counted in the analysis 
of the VOC secondary endpoint. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Subjects  in  Groups  1  and  2  were  randomised  in  a  1:1:1  ratio  to  receive  daily  doses  of  voxelotor  900  mg, 
voxelotor  1500  mg,  or  matching  placebo.  Group  2  subjects  were  randomised  after  enrollment  of  the  62nd 
subject in Group 1. The randomisation was carried out centrally through an IXRSAt the time of randomisation. 
Subjects  were  stratified  for  HU  use  (yes/no),  geographic  region  (North  America,  Europe,  Other),  and  age 
(adolescent, 12 to <18 years, and adults, 18 to 65 years). 
This was a double-blind study. The voxelotor and placebo capsules or tablets were matched for shape, size, 
and colour. All individuals involved in the conduct of the study (ie, site staff and subjects, investigator, contract 
research organisation [CRO] personnel, sponsor personnel) were blinded to randomised treatment assignment. 
Other  sponsor  and  CRO  personnel  could  be  unblinded  as  required  per  regulatory  reporting  requirements  of 
suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs). Also, to facilitate the 2 IAs and the primary analysis 
(based on 24-week data from Groups 1 and 2), certain sponsor representatives and sponsor designees were 
unblinded  to  treatment  assignments  prior  to  and  during  the  data  analysis  (including  the  biostatistics  CRO, 
sponsor biostatistics and programming staff, and external groups for bioanalytical PK/PD). 
Statistical methods 
The sample size for the entire study, including Groups 1, 2 and 3, was estimated to be approximately 370 
participants (up to a maximum of approximately 435 participants, depending on the dose[s] selected for the 
Group 3).  
The primary efficacy measure, Hb, will be evaluated as 2 endpoints in Group 1: as change from Week 12 to 
Baseline; and as a responder endpoint (change from Week 12 to Baseline >1 g/dL).  
Assessment report  
EMA/102184/2022 
Page 88/161 
 
 
 
 
 
For the endpoint of change from Baseline in Hb, power calculations assume a mean treatment effect of 0.8 
g/dL (voxelotor at either dose, minus placebo), the placebo change from Baseline is equal to 0, a per-group 
SD of 0.6 g/dL. With N = 20 participants per arm, the power exceeds 95% of detecting a treatment difference 
between either voxelotor dose versus placebo using a t-test. The assumptions are based on data at Day 90 
from Cohorts 16 and 17 from the GBT440-001 study. For the responder endpoint at Week 12, the voxelotor 
doses will be pooled. Assuming responder proportions of 35% and 5% for pooled voxelotor data (N = 40) and 
placebo (N = 20), the power with Fisher’s exact test at a two-sided alpha = 0.05 is 80%. 
Group 2 is designed to allow continued enrolment between Group 1 and Group 3 while the Group 1 data are 
analysed and until decision is made on voxelotor dose selection for Group 3. Group 2 sample size was estimated 
based on these considerations and no formal statistical assessment was performed. 
Based on the results from Group 1 analysis (62 participants), and a second analysis which included 94 subjects 
from  Group  2  (total of  156  participants)  with  a  minimum  of  24  weeks  of  follow  up,  it  was  decided  that  the 
combination of Group 1 and all Group 2 participants, for a total of 274 randomised subjects, would constitute 
the  basis  for  the  primary  analysis  of  the  study.  For  the  primary  analysis  of  Hb  response  rate  comparing 
voxelotor 1500 mg to placebo, assuming a 10% Hb response rate in placebo, the study with approximately 90 
subjects  per  treatment  group  will  have  >95%  power  to  detect  a  targeted  difference  of  30%,  using  Fisher’s 
exact test with a two-sided alpha of 0.0481. 
Group 3 sample size was to be determined when the voxelotor dose(s) is selected. Eventually, following the 
results of the primary analysis, it was decided that Group 3 would not be recruited.  
Statistical  analysis  plan  (SAP)  version  5  specifies  the  statistical  methods  used  for  analysis  of  data  from 
Groups 1 and 2. SAP version 5 was finalised prior to the unblinding of Group 2b data (data from the patients 
in Group 2 that were not analysed in the second interim analysis). 
All  subjects  who  were  randomised  into  the  study  were  included  in  the  Intent-to-Treat  (ITT)  Population  and 
were  analysed  based  upon  their  randomised  treatment  group.  This  was  the  primary  population  for  efficacy 
analyses.  All  subjects  who  were  randomised  to  a  treatment  group  and  received  at  least  1  dose  of  study 
medication were included in the modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) Population, used as supportive analyses. All 
subjects who received at least 1 dose of study medication were included in the Safety  Population and were 
analysed based upon the study drug received. 
Unless otherwise specified, analyses of data from subjects in Groups 1 and 2 combined were adjusted for the 
randomisation stratification factors. For Group 2b analysis, due to the small sample size, adjustment was made 
for HU use at Baseline only. 
The primary endpoint of Hb response at Week 24 was analysed using an exact Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) 
general association test. The primary analysis of Hb response rate was to compare voxelotor 1500 mg with 
placebo. Hb response was based on the difference between the average value of Hb levels at Week 20 and 
Week  24  compared  to  baseline  Hb  level,  if  one  time  point  was  missing,  the  other  was  used.  If  both  Hb 
assessment were missed, HU treatment was initiated or RBC transfusion due to anaemia was received within 
8 weeks of the Week 24 Hb assessment subjects were classified as a non-responders. Hb assessments after 
RBC transfusion for reasons other than anaemia were imputed using last observation carried forward (LOCF). 
Change from Baseline in Hb or haemolysis measurements over time was analysed using a mixed-effects model 
for  repeated  measures  (MMRM).  A  single  model  was  fit  using  all  available  data  through  Week  72,  including 
fixed-effects terms treatment, visit, treatment by visit interaction, and stratification factors. Baseline Hb was a

covariate. Within-subject variability was modelled using an unstructured covariance matrix. Missing data due 
to early dropout or missed visit were not imputed for this analysis. Data after HU initiation or VOC were set to 
missing and assumed to be missing at random, data after RBC transfusion were imputed using LOCF. 
The number of VOC events was modelled using a negative binomial model with the independent variable of 
treatment  group  and  adjusted  for  the  stratification  factors  used  for  randomisation.  The  mean  cumulative 
function  of  VOC  events  was  presented  using  recurrent-events  analysis  methods.  For  the  rate  of  VOC,  the 
analyses did not make any adjustments due to missing data. 
Kaplan Meier methods were used to summarize time-to-event endpoints, including time to first VOC, time to 
first ACS or pneumonia and time to first RBC transfusion. 
A Lan-DeMets α spending function with the O’Brien-Fleming boundary was used to determine the significance 
level for each interim a primary analysis (significance levels 0.000005, 0.0059 and 0.0481), to maintain an 
overall  2-sided  Type  I  error  rate  of  5%.  A  fixed-sequence  hierarchical  test  procedure  was  used  to  formally 
evaluate  the  voxelotor  1500-mg  and  900-mg  dose  groups  in  comparison  with  placebo.  The  first  hypothesis 
testing was to compare Hb response rate at Week 24 in voxelotor 1500 mg vs placebo. If the null hypothesis 
in  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  was  rejected  at  a  2-sided  significance  level  of  0.0481,  secondary  endpoints 
were tested for voxelotor 1500 mg vs placebo, followed by primary and secondary endpoints for voxelotor 900 
mg vs placebo, until the first nonrejection. 
Subgroups defined by subject age group, sex, race, geographic region, baseline HU use, baseline VOC history, 
and baseline Hb level were analysed to evaluate the internal consistency of the study outcomes. In addition, 
comparability of study cohorts (e.g. Group 1, Group 2a, Groups 1 and 2a, and Group 2b) were assessed.

First Subject First Visit was on 13 December 2016, and between January 2017 and May 2018, a total of 274 
subjects were randomised at 58 study sites across 12 countries (United States, Kenya, Egypt, Great Britain, 
Turkey, Oman, Netherlands, Lebanon, Canada, Jamaica, France, and Italy). Last Subject Last Visit was on 08 
October 2019. 
•  Conduct of the study 
The Study GBT440-031 was to be conducted in 3 groups (see figure below) . Initially, Group 1 was to be used 
to select the dose for Group 3 – confirmatory group, while Group 2 was designed to allow continued enrollment 
between Group 1 and Group 3. The Group 3 and the patients on the selected dose in the Group 2 were to be 
used for the Primary Analysis (, left). Two interim analysis took place: first one to analyse the data from Group 
1 and second to analyse the data from Groups 1+ part of the patients from Group 2 (Group 2a). Following the 
second interim analysis, the latest protocol amendment#4 was implemented that brought substantial changes 
to  the  study  design  and  primary  analysis  (,  right).  The  primary  analysis  was  now  to  be  performed  on  the 
participants from Group 1 and Group 2 (274 subjects in total, including 156 subjects that were used in the 
second interim analysis – Group 2a), with Group 3 not being used in the primary analysis. Also, a number of 
secondary endpoints were changed following protocol amendment #4, including the addition of the CGCI scale 
endpoint.

• 
Baseline data 
• 
In general, demographic and other baseline characteristics, including age, sex, race, genotype, HU 
use, and Hb and haemolysis measures, were similar across treatment groups (Table 24 and Table 25) 
•  The history of SCD-related complications, including overall VOCs, was also generally balanced across

screening was somewhat greater in the voxelotor groups than in the placebo group.

•  Numbers analysed 
The ITT Population, which included all randomised subjects, was the primary analysis population for efficacy 
analyses. Three randomised subjects (Subjects 01-043-001 and 15-001-0002 assigned to the voxelotor 
1500-mg group and Subject 01-006-0005 assigned to the placebo group) did not receive any study drug and 
were excluded from the mITT Population (see table below).

•  Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
Haemoglobin Response at Week 24 
In the ITT Population, 51.1% (46/90) of subjects in the voxelotor 1500mg group and 32.6% (30/92) of subjects 
in the voxelotor- 900-mg group achieved a > 1 g/dL increase in Hb from baseline to Week 24, compared with 
6.5%  (6/92)  of  subjects  in  the  placebo  group.  The difference  in  the  adjusted  response  rate  at  Week 24  for 
voxelotor 1500 mg vs placebo was 45.0% and statistically significant (p < 0.001). For voxelotor 900 mg vs 
placebo, the difference was 26.4% (p < 0.001).

Note: Baseline is the average of all values on or prior to randomisation. Hb assessed within 8 weeks post-RBC transfusion for any reason was 
imputed by the last Hb level prior to the transfusion. Hb response of > 1 g/dL change from baseline was derived based on change from baseline 
to the average of the values for Weeks 20 and 24. Subjects with any of the following scenarios are counted as nonresponders: 1) Hb missing 
at both Weeks 20 and 24; 2) postrandomisation HU use prior to Week 24 for subjects with no HU use at Baseline; 3) received transfusion due 
to anaemia within 8 weeks prior to Week 24 Hb assessment. 
a  Data presented are observed (unadjusted) counts and percentages. 
b  Difference, CI, and p-value are from pairwise comparisons adjusted for baseline HU use, age group, and geographic region. 
c  Statistically significant per pre-specified testing hierarchy. 
More subjects in the voxelotor groups than in the placebo group had an increase in Hb level from baseline at 
Week 24, and the increases in the voxelotor groups were generally larger than those in the placebo group). 
Higher percentages of subjects in the voxelotor 1500 mg and 900 mg groups than in the placebo group achieved 
clinically meaningful Hb levels ≥ 10 g/dL at Week 24 (based on the average of Week 20 and Week 24 values): 
41.1%, 19.6%, and 8.7%, respectively. A lower percentage of subjects in the voxelotor 1500 mg group (4.4% 
[4/90]  of  subjects)  than  in  the  placebo  group  (12.0%  [11/92]  of  subjects)  had  acute  anemic  episodes  (Hb 
decrease from baseline > 2 g/dL) during the study.

Figure 9 Study GBT440-031: Subject-level change from baseline in haemoglobin at week 24 
(per-protocol analysis of observed data) 
Abbreviations: Hb, haemoglobin; HU, hydroxyurea. 
Note: Data displayed are changes in Hb from baseline (average of Screening and Day 1) to the average of Weeks 20 and 24. Subjects with 
missing values at both Weeks 20 and 24 were excluded from the summary. Laboratory results after the earliest of last dose, postrandomisation 
HU initiation for subjects with no HU use at baseline, withdrawal of consent, and end of study were excluded. 
Note: The percentage of subjects with a change from baseline in Hb > 1 g/dL in each treatment group is shown. 
The analysis of the data in the Group1+2a (analysed in the second interim analysis) and Group 2b (analysed 
following interim analysis) was consistent with the primary analysis. 
Secondary and exploratory endpoints 
Hb change from baseline at week 24, 48 and 72 
Hb change from baseline at week 24 was secondary endpoint and Hb change from baseline at week 48 and 72 
was exploratory endpoint.  
On average, an increase from baseline in Hb level was observed for the voxelotor 1500 mg group beginning at 
Week  2  (maximum  increase)  and  the increase  in  Hb  was  maintained  through  24  weeks  (least  squares  [LS] 
mean  [standard  error;  SE]  change  from  baseline  was  1.13  [0.111]  g/dL  at  Week  8  and  at  Week  24)  (CSR 
GBT440 031 Table 14.2.3.1).  
On average, an increase from baseline in Hb level was observed for the voxelotor 1500 mg group beginning at 
Week 2 (maximum increase) and the increase in Hb was maintained through 72 weeks. In the placebo group, 
little to no change from baseline was observed in the average Hb level over time. Differences in the LS mean 
change from baseline in Hb between the voxelotor 1500 mg group and the placebo group were observed at all 
measured time points from Week 2 to Week 72 (all p < 0.001). At Week 24, the LS mean (SE) change from 
baseline was 1.13 (0.132) g/dL in the voxelotor 1500 mg group, 0.58 (0.130) g/dL in the voxelotor 900 mg 
group and 0.10 (0.132) g/dL in the placebo group. At Week 24, the difference between voxelotor 1500 mg and 
placebo was 1.23 g/dL and statistically significant (p < 0.001), and the difference between the voxelotor 900

mg and placebo was 0.68 g/dL (p < 0.001). The difference between the voxelotor 1500 and 900 mg groups at 
Week 24 was 0.55 g/dL (p = 0.003). 
At Week 72, the LS mean (SE) change from baseline (g/dL) was 1.02 (0.149) in the voxelotor 1500 mg group, 
0.54 (0.143) in the voxelotor 900 mg group, and 0.02 (0.148) in the placebo group. The difference between 
voxelotor 1500 mg and placebo was 0.99 g/dL (95% CI: 0.58 to 1.41 g/dL; p < 0.001), and the difference 
between voxelotor 900 mg and placebo was 0.51 g/dL (95% CI: 0.11 to 0.92 g/dL; p = 0.014).

Note: The MMRM model includes treatment, study visit, treatment by visit interaction, baseline HU use, age group, and region as fixed-effects 
terms, and baseline value as a covariate, and uses an unstructured covariance  matrix for within-subject variability. The summary  omitted 
laboratory assessments after postrandomisation initiation of HU (for subjects with no HU use at baseline), withdrawal of consent, and end of 
study. Laboratory assessments within 8 weeks post-RBC transfusion, for any reason, were imputed by the last laboratory value prior to the 
transfusion. 
The analysis of the 24-week data in the Group1+2a (analysed in the second interim analysis) and Group 2b 
(analysed following interim analysis) was consistent with the ITT analysis. 
The annualised IR of acute anaemic episodes was 3-fold lower (0.05 vs 0.15 per person years) with voxelotor 
1500 mg than placebo. 
Change From Baseline in Measures of Haemolysis at Week 24, 48 and 72 
Change in haemolysis markers from baseline at week 24 was secondary endpoint and change in haemolysis 
markers from baseline at week 48 and 72 was exploratory endpoint.

Consistent with the increase from baseline in Hb, dose dependent decreases in clinical measures of haemolysis 
were  observed  with  voxelotor  treatment.  Improvements  in  haemolysis  measures  and  Hb  occurred  within  2 
weeks  of  treatment  initiation.  Following  this  initial  reduction  in  haemolysis  measures,  indirect  bilirubin  and 
reticulocyte percentage demonstrated a durable treatment effect over 72 weeks with the voxelotor 1500 mg 
dose compared to placebo, but not the decrease in LDH or absolute reticulocyte number (Figure 11 and Table 
28).

Annualised Incidence Rate of Vaso-Occlusive Crisis 
In the mITT Population, the total number and annualised IR of on-treatment events of VOC were as follows:  
- 
- 
- 
voxelotor 1500 mg (219 events; adjusted IR of 2.4 events/year),  
voxelotor 900 mg (251 events; adjusted IR of 2.4 events/year), and  
placebo (293 events; adjusted IR of 2.8 events/year).  
The IR of on treatment VOCs was also analysed by subgroups of VOC history prior to study entry. For subjects 
with 1 VOC in the prior year, the adjusted IR of on treatment VOCs was 2.1 events/year in the voxelotor 
1500 mg group, 1.6 events/year in the voxelotor 900 mg group, and 2.2 events/year in the placebo group.  
For subjects with ≥ 2 VOCs in the previous year, the total number of on treatment VOC events were 
numerically fewer for subjects who received voxelotor 1500 mg group (134 events) compared with the 
voxelotor 900 mg group (174 events) and placebo group (197 events). The adjusted IR of on treatment VOCs 
for this subpopulation was 2.5 events/year in the voxelotor 1500 mg group, 3.0 events/year in the voxelotor 
900 mg group, and 3.1 events/year in the placebo group. 
•  Ancillary analyses 
In the pivotal Study GBT440-031, the efficacy of voxelotor based on Hb response at Week 24 was explored 
across subgroups based on age (12 to < 18 years vs 18 to ≤ 65 years), sex, race (Black or African American 
vs Arab or Middle Eastern), geographic region (North America vs Europe vs Other), VOC history (1 episode vs 
≥ 2 episodes within previous 12 months), baseline HU use (yes vs no), and anaemia severity (baseline Hb < 7 
vs ≥ 7 g/dL). 
A consistent treatment benefit with respect to Hb response rate at Week 24 (voxelotor 900 mg and 1500 mg 
vs  placebo)  was  observed  across  all  subgroups  examined  (Figure  12  ,  only  data  for  voxelotor  1500  mg  is 
shown).

The Hb response rate at Week 24 was analysed using an exact Cochran-
Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) general association test. Each voxelotor dose group 
(900 mg or 1500 mg) was compared to placebo while stratifying for the 
randomisation stratification factors of hydroxyurea (HU) use, age group 
(< 18 vs 18 to 65 years old), and geographic region (North America, 
Europe, or Other)

The MMRM model included treatment, study visit, treatment by visit 
interaction, baseline HU use, age group, and geographic region as fixed 
effect terms, and baseline value as a covariate, and used an unstructured 
covariance matrix for within subject variability. All visits through Week 72 
were included in the model. The summary omitted laboratory assessments 
after post-randomisation initiation of HU (for subjects with no HU use at 
baseline), the withdrawal of consent, and the end of study date. Laboratory 
assessments within 8 weeks post–RBC transfusion, for any reason, were 
imputed by the last laboratory value prior to the transfusion.

in  measures  of  haemolysis  at  Week  24”  are  not  presented  in  the  table.  However,  they  can  be  found  in  the 
section 3.3.1 “Results” in the Clinical AR.  
2.6.5.3.  Clinical studies in special populations 
The maximum age of the patients included into the voxelotor clinical programme was 64. Paediatric subjects 
≥12 years of age were included in the pivotal trial, as well as a separate paediatric study GBT440- 007. 
Study GBT440- 007 Part B 
Study GBT440 007 is an ongoing Phase 2a, multicentre, open label study of voxelotor in paediatric subjects 
with SCD. The study is composed of 4 parts; only efficacy data from the multiple dose Part B is discussed here. 
Part B was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of voxelotor and to provide supportive evidence 
of the efficacy of voxelotor 900 or 1500 mg administered QD for 24 weeks in paediatric subjects 12 to < 18 
years old with SCD (HbSS or HbSβ0 thalassemia) and Hb levels ≤ 10.5 g/dL. This part of the study is currently 
completed. 
In total, 25 subjects were involved in the voxelotor 900 mg group and 15 subjects in voxelotor 1500 mg group. 
The median age of participants was 14 years of age, normal weight and, similar to the pivotal GBT440-031 
study, most of the participants were Black or African American, had HbSS genotype and used HU at baseline. 
Around 50% of participants had a history of pain crisis and >60% had a history of ACS. Median baseline Hb 
levels were: 8.9 (6.3, 11.0) in the voxelotor 900 mg group and 8.8 (6.2, 10.6) in the voxelotor 1500 group. 
Reticulocyte  or  indirect  bilirubin  levels  were  not  part  of  the  inclusion  criteria.  However,  all  adolescents  had 
increased reticulocyte % at the time of the enrolment.  
Assessment report  
EMA/102184/2022 
Page 115/161 
 
 
 
 
 
Efficacy  assessments  included  clinical  measures  of  anaemia  (Hb)  and  haemolysis  (reticulocyte  percentage, 
indirect bilirubin, and LDH).  
Consistent with the results of the pivotal study, improvements in Hb were observed as early as Week 2 with 
voxelotor  treatment  and  were  maintained  through  Week  24:  median  change  in  Hb  was  0.7  g/dL  for  both 
treatment  groups.  Concurrent  improvements  in  haemolysis  measures  (reticulocyte  percentage,  indirect 
bilirubin, and LDH) were observed at Week 24: decrease in reticulocyte % at 24 weeks was 17.4% (-35.6, -
36.5), decrease in indirect bilirubin was - 42.8% (-50.5, -15.4), and decrease in LDH was -5.8% (-12.5, 11.7) 
in the voxelotor 1500 mg group. 
2.6.5.4.  Supportive studies 
Study GBT440- 034 (OLE study of pivotal study GBT440-031) 
Study GBT440-034 is an ongoing open-label extension (OLE) study for subjects who completed 72 weeks of 
treatment  in  Study  GBT440-031.  All  subjects  who  enrolled  in  Study  GBT440-034,  regardless  of  treatment 
received in Study GBT440-031 (i.e., voxelotor 1500 mg, voxelotor 900 mg, or placebo), are receiving voxelotor 
1500 mg once daily. 
Long-term efficacy and safety data as of 31 December 2020 from Study GBT440-034 were provided. A total of 
179 subjects were enrolled and 178 subjects have been treated with voxelotor 1500 mg in Study GBT440 034; 
43.8%  (78/178)  of  subjects  have  completed  72  weeks  of  treatment,  and  11.8%  (21/178)  of  subjects  have 
completed 96 weeks of treatment in Study GBT440-034. Of the 78 subjects with ≥ 72 weeks of treatment in 
this study, 52 subjects received up to 72 weeks of treatment with voxelotor previously in the antecedent Study 
GBT440-031 for a cumulative voxelotor treatment duration of ≥ 144 weeks. As of the data cut-off date, 100 
subjects remain ongoing in this study. 
Haemoglobin 
The effect of voxelotor on Hb increase showed durability. For subjects who previously received voxelotor 900 
mg or 1500 mg, the mean Hb level was 9.0 g/dL and 9.5 g/dL, respectively, prior to dosing in Study GBT440-
034. After receiving voxelotor 1500 mg in GBT440-034, the mean change from GBT440-034 baseline was 0.7 
g/dL and 0.2 g/dL, respectively, at Week 48. Subjects who previously received placebo in Study GBT440-031 
had an improvement in Hb over time in Study GBT440-034 compared to baseline: the mean Hb level was 8.8 
g/dL prior to dosing in Study GBT440-034 and the mean change from baseline in Hb was 1.4 g/dL, 0.9 g/dL, 
and 1.3 g/dL at Weeks 12, 24, and 48, respectively. 
Haemolysis markers 
Significant  decrease  in  indirect  bilirubin  levels  observed  in  voxelotor  groups  in  the  main  Study  GBT440-031 
was sustained in the OLE study. Patients who switched from placebo in study GBT440-031 to voxelotor 1500 
mg showed similar decrease in indirect bilirubin levels as patients on voxelotor 1500 mg in the Study GBT440-
031. Thus, the mean percentage change from baseline at 48 weeks in the OLE study was -39.5 (SD, 40.96), -
2.0 (66.13) and 1.1 (85.55) for patients who received placebo, voxelotor 900 mg and voxelotor 1500 mg in 
the Study GBT440-031, respectively. 
The decrease in % reticulocyte observed in the Study GBT440-031 continued to be seen in the OLE study. The 
mean percentage change from baseline at 48 weeks was -28.6 (SD, 55.29), -14.6 (56.25) and -21.0 (81.29) 
Assessment report  
EMA/102184/2022 
Page 116/161 
 
 
 
for  patients  who  received  placebo,  voxelotor  900  mg  and  voxelotor  1500  mg  in  the  Study  GBT440-031, 
respectively. A slight decrease in the absolute reticulocyte number was observed in the OLE study, with the 
decrease being more pronounced in the groups that previously received placebo and voxelotor 900 mg in the 
pivotal study compared to voxelotor 1500 mg. The mean percentage change from baseline at 48 weeks was -
17.4 (SD, 45.33), -17.0 (55.92) and -12.0 (58.12) for patients who received placebo, voxelotor 900 mg and 
voxelotor 1500 mg in the Study GBT440-031, respectively. 
For  LDH,  the  mean  percentage  change  from  baseline  at  48  weeks  was  -4.7  (38.03),  2.0  (26.41)  and  -1.3 
(31.38) for patients who received placebo, voxelotor 900 mg and voxelotor 1500 mg in the Study GBT440-
031, respectively. 
VOC 
In the mITT Population, the total number and annualised IR of on treatment events of VOC were as follows:  
- 
- 
- 
voxelotor 1500 mg (86 events; adjusted IR of 1.1 events/year),  
voxelotor 900 mg (71 events; adjusted IR of 1.0 events/year), and  
placebo (129 events; adjusted IR of 1.7 events/year). 
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The application is based on efficacy data from a single pivotal trial (GBT440-031), an open-label extension of 
the pivotal trial (GBT440-034) and Phase 2a study in paediatric patients (GBT440-007). The data from phase 
1  study  GBT440-001  and  its  open-label  extension  (GBT440-024)  were  used  for  dose  determination  for  the 
Phase 3 study.  
Dose selection. No formal dose-finding study was performed. Instead, the doses for the pivotal study GBT440-
031 of 900 mg and 1500 mg were determined based on the data from phase 1 Study GBT440-001, where the 
maximum  multiple  dose  tested  was  900  mg  (>90  days)  and  1000  mg  (28  days)  QD.  The %  Hb  occupancy 
target of >20% was used for dose selection, as potentially being of significant clinical benefit from reducing 
HbS polymerisation. The rationale for this target is based on the knowledge that in patients with both HbS and 
hereditary persistence of foetal haemoglobin (s/HPFH), the dilution of HbS by the presence of 20% to 30% 
foetal haemoglobin (HbF) in all RBCs suffices to inhibit Hb polymerisation. The increase in Hb and reduction in 
haemolysis markers was seen with 900 mg QD dose. However, the majority of patients did not reach the % 
Hb occupancy target of 20-30% and no plateau was reached with respect to the effect on haemolysis markers 
in SCD patients with the doses tested in the GBT440-001 study. Based on the population pharmacokinetic and 
PK/PD analyses of data from the Phase 1 Study GBT440-001, a prediction was made that with the dose of 1500 
mg the % Hb occupancy target of >20% will be reached for 76% of subjects. Also, the model predicted a larger 
beneficial response on haemolysis markers with 1500 mg dose compared to 900 mg dose. As a result, based 
on this modelling, two doses were chosen to be tested in Phase 3 study – 900mg and 1500 mg. The approach 
used  to  determine  the  doses  for  Phase  3  studies  is  not  considered  optimal,  but  the  model  predictions  with 
respect to %Hb occupancy were confirmed in the pivotal phase 3 trial. The predicted effects of the 1500 mg 
dose  on  haemolysis  markers  (e.g.  -66%  and  -84%  decrease  in  indirect  bilirubin  and  %  reticulocytes, 
respectively), however, were not all achieved in the pivotal trial.

Design and conduct of the main clinical study (GBT440-031) 
Study GBT440-031 was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre study of subjects aged 12 
to 65 years with sickle cell disease (SCD), including haemoglobin (Hb) sickle cell disease with 2 sickle cell genes 
(HbSS), haemoglobin sickle cell disease with 1 HbS sickle cell gene and 1 haemoglobin C gene (HbSC), HbSβ 
thalassemia, or other sickle cell syndrome variants. This study used placebo as a comparator on the background 
of best clinical standard-of-care treatment, including hydroxyurea (HU), which is considered appropriate. The 
dose of HU used needed to be stable before study entry. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive voxelotor 
900  mg,  voxelotor  1500  mg,  or  matching  placebo  QD  on  the  background  of  best  clinical  standard-of-care 
treatment  for  up  to  72  weeks.  Clinical  standard  of  care  included  pain  control,  HU,  L-glutamine,  blood 
transfusions. Subject randomisation was stratified by concomitant hydroxyurea (HU) use, geographic region, 
and age group.  
The  trial  population  is  reflective  of  the  population  with  SCD  and  is  adequate  to  evaluate  the  proposed 
indication. In order to evaluate secondary endpoint – VOC (vaso-occlusive crisis) rates – the study was enriched 
with patients who had at least 1 VOC in the previous 12 months. The required minimum baseline VOC rate is 
considered low to allow the evaluation of beneficial effect of voxelotor on VOC rates. In general, the currently 
proposed  indication  reflects  the  study  population.  However,  several  modifications  to  the  wording  of  the 
indication  were  accepted  in  the  second  round  of  assessment  in  order  to  better  specify  the  origin  of  the 
haemolytic  anaemia  (i.e.  due  to  SCD)  and  to  reflect  that  voxelotor  can  be  used  as  monotherapy  or  in 
combination with hydroxycarbamide. 
Haemolytic anaemia is a hallmark of SCD. Therefore, Hb and haemolysis endpoints are relevant endpoints and 
can support efficacy in the claimed indication. The primary endpoint was the percentage of subjects achieving 
an increase of > 1 g/dL in Hb from baseline to Week 24. The size of the benefit and clinical relevance of this 
increase might depend upon baseline levels and individual tolerance to anaemia. Nevertheless, it can be agreed 
that an increasing in Hb levels > 1g/dL is likely to be relevant. However, uncertainties were raised with respect 
to the anticipated beneficial effects of the Hb increase in patients with SCD, considering the MoA of voxelotor. 
It was not clear if the increase in stabilised Hb (the pharmacodynamic effect that accounts for the observed 
total Hb increase) translates into better tissue oxygenation, since stabilised Hb by voxelotor may release oxygen 
less easily. The duration of 24 weeks treatment used for assessment of the primary endpoint is quite short to 
establish the sustainability of the beneficial effect. However, Hb change from baseline at week 48 and 72 are 
listed as exploratory endpoints to support the primary endpoint. Other secondary endpoints (haemolysis 
markers  and  VOC  rates)  and  exploratory  endpoints  are  all  relevant  to  evaluate  the  clinical  impact  of  the 
observed Hb increase and are supported. As SCD is a chronic disease characterised by chronic pain and end-
organ damage, the inclusion of PROs are of importance.  
Initially, the Study GBT440-031 was designed as a seamless adaptive design trial to investigate and select the 
most effective dose and then confirm it. Therefore, in the original protocol, the study population was divided 
in three groups: Group 1 (60 patients) was to be used to choose a dose for the confirmatory part of the trial 
(Group 3). Group 2 was designed to allow continued enrolment between Group 1 and Group 3. The Group 3 
and the patients on the selected dose in the Group 2, who were not included in the interim analysis, were to 
be used for the Primary Analysis. Two interim analyses took place: first interim analysis to analyse the data 
from Group 1 and second interim analysis to analyse the data from Groups 1+ Group 2a. Following the second 
interim analysis, the latest protocol amendment#4 was implemented that brought substantial changes to 
the study design. The primary analysis is currently performed on the participants from Group 1 and Group 2 
Assessment report

combined (274 subjects in total, including 156 subjects that were used in the second interim analysis), with 
Group 3 not being used at all in the primary analysis. Group 3 was not open for enrolment. The sample size 
for the total study was changed in protocol amendment #4 based on the results of the second interim analysis. 
Since  the  sample  size  adjustment  was  downwards  (from  370  to  274),  was  based  on  interim  data  with  an 
information fraction of 57% and the amendment allowed the interim data to be incorporated in the final dataset 
rather than using patients after the interim to confirm the interim results, this results in an inflation of the type 
I  error  rate.  However,  since  the  primary  endpoint  is  highly  significant  for  both  the  total  population  and  the 
‘confirmatory’ Group 2b, this is not further pursued.  
A number of secondary endpoints were changed following protocol amendment #4, and a new endpoint, CGIC 
(Clinical Global Impression – Improvement scale), was added to the protocol. Introduction of this scale at a 
later time point in the study reduces the reliability of this endpoint. Overall, considering the number and the 
nature of the protocol amendments, as well as their timing in relation to the interim analysis and general study 
timeline, unblinding of certain sponsor members, there was a concern that the changes might have been data-
driven.  Whatsoever  the  primary  Hb  endpoint,  as  well  as  haemolysis  endpoint  are  objective  markers  offer 
sufficient reassurance. However some of the other secondary endpoints are less objective (e.g. CGIC, PRO’s) 
and, therefore, need to be interpreted with caution.  
Analysis sets and the statistical analysis. The definitions of the analysis populations are considered standard 
and acceptable. The analysis model for the primary endpoint, Hb response, uses the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel 
test, adjusting for the randomisation stratification factors, which is considered standard and acceptable. Change 
from  baseline  in  Hb  and  haemolysis  measurements  were  analysed  using  mixed-effects  model  for  repeated 
measures (MMRM) including visit, treatment by visit interaction, baseline and stratification factors. Haemolysis 
measurements were analysed using a similar MMRM model. This can be an acceptable method as well, provided 
missing data is handled appropriately. All analyses were adjusted for the randomisation stratification factors, 
except for the Group 2b analysis, which was only adjusted for baseline HU use due to small sample size. This 
can be considered acceptable, a sensitivity analysis using all stratification factors did not influence the results. 
The incidence rate of VOC events were analysed using a negative binomial model and time to event endpoints 
(VOC,  ACS,  pneumonia  and  RBC  transfusion)  were  analysed  using  Kaplan  Meier.  Both  are  considered 
appropriate. However, the current analysis excludes VOC events after HU initiation, which may be an optimistic 
representation.  Two  sensitivity  analyses  were  performed  to  test  whether  omitting  data  after  HU  initiation 
introduced bias: a treatment policy analysis using all data; and a time to VOC analysis with HU initiation as 
event rather than censored. These analyses did not show any impact of handling HU initiators on the primary 
VOC analysis. 
Hb response was based on the difference between the average two post-baseline levels (week 20 and 24) and 
baseline. If there was missing data for one of the postbaseline levels, the other level was used, if both were 
missing,  the  patient  was  considered  a  non-responder.  Data  collected  after  non-anaemia  related  transfusion 
was set to missing and imputed using LOCF. These are conservative approaches and are considered acceptable. 
Non-response was also imputed after HU initiation or recent anaemia-related RBC transfusion (8 weeks). Since 
these two intercurrent events can be seen as treatment failure, non-response imputation is adequate. Several 
sensitivity analyses were performed: using the mITT population; and imputation after recent transfusion was 
repeated using 12 weeks instead of 8 as definition of ‘recent’. 
For  change  from  baseline  in  haemolysis  measurements,  missing  data  after  study  discontinuation  or  VOC 
hospitalisation or data set to missing after HU initiation were all considered missing at random and handled by

the MMRM model. Since discontinuation, VOC and HU initiation are likely treatment related, it is not considered 
adequate to consider the data afterwards to be missing at random. Measurements after RBC transfusion were 
imputed  using  LOCF.  Similar  sensitivity  analyses  were  performed  as  for  the  primary  endpoint,  additionally, 
LOCF  imputation  was  used  after  VOC  instead  of  assuming  missing  at  random.  Furthermore,  a  sensitivity 
analysis testing the missing data assumption by using a pattern mixture model was performed, using placebo-
based imputation after HU initiation, RBC transfusion or study discontinuation. The results differed slightly but 
the conclusions remain the same, showing that the primary analysis was reasonably robust to the missing data 
handling. 
Multiplicity  due  to  the  two  interim  analyses  was  handled  by  a  Lan-DeMets  alpha  spending  function  using 
O’Brien-Fleming boundaries. Subsequent multiplicity during the final analysis, due to two doses and primary 
and  secondary  endpoints,  was  handled  by  a  hierarchical  testing  procedure.  Technically,  this  could  provide 
protection of the type I error rate. However, in this case, type I error rate is not protected, since the multiplicity 
procedure was informed by, and protocolised after, the interim analyses, the population for the interim analyses 
was part of the final analysis population, and the ordering of the secondary endpoints was changed after the 
interim analysis. Therefore, no p-values for the secondary endpoints, suggesting statistical significance, should 
be mentioned in the product information. 
Since  the primary  endpoint  was  not  amended  after  the  interim  analysis,  this  can  still be  reported  with  a  p-
value. Although there may have been type I error inflation for this endpoint as well, due to the changes in the 
primary analysis population after the interim, this endpoint is highly significant and the interim analysis was 
confirmed in Group 2b. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The  baseline  characteristics  of  the  patients  in  the  placebo  and  voxelotor  groups  were  in  general  well 
balanced. 
With regard to the primary efficacy endpoint, more subjects treated with voxelotor 1500mg and voxelotor 
900mg had an increase in Hb levels >1 g/dL compared to placebo: 51.1%, 32.6% and 6.5% respectively. The 
response  rate  was  similar  in  subjects  who  were  or  were  not  receiving  HU  concurrently.  The  treatment  with 
voxelotor resulted in a fast (within 2 weeks), statistically significant and sustained (up to 72 weeks) increase 
in Hb levels when compared to baseline levels, as well as to placebo, with 1500 mg dose being more effective 
compared to 900 mg dose, resulting in the LS mean change in Hb from baseline at 72 weeks of 1.02 g/dL (CI 
0.72,  1.31).  The  observed  Hb  effects  were  consistent  in  the  Group1+2a  (that  was  analysed  in  the  second 
interim analysis) and Group 2b (that was analysed following interim analysis), which is important considering 
the amendments in the protocol. However, it is not clear to what extent the observed increase in Hb translates 
into  better  tissue  oxygenation,  as  difficulties  in  offloading  O2  in  tissue  capillaries  is  seen  as  competing 
phenomena  that  may  potentially  cancel  part  of  a  beneficial  effect  of  voxelotor.  These  concerns  are  also 
strengthened by the in vitro and animal studies. However, the annualised incidence rate of acute anaemic 
episodes was 3-fold lower (0.05 vs 0.15 per person years) with voxelotor 1500 mg than placebo. 
Further, voxelotor treatment resulted in a rapid decrease in all the haemolysis markers (indirect bilirubin, LDH, 
reticulocyte % and in absolute numbers) in the initial treatment phase, with the magnitude of the decrease 
being  different  for  every  marker,  and  indirect  bilirubin  levels  decreasing  the  most.  This  initially  observed 
decrease attenuated somewhat over time, achieving a new balance, with the decrease in indirect bilirubin and 
Assessment report

slight decrease in % reticulocyte still being significant at 72 weeks. This is expected as indirect bilirubin most 
directly 121nalyzing121zes haemolysis state, while regulation of other parameters, i.e. reticulocytes, is known 
to  be  complex  and  affected  by  various  factors,  including  persistent  hypoxia.  Long-term  clinical  benefits  of 
voxelotor are yet unclear, as the studies of voxelotor were of short duration and small in size.  
The pivotal study was not powered to detect the effect of the treatment on the VOC rate and also, about 40% 
of subjects enrolled in the study had a history of only 1 VOC in the previous 12 months, making the detection 
of the beneficial effect on VOC incidence more difficult. The percent of subjects without any VOC occurrence on 
study and VOC rates were comparable between groups. When analyzing subjects with higher baseline annual 
VOC rate ( ≥ 2 VOCs), a trend of improvement was observed for subjects who received voxelotor 1500 mg 
group (134 events) compared to placebo group (197 events).  
No effect of the treatment was observed between groups on the endpoints that reflect disease burden and 
patient wellbeing: RBC transfusions, concomitant opioid use or PROs. PRO’s baseline scores indicate that the 
majority of the patients on the study had relatively little limitations, which hampers to detect improvement in 
these  endpoints.  The  results  of  the  CGIC  scale  showed  improvement  on  voxelotor  treatment.  However,  the 
introduction of this subjective endpoint to the study only after amendment #4 reduces the interpretability of 
the results. The improvement in leg ulceration was noted upon voxelotor treatment. However, the numbers 
are very low, and the data needs to be interpreted with caution. 
The subgroup analysis performed for the primary endpoint of Hb increase showed consistency in the efficacy 
of voxelotor between different groups. Age, race, region, gender, baseline Hb levels or baseline HU use did not 
have an influence on the voxelotor efficacy based on the 24- and 72-week analysis. No patients >65 years of 
age were included in the study. An appropriate warning is included in section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
The cut-off date of the ongoing extension study of GBT440-031 – OLE GBT440-034 –  is 31 December 2020. 
The data available so far on haemoglobin, haemolysis markers and VOC rates from the OLE GBT440-034 study 
show durability of the effects that were observed in the main GBT440-031 study for patients who were treated 
with  voxelotor.  For  patients  who  switched  from  placebo  to  voxelotor,  positive  trends  were  observed  in 
haematological parameters, as well as VOC, similar to the pivotal study.  
The dose of 1500 mg was shown to be more effective compared to 900 mg dose based on the primary Hb 
endpoint and decrease in indirect bilirubin. Therefore, the choice of this dose to be marketed is supported. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
The data from the supportive paediatric study GBT440-007 in patients 12 to < 18 years of age is consistent 
with the results of the pivotal phase 3 trial GMT440-031 and can be considered supportive.  
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy of voxelotor is shown to be superior to placebo in terms of increase in Hb levels and decrease in the 
haemolysis  markers  –  indirect  bilirubin  and %  reticulocytes.  However,  the  extent  to  which  this  Hb  increase 
contributes to better tissue oxygenation is difficult to estimate given the potential difficulty in oxygen offloading

from voxelotor-bound Hb. Long-term clinical benefits of voxelotor were not investigated, as the studies with 
voxelotor were of short duration and small in size. The decrease in haemolysis and positive trend in the VOC 
incidence are, however, acknowledged and considered of clinical relevance for the applied target population. 
Further data are expected from the ongoing open label extension study.  
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
The mean safety data is based on a single Phase 3 Study GBT440-031, a randomised, placebo controlled, 
double blind 72-week study in adults and paediatric subjects 12 to < 18 years of age, with the safety profile 
in paediatric subjects 12 to < 18 years of age supported by data from the open-label Phase 2a Study GBT440-
007 Part B. Interim data are also available from Study GBT440-034, the ongoing long-term extension (OLE) of 
Study GBT440-031 (cumulative voxelotor exposure for in total ≥ 144 weeks).

Data cutoff date for Study GBT440-034 is 31 December 2020 and for Study GBT440-037 is 01 October 2020. For subjects who were treated 
in both Study GBT440-031 and the open-label extension Study GBT440-034, duration of exposure  is based on first day of treatment with 
voxelotor in Study GBT440 031 (or Study GBT440-034 for subjects who received placebo in Study GBT440-031) and last day of exposure in 
Study GBT440-034. 
2.6.8.2.  Adverse events 
For Studies GBT440-031, GBT440-034, and GBT440-007, all treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were 
summarised separately by non SCD–related TEAEs and SCD related TEAEs to minimise confounding of the 
overall safety profile of voxelotor by underlying SCD comorbidities.  
SCD-related  TEAEs  include  the  following  SCD  morbidities  and  complications:  sickle  cell  anaemia  with  crisis, 
ACS,  pneumonia,  priapism,  and  osteonecrosis  (pneumonia  was  included  because  of  the  difficulty  in 
distinguishing the diagnosis from ACS). 
The overall incidence of TEAEs, distribution of severity of TEAEs, and incidence of serious TEAEs were similar 
between  the  voxelotor  treatment  groups  and  the  placebo  group.  The  majority  of  TEAEs  were  related to  the 
underlying SCD disease. Long-term dosing with voxelotor (≤ 144 weeks cumulative exposure beyond Study 
GBT440-031) in Study GBT440-034 show that the incidence and pattern of non-SCD-related and SCD-related 
TEAEs in adults and paediatric subjects 12 to < 18 years of age are generally consistent with those reported in 
Study GBT440-031. 
Non-SCD–Related Adverse Events 
Most  of  the  subjects  in  the  study  experienced  at  least  1  non-SCD-related  AE:  90.1%  in  the  placebo  group, 
93.5%  in  the  voxelotor  900mg  group  and  96.6%  in  the  voxelotor  1500  mg  group.  Of  these,  26.4%  in  the 
placebo group, 32.6% in the voxelotor 900 mg group and 39.8% in the voxelotor 1500 mg group were assessed

as related to the study drug. Number of subjects with any serious non-SCD-related TEAEs ranged between 22-
28%. More serious non-SCD-related TEAEs were assessed as related to the study drug or led to discontinuation 
in voxelotor groups compared to placebo (see table below).

Common non-SCD–related TEAEs 
Non-SCD–related TEAEs that occurred in ≥ 10% of subjects in any treatment group are summarised by PT in 
table below.  
Gastrointestinal  Disorders was  the  most  commonly  reported  SOC  in  each treatment  group:  62.5%  (55/88), 
59.8% (55/92), and 54.9% (50/91) of the subjects in the voxelotor 1500-mg, voxelotor 900-mg, and placebo 
groups, respectively. 
Incidence of Nervous System Disorders SOC was higher in the voxelotor 1500 mg (40.9% [36/88 subjects]) 
and  placebo  (35.2%  [32/91  subjects])  groups  and  lower  in  the  voxelotor  900-mg  group  (30.4%  [28/92 
subjects]).  
Events in the Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders SOC occurred in similar proportions of subjects 
in the voxelotor 1500-mg group (28.4% [25/88 subjects]) and placebo group (30.8% [28/91 subjects]), but 
were lower in the voxelotor 900-mg group (20.7% [19/92 subjects]). 
Incidences of Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders SOC were similar in the voxelotor 1500-mg treatment 
group  (27.3%  [24/88]  subjects]),  the  voxelotor  900-mg  group  (23.9%  [22/92  subjects]),  and  the  placebo 
group (24.2% [22/91 subjects]).

The  overall  incidence  of  treatment-related  non-SCD–related  TEAEs  was  higher  in  the  voxelotor  treatment 
groups  than  in  the  placebo  group.  The  dose-response  relationship  was  driven  primarily  by  the  incidence  of 
diarrhoea and abdominal pain.

SCD-Related Adverse Events 
A brief summary of SCD-related TEAEs is provided in table below  
Similar number of subjects in every group experienced at least one SCD-related AE in the GBT440-031 study 
(75-  80%).  The  majority  of  SCD-related  TEAEs  in  each  treatment  group  were  Grade  ≤  3.  The  number  of 
subjects who experienced severe SCD-related AEs was high but similar across the groups (52%). However, in 
somewhat higher number of subjects in the voxelotor 1500 mg group (4.5%) SCD-related SAE was attributed 
to the study drug compared to placebo or voxelotor 900 mg group (1.1% each).

SCD-related TEAEs are summarised in Error! Reference source not found.  
The majority of SCD-related TEAEs were sickle cell anaemia with crisis. The incidence of sickle cell anaemia 
with crisis was evenly balanced across groups, and its occurrence was widely distributed throughout the study. 
ACS events occurred less frequently than acute painful crisis events, with a higher number of events in the 
voxelotor groups than in the placebo group: voxelotor 1500 mg (13.6% [12/88 subjects]), voxelotor 900 mg 
(8.7% [8/92 subjects]), and placebo (6.6% [6/91 subjects]). Priapism occurred infrequently in the study, with 
a total of 11 subjects experiencing at least 1 event. There was an imbalance in events, numerically higher in 
the voxelotor groups, that did not appear to be dose-related: 4 subjects in the voxelotor 1500-mg group, 6 
subjects in the voxelotor 900-mg group, and 1 subject in the placebo group.

The majority of SCD-related AEs were considered by the investigator to be related to underlying SCD. The 
incidence of TEAEs that were considered by the investigator to be related to study drug was low and similar 
across treatment groups (3.3% to 5.7%). Of the 13 subjects with events related to study drug, 12 subjects 
had sickle cell anaemia with crisis and 1 subject had priapism. 
Adverse Events by Organ System or Syndrome: 
Among  the  common  non-SCD–related  TEAEs  in  the  pivotal  study,  gastrointestinal  disorders  (ie,  diarrhoea, 
nausea, and abdominal pain) and rash (grouped PTs) both occurred with greater frequency at the voxelotor 
1500-mg dose than with placebo and demonstrated a dose response. Arthralgia was also a common non-SCD–
related  TEAE  but  demonstrated  a  minimal  dose  response,  and  exposure-response  analysis  showed  no 
relationship  to  exposure.  Furthermore,  drug  hypersensitivity,  while  infrequently  observed  (2  events)  in  the 
voxelotor clinical programme, is discussed due to the potential seriousness of this TEAE. 
Analysis of Gastrointestinal Events 
In the pivotal Phase 3 Study GBT440-031, the most frequently reported TEAEs in the Gastrointestinal Disorders 
SOC were diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, with both diarrhoea and nausea showing a dose-
dependent effect. Diarrhoea was the most common and was reported in 22.7%, 18.5%, and 11.0% of subjects 
in the voxelotor 1500-mg, voxelotor 900-mg, and placebo groups, respectively.  
Data from the open-label extension Study GBT440-034 indicated that with long term voxelotor treatment (> 
72 weeks), the incidence of diarrhoea did not increase. Gastrointestinal SAEs were infrequent and did not result 
in study drug discontinuation. The majority of reported gastrointestinal events have been Grade 1 or 2 self-
Assessment report

limiting  and  clinically  manageable  without  the  need  for  dose  interruption  or  reduction  or  treatment 
discontinuation. No events of bloody diarrhoea or fatty stools, or associated complications such as dehydration 
were reported. 
Analysis of Rash Events 
In  the  pivotal  Phase  3  study,  rash  was  reported  in  14.8%,  14.1%,  and  11.0%  of  subjects  in  the  voxelotor 
1500-mg, 900-mg, and placebo groups, respectively. This was similar to the incidence reported in paediatric 
subjects in Study GBT440-007 (13.3% in the 1500-mg group and 8.0% in the 900-mg group); similar or lower 
rates of rash were reported in healthy subjects and subjects with IPF. Additionally, rash was reported in 2.2% 
(4/178) of subjects in the OLE Study GBT440-034, including 2.6% (3/116) of subjects who were previously 
treated with voxelotor for up to 72 weeks in Study GBT440-031. With long term voxelotor treatment (> 72 
weeks), the incidence of rash did not increase. 
In the analysis of paediatric subjects, 2 subjects treated with placebo in Study GBT440-031 and 2 subjects in 
each voxelotor treatment group in Study GBT440-007 reported events of rash. None of the events resulted in 
discontinuation  of  study  drug.  One  of  the  events  (Grade  3  urticaria;  voxelotor  900  mg)  resulted  in  dose 
modifications, with dose escalation back to 900 mg with no reoccurrence. 
Serious TEAEs of rash were infrequent and rarely resulted in study drug discontinuation in the SCD population. 
The majority of rash events were similar in appearance (consistent with typical maculopapular drug eruptions) 
and distribution, were not associated with extradermal concurrent TEAEs such as pyrexia and arthralgia, and 
were manageable with or without treatment including oral antihistamines or topical corticosteroids.  
Although rash appears to be drug related, exposure-response analysis did not reveal a statistically significant 
dose- or exposure-response relationship. No events of Stevens-Johnson syndrome were reported. 
Analysis of Hypersensitivity 
Across all studies in the voxelotor clinical development programme to date, 2 TEAEs of drug hypersensitivity in 
adult patients were assessed by the investigator as related to voxelotor have occurred: 1 subject with SCD in 
Study GBT440-031 and 1 subject with IPF in Study GBT440-006.  
Both subjects were receiving voxelotor 1500 mg. The event of drug hypersensitivity in the subject with SCD 
was reported as an SAE and evaluated as Grade 3 in severity. The event in the subject with IPF was reported 
as a nonserious AE and evaluated as Grade 2 in severity. The observed symptoms in the 2 subjects included 
generalised  morbilliform  rash,  urticaria,  mild  shortness  of  breath,  mild  facial swelling,  fever,  headache,  and 
diarrhoea.  Elevated  eosinophils  were  also  noted  for  both  subjects.  Symptoms  abated  after  study  drug  was 
withheld; and recurrence was observed after reintroduction of voxelotor despite 2 dose reductions in the SCD 
subject. Subjects received oral antihistamine and/or oral steroid treatment to resolve observed events.  
Treatment exposure to time of event onset varied in these 2 subjects, occurring on Study Day 40 for the subject 
with SCD and Study Day 10 for the subject with IPF. Confounding factors in both subjects included the use of 
other medications with known risk of drug hypersensitivity reactions (platelet-rich plasma for hair growth in 
the subject with SCD and anti-fibrotics for the subject with IPF). 
In summary, the occurrence of serious drug hypersensitivity is uncommon (2/819 [0.24%] voxelotor-treated 
subjects)  and  reversible  after  discontinuation  of  study  drug  and  symptomatic  treatment.  No  events  of 
anaphylaxis  or  anaphylactoid  reactions  have  been  reported  across  the  voxelotor  clinical  development 
programme.

Analysis of Vaso-Occlusive Crisis Following Study Drug Discontinuation (28-day follow-up) 
There was a numerically higher incidence of VOCs in the voxelotor arm compared with placebo after treatment 
discontinuation: IR: 0.365 (95% CI: 0.158, 0.720), 0.184 (95% CI: 0.050, 0.470), and 0.455 (95% CI: 0.218, 
0.836) events/28-days for the placebo, voxelotor 900 mg, and voxelotor 1500 mg groups, respectively. 
Analysis of Acute Chest Syndrome and Pneumonia 
While  the  overall  baseline  (in  the  12  months  prior  to  study  entry)  incidence  of  VOC  was  balanced  between 
treatment groups, the placebo group had a lower percentage of subjects at baseline with a history of ACS (prior 
12 months; 3.3% [3/92 subjects] compared with 10.9% [10/92 subjects] and 11.1% [10/90 subjects] in the 
voxelotor 900-mg and 1500-mg groups, respectively). 
Although the incidence of on-treatment sickle cell anaemia with crisis was observed to be evenly distributed 
across treatment groups, there was an imbalance in ACS incidence across treatment groups: 13.6% (12/88 
subjects),  8.7%  (8/92  subjects),  and  6.6%  (6/91  subjects)  in  the  voxelotor  1500-mg,  voxelotor  900-mg, 
placebo  groups,  respectively.  When  combined  with  pneumonia  events,  the  incidences  were  18.2%  (16/88 
subjects), 16.3% (15/92 subjects), and 14.3% (13/91 subjects) in the voxelotor 1500-mg, voxelotor 900 mg, 
and placebo groups, respectively, with a difference of 3 subjects between voxelotor 1500-mg and placebo. 
ACS and pneumonia events as reported were also assessed within subject subgroups as defined by baseline 
ACS status (with or without ACS episodes in the 12 months prior to study entry). This analysis showed that 
across treatment groups, subjects with similar matched baseline ACS histories had similar ACS incidence during 
the  treatment  period.  Additionally,  an  exposure  safety  analysis  of  ACS  as  a  function  of  %  haemoglobin 
occupancy was performed. No statistically significant exposure-response relationship was observed between 
voxelotor PK exposure and the incidence of ACS (GBT-CP-006). 
In Study GBT440-034 (OLE), 7.3% (13/178) of subjects experienced events of ACS or pneumonia. Seven of 
the  13  subjects  had  a  history  of  ACS  at  any  point  prior  to  entry  into  the  parent  Study  GBT440-031.  These 
events  were  assessed  by  the  investigator  as  not  related  to  voxelotor.  Although  Study  GBT440-007  Part  B 
(paediatric  study)  was  not  placebo  controlled,  it  is  notable  that  ACS  events  on  study  showed  an  inverse 
treatment relationship with a 6.7% incidence at the 1500-mg dose and a 12.0% incidence at the 900-mg dose 
of voxelotor. 
Overall,  the  applicant  assesses  the  events  of  ACS  as  not  related  to  voxelotor  but  related  to  complications 
associated with SCD. 
Analysis of Priapism 
Overall,  priapism  occurred  infrequently  in  Study  GBT440-031;  a  total  of  11  subjects  experienced  at  least  1 
event during the treatment period, with no apparent dose-dependent effect. Overall, there was an imbalance 
in  reported  events  of  priapism  between  treatment  groups  in  Study  GBT440-031,  with  an  incidence  of  4/31 
(12.9%), 6/41 (14.6%), and 1/42 (2.4%) in the voxelotor 1500-mg, voxelotor 900-mg, and placebo groups, 
respectively. The imbalance in Study GBT440-031 was assessed as not likely due to a treatment effect for the 
following reasons: 
•  Overall,  there  was  a  small  number  of  subjects  with  priapism  events  and  a  small  absolute  difference  (3 
subjects) between the voxelotor 1500-mg and placebo groups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/102184/2022 
Page 131/161 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Most  subjects  with  priapism  on  treatment  also  had  a  history  of  priapism  (8/11  subjects);  therefore, 
recurrent events were not unexpected in these subjects. More subjects had a history of priapism in the 
voxelotor treatment groups; this may have contributed to the observed imbalance in the treatment period. 
In  Study  GBT440-031,  there  were  slightly  more  male  subjects  with  a  prior  history  of  priapism  in  the 
voxelotor  1500-mg  and  900  mg  groups  than  in  the  placebo  group:  8/32  (25.0%),  10/41  (24.4%),  and 
7/42 (16.7%), respectively. 
•  There was a lack of a dose-dependent effect, with lower incidence in the voxelotor 1500-mg group than in 
the  voxelotor  900-mg  group  and  minimally  higher  incidence  in  the  1500-mg  group  than  in  the  placebo 
group. 
In Study GBT440-007 Part B, 3/19 male paediatric subjects reported priapism: 2 in the voxelotor 1500-mg 
group and 1 in the voxelotor 900-mg group. One subject in the voxelotor 1500-mg group had a prior history 
of priapism. This is similar to the incidence observed in paediatric subjects enrolled in Study GBT440-031.  
In Study GBT440-034, 7 adult subjects experienced priapism. Five of the 7 subjects had a history of priapism 
prior to enrollment into Study GBT440-031, of which 4 also experienced priapism during the treatment period 
in Study GBT440-031. 
The  applicant  assessed  the  events  of  priapism  as  not  related  to  voxelotor  but  related  to  a  complication 
associated with SCD. 
Analysis of Assessments Related to Tissue Oxygen Availability 
With voxelotor, there is a theoretical risk that at a high enough percentage of Hb occupancy, offloading of O2 
from  voxelotor-bound  Hb  in  the  tissues  could  be  decreased.  If  present,  a  clinically  relevant  decrease  in  O2 
offloading could lead to end organ tissue hypoxic stress and dysfunction. 
Overall,  no  clinical  safety  concerns  consistent  with  inadequate  tissue  oxygenation  were  identified  in  the 
voxelotor clinical development programme, including in subjects with SCD. To further assess the potential for 
reduced  O2  offloading  from  voxelotor-bound  Hb,  maximal  exercise  physiology  tests  were  performed  and 
hematologic measures to assess for compensatory erythropoiesis (erythropoietin and reticulocyte counts) in 
SCD studies were studied. 
Maximal exercise testing 
In Study GBT440-0111 in healthy subjects receiving voxelotor 900 mg (8 subjects) or 1500 mg (6 subjects) 
QD  for  14  days,  maximal  exercise  was  performed  under  the  hypoxic  (12.5%  O2)  and  normoxic  conditions. 
Three  subjects  from  the  1500-mg  cohort  discontinued  from  the  study,  2  due  to  TEAEs  assessed  as 
possibly/probably  related  to  voxelotor  and  one  subject  was  withdrawn  at  the  discretion  of  the  investigator. 
Maximal exercise tests were performed on Days 1 and 15 under. The effects of voxelotor on end-organ function 
were measured, comparing subjects to their baseline (off voxelotor). No detrimental effects of voxelotor were 
seen  on  clinically  relevant  physiologic  parameters  that  would  indicate  hypoxic  tissue  stress  (eg,  vital  signs, 
cardiac output, lactate, exercise capacity, dyspnea and perceived exertion, mental status).  
Maximal  exercise  testing  in  SCD  patients  in  Study  GBT440-001  showed  similar  results  when  voxelotor  was 
administered for up to 90 days, with no impairment in workload or tissue oxygen consumption.  
Erythropoiesis  
Assessment report  
EMA/102184/2022 
Page 132/161 
 
 
 
No evidence of a compensatory erythropoietic response was seen in Study GBT440 031: erythropoietin did not 
increase,  and  reticulocytes  decreased.  No  correlation  was  observed  between  the  model-predicted  %  Hb 
occupancy at steady-state Cmax and percent change from baseline (%CFB) erythropoietin at Week 72. As in 
Study  GBT440-031,  no  relationship  between  erythropoietin  levels  and  exposure  was  observed  in  Study 
GBT440-007.  
%Hb occupancy over time 
The median %Hb occupancy after the administration of voxelotor 1500 mg in subjects with SCD reaches the 
20% to 30% target occupancy quickly within the first weeks of treatment and is subsequently stable for the 
entire treatment period. Results indicate that the time spent above 30% Hb occupancy represents 34% of total 
treatment duration. The upper limits of the 95% confidence intervals stay below 50% for both dose levels. The 
data are consistent between Studies GBT440007 and GBT440-031.  
At  a  dose  of  1500  mg  voxelotor  daily,  the  maximum  Hb%  occupancy  is  on  average  37.9%  and  38.1%  for 
Studies GBT440-007 and GBT440-031, respectively. Values of 60% and above were reached in 1 subject in 
Study GBT440-007 and 3 subjects in Study GBT440-031. 
The table below provides an overview of the number of subjects with SCD who exceeded %Hb occupancy levels 
of 30%, 40%, and 50% in Studies GBT440-007 and GBT440-031 after administration of 1500 mg voxelotor. 
Out of 96 subjects overall, 79, 38, and 10 subjects exceeded the %Hb occupancy level of 30%, 40%, and 50% 
at  least  once,  respectively.  For  subjects  who  exceeded  the  %Hb  occupancy  level,  the  time  above  the  %Hb 
occupancy  of  30%  and  40%  was  on  average  33%  to  37%  and  15%  to  20%  of  the  treatment  duration, 
respectively, depending on the study. For the 2 subjects in Study GBT440-007 who had %Hb occupancy levels 
above 50%, the average time above that level was 3.7% of the treatment duration, and for the 8 subjects in 
Study GBT440-031 who had %Hb occupancy levels above 50%, the average time above that threshold was 
15%.

Review of AEs in subjects with %HB occupancy > 30% targeted Hb occupancy 
The AE safety profile of subjects whose %Hb occupancy profile at Cmax exceeded the levels of > 30, > 40, 
and > 50% was assessed. Overall, the AE profile in subjects whose %Hb occupancy level at Cmax exceeded 
levels of > 30, > 40 and > 50% were either consistent with the known safety profile of voxelotor (e.g. headache, 
pyrexia, gastrointestinal disorders, and fatigue); or the AEs were expected in a subject with underlying SCD 
(e.g.  sickle  cell  anaemia  with  crisis,  infectious  AEs,  pain,  priapism,  arthralgia,  and  acute  chest 
syndrome/pneumonia).  Also,  these  findings  were  consistent  among  subjects  with  the  longest  time  spent  at 
%Hb occupancy levels of > 30%, > 40%, or > 50%. In addition, none of the AEs were suggestive of having 
an underlying aetiology of tissue hypoxia.

Non-SCD–related SAEs in the Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders SOC were more common in the 
voxelotor 1500-mg group (6.8% [6/88 subjects]) than in the voxelotor 900-mg group (0.0%) or the placebo 
group  (2.2%  [2/91  subjects]).  In  the  voxelotor  1500-mg  group,  these  events  included  pleural  effusion  and 
pulmonary  embolism  (in  2  subjects  each)  and  acute  respiratory  failure  and  respiratory  failure  (in  1  subject 
each).  
In the Gastrointestinal Disorders SOC, SAEs included nausea (1.1% [1/88 subjects]) in the voxelotor 1500-mg 
group, gastritis (2.2% [2/92 subjects]), diarrhoea (1.1% [1/92 subjects]), and gastritis haemorrhagic (1.1% 
[1/92 subjects]) in the voxelotor 900-mg group, and odynophagia (painful swallowing) (1.1% [1/92 subject]) 
in the placebo group.  
Six  subjects  had  a  total  of  7  Grade  4  treatment  emergent  SAEs  (1  subject  in  voxelotor  1500  mg  group,  2 
subjects in the voxelotor 900 mg and 3 subjects in the placebo group. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (voxelotor 900-
mg group) was the only one of these events considered by the investigator as related to study drug; this event 
also led to discontinuation of study drug. Anaemia (voxelotor 900-mg group) and respiratory failure (voxelotor 
1500-mg group) also led to discontinuation of study drug.

SCD-Related Serious Adverse Events 
SCD-related SAEs are summarised in the Table below. 
Overall, the incidence of  SCD-related SAEs was similar across treatment groups and ranged from 52.2% to 
52.7%. Sickle cell anaemia with crisis was the most common SAE in each treatment group. Across all treatment 
groups, a total of 6 subjects (4 in the voxelotor 1500-mg group, 1 in the voxelotor 900-mg group, and 1 in the 
placebo group) had drug-related SAEs: all drug-related SAEs were sickle cell anaemia with crisis. 
The majority of events were Grade 3, and 1 subject had a Grade 4 SCD-related SAE (placebo); this event of 
sickle cell anaemia with crisis was not considered by the investigator to be related to study drug and did not 
lead to discontinuation.

16.2.7. 
Death 
Overall, 6 subjects reported fatal SAEs, including 2 subjects in each of the treatment groups. Three of the 6 
subjects, 1 in each treatment group, had a fatal event of sickle cell anaemia with crisis. One of these 3 subjects 
(Subject  11-001-0010  in  the  voxelotor  1500-mg  group)  also  had  acute  sickle  hepatic  crisis  (verbatim  term 
coded to PT sickle cell anaemia with crisis) and pulmonary sepsis. Among the remaining 3 subjects, 1 subject 
(Subject 01-031-0003 in the voxelotor 1500-mg group) had a brain abscess and encephalopathy, 1 subject 
(Subject 05 002 0004 in the voxelotor 900-mg group) had reported death – unknown etiology (verbatim term), 
and  1  subject  (Subject  01-055-0001  in  the  placebo group)  had  cardiac  arrest.  None of  the  fatal  SAEs  were 
considered by the investigator to be related to study drug. 
2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
Among  the  haematology  parameters,  mean  changes  in  leukocytes,  neutrophils  and  platelets  were  generally 
small and not clinically meaningful, as values were within the normal range.  
The exposure response analysis showed a statistically significant relationship with Grade 1 decreases in white 
blood cells (WBCs). Taken together with the finding that small reductions in WBCs occurred within the normal 
range, this finding was considered not to be clinically meaningful.  
No clinically meaningful trends in median alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 
alkaline phosphatase (ALK), or potassium were observed in any treatment group. The exposure-safety analysis 
of  data  from  the  pivotal  Study  GBT440-031  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  relationship  between 
exposure and Grade 1 but not Grade 2 ALT elevations. Due to the low-grade and isolated nature of this effect, 
Assessment report  
EMA/102184/2022

that there was no accompanying treatment effect on increasing bilirubin or ALK, and no cases of drug-induced 
liver injury, this finding is not considered to be of clinical concern. Given sensitivity of the kidney to hypoxia, 
creatinine was examined in an exposure safety analysis and showed no relationship to exposure. 
In  each  treatment  group,  changes  from  baseline  in  median  albumin  to  creatinine  ratio  were  small  and  not 
clinically meaningful. 
No correlation was observed between the model-predicted % Hb occupancy at steady-state Cmax and percent 
change from baseline (%CFB) erythropoietin at Week 72. 
Vital signs and electrocardiograms 
Clinically significant ECG results were reported as TEAEs as per protocol for 4 subjects in the voxelotor 1500-
mg group (all were Grade 1 or 2), 7 subjects in the voxelotor 900-mg group (Grade 1 or 2), and 4 subjects in 
the placebo group (Grade 1 or 2). None of the TEAEs associated with the clinically significant ECG results were 
considered serious. All TEAEs related to ECG results were assessed by the investigator as not related to study 
drug except for 2 subjects. One of these subjects discontinued from the study following this event.  
2.6.8.5.  In vitro biomarker test for patient selection for safety 
Not applicable 
2.6.8.6.  Safety in special populations 
No subjects ≥65 years of age were included in the study.  
Intrinsic Factors: Overall, reported TEAEs were largely consistent across subgroups based on age, sex, race, 
and genotype. Please see the paediatric safety data below. 
Renal or Hepatic Impairment 
The analyses of the effect of renal or hepatic impairment were based on clinical pharmacology studies. A formal 
analysis  of  subjects  enrolled  in  Study  GBT440-031  was  not  performed  since  only  a  few  subjects  had  renal 
function below the lower limit of normal and no subjects had hepatic impairment. 
The  TEAEs  reported  in  otherwise  healthy  subjects  with  renal  impairment  or  hepatic  impairment  following  a 
single dose of 1500mg voxelotor were few, mild in severity, did not lead to discontinuation of voxelotor, and 
were consistent with the safety profile seen in the pivotal Study GBT440-031, including events of diarrhoea 
and headache. 
No significant effects of renal impairment or mild or moderate hepatic impairment in otherwise healthy subjects 
were observed on voxelotor exposure, and no dose adjustment from the proposed registrational dose of 1500 
mg  QD  is  required  in  these  populations.  The  recommendation  for  no  dose  adjustment  in  renally  impaired 
patients is also supported by PPK analysis from Study GBT440-031.  
Based on the increase in whole-blood and plasma exposures in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child 
Pugh C), it is recommended to reduce the daily dose of voxelotor to 1000 mg QD in this patient population.

Treatment-emergent  adverse  events  most  commonly  reported  (≥  10%)  for  paediatric  subjects  12  to  <  18 
years of age as compared to adult subjects in the pivotal Study GBT440-031 are presented in the table below.  
As with adults, the most commonly reported TEAEs across all treatment groups in paediatric subjects was sickle 
.cell anaemia with crisis. Although the pattern of all non SCD-related TEAEs was similar across the paediatric 
subjects and adult age groups, in the voxelotor 1500-mg dose groups compared to placebo, paediatric subjects 
had a higher incidence of arthralgia, and adults had a higher incidence of headache, diarrhoea and rash.

Safety in Phase 2a Study GBT440 007 in Paediatric Subjects 
Overall, the safety data (nature and frequency of AEs) obtained in the GBT440-007 study were consistent with 
the data obtained in the GBT440-031 study. The most common non-SCD AEs in the voxelotor 1500 mg group 
were:  headache  (26.7%),  back  pain  (26.7%),  arthralgia  (26.7%),  followed  by  pain  in  extremity,  nausea, 
abdominal pain and oropharyngeal pain (20% for every category). The most commonly reported study drug–
related TEAE in the voxelotor 1500 mg group was nausea (20%), diarrhoea (13.3%), headache (6.7%) and 
rash (6.7%). As for adults, the most commonly reported SCD-related TEAE in both treatment groups was sickle 
cell anaemia with crisis.  
One  subject  (4%)  in  the  voxelotor  900  mg  group  and  4  subjects  (26.7%)  in  the  voxelotor  1500  mg  group 
experienced at least 1 non-SCD-related SAE during the study. None of them were attributed to the study drug 
by the investigator. Ten subjects (40%) in the voxelotor 900 mg group and 5 subjects (33.3%) in the voxelotor 
1500  mg  group  experienced  SCD-related  SAE.  Only  one  of  them  was  considered  to  be  related  to  the  study 
drug: ACS in the voxelotor 900 mg group. There was no death reported.  
2.6.8.7.  Immunological events 
Not applicable. 
2.6.8.8.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Voxelotor is metabolised via multiple routes and therefore DDIs with inhibitors on the PK of voxelotor is unlikely. 
A clinical DDI study with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (itraconazole) in healthy volunteers showed no effect on 
the PK of voxelotor, indicating that the other enzymes are able to take over if CYP3A4 is inhibited. 
In vitro data indicates that voxelotor is an inhibitor of CYP2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19 and 3A4 at maximal systemic 
concentrations and of CYP3A4 at maximal intestinal concentrations. Furthermore, voxelotor is an inhibitor of 
OATP1B1, OAT3, and MATE1 at maximal systemic concentrations. The clinical relevancy of the inhibition

effect of voxelotor on medicinal products that are substrates of these enzymes or transporters was not 
sufficiently investigated. Therefore, the DDI risk of voxelotor on other medicinal products is unknown and 
may lead to safety issues with these other medicinal products. 
2.6.8.9.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation 
TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation in at least 2 subjects are summarised in the table below.  
Overall, the incidence of TEAEs that led to discontinuation of study drug was 12.5% (11/88) of the subjects in 
the voxelotor 1500-mg group, 8.7% (8/92) of the subjects in the voxelotor 900-mg group, and 7.7% (7/91) 
of the subjects in the placebo group. No pattern of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug was observed 
within or across treatment groups.

TEAEs leading to study drug modification  
TEAEs that led to dose modification for at least 2 subjects in any treatment group are summarised in Table 
below 
The  highest  rate  of  TEAEs  that  led  to  modification  of  study  drug  dosing  occurred  in  the  voxelotor  1500-mg 
group (47.7% [42/88 subjects]). The rate in the voxelotor 900-mg group (32.6% [30/92 subjects]) was similar 
to the rate for the placebo group (36.3% [33/91 subjects]). Overall, sickle cell anaemia with crisis was the 
most common TEAE that led to modification of dosing.  
Across  all  3  treatment  groups,  the  majority  of  dosing  modifications  due  to  TEAEs  were  dosing  interruptions 
rather  than  dose  reductions.  In  total,  28.4%  patients  in  the  voxelotor  1500  mg  group  had  dose  reductions 
during  the  Study  GBT440-031  compared  to  12%  in  the  voxelotor  900  mg  group  and  16.5%  in  the  placebo 
group.

a  Rash (grouped PTs) includes the following PTs: rash, urticaria, rash generalised, rash maculo-papular, rash pruritic, rash erythematous, rash 
papular, rash vesicular, and rash macular. PTs contributing to this table include rash, rash generalized, and rash maculo-papular. 
b  Pneumonia (Grouped PTs) includes the following PTs: pneumonia and pneumonia mycoplasmal.  
2.6.8.10.  Post marketing experience 
On  25  November  2019,  Oxbryta  (voxelotor)  was  granted  accelerated  approval  by  the  US  Food  and  Drug 
Administration (FDA) for the treatment of SCD in adults and paediatric patients 12 years of age and older. As 
of 22 August 2020, approximately 2,540 patients have received at least one dose of Oxbryta in the US.  
The majority of adverse drug experiences (ADEs) reported occur under the MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) 
of  Gastrointestinal  Disorders,  Blood  and  Lymphatic  System  Disorders,  Injury,  Poisoning  and  Procedural 
Complications,  and  Nervous  System  Disorders.  Across  all  PADER  reports,  events  with  fatal  outcomes  were 
uncommon, and included SCD-related complications and a single case of SARS-CoV-2 infection. All fatal events 
have been evaluated as not related to Oxbryta. The most commonly reported serious and unlabelled event was 
sickle  cell  anaemia  with  crisis.  The  majority  of  reported  ADEs  were  nonserious  and  labelled  and  included

diarrhoea, product dose omission, nausea, headache and abdominal pain. Post-marketing experience did not 
identify any new safety signals that warrant any changes to the product information. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have been 
included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Main safety data 
The  main  safety  data  are  based  on  a  single  pivotal  Phase  3  Study  GBT440-031  with  the  safety  profile  in 
paediatric subjects 12 to < 18 years of age supported by data from the open-label Phase 2a Study GBT440-
007 Part B. Interim data are also available from Study GBT440-034, the ongoing long-term extension (OLE) of 
Study  GBT440-031  (cumulative  voxelotor  exposure  for  in  total  ≥  144  weeks),  with  a  cut-off  date  of  31 
December 2020.  
Patient exposure 
Across all voxelotor doses, 153 and 114 adults and paediatric subjects 12 to < 18 years of age from Study 
GBT440-031 have received a cumulative voxelotor exposure for ≥72 weeks and ≥96 weeks, respectively. Of 
these, 30 and 20 adolescents were exposed for ≥72 weeks and ≥96 weeks, accordingly. With respect to the 
applied  dose  of  1500  mg,  only  87  and  22  adults  and  adolescent  subjects  had  exposure  for  ≥72  weeks, 
respectively, in the Study GBT440-031/Study GBT440-034. Additional 15 adolescent subjects were exposed to 
the registration dose of 1500 mg in the Study GBT440-007 (Part B – open label phase) for a median of 24 
weeks. The data obtained in the dose ranges other than the registration dose (mostly lower doses and used 
for shorter durations) can only be considered as supportive. 
Non-SCD-related adverse evens 
Most of the subjects in the main study experienced at least 1 non-SCD-related AE (90-97%). Of these, 26.4% 
in the placebo group, 32.6% in the voxelotor 900 mg group and 39.8% in the voxelotor 1500 mg group were 
assessed as related to the study drug. Most of the AEs observed were mild. The number of subjects with any 
serious non-SCD-related TEAEs were similar across treatment groups (between 22-28%), and the incidence of 
non-SCD-related,  drug-related  TEAEs  was  low:  3.4%  in  voxelotor  1500  mg  group  and  1.1%  in  the  placebo 
group. Gastrointestinal Disorders was the most commonly reported SOC in each treatment group, with highest 
incidence in voxelotor 1500 mg group. The most common non-SCD–related TEAEs within voxelotor 1500 mg 
group with higher incidence than in placebo were: headache (31.8%), diarrhoea (22.7%), arthralgia (21.6%) 
and nausea (19.3%).  
The  dose-response  relationship  of  drug-related  AEs  was  driven  primarily  by  the  incidence  of  diarrhoea  and 
abdominal  pain.  Also,  higher  incidence  of  drug-related  rash  was  reported  for  voxelotor  1500  mg  group 
compared to placebo. Two cases of hypersensitivity were reported in the voxelotor studies, one in the pivotal 
study and one in the study in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. In general, the most common adverse 
drug  reactions  (ADRs),  i.e  diarrhoea,  abdominal  pain,  nausea,  rash,  drug  hypersensitivity  are  listed  in  the 
SmPC. 
Excluding non-clinical data, few additional data were provided by the applicant in order to better characterise 
the risk of vomiting with Voxelotor or explain the high incidence of GI AEs, including vomiting, in the placebo 
Assessment report

Page 143/161 
 
 
 
group. Taking into consideration the possible impact of such AEs on the quality of life of patients, especially 
children and adolescents, while dose reductions might not be possible with a potential impact on compliance, 
a close monitoring of these ADRs of vomiting and associated risks will be performed within PSURs. 
Risk of tissue hypoxia 
As voxelotor stabilises the Hb in the oxyhaemoglobin (Hb-O2) state and increases the Hb-O2 affinity, there is 
a risk that at a higher percentage of Hb occupancy than the aimed target of 20%-30% Hb occupancy, the off-
loading of O2 from voxelotor-bound Hb in the peripheral tissues might be decreased, which could lead to end 
organ tissue hypoxic stress and organ dysfunction.  
•  Risk of hypoxia during exercise testing 
These  risks  were  assessed  by  performing  maximal  exercise  physiology  tests  in  SCD  patients  in  the  placebo 
controlled Phase 1 study GBT440-001 (part B + C) in which subjects were treated up to 28 days and 90 days, 
respectively. Additionally, a special dedicated maximal exercise GBT440-0111 study under normoxic or hypoxic 
conditions in healthy volunteers was performed after treatment for 2 weeks. Even though no clear changes in 
clinically  relevant  physiologic  parameters  that  would  indicate  hypoxic  tissue  stress  were  observed  in  both 
studies, it should be noted that only three volunteers were exposed to the 1500 mg dose and the SCD patients, 
although  treated  for  up  to  90  days,  received  doses  up  to  1000  mg  only.  Therefore,  solely  based  on  these 
exercise studies, the potential risk that decreased off-loading of O2 from voxelotor-bound Hb in the peripheral 
tissues on the long run can lead to tissue hypoxia, cannot be excluded.  
•  Safety profile of higher Hb occupancy (above 20-30% target range) 
Analysis  of  %Hb  occupancy  over  time  revealed  that  the  median  %Hb  occupancy  reaches  the  20%  to  30% 
target occupancy quickly within the first weeks of treatment and subsequently remains stable for the entire 
treatment period. The maximum %Hb occupancy estimated for each subject for 1500 mg voxelotor was on 
average 37.9% and 38.1% for GBT440-007 and GBT440-031, respectively. The analysis of subjects with Hb 
occupancy  >30%  showed  that  82%,  40%  and  10%  of  the  evaluated  subjects  (96  in  total,  from  the  Study 
GBT440-007 and Study GBT440-031) achieved Hb occupancy levels >30%, >40% and >50%, respectively, at 
any time point during the study. After the initial accumulation phase (week 4), the time spent above the %Hb 
occupancy  of  30%  and  40%  was  on  average  33%  to  37%  and  15%  to  20%  of  the  treatment  duration, 
respectively, depending on the study. The number of patients with %Hb occupancy above 50% was 10%, with 
average time above that level varying from 3.7% - 15% of the treatment duration. The AEs pattern recorded 
in  patients  with  the  longest  time  spent  at  %Hb  levels  of  >30%,  >40%,  50%  appeared  consistent  with  the 
known  safety  profile  of  voxelotor.  In  conclusion,  the  observed  adverse  event  pattern  in  patients  with  %Hb 
occupancy above target range was comparable with that noted for patients with %Hb occupancy within the 
target range of 20%-30%, with no signs of AEs suggestive of tissue hypoxia. 
SCD-related adverse events 
A similar number of subjects in every group experienced at least one SCD-related AE in the GBT440-031 study 
(75- 80%). The number of subjects who experienced severe SCD-related AEs was high, but similar across the 
groups (52%). However, only a small part of these SAEs were attributed to the study drug (<5%). The majority 
of  SCD-related  AEs  were  sickle  cell  anaemia  with  crisis.  The  incidence  of  priapism  and  ACS  was  higher  in 
voxelotor groups compared to placebo. For example, 2.4%, 14.6% and 12.9% of male subjects in the placebo, 
voxelotor  900  mg  and  voxelotor  1500  mg  group  experienced  priapism  during  the  GBT440-031  study.  Also, 
Assessment report  
EMA/102184/2022 
Page 144/161 
 
 
 
13.6% and 8.7% of subjects in the voxelotor 1500 mg and 900 mg group respectively experienced ACS versus 
6.6% in the placebo group. Even though the numbers are low, the contribution of voxelotor to these differences 
cannot be ruled out. The applicant has committed to carefully monitor incidence of ACS, as well as priapism 
post-marketing and ACS and priapism are identified as an important potential risk in the PSURs. 
Overall, the rate of SAEs in the study was high, but similar across groups. Most of the SAEs were attributed to 
sickle-cell disease manifestation. From the non-SCD–related SAEs, the Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal 
Disorders  SOC  were  more  common  in  the  voxelotor  1500-mg  group  (6.8%  vs  2.2%),  that  includes  pleural 
effusion  and  pulmonary  embolism,  acute  respiratory  failure  and  respiratory  failure.  One  case  of  pulmonary 
embolism in the voxelotor group was considered drug-related. Also, one case of diabetes type 2 was reported 
to be treatment-related in the voxelotor 900 mg group in a patient with BMI 44 and positive family history for 
DM.  
In total, 6 deaths occurred in the GBT440-031 study with two deaths in each treatment arm. None of the fatal 
SAEs were considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug. Three of the 6 subjects, 1 in each 
treatment group, had a fatal event of sickle cell anaemia with crisis. Among the remaining 3 subjects, 1 subject 
in the voxelotor 1500 mg group had a brain abscess and encephalopathy, 1 subject in the voxelotor 900 mg 
group had reported death – unknown aetiology (verbatim term), and 1 subject in the placebo group had cardiac 
arrest. 
No  clear  trends  in  median  changes  from  baseline  for  most  of  the  lab  parameters  were  observed  in  safety 
evaluations.  Reductions  in  white  blood  cells  were  reported  more  often  in  the  voxelotor  groups  compared  to 
placebo with statistically significant ER relationships for Grade ≥ 1 decreased WBC. This needs further attention, 
given that immunosuppressive effects of voxelotor were shown in the animal studies.  
Furthermore, the statistically significant ER relationships for Grade ≥ 1 increased ALT was also confirmed for 
voxelotor. No clear pattern in change in erythropoietin levels over time were observed in the voxelotor studies. 
However, it should be noted that erythropoietin levels are known to be very high at baseline in patients with 
SCD, which makes it difficult to observe a possible (slow-developing) change in erythropoiesis.  
No elderly subjects were included in voxelotor studies (>65 years) and the safety in this population is unknown. 
An appropriate warning is included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. No SCD patient with hepatic or renal impairment 
was included in the GBT440-031 study. Therefore, the safety of voxelotor in this population cannot be properly 
assessed. However, the safety data from the clinical pharmacology studies in otherwise healthy subjects with 
renal  or  hepatic  impairment  were  consistent  with  the  safety  profile  of  voxelotor  seen  in  studies  with  SCD 
patients. However, these were single-dose studies and the number of exposed patients was low and too limited 
to  draw  any  definitive  conclusions  on  the  safety  of  voxelotor  in  patients  with  moderate/severe  hepatic 
impairment, also given the observed effects of voxelotor on ALT elevations. An appropriate warning to cover 
these uncertainties is included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. Severe hepatic impairment led to the increase in 
whole-blood and plasma exposures. Therefore, it is recommended to reduce the daily dose of voxelotor to 1000 
mg QD in this patient population, which is agreed. Age, sex, race or genotype do not seem to influence the 
safety  profile  of  voxelotor.  The  representativeness  of  certain  genotypes  is,  however,  very  limited  and  no 
definitive conclusions can be drawn.  
Voxelotor as inhibitor of CYP2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19 and 3A4 might impact safety of other medicinal products 
that  are  metabolised  by  these  enzymes.  However,  currently  performed  studies  do  not  allow  a  detailed 
assessment of these DDI, hence specific recommendations have been included in section 4.5 and 5.2 of the 
SmPC. Additional DDI studies will be performed post-marketing (please see non-clinical section).

Use during pregnancy 
Due  to  the  lack  of  human  exposure  data,  voxelotor  should  be  avoided  during  pregnancy.  No  contraceptive 
measures  during  treatment  with  voxelotor  is  necessary.  However,  voxelotor  can  be  used  as  a  combination 
treatment with hydroxycarbamide – a potent mutagenic agent that requires effective contraception before the 
start of and during the treatment. Therefore, an additional warning is mentioned in 4.4 to refer to the SmPC of 
hydroxycarbamide to increase an awareness of HCP. 
Use during breast feeding 
It  is  unknown  whether  voxelotor/metabolites  are  excreted  in  human  milk.  Available  pharmacokinetic/ 
toxicological data in animals have shown readily excretion of voxelotor in milk and subsequent uptake in pups. 
As a risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded, voxelotor should not be used during breast-feeding. This 
has been reflected in section 4.6 of the SmPC.  
Discontinuation due to AEs 
The rate of AEs that led to discontinuation of the drug was slightly higher in the voxelotor groups compared to 
placebo in the GBT440-031 study 12.5% 7.7% in voxelotor 1500mg, and placebo groups, respectively.  
Follow-up after discontinuation 
There was a numerically higher incidence of VOCs in the voxelotor 1500mg arm compared with placebo after 
treatment  discontinuation.  To  address  this,  the  applicant  provided  haematocrit  results  for  patients  who 
discontinued voxelotor or completed the pivotal study without enrolling in the extension phase. Considering all 
submitted  data,  it  is  agreed  that  the  causality  relationship  of  increased  incidence  of  VOC  after  treatment 
discontinuation with voxelotor cannot be clearly defined nor completely ruled out. The applicant has committed 
to closely monitor safety data from all sources in the PSURs to better characterise this potential risk. Further 
amendment of the RMP should also be considered when more clinical data will be available.  
Safety data obtained in the ongoing OLE study are consistent with the data from the pivotal trial. Voxelotor 
received marketing authorisation in the USA on 25 November 2019. So far, no unexpected or new safety signals 
were  identified  post-marketing.  The  most  common  SAE  was  sickle  cell  anaemia  with  crisis,  and  the  most 
common labelled AEs were diarrhoea, nausea, headache, and abdominal pain. Death was uncommon and was 
reported as related to the SCD and unrelated to voxelotor in all cases. These data are consistent with the data 
obtained in the clinical trials. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
Safety in paediatric subjects aged 12 to 18 years of age was assessed based on the data from pivotal study, 
as well as supportive GBT440-007 study. Overall safety profile of voxelotor appears to be comparable between 
adolescents and adults. In the voxelotor 1500-mg dose groups compared to placebo, paediatric subjects had 
a higher incidence of arthralgia, and adults had a higher incidence of headache, diarrhoea, and rash.  
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Generally, the safety database is limited, but presented data so far showed that most of the non-SCD drug-
related (S)AE seem to be reversible and of mild or moderate nature. Adverse events that were most 
frequently reported in the voxelotor groups are headache, diarrhoea, nausea, arthralgia and rash. Certain

AEs, i.e vomiting, arthralgia, ACS, priapism and VOC incidence after drug discontinuation, should be carefully 
monitored post-marketing in line with the agreed RMP.

2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did not request alignment of the PSUR cycle with 
the international birth date (IBD). The new EURD list entry will therefore use the EBD to determine the 
forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant  to  Article  23(1)  of  Regulation  No  (EC)  726/2004,  Oxbryta  (voxelotor)  is  included  in  the  additional 
monitoring  list  as  it  contains  a  new  active  substance  which,  on  1  January  2011,  was  not  contained  in  any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore  the  summary  of  product  characteristics  and  the  package  leaflet  includes  a  statement  that  this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
SCD is an orphan inherited disease that has a complex pathophysiology and clinical presentation. SCD is caused 
by mutations in the HBB gene, which encodes haemoglobin subunit β, resulting in the presence of a mutated 
form  of  haemoglobin,  haemoglobin  S  (HbS).  HbS  has  the  capacity  to  polymerise.  In  RBCs,  this  leads  to 
increased density, reduced deformability, increased adhesivity and shortened life span to about 10-20 days. 
Erythrocytes that contain mostly HbS polymers assume a sickled form and are prone to haemolysis, manifesting 
in haemolytic anaemia. Haemolytic anaemia is experienced to various degrees by all patients with SCD and is 
a defining and serious feature of the disease. Haemolytic anaemia leads to reduced oxygen carrying capacity, 
tissue hypoxia, and clinical manifestations of end organ damage. Vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) is another clinical 
hallmark of SCD. Vaso-occlusion results in recurrent painful episodes and a variety of serious organ system 
complications that can lead to life-long disabilities and even death. Haemolytic anaemia and vaso-occlusion, 
being multifactorial pathophysiologic processes, are both a result of the primary molecular event - the formation 
of polymers of de-oxyhaemoglobin S and RBC sickling. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Current treatment options for SCD include 2 medicinal therapies that prevent VOC, i.e. hydroxyurea (HU) and 
crizanlizumab  (Adakveo).  Hydroxyurea  is  indicated  for  patients  2  years  and  older,  while  crizanlizumab  is 
indicated for patients 16 years and older. Crizanlizumab is indicated as an add on therapy to hydroxyurea (HU; 
hydroxycarbamide (HC)) or as monotherapy in patients for whom HU/HC is inappropriate or inadequate. Further, 
red  blood  cell  (RBC)  transfusions  can  be  used  as  on-demand  therapy  (e.g.  for  acute  anaemia)  or  as  a 
prophylactic therapy. Even though chronic RBC transfusion can improve many SCD complications, this therapy 
is  associated  with  a  wide  variety  of  (severe)  adverse  events,  such  as  alloimmunisation,  iron  overload  and 
infection.  Chronic  (prophylactic)  transfusions  are  usually  indicated  for  treatment  of  anaemia  in  case  this 
anaemia is associated with high risk of severe complications such as stroke, acute chest syndrome (ACS) or 
very frequent and severe VOC.  
Allogenic  hematopoietic  stem  cell  transplantation  (alloHSCT)  is  the  only  curative  treatment  option  for  SCD 
patients. However, this treatment is associated with risks following transplantation and moreover, is not readily 
available for the majority of the SCD patients. Additionally, treatments such as preventive antibiotic use and 
analgesics are being used in the management of SCD.  
Although  some  of  the  treatments  described  above  will  lead  to  an  increase  in  haemoglobin  (HU,  RBC 
transfusions),  there  is  currently  no  European  approved  therapy  for  the  treatment  of  haemolytic  anaemia 
associated with SCD. Especially patients who do not have recurrent VOC, have their treatment options limited 
to  blood  transfusions  and  alloHSCT.  Therefore,  SCD  patients  have  an  unmet  medical  need  for  an  effective 
treatment for haemolytic anaemia.

Voxelotor is a Hb polymerisation inhibitor. It aims to target the underlying pathophysiological mechanism of 
SCD, i.e. the ability of HbS to polymerize. Voxelotor inhibits the process of Hb polymerisation by stabilizing the 
oxygenated state of HbS by means of increasing the Hb-oxygen (Hb-O2) affinity. This stabilisation increases 
the ratio of oxygenated HbS to deoxygenated HbS. This would provide a sufficiently prolonged delay time for 
RBCs  to  pass  through  the  hypoxic  environment  of  distal  capillaries  and  arterioles  without  sickling  prior  to 
reoxygenation in the lungs (Oksenberg, 2016). As a consequence haemolytic anaemia is improved and, in the 
long run, a reduction in end-organ damage and morbidity is expected. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study  GBT440-031  is  a  single  phase  3,  double-blind,  randomised,  placebo-controlled,  multicentre  72-week 
study evaluating efficacy and safety of voxelotor in subjects aged 12 to 65 years with sickle cell disease (SCD) 
including haemoglobin (Hb) sickle cell disease with 2 sickle cell genes (HbSS), haemoglobin sickle cell disease 
with 1 HbS sickle cell gene and 1 haemoglobin C gene-(HbSC), HbSβ thalassemia, or other sickle cell syndrome 
variants.  Furthermore,  subjects  were  required  to  have  Hb  levels  at  baseline  ≥  5.5  and  ≤  10.5  g/dL  and 
experienced at least 1 VOC in the previous 12 months were included in the study.. 
The primary endpoint was the percentage of subjects achieving an increase of > 1 g/dL in Hb from baseline to 
Week 24. Important secondary and exploratory endpoints included change of Hb levels and haemolysis markers 
(indirect bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, % reticulocyte and absolute reticulocyte count) from baseline at 24, 
48 and 72 weeks, as well as VOC rates at 72 weeks. The open label extension study GBT440-034 of the main 
study GBT440-031, provides additional long-term data on voxelotor safety and efficacy.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Only  results  from  the  voxelotor  1500  mg  dose  will  be  presented  here  as  the  most  relevant  for  the  current 
application. 
Primary endpoint: More subjects treated with voxelotor 1500 mg or voxelotor 900 mg had an increase from 
baseline in Hb levels >1 g/dL compared to placebo: 51.1%, 32.6% and 6.5% respectively (p<0.001) at 
week 24. The response rate was similar in subjects who were or were not receiving HU concurrently. Also age, 
race, region, gender and baseline Hb levels did not have an influence on the voxelotor efficacy based on the 
24 week analysis.  
Secondary endpoints: The treatment with voxelotor resulted in statistically significant and sustained (up to 72 
weeks) increase in Hb levels when compared to baseline levels, as well as to placebo. The least-squares (LS) 
mean change in Hb from baseline at 72 weeks was 1.02 g/dL (CI 0.72, 1.31) in the voxelotor 1500 mg group, 
0.54 (CI 0.25, 0.82) in the voxelotor 900 mg group and 0.02 (CI -0.27, 0.32) in the placebo group (p<0.001 
for 1500 mg vs. placebo, exploratory). The incidence rate (IR) of acute anaemic episodes (Hb decrease > 
2g/dl) decreased with voxelotor (4/90 subjects) in comparison to placebo (11/92 subjects); the annualised IR 
of was 3-fold lower with voxelotor 1500 mg compared to placebo (0.05 vs 0.15 per person years). 
Assessment report  
EMA/102184/2022 
Page 153/161 
 
 
 
 
 
Regarding haemolysis parameters, treatment with voxelotor resulted in a decrease in indirect bilirubin and 
% reticulocyte at 72 weeks. LS mean percentage change from baseline in indirect bilirubin was -23.9% (CI -
33.5, -14.3) compared to the increase of 2.7% (CI -7.0, 12.3) in the placebo group (p<0.001 for 1500 mg vs. 
placebo, exploratory). LS mean percentage change from baseline in % reticulocyte was -7.6% (CI -18.5, 3.3) 
compared  to  the  increase  of  11%  (CI  0.2,  21.8)  in  the  placebo  group  (p=0.017  for  1500  mg  vs.  placebo, 
exploratory). 
An  annualised  incidence  rate  (IR)  of  on  treatment  events  of  VOC  in  three  groups  were  comparable  when 
analysing total (mITT) population: voxelotor 1500 mg (219 events; adjusted IR of 2.4 events/year), voxelotor 
900 mg (251 events; 2.4 events/year), and placebo (293 events; 2.8 events/year). When analysing subjects 
with  higher  baseline  annual  VOC  rate  (≥  2  VOCs),  a  trend  of  improvement  was  observed  for  subjects  who 
received voxelotor 1500 mg group (134 events, 2.5 events/year) compared with the voxelotor 900 mg group 
(174 events, 3.0 events/year) and placebo group (197 events, 3.1 events/year).  
For the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) scale, at the final Week 72 timepoint, 73.6% (39/53) 
of the subjects in the voxelotor 1500 mg group, 55.2% (32/58) of the subjects in the voxelotor 900 mg group, 
and 47.1% (24/51) of the subjects in the placebo group were assessed as having moderately or very much 
improved relative to baseline (p<0.01 for 1500 mg vs. placebo, exploratory).  
The efficacy data from the OLE study GBT-440-034 are consistent with the results of the pivotal phase 3 trial 
GMT440-031. Voxelotor treatment results in less haemolysis as shown by durable Hb increase, indirect bilirubin 
decrease and decrease in % reticulocyte. 
The 24-week Hb and haemolysis data from the paediatric study GBT440-007 are consistent with the results of 
the pivotal phase 3 trial GMT440-031.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Study conduct. The last major protocol amendment #4 that took place following second interim analysis 
brought substantial changes to the study design. As a result, the primary analysis set, trial size and number 
and ordering of confirmatory secondary endpoints were amended.  There is a potential inflation of the type I 
error rate, because the sample size was adjusted downwards. Also, the CGIC endpoint was added to the 
protocol following the protocol amendment #4. Several important secondary endpoints were downgraded to 
exploratory, leading to these results being supportive rather than confirmatory. 
Efficacy endpoints. Even though voxelotor showed a beneficial effect on Hb levels, it is not clear to what 
extent the observed increase in Hb also translates into better tissue oxygenation. While voxelotor binding will 
increase Hb-O2 affinity, which is expected to reduce Hb polymerisation, RBC sickling and haemolysis, at the 
same  time,  difficulties  in  off-loading  O2  in  tissue  capillaries  is  seen  as  competing  phenomenon  that  may 
potentially cancel part of a beneficial effect of voxelotor. These concerns are also strengthened by the in vitro 
and  animal  data  that  suggest  that  voxelotor bound  Hb  is  compromised  in  its  ability  to  offload  O2,  and  only 
voxelotor-free Hb contributes to tissue oxygenation. Additionally, the clinical relevance of observed increase in 
Hb and decreases in haemolysis parameters for the occurrence of (long-term) complications due to SCD was 
not studied.  
Assessment report  
EMA/102184/2022 
Page 154/161 
 
 
 
The pivotal study was not powered to detect the effect of the treatment on the VOC rate and also, about 40% 
of subjects enrolled in the study had a history of only 1 VOC in the previous 12 months, hampering to definitively 
conclude on a beneficial effect on VOC incidence.  
Health-related quality of life measures. The results of the CGIC scale showed improvement on voxelotor 
treatment. However, the introduction of this subjective endpoint was quite late in the study (at amendment 
#4) and only part of the patients were evaluated for this endpoint, which hampers the interpretation of the 
results substantially.  
Although the primary endpoint of the percentage of subjects achieving an increase in Hb was met, no beneficial 
effect  of  the  treatment  was  observed  between  groups  on  endpoints  that  reflect  disease  burden  and  patient 
wellbeing.  The  rate  of  any  opioid  use  (approximately  80%)  and  the  percentage  of  patients  (approximately 
35%)  who  received  one  or  more  RBC  transfusions  were  similar  in  each  treatment  arm.  Patient-reported 
outcome  (PRO)  baseline  scores  indicate  that  the  majority  of  the  patients  in  the  study  had  relatively  few 
limitations, making it more difficult to detect any improvement from baseline. As there is only a single pivotal 
trial, further evidence for this type of benefit to the patient is lacking. 
The long-term efficacy data  > 72 weeks is currently limited: only 87 adults subjects and 22 adolescents 
were exposed to the registration dose for more than 72 weeks; 52 patients have an exposure for 144 weeks. 
Currently, only 100 patients remain in the ongoing open label extension study, which adds the uncertainty on 
the long-term effects.  
Subgroups.  A subgroup analysis based on genotypes other than HbSS was performed, which showed 
comparable efficacy. As this is based on a small number of patients, definitive conclusions are hampered, 
though no substantial differences are expected considering the MoA of voxelotor. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The most common non-SCD–related TEAEs within voxelotor 1500 mg group with higher incidence than in 
placebo were: headache (31.8% vs 25.3%), diarrhoea (22.7% vs 11%), arthralgia (21.6% vs 14.3%) and 
nausea (19.3% vs 9.9%). Also, a higher incidence of rash was reported for voxelotor 1500 mg group (14.8%) 
compared to placebo (11%). Most of these events were mild/moderate in severity (Grade 1 and Grade 2), and 
only few led to treatment discontinuation. The majority was assessed by the investigator as not related to the 
study  drug.  The  dose-response  relationship  of  drug-related  AEs  was  driven  primarily  by  the  incidence  of 
diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Two cases of hypersensitivity were reported in the voxelotor studies, one in 
the pivotal study and one in the study in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  
Subgroups. No clear influence of age, sex, race or genotype on the voxelotor safety profile was observed. 
Safety profile of voxelotor in adolescents was generally comparable to adults. In the voxelotor 1500 mg dose 
groups compared to placebo, paediatric subjects had a higher incidence of arthralgia, and adults had a higher 
incidence of headache, diarrhoea, and rash. No subjects ≥65 years of age were included in voxelotor studies, 
which is also mentioned in the SmPC. 
The rate of AEs that led to discontinuation of the drug was slightly higher in the voxelotor groups compared to 
placebo in the GBT440-031 study 12.5% 7.7% in voxelotor 1500mg, and placebo groups, respectively.  
Assessment report

Page 155/161 
 
 
 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Limited safety data set. The safety database for the registration dose is limited that brings uncertainty to 
the completeness of the safety assessment. An open label extension study (GBT440-034) is ongoing and will 
be submitted post-marketing. 
Non-clinical/clinical safety findings. Even though the safety data from the clinical studies do not directly 
indicate particular safety issues, the nature and severity of the safety findings in the animal studies together 
with some observations in the clinical studies are notable:  
-  Long-term  safety  and  risk  of  end-organ  hypoxia.  There  is  a  potential  risk  that  a  high  %  Hb 
occupancy above the target % Hb occupancy of 20-30% may lead to a decrease in the offloading of O2 
from  Hb  in  the  peripheral  tissues,  leading  to  hypoxic  tissue  stress  upon  long-term  exposure  to 
voxelotor. The possible signs of hypoxia will be monitored by the applicant post-marketing.  
-  Effect on the immune system. In the clinical studies, exposure-dependent decrease in WBC within 
the normal range was observed. Even though no evident increase in the infection rates was observed 
during the pivotal study in the 1500 mg group, this needs further attention, given that in monkeys, 
treatment with voxelotor at dose levels comparable to those in clinical studies (starting already from 
exposure  multiple of  ~0.5  based  on  plasma  Cmax  values) leads  to  the  delayed  and  reduced immune 
response following a challenge with a standard antigen (KLH). Also, decreased lymphocyte counts in 
peripheral blood as well as in both primary and secondary lymphoid organs in the high-dose monkeys 
was noted. Decreased humoral response and changes in the relative ratio of T- and B-lymphocytes was 
also seen in rats at EM~4.5 of the anticipated clinical exposure. The possible impact of the drug on the 
immune system, therefore, is of particular importance for already immunocompromised patients who 
were  not  studied  in  voxelotor  trials.  Safety  data  in  immunocompromised  patients  is  mentioned  as 
missing information in RMP. Also, an appropriate warning is added in section 4.4 of the SmPC.   
Gastrointestinal Disorders was the most commonly reported SOC in each treatment group. This toxicity was 
also identified in non-clinical studies; including a necrotic effect. This risk is currently reflected in section 4.8 
of the SmPC. High incidence of vomiting in the voxelotor group is noted, and this AE will carefully monitored 
post-marketing in PSUR.  
SCD-related AEs.  Considering SCD-related AEs, the overall incidence of any SCD event was similar across 
treatment  groups  (75.0%  to  80.2%);  the  majority  of  these  events  were  sickle  cell  anaemia  with  crisis.  An 
increased incidence of ACS and priapism in the voxelotor groups compared to placebo is noted. However, due 
to low number of events and the fact that these are also manifestations of SCD, no hard conclusions can be 
drawn and their incidence will be further carefully monitored post-marketing.   
The  risk  of  viscosity-related  increase  of  VOCs  after  drug  discontinuation  cannot  be  ruled  out.  The 
applicant will closely monitor safety data from all sources in the PSURs to better characterise this potential risk 
at the treatment discontinuation. Further amendment of the RMP could be considered when more clinical data 
will be available. 
Subgroups. Subjects aged >65 years were not included in the voxelotor studies, therefore, the safety in this 
population  is  unknown.  Also,  even  though  no  particular  difference  was  observed  in  the  safety  profile  of 
adolescents compared to adults, the safety data in adolescents is limited. Age, sex, race or genotype do not 
Assessment report  
EMA/102184/2022 
Page 156/161 
 
 
 
seem  to  influence  safety  profile  of  voxelotor.  The  representativeness  in  terms  of  certain  genotypes  is  very 
limited, but no differences in terms of safety are expected.  
There  are  uncertainties  with  respect  to  the  drug-drug  interaction  (DDI)  studies.  Voxelotor  was  shown  to 
inhibit numerous enzymes and transporters. However, certain DDI studies were too short or performed at much 
lower doses than the registration dose that does not allow to properly investigate the effect of DDI. Also, some 
DDI studies are lacking and will be performed post-marketing.  
Hepatic and renal impairment. The safety of voxelotor in SCD patients with hepatic impairment or patients 
with renal impairment requiring dialysis is uncertain, which is mentioned in section 4.4 of the SmPC.

3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The treatment with voxelotor resulted in a fast (within 2 weeks) and sustained increase in Hb levels, with more 
than a half of patients having Hb increase by more than 1 g/dL after 24 weeks. Following 72 weeks of treatment 
the effect was sustained with a mean Hb change from baseline being 1.02 g/dL (0.72, 1.31). Importantly, the 
effect on Hb was observed when voxelotor was used alone or on top of HU/HC that is a current standard of 
care for patients with SCD. Also age gender and baseline Hb levels did not have an influence on the voxelotor 
efficacy  further  supporting  the inclusion of  adolescents  in  the  indication.  Even  though  it  can  be  agreed that 
Assessment report  
EMA/102184/2022 
Page 158/161 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
increasing Hb levels > 1g/dL is clinically relevant, the exact effect of the increase in Hb on improved tissue 
oxygenation remain uncertain, since contribution of voxelotor-bound Hb (that constitute 20-30% of the total 
Hb) to tissue oxygenation appears to be negligible.   
With respect to haemolysis as efficacy parameter, voxelotor showed a decrease in indirect bilirubin levels by 
more than 20% and % reticulocyte reduction by 7.6% after 72 weeks of treatment. This is indicative for reduced 
destruction  of  the  RBC,  which  is  beneficial.  In  fact,  this  can  be  considered  the  main  benefit  of  voxelotor 
treatment so far, as haemolysis is an important determinant of disease severity and is a critical contributor to 
the  activation  of  adhesion  molecules  by  all  blood  cells,  aberrant  vaso-regulation  and  coagulation  that  all 
ultimately  lead  to  multi-organ  injury.  Unfortunately,  the  pivotal  study  was  not  designed  to  demonstrate  a 
beneficial effect of voxelotor on VOC reduction, however, a positive trend in VOC rate, even though not large, 
was observed on voxelotor treatment upon prolonged use that also suggests better blood rheology in line with 
the improvement in the haemolysis markers.  
Clinical safety data is in general limited, with only 78 and 52 patients being exposed for ≥72 weeks and ≥144 
weeks to the registration dose of 1500 mg, respectively. The fact that voxelotor-bound Hb is less able to release 
O2, raised concerns with respect to the long-term safety of the treatment with voxelotor. There is a potential 
risk that a higher % Hb occupancy than the target range (20-30% Hb occupancy) may substantially decrease 
the  offloading  of  O2  from  Hb  in  the  peripheral  tissues,  which  may  lead  to  hypoxic  tissue  stress  and  organ 
dysfunction  with  prolonged  use.  This  phenomenon  was  observed  in  animal  studies,  where %  Hb  occupancy 
>50% led to an appreciable degree of compensatory erythropoiesis. However, even though the follow-up in 
the clinical studies is still short to definitely rule out the long-term hypoxia risk, analysis of available clinical 
safety data, extended with new data available from the OLE  study (up to >144 weeks total exposure in 52 
patients), US post-marketing data, and further analysis of AEs regarding possible signs/symptoms of hypoxia 
so  far  did  not  present  clear  signals  pointing  out  a  risk  of  tissue  hypoxia  in  patients  in  the  longer  term. 
Furthermore, even though the % Hb occupancy exceeded the target threshold of 30% in many patients (82%) 
at some points in the study, the mean overall Hb occupancy was within the target 20-30%, and only a small 
proportion  of  patients  (10%)  and  during  short  period  (up  to  15%  of  total  treatment  duration)  had  %  Hb 
occupancy >50%.  
Overall, the presented clinical safety data so far show that voxelotor is well-tolerated since the majority of the 
adverse events are mild to moderate in severity, and the discontinuations due to drug-related adverse events 
are low. The most common adverse events are headache, arthralgia and gastro-intestinal disorders. Incidence 
of ACS and priapism was somewhat increased in the voxelotor groups compared to placebo, however, due to 
low number of events and the fact that these are also manifestations of SCD, no hard conclusions can be drawn 
and  their  incidence  is  to  be  further  carefully  monitored  post-marketing,  as  should  be  VOC  events  at 
discontinuation of voxelotor. Additional data will be provided in the open label extension study GBT440-034. 
Even though safety data on adolescents is considered limited, so far, the safety profile of voxelotor does not 
seem to be different in adolescents compared to adults, which is reassuring. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Treatment with voxelotor has resulted in a beneficial effect in terms of reduction in haemolysis and an 
increase in Hb, which are considered of clinical relevance to the patients. The effects on long-term outcome

of SCD has not been studied, even so the beneficial effects appear to be accompanied by limited and 
manageable (short-term) risks. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Oxbryta is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Oxbryta is not similar to Adakveo within the meaning of Article 
3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000. See Appendix on Similarity. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Oxbryta is favourable in the following indication(s): 
Oxbryta is indicated for the treatment of haemolytic anaemia due to sickle cell disease (SCD) in adults and 
paediatric patients 12 years of age and older as monotherapy or in combination with hydroxycarbamide. 
The  CHMP  therefore  recommends  the  granting  of  the  marketing  authorisation  subject  to  the  following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any 
agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being 
received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an important 
(pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product to be implemented by the Member States 
Not applicable. 
New active substance status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that voxelotor is to be qualified as a new 
active  substance  in  itself  as  it  is  not  a  constituent  of  a  medicinal  product  previously  authorised  within  the 
European Union. Refer to Appendix on new active substance (NAS).  
Paediatric data 
Furthermore,  the  CHMP  reviewed  the  available  paediatric  data  of  studies  subject  to  the  agreed  Paediatric 
Investigation  Plan  P/0489/2020  and  the  results  of  these  studies  are  reflected  in  the  Summary  of  Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN BY PRODUCT
Summary of risk management plan for ERVEBO
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for ERVEBO. The RMP details 
important risks of ERVEBO, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information 
will be obtained about ERVEBO’s risks and uncertainties (missing information).
ERVEBO’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how ERVEBO should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for ERVEBO should be read in the context of all this information,
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all of 
which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
ERVEBO’s RMP.
I.
The Medicine and What it is Used for
ERVEBO is authorised for active immunization of at-risk individuals 1 year of age and older 
to protect against Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) caused by Zaire Ebola virus (see product 
labeling for the full indication). It contains rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP as the active substance and 
it is given by intramuscular administration.
Further information about the evaluation of ERVEBO’s benefits can be found in ERVEBO’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the
medicine’s webpage: link to product’s EPAR summary landing page on the EMA webpage.
II.
Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further 
Characterise the Risks 
Important risks of ERVEBO, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about ERVEBO’s risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
•
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
• The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly;
• The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks;
• Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.

In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures 
constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of ERVEBO is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A
List of Important Risks and Missing Information
Important risks of ERVEBO are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of ERVEBO. Potential risks are 
concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available 
data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

Literature
Risk factors and risk groups
Vaccine recipients should attempt to avoid close association with and 
exposure of high-risk individuals to blood and bodily fluids for up to 6 weeks 
following vaccination. People who develop vesicular rash after receiving the 
vaccine should cover the vesicles until they heal. 
High-risk individuals include:
•
•
•
Immunocompromised individuals and individuals receiving 
immunosuppressive therapy
Pregnant or breast-feeding women 
Children <1 year of age
Individuals administered rVSV∆G-ZEBOV-GP should not donate blood for 
at least 6 weeks postvaccination.

Other Studies in Post-Authorisation Development Plan
V920-015 African-Canadian Study of HIV-Infected Adults and a Vaccine for Ebola 
(ACHIV-Ebola)
Rationale:   Future Ebola outbreaks are likely to occur in countries where HIV infection is 
endemic or present in large segments of the population.  It is important to know whether 
V920 will be safe and effective in this patient population as efforts to roll out vaccination 
during an epidemic need to be quick and HIV testing may not be possible.  Twenty-two 
known HIV-infected individuals have received V920 in the Phase 2 placebo-controlled trial 
in Liberia (V920-009), and the preliminary safety profile in this small number of participants 
appeared to be generally similar to the overall vaccinated population.  However, safety and 
immunogenicity of V920 has not been formally evaluated in HIV-infected individuals in a 
randomized controlled manner to date.  This is what is intended with this study.

(rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP, LIVE)
Primary Objectives:
1) Evaluate the safety and tolerability of V920 in HIV-infected adults and adolescents.
2) Evaluate the immunogenicity of V920 via ZEBOV- specific antibody responses induced 
by V920 in HIV-infected adults and adolescents.
V920 Expanded Access Protocol #5 (V920-EAP5) in the Democratic Republic of Congo 
(Amendment #1)
Rationale: The results of V920 vaccination have been very encouraging. However, because 
the vaccine was not approved at the time of the outbreak, the national epidemic response 
coordinator and their team in the DRC have deemed it necessary to implement ring 
vaccination in order to control the surge of EVD to control the spread of the disease.
Primary Objectives:
1) To evaluate the safety of the V920 vaccine by following SAEs for 21 days for all 
participants.
Secondary Objectives:
1) To summarize the cumulative incidence of EVD laboratory-confirmed cases amongst 
eligible persons after 21 days of monitoring, where a ring vaccination or geographically 
targeted vaccination strategy has been used.
2) To document the safety of a single dose of V920 vaccine in evaluating the solicited AEs 
(fever, headaches, tiredness, diarrhea, vomiting, myalgia, arthralgia and local 
reactogenicity) for 21 days and the unsolicited AEs during the 21 days of follow-up for 
all participants.

1.  Introduction 
On  14  January  2015,  the  MAH  submitted  a  completed  paediatric  study  for  NovoRapid,  in  accordance 
with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that the paediatric trial NN1218-3888 was conducted as part of the currently ongoing 
development  programme  for  a  new  faster-acting  insulin  aspart  formulation.  In  trial  NN1218-3888, 
NovoRapid was selected as comparator.  
NovoRapid (insulin aspart) is approved for the treatment of type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus (T1DM and 
T2DM)  in  adults  (including  pregnant  women),  adolescents  and  children  aged  2  and  above.  The  first 
marketing  authorisation  was  granted  on  07  Sep  1999  in  the  European  Union  (EU),  and  for  use  in 
children aged 2 and above on 30 Mar 2005. 
There is no paediatric investigational plan (PIP)  for  NovoRapid. The use of NovoRapid in children and 
adolescents has been studied in a number of clinical trials. 
In  this  report,  only  data  relevant  for  the  assessment  of  efficacy  and  safety  of  NovoRapid  in  the 
paediatric  population  is  discussed.  Evaluation  of  the  full  clinical  trial  report  will  be  conducted  at 
submission of the marketing authorisation application for faster-acting insulin aspart. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
NovoRapid  (insulin  aspart),  100  U/mL  solution  provided  in  a  3  mL  PDS290  pen-injector.  The  batch 
number  was  CP50922.  The  formulation  includes  glycerol,  phenol,  metacresol,  zinc  chloride,  disodium 
phosphate  dihydrate,  sodium  chloride,  hydrochloric  acid/sodium  hydroxide  (for  pH  adjustment),  and 
water for injection. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects

NN1218-3888  -  A  Trial  Investigating  the  Pharmacokinetic  Properties  of 
FIAsp (fast-acting insulin aspart) in Children, Adolescents and Adults with 
Type 1 Diabetes 
Description 
This  was  a  randomised,  single-centre,  double-blind,  single-dose,  two-period  cross-over  trial 
investigating the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of faster-acting insulin aspart and 
NovoRapid  in  a  meal-test  setting,  in  children  (6−11  years),  adolescents  (12−17  years)  and  adults 
(18−64 years) with T1DM. 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
Primary objective: 
• 
To  compare  the  total  exposure  of  faster-acting  insulin  aspart  between  children,  adolescents 
and adult subjects with type 1 diabetes. 
Secondary objectives: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To  compare  the  maximum  concentration  of  faster-acting  insulin  aspart  between  the  three 
different age groups. 
To  compare  the  pharmacokinetic  and  pharmacodynamic  properties  of  faster-acting  insulin 
aspart and NovoRapid between the three different age groups. 
To  compare  the  effects  of  age  on  faster-acting  insulin  aspart  pharmacokinetic  and 
pharmacodynamic  properties  with  the  effects  of  age  on  NovoRapid  pharmacokinetic  and 
pharmacodynamic properties. 
To compare the early pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of faster-acting insulin 
aspart vs. NovoRapid in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. 
To assess the safety and tolerability of faster-acting insulin aspart in children, adolescents and 
adult subjects with type 1 diabetes. 
Assessor’s comment: 
This  assessment  report  focuses  on  the  pharmacokinetic  and  pharmacodynamic  properties  of  insulin 
aspart, administered as NovoRapid, in children and adolescents in comparison to previous data. 
The MAH does not suggest any changes to the product information based on the results. 
Study design 
This  was  a  randomised,  single-centre,  double-blind,  single-dose,  two-period,  cross-over  trial 
investigating the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of faster-acting insulin aspart and 
NovoRapid  in  children,  adolescents  and  adults  with  type  1  diabetes.  Each  subject  was  randomly 
allocated to a treatment sequence consisting of two dosing visits during which the subject received a 
single subcutaneous injection of either faster-acting insulin aspart or NovoRapid at a predefined fixed 
dose level (0.2 U/kg bw) in connection to intake of a standardised meal (meal test).

NovoRapid EMEA/H/C/258 
Page 5/18 
 
 
 
 
Immediately after (as soon as possible and no later than 2 minutes after) trial product administration, 
a  standardised  liquid  meal  (BOOST®  Nestlé/Novartis  Medical  Nutrition;  macronutrient  distribution: 
68% carbohydrates, 17% protein, 15% fat) was given to the subject and consumed within 8 minutes 
after  dosing.  The  amount  of  BOOST®  given  was  adjusted  to  the  subject’s  weight.  The  subject  then 
refrained from eating until 6 hours after dosing (end of the meal test).  
Blood  samples  for  determination  of  blood-glucose  were  collected  during  the  meal  test  until  6  h  post-
administration.  Blood-samples  for  determination  of  insulin  in  serum  were  taken  up  to  12  hours  after 
drug-administration.  
Free  (PEG-precipitated)  serum  insulin  aspart  was  measured  using  a  validated  insulin  aspart  specific 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). 
Assessor’s comment: 
In general the study design appears acceptable.  
The  bioanalytical  report  or  validation  reports  could  not  be  found  in  the  dossier.    This  may  be 
overlooked for this application. 
Sample size 
The trial was a descriptive one, and, thus, the number of subjects needed to complete the trial was set 
to 12 in each of the three age groups without any formal sample size calculation, in accordance  with 
current guidelines. 
Treatments 
Each subject received a single subcutaneous dose of either fast-acting insulin aspart or NovoRapid in a 
randomised, double-blinded manner at a dose-level of 0.2 U/kg bw. 
The  subjects  were  instructed  to  comply  with  the  requirements  for  their  diabetes  treatment  prior  to 
each  of  the  dosing  visits  (visit  2−3).  Three  days  (72  hours)  prior  to  trial  product  administration, 
subjects  using  insulin  degludec  were  switched  to  NPH  insulin,  and  2  days  (48  hours)  prior  to  trial 
product administration, subjects using insulin detemir or insulin glargine were switched to NPH insulin, 
according  to  individual  dosing  instructions  provided  by  the  investigator.  The  last  injection  of  NPH 
insulin  or  other  intermediate-acting  insulin  products  was  to  take  place  at  least  22  hours  prior  to  trial 
product administration. 
At  the  dosing  visits,  the  subjects  were  to  meet  at  the  site  the  evening  before  dosing,  in  order  to 
receive an overnight infusion of human soluble insulin (Actrapid) until the morning of the dosing day in 
order to achieve stable plasma glucose concentration.

Statistical Methods 
The  primary  endpoint  as  well  as  the  secondary  PK/PD  endpoints  were  each  analysed  by  means  of  a 
linear  mixed  model  with  treatment  and  period  as  fixed  effects  and  subjects  as  random  effect.  For  all 
the PD endpoints, PGPre-dose was added as a covariate. For the two PK endpoints onset of appearanceIAsp 
and time to 50% Cmax,Iasp, and for all PD endpoints the model was chosen to be additive whereas it was 
multiplicative  for  all other  endpoints.  When  the  PK  endpoints  were derived,  compartmental  modelling 
was  used  as  an  aid  wherever  applicable.  All  safety  endpoints  were  listed  and  summarized  using 
descriptive statistics. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A  total  of  55  subjects  were  screened,  of  whom  41  were  randomised.  The  most  common  reasons  for 
screening  failure  were  not  having  a  total  daily  insulin  treatment  of  <  1.2  (I)U/kg/day  (inclusion 
criterion  5)  and  not  having  a  total  daily  bolus  insulin  treatment  of  ≥  0.3  and  <  0.7  (I)U/kg/day 
(inclusion criterion 6). 
All  but  one  of  the  randomised  subjects  were  exposed  to  trial  products;  this  unexposed  subject  was 
withdrawn  from  the  trial  prior  to  visit  2,  day  1  due  to  violation  of  dosing  day  exclusion  criterion  13. 
Two  further  subjects  were  withdrawn  from  the  trial  after  visit  2,  following  exposure  to  trial  product 
(faster-acting insulin aspart in both cases): one subject was withdrawn due to there being difficulties in 
taking  blood  samples  on  a  rescheduled  dosing  visit,  whilst  the  other  subject  withdrew  as  it  was  not 
possible  for  him  to  attend  a  rescheduled  dosing  visit  3  necessitated  by  a  deviation  in  the  storage 
temperature affecting the trial product on the original date. The remaining 38 subjects were exposed 
to both faster-acting insulin aspart and NovoRapid and completed the trial. 
Table 1 Subject disposition 
Baseline data 
All randomised and exposed subjects were of race group White. There were more females (n=8) than 
males (n=4) in the children age group, whilst this was reversed in the adult group (4 females and 11 
males).  The  distribution  in  the  adolescent  group  was  more  equal,  with  6  females  and  7  males.  The 
mean  age  was  10.4  years  in  the  children  age  group  (age  range  9−11  years),  15.1  in  the  adolescent 
group  (age  range  13−17  years),  and  20.2  in  the  adult  group  (age  range  18−25  years).  Ten  of  the

children were assessed as prepubertal (Tanner stage 1) and 2 as pubertal (Tanner stage 2 or above), 
and in the adolescent group, 1 was assessed as prepubertal and 12 as pubertal. The mean body weight 
was 40.7 kg (range 32.8-57.0 kg) in children, 62.4 kg (range 44.1-87.8 kg) in adolescents and 74.6 kg 
(range 54.4-105.7 kg) in adults.  
The  mean  duration  of  diabetes  was  6.1,  6.9  and  8.9  years  for  the  children,  adolescent  and  adult 
groups, respectively, reflecting the young mean age of the adult group. Mean observed HbA1c values 
were  lowest  in  children  (7.7%),  with  the  adult  group  having  a  mean  value  of  7.9%,  and  adolescents 
having the highest mean of 8.1%. 
Assessor’s comment: 
The age range in the paediatric patient group was very narrow, only including children aged 9-11. The 
adult patient group was relatively young with an age range of 18-25 years.

Onset of appearance 
The estimated onset of appearance of NovoRapid in children (9.83 minutes) and in adolescents (10.99 
minutes) did not statistically significantly differ to that estimated for adults (12.28 minutes; Fieller age 
group  ratio  with  children  0.80  [0.57;1.08]95%  CI;  Fieller  age  group  ratio  with  adolescents  0.89 
[0.72;1.12]95% CI). See Table 2. 
The estimated time to 50% Cmax following administration of NovoRapid in children (30.93 minutes) was 
not statistically significantly different to that estimated in adults (37.01 minutes; Fieller age group ratio 
0.84 [0.64;1.06]95% CI), but was statistically significant for adolescents (31.27 minutes) compared to 
adults (Fieller age group ratio: 0.84 [0.72;1.00]95% CI). See Table 2.

Total insulin exposure 
Estimated  total  exposure  to  NovoRapid  was  411.88  pmol*h/L  in  children,  515.16  pmol*h/L  in 
adolescents  and  689.07  pmol*h/L  in  adults,  meaning  that  total  exposure  was  approximately  40% 
lower  in  children  and  25%  lower  in  adolescents  compared  to  adults  when  dosed  at  0.2  U/kg  body 
weight, and these differences were significant. The  mean absolute dose in the children group (8.3 U) 
was 47% lower than that in the adult group (15.6 U), and in the adolescent group (12.8 U) it was 18% 
lower than that in the adult group. 
The  maximum  serum  insulin  aspart  concentration  for  NovoRapid  was  similar  between  children  and 
adults (age group ratio 0.91 [0.70;1.18]95% CI), and between adolescents and adult (age group ratio 
0.91 [0.71;1.17]95% CI).

Table  3  Statistical  analysis  of  total  exposure  and  maximum  concentration, 
NovoRapid. 
Assessor’s comment: 
Insulin  aspart  was  rapidly  absorbed  in  all  patient  groups.  Total  exposure  was  40%  lower  in  children 
and 25% lower in adolescents compared to the adult group. Cmax was 9% lower in both children and 
adolescents  compared  to  adult  patients.  This  is  not  completely  consistent  with  the  results  from 
previously  reported  data  which  showed  higher  AUC  and  Cmax  in  children  and  adolescents  than  in 
adults.  The  paediatric  studies  are  however  relatively  small  which  may  explain  the  inter-study 
differences. The age of the patients included in the current study was also rather narrow (children 9-11 
years,  adolescents  13-17  years  and  adults  18-25  years)  and  not  entirely  representative  of  the  full 
populations.   
The Applicant concludes that in general, the pharmacokinetic responses were similar to adults, which is 
in  agreement  with  previous  observations.  This  is  endorsed.  The  differences  between  children  and 
adults have previously been considered not to be clinically relevant since insulin is individually titrated. 
This conclusion remains. 
In summary: The pharmacokinetic conclusion remains the same.  
Pharmacodynamic results 
Mean baseline adjusted PG profiles for all age groups are shown for NovoRapid in Figure 5 and Figure 
6. 
A number of subjects received glucose interventions following administration of NovoRapid: 2 children, 
1 adolescent and 5 adults. No interventions were made during the first 60 minutes, and the majority 
occurred  between  120  minutes  and  300  minutes  following  product  administration.  Because  38.5%  of 
adults  (5  subjects)  received  a  glucose  intervention,  the  assessment  of  mean  change  in  PG 
concentration from 0-6 hours, of minimum PG levels, and the 0-6 hour PG profiles was affected, and it 
is  most  relevant  to  consider  the  pharmacodynamic  endpoints  covering  the  first  2  hours  of  the  meal

test.  In  the  children  group,  2  subjects  (16.7%)  received  an  intervention,  as  did  1  (7.7%)  adolescent 
subject.

Glucose-lowering effect by age group 
Analyses  of  the  pharmacodynamic  endpoints  showed  no  statistically  significant  difference  in  the 
glucose-lowering effect of NovoRapid between children and adults or between adolescents and adults. 
The estimated mean changes in PG during the first and second hours (ΔPGav,0-1h and ΔPGav,0-2h) of the 
meal  test  tended  to  be  larger  in  children  and  adolescents  than  in  adults,  although  these  differences

were  not  statistically  significant  (Table  4).  These  patterns  were  further  supported  by  the  estimated 
mean PG level at 1 hour and at 2 hours. 
Table 4 Statistical analysis of plasma glucose lowering endpoints (1 and 2 hours), 
NovoRapid 
As  shown  in  Table  5,  ΔPGmax  in  children  following  treatment  with  NovoRapid  was  not  statistically 
significantly  different  to  that  in  adults  (Fieller  age  group  ratio  1.24  [0.90;1.71]95%  CI),  but  was 
statistically  significantly  greater  in  adolescents  compared  to  adults  (Fieller  age  group  ratio  1.32 
[1.01;1.78]95% CI). 
The  observed  mean  time  to  reach  maximum  PG  concentration  (tPGmax)  with  NovoRapid  was  highly 
variable for children (78.75 minutes; SD 91.38 minutes) and adolescents (173.88 minutes; SD 145.42 
minutes), but there was less variability in the adult group (58.62 minutes; SD 17.83 minutes).

The  high  proportion  of  adults  receiving  glucose  interventions  confounds  meaningful  interpretation  of 
the endpoints ΔPGav,0-6h and PGmin. 
Table  5  Statistical  analysis  of  mean  maximum  plasma  glucose  excursion, 
NovoRapid 
Assessor’s comment: 
The  MAH  concludes  that  the  analyses  of  the  pharmacodynamic  endpoints  showed  no  statistically 
significant  difference  in  the  glucose-lowering  effect  of  NovoRapid  between  children  and  adults  or 
between  adolescents  and  adults  over  the  first  2  hours  of  the  meal  test.  This  conclusion  is  endorsed. 
Due to the need for interventions in the adult group, no firm conclusions can be drawn on the PD data 
beyond 2 hours after dosing. 
The mean maximum plasma glucose excursion was similar in children and adults but was 32% greater 
in adolescents compared to adults (Fieller age group ratio: 1.32 [1.01;1.78]95% CI). 
The findings are in line with previously presented data, also reflected in the SmPC of NovoRapid. 
Safety results 
Extent of exposure 
The dose level for both dosing visits was 0.2 U/kg body weight, and the actual dose (U) was calculated 
using  body  weight  measured  prior  to  the  first  dose  administration  (visit  2).  The  relative  dose  was 
calculated  based  on  the  actual  body  weight  at  the  dosing  visit.  For  each  subject,  the  actual  dose 
remained  the  same  at  both  dosing  visits.  No  subject  experienced  a  body  weight  change  in  excess  of 
5% between dosing visits. On average, children received 8.3 U, adolescents 12.8 U, and adults 15.6 U.

A  treatment  emergent  adverse  event  (TEAE)  was  defined,  for  each  treatment  period,  as  an  AE  with 
onset  in  the  7  day  period  following  first  trial  product  administration.  AEs  were  allocated  to  the  trial 
product last received before onset of the AE. 
There were 11 AEs reported by 9 subjects outside of the treatment period. The majority of these AEs 
(6 events in 6 subjects) occurred before any product had been administered. The remaining 5 events 
(3  subjects)  were  considered  unlikely  related  to  trial  drug  and  were  not  considered  TEAEs  as  they 
occurred outside of the 7-day period following trial product administration.

TEAEs  were reported evenly across the age groups; in total, 7 TEAEs were reported in 5 subjects. Of 
these, 1 event was of moderate severity; the remainder were mild in severity. The SOC  under which 
the greatest number of TEAEs was reported was gastrointestinal disorders (2 TEAEs). All TEAEs were 
single occurrences with no obvious pattern. All TEAEs were resolved by the end of the trial.  
There  were  no  treatment  emergent  SAEs  (including  deaths)  or  medical  events  of  special  interest 
(MESIs). 
In  total,  3  TEAEs  (2  subjects)  were  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  possibly  related  to  a  trial 
product,  both  in  adolescents:  single  events  of  vomiting,  nausea  and  pyrexia.  All  subjects  recovered 
from the TEAEs reported in the trial. No subject withdrew from the trial due to an AE. 
No  adverse  events  related  to  abnormal  vital  signs  or  other  safety  assessment  evaluations  were 
reported during this trial. 
Assessor’s comment: 
The  number  of  AEs  was  low  and  relatively  evenly  distributed  between  age  groups.  No  new  safety 
concerns arise from the reported data. 
Hypoglycaemia 
In total, 11 treatment emergent hypoglycaemic episodes were reported by 9 subjects during the trial 
(Table  8).  There  were  7  documented  symptomatic  episodes  and  4  asymptomatic  episodes.  Two 
episodes  were  confirmed  hypoglycaemia  according  to  the  Novo  Nordisk  definition,  and  occurred  in 
adults.  Most  hypoglycaemic  episodes  (8)  were  experienced  by  adults,  possibly  reflecting  the  lower 
relative  amount  of  standardised  meal  administered  compared  to  that  administered  to  children  and 
adolescents. Most episodes (90%) were reported after 2 hours following administration. 
Sixteen subjects received glucose interventions due to low PG levels: 3 children, 1 adolescent and 12 
adults.  The  majority  of  the  interventions  occurred  after  120  minutes  post-treatment.  Interventions 
were  made  for  both  treatment  groups,  and  any  apparent  imbalance  between  treatments  in  an  age 
group is considered to be due to the low number of subjects and episodes.  
There were no severe treatment emergent hypoglycaemic episodes.

Assessor’s comment: 
Most of the hypoglycaemias observed occurred in adults. The MAH proposes that this reflects the lower 
relative  amount  of  standardised  meal  administered  compared  to  that  administered  to  children  and 
adolescents, which appears adequate. The majority of events (10/11) were observed between 2 and 5 
hours after dosing. No severe treatment emerging hypoglycaemic events were reported. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Data  from  trial  NN1218-3888  has  been  submitted  in  accordance  with  Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC) 
No1901/2006. The study was conducted as part of the currently ongoing development programme for 
a new faster-acting insulin aspart formulation and NovoRapid was selected as comparator.  
In  this  report,  only  data  relevant  for  the  assessment  of  efficacy  and  safety  of  NovoRapid  in  the 
paediatric  population  is  discussed.  Evaluation  of  the  full  clinical  trial  report  will  be  conducted  at 
submission of the marketing authorisation application for faster-acting insulin aspart. 
Insulin  aspart  was  rapidly  absorbed  in  all  patient  groups.  Total  exposure  was  40%  lower  in  children 
and 25% lower in adolescents compared to the adult group. Cmax was 9% lower in both children and 
adolescents  compared  to  adult  patients.  This  is  not  completely  consistent  with  the  results  from 
previously  reported  data  which  showed  higher  AUC  and  Cmax  in  children  and  adolescents  than  in 
adults.  The  paediatric  studies  are  however  relatively  small  which  may  explain  the  inter-study 
differences. The age of the patients included in the current study was also rather narrow (children 9-11 
years,  adolescents  13-17  years  and  adults  18-25  years)  and  not  entirely  representative  of  the  full 
populations.   
The Applicant concludes that in general, the pharmacokinetic responses were similar to adults, which is 
in  agreement  with  previous  observations.  This  is  endorsed.  The  differences  between  children  and 
adults have previously been considered not to be clinically relevant since insulin is individually titrated. 
This conclusion remains. 
The  analyses  of  the  pharmacodynamic  endpoints  showed  no  statistically  significant  difference  in  the 
glucose-lowering  effect  of NovoRapid  between  children  and  adults  or  between  adolescents  and  adults 
over  the  first  2  hours  of  the  meal  test.  Due  to  the need  for  interventions  in  the  adult  group,  no  firm 
conclusions  can  be  drawn  on  the  PD  data  beyond  2  hours  after  dosing.  The  mean  maximum  plasma 
glucose excursion was similar in children and adults but was 32% greater in adolescents compared to 
adults (Fieller age group ratio: 1.32 [1.01;1.78]95% CI). 
The  PD  findings  presented  with  this  submission  are  in  line  with  previously  presented  data,  also 
reflected in the SmPC of NovoRapid.  
No new safety concerns arise from the reported data. Most of the hypoglycaemias observed occurred in 
adults, probably due to the lower relative amount of standardised meal administered compared to that 
administered  to  children  and  adolescents.  No  severe  treatment  emerging  hypoglycaemic  events  were 
reported. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
The  data  presented  is  in  line  with  previously  presented  PK/PD  data  for  NovoRapid  in  children  and 
adolescents. No new safety concerns arise from the reported data. No updates to the PI are needed.

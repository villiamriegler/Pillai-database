Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Translarna 
ataluren 
On 31 May 2018, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion 
recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Translarna. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is PTC Therapeutics 
International Limited. 
The CHMP adopted an extension to the existing indication as follows2: 
"Translarna is indicated for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy resulting from a nonsense 
mutation in the dystrophin gene, in ambulatory patients aged 5 2 years and older (see section 5.1). 
Efficacy has not been demonstrated in non-ambulatory patients. 
The presence of a nonsense mutation in the dystrophin gene should be determined by genetic testing 
(see section 4.4)." 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to 
the marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission. 
1 Summaries of positive opinion are published without prejudice to the Commission decision, which will normally be issued 67 
days from adoption of the opinion

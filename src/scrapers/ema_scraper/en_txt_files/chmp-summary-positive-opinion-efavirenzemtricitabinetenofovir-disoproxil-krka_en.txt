Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka 
efavirenz / emtricitabine / tenofovir disoproxil 
On 14 December 2017, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a 
positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka, intended for the treatment of HIV infection. The 
applicant for this medicinal product is KRKA, d.d., Novo mesto. 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka contains as active substances the antiretrovirals 
efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil (ATC code: J05AR06). The medicine will be 
available as film-coated tablets (600 mg/200 mg/245 mg). Efavirenz activity is mediated by non-
competitive inhibition of HIV reverse transcriptase, while emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil are 
substrates and competitive inhibitors of HIV reverse transcriptase. After phosphorylation, they are 
incorporated into the viral DNA chain, resulting in chain termination.  
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka is a generic of Atripla, which has been authorised 
in the EU since 13 December 2007. Studies have demonstrated the satisfactory quality of 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka and its bioequivalence to the reference product 
Atripla. A question and answer document on generic medicines can be found here. 
The full indication is:  
"Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka is a fixed-dose combination of efavirenz, 
emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil. It is indicated for the treatment of human 
immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection in adults aged 18 years and over with virologic 
suppression to HIV-1 RNA levels of < 50 copies/ml on their current combination 
antiretroviral therapy for more than three months. Patients must not have experienced 
virological failure on any prior antiretroviral therapy and must be known not to have 
harboured virus strains with mutations conferring significant resistance to any of the three 
components contained in Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka prior to 
initiation of their first antiretroviral treatment regimen. 
The demonstration of the benefit of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil is primarily

based on 48-week data from a clinical study in which patients with stable virologic 
suppression on a combination antiretroviral therapy changed to 
efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil. No data are currently available from clinical 
studies with efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil in treatment-naïve or in heavily 
pretreated patients.  
No data are available to support the combination of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir 
disoproxil and other antiretroviral agents." 
It is proposed that Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka be prescribed by physicians 
experienced in the management of HIV infection. 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) 
and made available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has 
been granted by the European Commission.

Introduction 
Rheumatoid  arthritis (RA)  is  a common,  chronic,  inflammatory  disorder  of the joints  predominantly 
affecting  young  adults  and  premenopausal  women.  The  disease  is  characterized  by  a  progressive 
inflammatory  synovitis  manifested  by  polyarticular  joint  swelling  and  tenderness.  The  synovitis 
results in erosion of articular cartilage and marginal bone with subsequent joint destruction. This bony 
destruction is thought to be irreversible. There is no known cure for RA. 
Rheumatoid  arthritis  produces  substantial  morbidity  and  increased  mortality.  Specifically,  pain, 
swelling and stiffness in multiple joints is the hallmark of the disease. Analgesics are usually required 
on a chronic basis. Within 2 years of diagnosis, patients usually experience moderate disability; and 
after  10  years  30%  are  severely  disabled.  In  addition  to  loss  of  employment,  this  disability  often 
compromises the ability of patients to undertake their activities of daily living and can impact sexual 
and social functioning.  
Cytokines,  hormone-like  proteins  that  allow  cells  to  communicate,  play  critical  roles  in  normal 
biologic  processes,  such  as  cell  growth,  inflammation  and  immunity.  Two  inflammatory  cytokines, 
tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1), are critical in the progression of inflammatory 
synovitis  and  articular  matrix  degradation,  and  therefore  represent  promising  targets  for  therapeutic 
intervention  in  RA.  Clinical  experience  with  agents  that  block  TNF  activity  demonstrate  the  central 
role for this cytokine in the pathogenesis of RA and other autoimmune diseases 
Adalimumab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. 
Adalimumab binds specifically to TNF and neutralizes the biological function of TNF by blocking its 
interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. 
Humira is indicated for:  
“the treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients when the response to 
disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs including methotrexate has been inadequate. 
To  ensure  maximum  efficacy,  Humira  is  given  in  combination  with  methotrexate.  Humira  can  be 
given  as  monotherapy  in  case  of  intolerance  to  methotrexate  or  when  continued  treatment  with 
methotrexate is inappropriate.” 
The recommended dose of adalimumab for adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis is 40 mg (per 0.8 
ml,  in  a  vial  or  prefilled  syringe)  given  every  other  week  as  a  subcutaneous  injection.  Methotrexate 
(MTX),  glucocorticoids,  salicylates,  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs),  or  analgesics 
may be continued during treatment with adalimumab.

Part II: Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Composition 
Humira is presented as a vial, or a single-use prefilled syringe, containing 40 mg of active substance in 
0.8 ml of a buffered solution comprised of mannitol, citric acid monohydrate, sodium citrate, disodium 
phosphate  dihydrate,  sodium  dihydrogen  phosphate  dihydrate,  sodium  chloride,  and  Polysorbate  80.

Development pharmaceutics  
Studies  conducted  for  optimisation  of  the  commercial  formulation  included  accelerated  stability  to 
demonstrate  that  a  50  mg/ml  concentration  formulated  with  phosphate  and  citrate  buffers  provides 
sufficient  chemical  stability  at  an  acceptable  pH  for  injection.  Mannitol  and  sodium  chloride  were 
added  to  achieve  the  correct  tonicity.The  amount  of  Polysorbate  80  was  optimized  to  minimise  the 
formation  of  aggregates,  as  well  as  sub-visible  and  visible  particles  during  agitated  and  freeze-thaw 
conditions. 
Active substance 
The  active substance is adalimumab, a recombinant monoclonal antibody directed to human TNF-α. 
Adalimumab is an IgG antibody composed of two kappa light chains each with a molecular weight of 
approximately 24 kDa and two IgG1z,  a heavy chains each with a molecular weight of approximately 
49 kDa. The total molecular weight of adulimumab is 148 kDa. Each light chain consists of 214 amino 
acid residues and each heavy chain consists of 451 amino acid residues.  
Development Genetics 
Adalimumab can be considered “fully human” in the sense that the coding gene sequences contain no 
elements cloned from any other species. 
Data on the isolation and maturation of the human sequences and on the construction and verification 
of the expression vector are well described and are acceptable.  
The expression vector contains sequences for the variable regions obtained via phage display library 
methodology and sequences containing the human IgG constant domains. The nucleotide sequences of 
the final expression vector was confirmed by DNA sequencing.  
The stable integration of the transfected sequences in the production cell line was concluded from the 
analyses of the number of integration sites (Southern Blot), copy number (Southern Blot), mRNA size 
(Northern  Blot)  and  the  integrity  of  the  coding  sequences  (cDNA  sequencing).  These  tests  were 
performed on cells from the MCB and on Post Production Cells. WCB testing included the analysis of 
mRNA and copy number.  
Cell Bank System 
A clone adapted to growth under serum-free conditions was used for establishment of the Master Cell 
Bank. 
The  preparation,  storage  and  safety  testing  of  the  MCB,  WCB  and  PPCB  are  adequately  described. 
Two  WCB’s  have  been  prepared.  For  the  establishment  or  storage  of  the  second  WCB  no  animal 
derived raw materials were used. Information on the preparation, control and characterisation of cell 
banks to be used in commercial production has been given.  
Production of the active substance 
The active substance is manufactured by Abbott Bioresearch Center, Worcester, MA, USA. 
Cell culture  
The active ingredient is produced by cell culture using Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells in media 
with no human or animal derived components. Expansion of the CHO cell culture from a single vial of 
the  WCB  is  accomplished  by  sub-cloning  into  spinner  flasks  of  increasing  size.  When  reaching  a 
suitable level for inoculation, cells are transferred to the seed fermentor for the final expansion before 
seeding  the  production  bioreactor.  After  an  additional  cultivation,  production  medium  is  added  to 
increase the culture volume to final batch size.

Descriptions  are  provided  of  each  fermentation  step  and  the  in-process  control  tests  performed  are 
listed  along  with  their  limits  set  for  specification.  Holding  times  of  intermediates,  operation 
parameters  and  quality  of  raw  materials  are  adequately  defined.  The  description  provided  on  the 
working facilities as well as of the procedures for preparation of buffers and media is satisfactory.  
Purification 
Adalimumab is purified through several chromatography steps and is subject to low pH treatment and 
nanofiltration for virus inactivation/removal. 
Descriptions  are  provided  of  each  individual  step  and  the  in-process  control  tests  carried  out 
throughout  purification  are  listed  along  with  their  limits  set  for  specification.  Representative  elution 
profiles are shown. The range in operation parameters for each step is defined and conditions used for 
regeneration/storage  of  columns  are  specified.  Procedures  for  the  preparation  and  control  of  buffers 
are adequate. 
Characterisation of the active substance 
Extensive  physico-chemical  tests  and  biological  and  immunological  studies  have  been  performed  to 
characterise adalimumab. 
As seen for other recombinant antibodies, adalimumab is present in three major forms, corresponding 
to molecules carrying two, one or no C-terminal lysine. In adalimumab preparationsthese three main 
components  constitute  only  around  85%  of  the  material.  The  rest,  representing  approx.  15  %  of  the 
active substance, elutes as a number of poorly resolved peaks in the ion exchange HPLC assay.  
Although these more acidic species have been isolated from the three major forms of the antibody and 
subjected  to  extensive  characterisation  using  state-of-the-art  techniques,  it  has  not  been  possible  to 
correlate  the  shift  in  mobility  to  changes  in  the  antibody  structure.  Since  these  species  cannot  be 
resolved by traditional analytical methods e.g. SDS PAGE it is likely that the structural differences are 
minor, with no influence shown on TNF-α binding in in vitro model systems. The fermentation step is 
critical for the formation of the acidic species and an in-process control has been set at this stage. The 
separation for quantification into  regions  based on  their relative  retention time in the  WCX-analysis 
constitutes  an  acceptable  means  of  controlling  these  species  in  release  specifications  and  for 
monitoring the stability of the product.  
The applicant has committed to perform post-licensing studies to map structural changes involved in 
the temperature-dependent conversion of the Lys-0, Lys-1, and Lys-2 forms of the adalimumab into 
the more acidic species in the WCX-10 analysis. Based on this information, structural differences and 
similarities  between degradation products and  the acidic species  formed during fermentation will be 
identified. 
The  monitoring  of  product-related  impurities  that  may  arise  in  production  or  storage  of  the  drug 
substance performed on a routine basis is considered acceptable.  
In conclusion, taking into account the consistency of levels of acidic species during fermentation, the 
in-process  controls  during  fermentation  and  the  quantitative  control  of  the  acidic  species  during 
release testing of the active substance, the CPMP considered that the proposed specification for testing 
of the active substances are adequate. 
Stability of the active substance 
Based on the applicant’s presented data, a shelf life of 18 months for active substance stored at -80 °C 
or between -20 to -25 °C is supported.

Other ingredients 
All excipients used for the formulation of the product in pre-filled syringes or in vials are tested for 
compliance with Ph.Eur monographs. Certificates of analysis for each component have been provided. 
Product development and finished product 
Manufacturing Process 
Manufacture  of  the  finished  product  is  performed  at  Vetter  Pharma-Fertigung,  GmbH,  Ravensburg, 
Germany and Dr. Madaus GmbH, in Wasserburg, Germany.  Filled syringes and vials are labelled and 
packaged by Vetter Pharma-Fertigung, GmbH, Ravensburg Germany.  
Excipients are introduced in the active substance manufacturing process by diafiltration in the last step 
before  filling  of  the  bulk.  Manufacturing  of  finished  product  includes  dilution  of  the  bulk  active  
substance  with  an  identical  solution  of  excipients  to  achieve  the  target  active  concentration  of  50 
mg/ml.  This  is  followed  by  sterile  filtration,  aseptic  dispensing  and  closure  in  pre-sterilised  type  I 
glass syringes or vials in a controlled environment. Both processes use standard sterile filtration and 
filling  unit  operations  under  controlled  conditions  with  in  process  controls  including  holding  time 
prior to filtration, filter integrity and fill weight.  
Validation of the process 
The  validation  of  the  manufacturing  process  for  drug  product  is  based  on  extended  in  process  test 
control  during  commercial  scale  production  of  four  batches  of  pre-filled  syringes  (Vetter  Pharma-
Fertigung,  GmbH)  and  three  batches  of  vials  (Dr.  Madaus  GmbH).  The  in  process  testing  included 
control of critical steps such as mixing and microbial control as well as product purity and biological 
activity over the defined maximum time duration in manufacture. 
The studies for validation of the manufacturing process are well designed and reported. All deviations 
to  the  protocols  are  discussed  in  separate  sections,  and  in  most  cases,  the  corrective  actions  appear 
well funded.  
Finished product specifications (batch release and shelf-life) 
Analytical methods used for the release control and for the monitoring of the stability of drug product 
are  satisfactorily  validated.  All  batches  analysed  met  all  specifications  set  for  release  of  finished 
product. Historical batch data are provided to support both product presentations. 
Stability tests on the finished product 
The  data  presented  for  each  presentations  are  consistent  and  confirm  the  stability  of  the  finished 
product and support the proposed shelf life of 18 months, storage at 2-8 °C. 
Viral Safety 
No animal derived materials are used in the manufacture of adalimumab for commercial distribution. 
Primatone  RL  derived  from  bovine  sources  and  amino  acids  from  human  hair,  poultry  feathers  and 
bovine/porcine  sources  were  used  in  the  preparation  of  the  MCB  and  the  first  WCB.  Satisfactory 
information has been provided to demonstrate the TSE compliance. For the preparation of the second 
WCB and for commercial production only material derived from bacteria, yeast or soybeans will be 
used.  The  recombinant  insulin  used  as  additive  to  the  tissue  culture  media  is  registered  in  its  final 
dosage form in the US. 
The testing performed for safety control of the MCB and PPCB included species-specific virus assays 
(MAP  with  LCM  challenge,  HAP),  in  vitro  virus  assays,  in  vivo  virus  assays,  bovine  virus  screen, 
retroviruses, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), reverse transcriptase, co-cultivation with mink

lung cells, co-cultivation with human RD cells, mycoplasma, sterility, and isoenzyme analysis. Non-
infectious Type A retroviral particles were observed, as is typical for CHO cells. No other evidence of 
microbial  or  viral  contamination  was  found.  Safety  testing  of  the  WCB  was  less  extensive  and 
included  species-specific  virus  assays  (MAP  with  LCM  challenge,  HAP),  in  vitro  virus  assays, 
mycoplasma, sterility, and isoenzyme analysis. No evidence of microbial or viral contamination was 
found. Results from the safety testing of the cell banks are presented.  
Every lot of unprocessed bulk harvest is tested for the presence of virus and includes species-specific 
virus  assays  (HAP,  MAP  with  LCM  challenge),  in  vitro  virus  assays,  transmission  electron 
microscopy  (TEM),  mycoplasma,  sterility,  and  Q-PCR  for  MVM.    The  studies  demonstrating 
specificity, sensitivity and robustness of the MVM PCR method have been provided. 
Scaled-down  models  of  process  steps  were  used  for  validation  of  virus  removal/inactivation.  The 
validation studies are generally well performed. Calculations of the reduction factor  have been done 
according  to  recommendations  in  the  EU  guideline.  As  expected  the  purification  process  showed  a 
limited clearance values for small non-enveloped virus such as MVM.  
Therefore,  each  harvest  will  be  tested  for  the  presence  of  viruses  and  a  specific  assay  (Q-PCR)  has 
been introduced to detect MVM. 
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Humira is presented as a single-use prefilled syringe, or a vial, containing 40 mg of active substance in 
0.8 ml of a citrate/phosphate buffered solution. The formulation also contains Polysorbate 80. 
The  active substance is adalimumab, a recombinant monoclonal antibody directed to human TNF-α. 
Adalimumab is an IgG antibody composed of two kappa light chains each with a molecular weight of 
approximately 24 kDa and two IgG1z,  a heavy chains each with a molecular weight of approximately 
49 kDa for a total molecular weight of 148 kDa. 
The  manufacturing  process  of  both  the  active  substance  and  the  finished  products  is  generally  well 
described  and  adequately  controlled.  The  results  show  consistency  of  the  manufacturing  process. 
Appropriate specifications have been set to control the active substance and finished product, both at 
release and at the end-of-shelf life. A shelf life has been agreed of 18 months at –80°C and –20°C for 
the active substance, and of 18 months at 2-8°C for the finished product. 
The  characterisation  studies  of  the  active  substance  showed  the  presence  of  approx.  15  %  of  acidic 
species. The fact that the acidic species have not been fully characterised was not considered by the 
CPMP as a major shortcoming to the quality part of the dossier or to the quality of the product for the 
following reasons: 
-  Historical  batch  data  showed  that  there  are  no  significant  differences  in  the  total  amount  of  acidic 
peak material between batches from commercial production and those used in the clinical trials; 
- Consistency of production of these acidic species during the fermentation is controlled by in-process 
controls; 
- Consistency of acidic species in the active substance is controlled by routine release tests. 
The capacity of the production process to eliminate/inactive viruses has been presented. Each harvest 
will be tested for the presence of viruses and a Q-PCR assay has been introduced to detect MVM. No 
animal  derived  materials  are  used  in  the  manufacture  of  adalimumab  for  commercial  production. 
Satisfactory  information  has  been  provided  to  demonstrate  TSE  compliance  for  the  materials  of 
ruminant origin used during the production of the MCB or WCB.

Part III: Toxico-pharmacological aspects 
Pharmacodynamics 
In vitro and in vivo studies  
• 
Binding  of  adalimumab  to  soluble  recombinant  human  (rh)TNFα  was  saturable  and  concentration-
dependent (Kd 5.8 – 8.7 10-11). Binding to pro-TNFα (transmembrane TNFα), was also demonstrated. 
Additional  in  vitro  studies  showed  that  adalimumab  inhibited  the  binding  of  rhTNFα  to  both  TNFα 
receptors  (p55  and  p75;  IC50  10-9  -10-10M).  It  also  inhibited  hTNFα-induced  expression  of  adhesion 
molecules (IC50 1-2 10-10M). Specificity of adalimumab for rhTNFα was supported by demonstrating 
binding  to  human  TNFα,  but  not  human  TNFβ  and  a  number  of  different  cytokines.  In  vitro, 
adalimumab  bound  to  Fc  receptors  of  human  cells,  indicating  that  the  immunoglobulin  effector 
functions of adalimumab were intact. 
In  vitro,  adalimumab  is  a  potent  inhibitor  of  TNFα  from  human,  various  primates  including 
cynomolgus monkey, and dog (IC50s 10-10 –10-11 M). Neutralisation of murine TNFα was considerably 
weaker  (>2.0  x  10-7),  and  adalimumab  did  not  bind  rat  TNFα.    However,  in  vitro  assays  revealed 
staining of structures in the cytoplasm of vascular smooth muscle in human tissues but not in tissues 
from  cynomolgus  monkey,  which  somewhat  limits  of  the  monkey  as  a  model  for  human  safety 
assessment. Due to the low affinity for mouse TNFα as well as the rapid development of murine anti-
human  antibodies  [MAHA],  the  relevance  of  mouse  as  a  species  for  human  safety  assessment  is 
considered low.  
Using fresh animal complement source, adalimumab induced lysis of transfected cells over-expressing 
pro-  TNFα.  Whether  this  has  any  relevance  in  vivo  is  unknown.  No  complement  –related  tissue 
injuries  have  been  seen  in  the  animal  studies,  which  provides  some  reassurance.  In  a  pharmacology 
study  in  the  Tg5453  mouse  model  (expressing  a  transgene  that  encodes  human  pro-TNFα) 
adalimumab  derived  variants  with and  without  effector functions  were equally potent.  However, the 
ability  to activate  human  complement  has not  been  studied. The relevance  of these  data for humans 
with RA is unknown.  
In  vivo,  adalimumab  inhibited  hTNFα-induced  lethality  in  D-galactosamine  sensitised  mice  and 
hTNFα-induced pyrexia in rabbits. Moreover, it prevented development of arthritis in two transgenic 
mouse  models,  the  Tg197  (expressing  a  soluble  human  TNFα  transgene)  and  Tg5453  (expressing  a 
transgene that encodes human pro-TNFα), serving as disease models of polyarthritis. ED50 values were 
in between 0.1-0.5 mg/kg. 
General and safety pharmacology programme  
• 
A  number  of  general  pharmacology/safety  pharmacology  studies  were  performed  focussing  on  the 
CNS,  cardiovascular  system,  GI  tract,  renal  function,  female  uterus,  local  anaesthesia,  and  in  vitro 
studies  with  human  blood.  Several  of  these  used  rats/rat  tissues,  or  guinea  pig  /tissues.  Since 
adalimumab did not bind rat TNFα, and there are no data on the affinity of adalimumab for guinea pig 
TNFα, these studies are of limited value. The studies in dogs (CV effects) and with human blood are 
considered more relevant. There were no findings in these studies that raise any clinical concerns.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
• 
No specific studies were performed. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Analyses  of  adalimumab  and  of  anti-adalimumab  antibodies  (MAHA  or  primate  anti  human 
antibodies  [PAHA])  were  made  by  ELISAs.  These  methods  were  adequately  validated,  and 
demonstrated to be sensitive and specific. However, these assays can only detect free adalimumab or 
free,  non-complexed  MAHA/PAHA.  Thus,  presence  of  adalimumab  interfered  with  the  analyses  of 
6/25 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MAHA/PAHA; and vice versa. These assay limitations reduce the reliability of the pharmacokinetic 
data and the possibility to assess systemic exposure in the toxicity studies. 
Conventional  studies  addressing  protein  binding,  metabolism  or  excretion  of  adalimumab  were  not 
performed.  The  lack  of  such  studies  is  acceptable  for  this  type  of  compound.  Placental  transfer  was 
demonstrated in the developmental study in monkeys.  
Data  from  in  vitro  human  tissue  binding  studies  showed  that  adalimumab  stained  with  filamentous 
structures in the cytoplasm of vascular smooth muscle and of other cells with contractile properties, in 
a number of tissues. Further investigations indicated that the staining could be reduced by human TNF 
or human serum. The Applicant has provided limited support that under physiological conditions the 
cytoplasm would not be accessible, and that no staining was observed in any structure of any human 
tissue that would be accessible to circulating therapeutic antibodies. Thus, the in vivo relevance of this 
finding is uncertain. 
In  mice  and  monkeys,  the  pharmacokinetics  of  adalimumab  were  linear  as  long  as  anti-adalimumab 
antibodies were absent. However, both MAHA and PAHA developed after single doses, and affected 
the elimination. Moreover, analyses of biological activity of serum samples showed that PAHA were 
neutralising. Thus, parameters such as clearance and half-life could not be determined with certainty. 
In general though, elimination was slow in both species (t1/2 about 14 –21 days in monkeys).  
Toxicology 
The  toxicology  program  included  studies  of  single  and  repeat  dose  toxicity,  genotoxicity, 
developmental toxicity and local tolerance. Adalimimab was generally administered via the i.v. route, 
while the intended clinical route is s.c. administration. This is not considered to hamper the assessment 
of toxicity.  
Single dose toxicity: 
• 
The data derived from studies performed in mice and rats after i.v. administration show that in rodents, 
a single dose of Adalimumab appears to be well tolerated up to a dose of almost 2000 times higher 
than the single human dose, the target organ of toxicity in rat was the spleen.  
Repeat dose toxicity: 
• 
The studies in cynomolgus monkeys are considered most relevant for human safety assessment. Repeat 
dose toxicity studies of 4 weeks (32 – 157 mg/kg bw) and 39 weeks (32- 215 mg/kg bw) duration were 
performed.  Overall,  no  major  toxicological  concerns  were  identified.  As  expected,  TNFα  inhibition 
resulted in effects on organs of the immune system, including thymus (decreased weight, involution, 
reduced  lymphocytes,  cystic  transformation)  and  spleen  (reduced  activation  and  cellularity  of  the 
follicular centre). Immunohistochemical analyses confirmed effects on various immune cells in these 
organs.  In  the  39  weeks  study,  most  of  these  changes  were  reversible  within  the  20-week  recovery 
period. In this study, the NOAEL was 32 mg/kg, with an AUC of 304 800 µg*h/ml.  
There  is  a  vast  amount  of  published  literature  from  preclinical  models  that  demonstrates  the  role  of 
TNFα  in  the  protective  immune  responses  against  various  infective  agents.  There  are  also  data 
showing  that  administration  of  anti-TNFα  monoclonal  antibodies  reduced  host  defence,  which  in  a 
number  of  cases  lead  to  enhancement  of  infection-induced  mortality.  The  clinical  experience  with 
authorised  anti-TNF  therapies  clearly  confirms  a  reduced  defence  against  infections  as  the  main 
adverse effect of such treatment.  
After 39 but not 4 weeks, deposition of immune complexes, was observed in isolated glomeruli in the 
kidneys  of  most  animals  give  215  mg/kg  bw.  There  were  no  inflammatory  reactions,  or  functional 
changes observed in association with these deposits.  
One  problem  has  been  identified.  In  both  the  4  and  39  weeks  primate  studies,  low  levels  of 
adalimumab  were  detected  in  control  monkeys.  PAHA  analyses  from  samples  in  the  4  weeks  study 
revealed  PAHAs  in  7  out  of  10  controls.  Despite  careful  investigation  no  evident  reason  for 
7/25 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
contamination  has  been  identified;  several  measures  to  reassure  adequate  conduct  of  the  study  had 
been taken. The explanation of the possible contamination may be plausible.  
The available toxicokinetic data show exposure of animals to adalimumab during the toxicity studies, 
in  considerable  excess  of  humans  given  intended  therapy.  Development  of  PAHAs  could  not  be 
determined  in  these  animals  due  to  assay  limitations,  but  cannot  be  excluded.  However,  high 
concentrations  of  adalimumab  were  detected  in  samples  from  treated  animals  throughout  the  study, 
which support that PAHAs had not markedly neutralised the adalimumab activity during the study.  
•  Genotoxicity: 
The genotoxic potential of adalimumab was tested in vitro by gene mutations in bacteria and in vivo in 
the mouse micronucleus test. No genotoxic effects were seen. This is not a complete genotoxicity test 
battery  (see  CPMP/ICH/174/95,  S2B).  However,  for  a  monoclonal  antibody,  genotoxicity  tests  are 
considered to be of limited value and are therefore not needed (CPMP/ICH/302/95, S6).  
Carcinogenicity:  
• 
No  carcinogenicity  study  was  performed  with  adalimumab.  The  lack  of  such  studies  is  justified 
because there is no conventional or alternative model available, (i.e  adalimumab has low/no affinity 
for mouse/rat TNFα, and MAHA developed after single doses). Adalimumab had no genotoxic effects, 
and no atypical tissue changes were seen in the 39 weeks monkey study. It is agreed that there is no 
indication  of  a  direct  carcinogenic  effect  of  an  anti-TNFα  antibody.  However,  the  consequences  of 
long-term  immunosuppression  are  unknown  and  an  increased  risk  of  a  poorer  control  of  nascent 
tumours cannot be ruled out. The lack of carcinogenicity studies has been reflected in the SPC. 
Reproduction Toxicity:  
• 
Effects on male fertility have not been studied. In females, no study beyond the developmental toxicity 
study  in  cynomolgus  monkey  has  been  performed.  Generally,  fertility  studies  are  performed  in 
rodents.  However,  neither  the  rat  nor  the  mouse  is  considered  as  particularly  relevant  models  for 
human  safety  assessment.  The  human  tissue  cross-reactivity  studies  and  the  histopathological 
evaluation  of  male  and  female  reproductive  organs  in  the  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies  in  monkeys 
revealed  no  cause  for  concern.  Whether  long-term  inhibition  of  TNFα  will  affect  fertility  is  not 
known.  
One  developmental/prenatal  toxicity  study  was  performed  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  (30  or  100 
mg/kg/w,  days  20-97  post  coitum).  Caesarean  section  was  performed  day  100.  Other  females  were 
allowed to deliver and the infants were observed for 1 week. There were no treatment related effects 
on the maternal animals, gestation, parturition, on fetuses or on the infants.  
Available  data  showed  that  fetuses  were  exposed  to  adalimimab,  corresponding  to  5-10%  of  the 
maternal  serum  levels.  Levels  in  amniotic  fluid  were  4-17  fold  lower  than  the  fetal  levels.  PAHAs 
were not measured. Taken together, these data are not sufficient to support the safe use of adalimumab 
in pregnant women.  
The risk of use of adalimumab in pregnant women is unknown. Based on a large amount of published 
data,  it  is  evident  that  TNFα  is  involved  in  embryonic  development.  For  instance,  although 
homozygous  TNFα  deficient  mice  were  viable,  fertile  and  developed  normally  but  the  immune 
function  of  these  mice  was  compromised,  and  they  were  highly  susceptible  to  challenges  with 
infections agents. Thus, inhibition of TNFα may affect the development of the embryo and/ or fetus. 
Thus, adalimumab should not be used during pregnancy. Due to the slow elimination of adalimumab, 
pregnancy should be avoided for an extended period of time after finalisation of treatment. 
Excretion of adalimumab in breast milk has not been studied in either animals or humans. However a 
time period during which pregnancy and breast feeding should be avoided has been proposed to be 5 
months, based on the population PK parameters and their variability, as well as the longest individual 
half-life observed.

•  Local Tolerance:  
In  rabbits,  no  local  intolerance  was  seen  after  administration  of  the  formulation  intended  for 
marketing.  Moreover,  no  effects  at  the  injection  sites  (after  both  i.v.  or  s.c.)  were  seen  in  various 
studies in monkeys.

Clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacodynamics 
(cid:131)  Mechanism of action 
Pharmacodynamic effects expected of a TNF antagonist were shown in in vitro and in vivo preclinical 
studies.  In  patients,  effects  on  relevant  cytokines  (IL-6  and  TNF)  were  demonstrated,  which  were 
qualitatively  similar  to  those  noted  for  other  TNF  antagonists.  A  serum  adalimumab  –  effect 
relationship  could  be  established  for  relevant  parameters  of  disease  symptoms  and  signs.  Table  1 
summarises the clinical pharmacology studies. 
Pharmacokinetics 
After subcutaneous administration of a single 40 mg dose, absorption and distribution of adalimumab 
was  slow,  with  peak  serum  concentrations  being  reached  about  5  days  after  administration.    The 
average absolute bioavailability of adalimumab estimated from three studies following a single 40 mg 
subcutaneous  dose  was  64%.    After  single  intravenous  doses  ranging  from  0.25  to  10 mg/kg, 
concentrations were dose proportional.  After doses of 0.5 mg/kg (~40 mg), clearances ranged from 11 
to 15 ml/hour, the distribution volume (Vss) ranged from 5 to 6 litres and the mean terminal phase half-
life  was  approximately  two  weeks.    Adalimumab  concentrations  in  the  synovial  fluid  from  several 
rheumatoid arthritis patients ranged from 31-96% of those in serum. 
Dose and time dependencies 
The pharmacokinetics of adalimumab are essentially linear, although small deviations occur at higher 
doses than suggested for clinical use.   
Presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies (AAA) and the effect of AAA on the pharmacokinetics 
of adalimumab 
The frequency of AAA positive samples was quite variable among the pharmacokinetic studies (from 
almost zero up to 33% in a study in healthy volunteers). The variability may be partly due to the fact 
that there is interference by adalimumab with the antibody analysis. 
The  median  CL/F  (apparent  clearance)  was  59  and  17  ml/h  in  patients  with  and  without  AAA, 
respectively. This may be a true effect, but the results could also be due to assay artefacts caused by 
possible interference by AAA in the adalimumab analysis.  
Because immunogenicity analyses are product-specific, comparison of antibody rates with those from 
other products is not appropriate. 
Populations at risk 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  adalimumab  have  not  been  studied  in  patients  with  significant  hepatic  or 
renal impairment. There is a trend to decreasing CL with increasing age. No gender differences have 
been observed.

Interactions 
In general, interactions with antibodies are difficult to predict. In MTX treated patients, clearance has 
been  estimated  to  be  44%  lower  (ie  AUC  approximately  doubled)  than  in  patients  not  treated  with 
MTX. 
Clinical efficacy  
Clinical trials were performed according to GCP requirements a stated by the applicant.  
Comparability  
Experience  with  the  formulation  for  marketing  was  obtained  in  a  comparative  single-dose  trial  in 
healthy volunteers, which met bioequivalence criteria for Cmax and AUC in comparison with a clinical 
trials  formulation.  AAA  responses  to  the  two  formulations  tested  were  similar.  Additional  data  on 
comparative  efficacy  and  clinical  safety  were  obtained  in  Open  Label  Extension  trials,  and  did  not 
show obvious differences between the formulation for marketing and the previously used formulation.  
Further  experience  regarding  the  immunogenicity  of  the  final  formulation  will  be  gained  from  the 
post-marketing setting. 
Dose-response studies and main clinical studies 
The  efficacy  and  safety  of  adalimumab  was  mainly  evaluated  in  4  multicentre  randomised  double 
blind placebo controlled studies (DE009, DE011, DE019, and DE031) in rheumatoid arthritis patients. 
The following table summarises some of the characteristics of the clinical studies programme.

Dose response studies 
The  results  of  supportive  Study  DE007  were  used  to  determine  the  doses  for  the  pivotal  studies 
DE009, DE011, DE019 and DE031.  In study DE007, no difference in efficacy was observed between 
patient  groups receiving  adalimumab at 20  mg weekly, 40  mg weekly and 80  mg  weekly at the  12-
week endpoint. Based  on this  finding,  40  mg  every other  week (eow) (equivalent to  20  mg weekly) 
was selected as the middle dose for Study DE009 and the key dose for studies DE019 and DE031.  
Study DE011 continued to explore the  dose-response relationship in patients not taking concomitant 
MTX,  and  is  supported  by  Study  DE007.    Study  DE001/003  further  supported  the  definition  of  the 
dose-response  curve  for  patients  not  taking  concomitant  MTX  by  providing  information  about  the 
plateau of the dose-response curve.   
Among the trials, study DE009 defined the dose-response relationship in patients taking concomitant 
MTX. Therefore, studies DE019 and DE031 did not investigate different dose intensities. The overall 
outcome data from the pivotal trials are presented  in Table 3.  
Overall,  it  appears  reasonably  documented  that  the  proposed  dose  of  40  mg  eow  provides  levels  of 
adalimumab related to a near-maximal response in the majority of patients.  
Main studies (phase III)  
Description of the studies 
1. 
The  efficacy  of  adalimumab  in  the  targeted  indication  has  been  demonstrated  in  four  clinical  trials 
(DE009,  DE011,  DE019,  DE031)  in  adult  patients  with,  on  average,  long-standing,  moderately  to 
severely active RA, and with experience of previous DMARD therapy (adalimumab n=1,368, placebo 
n=685). Patients with significant renal or hepatic disease, underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease of 
significance, history of tuberculosis, immune deficiency, history of malignancy, were not included in 
the studies. 
The following general characteristics applied to the trials: 
•  All trials had at least 24 weeks of double blind treatment phase (DE019 52 weeks). DE 031 was 
primarily a safety study. ACR20 responder rate was the primary signs and symptoms endpoint. 
The primary focus of DE019 was a 52-week X-ray analysis.  
•  All trials were placebo-controlled. There was no comparison with other DMARD. 
•  DE009, DE 011 and DE019 enrolled only patients who had failed at least one DMARD, DE031 
could enroll DMARD-naive patients. Eventually, very few such patients (adalimumab n=21, 
placebo n=21) were recruited. Prior DMARD experience included MTX in almost all patients. 
•  Adalimumab was tested as add-on to MTX (10-25 mg wk, median 15 mg, folate in approximately 
50%) in DE009 and DE019, as monotherapy after washout of all prior DMARD in DE011, and 
concomitantly with any DMARD except Azathioprine, Cyclosporin A or other anti-TNF, or as 
monotherapy in DE 031.  
•  All trials used SC administration of adalimumab. Doses evaluated varied between 20 and 80 mg, 
given every other week or weekly (20-40 mg). 
The difference to placebo in ACR20 responder rate (a 20% improvement in the ACR response criteria) 
at 24-26 weeks was the primary efficacy endpoint trials DE09, DE011, and DE019 and the secondary 
end  point  in  trial  DE031.  Although  at  some  variance  with  the  CPMP  Points  to  Consider  (PtC) 
guidance  document,  ACR20  has  been  generally  accepted  as  primary  efficacy  measure  in  recent 
DMARD procedures. 
ACR50,  ACR70,  HAQ,  SJC,  TJC,  C-reactive  protein,  and  a  number  of  visual  analogue  scores  were 
evaluated  as  secondary  endpoints.  A  number  of  other  measures,  relevant  to  the  medical  impact  of 
adalimumab  on  RA  were  also  included.  Health  related  quality  of  life  was  evaluated  by  secondary 
endpoints of HAQ, SF-36 and in some studies, FACIT-F, MAF, EuroQOL and HUI.

Statistical analysis 
2. 
The  primary  analysis  set  was  mITT  (all  randomised  patients  who  had  received  at  least  one  dose  of 
study  drug)  and  the  basic  analysis  for  ACR  20  was  observed  data,  withdrawals  =  non-responders. 
LOCF was supplementary. This is considered appropriately conservative. In all trials except DE031, 
ACR response was assessed by especially trained joint assessors, blinded to treatment group. 
Continuous efficacy variables were analysed by ANCOVA, using LOCF imputation for missing data. 
In addition to the above, a large number of exploratory subgroup analyses were performed, relating to 
demographic and baseline characteristics. 
RESULTS 
Study populations/accountability of patients 
All confirmatory trials  included  adult  patients only,  and patients  with  chronic  juvenile arthritis were 
excluded. Typically, the study population was characterised by seropositive RA of long duration and 
with moderate (to severe) ongoing activity.  
Efficacy results 
Symptoms and signs variables 
ACR 
The ACR 20 response to adalimumab was superior to placebo in all trials and at all tested doses.  
The  outcomes  for  the  secondary  endpoints  ACR50  and  ACR70  were  consistent  with  the  primary 
analysis.  ACR  outcome  data  from  the  primary  efficacy  trials  and  for  the  dose  proposed  by  the 
Applicant (40 mg eow) are shown in Table 2 below.

As  noted  with  other  anti-TNF  therapies,  the  onset  of  response  was  quick:  ACR20  response  rates  at 
week 1 (DE009) or week 2 (DE011, DE019, and DE031) were significantly greater than placebo for 
all adalimumab doses tested. The data for Humira suggest that ‘responsiveness’ could be determined 
after 12 weeks of treatment since the number of responders increases very little after this time point. 
Non-response was noted in at least 30% of the patients. This information has been included in the SPC 
and is in line with recommendations in recently published consensus documents.

ACR20 parameters 
In  all  four  of  the  confirmatory  studies,  all  individual  components  of  the  ACR  response  criteria 
(number  of tender  and  swollen joints,  physician and  patient assessment  of  disease activity and  pain, 
disability  index  (HAQ)  scores  and  CRP  (mg/dl)  values)  improved  at  24  or  26 weeks  compared  to 
placebo.  SJC  and  TJC  were  reduced  by  40-60%  compared  with  baseline,  significantly  more  so  than 
with placebo in all studies and dose groups. 
Patient’s assessments of pain and disease activity (VAS) were significantly improved vs. placebo at all 
adalimumab  doses,  except  for  the  20  mg  eow  in  DE011.  A  similar  pattern  was  seen  for  physician’s 
assessment of disease activity. 
Mean  CRP  was  significantly  reduced  vs.  placebo  with  adalimumab  at  the  recommended  or  higher 
doses in all trials. 
Disability 
Disability  by  HAQ  (co-primary  analysis  in  DE019  and  secondary  analysis  in  the  other  trials)  is 
summarised in Table 4. A difference of at least 0.22 units is considered clinically relevant. Patients on 
all adalimumab doses in DE009, DE011, DE019, DE031 had a significant mean HAQ response of at 
least 0.22 units that was not reached with placebo. A stricter response criterion of 0.50 units (for which 
there is also published support) was reached with the recommended dose of adalimumab in all studies 
except monotherapy trial DE011. 
Morning  stiffness  was  evaluated  at  24-26  weeks  in  DE011,  DE019,  DE031.  Duration  of  morning 
stiffness was significantly reduced with dose intensities of adalimumab ≥20 mg wk/40 mg eow. 
X-ray analyses 
The  findings  for  the  Total  Sharp  X-ray  Score  (TSS)  from  DE019  given  in  Table  5  show  that 
adalimumab  had  a  significant  effect.  Joint  Space  Narrowing  (JSN)  and  erosion  scores  also  showed 
significant effects of adalimumab.  
The  effects on X-ray findings were (numerically) consistent for a large number of subgroups tested. 
There  was  no  difference  between  ACR20  responders  and  nonresponders  (placebo  or  adalimumab) 
regarding mean or median TSS change over one year. 
Markers of cartilage destruction (proMMP-1, proMMP-3) were analysed in DE019 and DE009. These 
were indicative of effects of adalimumab. 
It  is  acknowledged  that  52-week  data  from  the  ongoing  two-year  trial  DE019  showed  statistically 
significant effects of adalimumab 40 mg eow as add-on to MTX vs. MTX alone on validated measures 
of  structural  joint  damage.  However  at  least  two-year  data  has  been  requested  for  a  therapeutic 
indication of this kind.

Health-related Quality of Life 
A number of HRQoL measures (apart from HAQ) were analysed as secondary variables.  
Potentially clinically important mean changes (≥5 points) from baseline to Week 24 (Studies DE009, 
DE019,  and  DE031)  and  Week 26  (Study  DE011)  in  LOCF  SF-36  PCS  scores  were  shown  in  the 
adalimumab 20 mg wk and 40 mg eow across all 4 studies.  These changes in SF-36 were associated 
with decreases (-0.38 to -0.58) in the disability index of the HAQ. 
LOCF  mean  changes  from  baseline  FACIT  scores  exhibited  associations  with  LOCF  mean  changes 
from baseline SF-36 vitality domain scores.  The adalimumab 40 mg  eow group in the three studies 
that measured FACIT (Studies DE009, DE019, and DE031) showed improvements of 6.9 to 8.1 from 
baseline,  which  corresponded  to  LOCF  mean  increases  from  baseline  in  the  SF-36  vitality  domain 
scores  of  16.0  to  18.3.    Changes  in  MAF  scores  from  Study  DE031  support  this  finding.    Both 
increasing FACIT scores and decreasing MAF scores indicate a reduction of fatigue.   
Immunogenicity and impact on efficacy 
Human antibodies against adalimumab (AAA) were detected and quantified with the help of reference 
anti-adalimumab antibodies from immunised rabbits. The criteria for robust characterisation of AAA-
positivity  were  well  discussedin  the  dossier,  and  cut-off  criteria  used  seem  justified.  These  criteria 
were associated with a false positive rate of approximately 5%. 
In  the  pivotal  trials,  AAA  were  identified  in  58/1,053  (5.5%)  patients  treated  with  adalimumab, 
compared with 2/370 (0.5%) on placebo. In patients not given concomitant MTX, the incidence was 
12.4%, compared with 0.6% when adalimumab was used as add-on to MTX. There was a trend to less 
AAA  development  with  higher  doses  and  more  frequent  administration  of  adalimumab,  noticeable 
especially  when  MTX  was  not  used.  Apart  from  MTX  +/-,  there  were  no  specific  demographic  or 
baseline  variables  associated  with  risk  for  AAA  response.  Few  AAA  +ve  patients  withdrew  due  to 
lack  of  efficacy,  but,  on  average,  AAA-positivity  was  associated  with  a  reduced  response  to 
adalimumab. 
The Applicant suggests that efficacy failure due to AAA on adalimumab 40 mg eow (in patients not 
on concomitant MTX) might be overcome by increasing the dose to 40 mg wk. The support for this 
comes from trial DE007, where 4/4 AAA +ve ACR20 non-responders on 20 mg wk responded when 
the  dose  was  increased  to  40  mg  wk.  Moreover,  data  from  open  label  long  term  extension  studies 
further support this approach. 
In summary, coadministration of adalimumab with MTX reduces the clearance of adalimumab and the 
likelihood  of  AAA formation. The neutralising  effects of AAA  may be reversed with increasing the 
dose intensity to 40 mg weekly For best efficacy adalimumab should be used together with MTX and 
monotherapy should be reserved for situations of intolerance to MTX or when treatment with MTX is 
inappropriate.  
Exploratory analysis performed across trials. 
ACR20  responses  at  24-26  weeks  (pooled  data)  were  further  analysed  for  a  number  of  subgroup 
interactions and the following findings were observed:  
There  was  a  trend  to  decreasing  response  to  adalimumab  40  mg  every  other  week  (eow)  with 
increasing  body  weight  (59.7%  for  patients  ≤60  kg,  compared  with  46.5%  for  patients  85-100  kg). 
Whether the trend observed is clinically relevant or not is debatable.  
There  were  no  differences  in  response  to  adalimumab  over  the  range  of  RA  duration  studied,  with 
regard  to RF status (+/-)  at baseline, or  with  regard to disease activity at baseline  (TJC, SJC, HAQ, 
CRP).  There  was,  however,  a  trend  to  decreasing  response  with  increasing  experience  of  previous 
DMARD therapy (62% for patients exposed to 1 previous DMARD, 49% for patients having taken >4 
17/25

previous  DMARDs).  Drug-disease  interactions  were  studied  for  the  presence  or  absence  of  diabetes 
mellitus, CHF, COPD, hypertension, asthma and renal impairment. Significant interaction (Breslow-
Day)  with  decreased  response  with  presence  of  concomitant  disease  was  seen  for  hypertension  and 
asthma.  The  asthma  group  however  was  small.  The  clinical  relevance  of  the  statistically  significant 
interaction in the group of patients with concomitant hypertension is debatable. 
Drug-drug interactions for concomitant antirheumatic therapy are summarised in Table 6.

  At baseline 
Concomitant use of adalimumab and DMARDs other than MTX was assessed only in DE031 (which 
was not primarily an efficacy study). This is summarised in Table 7, experience of such use is limited. 
The apparently poor outcome with adalimumab plus leflunomide is probably explained by the high 
rate of withdrawals in this group.

Supportive studies 
Clinical Pharmacology Trials: 
Trials  DE001,  DE004,  DE005,  DE007,  DE010  provided  some  supportive  efficacy  data  for  various 
dose regimens of adalimumab. In these trials, altogether 401 patients were exposed to adalimumab. Of 
principal interest are the 12-week placebo-controlled DE004, DE007, which explored SC doses of 20-
80 mg wk. Generally, the ACR20 responses mirrored those described in pivotal trials. 
Long-term trials: 
A  number  of  long-term,  open-label  trials  (DE003,  DE004,  DE005X,  DE007,  DE009X,  DE010, 
DE018,  and  DE020)  are  described,  including  trials  rolling  over  patients  from  the  six-month  pivotal 
trials.  These  include  1,785  patients.  ACR20  is  available  for  up  to  36  months  (n  =134).  Data  are 
consistent regarding maintenance of efficacy on symptoms and signs. 
Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Efficacy on symptoms and signs 
The ACR20 response to adalimumab was superior to placebo in all trials and at all tested doses. The 
outcomes for the secondary endpoints ACR50 and ACR70 were consistent with the primary analysis.  
Additional  support  for  clinically  relevant  efficacy  was  gained  from  outcomes  for  ACR  component 
parameters,  disability  by  HAQ,  morning  stiffness,  and  from  an  array  of  HRQoL  variables.  As  with 
other TNF antagonists, onset of relief of symptoms and signs was rapid, and was maintained for the 
duration of controlled and Open Label Extension (OLE) clinical trials presented. Even at the highest 
dose tested and with concomitant MTX, non-response was noted in at least 30% of patients. Similar 
findings  have  been  made  with  other  TNF  antagonists.  The  Applicant  has  provided  further  analyses 
indicating that the clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks. This has been reflected in the 
SPC. 
Based  on  across-studies  comparisons,  efficacy  of  adalimumab  was  better  with  concomitant  use  of 
MTX (DE009, DE019) than as monotherapy (DE011). This may be explained partly by additive anti-
inflammatory effects of adalimumab and MTX, but appears more likely due to increased exposure to 
adalimumab in the presence of MTX, secondary to reduced AAA-mediated clearance of adalimumab. 
AAA are neutralising on efficacy of adalimumab and appear at much greater incidence when given as 
monotherapy. Additional analyses indicate that in AAA +ve patients, the median long-term signs and 
symptoms  response  to  adalimumab  in  monotherapy  is  near  zero.  Based  on  these  considerations, 
adalimumab should be used primarily in combination with MTX.  
Monotherapy  should  be  reserved  for  patients  intolerant  to  MTX  and  for  situations  when  continued 
therapy with MTX is considered otherwise inappropriate. In monotherapy, available data from Phase 
II and OLE studies indicate potential benefit of increased dose intensity in patients exhibiting loss of 
response to adalimumab at the recommended dose. Appropriate information has been included in the 
SPC.  
Efficacy on joint destruction 
Trial  DE019  provided  12-month  data  on  X-ray  analysis  (modified  Sharp  scores)  of  progression  of 
joint  destruction.  Significant  and  relevant  preventive  effects  were  seen  with  adalimumab  in 
combination  with MTX  vs. MTX  alone,  and  were  of similar  magnitude as have been  observed  with 
other agents of this class. While it is acknowledged that the 52-week data from the ongoing two-year 
trial DE019 showed significant effects of adalimumab 40 mg eow as add-on to MTX vs. MTX alone 
on  validated  measures  of  structural  joint  damage,  at  least  two-year  data  has  been  requested  for  a 
therapeutic indication of this kind.

Adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) 
Generally, the safety profile of adalimumab appears comparable with that of other TNF-antagonists 
Significantly  higher  incidences  of  abdominal  pain,  hypertension  and  headache  were  noted  with 
adalimumab compared with placebo. The reason for this increased incidence is not definitely known. 
This phenomenon has been seen with other therapeutic agents recently approved for the treatment of 
RA  and  the  incidence  of  abdominal  pain  and  headache  reported  during  the  clinical  trials  with 
adalimumab is consistent with these other agents.  
• 
In placebo-controlled trials, the rate of infection was 1 per patient year in the Humira treated patients 
and  0.9 per  patient  year  in  the  placebo-treated  patients.    The  incidence  of  serious  infections  was 
0.04 per patient year in Humira treated patients and 0.02 per patient year in placebo-treated patients.  
The  infections  consisted  primarily  of  upper  respiratory  tract  infections,  bronchitis  and  urinary  tract 
infections.  Most patients continued on Humira after the infection resolved. 
Infections 
In addition, sepsis, tuberculosis and other opportunistic infections were reported in clinical trials with 
adalimumab. Thus, the signal that anti-TNF therapy for RA may be associated with serious infection is 
confirmed for adalimumab. There were some deaths due to infections (see section on ‘Deaths’). 
Overall, adalimumab appears to have class-typical effects on the risk for reactivation of tuberculosis. 
This has been reflected in SPC and PL. A patient alert card (that is a part of the labelling information) 
has been introduced to address the risk of tuberculosis.  
•  Malignancies 
There  is  some  remaining  concern  that  anti-TNF  therapy  may  increase  the  long-term  risk  of 
malignancy  in  RA  patients.  In  the  adalimumab  development  programme,  53  malignancies  were 
diagnosed in 52 patients treated with adalimumab. This included 4 cases of non-Hodgkins lymphoma 
(NHL)  of  variable  histological  types.  There  were  no  cancers,  excluding  two  non-melanoma  skin 
cancers  in  the  placebo  group  (which  contributed  some  13%  of  the  total  observational  experience). 
There was no trend to increased event rate with time on adalimumab and, overall, the incidence rate 
was not significantly different from that expected from NCI SEER data. 
• 
Immunologic reactions 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Thirty-eight  patients  (1.6%  of  2,334  patients)  experienced  AEs  characterised  as  immunologic 
reactions, which included events that were classified as either AEs or SAEs. Four patients receiving 
SC  adalimumab  had  systemic  reactions  that  were  characterised  as  ‘anaphylactoid-type’  reactions. 
These  included  rash,  tachycardia,  dizziness,  fatigue,  oedema,  and  dyspnoea.  At  least  one  of  these 
patients  had  multiple  episodes.  None  of  these  reactions  were  serious  and  all  were  treated  in  the 
20/25 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
outpatient  setting.  Fourteen  patients  developed  rash  that  was  considered  by  the  investigators  to  be 
allergic in nature. Six patients had urticaria-type rashes without other etiology. Two patients had fixed 
drug  eruption  rash,  one  had  a  cutaneous  rash  on  the  abdomen  with  histology  showing  deposition  of 
immunoglobulin and complement. Three other patients had non-specific allergic reactions that could 
not  be  definitively  related  to  another  etiology  with  the  information  that  was  collected.  No  patient 
receiving SC adalimumab required hospitalisation for an anaphylactic-type reaction.  
Injection site reactions (ISR) 
In  placebo-controlled  trials,  20%  of  patients  treated  with  Humira  developed  injection  site  reactions 
(erythema  and/or  itching,  haemorrhage,  pain  or  swelling),  compared  to  14%  of  patients  receiving 
placebo.  There was no relationship between the occurrence of injection site reactions and the presence 
of  AAA.  There  was  a  trend  towards  decreased  rates  of  injection  site  reactions  in  patients  taking 
concomitant  MTX.  Injection  site  reactions  tended  to  be  either  mild  or  moderate  and  rarely  led  to 
discontinuation of therapy. 
Anti-DNA antibodies (ANA) and lupus 
Four adalimumab-treated patients developed illness that was designated by the investigators as lupus-
like in character, and related to study drug.  
In the pivotal trials, ANA titres were determined at baseline (prior to the first dose of adalimumab or 
placebo)  and  at  one  or  more  time  points  during  the  first  12  weeks  of  study  drug,  and  at  the  end  of 
6 months of treatment. After 6 months of treatment with adalimumab, 132 (12.6%) of 1,046 baseline 
negative patients had titres ≥1:80; by comparison, after 6 months of treatment with placebo, 39 (7.3%) 
of 532 baseline negative patients had ANA titres ≥1:80.  
Safety impact of AAA positivity 
As noted above, the rates of AAA formation were different with concomitant MTX (4 of 628 [0.6%]) 
vs. without concomitant MTX (54 of 434 [12.4%]).  
The  impact  of  AAA  on  overall  safety  is  best  analysed  in  DE011,  the  placebo-controlled,  European 
monotherapy trial, which also contained the great majority of AAA +ve cases. There were no major 
differences between groups. For specific AEs, it could be noted that rash, pruritus and injection site 
reaction incidences did not differ between AAA +ve and –ve patients. AAA. 
There  is  no  information  about  the  potential  of  reactivity  between  anti-infliximab  HACA  and 
adalimumab and the implications for patients transferring from infliximab to adalimumab. 
Safety impact of dose interruptions 
No  specific  AE  profile  was  noted  in  the  21  patients  restarted  on  adalimumab  after  >140  days’ 
interruption. 
•  Demyelinating disease 
TNF  antagonist  therapy  has  been  associated  with  exacerbation  of  demyelinating  disease.  During  the 
adalimumab  development  program,  two  RA  patients  and  one  volunteer  developed  demyelinating 
disease. There are no firm indications that the risk with adalimumab is greater than with other products 
in the class.  
•  Haematologic events 
Events associated with myelosuppression or depressed platelet counts are of special concern for anti-
TNF  therapies.  Four  adalimumab-treated  patients  experienced  pancytopenia  or  agranulocytosis.  The 
data  for  patients  who  experienced  CTC  Grade 3  or  4  abnormalities  of  WBC,  neutrophil  numbers 
(recorded  as  neutrophil  percent  or  absolute  neutrophil  count),  or  platelet  count  were  also  evaluated. 
21/25 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There    were  no  reports  of  CTC  Grade 4  leukopenia.  Six  patients  experienced  CTC  Grade 3 
leukopenia, including four patients who also experienced CTC Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. In addition to 
these four patients, seven patients had relative or absolute neutropenia. Grade 3 thrombocytopenia was 
noted  in  one  patient  on  adalimumab.  No  follow-up  data  after  cessation  are  available.  A 
myelosuppressive effect of adalimumab cannot be ruled out. 
•  Congestive heart failure (CHF) 
Only isolated patients with a history of CHF were enrolled to adalimumab trials. Based on previous 
experience with other TNF-antagonists, Humira is contraindicated in moderate to severe heart failure 
(NYHA class III/IV) and should be used with caution in patients with mild heart failure. The patient 
alert card that has been included in the labelling information also addresses the risk of CHF. 
•  Drug-drug interactions 
Concurrent  MTX  increases  exposure  to  adalimumab  by  approximately  40%.  Across  all  study 
groupings,  the  percentage  of  patients  reporting  SAEs  was  slightly  higher  among  patients  not  taking 
concomitant  MTX  than  among  patients  taking  concomitant  MTX.  The  overall  pattern  of  SAEs  was 
generally unaffected by the presence or absence of MTX as a concomitant medication.  
Use of MTX was associated with a decrease in the percentage of immunologic reactions. Twenty-nine 
(2.4%)  of  1186  patients  not  receiving  MTX  developed  an  AE  characterised  as  an  immunologic 
reaction,  while  only  9  (0.8%)  of  1,148  patients  receiving  concomitant  MTX  developed  an 
immunologic reaction. 
An  immune  function  sub-study  to  DE019  is  presented  (adalimumab  plus  MTX  n=46,  MTX  plus 
placebo  n=18).  This  included  response  to  pneumococcal  vaccine.  The  results  are  acceptably 
summarised in the SPC and do not create additional concerns regarding immunosuppression with the 
combination.  
Serious infectious AEs occurred at a slightly higher percentage in adalimumab-treated patients taking 
corticosteroids at baseline than those adalimumab-treated patients not taking corticosteroids. This was 
noted  in  the  adequate  and  well-controlled  studies,  the  open-label  continuation  studies,  and  in  all 
studies of RA patients. 
No influence on safety profile was noted for concomitant use of NSAIDs. 
Use  of  adalimumab  with  DMARDs  other  than  MTX  was  studied  in  DE031.  As  noted  above 
experience is limited. No specific concerns are apparent at this stage. 
Deaths 
A total of 22 adalimumab-treated patients and 2 placebo-treated patients died as a result of AEs during 
the  development  program.  In addition, two  patients  died  of cardiovascular disorders  33 and  36  days 
after their final doses of study drug in Study DE020. Five deaths were deemed related to infections, 
including three cases of sepsis, on case of aspergillosis, and one case of super-infected herpes zoster. 
Six deaths were related to malignancies and four deaths were due to cardiovascular disease. 
Laboratory findings 
The summary of laboratory adverse events is comprehensive and the following findings are adequately 
reflected  in  the  SPC:  increased  coagulation  time,  decreased  haemoglobin,  hypercholesterolaemia, 
hyperlipaemia, increased ALT, increased BUN, and haematuria.

Discussion on clinical safety 
Qualitatively, the safety profile of adalimumab appears typical for that of anti-TNF therapy. Increased 
risk  of  infection,  Tuberculosis  and  other  opportunistic  infection,  demyelinating  neurological  events, 
and formation of auto-antibodies were identified in the trial programme. These issues are adequately 
resolved  through  SPC  amendments  and  post-marketing  surveillance.  There  were  no  serious 
administration reactions and the incidence of ISR was low. There are no indications that AAA affect 
the safety profile.  
AAA are formed in a percentage of patients, especially when adalimumab is used without concomitant 
MTX.  AAA  have  not  been  associated  with  specific  adverse  events  so  far.  As  AAA  may  impact 
therapeutic response monotherapy should be used only in patients intolerant of concomitant MTX.

Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation 
Quality 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
Viral  Safety  and  Batch  to  batch  consistency  has  been  documented  and  the  relevant  test  will  be 
performed according to the agreed specifications. 
Preclinical pharmacology and toxicology 
Overall,  the  primary  pharmacodynamic  studies  provided  adequate  evidence  that  adalimumab  was 
effective  in  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  studies.  A  number  of  general  pharmacology/safety  pharmacology 
studies were performed. There were no findings in these studies that raise concerns.  
In  mice  and  monkeys,  the  pharmacokinetics  of  adalimumab  were  linear  as  long  as  anti-adalimumab 
antibodies were absent. However, both MAHA and PAHA developed after single doses, and affected 
the  elimination.  Thus,  parameters  such  as  clearance  and  half-life  could  not  be  determined  with 
certainty. In general though, elimination was slow in both species (t1/2 about 14 –21 days in monkeys).  
The  toxicology  program  included  studies  of  single  and  repeat  dose  toxicity,  genotoxicity, 
developmental  toxicity  and  local  tolerance.  An  embryo-foetal  developmental  toxicity/perinatal 
developmental  study  has  been  performed  in  cynomologous  monkeys  at  0,  30  and  100 mg/kg  (9-17 
monkeys/group)  and  has  revealed  no  evidence  of  harm  to  the  foetuses  due  to  adalimumab.  
Carcinogenicity  studies,  and  standard  assessment  of  fertility  and  postnatal  toxicity,  were  not 
performed with adalimumab due to the lack of appropriate models for an antibody with limited cross-
reactivity to rodent TNF and the development of neutralizing antibodies in rodents.  
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The documentation submitted provides clear evidence of efficacy of adalimumab in the population of 
adult  patients  with  moderate  to  severe,  active  RA,  who  have  failed  previous  DMARD  therapy, 
including  MTX.  The  magnitude  of  effect  on  symptoms  and  signs  variables  appears  typical  for  anti-
TNF  therapy  and  has  been  documented  for  sufficient  duration  in  add-on  to  MTX.  Due  to  higher 
incidence of AAA formation and on average loss of efficacy, monotherapy should be reserved mainly 
for patients intolerant to MTX. In the chronic population with relatively low erosive activity studied, 
there  is  also  a  significant  effect  on  joint  destruction  when  adalimumab  is  used  as  add-on  to  MTX, 
documented up to one year. Full assessment of the relevance of this will have to await the 2-year data, 
however.  
The  clinical  comparability  data  available  are  limited,  but  show  bioequivalence  between  clinical  trial 
and  commercial  materials  as  regards  pharmacokinetics,  and  do  not  indicate  major  differences  for 
short-term immunogenicity or overall efficacy and safety. Further reassurance will be provided from a

long-term  post-marketing  trial.  Also  further  characterisation  of  kinetics  and  dynamics  of  antibody 
formation to adalimumab will be provided post-authorisation from another trial 
The  overall  safety  profile  of  adalimumab  appears  typical  of  anti-TNF  therapy.  Therefore,  in  most 
areas the safety information was harmonised with that for infliximab and etanercept . The incidence of 
serious hypersensitivity reactions appears reassuringly low, as does the incidence of ISR.  
Benefit/risk assessment 
Based on the CPMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CPMP considered by consensus 
that the benefit/risk profile of Humira was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the 
marketing  authorisation,  for  the  indication:  “Treatment  of  moderate  to  severe,  active  rheumatoid 
arthritis  in  adult  patients  when  the  response  to  disease-modifying  anti-rheumatic  drugs  including 
methotrexate has been inadequate. To ensure maximum efficacy, Humira is given in combination with 
methotrexate.  Humira  can  be  given  as  monotherapy  in  case  of  intolerance  to  methotrexate  or  when 
continued treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate.

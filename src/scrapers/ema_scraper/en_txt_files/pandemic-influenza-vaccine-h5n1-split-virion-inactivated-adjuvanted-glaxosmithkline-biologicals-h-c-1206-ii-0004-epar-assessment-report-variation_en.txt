3.  Scientific discussion 
3.1.  Introduction 
Pandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals 
was granted Marketing Authorisations in the EU in May 2008 as an informed consent duplicate to 
Pandemrix. 
The legal basis for the initial application for Marketing Authorisation refers to Article 10(c) of Directive 
2001/83/EC, as amended –relating to informed consent from the marketing authorisation holder, for 
the authorised medicinal product: Pandemrix (EU/1/08/452/001). 
This vaccine is the same as the Pandemrix H5N1 mock-up vaccine, which was previously authorised in 
the European Union (EU) and was changed in October 2009 into a vaccine containing the H1N1v strain. 
The currently approved vaccine contains split influenza virus with a haemagglutinin content equivalent 
to 3.75 micrograms derived from A/VietNam/1194/2004 (H5N1) like strain (NIBRG-14).  
The vaccine also contains the marketing authorisation holder’s (MAH’s) proprietary adjuvant AS03, 
which is composed of squalene, DL--tocopherol and polysorbate 80. 
The virus is propagated in eggs and the approved vaccine is manufactured in Dresden.  
The current variation aims to update the Product Information to reflect data from a from a previously 
submitted study in children aged from 3-9 years (FUM 019 – Study D-Pan - H5N1-009, -022 and -023) 
The data consists of study reports data up to Day 51 for H5N1-009, -022 and -023. 
The data provided in this variation were all previously reviewed as part of: 
 
FUMs 020 and 019 for Pandemrix and Prepandrix/duplicate, respectively, regarding provision of 
data to D42 from study 009 in children aged from 3-9 years.

due in particular to new quality, pre-clinical, clinical or 
pharmacovigilance data 
To reflect new data obtained from study D-Pan H5N1-009 in section 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC, 
as well as in the Package Leaflet (sections 3 and 4). This clinical study is conducted in children aged 3 
to 9 years, to evaluate the immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of three formulations of AS03 
adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine, given following a two dose schedule on Days 0 and 21. The MAH is also 
taking the opportunity of this procedure to update Annex II in order to reflect the wording on the 
Pharmacovigilance System as requested by CHMP and to include the Marketing Authorisation numbers 
in the Labelling. 
3.2.  Clinical aspects 
Study H5N1-009, -022, -023 – use in children aged from 3-9 years 
Study design 
The entire study was divided into three phases as shown below: 
Two intramuscular injections of the assigned formulation were given on Days 0 and 21 in the deltoid 
region of the non-dominant arm. 
Each Phase enrolled healthy children in the specified age groups. Subjects from each group were 
enrolled sequentially into the two age strata (6-9 years and then 3-5 years) with the ratio 1:1. 
Variation assessment report 
EMA/954953/2011  
Page 4/28
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on safety data collected on Days 0 to 6 after the first injection for the subjects aged 6-9 years 
included in Phase A the decision was taken to vaccinate subjects aged 3-5 years and to administer a 
second injection to subjects aged 6-9 years. In addition, within each age group, two interim safety 
analyses were performed on Days 7 and 28 to provide safety information that was analysed by the 
IDMC and/or the Sponsor Safety Review Team.   
Similarly, there were two IDMC consultations in Phases B and C for progression to the younger age 
group. For each cohort in Phase B and Phase C and within each age group (6-9 years and 3-5 years) 
the Day 7 interim safety analysis was reviewed by the Sponsor Safety Review Team to provide the go-
ahead for the second injection. A further interim safety analysis was produced in each age group of all 
solicited symptoms experienced between Day 21 and Day 28 plus SAEs and withdrawals reported since 
Day 0.   
In each Phase a first core analysis was performed when all data on the humoral immune response and 
safety up to Day 51 became available. Subsequent analyses were to be performed when data were 
available for the Months 6, 12 and 24 time points. 
The Co-primary objectives of study 009 were: 
 
To evaluate the humoral immune response induced by the H5N1 vaccine candidate in terms of 
anti-haemagglutinin antibody titre. 
 
To evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of the H5N1 vaccine candidate in terms of solicited local 
and general AEs, unsolicited AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs). 
 
To evaluate the biological safety in terms of selected biochemistry parameters (ALT, AST, CREA, 
BUN, LDH, CPK). 
The Secondary objective was: 
 
To evaluate the humoral immune response induced by the H5N1 vaccine candidate in terms of 
neutralising antibody titre. 
Variation assessment report 
EMA/954953/2011  
Page 5/28
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Exploratory objectives were: 
 
To evaluate the cell-mediated immune response induced by the H5N1 vaccine candidate in terms 
of the expression of Th1 markers (CD40L, IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α) after in vitro re-stimulation of 
influenza-specific CD4/CD8 T-lymphocytes in a subset of subjects. 
 
To evaluate the cell-mediated immune response induced by the H5N1 vaccine candidate, in terms 
of Th2-specific activation marker expression (for example, IL-5, IL-10 and/or IL-13 after in vitro 
re-stimulation of influenza-specific CD4 T-lymphocytes.  
Total Vaccinated cohort 
The total study cohort included all vaccinated subjects for whom safety data were available.  
The total analysis of immunogenicity included vaccinated subjects for whom data concerning 
immunogenicity endpoint measures were available.  
ATP cohort for analysis of immunogenicity 
The ATP cohort for analysis of immunogenicity included all evaluable subjects for whom data 
concerning immunogenicity endpoint measures were available. 
ATP cohort for analysis of safety: 
Typically, the ATP cohort for analysis of safety included subjects who had received at least one dose of 
study vaccine and had sufficient data to perform an analysis of safety. 
In Phase A 
Randomisation was to (allocation ratio 3:1): 
  Half HA/Half AS03: Half the adult dose (1.9 µg of HA) + half the AS03 
  Control: Fluarix 
Children in the 6-9 years stratum, enrolled during Q3 of 2007 received Fluarix for the Northern 
Hemisphere 2006/2007 influenza season. 
Children in the 3-5 years stratum enrolled during Q4 of 2007 received Fluarix for the Northern 
Hemisphere 2007/2008 influenza season. 
In Phase B and Phase C 
Randomisation was to (allocation ratio 3:1): 
 
Full HA/Half AS03 (Phase B): 3.8 µg HA) and half the dose of AS03 
  Control: Fluarix

  Control: Fluarix 
This was Fluarix formulated for the Northern Hemisphere 2007/2008 influenza season. 
Immunogenicity results to D42 
Phase A from study H5N1-009 
All of the 138 subjects enrolled were vaccinated. 
In the Half HA/Half AS03 group: 102 subjects were enrolled with 51 subjects in each age stratum 
In the control group: 36 subjects were enrolled with 18 subjects in each age stratum 
Fifteen of the 138 (10 aged 6-9 years and 5 aged 3-5 years) were excluded from the ATP 
immunogenicity cohort. The predominant reasons for exclusion were: 
  unknown initial antibody status (8) 
  non-compliance with the vaccination schedule (4). 
The immune response results (HI and NA) were consistent between the ATP and Total Vaccinated 
cohort and therefore only the former are reported below. 
The overall mean ages per cohort at the time of the first vaccination were 3.8 years and 7.6 years. 
One subject above 9 years was aged 10 years and 3 months. The overall male-female ratios were 1.03 
and 1.23 in respective age cohorts and the majority (94%) were of white-Caucasian/European 
heritage. 
The pre-vaccination HI GMTs for A/Vietnam/1194/2004 and A/Indonesia/05/2005 were <1:10 and so 
seropositivity rates were zero. 
On Day 21, the GMTs against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 strain were slightly increased in the Half HA/Half 
AS03 group in both age strata and then increased markedly after the second dose (540.3 for 6-9 
years; 392.7 for 3-5 years). A similar pattern but lower response was seen against 
A/Indonesia/05/2005 (60.8 for 6-9 years; 53.5 for 3-5 years).  
Increments in HI seropositivity rates followed the GMTs for the AS03 vaccine group but in the control 
group the seropositivity rates against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 and A/Indonesia/05/2005 strains were 
zero at all time points.

In the AS03-adjuvanted vaccine group 
There were no or small increments between D0 and D21 followed by very marked increments in all 
parameters between D21 and D42.  
  By Day 42 the SCRs and the SPRs against the vaccine strain were 95.9% to 100% while SCRs 
against A/Indonesia/05/2005 were 71.4% to 74.4 %. The ≥70% threshold for the lower bound 
of the 95% CI for seroprotection as defined in the CBER Guidance was only met for HI against 
A/Vietnam/1194/2004. 
  On Day 42 the SCFs against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 were 78.5 and 108.1 while SCFs against 
A/Indonesia/05/2005 strain were 10.7 and 12.2. 
In the Fluarix group 
No subject seroconverted for HI antibody to A/Vietnam/1194/2004 or A/Indonesia/05/2005 and no 
subject was seroprotected.

On Day 21, the GMTs for NA against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 strain were nearly 2-fold higher in the Half 
HA/Half AS03 group in both age strata (177.5 for 6-9 years; 173.5 for 3-5 years) when compared with 
the control group (97.2 for 6-9 years; 98.2 for 3-5 years). 
On Day 42 the NA GMTs against the A/Vietnam/1194/2004 in the Half HA/Half AS03 group had 
reached 1155.1 in the 6-9 years age stratum and 1044.4 in the 3-5 years age stratum, whereas the 
increase from baseline in the control group was very small (104.5 for 6-9 years; 158.4 for 3-5 years). 
The NA seropositivity rates against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 in the Half HA/Half AS03 group increased to 
90.7% in the 6-9 years age stratum and to 91.7% in the 3-5 years age stratum on Day 21, with non-
overlapping CIs (when compared with Day 0). All subjects in the Half HA/Half AS03 group were 
seropositive for NA at d42. 
In the control group, the seropositivity rates for NA against the vaccine strain on Days 21 and 42 were 
within the same range (78.6% - 80.0%). 
On Day 21 there were no significant differences between the Half HA/Half AS03 and control groups or 
between the age strata within each group for NA SCRs against the vaccine strain (range 65.1% - 
67.4% for Half HA/Half AS03 group and 42.9% - 71.4% for control group). 
On Day 42 the NA SCR against the vaccine strain in the Half HA/Half AS03 group had reached 100% in 
the 6-9 years age stratum and 95.6% in the 3-5 years age stratum.  
In contrast there was no further increment in SCRs in the control group after a second dose of Fluarix. 
Variation assessment report

The MAH concluded that: 
The half-adult dose formulation (1.9 μg of HA antigen and ½ the adult dose of AS03) elicited strong 
vaccine-homologous HI and NA responses after two doses administered 21 days apart. 
There was no significant difference between the two prospective age strata for any of the immunology 
parameters studied. 
The vaccine also induced a heterologous humoral immune response in terms of HI with SCR/SPRs 
against A/Indonesia/05/2005 of 71.4 % to 74.4%. 
The HI and NA titres were comparable with those observed in adults with 3.8 μg of HA antigen and a 
full dose of AS03. 
Phase B from study H5N1-022 
In the Full HA/Half AS03 group: 100 subjects were enrolled with 49 subjects aged 6-9 years and 
51 aged 3-5 years. 
In the control group: 34 subjects were enrolled with 17 subjects in each age stratum. 
The overall mean ages at the time of the first vaccination were 4.2 years and 7.3 years per age 
stratum. The overall percentage of males was 48.5% and 66.7% per cohort. Almost all subjects were 
of white-Caucasian/European heritage. 
The pre-vaccination HI GMTs for antibody against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 and A/Indonesia/05/2005 
were <1:10 in all vaccine groups and age strata except for one subject in the 3-5 years cohort. Thus 
seropositivity rates were 0.0% to 2.4%. 
  On Day 21, GMTs for HI against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 were slightly increased in both age 
strata in the AS03 vaccine group (23.7 for 6-9 years; 22.7 for 3-5 years) and were slightly 
increased against A/Indonesia but remained below the cut-off value in the control group. 
  By Day 42 GMTs for HI against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 in the AS03 vaccine group were 
markedly higher (615.8 for 6-9 years; 678.1 for 3-5 years) and reached 64.9 to 73.7 against 
A/Indonesia but were still below the cut-off value in the control group. 
  Seropositivity rates followed the same pattern as the GMTs.

In the AS03-adjuvanted vaccine group 
By Day 21 the SCRs and SPRs against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 ranged from 42.2% to 48.8% but there 
was no seroconversion and no subject was seroprotected with respect to A/Indonesia/05/2005. 
On Day 42 the SCRs and SPRs against the vaccine strain had reached 97.8% for subjects aged 6-9 
years and 97.6% for subjects aged 3-5 years. SCRs and SPRs against A/Indonesia/05/2005 had 
increased to 68.9% and 76.2% in respective age groups. The ≥70% threshold for the lower bound of 
the 95% CI for seroprotection as defined in the CBER Guidance was met for HI against 
A/Vietnam/1194/2004. 
Day 21 SCFs against both strains were from 1.1 to 4.7 but at Day 42 the SCFs against 
A/Vietnam/1194/2004 were 123.2 for 6-9 years and 132.3 for 3-5 years. The increments in SCFs 
against A/Indonesia/05/2005 strain were relatively modest (13.0 and 14.7). 
Variation assessment report 
EMA/954953/2011  
Page 11/28
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the Fluarix group 
No subject seroconverted for HI antibody to A/Vietnam/1194/2004 or A/Indonesia/05/2005 and no 
subject was seroprotected. 
The pre-vaccination NA GMTs were ≥1:28 and comparable between the age strata range 25.6 to 65.5 
while baseline seropositivity rates ranged from 47.1% to 78.6%. 
By Day 21 the NA GMTs against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 were approximately 3-fold higher in the AS03 
vaccine group in both age strata compared with the control group. On Day 42 GMTs exceeded 1500 in 
the AS03 group but there was a negligible increase in the control group. 
The seropositivity rates and seroconversion rates followed the same pattern as the GMTs. 
Phase C from study H5N1-023 
In the Full HA/Full AS03 group: 98 subjects were enrolled with 49 subjects in each age stratum  
In the control group: 35 subjects were enrolled with 18 and 17 subjects in each age stratum 
The overall mean ages at the time of the first vaccination were 4.2 years and 7.1 years per age cohort. 
Male subjects accounted for 50-59.7% per age cohort and almost all were of white-
Caucasian/European heritage. 
The pre-vaccination GMTs for HI antibody against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 and A/Indonesia/05/2005 
were <1:10 regardless of age stratum or vaccine group and so seropositivity rates were zero. 
Variation assessment report 
EMA/954953/2011  
Page 12/28
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Day 21 HI GMTs against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 were slightly increased in the AS03 vaccine group in 
both age strata and by Day 42 they had reached 883.5 for 6-9 years and 956.4 for 3-5 years.  
HI GMTs against A/Indonesia/05/2005 in the AS03 group were also much higher at D42 (92.5 for 6-9 
years; 167.9 for 3-5 years) compared with D21. 
Corresponding seropositivity rates followed a similar pattern and by D42 all subjects in both age strata 
were seropositive against A/Vietnam while rates against A/Indonesia/05/2005 had reached 83.7% in 
the 6-9 years age stratum and 95.5% in the 3-5 years age stratum. 
In the control group, the seropositivity rates against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 and A/Indonesia/05/2005 
were zero at all time points except for one subject who was seropositive after the first Fluarix dose. All 
corresponding GMTs were low or below the cut-off value. 
In the AS03 vaccine group 
The Day 21 SCRs and SPRs against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 ranged from 46.5% to 56.7% but were only 
3.3% to 7% against A/Indonesia/05/2005. By Day 42 rates were 100% for both age strata against 
Variation assessment report 
EMA/954953/2011  
Page 13/28
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A/Vietnam and 79.1% to 95.5% against A/Indonesia. The ≥70% threshold for the lower bound of the 
95% CI for seroprotection as defined in the CBER Guidance was met for HI antibody against 
A/Vietnam/1194/2004 in both age strata and was met against A/Indonesia/05/2005 in the 3-5 year 
age stratum. 
The Day 21 SCFs against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 and A/Indonesia/05/2005 ranged from 1.2 to 5.5. 
However, on Day 42 the SCFs against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 were 176.7 and 191.3 compared to 18.5 
and 33.6 against A/Indonesia/05/2005. 
In the control group 
No subject seroconverted for HI against either strain and none was seroprotected with the exception of 
one subject with a response to A/Vietnam/1194/2004 on Day 21 only. 
Pre-vaccination NA GMTs were ≥1:28 and were generally comparable between the age strata (range 
25.6 to 37.3). Despite the low GMTs, the baseline seropositivity rates ranged from 30.8% to 46.7%. 
On Day 21, NA GMTs against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 were 1.5-4-fold in the AS03 group compared with 
the control group. 
By Day 42 NA GMTs against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 increased about 10-fold in the AS03 group in both 
age strata and all children were seropositive whereas there was no further increase in GMTs in the 
control group and the seropositivity rates ranged from 61.5% to 87.5%. The seroconversion rates also 
showed the marked differences between AS03 and control for both age strata.

Comparison between the three formulations up to D42 
The MAH performed a comparison between the three AS03-adjuvanted vaccine formulations (i.e. ½ 
HA/½ AS03, Full HA/ ½ AS03, and Full HA/Full AS03 used in Phases A, B, and C, respectively. See 
Table 16 below. 
Responses in terms of SCR, SPR and SCF were high in all three study phases and in both age strata.  
There was a trend for higher HI GMTs and SCFs against both strains and a higher NA GMT against the 
vaccine strain with the formulations tested in Phases C and B compared to the half/half formulation 
used in Phase A. The immune also response tended to be higher in Phase C when compared with Phase 
B.  
When comparing the formulation used in Phase C or in Phase B with that used in Phase A the 
difference between A and C was marked whereas the difference between A and B was much less 
apparent.  
There were advantages for C over B for HI and NA GMTs and for responses to A/Indonesia. 
The MAH concluded that: 
At Day 42 the CBER criterion for seroconversion was reached against both strains and in both age 
strata in children who received Full HA/Half AS03 or Full HA/Full AS03 groups.  
At Day 42 the CBER criterion for seroprotection was met against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 in both age 
strata that received Full HA/Half AS03 or Full HA/Full AS03 while the criterion was met against 
A/Indonesia/05/2005 by 3-5 year-olds who received Full HA/Full AS03. 
There were marked increments in responses to both strains from first to second doses in groups that 
received Full HA/Half AS03 or Full HA/Full AS03. 
Responses to A/Vietnam were higher than to A/Indonesia in all AS03 formulation groups. 
No major differences between the age strata (6-9 years and 3-5 years) were detected for any of the 
immune response parameters considered. 
Variation assessment report

Page 15/28
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Comparisons between the three formulations used in Phases A, B, and C generally favoured C over 
both A and B. However the HI SCR/SPRs did not show marked differences between the three 
formulations tested. 
Immunogenicity data at Month 6 
By Month 6 the HI GMTs had fallen but were still at least 6-fold higher than the pre-vaccination GMTs 
in the groups that had received AS03 vaccines.  
Against A/Vietnam the seroprotection rates at Month 6 in children who received the adult dose vaccine 
in Part C of the study were 82.8% for 3-5 year-olds and 78% for 6-9 year-olds. These rates compare 
with 56% and 63.6% in respective age groups who received the half/half vaccine in Part A and with 
70.2% and 68.9% who received full dose HA and half AS03 in Part B. The 95% CI overlap between 
Parts A, B and C within each age stratum. The results for the other parameters shown follow a similar 
pattern.

In the Fluarix groups in each Part of the study there was no difference between the D0 and the 
Month 6 HI seropositivity rates and GMTs against either A/Vietnam or A/Indonesia in 3-5 year-olds or 
6-9 year-olds. Therefore there was no evidence of any augmentation of the HI immune response as a 
result of intervening natural exposure to cross-reacting antigens between D42 and Month 6.

NA was assessed against A/Vietnam at Month 6 for Part A subjects only (i.e. half adult dose versus 
Fluarix). 
In the AS03 vaccine group the NA GMTs dropped to a similar degree in both age strata so that, as at 
D42 (GMTs 1026 and 1111), the actual GMTs at D180 were comparable for children aged 3-5 years 
and 6-9 years (776 and 759). At Month 6 all children who had received the AS03 vaccine had NA titres 
of at least 1:80.  
However, in the Fluarix group the GMTs increased between D42 and D180. In the younger age group 
(3-5 years) the increment was small (from 166 to 200) but is none the less remarkable since a drop in 
GMT would usually have been expected. In the older age group (6-9 years) the increase was by 6-fold 
(from 75 at D42 to 482 at D180). These results suggest that natural exposure to cross-reacting 
antigens had occurred in the interim period.

As a result the seroconversion rates in the 6-9 year-olds at Month 6 were 95% for the AS03 group and 
93% for the Fluarix group. Also, all children aged 6-9 years who received Fluarix had NA titres of at 
least 1:80 at Month 6, while the corresponding rate in the 3-5 year-olds was 80%.

Due to the unexpected results in the Fluarix group the MAH subsequently performed further testing of 
selected sera against the A/Brisbane seasonal strain. The results showed:  
1) Some level of concordance between anti A/Vietnam NA titres and anti-A/Brisbane/59 HI titres at 
baseline and after Fluarix vaccination;  
2) An increase in anti-A/Brisbane/59 HI titres at Month 6 in some subjects suggesting H1N1 infection 
(>4 fold titer increase). In some but not all of these individuals the observed Month 6 increase in anti-
A/Brisbane/59 HI titre paralleled the increase in anti A/Vietnam NA titre.  
In conclusion, the MAH states that the results suggested that an increase in anti-Vietnam NA titres 
could be due to H1N1 infection in the study population between D42 and M6. The absence of a 
consistent parallelism between anti-Brisbane HI and anti-Vietnam NA titres may reflect the complexity 
of the relationship between the two assays. For example the MAH points to possible interference of 
post vaccine response and kinetics, post infectious response and kinetics, antibody activities captured 
by both assays and assay variability between D42 and M6 testing. 
Immunogenicity data at Month 12 
The heterologous immune response to vaccination was evaluated in terms of neutralising antibodies 
against the A/Indonesia/05/2005 strain at Day 42, at Month 6 and at Month 12 following vaccination 
with half dose HA + half ASO3 (Phase A subjects) or with Fluarix (control group). Note that the D0 
samples were not tested but will be tested in parallel with the M24 samples and the results provided at 
a later date. 
A significant heterologous immune response was observed at Day 42, Month 6 and Month 12 in 
subjects receiving half dose HA + half ASO3. The comparison between Phase A and Fluarix indicated 
that cross-reactive immunity was induced by the vaccine. In contrast to the A/Vietnam data the control 
group did not show an increment in NA titre against A/Indonesia over time. In the AS03 group there 
was a decrease in GMT at M6 and at M12 compared to D42 but the rate of subjects with a titre above 
1/80 remained high in both age groups with 89.6% at M6 and 87.2% at M12 in the 3-6 years-old 
group and with 90% at M6 and 82.9% at M12 in the 6-9 years-old group.

Safety 
Phase A 
In the 6-9 years age stratum, the overall incidence of AEs by subject was 96.1% in the AS03 group 
and 88.9% in the control group. The incidences of general symptoms were comparable between 
vaccine groups but local symptoms occurred more often in the AS03 group. There was no increased 
reactogenicity in either vaccine group after the second dose compared with the first dose. 
In the 3-5 years age stratum, AE rates were generally lower than in older children. Incidences of 
general symptoms per subject were comparable between vaccine groups but rates of local symptoms 
per subject were higher in the AS03 group. There was no increased reactogenicity in either vaccine 
group after the second dose compared with the first dose. 
The incidence of grade 3 AEs was generally low with no difference between the vaccine groups in older 
children but with rates of 13.7% versus zero in children aged 3-5 years. The incidence of AEs with 
causal relationship to the vaccination in the subjects aged 6-9 years was 94.1% in the Half HA/Half 
AS03 group compared with 83.3% in the control subjects. However, rates were comparable among 
subjects aged 3-5 years (66.7% and 61.1%).

In the 6-9 year-olds the rates of pain were 61% for Fluarix and 76.5% for AS03 vaccine after the first 
dose (none and 5.9% with Grade 3) but were comparable after the second dose (none and 4% with 
Grade 3). In the 3-5 year-olds the rates of pain were higher with AS03 vaccine after both doses but 
very few had Grade 3 pain. 
Rates of solicited general symptoms per subject as shown below were not markedly different between 
vaccine groups in the 6-9 years age stratum. The rate of any fever (> 37.5°C) after dose 1 of AS03 
vaccine was 5.9% but no subject had Grade 3 fever (> 39°C) and no subject in the Fluarix group had 
any fever. The rates for any fever after the second dose were 16.7% for Fluarix and 10.2% for AS03 
vaccine while rates for Grade 3 fever were 5.6% and zero. The per-dose rates for any antipyretic use 
were 8% in both vaccine groups with per subject rates of 17% and 14% in respective groups.  
In the 3-5 years age stratum rates of solicited general symptoms per subject were higher than in the 
control group. The rate of any fever after dose 1 of AS03 vaccine was 9.8% but 3.9% had Grade 3 
fever (> 39°C). The corresponding rates after the second dose were 6% and zero. No subjects in the 
Fluarix group had fever after either dose. The per-dose rates of taking any antipyretic were 9% for 
Fluarix and 19% for AS03 vaccine, with per subject rates of 17% and 35%. 
Unsolicited AEs reported up to 51 days after the first vaccination showed no particular signal or clinical 
pattern in any vaccine group. 
No deaths or other SAEs were reported and there were no AEs leading to withdrawal during this study 
phase. 
Phase B 
In both age strata the overall incidence incidences of AEs and rates of local and general AEs by subject 
were higher in the AS03 vaccine group than in the control group. There was no increased 
reactogenicity in either vaccine group after the second vaccination when compared with the first 
vaccination. There were more Grade 3 AEs in subjects aged 6-9 years in the AS03 group (8.2%) when 
compared with the control group (0.0%). Similarly, the incidence of Grade 3 AEs in subjects aged 3-5 
years was higher in the AS03 group (11.8%) when compared with the control group (5.9%), mainly 
driven by a higher incidence of Grade 3 local symptoms. 
The incidence of AEs with causal relationship to the vaccination in the subjects aged 6-9 years was 
75.5% in the AS03 vaccine group compared with 58.8% in the control subjects. Also, among subjects 
aged 3-5 years the incidence of AEs assessed as causally related to the vaccination was 70.6% in the 
AS03 vaccine group and 35.3% in the control group.

Solicited local symptoms per subject (see graph below) did not show marked differences between 
AS03 and control except for pain at the injection site.  
In the 6-9 years age stratum the incidences per subject of solicited general symptoms were generally 
higher in the AS03 vaccine group but rates for Grade 3 symptoms were low. The rates of any fever (> 
37.5°C) after dose 1 were zero for Fluarix and 2% for AS03 vaccine and no subject had Grade 3 fever 
(> 39°C). The corresponding rates after the second dose were zero and 6.4% for any fever in 
respective vaccine groups and zero and 2.1% had Grade 3 fever. The per dose rates for any antipyretic 
use were 9% and 12% in respective vaccine groups with per subject rates of 18% and 22% in 
respective groups.  
In the 3-5 years age stratum, solicited general symptoms occurred more often in the AS03 vaccine 
group than in the control group. The rates of any fever (> 37.5°C) after dose 1 were 11.8% for Fluarix 
and 7.8% for AS03 vaccine and no subject had Grade 3 fever (> 39°C). The corresponding rates after 
the second dose were 5.9% and 14.3% for any fever and 5.9% and zero had Grade 3 fever. Within 
this period the per dose rates of taking any antipyretic (regardless of the reason for use) were 18% for 
Fluarix and 17% for AS03 vaccine, with per subject rates of 29% and 30%.

In both age strata the incidences of unsolicited AEs were comparable but higher in the younger 
subjects. Grade 3 AEs and AEs assessed as causally related to the vaccination were infrequent. One 
subject in the Full HA/ ½ AS03 group experienced an AE leading to premature discontinuation. Please 
see the separate AR on possible auto-immune diseases in vaccinees. There were no SAEs in Phase B 
during the study conduct up to Day 51. 
Phase C 
In the both age strata the incidences of local and general AEs were higher in the AS03 group. The 
incidence of Grade 3 AEs in subjects aged 6-9 years was higher in the AS03 group (18.4%) when 
compared with the control group (5.6%). The incidence of Grade 3 AEs in subjects aged 3-5 years was 
also higher in the AS03 group (22.4%) when compared with the control group (0.0%) but did not 
seem to be driven by the incidence of local Grade 3 symptoms. 
The incidence of AEs with causal relationship to the vaccination in the subjects aged 6-9 years was 
93.9% in the AS03 vaccine group and 94.4% in the control group compared to 79.6% and 41.2% in 
respective groups in the younger age cohort. 
Pain was the predominant solicited local symptom in both age strata and vaccine groups. Rates of pain 
were not higher after the second dose in either age stratum.

Redness and swelling were also reported with a higher incidence in the AS03 group irrespective of age 
stratum. In the 3-5 years age stratum there was a trend for a higher incidence of induration, redness 
and pain upon re-vaccination but this was not observed in the 6-9 years age stratum and was not 
observed in either stratum with the control vaccine. The majority of these events were Grade 1 in 
intensity, and there were few isolated Grade 3 cases in the AS03 group (none in the control group). 
Among 6-9 year-olds rates of general solicited symptoms were higher with AS03 vaccine and the 
incidence of fever, headache, myalgia, shivering and sweating tended to be higher after Dose 2. Rates 
of fever after dose 1 were zero in the Fluarix group and 12.2% in the AS03 group (1/6 of these 
subjects [2% overall] had Grade 3 fever). After the second dose rates for any fever were zero and 
32.7% in respective vaccine groups (6/16 of these subjects [12% overall] had Grade 3 fever). These 
numbers give rates for fever overall/dose of zero for Fluarix and 22.4% for AS03 vaccine (7/22 of 
these doses [7% overall] being associated with Grade 3 fever). The per dose rates for any antipyretic 
use were 14% and 43% in respective vaccine groups with per subject rates of 22% and 65% in 
respective groups.  
In the 3-5 years age stratum solicited general symptoms predominated in the AS03 group (range 
8.2% - 36.7%) when compared with the control group (range 0.0% - 5.9%). After dose 1 the rates for 
any fever were zero in the Fluarix group and 8.2% in the AS03 group (3/4 of these subjects [6% 
overall] had Grade 3 fever). After dose 2 the fever rates were zero and 31.3% (2/15 [4% overall] of 
these subjects had Grade 3 fever) in respective vaccine groups. These numbers give overall/dose rates 
for fever of zero for Fluarix and 19.6% for AS03 vaccine (5/19 of these doses [5% overall] being 
associated with Grade 3 fever). Within this period the per dose rates of taking any antipyretic 
(regardless of the reason for use) in the 3-5 year-olds were 15% for Fluarix and 31% for AS03 
vaccine, with per subject rates of 24% and 51%.  
The incidence of unsolicited AEs was 55.1% in the AS03 group and 33.3% in the control group in the 
6-9 years age stratum. There were very few Grade 3 unsolicited AEs and unsolicited AEs assessed as 
causally related to the vaccination were infrequent. In the 3-5 years stratum the incidence of 
unsolicited AEs was 53.1% in the AS03 group and 47.1% in the control group. Few subjects reported 
Grade 3 unsolicited AEs in the AS03 group (6.1%) and there were none in the control group. The 
incidence of unsolicited AEs assessed as causally related to the vaccination was 18.4% in the AS03 
group compared to zero in the control group.  
One subject in the AS03 group developed an AE of uveitis for which subsequent details specified a 
unilateral anterior chamber uveitis at 8 days after the second dose of the H5N1 vaccine, which was 
considered to have a potential causal relationship to vaccination. One subject in the AS03 group was 
hospitalised for gastroenteritis but the event was considered not related to vaccination and resolved 
after two days. There were no AEs leading to premature discontinuation in Phase C and no deaths were 
reported.

Additional data at Month 6 and Month 12 
No additional safety concerns were raised by the M6 safety data. 
Discussion on immunogenicity  
In Parts A, B and C of the study in children aged 3-9 years the D42 HI immune response parameters 
(SCR, SPR, SCF) did not clearly distinguish any one of the three formulations tested. However, the 
administration of a higher HA dose and, especially, the full adult dose, demonstrated advantages in 
terms of several HI and NA immune parameters. In particular, use of the adult dose gave improved HI 
responses to the heterologous strain and much higher NA GMTs. 
At Month 6 the HI data showed a clear advantage for the full adult dose in terms of persistence of 
vaccine-homologous and especially vaccine-heterologous HI immune responses.  
The NA data against the vaccine strain up to D42 showed that GMTs were highest in the full dose 
group but the values were all over 1000 and the seroconversion rates were all very high regardless of 
vaccine group and age. 
The Month 6 NA data from the Fluarix group in Part A of the study demonstrated that there was 
considerable augmentation of the NA titres against A/Vietnam between D42 and Month 6. Even though 
the actual increase in GMT in the 3-5 year-olds was small there would usually have been a drop 
expected and the increase in the 6-9 year-olds was by 6-fold. It must be assumed then that a natural 
augmentation effect on NA titres of at least the same magnitude must have occurred in the AS03 
vaccine group. Indeed, with a very reasonable assumption of better priming by the AS03 vaccine it is 
quite possible that the magnitude of the effect of natural exposure would be even greater in the group 
that had received AS03 vaccine. 
In contrast, there was no augmentation of NA titres in the control group against A/Indonesia from D42 
up to M12. It is notable then that in the AS03 group the GMTs fell to about half the D42 values by M12 
but over 80% retained titres of at least 1:80. These data suggest that the vaccine per se elicits a 
sustained circulating NA response.  
Discussion on Safety 
The differences between H5N1/AS03 and control vaccines for general and local symptoms and 
unsolicited AEs were most marked in Phase C when the adult dose was administered. As expected, the 
data indicate higher rates in the H5N1/AS03 vaccine groups for local symptoms, which mainly 
concerned pain although rates of other symptoms were also usually higher. However, as in adults, the 
rates of grade 3 pain have been low and were 6-10% even with the full adult dose.

 
In Phase A there was a higher rate of fever in the H5N1 group in the younger age cohort only. 
 
In Phase B general symptoms occurred more often in the H5N1 vaccine group in both age 
strata. The most common symptoms in the 6-9 years age stratum were headache and myalgia 
whereas in the 3-5 years age stratum the most common were irritability and fever (but rates of 
grade 3 symptoms were ≤ 2%). 
 
In Phase C solicited general symptoms (with the most common being headache and fever in 
the 6-9 year-olds, and fever and irritability in the 3-5 year-olds) were much more frequently 
observed in the Full HA/Full AS03 group when compared with the control group. The incidence 
of grade 3 solicited symptoms was low except for a higher incidence of grade 3 fever (10-14% 
in the two age strata) and grade 3 loss of appetite (only 3-5 year-olds) in the Full HA/Full AS03 
group.  
When comparing the age strata, a higher incidence of unsolicited AEs was observed in the subjects 
aged 3-5 years irrespective of vaccine group. In Phase C, the occurrence of unsolicited AEs in the 6-9 
year-olds was higher in the Full HA/Full AS03 group than in the control group, while there was no 
difference in the incidence of unsolicited AEs between the vaccine groups in the 3-5 year-olds. The 
cases of auto-immune hepatitis and anterior uveitis have been reviewed separately along with the case 
of auto-immune hepatitis in an adult from another study (see past assessment reports for details). 
3.3.  Changes to the Product Information 
The detailed changes can be found in the final approved highlighted SmPC/ PL attached to this report. 
Further to the assessment and the scientific discussions held at the CHMP, the following changes to the 
Product Information were requested and subsequently implemented by the MAH. 
SmPC  
Sections 4.2 and 4.4: The initially proposed paragraph in section 4.4 was revised to reflect that there 
are no data with Prepandrix in individuals aged < 18 years.  This was also stated in 4.2 In addition, it 
was stated that there are very limited data from a study with an AS03-adjuvanted vaccine containing 
3.75 µg HA derived from A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) in children aged from 3 to 9 years. 
Section 4.8 was further revised as in contrast to the later findings with the first and second doses of 
H1N1/AS03 the data from study 009 did not tend to show markedly increased local or systemic 
reactogenicity with the second dose. Since section 4.2 of the SmPC does not give a clear 
recommendation for one or two half or full adult doses in children aged 3-9 years the CHMP 
recommended clarifying that the difference shown between half and full doses, was evident after each 
dose and that a second dose was not associated with enhanced reactogenicity.   
In Section 5.1 the text above the table on responses against A/Indonesia was amended to reiterate 
that the table shows the responses to this strain. In addition, the NA responses out to M12 in Group A 
(half dose) were included as a table rather than just described as a text

3.4.  Conclusions and Benefit / Risk Assessment 
Concerning immune response, the D42 HI immune response parameters (SCR, SPR, SCF) did not 
clearly distinguish any one of the three formulations (Half HA/Half AS03, Full HA/Half AS03, Full 
HA/Full AS03) tested. However, the administration of a higher HA dose and, especially, the full adult 
dose, demonstrated advantages in terms of several HI and NA immune parameters. In particular, use 
of the adult dose gave improved HI responses to the heterologous strain and higher NA GMTs. 
Concerning safety, the greatest differences between the H5N1 vaccine and control groups in this study 
were seen when the adult dose was administered. Despite the greater local and general reactogenicity 
with the adult dose uptake of the second dose was very high and only four subjects did not complete 
both doses in the entire study. In addition the data do not indicate that higher reactogenicity was 
associated with SAEs. 
Overall, a difference in the frequency of adverse reactions between half adult and adult doses was 
observed after each dose. However, the administration of a second half adult or an adult dose did not 
enhance the reactogenicity, except for rates of general symptoms which were higher after the second 
adult dose.  
Due to the intervening pandemic the MAH has not previously submitted a variation to add these data 
to the SmPCs for the H5N1 vaccines. It was therefore considered appropriate that the most pertinent 
features of these have been added with this procedure.  
Taken together the data on immunogenicity and safety and considering the update of the product 
information the benefit - risk profile for Pandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, 
adjuvanted) GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals remains positive. 
4.  Conclusion 
On 17 March 2011 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the 
amendments to be introduced in the SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and Package Leaflet.

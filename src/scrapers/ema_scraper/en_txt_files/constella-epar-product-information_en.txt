4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Constella is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of moderate to severe irritable bowel syndrome with 
constipation (IBS-C) in adults.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Posology
The recommended dose is one capsule (290 micrograms) once daily. 
Physicians should periodically assess the need for continued treatment. The efficacy of linaclotide has been 
established in double-blind placebo-controlled studies for up to 6 months. If patients have not experienced 
improvement in their symptoms after 4 weeks of treatment, the patient should be re-examined and the benefit 
and risks of continuing treatment reconsidered.
Special populations
Patients with renal or hepatic impairment
No dose adjustments are required for patients with hepatic or renal impairment (see section 5.2).
Elderly patients
For elderly patients, although no dose adjustment is required, the treatment should be carefully monitored 
and periodically re-assessed (see section 4.4).
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Constella in children aged 0 to18 years have not yet been established. No data are 
available.
This medicinal product should not be used in children and adolescents (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).
Method of administration
Oral use. The capsule should be taken at least 30 minutes before a meal (see section 4.5).
4.3 Contraindications
2
Hypersensitivity to linaclotide or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
Patients with known or suspected mechanical gastrointestinal obstruction.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Constella should be used after organic diseases have been ruled out and a diagnosis of moderate to severe 
IBS-C (see section 5.1) is established.
Patients should be aware of the possible occurrence of diarrhoea and lower gastrointestinal bleeding during 
treatment. They should be instructed to inform their physician if severe or prolonged diarrhoea or lower 
gastrointestinal bleeding occurs (see section 4.8).
Should prolonged (e.g. more than 1 week) or severe diarrhoea occur, medical advice should be sought and
temporary discontinuation of linaclotide until diarrhoea episode is resolved may be considered. Additional 
caution should be exercised in patients who are prone to a disturbance of water or electrolyte balance (e.g. 
elderly, patients with cardiovascular (CV) diseases, diabetes, hypertension), and electrolyte control should be 
considered. 
Cases of intestinal perforation have been reported after use of linaclotide in patients with conditions that may 
be associated with localized or diffuse weakness of the intestinal wall. Patients should be advised to seek 
immediate medical care in case of severe, persistent, or worsening abdominal pain; linaclotide should be 
discontinued if these symptoms occur.
Linaclotide has not been studied in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions of the intestinal tract, such 
as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis; therefore it is not recommended to use Constella in these patients.
Elderly patients
There are limited data in elderly patients (see section 5.1). Because of the higher risk of diarrhoea seen in the 
clinical trials (see section 4.8), special attention should be given to these patients and the treatment benefit-
risk ratio should be carefully and periodically assessed.
Paediatric population
Constella should not be used in children and adolescents as it has not been studied in this population. As 
GC-C receptor is known to be overexpressed at early ages, children younger than 2 years may be particularly 
sensitive to linaclotide effects.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed. Linaclotide is rarely detectable in plasma following 
administration of the recommended clinical doses and in vitro studies have shown that linaclotide is neither a 
substrate nor an inhibitor/inducer of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system and does not interact with a series 
of common efflux and uptake transporters (see section 5.2). 
A food interaction clinical study in healthy subjects showed that linaclotide was not detectable in plasma 
either in fed or in fasted conditions at the therapeutic doses. Taking Constella in the fed condition produced 
more frequent and looser stools, as well as more gastrointestinal adverse events, than when taking it under 
fasting conditions (see section 5.1). The capsule should be taken 30 minutes before a meal (see section 4.2).
Concomitant treatment with proton pump inhibitors, laxatives or NSAIDs may increase the risk of diarrhoea.
Caution should be used when co-administering Constella with such medications.
In cases of severe or prolonged diarrhoea, absorption of other oral medicinal products may be affected. The 
efficacy of oral contraceptives may be reduced and the use of an additional contraceptive method is 
recommended to prevent possible failure of oral contraception (see the prescribing information of the oral 
3
contraceptive). Caution should be exercised when prescribing medicinal products absorbed in the intestinal 
tract with a narrow therapeutic index such as levothyroxine as their efficacy may be reduced.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There is limited amount of data from the use of linaclotide in pregnant women. Animal studies do not 
indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a 
precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Constella during pregnancy.
Lactation
Constella is minimally absorbed following oral administration. In a milk-only lactation study in seven lactating 
women, who were already taking linaclotide therapeutically, neither linaclotide nor its active metabolite were 
detected in the milk. Therefore, breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the infant to linaclotide 
and Constella can be used during breast-feeding. 
The effect of linaclotide or its metabolite on milk production in lactating women have not been studied.
Fertility
Animal studies indicate that there is no effect on male or female fertility. 
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Constella has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
Linaclotide has been given orally to 1,166 patients with IBS-C in controlled clinical studies. Of these 
patients, 892 patients received linaclotide at the recommended dose of 290 micrograms per day. Total 
exposure in the clinical development plan exceeded 1,500 patient-years. The most frequently reported 
adverse reaction associated with Constella therapy was diarrhoea, mainly mild to moderate in intensity, 
occurring in less than 20% of patients. In rare and more severe cases, this may – as a consequence – lead to 
the occurrence of dehydration, hypokalaemia, blood bicarbonate decrease, dizziness, and orthostatic 
hypotension.
Other common adverse reactions (>1%) were abdominal pain, abdominal distension and flatulence. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
The following adverse reactions were reported in clinical studies at the recommended dose of 
290 micrograms per day with frequencies corresponding to: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 
1/10), uncommon (1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) and very rare (<1/10,000) and not 
known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Description of selected adverse reactions
Diarrhoea is the most common adverse reaction and is consistent with the pharmacological action of the 
active substance. 2% of treated patients experienced severe diarrhoea and 5% of patients discontinued 
treatment due to diarrhoea in clinical studies.
The majority of reported cases of diarrhoea were mild (43%) to moderate (47%); 2% of treated patients 
experienced severe diarrhoea. Approximately half of the diarrhoea episodes started within the first week of 
treatment.
The diarrhoea resolved within seven days in about one third of patients, however 80 patients (50%) 
experienced diarrhoea with a duration of more than 28 days (representing 9.9% of all patients treated with 
linaclotide).
Five percent of patients discontinued treatment due to diarrhoea in clinical studies. In those patients in whom
diarrhoea led to discontinuation, it resolved after a few days of discontinuing treatment. 
Elderly (>65 years), hypertensive and diabetic patients reported diarrhoea more frequently as compared to 
the overall IBS-C population included in the clinical trials.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked 
to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
An overdose may result in symptoms resulting from an exaggeration of the known pharmacodynamic effects 
of the medicinal product, mainly diarrhoea. In a study in healthy volunteers receiving a single dose of 
2,897 micrograms (up to 10-fold the recommended therapeutic dose) the safety profile in these subjects was 
consistent with that in the overall population, with diarrhoea being the most commonly reported adverse 
event. 
5
Should an overdose occur, the patient should be treated symptomatically and supportive measures instituted 
as required.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for constipation, other drugs for constipation, ATC Code: A06AX04
Mechanism of action
Linaclotide is a Guanylate Cyclase-C receptor agonist (GCCA) with visceral analgesic and secretory 
activities.
Linaclotide is a 14-amino acid synthetic peptide structurally related to the endogenous guanylin peptide 
family. Both linaclotide and its active metabolite bind to the GC-C receptor, on the luminal surface of the 
intestinal epithelium. Through its action at GC-C, linaclotide has been shown to reduce visceral pain and 
increase GI transit in animal models and increase colonic transit in humans. Activation of GC-C results in an 
increase in concentrations of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), both extracellularly and 
intracellularly. Extracellular cGMP decreases pain-fiber activity, resulting in reduced visceral pain in animal 
models. Intracellular cGMP causes secretion of chloride and bicarbonate into the intestinal lumen, through 
activation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which results in increased 
intestinal fluid and accelerated transit.
Pharmacodynamic effects
In a cross-over food interaction study, 18 healthy subjects were administered Constella 290 micrograms for 7 
days both in the fasting and fed state. Taking Constella immediately after a high fat breakfast resulted in 
more frequent and looser stools, as well as more gastrointestinal adverse events, compared with taking it in 
the fasted state.
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy of linaclotide was established in two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 
clinical studies in patients with IBS-C. In one clinical study (study 1), 804 patients were treated with 
Constella 290 micrograms or placebo once daily for 26 weeks. In the second clinical study (study 2), 800 
patients were treated for 12 weeks, and then re-randomised for an additional 4 weeks treatment period. 
During the 2-weeks pre-treatment baseline period, patients had a mean abdominal pain score of 5.6 (0-10 
scale) with 2.2% of abdominal pain-free days, a mean bloating score of 6.6 (0-10 scale), and an average of 
1.8 spontaneous bowel movements (SBM)/week.
The characteristics of the patient population included in Phase 3 clinical trials were as follows: mean age of 
43.9 years [range 18 - 87 years with 5.3% ≥ 65 years of age], 90.1% female. All patients met Rome II criteria 
for IBS-C and were required to report a mean abdominal pain score of ≥ 3 on a 0-to-10-point numeric rating 
scale (criteria that correspond to a moderate to severe IBS population), < 3 complete spontaneous bowel 
movements and ≤ 5 SBMs per week during a 2-week baseline period.
The co-primary endpoints in both clinical studies were 12-week IBS degree of relief responder rate and 
12 week abdominal pain/discomfort responder rate. An IBS degree of relief responder was a patient that was 
considerably or completely relieved for at least 50% of the treatment period; an abdominal pain/discomfort 
responder was a patient that had an improvement of 30% or more for at least 50% of the treatment period.
For the 12 weeks data, study 1 shows that 39% of the patients treated with linaclotide compared with 17% of 
the patients treated with placebo showed response to IBS degree of relief (p<0.0001) and 54% of the patients 
treated with linaclotide compared with 39% of the patients treated with placebo showed response to 
abdominal pain/discomfort (p<0.0001). Study 2 shows that 37% of the patients treated with linaclotide 
compared with 19% of the patients treated with placebo showed response to IBS degree of relief (p<0.0001) 
and 55% of the patients treated with linaclotide compared with 42% of the patients treated with placebo 
showed response to abdominal pain/discomfort (p=0.0002). 
6
For the 26 weeks data, study 1 shows that 37% and 54% of the patients treated with linaclotide compared 
with 17% and 36% of the patients treated with placebo showed response to IBS degree of relief (p<0.0001) 
and abdominal pain/discomfort (p<0.0001) respectively. 
In both studies, these improvements were seen by week 1 and sustained over the entire treatment periods 
(Figures 1 and 2). Linaclotide has been shown not to cause rebound effect when the treatment was stopped 
after 3 months continuous treatment.

Treatment with linaclotide also resulted in significant improvements in validated and disease-specific 
Quality of Life measure (IBS-QoL; p<0.0001), and EuroQoL (p = 0.001). Clinically meaningful response in 
overall IBS-QoL (> 14 points difference) was achieved in 54% of linaclotide treated patients vs. 39% in 
placebo treated patients.

Paediatric population
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of clinical studies with 
Constella in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in functional constipation (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption
In general, linaclotide is minimally detectable in plasma following therapeutic oral doses and therefore 
standard pharmacokinetic parameters cannot be calculated.
Following single doses of up to 966 micrograms and multiple doses up to 290 micrograms of linaclotide, 
there were no detectable plasma levels of parent compound or the active metabolite (des-tyrosine). When 
2,897 micrograms was administered on day 8, following a 7-day course of 290 micrograms/day, linaclotide 
was detectable in only 2 of 18 subjects at concentrations just above the lower limit of quantification of 
0.2 ng/ml (concentrations ranged from 0.212 to 0.735 ng/ml). In the two pivotal phase 3 studies in which 
patients were dosed with 290 micrograms of linaclotide once daily, linaclotide was only detected in 2 out of 
162 patients approximately 2 h following the initial linaclotide dose (concentrations were 0.241 ng/ml to 
0.239 ng/ml) and in none of the 162 patients after 4 weeks of treatment. The active metabolite was not 
detected in any of the 162 patients at any time point.
Distribution
As linaclotide is rarely detectable in plasma following therapeutic doses, standard distribution studies have 
not been conducted. It is expected that linaclotide is negligibly or not systemically distributed. 
Biotransformation
Linaclotide is metabolised locally within the gastrointestinal tract to its active primary metabolite, des-
tyrosine. Both linaclotide and des-tyrosine active metabolite are reduced and enzymatically proteolyzed
within the gastrointestinal tract to smaller peptides and naturally occurring amino acids.
The potential inhibitory activity of linaclotide and its active primary metabolite MM-419447 on the human 
efflux transporters BCRP, MRP2, MRP3, and MRP4 and the human uptake transporters OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, OATP2B1, PEPT1 and OCTN1 was investigated in vitro. Results of this study showed that 
neither peptide is an inhibitor of the common efflux and uptake transporters studied at clinically relevant 
concentrations.
The effect of linaclotide and its metabolites to inhibit the common intestinal enzymes (CYP2C9 and 
CYP3A4) and liver enzymes (CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4) or to induce liver 
enzymes (CYP1A2, 2B6, and 3A4/5) was investigated in vitro. Results of these studies showed that 
linaclotide and des-tyrosine metabolite are not inhibitors or inducers of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system.
Elimination
Following a single oral dose of 2,897 micrograms linaclotide on day 8, after a 7-day course of 
290 micrograms/day in 18 healthy volunteers, approximately 3 to 5% of the dose was recovered in the 
faeces, virtually all of it as the des-tyrosine active metabolite.
Age and gender
Clinical studies to determine the impact of age and gender on the clinical pharmacokinetics of linaclotide 
have not been conducted because it is rarely detectable in plasma. Gender is not expected to have any impact 
on dosing. For age related information, please see sections 4.2., 4.4., and 4.8.
Renal impairment
Constella has not been studied in patients who have renal impairment. Linaclotide is rarely detectable in 
plasma, therefore, renal impairment would not be expected to affect clearance of the parent compound or its 
metabolite.
8
Hepatic impairment
Constella has not been studied in patients who have hepatic impairment. Linaclotide is rarely detectable in 
plasma and is not metabolised by liver cytochrome P450 enzymes, therefore, hepatic impairment would not 
be expected to affect the metabolism or clearance of the parent drug or its metabolite.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, 
repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and toxicity to reproduction and development.

Possible side effects 
1. What Constella is and what it is used for
What Constella is used for
Constella contains the active substance linaclotide. It is used to treat the symptoms of moderate to severe 
irritable bowel syndrome (often just called “IBS”) with constipation in adult patients.
IBS is a common gut disorder.  The main symptoms of IBS with constipation include:



stomach or abdominal pain, 
feeling bloated, 
infrequent, hard, small or pellet-like stools (faeces).
These symptoms may vary from person to person. 
How Constella works
Constella acts locally in your gut, helping you to feel less pain and less bloated, and to restore the normal 
functioning of your bowels. It is not absorbed into the body, but attaches to receptor called guanylate cyclase 
C on the surface of your gut. By attaching to this receptor, it blocks the sensation of pain and allows liquid to 
enter from the body into the gut, thereby loosening the stools and increasing your bowel movements.
2. What you need to know before you take Constella
Do not take Constella
-
-
if you are allergic to linaclotide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).
if you or your doctor know that you have a blockage in your stomach or bowels.
Warnings and precautions 
Your doctor has given this medicine to you after excluding other diseases, especially of your bowels and 
concluding that you suffer from IBS with constipation. Because these other diseases may have the same 
symptoms as IBS, it is important that you report any change or irregularity in symptoms to your doctor 
promptly.
24
If you experience severe or prolonged diarrhoea (passing of frequent watery stools for 7 days or more), stop 
taking Constella and contact your doctor (see section 4). Make sure you drink plenty of fluids to replace the 
water and electrolytes like potassium lost from the diarrhoea.
If you have severe stomach symptoms which continue or get worse, stop taking Constella and contact your 
doctor immediately because these could be symptoms of a hole developing in the bowel wall 
(gastrointestinal perforation). See section 4. 
Talk to your doctor if you experience bleeding from the bowel or rectum.
Take special care if you are older than 65 years, as there is a higher risk you experience diarrhoea.
Take also special care if you have severe or prolonged diarrhoea and an additional disease, such as high 
blood pressure, previous disease of the heart and blood vessels (e.g. such as previous heart attacks) or 
diabetes.
Talk to your doctor if you suffer from inflammatory diseases of the guts such as Crohn’s disease or
ulcerative colitis as Constella is not recommended in these patients.
Children and adolescents
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents under the age of 18 years because the safety and 
efficacy of Constella in this age group has not been established.
Other medicines and Constella
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines:
 Some medicines may not work as effectively if you have severe or prolonged diarrhoea, such as:
- Oral contraceptives. If you have very bad diarrhoea, the contraceptive pill may not work properly and 
the use of an extra method of contraception is recommended. See the instructions in the patient leaflet 
of the contraceptive pill you are taking.
- Medicines that need careful and exact dosing, such as levothyroxine (a hormone to treat reduced 
function of the thyroid gland).
 Some medicines may increase the risk of diarrhoea when taken with Constella, such as:
- Medicines to treat stomach ulcers or excessive production of stomach acid called Proton Pump 
Inhibitors.
- Medicines to treat pain and inflammation called NSAIDs.
-
Laxatives.
Constella with food 
Constella produces more frequent bowel movements and diarrhoea (looser stools) when it is taken with food 
than when it is taken on an empty stomach (see section 3).
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Limited information is available on the effects of Constella in pregnant and breast-feeding women. 
Do not take this medicine if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, 
unless your doctor advises you to do so.
In a milk-only lactation study in seven lactating women, who were already taking linaclotide therapeutically, 
neither linaclotide nor its active metabolite were detected in the milk. Therefore breastfeeding is not 
expected to result in exposure of the infant to linaclotide and Constella can be used during breast-feeding.
Driving and using machines
Constella will not affect your ability to drive or use machines

How to take Constella
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you 
are not sure. 
The recommended dose is one capsule (i.e. 290 micrograms of linaclotide) taken orally once a day. The 
capsule should be taken at least 30 minutes before a meal.
If you have not experienced improvement in your symptoms after 4 weeks of treatment, you should contact 
your doctor.
If you take more Constella than you should
The most likely effect of taking too much Constella is diarrhoea. Contact your doctor or pharmacist if you 
have taken too much of this medicine.
If you forget to take Constella
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Just take the next dose at the scheduled time and 
continue as normal.
If you stop taking Constella
It is preferable to discuss stopping treatment with your doctor before actually doing so.  However, treatment 
with Constella can be safely stopped at any time. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

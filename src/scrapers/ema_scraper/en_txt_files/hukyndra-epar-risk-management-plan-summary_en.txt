Summary of risk management plan for Hukyndra 
(adalimumab) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Hukyndra. The RMP details important risks 
of Hukyndra, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about 
Hukyndra’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Hukyndra’s  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  give  essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Hukyndra should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Hukyndra should be read in the context of all this information including 
the  assessment  report  of  the  evaluation  and  its  plain-language  summary,  all  which  is  part  of  the 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Hukyndra’s 
RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Hukyndra is authorised for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis (Ps), hidradenitis suppurativa, Crohn’s 
disease  (CD),  paediatric  CD,  ulcerative  colitis  (UC),  paediatric  UC,  uveitis  and  paediatric  uveitis. 
Hukyndra 40 mg solution is also indicated in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), axial spondylarthritis, 
psoriatic arthritis, paediatric plaque Ps (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains adalimumab as 
the active substance, and it is given by subcutaneous route of administration. 
Further information about the evaluation of Hukyndra’s benefits can be found in Hukyndra’s EPAR, 
including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA  website,  under  the  medicine’s 
webpage https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/hukyndra. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further characterise 
the risks  
Important risks of Hukyndra, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies 
for learning more about Hukyndra’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific  information,  such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on  correct  use,  in  the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
• 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In  the  case  of  Hukyndra,  these  measures  are  supplemented  with  additional  risk  minimisation 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected  continuously  and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. 
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If  important  information  that  may  affect  the  safe  use  of  Hukyndra  is  not  yet  available,  it  is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  of  Hukyndra  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important 
risks  can  be  regarded  as  identified  or  potential.  Identified  risks  are  concerns  for  which  there  is 
sufficient  proof  of  a  link  with  the  use  of  Hukyndra.  Potential  risks  are  concerns  for  which  an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has 
not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on 
the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the 
long-term use of the medicine);

Important identified risk: Malignancies 
Risk factors and risk groups 
A prospective observational cohort study of 19,486 patients with 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including 7,727 patients with 
UC  or  unclassified  IBD,  found  an  increased  risk  for  developing 
receiving 
lymphoproliferative  disorders  among  patients 
thiopurines compared to patients who had never received these 
drugs  (hazard  ratio:  5.28;  95%  CI:  2.01-13.9)  [Beaugerie, 
2009]. 
Past  and  concomitant thiopurine therapy  appears to  contribute 
to the risk in patients with IBD. Other risks in Section SVII.3 may 
or may not be applicable to HSTCL which is rare [Kotlyar, 2011, 
Parakkal, 2011]. 
Risk factors for leukaemia depend on the type of leukaemia. In 
general, factors associated with an increased risk of leukaemia 
include smoking, exposure to certain chemicals such as benzene, 
exposure  to  radiation,  past  treatment  with  chemotherapy  or 
radiation therapy, having certain inherited or genetic disorders, 
having  certain  blood  disorders,  and  having  a  family  history  of 
leukaemia [National Cancer Institute, 2014]. 
antidepressants, 
Factors associated with an increased risk of skin cancer include 
radiation  (e.g.  sunlight,  tanning,  therapy),  personal  or  family 
history  of  melanoma,  fair  skin,  certain  drugs  (e.g.  antibiotics, 
[Peyrin-Biroulet, 
hormones, 
2011]), medical conditions or drugs that suppress the immune 
system,  damaged  skin  (old  scars,  burns,  ulcers,  or  areas  of 
inflammation),  and  exposure  to  arsenic  [National  Cancer 
Institute, 2011b]. Additional risk factors that increase squamous 
cell cancer risk are human papilloma virus infection and actinic 
keratosis [National Cancer Institute, 2011b]. 
thiopurines 
Factors  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  melanoma  include 
ultraviolet radiation (e.g. sunlight, tanning), personal history of 
melanoma, family history of melanoma, fair skin, certain drugs 
(e.g. antibiotics, hormones, antidepressants), medical conditions 
that suppress the immune system or are treated with drugs that 
suppress  the  immune  system,  dysplastic  nevus,  and  having 
many common moles [National Cancer Institute, 2011b]. 
Factors  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  MCC  include 
advanced age, immunosuppression (e.g. organ transplant, HIV), 
other  cancers  (e.g.  squamous  cell  carcinoma,  basal  cell 
internal  malignancies  and 
carcinoma,  Bowen  disease, 
haematological  neoplasias)  and  ultraviolet 
light  exposure 
[Becker, 2010a]. 
Risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk minimisation measures:

Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Data from adalimumab trials. 
Factors associated with an increased risk of MS include genetic 
predisposition  (e.g.  HLA-DR2  [HLADRB1  *15],  ethnic  origin 
(being  white),  female  sex,  Epstein-Barr  infection,  smoking, 
latitude/vitamin  D,  and  early  exposure  to  environmental  risk 
factors) [Ramagopalan, 2010]. 
Factors  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  GBS  include  male 
sex,  Campylobacter  jejuni  infection,  some  vaccines,  and 
increased age [Sejvar, 2011]. 
Subjects  with  intermediate  uveitis  have  a  high  prevalence  of 
demyelination  [Zein,  2004;  Burkholder,  2012;  Llorenc,  2012; 
Messenger, 2015].

Risk factors and risk groups 
PML  occurs  predominantly  among  severely  immunosuppressed 
patients.  Currently,  over  80%  of  PML  cases  are  diagnosed  in 
patients with HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) 
[Weber, 2008]. Prior to the era of HIV and AIDS, more than 60% 
of  PML  cases  were  seen  in  patients  with  lymphoproliferative 
disorders,  with  the  highest  incidence  reported  in  patients  with 
[Carson,  2009].  Other 
chronic 
immunosuppressive  conditions  that  put  patients  at  risk  of 
developing  PML 
include  malignancies,  organ  transplants, 
systemic  lupus  erythematosus  (SLE)  and  other  rheumatic 
diseases [Bartt, 2006; Eng, 2006; Calabrese, 2007; Govindappa, 
2007; Carson, 2009].

Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan     
Summary of risk management plan for Sixmo 
(buprenorphine) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Sixmo. The RMP details important risks 
of Sixmo, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about 
Sixmo's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Sixmo's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Sixmo should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Sixmo should be read in the context of all this information including 
the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part of the 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Sixmo's RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Sixmo is authorised for substitution treatment for opioid dependence in clinically stable adult 
patients who require no more than 8 mg/day of sublingual buprenorphine, within a framework of 
medical, social and psychological treatment. Sixmo should be used as part of a complete treatment 
program, to include counselling and psychosocial support (see SmPC for the full indication). It 
contains buprenorphine as the active substance and it is an implant inserted subcutaneously in the 
inner side of the upper arm. 
Further information about the evaluation of Sixmo’s benefits can be found in Sixmo’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s 
webpage https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/sixmo. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to 
minimize or further characterize the risks  
Important risks of Sixmo, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies 
for learning more about Sixmo's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
• 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In the case of Sixmo, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimization measures 
mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Sixmo is not yet available, it is listed under 
‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Sixmo are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Sixmo. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to 
information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

II.B Summary of important risks 
Important identified risk: Protrusion or expulsion of the SC implant 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
Implant protrusion and expulsion were reported 
medicine 
infrequently in the clinical development program for 
Sixmo.  
Risk factors and risk groups 
The risk of protrusion or expulsion is increased by 
improper insertion of the implant, manipulation by the 
patient after insertion, and infection at the insertion site.

Insertion and removal of the Sixmo implants must 
be performed by a physician or other qualified 
healthcare professional who is competent in minor 
surgery and has been trained to conduct the 
insertion and removal procedure, SmPC, section 
4.2 
Detailed instructions describing a step by step 
process for implant insertion / removal are 
provided in the SmPC, section 4.2 
The same removal technique is employed for the 
removal of protruding or partially expelled 
implants. Exploratory surgery without knowledge of

Important identified risk: Respiratory depression / respiratory failure 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
In the clinical development program for Sixmo, reports of 
medicine 
respiratory depression or failure were rare and the 
incidence was similar across the Sixmo, placebo implant, 
and SL buprenorphine groups. In the pivotal studies, there 
were no SAEs associated with respiratory failure reported 
for subjects on Sixmo.  
Nevertheless, a number of cases of death due to 
respiratory depression have been reported while on 
buprenorphine, particularly when buprenorphine was used 
in combination with benzodiazepines or when 
buprenorphine was not used according to prescribing 
information. Deaths have also been reported in association 
with concomitant administration of buprenorphine and 
other depressants such as alcohol or other opioids. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patients administered buprenorphine in combination with 
benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including 
alcohol) and patients who misuse buprenorphine by self-
injection are a greater risk of respiratory depression and 
death.

progression of opioid dependence and addictive 
behaviours suggesting the need for more intensive 
and structured treatment for substance use in the 
SmPC, section 4.4 
Recommendation to warn patients that it is extremely 
dangerous to self-administer non-prescribed 
benzodiazepines while taking Sixmo, and should also 
be cautioned to use benzodiazepines concurrently with 
Sixmo only as directed by their healthcare 
professional, in the SmPC, section 4.5

Important identified risk: Hepatitis, hepatic events, use in patients with hepatic failure 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
Cases of hepatitis and hepatic events have been observed 
medicine 
in individuals receiving SL buprenorphine and in the Sixmo 
clinical development programme. As buprenorphine is 
extensively metabolized by the liver, plasma levels can be 
expected to be higher in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment; Sixmo is not suitable for use in patients with 
severe hepatic impairment.  
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patients with pre-existing liver impairment or with 
conditions that make them more susceptible to liver 
impairment (e.g., through disease or alcohol abuse).

Studies in animals, as well as clinical experience, have 
medicine 
demonstrated that buprenorphine may produce 
dependence, but at a lower level than a full agonist, such 
as morphine.

medicine 
buprenorphine use at a level warranting a fifth implant 
were seen in approximately 20% of subjects in Studies 
PRO-805 and PRO-806. In Study PRO-814, in clinically 
stable patients and in which a fifth implant was not an 
option, a smaller percentage of subjects required 
supplemental SL buprenorphine.  
Risk factors and risk groups 
All patients beginning treatment with Sixmo are at risk of 
developing opioid withdrawal syndrome.

Important identified risk: Use during pregnancy and lactation (effects on newborn and infant) 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
The potential for buprenorphine to induce effects on 
medicine 
embryo-fetal development and/or effects on pre- and 
postnatal development is described in the literature, 
indicating that buprenorphine is embryotoxic at maternal 
toxic dosages, but is not teratogenic. Effects were also 
noted with respect to developmental milestones in pups 
from buprenorphine-treated dams. 
Due to the lack of safer alternatives, there is considerable 
clinical experience on the use of buprenorphine in the 
treatment of opioid dependence during pregnancy. As 
reviewed by Farid et al (2008), clinical retrospective and 
prospective studies on buprenorphine maintenance for 
pregnant opioid-dependent women indicated that it is well 
tolerated and safe. Neonatal outcomes are not conclusive, 
 
 
 
 
 
as studies are limited. Nevertheless, most pregnancies lack 
complications with neonatal outcomes, including birth 
weight, APGAR scores, head circumference and body 
length, being within normal ranges. Notwithstanding the 
benefits of managing pregnant opioid-dependent women 
with buprenorphine, caution is needed as adverse effects 
have been associated with this treatment.  
The use of buprenorphine during pregnancy is known to 
cause neonatal abstinence syndrome in the infant (Johnson 
et al, 2003). 
Buprenorphine and its metabolites are excreted in human 
breast milk (Lindemalm et al, 2009). Therefore, 
breastfeeding should be discontinued during treatment with 
buprenorphine. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Neonates born to women using opioids or breast-fed by 
women using opioids.

Evidence for linking the risk to the 
Cases of nerve injury have been reported during insertion 
medicine 
and, in particular, during the removal of contraceptive 
implants. There were reports of possible damage to nerves 
 
 
 
or blood vessels in the clinical development program for 
Sixmo; all were non-serious and did not lead to study drug 
discontinuation.  
Risk factors and risk groups 
Improper insertion, excessive palpitation or manipulation of 
the implants post-insertion, or significant weight gain post-
insertion may make the implants more difficult to locate, 
increasing the risk of damage to the nerves or blood 
vessels during removal.

Study short name: Prospective descriptive observational study of insertion-, localization-
, and removal-related events and their sequelae associated with the use of Probuphine 1 
(PRO-816) 
Purpose of the study: The rationale for study PRO-816 is to determine the incidence of and 
characterize insertion-, localization-, and removal-related serious adverse events and their 
sequelae associated with the use of Probuphine. The registry will evaluate the safety of the 
implants under real-world conditions. There will be no investigational interventions; enrolled 
patients will receive treatment and evaluations for their opioid addiction as determined by their 
treating healthcare professionals.  
The primary objective of this registry is to determine the incidence of clinically significant linked 
Probuphine implant insertion-removal complications. The secondary objectives are also related to 
safety.  
The study will address the following safety concerns: Protrusion or expulsion of the SC implant, 
Infection at the insertion or removal site (both important identified risks); Damage to nerves or 
blood vessels during insertion and/or removal procedure, Implant migration and/or missing implant 
or partial implant (both important potential risks); Patients >65 years old (missing information).

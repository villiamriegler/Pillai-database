Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for indacaterol, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Onbrez, Oslif and Hirobriz Breezhalers have been on the market since 2009 with information cards for 
Health Care Professionals (HCPs) underlining that the products are for adult use only for the treatment 
of COPD and not asthma, at a dose of 150 micrograms daily.  European Post Authorisation Safety 
Study (PASS) study (QAB149B2431), performed 01-Mar-2010 to 31 Dec 2013, showed that the 
proportion of indacaterol initiators with a diagnosis of “pure” asthma was below 10%, whereas the 
proportion with pure asthma and mixed disease (i.e., patients with COPD and asthma without ICS 
therapy) was 7.4%.  The results support that HCPs appear to be sufficiently aware that indacaterol 
must only be used in COPD. 
Medication error regarding strength has not been reported. 
No new safety information has arisen regarding incorrect indication use or dose for products containing 
indacaterol alone.  As information in the educational materials for HCPs is sufficiently described in 
relevant sections of the SmPC, the PRAC agreed that the additional risk minimisation measures are no 
longer required. 
Therefore, the RMP was updated to remove reference to additional risk minimisation measures 
throughout Parts V and VI.  The Annex IID was amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for indacaterol the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing indacaterol is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

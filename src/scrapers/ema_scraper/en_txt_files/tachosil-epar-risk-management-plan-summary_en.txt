Part VI: Summary of risk management plan for TachoSil 
(Human Fibrinogen, Human Thrombin) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for TachoSil. The RMP details important risks of 
TachoSil, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about TachoSil 
risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
TachoSil summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential information 
to healthcare professionals and patients on how TachoSil should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for TachoSil should be read in the context of all this information including the 
assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part of the European 
Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of TachoSil RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
TachoSil is indicated in adults and children aged 1month to 18 years for supportive treatment in surgery, 
for improvement of haemostasis, to promote tissue sealing, for suture support in vascular surgery where 
standard  techniques  are  insufficient,  and  for  supportive  sealing  of  the  dura  mater  to  prevent 
postoperative cerebrospinal leakage following neurological surgery. 
Further information about the evaluation of TachoSil’s benefits can be found in TachoSil’s EPAR, including 
in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA  website,  under  the  medicine’s  webpage 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/tachosil    link  to  the  EPAR  summary  landing 
page.  
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to 
minimise or further characterise the risks  
Important risks of TachoSil, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies 
for learning more about TachoSil’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
• 
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
 
 
 
 
 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected  continuously  and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. 
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of TachoSil is not yet available, it is listed under 
‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of TachoSil, are risks that need special risk management activities to further investigate 
or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important risks can be 
regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a 
link with the use of TachoSil. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this 
medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs 
further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that 
is currently missing and needs to be collected.

II.B Summary of important risks 
Important identified risk: Thrombotic and embolic events 
Evidence for linking the risk 
Treatment with Tachosil, may lead to the development of thrombotic 
to the medicine 
and embolic events. 
Thromboembolic  complications  may  occur  if  the  preparation  is 
applied intravascularly.  
Based on data from the integrated dataset the expected number of 
patients  affected  by  a  thromboembolic  event  is  1.92%  (95%-CI: 
0.92%  to  3.50%).  This  is  however  not  expected  to  be  due  to 
treatment with TachoSil, but due to the surgical procedure and the 
underlying  disease.  Thromboembolic  events  are  expected  only  if 
TachoSil is applied intravascularly. 
There  were  52  reported  events  of  thrombotic  and  embolic  events 
during  clinical  studies  with  TachoSil  and  83  events  from  post-
marketing sources. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Known  risk  factors  for  thromboembolic  events  are:  cardiovascular 
risk 
factors  (atherosclerosis,  angina  pectoris,  chronic  atrial 
fibrillation,  congestive  heart  failure,  own  or  family  history  of 
thromboembolic 
event, 
hypercholesterolemia, 
hypertension, 
inherited  hypercoagulable  states, 
ischemic  heart 
failure, 
left 
ventricular  hypertrophy,  smoking,  varicose  veins),  chronic 
obstructive  pulmonary  disease,  cancer,  diabetes  mellitus,  hormone 
therapy,  hypothyroidism,  pregnancy,  sepsis,  and  abnormal 
electrocardiogram, age (60-79 years), recent steroid use, body mass 
index≥35 kg/m2, and postoperative complications, including wound 
infection,  reintubation,  cardiac  arrest,  urinary  tract  infection,  acute 
renal 
insufficiency,  postoperative 
transfusion,  perioperative 
myocardial infarction, and pneumonia.

Important identified risk: Immunological events including hypersensitivity 
Evidence for linking the risk 
Treatment  with  TachoSil  may

hypersensitivity. 
There  were  14  reported  events  of  hypersensitivity  during  clinical 
studies with TachoSil and 44 events from post-marketing sources. 
 
 
 
 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patients with a history of immune system disorders or multiple  
allergies  may  be  at  greater  risk  of  a  hypersensitivity  reaction  to 
TachoSil.  
Comorbid  disease,  including  atopic  eczema/dermatitis  and  asthma 
may be associated with increased risk of anaphylaxis [8].

Important identified risk:  Gastrointestinal obstruction 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
TachoSil can  stick  to  the  surrounding/adjacent surfaces that  may  
be  covered  with  blood  if  the  surgical  site  is  inadequately  prepared 
and/or  not  cleansed  of  residual  blood,  or  if  TachoSil  is  applied 
inappropriately. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
There were 7 reported events of gastrointestinal obstruction during 
clinical  studies  with  TachoSil  and  14  events  from  post-marketing 
sources. 
TachoSil  is  used  in  both  abdominal  and  non-abdominal  surgical 
indications. The risk of GI obstruction concerns the group who 
undergo  abdominal  surgeries  only.  The  risk  of  adhesion  and 
subsequent  obstruction  increases  if  the  surgical  site  and  adjacent 
tissues are inadequately prepared and/or cleansed of residual blood. 
There  are  a  number  of  potential  risk  factors  for  development  of 
adhesions  in  patients  that  undergo  abdominal  surgery  including 
longer operative time and prior abdominal surgeries [18].

Important potential risk: Transmission of infectious agents 
Evidence for linking the risk 
When  medicines,  like  Tachosil  are  prepared  from  human  blood  or 
to the medicine 
plasma  are  administered,  the  possibility  of  passing  on  infection 
cannot  be  totally  excluded.  This  also  applies  to  any  unknown  or 
emerging viruses or other types of infections. 
There  were  2  reported  events  of  transmission  of  infectious  agents 
during  clinical  studies  with  TachoSil  and  16  events  from  post-
marketing sources, but there are no confirmed cases of transmission 
of infectious agents associated with the use of TachoSil.  
Risk factors and risk groups 
Many of the patients undergoing major surgical procedures are likely 
to  have  many  comorbid  conditions.  They  are  also  likely  to  require 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
transfusion of blood or blood products before or after the surgery and 
thus are more likely to have transmission of infectious agents from 
the transfusion.

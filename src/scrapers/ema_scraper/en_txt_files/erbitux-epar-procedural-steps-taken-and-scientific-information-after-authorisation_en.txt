issues related to the efficacy of Erbitux further to the 
restriction of the colorectal cancer indication, for which the 
evidence of wild-type RAS (KRAS and NRAS) status is 
required before initiating treatment with Erbitux. Upon 
submission of the application for the restriction of indication 
in October 2013, analyses of the interaction between RAS 
mutation status and treatment outcome in the pivotal first-
line phase III cetuximab trials EMR 62 202-013 (CRYSTAL – 
cetuximab in combination with irinotecan-based 
chemotherapy) and FIRE-3 (randomised first-line phase III 
comparing head-to-head FOLFIRI combined with either 
cetuximab or bevacizumab in KRAS wild-type mCRC) were 
still ongoing. The Erbitux Product Information has been 
updated in order to include these new efficacy data by RAS 
tumour status. The data lend further support to the 
restriction of the Erbitux metastatic colorectal cancer 
indication to patients with wild-type RAS (KRAS and NRAS) 
tumours.

Further to a PRAC recommendation, the MAH performed a 
to amend administration recommendations and 
expand on the existing warning related to infusion-
related reactions in the course of Erbitux treatment. 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC is also amended with 
deletion of information related to infusion reactions, 
as this information is being reflected in section 4.4 
instead and a cross-reference to section 4.4 is being 
introduced. In addition, a minor deletion is made in 
section 4.2 of the SmPC. The Package Leaflet is 
updated accordingly.

Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the 
cumulative review of case reports of cytokine release 
syndrome. In addition, the MAH conducted a review of the 
available evidence (from literature) in order to better define 
the risk of infusion-related reactions and to mitigate this 
risk with appropriate recommendations in the product 
information. As a result, information regarding the risk 
factors, presentation and management of infusion-related 
reactions, including cytokine release syndrome, was 
extensively revised in section 4.4 of the SmPC and relevant 
administration recommendations were updated in section 
4.2 of the SmPC.

inhibitors was added that patients who may develop ocular 
toxicities while receiving Erbitux should be monitored for 
evidence of keratitis or ulcerative keratitis and therapy 
should be interrupted or discontinued if patients present 
with ulcerative keratitis, while continuation should be 
carefully considered with keratitis in the absence of corneal 
ulceration. Erbitux should be used cautiously in patients 
with a history of keratitis, ulcerative keratitis or severe dry 
eye. Use of contact lenses has also been associated with 
keratitis and ulceration of the cornea.

editorial changes were also made to the SmPC.

Product Information (PI) was amended to include this

3 skin reactions according to the Common Terminology 
Criteria of Adverse Events (CTCAE) in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC was deleted as it does not represent all clinical 
situations that would require dose adjustment as 
recommended in section 4.4 of the SmPC. Finally, 
gastrointestinal (GI) perforation and radiation dermatitis, 
which may both occur in the course of treatment with 
cetuximab, will remain under close monitoring in the Risk

warranted.

(CA225025) and updated efficacy data from pivotal 
studies CRYSTAL (EMR 62 202-013) and OPUS (EMR 
62 202-047). Update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5 and 
4.8 of the SmPC based on the above and other 
studies of Erbitux combination with chemotherapy 
primarily with the aim to prevent use of Erbitux in 
patients with mutant KRAS and to include 
information regarding cardiovascular events. The PL 
which cetuximab was administered in combination with 
chemotherapy were reported for patients with wild-type 
and mutant KRAS tumours (SmPC section 5.1). The 
updated data confirmed the positive effect in patient with 
wild-type tumour status and the possibly detrimental effect 
in patients with mutant KRAS tumours. Warnings against 
use of cetuximab in patients with mutant KRAS tumours 
were strengthened (SmPC section 4.2) and awareness was 
raised towards an increased incidence of cardiovascular 
adverse events associated with the use of cetuximab

SmPC, Annex 
Since the first marketing approval the product labelling for 
II, Labelling 
cetuximab has been updated as necessary to reflect 
and PL 
identified new risks. Any additional data significant for the 
assessment of the benefit/risk profile of cetuximab have 
been submitted and evaluated. The known risks are 
adequately described and quantified when necessary in the 
currently approved product labelling. In summary, the 
efficacy data from all data sources reviewed over the last 
five years confirms that cetuximab, both in its original 2 
mg/ml and in its new formulation 5 mg/ml, has an efficacy 
profile in the approved indications that is in line with the 
currently approved product labelling. On the basis of 
cumulative PSUR data since the first approval of cetuximab 
it is considered that newly identified risks have been 
adequately addressed and included in the product labelling. 
The renewal of the MA of cetuximab is therefore supported 
by a confirmed positive benefit /risk balance. 
Based on data provided with this application and other 
known data the conclusion of the assessment is that there 
are no major changes in the efficacy or safety of 
Page 21/27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Erbitux/Cetuximab affecting the risk benefit balance of the 
product in any direction. The SPC and the RMP has been 
regularly updated since the first approval and no further 
changes are considered urgently needed, i.e. to be included 
in this application. 
The CHMP is of the opinion that the renewal can be granted 
with unlimited validity.  
The Marketing Authorisation Holder will continue to submit 
Periodic Safety Update Reports yearly.

This Line Extension concerns a new formulation containing 
addition of a new formulation at strength of 5 mg/ml

glycine, citric acid, Tween 80 and sodium chloride 
cetuximab. 
PL 
presented at a strength of 5mg/ml cetuximab and available 
Annex I_2.(c) Change or addition of a new 
strength/potency 
in 4 presentations (10, 20, 50 and 100 ml vials).  The 
previously approved formulation contains 2mg/ml of 
cetuximab in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), presented in 
a 50 ml vial. This Line extension application also introduced 
an additional manufacturer of  the finished product as well 
as changes to the manufacturing process of the active 
substance. 
Following initial evaluation of this medicinal product  it was 
established that precipitation of cetuximab occurs during 
storage, yielding visible particles. Also, sub-visible particles 
were present at levels exceeding the Ph.Eur. limits for 
parenteralia. However, the product was exempted from this 
test since it is used with a filter for administration. The new 
formulation resolves this issue and as a consequence the 
administration of Erbitux 5 mg/ml does not require use of 
an in-line filter and this has been adequately reflected in 
the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package 
Leaflet. 
Page 25/27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The quality of the product has been demonstrated to be 
satisfactory. Outstanding issues identified during the 
evaluation will be addressed and evaluated as part of on-
going post-marketing follow-up measures. Comparative 
pharmacokinetic and toxicology studies did not raise 
concerns and were satisfactory. Clinical data were not 
provided which was considered acceptable. All 
requirements with respect to quality, efficacy and safety for 
this product have been satisfactorily fulfilled and as a 
consequence the CHMP issued a positive opinion for Erbitux 
5 mg/ml.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The indication is for the treatment of adult patients with Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia (WM), 
who have received at least 1 prior therapy, or in first-line treatment for patients unsuitable for chemo-
immunotherapy.   
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
The median age in WM is 70-years, and the age-adjusted incidence rate for males/females is 0.92 and 
0.3 per 100.000 respectively, with 60% being males. A higher male predominance has been reported 
in Asia (Jeong et al, Blood 2018). WM is extremely rare in children, and the incidence increases with 
age (Brandefors et al, Br J Haematol 2018). WM represents 1-2% of all hematologic malignancies, and 
in the USA, there are 1000 to 1500 new cases / year (1/260.000). A similar epidemiology and a 
prevalence of 1/102.220, is noted in Europe as in all 7.200 persons are living with WM (Kaeb et al, 
StatPearls 2020; Orphanet 2020). WM is reported with a higher incidence (RR 1.5) in Caucasians than 
among African-American and Asian-Pacific subjects (Teras et al, CA Can J Clin 2016). 
The epidemiology indicates that sex, race and age per se are risk factors. Clustering of B-cell neoplasia 
and familial predisposition in the role of genomics have been described (Treon et al, Ann Oncol 2006; 
Kapoor et al, Curr Treat Options Oncol 2016). No specific exogenously risk factors have been identified 
in progressive lymphoplasmacytic proliferations, and hepatitis have not consistently been related to 
WM (Sanjose et al, Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol 2014; WHO_2016). There is no rational in screening for 
IgM monoclonality, but observation of an IgM isotype in blood-samples in 10-20% of the 3% of 
persons older than 50-years, who have MGUS is a reasonable cause for a careful diagnostic work-up 
due to the risk of the underlying conditions, associated with IgM gammopathy (Grunenberg & Buske, 
Dtsch Ârztebl 2017) 
2.1.3.  Biologic features, Aetiology and pathogenesis 
WM originates in the bone marrow, which is infiltrated by a heterogeneous population of post-germinal 
center, hyper-mutated, monoclonal, low-proliferating cells, from small B-lymphocytes 
(CD19+,20+,22+,25+,79a+) to differentiated plasma cells (CD138+), producing a monoclonal IgM 
(Braggio et al, Haematologica 2012; Wang & Lin, Pathology 2020).  
Several genetic abnormalities are associated with WM, including structural aberrant cytogenetic, gene 
mutations and possibly epigenetic mechanisms, no one is disease specific. Genes involved like the 
MYD88 (Myeloid differentiation primary response 88) gene, mutated in position L265P, and CXCR4 (C-
X-C chemokine receptor type 4), which shows a more variable mutational pattern and may involve 
WHIM (-like) mutations (Xu et al, Br J Hameatol 2016) in WM, are also associated with solid and other 
haematological malignancies and other disorders. The WHIM syndrome is a rare combined primary 
immunodeficiency disorder caused by autosomal dominant gain-of-function mutations in the 
chemokine receptor, causing warts, hypo-gammaglobulinaemia, recurrent infections, and myelokathexi 
 
(bone marrow retention) (Heusinkveld et al, Exp Op Orphan Drugs 2017), but in WM it is an acquired 
mutation. 
Genomic abnormalities at diagnosis include del(6q) (50%), hyper-mutation in IGHV, t(9;14) (50%), 
CXCR4 (WHIM-like) mutations (30%) and MYD88L265P  mutations  (90-95%). Deletions involving 
chromosome 6q are common in MYD88MUT patients and include genes that modulate NFķβ, BCL2, 
Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK), and apoptosis. CXCR4 mutational status in combinations with MYD88 
also influences the sensitivity of BTK inhibitor (BTKi) in the signalling pathways in WM. MYD88 
mutations are detectable in 50% to 80% of IgM MGUS cases, suggesting an early oncogenic role for 
WM pathogenesis. Unrevealing the BTK pathophysiology has a rational impact on treatment strategies 
in WM with ibrutinib and zanubrutinib (Hunter et al, J Clin Oncol 2017;Sacco et al, Oncotarget 2017; 
Treon et al, J Clin Oncol 2020).  Zanubrutinib is developed in B-cell malignancies due to the ubiquitous 
importance of BTK in the pathophysiology of these disorders (Hendriks et al, Nat Rev Cancer 2014).  
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
WM presents as indolent cases (for many years), to IgM-induced hyperviscosity (normally >40 g/L in 
blood, 30%) causing bleeding and visual disturbances, night-sweats, weight loss, and bone marrow-
infiltration induced anaemia and neutropenia. Tissue deposition of the M-component and autoimmunity 
nay present as peripheral neuropathy (25-50%), thermo-proteins, amyloid (heart) involvement and 
haemolysis (Vijay & Gertz Blood 2007). The diagnosis of WM requires confirmation of bone marrow 
infiltration by monoclonal LPL cells and serum IgM of any amount, by immunofixation, and a complete 
clinical status (Kastritis Et al, ESMO guideline Ann Oncol 2018).  
Patients with wild-type MYD88 show lower bone marrow disease burden, lowest in combination with 
CXCR4wild-type, and serum immunoglobulin M levels, and an increased risk of death due to 
transformation to aggressive lymphoma. Patients with CXCR4 mutations have higher bone marrow 
disease burden, and those with nonsense CXCR4 mutations have higher serum immunoglobulin M 
levels and incidence of symptomatic hyperviscosity (Treon et al, Blood 2014; Hunter et al, J Clin Oncol 
2017).  
Patients with WM is staged by a risk score for overall survival, based on age (>65 years), B-
haemoglobin ≤11.5 g/dL, platelets ≤100 x109/L, β2-microglobulin >3 mg/L, and serum-monoclonal 
protein concentration > 70 g/L. The five covariates separate patients in low-risk (27%), intermediate-
risk (38%), and high-risk patients (35%), age being the dominant factor. The five-year survival rates 
were 87%, 68%, and 36%, respectively (Morel et al, Blood 2009).  Patients under the age of 70-years, 
in previous retrospective studies have a median survival in excess of 10 years; those older than 70-
years less than 7-years and age-dependent (Castillo et al, Br J Haematol 2015). Despite the survival 
has improved, the prognosis, relapsing disease and debilitating symptoms provide an unmet need. 
2.1.5.  Management 
The applied indication reflects that patients with Waldenström’s macrglobulinaemia (WM) have a 
relapsing course on medical treatment. Therapeutic strategies in WM is based on individual patient (fit, 
unfit / co-morbidity) and disease characteristics (indolent or endurable). WM is very chemo-sensitive, 
with overall response rate of 90% in first line. Autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplantation has 
a role in (some) younger patients, often with early relapses.  
 
 
Treatment is indicated only to reduce symptoms and subsequent organ damage, due to rheological and 
autoimmune manifestations, bone marrow-insufficiency and bulky disease (Dimopoulus et al, Blood 
2014). Algorithms in first line in most patients include 4-6 cycles of chemo-immuno-therapy 
combinations with rituximab, alkylators, glucocorticoid, and proteasome inhibitor. Durable responses 
provided by drugs often used in B-cell malignancies, and maintenance with anti-CD20 antibody 
(rituximab) is recommended. All patients, treatment naïve (TN) or relapsed / refractory (RR) are 
candidates to be included in clinical trials, to further improve efficacy and / or reduce adverse events. 
These SOC may be repeated in later lines, depending on time to relapse and an individual re-
assessment.  
The approval of the BTKi Imbruvica (ibrutinib) in WM in 2015 in EU, represents a novel, effective and 
oral treatment option for both TN and RR patients, continued daily until progression or intolerance, and 
without the potential risk of secondary malignancy, by SOC combinations (Leblond et al, Blood 2016; 
ESMO guideline, Ann Oncol 2018).  Responses are evaluated by internationally accepted criteria, 
reflecting reductions in objective clinical and para-clinical parameters (Owen et al, Br J Haematol 
2013), added the major response (MR, partial response or better) in the ibrutinib development. By 
these criteria, ibrutinib monotherapy in RR patients gave a very good partial response (VGPR) and MR 
of 15.9% and 77.7%, respectively. Complete responses (CR) are unusual, which supports CR + VGPR 
as a primary endpoint. With a median follow-up of 47.1 months, median PFS for all patients was not 
reached. Median PFS has also not been reached for MYD88MUTCXCR4wild-type patients. For 
MYD88L265PCXCR4MUT patients, the median PFS was 45 and 21 months for MYD88wild-typeCXCR4wild-type 
patients. Adverse events of grade 2 or higher included neutropenia (22%) and thrombocytopenia 
(14%). Comparable results have been presented in treatment naïve (TN) WM (Treon et al, NEJM 2015; 
Treon et al, J Clin Oncol 2018; Papanota et al, J Blood Med 2019). The comparable results in TN and 
RR WM likely reflects that BTK dependent pathways are not the only important drivers in WM. 
About the product 
Zanubrutinib, (Brukinsa), is a FIH, oral, second generation BTK inhibitor (BTKi) an inhibitor of Bruton’s 
tyrosine kinase (BTK). Zanubrutinib forms a covalent bond with a cysteine residue in the BTK active 
site, leading to inhibition of BTK activity. BTK is a signalling molecule of the B-cell antigen receptor 
(BCR) and cytokine receptor pathways. In B-cells, BTK signalling results in activation of pathways 
necessary for B-cell proliferation, trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion (see SmPC section 5.1).  
It is intended as monotherapy for the indication “treatment of adult patients with WM, who have 
received at least 1 prior therapy, or in first-line treatment for patients unsuitable for chemo-
immunotherapy” (see SmPC section 4.1). 
Zanubrutinib is formulated as oral capsules of 80mg. The recommended total daily dose of 
zanubrutinib is 320 mg. The daily dose may be taken either once daily (four 80 mg capsules) or 
divided into two doses of 160 mg twice daily (two 80 mg capsules) (see SmPC section 4.2). 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product (FP) is presented as hard capsules containing 80 mg of zanubrutinib as active 
substance (AS).  
 
Other ingredients are: 
- in capsule content: microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, sodium lauryl sulphate (E487), 
colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate;  
- in capsule shell: gelatin, titanium dioxide (E171);

The product is available in HDPE bottles with PP child-resistant screw cap as described in section 6.5 of 
the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of zanubrutinib is (7S)-2-(4-phenoxyphenyl)-7-[1-(prop-2-enoyl)piperidin-4-yl]-
4,5,6,7-tetrahydropyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine-3-carboxamide. It corresponds to the molecular formula 
C27H29N5O3. Its relative molecular mass is 471.55 and it has the chemical structure shown below. 
Figure 1.Chemical structure of zanubrutinib. 
The structure of the active substance (AS) was adequately elucidated by a combination of mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS), elemental analysis, ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy, FTIR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, and 
X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD). Physicochemical properties were investigated by optical rotation, 
single crystal X-ray, polymorph screening (salt screening), Dynamic vapor sorption (DVS), differential 
scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), particle size distribution, microscopic 
image by polarized light microscopy (PLM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Data and spectra 
with interpretations have been presented.  
Zanubrutinib appears as white to off-white, slightly hygroscopic, crystalline powder. It is freely soluble 
in methanol, soluble in ethanol and acetone, slightly soluble in pH 1.2 hydrochloric acid buffer, very 
slightly soluble or practically insoluble in aqueous buffers (pH range 2.0 - 8.0). The AS pKa is 3.33 and 
its partition coefficient LogP was found to be 4.21. 
Zanubrutinib is an optically active compound having the (S)-configuration at the single stereocentre. 
The configuration of this chiral centre cannot interconvert to form the (R)-enantiomer. 
The AS exhibits polymorphism. Only one crystal form (Form A) was observed in polymorph screening 
and routine process. XRPD showed zanubrutinib to be crystalline with distinctive diffraction peaks.

The active substance is synthesised from two regulatory starting materials with appropriate 
specifications. The synthetic process consists of six process stages including micronisation. Reaction 
schemes for the starting materials, including information on the reagents/solvents used, as well as 
adequate details on manufacturers have been provided. The information provided on the two starting 
materials has been found satisfactory and they are considered acceptable.  
Critical steps/process parameters have been identified and justified. The in-process controls are 
described in detail. Normal operating range (NOR) and proven acceptable range (PAR) for each 
indexed parameter are presented. Assignment and justification of critical process parameters (CPPs) 
was accomplished using a combination of quality risk assessment (QRA), accumulated process 
knowledge and experimental process characterization. Although some quality by design (QbD) 
elements have been utilized to develop the zanubrutinib manufacturing process, no design space is 
being claimed.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Discussion on impurities is in general adequate (specified and 
unspecified organic impurities, genotoxic impurities, and elemental impurities). The Applicant has 
provided a detailed overview of organic impurities with indication of origin and fate for each impurity. 
Control and carry-over of potential impurities from the starting materials to the final active substance 
have been discussed. Fate of impurities as well as intermediates through processing seems well 
understood and supported by purge studies. Solvents applied in synthesis of starting materials are 
controlled in the relevant starting material specification with limits according to EU/ICH Q3C.  The 
catalyst is used in the synthesis of one of the intermediates and was evaluated both in the concerned 
intermediate and in the AS; the catalyst is controlled in the active substance specification. 
The Applicant has satisfactorily accounted for changes in the process during development. Bridging 
between early and later synthetic processes has been satisfactorily ensured and the synthesis 
proposed is supported by data in the dossier. Considering all the presented information the proposed 
synthesis is acceptable. 
 The packaging material for the AS has been described and compliance of the primary packaging 
material with requirements of Regulation (EU) No 10/2011 on plastic materials and articles intended to 
come into contact with foods was presented.  
Specification 
The AS specification, includes appropriate tests and limits for appearance (visual), identification (HPLC, 
IR), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), chiral purity (chiral HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water 
content (KF), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), elemental impurities (ICP-MS), 
polymorphic form (XRPD) and particle size distribution (Ph. Eur.). 
The proposed specifications are considered acceptable. The limits for impurities are justified based on 
batch data, stability data and toxicology qualification results. All impurities were negative within in 
vitro mutagenicity evaluation. The limit of chiral purity is justified based on toxicology qualification, 
batch release data and stability data. The limits are based on current permitted daily exposure (PDE). 
The catalyst used in the synthesis is controlled in the active substance specification with an acceptable 
limit. Residual solvent limits are according to the ICH guidelines. Benzene was found below the 
detection limit of 0.25 ppm, which is less than 30% of the acceptable limit for benzene (2 ppm) in 7 
tested commercial-size batches of AS (unmilled). Therefore it is acceptable that benzene is not 
controlled in the AS but instead tested in the only solvent where it may be present. Due to the low risk 
of microbial contamination and the low water activity of zanubrutinib, microbial limits testing is not 
conducted; this is considered acceptable. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Zanubrutinib has been manufactured at three different manufacturing sites during development. The 
batch history consisting of 26 representative batches of zanubrutinib manufactured by all three 
manufacturers over a period of 5 years is presented. Nine of these batches are manufactured by the 
proposed manufacturing site and 7 were of commercial scale. 
All batches were produced using the proposed route of synthesis and can be considered representative 
for the proposed commercial manufacturing process. Data for the different batches show that there are 
no significant changes on impurity levels, assay or chiral purity, which means that the process 
optimization and up scaling had no impact on impurity levels. Level of impurities is stable and low in 
the commercial batches. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data has been provided for three commercial scale batches manufactured at the proposed 
manufacturing site. These stability batches were packaged in the proposed container closure system. 
Stability data were provided for up to 24 months stored under long term conditions (30°C / 65% RH) 
and for up to six months under accelerated conditions (40°C / 75% RH) according to the ICH 
guidelines.  
The parameters studied were appearance, assay, related substances, chiral purity, water content, loss 
on drying, polymorphic form and particle size distribution. No changes in product quality or trends 
have been observed for any of the evaluated parameters at any of the storage conditions.  
Supportive stability data were also presented on 15 batches of AS for up to 48 months at 30°C / 65% 
RH and 6 months at 40°C / 75% RH. These batches were used in various stages of development and 
manufactured at different scales (~ 10 kg to ~ 100 kg), by different manufacturers. The same 
manufacturing process has been used with minor differences as detailed and justified in manufacturing 
process development. The samples were tested using methods and acceptance criteria that were in 
place at the time of testing. The same acceptance criteria used on release were applied on stability. No 
changes in product quality or trends were observed for any of the evaluated parameters at any of the 
storage conditions. 
A photostability study was conducted as per ICH Q1B on two pilot batches; no changes were observed 
in any of the measured attributes. Zanubrutinib is stable under photolytic degradation conditions and it 
does not need to be protected from light. 
A forced degradation study was performed on a pilot batch. Samples were subjected to a variety of 
stress conditions including acid, base, oxidation, simulated sunlight, thermal and humidity. The results 
indicate that zanubrutinib is sensitive to acidic, alkaline and oxidative stress conditions, while it is 
stable with respect to heat, moisture and light. It was also confirmed that the method for related 
substance is stability-indicating. 
Based on the available stability data, the proposed retest period of 24 months without any specific 
storage restrictions when the active substance is stored in the proposed container closure system, is 
acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as white to off-white opaque hard capsules, printed with “ZANU 80” 
in black ink and containing white to off-white powder containing 80 mg of zanubrutinib as active 
substance. The capsules are size 0 and have a length of 22 mm. The qualitative composition of 
Brukinsa 80 mg capsules and of the printing ink are shown in section 2.2.1 of this report and in SmPC 
section 6.1. 
Formulation development  
The finished product is a conventional immediate release hard gelatin capsule for oral administration. 
The FP formulation for the 80 mg capsule was introduced in Phase 1 clinical trials and has remained 
unchanged throughout development. The choice of pharmaceutical form/ strength adequately 
addresses the proposed dosing regime, i.e. 320 mg zanubrutinib daily, taken either as four 80 mg 
capsules once daily or two 80 mg capsules twice daily. According to the applicant the feasibility of an 
optimised dosage form with higher strength and/or smaller size is currently under evaluation; this is 
acknowledged. 
The Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) of zanubrutinib capsules,80 mg, was developed in 
accordance with ICH Q8 guidance and is provided below.

profile 
Based on the QTPP, assay, related substances, content uniformity and dissolution were identified as 
Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) and their justification is provided.  
During development the following characteristics of the zanubrutinib active substance was considered: 
Zanubrutinib is a BCS Class 2 drug with poor aqueous solubility (high lipophilicity) and high 
permeability, it exhibits irregularly shaped, cohesive, crystalline particles with poor flow characteristics 
and a tendency to agglomerate, and it is anhydrous and relatively stable when exposed to humidity. 
The excipients were selected and evaluated in different grades and/or ranges. Medium to high risk 
formulation factors were investigated and mitigation strategies evaluated. Potential formulation risks 
were then reassessed. With the selected excipient grade, concentration, AS control, and process 
controls, all the risk levels specified have subsequently been deemed low. 
The chosen excipients are commonly used in immediate release hard capsules and are described in Ph. 
Eur. except the gelatin capsule shell, which consist of pharmacopeial ingredients. The selection of each 
excipient in the proposed level have been adequately discussed and justified.  
The dissolution method selected for QC testing is Apparatus I, Basket at 100 rpm with 900 ml of 
medium consisting of 0.1N HCl with 0.3% SLS. The development of the dissolution method proposed 
for QC testing is acceptable. The discriminatory properties of the method regarding particle size of the 
AS are demonstrated. Since it has been demonstrated that particle size is the only critical material 
attribute for zanubrutinib capsules and that the formulation and manufacturing process have wide 
ranges of operation the discriminative properties of the proposed dissolution method is considered 
sufficient. 
Manufacturing process development  
The proposed manufacturing process is a standard direct blending and encapsulation process. The AS 
physicochemical properties were taken into account in the selection of the finished product 
manufacturing process. A process risk assessment, in accordance with ICH Q9, was conducted to 
identify which variables and unit operations/steps could impact product quality. The process variables 
identified as medium or high risk from the initial risk assessment were evaluated in further studies. 
Appropriate control strategies were put in place to mitigate risks and ensure the commercial 
manufacturing process is capable of producing zanubrutinib capsules, 80 mg, per pre-defined 
specification. The development of the manufacturing process and establishment of the operation 
conditions have been adequately discussed considering the influence on CQAs. The operational ranges 
for the critical process parameters have been evaluated using principles of Quality by Design. However, 
no design spaces were claimed for the manufacturing process of the finished product. The same 
process of direct blending and encapsulation remained unchanged from clinical to the proposed 
commercial scale. 
Zanubrutinib 80 mg capsules used in clinical trials were manufactured by 5 different sites. A 
comparability assessment of finished product from these 5 manufacturing sites was conducted. Release 
data, blend uniformity and dissolution profiles were compared. In addition, stability data from the 
different sites are presented. The proposed commercial formulation and manufacturing process has 
remained unchanged from early development and has been used for all clinical trials and PK-studies. 
All results evaluated showed that the finished products manufactured by different sites are 
comparable. 
Container closure system 
The finished product will be packed in standard HDPE bottles with polypropylene (PP) child-resistant 
screw cap. The proposed packaging is found suitable for packaging of the finished product as it has 
been demonstrated to provided adequate protection, safety, integrity and compatibility. The suitability 
of the packaging has been confirmed through the stability studies. 
The proposed container closure system is common for this type of dosage form. Brukinsa capsules are 
packaged in 150 mL (60 ct) or in 200 mL (120 ct) white high-density polyethylene (HDPE) wide-mouth 
round bottle with a 38/400 polypropylene white child resistant screw cap with a heat-induction sealed 
liner. The inner cap and outer cap are comprised of the same resins and colorants, are commonly 
utilized in the pharmaceutical industry, and compliant with relevant indirect food additive regulations. 
The liner is comprised of various layers, including a PET film and heat seal; the liner is complaint with 
indirect food additive regulations. Both bottles are compliant the relevant Commission Regulation for 
material in contact with food The primary packaging materials also comply with Ph. Eur. requirements. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process is a standard direct blending and encapsulation process comprising eight 
main steps. The commercial batch size range has been clearly stated.  
 The critical steps for the manufacture of the finished product have been evaluated in DoE studies and 
are clearly defined. Appropriate ranges for the critical process parameters have been established and 
sufficient in-process controls are applied during the process. The overall control strategy including 
process parameters and in-process controls are adequately set to control the process leading to 
consistent quality. Hold time studies have been performed for the final blend and finished bulk 
capsules and respective hold time have been established.  
No design space for the manufacture of the finished product has been claimed. 
The manufacturing process has been validated using three batches in the proposed commercial scale. 
The validation confirmed the consistency of the manufacturing process. 
Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests and limits for 
appearance (visual), identification (HPLC, chiral-HPLC), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), dissolution 
(Ph. Eur., HPLC), content uniformity (Ph. Eur., HPLC), water content (KF), chiral purity (chiral-HPLC) 
and microbial limits (Ph. Eur.). 
The specification has been justified according to relevant EU/ICH Q6A. The parameters included in the 
finished product specification are acceptable and adequate justification for the parameters omitted 
from the specification is provided.  
No degradation products are found in the finished product. Two synthesis impurities can be carried 
forward from the active substance and are specified to the same limits in the finished product as in the 
active substance. An additional synthesis impurity was controlled in the finished product during the 
development, but is included as unspecified impurity for the control of the commercial product. The 
limit for impurities are justified and where needed toxicologically qualified by appropriate studies.  
The dissolution limit is justified based on batch analysis and stability testing of the clinical batches. 
Polymorphic form is not tested since there is only one crystalline form and no change of crystalline 
form has been observed in during formal stability studies. 
An elemental risk assessment has been conducted for zanubrutinib capsules based on principles of ICH 
Q3D. Elemental impurities including Cd, Pb, As, Hg, Co, V, Ni and Pd were considered in the risk 
assessment. The assessment examined potential sources of elemental impurities including 
manufacturing equipment, container closure system, water, AS, and excipients. The assessment on 
zanubrutinib capsules was conducted using both the component approach (Option 2b) and the FP 
approach. The outcomes of both approaches suggest that adequate controls are in place, as the 
potential elemental impurity levels were less than 30% of the PDE. Therefore, it is not necessary to 
control elemental impurities in zanubrutinib capsules at release. 
In response to a Major Objection (MO) raised by the CHMP, a risk evaluation concerning the potential 
presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product was submitted considering all suspected and 
actual root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for marketing authorisation 
holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on 
nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- 
Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human 
medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the information provided, no risk was identified 
and no additional control measures are deemed necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented.  
The finished product is released onto the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Batch analysis results are presented for 3 primary stability batches manufactured in the proposed 
commercial scale at the proposed manufacturing site. In addition, batch analysis of numerous clinical 
batches manufactured at 5 different manufacturing sites were presented. The results showed that the 
finished product meet the specifications proposed and confirmed batch-to-batch consistency. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches, stored for up to 24 months under long term 
conditions (25°C / 60% RH), for up to 24 months under intermediate conditions at 30°C /65% RH and 
for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40°C / 75% RH), according to the ICH guidelines, 
were provided. These primary stability batches were manufactured at the proposed manufacturing site 
and were packaged in the proposed commercial container closure system. 
Additional supportive stability studies have been carried out on clinical batches manufactured at the 
proposed commercial site and at 4 other sites. The total of 36 supportive stability batches were of the 
same formulation and manufacturing process as the commercial batches. The batches were packaged 
in HDPE bottles of various number of capsules and stored at 25°C / 60% RH for up to 36 months, at 
30°C /65% RH for up to 36 months and at 40°C / 75% RH for 6 months. 
Stability samples were tested for appearance, assay, impurities dissolution, water content, chiral 
purity, microbial limits and polymorphic form. No significant changes or trends were observed in any of 
the parameters tested. All results were well within the proposed specifications at all times and 
conditions. 
A photostability study has been carried out in accordance with the ICH Q1B guideline on one primary 
stability batch. The exposed and protected samples were examined for appearance, assay, impurities, 
water content, chiral purity and dissolution. No significant changes in any of the parameters were 
observed after exposure to light. The results were similar for the exposed and dark control samples, 
indicating that the finished product is not sensitive to light. 
Additional stress studies under high temperature (40°C and 60°C), high humidity (75% RH and 92.5% 
RH), and light exposure, have been carried out. At the high heat conditions the water content 
decreased, whereas at the high humidity conditions the water content increased. No other trends were 
observed under the stress conditions. The high-water content has been demonstrated not to affect 
other quality attributes of the FP. 
An open-dish study has been performed. Capsules were stored in open petri dishes at 25 °C /60% RH 
for 3 months. A slight increase in water content, still well within the specification limit was observed. 
No other trends were observed; therefore, an in-use shelf-life for zanubrutinib capsules is not 
necessary. 
Based on the overall available data, the proposed shelf life of 3 years without special storage 
conditions as stated in SmPC 6.3 and 6.4, is acceptable.  
Adventitious agents 
With the exception of the capsule shell, no animal or human derived raw materials are used in the 
manufacturing process of Brukinsa. The gelatin capsule shells are made with pharmaceutical grade 
gelatin obtained from bovine sources and are free of TSE/BSE. To this effect valid TSE CEP from the 
suppliers of the gelatine used in the manufacture were provided.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The MO in relation to the potential formation and presence of 
nitrosamines in the finished product has been resolved.  
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable and consistent. Physicochemical and 
biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated 
and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
None. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
All pivotal studies were conducted in accordance with current testing guidelines and in compliance with 
Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations issued by US FDA, OECD and CFDA. No deviations were 
noted to have any impact on the quality and integrity of those studies. As the test facility where the 
pivotal toxicity studies has been performed, has been part of an inspection programme of a GLP 
monitoring authority (the Belgian GLP Compliance monitoring Authority) the studies included in the 
present MAA, can be considered GLP compliant  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro Pharmacology 
BGB-3111 is a novel irreversible BTK inhibitor, designed to form a covalent bond with a cysteine 
residue at the BTK active site, leading to inactive BTK enzymatic activity in vitro. Upon BCR activation, 
BTK is initially trans-phosphorylated at Tyr-551 residue by Syk and Lyn kinases and physiologically 
activated by autophosphorylation at Tyr-223, then resulting in phosphorylation of phospholipase C 
gamma 2 (PLCγ2) and activation of transcription factors essential for B-cell proliferation and 
differentiation. These downstream reactions are then blocked by BGB-3111.  
Covalent binding of BGB-3111 to BTK was demonstrated in an assay with BGB-3111 in solution with 
excess BTK enzyme and subsequent protein precipitation (R01-BIOL-145). Full binding of BGB-3111 
was shown by precipitation with acetonitrile in which BGB-3111 is highly soluble. This method is 
referring to a publication by Copeland, 2000. 
Functional activity of BGB-3111 was evaluated in a panel of haematological cancer cell lines (R01-
BIOL-142). Among the 23 haematological cancer cell lines tested, BGB-3111 potently inhibited the cell 
proliferation.BGB-3111 inhibited BTK pY223 with an IC50 of 1.8 nM in a cellular assay. As an 
irreversible inhibitor, BGB-3111 formed covalent bond with a cysteine residue at BTK active site and 
occupied the protein. In the BTK occupation assay, BGB-3111 occupied intracellular BTK with an IC50 
of 2.2 nM. (R01-BIOL-141). Potency values for ibrutinib from study R01-BIOL-141,are similar to BGB-
3111.  
The lack of ex vivo studies on haematological lymphoma cells was justified by the applicant, as such 
specimens was not available commercially, and since the pharmacological effect in patients in the 
clinical trials is considered relevant, this issue will not be pursued further. 
It is commonly reported in the literature that for ibrutinib the presence of primary or acquired 
resistance mainly due to mutations in cysteine 481 binding site of BTK or its substrate CXCR4, but also 
by numerous other mechanisms is common and often leads to poor therapeutic outcome. To study 
resistant mechanisms ibrutinib-resistant cell lines have been established following long-term exposure 
to the substance. However, the applicant has not conducted any resistance studies in WM resistant and 
wild-type WM cells but studies are ongoing in other cancer cell lines including IMD-8 and Ramos. 
Results from these studies are expected to be published once available. 
 
Table 1 In Vitro Primary Pharmacology Studies 
In Vitro Biochemical Characterization 
Biochemical potency of BGB-3111 for inhibition of BTK enzyme activity was determined. BGB-3111 was 
confirmed to be a covalent/irreversible inhibitor of BTK via the following experiment (Copeland, 2000). 
BTK protein was pre-incubated with BGB-3111 or BGB-1903 (a reversible BTK inhibitor) to form 
BTK/compound complexes (with BTK enzyme in excess to ensure complete binding of compounds by 
BTK protein). The BTK protein was then denatured and precipitated by centrifugation. The 
supernatants were analyzed for quantity of the original compounds. BGB-1903 remained in the 
supernatant regardless of presence or absence of BTK protein during pre-incubation, consistent with 
the reversible nature of its BTK binding. In contrast, BGB-3111 completely disappeared from the 
supernatant after incubation with precipitated BTK protein. The data also showed that the covalent 
bond formation between BTK and BGB-3111was largely completed within 5 minutes (Study R01-BIOL-
145). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2 Residual BGB-3111 (A) and BGB-1903 (B) in the Supernatant after BTK was 
Denatured and Precipitated from BTK/Compound Complexes 
Western-blot analysis demonstrated that BGB-3111, after 2-hr incubation, dose-dependently inhibited 
BCR aggregation-triggered BTK autophosphorylation, and blocked downstream PLCγ2 signaling. BGB-
3111 had an IC50 of 1.8 ± 0.2 nM (n=3) in an HTRF based BTKpY223 assay. 
BGB-3111 can form a covalent bond with BTK on the Cys-481 residue, which blocks its kinase activity 
and keeps other molecules from forming covalent bonds in the same manner (Honigberg et al., 2010; 
Wu et al., 2014). In a study that measured occupancy of BTK by an irreversible probe, BGB-3111 
showed dose-dependent BTK occupancy in Z-138 cells. The IC50 of BGB-3111 in the occupancy assay 
was 2.2 ± 1.0 nM (n=3). 
To further evaluate antitumor activity and specificity of BGB-3111, the anti-proliferative IC50 of BGB-
3111 was determined in a panel of 23 hematologic cancer cell lines.

The anti-tumor activity of BGB-3111 was evaluated in female NOD/SCID mice. Daily oral 
administration of BGB-3111 for 20 days demonstrated dose-dependent anti-tumour activity in this 
model. Body weight was stable throughout the study. This study was supported by exposure 
measurement. Drug exposure (both Cmax and AUC0-8h) at steady state increased proportionally with the 
dose. At the comparable drug dose level, BGB-3111 (24.9 mg/kg, BID) induced better tumour growth 
inhibition than ibrutinib (48.9 mg/kg, QD), which correlates with higher drug exposure of BGB-3111 
compared to that of ibrutinib. At this dose, Cmax was approximately 6 µM corresponding to 2.8 mg/mL. 
At Cmax of 2 µM, the effect (survival at dose 7.4 mg/kg BID) was similar to ibrutinib. For comparison to 
relevant exposure in patients: At the highest recommended dose in patients, mean steady state Cmax is 
300 to 500 ng/mL (SmPC). A dedicated PKPD study is discussed below (R01-VIVO-121). 
In another study in the same animal model, this time with tail-vein injection of the tumour cells, 
similar dose-dependent survival was shown, (R01-VIVO-119). The dosing went on for 78 days, 
however between day 40 and day 50, animals began to deteriorate as observed from the decrease in 
body weight. Only the highest dose levels for BGB-3111 and ibrutinib appeared to differentiate 
somewhat from vehicle on this parameter at the end of study.  
The REC-1 systemic xenograft model was used for further evaluation of the in vivo anti-tumor activity 
of BGB-3111. Treatment with either ibrutinib (48.9 mg/kg qd or bid) or BGB-3111 (7.4 mg/kg bid or 
24.7 mg/kg bid) significantly prolonged animal survival compared to the vehicle group (P < 0.01). The 
median survival of the treatment group receiving BGB-3111 at 7.4 mg/kg bid was similar to that of the 
ibrutinib treatment group at 48.9 mg/kg qd, which is its clinically relevant dose. There was no benefit 
on animal survival when the ibrutinib dose was increased from 48.9 mg/kg qd to 48.9 mg/kg bid. BGB-
3111 at 24.7 mg/kg bid demonstrated significantly better efficacy than the other three treatment 
groups (P < 0.01). Initially, BGB-3111 and ibrutinib were both well-tolerated at the doses administered 
(data not shown). Most body weight loss at later study stage was caused by disease progression. 
However, around day 40, significant body weight loss was noted in several animals in the ibrutinib 48.9 
mg/kg bid group, which was considered to be potentially treatment related. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 2 Efficacy and PK Parameters of BGB-3111 and Ibrutinib in Human REC-1 Xenograft 
Model (R01-VIVO-118) 
In vivo efficacy of BGB-3111 and ibrutinib was also examined in TMD-8 DLBCL xenografts grown 
subcutaneously in NOD/SCID mice (R01-VIVO124). Following daily oral administration at well tolerated 
doses of 2.4, 7.2, 24.1 or 48.3 mg/kg bid, BGB-3111 induced dose-dependent anti-tumor effects. 
Ibrutinib at 48.9 mg/kg bid was more effective than ibrutinib at 48.9 mg/kg qd. BGB-3111 was more 
effective than ibrutinib in this model. 
Study R01-VIVO-121 was undertaken to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamics 
(PD) relationship of BGB-3111 and compare it with ibrutinib in ICR mice. BGB-3111 was quickly 
absorbed and eliminated in ICR mice. It achieved rapid BTK inhibition in both PBMC and spleen in a 
dose-dependent manner. Consistent with its irreversible nature, BGB-3111 induced BTK occupancy in 
both target organs was more sustained than its plasma drug levels with rebound appearing earlier in 
spleen than in PBMC. The increase in the unoccupied fraction of BTK protein at later time point is likely 
due to new BTK protein synthesis. These data suggested that BTK might have different protein 
synthesis rate in PBMC and spleen and its synthesis might be faster in spleen than in PBMC. BGB-3111 
was about 3-fold more potent than ibrutinib in mouse determined as % unoccupied BTK in PBMC and 
spleen versus dose. Exposure determination indicate that the difference in potency is due to higher 
bioavailability of BGB-3111 compared to ibrutinib. 
At a cellular level it was shown that, to achieve above 70% target inhibition in PBMC and spleen, 
plasma Cmax values greater than 0.11 and 0.32 μM for BGB-3111 are needed. These concentration 
values are considered clinically relevant (1 µM = 472 ng/mL, similar to clinical steady state Cmax). 
Active metabolite BGB-7941 
Three identified metabolites of BGB-3111 were evaluated for pharmacological activity. Only the mon-
oxygenated BGB-7941 was shown to have effect. BGB-7941 showed slightly weaker effect than BGB-
3111 also on functional endpoints (cell growth, R01-BIOL-155). This metabolite comprised of 
approximately 6% of BGB-3111 related radioactivity AUC in human plasma. Hence, is not considered 
to contribute significantly to the effects of BGB-3111. 
 
 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Biochemical selectivity 
BGB-3111 selectivity was evaluated on the majority of known human kinases (342 out of 481). Only a 
fraction of those have a cysteine in the binding pocket similar to BTK. These were evaluated more 
closely (R01-BIOL-147). BGB-3111 was more selective than ibrutinib for inhibition of BTK vs. EGFR, 
FGR, FRK, HER2, HER4, ITK, JAK3, LCK, and TEC. 
BGB-3111 was designed to bind covalently with cysteine 481 near the ATP binding site of BTK. Among 
491 kinases in the human kinome, only BTK and nine other kinases have the cysteine at this position, 
including ITK, TEC, JAK3, EGFR, HER2, BMX, TXK, HER4 and BLK (Singh et al., 2010). The irreversible 
mechanism of inhibition affords BGB-3111 selectivity against kinases that does not harbor the specific 
cysteine. Among the ten kinases that have the specific cysteine, selectivity could also be achieved 
through improved specific binding to BTK vs. the other nine kinases. 
Selectivity of BGB-3111 was profiled against a panel of 342 kinases at 1 µM at Reaction Biology Corp. 
BGB-3111 displayed less than 70% inhibition against 329 kinases, and greater than 70% inhibition 
against 12 kinases besides BTK. IC50 of BGB-3111 for these 13 kinases and other kinases that harbour 
the specific cysteine residue, were determined. BGB-3111 was more selective than ibrutinib for 
inhibition of BTK vs. EGFR, FGR, FRK, HER2, HER4, ITK, JAK3, LCK, and TEC. 
However, the difference from ibrutinib was marginal on ERBB4/HER4. BGB-3111 was similar to 
ibrutinib on BMX/ETK, BLK and TXK. The potential clinical implication of inhibition of ERBB4/HER4, 
BMX/ETK, BLK and TXK was discussed in light of the clinical experience with ibrutinib and BGB-3111 
(zanubrutinib) and observed adverse effects.  
The below figure shows the reaction curves of GSH with BGB-3111 and ibrutinib, respectively. The 
initial reaction rates were derived from the linear range of the reaction curves. The relative GSH 
reaction rate of BGB-3111 was 0.03 µM/min, about half of that of ibrutinib (0.07 µM/min).

Cellular selectivity 
BGB-3111 showed better selectivity over ITK and EGFR than ibrutinib in biochemical assays. The 
selectivity of BGB-3111 in ITK and EGFR inhibition was confirmed at the cellular level (Report No. R01-
BIOL-143). The investigator stated the following in the conclusion of this report: “Although BGB-3111 
showed some ITK and EGFR inhibitory activity, the potency is very low. We speculate that the cellular 
IC50s of BGB-3111 on ITK and EGFR are higher than its physiological reachable concentration. On the 
contrary, ibrutinib inhibited ITK and EGFR in physiological relevant concentration, which is consistent 
with its clinical observations.”  
IL2-inducible T-cell kinase (ITK), a member of the Tec family tyrosine kinases, is the predominant Tec 
kinase in T cells and natural killer (NK) cells mediating T cell receptor (TCR) and Fc receptor (Fc R) 
initiated signal transduction. ITK deficiency results in impaired T and NK cell functions. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 3 Summary of Cellular Selectivity 
Figure 6 Effect of BGB-3111 and Ibrutinib on Rituximab-Mediated IFN-γ Release 
Effects of these BTK inhibitors on rituximab-induced ADCC were further confirmed by cytotoxicity 
assays. Both ibrutinib and BGB-3111 induced dose-dependent inhibition of NK cell specific lysis of 
rituximab-coated Mino cells, but at different potency. The IC50 of ibrutinib (0.85 µM) was almost 30-
fold lower than that of BGB-3111 (25 µM). 
 
 
 
 
Figure 7 Effect of BGB-3111 and Ibrutinib on Rituximab-Mediated In Vitro Cytotoxicity 
In this context, the effect of BGB-3111 and ibrutinib on rituximab induced antibody-dependent cellular 
cytotoxicity (ADCC) was evaluated. Ibrutinib significantly inhibited rituximab-induced NK cell IFN-γ 
secretion and in vitro cytotoxicity of mantle cell lymphoma cells in a dose-dependent manner. In 
comparison, BGB-3111 was at least 10-fold weaker than ibrutinib in inhibiting rituximab induced ADCC, 
consistent with its weak ITK inhibition activity. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Table 4 Summary of Safety Pharmacology Studies 
 
 
 
 
Cardiovascular safety 
The effect of BGB-3111 on potassium ion channels was evaluated via hERG (human ether à go-go-
related gene) assay using manual patch-clamp technique, which is a cell-based assay using a CHO cell 
line expressing hERG channels stably. In the GLP-study (2017), IC50 for BGB-3111 was determined to 
be 9.11 µM and 50 nM for the positive control terfenadine. Based on this study, the risk of hERG 
inhibition is low considering the Cmax at steady state being approximately 1 µM. In an earlier non-GLP 
study (2014), IC50 was determined to be lower (1.9 µM). 
Cardiovascular safety was evaluated in vivo in the telemetry instrumented conscious dog after oral 
administration of single doses of BGB-3111 (0, 10, 30 or 100 mg/kg). No difference from vehicle were 
observed on endpoints of heart rate (from both the blood pressure and ECG waveforms), systemic 
blood pressure (systolic, diastolic, mean, and pulse pressures), or electrocardiograms (PR, RR, QRS, 
QT intervals, and QTc). 
The study was not supported by exposure determination. However, one case of vomiting in the high 
dose group, indicates exposure, since this finding was in correlation with the 28-days repeat-dose 
toxicity study. Moreover, formulation analysis was within specifications of ±15%. 
ECG tracings of a minimum 30 seconds duration were obtained from all dogs twice prior to each dose 
(at least 30 minutes apart) and at 6 post dose timepoints (1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours). These 
tracings were evaluated by a veterinary cardiologist for waveform abnormalities and arrhythmias.   
CNS 
Male and female (40/sex) rats were assigned to 4 groups with 10/sex/group and received vehicle 
(0.5% (w/v) methylcellulose in purified water), 30, 100, or 300 mg/kg of BGB-3111 in vehicle via oral 
gavage. FOB observations were conducted once at pre-test and then once each at approximately 0.5, 
2, and 24 hours post dose. No test article related changes were noted in the FOB test which included 
motor activity, behaviour changes, coordination, sensory/motor reflex responses and body 
temperature assessments. The study appeared to be GLP compliant with a comprehensive audit 
program. No difference from vehicle group was found in the FOB assay (180-0084-SP). 
Respiratory function 
BGB-3111 was administered once to Sprague Dawley rats by oral gavage to evaluate the effects of 
BGB-3111 on the respiratory system functions. A total of 40 male and female (20/sex) Sprague 
Dawley rats were assigned to 4 groups, with 5/sex/group. Each group received a single dose of 30, 
100, or 300 mg/kg of BGB-3111 or control vehicle (180-0085-SP). 
Animals preconditioned to restraint-tubes were placed in ‘head-out’ plethysmographs and allowed to 
acclimate to environmental conditions for at least 5 minutes prior to each data collection period. 
Immediately following the acclimation period, ventilatory parameters (tidal volume, respiratory rate, 
and derived minute volume) were measured for an approximate 15-minute period pre-dose, and then 
for approximate 15 minutes at 0.5 hours (±10 min), 2 hours (±10 min), and 24 hours post dose. 
The formulations of BGB-3111 were analysed at each dose level and found within specification. No 
mortality was noted during the study. No significant changes in the respiration rate, tidal volume, or 
derived minute volume were noted by the investigator at any dose levels at 0.5, 2, and 24 hours after 
dosing. This is supported. 
The core battery of safety pharmacology testing of BGB-3111 including CNS and respiratory function, 
as assessed in the rat at single doses up to 300 mg/kg, did not indicate any specific concern. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
 Methods of Analysis 
Bioanalysis for all toxicology studies were performed using a state-of-the-art LC-MS/MS method. The 
method was validated in compliance with GLP for the three matrices of rat, dog and rabbit as 
documented in the submitted validation reports. The sample preparation technique appeared simple 
and robust by using protein precipitation and subsequent dilution in mobile phase. For some reason, 
the internal standard was verapamil and not as usual a stable label form of the analyte, e.g. 13C. 
Nevertheless, it appeared to provide sufficient robustness of the method as run summaries in the 
validation reports also show. In some studies, stability under room temperature had to be re-assayed 
(rabbit and rat including the metabolite).  The dynamic range was suitable (5-5000 ng/mL) and 
extended by including dilution QCs. Stability under storage was documented for approximately 3 
months for each species. Incurred sample reproducibility was excellent for the three matrices of BGB-
3111 alone, however, more on the limit when the method also included the metabolite BGB-7941, 
although still within acceptance criteria. For most toxicity studies, the same version of the bioanalytical 
method was used in the validation and the study (V2.0), however in the case of the rabbit study 180-
0167-TX, there was a discrepancy as version 1 of the method was validated and version 2 of the 
method was used in rabbit study. The difference was due to an update of stability data summary; 
hence this discrepancy is acceptable.  
In conclusion, the bioanalytical testing program is considered appropriate for documenting exposure in 
the pivotal GLP repeat-dose toxicity studies and providing data for toxicokinetic reporting. 
Absorption 
BGB-3111 is a highly permeable compound without P-gp inhibition potential, in the Caco-2 cell system. 
BGB-3111 might have marginal efflux potential at low concentrations but not at high concentrations. 
(Study 3D-rn016116). 
Pharmacokinetics of BGB-3111 were determined after multiple oral dosing once daily for seven days 
for rats at 30 mg/kg and dogs at 7.5 mg/kg (Report No. 3D_RN016119 and 3D_RN016120). There was 
no significant difference in AUC0-inf of the 7th dose over the 1st dose in both rats and dogs, suggesting 
no accumulation of BGB-3111 following multiple oral dosing in both rats and dogs. After single dose, 
bioavailability appeared similar even though doses increased 10-fold (from 10 to 100 mg/kg in the rat 
and from 2.5 to 25 mg/kg in the dog), hence BGB-3111 show linear pharmacokinetics.  
After intravenous administration to rat and dog at 3 and 2 mg/kg, respectively, clearance was 43 to 61 
mL/kg/min in rat and 23-24 mL/kg/min in the dog roughly adhering to allometric scaling based on 
body surface area. Volume of distribution was similar in the two species (1.4 to 2 L/kg) indicating 
some distribution to tissues. 
Female rats showed higher exposure than males. This was evident from bioavailability and AUC at all 
three doses (10, 30 or 100 mg/kg), but not clearly on half-life and clearance. Bioavailability ranged 
from 9 to 20% in male rats and 31 to 41% in female rats. 
Time for maximal plasma concentration was 0.5 to 1 hour after oral administration. Half-life was in the 
range of approximately 0.5 hours after intravenous administration and 1.2 to 2.6 hours after oral 
administration, indicating absorption rate limited elimination in the rat. 
In dog, there were no sex-differences in the pharmacokinetics of BGB-3111. Bioavailability was 45 to 
50 % across the dose range of 2.5 to 25 mg/kg. Time for maximal plasma concentration was around 
0.5 hour after oral administration. Half-life was in the range of approximately 1 hour after intravenous 
administration and 1.4 to 3.9 hours after oral administration, indicating absorption rate limited 
elimination also in the dog. 
However, a study of the pharmacokinetics of 14C-BGB-3111 in rat showed that t1/2 values were 31.6 -
34.8 hours in blood and 7.75 -10.5 hours in plasma, indicating slower elimination of BGB-3111 related 
radioactivity in blood than in plasma (RTC00782). This may correlate to concentration dependent 
preference of BGB-3111 for red blood cells in the rat. A similar evaluation was performed in humans 
(BGB-3111-105 CSR). This study showed similar half-life of BGB-3111 related radioactivity in plasma 
and blood (44.4 hours in blood and 46.7 hours in plasma). 
Distribution 
The plasma protein binding (PPB) properties of BGB-3111 were evaluated in plasma from human, 
Cynomolgus monkey, Beagle dog, Sprague-Dawley rat, and ICR mouse, using an equilibrium dialysis 
method at drug concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 15 μM (3D_RN016124). The PPB of BGB-3111 
appeared to be concentration-independent in all 5 species tested. The mean bound fractions of BGB-
3111 were similar among species with 94.2%, 93.9%, 93.3%, 96.7%, and 94.9% in human, monkey, 
dog, rat, and mouse plasma, respectively. 
The blood-to-plasma concentration ratios of BGB-3111 were investigated in blood from human, Beagle 
dog, and Sprague Dawley rat (3D_RN016123). The mean blood-to-plasma concentration ratios of BGB-
3111 were 0.804 and 0.752 in humans and dogs, respectively, suggesting that BGB-3111 has a 
partitioning preference for plasma in the whole blood of humans and dogs at 0.3-30 μM. In rats, the 
blood-to-plasma concentration ratios of BGB-3111 was 0.766, 1.03, and 1.39 at 0.3, 3, and 30 μM, 
respectively, suggesting a concentration-dependent red blood cells/plasma partition preference in rats, 
which change to a preference for red blood cells at higher concentrations in the rat. Since this was only 
observed in rat, this is probably not of clinical relevance, however may correlate to the long half-life of 
BGB-3111 related radioactivity in whole blood as opposed to plasma in the rat study (RTC00782). 
Tissue distribution of BGB-3111 was determined in the rat after an oral dose of 30 mg/kg non-labelled 
material to rats (3D-RN016121). Tissue concentration was determined after 0.25, 2 or 8 hours post 
dose in selected organs. BGB-3111 showed preference for stomach, small intestine and liver. Very low 
concentration was found in brain and testes, however elimination from testes appeared to be slower 
than for other tissues. Other tissues than GI tract and liver showed slightly higher concentration than 
plasma at 0.25 and 2 hours after dosing, namely heart, kidney and ovary. 
A conventional QWBA study was conducted using 10 male Long-Evans rats and 3 Sprague Dawley rats 
in order to compare potential melanin binding (RPT04060). There was no difference in binding to 
melanin containing tissues between the two rat strains. Quite a busy sampling schedule (0.5, 2, 4, 8, 
24, 48, 72, 168, and 336 hours post-dose) was used. This allowed for PK parameters for all analysed 
tissues to be calculated. As observed in a previous study, t½ of BGB-3111 related radioactivity in blood 
was much longer than in plasma (69 vs. 8 hours). This should be compared to the half-life of BGB-
3111 in the rat of 1-2 hours. In the adrenal gland, cortex and medulla, a similarly long t½ correlated 
with high tissue to plasma ratios (21 to 24 times higher AUC in adrenal compared to plasma). Half-life 
was also similar to blood in bone marrow, spleen, pituitary gland, stomach wall and lung. However, the 
tissue:plasma ratios indicated similar overall exposure (AUC) as in plasma. Tissues showing high tissue 
to plasma exposure ratios despite shorter t½ was small intestine wall (t½ 6.4 h) and liver (t½ 37.2 h). 
These two tissues showed the highest tissue to plasma exposure ratios of 47 and 26, respectively. The 
majority of these tissues are associated with very common adverse effects (Table 3 in SmPC), such as 
neutropenia, anaemia, upper respiratory tract infections, cough and diarrhoea. 
 
Metabolism 
In vitro metabolism 
Interspecies comparison of in vitro metabolism in liver microsomes showed a moderate to high 
turnover with the lowest clearance in dog liver microsomes. 
BGB-3111 was extensively metabolised with a total of 11 metabolites (M1 to M11, the corresponding 
ID of in vivo metabolites are shown in Table 4) were found. Of these, 10 metabolites, were found in 
human and monkey liver microsomes, while 8 metabolites in dog liver microsomes, and 9 metabolites 
were found in rat and mouse liver microsomes with considerable overlap in identity. BGB-3111 was 
metabolised by oxidative deamination, hydroxylation, N-dealkylation and dehydration in liver 
microsomes. De-acrylated metabolites were not identified in vitro. 
Metabolites in plasma of human and rat 
Acrylic acid was identified as the major component in plasma in humans in the human AME study. This 
metabolite was not identified in the non-clinical species, hence cannot be considered qualified by 
exposure. A considerable effort was made in order to assess the impact of this potential safety issue in 
patients. The presence of acrylic acid in plasma of the healthy volunteers in the human AME study 
could partly be due to acrylic acid being present in the administered 14C-BGB-3111 in amounts above 
7%, as confirmed in a radiochromatogram of the dosing material. Acrylic acid was stated to account for 
a maximum of 2.83% of the dose based on the radioactivity of two unknown metabolites in urine in 
the human AME study. On this basis, applicant presented the following safety assessment: Following 
320 mg daily dose to human, only approximately 9 mg of BGB-3111 (MW=471) was hydrolyzed and 
converted to 1.38 mg of acrylic acid (MW=72) in the body, corresponding to ~0.02 mg/kg/day for a 60 
kg human. This is significantly less than the NOAEL (53 mg/kg/day) for systemic and developmental 
toxicity in rats (Hellwig et al. 1997). This is in principle agreed. However, since the exposure in 
circulation was so much higher than parent compound, the safety assessment of acrylic acid as a 
human metabolite with no documented non-clinical exposure was not considered convincing. In the 
next round of assessment, the applicant further clarified the positive safety assessment of acrylic acid 
as a metabolite in human plasma by mainly referring to the fact that acrylic acid was present in the 
dosing material of BGB-3111 in the human AME study (radio-chromatogram submitted) and not in the 
ADME study in rat. Moreover, deacrylated metabolites were present in both rat, dog and human in very 
low amounts indicating very low amounts of acrylic acid would be produced. Hence, the importance of 
this clearance pathway is minimal. The request for bioanalytical comparison of presence of acrylic acid 
in plasma from rat, dog and human cannot be carried out, since non-radiolabelled acrylic acid is not 
detectable using either LC-MS or LC-UV, not even after derivatisation.  
After a single dose of 14C-BGB-3111 to rat, parent compound was the major circulating component 
(45-65%) with BGB-7941 (M487a, hydroxylated phenyl) being the major metabolite (14%). BGB-7941 
is pharmacologically active and is also present in human plasma although at lower percentage of total 
radioactivity in plasma (5.73%). It was stated that no acrylic acid related peaks were identified in rat 
plasma or dosing material (XBLC14646N_RTC00568). However, de-acrylated BGB-3111 (M417/1) was 
identified after 30 mg/kg dose in rat and dog toxicology studies (RTC01128), indicating the formation 
of de-acrylated metabolites and acrylic acid via acrylamide hydrolysis pathways in these species. De-
acrylated metabolites would not be detected in the human and rat AME studies, since this is the site of 
labelling in both studies. The study report on study XBLC14646N_RTC00568 was located in the next 
round of assessment and a radio-chromatogram was found in Appendix A confirming the high purity of 
the dosing material used in the rat ADME study. 
Based on metabolite identification in the human AME study, it is considered unlikely that all BGB-3111 
will degraded to acrylic acid. However, to put the issue into perspective the following calculation is 
made: 
Worst case scenario: In case all BGB-3111 will degraded to acrylic acid. NOAEL of acrylic acid in rat = 
53 mg/kg/day (Hellwig, 1997). Human equivalent dose (HED) of NOAEL of acrylic acid = 0.16*53 
mg/kg/day = 8.48 mg/kg/day. Maximum daily dose is 320 mg/day/50 kg = 6.4 mg/kg/day BGB-3111 
corresponding to (72 g/mol for acrylic acid/471 g/mol for BGB-3111)*6.4 = 1 mg acrylic acid/kg/day. 
This dose is almost an order of magnitude lower than the HED of the NOAEL in the rat and the 
potential exposure to acrylic acid may be considered safe. The reactivity of acrylic acid (Michael 
addition) is low at pH 7.4 as outlined by Frederick et al, 1989. However, it should be kept in mind that 
the mechanism of action is by irreversible covalent binding to a protein. 
In this context, it should also be mentioned that in study RTC01116, it was found that some 14C-
containing material, accounting for 24.99% and 21.73% of the TRA in 0-24-h male and female rat 
plasma samples could not be extracted and remained in the plasma post-extraction pellets, possibly 
due to covalent binding to plasma proteins. Since the mechanism of action is irreversible inhibition of 
Bruton’s kinase by covalent binding, very high selectivity is warranted. However, the applicant 
elaborated that, the selectivity of zanubrutinib is lower in rat as compared to human, since the 
covalent-bound radioactivity was high in rat plasma (22-25%) and lower in human plasma (5.5 to 
6%). Comparing with ibrutinib, covalent binding in human plasma is much lower for zanubrutinib (38-
51% vs 5.5 to 6%) indicating higher selectivity of zanubrutinib versus ibrutinib, which is reassuring. 
Metabolites in excreta 
In both human and rat, faeces was by far the major route of excretion of BGB-3111 related 
radioactivity with 86% in humans and 94-97% in rat. In humans, parent compound comprised of 38% 
of the radioactive dose. The hydroxylated metabolite of phenyl, BGB-7941 (M487a) was the primary 
metabolite in faeces, representing 37.12% of the dose in male rat faecal samples, and 41.20% of the 
dose in female rat faecal samples, whereas BGB-3111 comprised of 6% in the rat faeces. In humans, 
urine comprised 7.4% of the dose with Unknown 1 and 2 identified as acrylic acid and being the most 
abundant metabolites (0.78 and 1.95%, respectively). Parent compound was found in 0.11% of the 
radioactive dose. Many metabolites were identified in both urine and faecal samples from rat and 
humans and reflected the Phase 1 metabolites identified in vitro supplemented secondary metabolites 
and a range of Phase 2 conjugates as such cysteine, N-acetylcysteine, glucuronic acid and sulphate. 
CYP and UGT Phenotyping 
BGB-3111 was found to be primarily metabolised by CYP3A4 (3D_RN016193). In humans, UGT plays a 
minor role in the clearance of BGB-3111 in vivo. In vitro, no conjugation to glucuronic acid could be 
detected (3D_RN016192). 
Excretion 
The majority of BGB-3111 related radioactivity was excreted with faeces in both rat and human with 
96% in the rat and 87 % in human. Very little was excreted in urine with 2% in rat and 7.6% in 
human. In the bile-duct cannulated rat, bile accounted for 40% of the excreted radioactive dose. In 
both rat and human, BGB-3111 comprised very small amounts of the radioactivity in urine, bile or 
faeces, hence the major clearance pathway for BGB-3111 is via metabolism. From this, it can also be 
concluded that BGB-3111 is well absorbed. Excretion was also evaluated in the rat after multiple 
dosing. No remarkable difference to single dose was observed. Excretion and in vivo metabolism were 
 
 
not studied in the non-rodent nonclinical species; the dog. The omission of conducting ADME study of 
BGB-3111 in dog was justified in the next round of assessment by the following points: i) In vitro 
metabolic profiles (liver microsomes) were similar between rat, dog and humans. ii) The majority of 
BGB-3111 related radioactivity was excreted through feces in both rat and human. iii) Similar pattern 
of low amounts of de-acrylated metabolites was found in both rat, dog and human plasma.  iiii) 
Sufficient safety margins to human exposure were obtained from non-clinical safety studies. The 
justification was accepted and requesting a new in vivo ADME study in a non-rodent at this stage of 
development is not considered necessary. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
BGB-3111 as a substrate of CYPs 
BGB-3111 is a substrate of CYP3A4. This was shown by profiling against 7 major CYP450 isoforms 
using human liver microsomes and recombinant CYPs (3D_RN016193) and further confirmed in vivo in 
a clinical study (BGB-3111-104 CSR) that showed a 3.8-fold increase in AUC0-inf of BGB-3111 when co-
administered with a strong CYP3A inhibitor (itraconazole), and a 13.5-fold decrease in AUC0-inf when 
co-administered with multiple-dose of a strong CYP3A inducer (rifampin). This is adequately described 
in SmPC section 4.5. 
BGB-3111 as an inducer of CYPs 
BGB-3111 appears to be a pan CYP-inducer as shown in experiments of human hepatocytes (3D-
RN016127 and C19047) at 0.3, 3 and 30 µM. Fold induction of enzyme activity and mRNA was 
generally highest at 3 µM, which may be considered highly clinically relevant as Cmax is approximately 
0.6 µM (299 ng/mL) and the concentration in the liver can be expected to be considerably higher. Only 
CYP2B6 is mentioned in this context in SmPC. This issue is discussed under Clinical Pharmacology OCs. 
BGB-3111 as an inhibitor of CYPs 
In an in vitro CYP inhibition study (3D-RN016125), IC50 values was determined for BGB-3111 on 6 
major CYPs. IC50 was >50 µM on CYP1A2, 2B6, 2D6 and 3A4 using testosterone as substrate. 
Potentially clinically relevant IC50s were observed for 2C8 (4.03 µM), 2C9 (5.69 µM) and 3A4 using 
midazolam as substrate (14.3 µM). Using FDAs guidance, only CYP2C8 fell out as potentially clinically 
relevant in terms of inhibition of CYPs in the liver and both substrates of CYP3A4 when taking intestinal 
CYP3A4 into consideration. Inhibition potential by BGB-3111 of CYP3A, 2C8, 2C9 and 2C19 was 
followed up by clinical in vivo drug-drug interaction studies or in the case of CYP2C8 by PBPK 
modelling. The outcomes are described in SmPC, however the impact of BGB-3111 was only modest. 
BGB-3111 as a Substrate of Transporters 
BGB-3111 was not a substrate of BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, OAT1, and OAT3 (RD-S1503-02-
02 and RD-S1503-02-04). In vitro data indicate that BGB-3111 was likely to be a substrate of human 
P-gp efflux transporter (3D-RN016116 and BGB-3111-DMPK-PK-DDI-0001). However, since BGB-3111 
is well absorbed with high permeability in humans, this is not considered of clinical relevance. 
BGB-3111 as an Inhibitor of Transporters 
BGB-3111 was neither an inhibitor of P-gp at concentrations up to 10.0 μM (3D_RN016116) nor an 
inhibitor of BCRP or hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or renal uptake transporters 
OCT2, OAT1, and OAT3 at concentrations up to 5.0 μM. 
Due to predicted high concentrations in the GI associated with p.o. administration, potential inhibition 
of BCRP and P-gp could not be outruled by the in vitro study. 
This was followed up by a clinical drug drug interaction study with digoxin as a P-gp substrate and 
rosuvastatin as BCRP substrate. However, only marginal increase in digoxin exposure was observed 
and no difference with rosuvastatin as also described in SmPC section 4.5. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Single dose studies were conducted in rats and dogs with doses up to 1000 mg/kg. The dog study was 
conducted with escalating doses of 100, 300 and 1000 mg/kg administered with four days apart in the 
same animals.   
No mortalities were observed in any of the studies. In both studies the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) 
was determined to be ≥ 1000 mg/kg/day. 
In the 14-day toxicity study in rats, measured concentrations of zanubrutinib drug substance in dose 
formulations were between 62.5% and 100.5% of nominal concentrations. For example, at nominal 
concentration 25 mg/mL the analysed concentration was only 15.625 mg/mL. The applicant was 
therefore asked to explain the reason for such a variability in concentrations of dose formulations, and 
its impact on the study results including TK. However, the applicant was not able to provide a 
consistent explanation for the variation in measured concentrations of zanubrutinib in dose 
formulation. Regardless, since there was no impact on the GLP toxicology studies, in which data 
consistency in toxicity and TKL profiles was shown, the issue will not be further pursued. 
Beside a shortened APTT in both male and female rats receiving 1000 mg/kg, no significant changes 
were observed in the single-dose rat study (18-0062-TX).    
In the single dose toxicity study in Beagle dogs (180-0063-TX) vomitus was observed post dosing in 
one female at 100 mg/kg and two males at 1000 mg/kg. As BGB-3111 was administered by oral route, 
vomiting could potentially affect the dose of BGB-3111 received by the dogs. Since no toxicokinetic 
data was presented and no registration of the time of vomiting post dosing could be found, it was 
unclear if vomiting potentially could have affected the dose of BGB-3111 received by the dogs and 
hence the reliability of the data in these dogs. 
Beside an increase in WBC and neutrophils in one female dog at 100 mg/kg and in fibrinogen in a male 
dog at 1000 mg/kg, no other changes were observed. The potential reasons for the increases are not 
sufficiently discussed by the applicant but they are not considered to be of great importance for the 
interpretation of the study.  
Repeat-dose toxicity 
Two non-GLP 14-days explorative dose studies were conducted in rats and dogs prior to initiation of 
the pivotal studies. Pivotal repeat dose studies of 28-days and 13-weeks in rat and dog as well as a 6-
months study in rats and a 9-months study in dogs, were conducted in accordance with relevant ICH 
guidelines. 
Rats 
Three pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies were conducted in Sprague Dawley rats with zanubrutinib 
administration for respectively 28 days with doses of 50, 150 and 500 mg/kg/day, 13 weeks with 
doses of 30, 100 and 300 mg/kg/day and 6 months with doses of 30, 100, 300 and 1000 mg/kg/day. 
In all studies zanubrutinib was administered orally by gavage, which corresponded to the intended 
clinical route of administration in human patients. Toxicokinetic evaluation were conducted for all the 
pivotal repeat-dose studies at all dose levels.     
Zanubrutinib-related mortality was observed at repeated doses of 1000 mg/kg/day by Day 6-9 as part 
of the 6-month study. Systemic exposures at this dose level corresponded to 62-71 times the clinically 
relevant exposure. Due to the high mortality (16 out of 20 animals), the remaining animals of the 
1000 mg/kg/day treatment group was terminated at Day 8-9. Mortality was likely caused by the 
severe gastrointestinal lesions of erosion/necrosis/ulceration, atrophy and neutrophilic infiltration. No 
test article-related mortality was noted at dose up to 500 mg/kg/day in the 28-day study and at 300 
mg/kg/day in the 13-week and 26-week studies.   
In the 28-day repeat-dose study, clinical observations included scab/swelling around nose/mouth/lip/ 
eyes from doses of 50 mg/kg/day in females (5 times clinical exposure), and salivation, soft stool and 
decrease in body weight (males only) at high doses of 500 mg/kg/day. Changes in hematological 
parameters were observed as increases in WBCs, NEUTs and RETs and decreases in RBCs, HGB and 
HCT. Additionally, abnormal changes in urine analysis were noted at 500 mg/kg/day in both sexes. 
None of the changes persisted after the recovery period. Histopathological changes were detected in 
the pancreas, skin, spleen, prostate, liver, ovary, uterus, adrenal glands and thymus. Although some 
microscopic changes persisted in the pancreas and spleen, most of the findings were reversible during 
the recovery phase. 
Findings in the 13-week and 26-week repeat-dose studies were to a large degree consistent with the 
findings of the 28-day study with a few exceptions. Clinical observations of a time-dependent decrease 
in body weight were noted at all doses in the 26-week study. Findings of scab/swelling around 
nose/mouth/lip/eyes were also seen in the 13-week study, again with lesion debuting at lower dose in 
females (30 mg/kg/day, 3 times clinical exposure) than in males (300 mg/kg/day, 19 times clinical 
exposure).    
Changes were seen in hematology (increases of WBC, NEUT, MONO, EOS), serum chemistry 
(increasing ALT, A/G and TCHO and decreasing TP, GLB, K and CK) and urinanalysis parameters (urine 
glucose, occult blood, urobilinogen, and higher incidence of turbid urine) in both the 13-week and 26-
week study. Even though, the increases/decreases often were small in magnitude, many of them were 
significantly changed compared to the control but most of them still within historical reference data. 
Lymphocyte immunophenotyping was conducted in both the 13-week study and the 26-week study, 
revealing increases in T-cells and T-helper cell and decreasing B-cells, which was considered to be 
within the expected pharmacological effect of zanubrutinib. 
Test article-related statistically significant absolute and relative organ weight alterations occurred at 
300 mg/kg/day in the 13-week repeated-dose study in rats, including increased adrenal gland weights 
for males and females, and increased heart, liver, kidney, spleen and thymus weights for females. 
However, no correlating histopathologic findings were noted in these organs with the exception that 
hypertrophy or cortical angiectasis in the adrenal glands and follicular cell hypertrophy in the thyroid 
glands. 
Pancreatic lesion was noted, primarily in male rats, as a consistent finding at all dose levels in all three 
studies. Lesion furthermore persisted after recovery although the frequency and severity of the lesions 
were reduced over time. This reflected an increased toxic effect of zanubrutinib on pancreas of rats, 
which according to the applicant did not correspond to the clinical findings. In an article by Bhaskaran 
et al. (2018), the effect of BTK-inhibitors on pancreas was shown to be species specific in rats with 
higher sensitivity in Sprague Dawley rats compared to other strains and the lack of clinical relevance of 
these findings are therefore acceptable. 
NOAELs were determined as 300 mg/kg/day, corresponding to the highest dose tested without 
mortally in all three rat studies. The NOAEL of 300 mg/kg/day in rats are, however, not accepted. For 
the rat studies, a NOAEL of 100 mg/kg/day is considered appropriate. 
Dogs 
Three pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies were conducted in Beagle dogs for 28 days, 13 weeks and 9 
months respectively with doses of 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg/day. Additionally, a non-GLP 14-day 
explorative study were conducted in dogs prior to the pivotal studies. Zanubrutinib was administered 
orally in all the studies, which corresponded to the intended clinical route in human patients. 
Toxicokinetic evaluation were conducted for all the pivotal repeat-dose studies at all dose levels.  
In the 28-day and 13-week repeat-dose studies similar findings were detected. Evidence of an adverse 
gastrointestinal effect was noted, as incidences of diarrhoea (soft/watery/mucoid stool) occurring 
already at low doses ≥ 10 mg/kg/day in both studies (2 times clinical exposure). Since gastrointestinal 
(GI) disturbances and diarrhoea appeared to be a consistent finding in many of the repeat-dose studies 
in both rats and dogs, the applicant was asked to discuss the potential mechanisms behind the GI 
findings and compare the occurrence of GI related changes in the rats and dogs with respect to safety 
margins to human exposure and clinical relevance. In the next round of assessment, the applicant 
sufficiently addressed the occurrence of GI disturbances in rats and dogs and provided exposure 
margins to human clinical exposure as requested. The GI changes was considered to be clinically 
relevant and comparable to reported clinical symptoms of diarrhea, constipation, nausea, vomiting and 
abdominal pain in human patients. The effect on the GI tract is potentially related to inhibition of EGFR 
in the intestine. The findings were transient in rats at 300 mg/kg/day but more pronounced in dogs, 
with a change into watery/mucoid diarrhoea in 50% of the male dogs at doses of ≥10 mg/kg/day and 
in 100% of the female dogs at high doses of 100 mg/kg/day.  
Vomiting was seen in the dogs at high dose of 100 mg/kg/day in the 28-day study. In the 13-week 
study, a dose-dependent decrease in body weight was noted in male dogs already at dose ≥ 10 
mg/kg/day with the highest decrease of 7,4%. Pathological lesions were limited to lymphoid depletion 
in the spleen in the 28-day study and in the spleen and lymph nodes in the 13-week study. Changes in 
an increasing number of clinical pathological parameters were noted in the 13-week study compared to 
the 28-day study with some of the changes being consistent between the studies (e.g. fibrinogen).     
In general, an increasing incidence and severity of findings were seen in the 9-month long-term 
repeat-dose study compared to the two other repeat-dose studies in dogs. As for the other pivotal 
studies, evidence of gastrointestinal disturbances was seen as diarrhoea in all animals at all doses ≥ 
10 mg/kg/day (2 times clinical exposure) along with a dose-dependent decrease in body weight in both 
males (8.6-18%) and females (7.8-10.9%). Additionally, salivation was observed at low doses.   
Clinical signs of skin lesion (scab, skin discoloration, swelling, rash and thickening) appeared at ≥ 10 
mg/kg/day (2 times clinical exposure). Oddly enough, the changes are not registered at 
macroscopically examination and not microscopically examined. Since skin lesion also occurred in the 
28-day and 13-week repeat-dose studies in rats, the applicant was asked to discuss the underlying 
reason for the changes further, compare the lesion between the studies and discuss the clinical 
relevance according to safety margins and lesions detected in human patients. In response to the 
question, the applicant provided a sufficient discussion of the clinical and non-clinical presentation of 
skin changes with estimation of exposure margins to human systemic exposure for the different doses 
as requested. It is agreed that the skin changes are of clinical relevance, potential caused by inhibition 
of EGFR in the skin and occur at doses of 300 mg/kg/day in rat and 10 mg/kg/day in dogs.        
Changes were observed in clinical pathological parameter (haematology, clinical chemistry and 
urinanalysis) with a tendency of a dose-dependent increase in magnitude and number of changed 
parameters over time. Moreover, some parameters even increased/decreased consistently between 
species (ex. WBC, NEUT etc.). In the next round of assessment, the applicant provided tables 
summarising and better visualizing changes in haematological parameters, leukocytes and serum 
chemistry in the conducted rat and dog studies. Historical reference range were furthermore included 
in the tables. According to the applicant, changes in hematological parameters were considered related 
to BTK inhibition, since BTK is not solely restricted to B cells. This could be a plausible explanation for 
the observed changes in hematological parameters (i.e. RBC, HGB, HCT and RET). However, increasing 
levels of neutrophils and related increases in WBC, cannot be explained by BTK inhibition, as this 
supposedly should lead to decreasing neutrophil values. The dose-dependent increase in neutrophils 
across species appeared to be caused by inflammatory cell infiltration in e.g. skin, gastrointestinal 
tract, and/or pancreas. However, the relevance was considered to be limited, as the finding differed 
from the clinical setting, where neutropenia was observed to a larger degree. 
In dogs, a significant dose-dependent increase in fibrinogen levels were seen compare to control 
animals at doses ≥ 30 mg/kg/day. It is acknowledged that the increase is within the historical control 
range, however, the finding is still considered potential clinically relevant, as it could be an initial 
indication of haemorrhages. For the serum chemistry parameters, electrolytes and the occurrence of 
proteinuria and/or occult blood in rats, most of the data were within the historical normal range, 
except for a decrease or increase in parameters at the highest dose levels in rats (300 or 500 
mg/kg/day) and/or dogs (100 mg/kg/day). Since no strong correlation were seen with 
histopathological changes in e.g. liver or kidney, the clinical relevance of the findings are unknown. 
However, in the light of NOAEL determination, this further substantiates the need for redefining the 
NOAELs.  
Lymphoid depletion observed at all three dog studies were suspected to be within the expected 
pharmacological effect.      
Generally, mortality was low in all three repeat-dose studies in dog. However, one unscheduled 
mortality was observed in a male dog in the 100 mg/kg/day treatment group in the 9-month repeat-
dose study. The animal died due to torsion of the jejunum. The applicant stated that the dead was not 
treatment related, however, this is not endorsed by the assessor. High incidences of diarrhea were a 
general clinical sign in all animals at all dose levels in the 9-month dog study and occurrence of 
irritating condition in the gastrointestinal system, as evidenced by diarrhea in this case, often leads to 
changes in intestinal motility which could be associated with torsion of the intestines. It can therefore 
not be excluded, that the observed mortality could be treatment-related.  
The NOAEL were in all three repeat-dose studies in dog determined to 100 mg/kg/day corresponding 
to the highest dose tested. The NOAEL of 100 mg/kg/day in dogs are not endorsed based on the 
following. Clinically relevant GI changes with a switch to more watery/mucoid diarrhoea were seen in a 
high percentage of male and female dogs at doses of 100 mg/kg/day and in males ≥10 mg/kg/day. 
Among other changes that could be mentioned at 100 mg/kg/day in dogs, are increased incidences of 
clinically relevant skin changes (red discoloration and thickened skin) and decrease in body weight 
gain. For the dog studies, a NOAEL of 10 mg/kg/day is considered appropriate.  
Toxicokinetics and interspecies comparison 
The systemic exposure of zanubrutinib (BGB-3111) increased dose proportionally without apparent 
accumulation. No sex difference where noted in the dogs but a higher exposure was detected in female 
rats compared to male rats. The applicant has revised the Cmax ratio (animal to human) and the AUC 
ratio (animal to human) in the interspecies comparison as requested by using the geometric mean of 
Cmax (299 ng/ml) and AUC0-24h (2099 h*ng/mL) of zanubrutinib following multiple oral doses to 
patients with B-cell malignancies in Study BGB-3111-AU-003 for comparison. The interspecies 
comparison table will be updated accordingly. The systemic exposure (AUC) at the redefined NOAEL of 
100 mg/kg/day in rats and 10 mg/kg/day in dogs was approximately 13 and 3-fold human systemic 
exposure.  
The systemic exposure of the metabolite BGB-7941 was evaluated in the 26-week repeat-dose study in 
rats. BGB-7941 appeared to increase less than dose proportionally without apparent drug accumula-
tion, however, female rats appeared to have a higher systemic exposure than males. 
Genotoxicity 
Zanubrutinib did not induce mutations when adequately tested in histidine-requiring strains of 
Salmonella typhimurium (TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537) and Escherichia coli (WP2 uvrA) at 
concentrations up to 5000 μg/plate in the absence and presence of a rat liver metabolic activation 
system (±S9).  
In an in vitro mammalian chromosome aberration tests in Chinese hamster ovary cells, Zanubrutinib 
was negative at the presence and absence of metabolic activation. However, a deviation was noted in 
the S9 activated 3 h treatment group at 60 µg/mL but since no changes were noted at other dose 
groups at this or higher dose-levels, the study director’s discussion of lack of biological relevance was 
accepted.    
In an in vivo chromosomal aberration test (micronucleus) in rats, zanubrutinib was not clastogenic 
when administered at doses up to 2000 mg/kg/day. Although a dose-dependent increase of MN-PCE 
frequency (p≤0.05, Cochran-Armitage) was identified by statistical analysis at 24 h in male, this were 
still within the range of negative controls. By comparison to toxicokinetic data from the repeat-dose 
studies, sufficient exposure to clinical safety margins were obtained at all doses tested (safety margin 
of 2-5-fold at the lowest doses of 50 mg/kg). No mortality was observed in any of the treatment 
groups.   
Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Reproduction and developmental toxicity 
Fertility and early embryonic development 
A fertility and early embryonic development study were conducted in male and female rats with dose 
of 30, 100 and 300 mg/kg administered daily by oral gavage. No test article-related effect on male and 
female fertility parameters were noted at doses up to 300 mg/kg/day. However, 12% post-
implantation loss (compared to 6% in the control group) and abnormal sperm morphology were 
detected at dose of 300 mg/kg. Despite of these changes, the applicant determined the overall NOAEL 
= 300 mg/kg, which is not endorsed. The implantation finding has been taken into consideration and 
the NOAEL reduced to 100 mg/kg/day with a revised safety margin of 3-fold.   
Clinical signs of soft stool and nasal discharge observed at high doses which corresponded to findings 
in the repeat-dose studies.    
Embryo-foetal development 
Embryo-foetal developmental studies were conducted in both rats (doses of 30, 75 and 150 
mg/kg/day) and rabbits (doses of 30, 70 and 150 mg/kg/day) according to guideline. In rat foetuses, a 
higher incidence of two or three chamber hearts were observed at all doses and should be considered a 
teratogenic effect and addressed sufficiently in the SmPC 4.6 and 5.3 with safety margin specifications. 
The heart malformations were detected from doses 3-4 times clinical systemic exposure in patients 
and occurred with a dose-dependent increase in incidence from 0.3% to 1.5% at the highest dose of 
150 mg/kg/day. Additionally, a selection of three different kidney variations (i.e. dilated renal pelvis, 
convoluted ureters and dilated ureters) were observed in the rat foetuses. In response to a question, 
the applicant has provided requested historical control data and MARTA data, showing that the 
observed kidney variations are within the maximum span of these reference data. Furthermore, as no 
kidney-related adverse effects were observed in the clinical setting, the issue will not be further 
pursued. No NOAELs were determined for the F1 generation but the NOAEL estimated by the assessor 
was less than 30 mg/kg/day (F1: NOAEL < 30 mg/kg/day). 
Except a transient decrease in body weight in the high dose group in the first days of the study, no 
significant changes were noted in the maternal rats in the embryo-developmental study (F0: NOAEL = 
150 mg/kg/day).    
In the embryo-foetal developmental study in rabbits, a slight but statistically significant increased 
post-implantation loss (9.3% compared to 3.1% in control) was observed at the 150 mg/kg/day.  
When closely inspecting the study report (180-0167-TX), a slight increase in the number of skeletal 
malformations were noted in the rabbit fetuses with a potential dose-dependent occurrence in 
supernumerary sternebra in addition to more individual occurring malformation of the ribs, vertebra 
and sternebra. The occurrence of supernumerary sternebra were according to the applicant within 
historical control data, however, the article by Ema M from 2012 were not submitted for assessment. 
The article by Ema et al. 2012 was provided on request and the observed malformations of the ribs, 
vertebra and sternebra appeared to be within the maximum range reported and the malformations 
were considered to represent expected variability and not related to zanubrutinib treatment. In 
maternal rabbits, a 3.2% decrease in body weight were observed in the high dose group of 150 
mg/kg/day and corresponding to general findings of inappetence and periodically decrease food 
consumption in all groups. Abortions were additionally seen with a slightly increasing trend in the 
treated animals but without a clear dose-dependent occurrence. However, according to the applicant 
no obvious changes in body weight, food consumption or macroscopic findings preceded the abortions 
and a direct treatment-related effect could not be established.  
The overall NOAEL in rabbits was determined to 150 mg/kg/day by the applicant, which is not 
endorsed due to findings of e.g. post-implantation loss (F1) and decreasing body weight (F0) among 
other issues at this dose. The implantation finding has been taken into consideration and the NOAEL 
reduced to 70 mg/kg/day with a revised safety margin of 25-fold. 
Additionally, in TK analysis of the rabbit study, the systemic exposure of dams was considerably lower 
on GD18 than on GD6. In the next round of assessment, the applicant provided supporting individual 
systemic exposure data in pregnant rabbits. The systemic exposure of dams was lower on GD18 than 
GD6 at high dose group, but not at low or middle dose groups. Based on individual data, plasma 
concentrations were lower at the 1- and 8-hour time points. It is agreed that reason may be an 
endogenous animal variation in exposure due to pregnancy and the low animal number (n=4) per 
group.     
Pre- and postnatal development and maternal function 
Pre- and postnatal development toxicity studies were conducted in pregnant female rats (F0) and their 
offspring (F1) with dose of 30, 75 and 150 mg/kg/day zanubrutinib. The most significant finding was 
ophthalmic lesions in the F1 animals at dose ≥ 30 mg/kg/day, with a dose-dependent increase in 
severity and occurence from 26-46% (compared to 26% in control). Clinical observations of eye 
abnormalities (protuding eyes, big eyes and white eyes) were noted in addition to ophthalmological 
findings of pupil dilation post-mydriatics, cataract, corneal opacity, invisible intraocular structure, and 
unclear fundus. The abnormalities occured at safety margins of 3-4 times human clinical exposure 
(AUC) and should be sufficiently adressed in the SmPC section 4.6 and 5.3. The clinical relevance of 
the findings is however uncertain since ophthalmic lesions were observed in the control group and they 
are also a common background finding in young Sprague Dawley rats as reported in the literature.  
Additionally, 5-7% decrease in body weight of the F1 animals were detected from laction to 
termination at doses ≥ 75 mg/kg/day (13 times human AUC). No effect was detected on fertility and 
reproduction parameters of the F1 animals. The NOAEL for F1 animal was estimated by the assessor to 
< 30 mg/kg/day.  
Beside clinical signs similar to the findings in the repeat-dose studies (transient salivation, decrease 
food intake, swelling of the lip and perinasal discharge), no significant changes with relevance to peri- 
and post-development toxicity were observed in the mother animals of F0. The NOAEL for F0 animals 
were therefore estimated to 150 mg/kg/day, in accordance with the suggestion made by the applicant.  
A study evaluating transfer of zanubrutinib into milk was not located. Since the intended patient 
population are elderly, additionally animal studies are not supported from a 3R perspective. However, 
the lack of excretion data should be sufficiently addressed in the SmPC section 4.6 along with a 
recommendation to discontinue breast-feeding.      
Juvenile studies  
No juvenile studies were conducted for zanubrutinib, which is acceptable as the intended patient 
population with Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia has a median age of 63 to 68 years.   
Other toxicity studies  
Metabolites 
The toxicokinetics of BGB-7941 was evaluated in the 6-month repeat-dose study in rats. BGB-7941 
composed a higher systemic exposure in rats compared to humans (only present at 5.37% of 
radioactivity in plasma) and are therefore considered sufficiently characterized. Additionally, no further 
studies are required for metabolites present at less than 10% in human plasma.     
Acrylic acid was thoroughly discussed in the pharmacokinetics section and was therefore not further 
addressed in this part.   
Impurities 
The mutagenic potential of 46 impurities were assessed by in-silico analysis using CASE Ultra software 
with two complementary methodologies (expert rule-based and statistical). A mutagenic-alert in 
structure were identified for six of the impurities and a mini-Ames test were conducted. All Ames-test 
were negative. All 46 impurities were therefore considered non-mutagenic in accordance with ICH M7 
guideline. 
Phototoxicity 
Light absorption of BGB-3111 was only noted between 290 and 320 nm (UVB) with MEC higher than 
1000 L mol-1 cm-1, and no absorption above 320 nm. BGB-3111 was photostable when tested under 
light (4500Ix) in a stress condition. It has a favorable PK profile with short half-life and no tissue 
accumulation. 
Based on the information from ICH S10, UV absorption only noted at UVB is rarely considered a 
problem for pharmaceuticals with systemic exposure, since UVB minimally penetrates beyond the 
epidermis; for compounds that only absorb light below 400 nm, such wavelengths do not reach the 
retina of the adult human eye due to limited penetration of the cornea, lens, and vitreous body. 
Additionally, there were no adverse effects noted in the eyes upon ophthalmology examination in 
repeat-dose toxicity studies of BGB-3111 up to 6-month or 9-month duration in both rats and dogs. 
 
Based on its photochemical properties and available nonclinical data and general information, the 
potential risk of phototoxicity of BGB-3111 is considered low. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The pKa for zanubrutinib was calculated to be 3.33 and therefore this compound will be in its neutral 
form at environmentally relevant pH’s (5 to 9). The log Kow was determined in a GLP study at 3 pH’s. 
At pH 5, the log Kow was determined using the slow stirring method (OECD 123); at pH 7 and 9, the 
partition coefficient was determined with the shake flask method (OECD 107). The log Kow values 
were 3.2 at pH 5, 3.6 at pH 7 and 3.7 at pH 9. As all values were below the trigger of 4.5, a further 
PBT/vPvB assessment was not required.

(N) 
An Fpen default value of 0.01 (1%) is proposed in the guideline EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2 
assuming that 100% of the patient population is daily taking the medicinal product. For zanubrutinib, 
the dosing regimen includes an oral dose of 160 mg taken twice daily (320 mg daily) over the whole 
year and thus refinement of Fpen based on treatment regimen is not possible. The prevalence 
indicated in the orphan designation was 1.4 per 10,000 (or 0.00014) which was used in the calculation 
of PECSURFACEWATER. The calculated PECSURFACEWATER  of 0.022 μg/L for WM indication exceeded 0.01 
µg/mL and thus a Phase II environmental fate and effects assessment was triggered.  
GLP-compliant Algal growth inhibition test (OECD 201), Daphnia sp. reproduction test (OECD 211) and 
Fish, Early Life Stage Toxicity Test (OECD 210) recommended in Phase II Tier A have been completed. 
Based on screening data set in algae, Daphnia and fish, the ratio PECsurfacewater/PNECsurfacewater for the 
drug substance is below 1. Based on obtained effect parameters (NOEC), the fish is the most sensitive 
species for PNECwater prediction. However, in OECD 210 study effects greater than 10% was observed 
for the end-point body weight in all test concentrations. Hence, the lowest concentration tested has to 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
be considered as LOEC and a reliable NOEC cannot be determined. According to the guideline 
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2, PNECwater calculation should be based on the lowest NOEC results 
from the base set long-term toxicity tests in three trophic levels. Based on obtained effect parameters 
(NOEC), the fish is the most sensitive species for PNECwater prediction. Zanubrutinib had a significant 
effect on the growth of the exposed larvae. Both body length and body weight end-points, being 
indicative of larval growth, were significantly affected at mean measured concentrations of 0.017 mg/L 
and higher. The NOEC was below the lowest concentration tested (i.e. <0.017 mg/L) for both 
endpoints and thus, reliable NOEC could not be determined for these parameters.  
The CHMP further recommends a new OECD 210 study on the environmental risk assessment of 
zanubrutinib according to EMEA/ CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2, 01 June 2006.  
Adsorption and desorption parameters were determined using the batch equilibrium method (OECD 
106) with three soils and two sludges as recommended in EMEA/ CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2. 
Additionally, the experimentally determined log Kow 3.2 at pH 5, 3.6 at pH 7 and 3.7 at pH 9 triggers 
a need of performing a bioaccumulation study in fish. The substance is not readily biodegradable and if 
the results from the water sediment study (OECD 308) demonstrate significant shifting of the drug to 
the sediment, effects on sediment organism should be investigated in Tier B. The GLP-compliant 
Aerobic and anaerobic transformation in aquatic sediment systems (OECD 308) study, Sediment 
organism study Chironomus sp (OECD 218) and bioaccumulation study in fish (OECD 305) are 
presumably ongoing.   
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points to be addressed: 
• 
Phase II of the ERA is still ongoing. A standard Phase II Tier A assessment is ongoing and the 
results triggered Tier B assessment including sediment organism study in Chironomus sp. and 
bioaccumulation study in fish. These studies have been initiated. The full package will be 
completed by 4th Quarter 2022, and the applicant commits to submitting the final ERA report in 
December 2022. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
GLP compliance 
Initially GLP compliance was questioned, as the full non-clinical programme was performed in a non-
MAD OECD country. However as the test facility has been included in the Belgian GLP compliance 
monitoring Authority, during the period studies with zanubrutinib was performed at the test facility, 
and no major scientific reasons for triggering a study specific GLP inspection was identified the studies 
included in the present MAA were considered GLP compliant; no GLP inspections will be triggered in the 
current MAA. This position is based on the fact that GLP and related inspections are harmonized across 
all OECD MAD countries and therefore the outcome of inspections carried out by the GLP CMA of a EU 
MS part of the OECD MAD (in this case Belgium) ensure in principle the same standards of inspections 
carried out by any other OECD MAD country acknowledging that the site was included in the Belgian 
GLP Monitoring program, inspected every two years and found GLP compliant during these inspections, 
including in the period in which the studies considered for assessment were conducted.   
 
 
 
Pharmacology 
BGB-3111 is designed to form a covalent bond at the BTK active site. This was shown in vitro both by 
inhibition of downstream reactions and precipitation experiments. Functional activity was demonstrated 
in cancer cell lines. BGB-3111 appeared to be selective for mantle dell lines, TMD8 and ABC-DBCL cell 
lines. BGB-3111 occupied intracellular BTK at similar potency to ibrutinib. While BGB-3111 was shown 
to be functional in relevant cancer cell lines, ex vivo studies in primary lymphoma cells from patients 
was not conducted, as such specimens are not available commercially. 
BGB-3111 was consistently more potent and efficient than ibrutinib in NOD/SCID disease models of 
subcutaneous lymphoma tumours. This is most likely due to an increased bioavailability. However, 
efficacy in the systemic lymphoma model was less convincing, since the animals appeared to 
deteriorate almost simultaneously regardless of treatment. Body weight data was recalculated in the 
next round of assessment and statistically significant differences was found between vehicle control 
and treatment group on Day 51 and 54. However, the effect of decrease in body weight over the 
course of treatment in the NOD-SCID mouse appear not to be clinically relevant as no apparent 
changes were observed in clinical trials. Increase in survival as compared to the control group was 20-
40%. 
The potential and possible mechanisms for resistance development to zanubrutinib was not studied in 
WM resistant and wild-type WM cells. However, studies are ongoing in other cancer cell lines including 
IMD-8 and Ramos and results are expected to be published once available. 
A PKPD study in ICR mice showed rapid BTK protein binding in PBMC and spleen. Rebound was faster 
in spleen compared to PBMC. Exposure data indicated a 3-fold difference in bioavailability between 
ibrutinib and BGB-3111. Moreover, it was demonstrated that 70% BTK occupancy occurred at lower 
than clinically relevant plasma concentrations. 
Non-clinical in vitro and in vivo studies of the pharmacology of BGB-3111 indicate proof of concept in 
terms of mode of action. However, since ex vivo studies using relevant primary lymphoma cells are 
missing and the efficacy in the systemic xenograft model appear limited, non-clinical proof of concept 
is not entirely convincing.  
BGB-3111 was more selective than ibrutinib on known human kinases, however, still react with other 
kinases than BTK. The low potency on ITK and EGFR kinases compared to ibrutinib is likely to lead to 
lower incidence of diarrhoea and a preservation of T and MK cell functions. Moreover, it was 
demonstrated that in contrast to ibrutinib, BGB-3111 was 10-fold weaker in the ability to inhibit 
rituximab induced ADCC correlating with its low potency on ITK. 
A classical safety pharmacology program of stand-alone studies in rat CNS, respiratory) and dog 
(cardiovascular) was presented. No concerns arose from these studies.  
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics appeared dose-linear and time-independent in rat and dog with moderate 
bioavailability. However, bioavailability was lower in male rats compared to female rats. 
A study of the pharmacokinetics of 14C-BGB-3111 in rat showed that t1/2 values were 31.6 -34.8 hours 
in blood and 7.75 -10.5 hours in plasma, indicating slower elimination of BGB-3111 related 
radioactivity in blood than in plasma (RTC00782). This may correlate to concentration dependent 
preference of BGB-3111 for red blood cells in the rat. A similar evaluation was performed in humans 
(BGB-3111-105 CSR). This study showed similar half-life of BGB-3111 related radioactivity in plasma 
and blood (44.4 hours in blood and 46.7 hours in plasma), hence the difference found in rat was 
apparently not clinically relevant. 
In a distribution study in rats, BGB-3111 (non-labelled) showed preference for the GI system and the 
liver. This was confirmed in a QWBA study. Half-life of BGB-3111 related radioactivity was varying with 
long half-life in organs associated with adverse effects in patients e.g. bone marrow, spleen, stomach 
wall and lung. Small intestinal wall and liver showed the highest tissue:plasma ratio of 47 and 26 
respectively. 
BGB-3111 is extensively metabolised in rat and human. Metabolism in dog was only investigated in 
vitro. The main concern for metabolism is the acrylic acid found to comprise of the major part of the 
total radioactivity in plasma in the human AME study. The Applicant further clarified the positive safety 
assessment of acrylic acid as a metabolite in human plasma by mainly referring to the fact that acrylic 
acid was present in the dosing material of BGB-3111 in the human AME study (radio-chromatogram 
submitted) and not in the ADME study in rat where the purity of the dosing material was confirmed by 
a radio-chromatogram. Moreover, deacrylated metabolites were present in both rat, dog and human in 
very low amounts indicating very low amounts of acrylic acid would be produced. Hence, the 
importance of this clearance pathway is minimal. 
BGB-3111 related radioactivity was found to be covalently bound to plasma in a rat metabolism study 
but the applicant clarified that the selectivity of zanubrutinib is lower in rat as compared to human, 
since the covalent-bound radioactivity was high in rat plasma (22-25%) and lower in human plasma 
(5.5 to 6%). Comparing with ibrutinib, covalent binding in human plasma is much lower for 
zanubrutinib (38-51% vs 5.5 to 6%) indicating higher selectivity of zanubrutinib versus ibrutinib, which 
is reassuring. 
BGB-3111 was metabolised to a higher degree in rat as compared to human. The active metabolite 
BGB-7941 was present in rat in higher amounts than in humans and is considered qualified. Otherwise 
BGB-3111 was extensively metabolised in both species by several routes including a broad panel of 
both phase 1 and phase 2 metabolites, although UGTs seem to play a minor role. 
BGB-3111 is mainly metabolised by CYP3A4. BGB-3111 related radioactivity was mainly excreted via 
faeces in both rat and human. Potential drug-drug interaction with CYPs and transporters was 
evaluated using classical assays and followed up clinical studies and/or PBPK modelling.  
Toxicology 
The non-clinical toxicity and toxicokinetic profile of zanubrutinib (BGB-3111) was characterized in 
Sprague-Dawley rats and Beagle dogs in single-dose studies and 14-day, 28-day, 91-day and 6/9-
month repeat-dose studies. Rats and dogs were chosen for the in vivo toxicity evaluation, as they are 
pharmacologically relevant species based on BTK sequence homology and functional assay.   
No mortality was observed in the single-dose studies in rats and dogs at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day 
and no severe toxic effects were noted.    
In rat repeat dose studies up to 6-month treatment, test article related mortality was noted at the 
dose of 1,000 mg/kg/day (81x clinical AUC) with histopathologic findings in the gastrointestinal tract. 
Other findings were mainly noted in the pancreas (atrophy, fibroplasia, haemorrhage, and/or 
inflammatory cell infiltration) at the doses ≥ 30 mg/kg/day (3x clinical AUC), in the skin around the 
nose/mouth/eyes (inflammatory cell infiltration, erosion/ulcer) from the dose of 300 mg/kg/day (16x 
clinical AUC), and in the lung (presence of macrophages in the alveolar) at the dose of 300 mg/kg/day. 
All these findings were fully or partially reversed after a 6-week recovery except for the pancreatic 
findings which were not considered clinically relevant.  
Mortality appeared to be caused by severe gastrointestinal toxicity with histopathological findings of 
erosion, necrosis, ulceration and acute inflammation. The findings occurring at safety margins of 62-
71-fold systemic exposure in humans (AUC) and it is agreed that the risk of lethal GI toxicity is 
considered to be minimal. However, findings of less severe GI disturbances as e.g. diarrhea occurred 
even at low doses in both rats and dogs and was considered to be clinically relevant, as it is potentially 
related to inhibition of EGFR in the intestine. The findings were transient in rats at 300 mg/kg/day but 
more pronounced in dogs, with a change into watery/mucoid diarrhoea in 50% of the male dogs at 
doses of ≥10 mg/kg/day and in 100% of all dogs at doses of 100 mg/kg/day (see SmPC section 5.3).   
Another frequent finding in the repeat-dose studies were skin lesions in the face of the rats and 
face/body of the dogs. In the next round of assessment, it was agreed that the skin changes are of 
clinical relevance, potential caused by inhibition of EGFR in the skin and occur at doses of 300 
mg/kg/day in rat and 10 mg/kg/day in dogs. Changes in clinical pathological parameters (hematology, 
serum chemistry and urinanalysis parameters) were also noted in both rats and dogs with a tendency 
of a dose-dependent increases in magnitude and number of changed parameters over time. Even 
though, many of the parameters were significantly changed compared to control animals, most were 
still within historical reference data. Additionally, an across species dose-dependent increase in 
neutrophils was noted but the clinical relevance was considered to be low, as the finding differed from 
the clinical setting, where neutropenia was observed (see discussion on clinical safety).   
In dog repeat dose studies up to 9-month treatment, test article related findings were mainly noted in 
the gastrointestinal tract (soft/watery/mucoid stool), skin (rash, red discoloration, and thickened/ 
scaling), and in the mesenteric, mandibular, and gut associated lymph nodes and spleen (lymphoid 
depletion or erythrophagocytosis) at the doses from 10 mg/kg/day (3x clinical AUC) to 100 mg/kg/day 
(18x clinical AUC). All these findings were fully or partially reversed after a 6-week recovery.  
Zanubrutinib was not mutagenic in a bacterial mutagenicity (Ames) assay, was not clastogenic in a 
chromosome aberration assay in mammalian (Chinese hamster ovary) cells, nor was it clastogenic in 
an in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in rats. The absence of carcinogenicity studies with 
zanubrutinib is justified based on a weight of evidence argumentation and in line with the relevant 
guideline.  
A combined male and female fertility and early embryonic development study was conducted in rats at 
oral zanubrutinib doses of 30, 100 and 300 mg/kg/day. No effect on male or female fertility was noted 
but at the highest dose tested, morphological abnormalities in sperm and increased post-implantation 
loss were noted. The dose of 100 mg/kg/day is approximately 13-fold higher than the human 
therapeutic exposure. 
Embryo-foetal development toxicity studies were conducted in both rats and rabbits. Zanubrutinib was 
administered orally to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at doses of 30, 75, and 
150 mg/kg/day. Malformations in the heart (2- or 3-chambered hearts with the incidence of 
0.3 %-1.5 %) were noted at all dose levels in the absence of maternal toxicity. The dose of 
30 mg/kg/day is approximately 5-fold higher than the human therapeutic exposure (see SmPC section 
5.3).  
Administration of zanubrutinib to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at 30, 70, and 
150 mg/kg/day resulted in post-implantation loss at the highest dose. The dose of 70 mg/kg is 
approximately 25-fold higher than the human therapeutic exposure and was associated with maternal 
toxicity. 
In a pre- and post-natal developmental toxicity study, zanubrutinib was administered orally to rats at 
doses of 30, 75, and 150 mg/kg/day from implantation through weaning. The offspring from the 
middle and high dose groups had decreased body weights preweaning, and all dose groups had 
adverse ocular findings (e.g., cataract, protruding eye). The dose of 30 mg/kg/day is approximately 5-
fold higher than the human therapeutic exposure. 
In the fertility and early embryonic developmental study in rats, 12% post-implantation loss 
(compared to 6% in the control group) and abnormal sperm morphology were detected at dose of 300 
mg/kg. The NOAEL was revised to 100 mg/kg/day providing a safety margin of 3-fold to human 
therapeutic dose.  
Reproductive toxicity studies revealed a teratogenic effect of zanubrutinib in rats, observed as a dose-
dependent increase in incidence (0,3%-1,5%) of two- and three chambered hearts in rat fetuses at all 
dose levels (≥ 30 mg/kg/day), corresponding to a safety margin of 3-4 human systemic exposure 
(AUC) for the lowest dose. An increased post-implantation loss (9.3% compared to 3.1% in control) in 
maternal rabbits at the highest dose of 150 mg/kg/day resulted in revision of the NOAEL to 70 
mg/kg/day with a safety margin to human clinical exposure of approximately 25-fold.  
Additionally, in TK analysis of the rabbit study, the systemic exposure of dams was considerably lower 
on GD18 than on GD6. The difference in systemic exposure was suggested to be caused by 
endogenous animal variation in exposure due to pregnancy and the low animal number (n=4) per 
group. 
No mutagenic potential was noted for the tested 46 impurities. Further phototoxicity studies was 
waivered based on additional assessment of existing clinical data in accordance with ICH S10 guideline, 
showing that only few treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) were reported in relation to 
photosensitivity. Additional clinical assessment was provided based on existing data in accordance with 
recommendations in ICH S10. It appears that, after > 1700 patient-years of follow-up only 12 (1.5%) 
patients treated with zanubrutinib reported a treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) related to 
photosensitivity (see also Clinical Safety discussion). All patients except one were white and from 
countries where white individuals are of particular risk (i.e., Australia.).   
ERA 
Phase I of the ERA has been completed and Phase II is still ongoing, and the updated ERA report will 
be submitted to the CHMP. Additionally, a new OECD 210 study should be conducted as the submitted 
study did not provide reliable NOEC for the end-point body weight and hence proper environmental risk 
assessment of zanubrutinib according to EMEA/ CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2, 01 June 2006.   
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical development of zanubrutinib is considered satisfactory. All relevant information is 
included in the PI.  
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points to be addressed: 
Phase I of the ERA has been completed and Phase II is still ongoing. A standard Phase II Tier A 
assessment is ongoing and the results triggered Tier B assessment including sediment organism study 
in Chironomus sp. and bioaccumulation study in fish. These studies have been initiated. The full 
package will be completed by 4th Quarter 2022, and the applicant commits to submitting the final ERA 
report in December 2022.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods 
Methods 
Bioanalysis: Quantification of zanubrutinib was performed using a validated LC-MS/MS method. 
Across clinical studies study analysis performed well and the bioanalysis conducted in support of 
zanubrutinib clinical development is mainly considered acceptable.  
Pop PK model: The objectives of the Pop-PK analysis were to determine the effects of demographic, 
pathophysiologic, and disease-related covariates on the PK of zanubrutinib to better understand clinical 
factors that might affect exposure in individual subjects. The PK analysis dataset included data from 
nine clinical studies, BGB-3111-103, BGB-3111- 104, BGB-3111-105, BGB-3111-106, BGB-3111-AU-
003, BGB-3111-1002, BGB-3111-205, BGB-3111-206, and BGB-3111-302. The final Model 
Development Dataset included 4,925 zanubrutinib plasma concentration measurements from 632 
subjects, 90 of whom were healthy volunteers and the rest were patients. Covariates were selected 
based on clinical judgment, mechanistic plausibility and prior knowledge. These covariates were either 
demographics-related or hepatic and renal function related. 
The final PopPK model for zanubrutinib was based on a previous 2-compartment model with an 
absorption depot. The old model was updated with additional data and data with non-linear kinetics 
(480 mg) was excluded, thus representing a dose range of 20-320 mg zanubrutinib. Health status and 
baseline ALT were identified as significant covariates of CL/F. 
Figure 8 PopPK model Diagram for Zanubrutinib 
Parameter estimates for the final PopPK model for zanubrutinib are presented in Table 7. The 
geometric mean elimination half-life was 3.44 hours with a CV of 40.0%. The bootstrap 95% 
confidence intervals were in general wider than the asymptotic confidence intervals estimated by 
NONMEM. No trends were observed in the presented GoF plots.

The effect of health status and baseline ALT on zanubrutinib steady-state exposure was further 
investigated in a sensitivity analysis. Baseline ALT had little influence on exposure metrics whereas the 
sensitivity analysis clearly showed a PK difference between healthy volunteers and patients, with 
patients having lower exposure than healthy subjects. 
E-R analyses: Explorative exposure boxplots stratified by response values were plotted against the 
probability of response for selected measures of efficacy and safety. If any trends were detected, 
further evaluation by logistic regression modelling were conducted. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
C-QTc relations for zanubrutinib and the positive control moxifloxacin were both described by separate 
linear mixed-effects models. The GOF plots for the linear model fit for both compounds were 
acceptable and data did not indicate any hysteresis or C-QTc relation, even the data for zanubrutinib 
could be fitted with a quadratic term. 
PBPK model:

compartment (SAC) 
A PBPK model for zanubrutinib was created in Simcyp using in-vitro data, data from the human ADME 
study (BGB-3111-105) along with other clinical data obtained in healthy subjects (HV) and in patients 
in the dose range 20-320 mg QD zanubrutinib.

The clinical data of zanubrutinib as victim of itraconazole (BGB-3111-104) was used to test and adjust 
CLint and fmCYP3A4. Only metabolism by CYP3A4 was assumed and therefore only modulators of 
CYP3A4 were investigated. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 12 Simulation of plasma concentration- time profiles of zanubrutinib in healthy

The zanubrutinib model was verified by comparison of model predictions to clinical data: Single dose 
studies in HV (BGB-3111-104, 106 and 107); multiple dose studies in HV (BGB-3111-108) and in 
patients (BGB-3111-AU-003) in addition to published clinical data for itraconazole and its interaction

The clinical data of zanubrutinib as victim of rifampin (BGB-3111-104) was used to verify the PBPK 
model for zanubrutinib + rifampicin.

Zanubrutinib as a victim of DDI of strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (itraconazole) and strong inducer (rifampin) 
was investigated in clinical Study BGB-3111-104. The zanubrutinib model was used to predict DDI 
potential for zanubrutinib as a victim co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, itraconazole, 
ritonavir and clarithromycin, respectively; moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, erythromycin, fluconazole and 
diltiazem, respectively; mild CYP3A4 inhibitors, fluvoxamine, cyclosporine and cimetidine, respectively. 
Ongoing Study BGB-3111-113 will confirm the proposed dose recommendations for zanubrutinib in the 
presence of moderate (fluconazole and diltiazem) and strong (clarithromycin and voriconazole) CYP3A 
inhibitors. 
The zanubrutinib model was used to predict the DDI potential for zanubrutinib as a victim co-
administered with strong CYP3A4 inducers, rifampicin and carbamazepine, respectively, and moderate 
CYP3A4 inducer, efavirenz. Data from DDI study BGB-3111-112 with co-administration of rifabutin (a 
moderate CYP3A inducer) have also been submitted and the SmPC amended accordingly.  
The impact of administration of a PPI on zanubrutinib absorption was modelled by increasing gastric pH 
from 1.5 to 4.5 in the standard Simcyp healthy volunteer population (fasted model). The gastric effect 
of omeprazole on zanubrutinib PK was also investigated in vivo as part of Study BGB-3111-108. 
Zanubrutinib as a perpetrator was investigated in vivo in a cocktail DDI study (BGB-3111-108) with 
substrates for CYP3A4 (midazolam), CYP2C9 (S-warfarin), CYP2C19 (omeprazole), P-gp (digoxin) and 
BCRP (rosuvastatin, also substrate for OATP1B1, OATP1B3). The zanubrutinib model was used to 
predict the DDI potential for zanubrutinib as a perpetrator when co-administered with CYP3A 
substrate, ethinylestradiol; CYP2B6 substrate bupropion and CYP2C8 substrates, repaglinide and 
rosiglitazone.  
 
 
 
 
Absorption  
The in vitro studies with Caco-2 cells and with Wild-type MDCK cells and MDCK-MDR1 cells suggested 
that zanubrutinib may be a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate. Based on its permeability constant 
(average Papp = 18.3 × 10-6 cm/s - 21.1 × 10-6 cm/s at 0.5 - 10 µM, respectively) in Caco-2 cells, 
zanubrutinib has high permeability across biological membranes when compared with high 
permeability marker propranolol and low permeability marker atenolol. Zanubrutinib is very slightly 
soluble 0.193 mg/ml in pH 1.2 hydrochloride acid buffer. The solubility shows decreasing trend when 
pH increases. The provided information supports the classification of zanubrutinib as BCS class II 
compound with low solubility and high permeability. 
In the clinical pharmacology studies, zanubrutinib was rapidly absorbed with median time to maximum 
concentration (Tmax) of 1.5-2.0 hours after single dose administration in healthy volunteers at fasted 
conditions. 
The exposure of zanubrutinib seem to increase dose proportionally between the consecutive doses 
from 20 mg to up to 320 mg when calculating the dose adjusted AUC after single dose administration. 
However, there is variability in the exposure between the studies. The elimination half-life varied 
between the studies and shows increasing trend with dose being approximately 5 to 6 hours in healthy 
volunteers after 160 mg dose.

In the clinical study BGB-3111-AU-003, pharmacokinetics of zanubrutinib was characterised after 
single-dose and multiple dose administration in patients with B-cell lymphoid malignancies (Figure 
2.3.1.1 and Table 2.3.1.2). According to the non-compartmental analysis of the pharmacokinetics in 
patients (Report BGB-3111-CP-006), zanubrutinib was rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a 
median Tmax of around 2 to 3 hours. The apparent terminal elimination half-life (t½) was 3-4 hours 
after 160 mg and 320 g doses in patients. 
After a single 160 mg dose administration of zanubrutinib (in the BID group) in patients, the geometric 
mean (%CV) Cmax and AUC0 ∞ were 304 (63.8%) ng/mL (N=76) and 1253 (59.0%) ng*h/mL (N=59), 
respectively. After a single 320 mg dose (n = 19), the geometric mean (%CV) Cmax and AUC0-∞ were 
566 (65.6%) ng/mL and 2538 (47.8%) ng*h/mL, respectively. 
There seems to be a dose-dependent increase in zanubrutinib exposure (maximum concentration 
[Cmax] and AUC) from 40 mg to 320 mg after single-dose and from 160 mg BID to 320 mg once daily 
(qd) after multiple-dose administration in patients with B-cell malignancies (Figure 2.3.1.1 and Table 
2.3.1.3). The arithmetic mean ± standard deviation (SD) AUC0-8h were 1079 ± 434.5 ng/ml and 1904 
± 846.8 ng/ml after one week of 160 mg BID and 320 mg dose once daily (QD), respectively, in 
multiple dose regimen. After multiple dose administration of 160 mg of zanubrutinib BID for one week, 
the arithmetic mean  
± SD (%CV) Cmax, and AUC0-24h were 338±168 (49.6%) ng/mL and 2261 ± 850.4 (37.6%) ng*h/mL, 
respectively. After multiple 320 mg dose QD for one week, the arithmetic mean (%CV) Cmax and 
AUC0-24h were 603 ± 290 (48.1%) ng/mL and 2172 ± 1024 (47.2%) ng*h/mL, respectively. 
Accumulation ratios for Cmax and AUC0-∞ indicated limited accumulation after one week of repeated 
administration. 
In the non-compartmental analysis, the pharmacokinetics of zanubrutinib showed high variability in 
patients. The inter-patient variability (CV%) after single-dose administration was 47.9% to 70.3% for 
Cmax and 44.6% to 63.8% for AUC0-∞. Coefficient of variation was 37.4% to 56.4% for Cmax and 33.0% 
to 44.5% for AUC0-8h after multiple dose administration.

Bioavailability: No bioavailability studies were conducted with zanubrutinib. In the mass balance 
study (BGB-311-105), approximately 38% of radioactivity was excreted as unchanged zanubrutinib in 
faeces indicating that fraction absorbed of zanubrutinib may be approximately 60%. According to the 
PBPK modelling report, a rough estimate of 15% oral bioavailability was made based on combination of 
data from different sources. 
Bioequivalence: The manufacturing site used for the pivotal study 302 is the intended commercial 
manufacturing site. The manufacturing sites for the other studies differed from the intended 
commercial manufacturing site. No bioequivalence studies were conducted between zanubrutinib 
manufactured at that site and zanubrutinib manufactured at one of the other sites. The batches 
manufactured at different sites were comparable, please see section 3.1 Quality aspects. 
Influence of food: The geometric mean ratios of high fat/fasting were 1.03 (0.845, 1.258) and 1.14 
(0.938, 1.379), whereas the ratios were higher for low fat /fasting for Cmax and AUC0-24: 1.51 
(1.239, 1.846) and 1.37 (1.140, 1.658) (Figure 6). The increase in exposure of 37% (AUC0-24) and 
12% (AUC0-infinite) is not considered clinically relevant, and in the pivotal study BGB-3111-302, no 
food restrictions were provided.

3111-103- Linear Scale 
Distribution 
The apparent volume of distribution was estimated to 522L at a dose of 160 mg bid indicating that 
zanubrutinib is mainly present outside the plasma compartment. Zanubrutinib was highly bound to 
plasma proteins with a fraction of 94.2%. The plasma protein binding was slightly lower in patients 
with hepatic impairment. 
Elimination 
The majority of the radioactivity was captured in faeces (87.1%), and only a small amount of the 
radioactivity was captured in urine (7.57%) up to 11 days after exposure. 
T½ was estimated to 2 to 4 hours following a single oral dose and clearance was estimated to 128 L/h.

Metabolism: Zanubrutinib was extensively metabolised by several metabolic pathways. The main 
metabolic pathway was CYP3A that accounted for 70% of the metabolism and effect of genetic 
polymorphism on metabolism is expected to be minimal.  
Interconversion: The active form of zanubrutinib is the S configuration. The Applicant states that the 
compound cannot interconvert to the R configuration. Hence, no pharmacological activity of an R-
enantiomer is expected.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Study 003 evaluated PK at increasing single doses from 40 mg to 320 mg. The study showed a dose 
proportional increase in AUC0-∞ and Cmax. Similar to the dose proportionality assessment based on 
single dose PK data, the exposure (AUC and Cmax) after multiple-dose administration also increased 
approximately dose-proportionally from 40 to 320 mg of zanubrutinib.  
The accumulation ratio was close to 1 for all doses (40 mg to 320 mg) with regards to AUC0-8, AUC0-
12 and Cmax. Furthermore, trough concentrations at week 5 day 1 and week 9 day 1 were low for 
doses of 160 mg x 2 and 320 mg x 1 indicating no accumulation of zanubrutinib.

Impaired hepatic function: Severe hepatic impairment based on Child-Pugh score was associated 
with a 60% higher exposure to zanubrutinib compared with normal hepatic function. Moderate and 
mild impaired hepatic function was not associated with increased exposure. Increased exposure in 
subjects with severe hepatic impairment was caused by lower protein binding and lower clearance.

In vitro: The in vitro studies showed that GB-3111 was primarily metabolized by rCYP3A4, which was 
confirmed in the human DDI study. Other rP450s tested had low or minimum contribution to BGB-3111 
metabolism. 
In vitro studies indicated that BGB-3111 was not an inducer of CYP1A2 but has induction potential for 
CYP3A, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 at concentrations equal or higher than 3 μM in human 
hepatocytes. Induction of the enzymes was also investigated in a PBPK model. The combined in vivo 
and in vitro data provides adequate assurance that zanubrutinib will most likely not have clinically 
relevant inductive effect on CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 enzymes.  
In vitro studies indicated that the inhibitory effect of zanubrutinib was of minor importance.  
In vitro studies showed that BGB-3111 was not a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, OAT1, and 
OAT3. But the studies indicated that BGB-3111 was likely to be a substrate of human P-gp efflux 
transporter. The Applicant did not further examine the effect of p-gp inhibitor on zanubrutinib but 
discusses that due to the high permeability, the absorption of zanubritinib is not likely to be affected by 
p-gp inhibition. Contribution of BCRP to total bioavailability of zanubrutinib is not expected to be 
significant.  
Zanubrutinib did not show inhibition of transporters at concentrations up to 10 μM and 5 μM. Due to 
high concentrations of zanubrutinib, in vivo DDI studies on p-gp and BCRP were conducted.  
In Silico: A verified PBPK model was used to predict the DDI potential for zanubrutinib as a victim 
when co administered with various CYP3A inhibitors and inducers. Plasma concentration profiles of 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
zanubrutinib (160 mg) after a single dose and at steady-state with or without multiple doses of strong 
CYP3A inhibitors/inducers were predicted. To maximize the impact of the CYP-modulators on steady-
state zanubrutinib exposure, both CYP inducers and inhibitors were administered for 14 days and 7 
days prior to starting zanubrutinib administration. The DDI were obtained for zanubrutinib co-
administered with: 
a. 
Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, itraconazole (200 mg QD), ritonavir (BID 100 mg) and 
clarithromycin (250 mg BID), respectively 
b. 
Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, erythromycin (500 mg Q6h), fluconazole (200 mg QD and 400 mg 
QD) and diltiazem (60 mg TID), respectively 
c. 
Mild CYP3A4 inhibitors, fluvoxamine (50 mg QD), cyclosporine (200 mg QD) and cimetidine 
(400 mg BID), respectively 
d. 
Strong CYP3A4 inducers, rifampicin (600 mg QD) and carbamazepine (400 mg BID), 
respectively 
e. 
Moderate CYP3A4 inducer, efavirenz (600 mg QD) 
The verified model was also used to predict DDI potential for zanubrutinib as a perpetrator when co-
administered with CYP3A, CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 substrates. Plasma concentration profiles of these 
substrate drugs with or without multiple dose administration of zanubrutinib 160 mg were simulated: 
• 
Prediction of impact of zanubrutinib 160 mg BID on the pharmacokinetics of CYP3A substrate, 
ethinylestradiol. 
• 
Prediction of impact of zanubrutinib 160 mg BID on the pharmacokinetics of CYP2B6 substrate 
bupropion. 
• 
Prediction of impact of zanubrutinib 160 mg BID on the pharmacokinetics of CYP2C8 
substrates, repaglinide and rosiglitazone. 
• 
Prediction of DDI with acid reducing agents due to pH-dependent solubility. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 22 Predicted zanubrutinib PK parameters (160 mg) and the ratio (with/without) co-
administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers 
The PBPK model showed a 3-4-fold increase in zanubrutinib AUC and Cmax when co-administered with 
a strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, except for ritonavir that was associated with an 8-fold increase 
in AUC of zanubrutinib. Mild CYP3A4 inhibitors did not affect zanubrutinib exposure substantially.  
CYP3A4 inducers were associated with a decrease in zanubrutinib exposure. As such, rifampicin (a 
strong inducer) was associated with a 93% decrease in exposure whereas carbamazepine and 
efavirenz were associated with a 60% reduction in exposure.   
PBPK simulations of esomeprazole indicate that acid-reducing agents such as proton-pump inhibitors 
do not significantly impact the PK of zanubrutinib. Predicted solubility of zanubrutinib in the stomach 
decreases from 0.25 to 0.13 with a gastric pH value change of 1.5 to 4.5. The predicted Cmax and AUC 
changes are within 3%. 
Zanubrutinib is primarily metabolised by CYP3A4. The clinical DDI study (study 104) showed a 4-fold 
increase in exposure when co-administered with itraconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor in agreement 
with the PBPK modelling. In the SmPC, the Applicant has proposed a dose reduction to 25% of 
 
recommended dose when co-administered with a strong CYP3A inhibitor and a dose reduction to 50% 
of recommended dose when co-administered with a moderate CYP3A inhibitor.  
The clinical DDI study showed a substantial decrease in zanubrutinib exposure when administered with 
a strong CYP3A4 inducer (rifampin). In the SmPC, the Applicant has stated that concomitant use of a 
strong CYP3A inducer should be avoided.  
Plasma concentrations of zanubrutinib were similar when administered with and without omeprazole, 
which is in agreement with the PBPK modelling. Hence, no dose adjustment is needed when 
administered with proton pump inhibitor.   
Zanubrutinib did not affect AUC or Cmax of warfarin and rosuvastatin, hence concomitant treatment 
with drugs metabolised by CYP2C9 or drugs using transporter protein BCRP is acceptable. 
With regards to midazolam (CYP3A substrate) and omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate), AUC of the drugs 
were reduced by 47% and 36 %. The AUC of digoxin (P-gp substrate) increased by 11%. Advice on 
concomitant treatment with narrow therapeutic index drugs metabolised by CYP3A and CYP2C19 are 
provided in the SmPC.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
 Pharmacodynamic (PD) analyses were performed in the Chinese phase 1 study BGB-3111-1002 and in 
the global phase 1/2 study BGB-3111-AU-003 based on PD data from 13 and 50 subjects, respectively. 
The primary PD endpoint was the BTK occupancy in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). 
Table 16: Clinical Pharmacology studies of zanubrutinib (BGB-3111) 
Mechanism of action 
Zanubrutinib (also known as BGB-3111) is a novel, second-generation oral BTK inhibitor that forms an 
irreversible covalent bond at Cys481 within the adenosine triphosphate binding pocket of the BTK 
protein. Zanubrutinib is more selective than ibrutinib (first-generation BTK inhibitor) for BTK inhibition 
with less off-target kinase inhibition, including less inhibition of EGFR, JAK3, HER2, TEC, inducible 
tyrosine kinase (ITK), and others, as evidenced in both kinase inhibition and cell-based assays.

Table 17  BTK Occupancy in PBMCs (Part 1) 
Table 18 BTK Occupancy in lymph nodes (Part 2) 
BTK occupancy in lymph nodes was > 80% in all samples evaluated, and the median BTK occupancy 
reached 94% in the 320 mg QD group (N=12) and 100% in the 160 mg BID group (n = 18, p = 
 
 
 
 
 
0.0189, Mann Whitney exact test). The proportion of patients with >90% occupancy was 94% (160mg 
BID) vs 58% (320mg QD). The figure clearly summarizes the PD data by different tumour types. Data 
is very limited, and the number of subjects / tumour type is very low. However, it is agreed that there 
was no apparent association of lymph node BTK occupancy and tumour types.    
MYD88 and CXCR4 mutation status define subgroups of Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia. The 
mutational status of the MYD88 and CXCR4 genes has been shown to predict responsiveness of 
ibrutinib in WM (Treon et al., 20151). For zanubrutinib, due to low number of samples available, no 
conclusion can be drawn on the effect of MYD88/CXCR4 mutational status on PD responses. In all of 
the available samples, BTK receptor occupancy is high in peripheral blood (85.33-100%) in line with 
the overall results. 
Currently, there are no PD data available to elucidate the potential for development of resistance to 
zanubrutinib treatment or cross-resistance after prior BTK inhibitor treatment.  
As regards the dosing of zanubrutinib, the Applicant proposes two different dosing regimens: 160 mg 
BID and 320 mg once daily. According to the presented data, the two different dosing strategies result 
in median BTK occupancy of 100% and 94% in lymph nodes at steady-state, respectively. A relevant 
difference in the clinical effect of the two dose regimens is not likely.   
Secondary pharmacology 
In study BGB-3111-106, the effect of zanubrutinib on ECG parameters was examined. The primary 
ECG endpoint was placebo-corrected change-from-baseline QT interval corrected for heart rate with 
Fridericia’s formula (ΔQTcF) and the secondary ECG endpoints included QTcF, heart rate, time from the 
beginning of the P-wave to the beginning of the next QRS complex (PR interval), and deflections in the 
tracing of the ECG comprising the Q, R, and S waves that represent depolarization of the ventricles 
(QRS intervals). Data were available from 28, 30, 28, and 27 subjects for zanubrutinib 160 mg, 
zanubrutinib 480 mg, placebo, and moxifloxacin 400 mg, respectively. 
The E-R analysis was based on placebo-corrected ΔQTcF (ΔΔQTcF). A small shortening of the QTc 
interval was observed on both doses of zanubrutinib and on placebo, with the expected level of QTc 
prolongation observed on active moxifloxacin treatment. The ΔΔQTcF was very small on both doses of 
zanubrutinib, with mean values ranging between –1.6 and –4.5 msec across all postdose timepoints 
without clear relation to dose or time of dosing (see below). The upper bound of the 90% CI of ∆∆QTcF 
of zanubrutinib did not exceed 1.2 msec at any postdose timepoint. Mean ΔΔQTcF on moxifloxacin was 
> 10 msec between 1 and 4 hours postdose, with a peak effect of 12.9 msec (90% CI: 10.71 to 15.02) 
observed at 2.5 hours postdose. There were no subjects with outlier values for QTcF values (ie, QTcF 
> 450 and ≤ 480 msec, > 480 and ≤ 500 msec, or > 500 msec when not present at baseline) in any 
treatment group. There were no subjects with outlier values for ΔQTcF (ie, QTcF change from baseline 
of > 30 and ≤ 60 msec or > 60 msec) for zanubrutinib or placebo groups.

Zanubrutinib did not have an effect on heart rate or cardiac conduction (ie, PR and QRS intervals).  
Mean placebo-corrected change-from-baseline heart rate (ΔΔHR) values for zanubrutinib were all 
smaller than ± 5 bpm with values ranging between –0.4 and –3.6 bpm on zanubrutinib 160 mg and 
between 0.7 bpm and -2.9 bpm on zanubrutinib 480 mg. Mean placebo-corrected 
change-from-baseline PR interval (ΔΔPR) was smaller than 5 msec across all timepoints after dosing 
with zanubrutinib. Mean placebo-corrected change-from-baseline QRS intervals (ΔΔQRS) were within 
± 1.0 msec at all postdose timepoints on both zanubrutinib doses. 
Concentration-QTc Analysis Results 
The relationship between the individual observed zanubrutinib concentrations and ΔΔQTcF was 
investigated using a linear mixed-effects modeling approach. In the concentration-QTc analysis using a 
linear model with an intercept, the slope of the relationship was not statistically significant 
(-0.001 msec per ng/mL [90% CI: –0.0058 to 0.0035]). Assay sensitivity was demonstrated by the 
moxifloxacin QT response. The predicted ΔΔQTcF at the geometric mean peak zanubrutinib 
concentrations after single oral doses of zanubrutinib 160 mg and 480 mg are –3.16 msec and –3.38 
msec, respectively.  
In summary, single oral doses of zanubrutinib 160 mg and 480 mg did not have a clinically relevant 
effect on ECG parameters, and an effect on the QTc interval exceeding 10 msec can be excluded within 
the observed plasma concentrations range.

Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
To support dose recommendations, exposure-response relationships for efficacy and safety were 
evaluated in patients with B-cell malignancies receiving zanubrutinib monotherapy in clinical studies.  
Exposure data (AUC0-24,ss, Cmax, or Cmin) derived from the population PK analysis (Report BGB-3111-CP-
008) were used in the analysis. Analyses were performed using data from all patients who had ≥ 1 set 
of the estimated PK parameters. Individual PK parameters from these studies were merged with the 
corresponding efficacy data from 2 studies (BGB-3111-AU-003 and BGB-3111-302) or safety data from 
5 studies (BGB-3111-AU-003 and BGB-3111-302, -206, -1002, and -205). 
Exposure-Efficacy Relationship  
Data from Study BGB-3111-AU-003 in patients with WM (n = 62) and BGB-3111-302 (n = 100) were 
included in the E-R analysis of efficacy outcomes. In Study BGB-3111-AU-003, zanubrutinib was 
administered orally as twice-a-day and once-a-day regimens (40 mg, 80 mg, 160 mg, and 320 mg 
once a day and 160 mg twice a day) as a starting dose. In Study BGB-3111-302, all patients received 
oral doses of zanubrutinib 160 mg twice a day.  
The efficacy in patients with WM was investigated with the responder group, including patients with 
best overall response of complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), or partial 
response (PR), and minimal response (MR); the nonresponder group included patients with best overall 
response of stable disease and progressive disease. A total of 162 patients with availability of both 
response data and PK data were included in the pooled analysis. These 162 patients included 100 
patients from BGB-3111-302 and 62 patients from BGB-3111-AU-003). 
Although a range of exposures was observed in both responders and nonresponders across the dose 
range of 40 mg to 320 mg, the median AUC0-24,ss and Cmax values appeared to be similar in responders 
(patients with major response rate [MRR]) compared with those of nonresponders . The median 
zanubrutinib Cmin values were also similar between responders and nonresponders. The probability of 
MRR by quantiles of zanubrutinib exposure is shown below. The probability of ORR by quantiles of 
zanubrutinib exposure is shown below. Overall, there was no apparent E-R relationship for 
zanubrutinib, based on response assessment of CR+VGPR, MRR, and ORR.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The PK of zanubrutinib was evaluated by modelling and simulation studies, in vitro studies and clinical 
pharmacology studies.  
Validated LC-MS/MS methods were used for quantification of zanubrutinib and other relevant 
compounds. The bioanalysis conducted in support of zanubrutinib clinical development is acceptable. 
Standard software and methodologies were applied for the pharmacokinetic data analysis of 
zanubrutinib.  
Population PK analyses were performed in NONMEM. The final Pop PK model for zanubrutinib was 
based on a previous 2-compartment model with an absorption depot. The old model was updated with 
additional data and data with non-linear kinetics (480 mg) was excluded, thus representing a dose 
range of 20-320 mg zanubrutinib. Health status and baseline ALT were identified as significant 
covariates of CL/F. A sensitivity analysis indicated that patients achieve lower zanubrutinib exposure 
than healthy subjects. The data for population PK analysis came from nine clinical studies, and 
included 90 healthy volunteers and 542 patients after data exclusions.  
C-QTc relations for zanubrutinib and the control moxifloxacin were both described by separate linear 
mixed-effects models. 
A PBPK model for zanubrutinib was created in Simcyp using in-vitro data, data from the human ADME 
study and clinical data obtained in healthy subjects and in patients in the dose range 20-320 mg QD 
zanubrutinib. The zanubrutinib model was used to predict the DDI potential for zanubrutinib as a victim 
co-administered with various inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 and to predict gastric effect on 
zanubrutinib absorption following increase of gastric pH from 1.5 to 4.5. The zanubrutinib model was 
also used to predict the DDI potential for zanubrutinib as a perpetrator when co-administered with 
CYP3A, CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 substrates. The predicted DDI effects were used to for dose 
recommendations in the SmPC Section 4.2 for concomitant moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors and moderate 
CYP3A4 inducers. The PBPK predictions of zanubrutinib dose adjustment in the presence of CYP3A 
inhibitors are supported. The predicted extent of CYP3A autoinduction was less than 15%. Ongoing 
Study BGB-3111-113 will confirm the proposed dose recommendations for zanubrutinib in the 
presence of moderate (fluconazole and diltiazem) and strong (clarithromycin and voriconazole) CYP3A 
inhibitors. PBPK simulations of zanubrutinib PK in the presence of moderate/mild CYP3A inducers was 
supported by data from clinical DDI study BGB-3111-112 with rifabutin.  
The PBPK model was used to predict the effect of zanubrutinib on CYP2B6 substrate bupropion, 
CYP2C8 substrates rosiglitatzone and repaglinide, and CYP3A4 substrate ethinylestradiol without 
clinical data. The simulations of CYP induction by zanubrutinib are not accepted for SmPC 
recommendations.  
The ADME study showed a rapid absorption with a Tmax of 2-4 hours and that a large proportion of the 
zanubrutinib was metabolised, mainly by CYP3A4, and excreted in faeces. The volume of distribution 
was 522 L and zanubrutinib was highly bound to plasma proteins. The clearance was 128 L/h.  
No dose dependency or time dependency were evident, however, lack of accumulation of metabolites 
needs to be clarified. Acrylic acid was one of the major metabolites. Formation of acrylic acid and 
further description of its metabolism should be provided.  
Food did not have a major impact on the absorption and in the SmPC it is stated that zanubrutinib can 
be administered with and without food.  
High inter- and intra-individual variability was seen, but the variability was lower after multiple dose 
compared with single dose. 
Renal impairment did not affect exposure to zanubrutinib, which is in line with the limited renal 
excretion. However only few individuals with severe renal impairment were included in the study, 
which is reflected in the SmPC.  
Zanubrutinib was mainly metabolised by liver enzymes and severe hepatic impairment was associated 
with increased exposure to zanubrutinib; in the SmPC it is stated that patients with severe hepatic 
impairment should be treated with zanubrutinib 80 mg x 2, which is half the recommended dose in 
patients with normal hepatic function. The parameters of Child-Pugh score that was associated with 
increased exposure to zanubrutinib are presented in the SmPC section 4.2. 
Gender, age, body weight and race did not have an impact on PK.  
With regards to drug-drug interaction, relevant in vitro, in silico and in vivo interaction studies have 
been conducted. The PBPK model showed a 3-4 fold increase in zanubrutinib AUC and Cmax when 
coadministered with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor, except for ritonavir that was associated 
with an 8-fold increase in AUC of zanubrutinib. A 4-fold increase in drug exposure when administered 
with a strong CYP3A inhibitor was supported by the in vivo DDI study. A 25% reduction in dose when 
co-administered with a strong CYP3A inhibitor and a 50% reduction with a moderate CYP3A inhibitor 
are proposed, which is considered acceptable. Strong and moderate inducers of CYP3A4 showed a 
substantial decrease in zanubrutinib exposure and concomitant treatment should be avoided, which is 
adequately reflected in the SmPC. DDI studies showed that zanubrutinib affected the exposure to 
drugs metabolised by CYP3A and CYP2C19 and substrates of p-gp. This is adequately reflected in the 
SmPC.   
Pharmacodynamics 
BTK occupancy is a pharmacodynamic marker of zanubrutinib treatment. In general, the median BTK 
receptor occupancy observed at doses from 40 mg to 360 mg per day is close to 100%.  
It is noted that the Applicant proposes two different dosing regimens: 160 mg BID and 320 mg once 
daily. According to the presented data, the two different posologies result in median BTK occupancy of 
100% and 94% in lymph nodes at steady-state, respectively. A relevant difference in the clinical effect 
of the two dose regimens is not likely.  
The effect of zanubrutinib at a therapeutic dose of 160 mg and a supratherapeutic dose of 480 mg on 
various ECG parameters was evaluated. C-QTc relations for zanubrutinib and the control moxifloxacin 
were both described by separate linear mixed-effects models. The study found no effect of the 
medication on any of the parameters examined, including heart rate, cardiac conduction (PR and 
QRS intervals), and placebo-corrected, baseline-corrected and heart rate–corrected QTc (ΔΔQTcF).  
The Applicant argues that the short half-life and lack of accumulation seen upon multiple dosing make 
the results applicable for steady-state conditions. This is agreed upon.   
For the evaluation of an exposure-efficacy relationship, AUC0-24,ss, Cmax, and Cmin were the exposure 
parameters, and complete response + very good partial response (CR+VGPR), major response rate 
(MRR), and objective response rate (ORR) were the efficacy parameters. Collectively, no apparent 
exposure-efficacy relationship was demonstrated between responders and nonresponders across a 
range of daily doses from 40 mg to 320 mg. By quantiles of zanubrutinib exposure, an increasing trend 
is observed for Cmax and MRR but this effect disappears when Cmax is compared with ORR.     
A total of 542 patients were included in the exposure-safety analyses. AUC0-24,ss, Cmax, and Cmin were 
the exposure parameters. In summary, E-R analyses showed no statistically significant relationship 
between steady-state PK exposure (Cmax, AUC0-24,ss, Cmin), MRR, and ORR. There was no evidence of E-
R relationships for adverse events of interests across dose levels from 40 mg to 320 mg. 
Overall, no association of an exposure-efficacy or exposure-safety relationship has been documented.  
The results of steady-state simulations were generally consistent with those after a single dose. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the pharmacology program of zanubrutinib is considered adequate for the evaluation of the PK 
and PD. 
To assess the drug-drug interaction between zanubrutinib and moderate (fluconazole, diltiazem) and 
strong (voriconazole, clarithromycin) CYP3A inhibitors in patients with B-cell malignancies. A Drug-
Drug Interaction Study of Zanubrutinib with Moderate/Strong CYP3A Inhibitors in Patients with B-Cell 
Malignancies Lymphoma will be submitted in the context of additional pharmacovigilance measures 
(see RMP). 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Dose-response was evaluated in a first-in-human phase 1/2, open-label, multiple-dose, dose escalation 
study (BGB-3111-AU-003). A total of 278 patients with B-Cell lymphoid malignancies were included, 
78 patients with WM. The study was a modified “3+3” dose escalation design (Part 1), in Part 2, 2 
dosing regimens were studied, 320 mg once daily or 160 mg twice daily. Part 2 was expanded to allow 
for further evaluation of efficacy and safety in multiple types of B-cell malignancies including WM, after 
dose-finding. The study population in Part 2 included patients in disease settings with limited treatment 
options. B-cell malignancies included a planned total of 295 patients diagnosed with chronic 
lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 
(DLBCL), hairy cell leukaemia (HCL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) or mucosa-associated lymphoid 
tissue (MALT)-lymphoma.

occupancy in lymph node biopsy specimens was assessed at baseline and pre-dose on W1D3 and calculated as 1 − 
([free BTK on day 3 pre-dose] × [total BTK at screening])/([free BTK at screening] × [total BTK on day 3 pre-
dose]). Median values are shown as lines through the individual triangles. DLBCL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma;

Published in (Tam et al, Blood 2019). 
The BTKi effect was demonstrable in a dose-related manner at cellular levels in peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells and in nodal tissue, including in samples from patients diagnosed with WM (Figure 
A).  The recommend daily standard dose of 160 mg zanubrutinib BID in WM is supported. 
The dose selection is mainly based on BGB-3111-AU-003, a Phase 1/2, open-label, multiple-dose, dose 
escalation and expansion study to investigate the safety and pharmacokinetics of the BTK inhibitor 
BGB-3111 in patients with B-cell lymphoid malignancies.

Supportive studies BGB-3111-AU-003 and -210 are single arm trials (Table 3.2.12). 
The Applicant has described the sequencing method used for detection of the MYD88 / CXCR4 mutation 
status. As also the inclusion of all patients, regardless of the mutation status has been justified, the 
methods will not be used for patient selection in clinical practice.  
Randomisation 
Based on MYD88 gene sequencing, patients were enrolled into either Cohort 1 (MYD88MUT) or Cohort 2 
(MYD88WILD-TYPE). Patients with either missing or inconclusive MYD88 gene sequencing results were 
assigned to Cohort 2 by default. Using the Interactive Response Technology system, Cohort 1 patients 
were randomized 1:1 to receive either zanubrutinib (Arm A) or ibrutinib (Arm B).  
Stratification factors included: 
  CXCR4 mutational status (CXCR4WHIM versus CXCR4WILD-TYPE versus missing) and  
 
the number of prior therapies for WM (0 versus 1-3 versus > 3).  
Cohort 2 patients were assigned to receive zanubrutinib (Arm C) by the Interactive Response 
Technology system. Cohort 1 stratified randomization and Cohort 2 assignment were performed 
centrally by the Interactive Response Technology system on or immediately before Cycle 1 Day 1. The 
time from patient randomization to study drug treatment initiation was ≤ 5 days.  
Blinding (masking) 
Study BGB-3111-302 was not blinded, due to differences in tablet / capsule dosing and size.  
Statistical methods 
Analysis Sets 
Cohort 1 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Analysis Set included all randomized patients assigned to a treatment arm in 
Cohort 1. 
The Relapsed/Refractory Analysis Set (a subset of the ITT Analysis Set) included all randomized 
patients with at least 1 prior line of therapy. This will be the primary analysis set used for efficacy 
analyses for Cohort 1. 
The Per-Protocol Analysis Set included patients in the ITT Analysis Set who met the following criteria: 
• Received any dose of randomized treatment regimen 
• Had a valid post-baseline measurement for either IgM (central or local) or M-protein by serum 
protein electrophoresis assessment (central or local) 
• Did not have any important protocol deviation 
The Per-Protocol Relapsed/Refractory Analysis Set included patients in the Relapsed/Refractory 
Analysis Set who met the above criteria. Criteria for exclusion from the Per-Protocol Analysis Set were 
determined and documented before the database lock for the primary analysis.  
Cohort 2 
The Efficacy Analysis Set in Cohort 2 included all patients who received any dose of zanubrutinib and 
were centrally confirmed to have MYD88WT. 
Primary endpoint VGPR/CR rate  
 
 
 
 
The superiority of the primary endpoint of VGPR/CR rate will be tested using the Cochran-Mantel-
Haenszel (CMH) test, stratified by the CXCR4 status (WHIM vs WT/missing), the prior line of therapy 
(1-3 vs. >3 for analyses in the Relapsed/Refractory Analysis Set; 0 vs 1-3 vs >3 for analyses in the 
ITT Analysis Set) and age group (<=65 vs >65) at a 1-sided significance level of 0.025. If the 1-sided 
p-value is less than 0.025, it will be concluded that the VGPR/CR rate in zanubrutinib is greater than 
the VGPR/CR rate in ibrutinib and that the primary objective is met. 
The 95% confidence interval (CI) for the Mantel-Haenszel common risk difference (Mantel-Haenszel, 
1959) will be constructed using a normal approximation and Sato’s standard error (Sato 1989) 
stratified by the CXCR4 status (WHIM vs WT/missing), the prior line of therapy (1- 3 vs. >3 for 
analyses in the Relapsed/Refractory Analysis Set; 0 vs 1-3 vs >3 for analyses in the ITT Analysis Set) 
and age group (<=65 vs >65). 
For the primary endpoint of VGPR/CR rate, an unstratified analysis will also be performed. 
The primary endpoint VGPR/CR rate and key secondary endpoint MRR were, as mentioned above, 
analysed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by the CXCR4 status (WHIM vs 
WT/missing), the prior line of therapy (1-3 vs. >3 for analyses in the Relapsed/Refractory Analysis 
Set; 0 vs 1-3 vs >3 for analyses in the ITT Analysis Set) and age group (≤65 vs >65). For the primary 
endpoint, an unstratified analysis was planned as sensitivity analysis. For CR or VGPR rate, MRR, and 
ORR, subjects with missing response assessment will be considered non-responders. While VGRP/CR 
will be tested for superiority, the MRR will be tested for non-inferiority. The non-inferiority margin 
(NIM) was changed from 8 % (stated in the protocol v5 dated 26 Aug 2019) to 12 % (stated in the 
SAP v1 dated 18 Oct 2019). The Applicant explained in the SAP that the NIM of 12% is proposed 
assuming 83% of the ibrutinib benefit over a placebo is retained. With 83% of the ibrutinib effect 
preserved, the 12% NI margin in MRR is statistically justified. For the response definitions, please see 
Table X, previously.  
PFS and DOR were secondary endpoints not adjusted for multiplicity. The Kaplan-Meier method was 
used to describe the data. PFS and DOR were right-censored for subjects who meet one of the 
following conditions: 1) no baseline disease assessments; 2) starting a new anti-cancer therapy before 
PD or death; 3) PD or death immediately after more than 6 months since the last disease assessment 
(more than 12 months if a subject is on the response assessment schedule of every 24 weeks); and 4) 
alive without documentation of PD. 
The use of CMH test to compare the proportion of responders is endorsed. It is noted that age is used 
in the analysis despite not being included as stratification factor. This change was introduced in the 
SAP and an explanation from this change was not found. While it is understood that age is an 
important risk factor, this should have been adjusted for already in the design stage.  
Key secondary endpoint: Major Response Rate 
The major response rate (MRR) by IRC, defined as the proportion of subjects achieving CR, VGPR, and 
PR, will be tested for noninferiority of zanubrutinib compared to ibrutinib. The null and alternative 
hypotheses of MRR are set as follows: 
H0: MRRA-MRRB ≤ -12% 
Ha: MRRA- MRRB > -12%, 
 
 
 
where MRRA is the major response rate in zanubrutinib and MRRB is the major response rate in 
ibrutinib. The 95% confidence interval (CI) for the Mantel-Haenszel common risk difference (Mantel-
Haenszel, 1959) will be constructed with normal approximation and standard error based on Sato 
(1989) with strata CXCR4 status (WHIM vs WT/missing), prior line of therapy (1-3 vs. >3 for 
Relapsed/Refractory analysis set analysis and 0 vs 1-3 vs >3 in ITT analysis) and age group (<=65 vs 
>65). If the lower bound of the CI is greater than the non-inferiority margin of -12%, the null 
hypothesis will be rejected, and it can be concluded that the MRR in zanubrutinib is noninferior to the 
MRR in ibrutinib. In addition, as a sensitivity analysis, the Mantel-Haenszel common risk difference will 
also be estimated using the null variance estimator (Klingenberg, 2013). 
If the lower bound of the CI is greater than 0, superiority is significant at the nominal level of 0.025 
(1-sided). The superiority test of MRR is not included in the multiplicity adjustment for the study-wide 
type-I error (Figure 2). 
As a sensitivity analysis, non-inferiority for MRR will be also tested in the per-protocol analysis set 
corresponding to the analysis set for which non-inferiority is significant.  
MRR and the Clopper-Pearson 95% confidence interval (CI) will be reported for each arm. 
Justification of the non-inferiority margin for MRR as described in the SAP 
The same non-inferiority margin will be used for both ITT and Relapsed/Refractory analysis sets. 
The NIM for the key secondary endpoint was increased from 8 % to 12 % in the SAP. The change of 
the non-inferiority margin (NIM) for MRR from -8% to -12% in the final SAP was based on emerging 
ibrutinib efficacy data indicating that the original MRR may have been underestimated. The ibrutinib 
effect over placebo was re-estimated from 60% to 75% based on the meta-analysis of the results from 
3 Phase 2 studies including two new study results published after the determination of initial NIM 
(Treon et al, 2015a; Dimopoulos et al, 2017; Treon et al, 2018.) The revised NIM of 12% was 
determined by requiring 83% of the ibrutinib effect over placebo to declare NI.  The same NIM was 
applied to the non-inferiority tests for both RR and ITT populations. No data/information from study 
BGB-3111-302 was used in this update.  
An increase in MRR (CR+VGP+PR by IRC) of 12% in comparison with another BTKi, which has proven 
efficacy, is clinically meaningful if achieved and may be durable due to a continuous treatment in WM. 
The MRR reflects that all parameters in the response definition of IgM-protein, extramedullary disease, 
bone marrow function) are improved, or not worsened. It is likely that an increase in MRR also requires 
a longer treatment (from 12 to 15 months), an association which may be observed with kinase 
inhibitors that still more slow responses can be achieved. The response-definitions also state 
progressive disease in an objective way as: ≥25% increase in serum IgM from lowest nadir (requires 
confirmation) and/or progression in clinical features attributable the disease.

Subgroup assessments of VGPR/CR rate 
The proportions of patients in Cohort 1 who achieved a VGPR or CR per overall combined assessment 
were generally consistent for subgroups of interest with a few exceptions in mostly small subgroups. 
Zanubrutinib treatment was favoured in patients ≤ 75 years and in prognostically more difficult to 
treat patients such as those with higher IgM (≥ 40 g/L), cytopenias (e.g., haemoglobin concentration 
≤ 110 g/L, and patients with baseline platelet count ≤ 100 x 109/L), extramedullary disease, and 
medium/high international prognostic scoring system (IPSS) scores. In terms of geographic location, 
patients from Australia or New Zealand fared better and patients from North America fared worse with 
zanubrutinib, albeit with low numbers of patient enrolled in North America (figure below).

Duration of response (DOR) 
In Cohort 1, the median durations of VGPR or CR and major response per overall combined assessment 
had not been reached, in either treatment arm. Three patients (15%) had progressive disease in 
ibrutinib treatment, compared to 1 (3.4%), and one patient died during ibrutinib (5.3%) treatment, no 
one during zanubrutinib (Table 30, CSR 302). The differences may indicate a trend. However, the 
median follow-up time in months was very different. The Applicant was invited to clarify the follow-up 
time in months (median value, 95% CI) of 0.0 (0.0, 2.7) in TN ibrutinib group, compared 15.5 (0.0, 
21.8) in TN zanubrutinib, which is comparable to 12-13 months in the RR patient population (Table 30, 
CSR 302). The Applicant clarified, that the short follow up for patients with VGPR in the ibrutinib arm 
compared to the zanubrutinib arm was due to the response occurring just prior to cutoff. One-year 
updated data shows longer duration of response for both arms although clearly longer for the 
zanubrutinib arm compared to the ibrutinib arm (27.4 months vs 13.8 months, respectively for TN 
patients and 23.0 months vs 16.6 months, respectively for RR patients). Although the number of 
responders is small, the difference in time to VGPR/CR suggests that TN zanubrutinib patients reached 
VGPR earlier, i.e., median (min, max) of 5.55 (4.6, 22.2) months, compared to TN ibrutinib patients, 
i.e. median (min, max) of 22.11 (16.9, 24.9). Consequently, the follow-up times for VGPR/CR in 
zanubrutinib patients are longer.

(Cohort 1) (ITT Analysis Set)
PFS 
In Cohort 1, the median PFS had not been reached in overall, treatment-naive, or relapsed/refractory 
patients in either treatment arm. 
 
 
The event-free rates at 12 months for patients overall in the ibrutinib and zanubrutinib treatment arms 
per overall combined assessment were 87.2% versus 89.7%, respectively, and 83.8% versus 85.0% 
at 18 months. 
The event-free rates at 12 months for relapsed/refractory patients in the ibrutinib and zanubrutinib 
treatment arms per overall combined assessment were 85.9% versus 92.4%, respectively, and 81.7% 
versus 85.9% at 18 months. 
Based on an updated data cut-off the progression free-survival event-free rate by investigator 
assessment was 77.6% vs 84.9% at 30 months (ibrutinib vs zanubrutinib), with an estimated overall 
hazard ratio of 0.734 (95% CI: 0.380, 1.415).

Assesment ( Cohort 1 ) (ITT Analysis Set) 
Time to response (TTR) 
In the patients overall in Cohort 1, the median times to VGPR or CR per overall combined assessment 
were faster in the zanubrutinib arm, with 7.39 months and 4.80 months in the ibrutinib and 
zanubrutinib treatment arms, respectively. Conversely, time to major response and overall response 
were similar between arms: 2.83 months for both treatment arms for major response and 0.99 months 
and 1.02 months to overall response, for ibrutinib and zanubrutinib respectively. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In Cohort 2, the median times to VGPR or CR, major response, and overall response per overall 
combined assessment in patients overall were 5.65, 2.89, and 0.99 months, respectively. The median 
times to VGPR or CR, major response, and overall response were generally similar in zanubrutinib-
treated patients in Cohort 1 compared with Cohort 2.

Time to treatment Failure (TTTF) 
On Study BGB-3111-302, zanubrutinib was found to have a longer time to treatment failure due to AE, 
defined as discontinuing of therapy for any AE, than ibrutinib with over 10% difference at 30 months. 
The 12 months AE failure-free rates for patients in the zanubrutinib and ibrutinib treatment arms were 
97.9% versus 92.4% respectively, at 24 months 95.6% versus 85.4% and at 30 months 94.3% versus 
82.9%.

Title: A Phase 3, Randomized, Open-Label, Multicentre Study Comparing the Efficacy and Safety of the 
Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) Inhibitors BGB-3111 and Ibrutinib in Subjects with Waldenström’s 
Macroglobulinemia (WM) 
Study identifier 
BGB-3111-302 
EudraCT No.: 2016-002980-33 
Design 
This is an ongoing, Phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicentre study to compare 
the efficacy and safety of zanubrutinib and ibrutinib in patients with WM who required 
therapy according to the consensus panel criteria from the IWWM-7 (Dimopoulos et al 
2014).   
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Duration of main phase: 
Subjects received daily treatment during the study 
until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity or 
death, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, or 
study termination by the Sponsor 
Duration of Run-in phase:  
Screening: Up to 35 days 
Duration of Extension phase: 
Safety Follow-up: All subjects who discontinued study 
drug and agreed to a follow-up visit had a safety 
follow-up visit approximately 30 days after the last 
dose of study drug. 
Efficacy Follow-up: Subjects who were discontinued 
from study drug for any reason other than 
progressive disease were followed every 12 weeks 
(±14 days) until disease progression, withdrawal of 
consent, death, lost to follow-up, end of study or 
study termination by sponsor, whichever occurred 
first.  
Survival Follow-up: Subjects will be followed for 
survival and further anticancer therapy information 
post progression via phone contact (with the 
subject’s guardian, if applicable) every 12 weeks 
(±14 days) until study end. 
Hypothesis 
•  Key Secondary endpoint (MRR by IRC): Non-inferiority under the margin of -12% 
• 
Primary endpoint (VGPR or CR rate by independent review committee [IRC]): 
Superiority of zanubrutinib to ibrutinib; 
(the secondary endpoints would be tested only if the primary endpoint is 
significant).

Notes 
The testing for the primary endpoint of VGPR or CR rate superiority required testing 
in the R/R Analysis Set prior to testing in the ITT Analysis Set. While numerically 
higher rates of VGPR or CR in zanubrutinib arm were seen across analysis sets, the 
primary endpoint was not significant in the Relapsed/Refractory Analysis Set (2-sided 
p=0.1160). Therefore, testing for all subsequent endpoints and resulting p-values are 
descriptive.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
In support of the application the Sponsor submitted data on one phase 3, randomized, open-label, 
worldwide, multicenter study BGB-3111-302 ASPEN, designed to compare the efficacy and safety of 
2nd generation BTKi zanubrutinib and ibrutinib in patients with Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia 
(WM) who required therapy in first (treatment naïve, TN n=42) or later lines (relapsed / refractory, RR 
n=187). To further support the applied indication the Applicant presents results of a phase 1/2 study 
BGB-3111-AU-003, an open-label, multiple-dose, multicenter, dose-escalation (Part 1), and dose-
expansion (Part 2) study designed to investigate the safety and PK of zanubrutinib in patients with B-
cell malignancies in the single arm study of part 2 (n=73 patients with TN and RR WM).  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The target population was enrolled according to rational and reasoned detailed criteria, accepting 
treatment naïve (TN) and relapsed / refractory (RR) adult patients, without an upper age limit. The 
term TN patients “unsuitable” for treatment with a standard chemo-immunotherapy reflects a practice 
in real-world, when the specialist decides the optimal, individual choice of treatment according to co-
morbidity and adhering to the treatment algorithms, including enrolment in a clinical trial (Kastritis et 
al, ESMO Ann Oncol 2018). The term may be considered to be unspecific, however it is accepted in 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
exactly the same wording for the comparator ibrutinib. The patient population is representative for WM 
by epidemiologic factors and reflecting the characteristic clinical and para-clinical manifestations, 
including phenotypic differences related to the genotypes of MYD88 and CXCR4 (Hunter at al, J Clin 
Oncol 2017). The Applicant has provided a list of patients screened and not included; no single 
reason(s) prevailed.  
The starting dose was selected to be 160 mg zanubrutinib monotherapy BID. The therapy continues 
until intolerance or insufficient effect and disease progression. Dose adjustments are planned in case of 
adverse events, which often causes cytopenia, like other TKIs in haematology. The patients required 
therapy in first (TN n=42) or later lines (RR n=187). The TN and RR patients were further divided in 
MYD88L265Pmutated (typical, n=37 and 164) or MYD88wild-type WM (n=5 and 23), respectively. RR 
patients had a median of 1 prior treatment, some patients were heavily pretreated and time from 
diagnosis was 4.6 years (median). Indication for treatment was in accordance to IWWM standards 
(Dimopoulos et al, Blood 2014) and ESMO recommendations (Kastritis et al, Ann Oncol 2018). 
As the comparator in the phase 3 study, ibrutinib was chosen, since it was approved for the treatment 
of WM in adults with WM from diagnosis. This “perfect match” in indication of the BTKi ibrutinib in WM 
further justifies the RCT design of the pivotal ASPEN study, reflected in a successful randomization. 
Because both BTKi are for oral treatment, but different in dose, formulation and administration, it is 
accepted to conduct an open-label study. It is important that the primary endpoint according to the 
international, objective standards (Owen et al, Br J Haematol 2013) of a very good partial response 
(VGPR) and/or complete response (CR), was assessed by an IRC. Secondary endpoints include the 
major response rate (MRR), which is a partial response, and better – an endpoint accepted with 
ibrutinib in WM.   
In the original protocol (version 1.0 29 July 2016) the primary endpoint was MRR. However, after 
consulting the SAWP the primary endpoint was changed to CR/VGPR and MRR was now a secondary 
endpoint. In the scientific advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/636729/2016) there is no indication for testing for 
NI.  According to the CHMP scientific advice theoretically, ORR would be the preferred primary 
endpoint. However, WM is a rare disease, and powering such a study for non-inferiority or for 
superiority given a projected ORR of almost 90% for ibrutinib would be a challenge. In this context, a 
primary comparison of MRR could be an acceptable way of demonstrating that BGB-3111 is at least 
similarly effective, if supported by an ORR rate that is not distinctly lower than for ibrutinib, and 
perhaps by secondary endpoints indicating a higher frequency of deeper responses. 
In protocol version 2 (version 2.0, 01_November 2016) the Applicant introduces the non-inferiority 
margin and the NI testing. CR/VGPR and MRR will be tested sequentially to control the type I error in 
the primary and key secondary endpoint. Non-inferiority test of MRR will be performed with the 
possibility of demonstrating superiority if the lower bound for 95% CI of MRR rate is above zero.  
In the Amendment 3, the total number of patients was increased to approximately 210 patients and 
the timing of the primary analysis was changed from 9 months to 12 months; both changes based on 
FDA feedback.  
The originally proposed primary efficacy endpoint (MMR, including patients with PR, VGPR and CR) was 
changed to secondary efficacy endpoint and the originally planned superiority testing changed to non-
inferiority during the study. Considering all clinical endpoints, the results are consistent (see discussion 
further below), and therefore further justification for the chosen endpoint, success criteria or testing 
strategy, was not pursued. Given the above methodological considerations, and despite the choices 
made by the Applicant with regards to the primary endpoint and the statistical analysis plan, it is worth 
revisiting the ibrutinib dossier (study 1118B) that established efficacy in WM based on a SAT with 63 
patients, of which only 7 patients were MYD88 wt. The primary endpoint was ORR, and showed a rate 
of 87.3%, and a VGPR of 14.3%. 
Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma is driven by a combination of aberrant cell control systems. In 
particular, the MYD88 gene is mutated (L265P) in 95% of patients, and the impact is also influenced by 
e.g. mutational status of CXCR4, which is relevant to take into consideration, treating with BTKi.  The 
sample size calculation in the main study is endorsed, randomizing 1:1 to zanubrutinib (n=102) or 
ibrutinib (n=99). Stratification factors included mutational status (CXCR4WHIM versus CXCR4wild-type 
versus missing) and the number of prior therapies for WM (0 versus 1-3 versus > 3) in Cohort 1, all 
un-mutated MYD88 status. Cohort 2 patients in the main study were identified by MYD88wild-type and all 
treated with zanubrutinib only (n=5 TN and 23 RR WM). The study design is supported, because effect 
of BTKi treatment is reported to be related to mutational status as a targeted therapy, and prior 
therapies – but not age as a stratification factor. Age critically influenced treatment selection in WM, 
however in a trial context age per se is reflected by the clinical assessment before enrolment.   
In all, 5 amendments (65 major changes) were made during the conduct of the main study. The 
changes in the protocol were not considered to have had an impact on study outcome and endpoints.  
Patients in the phase 1/2 AU-003 study were enrolled according to the same criteria, TN (n=24) and 
RR (n=49), shows a compatible demographic profile. Some patients were treated with a 320 mg QD 
dose, instead of 160mg BID. The impact on efficacy of the two doses is most likely minimal, and 
results may be interpreted to assess responses, with caution.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Results on efficacy in the phase 1/2 AU/-003 and phase 3 -302 study show a clinically relevant effect 
of zanubrutinib in both TN and RR WM, achieving a VGPR in 25-30%, the primary endpoint, and across 
all clinically relevant subgroups by Forest plots. No patient in the main study achieved a CR, which is a 
usual outcome in all WM (ESMO), reflecting  that BTKi as monotherapy,  in both TN and RR, has an 
impact on important signaling pathways influenced by the mutations, but not all key drivers. A trend 
towards a higher VGPR was noticed in both TN and RR patients, in general ibrutinib 20% and 
zanubrutinib 28% (primary endpoint), but not in the secondary endpoint MRR of 75-80%, overall. 
Per the protocol and the SAP, the Applicant would test the secondary endpoint MRR according to a pre-
planned NIM, if the study met its primary endpoint. However, since the study failed to show superiority 
with regards to the primary endpoint, MRR could not formally be tested for NI.  Nonetheless, the risk 
difference for MRR was -0.5% (95%CI; -12.2, 11.1) and thus well within the NIM of 12%. Had the 
Applicant included more patients in the study, the 95%CI would have been narrower, and thus within 
the +/- 12%. This clearly reflects the fact that WM is a rare disease.  
The progression free survival and the duration of response is of key importance in daily treatment in 
an elderly population. It is valuable that BTKi therapy showed a satisfactory 80% at 24 months in both 
time-dependent endpoints, although equal in both treatment Arms (Cohort 1).  Results in the AU-003 
study indicate that the response is slowly declining in the next 24 months to 70%, which is acceptable 
and still clinically relevant. In study 302 prior treatment was registered in all patients. Quite a high 
number of patients, although comparable between arms, did not have a known PD date ahead of the 
study.   
Mutational status has an impact on response to BTKi (Treon et al, Hemasphere 2020). Nineteen WHIM 
mutated patients were observed in Cohort 1, and the results indicate BTKi to be less effective than in 
CXCR4 un-mutated subjects, as expected. However, no significant difference in efficacy were indicated 
according to MYD88 mutational status (or BTKi), expecting MYD88WILD-TYPE to be less sensitive. Given 
the similar VGPR rate for zanubrutinib in MYD88MUT and MYD88WT, and the higher rate compared to 
 
ibrutinib in Cohort 1, it is agreed that this suggests that zanubrutinib may be a good therapeutic option 
for patients with Waldenström macroglobulinemia independent of MYD88 mutational status. 
A major response was achieved in 75-80% of patients, irrespective of randomization to zanubrutinib or 
ibrutinib, and in both Cohort 1 (MYD88MUT or Cohort 2WILD-TYPE, TN or RR, which by itself is satisfactory, 
albeit it is considered to be different from SOC with chemo-immunotherapy. The major response on 
resolutions of symptoms (hyperviscosity, severe anaemia, IgM tissue deposition dependent 
manifestations, like neuropathy, cryoglobulinaemia, night-sweats etc) is considered to be clinically very 
meaningful. 
A significant difference is noticed in the follow-up time in months (median value, 95% CI) of 0.0 (0.0, 
2.7) in TN ibrutinib group, compared with 15.5 (0.0, 21.8) in TN zanubrutinib, which is comparable to 
12-13 months in the RR patient population; the short follow up for patients with VGPR in the ibrutinib 
arm compared to the zanubrutinib arm was due to the response occurring just prior to cutoff. One-year 
updated data shows longer duration of response for both arms although clearly longer for the 
zanubrutinib arm compared to the ibrutinib arm (27.4 months vs 13.8 months, respectively for TN 
patients and 23.0 months vs 16.6 months, respectively for RR patients). Although the number of 
responders is small, the difference in time to VGPR/CR suggests that TN zanubrutinib patients reached 
VGPR earlier, i.e., median (min, max) of 5.55 (4.6, 22.2) months, compared to TN ibrutinib patients, 
i.e. median (min, max) of 22.11 (16.9, 24.9). Consequently, the follow-up times for VGPR/CR in 
zanubrutinib patients are longer. 
The median time to response (VGPR) was 7 months (Cohort 2). The effect is considered to be 
comparable between the two BTKi and indicate that treatment is not ameliorating symptoms from the 
first day in most patients. The steady response also means that BTKi monotherapy does not alleviate 
the need for e.g. plasmapheresis in aggressive WM disease, and has to be combined in subjects with 
severe rheological and autoimmune phenomena, which is relatively frequent in patients in need of 
treatment.  
The CHMP concluded that this single pivotal study provided sufficient evidence to establish efficacy and 
safety of ibrutinib in both MYD88-mutated and MYD88-wt patient in both the R/R setting and in first-
line in patients unsuitable for chemo-immunotherapy. In comparison, the Applicant has provided a 
head-to-head comparison in a phase 3 study, supported by further data from a phase 1/2 study. In 
total 201 patients were randomized 1:1. The result by IRC shows CR/VGPR in the ibrutinib arm around 
19%, which is in line with the observations made in study 1118B. A CR/VGPR of 28% is observed in 
the zanubrutinib arm. With regards to MRR the IRC concluded 77.8% vs. 77.5% in ibrutinib and 
zanubrutinib respectively.  
The results in Study AU-003 overall support the data in the pivotal study 302, across line of therapy, 
sub-group analysis and response criteria, although with the caveat that patients had received either 
320 mg zanubrutinib QD or zanubrutinib 160 mg BID.  
The median OS was not reached, as expected in Studies with a follow-up up to 4-5 years in WM. A 
sub-group was planned in the supportive study AU-003 to examine the effect of zanubrutinib on 
patients previously treated with a BTKi for WM (Cohort m, 20 patients). However, only 1 patient 
among 54 RR WM patients had received ibrutinib. Given that the addition of cohort m was done late in 
the course of Study BGB-3111-AU-003 and the cohort failed to enroll a significant number of patients, 
it is not possible to evaluate the efficacy of zanubrutinib in patients previously treated with a BTKi 
using this study.  
 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy of the 2nd generation BTKi zanubrutinib is clearly shown in WM, across treatment and disease 
status, all relevant information has been included in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The main safety information is derived from the phase 3 study 302 conducted in a Western population 
only.  
Furthermore, safety is evaluated in study BGB-3111-AU-003: “A first-in-human, Phase 1/2, dose-
selection, PK/PD, safety, and efficacy study in adult patients with relapsed/refractory or treatment-
naïve B-cell malignancies conducted in Australia, New Zealand, Italy, South Korea, United Kingdom 
(UK), and USA (N = 385). This study includes 78 patients with relapsed/refractory (n=54) or 
treatment-naïve (n=24) WM. 
Patient exposure 
In the pivotal Study BGB-3111-302 Cohort 1, the median duration of exposure was 18.55 months and 
18.73 months for patients in the ibrutinib and zanubrutinib treatment arms, respectively; 84% and 
89% of patients had a minimum exposure of 12 months. The total exposure (in patient months) was 
1706.58 and 1836.62, respectively, in the ibrutinib- and zanubrutinib-treated arms. Median relative 
dose intensities for patients in the ibrutinib and zanubrutinib arms were 98.18% (range: 51.6% to 
100.0%) and 97.64% (range: 29.0% to 100.0%), respectively. Twenty-one (21.4%) and 15 (14.9%) 
patients in the ibrutinib and zanubrutinib arms respectively, required 1 or more dose reductions. 
In addition to the pivotal 302 study, data from the supportive study BGB-3111-AU-003: “A first-in-
human, Phase 1/2, dose-selection, PK/PD, safety, and efficacy study in adult patients with 
relapsed/refractory or treatment-naïve B-cell malignancies conducted in Australia, New Zealand, Italy, 
South Korea, United Kingdom (UK), and USA (N = 385) are included. This study includes 78 patients 
with relapsed/refractory (n=54) or treatment-naïve (n=24) WM. This supportive study is ongoing and 
contributes PK, PD, efficacy, and safety data to this submission, with a median follow-up of 31.5 
months.” This study is included in the All WM group (n=253), which also includes 44 R/R WM Chinese 
patients and the entire study 302 (Cohort 1; 101 patients and Cohort 2; 28 patients) so that study 302 
constitutes 50% of the All WM population.  
In the following the adverse events from study 302, Cohort 1, will also be compared to the WM 
patients from study AU-003. 
The Applicant was further asked to provide an updated safety analysis based on pivotal study data and 
data derived from all patients with WM.  The updated exposure data for the All Zanubrutinib population 
(n=779), which contains a variety of B-cell malignancies, demonstrate a mean and median durations 
of exposure of 26.81 months and 30.32 months, respectively equating to 20884.73 patient-months 
(1,740 patient-years) of follow-up.  
Subjects who have MY88 wild type (MYD88WT) constituted the zanubrutinib treated cohort 2 (in study 
BGB-3111-302).   
 
 
Adverse events 
Table 38 Overview of adverse events in Study 302: Cohort 1 : Safety analysis set 
Treatment-emergent adverse events 
In the SOC “Infections and Infestations” the incidence is 67.3% in the ibrutinib arm vs 66.3% for 
zanubrutinib; a marked difference was the PT for pneumonia (12.2% and 2%, respectively). In the 12 
months safety update the incidence is higher but still comparable between arms.  
There were generally more infections in study AU-003 by SOC within the PT Pneumonia; similar to the 
zanubrutinib arm in study 302 whereas the incidence of Lower respiratory infection was comparable to 
the ibrutinib arm. Comparing the added incidences of the two terms Lower respiratory tract infection 
and Pneumonia the incidence is still higher in the ibrutinib arm compared to the zanubrutinib arm in 
study 302; 21.4% vs 9.9%, respectively. 
In Study BGB-3111-302, Cohort 1, the incidence of diarrhoea among zanubrutinib recipients was half 
that of ibrutinib recipients on an exposure-adjusted basis (1.3 and 2.6 persons/100 person-years, 
respectively).  
The frequency of atrial fibrillation was lower in the zanubrutinib group than in the ibrutinib group (BGB 
3111-302, 2 % and 15.3 %, respectively).   
In the below table difference between the two arms in study 302, Cohort 1, greater than 10% is 
marked in bold.

Patients in Either Overall Arm (Cohort 1) (Safety Analysis Set) 
 
 
 
 
Table 40 
Grade 3 and higher adverse events 
Pneumonia ≥ Grade 3 was seen more frequently in the ibrutinib arm compared to the zanubrutinib arm 
[7 (7.1%) versus 1 (1.0%)]. For the entire SOC ≥ Grade 3 Infections and Infestations the difference 
between the two arms was much smaller (19.4% vs 17.8%). Comparing the added incidences of the 
three terms Lower respiratory infection, Lung infection, and Pneumonia the difference between the 
ibrutinib arm and the zanubrutinib arm in study 302 becomes smaller: 7.1% vs 4.0%, respectively.  
Grade 3 and higher hypertension, were seen more frequently in the ibrutinib arm compared to the 
zanubrutinib arm (11.2% versus 5.9%, respectively). Looking at the All Zanubrutinib (N=779), All 
Non-China (N=514), and study AU-003 (N=78) the incidences were comparable to or lower than in 
study 302 for zanubrutinib.  
Only 1 patient experienced diarrhoea as ≥ Grade 3.

Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Adverse events of special interest are those that are known to be associated with the class of BTK 
inhibitors. The search criteria defining events within each category of AEs of special interest are 
detailed below. 
Table 42 Criteria for Adverse Events of Special interest  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Haemorrhage 
In Study BGB-3111-302 Cohort 1, the incidence of haemorrhage of any grade was 59.5% among 
ibrutinib-treated patients compared to 48.5% in the zanubrutinib-treated patients and exposure-
adjusted incidence rates (EAIR) (6.95 versus 4.43 persons/100 person-months). Of these 10 (of 58 
patients) (10.2%) and 6 (of 49 patients) (5.9%) ibrutinib- and zanubrutinib-treated patients, 
respectively, had antecedent thrombocytopenia and 14 (14.3%) and 12 (11.9%), respectively, 
reported the use of antithrombotic medication.   
Most haemorrhage events in both arms were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. Grade 3 or higher haemorrhage 
was reported for 8 ibrutinib-treated patients and 6 zanubrutinib-treated patients and SAEs were 
reported in 6 and 5 patients, respectively. No events of haemorrhage in either arm led to death.  
In the All Zanubrutinib and All WM patient groups, haemorrhage of any severity grade was similar 
among patients in terms of overall crude incidence (52.8% and 52.2%, respectively), EAIRs (5.30 and 
4.70 persons/100 person-months, respectively). Major bleeding events were uncommon in both 
patient groups (0.20 and 0.27 persons/100 person-months for the All Zanubrutinib and All WM patient 
 
groups, respectively), and events that met the criteria for seriousness occurred in 3.1% and 4.3% of 
patients, respectively. The EAIR for ≥ Grade 3 haemorrhage was 0.18 patients/100 person-months. 
Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter 
In the pivotal study 302, the incidence of atrial fibrillation (Afli) / flutter was higher in the ibrutinib arm 
(15.3%) compared to the zanubrutinib arm (2.0%), (EAIR 0.96 persons/100 person-months ibrutinib 
versus 0.11 persons/100 person-months zanubrutinib). In the ibrutinib arm, 3/8 with a history of Afli 
compared to 0/10 in the zanubrutinib arm relapsed during treatment.  
The incidence of Afli was higher in the supportive phase 1/2 study AU-003 (5.1% in the WM cohort) 
compared to study 302 (2.0%); the total number of patients is small, though (4/78 WM patients, and 
14/385=3.6% in the entire study).  
Hypertension 
In Study BGB-3111-302 Cohort 1, the incidence of hypertension was higher among ibrutinib-treated 
patients (17.3%) compared with zanubrutinib-treated patients (10.9%) despite the fact that there 
were more patients with prior hypertension in the ibrutinib arm (43.9%) compared to the zanubrutinib 
arm (37.6%).  
In the supportive phase 1/2 study AU-003 (Western population) the incidence of hypertension in the 
WM population was higher with 12/78 (15.4%) all-grade hypertension; this despite the fact that only 2 
patients had a history of hypertension. ≥Grade 3 hypertension was seen in 3/78 (3.8%) patients.  
Second primary malignancies 
In the pivotal study 302, Cohort 1, the incidences of second primary malignancies (and the 
subpopulation of various skin cancers excluding melanoma) were 11.2% (9.2%) and 11.9% (7.9%) for 
ibrutinib and zanubrutinib, respectively. In the supportive phase 1/2 study AU-003 the incidence of 
second primary malignancies in the WM population was 19/78 (24.4%). mostly various skin cancers; 
14/78 (18%). 13 of these 14 patients came from AUS/NZ and 1 patient came from Arizona, USA (68% 
of the overall study population came from Australia and New Zealand). In the pivotal study 302 
(Cohort 1) only 31% were recruited from Australia/New Zealand, which explains the lower incidence of 
both melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 43: AESIs of Second Primary Malignancies (including skin cancers) reported in > 1 
patient in any treatment group (safety analysis set) 
Tumour lysis syndrome: 
No cases of TLS were seen in the pivotal study 003 in either arm or in the supportive study AU-003.  
Infections  
Across all patient groups, infections were the most commonly reported adverse events of special 
interest. 
In the pivotal study 302, Cohort 1, infections were reported at similar incidences in both treatment 
arms: 67.3% vs 66.3%, respectively for ibrutinib and zanubrutinib. The most commonly reported 
infections were upper respiratory tract infection (28.6% versus 23.8%, respectively) and urinary tract 
infection (10.2% versus 9.9%, respectively). There were more reports of pneumonia in the ibrutinib-
treated patients (12.2%) compared with zanubrutinib-treated patients (2.0%). On the other hand, 
there were more Respiratory infections in the zanubrutinib arm (6) compared to the ibrutinib arm (2). 
In the supportive phase 1/2 study AU-003 the incidence of infections in the WM population was higher 
than in study 302 (70/78; 89.7%). On the other hand, the incidence of Pneumonia (PT) was only 5.1% 
although the incidence of Lower respiratory tract infection was 10.3% in the WM population (8/78). 
Upon request, the Applicant has pooled the various pneumonia-related AEs (using 12 months updated 
data) and there is still a difference in favour of zanubrutinib (26.5% vs 16.8 %; see Table below).  
 
 
 
 
 
Table 44: Pneumonia and Lower respiratory infections in ASPEN Cohort 1 
The incidence of serious infections was similar between treatment arms (19 [19.4%] patients in the 
ibrutinib treatment arm and 15 [14.9%] patients in the zanubrutinib treatment arm) despite the higher 
frequency of neutropenia reported with zanubrutinib treatment (≥ Grade 3 AEs: 8.2% vs 19.8%, 
respectively; see Cytopenias below). 
Study 302, Cohort 1: Influenza was more common among zanubrutinib-treated patients (5.0% versus 
1.0%, respectively). The incidence of ≥ Grade 3 infections was comparable between arms (19.4% and 
17.8% in the ibrutinib- and zanubrutinib-treated patients, respectively) whereas SAEs were reported in 
19.4% and 14.9%, respectively. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 45: Infections Reported in ≥ 5% of Patients in Any Patient Group (Safety Analysis 
Set) 
Cytopenia: 
Anaemia: The occurrence of anaemia was of the same magnitude in the ibrutinib- and zanubrutinib-
arm of study 302 both overall (10.2% vs 11.9%, respectively) and ≥ Grade 3 despite there being more 
patients with baseline anaemia (haemoglobin <110 g/L) in the zanubrutinib arm (53.1% vs 65.3%, 
respectively). The incidence of anaemia was higher in the WM patients in study AU-003 (14.1%).    
Thrombocytopenia: The incidence of thrombocytopenia was comparable between the ibrutinib- and 
zanubrutinib arm in study 302; 12.2% and 9.9%, respectively. The same percentage of patients had a 
platelet count < 100 x 109/L at baseline. In study AU-003 (WM patients) the incidence was 7.7%.  
Neutropenia: In study 302 more zanubrutinib-treated than ibrutinib-treated patients reported at least 
1 occurrence of treatment-emergent neutropenia (including preferred terms of neutropenia, decreased 
neutrophil count, febrile neutropenia, and/or neutropenic sepsis); 29.7% vs 13.3%, respectively. ≥ 
Grade 3 AEs were reported in 20 (19.8%) zanubrutinib-treated and 8 (8.2%) ibrutinib-treated patients 
and SAEs for Neutropenia (grouped term) were only seen in the zanubrutinib arm; 6 (5.9%).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 46: TEAEs of Special interest 
 
 
 
 
In study AU-003 (WM patients only) neutropenia was seen in 14 (17.9%) patients with 12 (15.4%) 
having ≥ Grade 3 neutropenia and 3 (3.8%) experiencing an SAE (total WM). As these 3 SAEs were all 
in the R/R WM pool, the incidence was 5.6% (3/54) in the R/R pool.  
Clearly neutropenia is occurring more frequently with zanubrutinib compared to ibrutinib.     
Serious adverse events and deaths 
SAEs 
There were generally more SAEs Infections (SOC) in the ibrutinib arm compared to the zanubrutinib 
arm (19.4% vs 14.9%) in the pivotal study 302. The lung-related PTs were as described for ≥ Grade 3 
AEs.  
PTs related to the SOC Blood and lymphatic system disorders were more frequent in the zanubrutinib 
arm of study 302 (7.9% vs 2.0%). 
The incidence of Atrial fibrillation / flutter overall in study 302 was 14.3% vs 2.0% in the ibrutinib vs 
zanubrutinib arms, respectively. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 47: Serious TEAEs in BGB 3111-302 
A patient in study 302, was presented on Day 35 with an SAE of Grade 3 Pulmonary tuberculosis. 
Reactivation of TB could be caused by the immunosuppressive effect of zanubrutinib as well as by the 
disease itself. Review of the data of the All zanubrutinib safety group (N=779) by the Applicant did not 
show any additional cases of TB reactivation.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Deaths 
Table 48: Summary of All Deaths (Safety Analysis Set) 
Table 49: Adverse Events Leading to Death by preferred term (Safety Analysis Set) 
 
 
In Study BGB-3111-302 Cohort 1, 7 patients in the ibrutinib arm and 6 patients in the zanubrutinib 
arm died. The most common cause of death was progressive disease (3 patients in each arm). Five 
patients in the ibrutinib arm and 1 patient in the zanubrutinib arm died within 30 days of last study 
treatment.  A patient died on Day 242 (49 days after the last zanubrutinib dose discontinued due to an 
SAE of Respiratory failure) due to progressive disease. Given the high proliferation index and 
expression of c-Myc it is considered that this patient had transformed disease (from WM to an 
aggressive lymphoma). The Applicant showed that four CLL-patients and 3 WM patients in the All 
zanubrutinib safety population (N=779) transformed to a more aggressive disease, which is not 
considered unexpected. 
In study AU-003 deaths generally occurred a long time after end of treatment and are considered not 
related. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology:   
In the pivotal phase 3 study 302, Cohort 1, more patients in the zanubrutinib treatment arm had 
Grade 3 or 4 haematology laboratory toxicities compared with the ibrutinib treatment arm (39 [38.6%] 
patients versus 26 [26.5%] patients) (Table 79). This was mainly due to a higher proportion of Grade 
3 or 4 decreased neutrophils in the zanubrutinib treatment arm compared with the ibrutinib treatment 
arm (22 [21.8%] patients versus 8 [8.2%] patients). See also AESIs – Cytopenia, above.  
 
 
Table 50: Summary of Grade 3 and 4 Postbaseline Toxicities: Hematology (Cohort 1) (Safety 
Analysis Set) 
Chemistry  
In study 302, Cohort 1, the proportion of patients with worsening shifts of 2 or more toxicity grades 
from baseline was generally comparable between the ibrutinib and zanubrutinib treatment arms for 
each of the serum chemistry analytes evaluated except for increased potassium (higher in the 
zanubrutinib treatment arm) and increased bilirubin (higher in the ibrutinib treatment arm).  
The 3 cases in the All zanubrutinib group that met 2 of 3 cases for Hy’s Law 2 were due to hepatitis B 
activation (studies performed in China only where Hepatitis B infection is more prevalent than in 
Europe) and the third had normal parameters the next day.  
Patients with severe renal and hepatic impairment were excluded from study 302.

date 31 Aug 2019) 
Comparable frequencies of ≥ Grade 3 adverse event and serious adverse events as well as those 
leading to treatment discontinuation were observed between male and female patients in the All WM 
group.    
 
 
 
 
Table 53: Overview of adverse events by sex (Safety Analysis Set) 
The results indicated that more patients in the white than Asian group experienced AEs leading to dose 
reduction (11.6% versus 3.5%). With extended follow-up, many of the disparities between the Asian 
and White populations have resolved. The number of subjects reporting TEAEs, Grade 3 or higher AEs, 
AEs leading to death and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation is similar between the Asian and 
White treatment groups both in the All WM and All Zanubrutinib populations.    
Renal and hepatic insufficiency 
The number of patients with severe renal impairment and end stage renal disease was low, and thus 
the safety of zanubrutinib in these patients has not been established. 
The clinical studies did not include patients with severe hepatic impairment.

Post marketing experience 
Zanubrutinib (BRUKINSA) has only recently received marketing authorisation in the United States for 
the treatment of adult patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least 1 prior 
therapy. The post-authorisation safety of zanubrutinib has been summarized in 3 quarterly PADERs 
and 1 annual PBRER (DCO 13 November 2020). No new safety signals have been confirmed for 
zanubrutinib.  
 
 
 
 
 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The main safety information is derived from study 302 (BGB-3111-302) Cohort 1 conducted in a 
Western population. Supportive safety data was derived from 78 WM patients in the phase 1/2 study 
AU-003 performed in a mainly Western population.  
Demographics and disease characteristics as well as the median duration of exposure and median dose 
intensities were comparable between the ibrutinib and zanubrutinib arms in study 302. One or more 
dose reductions were seen in 21.4% and 14.9% of patients in the ibrutinib and zanubrutinib arms 
respectively. 
Subjects who have MY88 wild type (MYD88WT) constituted the zanubrutinib treated cohort 2 (in study 
BGB-3111-302). There is doubt whether this subset of patients would have any safety characteristics 
of its own. The Applicant summarised the safety features of Brukinsa in the MYD88WT population using 
the data from the additional 1-year follow-up, and it can be agreed that the results do not show any 
clinically significant differences when compared to the MYD88MUT population.  
In most cases the incidences of adverse events were comparable between the two arms. The 
incidences for the treatment naïve patients vary, but as these are few (app. 20% of the entire study 
population in both arms corresponding to 18 and 19 patients in the ibrutinib vs zanubrutinib arms) the 
overall population (treatment-naïve and R/R patients) are the main focus of the assessments. 
Adverse events in the SOC Infections and Infestation were comparable between the two arms in study 
302 (66-67%) though there were more AEs of PT Pneumonia in the ibrutinib arm compared to the 
zanubrutinib arm (12.2% and 2%, respectively). Comparing the added incidences of the two PTs Lower 
respiratory tract infection and Pneumonia the incidence is still higher in the ibrutinib arm compared to 
the zanubrutinib arm in study 302; 21.4% vs 9.9%, respectively. There were generally more SAEs 
Infections (SOC) in the ibrutinib arm compared to the zanubrutinib arm (19.4% vs 14.9%) in the 
pivotal study 302. One patient experienced an SAE of Grade 3 Pulmonary tuberculosis. Reactivation of 
TB could be caused by the immunosuppressive effect of zanubrutinib as well as by the disease itself. 
Review of the data of the All zanubrutinib safety group (N=779) by the Applicant did not show any 
additional cases of TB reactivation.  
Greater than Grade 3 hypertension, which is a well-known ibrutinib AE, was seen more frequently in 
the ibrutinib arm compared to the zanubrutinib arm (11.2% versus 5.9%, respectively). 
For the Adverse events of special interest (AESI) no clear difference between the two arms in study 
302 were seen for haemorrhage, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, or second primary malignancies. These 
are also considered safety concerns for zanubrutinib as well as for ibrutinib.  
In study 302. more zanubrutinib-treated than ibrutinib-treated patients reported at least 1 occurrence 
of treatment-emergent neutropenia (including preferred terms of neutropenia, decreased neutrophil 
count, febrile neutropenia, and/or neutropenic sepsis); 29.7% vs 13.3%, respectively. ≥ Grade 3 AEs 
were reported in 20 (19.8%) zanubrutinib-treated and 8 (8.2%) ibrutinib-treated patients and SAEs for 
Neutropenia (grouped term) were only seen in the zanubrutinib arm; 6 (5.9%). 
The incidence of the well-known ibrutinib-associated adverse event of atrial fibrillation/ flutter was 
higher in the ibrutinib arm (15.3%) compared to the zanubrutinib arm (2.0%). The low frequency was 
a consistent finding also in the All WM and All Zanubrutinib groups.   
It is notable that in Study BGB-3111-302, Cohort 1, the incidence of diarrhoea among zanubrutinib 
recipients was half that of ibrutinib recipients on an exposure-adjusted basis (1.3 and 2.6 persons/100 
 
person-years, respectively). This is likely to be due to less zanubrutinib-mediated EGFR inhibition 
compared with ibrutinib. 
Seven patients in the ibrutinib arm and 6 patients in the zanubrutinib arm died, three in each arm of 
progressive disease. Given the few deaths no pattern for AE-related deaths is seen.  
In Study BGB-3111-302 Cohort 1, the incidence of haemorrhage of any grade was 59.5% among 
ibrutinib-treated patients compared to 48.5% in the zanubrutinib-treated patients and exposure-
adjusted incidence rates (EAIR) (6.95 versus 4.43 persons/100 person-months). Of these 10 (of 58 
patients) (10.2%) and 6 (of 49 patients) (5.9%) ibrutinib- and zanubrutinib-treated patients, 
respectively, had antecedent thrombocytopenia and 14 (14.3%) and 12 (11.9%), respectively, 
reported the use of antithrombotic medication. Thus, both thrombocytopenia and the use of anti-
thrombotic medication potentially contribute to the higher incidence of haemorrhage (all grades) in the 
ibrutinib arm. Most haemorrhage events in both arms were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. Grade 3 or higher 
haemorrhage was reported for 8 ibrutinib-treated patients and 6 zanubrutinib-treated patients and 
SAEs were reported in 6 and 5 patients, respectively. In the All Zanubrutinib and All WM patient 
groups, haemorrhage of any severity grade was similar among patients in terms of overall crude 
incidence (52.8% and 52.2%, respectively), EAIRs (5.30 and 4.70 persons/100 person-months, 
respectively). Major bleeding events were uncommon in both patient groups (0.20 and 0.27 
persons/100 person-months for the All Zanubrutinib and All WM patient groups, respectively), and 
events that met the criteria for seriousness occurred in 3.1% and 4.3% of patients, respectively. The 
EAIR for ≥ Grade 3 haemorrhage was 0.18 patients/100 person-months. 
Bleeding events have been reported with the use of BTK inhibitors. The Applicant has discussed the 
effects of zanubrutinib on platelets; Grade 3 or higher bleeding events have been reported in 2% of 
patients treated with zanubrutinib monotherapy (Brukinsa USPI 2019). According to the Applicant, BTK 
inhibitor-associated haemostatic defects are believed to be mediated through effects on platelet 
function (the von Willebrand factor-GPIb and collagen-GPVI axes in platelets) rather than on the 
coagulation cascade. The following has been added under Special warnings and precautions for use 
(section 4.4 of SmPC): Warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists therefore should not be administered 
concomitantly with BRUKINSA. Patient should be monitored for signs and symptoms of bleeding and 
monitor complete blood counts. Dose modification may be necessary for Grade 3 or greater adverse 
reactions as recommended.  
The incidence of neutropenia was higher in the zanubrutinib arm in the pivotal study 302 but the 
incidence of Infections (SOC) was comparable. Despite this, there were more AEs of PT Pneumonia in 
the ibrutinib arm compared to the zanubrutinib arm (12.2% and 2%, respectively). Adding the two PTs 
Lower respiratory tract infection and Pneumonia the incidence is still higher in the ibrutinib arm 
compared to the zanubrutinib arm in study 302; 21.4% vs 9.9%, respectively. There were also 
generally more SAEs Infections and Infestations (SOC) in the ibrutinib arm compared to the 
zanubrutinib arm (19.4% vs 14.9%) in the pivotal study 302 despite the higher incidence of 
neutropenia in the zanubrutinib arm.  
The higher incidence of Grade 3 or higher neutropenia did not result in a higher infection rate, possibly 
due to the more frequent use of granulocyte colony stimulating factor among zanubrutinib recipients 
within 30 days of neutropenia onset (46.7% zanubrutinib versus 30.8% ibrutinib). Rates of 
neutropenia were consistent across integrated safety analysis subsets. The Applicant provided a 
summary and discussion concerning the use of granulocyte colony stimulating factors in different study 
arms. The data is descriptive in nature and does not allow more detailed conclusions regarding the 
cytopenias or their responsiveness to G-CSF in association with Zanubrutinib.  
The occurrence of anaemia was of the same magnitude in the ibrutinib- and zanubrutinib-arm of study 
302 both overall (10.2% vs 11.9%, respectively) and ≥ Grade 3 despite there being more patients 
with baseline anaemia (haemoglobin <110 g/L) in the zanubrutinib arm (53.1% vs 65.3%, 
respectively). The incidence of anaemia was higher in the WM patients in study AU-003 (14.1%) 
despite the fact that there were more treatment-naïve patients here compared to study 302 (31% vs 
19%) and baseline haemoglobin <110 g/L was comparable (60%). Clearly anaemia is a concern of 
seemingly the same magnitude as for ibrutinib.    
In the pivotal study 302 there were more SAEs overall in the treatment naïve patients in both arms, 
which is considered unexpected given that these patients have not been exposed to prior cytotoxic 
treatment. This was also the case in the SOCs Blood and lymphatic system disorders and Infections 
and infestations.  Differences in age, ECOG score, suitability for standard chemoradiation, and burden 
of concomitant disease could partly explain the higher SAE incidence in the TN patients compared to 
the R/R population in study 302 as well as uncertainties related to the low number of TN patients. 
A patient was presented on Day 35 with an SAE of Grade 3 Pulmonary tuberculosis. Reactivation of TB 
could be caused by the immunosuppressive effect of zanubrutinib as well as by the disease itself. 
Review of the data of the All zanubrutinib safety group (N=779) by the Applicant did not show any 
additional cases of TB reactivation.  
In the pivotal study 302, Cohort 1, the incidences of second primary malignancies (and the 
subpopulation of various skin cancers excluding melanoma) were comparable between the two arms; 
11.2% (9.2%) and 11.9% (7.9%) for ibrutinib and zanubrutinib, respectively. In the supportive phase 
1/2 study AU-003 the incidence of second primary malignancies in the WM population was much 
higher; 19/78 (24.4%). This was primarily driven by the high incidence of various skin cancers; 14/78 
(18%). 13 of these 14 patients came from AUS/NZ and 1 patient came from Arizona, USA (68% of the 
overall study population came from Australia and New Zealand). In the pivotal study 302 (Cohort 1) 
only 31% were recruited from Australia/New Zealand, which explains the lower incidence of both 
melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer (see also SmPC section 4.4). It is notable, that 5/78 (6.4%) 
of the WM patients in the supportive phase 1/2 study AU-003 discontinued due to neoplastic events (all 
different). This can be explained by a higher incidence of skin cancers in the Australian patients, 
though. 
Comparable frequencies of ≥ Grade 3 adverse event and serious adverse events as well as those 
leading to treatment discontinuation were observed between male and female patients in the All WM 
group.  The Applicant has presented adverse events by gender in study 302. Comparing this to the ISS 
results, it is agreed that given there are fewer female patients (particularly in the 302 study) and no 
consistent trend observed in AESI neutropenia integrated safety analysis, there are no discernible 
adverse event risks associated with gender at present time. 
The number of patients with severe renal impairment and end stage renal disease was low, and thus 
the safety of zanubrutinib in these patients has not been established and it need to be further 
evaluated. The SmPC text related to renal impairment is agreed.  
The clinical studies did not include patients with severe hepatic impairment, and thus the safety of 
zanubrutinib in patients with severe hepatic impairment is missing. The dose modification in this group 
may be agreed.  In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the total and unbound zanubrutinib 
exposures were 1.6- and 2.9-fold higher compared to healthy subjects while the mean total and 
unbound exposures of zanubrutinib were 1.21 and 1.43-fold higher in subjects with moderate hepatic 
impairment. The exposure in moderate impairment group after single 80 mg dose overlaps with mild 
impairment group and healthy volunteers. No dose adjustment is proposed for patients with mild or 
moderate hepatic impairment in the SmPC. 
There is drug-drug interaction potential between zanubrutinib and other concomitant medications, 
particularly with strong cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A inhibitors and inducers. The pharmacokinetics of 
zanubrutinib was assessed in 2 dedicated clinical drug-drug interaction studies, BGB-3111-104 and 
BGB-3111-108. In addition, a physiologically-based pharmacokinetics model was developed to predict 
the effect of moderate and mild CYP3A inhibitors and CYP3A inducers on the pharmacokinetics of 
zanubrutinib.  
In overall, the safety of zanubrutinib was generally comparable to ibrutinib where as importantly,   
Atrial fibrillation is seen at a higher incidence with ibrutinib. The finding of a lower rate of atrial 
fibrillation – also confirmed in studies in other indications - is a valuable improvement over ibrutinib. 
On Study BGB-3111-302, zanubrutinib was found to have a longer time to treatment failure due to AE, 
defined as discontinuing of therapy for any AE, than ibrutinib with over 10% difference at 30 months. 
These differences in tolerability between zanubrutinib and ibrutinib seem to increase over time, and is 
an important finding indicating an improved tolerability - given the need for long-term treatment with 
BTK inhibitors. 
From the safety database, all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety of zanubrutinib was generally comparable to ibrutinib with some important exceptions, a 
lower risk for several events, known to be associated with ibrutinib treatment (atrial fibrillation, 
bleeding, diarrhoea, and hypertension), were seen in patients treated with zanubrutinib.  
The submission of the results of study BGB-3111-LTE1 - an Open-label, Multi-center, Long-term 
Extension Study- in the context of additional pharmacovigilance (category 3 measures) is agreed in 
order to evaluate the long-term safety of zanubrutinib, as monotherapy or in combination, in patients 
with B-cell malignancies treated with zanubrutinib (see RMP).

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 0.5 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 14 November 2019. The new EURD list entry 
will therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of zanubrutinib with active substances contained in authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, 
mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Brukinsa (zanubrutinib) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
 
 
 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The request is for an authorisation of zanubrutinib monotherapy in the treatment of adult patients with 
Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia (WM), who have received at least 1 prior therapy, or in first-line 
treatment for patients unsuitable for chemo-immunotherapy. 
WM is an acquired disorder, which has an indolent to aggressive course, with haemorheologic and 
autoimmune manifestations and systemic symptoms due to bone marrow infiltration, lymphoid 
involvement and tissue deposits. The elderly patient population present with bleeding, cardiac failure, 
neuropathy, anaemia and infection, night-sweats and weight-loss. The aim of treatment is to control 
any acute life-threatening complications (hyperviscosity), to alleviate the variety of chronic symptoms 
(malignant lymphoma), to prolong survival, and to preserve QoL, reflected in standardized response 
criteria. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Curative intended treatment requires allogeneic stem cell transplantation, indicated in very few 
patients. Various mono- and combination therapies with alkylators, proteasome inhibitors, immune-
modulating agents and antibody have been established as effective interventions, and in a third of 
patients supported by plasmapheresis initially to clear the M-component.  The development of BTK 
inhibitors, which play a role in B-lymphocyte malignancies, and introduction five years ago of ibrutinib 
(Imbruvica) offers an alternative, oral and daily targeted monotherapy until progression or intolerance. 
So far, no other BTK inhibitors have been authorised in WM substantiated to prolong survival, improve 
disease control and alleviate adverse events in order to further mitigate an unmet medical need 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study 302 (ASPEN) was a phase 3, randomized (n=229), open-label, multicenter study comparing the 
efficacy and safety of the Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase inhibitors BGB-3111 (zanubrutinib, 160mg BID) and 
ibrutinib (420mg QD) in adult subjects with Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia, in first or later lines.  
Eligible patients were at least 18 years of age with a clinical and definite histological diagnosis of 
relapsed/refractory WM or treatment-naïve when considered unsuitable for standard chemo-
immunotherapy regimens by their treating physician. Patients had to meet at least one criterion for 
treatment according to consensus panel criteria from the Seventh International Workshop on 
Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia (IWWM) and have measurable disease, as defined by a serum IgM 
level > 0.5 g/dl. Patients with MYD88 mutation (MYD88MUT) were assigned to Cohort 1 (N=201) and 
were randomized 1:1 to receive either zanubrutinib 160 mg twice daily (Arm A) or ibrutinib 420 mg 
once daily (Arm B) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Subjects found to have MYD88 
wildtype (MYD88WT) by gene sequencing (estimated to be present in approximately 10 % of enrolled 
subjects), were enrolled to Cohort 2 (N = 28) and received zanubrutinib 160 mg twice daily on a third, 
non-randomized, study arm (Arm C). Primary endpoints were the proportion of patients achieving 
either CR or VGPR, as determined by the IRC according to the same definitions as in Study -210. The 
study designed to compare the efficacy and safety of 2nd generation BTKi zanubrutinib and ibrutinib in 
patients with Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia (WM) who required therapy in first (treatment naïve, 
TN n=42) or later lines (relapsed / refractory, RR n=187).  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
A CR/VGPR of 28% is observed in the zanubrutinib arm compared to 19% in the ibrutinib arm.  
Per the protocol and the SAP, the Applicant would test the secondary endpoint MRR according to a pre-
planned NIM, but ONLY if the study met its primary endpoint. Nonetheless, it is clinically encouraging 
to see a risk difference for MRR of -0.5% (-12.2, 11.1) and thus well within the NIM of 12%. 
Zanubrutinib is as effective in first line as later lines.  This effect was also induced across disease 
characteristics.  
The major response rate was also comparable in treatment naïve and in relapsed / refractory patients 
of 75%, which is durable in 70-80% of patients for 2 – 4 years. 
No significant difference in efficacy between patients treated in first lines or less than 3 lines for WM, 
which offers flexibility when to introduce this agent in the treatment algorithm for the individual 
patient.   
The response is accompanied by a high degree of resolution of treatment-precipitating symptoms like 
hyperviscosity, severe anaemia, neuropathy, night-sweats and weight-loss, autoimmune 
manifestations and lymphoid organomegaly as bulky glands, liver and spleen.   
Responses were observed with zanubrutinib across subgroups, including MYD88WT patients (Cohort 2) 
who had a VGPR or CR rate of 26.9 % and an MRR of 50 % thus MYD88WILD-TYPE genotype showed a 
similar response as MYD88L265P mutated WM patients, which was not expected.   
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Results may indicate a better response in MYD88L265P mutated WM patients with high or intermediate 
IPSSWM score, than in low risk patients.  
CR was a very rare event, in both zanubrutinib as ibrutinib treatment. More CR may have been 
expected by a targeted treatment, however, up to 10% CR may be achieved in other (combination-) 
treatments, and the issue may reflect that BTK-dependent pathways are not key-drivers in WM. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Adverse events in the SOC Infections and Infestation were comparable between the two arms in study 
302 (66-67%) though there were more AEs of PT Pneumonia in the zanubrutinib arm compared to the 
ibrutinib arm (12.2% and 2%, respectively). Comparing the added incidences of the two PTs Lower 
respiratory infection and Pneumonia the incidence is still higher in the ibrutinib arm compared to the 
zanubrutinib arm in study 302; 21.4% vs 9.9%, respectively.  
≥ Grade 3 hypertension, which is a well-known ibrutinib AE, were seen more frequently in the ibrutinib 
arm compared to the zanubrutinib arm (11.2% versus 5.9%, respectively).   
≥ Grade 3 AEs were reported in 20 (19.8%) zanubrutinib-treated and 8 (8.2%) ibrutinib-treated 
patients and SAEs for Neutropenia (grouped term) were only seen in the zanubrutinib arm; 6 (5.9%). 
As for the Adverse events of special interest (AESI) no clear difference between the two arms in study 
302 were seen for haemorrhage, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, or second primary malignancies. These 
are also considered safety concerns for zanubrutinib as well as for ibrutinib.  
The incidence of the well-known ibrutinib-associated adverse event of atrial fibrillation/ flutter was 
higher in the ibrutinib arm (15.3%) compared to the zanubrutinib arm (2.0%). 
Seven patients in the ibrutinib arm and 6 patients in the zanubrutinib arm died, three in each arm of 
progressive disease. Given the few deaths no pattern for AE-related deaths is seen. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Overall, the safety of zanubrutinib seems at least comparable to ibrutinib and no major uncertainties or 
limitations have been identified.   
Any long-term adverse events, in particular haematologic long-term toxicity or any organ-
manifestations, have not yet been determined. Routine pharmacovigilance activities are expected to 
resolve this (see RMP).

3.7.   Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In the context of a rare disease, the Applicant has provided a head-to-head comparison in a phase 3 
study, supported by further data from a phase 1/2 study. In total 201 patients were randomized 1:1. 
The result by IRC shows CR/VGPR in the ibrutinib arm around 19%, which is in line with the 
observations made in study 1118B. A CR/VGPR of 28% is observed in the zanubrutinib arm. With 
regards to MRR the IRC concluded 77.8% vs. 77.5% in ibrutinib and zanubrutinib respectively.  
With respect to safety, a trend towards a lower risk for several events, known to be associated with 
ibrutinib treatment (atrial fibrillation, diarrhoea, and hypertension), were seen in patients treated with 
zanubrutinib. The finding of a lower rate of atrial fibrillation indicates that this is not a mere me-too; it 
is a valuable improvement over ibrutinib in this elderly population.  
The incidence of neutropenia was higher in the zanubrutinib arm in the pivotal study 302 but the 
incidence of Infections (SOC) was comparable. Despite this, there were more AEs of PT Pneumonia in 
the ibrutinib arm compared to the zanubrutinib arm (12.2% and 2%, respectively). Adding the two PTs 
Lower respiratory tract infection and Pneumonia the incidence is still higher in the ibrutinib arm 
compared to the zanubrutinib arm in study 302; 21.4% vs 9.9%, respectively. There were also 
generally more SAEs Infections and Infestations (SOC) in the ibrutinib arm compared to the 
zanubrutinib arm (19.4% vs 14.9%) in the pivotal study 302 despite the higher incidence of 
neutropenia in the zanubrutinib arm. 
 
 
               
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, clinically meaningful results have been shown. Efficacy and safety of zanubrutinib are 
considered established. Zanubrutinib offers another treatment option in the armamentarium for 
patients with WM, which is highly welcomed, especially in older patients with cardio-vascular 
comorbidity. 
3.7.2.   Balance of benefits and risks 
Efficacy has been established, while the safety profile is considered superior in the context of 
derogations from market exclusivity.  The majority of AEs observed are manageable in the clinical 
setting. The B/R balance is therefore positive.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
In view of the similarity with Imbruvica, and for the purposes of applying for a derogation to its market 
exclusivity, the applicant submitted the following arguments to establish superiority on the basis of 
greater safety in a substantial portion the target patient population.  
For the detailed assessment to the evidence submitted in support of the claim of clinical superiority in 
the context of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, reference is made to the “CHMP Assessment Report on 
derogations applicable to similar orphan products” in Appendix 2.   
As a conclusion, the clinically most important result that the occurrence of atrial fibrillation is lower in 
the Zanubrutinib treated patients than in the Ibrutinib population can be agreed upon. From a clinical 
point of view the improved safety profile and tolerability -as also reflected in a longer time to 
treatment failure- is considered a relevant advantage in the target population and thus provides a 
basis for clinical superiority and derogation from market exclusivity. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Brukinsa as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with Waldenström’s 
macroglobulinaemia (WM) who have received at least one prior therapy, or in first line treatment for 
patients unsuitable for chemo-immunotherapy - is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Brukinsa is similar to Imbruvica within the meaning of 
Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
Derogation(s) from market exclusivity 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 
and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000 the following derogation laid down in Article 
8.3 of the same Regulation applies: 
  
 
the applicant could establish in the application that the medicinal product, although similar to ibrutinib, 
is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior (as defined in Article 3 of Commission 
Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000) for the same therapeutic indication (see appendix 2).  
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Brukinsa is favourable in the following indication: 
Brukinsa as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with Waldenström’s 
macroglobulinaemia (WM) who have received at least one prior therapy, or in first line treatment for 
patients unsuitable for chemo-immunotherapy. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product to be implemented by the Member States 
Not applicable. 
These conditions fully reflect the advice received from the PRAC.   
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that zanubrutinib is a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European 
Union.

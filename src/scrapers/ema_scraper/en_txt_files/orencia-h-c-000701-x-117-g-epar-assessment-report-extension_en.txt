2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a broad term that describes a clinically heterogeneous group of arthritis of 
unknown aetiology that begins before the age of 16 years and persists for at least 6 weeks. JIA is one of 
the most common chronic diseases of childhood and is an important cause of short- and long-term 
disability. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
JIA is one of the most common chronic diseases of childhood and is an important cause of short- and 
long-term disability. The epidemiology for JIA varies depending on different global regions and method of 
analysis, the reported incidence rates being between 7-100/100,000 and prevalence of 32 to 
200/100,000.  
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Polyarticular JIA is a systemic disease with active synovial inflammation; elevation of platelet, white blood 
cell counts and acute phase reactants, fever, anaemia, and growth retardation, weight loss and failure to 
thrive all speak to the systemic nature of this inflammation. Recent evidence in RA, psoriatic arthritis and 
lupus, as well as other chronic systemic inflammatory disorders suggests that such active inflammation 
predisposes to accelerated atherosclerosis leading to premature coronary and cerebrovascular disease; 
there is evidence of a similar linkage in active pJIA. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
JIA is a diagnostic classification designed to encompass a heterogeneous group of chronic childhood and 
adolescent inflammatory joint diseases. The current JIA classification recognizes seven clinical JIA 
subtypes based on phenotype, serology and associated features: rheumatoid factor (RF) positive and 
negative polyarthritis, extended oligoarthritis, persistent oligoarthritis, enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA), 
psoriatic arthritis (PsA), systemic arthritis, and undifferentiated arthritis. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Polyarticular JIA is treated with the same medicinal products used for adult RA. Similarly to adult RA, 
emphasis is on early diagnosis and aggressive therapy, and closer disease monitoring as we 
‘treat-to-target’. Treatment currently aims at disease remission i.e. minimal disease activity and quality 
of life approaching that of any other child. With this concept of a ‘treatment window of opportunity’ 
instead of a slower ‘step-up’ pyramid approach, patient care is optimised and better long term outcomes 
are achieved. A current parallel concept is that of clinical versus immunological remission: that there may 
be ongoing activity within the immune system, measurable by increasingly sensitive biochemical and 
radiological markers, even in the absence of clinically apparent disease. Extinguishing even this 
subclinical immune activity is becoming the new treatment goal. 
Current treatment options include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, and 
biologic and non-biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). 
Assessment report  
EMA/126226/2019  
Page 9/100 
 
 
 
NSAIDs, such as naproxen, ibuprofen, and diclofenac, are indicated for a wide range of rheumatoid 
conditions and can be used as an initial therapy for paediatric patients with JIA. NSAIDs may be used 
alone when disease flares are intermittent and only mild to moderate in severity. 
Corticosteroids are often used in the long-term management or in the treatment of disease flares for both 
adults with RA and paediatric patients with JIA. However, the use of corticosteroids is limited due to both 
short-term and long-term toxicity. 
Second-line therapies include conventional non-biologic DMARDs such as MTX (usually the cornerstone of 
therapy) or leflunomide, typically in combination with NSAIDs. Non-biologic DMARDs have been also used 
in combination with corticosteroids. Use of single or multiple non-biologic DMARDs is not effective in all 
patients and has been associated with toxicity or aversion to therapy for some patients. 
Several biologic DMARDs are approved to treat JIA typically as second- or third-line therapies. Biologic 
TNF-alpha inhibitors are recommended for most subtypes of pJIA in patients whose disease inadequately 
responds to standard non-biologic DMARDs.  
Non-biologic DMARDs, anti-TNF-alpha therapies, and cytokine inhibition therapies for JIA are not 
uniformly effective or tolerated. Some JIA subtypes respond differently, some patients do not respond, 
and other patients experience secondary loss of efficacy, often with an accompanying production of 
anti-drug antibodies. These therapies can also have significant toxicities that can force interruption or 
discontinuation of therapy. 
About the product 
ORENCIA (abatacept, Bristol-Myers Squibb [BMS]-188667), is a selective costimulation modulator that 
acts on a key regulatory pathway for immune activation and reduces the inflammatory process associated 
with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Abatacept is a soluble fusion protein that consists of the extracellular 
domain of human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (T-cell)-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) linked to the modified Fc 
(hinge, CH2, and CH3 domains) portion of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1). Abatacept binds to 
CD80/CD86 receptors on antigen-presenting cells, thereby inhibiting binding of these molecules to the 
costimulatory CD28 receptor on T cells and inhibiting full activation of T cells and the downstream 
inflammatory cascade. 
Orencia (IV and SC formulations) is approved for the treatment of Rheumatoid arthritis and Psoriatic 
arthritis. Intravenous (IV) abatacept was approved in 2009 for the treatment of moderate to severe 
active pJIA in paediatric patients 6 years of age and older who have had an insufficient response to other 
DMARDs, including at least one TNF-alpha inhibitor. The paediatric IV Study IM101033 included both 
MTX-IR and TNF-IR pJIA patients, but was considered to support only the third line pJIA indication, similar 
to the approved adult RA indication that at that time included only those with insufficient response or 
intolerance to other DMARDs including at least one TNF-alpha inhibitor. 
In 2010, the adult RA indication was extended to include adult patients with RA with inadequate response 
to previous therapy with one or more DMARDs including MTX or a TNF-alpha inhibitor, which indication 
was supported by long-term efficacy and safety data from the initial RA studies, as well as by a new study 
conducted in MTX-naive RA patients (IM101023). Later also SC abatacept was approved for adult RA, 
supported by the Study IM101174, which demonstrated therapeutic equivalence between IV abatacept 
and SC abatacept in RA patients.  
In 2016, the adult RA indication for IV and SC abatacept was extended to the first line treatment, i.e. 
treatment of highly active and progressive disease in adult patients with RA not previously treated with 
MTX.

Type of Application and aspects on development 
This application is a grouped variations application that is being submitted together with an Extension 
Application covering two new strengths (50 mg and 87.5 mg) for an already approved pharmaceutical 
form (Solution for injection in pre-filled syringe). These 2 new strengths are presented in a pre-filled 
syringe with needle guard. 
The grouped type II variation application consists of the submission of a type II variation (category 
C.I.6.a) and four quality type IB variations (categories B.II.e.1.b.z, B.II.d.2.a, B.II.b.3.a and B.II.b.3.a). 
These changes are submitted as a grouping as the proposed clinical and quality changes are linked to the 
extension application. In addition, the four proposed quality changes are applicable to both the new 
paediatric presentations and the currently approved Orencia 125 mg solution for injection in pre-filled 
syringe.  
The proposed changes of indication are as follows: 
•  Current paediatric indication (IV abatacept) 
ORENCIA in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active 
polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) in paediatric patients 6 years of age and older who have 
had an insufficient inadequate response to previous other DMARD therapys including at least one TNF 
inhibitor. 
ORENCIA can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when treatment with 
methotrexate is inappropriate. 
• 
The currently proposed new paediatric indication for sub cutaneous (SC) abatacept 
(ORENCIA 50 mg and 87.5mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe) 
ORENCIA in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active 
polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) in paediatric patients 2 years of age and older who have 
had an inadequate response to previous DMARD therapy.   
ORENCIA can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when treatment with 
methotrexate is inappropriate. 
An updated RMP (version 25.0) was submitted with this application to include data from pivotal study 
IM101-301, in support of the pJIA indication. The MAH has also revised the content and format of the RMP 
according to the revised guideline on Good Pharmacovigilance Practices Module V (Rev 2). As a result, 
“immunogenicity” has been removed from the list of important potential risks. 
No CHMP Scientific Advice dedicated namely to this application was sought by the MAH. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The purpose of this line extension application and variation grouping is to introduce two new strengths of 
abatacept (ORENCIA 50 mg and 87.5 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe (PFS)) of an already 
approved pharmaceutical form (Orencia 125 mg solution for injection in PFS), for the already approved 
subcutaneous (SC) route of administration, for a new paediatric population indication, as detailed above. 
The finished product composition and concentration (125 mg/mL) are the same for all the three 
strengths. In addition to the currently approved syringe barrel, two alternate syringe barrels are 
proposed, as detailed below. The device components that come into contact with the solution are the 
Assessment report  
EMA/126226/2019  
Page 11/100 
 
 
 
 
same as the currently approved ones. The relevant specification (fill volume) and analytical method (glide 
force distance range) have been updated to reflect the addition of new fill volumes. Minor changes to the 
proposed manufacturing method of the new strengths, are also applicable to the already marketed 
products. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
There are no changes declared for the active substance part of Module 3. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Abatacept PFS is provided as a 125 mg/mL sterile solution, ready for injection.  It is a clear, colourless to 
pale yellow solution with a pH of 6.8 to 7.4. It is available in three strengths, namely 50 mg and 87.5 mg, 
subject of this application, and 125 mg (marketed). The product is supplied in a single-use pre-filled 
syringe (PFS, type I glass) with an automatic needle safety guard and flange extenders. The type I glass 
syringe has a coated bromobutyl stopper and fixed stainless steel needle covered with a rigid needle 
shield.The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The marketed SC formulation is a ready 
to use single dose formulation available in three presentations (PFS with flange extender; PFS with BD 
Ultrasafe Automatic Needle Guard and flange extender, CE marked, and PFS in ClickJect autoinjector). In 
addition to the currently approved BD Hypak syringe barrel with pre-printed lines (for use only for the 1.0 
mL fill), two alternate syringe barrels are proposed for the PFS with UltraSafe Automatic Needle Guard, to 
ensure robust supply: the BD Hypak syringe barrel without pre-printed lines and BD Neopak syringe 
barrel without pre-printed lines. These two syringe barrels are both supplied by BD and visually look the 
same. The device components that come into contact with the solution are the same as the currently 
approved ones. All syringes are manufactured by the currently approved supplier, Becton Dickinson 
Medical-Pharmaceutical Systems (BD). These syringes use the same Type I borosilicate glass and have 
the same 0.5 inch, 29-gauge thin-wall stainless steel needle, as the current commercial product .The 
three strengths are differentiated by the colour of the plunger rod (50 mg-white, 87.5 mg-light blue, and 
currently approved 125 mg-orange), syringe label and secondary packaging artwork. 
Abatacept 125mg/mL contains as excipients sucrose (stabiliser), poloxamer 188 (surfactant), sodium 
phosphate monobasic monohydrate (buffering agent), sodium phosphate dibasic anhydrous (buffering 
agent) and water for injection (solvent). All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and 
their quality is compliant with pharmacopoeial standards. There are no novel excipients used in the 
finished product formulation. In view of the paediatric indication for the new strengths (for use in children 
two years and older) the applicant has been requested to justify suitability of the formulation in 
accordance with the guideline on Pharmaceutical development of medicines for paediatric use 
(EMA/CHMP/QWP/805880/2012 Rev. 2) as part of the development; especially in relation to the 
quantities of poloxamer 188 and sucrose. A multidisciplinary concern has been raised for quality and 
safety, which was resolved based on published pre-clinical and clinical findings and taking into 
consideration the route of administration and the weekly dose of the excipients. Additionally, the 
applicant has satisfactorily justified that the presence of silicon oil used as lubricant and sprayed to the 
interior of the syringes does not affect the stability or the safety of the finished product and that it is 
acceptable for the proposed paediatric patient population.

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The process is a modification of the manufacturing process for an approved product. Satisfactory 
validation data have been provided for the paediatric presentations. The manufacturing process of the 
additional two strengths is considered as satisfactorily validated.  
Product specification  
The release specification includes: appearance, volume in container, pH, osmolality, identity, peptide 
mapping, isoelectric focusing, protein concentration, sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis, size homogeneity, B7 Binding, human cell IL-2 inhibition assay, sterility, particulate 
matter, bacterial endotoxins. The analytical methods are the same as the currently approved ones.  
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data of the finished product were provided. The results are within the specifications and 
confirm consistency of the manufacturing process.  
Stability of the product 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life of 24 months and storage condition of 2 °C to 8 °C and 
protected from light, as stated in the SmPC, are acceptable. 
Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
The information provided to support this line extension has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The 
results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, 
and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform 
performance in clinical use. 
Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of the new presentations of ORENCIA (Abatacept) 50 mg and 87.5 mg solution for injection in

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
No new data has been submitted in this application. To support paediatric development, the MAH has 
submitted within earlier variation procedures studies on juvenile rats aged from post-natal day 4 (PND4) 
to PND94, which covers humans from neonates to adulthood. Related to the extension of indication of 
Orencia to paediatric patient population with pJIA in 6 to 17 years and the post-authorisation 
commitments thereafter, the MAH has performed non-clinical immunotoxicity studies in adult and 
juvenile rats to address the potential association of the presence of ADAs and the autoimmunity observed 
in previous juvenile studies. In these studies, autoimmunity-related findings such as lymphocytic 
infiltration of the thyroid and pancreatic islands was frequently observed in juvenile rats but only in rare 
cases in adult rats indicating that juvenile animals might be more sensitive than the adult animals. 
Additional juvenile study suggested that findings indicative of autoimmunity observed in previous studies 
might be due to the pharmacological activity of abatacept and not to the occurrence of ADAs.

2.4.2.  Rationale for extrapolation  
An extrapolation approach was proposed to characterize the clinical profile of SC abatacept in pJIA. This 
approach was agreed on with the Paediatric Committee (PDCO). The rationale for this extrapolation 
approach is discussed below:

Development of Subcutaneous Abatacept in Adults 
The clinical development program for SC abatacept included a direct IV to SC comparison in adults with 
RA (pivotal Study IM101174) to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence between the formulations. Three 
other supportive studies (IM101173, IM101167, IM101185) assessed the efficacy, safety, and 
immunogenicity in adults under clinical scenarios that could potentially increase the development of 
immunogenicity and to determine the consequences of treating with SC abatacept in this setting (e.g., no 
IV load, monotherapy, prolonged withdrawal of therapy, switch from IV to SC). An additional clinical 
pharmacology and safety study (IM101063) was conducted for the selection of an SC abatacept dosing 
regimen.  
The PK and exposure-response (E-R) of IV and SC abatacept have also been characterized in adult 
subjects with RA. These analyses demonstrated that the PK of IV and SC abatacept is linear, and that 
steady-state trough concentration (Cminss) is the most appropriate measure of exposure for efficacy in 
adult subjects with RA.  
Clinical Development Program in pJIA 
The therapeutic utility of intravenously (IV) administered abatacept in patients with pJIA was 
demonstrated in the Phase 3 pivotal Study IM101033. IM101033 was a randomized withdrawal study that 
evaluated the safety and efficacy of IV abatacept in children and adolescents (ages 6 to 17 years) with 
active pJIA and inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX) and/or biologic DMARDs. Doses were 
administered once every 2 weeks for the first 4 weeks, and once every 4 weeks thereafter. IV abatacept 
was found to have a favourable benefit/risk profile in pJIA, resulting in approval to treat pJIA in the EU in 
2009 (variation II/24). The approved therapeutic indication was follows: 
“ORENCIA in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active 
polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in paediatric patients 6 years of age and older who have 
had an insufficient response to other disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug(s) (DMARDs) including at 
least one TNF-alpha inhibitor. Orencia has not been studied in children under 6 years old” 
The approved IV dose is 10 mg/kg every 4 weeks (q4w) for patients who weigh less than 75 kg; paediatric 
patients weighing 75 kg or more should follow the adult dosing regimen. 
With the IV development program, the PK of IV abatacept have been well characterized in adult patients 
with RA and in paediatric patients with pJIA, and have been shown to be comparable, after accounting for 
the effect of body weight. The E-R relationship was also deemed to be comparable between RA and pJIA. 
The E-R analyses of efficacy suggest that similar levels of abatacept exposure are required to achieve 
adequate efficacy in adult patients with RA (ACR20) and in paediatric patients with pJIA (JIA ACR30).  
Furthermore, the E-R relationship was similar between IV and SC abatacept in RA. Based on the 
observation of therapeutic equivalence between IV and SC abatacept in adults with RA, it was reasonable 
to assume that the E-R relationship would be similar between IV and SC abatacept in pJIA. To that end, 
the existing PK and efficacy data in RA and JIA was leveraged to design a SC dosing regimen that accounts 
for the changes in body weight that occur with age to maintain similar abatacept exposures throughout 
the paediatric age range. 
Appropriateness of extrapolating abatacept data from adults to paediatric patients  
The clinical data from the abatacept adults RA (IV and SC) development programme are considered 
relevant for both adults and paediatrics as consistent eligibility criteria were employed irrespective of age 
in both adult and the paediatric studies. Results from comparison of these studies showed that the 
baseline characteristics of the disease were consistent between the age groups and the studies.  
Assessment report  
EMA/126226/2019  
Page 15/100 
 
 
 
The clinical efficacy and safety endpoint data from the adult RA (IV and SC) and the IV pJIA programmes 
are considered relevant for both adults and the paediatric patients. The primary and/ key secondary 
endpoints in adult RA for exposure and efficacy were alike (ACR and ACRp criteria, Cmin) in both 
paediatric the IV and SC studies. The standard ACR criteria were used to assess and establish efficacy, 
improvement. Overall, in these studies also the other secondary and explorative outcomes were 
consistent between adults and paediatrics.  
Key steps of the proposed extrapolation strategy 
1.  Confirm that abatacept is efficacious with a favourable benefit-risk profile in adult subjects with 
RA (IV and SC). Confirm that abatacept is efficacious with a favourable benefit-risk profile in 
subjects with pJIA (IV) patients aged 6 to 17 years of age. The data together with current data 
from study IM101301 form the basis of extrapolation to paediatric pJIA subjects treated with SC 
abatacept. 
2.  Confirm that abatacept PK in adults is predictive of PK in paediatrics following both IV 
administration and SC administration (predictability of the available paediatric data in pJIA 6 to 
17 years) and confirm the consistency of the PK of abatacept in both adults and paediatric 
populations.    
3.  Provide supportive evidence that abatacept efficacy in adults treated with SC and IV abatacept 
with RA and paediatric pJIA patients treated with IV abatacept can be extrapolated to the 
paediatric population (6 to 17 years of age) and that establishing this evidence is sufficient to 
extend this to the 2 to 5 years age group pJIA patients. 
4.  Evaluate the safety profile of the SC formulation of abatacept in the paediatric population (aged 
2 to 17 years) with pJIA by comparing it with that of the overall phase III IV and SC RA and IV 
pJIA clinical development programme. 
5.  Identify and plan for the mitigation of any remaining uncertainty and risk. 
This approach, in which limited data was to be collected in the target population, with extrapolation of 
efficacy and safety data from source populations of the abatacept (IV and SC) in RA and pJIA (IV) 
development programme, was agreed on with the Paediatric Committee (PDCO). In this context, an 
open-label Study IM101301 (with PK as the primary endpoint and efficacy and safety were evaluated to 
confirm that the benefit-risk profile was comparable to that observed with IV abatacept in pJIA) and a PK 
modelling and simulation evaluation, was considered appropriate to seek approval for the use of SC 
abatacept in the treatment of 2 to 17 year old children with pJIA and possibly include monotherapy in the 
IV indication for the older 6 to 17 year-old population.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
In the present application for the subcutaneously administered abatacept in treatment of JIA in paediatric 
patients 2 years of age and older, pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of SC abatacept in children and 
adolescents (ages 2-17 years) with JIA was investigated in one study IM101301. 
A weight-tiered dosing regimen was selected for SC abatacept based on pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacodynamic modelling and simulation analyses: Doses of 50 mg, 87.5 mg, and 125 mg were 
administered once per week (q1w) in patients weighing 10 to < 25 kg, 25 to 50 kg, and > 50 kg, 
respectively. Sparse PK samples, primarily trough concentrations, were collected. Summary statistics for 
the observed abatacept Cmin by weight-tiered dose are displayed in the table below.

Table 2 Observed abatacept Cmin Values by Weight-tiered Dose (Study IM101301) 
The Cminss levels observed with weight-tiered SC dosing in paediatric patients were higher than average 
Cminss levels observed in adult RA patients with fixed 125 mg SC dosing. However, the observed Cminss 
values were comparable to the observed exposures in RA patients with low body weight (<60 kg) (Figure 
below).

Population PK analysis 
Marketing authorization in the EU has been granted for Orencia 125 mg solution for injection in pre-filled 
syringe for subcutaneous use. Bioavailability and bioequivalence studies were not conducted for the two 
proposed medicinal products Orencia 87.5 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe and Orencia 50 
mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe. This is acceptable because the same drug product is used in 
the syringes, only the fill volume (0.4 mL, 0.7 mL and 1 mL) is adjusted for each syringe dose strength. 
Pharmacokinetics of abatacept in paediatric patients with JIA was evaluated using population PK (PPK) 
analysis. The data were collected from patients in two JIA studies [Study IM101033, intravenous (IV) 
abatacept; Study IM101301, subcutaneous (SC) abatacept] and 11 adult RA studies. All available PK data 
in JIA patients were used, including the open-label lead-in phase (Period A) and randomized double-blind 
treatment phase (Period B) of Study IM101033 and the open-label short-term and long-term treatment 
periods of Study IM101301 (database lock March 21, 2017). The PPK analysis was conducted with a total 
of 12759 serum concentration values from 2213 adult patients with RA, 357 patients aged 6 to 17 years 
with JIA and 46 patients aged 2 to 5 years with JIA, who received IV and/or SC abatacept.  
The final PPK model was a 2-compartment, zero-order IV infusion, first-order SC absorption, and 
first-order elimination model with a combined residual error model. This is the same structural model that 
was used in previous abatacept PPK models. Covariate-parameter relationships that have been tested in 
previous abatacept PPK models were tested in developing the current model. A single round of forward 
selection was used to select statistically significant (univariate alpha level of 0.01) covariates for inclusion 
in the full model (Figure below). Covariate-parameter relationships of the full model were assessed using 
the likelihood ratio test (LRT) within a stepwise backward elimination process using alpha level 0.001. The 
effect of race and duration of disease on CL were removed in the backward elimination analyses. 
Assessment report  
EMA/126226/2019  
Page 18/100 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2 Covariate Effect Forest Plot of the Full PPK Model 
The following covariate effects were statistically significant and retained in the final PPK model (Table 
below): baseline body weight, calculated GFR, albumin, swollen joint count, co-administration of NSAIDs, 
and gender on CL; baseline body weight and age on VC; baseline body weight on VP; and baseline body 
weight, age, and disease status on F. Even though several covariates were statistically significant, only 
body weight effect on clearance (CL) and volume (VC, VP) parameters and disease (JIA vs. RA) effect on 
bioavailability were considered to have clinical relevance. CL, VC and VP increased with increasing body 
weight, in line with previous data. Absorption of SC abatacept was more extensive in JIA patients: JIA 
patients exhibited 28% higher absolute bioavailability for SC formulation than RA patients. Furthermore, 
absorption rate appeared to be faster in JIA, although this was not formally investigated. The absorption 
rate constant (KA) was approximately 41.5% higher in the current model than in a previous PPK model 
that included only adult RA patients. Because typical JIA patients are younger and have lower body weight 
than RA patients, it is difficult to separate the effects of disease, age and weight on absorption 
parameters. The magnitudes (i.e. 95% confidence intervals) of the other covariate effects were 
encompassed within 80% to 125% of reference values and they were considered to be clinically not 
meaningful, even though they were statistically significant. Co-treatment with methotrexate (MTX) did 
not have significant effect on clearance (ΔOFV -1.344, P=0.246). This is in line with the observed data in 
both paediatric trials (study IM101033 and study IM101301) patients with and without MTX had 
comparable Cmin levels at steady state. 
Graphical exploration suggested that anti-drug antibody (ADA) status had no impact on abatacept 
observed Ctrough and estimated clearance in JIA. However, the results should be interpreted with caution 
because only few JIA patients treated with abatacept were ADA positive (see Clinical Safety section).

Table 3 Parameter Estimates of the Final PPK Model 
Overall, parameters were estimated with good precision, but ETA shrinkage values were high (>49%) for 
volume (VC, VP) and absorption (F, KA) parameters. At the CHMP’s request, the MAH discussed the 
consequences of high ETA shrinkage for volume and absorption parameters. Multiple diagnostic criteria 
support the conclusion of the MAH that the population PK model can adequately describe the observed 
data. The PK parameter estimated with the population PK model and used for exposure-response

modelling was Cmin. The MAH’s argument that steady-state Cmin is primarily determined by clearance 
(CL) and less by absorption and volume parameters is scientifically reasonable. ETA shrinkage for CL was 
relatively small (14.1%), which indicates that individual CL (and Cmin) estimates are sufficiently reliable 
for the intended use. 
Major deviations were not observed in the typical diagnostic goodness-of-fit plots, and 
prediction-corrected visual predictive check (pcVPC) analyses indicated that the final model could 
adequately characterize the pharmacokinetics of abatacept.

Estimated individual abatacept steady-state minimum, maximum, and average concentrations (Cminss, 
Cmaxss, and Cavss) for subjects in the PPK dataset were obtained by applying the individual parameter 
estimates (empirical Bayesian estimates) from the final PPK model to the protocol-specified dose for that 
patient with the protocol-specified dosing interval. In addition, stochastic simulations of a virtual JIA 
population of patients were performed to determine the expected range of abatacept exposures. To 
conduct the stochastic simulations, the JIA efficacy dataset (approximately 400 patients age 2 to 17 years 
from Study IM101033 and Study IM101301) was resampled using covariate information from patients 
included in the Phase 3 dataset of patients with JIA to generate a dataset of 2,000 virtual patients. Virtual 
patients administered weight-tiered SC weekly had comparable distributions of exposure to each other 
and the Cavss was comparable to that of the 10 mg/kg IV monthly dosing regimen. As expected, SC 
dosing regimen was associated with higher Cminss and lower Cmaxss than IV dosing regimen.

No new data were provided addressing the pharmacokinetic interactions with other medicinal products 
and the CHMP considered that they are not required. 
Concomitant MTX treatment 
The data from the two paediatric studies IM101033 and IM101301 indicated that the achieved steady 
state (Day 113) abatacept Cmin levels were comparable in subjects with and without concomitant MTX 
treatment. This was in agreement with and supports the result of population PK analysis, showing that the 
baseline concomitant MTX use was not a statistically significant (ΔOFV -1.344, P=0.246) covariate on the 
clearance of abatacept.

2.4.4.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Abatacept is a fusion protein that consists of the extracellular domain of human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte 
antigen 4 (CTLA4) linked to the modified Fc portion of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1). It prevents the 
interaction of the T-cell’s CD28 with the antigen presenting cell’s CD80/CD86 by binding avidly to the 
latter. As a consequence, T-cells are prevented from receiving the required second costimulatory signal 
needed for full activation resulting in inhibition of multiple aspects of T-cell-driven autoimmunity and 
inflammation. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Therapeutic exposure levels of abatacept were investigated in in vitro and non-clinical in vivo studies that 
were assessed during the initial marketing authorisation application of Orencia. In vitro studies using 
human peripheral blood mononuclear cells evaluated the ability of abatacept to inhibit T-cell proliferation 
and cytokine production. Based on the in vitro findings, it was anticipated that serum trough abatacept 
concentrations of 10 to 30 μg/mL would be required to observe maximal clinical efficacy. Increasing 
abatacept concentrations (up to 100 μg/mL) did not result in greater suppression of T-cell proliferation. 
Consistent with the in vitro results, T cell-dependent immune responses were inhibited in animal models 
at doses of abatacept where serum trough concentrations were approximately 10 μg/ml or greater. The 
in vitro studies and in vivo animal model data suggested that trough serum concentrations of abatacept 
between 10 and 50 μg/mL will provide maximal biologic efficacy. 
The relationship between abatacept exposure and efficacy in JIA was characterized by an 
exposure-response (E-R) model (JIAACR model). The JIAACR model describes the probability of achieving 
cumulative JIAACR (JIAACR30, JIAACR50, JIAACR70, and JIAACR100) responses at 4 months (113 days) 
from the initiation of therapy as a function of abatacept exposure using a proportional odds model. 
Estimated individual abatacept measures (Cminss, Cmaxss, and Cavss) were obtained by applying the 
individual parameter estimates from the final PPK model to the protocol-specified dose for that patient 
with the protocol-specified dosing interval. Two JIAACR models were presented in the dossier: The first 
one was built in year 2012 and had data from study IM101033 (IV abatacept), and the second one was 
built in year 2018 and had data from both study IM101033 and study IM101301 (SC abatacept). There 
were no patients treated with placebo in either datasets. 
In the most recent and more extensive (year 2018) JIAACR model, initial analyses for the base E-R model 
indicated that Cminss, compared with Cmaxss and Cavss, was the best (i.e. most statistically significant) 
abatacept exposure parameter describing the E-R relationship for efficacy. A log-linear function 
adequately described the drug effect, indicating that increasing Cminss was associated with a higher

probability of JIAACR response. Covariates of interest, e.g. route of administration, baseline age, 
concomitant medications, disease severity, and JIA category, were tested in the covariate analysis. 
Covariate-parameter relationships were evaluated using a single round of forward inclusion (univariate 
alpha level of 0.01) followed by stepwise backward elimination process using alpha level 0.001. None of 
the covariates were statistically significant predictors of the probability of JIAACR response after the 
backward elimination step (Tables below). Thus, no other predictors of JIAACR response were identified 
except abatacept Cminss.

Table 6 Backward Elimination of Full Covariate Model (year 2018 model) 
The final model-predicted probability of JIAACR response versus Cminss is presented in the Figure below 
along with the observed proportion of JIAACR responders in quartiles of Cminss. There was a good 
agreement between the model-predicted probability of JIAACR response and the proportion of observed 
JIAACR responders across the range of Cminss. A visual predictive check (VPC) with 1000 replicates of 
the analysis dataset indicated the data are accurately characterized by the model (Figure below). Of note,

it seems that higher than 10 µg/mL Cminss is required for near maximal JIAACR 50, 70, and 100 
responses.

Formal E-R analyses for safety endpoints were not conducted. Exploratory graphical analysis of the 
relationship between abatacept exposure and the most common expected adverse event in JIA patients 
(infection regardless of seriousness) suggested no relationship between the exposure and time to first 
infection. Meaningful E-R analyses could not be conducted for serious adverse events (SAEs) because so 
few SAEs were reported in the clinical studies (see section Clinical Safety). 
Abatacept with or without concomitant mtx use As described above, no statistically significant 
covariates for JIAACR response were identified in the most recent (year 2018) JIAACR model. In contrast, 
in the earlier (year 2012) JIAACR model that only had data from study IM101033 (IV abatacept), efficacy 
was significantly better in patients using MTX (Table below). For example, predicted probability of ACR30 
response in patients with median Cminss levels (9.99 µg/mL) was 72.2% and 54.7% in patients using and 
not using MTX, respectively.

predicted ACRp responses in subjects with pJIA. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical profile of SC abatacept in treatment of JIA was investigated in one study: Study IM101301. A 
weight-tiered dosing regimen was used in the study: Doses of 50 mg, 87.5 mg, and 125 mg were 
administered once per week (q1w) in patients weighing 10 to < 25 kg, 25 to 50 kg, and > 50 kg, 
respectively. The primary objective was to estimate abatacept Cminss at Day 113; clinical efficacy and 
safety were secondary objectives. Target Cminss was ≥10 µg/mL in each weight tier, based on prior data 
indicating that near maximal efficacy in terms of JIAACR 30 response was achieved at Cminss level of 
approximately 10 µg/mL. 
Results of study IM101301 confirmed that Cminss ≥10 µg/mL will be achieved with the selected 
weight-tiered dosing regimen. Steady state of abatacept was achieved by day 85 following the weekly 
body-weight–tiered subcutaneous abatacept dosing. Comparable trough concentrations across weight 
tiers and age groups were achieved by the body-weight–tiered subcutaneous dosing regimen. The mean 
(range) trough concentration of abatacept at day 113 was 46.2 mcg/mL (13.4 to 96.2 mcg/mL), 48.0 
mcg/mL (22.4 to 122.1 mcg/mL), and 38.5 mcg/mL (9.3 to 73.2 mcg/mL) in paediatric pJIA patients 
weighing 10 to <25 kg, 25 to <50 kg, and ≥50 kg, respectively. 
Results of the population PK model suggested that the absorption rate and bioavailability in JIA patients 
were higher than in adult RA patients, which were used as the prior information for absorption 
parameters. This is adequately reflected in section 5.2 of the SmPC.  
Parameters describing distribution and elimination of abatacept were comparable for JIA and RA patients 
after adjustment for body size (weight). Consistent with the intravenous data, population 
pharmacokinetic analyses for subcutaneous abatacept in pJIA patients revealed that there was a trend 
toward higher clearance of abatacept with increasing body weight. Age and gender (when corrected for 
body weight) did not affect apparent clearance. Concomitant medication, such as methotrexate, 
corticosteroids, and NSAIDs, did not influence abatacept apparent clearance. 
Even though Cminss levels with SC dosing in JIA patients were higher than expected and they are higher 
than with IV dosing, they were in the range observed in adult RA patients with SC dosing. Abatacept 
maximum concentrations are, obviously, several folds higher with the q4w IV dosing regimen than with 
the q1w SC dosing regimen. Exposure parameters were similar in each weight and age category with the 
dosing regimen used in Study IM101301, which is proposed for the clinical use. 
The most recent (year 2018) JIAACR response model that has approximately two times more paediatric 
JIA patients and wider distribution of Cmin levels than the year 2012 model can more reliably describe the 
effects of abatacept levels and other parameters on clinical response.  The relationship between 
abatacept exposure and efficacy in JIA was characterized by an exposure-response (E-R) model using 
efficacy data from the two conducted clinical studies (IM101033 with IV dosing; IM101301 with SC 
dosing). The model confirmed that, as in RA, the Cminss was a better predictor of efficacy, compared with 
maximum and average concentrations. As in prior E-R analyses, near maximal JIAACR 30 response was 
achieved at Cminss level of approximately 10 µg/mL. Limited and exploratory graphical analysis 
suggested no relationship between the exposure to abatacept and safety endpoints of interest.

IM101033 and IM101301 indicated similar exposure/achieved steady state (Day 113) abatacept Cmin 
levels were comparable in subjects with and without concomitant MTX treatment.  
The result of population PK analysis showed that the baseline concomitant MTX use was not a statistically 
significant (ΔOFV -1.344, P=0.246) covariate on the clearance of abatacept.  
Furthermore, modelling showed that MTX was not a significant covariate and did not affect the prediction 
of ACRp response in subjects with pJIA.  
Abatacept with or without Prior Biologic Failure – second line therapeutic positioning  
The results of the E-R analysis with the most recent (year 2018) JIAACR response model also 
demonstrated that prior use of TNF-alpha inhibitors was not significant covariate and did not affect 
predicted ACRp responses in subjects with pJIA. 
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The impact of modelling and simulation exercises in the application is high. No major deficiencies in 
population PK and exposure-response models were observed.  
Clinical pharmacology is based on population PK and exposure-response models, which appear to be 
adequate for the intended use. Pharmacokinetics of abatacept in the target population is adequately 
summarised in the product information. 
The most recent (year 2018) E-R model for efficacy indicated that MTX use was not a statistically 
significant covariate predicting the JIAACR response and that prior use of TNF-alpha inhibitors was not 
significant covariate and did not affect predicted ACRp responses in subjects with pJIA. 
In conclusion, the pJIA indication for SC abatacept for children 2 to 17 years of age and the change of the 
indication to introduce abatacept monotherapy in case of MTX intolerance or when treatment with MTX is 
inappropriate and for positioning abacacept treatment in second line in the treatment of pJIA (i.e. the 
removal of “following treatment failure with TNF-inhibitors”) for both SC and IV formulations is considered 
acceptable from a clinical pharmacology perspective.

A Phase 3 Multi-center, Open-label Study im101301 to Evaluate Pharmacokinetics, Efficacy, and Safety of 
abatacept Administered Subcutaneously (SC) in Children and Adolescents with Active Polyarticular 
Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (pJIA) and Inadequate Response (IR) to Biologic or Non-biologic Disease 
Modifying Anti-rheumatic Drugs (DMARD). 
Methods 
This was an uncontrolled open-label study to assess PK, efficacy and safety of SC abatacept in pJIA with 
no formal hypothesis testing. The clinical study report presents the final results of the 6 to 17 year-old 
cohort from the 24-month cumulative period (the 4-month short-term [ST] study period plus the

aNon-responders per ACRp30 criteria by month 4 were given the opportunity to be treated with SC abatacept for an additional 3 months in the LTE period. If, after 7 total 
months of treatment, response did not occur, the subject was considered for discontinuation. The study was extended for up to 5 years in some countries by protocol 
amendment to ensure continued dosing for subjects who demonstrate clinical benefit from SC abatacept at the conclusion of the study. 
Figure 8 Study Design 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate if 4 months of a weekly weight-tiered dosing regimen of SC 
abatacept would deliver steady-state systemic exposures within the therapeutic range associated with 
maximal efficacy observed with intravenous (IV) abatacept in the paediatric population. Subjects were 
treated with open-label abatacept for a 4-month ST period and 20 month LTE period and evaluated for PK, 
efficacy, safety and immunogenicity.  The study protocol was amended in some countries to extend the 
study beyond 2 years, up to a total of 7 years.  
Investigators and Study Administrative Structure 
The study was conducted at 50 sites in 12 countries: Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, 
Mexico, Peru, Russian Federation, Spain, South Africa, and US.

Outcomes/endpoints 
The achievement of target therapeutic abatacept concentrations was assessed through Cmin values at 
each pre-specified time point in the cumulative period. 
- Efficacy:  
Efficacy assessments evaluated the mean and median changes from baseline of the ACRp core 
components: number of active joints, number of joints with limited range of motion, physician global 
assessment of disease activity, parent assessment of overall well-being, children’s health assessment 
questionnaire (CHAQ), and C-reactive protein (CRP) level. The proportion of ACRp30, ACRp50, ACRp70, 
ACRp90, and ACRp100 responders and subjects with inactive disease status was also evaluated. Post hoc 
analyses of efficacy were conducted using the JADAS during the cumulative period. 
- Safety:  
Safety assessments were based on medical review of AE reports and the results of vital sign 
measurements and clinical laboratory tests. Safety assessments included AEs, serious adverse events 
(SAEs), deaths, discontinuations due to AEs, and AEs related to clinical laboratory test abnormalities 
reported during the cumulative period safety window. AEs of special interest were assessed throughout 
the study: malignancies, autoimmune disorders, local injection-site AEs, AEs within 24 hours of study 
drug administration, and infections. 
- Immunogenicity and immunological events:  
Pre-dose blood samples for immunogenicity were collected at several points in the cumulative period and 
following the last dose of abatacept administered in the study. The generation of relevant auto-antibodies 
(anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase [GAD], anti-thyroid peroxidase [TPO]), was measured to assess the 
potential for abatacept-induced autoimmune diabetes type 1 or thyroiditis. The potential effect of these 
antibodies on thyroid function was assessed through the measurement of thyroid stimulating hormone 
(TSH). 
- Outcomes Research Assessments:  
Physical function was evaluated using the disability section of the CHAQ, which assesses 8 domains of 
physical function on 5-point scales: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, 
and common activities. A disability index was calculated as the mean of the 8 functional scales. The CHAQ

was completed by the parents. QoL was also evaluated using the ALQ completed by the physician and the 
parents. 
- Tanner Staging:  
Tanner staging was assessed at Day 1 and at the final/early termination visit. These results were 
provided, on request: no clinically significant effects on the children’s development were clearly evident, 
after 2 years of cumulative treatment with abatacept. Results pending final analysis at 24 months. 
Sample size 
A sample size of 160 subjects aged 6 to 17 years was planned for the primary analysis to allow 
assessment of the PK parameters as well as the safety and efficacy of SC abatacept in JIA. The sample 
size approximates the sample size of the 4-month open-label lead-in phase of the original IV JIA 
abatacept study, which allowed an evaluation of the PK, safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of SC in JIA 
abatacept with similar precision as previously obtained for IV abatacept (Period A of Study IM101033). 
Anticipated enrolment of approximately 160 subjects into 3 body weight tiers (10 to < 25 kg, 25 to < 50 
kg, and ≥ 50 kg) ensures that the half-width of 90% confidence interval (CI) for steady state Cminss is 
within 18% of the true population mean for each tier based on a log-transformed standard deviation (SD) 
for steady state Cminss of 0.49 based on population PK modelling. The sample size of 160 subjects also 
allows an estimation of the proportion of ACRp30 responders after 4 months of SC abatacept treatment 
with a precision of 7.4% for the half-width of the 95% CI, assuming an underlying true responder rate of 
64%, which was the responder rate in the IV JIA trial. 
A population of 30 subjects aged 2 to 5 years was predicted to permit descriptive assessments of PK, 
efficacy, and safety response similar to the 6 to 17-year-old cohort.  
As there is no plan for hypothesis testing and no statistical objective per se, no formal sample size 
calculation is foreseen. The data generated is descriptive in nature. The proposed sample size provides 
sufficient precision for the descriptive analysis, and thus appears appropriate. 
Randomisation / Blinding (masking) 
This is not applicable as this was an uncontrolled open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
- Pharmacokinetics:  
Summary statistics (mean, SD, geometric mean and percent coefficient of variation) for Cminss at Day 
113 are provided by weight-tiered dose and subject age.  
- Efficacy:  
The CIs for proportions were computed using the normal approximation, provided that the actual number 
of events was at least 5. The proportion of ACRp30, ACRp50, ACRp70, ACRp90, and ACRp100 responders 
and subjects with inactive disease status were summarized at Day 113 using a point estimate and a 95% 
CI. Missing data was imputed as an ACRp non-responder at all scheduled protocol visits up to Day 113 
subsequent to the point of discontinuation. For other missing values, a non-responder imputation was 
done up to Day 113, except in cases where missing values were between 2 responders.  In that case, a 
response was imputed. Imputed data were included in all analyses of data up to and including that on Day 
113. Beyond Day 113, as-observed analyses. In addition, an ad hoc analysis was performed for the ITT 
population of the 6 to 17-year-old cohort up to Day 729. 
Assessment report  
EMA/126226/2019  
Page 34/100 
 
 
 
Efficacy was also assessed through ad hoc analysis of JADAS27 and JADAS71 scores over time (6 
17-year-old cohort only), as well as the proportion of subjects with JADAS low disease activity and 
remission (both age cohorts). The analysis of JADAS was performed for the ITT population of the 6 to 
17-year-old cohort and for ITT population in 2 to 5-year-old cohort up to Day 113 and as-observed 
beyond Day 113. 
- Safety:  
All treated subjects were included in the safety analysis. The evaluation of drug safety was based on 
clinical AEs and laboratory abnormalities reported during the study.  
- Immunogenicity:  
All treated subjects with at least 1 post-baseline immunogenicity result were included in the 
immunogenicity analysis population. The frequencies of positive immunogenicity responses were 
summarized by antibody specificity by study day, and the corresponding titer values were listed by 
subject and by study day. Listings by subject of efficacy, safety, and PK results for subjects with positive 
immunogenicity response relative to baseline were generated. 
Overall, the statistical methods and analysis appear appropriate for this type of study. 
Results 
Participant flow 
- 6 to 17 year-old:  
Cohort 173 subjects entered the ST period and of these, 157 subjects entered the LTE and 132 subjects 
(76.3%) completed 24 months of treatment. The most common reasons for discontinuation during the 
cumulative period were lack of efficacy (17 subjects, 9.8%) and AEs (7 subjects, 4.0%). Of the 17 
subjects who discontinued due to lack of efficacy, 15 continuously took MTX. There appeared not to be 
any trend on the reasons for discontinuation. The attrition rate appears acceptable for this type of study.  
- 2 to 5 year-old cohort:  
Of the 47 enrolled subjects, 46 subjects were treated and 15 subjects (32.6%) were still on-going in the 
2 year cumulative period at database closure. Seven subjects (15.2%) prematurely discontinued study 
drug. Of these, 5 subjects (10.9%) discontinued due to lack of efficacy: 2 subjects in the ST period (Days 
66 and 86), and 3 subjects in the LTE period (Days 224, 310, and 650). One subject discontinued due to 
AEs of pyrexia, rhinitis, and cough, and another subject requested study drug discontinuation. 
This part of the study is still ongoing, pending evaluation of the final results. Thus, only the partial 
cumulative data is presented from the younger age cohort.  
Recruitment 
Conduct of the study 
There were 14 amendments to the original protocol in study conduct; the CHMP was of the opinion that 
they don’t have a significant effect on the results of the study. The presented protocol deviations appear 
to be minor and unlikely to have a significant impact on the efficacy or present a safety risk to the 
subjects.

Table 9 Baseline Disease Characteristics - All Treated Subjects – 6 to 17-Year-old Age Cohort 
Baseline is Day 1 of the study or last measurement prior to short-term dose. 
The duration of pJIA in the study population ranged from 0 to 15 years, with the majority (59.0%) of 
subjects experiencing JIA for ≤ 2 years. The most frequent categories of disease at onset in the 6 to 
17-year-old cohort met the criteria for pJIA: polyarthritis RF- (54.3%), polyarthritis RF+ (26.6%), 
extended oligoarthritis (11.0%), and systemic arthritis (2.9%). Four subjects (2.3%) entered the study 
with persistent oligoarthritis in violation of the study criteria. No subjects with PsA entered the study in 
this cohort.  
The majority of subjects (136 subjects, 78.6%) were taking methotrexate (MTX) at baseline. Relative to 
body size, mean (SD) MTX dose was 0.388 (0.177) mg/kg/week (12.0 [4.3] mg/m2/week). Prior to 
enrolment, 26.6% of subjects took a biologic DMARD.

Table 10 Selected Baseline Demographic and Disease Characteristics 
Previous Treatments:  
As per inclusion criteria, subjects received prior nonbiologic DMARD, TNF-alpha antagonist, or other 
biologic DMARD therapy for JIA. Prior to enrolment, nearly all subjects took MTX (94.8%) and 26.6% of 
subjects took a biologic DMARD.  
At baseline, subjects were restricted from taking biologic DMARDs, and MTX and corticosteroids doses 
were stabilized for those subjects taking these drugs. Those subjects who took MTX had a mean (SD) dose 
of 12.0 (4.3) mg/m2/week. Washout of excluded biologic and nonbiologic DMARDs (except for MTX) had 
occurred for all but 2 subjects at baseline. On Day 1, one subject took chloroquine and sulfasalazine, and 
one took cyclosporine (oral). Because a 4-week washout period was not enacted prior to the first dose of 
the study drug, these 2 instances were classified as significant protocol deviations. However, these 2 
subjects stopped taking these drugs by Day 1 or 2 of the study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/126226/2019  
Page 38/100 
 
 
 
 
Other deviations related to prior or concomitant medications include 2 subjects who were enrolled but did 
not have prior insufficient response to at least 1 biologic or nonbiologic DMARD and one additional subject 
who was restarted on MTX during the ST period. 
Concomitant therapy:  
During the ST period, subjects were allowed to remain on stable doses of MTX, corticosteroids, or NSAIDs 
if they were taking these anti-rheumatic medications at baseline. No other anti-rheumatic medications 
were allowed during the ST period.  
Prior to enrolment, 94,8% of subjects took methotrexate (MTX) and 26.6% of subjects took biologic 
DMARD. The majority of subjects (78.6% of subjects) took MTX during the ST period. The mean 
methotrexate dose (mean (SD) MTX dose was 0.388 (0.177) mg/kg/week (12.0 [4.3] mg/m2/week), 
which appears adequate (usual dose range 10-15 mg/m2 per week). There were some deviations on the 
prior and concomitant medication use. However, these are not considered significant and are not 
expected to affect the results or inferences.  
Extent of Exposure:  
In the ST period, the mean (SD) duration of exposure to SC abatacept was 114.9 (12.22) days, with 172 
of 173 subjects with ≥ 90 days of exposure. The majority (95.4%) of 6 to 17 year old subjects received 
13 to 16 SC injections, and the median number of injections was 16. 
Treatment compliance with investigational treatment was high during the ST period with over 90 % of 
subjects with no (82,6%) or one (12,1%) missed injection. 
Discontinuation of Study Therapy During the ST period:  
11 subjects from the 6 to17-year-old cohort discontinued. 
Cumulative 2 to 5 Year-old Cohort  
The objective of the study in the 2 to 5-year-old cohort was to evaluate the long-term effects of 
treatment; consequently, results for this cohort are presented only for the entire cumulative period 
(combined ST and long-term extension [LTE] periods) from baseline up to database closure. For this 
cohort only partial cumulative data has overall been provided as the 2 year cumulative period is still 
ongoing. The post treatment data is also pending.  
Baseline/Demographic Characteristics: 
Demographics At study entry (Day 1), all treated subjects were within the 2 to 5-year age range, with a 
mean (SD) age of 4.1 (1.0) years. The majority of treated subjects were white (44/46, 95.7%), female 
(28/46, 60.9%), and weighed < 25 kg (43/46, 93.5%) at baseline. 
Exposure: 
As of the date of database closure, subjects were still continuing in the 20 months LTE period. For the 46 
subjects who entered into the study, the mean (SD) exposure to SC abatacept over the cumulative period 
was 18.8 (7.26) months with a median duration of 24.1 months. Subjects received a median of 98 SC 
injections during the cumulative period.  
Discontinuations: 
Seven subjects in the 2 to 5-year-old cohort discontinued study drug during the 2 year cumulative period. 
Five subjects discontinued due to lack of efficacy; 1 discontinued due to AEs of pyrexia, rhinitis, and 
cough; and 1 subject requested to discontinue study treatment.  
Assessment report  
EMA/126226/2019  
Page 39/100 
 
 
 
Baseline Disease Characteristics: 
At baseline, study subjects met the criteria for polyarticular disease. The duration of pJIA in the study 
population ranged from 0 through 4 years, with the majority (42/46, 91.3%) of subjects experiencing 
JIA for ≤  2 years. The mean (SD) number of active joints was 9.3 (6.0) and the mean (SD) number of 
joints with LOM was 8.7 (5.6). 
Mean baseline measurements were of the CHAQ (1.08, on a scale of 0-3), Parent Global Assessment (38.6 
mm,  on a scale  of  0-100 mm),  and  Physician Global Assessment (47.1 mm, on a scale of 0-100 mm), 
where higher scores in each measurement indicate higher disease activity. Mean (SD) CRP levels were .33 
(2.42)  mg/dL and ranged  from 0.10 mg/dL to 11.30 mg/dL.  
The  categories  of  disease  onset  in  the  2  to  5-year-old  cohort  met  the  criteria  for  pJIA: polyarthritis 
RF- (29/46, 63.0%), extended oligoarthritis (10/46, 21.7%), psoriatic arthritis (4/46, 8.7%),  and 
polyarthritis RF+ (3/46, 6.5%).  No subjects presented with systemic arthritis, undifferentiated arthritis, 
or persistent oligoarthritis. 
Baseline Methotrexate Dose: 
Most subjects (37/46) were taking MTX at baseline. Relative to body size, baseline mean (SD) MTX dose 
per week was 12.9 (3.8) mg/m2 body surface area (0.531 [0.172] mg/kg body weight). The mean (SD) 
total MTX dose per week was 9.5 (2.9) mg/week and ranged from 1.0 mg/week through 15.0 mg/week. 
The observed range of baseline MTX doses (1.2 through 22.9 mg/m2/week) was comparable to the MTX 
dose range suggested in the study inclusion criteria (10 to 30 mg/m2/week). 
Previous Treatments: 
As per inclusion criteria, subjects had received nonbiologic DMARDs, TNF-alpha antagonist, or other 
biologic therapy for JIA before enrolling in this study. All but 1 subject (45/46, 97.8%) had taken MTX, 17 
subjects (37.0%) had taken oral corticosteroids, and 10 subjects (21.7%) had taken a biologic DMARD 
(etanercept, adalimumab, or tocilizumab). 
At baseline, subjects were restricted from taking biologic DMARDs. MTX and corticosteroid doses were 
stabilized for those subjects taking these drugs. By Day 1, washout of excluded biologic and nonbiologic 
DMARDs (except for MTX) and standardization of corticosteroid dose in study subjects were achieved. 
Those subjects who took MTX at baseline had a mean (SD) dose of 12.9 (3.8) mg/m2/week. No subjects 
concomitantly took biologic DMARDs or nonbiologic DMARD (other than MTX) when first receiving study 
drug. 
Concomitant Therapy During the Cumulative Period (2 to 5-Year-Old Cohort): 
During the study, subjects were allowed to remain on stable doses of MTX, corticosteroids, or NSAIDs if 
they were taking these anti-rheumatic medications at baseline. No other anti-rheumatic medications 
were allowed during the study. 
Subjects adhered to the study criteria for excluded therapies. All 37 MTX users at Day 1 remained on MTX 
at the time of database closure. The three subjects who began use of excluded biologic DMARDs after Day 
1 did so after discontinuation from the study drug but within the 56-day post-treatment observation   
period. Thirteen subjects initiated use of corticosteroids after Day 1.  
Other therapeutic classes of concomitant medications taken by > 10% of subjects were typical for this 
patient population.

Cumulative 6 to 17 year-old cohort 
Extent of Exposure during the Cumulative Period for the 173 subjects who entered into the study, the 
mean (SD) exposure to SC abatacept over the cumulative period was 21.8 (6.87) months with a median 
exposure of 24.3 months (range of 1.9 to28.0 months).  Most subjects (129/173) had at least 24 months 
of abatacept exposure during the cumulative period. Subjects received a median of 102 SC injections 
during the cumulative period. The majority of subjects received at least 97 injections (122/173, 70.5%).

Of the 219 treated subjects, 205 completed the ST period and 200 subjects entered the LTE period. In the 
6 to 17 year-old cohort, the majority of subjects reached the primary endpoint at Day 113 (95%), 
continued into the LTE period, and completed the LT period (76%). In the 2 to 5 year-old cohort, 
15 subjects were still ongoing in the LTE period at the time of database lock. 
A total of 19.6% of subjects (15.2% in the 2 to 5 year-old cohort and 20.8% of in the 6 to 17 year-old 
cohort) discontinued during the study cumulative period, the main reason being lack of efficacy. The 
timing of discontinuation due to lack of efficacy appeared to have no obvious pattern in either cohort. 
At database closure, the median length of abatacept exposure was 24.1 months for the 2 to 5 year-old 
cohort and 24.3 months for the 6 to 17 year-old cohort.  
In total, in the 6 to 17 years old cohort, 36 subjects discontinued during the cumulative period: 11 
discontinued in the ST period, and 25 subjects discontinued in the LTE period). The most common reason 
for discontinuation in the cumulative period was a lack of efficacy (17 subjects) or AEs (7 subjects). In 
addition, after completing the ST period, 5 subjects elected to not enter the LTE period.

Measurements of Treatment Compliance:  
The high treatment compliance seen in the ST period continued through the LTE period. 
Concomitant Therapy During the Cumulative Period: 
During the cumulative period, subjects were allowed to remain on stable doses of MTX, corticosteroids, or 
NSAIDs if these subjects were taking these anti-rheumatic medications prior to Day 1. No other 
anti-rheumatic medications were allowed during the cumulative period. A summary of anti-rheumatic 
medications used up to 56 days past the last dose of SC abatacept during the cumulative period is 
provided in the table below. Similar proportions of subjects took MTX (80.9%) and/or NSAIDs (83.2%), 
while 44.5% of all 6 to 17-year-old subjects took oral corticosteroids during the study. 
During the cumulative period, 11 subjects were reported as taking prohibited DMARDs concomitantly and 
were included in the study and analyses up to the last SC injection plus 56 days.

6 to 17-year-old cohort  
PK results:  
A weekly weight-tiered SC abatacept dosing regimen achieved the desired target therapeutic Cmin (≥ 10 
µg/mL) in 130 of 131 evaluable PK subjects. The geometric mean Cminss value for the evaluable PK 
population at Day 113 was 39.7 µg/mL. Similar Cminss levels were observed at Day 57 and Day 85. 
The observed Cminss values in the 6 to 17-year-old cohort were similar to or higher than the 
model-predicted values and were lower than the maximal Cmin for SC abatacept observed in adult 
subjects with RA (113.8 µg/mL). 
Subgroup analyses of Cmin were conducted to evaluate the effect of weight-tiered doses on steady-state 
trough exposures. From Day 57 through Day 113, mean and median Cminss levels of abatacept were 
above the target concentration (10 µg/mL) and comparable across dose tiers in the 6 to 17-year-old 
evaluable PK population. The Cminss ranges among the 3 dose tiers at Day 113 mostly overlapped except 
for the few subjects with high or low Cminss.

Secondary Efficacy Endpoint:  
The secondary efficacy objective was an assessment of ACRp30 response at Day 113. ACRp30 responses 
were observed by Day 29 (103/173, 59.5%), gradually increased to 80.9% (140/173) at Day 85, and 
remained at this level at Day 113. In study IM101033 the respective values were at Day 113; n=123; 
64.7% for ACRp30 and for the more stringent variables: ACRp50 94 (49.5%), ACRp70, 54 (28.4%),

Comparison Between Efficacy of SC and IV Abatacept in Polyarticular JIA 
The ACRp30, ACRp50, and ACRp70 responder results at Day 113 show the efficacy of both routes of 
administration in pJIA. 
Table 16 Proportion of Subjects with ACRp Responses at Day 113 in Studies IM101301 and IM101033 
ITT with non-responder imputation 
In comparison of the two paediatric studies overall higher values were seen for the ACRp30, ACRp50, and 
ACRp70 responses in SC abatacept-treated subjects (Study IM101301) compared with IV 
abatacept-treated subjects (Study IM101033). The reason for this was not readily evident. According to 
the MAH, review of the baseline characteristics did not reveal any clear evidence. However, the results in 
both studies showed acceptable efficacy on exposure surpassing the target threshold of Cminss of > 10 
µg/mL. 
Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints for the ST Period (6 to 17-Year-Old Cohort)  
ACR Paediatric Responses During the ST Period:  
The proportions of ACRp50 and ACRp70 responders increased and plateaued at Day 85: 71.7% (124/173) 
and 54.9% (95/173), respectively. These proportions of responses remained at these levels through Day 
113. The proportions of subjects meeting the ACRp90, ACRp100, and inactive disease criteria increased 
throughout the ST period.

Up to Day 113, a non-responder imputation, except if missing measurement between 2 time points for which a response is observed. In that case a responder 
is imputed. Inactive disease status is defined as no active joints, physician's global assessment of disease severity <=10 mm and CRP <= 0.6 mg/dL. 
Subgroup Analyses of Efficacy During the ST Period (6 to 17-Year-Old Cohort) 
The weekly weight-tiered SC abatacept dosing strategy was associated with similar proportions of JIA 
ACRp30 responders at Day 113 among  subgroups in each  evaluated  category, including weight-tiered 
dose, age, JIA subtype, concomitant MTX use, prior exposure to biologic DMARDs, baseline CRP (post hoc 
analysis),  and  Day  113  Cminss  tertiles  (post  hoc  analysis). 
Some JIA disease subgroups were small in number and therefore results should be interpreted with care; 
however, consistent response to SC abatacept treatment was observed at Day 113 among subjects in the 
different JIA disease subgroups. Although small differences between subgroups were noted, JIA ACR30 
responses were 75% through 100% in the polyarthritis and extended oligoarthritis subgroups. Response 
to SC abatacept among the few subjects with enthesitis-related  arthritis,  systemic  JIA,  and  persistent 
oligoarthritis  was  similar  to  that  of  the overall population. 
The impact of demographic and clinical parameters, such as prior use of biologic DMARDS, use of MTX, 
and baseline levels of acute phase reactants (CRP), was assessed. No single parameter seemed to have 
an effect on the therapeutic response to SC abatacept.  
The proportions of JIA ACR30 responders with concomitant MTX use or prior use of biologic DMARDs were 
generally similar to those of MTX non-users or subjects who were naive to biologic DMARDs. In a post 
Assessment report  
EMA/126226/2019

hoc  assessment, similar proportions of subjects with normal or elevated baseline CRP levels were 
responders. 
To  account for abatacept exposure in efficacy, response to SC abatacept treatment  was assessed by 
tertile of Day 113 serum abatacept Cminss level in a post hoc analysis. The proportions of responders 
among  the  tertiles  were  similar  across  all  3  tertiles,  confirming  that  the  targeted 10 µg/mL  trough 
concentration  represents  the lower limit of exposure  at  steady state that  is associated with abatacept 
response.

QoL for subjects was assessed from the numbers of days per month of missed activity, paid care, and 
missed school from the ALQ. At baseline, the mean (SD) values, respectively, for these measures were 
4.3 (6.38), 1.7 (5.07), and 3.0 (4.55) days. During treatment in the ST period, the mean numbers of days 
per month of missed activity, paid care, and missed school, respectively, decreased from baseline by the 
following values: Day 57 (n = 168 to 170): -2.1, -0.6, and -1.6 days Day 113 (n = 164 to 166): -3.0, -1.1, 
and -2.2 days. 
Results for the cumulative period 
Cumulative 2 to 5 Year old Cohort 
Pharmacokinetic Results 
Cmin values for the 2 to 5-year-old cohort were consistent with those of the 6 to 17-year-old cohort and 
above the target efficacious range (> 10 µg/mL) for most subjects at each time point. Mean trough values 
remained stable from Day 57 throughout Day 729. The geometric mean abatacept Cmin value was 47.1 
µg/mL on Day 57, 49.5 µg/mL on Day 113, 39.8 µg/mL on Day 309, and 59.1 µg/mL on Day 729. The 
majority of the Cmin levels for the five subjects who discontinued from study drug due to lack of efficacy 
were similar to the geometric mean Cmin abatacept levels of the remaining subjects and above the target 
therapeutic Cmin level (≥ 10 µg/mL).

Consistent with the results for the 6 to 17 year-old cohort, the proportions of ACRp30, ACRp50, ACRp70, 
ACRp90, ACRp100 responders, and subjects with inactive disease in the 2 to 5-year-old cohort increased 
during the cumulative period up to Day 197, when the response rates appeared to plateau (Figure below).

ACRp30 response increased from 65.2% at Day 29 to 89.1% at Day 113 and was 95.3% by Day 197. 
Responses were maintained throughout the cumulative period. By Day 729, responder rates were 100% 
for ACRp30, ACRp50, and ACRp70; 90.9% for ACRp90; and 77.3% for ACRp100 and inactive disease.

Each of the ACRp30 core set variables showed improvement from baseline with SC abatacept treatment. 
No single set of components dominated the composite results for the ACRp30 responses. Active joints, 
joints with LOM, and physician’s global assessment of disease severity improved from baseline. Most of 
the improvement in these 3 variables was observed in the first and second months of treatment, followed 
by more gradual mean improvement for those subjects with longer exposure to abatacept.

Scores for the parental assessment of overall well-being and CHAQ exhibited similar trends, with mean 
improvement of 46.5% and 36.8%, respectively, from baseline to Day 309, and 24.3% and 36.4% mean 
improvement, respectively, from baseline to Day 729. Most of the improvement in both measures had 
occurred by Day 85, and mean scores continued to improve gradually up to Year 2. 
Improvement in JADAS27 low disease activity and remission and JADAS71 low disease activity and 
remission was also observed over time during the cumulative period. The proportion of subjects with 
JADAS27 and JADAS71 low disease activity and remission increased throughout the study. On Day 729, 
approximately 90% of subjects met the criteria for JADAS27 and JADAS71 low disease activity, and 50% 
had achieved JADAS27 and JADAS71 remission. 
QoL for subjects was measured by the numbers of days per month of missed activity, paid care, and 
missed school from the ALQ. These QoL measurements improved during the cumulative period up to Day 
113 and then remained relatively stable. 
Cumulative 6 to 17 year old cohort  
Pharmacokinetic Results  
Cmin values for the 6 to 17-year-old cohort were above the target efficacious range (≥ 10 µg/mL) in 130 
of 131 evaluable PK subjects at Day 113. The geometric mean Cmin value for the evaluable PK population 
at Day 113 was 39.7 µg/mL. Similar Cmin levels were observed at Day 57 and Day 85. Mean trough 
values remained stable from Day 57 throughout Day 729. Geometric mean Cmin values remained ≥ 30 
µg/mL during the cumulative period after achievement of steady state at Day 85. Individual Cmin levels 
remained consistently above the desired 10 µg/mL threshold beyond Day 113 for the subsets of subjects 
with longer abatacept exposures. Cmin values were similar across the weight- tiered doses at Day 113, 
suggesting exposure was similar for all weight groups.

Each of the ACRp30 core set variables showed improvement from baseline with SC abatacept treatment. 
No single set of components dominated the composite results for the ACRp30 responses. Active joints, 
joints with limitation of motion (LOM), and physician’s global assessment of disease severity improved 
from baseline. Most of the improvement in these 3 variables was observed in the first and second months 
of treatment, followed by more gradual mean improvement for those subjects with longer exposure to 
abatacept. 
Table 23 Mean Improvement in JRA/JIA Core Set Variable Results Over Time – 6 to 17-Year-old Age Cohort 
Scores for the parental assessment of overall well-being and CHAQ exhibited similar trends, with 39.6% 
and 46.9% mean improvements, respectively, from baseline to Day 309, and 56.8% and 57.8% mean 
improvements, respectively, from baseline to Day 729. Most of the improvement in both measures had 
occurred by Day 85, and mean scores continued to improve gradually up to Year 2.  
Post hoc analyses were conducted for the ITT population of the 6 through 17-year-old cohort: subjects 
with missing data for any reason were imputed as non-responders. The results were consistent with the 
results of the analyses based on observed data, with response increasing up to Day 113 and remaining 
generally stable up to Day 645. Thereafter, at Day 729 a large number of subjects had missing efficacy 
data and, consequently, the responder rates at this time point were lower than those for the observed 
data analysis due to the imputation of non-response for missing data. At the CHMP’s request, the MAH 
clarified that this phenomenon was unrelated to discontinuation for lack of efficacy.   
The results for JADAS27 and JADAS71 low disease activity and remission also followed a similar pattern, 
with increasing rates over time through Day 645 that decreased due to missing data at Day 729. Median

JADAS27 and JADAS71 scores decreased over time during the cumulative period, reflecting reductions in 
JIA-associated disability. Median baseline JADAS27 and JADAS71 scores of 19.08 and 21.04, 
respectively, had declined to 1.25 and 1.30, respectively, by Day 729.  
None of the demographic and clinical parameters, such as prior use of biologic DMARDS, use of MTX, and 
baseline levels of acute phase reactants (CRP), appeared to have an effect on the response to SC 
abatacept throughout the cumulative period. 
Quality of life (QoL) for subjects was measured by the numbers of days per month of missed activity, paid 
care, and missed school from the ALQ. These QoL measurements improved during the cumulative period 
up to Day 113 and then remained relatively stable thereafter throughout the 2-year abatacept treatment 
period. 
Subgroup Analysis of Efficacy During the Cumulative Period - 6 to 17 Year Old Cohort 
The subgroup analyses of efficacy conducted during the cumulative period were based on the ITT 
population and imputed non-responder status in cases of missing data. Consistent with the results of the 
subgroup analysis during the ST period, none of the demographic and clinical parameters, such as prior 
use of biologic DMARDS, use of MTX, and baseline levels of acute phase reactants (CRP), appeared to 
have a significant effect on the response to SC abatacept throughout the cumulative period.

Abatacept Cmin Among Subjects with Serious Infections, Malignancies, or Autoimmune Disorders Among 
subjects with serious infections, possible opportunistic infections, malignancies, or autoimmune 
disorders, Cmin at the time of AE onset were within 1 to 2 SD of the mean Cmin at the nearest day of 
measurement. Opportunistic infections were rare during the study, and Cmin levels for these subjects 
were comparable to the population mean.

Geometric mean Cmin values remained ≥30 µg/mL during the cumulative period after achievement of 
steady state  at  Day 85.  Individual  Cmin  levels  remained  consistently above  the desired  10 ≥g/mL 
threshold  beyond  Day  113  for  the  subsets  of  subjects  with  longer  abatacept exposures. 
The proportions of ACRp30, ACRp50, ACRp70, ACRp90, ACRp100, and inactive disease responders 
increased during the cumulative period up to Day 309, when the response rates appeared to plateau. By 
Day 729, the proportions of ACRp30 and ACRp50 responders were 92.7% and 89.0%, respectively; the 
proportion of ACRp70 responders was 83.5%; and the proportions of ACRp90, ACRp100, and inactive 
disease responders were 65.1%, 45.0%, and 57.9%, respectively.  
Abatacept with or without concomitant mtx use  
Baseline data  
To interpret the validity of similar efficacy in subgroups of subjects treated with abatacept with MTX and 
without MTX in both Studies IM101033 and IM101301 analysis of the possible effect of baseline 
characteristics was further studied. In both the IV study IM101033 and the SC study IM101301, and when 
comparing results of adult RA trials IM101173 and IM101029 to the pJIA studies, the baseline 
characteristics were overall similar in the subgroups of subjects treated with MTX and without MTX, 
excepting that geographic region and higher percentage of subjects treated with abatacept monotherapy 
were prior biologic users. Clinical response was shown to be similar within each geographic region and 
disease status, assessed by active joints and CRP values, and within the subgroups with and without prior 
biologic use, in both studies. Overall, it can be concluded that no clinically meaningful, potentially 
confounding imbalances according to MTX use, were clearly evident. The Cmin values in the adult studies 
also showed comparable exposure for the subgroups of subjects treated with abatacept with or without 
MTX.  In additional PK/PD simulations, by comparing the differences between JIAACR responses rates 
with and without MTX co-treatment, according to weight groups, no clear trends were evident, but 
numbers in tiers were too small for firm conclusions.

Efficacy 
The clinical response to abatacept in pJIA patients treated with abatacept monotherapy and abatacept on 
the background of MTX was studied in several settings. The ACRp30, ACRp50, ACRp70, and ACRp90 
response results at Day 113 showed overall and consistently similar and acceptable efficacy, in both the 
IV and SC trials in pJIA. Importantly, similar acceptable efficacy on exposure surpassing the target 
threshold was also seen between subjects who received abatacept with MTX and those on abatacept 
monotherapy, in each age cohort, the combined cohort and at each ACRp response level.

Consistently, no meaningful differences were seen when the clinical responses of subjects on 
monotherapy due to MTX intolerance or due to lack of efficacy were compared to abatacept with MTX 
results of both pJIA studies. No formal between-study comparison has been performed that compares the 
efficacy of abatacept + MTX to the efficacy of abatacept monotherapy due to prior MTX intolerance or due 
to LOE in subjects with pJIA.

Period B of the IV study IM101033 was a randomized, placebo-controlled withdrawal period for subjects 
who had a clinical response at the end of Period A. At 6 months of Period B, the flare rate of subjects who 
received abatacept monotherapy versus placebo without MTX (25.0%, 56.3%) was similar to the flare 
rate of subjects who received abatacept with MTX versus placebo + MTX (18.8% 52.2%). Subjects who 
received abatacept monotherapy and subjects who received abatacept + MTX had similar flare rates. 
Similarly, subjects who received placebo monotherapy and placebo with MTX had similar flare rates. 
Abatacept with or without Prior Biologic Failure – second line therapeutic 
positioning  
Baseline 
Analyses of subjects on prior biologic therapy can be taken to be similar to the analyses of subjects on 
prior TNF alfa inhibitor therapy, as most of the subjects were indeed treated with a TNF alfa inhibitor in 
both pJIA studies (57/58 in the IV pJIA study and 53/56 in the SC pJIA study). On the other hand, 
subjects who failed prior biologic therapy, include subjects who were intolerant to biologics and subjects 
who had lack of efficacy on biologic therapy.

Ancillary analyses 
Addendum to Clinical Study Report IM101301  
Additional analyses were presented in the Addendum to the study IM101301: subgroup analysis for the 
primary exposure endpoint Cmin on weight tiers and age strata, was performed (combining the two age 
pJIA cohorts) on data from the ST period from the evaluable PK population: the results were supportive 
of the main results of the study Cmin values reaching the target values and showing generally consistent 
results on weight tiers at each time-point up to Day 113 the geometric mean values ranging from 33.0 to 
45.1. Cmin values at Day 113 across three age subgroups (2 to 5 years, 6 to 11 years, and ≥ 12 years) 
were also comparable.  
Other studies 
A vaccination sub study in paediatric pJIA patients 2 to 5 years of age was included in the study IM101301 
protocol, as agreed in the SC PIP. It showed that in 26 of the total of 29 patients, abatacept at the given 
weight-tiered dose appeared not to inhibit response to immunisation. Thus, based on this limited amount 
of pJIA patients, it appears that abatacept does not significantly interfere with the specific antibody 
response to administered diphtheria and tetanus vaccines. This is in line with previous data (IM101174 
and IM101185), which showed that healthy volunteers treated with a single dose and RA patients on 
abatacept treatment are able to mount an immune response to the vaccines. No label claims or 
amendments are sought or needed on these data.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In line with the agreed PIP, the only clinical trial data comes from the pivotal uncontrolled open label 
clinical study IM101301, which included two cohorts of subjects with active polyarticular JIA and 
subcutaneous abatacept treatment: 46 patients at 2 to 5 years of age and 176 patients at 6 to 17 years 
of age. Subjects were treated open-label weight tiered abatacept for a 4-month Short Term period (ST). 
Subjects who completed the ST period were given the option to enter a 20-month Long Term Extension 
period (LTE) during which they continued to receive weekly SC abatacept injections. Subjects who 
entered the LTE period as non-responders per ACRp30 criteria were given the opportunity to be treated 
with SC abatacept for an additional 3 months.  
Treatment was discontinued if an individual subject did not achieve ACRp30 response after a total of 
7 months of abatacept therapy (4-month ST period plus 3 months of LTE period). All subjects who 
received a dose of abatacept, regardless of the date of discontinuation, were scheduled to participate in 
a follow-up period of 168 days post-treatment for safety and immunogenicity monitoring. The data was 
presented up to year 2 of the study (ST period of 4 months plus a LTE period of 20 months). The study was 
further extended for up to 5 years in some EU countries extending up to 7 years of treatment with 
abatacept in 2 to 17 year old subjects with pJIA. 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria were relevant and typical for this type of study. These criteria are very 
similar to those of the IV pivotal study, with the exceptions that subjects with enthesitis-related arthritis 
(n=3-4 accrued) or PsA were also targeted (n=4 accrued). 
The main primary and secondary objectives are in line with the agreed SC PIP and the revised protocol. 
In the younger age cohort, the primary objective (abatacept steady-state trough serum concentrations 
[Cminss] at Day 113) was not assessed and the secondary objectives included only safety and 
immunogenicity. This has implications on the presentation and comparability of the results from the two 
cohorts. The exploratory objectives were assessed in both age cohorts. 
The chosen outcome measures of the efficacy and the safety analysis are well accepted and widely used. 
Cminss was chosen as it was the most statistically significant abatacept exposure parameter describing 
the exposure-response relationship for efficacy. The outcome measures for efficacy are validated and 
were overall comparable with those of the open-label 4-month induction period A of the IV pivotal study 
IM101033.  
The design and conduct of the pivotal study were acceptable to the CHMP. 
The 2 year cumumative period in 2-5 years patients is still ongoing, pending evaluation of the final 
results. For this cohort only partial 2 year cumulative data has overall been provided as the study is still 
ongoing. The post treatment data is also pending. The MAH should submit the final results (24-month and 
5-year data) of the Study IM101301 as a category 3 measure of the RMP. See RMP Section 2.8. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
PK and efficacy of abatacept in the treatment of pJIA was assessed with well accepted and validated 
outcome measures in this open label study. Main outcomes evaluated the mean and median changes from 
baseline.  
ST period 
In the short term period of the study IM101301 (6 Through 17 Year-old Cohort), with the weekly 
weight-tiered SC abatacept dose the targeted Cmin (≥ 10 µg/mL) was achieved in 130 of 131 evaluable 
Assessment report  
EMA/126226/2019  
Page 59/100 
 
 
 
PK with geometric mean Cminss value 39.7 µg/mL at day 113. Similar Cminss levels were observed at 
Day 57 and Day 85. These observed values were similar to or higher than the model-predicted values (see 
PK section 2.4) and were lower than the maximal Cmin for SC abatacept observed in adult subjects with 
RA (113.8 µg/mL), as also targeted.   
ACRp30 (n, %) responses were observed by Day 29 (103/173, 59.5%), gradually increasing to 80.9% 
(140/173) at Day 85, and remained at this level at Day 113. In study IM101033: Day A113; n=123; 
64.7% had ACRP30 response and for the more stringent variables: ACRp50 94 (49.5%), ACRp70, 54 
(28.4%), ACRp90, 24 (12.6%). 
The results on the exploratory variables and subgroup (among them weight-tiered dose subgroups, age 
subgroups, prior exposure to biologic DMARDs, concomitant MTX use, the pJIA subtypes, and all 
non-systemic subjects with pJIA Day 113, post hoc analysis of Cminss tertiles) analyses supported the 
main results at D113, although some subgroups were too small in numbers for firm conclusion. Overall, 
the target exposure was reached and therapeutic efficacy of weight tired dose regime of abatacept seems 
to be maintained up till D113 in this study. There is no evidence for loss of efficacy. 
Concomitant MTX use appears not to have a significant effect on efficacy. The ACRp30 response 
proportions at Day 113 were 78.7% (107/136) for the MTX users and 89.2% (33/37) for those who were 
not on concomitant MTX. This is in line with the modelling data.  
In comparison of the two paediatric studies overall higher values were seen for the ACRp30, ACRp50, and 
ACRp70 responses in SC abatacept-treated subjects (Study IM101301) compared with IV 
abatacept-treated subjects (Study IM101033). No clear reasoning could be found to explain these results. 
However, the results in both studies showed acceptable efficacy in general on exposure surpassing the 
target threshold of Cminss of > 10 ≥g/mL.  
Cumulative period 
2 to 5 year-old cohort 
In comparison with the older 6 to 17 age cohort, apart from the age and weight related difference in the 
baseline  data  of  the  2  to  5  year  age  cohort,  the  demographic  and  the  disease  related  baseline 
characteristics appear similar. The majority of treated subjects were white (44/46, 95.7%) and female 
(28/46, 60.9%). Although the younger population, overall, may have a slightly less severe disease this is 
not expected to significantly affect the results or the comparability of data.   
Of the originally 46 treated pJIA patients, 24 have completed the 24-month cumulative period and for 15 
the 2 year cumulative period is currently still ongoing. The current mean (SD) exposure to SC abatacept 
in this 2 to 5 year old subgroup over the cumulative period, i.e. up to 24 months, was 18.8 (7.26) months 
with a median duration of 24.1 months, and subjects received a median of 98 SC injections. 
Acknowledging these uncertainties of the data, the Cmin values for the 2 to 5-year-old cohort were above 
target (≥ 10 µg/mL) for most subjects at each time point. Mean trough values remained stable from Day 
57 throughout Day 729. Abatacept remained within the range of exposures observed with SC abatacept 
in adults with RA: the geometric mean abatacept Cmin value was 47.1 µg/mL on Day 57, 49.5 µg/mL on 
Day 113, 39.8 µg/mL on Day 309, and 59.1 µg/mL on Day 729. The maximal values of the range were 
slightly  higher  than  those  found  in  the  older  population,  but  remained  in  the  target  range  i.e.  not 
exceeding those in adults with RA.  
Consistent with the results for the 6 to 17 year-old cohort, the proportions of ACRp30, ACRp50, ACRp70, 
ACRp90,  ACRp100  responders,  and  subjects  with  inactive  disease  in  the  2  through  5-year-old  cohort 
increased during the cumulative period up to Day 197, when the response rates appeared to plateau. 
ACRp30 response increased from 65.2% at Day 29 to 89.1% at Day 113 and was 95.3% by Day 197. 
Assessment report  
EMA/126226/2019  
Page 60/100 
 
 
 
Responses were maintained throughout the cumulative period. By Day 729, responder rates were 100% 
for ACRp30, ACRp50, and ACRp70; 90.9% for ACRp90; and 77.3% for ACRp100 and inactive disease. 
Results of the exploratory analyses were supportive of these data. Overall, these results were comparable 
to those of the older age cohort. 
It is acknowledged that the interpretation of the results on the treatment outcome is hampered by the 
small number of patients in this subpopulation (2 to 5 year age cohort) and by the fact that the study is 
still ongoing.  
At the CHMP’s request, the MAH has added “Long-term safety in 2 to 5 year old patients with pJIA” and 
“Immunogenicity in paediatric patients” as Missing information in the RMP. Additional PhV activities have 
also been put in place in the RMP (submission of the final results (24-month and 5-year data) of the Study 
IM101301 and the on-going registry study IM101240, see RMP Section 2.8).  
6 to 17 year-old cohort 
The cumulative data from study IM101301 for 6 to 17-year-old cohort was overall consistent with the data 
from the ST period and showed that weekly weight-tiered SC abatacept dosing delivered target Cmin 
values for the 6 to 17-year-old cohort were above the target therapeutic exposures (> 10 µg/mL) in 130 
of 131 evaluable PK subjects at Day 113. The geometric mean Cmin value for the evaluable PK population 
at Day 113 was 39.7 µg/mL. Similar Cmin levels were observed at Day 57 and Day 85. Mean trough 
values remained stable from Day 57 throughout Day 729. Geometric mean Cmin values remained ≥ 30 
µg/mL during the cumulative period after achievement of steady state at Day 85. Individual Cmin levels 
remained consistently above the desired 10 µg/mL threshold beyond Day 113 for the subsets of subjects 
with longer abatacept exposures. Cmin values were similar across the weight- tiered doses at Day 113, 
suggesting exposure was similar for all weight groups. 
Proportions of ACRp30, ACRp50, ACRp70, ACRp90, ACRp100, and inactive disease responders increased 
during the cumulative period up to Day 309, when the response rates appeared to plateau. By Day 729, 
the proportions of ACRp30, ACRp50 and ACR70 were 92.7%, 89.0%, and 83.5%, respectively, and the 
proportions  of  ACRp90,  ACRp100,  and  inactive  disease  responders  were  65.1%,  45.0%,  and  57.9%, 
respectively.  
Results of post hoc analyses (missing efficacy data imputed as non-responder) of ACR response for the 
ITT population were consistent with the results of the analyses based on observed data after Day 113, 
with response increasing up to Day 113 and remaining generally stable up to Day 645. Thereafter the 
number of subjects with data at Day 729 was much lower than at the previous visits; consequently, the 
responder  rates  at  this  time  point  were  lower  than  those  for  the  observed  data  analysis  due  to  the 
imputation  of  non-response  for  missing  data.  At  the  CHMP’s  request,  the  MAH  clarified  that  this 
phenomenon was unrelated to discontinuation for lack of efficacy. 
The results for post hoc JADAS27 and JADAS71 low disease activity and remission analysis also followed 
a similar pattern, with increasing rates over time through Day 645 that decreased due to missing data at 
Day  729.  Median  JADAS27  and  JADAS71  scores  decreased  over  time  during  the  cumulative  period, 
reflecting reductions in pJIA-associated disability. Median baseline JADAS27 and JADAS71 scores of 19.08 
and 21.04, respectively, had declined to 1.25 and 1.30, respectively, by Day 729.  
Consistent with the results of the subgroup analysis during the ST period, none of the demographic and 
clinical parameters, such as prior use of biologic DMARDS, use of MTX, and baseline levels of acute phase 
reactants (CRP), appeared to have an effect on the response to SC abatacept throughout the cumulative 
period. Scores for the parental assessment of overall well-being and CHAQ exhibited similar trends of 
improvement.

Indication  
Abatacept with or without concomitant mtx use Similar efficacy was shown in pJIA subjects treated with 
Orencia with or without MTX in Study IM101301 (ACRp30 responses at Day 113 78.7% with MTX and 
89.2% without MTX). At the CHMP’s request, the MAH has provided a detailed description of patient 
demographic and baseline characteristics including disease characteristics in subgroups of subjects 
treated with MTX and without MTX in both Studies IM101033 and IM101301. The efficacy results are 
consistent in all studies and subgroups studied in pJIA subjects treated with Orencia with or without MTX 
where baseline characteristics were shown to be homogeneous. Hence, the similar efficacy results of 
these subgroups show that the overall efficacy results /PK results were not confounded by differences in 
patient characteristics.  
Similar descriptive statistics were produced for pharmacokinetic results of Cmin and were shown to be 
similar in pJIA subjects treated with Orencia with or without MTX and consistent with adult data. These 
data are in line with the population PK results. 
Abatacept with or without Prior Biologic Failure – second line therapeutic positioning  
The SC Study IM101301 and the earlier IV study IM101033 provide evidence of efficacy and safety of 
abatacept  mainly  in  pJIA-patients  who  had  previously  been  treated  with  MTX  (95.9%  and  94.2%, 
respectively). Of the 219 subjects who entered the Study IM101301, 56 (25.6%) had previously been 
treated with biologic DMARD therapy, i.e., etanercept (n=45), adalimumab (n=19), or tocilizumab (n=6); 
in Study IM101033, 57/190 (30.0%) had previously been treated with anti-TNF biologic DMARD therapy. 
In the SC pJIA study, the number of responders seemed to be slightly less in patients with prior biologic 
DMARD  use  compared  to  those  without  such  (e.g.  at  day  309  71.7%  versus  83.5%),  but  overall  the 
efficacy seemed similar in all subgroups.  
At the CHMP’s request, the MAH provided efficacy and safety analyses in patients with and without prior 
use of biologics. The efficacy results were consistent and similar in the patients with and without prior use 
of biologics, namely TNF inhibitors. 
The presented data show that in both Study IM101033 and Study IM101301, abatacept-treated subjects 
who did not receive prior biologic therapy had generally higher ACRp response (ACRp30/50/70/90) than 
subjects  who  received  prior  biologic  therapy.  This  finding  is  not  unexpected  since  subjects  who  have 
received previous biologic therapy may be often refractory to further therapy. Importantly, this response 
rate was independent of MTX use in both the IV and SC pJIA studies. 
In  the  2-5  year  old  age  cohort  of  Study  IM101301,  the  number  of  subjects  was  too  small  to  draw 
conclusions  about  differences  in  clinical  response  in  subjects  with  or  without  prior  biologic  therapy. 
However, the efficacy results in the target patient population of pJIA patients treated with SC abatacept 
in study IM101301 show,  acknowledging the limitations of  uncontrolled data, consistent and clinically 
acceptable treatment effect of SC abatacept. Importantly, similar and acceptable efficacy on exposure 
surpassing the target threshold was also seen, between subjects who received abatacept with MTX and 
those on abatacept monotherapy. The consistency and persistence effect was shown up to 24 months, 
also across various efficacy outcome variables and subgroups. Importantly, the data were comparable to 
treatment effects seen in pJIA patients treated with the IV formulation in study IM101033. Furthermore, 
the results show consistency throughout the historical data of the abatacept development program in 
both adult RA and pJIA with both formulations, SC and IV. Thus, the efficacy results support the concept 
of  extrapolation  of  the  therapeutic  use  of  SC  abatacept  in  the treatment  of  pJIA,  also  in  the  younger 
patient population of 2 to 5 year old children, especially as a robust post approval follow up is in place (see 
RMP Section 2.8).

EMA/126226/2019

At the CHMP’s request, the MAH has aligned the wording of pJIA indication for the IV and SC formulations 
by  using  the  phrasing  “inadequate  response  to  previous  DMARD  therapy”  also  for  the  IV  formulation 
(instead of “insufficient response to other DMARDs”).  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The main aim of the study, target therapeutic abatacept concentrations (Cmin), were reached and 
sustained showing consistent results on weight tiers and age strata at each time-point up to Day 113 and 
beyond up to 24 months. ACRp30 responses rates were of sufficient level of efficacy when compared to 
previous adult RA and paediatric IV pJIA data. The proportion of pJIA ACRp30 responders at end of 
short-term period (4 months) in patients aged 2 to 17 years was 84.5%. 
From a clinical point of view the efficacy of SC abatacept was acceptable, acknowledging the limitations of 
descriptive data.  
Acknowledging the limitations of uncontrolled data, the efficacy result in the target patient population of 
pJIA patients treated with SC abatacept in study IM101301, show consistent and clinically acceptable 
treatment effect of SC abatacept. Similar and acceptable efficacy on exposure surpassing the target 
threshold was also seen, between subjects who received abatacept with MTX and those on abatacept 
monotherapy. Overall, the consistency and persistence of effect was shown up to 24 months, also across 
various efficacy outcome variables and subgroups (including use of MTX and prior use of biologics, namely 
TNF inhibitors), and were not counfounded by the characteristics of the patient populations in both 
paediatric studies. Importantly, the data were comparable to treatment effects seen in pJIA patients 
treated with the IV formulation in study IM101033. Furthermore, the results show consistency throughout 
the historical data of the abatacept development program in both adult RA and pJIA.  
Furthermore, these observed data are in line and supportive of the results of the E-R analysis with the 
most recent (year 2018) JIAACR response model,  where in addition to the baseline MTX use, prior use of 
TNF-alpha inhibitors was not significant covariate and did not affect predicted ACRp responses in subjects 
with pJIA (for details see Clinical Pharmacology Section 2.4). 
In conclusion, the pJIA indication for SC abatacept for children 2 to 17 years of age and the change of the 
indication to introduce abatacept monotherapy in case of MTX intolerance or when treatment with MTX is 
inappropriate and for positioning abacacept treatment in second line in the treatment of pJIA (i.e. the 
removal of “following treatment failure with TNF-inhibitors”) for both SC and IV formulations is considered 
acceptable from an efficacy perspective.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Altogether 173 6 to 17 year old patients and 47 2 to 5 year old patients were entered to the study. Patient 
exposure in most subjects (70%) was at least 24 months of treatment. Final results for the 2 to 5 age 
group are pending, but thus far the duration of exposure was for both age groups essentially same as for 
the pooled population: for the 6-17 year old patients the mean (SD) exposure to SC abatacept over the 
cumulative period was 21.8 (6.87) months with a median exposure of 24.3 months and for the 2-5 year 
old patients the mean (SD) exposure to SC abatacept over the cumulative period was 18.8 (7.26) months 
with a median duration of 24.1 months. The reported adherence to treatment, measured by diary, was 
high with over 90 % of subjects with no (82,6%) or one (12,1%) missed injection. Thus, the data allows 
for analysis of short and long term, up to 24 months, with a reserve on the 2 to 5 age group, because of 
limited data.

Adverse events 
ST period 
Overall Adverse Events from the ST period for 6 to 17 Year-old Cohort  
The majority (157/173, 90.8%) of subjects completed the ST period and continued into the LTE period. 
Overall, AEs were reported in 102 subjects (59.0%) during the ST period of which approximately half 
(20.8%) were deemed treatment related. The most commonly occurring AEs were nasopharyngitis and 
upper respiratory tract infections (18 subjects, 10.4%, each). Malignancies and autoimmune disorders 
were single occurrence and the rate of injection site reactions was 5.8%. No fatal cases were reported.  
AEs of severe intensity were reported in 7 subjects (4.0%): sepsis, chest pain, headache, traumatic 
hematoma, anaemia, hypochromic anaemia, and stage III ovarian germ cell teratoma. No AEs were 
classified as very severe, and all other AEs were mild or moderate. The sole case of sepsis was the only 
severe AE (or SAE) related to treatment. All other AEs related to study drug were mild or moderate in 
intensity. There was no apparent trend on the weight tiers. In the ST period no new AE were observed, 
and the safety profile in the ST of Study IM101301 appear to previously reported for abatacept.

Comparison of AEs between paediatric IV Study IM101033 and SC Study IM101301 in ST period 
Apart from age, and a slightly longer duration of disease in the IV study, the baseline characteristics of (of 
the respective short term periods) of the abatacept paediatric studies the 4-month Period A of the IV 
study IM101033 and pooled data from the 4-month ST period in the SC study IM101301 was comparable.

The use of concomitant anti-rheumatic medications was similar in both studies. The minor differences 
observed are unlikely to affect the analysis. 
In both the lead-in phase of IM101033 and the ST period of IM101301 the rate of overall AEs (70% and 
63.9%, respectively) and SAEs (vs 3.1% vs. 2.7% respectively) were similar. As expected, among the 
AEs of special interest, infections were overall the most common. The other AEs were few in number, with 
low frequencies and incidence rates, excepting the twice as high number of AE occurring within 24 hours 
of drug administration for those on SC abatacept treatment (60/27.4% vs 30/15.8%). The most common 
AEs in both studies were upper respiratory tract infection and nasopharyngitis.

Overall Adverse Events During the Cumulative Period (2 to 5-Year-Old Cohort) 
AEs were reported in 93.5% (43/46) of pJIA patients in the younger cohort during the cumulative period. 
The most frequently reported AEs were nasopharyngitis (33%), Pyrexia (30%), and Upper respiratory 
tract infection (24%). No AEs were reported as severe or very severe in intensity; three (6.5%) of the 46 
subjects experienced three SAEs. AEs with an incidence of > 10 subjects per 100 person-years were 
nasopharyngitis, pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infections, cough, rhinitis, gastroenteritis, headache, 
pharyngitis, conjunctivitis, and vomiting. AEs were classified by the study investigators as related to 
study drug for 27 (58.7%) subjects. No drug-related AE was reported as severe or very severe in 
intensity.

Overall Adverse Events During the Cumulative Period (6 through 17-Year-Old Cohort) 
In the cumulative period in the in the 6 to 17 age cohort, AEs were reported by 152 (87.9%) in pJIA 
patients. The safety profile was similar to that of the 2 -5 age cohort with the most common AEs being 
infections and infestations. The majority of AEs were of mild or moderate intensity. In the 2 -5 age cohort 
no AEs of severe intensity were observed, whereas nine (5.2%) subjects in the 6 to 17 age cohort 
reported AEs were severe intensity. These included the AEs of sepsis, chest pain, headache, traumatic 
haematoma, synovitis, nephrolithiasis, anaemia, hypochromic anaemia, nephrolithiasis, and ovarian 
germ cell teratoma. All other AEs were mild or moderate in intensity. No subject reported an AE of very 
severe intensity in this cohort.

Table 36 Most Frequently Reported Adverse Events Reported During the Cumulative Period (in at Least 10 
percent of Subjects) – Study IM101301 
Related Adverse Events 
Eighty-one (81) (37%) of the overall reported AEs were assessed to be related to the study drug during 
the cumulative period. All related AEs were of mild or moderate intensity except 1 AE of sepsis that was 
of severe intensity.  
The frequency of related AEs was similar in the ST period of this study and Period A of IM101033 (25.1% 
and 27.4% respectively). In both age cohorts, the most frequent reported related AE was 
nasopharyngitis. The Adverse Reactions during the first 4-month open-label period in the 409 pJIA 
patients were similar in nature and frequency to that observed in the RA trials, with the exception of 
pyrexia haematuria and otitis (media and externa). All related AEs in both cohorts were considered mild 
or moderate in intensity with the exception of 1 AE in the older age cohort that was severe in intensity 
(sepsis). 
A greater percentage of subjects in the 2 to 5 age cohort experienced AEs that were seen to be related to 
study drug(58.7% vs. 31.2%)..  These related AEs were typically upper respiratory tract infections. 
Considering the data limitations, follow-up data was requested (see section 2.6.1 Discussion on clinical 
safety).  
Comparison of AEs in the During 4-month Lead-in Period A in Study IM101033 and 4-month ST Period in 
Study IM101301 
In both the ST period of IM101301 and the lead-in phase of Study IM101033, the most common reason 
for discontinuation was lack of efficacy and the most common AEs were u pper respiratory tract infection 
and nasopharyngitis. In both the ST period of IM101301 and the lead- in phase of IM101033, the percent 
of overall  AEs (63.9%  and 70%)  and SAEs (2.7%  vs 3.1%) were similar. Most AEs reported in both 
studies during these early 4-month periods were  mild  or  moderate  in  intensity.  With  few  exceptions, 
most SAEs were determined by the investigator to be unrelated to abatacept and did not cause study

discontinuation in either study. Similar to Study IM101301, related non-serious AEs did not lead to 
treatment discontinuation in Study IM101033. No deaths were reported in either study in the 4-month 
ST/lead-in phase.

Period in Study IM101301
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Overall, no deaths were reported in the study IM 101301.  
Results for ST period (6 to 17 Year Cohort) 
Five subjects of 173 (2.9%) experienced a total of 7 SAEs. A case of severe sepsis was assessed as related 
to the study drug, whereas the SAEs teratoma, anaemia, and chest pain, and a case of hypomagnesemia 
(considered mild in intensity) where not related. Three SAEs were severe in intensity: teratoma, anaemia, 
and chest pain. Overall, each SAE was a single case.  
Results for Cumulative period 
2 to 5 Years Cohort:  
In the cumulative period three (6.5%) of the 46 subjects in the 2 to 5 age cohort experienced SAEs. The 
SAEs included drug overdose related to the study drug, and a febrile convulsion and tendon disorder 
deemed not related. This part of the study IM101301 is still ongoing and the pending data will be provided 
as described in the RMP (see Section 2.8).  
6 To 17 Year-old Cohort:  
During the cumulative period, in the 6 to 17 age cohort, 14 of 173 (8.1%) subjects reported SAEs. The 
SAEs of nephrolithiasis, stage III ovarian germ cell teratoma, sepsis, anaemia, and chest pain were 
classified as severe in intensity. SAEs of teratoma, sepsis, autonomic nervous system imbalance, and 
vertigo led to discontinuation of study drug. No SAE was reported to be very severe in intensity. 
Assessment report  
EMA/126226/2019  
Page 69/100 
 
 
 
 
  
The event of sepsis occurred during the ST period, was severe, and led to the discontinuation of study 
drug. The event of sinusitis occurred after the end of the LTE period, was moderate in intensity, led to the 
interruption of study drug, resolving after 5 days.  
In the cumulative period, 7 of 173 subjects (4.0%) discontinued due to AEs. Four subjects had a 
treatment-related AE that led to discontinuation (mild fatigue, severe sepsis, rash and aphthous ulcer, 
which were moderate in intensity). 
Overall, in the cumulative period the no clear trends were seen and incidence rates were low. The total 
number of subject in the category infections and infestations was four, for renal and urinary disorders, 
two and for injury and poisonings two. Otherwise SAEs were single occurrences. The number of subjects 
with SAEs in the 2 to 5 age group was too low for any meaningful comparison.  
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Malignancies:  
Overall, only one subject was diagnosed with a malignancy (stage III teratoma).  
Local injection site reactions:   
Local injections site reactions rates appeared comparable between age group 4.3% (2) in 2 – 5 age 
group; 5.8% (10/173)and 6.9% (12/173)in the ST and cumulative periods in the 6-8 age group. These 
were either mild or moderate in intensity and the numbers appeared not to increase with time.  
Infections:  
In the ST period, infections occurred in 31.8% (55/173) in the older age cohort. The most commonly 
occurring infections were nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection, at a rate of 10.4% each 
(18 subjects each). 
In the cumulative period in the 6 to 17-year-old cohort infections were reported by 68.2% (118/173) of 
subjects. The most common infections were nasopharyngitis (52 subjects, 30.1%) and upper respiratory 
tract infection (32 subjects, 18.5%). The corresponding numbers for the 2 to 5 age cohort were 15 
subjects, 32.6% and 11 subjects, 23,9%, respectively. In the cumulative period in the 2 to 5-year-old 
cohort infections were reported by 36 subject 78.3%).  
All infections, except the sole case of sepsis (which was serious and severe) were of mild or moderate in 
intensity. Four subjects had a serious infection (appendicitis, pneumonia, pyelonephritis, and sepsis). 
Most subjects with nasopharyngitis or upper respiratory tract infections experienced only one occurrence 
of the event during the cumulative period. 
Opportunistic infections were rare overall. Three subjects in the older age cohort had AEs classified as 
autoimmune disorders (paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal 
infection (PANDAS), psoriasis, and Takayasu’s arteritis). None were identified among the pJIA patients of 
the  younger  age  cohort,  pending  final  24-month  data  from  some  patients.  Associations  suggesting 
causality were not evident on the basis of these single occurrences. The relatedness of these AEs to study 
drug (abatacept) was determined by clinical judgement of the investigator and none were assessed to be 
related to abatacept therapy. 
Laboratory findings 
Results for ST period: 6 To 17 Year-old Cohort  
During the ST period, Marked laboratory abnormalities, MAs that occurred in more than 5% of subjects 
were (no. of subjects with an MA/no. of subjects tested, % of subjects tested) as follows:

Marked laboratory abnormalities in this study were infrequently associated with AEs and generally not 
persistent upon continued dosing.  
Table 38 Laboratory Values Meeting the Marked Abnormality Criteria During the Short-term Period – All 
Treated Subjects – 6 through 17-Year-old Age Cohort 
In the short term period among the 6 to 17 year-old children, six patients (3.5%) had markedly elevated 
eosinophil values in the WBC differential count. This was also evident in the cumulative period (13.4%), 
in also in the younger age group (26.1%).  
The MAH provided, on request, further data on the eosinophilia, frequently reported in both age cohorts 
(up to 26.1% in the cumulative period among 2 to 5 year-old children) among marked abnormality 
criteria (MLA). However, on the basis of the provided data, no definitive reasons or associations could be

found. A high incidence of upper respiratory infections was acknowledged, but review of the data for AEs 
reported within ±21 days of the MLA for eosinophils, showed that few AEs in both age groups could be 
considered associated with the occurrence of eosinophilia, and overall none were associated with injection 
site reactions. Only one case was reported on the same day as a SAE (pneumonia, considered unrelated 
to study drug). Furthermore, occurrence of eosinophilia coincided only infrequently and discrepantly with 
the lack of clinical response.

Mean values for laboratory parameters fluctuated over time, but no obvious trends were observed and 
mean  values  generally  remained  within  normal  limits.  Marked normalities in clinical laboratory 
evaluations during the cumulative period were generally few in number and not persistent. The most 
common marked abnormalities (> 5% of subjects) were as follows:

Marked abnormalities were examined for persistence and for classification as AEs. Abnormal laboratory 
values  typically  reverted  to  within  normal  ranges  during  continued  treatment.  Four subjects had 
persistent MA for 2 or more consecutive laboratory test days; for 3 of these subjects, these abnormal 
values were reported as AEs. 
The AEs associated with abnormal laboratory values reported in more than 1 subject included anaemia 
(3 subjects, 6.5%) and hepatic enzyme increased (2 subjects, 4.3%).  AEs of hyperphosphatemia, ALT 
increased, AST increased, GGT increased, leukocytosis, and thrombocytosis each occurred in 1 subject 
(2.2%). These events were mild  or  moderate  in  intensity  and  resolved  without  the  need  for  study 
drug interruption or discontinuation. One  event of neutropenia  occurred after the  24-month treatment 
period. Marked laboratory abnormalities in this study were infrequently associated with AEs and generally 
not persistent upon continued dosing. 
Heart rate as well as supine and sitting diastolic and systolic BP were measured before study drug 
injection at prespecified office visits. Mean and median heart rate and blood pressure were within normal 
ranges and remained stable throughout the cumulative period. 
6 To 17 Year-old Cohort 
Marked laboratory abnormalities were generally few in number and not persistent upon continued dosing 
during the cumulative period. MAs observed in the highest proportions (> 5%) of subjects were (no. of

These MAs were examined for persistence, age of subject, sex of subject, accompanying SAEs and AEs of 
special interest, and classification as AEs. No clinically meaningful patterns were observed in the data. 
Mean values for all parameters were stable and within normal ranges throughout the study. 
AEs associated with abnormal laboratory values were infrequently reported. The AEs associated with 
abnormal laboratory values (Investigations SOC) or blood and lymphatic disorders that occurred in more 
than 1 subject included anaemia (5 subjects, 2.9%), ALT increased (4 subjects, 2.3%), AST increased (3 
subjects, 1.7%), GGT increased (3 subjects, 1.7%), and neutrophilia (2 subjects, 1.2%). None of the 
elevated liver function tests values met the criteria for Hy’s Law; most of the abnormalities were mild and 
transient and resolved without the need for treatment interruption or discontinuation. 
Most of the AEs associated with abnormal laboratory values were mild or moderate in intensity and 
resolved without the need for study drug interruption or discontinuation.

Vital Signs During the Cumulative Period  
In both age cohorts mean and median heart rate and blood pressure were within normal ranges and 
remained stable throughout the cumulative period. In the 6 to 17-Year-Old Cohort AEs associated with 
abnormal vital signs included tachycardia (2 subjects), hypotension (2 subjects), and abnormal pulse (1 
subject). These events were mild or moderate in severity, considered unrelated to treatment, and 
resolved without the need for treatment interruption or discontinuation. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No dedicated studies were performed on drug-drug interactions. The results of the vaccination study are 
described in the efficacy section 2.5. 
Immunogenicity and Immunological events 
Bioanalytical methods 
The bioanalytical methods used for determination of the drug concentration, anti-drug-antibodies and 
neutralizing antibodies in patient sera were previously validated using sera from adults with RA. During 
Study IM101301 the suitability of the methods for use in the juvenile patient group was evaluated. The 
assay accuracy (bias: -0.3 - 5.0%) and precision (%CV: 4.1 - 5.9%) were at acceptable level for the drug 
concentration determination method. The ADA method was cross-validated for the JIA/JRA patient group 
and study specific cut points were determined for patients with JIA/JRA.  
In general, the used approach is acceptable. However, due to the lack of follow-up data, it is not possible 
to conclude whether the ADA profile in the 2 to 5 year old cohort is similar to that seen in the 6-17 year 
old group, where ADAs were typically seen after the treatment period.  
Sampling  
Immunogenicity samples were collected at Days 1, 57, 85, and 113 of the 4-month ST period, at 6-month 
intervals during the LTE period, at the Final/Early Termination visit, and at follow-up visits 28, 85, and 168 
days after the last dose of abatacept. 
An earlier sampling time point before reaching the steady state kinetics for abatacept would have been 
useful. 
Results  
Altogether, 234 patients were enrolled, and 219 were evaluated for safety. Forty-six subjects were 
treated in the 2 to 5-year-old cohort. All 46 subjects were evaluated for efficacy, safety, and 
immunogenicity whereas in the 6 through 17-year-old cohort the immunogenicity population included 
172 subjects.  
AEs that may be associated with the use of immunomodulatory drugs were recorded. These included 
infections, malignancies, autoimmune disorders/events, local injection reaction AEs, and AEs within 
24 hours of study drug administration. Immune-mediated adverse events were rare, with no obvious 
differences between the two age categories. In the pooled 2 to 17 year age group, nearly all subjects 
(95.9%) had received MTX prior to enrolment and most took MTX at Day 1 (79%).

Anti-drug antibodies 
Results for short term period 
Cohort 6 to 17 years:  
During the ST-treatment period, 2 of the 171 subjects (1.2%) in the immunogenicity population tested 
positive for antibodies to abatacept relative to baseline while on-treatment, and overall (on and off 
treatment), 3 subjects tested positive for antibodies to abatacept relative to baseline. The one subject 
who tested positive for CTLA4 and possibly Ig region relative to baseline was not  tested for neutralization 
activity. 
Most anti-abatacept-positive sera were reactive with the Ig-part of abatacept. 
Results for the long-term period 
2 to 5 Year-old Population 
Five of 46 subjects (10.9%) developed anti-abatacept antibodies in the cumulative period, including one 
patient with positive off-treatment sample. Titers for most of the positive results were low, the highest 
titer was 1940. Three patients had an on-treatment persistent ADA-response (at least two consecutive 
ADA-positive samples). Among the subjects with ADA response during the cumulative period, 1 subject 
missed one abatacept injection, and 1 subject missed two abatacept injections. 
All patients with anti-abatacept antibodies had concomitant methotrexate at Day 1. 
6 to 17 Year-old Population 
In this cohort, 8 (4.7%) subjects out of 172 tested positive for antibodies to abatacept relative to baseline 
in the cumulative period. Five of 8 subjects were positive for CTLA4 and possibly Ig. Of these 5 subjects, 
3 subjects tested negative for neutralizing antibodies and 2 were not tested for neutralizing antibodies.  
Immunogenicity to abatacept was classified as “persistent” if at least 2 or more consecutive positive test 
results relative to baseline with the same antibody reactivity were observed while on treatment. Three 
patients fulfilled these criteria. 
As in previous studies in RA, psoriasis, and JIA/JRA, ADA-positive samples were rare. Data on neutralizing 
antibodies is limited because of the poor drug tolerance of the assay, which results in many samples not 
meeting criteria for analysis. 
The analysis of the clinical correlations will only be explorative due to the rarity of ADAs. In previous 
studies, ADAs appeared after discontinuation of abatacept treatment in some patients. Late appearing 
ADAs can be detected in post treatment samples where abatacept levels are low and thus the samples 
meet the criteria for analysis..  
All patients with anti-abatacept antibodies had concomitant methotrexate at Day 1. 
Immunogenicity Comparison in pJIA Patients by Route of Administration (SC vs IV) 
There was no head-to-head comparison between the SC and IV administrations in JIA/JRA. In order to 
compare the use of SC and IV abatacept in patients 6 to 17 years of age with pJIA, data from the 4-month 
ST period of Study IM101301 (S.C. abatacept) were summarized and compared with pooled data from the 
4-month lead-in phase (Period A) of Study IM101033 (I.V. abatacept). In IV Study IM101033 (Period A, 
6 to 17 Year-old), 1/189 subjects (0.5%) were seropositive for anti-CTLA4 antibodies at the last 
treatment visit whereas in the SC Study IM101301 6 to 17 Year-old Cohort: 0/171 subjects (0.0%) had 
Assessment report  
EMA/126226/2019  
Page 76/100 
 
 
 
 
positive antibodies specific to CTLA4 and possibly Ig and 2/171 subjects (1.2%) had positive antibodies 
specific to IG and/or junction region. 
Impact of immunogenicity on pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy 
Abatacept concentration values were similar for both ADA negative and positive status. According to the 
model-predicted clearance of abatacept in patients with JIA stratified by ADA status, there was no obvious 
difference in clearance when stratified by ADA status. The trough abatacept concentrations decreased 
neither in the older nor in the younger age cohort over time.  
In both cohorts, efficacy was similar between subjects, with and without positive ADA-response. Most 
discontinuations were due to lack of efficacy. In both the 6 to 17 year-old and the 2 to 17 year-old cohort, 
safety was similar between subjects with or without positive immunogenicity. The mean duration of 
treatment was shorter in the 2.5 years cohort. No AEs were attributed to immune-mediated events in 
ADA-positive subjects. 
Immunological events  
Anti-Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase and Anti-Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies 
The generation of relevant auto-antibodies (anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase [GAD], anti-thyroid 
peroxidase [TPO]), was measured to assess the potential for abatacept-induced autoimmune diabetes 
type 1 or thyroiditis. TSH was measured as a biomarker to assess the potential effect of the antibodies on 
thyroid function. In the older paediatric population six and in the younger two subjects had 
seroconversion (from negative at baseline to positive on treatment). Titers were low and transient and 
were not associated with autoimmune AEs. Overall, these positive results were generally transient, 
occurred at a single visit, and were of low titer. Only one subject had a transient shift of TSH on Day 477. 
These findings appear not to be suggestive of any severe loss of immunological tolerance.  
The MAH briefly discussed the possible immunogenic effect/adjuvant potential of the silicon contained in 
the different types of syringes, in vivo in children, especially in the younger age cohort of 2 to 5 years, and 
noted the numbers too small for firm conclusion. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
During the cumulative period, a total of 8 of 219 subjects (3.7%) discontinued due to AEs. Overall, the 
discontinuations related to AEs were single occurrences.  
Post marketing experience 
The MAH’s post marketing observational registries study IM101240 for paediatric pJIA patients aged 6 to 
17 years old, was created in cooperation with the Paediatric Rheumatology Collaborative Study Group 
(PRCSG) and the Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation (PRINTO) to monitor safety in 
paediatric patients with JIA on abatacept treatment. The planned enrolment is 900 patients, including at 
least 500 patients with 10 years of follow-up at the end of the study. The primary objective of the registry 
is to describe the long term safety of abatacept treatment for JIA in routine clinical practice by quantifying 
the incidence rates of serious/targeted infections, autoimmune disorders, and malignancies. Targeted 
infections include Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, papilloma virus, herpes zoster, tuberculosis, and 
opportunistic infections. A secondary objective is to compare the accrued data to historical patients and 
future recruitees.  
At the time of the latest data base lock (31-Mar-2017) 354 of the enrolled 367 are included in this 
summary, 265 patients are receiving the IV formulation of abatacept. 57% patients have at least one year 
of observation time. Overall, 29 AEs have been reposted in 22 patients, with 28 SAEs. Most AEs reported 
were of single occurrence with the exception of hip pain which occurred in 3 patients. These results appear 
Assessment report  
EMA/126226/2019  
Page 77/100 
 
 
 
reassuring also in that no deaths, malignancies, no new autoimmune diseases or targeted infections have 
been reported. 
Abatacept with or without concomitant mtx use  
To further justify the proposed amendments to the pJIA indication, the MAH has provided analysis of 
safety data on abatacept treatment with or without MTX. In Period A of the IV study IM101033, the 
percentages of SAEs and AEs were similar in subjects who received abatacept with MTX and subjects who 
received abatacept monotherapy.  In Period B of Study IM101033 (controlled phase), subject treated with 
MTX had more AEs compared to treatment without MTX in both placebo- treated (59.6% placebo + MTX 
vs. 40.0%; placebo monotherapy) and abatacept-treated subjects (67.3% abatacept + MTX vs. 36.4% 
abatacept monotherapy) possibly implying MTX treatment in this finding.  
During the ST period of the SC study IM101301, the frequency of overall AEs and AEs assessed to be 
related to study drug were similar among subjects who received abatacept monotherapy and subjects 
who received abatacept with MTX. No subjects who received abatacept monotherapy reported SAEs, but 
six subjects who received abatacept + MTX (3.5%) reported SAEs.  
Abatacept with or without Prior Biologic Failure – second line therapeutic 
positioning  
The overall safety (SAE, AE, and relatedness) of abatacept, for subjects with pJIA, who received prior 
biologic therapy and subjects who did not receive prior biologic therapy was similar during the 4-month, 
open-label periods of both studies IM101033 and IM101301.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Exposure 
Patient exposure in most subjects (70%) was at least 24 months of treatment. Final results for the 2 – 5 
age group are pending, but thus far the duration of exposure was for both age groups essentially same as 
for the pooled population: for the 6-17 year old patients the mean (SD) exposure to SC abatacept over 
the cumulative period was 21.8 (6.87) months with a median exposure of 24.3 months and for the 2-5 
year old patients the mean (SD) exposure to SC abatacept over the cumulative period was 18.8 (7.26) 
months with a median duration of 24.1 months. The reported adherence to treatment, measured by 
diary, was high with over 90 % of subjects with no (82,6%) or one (12,1%) missed injection. Thus, the 
data allows for analysis of short and long term safety, up to 24 months, with a reserve on the 2 to 5 age 
group, because of incompleteness of data.  
In some European centres the study IM101301 was extended up to five years, thus safety data will be 
collected to further accrue long-term, up to five years (in all the total 7 year length of the study), safety 
data for SC abatacept. The LT data will be submitted as described in the RMP (see Section 2.8). 
Discontinuation  
During the cumulative period, a total of 8 of 219 subjects (3.7%) discontinued due to AEs. Overall, the 
discontinuations related to AEs were not numerous.  No consistent pattern or associations to certain time 
points were evident. 
Adverse events - short term period (ST) 6 to 17 age cohort  
In ST period of the study IM101301 overall, AEs were reported in 102 subjects (59.0%) during the ST 
period of which approximately half (20.8%) were deemed treatment related. The most commonly 
occurring AEs were nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infections (18 subjects, 10.4%, each). 
Assessment report  
EMA/126226/2019  
Page 78/100 
 
 
 
Malignancies and autoimmune disorders were single occurrence and the rate of injection site reactions 
was 5.8%. No fatal cases were reported.  
AEs of severe intensity were reported in 7 subjects (4.0%): sepsis, chest pain, headache, traumatic 
hematoma, anaemia, hypochromic anaemia, and stage III ovarian germ cell teratoma. No AEs were 
classified as very severe, and all other AEs were mild or moderate. The sole case of sepsis was the only 
severe AE (or SAE) related to treatment. All other AEs related to study drug were mild or moderate in 
intensity. There was no apparent trend on the weight tiers. In the ST period no new AE were observed and 
the safety profile in the ST of Study IM101301 appear to be similar to that previously reported for 
abatacept.  
Comparison of the SC study IM101301 and the IV study IM101033  
When comparing the two paediatric studies, apart from age, and a slightly longer duration of disease in 
the IV study, the baseline characteristics of the populations were alike. The minor differences observed 
are unlikely to affect the analysis.  
The Adverse Reactions during the first 4-month open-label period in the 409 pJIA patients were similar in 
nature and frequency to that observed in the RA trials, with the exception of pyrexia (frequency is 
“Common” in Section 4.8 of the SmPC) and haematuria and otitis (media and externa) (frequency is 
“Uncommon” in Section 4.8 of the SmPC). This is adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
In both the lead-in phase of IM101033 and the ST period of IM101301 the rate of overall AEs (70% and 
63.9%, respectively) and SAEs (2.7% vs 3.1%, respectively) were similar. As expected, among the AEs 
of special interest, infections were overall the most common. Others were few in number, with low 
frequencies and incidence rates, excepting the twice as high number of AE occurring within 24 hours of 
drug administration for those on SC abatacept treatment (60/27.4% vs 30/15.8%). The most common 
AEs in both studies were upper respiratory tract infection and nasopharyngitis.  
Overall, the safety profiles appear similar in the short term period of the two studies. However, upon 
submission of the final results (24-month and 5-year data) of the Study IM101301, the MAH should re 
address this issue. 
AE in the cumulative period 
In the cumulative period in the younger age cohort AEs were reported in 93.5% (43/46) of pJIA patients. 
The most frequently reported AEs were nasopharyngitis (33%), Pyrexia (30%), and Upper respiratory 
tract infection (24%). No AEs were reported as severe or very severe in intensity; three (6.5%) of the 46 
subjects experienced three SAEs. AEs with an incidence of > 10 subjects per 100 person-years were 
nasopharyngitis, pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infections, cough, rhinitis, gastroenteritis, headache, 
pharyngitis, conjunctivitis, and vomiting. AEs were classified by the study investigators as related to 
study drug for 27 (58.7%) subjects. No drug-related AE was reported as severe or very severe in 
intensity.  
In the cumulative period in the older age cohort, AEs were reported by 152 (87.9%) of pJIA patients. 
The safety profile was similar to that of the 2 to 5 age cohort with the most common AEs being infections 
and infestations. The majority of AEs were of mild or moderate intensity. In the 2-5 age cohort no AEs of 
severe intensity were observed, whereas nine (5.2%) subjects in the 6 to 17 age cohort reported AEs 
were severe intensity. These included the AEs of sepsis, chest pain, headache, traumatic haematoma, 
synovitis, nephrolithiasis, anaemia, hypochromic anaemia, nephrolithiasis, and ovarian germ cell 
teratoma. All other AEs were mild or moderate in intensity. No subject reported an AE of very severe 
intensity in this cohort. 
Assessment report  
EMA/126226/2019  
Page 79/100 
 
 
 
A greater percentage of subjects in the 2 to 5 age cohort experienced AEs that were seen to be related to 
study drug (58.7% vs. 31.2%). The MAH attributed this difference in relatedness to study drug, with 
references to literature, to the knowledge that upper respiratory tract infections are the most common in 
children of similar age as those in the younger age cohort. This explanation was accepted by the CHMP. 
However, considering the data limitations, the MAH should follow-up on this point upon submission of the 
final results (24-month and 5-year data) of the Study IM101301 and discuss the possible reasons in more 
detail with the aim of excluding putative age dependency of the (iatrogenic) effects of abatacept 
treatment. 
SAE  
In the short term period (6 to age cohort), five subjects of 173 (2.9%) experienced a total of 7 SAEs. A 
case of severe sepsis was assessed as related to the study drug, whereas the SAEs teratoma, anaemia, 
and chest pain, and a case of hypomagnesemia (considered mild in intensity) where not related. Three 
SAEs were severe in intensity: teratoma, anaemia, and chest pain. Overall, the each of the SAE was a 
single case. 
In the cumulative period three (6.5%) of the 46 subjects in the 2 to 5 age cohort experienced SAEs. The 
SAEs included drug overdose related to the study drug, and a febrile convulsion and tendon disorder 
deemed not related.  
During the cumulative period, among the 6 to 17 age cohort, 14 of 173 (8.1%) subjects reported SAEs. 
The SAEs of nephrolithiasis, stage III ovarian germ cell teratoma, sepsis, anaemia, and chest pain were 
classified as severe in intensity. SAEs of teratoma, sepsis, autonomic nervous system imbalance, and 
vertigo led to discontinuation of study drug. No SAE was reported to be very severe in intensity. 
The event of sepsis occurred during the ST period, was severe, and led to the discontinuation of study 
drug. The event of sinusitis occurred after the end of the LTE period, was moderate in intensity, led to the 
interruption of study drug, resolving after 5 days.  
During the cumulative period, among the 6 to 17 age cohort, 7 of 173 subjects (4.0%) discontinued due 
to AEs. Four subjects had a treatment-related AE that led to discontinuation (mild fatigue, severe sepsis, 
rash and aphthous ulcer, which were moderate in intensity). 
Overall, in the cumulative period there is no clear trend for observed SAE as the incidence rates are low. 
The total number of subject in the category infections and infestations was four, for renal and urinary 
disorders, two and for injury and poisonings two. Other SAEs were single occurrences. The number of 
subjects with SAEs in the 2 to 5 age group was too low to draw meaningful comparison. However, these 
data do not raise major concerns at present. However, the MAH should re address this point upon 
submission of the final results of the Study IM101301.  
AEs of special interest 
Overall, only one subject was diagnosed with a malignancy (stage III teratoma). Local injections site 
reactions rates appeared comparable between age group 4.3% (2) in 2 – 5 age group; 5.8% (10/173) 
and 6.9% (12/173) in the ST and cumulative periods in the 6-8 age group. These were either mild or 
moderate in intensity and the numbers appeared not to increase with time. There were no reports of 
anaphylaxis in the paediatric patients.  
In the ST period, infections occurred in 31.8% (55/173) in the older age cohort. The most commonly 
occurring infections were nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection, at a rate of 10.4% each 
(18 subjects each). In the cumulative period in the 6 to 17-year-old cohort infections were reported by 
68.2% (118/173) of subjects. The most common infections were nasopharyngitis (52 subjects, 30.1%) 
Assessment report  
EMA/126226/2019  
Page 80/100 
 
 
 
and upper respiratory tract infection (32 subjects, 18.5%).  The corresponding numbers for the 2 to 5 age 
cohort were 15 subjects (32.6%) and 11 subjects (23,9%) respectively. In the cumulative period in the 
2 to 5-year-old cohort infections were reported by 36 subjects (78.3%).  
All infections, except the sole case of sepsis (which was serious and severe) were of mild or moderate in 
intensity. Four subjects had a serious infection (appendicitis, pneumonia, pyelonephritis, and sepsis). 
Most subjects with nasopharyngitis or upper respiratory tract infections experienced only one occurrence 
of the event during the cumulative period. 
Opportunistic infections were rare overall. Three subjects in the older age cohort had AEs classified as 
autoimmune disorders (paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal 
infection (PANDAS), psoriasis, and Takayasu’s arteritis). None were identified among the pJIA patients of 
the  younger  age  cohort  pending  final  24-month  data  from  some  patients.  The  lack  of  causality  and 
relatedness cannot unequivocally be excluded (pending data and small sample size); therefore, this issue 
will be addressed in the pJIA registry (see RMP section 2.8). 
The AEs of special interest were few in number, with low frequencies and incidence rates. Local injection 
site reactions and infections possibly indicative of immunosuppression were rare. No clustering was 
evident, suggesting that the risk of these AEs did not increase with long-term exposure. 
Laboratory findings 
In the urine analysis up to a third of the children had significant findings, including haematuria, RBC in 
urine and WBC in urine. The MAH was asked to clarify possible reasons for MLA findings in urine 
(haematuria, RBC and WBC) in both studies IM101301 and IM101033. On the basis of the provided data, 
the possible reasons for this concern appear multifactorial. The most common possibly related AEs being 
gastroenteritis urinary tract infection and dysmenorrhea, with all other AEs being single occurrences. 
Reassuringly, most often these MLA were transient. Data were presented also on past medical history and 
menses, as possible causes of these urinary findings. No definitive causal or clinically meaningful 
associations were evident in either of the studies, in either male of female children. This explanation was 
accepted by the CHMP. However, considering the data limitations, the MAH should follow-up the issue 
upon submission of the final results (24-month and 5-year data) of the Study IM101301. 
In addition, eosinophilia was frequently reported in both age cohort (up to 26.1% in the cumulative period 
among the 2 to 5 year-old children) among the marked abnormality criteria. The MAH provided, on 
request, further data on the eosinophilia, frequently reported in both age cohorts (up to 26.1% in the 
cumulative period among 2 to 5 year-old children) among marked abnormality criteria (MLA). No 
definitive reasons or associations could be found. A high incidence of upper respiratory infections was 
acknowledged, but review of the data for AEs reported within ±21 days of the MLA for eosinophils, showed 
that few AEs in both age groups could be considered associated with the occurrence of eosinophilia, and 
overall none were associated with injection site reactions. Only one case was reported on the same day as 
a SAE (pneumonia, considered unrelated to study drug). Furthermore, occurrence of eosinophilia 
coincided only infrequently and discrepantly with the lack of clinical response. This explanation was 
accepted by the CHMP. Considering the data limitations, the MAH should follow-up on the issue upon 
submission of the final results (24-month and 5-year data) of the Study IM101301. 
Immunogenicity 
It appears that the SC administration of abatacept to pJIA patients does not change its immunogenicity or 
the incidence of potentially immune-associated adverse effects. The immunogenicity of abatacept in 
patients at the age of 2 to 5 seems not to be significantly different from that of the patients at 6 to 
Assessment report  
EMA/126226/2019  
Page 81/100 
 
 
 
17 years of age.  A trend for slightly higher incidence of ADAs in the younger cohort was observed, but the 
significance of this finding is uncertain due to small number of patients in the dataset. 
On the basis of the currently available data, firm conclusion on either a putative effect of MTX on 
immunogenicity or on the characteristic, including age dependency, of the ADA response cannot be made, 
because of the small number of patients in the datasets and low ADA incidence rates in study IM101033 
and Study IM101301.  
Acknowledging the uncertainty in indirect cross study comparisons, the CHMP agreed that, on the current 
data, there was no clear evidence of effects of immunogenicity on occurrence of PK, loss of efficacy, and 
the occurrence of AEs, in subjects who were ADA positive in study IM101033 and Study IM101301. 
Furthermore, the occurrence of ADAs was comparable or less to that in adults with SC abatacept or 
children treated with the IV formulation.  
However, since the immunogenicity of paediatric patients of different age groups may differ and that 
ADAs may be more frequently observed in the younger patient cohort of 2 to 5 years. Hence, at the 
CHMP’s request, immunogenicity in the paediatric population is judged as missing information and is 
addressed in the RMP. In addition, upon submission of the final results (24-month and 5-year data) of the 
Study IM101301, the MAH should follow-up on the issue of the possible effect of MTX on ADA formation 
and the age dependency of the ADA response. 
The MAH briefly discussed the possible immunogenic effect/adjuvant potential of the silicon contained in 
the different types of syringes, in vivo in children, especially in the younger age cohort of 2 to 5 years, and 
noted the numbers too small to conclude on this issue but gave sufficient reassurance for granting the 
indication.  However,  upon  submission  of  the  final  results  (24-month  and  5-year  data)  of  the  Study 
IM101301, the MAH should follow-up on the issue.  
No safety signal has been identified in the post marketing registry data.  
Long-term safety data from the study IM101033 has demonstrated sustained tolerability of up to 7 years 
of continuous IV abatacept treatment of JIA, with no new safety signals and no increases in incidence 
rates of AEs, SAEs, infections, malignancies, or autoimmune diseases.  
Indication 
The safety profiles of patient treated with SC abatacept with or without MTX appear alike and similar to 
previous reported abatacept safety data. No new or clinically significant safety signals were evident and 
discontinuations were rare, with no evident clustering.  
The overall safety (SAE, AE, and relatedness) of abatacept, for subjects with pJIA, who received prior 
biologic therapy and subjects who did not receive prior biologic therapy was similar during the 4-month, 
open-label periods of both studies IM101033 and IM101301.  
From the safety database the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Acknowledging the open label nature of the pivotal study IM101301, the safety profile of abatacept 
administered SC in children and adolescent 2 to 17 years of age, appears overall, similar to the paediatric 
patients treated with the IV and the adults population.   
The safety profiles of patient treated with SC abatacept with or without MTX and for subjects with pJIA, 
who received prior biologic therapy and subjects who did not receive prior biologic therapy, appear alike 
and similar to previous reported abatacept safety data.  
Assessment report  
EMA/126226/2019  
Page 82/100 
 
 
 
The currently available safety data are supported by the presented interim registry data.  
However, the data is limited and as with adults, infections, autoimmunity and malignancies remain 
potential serious risks. Thus, post approval management are required to monitor the long-term safety of 
abacacept in the 2-17 years old patients. The ongoing registry study protocol already recruits children 
from both age groups and will be updated with the current data of this application. The LT part of the 
study IM101301 has been extended up to five years, the duration of the study totalling 7 years in all. 
“Long-term safety in 2 to 5 year old patients with pJIA” and “Immunogenicity in paediatric patients” are 
stated as Missing information in the RMP and additional pharmacovigilance actions are implemented for 
these safety concerns. The abatacept long term database will in time be complemented by these data.  
The MAH should submit the final results (24-month and 5-year data) of the Study IM101301 as a category 
3 measure of the RMP. At the time of submission, the MAH should address the following safety aspects: 
MLA eosinophils, MLA (haematuria, RBC and WBC) in urine, the effect of MTX on ADA formation, age 
dependency of ADA response, AEs occurring within 24 hours in the pJIA studies, relatedness of AEs to 
study drug, immunogenic potential of the lubricant silicon oil.  
In conclusion, the pJIA indication for SC abatacept for children 2 to 17 years of age and the change of the 
indication to introduce abatacept monotherapy in case of MTX intolerance or when treatment with MTX is 
inappropriate and for positioning abacacept treatment in second line in the treatment of pJIA (i.e. the 
removal of “following treatment failure with TNF-inhibitors”) for both SC and IV formulations is considered 
acceptable from a safety perspective.  
2.7.  Conclusions on the extrapolation of previous IV paediatric data and the 
adult IV and SC data to the SC paediatric population  
1. Confirm that abatacept is efficacious with a favourable benefit-risk profile in adult subjects with RA (IV 
and SC). Confirm that abatacept is efficacious with a favourable benefit-risk profile in subjects with pJIA 
(IV) patients aged 6 to 17 years of age. These data together with current data from study IM101301 form 
the basis of extrapolation to paediatric pJIA subjects treated with SC abatacept. 
The data from development programmes for abatacept have shown that abatacept is efficacious with a 
positive benefit risk in both the adult RA (IV and SC) patients and in subjects with pJIA (IV) patients aged 
6 to 17 years of age. These data together with current data from study IM101301 where consistent and 
acceptable efficacy and persistence of effect up 24 months, also across various efficacy outcome variables 
and subgroups (including use of MTX use and prior use of biologics, namely TNF inhibitors) was shown. 
Importantly, the data were comparable to treatment effects seen in pJIA patients treated with the IV 
formulation in study IM101033, and showed consistency with historical efficacy data of the abatacept 
development program with both formulations (SC and IV) in adult RA and pJIA. Thus, overall, the 
provided data and the consistency of the efficacy results support the the extrapolation of the therapeutic 
use of abatacept in the treatment of pJIA.  
2. Confirm that abatacept PK in adults is predictive of PK in paediatrics following both IV administration 
and SC administration (predictability of the available paediatric data in pJIA 6 to 17 years) and confirm 
the consistency of the PK of abatacept in both adults and paediatric populations.  
Pharmacokinetics of abatacept in paediatric patients with pJIA was evaluated using population PK (PPK) 
analysis with data from all patients in two pJIA studies (Study IM101033, IV abatacept; Study IM101301, 
with SC abatacept) and 11 adult RA studies. The final model appeared to appropriately characterize the 
pharmacokinetics of abatacept in both paediatric pJIA and adult RA patients. Clearance and volume 
parameter values of the final PPK model were within ±15% to those of the previous IV abatacept model 
for adult RA patients and pJIA assessed previously in variation II/24.  
Assessment report  
EMA/126226/2019  
Page 83/100 
 
 
 
3. Provide supportive evidence that abatacept efficacy in adults treated with SC and IV abatacept with RA 
and  paediatric  pJIA  patients  treated  with  the  IV  abatacept  formulation  can  be  extrapolated  to  the  SC 
paediatric population (2 to 17 years of age) and that establishing this evidence is sufficient to extend this 
to the 2 to 5 years age group pJIA patients. 
Overall, the results of the open-label study IM101301 appear to support SC abatacept as an effective 
treatment option in pJIA. Overall, the main aim of the study, target therapeutic abatacept concentrations 
(Cmin), were reached and sustained showing consistent results on weight tiers and age strata at each 
time-point up to Day 113 and beyond up to 24 months. ACR paediatric 30 responses are considered as 
sufficient level of efficacy when compared to previous adult RA and paediatric IV pJIA data. From a clinical 
point of view the efficacy of SC abatacept was acceptable, acknowledging the limitations of uncontrolled 
data.  The proportion of JIA ACRp30 responders increased over time and reached 80.9% at Day 113 in the 
6 to 17 year-old cohort (secondary efficacy endpoint), with similar result (89.1%) observed in the 2 to 5 
year-old cohort. The results were similar across various endpoints and subgroups, and were also 
consistent with the IV study IM101033 data. 
Previous E-R analyses have shown that Cminss is the exposure parameter that best predicts the efficacy 
in RA. E-R efficacy analyses were now conducted in pJIA patients using combined data from studies 
IM101033 (IV abatacept) and IM101301 (SC abatacept). As in RA, Cminss was the best exposure 
parameter predicting the efficacy, defined as JIAACR response. No statistically significant covariates 
affecting the response were found in this analysis. Overall, it can be concluded that Cminss predicts the 
JIAACR response.  
The effect of concomitant MTX on the efficacy of abatacept in pJIA was further clarified and the results 
showed consistent and acceptable efficacy and safety results in the subgroups according to MTX use, prior 
biologics use, on subgroups on monotherapy, and with no imbalances in baseline values. 
The observed PK data were in line with modelling and were consistent with the historical data of the 
Orencia development programme.  
Thus, overall, the data show the consistency of the PK of abatacept in both adults and paediatric 
populations and support the current extrapolation concept.  
4. Evaluate the safety profile of the SC formulation of abatacept in the paediatric population (aged 2 to 17 
years)  with  pJIA  by  comparing  it  with  that  of  the  overall  phase  III  IV  and  SC  RA  and  IV  pJIA  clinical 
development programme. 
No new or clinically important safety signals were observed in the sole clinical study IM101301 relative to 
that for IV abatacept or relative to the overall Orencia safety database. AEs associated with the weekly 
body-weight-tiered SC abatacept dosing regimen in Study IM101301 were low in frequency, mostly mild, 
and consistent with the overall safety profile of abatacept. The AEs and SAEs, including events of interest 
related to immunomodulatory agents (i.e., infections, malignancies, and autoimmune disorders), were 
overall comparable to those seen in the larger abatacept program in RA. Discontinuations related to AEs 
were not numerous (8/173).  No consistent pattern or associations to certain time points were evident.  
Though the low prevalence of pJIA and small sample size, relative to studies of RA, could limit the ability 
of the trial to detect rare, but important safety events, results from abatacept trials support the long-term 
safety and tolerability of abatacept. Long-term safety data from the study IM101033 demonstrated 
sustained tolerability of up to 7 years of continuous IV abatacept treatment of JIA, with no new safety 
signals and no increases in incidence rates of AEs, SAEs, infections, malignancies, or autoimmune 
diseases.  In Study IM101301, overall, the safety profile if abatacept both age groups were similar to 
previous data. 
Assessment report  
EMA/126226/2019  
Page 84/100 
 
 
 
The presented interim safety results from the registry study IM101240 (database lock 31-Mar-2017) are 
also reassuring in that the safety profile of abatacept appears consistent with previous data. No deaths, 
malignancies or new autoimmune disease or targeted infections have been observed.  
In conclusion, the overall safety profile of SC abatacept in children and adolescents with active pJIA in 
study IM101301 appears consistent with the previously described safety profile of IV and SC abatacept 
both in adults and in the paediatric population and thus, overall, support the current extrapolation 
concept.  
Likewise, the current the safety profiles of patient treated with SC abatacept with or without MTX and for 
subjects with pJIA, who received prior biologic therapy and subjects who did not receive prior biologic 
therapy, appears alike and similar to previous reported abatacept safety data.  
5. Identify and plan for the mitigation of any remaining uncertainty and risk. 
The data is limited and as with adults, infections, autoimmunity and malignancies remain potential 
serious risks. Hence, at the CHMP’s request “Long-term safety in 2 to 5 year old patients with pJIA” and 
“immunogenicity in paediatric patients” have been added as missing information in the RMP. Two 
additional pharmacovigilance actions are linked to these safety concerns: submission of study IM101301, 
extending up to 7 years of treatment with abatacept in 2 to 17 year old subjects with pJIA and the ongoing 
observational registry study (IM101240), which already allows the recruitment of pJIA patient treated 
with the SC formulation in the 2 to 17 years old paediatric population, with the aim of accruing long term 
safety and effectiveness data in the SC abatacept treatment of pJIA. In addition, at the time of submission 
of the final results (24-month and 5-year data) of the Study IM101301, the MAH should address the 
following safety aspects: MLA eosinophils, MLA (haematuria, RBC and WBC) in urine, the effect of MTX on 
ADA formation, age dependency of ADA response, AEs occurring within 24 hours in the pJIA studies, 
relatedness of AEs to study drug, immunogenic potential of the lubricant silicon oil (see RMP section 2.8).

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a broad term that describes a clinically heterogeneous group of arthritis of 
unknown aetiology that begins before the age of 16 years and persists for at least 6 weeks. JIA is one of 
the most common chronic diseases of childhood and is an important cause of short- and long-term 
disability. The epidemiology for JIA varies depending on different global regions and method of analysis, 
the reported incidence rates being between 7-100/100,000, with a prevalence of 32 to 200/100,000. 
The current JIA classification scheme identifies seven clinical JIA subtypes based on phenotype, serology 
and associated features: rheumatoid factor (RF) positive and negative polyarthritis, extended 
oligoarthritis, persistent oligoarthritis, enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), 
systemic arthritis, and undifferentiated arthritis. Polyarticular JIA is a chronic disease that requires 
long-lasting treatment.  
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Polyarticular JIA is treated with the same medicinal products used for adult RA. Similarly to adult RA, 
emphasis is on early diagnosis and aggressive therapy, and closer disease monitoring (treat-to-target). 
Treatment now aims for disease remission i.e. minimal disease activity and quality of life approaching that 
of any other child. With this concept of a treatment window of opportunity, instead of a slower step-up 
pyramid approach, better long term outcomes are achieved.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Current treatment options include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, and 
biologic and non-biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). NSAIDs may be used alone 
when disease flares are intermittent and only mild to moderate in severity. Corticosteroids are used in the 
long-term management or in the treatment of disease.  
Second-line therapies include conventional non-biologic DMARDs such as MTX (usually the cornerstone of 
therapy) or leflunomide, typically in combination with NSAIDs. Several biologic DMARDs are approved to 
treat JIA typically as second- or third-line therapies. Commercially available biologic therapies for JIA can 
be classified into 3 broad categories by mechanism of action: TNF-alpha signalling inhibitors, interleukin 
(IL) signalling inhibitors, and T-cell or B-cell inhibitors. 
Non-biologic DMARDs, anti-TNF-alpha therapies, and cytokine inhibition therapies for JIA are not 
uniformly effective or tolerated. Some JIA subtypes respond differently, some patients do not respond, 
and other patients experience secondary loss of efficacy, often with an accompanying production of 
Assessment report  
EMA/126226/2019  
Page 92/100 
 
 
 
anti-drug antibodies. These therapies can also have significant toxicities that can force interruption or 
discontinuation of therapy. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Given similarities in the clinical presentation of adult and paediatric disease states (RA vs. pJIA) and 
formulations (IV vs. SC), consistency in therapeutic approach, consistency of abatacept mechanism of 
action, consistency of the PK/PD in both adults and children and relevance of the clinical endpoints for 
both efficacy and safety, an extrapolation approach was considered suitable to characterize the clinical 
profile of SC abatacept in pJIA. This approach, in which limited data was to be collected in the target 
population, with extrapolation of efficacy and safety data from source populations of the abatacept (IV 
and SC) in RA and pJIA (IV) development programme, was agreed on with the Paediatric Committee 
(PDCO). In this context, an open-label study and a PK modelling and simulation evaluation was 
considered appropriate in seeking approval for the use of SC abatacept to treat 2 to 17 year old children 
with moderate to severe active pJIA. 
The main study IM101301 was a Phase 3 Multi-center, Open-label to Evaluate Pharmacokinetics, Efficacy, 
and Safety of abatacept Administered Subcutaneously (SC) in Children and Adolescents with Active 
Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (pJIA) and Inadequate Response (IR) to Biologic or Non-biologic 
Disease Modifying Anti-rheumatic Drugs (DMARD). 
The study included two age cohorts (2 to 5 years and 6 to 17 year old).Paediatric patients with pJIA 
patients were treated with SC abatacept in short term for four months, followed by a long term treatment 
period 20 months (for a total of 24 months). Altogether 173 6 to 17 year old patients and 47 2 to 5 year 
old patients were entered to the study. Patient exposure in most subjects (70%) was at least 24 months 
of treatment. Final results on the long-term extension period for the 2 to 5 age group are pending, but 
thus far the duration of exposure was for both age groups essentially same as for the pooled population: 
for the 6-17 year old patients the mean (SD) exposure to SC abatacept over the cumulative period was 
21.8 (6.87) months with a median exposure of 24.3 months and for the 2-5 year old patients the mean 
(SD) exposure to SC abatacept over the cumulative period was 18.8 (7.26) months with a median 
duration of 24.1 months. The aim of the study was to demonstrate that providing a PK exposure (Cminss) 
similar to IV abatacept, using weight tiered fixed dosing of SC abatacept, would result in a similar efficacy 
and safety profile to that already established with IV abatacept.  
Study IM101033,  a double-blind, placebo-controlled withdrawal trial was the basis for approval of IV 
abatacept to treat children with pJIA 6 to 17 years old whose disease inadequately responded to other 
treatment options. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Limited, short term and long term, up to 24 months, clinical efficacy data is available from study 
IM101301. Target therapeutic abatacept concentrations (Cminss≥10 µg/mL), were reached and sustained 
showing consistent results also on weight tiers and age strata at each time-point up to day 113 and 
beyond up to 24 months.  
ACR paediatric 30 responses rates were of sufficient level of efficacy when compared to previous adult RA 
and paediatric IV pJIA data. The proportion of pJIA ACRp30 responders increased over time and reached 
80.9% in the 6 to 17 year-old cohort, with similar result (89.1%) observed in the 2 to 5 year-old cohort.  
The results were overall similar across various endpoints and other subgroups, including concomittant 
treatment with MTX and prior use of biologics, namely TNF inhibitor. The data were also consistent with 
historical IV abatacept data of study IM101033 and overall data of the Orencia development programme. 
Assessment report  
EMA/126226/2019  
Page 93/100 
 
 
 
Further analysis was performed on treatment effect and safety of abatacept with or without MTX 
treatment and the results were in line with the previous data of the Orencia development programme.  
The PK data from the two paediatric studies IM101033 and IM101301 indicated similar 
exposure/achieved steady state (Day 113) abatacept Cmin levels were comparable in subjects with and 
without concomitant MTX treatment. This was in agreement with and supports the result of population PK 
analysis, showing that the baseline concomitant MTX use was not a statistically significant covariate on 
the clearance of abatacept. Furthermore, modelling showed that MTX was not a significant covariate and 
did not affect the prediction of ACRp response in subjects with pJIA.  
Furthermore, no clinically meaningful, potentially confounding imbalances were clearly evident in 
baseline values. The Cmin values in the adult studies showed comparable exposure for the subgroups of 
subjects treated with abatacept with or without MTX.  
The clinical response to abatacept in pJIA patients treated with abatacept monotherapy and abatacept 
with MTX was studied in several settings. The ACRp30, ACRp50, ACRp70, and ACRp90 response results at 
Day 113 showed overall and consistently similar and acceptable efficacy, in both the IV and SC trials in 
pJIA. Importantly, similar acceptable efficacy on exposure surpassing the target threshold was also seen 
between subjects who received abatacept with MTX and those on abatacept monotherapy, in each age 
cohort, the combined cohort and at each ACRp response level.  
The presented data also showed that in both IM101033 and IM101301 studies, abatacept-treated 
subjects who did not receive prior biologic therapy had generally higher ACRp response 
(ACRp30/50/70/90) than subjects who received prior biologic therapy. This finding is not unexpected 
since subjects who have received previous biologic therapy are often refractory to further therapy. 
Importantly, this response rate was independent of MTX use in both the IV and SC pJIA studies.  
Furthermore, these observed data are in line and supportive of the results of the E-R analysis with the 
most recent (year 2018) JIAACR response model, where in addition to the baseline MTX use, prior use of 
TNF-alpha inhibitors was not significant covariate and did not affect predicted ACRp responses in subjects 
with pJIA. 
The relationship between abatacept exposure and efficacy in pJIA was characterized by an 
exposure-response (E-R) model using efficacy data from the two conducted clinical studies (IM101033 
with IV dosing; IM101301 with SC dosing). The model confirmed that, as in previous analyses in RA 
population, the Cminss is the best PK parameter predicting efficacy. Near maximal JIAACR 30 response 
was achieved at Cminss level of approximately 10 µg/mL. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
From quality point of view, the formulation composition is the same as the currently approved one and, 
for the new proposed pre-filled syringes, the device components, coming into contact with the solution, 
are the same as the approved one. 
The impact of modelling and simulation exercises in the application is high. No major deficiencies in 
population PK and exposure-response models were observed.  
Limited uncontrolled data is available for paediatric pJIA patients from study IM101301 and in agreement 
with the extrapolation approach, it is only supportive. Acknowledging the limitations of uncontrolled open 
label descriptive data, from a clinical point of view the efficacy of SC abatacept appears acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/126226/2019  
Page 94/100 
 
 
 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In Study IM101301, overall, the safety profile of abatacept in both age groups were similar to previous 
data.  
Acknowledging the limited numbers in paediatric patients treated with SC abatacept, and the open label 
nature of the clinical trial the overall safety profile appears similar to that of the IV trial IM101033 and in 
adults.  
In Study IM101301, the most frequently reported AEs were nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory 
infection in both the younger and the older age cohorts. No consistent pattern or associations to certain 
time points were evident. 
Overall, the SAE incidence rates were low. In the younger patients three (6.5%) and 14 (8.1%) of the 
older age group reposted SAEs. The SAEs of nephrolithiasis, stage III ovarian germ cell teratoma, sepsis, 
anaemia, and chest pain were classified as severe in intensity. SAEs of teratoma, sepsis, autonomic 
nervous system imbalance, and vertigo led to discontinuation of study drug. No SAE was reported to be 
very severe in intensity. Overall, in the cumulative period no clear trends were observed and the incidence 
rates were low. Each SAE occurred only once during the study and no clustering around any time point or 
age group was clearly evident.  
Discontinuations related to AEs were not numerous, and were reported in all for eight persons. The 
majority (95%) of subjects completed the 4 month ST period and 71% had completed the cumulative 
period at the time of DBL.  
No deaths were reported during the study.  
Overall infections were the most common AE of special interest. The rate and incidence of infections was 
similar across age groups and the duration of treatment.  
Only one malignancy was reported, but it was thought not to be related the study drug (teratoma). 
There were no reports of anaphylaxis in the paediatric patients. The rate of local injection site reactions 
appeared to be similar in both age groups and did not increase over time. They were few and mild or 
moderate in intensity.   
The current the safety profiles of patient treated with SC abatacept with or without MTX appears alike and 
similar to previous reported abatacept safety data.  
The overall safety (SAE, AE, and relatedness) of abatacept, for subjects with pJIA, who received prior 
biologic therapy and subjects who did not receive prior biologic therapy was also similar during the 
4-month, open-label periods of both studies IM101033 and IM101301. 
No new safety signal has been identified in the post marketing registry data.  
Long-term safety data from the study IM101033 have demonstrated sustained tolerability of up to 7 years 
of continuous IV abatacept treatment of JIA, with no new safety signals and no increases in incidence 
rates of AEs, SAEs, infections, malignancies, or autoimmune diseases.   
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The paediatric clinical trial safety database for the abatacept SC formulation in treatment of moderate to 
severe pJIA is so far limited to data from the pivotal study IM101301 and comprises of 173 pJIA patients 
in the 6 to17 age cohort and 47 pJIA patients in the 2 to 5 age cohort. A total of 220 paediatric patients 
were treated with at least one dose of the SC abatacept in the only SC pJIA clinical trial. The size of this 
safety data relative to studies of RA may limit the ability of the trial to detect rare safety concerns. Thus, 
Assessment report  
EMA/126226/2019  
Page 95/100 
 
 
 
adequate post approval management were included in the RMP to monitor the long-term safety of 
abacacept in the 2-17 years old patients (clinical trial IM101301 and the ongoing pediatric pJIA registry). 
The immunogenicity of abatacept in patients at the age of 2 to 5 seems not to be significantly different 
from that of the patients at 6 to 17 years of age. However, there was a trend for somewhat higher 
incidence of ADAs in the younger cohort. Acknowledging the uncertainty in indirect cross study 
comparisons, the CHMP agreed that, on the current data, there was no clear evidence of effects of 
immunogenicity on occurrence of PK, loss of efficacy, and the occurrence of AEs, in subjects who were 
ADA positive in study IM101033 and Study IM101301. Furthermore, the occurrence of ADAs was 
comparable or less to that in adults with SC abatacept or children treated with the IV formulation. 
However, the immunogenicity of paediatric patients of different age groups may differ and ADAs may be 
more frequently observed in the younger patient cohort of 2 to 5 years. Hence, at the CHMP’s request, 
immunogenicity in the paediatric population was addressed as missing information in the RMP. In 
addition, further insight on the possible effect of MTX on ADA formation and the age dependency of the 
ADA response will be provided by the MAH post authorisation by submission of the final results (24-month 
and 5-year data) of the Study IM101301 as outlined in the RMP.. 
3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
A SC route of administration provides pJIA patients and caregivers a self-administration alternative to IV 
dosing allowing for greater flexibility and subject compliance.  
In agreement with the Paediatric Committee (PDCO), an extrapolation approach was considered suitable 
to characterize the clinical profile of SC abatacept in pJIA. In line with this approach, limited data was 
collected in the target population (an open label, exposure, efficacy and safety study in pJIA patients), 
with extrapolation of efficacy and safety data from source populations of the studies of the abatacept (IV 
and SC) in RA and pJIA (IV) development programmes.  
The evidence to support an extrapolation strategy is based on the overlap in the clinical presentation of 
adult and paediatric, RA and pJIA, patients, consistency of formulations, consistency in the therapeutic 
approach, consistency of abatacept mechanism of action, consistency of the PK/PD in both adults and 
children and relevance of the clinical endpoints for both efficacy and safety. Given these similarities, an 
extrapolation approach is considered suitable to characterize the clinical profile of SC abatacept in 
treatment of pJIA. 
The MAH’s choice to characterize the clinical profile of SC abatacept in JIA using an extrapolation from IV 
abatacept in JIA is adequately justified. The population PK model and exposure-response model for 
efficacy appear to be adequate for the intended use. Clinical pharmacology aspects such as drug-drug 
interactions and effects of renal and/or hepatic dysfunction on PK have been previously addressed in the 
application for the IV formulation in treatment of JIA, and the highest strength of the proposed SC 
formulation has been approved for adult patients. Additional clinical pharmacology studies are not 
required in paediatric patients for the SC formulation in the applied indication. 
Results of study IM101301 confirmed that Cminss ≥10 µg/mL will be achieved with the selected 
weight-tiered dosing regimen. The most recent (year 2018) E-R model for efficacy indicated that MTX use 
was not a statistically significant covariate predicting the JIAACR response and that prior use of TNF-alpha 
inhibitors was not significant covariate and did not affect predicted ACRp responses in subjects with pJIA. 
The clinical data from the abatacept adults RA (IV and SC) development programme are considered 
relevant for both adults and paediatrics as consistent eligibility criteria were employed irrespective of age. 
The primary and key secondary endpoints in adult RA for exposure and efficacy were alike (ACR based

efficacy endpoints, Cmin). Overall, also other secondary and explorative outcomes were consistent 
between adults and paediatrics. In conclusion, the clinical efficacy and safety endpoint data from the adult 
RA (IV and SC) and the IV and SC pJIA programmes are considered relevant for both adults and the 
paediatric patients. 
From a clinical point of view the efficacy of SC abatacept was acceptable, acknowledging the limitations of 
uncontrolled data. The proportion of JIA ACRp30 responders increased over time and reached 80.9% at 
Day 113 in the 6 to 17 year-old cohort (secondary efficacy endpoint), with similar result (89.1%) 
observed in the 2 to 5 year-old cohort. The results were in general similar across various endpoints and 
subgroups, and were also consistent with historical IV abatacept data. 
Overall, the main aim of the study IM101301, target therapeutic abatacept concentrations (Cmin), were 
reached and sustained showing consistent results on weight tiers and age strata at each time-point up to 
Day 113 and beyond up to 24 months. ACR paediatric 30 responses are considered as sufficient level of 
efficacy when compared to previous adult RA and paediatric IV pJIA data.  
No new or clinically important safety signals were observed in the sole clinical study IM101301 relative to 
that for IV abatacept or relative to the overall Orencia safety database. AEs associated with the weekly 
body-weight-tiered SC abatacept dosing regimen in Study IM101301 were low in frequency, mostly mild, 
and consistent with the overall safety profile of abatacept. The AEs and SAEs, including events of interest 
related to immunomodulatory agents (i.e., infections, malignancies, and autoimmune disorders), were 
overall comparable to those seen in the larger abatacept program in RA. Discontinuations related to AEs 
were not numerous (8/173).  No consistent pattern or associations to certain time points were evident.  
Though the low prevalence of pJIA and small sample size, relative to studies of RA, could limit the ability 
of the trial to detect rare, but important safety events, results from abatacept trials support the long-term 
safety and tolerability of abatacept. Long-term safety data from the study IM101033 demonstrated 
sustained tolerability of up to 7 years of continuous IV abatacept treatment of JIA, with no new safety 
signals and no increases in incidence rates of AEs, SAEs, infections, malignancies, or autoimmune 
diseases.  In Study IM101301, overall, the safety profile if abatacept both age groups were similar to 
previous data. 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Acknowledging the nature of uncontrolled data and that the study for some patients is still on-going, the 
study IM101301 in the target population of 2 to 17 year old pJIA patients with active disease (a total of 
220 subjects), showed that therapy with weight tiered dosing of SC abatacept, targeted exposures and 
clinically relevant efficacy (measured with accepted and valid outcome measures) were reached and 
sustained up to the end (24 months) of the long-term extension period of the study. These results 
appeared consistent with historical data.  
Similar efficacy was shown in pJIA subjects treated with Orencia with or without MTX in Study IM101301 
(ACRp30 responses at Day 113 78.7% with MTX and 89.2% without MTX). The exposure-response 
modelling supports the proposed claim that SC Orencia can be given as monotherapy in case of 
intolerance to MTX or when treatment with MTX is inappropriate. The same claim is supported also for IV 
abatacept. Likewise, similar efficacy was shown in pJIA subjects who received prior biologic therapy and 
subjects who did not receive prior biologic therapy (ACRp30 responses at Day 113 X% and Y%, 
respectively). 
The overall safety profile of SC abatacept in children and adolescents with active pJIA in study IM101301 
appears consistent with the previously described safety profile of IV and SC abatacept both in adults and 
in the paediatric population and thus, overall, support the current extrapolation concept. Likewise, the 
safety profiles of patient treated with SC abatacept with or without MTX and for subjects with pJIA, who 
Assessment report  
EMA/126226/2019  
Page 97/100 
 
 
 
received prior biologic therapy and subjects who did not receive prior biologic therapy, appears alike and 
similar to previous reported abatacept safety data.  
As with adults, infections, autoimmunity and malignancies remain potential serious risks for abacacept. 
Thus, adequate post approval management were included in the RMP to monitor the long-term safety of 
abacacept in the 2-17 years old patients e.g. the currently ongoing open label clinical trial IM101301 and 
the ongoing pediatric pJIA registry. 
Considering the results from the population PK modelling analyses, and on the basis of the totality of the 
PK, efficacy and safety data provided, the CHMP concluded that the extrapolation exercise adequately 
supports the use of Orencia with the posology described in Section 4.2 of the SmPCs in the treatment of 
2-17y old pJIA patients. Thus, a new subcutaneous administration route for the 2 to 17 year age group, 
and thus a new patient group (namely paediatric pJIA patients of 2 to 6 years of age), and transitioning 
Orencia treatment of pJIA patients from 3rd line, after TNF inhibitors, to 2nd line (after 1st line treatment, 
e.g. methotrexate), and also use as monotherapy without methotrexate in case of intolerance to 
methotrexate or when treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate are approvable. In addition, two new 
strengths of an already approved pharmaceutical form and some other minor quality variations are 
approvable.  
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Orencia is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of Orencia 50 mg, 87.5 mg and 125 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe 
is favourable in the following indication: 
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
ORENCIA in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active 
polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) in paediatric patients 2 years of age and older who have 
had an inadequate response to previous DMARD therapy. 
ORENCIA can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when treatment with 
methotrexate is inappropriate. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) of the marketing authorisation for Orencia subject to 
the following conditions:

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
UMultiple myeloma 
Revlimid as monotherapy is indicated for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed 
multiple myeloma who have undergone autologous stem cell transplantation. 
Revlimid as combination therapy with dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone, or melphalan and 
prednisone (see section 4.2) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated multiple 
myeloma who are not eligible for transplant. 
Revlimid in combination with dexamethasone is indicated for the treatment of multiple myeloma in adult 
patients who have received at least one prior therapy. 
UMyelodysplastic syndromes 
Revlimid as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with transfusion-dependent anaemia 
due to low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes associated with an isolated deletion 5q 
cytogenetic abnormality when other therapeutic options are insufficient or inadequate. 
UMantle cell lymphoma 
Revlimid as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle 
cell lymphoma (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
UFollicular lymphoma 
Revlimid in combination with rituximab (anti-CD20 antibody) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients 
with previously treated follicular lymphoma (Grade 1 – 3a). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Revlimid treatment should be supervised by a physician experienced in the use of anti-cancer therapies.

For all indications described below: 
•  Dose is modified based upon clinical and laboratory findings (see section 4.4). 
•  Dose adjustments, during treatment and restart of treatment, are recommended to manage Grade 3 or 
4 thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, or other Grade 3 or 4 toxicity judged to be related to lenalidomide. 
In case of neutropenia, the use of growth factors in patient management should be considered. 
If less than 12 hours has elapsed since missing a dose, the patient can take the dose. If more than 
12 hours has elapsed since missing a dose at the normal time, the patient should not take the dose, 
but take the next dose at the normal time on the following day.

Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS)  
All patients should receive TLS prophylaxis (allopurinol, rasburicase or equivalent as per institutional 
guidelines) and be well hydrated (orally) during the first week of the first cycle or for a longer period if 
clinically indicated.  To monitor for TLS, patients should have a chemistry panel drawn weekly during the 
first cycle and as clinically indicated. 
Lenalidomide may be continued (maintain dose) in patients with laboratory TLS or Grade 1 clinical TLS, or 
at the physician’s discretion, reduce dose by one level and continue lenalidomide. Vigorous intravenous 
hydration should be provided and appropriate medical management according to the local standard of care, 
until correction of electrolyte abnormalities. Rasburicase therapy may be needed to reduce hyperuricaemia. 
Hospitalisation of the patient will be at physician’s discretion. 
In patients with Grade 2 to 4 clinical TLS, interrupt lenalidomide and obtain a chemistry panel weekly or as 
clinically indicated. Vigorous intravenous hydration should be provided and appropriate medical 
management according to the local standard of care, until correction of electrolyte abnormalities. 
Rasburicase therapy and hospitalisation will be at physician’s discretion. When the TLS resolves to Grade 0, 
restart lenalidomide at next lower dose per physician’s discretion (see section 4.4). 
Tumour flare reaction 
At the physician’s discretion, lenalidomide may be continued in patients with Grade 1 or 2 tumour flare 
reaction (TFR) without interruption or modification. At the physician’s discretion, therapy with non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), limited duration corticosteroids, and/or narcotic analgesics may be 
administered. In patients with Grade 3 or 4 TFR, withhold treatment with lenalidomide and initiate therapy 
with NSAIDs, corticosteroids and/or narcotic analgesics. When TFR resolves to ≤ Grade 1, restart 
lenalidomide treatment at the same dose level for the rest of the cycle. Patients may be treated for 
management of symptoms per the guidance for treatment of Grade 1 and 2 TFR (see section 4.4).  
UAll indications 
For other Grade 3 or 4 toxicities judged to be related to lenalidomide, treatment should be stopped and only 
restarted at next lower dose level when toxicity has resolved to ≤ Grade 2 depending on the physician’s 
discretion. 
Lenalidomide interruption or discontinuation should be considered for Grade 2 or 3 skin rash. Lenalidomide 
must be discontinued for angioedema, anaphylactic reaction, Grade 4 rash, exfoliative or bullous rash, or if 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) or Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and 
Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) is suspected and should not be resumed following discontinuation from these 
reactions.

Currently available pharmacokinetic data are described in section 5.2. Lenalidomide has been used in clinical 
trials in multiple myeloma patients up to 91 years of age, in myelodysplastic syndromes patients up to 
95 years of age and in mantle cell lymphoma patients up to 88 years of age (see section 5.1).  
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose 
selection and it would be prudent to monitor renal function. 
Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who are not eligible for transplant 
Patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma aged 75 years and older should be carefully assessed 
before treatment is considered (see section 4.4). 
For patients older than 75 years of age treated with lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone, the 
starting dose of dexamethasone is 20 mg once daily on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each 28-day treatment cycle. 
No dose adjustment is proposed for patients older than 75 years who are treated with lenalidomide in 
combination with melphalan and prednisone. 
In patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma aged 75 years and older who received lenalidomide, 
there was a higher incidence of serious adverse reactions and adverse reactions that led to treatment 
discontinuation. 
Lenalidomide combined therapy was less tolerated in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients older than 
75 years of age compared to the younger population. These patients discontinued at a higher rate due to 
intolerance (Grade 3 or 4 adverse events and serious adverse events), when compared to patients < 75 years. 
Multiple myeloma: patients with at least one prior therapy  
The percentage of multiple myeloma patients aged 65 or over was not significantly different between the 
lenalidomide/dexamethasone and placebo/dexamethasone groups. No overall difference in safety or efficacy 
was observed between these patients and younger patients, but greater pre-disposition of older individuals 
cannot be ruled out.  
Myelodysplastic syndromes 
For myelodysplastic syndromes patients treated with lenalidomide, no overall difference in safety and 
efficacy was observed between patients aged over 65 and younger patients. 
Mantle cell lymphoma 
For mantle cell lymphoma patients treated with lenalidomide, no overall difference in safety and efficacy 
was observed between patients aged 65 years or over compared with patients aged under 65 years of age.  
Follicular lymphoma 
For follicular lymphoma patients treated with lenalidomide in combination with rituximab, the overall rate of 
adverse events is similar for patients aged 65 years or over compared with patients under 65 years of age. No 
overall difference in efficacy was observed between the two age groups. 
• 
UPatients with renal impairment 
Lenalidomide is primarily excreted by the kidney; patients with greater degrees of renal impairment can have 
impaired treatment tolerance (see section 4.4). Care should be taken in dose selection and monitoring of 
renal function is advised. 
No dose adjustments are required for patients with mild renal impairment and multiple myeloma, 
myelodysplastic syndromes, mantle cell lymphoma, or follicular lymphoma. 
The following dose adjustments are recommended at the start of therapy and throughout treatment for 
patients with moderate or severe impaired renal function or end stage renal disease. 
There are no phase 3 trial experiences with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) (CLcr < 30 mL/min, requiring

UPatients with hepatic impairment 
Lenalidomide has not formally been studied in patients with impaired hepatic function and there are no 
specific dose recommendations. 
UMethod of administration  
Oral use.  
Revlimid capsules should be taken orally at about the same time on the scheduled days. The capsules should 
not be opened, broken or chewed. The capsules should be swallowed whole, preferably with water, either 
with or without food. 
It is recommended to press only on one end of the capsule to remove it from the blister thereby reducing the 
risk of capsule deformation or breakage. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
• 
•  Women who are pregnant.  
•  Women of childbearing potential unless all of the conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme 
are met (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
When lenalidomide is given in combination with other medicinal products, the corresponding 
Summary of Product Characteristics must be consulted prior to initiation of treatment.  
UPregnancy warning 
Lenalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide. Thalidomide is a known human teratogenic active 
substance that causes severe life-threatening birth defects. Lenalidomide induced in monkeys’ malformations 
similar to those described with thalidomide (see sections 4.6 and 5.3). If lenalidomide is taken during 
pregnancy, a teratogenic effect of lenalidomide in humans is expected. 
The conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme must be fulfilled for all patients unless there is 
reliable evidence that the patient does not have childbearing potential. 
UCriteria for women of non-childbearing potential 
A female patient or a female partner of a male patient is considered to have childbearing potential unless she 
meets at least one of the following criteria: 
• 
Age ≥ 50 years and naturally amenorrhoeic for ≥ 1 year (Amenorrhoea following cancer therapy or 
during breast-feeding does not rule out childbearing potential). 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
Premature ovarian failure confirmed by a specialist gynaecologist 
Previous bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, or hysterectomy 
XY genotype, Turner syndrome, uterine agenesis. 
UCounselling 
For women of childbearing potential, lenalidomide is contraindicated unless all of the following are met: 
• 
• 
She understands the expected teratogenic risk to the unborn child 
She understands the need for effective contraception, without interruption, at least 4 weeks before 
starting treatment, throughout the entire duration of treatment, and at least 4 weeks after the end of 
treatment 
Even if a woman of childbearing potential has amenorrhea she must follow all the advice on effective 
contraception 
She should be capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures 
She is informed and understands the potential consequences of pregnancy and the need to rapidly 
consult if there is a risk of pregnancy 
She understands the need to commence the treatment as soon as lenalidomide is dispensed following a 
negative pregnancy test 
She understands the need and accepts to undergo pregnancy testing at least every 4 weeks except in 
case of confirmed tubal sterilisation 
She acknowledges that she understands the hazards and necessary precautions associated with the use 
of lenalidomide. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
For male patients taking lenalidomide, pharmacokinetic data has demonstrated that lenalidomide is present in 
human semen at extremely low levels during treatment and is undetectable in human semen 3 days after 
stopping the substance in the healthy subject (see section 5.2). As a precaution and taking into account 
special populations with prolonged elimination time such as renal impairment, all male patients taking 
lenalidomide must meet the following conditions: 
• 
Understand the expected teratogenic risk if engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant woman or a 
woman of childbearing potential 
Understand the need for the use of a condom if engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant woman or a 
woman of childbearing potential not using effective contraception (even if the man has had a 
vasectomy), during treatment and for at least 7 days after dose interruptions and/or cessation of 
treatment. 
Understand that if his female partner becomes pregnant whilst he is taking Revlimid or shortly after he 
has stopped taking Revlimid, he should inform his treating physician immediately and that it is 
recommended to refer the female partner to a physician specialised or experienced in teratology for 
evaluation and advice. 
• 
• 
The prescriber must ensure that for women of childbearing potential: 
• 
The patient complies with the conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme, including 
confirmation that she has an adequate level of understanding 
The patient has acknowledged the aforementioned conditions. 
• 
UContraception 
Women of childbearing potential must use at least one effective method of contraception for at least 4 weeks 
before therapy, during therapy, and until at least 4 weeks after lenalidomide therapy and even in case of dose 
interruption unless the patient commits to absolute and continuous abstinence confirmed on a monthly basis. 
If not established on effective contraception, the patient must be referred to an appropriately trained health 
care professional for contraceptive advice in order that contraception can be initiated.  
The following can be considered to be examples of suitable methods of contraception: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Implant 
Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (IUS) 
Medroxyprogesterone acetate depot 
Tubal sterilisation 
Sexual intercourse with a vasectomised male partner only; vasectomy must be confirmed by two 
negative semen analyses 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Ovulation inhibitory progesterone-only pills (i.e. desogestrel) 
Because of the increased risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with multiple myeloma taking 
lenalidomide in combination therapy, and to a lesser extent in patients with multiple myeloma, 
myelodysplastic syndromes and mantle cell lymphoma taking lenalidomide monotherapy, combined oral 
contraceptive pills are not recommended (see also section 4.5). If a patient is currently using combined oral 
contraception the patient should switch to one of the effective methods listed above. The risk of venous 
thromboembolism continues for 4−6 weeks after discontinuing combined oral contraception. The efficacy of 
contraceptive steroids may be reduced during co-treatment with dexamethasone (see section 4.5). 
Implants and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems are associated with an increased risk of infection 
at the time of insertion and irregular vaginal bleeding. Prophylactic antibiotics should be considered 
particularly in patients with neutropenia. 
Copper-releasing intrauterine devices are generally not recommended due to the potential risks of infection 
at the time of insertion and menstrual blood loss which may compromise patients with neutropenia or 
thrombocytopenia. 
UPregnancy testing 
According to local practice, medically supervised pregnancy tests with a minimum sensitivity of 25 mIU/mL 
must be performed for women of childbearing potential as outlined below. This requirement includes women 
of childbearing potential who practice absolute and continuous abstinence. Ideally, pregnancy testing, issuing 
a prescription and dispensing should occur on the same day. Dispensing of lenalidomide to women of 
childbearing potential should occur within 7 days of the prescription. 
Prior to starting treatment 
A medically supervised pregnancy test should be performed during the consultation, when lenalidomide is 
prescribed, or in the 3 days prior to the visit to the prescriber once the patient had been using effective 
contraception for at least 4 weeks. The test should ensure the patient is not pregnant when she starts 
treatment with lenalidomide. 
Follow-up and end of treatment 
A medically supervised pregnancy test should be repeated at least every 4 weeks, including at least 4 weeks 
after the end of treatment, except in the case of confirmed tubal sterilisation. These pregnancy tests should be 
performed on the day of the prescribing visit or in the 3 days prior to the visit to the prescriber. 
UAdditional precautions 
Patients should be instructed never to give this medicinal product to another person and to return any unused 
capsules to their pharmacist at the end of treatment for safe disposal. 
Patients should not donate blood, semen or sperm during treatment (including during dose interruptions) and 
for at least 7 days following discontinuation of lenalidomide. 
Healthcare professionals and caregivers should wear disposable gloves when handling the blister or capsule. 
Women who are pregnant or suspect they may be pregnant should not handle the blister or capsule (see 
section 6.6). 
UEducational materials, prescribing and dispensing restrictions 
In order to assist patients in avoiding foetal exposure to lenalidomide, the Marketing Authorisation Holder 
will provide educational material to healthcare professionals to reinforce the warnings about the expected 
teratogenicity of lenalidomide, to provide advice on contraception before treatment is started, and to provide 
guidance on the need for pregnancy testing. The prescriber must inform the patient about the expected 
teratogenic risk and the strict pregnancy prevention measures as specified in the Pregnancy Prevention 
Programme and provide patients with appropriate patient educational brochure, patient card and/or 
equivalent tool as agreed with each National Competent Authority. In collaboration with each National 
Competent Authority, a controlled access programme has been implemented which includes the use of a 
patient card and/or equivalent tool for prescribing and/or dispensing controls, and the collection of 
information relating to the indication in order to monitor the off-label use within the national territory. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ideally, pregnancy testing, issuing a prescription and dispensing should occur on the same day. Dispensing 
of lenalidomide to women of childbearing potential should occur within 7 days of the prescription and 
following a medically supervised negative pregnancy test result. Prescriptions for women of childbearing 
potential can be for a maximum duration of treatment of 4 weeks according to the approved indications 
dosing regimens (see section 4.2), and prescriptions for all other patients can be for a maximum duration of 
treatment of 12 weeks. 
UOther special warnings and precautions for use 
UMyocardial infarction 
Myocardial infarction has been reported in patients receiving lenalidomide, particularly in those with known 
risk factors and within the first 12 months when used in combination with dexamethasone. Patients with 
known risk factors – including prior thrombosis – should be closely monitored, and action should be taken to 
try to minimize all modifiable risk factors (eg. smoking, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia). 
UVenous and arterial thromboembolic events 
In patients with multiple myeloma, the combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone is associated with 
an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (predominantly deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary 
embolism). The risk of venous thromboembolism was seen to a lesser extent with lenalidomide in 
combination with melphalan and prednisone.  
In patients with multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndromes and mantle cell lymphoma, treatment with 
lenalidomide monotherapy was associated with a lower risk of venous thromboembolism (predominantly 
deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) than in patients with multiple myeloma treated with 
lenalidomide in combination therapy (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). 
In patients with multiple myeloma, the combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone is associated with 
an increased risk of arterial thromboembolism (predominantly myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular 
event) and was seen to a lesser extent with lenalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone. The 
risk of arterial thromboembolism is lower in patients with multiple myeloma treated with lenalidomide 
monotherapy than in patients with multiple myeloma treated with lenalidomide in combination therapy. 
Consequently, patients with known risk factors for thromboembolism – including prior thrombosis – should 
be closely monitored. Action should be taken to try to minimize all modifiable risk factors (e.g. smoking, 
hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia). Concomitant administration of erythropoietic agents or previous history 
of thromboembolic events may also increase thrombotic risk in these patients. Therefore, erythropoietic 
agents, or other agents that may increase the risk of thrombosis, such as hormone replacement therapy, 
should be used with caution in multiple myeloma patients receiving lenalidomide with dexamethasone. A 
haemoglobin concentration above 12 g/dl should lead to discontinuation of erythropoietic agents. 
Patients and physicians are advised to be observant for the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism. 
Patients should be instructed to seek medical care if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, 
chest pain, arm or leg swelling. Prophylactic antithrombotic medicines should be recommended, especially 
in patients with additional thrombotic risk factors. The decision to take antithrombotic prophylactic measures 
should be made after careful assessment of an individual patient’s underlying risk factors. 
If the patient experiences any thromboembolic events, treatment must be discontinued and standard 
anticoagulation therapy started. Once the patient has been stabilised on the anticoagulation treatment and any 
complications of the thromboembolic event have been managed, the lenalidomide treatment may be restarted 
at the original dose dependent upon a benefit risk assessment. The patient should continue anticoagulation 
therapy during the course of lenalidomide treatment. 
UPulmonary hypertension 
Cases of pulmonary hypertension, some fatal, have been reported in patients treated with lenalidomide. 
Patients should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of underlying cardiopulmonary disease prior to 
initiating and during lenalidomide therapy. 
UNeutropenia and thrombocytopenia 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The major dose limiting toxicities of lenalidomide include neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. A complete 
blood cell count, including white blood cell count with differential count, platelet count, haemoglobin, and 
haematocrit should be performed at baseline, every week for the first 8 weeks of lenalidomide treatment and 
monthly thereafter to monitor for cytopenias. In mantle cell lymphoma patients, the monitoring scheme 
should be every 2 weeks in cycles 3 and 4, and then at the start of each cycle. In follicular lymphoma, the 
monitoring scheme should be weekly for the first 3 weeks of cycle 1 (28 days), every 2 weeks during cycles 
2 through 4, and then at the start of each cycle thereafter. A dose interruption and/or a dose reduction may be 
required (see section 4.2).  
In case of neutropenia, the physician should consider the use of growth factors in patient management. 
Patients should be advised to promptly report febrile episodes.  
Patients and physicians are advised to be observant for signs and symptoms of bleeding, including petechiae 
and epistaxis, especially in patients receiving concomitant medicinal products susceptible to induce bleeding 
(see section 4.8, Haemorrhagic disorders). 
Co-administration of lenalidomide with other myelosuppressive agents should be undertaken with caution.

UNewly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who have undergone ASCT treated with lenalidomide 
maintenance 
The adverse reactions from CALGB 100104 included events reported post-high dose melphalan and ASCT 
(HDM/ASCT) as well as events from the maintenance treatment period. A second analysis identified events 
that occurred after the start of maintenance treatment. In IFM 2005-02, the adverse reactions were from the 
maintenance treatment period only. 
Overall, Grade 4 neutropenia was observed at a higher frequency in the lenalidomide maintenance arms 
compared to the placebo maintenance arms in the 2 studies evaluating lenalidomide maintenance in NDMM 
patients who have undergone ASCT (32.1% vs 26.7% [16.1% vs 1.8% after the start of maintenance 
treatment] in CALGB 100104 and 16.4% vs 0.7% in IFM 2005-02, respectively). Treatment-emergent AEs 
of neutropenia leading to lenalidomide discontinuation were reported in 2.2% of patients in CALGB 100104 
and 2.4% of patients in IFM 2005-02, respectively. Grade 4 febrile neutropenia was reported at similar 
frequencies in the lenalidomide maintenance arms compared to placebo maintenance arms in both studies 
(0.4% vs 0.5% [0.4% vs 0.5% after the start of maintenance treatment] in CALGB 100104 and 0.3% vs 0% 
in IFM 2005-02, respectively). Patients should be advised to promptly report febrile episodes, a treatment 
interruption and/or dose reduction may be required (see section 4.2). 
Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was observed at a higher frequency in the lenalidomide maintenance arms 
compared to the placebo maintenance arms in studies evaluating lenalidomide maintenance in NDMM 
patients who have undergone ASCT (37.5% vs 30.3% [17.9% vs 4.1% after the start of maintenance 
treatment] in CALGB 100104 and 13.0% vs 2.9% in IFM 2005-02, respectively). Patients and physicians are 
advised to be observant for signs and symptoms of bleeding, including petechiae and epistaxes, especially in 
patients receiving concomitant medicinal products susceptible to induce bleeding (see section 4.8, 
Haemorrhagic disorders). 
• 
UNewly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who are not eligible for transplant treated with 
lenalidomide in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone 
Grade 4 neutropenia was observed at a lower frequency in the lenalidomide in combination with bortezomib 
and dexamethasone (RVd) arm compared to the Rd comparator arm (2.7% vs 5.9%) in the SWOG S0777 
study. Grade 4 febrile neutropenia was reported at similar frequencies in the RVd arm and Rd arm (0.0% vs 
0.4%). Patients should be advised to promptly report febrile episodes; a treatment interruption and/or dose 
reduction may be required (see section 4.2). 
Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was observed at a higher frequency in the RVd arm compared to the Rd 
comparator arm (17.2 % vs 9.4%). 
• 
UNewly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who are not eligible for transplant treated with 
lenalidomide in combination with low dose dexamethasone 
Grade 4 neutropenia was observed in the lenalidomide arms in combination with dexamethasone to a lesser 
extent than in the comparator arm (8.5% in the Rd [continuous treatment] and Rd18 [treatment for 18 four-
week cycles] compared with 15% in the melphalan/prednisone/thalidomide arm, see section 4.8). Grade 4 
febrile neutropenia episodes were consistent with the comparator arm (0.6 % in the Rd and Rd18

lenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated patients compared with 0.7% in the melphalan/prednisone/thalidomide 
arm, see section 4.8). 
Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was observed to a lesser extent in the Rd and Rd18 arms than in the 
comparator arm (8.1% vs 11.1%, respectively).

UNewly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who are not eligible for transplant treated with 
lenalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone 
The combination of lenalidomide with melphalan and prednisone in clinical trials of newly diagnosed 
multiple myeloma patients is associated with a higher incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia (34.1% in 
melphalan, prednisone and lenalidomide arm followed by lenalidomide [MPR+R] and melphalan, prednisone 
and lenalidomide followed by placebo [MPR+p] treated patients compared with 7.8% in MPp+p-treated 
patients; see section 4.8). Grade 4 febrile neutropenia episodes were observed infrequently (1.7% in 
MPR+R/MPR+p treated patients compared to 0.0% in MPp+p treated patients; see section 4.8). 
The combination of lenalidomide with melphalan and prednisone in multiple myeloma patients is associated 
with a higher incidence of Grade 3 and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (40.4% in MPR+R/MPR+p treated 
patients, compared with 13.7% in MPp+p-treated patients; see section 4.8). 
• 
UMultiple myeloma: patients with at least one prior therapy 
The combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone in multiple myeloma patients with at least one prior 
therapy is associated with a higher incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia (5.1% in lenalidomide/dexamethasone-
treated patients compared with 0.6% in placebo/dexamethasone-treated patients; see section 4.8). Grade 4 
febrile neutropenia episodes were observed infrequently (0.6% in lenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated 
patients compared to 0.0% in placebo/dexamethasone treated patients; see section 4.8). 
The combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone in multiple myeloma patients is associated with a 
higher incidence of Grade 3 and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (9.9% and 1.4%, respectively, in 
lenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated patients compared to 2.3% and 0.0% in placebo/dexamethasone-treated 
patients; see section 4.8). 
• 
UMyelodysplastic syndromes 
Lenalidomide treatment in myelodysplastic syndromes patients is associated with a higher incidence of 
Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia compared to patients on placebo (see section 4.8).  
• 
UMantle cell lymphoma 
Lenalidomide treatment in mantle cell lymphoma patients is associated with a higher incidence of Grade 3 
and 4 neutropenia compared with patients on the control arm (see section 4.8). 
• 
UFollicular lymphoma 
The combination of lenalidomide with rituximab in follicular lymphoma patients is associated with a higher 
incidence of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia compared with patients on the placebo/rituximab arm. Febrile 
neutropenia and Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia were more commonly observed in the lenalidomide/ 
rituximab arm (see section 4.8).  
UThyroid disorders 
Cases of hypothyroidism and cases of hyperthyroidism have been reported. Optimal control of co-morbid 
conditions influencing thyroid function is recommended before start of treatment. Baseline and ongoing 
monitoring of thyroid function is recommended. 
UPeripheral neuropathy 
Lenalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide, which is known to induce severe peripheral neuropathy.  
There was no increase in peripheral neuropathy observed with lenalidomide in combination with 
dexamethasone or melphalan and prednisone or lenalidomide monotherapy or with long term use of 
lenalidomide for the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. 
The combination of lenalidomide with intravenous bortezomib and dexamethasone in multiple myeloma 
patients is associated with a higher frequency of peripheral neuropathy. The frequency was lower when 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
bortezomib was administered subcutaneously. For additional information, see Section 4.8 and the SmPC for 
bortezomib. 
UTumour flare reaction and tumour lysis syndrome 
Because lenalidomide has anti-neoplastic activity, the complications of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) may 
occur. Cases of TLS and tumour flare reaction (TFR), including fatal cases, have been reported (see section 
4.8). The patients at risk of TLS and TFR are those with high tumour burden prior to treatment. Caution 
should be practiced when introducing these patients to lenalidomide. These patients should be monitored 
closely, especially during the first cycle or dose-escalation, and appropriate precautions taken. 
• 
UMantle cell lymphoma 
Careful monitoring and evaluation for TFR is recommended. Patients with high mantle cell lymphoma 
International Prognostic Index (MIPI) at diagnosis or bulky disease (at least one lesion that is ≥ 7 cm in the 
longest diameter) at baseline may be at risk of TFR. Tumour flare reaction may mimic progression of disease 
(PD). Patients in studies MCL-002 and MCL-001 that experienced Grade 1 and 2 TFR were treated with 
corticosteroids, NSAIDs and/or narcotic analgesics for management of TFR symptoms. The decision to take 
therapeutic measures for TFR should be made after careful clinical assessment of the individual patient (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
• 
UFollicular lymphoma  
Careful monitoring and evaluation for TFR is recommended. Tumour flare may mimic PD. Patients who 
experienced Grade 1 and 2 TFR were treated with corticosteroids, NSAIDs and/or narcotic analgesics for 
management of TFR symptoms. The decision to take therapeutic measures for TFR should be made after 
careful clinical assessment of the individual patient (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
Careful monitoring and evaluation for TLS is recommended.  Patients should be well hydrated and receive 
TLS prophylaxis, in addition to weekly chemistry panels during the first cycle or longer, as clinically 
indicated (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
UTumour burden  
• 
UMantle cell lymphoma 
Lenalidomide  is  not  recommended  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  high  tumour  burden  if  alternative 
treatment options are available.  
Early death 
In study MCL-002 there was overall an apparent increase in early (within 20 weeks) deaths. Patients with 
high tumour burden at baseline are at increased risk of early death, there were 16/81 (20%) early deaths in 
the lenalidomide arm and 2/28 (7%) early deaths in the control arm. Within 52 weeks corresponding figures 
were 32/81 (40%) and 6/28 (21%) (See section 5.1).  
Adverse events 
In study MCL-002, during treatment cycle 1, 11/81 (14%) patients with high tumour burden were withdrawn 
from therapy in the lenalidomide arm vs. 1/28 (4%) in the control group. The main reason for treatment 
withdrawal for patients with high tumour burden during treatment cycle 1 in the lenalidomide arm was 
adverse events, 7/11 (64%).  
Patients with high tumour burden should therefore be closely monitored for adverse reactions (see Section 
4.8) including signs of tumour flare reaction (TFR). Please refer to section 4.2 for dose adjustments for TFR. 
High tumour burden was defined as at least one lesion ≥5 cm in diameter or 3 lesions ≥3 cm.  
UAllergic reactions and severe skin reactions 
Cases of allergic reactions including angioedema, anaphylactic reaction and severe cutaneous reactions 
including SJS, TEN and DRESS have been reported in patients treated with lenalidomide (see section 4.8). 
Patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms of these reactions by their prescribers and should be 
told to seek medical attention immediately if they develop these symptoms. Lenalidomide must be 
discontinued for angioedema, anaphylactic reaction, exfoliative or bullous rash, or if SJS, TEN or DRESS is 
suspected, and should not be resumed following discontinuation for these reactions. Interruption or 
discontinuation of lenalidomide should be considered for other forms of skin reaction depending on severity. 
Patients who had previous allergic reactions while treated with thalidomide should be monitored closely, as a 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
possible cross-reaction between lenalidomide and thalidomide has been reported in the literature. Patients 
with a history of severe rash associated with thalidomide treatment should not receive lenalidomide. 
ULactose intolerance 
Revlimid capsules contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp 
lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
USecond primary malignancies 
An increase of second primary malignancies (SPM) has been observed in clinical trials in previously treated 
myeloma patients receiving lenalidomide/dexamethasone (3.98 per 100 person-years) compared to controls 
(1.38 per 100 person-years). Non-invasive SPM comprise basal cell or squamous cell skin cancers. Most of 
the invasive SPMs were solid tumour malignancies. 
In clinical trials of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients not eligible for transplant, a 4.9-fold increase 
in incidence rate of hematologic SPM (cases of AML, MDS) has been observed in patients receiving 
lenalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone until progression (1.75 per 100 person-years) 
compared with melphalan in combination with prednisone (0.36 per 100 person-years).  
A 2.12-fold increase in incidence rate of solid tumour SPM has been observed in patients receiving 
lenalidomide (9 cycles) in combination with melphalan and prednisone (1.57 per 100 person-years) 
compared with melphalan in combination with prednisone (0.74 per 100 person-years).  
In patients receiving lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone until progression or for 18 months, 
the hematologic SPM incidence rate (0.16 per 100 person-years) was not increased as compared to 
thalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone (0.79 per 100 person-years).  
A 1.3-fold increase in incidence rate of solid tumour SPM has been observed in patients receiving 
lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone until progression or for 18 months (1.58 per 100 person-
years) compared to thalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone (1.19 per 100 person-years). 
In newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients receiving lenalidomide in combination with bortezomib and 
dexamethasone, the hematologic SPM incidence rate was 0.00 – 0.16 per 100 person-years and the incidence 
rate of solid tumour SPM was 0.21 – 1.04 per 100 person-years. 
The increased risk of secondary primary malignancies associated with lenalidomide is relevant also in the 
context of NDMM after stem cell transplantation. Though this risk is not yet fully characterized, it should be 
kept in mind when considering and using Revlimid in this setting. 
The incidence rate of hematologic malignancies, most notably AML, MDS and B-cell malignancies 
(including Hodgkin’s lymphoma), was 1.31 per 100 person-years for the lenalidomide arms and 0.58 per 100 
person-years for the placebo arms (1.02 per 100 person-years for patients exposed to lenalidomide after 
ASCT and 0.60 per 100 person-years for patients not-exposed to lenalidomide after ASCT). The incidence 
rate of solid tumour SPMs was 1.36 per 100 person-years for the lenalidomide arms and 1.05 per 100 person-
years for the placebo arms (1.26 per 100 person-years for patients exposed to lenalidomide after ASCT and 
0.60 per 100 person-years for patients not-exposed to lenalidomide after ASCT).   
The risk of occurrence of hematologic SPM must be taken into account before initiating treatment with 
lenalidomide either in combination with melphalan or immediately following high-dose melphalan and 
ASCT. Physicians should carefully evaluate patients before and during treatment using standard cancer 
screening for occurrence of SPM and institute treatment as indicated. 
UProgression to acute myeloid leukaemia in low- and intermediate-1-risk MDS 
• 
UKaryotype 
Baseline variables including complex cytogenetics are associated with progression to AML in subjects who 
are transfusion dependent and have a Del (5q) abnormality. In a combined analysis of two clinical trials of 
lenalidomide in low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes, subjects who had a complex 
cytogenetics had the highest estimated 2-year cumulative risk of progression to AML (38.6%). The estimated 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2-year rate of progression to AML in patients with an isolated Del (5q) abnormality was 13.8%, compared to 
17.3% for patients with Del (5q) and one additional cytogenetic abnormality. 
As a consequence, the benefit/risk ratio of lenalidomide when MDS is associated with Del (5q) and complex 
cytogenetics is unknown.  
• 
UTP53 status 
A TP53 mutation is present in 20 to 25% of lower-risk MDS Del 5q patients and is associated with a higher 
risk of progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). In a post-hoc analysis of a clinical trial of 
lenalidomide in low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS-004), the estimated 2-year 
rate of progression to AML was 27.5 % in patients with IHC-p53 positivity (1% cut-off level of strong 
nuclear staining, using immunohistochemical assessment of p53 protein as a surrogate for TP53 mutation 
status) and 3.6% in patients with IHC-p53 negativity (p=0.0038) (see section 4.8) 
UProgression to other malignancies in mantle cell lymphoma 
In mantle cell lymphoma, AML, B-cell malignancies and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) are identified 
risks. 
USecond primary malignancies in follicular lymphoma 
In a relapsed/refractory iNHL study which included follicular lymphoma patients, no increased risk of SPMs 
in the lenalidomide/rituximab arm, compared to the placebo/rituximab arm, was observed. Hematologic SPM 
of AML occurred in 0.29 per 100 person-years in the lenalidomide/rituximab arm compared with 0.29 per 
100 person-years in patients receiving placebo/rituximab. The incidence rate of hematologic plus solid 
tumour SPMs (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers) was 0.87 per 100 person-years in the 
lenalidomide/rituximab arm, compared to 1.17 per 100 person-years in patients receiving placebo/rituximab 
with a median follow-up of 30.59 months (range 0.6 to 50.9 months).  
Non-melanoma skin cancers are identified risks and comprise squamous cell carcinomas of skin or basal cell 
carcinomas. 
Physicians should monitor patients for the development of SPMs. Both the potential benefit of lenalidomide 
and the risk of SPMs should be considered when considering treatment with lenalidomide. 
UHepatic disorders 
Hepatic failure, including fatal cases, has been reported in patients treated with lenalidomide in combination 
therapy: acute hepatic failure, toxic hepatitis, cytolytic hepatitis, cholestatic hepatitis, and mixed 
cytolytic/cholestatic hepatitis have been reported. The mechanisms of severe drug-induced hepatotoxicity 
remain unknown although, in some cases, pre-existing viral liver disease, elevated baseline liver enzymes, 
and possibly treatment with antibiotics might be risk factors. 
Abnormal liver function tests were commonly reported and were generally asymptomatic and reversible 
upon dosing interruption. Once parameters have returned to baseline, treatment at a lower dose may be 
considered.  
Lenalidomide is excreted by the kidneys. It is important to dose adjust patients with renal impairment in 
order to avoid plasma levels which may increase the risk for higher haematological adverse reactions or 
hepatotoxicity. Monitoring of liver function is recommended, particularly when there is a history of or 
concurrent viral liver infection or when lenalidomide is combined with medicinal products known to be 
associated with liver dysfunction. 
UInfection with or without neutropenia 
Patients with multiple myeloma are prone to develop infections including pneumonia. A higher rate of 
infections was observed with lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone than with MPT in patients 
with NDMM who are not eligible for transplant, and with lenalidomide maintenance compared to placebo in 
patients with NDMM who had undergone ASCT. Grade ≥ 3 infections occurred within the context of 
neutropenia in less than one-third of the patients. Patients with known risk factors for infections should be 
closely monitored. All patients should be advised to seek medical attention promptly at the first sign of 
infection (eg, cough, fever, etc) thereby allowing for early management to reduce severity. 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
UViral reactivation 
Cases of viral reactivation have been reported in patients receiving lenalidomide, including serious cases of 
herpes zoster or hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation. 
Some of the cases of viral reactivation had a fatal outcome. 
Some of the cases of herpes zoster reactivation resulted in disseminated herpes zoster, meningitis herpes 
zoster or ophthalmic herpes zoster requiring a temporary hold or permanent discontinuation of the treatment 
with lenalidomide and adequate antiviral treatment. 
Reactivation of hepatitis B has been reported rarely in patients receiving lenalidomide who have previously 
been infected with the hepatitis B virus. Some of these cases have progressed to acute hepatic failure 
resulting in discontinuation of lenalidomide and adequate antiviral treatment. Hepatitis B virus status should 
be established before initiating treatment with lenalidomide. For patients who test positive for HBV 
infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of hepatitis B is recommended. 
Caution should be exercised when lenalidomide is used in patients previously infected with HBV, including 
patients who are anti-HBc positive but HBsAg negative. These patients should be closely monitored for 
signs and symptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy. 
UProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 
Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), including fatal cases, have been reported with 
lenalidomide. PML was reported several months to several years after starting the treatment with 
lenalidomide. Cases have generally been reported in patients taking concomitant dexamethasone or prior 
treatment with other immunosuppressive chemotherapy. Physicians should monitor patients at regular 
intervals and should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients with new or worsening 
neurological symptoms, cognitive or behavioural signs or symptoms. Patients should also be advised to 
inform their partner or caregivers about their treatment, since they may notice symptoms that the patient is 
not aware of. 
The evaluation for PML should be based on neurological examination, magnetic resonance imaging of the 
brain, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis for JC virus (JCV) DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or a 
brain biopsy with testing for JCV. A negative JCV PCR does not exclude PML. Additional follow-up and 
evaluation may be warranted if no alternative diagnosis can be established.  
If PML is suspected, further dosing must be suspended until PML has been excluded. If PML is confirmed, 
lenalidomide must be permanently discontinued. 
UNewly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients 
There was a higher rate of intolerance (Grade 3 or 4 adverse events, serious adverse events, discontinuation) 
in patients with age > 75 years, ISS stage III, ECOG PS≥2 or CLcr<60 mL/min when lenalidomide is given 
in combination. Patients should be carefully assessed for their ability to tolerate lenalidomide in 
combination, with consideration to age, ISS stage III, ECOG PS≥2 or CLcr<60 mL/min (see sections 4.2 and 
4.8). 
UCataract 
Cataract has been reported with a higher frequency in patients receiving lenalidomide in combination with 
dexamethasone particularly when used for a prolonged time. Regular monitoring of visual ability is 
recommended. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Erythropoietic agents, or other agents that may increase the risk of thrombosis, such as hormone replacement 
therapy, should be used with caution in multiple myeloma patients receiving lenalidomide with 
dexamethasone (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
UOral contraceptives 
No interaction study has been performed with oral contraceptives. Lenalidomide is not an enzyme inducer. In 
an in vitro study with human hepatocytes, lenalidomide, at various concentrations tested did not induce 
CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5. Therefore, induction leading to reduced efficacy of 
medicinal products, including hormonal contraceptives, is not expected if lenalidomide is administered 
alone. However, dexamethasone is known to be a weak to moderate inducer of CYP3A4 and is likely to also 
affect other enzymes as well as transporters. It may not be excluded that the efficacy of oral contraceptives 
may be reduced during treatment. Effective measures to avoid pregnancy must be taken (see sections 4.4 and 
4.6). 
UWarfarin 
Co-administration of multiple 10 mg doses of lenalidomide had no effect on the single dose 
pharmacokinetics of R- and S- warfarin. Co-administration of a single 25 mg dose of warfarin had no effect 
on the pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide. However, it is not known whether there is an interaction during 
clinical use (concomitant treatment with dexamethasone). Dexamethasone is a weak to moderate enzyme 
inducer and its effect on warfarin is unknown. Close monitoring of warfarin concentration is advised during 
the treatment. 
UDigoxin 
Concomitant administration with lenalidomide 10 mg once daily increased the plasma exposure of digoxin 
(0.5 mg, single dose) by 14% with a 90% CI (confidence interval) [0.52%-28.2%]. It is not known whether 
the effect will be different in the clinical use (higher lenalidomide doses and concomitant treatment with 
dexamethasone). Therefore, monitoring of the digoxin concentration is advised during lenalidomide 
treatment. 
UStatins 
There is an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis when statins are administered with lenalidomide, which may be 
simply additive. Enhanced clinical and laboratory monitoring is warranted notably during the first weeks of 
treatment. 
UDexamethasone 
Co-administration of single or multiple doses of dexamethasone (40 mg once daily) has no clinically relevant 
effect on the multiple dose pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide (25 mg once daily). 
UInteractions with P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors 
In vitro, lenalidomide is a substrate of P-gp, but is not a P-gp inhibitor. Co-administration of multiple doses 
of the strong P-gp inhibitor quinidine (600 mg, twice daily) or the moderate P-gp inhibitor/substrate 
temsirolimus (25 mg) has no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide (25 mg). 
Co-administration of lenalidomide does not alter the pharmacokinetics of temsirolimus. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Due to the teratogenic potential, lenalidomide must be prescribed under a Pregnancy Prevention Programme 
(see section 4.4) unless there is reliable evidence that the patient does not have childbearing potential. 
UWomen of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females 
Women of childbearing potential should use effective method of contraception. If pregnancy occurs in a 
woman treated with lenalidomide, treatment must be stopped and the patient should be referred to a 
physician specialised or experienced in teratology for evaluation and advice. If pregnancy occurs in a partner 
of a male patient taking lenalidomide, it is recommended to refer the female partner to a physician 
specialised or experienced in teratology for evaluation and advice. 
Lenalidomide is present in human semen at extremely low levels during treatment and is undetectable in 
human semen 3 days after stopping the substance in the healthy subject (see section 5.2). As a precaution and 
taking into account special populations with prolonged elimination time such as renal impairment, all male 
patients taking lenalidomide should use condoms throughout treatment duration, during dose interruption and 
for 1 week after cessation of treatment if their partner is pregnant or of childbearing potential and has no 
contraception. 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
UPregnancy 
Lenalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide. Thalidomide is a known human teratogenic active 
substance that causes severe life-threatening birth defects. 
Lenalidomide induced malformation in monkeys similar to those described with thalidomide (see 
section 5.3). Therefore, a teratogenic effect of lenalidomide is expected and lenalidomide is contraindicated 
during pregnancy (see section 4.3). 
UBreast-feeding 
It is not known whether lenalidomide is excreted in breast milk. Therefore, breast-feeding should be 
discontinued during therapy with lenalidomide. 
UFertility 
A fertility study in rats with lenalidomide doses up to 500 mg/kg (approximately 200 to 500 times the human 
doses of 25 mg and 10 mg, respectively, based on body surface area) produced no adverse effects on fertility 
and no parental toxicity. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Lenalidomide has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue, dizziness, 
somnolence, vertigo and blurred vision have been reported with the use of lenalidomide. Therefore, caution 
is recommended when driving or operating machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
USummary of the safety profile  
UNewly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who have undergone ASCT treated with lenalidomide 
maintenance 
A conservative approach was applied to determine the adverse reactions from CALGB 100104. The adverse 
reactions described in Table 1 included events reported post-HDM/ASCT as well as events from the 
maintenance treatment period. A second analysis that identified events that occurred after the start of 
maintenance treatment suggests that the frequencies described in Table 1 may be higher than actually 
observed during the maintenance treatment period. In IFM 2005-02, the adverse reactions were from the 
maintenance treatment period only. 
The serious adverse reactions observed more frequently (≥5%) with lenalidomide maintenance than placebo 
were: 
•  Pneumonia (10.6%; combined term) from IFM 2005-02 
•  Lung infection (9.4% [9.4% after the start of maintenance treatment]) from CALGB 100104 
In the IFM 2005-02 study, the adverse reactions observed more frequently with lenalidomide maintenance 
than placebo were neutropenia (60.8%), bronchitis (47.4%), diarrhoea (38.9%), nasopharyngitis (34.8%), 
muscle spasms (33.4%), leucopenia (31.7%), asthenia (29.7%), cough (27.3%), thrombocytopenia (23.5%), 
gastroenteritis (22.5%) and pyrexia (20.5%). 
In the CALGB 100104 study, the adverse reactions observed more frequently with lenalidomide 
maintenance than placebo were neutropenia (79.0% [71.9% after the start of maintenance treatment]), 
thrombocytopenia (72.3% [61.6%]), diarrhoea (54.5% [46.4%]), rash (31.7% [25.0%]), upper respiratory 
tract infection (26.8% [26.8%]), fatigue (22.8% [17.9%]), leucopenia (22.8% [18.8%]) and anaemia (21.0% 
[13.8%]). 
UNewly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients who are not eligible for transplant receiving lenalidomide in 
combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone 
In the SWOG S0777 study, the serious adverse reactions observed more frequently (≥ 5%) with lenalidomide 
in combination with intravenous bortezomib and dexamethasone than with lenalidomide in combination with 
dexamethasone were:  
•  Hypotension (6.5%), lung infection (5.7%), dehydration (5.0%) 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The adverse reactions observed more frequently with lenalidomide in combination with bortezomib and 
dexamethasone than with lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone were: Fatigue (73.7%), 
peripheral neuropathy (71.8%), thrombocytopenia (57.6%), constipation (56.1%), hypocalcaemia (50.0%).  
UNewly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who are not eligible for transplant treated with lenalidomide in 
combination with low dose dexamethasone 
The serious adverse reactions observed more frequently (≥5%) with lenalidomide in combination with low 
dose dexamethasone (Rd and Rd18) than with melphalan, prednisone and thalidomide (MPT) were: 
•  Pneumonia (9.8%) 
•  Renal failure (including acute) (6.3%) 
The adverse reactions observed more frequently with Rd or Rd18 than MPT were: diarrhoea (45.5%), fatigue 
(32.8%), back pain (32.0%), asthenia (28.2%), insomnia (27.6%), rash (24.3%), decreased appetite (23.1%), 
cough (22.7%), pyrexia (21.4%), and muscle spasms (20.5%). 
UNewly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who are not eligible for transplant treated with lenalidomide in 
combination with melphalan and prednisone 
The serious adverse reactions observed more frequently (≥5%) with melphalan, prednisone and lenalidomide 
followed by lenalidomide maintenance (MPR+R) or melphalan, prednisone and lenalidomide followed by 
placebo (MPR+p) than melphalan, prednisone and placebo followed by placebo (MPp+p) were: 
•  Febrile neutropenia (6.0%) 
•  Anaemia (5.3%) 
The adverse reactions observed more frequently with MPR+R or MPR+p than MPp+p were: neutropenia 
(83.3%), anaemia (70.7%), thrombocytopenia (70.0%), leucopenia (38.8%), constipation (34.0%), diarrhoea 
(33.3%), rash (28.9%), pyrexia (27.0%), peripheral oedema (25.0%), cough (24.0%), decreased appetite 
(23.7%), and asthenia (22.0%). 
UMultiple myeloma: patients with at least one prior therapy 
In two phase 3 placebo-controlled studies, 353 patients with multiple myeloma were exposed to the 
lenalidomide/dexamethasone combination and 351 to the placebo/dexamethasone combination.  
The most serious adverse reactions observed more frequently in lenalidomide/dexamethasone than 
placebo/dexamethasone combination were: 
• 
• 
Venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) (see section 4.4) 
Grade 4 neutropenia (see section 4.4). 
The observed adverse reactions which occurred more frequently with lenalidomide and dexamethasone than 
placebo and dexamethasone in pooled multiple myeloma clinical trials (MM-009 and MM-010) were fatigue 
(43.9%), neutropenia (42.2%), constipation (40.5%), diarrhoea (38.5%), muscle cramp (33.4%), anaemia 
(31.4%), thrombocytopenia (21.5%), and rash (21.2%). 
UMyelodysplastic syndromes 
The overall safety profile of lenalidomide in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes is based on data from 
a total of 286 patients from one phase 2 study and one phase 3 study (see section 5.1). In the phase 2, all 148 
patients were on lenalidomide treatment. In the phase 3 study, 69 patients were on lenalidomide 5 mg, 69 
patients on lenalidomide 10 mg and 67 patients were on placebo during the double-blind phase of the study.  
Most adverse reactions tended to occur during the first 16 weeks of therapy with lenalidomide. 
Serious adverse reactions include: 
• 
• 
Venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) (see section 4.4) 
Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia (see section 4.4). 
The most commonly observed adverse reactions which occurred more frequently in the lenalidomide groups 
compared to the control arm in the phase 3 study were neutropenia (76.8%), thrombocytopenia (46.4%), 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
diarrhoea (34.8%), constipation (19.6%), nausea (19.6%), pruritus (25.4%), rash (18.1%), fatigue (18.1%) 
and muscle spasms (16.7%). 
UMantle cell lymphoma 
The overall safety profile of lenalidomide in patients with mantle cell lymphoma is based on data from 254 
patients from a phase 2 randomised, controlled study MCL-002 (see section 5.1).  
Additionally, adverse drug reactions from supportive study MCL-001 have been included in table 3. 
The serious adverse reactions observed more frequently in study MCL-002 (with a difference of at least 2 
percentage points) in the lenalidomide arm compared with the control arm were: 
•  Neutropenia (3.6%) 
•  Pulmonary embolism (3.6%) 
•  Diarrhoea (3.6%) 
The most frequently observed adverse reactions which occurred more frequently in the lenalidomide arm 
compared with the control arm in study MCL-002 were neutropenia (50.9%), anaemia (28.7%), diarrhoea 
(22.8%), fatigue (21.0%), constipation (17.4%), pyrexia (16.8%), and rash (including dermatitis allergic) 
(16.2%).  
In study MCL-002 there was overall an apparent increase in early (within 20 weeks) deaths. Patients with 
high tumour burden at baseline are at increased risk of early death, 16/81 (20%) early deaths in the 
lenalidomide arm and 2/28 (7%) early deaths in the control arm. Within 52 weeks corresponding figures 
were 32/81 (39.5%) and 6/28 (21%) (see section 5.1).  
During treatment cycle 1, 11/81 (14%) patients with high tumour burden were withdrawn from therapy in the 
lenalidomide arm vs. 1/28 (4%) in the control group. The main reason for treatment withdrawal for patients 
with high tumour burden during treatment cycle 1 in the lenalidomide arm was adverse events, 7/11 (64%).  
High tumour burden was defined as at least one lesion ≥5 cm in diameter or 3 lesions ≥3 cm. 
UFollicular lymphoma  
The overall safety profile of lenalidomide in combination with rituximab in patients with previously treated 
follicular lymphoma is based on data from 294 patients from a Phase 3 randomised, controlled study NHL-
007. Additionally, adverse drug reactions from supportive study NHL-008 have been included in Table 5. 
The serious adverse reactions observed most frequently (with a difference of at least 1 percentage point) in 
study NHL-007 in the lenalidomide/rituximab arm compared with the placebo/rituximab arm were: 
•  Febrile neutropenia (2.7%) 
•  Pulmonary embolism (2.7%) 
•  Pneumonia (2.7%) 
In the NHL-007 study the adverse reactions observed more frequently in the lenalidomide/rituximab arm 
compared with the placebo/rituximab arm (with at least 2% higher frequency between arms) were 
neutropenia (58.2%), diarrhoea (30.8%), leucopenia (28.8%), constipation (21.9%), cough (21.9%)  and 
fatigue (21.9%). 
UTabulated list of adverse reactions 
The adverse reactions observed in patients treated with lenalidomide are listed below by system organ class 
and frequency. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing 
seriousness. Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon 
(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be 
estimated from the available data). 
Adverse reactions have been included under the appropriate category in the table below according to the 
highest frequency observed in any of the main clinical trials. 
UTabulated summary for monotherapy in MM

PAdverse events reported as serious in myelodysplastic syndromes clinical trials 
~Altered mood was reported as a common serious adverse event in the myelodysplastic syndromes phase 3 study; it was not reported as a Grade 3 or 
4 adverse event  
Algorithm applied for inclusion in the SmPC: All ADRs captured by the phase 3 study algorithm are included in the EU SmPC. For these ADRs, an 
additional check of the frequency of the ADRs captured by the phase 2 study algorithm was undertaken and, if the frequency of the ADRs in the 
phase 2 study was higher than in the phase 3 study, the event was included in the EU SmPC at the frequency it occurred in the phase 2 study. 
# Algorithm applied for myelodysplastic syndromes: 
•  Myelodysplastic syndromes phase 3 study (double-blind safety population, difference between lenalidomide 5/10mg and placebo by initial 
dosing regimen occurring in at least 2 subjects)  
o  All treatment-emergent adverse events with ≥ 5% of subjects in lenalidomide and at least 2% difference in proportion between 
lenalidomide and placebo 
o  All treatment-emergent Grade 3 or 4 adverse events in 1% of subjects in lenalidomide and at least 1% difference in proportion 
between lenalidomide and placebo 
o  All treatment-emergent serious adverse events in 1% of subjects in lenalidomide and at least 1% difference in proportion

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Teratogenicity 
Lenalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide. Thalidomide is a known human teratogenic active 
substance that causes severe life-threatening birth defects. In monkeys, lenalidomide induced malformations 
similar to those described with thalidomide (see sections 4.6 and 5.3). If lenalidomide is taken during 
pregnancy, a teratogenic effect of lenalidomide in humans is expected. 
Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia 
•  Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who have undergone ASCT treated with lenalidomide 
maintenance 
Lenalidomide maintenance after ASCT is associated with a higher frequency of Grade 4 neutropenia 
compared to placebo maintenance (32.1% vs 26.7% [16.1% vs 1.8% after the start of maintenance treatment] 
in CALGB 100104 and 16.4% vs 0.7% in IFM 2005-02, respectively). Treatment-emergent AEs of 
neutropenia leading to lenalidomide discontinuation were reported in 2.2% of patients in CALGB 100104 
and 2.4% of patients in IFM 2005-02, respectively. Grade 4 febrile neutropenia was reported at similar 
frequencies in the lenalidomide maintenance arms compared to placebo maintenance arms in both studies 
(0.4% vs 0.5% [0.4% vs 0.5% after the start of maintenance treatment] in CALGB 100104 and 0.3% vs 0% 
in IFM 2005-02, respectively). 
Lenalidomide maintenance after ASCT is associated with a higher frequency of Grade 3 or 4 
thrombocytopenia compared to placebo maintenance (37.5% vs 30.3% [17.9% vs 4.1% after the start of 
maintenance treatment] in CALGB 100104 and 13.0% vs 2.9% in IFM 2005-02, respectively). 
•  Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients who are not eligible for transplant receiving 
lenalidomide in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone 
Grade 4 neutropenia was observed in the RVd arm to a lesser extent than in the Rd comparator arm (2.7% vs 
5.9%) in the SWOG S0777 study. Grade 4 febrile neutropenia was reported at similar frequencies in the RVd 
arm compared to the Rd arm (0.0% vs 0.4%).  
Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was observed in the RVd arm to a greater extent than in the Rd comparator 
arm (17.2 % vs 9.4%). 
•  Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who are not eligible for transplant treated with 
lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone 
The combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients is 
associated with a lower frequency of Grade 4 neutropenia (8.5% in Rd and Rd18, compared with MPT 
(15%). Grade 4 febrile neutropenia was observed infrequently (0.6% in Rd and Rd18 compared with 0.7% in 
MPT). 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients is 
associated with a lower frequency of Grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia (8.1% in Rd and Rd18) compared 
with MPT (11.1%). 
•  Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who are not eligible for transplant treated with 
lenalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone 
The combination of lenalidomide with melphalan and prednisone in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma 
patients is associated with a higher frequency of Grade 4 neutropenia (34.1% in MPR+R/MPR+p) compared 
with MPp+p (7.8%). There was a higher frequency of Grade 4 febrile neutropenia observed (1.7% in 
MPR+R/MPR+p compared to 0.0% in MPp+p).  
The combination of lenalidomide with melphalan and prednisone in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma 
patients is associated with a higher frequency of Grade 3 and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (40.4% in 
MPR+R/MPR+p) compared with MPp+p (13.7%).  
•  Multiple myeloma: patients with at least one prior therapy 
The combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone in multiple myeloma patients is associated with a 
higher incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia (5.1% in lenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated patients compared 
with 0.6% in placebo/dexamethasone-treated patients). Grade 4 febrile neutropenia episodes were observed 
infrequently (0.6% in lenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated patients compared to 0.0% in 
placebo/dexamethasone treated patients). 
The combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone in multiple myeloma patients is associated with a 
higher incidence of Grade 3 and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (9.9% and 1.4%, respectively, in 
lenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated patients compared to 2.3% and 0.0% in placebo/dexamethasone-treated 
patients). 
•  Myelodysplastic syndromes patients 
In myelodysplastic syndromes patients, lenalidomide is associated with a higher incidence of Grade 3 or 4 
neutropenia (74.6% in lenalidomide-treated patients compared with 14.9% in patients on placebo in the 
phase 3 study). Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia episodes were observed in 2.2% of lenalidomide-treated 
patients compared with 0.0% in patients on placebo). Lenalidomide is associated with a higher incidence of 
Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia (37% in lenalidomide-treated patients compared with 1.5% in patients on 
placebo in the phase 3 study). 
•  Mantle cell lymphoma patients 
In mantle cell lymphoma patients, lenalidomide is associated with a higher incidence of Grade 3 or 4 
neutropenia (43.7% in lenalidomide-treated patients compared with 33.7% in patients in the control arm in 
the phase 2 study). Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia episodes were observed in 6.0% of lenalidomide-treated 
patients compared with 2.4% in patients on control arm.  
•  Follicular lymphoma patients 
The combination of lenalidomide with rituximab in follicular lymphoma is associated with a higher rate of 
grade 3 or grade 4 neutropenia (50.7% in lenalidomide/rituximab treated patients compared with 12.2% in 
placebo/rituximab treated patients). All grade 3 or 4 neutropenia were reversible through dose interruption, 
reduction and/or supportive care with growth factors. Additionally, febrile neutropenia was observed 
infrequently (2.7% in lenalidomide/rituximab treated patients compared with 0.7% in placebo/rituximab 
treated patients).   
Lenalidomide in combination with rituximab is also associated with a higher incidence of grade 3 or 
4 thrombocytopenia (1.4% in lenalidomide/rituximab treated patients compared to 0% in placebo/rituximab 
patients).  
Venous thromboembolism 
An increased risk of DVT and PE is associated with the use of the combination of lenalidomide with 
dexamethasone in patients with multiple myeloma, and to a lesser extent in patients treated with 
lenalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone or in patients with multiple myeloma, 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
myelodysplastic syndromes and mantle cell lymphoma treated with lenalidomide monotherapy (see 
section 4.5).  
Concomitant administration of erythropoietic agents or previous history of DVT may also increase 
thrombotic risk in these patients. 
Myocardial infarction 
8TMyocardial infarction has been reported in patients receiving lenalidomide, particularly in those with known 
risk8T 8Tfactors. 
Haemorrhagic disorders 
Haemorrhagic disorders are listed under several system organ classes: Blood and lymphatic system 
disorders; nervous system disorders (intracranial haemorrhage); respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal 
disorders (epistaxis); gastrointestinal disorders (gingival bleeding, haemorrhoidal haemorrhage, rectal 
haemorrhage); renal and urinary disorders (haematuria); injury, poisoning and procedural complications 
(contusion) and vascular disorders (ecchymosis). 
Allergic reactions and severe skin reactions 
Cases of allergic reactions including angioedema, anaphylactic reaction and severe cutaneous reactions 
including SJS, TEN and DRESS have been reported with the use of lenalidomide. A possible cross-reaction 
between lenalidomide and thalidomide has been reported in the literature. Patients with a history of severe 
rash associated with thalidomide treatment should not receive lenalidomide (see section 4.4). 
Second primary malignancies 
In clinical trials in previously treated myeloma patients with lenalidomide/dexamethasone compared to 
controls, mainly comprising of basal cell or squamous cell skin cancers. 
Acute myeloid leukaemia  
•  Multiple myeloma 
Cases of AML have been observed in clinical trials of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma in patients taking 
lenalidomide treatment in combination with melphalan or immediately following HDM/ASCT (see section 
4.4). This increase was not observed in clinical trials of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma in patients 
taking lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone compared to thalidomide in combination with 
melphalan and prednisone. 
•  Myelodysplastic syndromes 
Baseline variables including complex cytogenetics and TP53 mutation are associated with progression to 
AML in subjects who are transfusion dependent and have a Del (5q) abnormality (see section 4.4). The 
estimated 2-year cumulative risk of progression to AML were 13.8% in patients with an isolated Del (5q) 
abnormality compared to 17.3% for patients with Del (5q) and one additional cytogenetic abnormality and 
38.6% in patients with a complex karyotype. 
In a post-hoc analysis of a clinical trial of lenalidomide in myelodysplastic syndromes, the estimated 2-year 
rate of progression to AML was 27.5 % in patients with IHC-p53 positivity and 3.6% in patients with IHC-
p53 negativity (p=0.0038). In the patients with IHC-p53 positivity, a lower rate of progression to AML was 
observed amongst patients who achieved a transfusion independence (TI) response (11.1%) compared to a 
non-responder (34.8%).  
Hepatic disorders 
The following post-marketing adverse reactions have been reported (frequency unknown): acute hepatic 
failure and cholestasis (both potentially fatal), toxic hepatitis, cytolytic hepatitis, mixed cytolytic/cholestatic 
hepatitis. 
Rhabdomyolysis 
Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis have been observed, some of them when lenalidomide is administered with a 
statin. 
Thyroid disorders  
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cases of hypothyroidism and cases of hyperthyroidism have been reported (see section 4.4 Thyroid 
disorders). 
Tumour flare reaction and tumour lysis syndrome 
In study MCL-002, approximately 10% of lenalidomide-treated patients experienced TFR compared to 0% 
in the control arm. The majority of the events occurred in cycle 1, all were assessed as treatment-related, and 
the majority of the reports were grade 1 or 2. Patients with high MIPI at diagnosis or bulky disease (at least 
one lesion that is ≥ 7 cm in the longest diameter) at baseline may be at risk of TFR. In study MCL-002, TLS 
was reported for one patient in each of the two treatment arms. In the supportive study MCL-001, 
approximately 10% of subjects experienced TFR; all report were grade 1 or 2 in severity and all were 
assessed as treatment-related. The majority of the events occurred in cycle 1. There were no reports of TLS 
in study MCL-001 (see section 4.4). 
In study NHL-007, TFR was reported in 19/146 (13.0%) of patients in the lenalidomide/rituximab arm 
versus 1/148 (0.7%) patients in the placebo/rituximab arm. Most TFRs (18 out of 19) reported in the 
lenalidomide/rituximab arm occurred during first two cycles of treatment. One FL patient in the 
lenalidomide/rituximab arm experienced a Grade 3 TFR event versus no patients in the placebo/rituximab 
arm. In study NHL-008, 7/177 (4.0%) of FL patients experienced TFR; (3 reports were Grade 1 and 4 reports 
were Grade 2 severity); while 1 report was considered serious. In study NHL-007, TLS occurred in 2 FL 
patients (1.4%) in the lenalidomide/rituximab arm and no FL patients in the placebo/rituximab arm; neither 
patient had a Grade 3 or 4 event. TLS occurred in 1 FL patient (0.6%) in study NHL-008. This single event 
was identified as a serious, Grade 3 adverse reaction. For study NHL-007 no patients had to discontinue 
lenalidomide/rituximab therapy due to TFR or TLS. 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
Gastrointestinal perforations have been reported during treatment with lenalidomide. Gastrointestinal 
perforations may lead to septic complications and may be associated with fatal outcome. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked 
to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in 30TAppendix V30T. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is no specific experience in the management of lenalidomide overdose in patients, although in dose-
ranging studies some patients were exposed to up to 150 mg, and in single-dose studies, some patients were 
exposed to up to 400 mg. The dose limiting toxicity in these studies was essentially haematological. In the 
event of overdose, supportive care is advised. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other immunosuppressants. ATC code: L04AX04. 
Mechanism of action 
Lenalidomide binds directly to cereblon, a component of a cullin ring E3 ubiquitin ligase enzyme complex 
that includes deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage-binding protein 1(DDB1), cullin 4 (CUL4), and 
regulator of cullins 1 (Roc1). In haematopoietic cells, lenalidomide binding to cereblon recruits substrate 
proteins Aiolos and Ikaros, lymphoid transcriptional factors, leading to their ubiquitination and subsequent 
degradation resulting in direct cytotoxic and immunomodulatory effects. 
Specifically, lenalidomide inhibits proliferation and enhances apoptosis of certain haematopoietic tumour 
cells (including MM plasma tumour cells, follicular lymphoma tumour cells and those with deletions of 
chromosome 5), enhances T cell- and Natural Killer (NK) cell-mediated immunity and increases the number 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of NK, T and NK T cells. In MDS Del (5q), lenalidomide selectively inhibits the abnormal clone by 
increasing the apoptosis of Del (5q) cells. 
The combination of lenalidomide and rituximab increases ADCC and direct tumor apoptosis in follicular 
lymphoma cells. 
The lenalidomide mechanism of action also includes additional activities such as anti-angiogenic and pro-
erythropoietic properties. Lenalidomide inhibits angiogenesis by blocking the migration and adhesion of 
endothelial cells and the formation of microvessels, augments foetal haemoglobin production by CD34+ 
haematopoietic stem cells, and inhibits production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α and IL-6) by 
monocytes. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Lenalidomide efficacy and safety have been evaluated in six phase 3 studies in newly diagnosed multiple 
myeloma, two phase 3 studies in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma, one phase 3 study and one phase 2 
study in myelodysplastic syndromes and one phase 2 study in mantle cell lymphoma and one phase 3 and 
one phase 3b study in iNHL as described below. 
Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma 
•  Lenalidomide maintenance in patients who have undergone ASCT 
The efficacy and safety of lenalidomide maintenance was assessed in two phase 3 multicentre, randomised, 
double-blind 2-arm, parallel group, placebo-controlled studies: CALGB 100104 and IFM 2005-02 
CALGB 100104 
Patients between 18 and 70 years of age with active MM requiring treatment and without prior progression 
after initial treatment were eligible. 
Patients were randomised 1:1 within 90-100 days after ASCT to receive either lenalidomide or placebo 
maintenance. The maintenance dose was 10 mg once daily on days 1-28 of repeated 28-day cycles (increased 
up to 15 mg once daily after 3 months in the absence of dose-limiting toxicity), and treatment was continued 
until disease progression. 
The primary efficacy endpoint in the study was progression free survival (PFS) from randomisation to the 
date of progression or death, whichever occurred first; the study was not powered for the overall survival 
endpoint. In total 460 patients were randomised: 231 patients to Lenalidomide and 229 patients to placebo. 
The demographic and disease-related characteristics were balanced across both arms. 
The study was unblinded upon the recommendations of the data monitoring committee after surpassing the 
threshold for a preplanned interim analysis of PFS. After unblinding, patients in the placebo arm were 
allowed to cross over to receive lenalidomide before disease progression. 
The results of PFS at unblinding, following a preplanned interim analysis, using a cut-off of 17 December 
2009 (15.5 months follow up) showed a 62% reduction in risk of disease progression or death favouring 
lenalidomide (HR = 0.38; 95% CI 0.27, 0.54; p <0.001). The median overall PFS was 33.9 months (95% CI 
NE, NE) in the lenalidomide arm versus 19.0 months (95% CI 16.2, 25.6) in the placebo arm.  
The PFS benefit was observed both in the subgroup of patients with CR and in the subgroup of patients who 
had not achieved a CR. 
The results for the study, using a cut-off of 1 February 2016, are presented in Table 7.

Patients aged < 65 years at diagnosis who had undergone ASCT and had achieved at least a stable disease 
response at the time of hematologic recovery were eligible. Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either 
lenalidomide or placebo maintenance (10 mg once daily on days 1-28 of repeated 28-day cycles increased up 
to 15 mg once daily after 3 months in the absence of dose-limiting toxicity) following 2 courses of 
lenalidomide consolidation (25 mg/day, days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle). Treatment was to be continued until 
disease progression. 
The primary endpoint was PFS defined from randomisation to the date of progression or death, whichever 
occurred first; the study was not powered for the overall survival endpoint. In total 614 patients were 
randomised: 307 patients to lenalidomide and 307 patients to placebo. 
The study was unblinded upon the recommendations of the data monitoring committee after surpassing the 
threshold for a preplanned interim analysis of PFS. After unblinding, patients receiving placebo were not 
crossed over to lenalidomide therapy prior to progressive disease. The lenalidomide arm was discontinued, 
as a proactive safety measure, after observing an imbalance of SPMs (see Section 4.4). 
The results of PFS at unblinding, following a preplanned interim analysis, using a cut-off of 7 July 2010 
(31.4 months follow up) showed a 48% reduction in risk of disease progression or death favouring 
lenalidomide (HR = 0.52; 95% CI 0.41, 0.66; p <0.001). The median overall PFS was 40.1 months (95% CI 
35.7, 42.4) in the lenalidomide arm versus 22.8 months (95% CI 20.7, 27.4) in the placebo arm. 
The PFS benefit was less in the subgroup of patients with CR than in the subgroup of patients who had not 
achieved a CR. 
The updated PFS, using a cut-off of 1 February 2016 (96.7 months follow up) continues to show a PFS 
advantage: HR = 0.57 (95% CI 0.47, 0.68; p < 0.001). The median overall PFS was 44.4 months (39.6, 52.0) 
in the lenalidomide arm versus 23.8 months (95% CI 21.2, 27.3) in the placebo arm. For PFS2, the observed 
HR was 0.80 (95% CI 0.66, 0.98; p = 0.026) for lenalidomide versus placebo. The median overall PFS2 was 
69.9 months (95% CI 58.1, 80.0) in the lenalidomide arm versus 58.4 months (95% CI 51.1, 65.0) in the 
placebo arm. For OS, the observed HR was 0.90 (95% CI 0.72, 1.13; p = 0.355) for lenalidomide versus 
placebo. The median overall survival time was 105.9 months (95% CI 88.8, NE) in the lenalidomide arm 
versus 88.1 months (95% CI 80.7, 108.4) in the placebo arm.

•  Lenalidomide in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients who are not eligible 
for stem cell transplantation 
The SWOG S0777 study evaluated the addition of bortezomib to a foundation of lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone, as initial treatment, followed by continued Rd until disease progression, in patients with 
previously untreated multiple myeloma who are either ineligible for transplant or eligible for transplant with 
no plan to undertake immediate transplant.  
Patients in the lenalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (RVd) arm received lenalidomide 25 mg/day 
orally on days 1-14, intravenous bortezomib 1.3 mg/mP
mg/day orally on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 of repeated 21-day cycles for up to eight 21-day cycles (24 
weeks). Patients in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd) arm received lenalidomide 25 mg/day orally on 
days 1-21, and dexamethasone 40 mg/day orally on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of repeated 28-day cycles for up to 
six 28-day cycles (24 weeks). Patients in both arms took continued Rd: lenalidomide 25 mg/day orally on 
days 1-21 and dexamethasone 40 mg/day orally on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of repeated 28-day cycles. 
Treatment was to be continued until disease progression.

The primary efficacy endpoint in the study was progression free survival (PFS). In total 523 patients were 
enrolled into the study, with 263 patients randomised to RVd and 260 patients randomised to Rd. The 
demographics and disease-related baseline characteristics of the patients were well balanced between arms.  
The results of PFS, as assessed by IRAC, at the time of the primary analysis, using a cut-off of 05 November 
2015 (50.6 months follow up) showed a 24% reduction in risk of disease progression or death favouring RVd 
(HR = 0.76; 95% CI 0.61, 0.94; p = 0.010). The median overall PFS was 42.5 months (95% CI 34.0, 54.8) in 
the RVd arm versus 29.9 months (95% CI 25.6, 38.2) in the Rd arm. The benefit was observed regardless of 
eligibility for stem cell transplant. 
The results for the study, using a cut-off of 01 December 2016, where the median follow-up time for all 
surviving subjects was 69.0 months, are presented in Table 8. The benefit favouring RVd was observed 
regardless of eligibility for stem cell transplant.

•  Lenalidomide in combination  with dexamethasone  in patients who are not eligible for stem cell 
transplantation 
The safety and efficacy of lenalidomide was assessed in a phase 3, multicentre, randomised, open-label, 
3-arm study (MM-020) of patients who were at least 65 years of age or older or, if younger than 65 years of 
age, were not candidates for stem cell transplantation because they declined to undergo stem cell 
transplantation or stem cell transplantation is not available to the patient due to cost or other reason.The study 
(MM-020) compared lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd) given for 2 different durations of time (i.e., until 
progressive disease [Arm Rd] or for up to eighteen 28-day cycles [72 weeks, Arm Rd18]) to melphalan, 
prednisone and thalidomide (MPT) for a maximum of twelve 42-day cycles (72 weeks). Patients were 
randomised (1:1:1) to 1 of 3 treatment arms. Patients were stratified at randomisation by age (≤75 versus >75 
years), stage (ISS Stages I and II versus Stage III), and country. 
Patients in the Rd and Rd18 arms took lenalidomide 25 mg once daily on days 1 to 21 of 28-day cycles 
according to protocol arm. Dexamethasone 40 mg was dosed once daily on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each 
28-day cycle. Initial dose and regimen for Rd and Rd18 were adjusted according to age and renal function 
(see section 4.2). Patients >75 years received a dexamethasone dose of 20 mg once daily on days 1, 8, 15, 
and 22 of each 28-day cycle. All patients received prophylactic anticoagulation (low molecular weight 
heparin, warfarin, heparin, low-dose aspirin) during the study. 
The primary efficacy endpoint in the study was progression free survival (PFS). In total 1623 patients were 
enrolled into the study, with 535 patients randomised to Rd, 541 patients randomised to Rd18 and 547 
patients randomised to MPT. The demographics and disease-related baseline characteristics of the patients 
were well balanced in all 3 arms. In general, study subjects had advanced-stage disease: of the total study 
population, 41% had ISS stage III, 9% had severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance [CLcr] 
< 30 mL/min). The median age was 73 in the 3 arms. 
In an updated analysis of PFS, PFS2 and OS using a cut off of 3 March 2014 where the median follow-up 
time for all surviving subjects was 45.5 months, the results of the study are presented in Table 9.

•  Lenalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone followed by maintenance therapy in 
patients who are not eligible for transplant 
The safety and efficacy of lenalidomide was assessed in a phase 3 multicentre, randomised double blind 
3 arm study (MM-015) of patients who were 65 years or older and had a serum creatinine < 2.5 mg/dL. The 
study compared lenalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone (MPR) with or without 
lenalidomide maintenance therapy until disease progression, to that of melphalan and prednisone for a 
maximum of 9 cycles. Patients were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of 3 treatment arms. Patients were 
stratified at randomisation by age (≤ 75 vs. > 75 years) and stage (ISS; Stages I and II vs. stage III). 
This study investigated the use of combination therapy of MPR (melphalan 0.18 mg/kg orally on days 1 to 4 
of repeated 28-day cycles; prednisone 2 mg/kg orally on days 1 to 4 of repeated 28-day cycles; and 
lenalidomide 10 mg/day orally on days 1 to 21 of repeated 28-day cycles) for induction therapy, up to 
9 cycles. Patients who completed 9 cycles or who were unable to complete 9 cycles due to intolerance 
proceeded to maintenance therapy starting with lenalidomide 10 mg orally on days 1 to 21 of repeated 
28-day cycles until disease progression. 
The primary efficacy endpoint in the study was progression free survival (PFS). In total 459 patients were 
enrolled into the study, with 152 patients randomised to MPR+R, 153 patients randomised to MPR+p and 
154 patients randomised to MPp+p. The demographics and disease-related baseline characteristics of the 
patients were well balanced in all 3 arms; notably, approximately 50% of the patients enrolled in each arm 
had the following characteristics; ISS Stage III, and creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min. The median age was 
71 in the MPR+R and MPR+p arms and 72 in the MPp+p arm. 
In an analysis of PFS, PFS2, OS using a cut-off of April 2013 where the median follow up time for all 
surviving subjects was 62.4 months, the results of the study are presented in Table 10.

every 28 days for the first four cycles. Patients randomised to the lenalidomide/low dose dexamethasone arm 
received lenalidomide 25 mg/day, days 1 to 21 every 28 days plus low dose dexamethasone – 40 mg/day on 
days 1, 8, 15, and 22 every 28 days. In the lenalidomide/low dose dexamethasone group, 20 patients (9.1%) 
underwent at least one dose interruption compared to 65 patients (29.3%) in the lenalidomide/standard dose 
dexamethasone arm. 
In a post-hoc analysis, lower mortality was observed in the lenalidomide/low dose dexamethasone arm 6.8% 
(15/220) compared to the lenalidomide/standard dose dexamethasone arm 19.3% (43/223), in the newly 
diagnosed multiple myeloma patient population, with a median follow up of 72.3 weeks. 
However, with a longer follow-up, the difference in overall survival in favour of lenalidomide/ low dose 
dexamethasone tends to decrease. 
Multiple myeloma with at least one prior therapy 
The efficacy and safety of lenalidomide were evaluated in two phase 3 multicentre, randomised, double-
blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group controlled studies (MM-009 and MM-010) of lenalidomide plus 
dexamethasone therapy versus dexamethasone alone in previously treated patients with multiple myeloma. 
Out of 353 patients in the MM-009 and MM-010 studies who received lenalidomide/dexamethasone, 45.6% 
were aged 65 or over. Of the 704 patients evaluated in the MM-009 and MM-010 studies, 44.6% were aged 
65 or over. 
In both studies, patients in the lenalidomide/dexamethasone (len/dex) group took 25 mg of lenalidomide 
orally once daily on days 1 to 21 and a matching placebo capsule once daily on days 22 to 28 of each 
28-day cycle. Patients in the placebo/dexamethasone (placebo/dex) group took 1 placebo capsule on days 1 
to 28 of each 28-day cycle. Patients in both treatment groups took 40 mg of dexamethasone orally once daily 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
on days 1 to 4, 9 to 12, and 17 to 20 of each 28-day cycle for the first 4 cycles of therapy. The dose of 
dexamethasone was reduced to 40 mg orally once daily on days 1 to 4 of each 28-day cycle after the first 
4 cycles of therapy. In both studies, treatment was to continue until disease progression. In both studies, dose 
adjustments were allowed based on clinical and laboratory finding. 
The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was time to progression (TTP). In total, 353 patients were 
evaluated in the MM-009 study; 177 in the len/dex group and 176 in the placebo/dex group and, in total, 
351 patients were evaluated in the MM-010 study; 176 in the len/dex group and 175 in the placebo/dex 
group. 
In both studies, the baseline demographic and disease-related characteristics were comparable between the 
len/dex and placebo/dex groups. Both patient populations presented a median age of 63 years, with a 
comparable male to female ratio. The ECOG performance status was comparable between both groups, as 
was the number and type of prior therapies. 
Pre-planned interim analyses of both studies showed that len/dex was statistically significantly superior 
(p < 0.00001) to dexamethasone alone for the primary efficacy endpoint, TTP (median follow-up duration of 
98.0 weeks). Complete response and overall response rates in the len/dex arm were also significantly higher 
than the placebo/dex arm in both studies. Results of these analyses subsequently led to an unblinding in both 
studies, in order to allow patients in the placebo/dex group to receive treatment with the len/dex 
combination. 
An extended follow-up efficacy analysis was conducted with a median follow-up of 130.7 weeks. Table 11 
summarises the results of the follow-up efficacy analyses – pooled studies MM-009 and MM-010. 
In this pooled extended follow-up analysis, the median TTP was 60.1 weeks (95% CI: 44.3, 73.1) in patients 
treated with len/dex (N = 353) versus 20.1 weeks (95% CI: 17.7, 20.3) in patients treated with placebo/dex 
(N = 351). The median progression free survival was 48.1 weeks (95% CI: 36.4, 62.1) in patients treated 
with len/dex versus 20.0 weeks (95% CI: 16.1, 20.1) in patients treated with placebo/dex. The median 
duration of treatment was 44.0 weeks (min: 0.1, max: 254.9) for len/dex and 23.1 weeks (min: 0.3, max: 
238.1) for placebo/dex. Complete response (CR), partial response (PR) and overall response (CR+PR) rates 
in the len/dex arm remain significantly higher than in the placebo/dex arm in both studies. The median 
overall survival in the extended follow-up analysis of the pooled studies is 164.3 weeks (95% CI: 145.1, 
192.6) in patients treated with len/dex versus 136.4 weeks (95% CI: 113.1, 161.7) in patients treated with 
placebo/dex. Despite the fact that 170 out of the 351 patients randomised to placebo/dex received 
lenalidomide after disease progression or after the studies were unblinded, the pooled analysis of overall 
survival demonstrated a statistically significant survival advantage for len/dex relative to placebo/dex 
(HR = 0.833, 95% CI = [0.687, 1.009], p=0.045).

Myelodysplastic syndromes 
The efficacy and safety of lenalidomide11T were evaluated 11Tin patients with transfusion-dependent anaemia due 
to low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic 
abnormality, with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities, in two main studies: a phase 3, 
multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-arm study of two doses of oral lenalidomide 
(10 mg and 5 mg) versus placebo (MDS-004); and a phase 2, a multicentre, single-arm, open-label study of 
lenalidomide (10 mg) (MDS-003).  
The results presented below represent the intent-to-treat population studied in MDS-003 and MDS-004; with 
the results in the isolated Del (5q) sub-population also shown separately. 
In study MDS-004, in which 205 patients were equally randomised to receive lenalidomide 10 mg, 5 mg or 
placebo, the primary efficacy analysis consisted of a comparison of the transfusion-independence response 
rates of the 10 mg and 5 mg lenalidomide arms versus the placebo arm (double-blind phase 16 to 52 weeks 
and open-label up to a total of 156 weeks). Patients who did not have evidence of at least a minor erythroid 
response after 16 weeks were to be discontinued from treatment. Patients who had evidence of at least a 
minor erythroid response could continue therapy until erythroid relapse, disease progression or unacceptable 
toxicity. Patients, who initially received placebo or 5 mg lenalidomide and did not achieve at least a minor 
erythroid response after 16 weeks of treatment were permitted to switch from placebo to 5 mg lenalidomide 
or continue lenalidomide treatment at higher dose (5 mg to 10 mg). 
In, study MDS-003, in which 148 patients received lenalidomide at a dose of 10 mg, the primary efficacy 
analysis consisted of an evaluation of the efficacy of lenalidomide treatments to achieve haematopoietic 
improvement in subjects with low- or intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic syndromes.

In MDS-004, a significant larger proportion of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes achieved the 
primary endpoint of transfusion independence (>182 days) on lenalidomide 10 mg compared with placebo 
(55.1% vs. 6.0%). Amongst the 47 patients with an isolated Del (5q) cytogenetic abnormality and treated 
with lenalidomide 10 mg, 27 patients (57.4%) achieved red blood cell transfusion independence. 
The median time to transfusion independence in the lenalidomide 10 mg arm was 4.6 weeks. The median 
duration of transfusion independence was not reached in any of the treatment arms but should exceed 2 years 
for the lenalidomide-treated subjects. The median increase in haemoglobin (Hgb) from baseline in the 10 mg 
arm was 6.4 g/dL.  
Additional endpoints of the study included cytogenetic response (in the 10 mg arm major and minor 
cytogenetic responses were observed in 30.0% and 24.0% of subjects, respectively), assessment of Health 
49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and progression to acute myeloid leukaemia. Results of the cytogenetic 
response and HRQoL were consistent with the findings of the primary endpoint and in favour of 
lenalidomide treatment compared to placebo. 
In MDS-003, a large proportion of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes achieved transfusion 
independence (>182 days) on lenalidomide 10 mg (58.1%). The median time to transfusion independence 
was 4.1 weeks. The median duration of transfusion independence was 114.4 weeks. The median increase in 
haemoglobin (Hgb) was 5.6 g/dL. Major and minor cytogenetic responses were observed in 40.9% and 
30.7% of subjects, respectively.  
A large proportion of subjects enrolled in MDS-003 (72.9%) and MDS-004 (52.7%) had received prior 
erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. 
Mantle cell lymphoma 
The efficacy and safety of lenalidomide were evaluated in patients with mantle cell lymphoma in a phase 2, 
multicentre, randomised open-label study versus single agent of investigator’s choice in patients who were 
refractory to their last regimen or had relapsed one to three times (study MCL-002). 
Patients who were at least 18 years of age with histologically-proven MCL and CT-measurable disease were 
enrolled. Patients were required to have received adequate previous treatment with at least one prior 
combination chemotherapy regimen. Also, patients had to be ineligible for intensive chemotherapy and/or 
transplant at time of inclusion in the study. Patients were randomised 2:1 to the lenalidomide or the control 
arm. The investigator’s choice treatment was selected before randomisation and consisted of monotherapy 
with either chlorambucil, cytarabine, rituximab, fludarabine, or gemcitabine. 
Lenalidomide was administered orally 25 mg once daily for the first 21 days (D1 to D21) of repeating 
28-day cycles until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with moderate renal insufficiency were to 
receive a lower starting dose of lenalidomide 10 mg daily on the same schedule.  
The baseline demographic were comparable between the lenalidomide arm and control arm. Both patient 
populations presented a median age of 68.5 years with comparable male to female ratio. The ECOG 
performance status was comparable between both groups, as was the number of prior therapies. 
The primary efficacy endpoint in study MCL-002 was progression-free survival (PFS). 
The efficacy results for the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population were assessed by the Independent Review 
Committee (IRC), and are presented in Table 13 below.

Follicular lymphoma 
AUGMENT - CC-5013-NHL-007  
The efficacy and safety of lenalidomide in combination with rituximab versus rituximab plus placebo was 
evaluated in patients with relapsed/refractory iNHL including FL in a phase 3, multicentre, randomised, 
double- blind controlled study (CC-5013-NHL-007 [AUGMENT]). 
A total of 358 patients who were at least 18 years of age with histologically confirmed MZL or Grade 1, 2 or 
3a FL (CD20+ by flow cytometry or histochemistry) as assessed by the investigator or local pathologist were 
randomised in a 1:1 ratio. Subjects had been previously treated with at least one prior systemic 
chemotherapy, immunotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy. 
Lenalidomide was administered orally 20 mg once daily for the first 21 days of repeating 28-day cycles for 
2
P every week in Cycle 1 (days 
12 cycles or until unacceptable toxicity. The dose of rituximab was 375 mg/mP
1, 8, 15, and 22) and on day 1 of every 28-day cycle from cycles 2 through 5. All dosage calculations for 
rituximab were based on the patient’s body surface area (BSA), using actual patient weight. 
The demographic and disease-related baseline characteristics were similar across the 2 treatment groups. 
The primary objective of the study was to compare the efficacy of lenalidomide in combination with 
rituximab to rituximab plus placebo in subjects with relapsed/refractory FL Grade 1, 2 or 3a or MZL. 
Efficacy determination was based upon PFS as the primary endpoint, as assessed by the IRC using the 2007 
International Working Group (IWG) criteria but without positron emission tomography (PET).  
The secondary objectives of the study were to compare the safety of lenalidomide in combination with 
rituximab versus rituximab plus placebo. Further secondary objectives were to compare the efficacy of 
rituximab plus lenalidomide versus rituximab plus placebo using the following other parameters of efficacy: 
Overall response rate (ORR), CR rate, and duration of response (DoR) by IWG 2007 without PET and OS. 
Results from the overall population including FL and MZL showed that at a median follow up of 
28.3°months, the study met its primary endpoint of PFS with a hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval 
[CI]) of 0.45 (0.33,0.61) p-value < 0.0001. The efficacy results from the follicular lymphoma population are 
presented in Table 14.

Follicular lymphoma for patients refractory to Rituximab 
MAGNIFY - CC-5013-NHL-008   
A total of 232 subjects who were at least 18 years of age with histologically confirmed FL (Grade 1, 2, 3a or 
MZL), as assessed by the investigator or local pathologist, were enrolled into the initial treatment period with 
12 cycles of lenalidomide plus rituximab. Subjects who achieved CR/CRu, PR, or SD by the end of the 
induction treatment period were randomised to enter the maintenance treatment period. All enrolled subjects 
must have previously been treated with at least one prior systemic antilymphoma therapy. In contrast to 
study NHL-007, the NHL-008 study included patients who were refractory to rituximab (no response or 
relapsed within 6 months of rituximab treatment or who were double-refractory to rituximab and 
chemotherapy). 
During the induction treatment period, lenalidomide 20 mg was given on Days 1-21 of repeated 28-day 
cycles for up to 12 cycles or until unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent or disease progression. The 
P every week in Cycle 1 (Days 1, 8, 15, and 22) and on Day 1 of every other 
dose of rituximab was 375 mg/mP
28-day cycle (cycles 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11) up to 12 cycles therapy. All dosage calculations for rituximab were 
based on the patient body surface area (BSA) and actual weight. 
2
The data presented are based on an interim analysis focusing on the single-arm induction treatment period.. 
Efficacy determinations are based on ORR by best response as the primary endpoint, using a modification of 
the 1999 International Working Group Response Criteria (IWGRC). The secondary objective was to evaluate 
other parameters of efficacy, such as DoR.

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has granted a product-specific waiver for Revlimid that applies to 
all subsets of the paediatric population for mature B-cell neoplasm conditions. (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Lenalidomide has an asymmetric carbon atom and can therefore exist as the optically active forms S(-) and 
R(+). Lenalidomide is produced as a racemic mixture. Lenalidomide is generally more soluble in organic 
solvents but exhibits the greatest solubility in 0.1N HCl buffer. 
Absorption 
Lenalidomide is rapidly absorbed following oral administration in healthy volunteers, under fasting 
conditions, with maximum plasma concentrations occurring between 0.5 and 2 hours post-dose. In patients, 
as well as in healthy volunteers, the maximum concentration (CRmaxR) and area-under-the-concentration time 
curve (AUC) increase proportionally with increases in dose. Multiple dosing does not cause marked 
medicinal product accumulation. In plasma, the relative exposures of the S- and R- enantiomers of 
lenalidomide are approximately 56% and 44%, respectively. 
Co-administration with a high-fat and high-calorie meal in healthy volunteers reduces the extent of 
absorption, resulting in an approximately 20% decrease in area under the concentration versus time curve 
(AUC) and 50% decrease in CRmaxR in plasma. However, in the main multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic 
syndromes registration trials where the efficacy and safety were established for lenalidomide, the medicinal 
product was administered without regard to food intake. Thus, lenalidomide can be administered with or 
without food. 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that the oral absorption rate of lenalidomide is similar among 
MM, MDS and MCL patients.

Distribution 
In vitro (P
and 29% in multiple myeloma patients and healthy volunteers, respectively. 
14
PC)-lenalidomide binding to plasma proteins was low with mean plasma protein binding at 23% 
Lenalidomide is present in human semen (< 0.01% of the dose) after administration of 25 mg/day and the 
medicinal product is undetectable in semen of a healthy subject 3 days after stopping the substance (see section 
4.4). 
Biotransformation and elimination 
Results from human in vitro metabolism studies indicate that lenalidomide is not metabolised by cytochrome 
P450 enzymes suggesting that administration of lenalidomide with medicinal products that inhibit 
cytochrome P450 enzymes is not likely to result in metabolic medicinal product interactions in humans. In 
vitro studies indicate that lenalidomide has no inhibitory effect on CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, 
CYP2E1, CYP3A, or UGT1A1. Therefore, lenalidomide is unlikely to cause any clinically relevant 
medicinal product interactions when co-administered with substrates of these enzymes. 
In vitro studies indicate that lenalidomide is not a substrate of human breast cancer resistance protein 
(BCRP), multidrug resistance protein (MRP) transporters MRP1, MRP2, or MRP3, organic anion 
transporters (OAT) OAT1 and OAT3, organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1), organic 
cation transporters (OCT) OCT1 and OCT2, multidrug and toxin extrusion protein (MATE) MATE1, and 
organic cation transporters novel (OCTN) OCTN1 and OCTN2. 
In vitro studies indicate that lenalidomide has no inhibitory effect on human bile salt export pump (BSEP), 
BCRP, MRP2, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OCT2. 
A majority of lenalidomide is eliminated through urinary excretion. The contribution of renal excretion to 
total clearance in subjects with normal renal function was 90%, with 4% of lenalidomide eliminated in 
faeces. 
Lenalidomide is poorly metabolized as 82% of the dose is excreted unchanged in urine. Hydroxy-
lenalidomide and N-acetyl-lenalidomide represent 4.59% and 1.83% of the excreted dose, respectively. The 
renal clearance of lenalidomide exceeds the glomerular filtration rate and therefore is at least actively 
secreted to some extent. 
At doses of 5 to 25 mg/day, half-life in plasma is approximately 3 hours in healthy volunteers and ranges 
from 3 to 5 hours in patients with multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndromes or mantle cell lymphoma. 
Older people 
No dedicated clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide in the 
elderly. Population pharmacokinetic analyses included patients with ages ranging from 39 to 85 years old 
and indicate that age does not influence lenalidomide clearance (exposure in plasma). Because elderly 
patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection and it would 
be prudent to monitor renal function. 
Renal impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide was studied in subjects with renal impairment due to nonmalignant 
conditions. In this study, two methods were used to classify renal function: the urinary creatinine clearance 
measured over 24 hours and the creatinine clearance estimated by Cockcroft-Gault formula. The results 
indicate that as renal function decreases (< 50 mL/min), the total lenalidomide clearance decreases 
proportionally resulting in an increase in AUC. The AUC was increased by approximately 2.5, 4 and 5-fold 
in subjects with moderate renal impairment, severe renal impairment, and end-stage renal disease, 
respectively, compared to the group combining subjects with normal renal function and subjects with mild 
renal impairment. The half-life of lenalidomide increased from approximately 3.5 hours in subjects with 
creatinine clearance > 50 mL/min to more than 9 hours in subjects with reduced renal function < 50 mL/min. 
However, renal impairment did not alter the oral absorption of lenalidomide. The CRmaxR was similar between 
healthy subjects and patients with renal impairment. Approximately 30% of the medicinal product in the 
54 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
body was removed during a single 4-hour dialysis session. Recommended dose adjustments in patients with 
impaired renal function are described in section 4.2. 
Hepatic impairment  
Population pharmacokinetic analyses included patients with mild hepatic impairment (N=16, total bilirubin 
>1 to ≤1.5 x ULN or AST > ULN) and indicate that mild hepatic impairment does not influence 
lenalidomide clearance (exposure in plasma). There are no data available for patients with moderate to severe 
hepatic impairment.  
Other intrinsic factors  
Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that body weight (33- 135 kg), gender, race and type of 
haematological malignancy (MM, MDS or MCL) do not have a clinically relevant effect on lenalidomide 
clearance in adult patients.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
An embryofoetal development study has been conducted in monkeys administered lenalidomide at doses 
from 0.5 and up to 4 mg/kg/day. Findings from this study indicate that lenalidomide produced external 
malformations including non-patent anus and malformations of upper and lower extremities (bent, shortened, 
malformed, malrotated and/or absent part of the extremities, oligo and/or polydactyly) in the offspring of 
female monkeys who received the active substance during pregnancy.  
Various visceral effects (discoloration, red foci at different organs, small colourless mass above atrio-
ventricular valve, small gall bladder, malformed diaphragm) were also observed in single foetuses. 
Lenalidomide has a potential for acute toxicity; minimum lethal doses after oral administration were > 2000 
mg/kg/day in rodents. Repeated oral administration of 75, 150 and 300 mg/kg/day to rats for up to 26 weeks 
produced a reversible treatment-related increase in kidney pelvis mineralisation in all 3 doses, most notably 
in females. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was considered to be less than 75 mg/kg/day, and 
is approximately 25-fold greater than the human daily exposure based on AUC exposure. Repeated oral 
administration of 4 and 6 mg/kg/day to monkeys for up to 20 weeks produced mortality and significant 
toxicity (marked weight loss, reduced red and white blood cell and platelet counts, multiple organ 
haemorrhage, gastrointestinal tract inflammation, lymphoid, and bone marrow atrophy). Repeated oral 
administration of 1 and 2 mg/kg/day to monkeys for up to 1 year produced reversible changes in bone 
marrow cellularity, a slight decrease in myeloid/erythroid cell ratio and thymic atrophy. Mild suppression of 
white blood cell count was observed at 1 mg/kg/day corresponding to approximately the same human dose 
based on AUC comparisons. 
In vitro (bacterial mutation, human lymphocytes, mouse lymphoma, Syrian Hamster Embryo cell 
transformation) and in vivo (rat micronucleus) mutagenicity studies revealed no drug related effects at either 
the gene or chromosomal level. Carcinogenicity studies with lenalidomide have not been conducted. 
Developmental toxicity studies were previously conducted in rabbits. In these studies, rabbits were 
administered 3, 10 and 20 mg/kg/day orally. An absence of the intermediate lobe of the lung was observed at 
10 and 20 mg/kg/day with dose dependence and displaced kidneys were observed at 20 mg/kg/day. Although 
it was observed at maternotoxic levels they may be attributable to a direct effect. Soft tissue and skeletal 
variations in the foetuses were also observed at 10 and 20 mg/kg/day.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Revlimid is and what it is used for 
What Revlimid is 
Revlimid contains the active substance ‘lenalidomide’. This medicine belongs to a group of medicines which 
affect how your immune system works. 
What Revlimid is used for 
Revlimid is used in adults for: 
•  Multiple myeloma 
•  Myelodysplastic syndromes 
•  Mantle cell lymphoma 
• 
Follicular lymphoma 
Multiple myeloma 
Multiple myeloma is a type of cancer which affects a certain kind of white blood cell, called the plasma cell. 
These cells collect in the bone marrow and divide, becoming out of control. This can damage the bones and 
kidneys.  
Multiple myeloma generally cannot be cured. However, the signs and symptoms can be greatly reduced or 
disappear for a period of time. This is called a ‘response’. 
89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma – in patients who have had a bone marrow transplant 
Revlimid is used on its own as a maintenance therapy after patients have recovered enough following a bone 
marrow transplant. 
Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma – in patients who cannot have a bone marrow transplant 
Revlimid is taken with other medicines. These may include: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
You will take these other medicines at the start of treatment and then continue to take Revlimid on its own. 
a chemotherapy medicine called ‘bortezomib’ 
an anti-inflammatory medicine called ‘dexamethasone’ 
a chemotherapy medicine called ‘melphalan’ and 
an immunosuppressant medicine called ‘prednisone’.  
If you are aged 75 years or older or have moderate to severe kidney problems - your doctor will check you 
carefully before starting treatment. 
Multiple myeloma – in patients who have had treatment before 
Revlimid is taken together with an anti-inflammatory medicine called ‘dexamethasone’.  
Revlimid can stop the signs and symptoms of multiple myeloma getting worse. It has also been shown to 
delay multiple myeloma from coming back following treatment.  
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) 
MDS are a collection of many different blood and bone marrow diseases. The blood cells become abnormal 
and do not function properly. Patients can experience a variety of signs and symptoms including a low red 
blood cell count (anaemia), the need for a blood transfusion, and be at risk of infection. 
Revlimid is used alone to treat adult patients who have been diagnosed with MDS, when all of the following 
apply: 
•  you need regular blood transfusions to treat low levels of red blood cells (‘transfusion-dependent 
anaemia’) 
•  you have an abnormality of cells in the bone marrow called an ‘isolated deletion 5q cytogenetic 
abnormality’. This means your body does not make enough healthy blood cells 
•  other treatments have been used before, are not suitable or do not work well enough. 
Revlimid can increase the number of healthy red blood cells that the body produces by reducing the number 
of abnormal cells:  
• 
this can reduce the number of blood transfusions needed. It is possible that no transfusions will be 
needed. 
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) 
MCL is a cancer of part of the immune system (the lymph tissue). It affects a type of white blood cell called 
‘B-lymphocytes’ or B-cells. MCL is a disease where B-cells grow in an uncontrolled way and build up in the 
lymph tissue, bone marrow or blood. 
Revlimid is used alone to treat adult patients who have previously been treated with other medicines. 
Follicular lymphoma (FL) 
FL is a slow growing cancer that affects the B-lymphocytes. These are a type of white blood cells that help 
your body fight infection. When you have FL, too many of these B-lymphocytes may collect in your blood, 
bone marrow, lymph nodes and spleen. 
Revlimid is taken together with another medicine called ‘rituximab’ for the treatment of adult patients with 
previously treated follicular lymphoma. 
90 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
How Revlimid works 
Revlimid works by affecting the body’s immune system and directly attacking the cancer. It works in a 
number of different ways: 
•  by stopping the cancer cells developing 
•  by stopping blood vessels growing in the cancer 
•  by stimulating part of the immune system to attack the cancer cells. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Revlimid 
You must read the package leaflet of all medicinal products to be taken in combination with Revlimid 
before starting treament with Revlimid. 
Do not take Revlimid: 
• 
if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to become pregnant, as Revlimid is 
expected to be harmful to an unborn child (see section 2, ‘Pregnancy, breast-feeding and 
contraception – information for women and men’). 
if you are able to become pregnant, unless you follow all the necessary measures to prevent you from 
becoming pregnant (see section 2, ‘Pregnancy, breast-feeding and contraception – information for 
women and men’). If you are able to become pregnant, your doctor will record with each prescription 
that the necessary measures have been taken and provide you with this confirmation. 
if you are allergic to lenalidomide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine listed in section 6. If 
you think you may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice. 
• 
• 
If any of these apply to you, do not take Revlimid. Talk to your doctor if you are not sure. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Revlimid if: 
•  you have had blood clots in the past - you have an increased risk of developing blood clots in the veins 
and arteries during treatment 
•  you have any signs of an infection, such as a cough or fever  
•  you have or have ever had previous viral infection, particularly: hepatitis B infection, varicella zoster, 
HIV. If you are in doubt, talk to your doctor. Treatment with Revlimid may cause the virus to become 
active again, in patients who carry the virus. This results in a recurrence of the infection. Your doctor 
should check whether you have ever had hepatitis B infection 
•  you have kidney problems - your doctor may adjust your dose of Revlimid 
•  you have had a heart attack, have ever had a blood clot, or if you smoke, have high blood pressure or 
high cholesterol levels 
•  you have had an allergic reaction whilst taking thalidomide (another medicine used to treat multiple 
myeloma) such as rash, itching, swelling, dizziness or trouble breathing 
•  you have experienced in the past a combination of any of the following symptoms: widespread rash, red 
skin, high body temperature, flu-like symptoms, liver enzyme elevations, blood abnormalities 
(eosinophilia), enlarged lymph nodes – these are signs of a severe skin reaction called Drug Reaction 
with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms which is also known as DRESS or drug hypersensitivity 
syndrome. (see also section 4 “Possible side effects”). 
If any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before starting treatment. 
At any time during or after your treatment, tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you:  
• 
experience blurred, loss of or double vision, difficulty speaking, weakness in an arm or a leg, a change in 
the way you walk or problems with your balance, persistent numbness, decreased sensation or loss of 
sensation, memory loss or confusion. These may all be symptoms of a serious and potentially fatal brain 
condition known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). If you had these symptoms 
prior to treatment with Revlimid, tell your doctor about any change in these symptoms.  
91 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
experience shortness of breath, tiredness, dizziness, pain in the chest, a faster heartbeat, or swelling in 
the legs or ankles. These may be symptoms of a serious condition known as pulmonary hypertension 
(see section 4). 
Tests and checks 
Before and during the treatment with Revlimid you will have regular blood tests. This is because Revlimid 
may cause a fall in the blood cells that help fight infection (white blood cells) and help the blood to clot 
(platelets).  
Your doctor will ask you to have a blood test: 
•  before treatment  
• 
• 
every week for the first 8 weeks of treatment 
then at least every month after that. 
You may be evaluated for signs of cardiopulmonary problems before and during the treatment with 
lenalidomide. 
For patients with MDS taking Revlimid 
If you have MDS, you may be more likely to get a more advanced condition called acute myeloid leukaemia 
(AML). In addition, it is not known how Revlimid affects the chances of you getting AML. Your doctor may 
therefore do tests to check for signs which may better predict the likelihood of you getting AML during your 
treatment with Revlimid. 
For patients with MCL taking Revlimid 
Your doctor will ask you to have a blood test: 
•  before treatment 
• 
• 
• 
• 
every week for the first 8 weeks (2 cycles) of treatment 
then every 2 weeks in cycles 3 and 4 (see section 3 ‘Treatment cycle’ for more information) 
after this it will happen at the start of each cycle and 
at least every month. 
For patients with FL taking Revlimid 
Your doctor will ask you to have a blood test: 
•  before treatment  
• 
• 
•  After this it will happen at the start of each cycle and 
• 
at least every month. 
every week for the first 3 weeks (1 cycle) of treatment 
then every 2 weeks in cycles 2 to 4 (see Section 3 ‘Treatment cycle’ for more information) 
Your doctor may check if you have a high total amount of tumour throughout the body, including your bone 
marrow. This could lead to a condition where the tumours break down and cause unusual levels of chemicals 
in the blood which can lead to kidney failure (this condition is called ‘Tumour Lysis Syndrome’).  
Your doctor may check you for changes to your skin such as red spots or rashes. 
Your doctor may adjust your dose of Revlimid or stop your treatment based on the results of your blood tests 
and on your general condition. If you are newly diagnosed, your doctor may also assess your treatment based 
on your age and other conditions you already have. 
Blood donation 
You should not donate blood during treatment and for at least 7 days after the end of treatment. 
Children and adolescents 
Revlimid is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years. 
Elderly and people with kidney problems 
If you are aged 75 years or older or have moderate to severe kidney problems - your doctor will check you 
carefully before starting treatment.

Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, Revlimid can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  
Stop taking Revlimid and see a doctor straight away if you notice any of the following serious side 
effects – you may need urgent medical treatment: 
•  Hives, rashes, swelling of eyes, mouth or face, difficulty breathing, or itching, which may be symptoms 
of serious types of allergic reactions called angioedema and anaphylactic reaction. 
•  A serious allergic reaction that may begin as a rash in one area but spread with extensive loss of skin 
over the whole body (Stevens-Johnson syndrome and/or toxic epidermal necrolysis). 
•  Widespread rash, high body temperature, liver enzyme elevations, blood abnormalities (eosinophilia), 
enlarged lymph nodes and other body organs involvement (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and 
Systemic Symptoms which is also known as DRESS or drug hypersensitivity syndrome). See also 
section 2. 
Tell your doctor straight away if you notice any of the following serious side effects: 
• 
Fever, chills, sore throat, cough, mouth ulcers or any other symptoms of infection including within the 
bloodstream (sepsis)

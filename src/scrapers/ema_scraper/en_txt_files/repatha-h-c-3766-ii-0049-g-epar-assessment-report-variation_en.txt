2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Familial hyperlipidemia is a genetic disorder characterized by elevated serum lipid concentrations.  
Among the conditions that  comprise familial hyperlipidemia, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a 
more common form of inherited hypercholesterolemia characterized by elevated serum low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL C) and the development of premature cardiovascular disease (CVD). 
The study of FH  has provided a strong basis of support for the primary role of LDL C in the 
development of CVD (Rader et al., 2003).  The overwhelming majority of culprit mutations  manifesting 
in a diagnosis of FH  exist within  the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) (Abifadel et al., 2003; 
Rader et al., 2003;  Goldstein et al., 2001), although  contributions from the genes for apolipoprotein B 
(ApoB) and for proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) have been described. 
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
In the current group of variations, a modified indication is proposed by the Applicant to include one 
new pediatric indication in pediatric patients aged 10 years and over with heterozygous familial 
hypercholesterolaemia based on results of study 20120123  (HAUSER-RCT) and to  modify the existing 
indication for treatment of adults and paediatric patients  aged 10 years and over with  homozygous 
familial hypercholesterolaemia based on interim results from study 20120124  (HAUSER-OLE). 
The claimed indication that  is now under assessment reads as follows (in bold underlined the 
proposed extension of the indication): 
Hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia 
Repatha is indicated in  adults with  primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and 
non-familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, as an adjunct  to diet: 
• 
in combination with  a statin or statin  with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients unable to 
reach LDL-C  goals with  the maximum tolerated dose of a statin or, 
alone or in combination with  other lipid-lowering therapies in  patients who are statin-intolerant, 
or for whom a statin  is contraindicated. 
• 
Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia 
Repatha  is indicated in paediatric patients  aged 10 years  and over with heterozygous 
familial hypercholesterolaemia as an  adjunct to diet, alone  or in combination with other 
lipid-lowering therapy,  to reduce LDL-C. 
Homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia 
Repatha is indicated in  adults and adolescents paediatric patients aged 12 10 years and over with 
homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia in combination with  other lipid-lowering  therapies.

Page 8/131 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 
Repatha is indicated in  adults with  established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (myocardial 
infarction, stroke or peripheral arterial disease) to  reduce cardiovascular risk by lowering LDL-C  levels, 
as an adjunct  to correction of other risk factors: 
• 
in combination with  the maximum tolerated dose of a statin  with  or without  other lipid-lowering 
therapies or, 
alone or in combination with  other lipid-lowering therapies in  patients who are statin-intolerant, 
or for whom a statin  is contraindicated. 
• 
For study results with  respect to effects on LDL-C,  cardiovascular events and populations studied see 
section 5.1. 
In the first assessment round, the CHMP  concluded that  the wording of the indication  should be 
adjusted, i.e. to combine the  adult and the pediatric HeFH  populations under the heading 
“Hypercholestesrolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia”, which is in line with  other approved lipid-lowering 
therapies (e.g. Crestor and Lipitor).  In the response, the Applicant has adjusted the wording of the 
indication in  accordance with the comments.  
The approved indication reads as follows (in bold underlined the  proposed extension of the 
indication):   
Hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia 
Repatha is indicated in  adults with  primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and 
non-familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, and in paediatric patients aged  10 years and over with 
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia,  as an adjunct to diet: 
• 
in combination with  a statin or statin  with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients unable to 
reach LDL-C  goals with  the maximum tolerated dose of a statin or, 
alone or in combination with  other lipid-lowering therapies in  patients who are statin-intolerant, 
or for whom a statin  is contraindicated. 
• 
Homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia 
Repatha is indicated in  adults and adolescents paediatric patients aged 12 10 years and over with 
homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia in combination with  other lipid-lowering  therapies. 
Established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 
Repatha is indicated in  adults with  established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (myocardial 
infarction, stroke or peripheral arterial disease) to  reduce cardiovascular risk by lowering LDL-C  levels, 
as an adjunct  to correction of other risk factors: 
• 
in combination with  the maximum tolerated dose of a statin  with  or without  other lipid-lowering 
therapies or, 
alone or in combination with  other lipid-lowering therapies in  patients who are statin-intolerant, 
or for whom a statin  is contraindicated. 
• 
For study results with  respect to effects on LDL-C,  cardiovascular events and populations studied see 
section 5.1. 
Epidemiology and biologic features 
The true prevalence of FH  has recently been estimated as being higher than  what has been 
traditionally thought  (up to  1 in 200), but  in most countries, it is estimated that  fewer than  1% of 
individuals with  FH  are diagnosed (Nordestgaard et al., 2013; Marks et al., 2003). 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/572365/2021  
Page 9/131 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Heterozygous FH  (HeFH)  accounts for the large majority of FH  overall, and is estimated to occur in 
1:250  individuals globally (Hu  et al., 2020; Wiegman et al., 2015).  Untreated LDL-C levels in affected 
individuals are significantly elevated (270.7  ± 7.7 mg/dL  [7.0 ± 0.2  mmol/L]) compared with  controls 
(100.5  ± 3.9 mg/dL  [2.6 ± 0.1  mmol/L]) (Raal et al., 2013),  and in spite of aggressive statin use, 
there is still a 2-fold excess of coronary heart disease (CHD) related deaths relative to age-matched 
controls within  this population (Neil  et al., 2008). 
By comparison, the  prevalence of homozygous FH  (HoFH)  is approximately 1:1,000,000  individuals, 
and untreated LDL-C levels are 518.2  ± 27.1  mg/dL (13.4 ±  0.7 mmol/L) (Raal et al., 2013).  The 
incidence of major cardiovascular illness among homozygous individuals is even higher than that  of 
HeFH  individuals, with  events such as myocardial infarction occurring by the  second decade of life 
(Goldstein et al., 2001). 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Familial hypercholesterolemia is associated with  increased cardiovascular risk and manifests with 
premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Among children with FH,  even those 
who do not have clinically overt presentations have identifiable subclinical manifestations of premature 
atherosclerotic vascular disease (Kusters et al., 2014; Masoura et al., 2011;  Awan et al., 2008; 
Gidding et al., 1998).  It is increasingly recognized that  exposure to elevated LDL-C early in life is 
responsible and that  interventions that  lower LDL-C can favourably impact the natural history of FH 
(Wiegman et al., 2015).  As such, it  is imperative that pediatric subjects with  HeFH  and HoFH  receive 
early and highly effective intervention to lower LDL-C and improve clinical outcomes later in life. 
Management 
Statins are currently the standard of care for primary hyperlipidemia (heterozygous familial and 
nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia and have been shown to reduce LDL-C (30%  to 40% with 
standard doses [Grundy et  al., 2004])  and cardiovascular events. All statins share a final common 
pharmacodynamic pathway via competitive inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)  CoA 
reductase; therefore, these drugs lower intrahepatic cholesterol synthesis, leading to  upregulation of 
LDLR expression with a subsequent reduction in LDL C. Statins also lead to  upregulation of PCSK9 
expression, potentially explaining diminished LDL-C  reduction with  higher doses and favoring a 
synergistic role with  PCSK9 (Dubuc et al, 2004). 
Non-statin  treatment options,  including ezetimibe, bile acid sequestering agents (resins), and plant 
stanols, also lower LDL C, with  reductions on the order of 10% to 20%  (Rosenson and Underberg, 
2013;  Zetia® Package Insert, 2013; Laitinen  and Gylling, 2012). Often, these secondary treatment 
options are prescribed in combination with  statins  to better control LDL C (Agency for Healthcare 
Research and Quality, 2009). 
Some patients,  especially those with  high LDL-C,  are unable to  achieve recommended LDL C levels. 
Not  surprisingly, many patients with  FH  cannot achieve recommended goals despite using  maximum 
doses of statin  in combination with  ezetimibe, further emphasizing the need for additional treatment 
options (Pijlman et al, 2010). 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Evolocumab (REPATHA, formerly known as AMG 145) is a fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin  G2 
(IgG2) that binds  specifically to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), preventing its 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/572365/2021  
Page 10/131 
 
 
 
interaction with  the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR).  The inhibition  of PCSK9 by evolocumab 
leads to  increased LDLR expression and decreased circulating concentrations of low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (LDL-C). 
Evolocumab was approved in the EU on 17  July 2015.  In the initial  submission, evolocumab has 
demonstrated a substantial  and consistent reduction in LDL-C (a surrogate biomarker for 
cardiovascular risk reduction) and other lipid parameters alone and on top  of existing lipid-lowering 
therapy (LLT)  options including  statins and ezetimibe in several groups of patients with 
hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia and in patients with  homozygous familial 
hypercholesterolemia. Based on these observations, evolocumab was indicated in  adults with  primary 
hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and non-familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia and in adults 
and adolescents aged 12  years and over with  homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia. At the time 
of the initial  MA, a statement  was included in Section 4.1  of the  EU SmPC that  the effect of 
evolocumab on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not  yet been determined, as the outcome 
study: 20110118  was ongoing. In 2018,  the MAH submitted  the results of Study 20110118  (FOURIER 
study) to extend the indication with  the reduction in  risk of cardiovascular events in adults  with 
established cardiovascular disease (CVD), in fulfilment  of post-authorisation measure MEA 004 
(EMEA/H/C/3766/II/017/G). 
The current approved indication reads as follows: 
Hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia 
Repatha is indicated in  adults with  primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and 
non-familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, as an adjunct  to diet: 
• 
in combination with  a statin or statin  with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients unable to 
reach LDL-C  goals with  the maximum tolerated dose of a statin or, 
alone or in combination with  other lipid-lowering therapies in  patients who are statin-intolerant, 
or for whom a statin  is contraindicated. 
• 
Homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia 
Repatha is indicated in  adults and adolescents aged 12  years and over with  homozygous familial 
hypercholesterolaemia in combination with  other lipid-lowering therapies. 
Established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 
Repatha is indicated in  adults with  established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (myocardial 
infarction, stroke or peripheral arterial disease) to  reduce cardiovascular risk by lowering LDL-C  levels, 
as an adjunct  to correction of other risk factors: 
• 
in combination with  the maximum tolerated dose of a statin  with  or without  other lipid-lowering 
therapies or, 
alone or in combination with  other lipid-lowering therapies in  patients who are statin-intolerant, 
or for whom a statin  is contraindicated. 
• 
For study results with  respect to effects on LDL-C,  cardiovascular events and populations studied see 
section 5.1. 
Pediatric clinical development plan 
An indication for the treatment of elevated cholesterol in pediatric and adult patients  with HoFH  was 
approved as part of the original marketing application for Repatha based on Study 20110233  (TESLA) 
and interim data from Study 20110271  (TAUSSIG). 
In Europe, the  evolocumab Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP), initially agreed on 28 May 2013  prior to 
the original marketing authorisation  application (MAA), included 2 clinical measures, pediatric Studies

20120123  (HAUSESR) and 20120124  (HAUSER-OLE),  which are the focus of this submission. Similarly, 
pediatric Studies 20120123  and 20120124,  were included and approved in the United  States (US) 
initial  Pediatric Study Plan (iPSP) issued on 16 September 2014 and subsequently included as post-
marketing requirements (PMR) in the original Biologics License Application (BLA) approval letter issued 
by FDA on 27  August 2015. These studies focused on expanding the  evaluation of evolocumab in 
children to include pediatric patients with  HeFH,  another serious genetic lipid disorder placing these 
young patients at very high risk for CVD, as well as expanding the age range for the approved 
pediatric HoFH  indication to include pediatric patients 10  years and older. 
The rationale for including pediatric patients aged 10 years and older in these studies was based on US 
and European Union  (EU) guidelines which recommend pharmacologic treatment for pediatric patients 
≥ 10 years of age with  elevated LDL-C. Pediatric guidelines in the United States (Daniels and Greer, 
2008;  McCrindle et al, 2007; Kavey et al., 2006)  recommend considering pharmacologic treatment 
after initial treatment with  lifestyle modification has failed in patients  ≥ 10 years of age with  LDL-C 
that  is: 
•  ≥ 130  mg/dL (3.4 mmol/L)  for the highest  risk (e.g., diabetes mellitus) 
•  ≥ 160  mg/dL (4.1 mmol/L)  for intermediate risk (eg, ≥ 2 other CHD risk factors, family history 
of premature coronary artery disease [CAD]) 
•  ≥ 190  mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L)  for the lowest risk (no cardiovascular risk factors) 
Similarly, treatment  guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and European 
Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) (Reiner et al., 2011) and from the National Institute  for Health and 
Clinical Excellence (National Collaborating Centre, 2008) recommend statin  treatment in patients  who

2.2.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of unbound  serum evolocumab relevant to the populations supporting  this 
submission are summarized in Section 2.2.2.1.  and 2.2.2.2.  (Initial Marketing Application) and Section 
2.2.2.1.  and 2.2.2.4.  (this variation, Study 20120123,  Study 20120124,  and Study 20110271).    
2.2.2.1.  Summary of pharmacokinetics in primary hyperlipidaemia  or mixed  dyslipidaemia 
vs. HeFH  -  Initial marketing  application 
In the phase 3  studies provided during the initial  MAA, unbound  serum evolocumab at week 12 was 
comparable between patients with  HeFH  (Study 20110117)  and patients with  primary hyperlipidaemia 
and mixed dyslipidaemia when evolocumab 140 mg SC Q2W (Table 2) or evolocumab 420 mg SC QM 
was administered with  a statin (Study 20110115)  (Table 3). No apparent differences in LDL-C and 
PCSK9 reductions were seen between the 140 mg Q2W and 420 mg Q1M,  but the  duration of action 
was longer in the  higher dose group, supporting less frequent dosing with  the higher dose. In clinical 
studies with  repeated subcutaneous dosing over 12 weeks, dose-proportional increases in exposure 
were observed with  dose regimens of 140 mg and greater 
In comparing the pharmacokinetics of evolocumab in phase 3 studies with  and without  background 
statin  therapy, unbound evolocumab trough serum concentrations at week 12 with  140 mg SC Q2W 
dosing (Table 2) and 420  mg SC QM dosing (Table 3) were overlapping between evolocumab 
monotherapy (Study 20110114)  and evolocumab treatment with  a statin (Study 20110115),  with  55% 
and 41% lower concentrations, respectively, in patients who were treated with  concomitant statins 
(Table 2).  However, mean values of unbound serum evolocumab with monotherapy were within  the 
range of values for subjects treated with  concomitant statins. 
Statins have been shown to increase unbound PCSK9 serum concentrations in patients with  primary 
hyperlipidaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia.  Higher unbound PCSK9 serum concentrations would be 
expected to bind more evolocumab, thereby reducing the serum concentration of unbound 
evolocumab.  Thus, the observed reduction of unbound  evolocumab serum concentrations among 
subjects who received evolocumab treatment with  a statin compared with  evolocumab monotherapy is 
consistent with  the known effects of statins  on unbound PCSK9. 
Collectively, these results indicated that HeFH  and statin  background therapy do not  have a clinically 
meaningful effect on the  pharmacokinetic profile of evolocumab at either of the proposed paediatric 
dosing regimens for HeFH  (i.e., 140 mg Q2W or 420 mg QM).   While background statin therapy did 
reduce unbound evolocumab serum concentrations compared with  evolocumab monotherapy, values 
were overlapping and mean values of unbound serum evolocumab with  monotherapy were within  the 
range of values for subjects treated with  concomitant statins.

2.2.2.2.  Summary of pharmacokinetics of primary hyperlipidaemia  or mixed dyslipidaemia 
vs. HoFH - Initial Marketing  Application 
Mean unbound evolocumab trough serum concentrations at  week 12 of evolocumab 420 mg SC QM 
treatment were comparable between patients  with HoFH  not  on apheresis and patients  with  primary 
hyperlipidaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia (Table 4).   
Furthermore, among 9 paediatric patients aged 13 to < 18  years with HoFH  in Study 20110271  who 
were not  on apheresis and had received evolocumab 420 mg SC QM as of the 01 April 2014 interim 
data cut-off date, unbound evolocumab trough serum concentrations at week 12 ranged from 8.6 to 
46.9  µg/mL.  These values were within  the range of unbound  evolocumab concentrations in Study 
20110115  in adults  with primary hyperlipidaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia on background statin 
therapy.  Collectively, these results indicate that  relative to primary hyperlipidaemia and mixed 
dyslipidaemia, HoFH  in adult  or paediatric patients does not have a clinically meaningful effect on the 
pharmacokinetic profile of evolocumab. 
More recent data available from the final analysis of Study 20110271  are consistent with  these 
findings.  In the final analysis of non-apheresis subjects with  HoFH,  mean (SD) unbound evolocumab 
serum concentrations at open-label extension weeks 4, 8,  and 12  (ie, trough concentrations) were 8.6 
(6.7),  12.7 (10.8),  and 13.1 (10.8)  μg/mL,  respectively.  Mean (SD) unbound evolocumab serum 
concentrations in these same subjects at weeks 2, 6, and 10 (ie, peak concentrations) were 37.1 
(14.9),  34.9 (19.4),  and 54.3 (18.4)  μg/mL,  respectively.

2.2.2.3.  Summary of pharmacokinetics in paediatric HeFH  -  Study 20120123 and Study 
20120124 
In Study 20120123,  following SC administration of 420 mg evolocumab QM, mean (SD) serum 
concentrations of evolocumab in paediatric subjects with HeFH  were 22.4 (14.7)  µg/mL,  64.9 (34.4) 
µg/mL  and 25.8 (19.2)  µg/mL  over the week 12, week 22, and week 24 time points,  respectively, 
where week 12 and week 24 represent the  end of the dosing interval (trough) and week 22  represents 
the middle of the dosing interval (peak) (Table 5).

administration of 420 mg QM  evolocumab to paediatric subjects 10 to 17 years  of age  with 
HeFH.  Week  12 and  week  24:trough, week  22 peak  (Study 20120123) 
For paediatric HeFH  subjects from Study 20120123  who chose to roll over into  Study 20120124,  serum 
evolocumab concentrations remain consistent with  those observed in the parent study.  
Pharmacokinetic results showed that  trough mean (SD) serum evolocumab concentration values in 
these subjects were 28.9 (21.1)  µg/mL  and 24.0 (21.6)  µg/mL  at week 12 and week 80,  respectively, 
of this open-label extension study (Table 6).

administration of 420 mg QM  evolocumab to paediatric subjects 10 to 17 years  of age  with 
HeFH  or HoFH (Study  20120124) 
Mean serum evolocumab values after 420 mg SC QM dosing in paediatric HeFH  subjects in double-
blind, placebo-controlled Study 20120123  and open-label extension Study 20120124  were within  the 
range of those observed in adult subjects with  primary hyperlipidaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia in 
Study 20110115  and adult HeFH  subjects in Study 20110117  (in Section 2.2.2.1.  ) These results 
indicate that,  relative to primary hyperlipidaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia and HeFH  in adults,  HeFH  in 
paediatric patients  does not  have a clinically meaningful effect on the  pharmacokinetic profile of 
evolocumab. 
2.2.2.4.  Summary of pharmacokinetics in paediatric HoFH  - Study 20120124 and Study 
20110271 
For de novo paediatric HoFH  subjects in  open-label Study 20120124,  pharmacokinetic analyses showed 
mean (SD) trough serum evolocumab concentrations after 420 mg QM dosing were 20.3 (14.6)  µg/mL 
and 17.6 (28.6)  µg/mL  at week 12 and week 80, respectively (Table 6). These values were similar to 
those observed for all non-apheresis subjects in Study 20110271  who initiated  treatment with 
evolocumab at 420 mg QM;  mean (SD) unbound evolocumab serum concentrations at open-label 
extension weeks 4, 8, and 12 (ie, trough concentrations) were 8.6  (6.7),  12.7 (10.8),  and 13.1 (10.8) 
μg/mL,  respectively (Section 2.2.2.2.  ).  Mean (SD) trough  serum evolocumab concentrations at week 
12, after 420 mg QM  dosing in  the 10 paediatric non-apheresis subjects in Study 20110271,  were 20.9 
(15.3)  μg/mL with  values ranging from 2.1  to 47.9  μg/mL.    
Therefore, mean serum evolocumab concentrations for paediatric subjects in both Study 20120124 
and Study 20110271  were within  the range observed for all subjects with  HoFH  in  Study 20110271  as 
well as within  the range of values observed for subjects with  primary hyperlipidaemia and mixed 
dyslipidaemia in Study 20110115  and HeFH  subjects in Study 20110117  (Section 2.2.2.1.  ).   
These results indicate that  HoFH  in paediatric subjects does not have a clinically meaningful effect on 
the pharmacokinetic profile of evolocumab. 
2.2.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical program to evaluate the clinical pharmacology of evolocumab was described in the original 
evolocumab application and included data on unbound  serum evolocumab concentrations from subjects 
with  primary hyperlipidaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia (with  evolocumab as both monotherapy or in 
combination with  statins),  adult subjects with HeFH,  and paediatric and adult subjects with HoFH. 
Analyses presented in the initial  evolocumab marketing application showed that  patients with  HeFH 
had unbound serum evolocumab concentrations following treatment comparable to patients  with 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/572365/2021  
Page 18/131 
 
 
 
 
primary hyperlipidaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia taking background statins  and patients  with  primary 
hyperlipidaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia treated with  evolocumab monotherapy. Analyses also 
showed that, relative to primary hyperlipidaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia, HoFH  did not have a 
clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles for unbound 
evolocumab and unbound PCSK9. Furthermore, mean trough  serum evolocumab concentrations at 
week 12 in  paediatric patients with  HoFH  who  were not on apheresis were within  the  range of those for 
adults with  primary hyperlipidaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia. Collectively, at time of the initial  MAA, it 
was concluded that  these results indicate that relative to primary hyperlipidaemia and mixed 
dyslipidaemia, HeFH  and HoFH  in adult  or paediatric patients do not have a clinically meaningful effect 
on the pharmacokinetic profile of evolocumab. 
Study 20120123  and Study 20120124,  provided in support of the new indication  in paediatric HeFH 
patients, used the approved 420 mg QM  dosing regimen administered in previous studies  of 
evolocumab in adult subjects with  primary hyperlipidaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia, adults with  HeFH, 
and in non-apheresis paediatric and adult  subjects with  HoFH.   Mean serum evolocumab values in 
paediatric HeFH  and HoFH  subjects in Study 20120123  and Study 20120124  were within  the range of 
values observed in adult subjects with  primary hyperlipidaemia or mixed dyslipidaemia, including 
HeFH,  and within  the range of values observed in non-apheresis paediatric subjects with  HoFH 
presented in the  initial marketing application. 
2.2.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The PK results provided in this  application demonstrate that  the PK of evolocumab following a dose of 
420 mg QM  in paediatric HeFH  and HoFH  patients  aged 10-17  years is similar to the PK in adult HeFH 
patients and HoFH  patient  aged 12  years and older. Considering the dose-linear PK as demonstrated in 
the initial  MAA, it is expected that  this will  also hold for the 140 mg Q2W and the 420  mg SC Q2W 
dose regimens. Therefore, the PK data provided are in support of the currently proposed dosing 
regimens for paediatric patients  with HeFH  aged 10-17 years, being the same as that  currently 
approved for adult  patients with  HeFH  as well as the proposed dosing regimens for paediatric patients 
with  HoFH  aged 10-17  years, being the same as that currently approved for adult  patients and 
paediatric patients  aged 12-17  years with HoFH.   
2.3.  Clinical efficacy 
2.3.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No dose response studies were submitted. 
Data  relevant  to approved dosing from initial evolocumab marketing application 
Analyses presented in the initial  evolocumab MAA showed that: 
- The 140 mg Q2W and 420 mg QM  dosing regimens were clinically equivalent as determined by a 
comparison between the dosing regimens for safety, tolerability, and efficacy. 
- Patients with  HeFH  and patients with  primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia had comparable 
pharmacokinetic profiles. Thus, the  doses of 140 mg Q2W and 420 mg QM are also approved in 
patients with  HeFH. 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/572365/2021  
Page 19/131 
 
 
 
- Relative to primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia, HoFH  did not  have a clinically meaningful 
effect on the  pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles for unbound evolocumab and unbound 
PCSK9.  
- Mean trough serum evolocumab concentrations at week 12 in adolescent patients  with HoFH  who 
were not  on apheresis were within  the range of those for adults with  primary hyperlipidemia and mixed 
dyslipidemia. 
-Both the 420  mg QM and 420 mg Q2W dosing regimens of evolocumab were appropriate for use in 
patients with  HoFH.  Given the very high baseline PCSK9 levels, severely elevated cholesterol 
concentrations (despite maximal statin background therapy in a large proportion of subjects), and 
genetic mutations restricting  or ablating the  function of the LDLR in patients with  HoFH,  the highest 
dose tested in  phase 1 and 2 clinical studies of evolocumab (420 mg SC QM)  was chosen as the dose 
for the population of non-apheresis HoFH  subjects entering Study 20110233  and the  starting dose for 
this patient  population in Study 20110271.  However, in recognizing that patients  with HoFH  may 
require additional PCSK9 suppression, 420 mg SC Q2W dosing was also evaluated in Study 20110271.    
Data  relevant  to proposed dosing recommendation in pediatric HeFH  and HoFH 
Pharmacokinetic data from the 2 studies with  evolocumab that  included adults as well  as pediatric 
subjects age 12 years and older (Studies 20110233  and 20110271)  showed that  exposure among 
pediatric subjects is comparable to that  seen in adults  of similar weight.   Further  pharmacokinetic 
modelling to predict the optimal dosing regimen for pediatric subjects 10  to 17 years of age showed 
that  the exposure with monthly administration  of 420  mg evolocumab SC in these subjects is expected 
to fall within  the range observed for other studies in the evolocumab development program. 
Pharmacokinetic data from Study 20120123  and Study 20120124  confirm that mean evolocumab 
exposure among pediatric subjects with HeFH  and HoFH  was within  the range of values observed in 
adult patients  with  primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia, including HeFH  and within  the 
range of values observed in non-apheresis pediatric subjects with  HoFH  in Study 20110271  presented 
in the initial  marketing application.   Subjects in Study 20120123  randomized to  the evolocumab group 
and all subjects in  Study 20120124  received 420 mg QM  dosing with evolocumab which is an approved 
dose per the product labeling. This dose was administered in previous studies of evolocumab in 
primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia, including  adult subjects with  HeFH,  and in non-
apheresis pediatric and adult  subjects with  HoFH.  Pharmacokinetic results in adults and adolescent 
subjects with HoFH  from the final analysis of Study 20110271  are consistent  with those provided for 
this study in  the initial marketing application. 
Collectively, these results indicate that relative to primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia, 
HeFH,  HoFH,  and age do not  have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetic profile of 
evolocumab. 
As a result, there are no proposed changes to  the currently approved evolocumab dosing regimens for 
each indication  in the product labeling:  
- 
- 
The proposed dosing regimens for pediatric patients with  HeFH  are the  same as those currently 
approved for adult  patients with  HeFH,  ie, 140 mg SC Q2W or 420  mg SC QM.   
The proposed dosing regimens for pediatric patients with  HoFH  remain the same as those 
currently approved for pediatric and adult  patients with  HoFH,  420  mg SC QM and 420 mg SC 
Q2W (where approved).

The 140 mg subcutaneously (SC) Q2W and 420  mg SC QM regimens are currently approved for adult 
patients with  HeFH;  both  doses are clinically equivalent. The 420  mg SC QM and 420  mg SC Q2W 
regimens are currently approved for adults patients  and adolescents aged 12 years and over with 
HoFH.  Based on PK data in the initial  MAA, the  approved 420 QM regimen has been selected for the 
studies 20120123  and 20120124,  which  evaluated the efficacy and safety of evolocumab in patients 
from 10  to < 18 years of age with  HeFH  or HoFH. 
Pharmacokinetic data from Study 20120123  and Study 20120124  confirmed that  mean serum 
evolocumab values of the 420 mg QM regimen in pediatric HeFH  and HoFH  subjects aged 10-17 years 
were within  the  range of values observed in adults  with  HeFH  and non-apheresis pediatric subjects 
with  HoFH  presented in the  initial marketing application. Additionally, efficacy and safety results of the 
420 mg QM  regimen observed in these studies were consistent with  those found in previous clinical 
studies in the evolocumab clinical program (see efficacy and safety section). Therefore, no changes to 
the approved evolocumab dosing regimens were proposed for the populations of pediatric HeFH 
subjects aged 10-≤17  years and the HoFH  subjects aged 10-≤11  years. However, in Study 20120123 
and 20120124,  only the 420 mg QM  regimen has been evaluated, whereas in  addition to this  regimen 
also the  140 mg Q2W regimen in  pediatric HeFH  subjects aged 10-17  years and the 420 mg Q2W 
regimen in pediatric HoFH  subjects 10-11  years are currently proposed (same as those currently stated 
in the labelling for the approved HoFH  and HeFH  populations). As such, the efficacy and safety of the 
140 mg Q2W dose regimen for pediatric HeFH  patients  aged 10-≤17 years and the 420  mg Q2W dose 
regimen for pediatric HoFH  patients aged 10-≤11 years have not  been evaluated.  
PK data have adequately shown that  the PK is dose-linear and that  relative to primary hyperlipidaemia 
and mixed dyslipidemia, HeFH,  HoFH  and age do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the 
pharmacokinetic profile of evolocumab. As such, the  140 mg Q2W regimen, which is considered 
clinically equivalent to the  420 mg SC QM regimen proposed for pediatric HeFH  patients  aged 10-≤17 
years, is considered acceptable.  However, the 420  mg Q2W regimen proposed for HoFH  subjects 10-
≤11 years of age concerns a 2-fold higher dose than  the 420 mg QM  for which  the efficacy and safety 
in the proposed population  of pediatric HoFH  patients  aged 10-11  years is currently unknown. Despite 
similar PK across different types of FH  and age categories, the  safety profile of the 420  mg Q2W in the 
pediatric patients with  HoFH  aged 10-≤11  years can differ compared to the  adult population and the 
older pediatric HoFH  population of  12-≤17 years for which this  dose regimen is currently already 
approved. The efficacy and safety of the 420  mg Q2W dose (together with  the 420  mg QM) have only 
been evaluated in the adult subjects with  HoFH  or severe FH and in the older pediatric HoFH  population 
of  12-≤17  years in Study 20110271.  In this  study, dose frequency changes (420 mg QM vs 420 mg 
Q2W) were permitted if a clinically meaningful response is not achieved. The titration  analysis set 
(TAS), defined as the subset of subjects who were exposed to evolocumab 420 mg QM for at least 12 
weeks and then to evolocumab 420  mg Q2W for at least 12 weeks, showed that  increasing the 
frequency of the evolocumab 420 mg dose from QM to Q2W resulted in an additional mean LDL-C 
reduction of 10.0% corresponding to a mean absolute reduction of 28.3  mg/dL. Considering that  in 
Study 20120124,  the median LDL-C reduction was comparable between the HoFH  subjects 10  - ≤11 
years of age and the overall pediatric HoFH  population, it can be anticipated that  increasing the 
frequency of the evolocumab 420 mg dose from QM to Q2W in HoFH  subjects 10  - ≤11 years of age 
results in a comparable additional mean LDL-C reduction of 10%. Previously, secondary prevention 
LDL-C lowering trials have shown that  reduction of 38.7 mg/dL (1  mmol/L) in LDL-C is associated with 
a 22% reduction in the 5-year incidence of major coronary events, revascularizations, and ischemic 
strokes (Cholesterol Treatment Trialists’ Collaboration [CTTC], 2010).  Based on above this additional 
mean absolute reduction of 28.3 mg/dL  upon increasing the frequency of the 420  mg dose to Q2W can 
be considered clinically relevant, particularly in pediatric HoFH  subjects which are at high 
cardiovascular risk.

However, the  safety profile of the 420  mg Q2W dose in pediatric HoFH  subjects 10-≤11 years of age is 
still  unknown. The Applicant argued that in  Study 20120124  and Study 20110271  no unexpected 
safety concerns has been found. Additionally, none of the adverse events were related to growth, 
pubertal development, or hormonal status.  However, firm conclusion on growth  and pubertal 
development and hormonal status  can still not be made due to limited  sample size and treatment 
duration. Moreover, in Study 20120124,  only the 420  mg QM regimen has been evaluated, while in 
Study 20110271  both QM  and Q2W regimens has been evaluated but  only in HoFH  subjects 12-≤17 
years of age. In this context, an justification  in order to extrapolate these safety results to HoFH 
subjects aged 10-≤11 years of age receiving the Q2W  regimen has not been provided by the Applicant. 
Nevertheless, it  is acknowledged that  the benefits of the additional clinically relevant reduction in LDL-
C upon increasing the frequency of the 420  mg dose to Q2W in HoFH  subjects aged 10-≤11 years who 
are at very high cardiovascular risk outweigh the  adverse events observed in this  HoFH  population to 
date. 
2.3.2.  Main studies 
In support of the extension of the indication  the MAH submitted  the results of 2 studies, i.e. the 
completed Study 20120123  and its  ongoing open-label extension Study 20120124: 
Study 20120123 (also referred to as HAUSER-RCT): a  double-blind, randomised, 
multicentre, placebo-controlled, parallel group study to characterise the efficacy, safety, 
and tolerability of 24 weeks  of evolocumab for LDL-C  reduction, as add-on to diet and lipid-
lowering therapy,  in patients from 10 to < 18 years  of age  with HeFH. 
Study 20120124 (also referred to as HAUSER-OLE):  an  open-label, single-arm, multicentre 
study to evaluate  the safety,  tolerability and activity  of evolocumab for LDL-C  reduction, as 
add-on to diet and lipid-lowering therapy,  in patients from 10 to < 18 years  of age  with HeFH 
or HoFH. 
Study 20120123 (HAUSER-RCT)(completed):  
Methods 
Study participants 
Eligible subjects were male or female, 10  to 17 years of age at time of randomization, who met the 
local applicable diagnostic criteria for HeFH.   Subjects also had to be on a low-fat  diet and optimized 
background lipid-lowering therapy for ≥ 4  weeks prior to screening as determined by the subject's 
physician and not  requiring up-titration  in the opinion of the investigator. Fasting LDL-C  had to  be ≥ 
130 mg/dL  (3.4 mmol/L), and fasting  triglycerides had to  be ≤ 400  mg/dL (4.5  mmol/L) as determined 
by the central laboratory at screening. 
Key inclusion/exclusion criteria are presented in Table 7.

investigator, not requiring  up-titration.  
- Subject  must be on a low-fat diet, and if taking any other lipid-lowering therapy (eg, ezetimibe, bile-acid 
sequestering  resin, omega 3 fatty acids or niacin), this therapy must be unchanged  for ≥ 4 weeks prior to LDL-
C screening;  fibrates must be stable for at least 6 weeks prior to screening.  
- Fasting LDL-C at screening ≥ 130 mg/dL (3.4 mmol/L) as determined by central laboratory.  
- Fasting triglycerides ≤ 400  mg/dL (4.5 mmol/L) by central laboratory at screening. 
Exclusion Criteria 
- Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia

- Type 1 diabetes or newly diagnosed  (within 3 months of randomization) type 2 diabetes, or poorly controlled 
type 2 diabetes (HbA1c > 8.5%) or newly diagnosed impaired glucose tolerance (within 3 months of 
randomization). 
- Untreated  or inadequately treated hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism  as defined by thyroid stimulating 
hormone (TSH) < lower limit of normal (LLN) or > 1.5 times the upper  limit of normal (ULN), respectively, and 
free thyroxine (T4) levels that are outside normal range  at screening.

ml/min/1.73m2 at screening,  confirmed by a repeat measurement at least 1 week apart. 
- Persistent active liver disease or hepatic dysfunction, defined as aspartate aminotransferase  (AST) or alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) > 2 times the ULN as determined by central laboratory analysis at screening, 
confirmed by a repeat measurement at least 1 week apart. 
- Creatine kinase (CK) > 3 times the ULN at screening, confirmed by a repeat measurement at least 1 week 
apart. 
- Known active infection or major hematologic, renal, metabolic, gastrointestinal or endocrine  dysfunction in 
the judgment of the investigator. 
- Unreliability as a study participant based on the investigator's (or designee’s) knowledge of the subject  (eg, 
alcohol or other drug abuse in the past year, inability or unwillingness to adhere to the protocol, or psychosis). 
- Subject  has taken a cholesterylester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor such  as anacetrapib, dalcetrapib  or

- Currently receiving treatment in another  investigational device or drug study, or less than  30 days since ending 
treatment on another  investigational device or drug study(s). Other investigational procedures  or treatments 
while participating  in this study are excluded. 
General inclusion criteria seem appropriate to reflect the  patients for which an indication is being 
sought, i.e. pediatric patients with  HeFH.  HeFH  was diagnosed based on genetic testing or in 
accordance with the  clinical Broome criteria, the Dutch Lipid  Clinic Network and MEDPED, which  is 
acceptable. The use of optimized background lipid-lowering  therapy for ≥ 4 weeks prior to  screening 
was another eligibility  criteria. Furthermore, the LDL-C level of ≥   3.4  mmol/L at screening is in line 
with  the treatment goal for paediatric patients with  HeFH recommended in the ESC guidelines for the 
treatment of dyslipidaemias (2019)  and therefore acceptable.   
Exclusion criteria can also generally be accepted. Key is that  HoFH  patients were not to be included. 
Treatments 
The study included two periods:  
-  Screening period: Subjects considered for enrollment underwent screening assessments, 
including laboratory screening by central laboratory and a subcutaneous (SC) administration of 
placebo to evaluate tolerability of the SC injection via a prefilled autoinjector/pen (AI/pen) 
prior to  randomization. The duration of this pre-treatment phase was maximal 8 weeks. 
-  Double-blind treatment period: Eligible subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive 24 
weeks of SC once monthly (QM) evolocumab 420  mg or placebo.  
Subjects visited the  study site for assessments at weeks 4, 12,  20, 22,  and 24  (end-of-study 
[EOS]). Investigational product administration at week 8 and week 16  could be at the  study 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/572365/2021  
Page 23/131 
 
 
 
 
site (optional visit) or at a non-clinic location (e.g., at home). The subject (or caregiver, if not 
a qualified healthcare professional) had to demonstrate competency at  the administration of SC 
injections before self-administration was permitted, and the first self-administered dose by the 
subject (or designee) had to be administered at the site under the supervision of a healthcare 
provider. The last administration of investigational product occurred at week 20. The EOS visit 
occurred at week 24. 
After completion of study 20120123,  subjects were offered to  participate in  an extension study 
where they will  receive open-label evolocumab. 
The study design is presented in Figure 1 below. 
Figure 1. Study design and treatment  schema for Study 20120123 
Investigational products 
Evolocumab and placebo were manufactured and packaged by Amgen Inc. and distributed  using 
Amgen clinical investigational product distribution  procedures. Evolocumab 420 mg was presented as a 
sterile, preservative-free solution in a single use, disposable, handheld mechanical prefilled AI/Pen for 
fixed dose, SC injection. Each AI/pen contained a 1.0  mL deliverable volume of 140  mg/mL 
evolocumab or 1.0  mL deliverable volume of placebo. Each QM administration of investigational 
product consisted of 3  injections of 140  mg evolocumab or placebo in 1.0  mL (administration by 3 
AI/Pens) for a total  of 3.0 mL (placebo or 420 mg evolocumab) administered. 
The multicentre international double-blinded placebo-controlled design of the study is appropriate to 
achieve the primary objective of the study. The duration of the screening period of a maximum of 8 
weeks should be sufficient to establish a stable run-in  cholesterol level. The 24-week double-blind 
treatment period is considered appropriate to provide reasonable results on the LDL-C  (and other 
cholesterol parameters) lowering effect of evolocumab. After completing study 20120123,  subjects 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report

were offered to participate in  an extension study where they will  receive open-label evolocumab (Study 
20120124,  discussed hereafter). 
A 2:1 randomization was used in this  study, which is considered appropriate.  
The approved formulation and dose of evolocumab (420  mg SC QM) for adult patients  with HeFH  and 
for adults and adolescents aged 12 years and over with  HoFH  has been used in the study (see also 
“dose response studies” section). Each QM  administration of investigational product  (IP) consisted of 3 
injections of 140 mg evolocumab (420 mg) or placebo in 1.0  mL (administration by 3 AI/Pens).

Other Safety Endpoints 
The primary endpoint of percent change from baseline to week 24 in LDL-C  is considered appropriate 
to establish the LDL-C lowering effect of evolocumab. Secondary endpoints are considered acceptable 
to provide further insight  on and confirmation of the primary objective.  
Sample size 
This study was designed to evaluate evolocumab in approximately 150 paediatric subjects. Based on 
the treatment effect from the global phase 3 study in adult  subjects with  HeFH,  evolocumab reduced 
LDL-C by approximately 55% compared with placebo (Raal et al, 2015).  A planned total  sample size of 
150 paediatric subjects (100 randomized to evolocumab 420  mg QM  and 50 randomized to placebo 
QM) provided approximately 99%  power in testing  the superiority of evolocumab 420 mg QM over 
placebo to reduce LDL-C using a two-sided t-test  with a 0.05  significance level and assuming a 
treatment effect of 40% reduction in LDL-C, a common standard deviation (SD) of 20%, and 20%  of 
subjects discontinuing investigational product prior to completion of the study. 
The sample size was calculated with  sufficient power to  detect a relevant difference, using realistic 
assumptions, including a 20% withdrawal  and is in agreement with  the PIP (EMEA-001268-PIP01-12) 
and is acceptable. 
Randomisation 
Randomization to evolocumab or placebo (2:1  ratio) was stratified by screening LDL-C (< 160 mg/dL 
[4.1 mmol/L]  vs ≥ 160  mg/dL) and age (<  14 years vs ≥ 14  years). 
The randomisation procedure is considered acceptable. Stratification factors are limited to  screening 
LDL-C level and age, which is also acceptable.  
Blinding (masking) 
Evolocumab and placebo in the  study were identical in appearance. Each was administered via an 
identical AI/pen. 
Since some laboratory results may inadvertently unblind  investigators to  treatment assignment to 
evolocumab, central laboratory results of the lipid panel, ApoA1, ApoB, Lp(a), fasting vitamins A, D, E, 
and K, PCSK9, and evolocumab were not available to the  investigator (or study personnel) post-
screening. Investigators were instructed not  to perform non-protocol (ie, local laboratory) testing  of 
these analytes during a subject’s study participation from first administration  of investigational product 
until  at least 12 weeks after last investigational product administration, or the subject’s end of study, 
whichever is later. A subject’s treatment  assignment was only to be unblinded when knowledge of the 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/572365/2021  
Page 26/131 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
treatment was essential for the further management of the  subject. Unblinding at  the study site for 
any other reason was considered a protocol deviation. The investigator was strongly encouraged to 
contact the Amgen Clinical Study Manager before unblinding  any subject’s treatment assignment. 
General blinding principals seem appropriate. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis sets 
The final analysis was conducted when  all subjects had either completed all scheduled study visits or 
had early terminated from the study.  Unless otherwise specified, efficacy and safety analyses were 
performed on the FAS and data were summarized by randomized treatment group.  
Subject disposition, demographics, baseline characteristics, and exposure to investigational product 
were summarized by treatment group and overall using descriptive statistics. 
Statistics 
Summary statistics for continuous variables included the number of subjects, mean, median, standard 
deviation or standard error, minimum, and maximum. For categorical variables, the frequency and 
percentage were summarized. 
Methods of handling missing data for efficacy endpoints are described below. Missing data were not 
imputed for safety endpoints. 
Efficacy Analyses 
The superiority of evolocumab to placebo was assessed for all efficacy endpoints. For all analyses 
related to  LDL-C, unless specified otherwise, a reflexive approach was used, where the calculated LDL-
C based on the Friedewald equation was employed unless the  calculated LDL-C was < 40  mg/dL (1.0 
mmol/L) or triglycerides were > 400  mg/dL (4.5  mmol/L), in which case preparative ultracentrifugation 
(UC) LDL-C was determined and utilized. 
Primary Efficacy Analyses 
The estimand of primary interest was the difference in mean percent change from baseline in reflexive 
LDL-C at week 24  regardless of treatment adherence for subjects in the  FAS. A repeated measures 
linear effects model (Littell  et al, 2000) was used to compare the efficacy of evolocumab with  placebo. 
The repeated measures model included terms for treatment group, stratification  factors (as 
appropriate), scheduled visit and the interaction of treatment with  scheduled visit.  To account for the 
repeated LDL-C measurements within  a subject across the visits, the repeated measures linear effects 
model used an unstructured covariance. Missing values were not imputed when the  repeated measures 
linear effects model was used. The analysis used LDL-C  values measured, regardless of treatment 
adherence. 
Sensitivity Analyses of the Primary Endpoint 
To evaluate the robustness of the  analysis results, sensitivity analyses were performed as follows: 
• 
The primary analysis was repeated using the CAS.  
•  Non-parametric analyses (Quade test) were carried out.  
• 
To evaluate the impact of missing data,  
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/572365/2021  
Page 27/131 
 
 
 
 
•  A sensitivity analysis under the  assumption that subjects that  discontinued investigational 
product and had missing endpoint data had a mean zero percent change from baseline was 
conducted using multiple imputation.   
• 
If there were at least 25 subjects who discontinued investigational product but had non-
missing week 24 endpoint  data, the primary analysis model was repeated using  FAS with 
missing values imputed for subjects who discontinued investigational product. Missing values 
were imputed  using non-missing data from subjects who discontinued investigational products 
within  the same treatment  group. 
Subgroup analyses of the primary and secondary LDL-C  efficacy endpoint 
Treatment effect differences among subgroups, which  represent subgroup by treatment interactions, 
were estimated and tested based on statistics  from the  subgroup repeated measures models.  
For subgroup analyses, the stratification factors from the eCRF were used. Differences in stratum 
assignment between data collection via IVRS and eCRF were tabulated.  
Secondary, Tertiary, and Exploratory Efficacy Endpoint Analyses  
The statistical model and testing of the secondary and tertiary efficacy endpoints were similar to the 
primary analysis of the primary endpoint. 
Exploratory endpoints related to  lipid parameters and PCSK9 were summarized by randomized 
treatment group and by scheduled visit using descriptive statistics.   
Death, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable  angina, coronary revascularization, stroke, 
TIA, and hospitalization  for heart failure were adjudicated by an independent CEC. Non-coronary 
revascularizations were collected on the eCRF and were not  adjudicated. Subject incidence of 
adjudicated endpoints and non-coronary revascularizations were summarized. 
Multiplicity  Adjustment  Method 
In order to preserve the familywise error rate at 0.05,  multiplicity  adjustment for the multiple 
endpoints (primary efficacy endpoint: percent change from baseline to week 24 in LDL-C and 
secondary efficacy endpoints: mean percent change from baseline to weeks 22 and 24  in LDL-C, 
change from baseline to week 24 in LDL-C and percent change from baseline to week 24  in non-HDL-
C, ApoB, total  cholesterol/HDL-C ratio and ApoB/ApoA1 ratio) was performed using sequential 
gatekeeping and Hochberg procedures (Hochberg, 1988)  as follows: 
1. If the treatment effect from the  primary analysis of the  primary endpoint was significant at a 
significance level of 0.05,  statistical  testing of the mean percent change from baseline to  weeks 22 and 
24 in LDL-C  and change from baseline to week 24 in  LDL-C proceeded using the  sequential procedure 
with  a significance level of 0.05 (i.e.,  change from baseline to week 24  in LDL-C was tested only if 
mean percent change from baseline to  weeks 22 and 24 in LDL-C was statistically significant  at 0.05 
significance level). 
2. If the treatment effect from change from baseline to week 24 in  LDL-C was significant  at a 
significance level of 0.05,  statistical  testing of the percent change from baseline to week 24  in non-
HDL-C, ApoB, total cholesterol/HDL-C ratio and ApoB/ApoA1 ratio followed the Hochberg procedure at 
a significance level of 0.05. 
Unless specified otherwise, all other hypothesis testing  was 2-sided with  a significance level of 0.05.

Page 28/131 
 
 
 
The definition of the analysis population is considered standard and acceptable. The primary and 
secondary analyses will be performed with  a linear effects model, and missing values are not  imputed. 
This is in line with  the PIP (EMEA-001268-PIP01-12)  and thus acceptable. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 202 subjects were screened for the study; 158 subjects (105  evolocumab, 53 placebo) were 
enrolled and randomized.  
One subject in  the evolocumab group did not  receive any investigational product. Overall, 153 (96.8%) 
subjects completed investigational product in the  study. Four subjects (all in the evolocumab group) 
discontinued investigational product; 2 at  the subject’s request, 1 subject due to an adverse event, 
and 1 subject due to “other” (subject missed the week 20 visit; the final dose of investigational 
product was administered at week 16). Overall, 157 (99.4%)  subjects completed the study with  1 
subject in the evolocumab group discontinuing the  study by withdrawing  consent (Table 9). 
One hundred fifty-seven subjects received at least 1 dose of investigational product and were included 
in the FAS. The completer analysis set (CAS) included 136 (86.1%)  subjects who completed IP and 
who have observed values for the primary endpoints. Of the 22 subjects excluded from the  CAS, 5 
missed doses of investigational product and 18 were missing the primary endpoint.

Table 9. Subject  disposition with discontinuation reason- Study  20120123 (all  randomized 
subjects) 
In Study 20120123,  158 subjects (105  evolocumab, 53 placebo) were enrolled and randomized. The 
disposition data generally appear acceptable. A high proportion of subjects completed the study 
(99.0%  for the evolocumab group and 100.0%  for the placebo group). Similarly, a high  proportion of 
subjects completed IP ( 95.2% vs 100%, respectively); In the evolocumab group 4 subject 
discontinued IP due to  subject request (n=2),  adverse event (n=1) or “other” (n=1).   
Protocol deviations 
Important protocol deviations (IPD's) are summarized in Table 10.  
Overall, 11 (7.0%)  subjects (8 [7.6%] subjects evolocumab; 3 [5.7%]  subjects placebo) had at least 1 
IPD. Five (3.2%)  subjects had IPD's reported as 'other’; these consisted of 3 evolocumab subjects who 
did not have a pregnancy test  during screening, 1 evolocumab subject who did not have a CK 
measurement at screening (the  results of CK at day 1  was normal), and 1 placebo subject who 
stopped statin background therapy for approximately 30 days during the study due to adverse events 
of jaundice and abdominal pain which subsequently resolved.

EMA/CHMP/572365/2021  
Page 30/131 
 
 
 
 
 
A total of 5 subjects had eligibility  deviations (n=1  in placebo group with  no informed consent; n=4 in 
evolocumab group with  1 had no legally acceptable representative consent and 3 missing eligibility 
labs).  
Table 10. Summary of important protocol deviations -  Study 20120123 (all randomized 
subjects) 
The percentage of clinically important  protocol deviations were relatively low (7.0%),  however slightly 
higher in the evolocumab group compared with the  placebo group (7.6%  vs 5.7%,  respectively). 
Nevertheless, these deviations were not considered to impact data interpretation. 
Recruitment 
This study was conducted at 47 centers in 23 countries in the regions of Asia Pacific (3.8%),  Europe 
(65.8%),  Latin  America (16.5%), and North  America (13.9%). 
The first subject was enrolled on 24 March 2016 and the last  subject completed their last visit on 25 
November 2019. 
This study was a multicentre  study (n=47).  Considering that  more than half of the subjects (65.8%) 
were from Europe, the  population is sufficiently representative of Europe. 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol was finalized on 09  December 2014 (0 subjects enrolled between this date and 
the date of the first amendment). Subsequently, there were 2 amendments (Table  11)  
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/572365/2021  
Page 31/131 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 11. Protocol amendment  summary 
No amendments were made that  would compromise the endpoints  or outcomes of the  study. The 
amendments are considered valuable and are therefore acceptable. Moreover, all subjects were 
enrolled under the last amendment.  
Baseline  data 
Overall, 56.1%  of subjects in Study 20120123  were female, the majority (84.7%)  were white, and 
8.3% were of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity.  The mean (SD) age at time of enrolment was 13.7 (2.4)  years 
with  the range of 10 to  17 years of age. Thirty-nine (24.7%)  subjects were children 10-≤11 years of 
age and 119  (75.3%)  subjects were adolescents 12 -≤17  years of age. Baseline demographic 
characteristics are summarized in the Table 12.

Baseline lipid and other parameters  
Lipid parameters, high-sensitivity  C-reactive protein (hsCRP), fasting vitamin concentrations, and 
PCSK9 levels at baseline were generally similar across treatment groups. Overall mean (SD) LDL-C at 
baseline was 184.3  (45.6) mg/dL,  total cholesterol was 249.6  (47.7)  mg/dL, non-high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C)  was 202.6 (47.5)  mg/dL, and PCSK9 was 283.1  (95.4)  ng/mL.

Medical history 
No subject had CAD at baseline. One (1.9%)  placebo subject had a history of stroke at baseline.  The 
most common CHD risk factors at baseline (evolocumab, placebo) were low HDL-C  (38.5%,  34.0 %), 
family history of premature CHD (29.8%,  39.6%),  and hypertension (1.9%,  5.7%).   Low  HDL-C was also 
the most common risk factor for metabolic syndrome.  No subjects had congestive heart failure.  
Per Protocol 20120123  entry criteria, subjects in the FAS had a genetic, or if not available, a known 
clinical diagnosis of HeFH.   Sixty-six percent of subjects had documented genetic evidence of an FH-
causing mutation (64%  in the LDL receptor); 34% of subjects qualified on clinical criteria alone set by 
Simon-Broome, Dutch Lipid Clinic Network, or MEDPED.  
Data are summarized in the Table 14.

Lipid lowering background therapy 
All 157 (100%)  subjects in the FAS were taking lipid-regulating  medication at  baseline. One hundred 
and fifty-six (99%) subjects were on a statin at  baseline. Consistent with  American College of 
Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines, the majority (79%)  of subjects were on 
moderate- or high-intensity  statins at baseline and 20%  were on low-intensity  statins. Twenty subjects 
were on a statin  plus ezetimibe; 1 subject took only ezetimibe (Table 15).

Randomization was stratified  by age and baseline LDL-C and was generally balanced between groups 
(Table 16).

Tanner staging 
The distribution  of Tanner staging using gender criteria (genital size for males and breast development 
for females) and using  criteria of pubic hair were similar between treatment  groups at baseline (data 
not shown).

Overall baseline data, including  those on co-medications, distribution  of Tanner staging and risk 
factors, and stratification  factors, are well distributed across treatment groups, which is reassuring for 
the interpretation of the data. 
The study population can be considered representative of a paediatric HeFH  population. HeFH 
diagnosis was sufficiently established as the  diagnosis was for a large part of the population  by genetic 
testing  (66%). Thirty-nine (24.7%)  subjects were children 10-≤11  years of age, and 119 (75.3%) 
subjects were adolescents between 12-≤17  years of age. Moreover, the elevated mean LDL-C  baseline 
value of 4.8 mmol/L reasonably corresponds to an LDL-C level generally observed within a HeFH 
population. All subjects were received statin therapy, except for one subject in the placebo group who 
took only ezetimibe. The majority (79%)  of subjects were on moderate- or high-intensity  statins  at 
baseline, and 20%  were on low-intensity  statins.  
Numbers analysed 
Unless otherwise specified, efficacy and safety analyses were performed on the full analysis set (FAS) 
and data were summarized by randomized treatment group. One hundred fifty-seven subjects received 
at least 1 dose of investigational product and were included in the  FAS. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
•  percent change from baseline to week 24  in LDL-C 
Evolocumab was superior to placebo (p < 0.0001)  in lowering LDL-C in paediatric subjects with  HeFH 
(Table 17). The least-squares (LS) mean (SE) reduction in LDL-C from baseline at week 24 was 
44.5%  (2.2%) in the  evolocumab group and 6.2% (3.1%)  in the placebo group with  a mean treatment 
difference (95% CI) of 38.3% (31.1,  45.5).  Mean (SE) absolute LDL-C  values at week 24 were 2.7 
(0.15)  mmol/L in the evolocumab group and 4.5 (0.21)  mmol/L in the placebo group (Table 17). 
Reductions in LDL-C were observed by the first assessment at the week 12-time point and were 
maintained throughout  the study (24 weeks); the increase observed at week 24 is indicative of the end 
of the dosing interval (Figure 2). 
Sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint  of percent change from baseline to  week 24 using the CAS 
and using nonparametric analysis were consistent with  the primary analysis of the primary endpoint. 
Sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint using multiple  imputation could not  be conducted due to 
too few subjects (< 25 subjects) who had missing primary endpoint data.

Figure 2. Mean  percent change  from baseline in reflexive  LDL-C  by scheduled visit and 
treatment  group 
Evolocumab demonstrated a substantial  reduction in the primary endpoint of percent change from 
baseline to week 24 in LDL-C of 44% with  an actual LDL-C level of 4.8 mmol/L at  baseline and 2.7 
mmol/L at week 24  (reduction by 2.1  mmol/L). The mean treatment  difference between evolocumab 
and placebo was 38.3 % (p<0.0001).  In addition, this effect was maintained up to 104 weeks of 
treatment as demonstrated in  the open-label extension Study 20120124.   
The effect size in LDL-C lowering of 38.3% observed in this study in  pediatric subjects with  HeFH  was 
lower than the LDL-C lowering effect of 60%  observed in adults  with HeFH  in  the RUTHERFORD study 
(Study 20110117)  and other previous clinical studies (range: 60-70%)  submitted  during the initial 
MAA. During the procedure, the Applicant stated that  they are not aware of any clear biological or 
pharmacokinetic basis for a discrepant effect across the pediatric and adult HeFH  population. According 
to the Applicant,  one possible reason for the lower treatment effect size in the  pediatric population 
could be that the baseline LDL-C values were higher in the pediatric population in  Study 20120123 
compared with  the adult population in  previous evolocumab studies. Nevertheless,  it is acknowledged 
that the LDL-C lowering effect in  the paediatric HeFH  population is substantial  and clinically relevant.   
Secondary endpoints 
•  mean percent change from baseline to  weeks 22 and 24 in LDL-C 
The secondary endpoint of mean percent change from baseline to weeks 22 and 24 in LDL-C,  where 
week 22 reflects the peak and week 24 the  trough of the QM dosing interval, provides important 
information about the time-averaged effect of evolocumab therapy over the entire dosing interval. 
Results from this  analysis showed a reduction from baseline (treatment difference [95%  CI]) at the 
mean of weeks 22  and 24  of 42.1%  (35.9,  48.4).   The LS mean (SE) reduction in calculated LDL-C 
from baseline at the mean of weeks 22  and 24 was 48.0% (1.9%)  in  the evolocumab group and 
5.9%  (2.7%)  in the placebo group (Table 17, Figure 2, and Table 18).

Table 18. Analysis of mean  percent change in calculated LDL-C  from baseline to weeks  22 
and 24 - Study 20120123 (full analysis set) 
Treatment with  evolocumab demonstrated a substantial reduction in LDL-C from baseline to the mean 
of weeks 22 and 24. The mean reduction in  LDL-C from baseline at  the mean of weeks 22 and 24 was 
48.0%  in the evolocumab group compared with  5.9%  in the placebo group with  a treatment  difference 
of 42.1% (p<0.0001). 
•  percent change from baseline to week 24  in the following: non-HDL-C,  ApoB, total 
cholesterol/HDL-C ratio, ApoB/apoA1 ratio 
Evolocumab was superior to placebo (all p <  0.0001)  in improving all secondary lipid endpoints, 
including change in reflexive and calculated LDL-C from baseline to week 24,  and the  percent changes 
from baseline to week 24 in  non HDL-C, ApoB, total  cholesterol/HDL-C ratio, and ApoB/apolipoprotein 
A1 (ApoA1) ratio (Table  19).

Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints 
• 
change and percent change from baseline at each scheduled assessment in the  following: LDL-
C, Non-HDL-C,  ApoB, total  cholesterol/HDL-C ratio, ApoB/ApoA1 ratio, total cholesterol, VLDL-
C, HDL-C, ApoA1, Triglycerides, Lp(a), and PCSK9 change from baseline at each scheduled 
assessment (week 12,  week 22, and week 24). 
The treatment effect of evolocumab on each lipid  parameter and PCSK9 was generally consistent 
across all timepoints. Overall, the  treatment effect on each lipid parameter and PCSK9 was slightly 
larger at week 22  (middle of the  dosing interval) than  at week 12 or week 24 (end of the dosing 
interval) which is consistent with  other studies of evolocumab. 
Primary endpoint analyses were supported by the secondary cholesterol profile evaluation showing 
significant reductions in, e.g. non-HDL-C,  ApoB, total  cholesterol/HDL-C ratio and ApoB/apoA1 ratio. 
Furthermore, the exploratory efficacy endpoints showed that  the treatment effect of evolocumab was 
generally consistent across the timepoints  week 12, week 22 and week 24. The smaller reductions at 
week 12 and 24  compared with week 22  are indicative of the  end of the dosing interval. 
•  Carotid Intima-media Thickness Test (cIMT) 
Carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT)  uses ultrasound to measure the thickness of the inner 2 layers 
of the carotid artery, the intima and media, and can detect thickening.  Lateral, anterior, and posterior 
measurements of the right common carotid artery (RCCA) and left common carotid artery  were 
assessed at baseline and at week 24.  Mean baseline values in each treatment group at each site were 
< 0.6  mm. The mean change from baseline to week 24  at every site assessed was negative in the 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report

evolocumab group (indicating  a reduction in thickness) with the  exception of posterior LCCA which was 
marginally positive. The mean change from baseline to  week 24 at all 6 sites assessed was positive in 
the placebo group (indicating  thickening). 
Table 20. Summary of Carotid intima-media  Thickness (cIMT) - Average  of largest RCCA and 
LCCA by scheduled visit- Study 20120123 (Full analysis set – actual treatment) 
Carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT)  at baseline and week 24, showed small reductions in cIMT 
observed with evolocumab compared with  small increases in cIMT in the  placebo group, suggestive of 
a beneficial effect of evolocumab concerning atherogenesis. Nevertheless, the results in cIMT are 
considered too limited (short study period and small reduction) to  draw firm conclusions. Moreover, 
statistical  significance analyses have not been provided.  
Subgroup analyses 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/572365/2021  
Page 47/131 
 
 
 
 
 
Prespecified subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint are depicted in Figure 3 below.  
These included subgroups by age (< 14, ≥  14; screening LDL-C value (< 160 mg/dL,  ≥160 mg/dL), 
gender, race (white,  black, or other), region, baseline LDL-C < or ≥ median (173.0 mg/dL),  glucose 
tolerance status  (type 2 diabetes [T2D], metabolic syndrome, or neither, baseline PCSK9 < or ≥ 
median (270.0 ng/mL),  and statin intensity  (high, moderate, low). 
Subgroup analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints for LDL-C (both  at week 24 and the  mean 
of weeks 22 and 24) showed a greater reduction in LDL-C with  evolocumab, compared with placebo, 
within  all subgroups (all p < 0.05) except for categories of black race, “other” race, glucose tolerance 
status of metabolic syndrome, and glucose tolerance status  of T2D, where in each case there were too 
few subjects per subgroup for the analysis. 
Interaction by subgroup analyses showed evidence of a greater treatment effect of evolocumab for 
subjects with screening LDL-C values < 160  mg/dL and baseline LDL-C values < median (173 mg/dL) 
at the mean of week 22 and week 24, but  not at week 24, compared with  screening LDL-C values ≥ 
160 mg/dL  and baseline LDL-C values ≥ median (173 mg/dL).  There was no evidence of a different 
treatment effect across other subgroups.

Additionally, subgroup analysis of the  primary efficacy endpoint by age category 10 to ≤ 11  years vs 12 
to ≤ 17  years has been conducted. The least squares (LS) mean (SE) reduction in LDL-C from baseline 
at week 24  was 44.54%  (4.67%)  and 44.80%  (2.31%)  in  the evolocumab group and 15.97%  (6.28%) 
and 2.80%  (3.41%)  in the placebo group for the 10 to ≤ 11  years and 12  to ≤ 17 years groups, 
respectively.  The least squares mean treatment difference (95% CI) was 28.57%  (12.71,  44.43)  for 
10 to ≤  11 years and 42.00%  (33.85,  50.16)  for 12 to ≤ 17 years.  The interaction p-value was 0.13, 
indicating  there is no evidence of a different treatment effect for the  2 age subgroups.  
Prespecified subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint showed no large relevant differences for the 
subgroups of gender, race, age, region and baseline PCSK9; no large relevant differences were 
observed. 
However, a slightly larger LDL-C reduction was observed in the subgroup of screening LDL-C values < 
160 mg/dL  and baseline LDL-C values < median (173 mg/dL)  at the mean of week 22 and 24, but not 
at week 24  compared with compared with  screening LDL-C values ≥  160 mg/dL and baseline LDL-C 
values ≥ median (173 mg/dL)  (interaction p-value of 0.037  and 0.024, respectively). Nevertheless, the 
LDL-C lowering effect in  all these subgroups are considered clinically relevant.  
Study 20120124 (HAUSER-OLE)  (ongoing):  
Methods 
Study participants 
Inclusion criteria 
Subjects who completed Study 20120123  (and did not  experience a treatment-related serious adverse 
event), and males and females 10 -≤ 17  years of age with  a diagnosis of HoFH  and receiving optimized 
standard of care lipid-lowering therapy per locally applicable guidelines, were eligible for this study.  
The diagnosis of HoFH  had to be by genetic confirmation or a clinical diagnosis based on a history of an 
untreated LDL-C concentration > 500  mg/dL (13 mmol/L) together with  either xanthoma before 10 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report

years of age in the subject, or evidence of HeFH  in both  parents.  At screening, HoFH subjects had to 
be on a low-fat  diet and had to  be receiving background lipid-lowering  therapy (such as statins, 
cholesterol absorption inhibitors, bile acid sequestrants, nicotinic acid or combinations thereof).  
Lipid-lowering therapy must have been stable for ≥ 4 weeks prior to screening.  Fasting  LDL-C for 
HoFH  subjects had to be ≥ 130 mg/dL (3.4  mmol/L) and fasting triglycerides had to be ≤ 400 mg/dL 
(4.5 mmol/L)  as determined by the  central laboratory at screening.   
Exclusion criteria 
The following were exclusion criteria for subjects with  HoFH  (those not  rolling over from a prior 
evolocumab study): estimated glomerular filtration  rate (eGFR) < 30 ml/min/1.73  m2;  CK > 3 x upper 
limit  of normal (ULN);  AST or ALT > 2 x ULN;  (all screening by central laboratory); known active 
infection or major hematologic, renal, metabolic, gastrointestinal or endocrine dysfunction; subject has 
taken a cholesterylester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor  in the last 12 months,  or mipomersen or 
lomitapide in the last 5 months  prior to LDL-C  screening, or has received any therapy to inhibit  PCSK9 
within  12 weeks prior to screening. 
General inclusion criteria seem appropriate to reflect the  patients for which an indication is being 
sought, i.e. pediatric patients with  HeFH  and HoFH.  Since Study 20120124  is the open-label extension 
study of Study 20120123,  pediatric patients with  HeFH  who completed the  parent study and did not 
experience treatment-related adverse events were eligible to enrol in this OLE  study. Additionally, de-
novo pediatric patients aged 10 to 17  years with a diagnosis of HoFH  and receiving optimized SOC 
lipid-lowering therapy were also eligible to enrol in this  OLE study. HoFH  was diagnosed by genetic 
confirmation or by clinical diagnosis based on a history of an untreated LDL cholesterol concentration 
greater than  500 mg/dL (13  mmol/L) together with  either xanthoma before 10 years of age or 
evidence of HeFH  in both parents. These criteria are in line with  previous studies with  HoFH  and 
considered appropriate. 
Exclusion criteria can also generally be accepted. 
Treatments 
Study 20120124  is an open-label-single-arm, multicenter study (Figure 4) All subjects received 
evolocumab 420 mg SC QM using either AI/Pen or automated mini-doser (AMD) administration.   Each 
QM administration  of evolocumab with  the AI/Pen consisted of 3 injections of 140  mg evolocumab in 
1.0 mL  for a total of 420 mg/3.0  mL of evolocumab administered. Each QM administration of 
evolocumab AMD consisted of 1 injection of 420 mg/3.5  mL of evolocumab. Subjects had the 
opportunity to switch  between the AI/Pen and AMD at any scheduled time point where evolocumab 
was supplied to the subject, provided the appropriate supply was available. The planned study duration 
is approximately 80 weeks; interim data from a minimum of 28 weeks of investigational product 
exposure for all subjects who did not discontinue the  study is included in the submission. 
In this study, subjects had the option of self-administration, defined as SC administration of 
evolocumab by the  subject, designee or a qualified health care professional in a non-investigator site 
setting  (eg, at  home). The subject (or designee, if not a qualified healthcare professional) must have 
demonstrated competency at administration of SC injections at the  study site before self-
administration was permitted

The primary and secondary objectives/endpoints are considered appropriate. The primary objective of 
this study was to characterize the safety and tolerability of long-term administration  of evolocumab 
among pediatric patients  with HeFH  or HoFH.  The key secondary objective was to  characterize the 
efficacy of long-term administration of evolocumab as assessed by LDL-C and other lipid parameters. 
Sample size 
This study planned to enroll approximately 124 subjects, including  an estimated 70% rollover rate for 
subjects with HeFH  from parent Study 20120123  and approximately 10 de novo subjects with  HoFH.

Statistical methods 
The interim analysis was conducted when all the enrolled subjects in the study had the opportunity  to 
experience 28 weeks of investigation  product exposure or had early terminated from the study. At that 
time, the database related to the  interim analyses of the study was cleaned, locked and a snapshot 
was taken. Statistical  analysis in this  interim analysis was descriptive in nature for all safety and 
efficacy endpoints if applicable. No  statistical hypotheses testing  or missing value imputation  was 
planned. 
There was no study stopping rule for either futility  or efficacy and the current design and execution of 
the study will  continue without  any changes regardless of the result of the interim analysis. 
Results 
Participant flow 
HeFH  subjects 
A total of 150 pediatric HeFH  subjects who participated in Study 20120123  entered open-label 
extension Study 20120124;  101 subjects received evolocumab in the parent study and 49 subjects 
received placebo in the parent study (Table 22). As of the data cut-off, 40 (26.7%)  HeFH  subjects 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/572365/2021  
Page 53/131 
 
 
 
 
were still  on evolocumab and 104  (69.3%)  subjects completed evolocumab in the study. Six (4.0%) 
subjects discontinued evolocumab; all discontinued evolocumab at the subject’s request. As of data 
cut-off, 105  (70.0%)  subjects have completed the study, 42  (28.0%) subjects are still  on study, and 3 
(2.0%)  have discontinued the study by withdrawing  consent. 
HoFH  subjects 
Thirteen de-novo pediatric HoFH  subjects were enrolled in the  open-label extension study.  One HoFH 
subject did not receive any evolocumab and was not included in the FAS (Table 22). As of the data 
cut-off, all the remaining subjects have either completed evolocumab (11 [84.6%])  or discontinued 
evolocumab (1 [7.7%];  at subject's request). As of data cut-off, all subjects have either completed the 
study (11 [84.6%])  or discontinued the study (2  [15.4%], 11  years old and 12 years old patients).

subjects) 
HeFH 
Almost all patients from Study 20120123,  i.e. 150 out of 157 patients,  rolled over to  the OLE study, of 
which 101  subjects received evolocumab in the parent study and 49 subjects received placebo. At the 
data cut-off, already a high proportion of HeFH  patients  (70.0%)  completed the study and 28.0 % 
HeFH  were still  participating the  study. At the data cut-off, the percentage of HeFH  patients  who 
discontinued the study was relatively low (2.0%,  n=3);   all discontinued  due to  withdrawal of consent 
from the  study.

HoFH 
Thirteen de-novo pediatric HoFH  patients enrolled in the OLE study, of which one HoFH  subject did not 
receive any evolocumab and was not  included in the FAS. At the data cut-off, HoFH  patients have 
either completed the  study (84.6%, n=11)  or discontinued the study (15.4%,  n=2).  The reasons for 
the discontinuation  of the study was withdrawal of consent and lost to follow-up. Six HoFH  subjects 
aged 10-≤11  years (for whom an indication is being sought) were enrolled in this study of which  one 
discontinued the study.  As such, the number of HoFH  subjects aged 10-≤11 years who completed the 
study (n=5)  is limited, however, acceptable considering the rarity of the disease.  
To date, none of the HeFH  or HoFH  patients discontinued evolocumab treatment due to  an adverse 
event, which is reassuring. 
Protocol deviations 
HeFH  Subjects 
Overall, 9 (6.0%)  HeFH  subjects had at least 1 IPD in the categories described in the Table 23. Four 
(2.7%)  subjects had IPDs reported as ‘other’; these consisted of 1 subject enrolling into the  Study 2 
days prior to completing all procedures for the parent Study 20120123  and 3 instances of incomplete 
consent/assent forms in which  either the  subject, investigator, or both had not signed the appropriate 
sections of the  consent form. All 3 instances of incomplete consent/assent were resolved. One (0.7%) 
HeFH  subject had an eligibility deviation for not having a legally acceptable representative consent. 
Thirty-seven (24.7%)  HeFH  subjects had a non-important  protocol deviation due to COVID-19. All 
COVID-19 protocol deviations occurred in HeFH  subjects. The most frequent protocol deviation due to 
COVID-19 was alternative site visits (25  [15.3%]),  partial missed visit (25  [15.3%]),  and alternative 
evolocumab administration (21 [12.9%]). 
HoFH  subjects 
No HoFH  had an IPD or protocol deviation due to COVID-19.

Table 23. Summary of important protocol deviations -  Study 20120124 (all enrolled 
subjects) 
The percentage of clinically important  protocol deviations were relatively low (5.5%)  and not 
considered to impact data interpretation. 
Recruitment 
This study was conducted at 46 centers in 23 countries in the regions of Asia Pacific (7.4%),  Europe 
(64.4%),  Latin  America (16.0%), and North  America (12.3%)The first subject was enrolled on 10 
September 2016.  The last subject last visit on or prior to  data cut off date (08  June 2020) was 28 May 
2020. 
The interim analyses presented in this  report are based on a database snapshot date of 29 July 2020. 
This study was a multicentre  study (n=46).  Considering that  more than half of the subjects (64.4%) 
were from Europe, the  population is sufficiently representative of Europe.  
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol was finalized on 27  May 2015 (0 subjects enrolled between this  date and the date 
of the first amendment). Subsequently, contingency measures were implemented to manage study 
conduct during the COVID-19 pandemic. These measures included remote source data review and 
source data verification, direct to  patient delivery of evolocumab supply (home delivery), and 
alternative subject visit procedures (virtual or remote visits) (Table 24).

Study 20120124  was primarily designed as an open-label extension for pediatric HeFH  subjects 
participating in  Study 20120123.   Demographic and baseline characteristics for HeFH  subjects in this 
study were consistent  with those provided above for Study 20120123. 
In short, 55.3%  of HeFH  subjects were female, the majority (84.0%)  were white,  and 8.7% were of 
Hispanic/Latino  ethnicity. Subjects were from Europe (65.3%),  Latin  America (17.3%), North  America 
(13.3%),  and Asia Pacific (4.0%).  The mean (SD) age at  the time of enrollment in  Study 20120124 
was 14.1 (2.5)  years with the  range of 10 to 18 years of age and 113  (75.3%) subjects were 
adolescents between 12 and 17 years of age. Eight  HeFH  subjects were 18 years old at the time of 
rollover into Study 20120124,  however all subjects were ≤ 17  years old at the  time of enrollment into 
the parent Study 20120123.   
Mean (SD) LDL-C at baseline was 184.3  (46.1) mg/dL,  total cholesterol was 249.5  (48.1)  mg/dL, non-
HDL-C was 202.6  (48.0) mg/dL,  and PCSK9 was 282.9 (96.4)  ng/mL.  Mean (SD) hsCRP at  baseline 
was 0.956 (1.311)  mg/L  and mean concentrations of vitamin A, D, E, and K were within  normal 
reference ranges. 
HoFH  subjects 
Study 20120124  also enrolled 13 de novo pediatric subjects with HoFH;  12 of these subjects received 
investigational product.  The majority of HoFH  subjects were male (83.3%)  and white  (75.0%).   No 
HoFH  subjects were of Hispanic/Lantino  ethnicity.  Subjects were from Europe (50.0%)  and Asia Pacific 
(50.0%).   The median (Q1, Q3) age at the time of enrollment was 11.5 (11.0,  13.0) years; 6 (46.2%) 
subjects were < 12 years old and 7 (53.8%)  subjects were between 12- ≤17  years of age. All 12  HoFH 
subjects who received evolocumab in the study had documented genetic evidence of HoFH. 
In general, de novo HoFH  subjects had higher median (Q1, Q3) lipid  parameter values at baseline 
compared to HeFH  subjects rolling over from the parent study including  LDL-C, non-HDL-C, total 
cholesterol, ApoB, Lp(A), and PCSK9. Median (Q1, Q3) HDL-C  and vitamin D was lower in HoFH 
subjects at baseline compared to HeFH  subjects. In HoFH  subjects, median (Q1, Q3)  LDL-C at baseline 
was 397.5 (342.5,  475.0)  mg/dL, total  cholesterol was 447.5  (411.8, 529.3)  mg/dL,  non-HDL-C was 
410.8  (360.8,  491.0) mg/dL,  and PCSK9 was 472.0 (339.0,  669.0)  ng/mL. Median (Q1,  Q3) hsCRP at 
baseline was 0.275  (0.185,  1.530) mg/L  and median concentrations of vitamin A, D, E, and K were 
within  normal reference ranges. 
Medical history and background therapy 
HeFH  Subjects 
Coronary heart disease (CHD) characteristics at baseline, including  HeFH  diagnosis, are summarized in 
Table 25.  One (0.7%)  subject had a history of stroke. The most common CHD risk factors were low 
HDL-C (38.0%)  and family history of premature CHD (34.0%).  All subjects in  the FAS had diagnosis of 
HeFH  at baseline. For HeFH  subjects, 99  (66.0%) had genetic evidence of an FH-causing mutation,  of 
which 96  showed evidence in the LDL  receptor. No subjects had congestive heart failure. 
All 150 (100.0%)  HeFH  subjects in the FAS were taking lipid-regulating  medication at baseline 
including statins  (149 [99.3%])  and ezetimibe (21 [14.0%]). 
HoFH  Subjects 
Coronary heart disease characteristics at baseline, including  HoFH  diagnosis, are summarized in Table 
25. One (8.3%) HoFH  subject had a history of a coronary artery bypass graft. The most common CHD 
risk factors were low HDL-C  (75.0%) and family history of premature CHD (41.7%).  For HoFH 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report

subjects, all 12 (100.0%)  subjects showed genetic evidence supporting the diagnosis of HoFH  via the 
LDL receptor at baseline of which 3 subjects with receptor negative mutation  (<2% residual activity),  4 
subjects with receptor defective (2 to 25% residual activity), and 5 subjects with receptor unknown 
(unclassified). No subjects had congestive heart failure.  
All 12 (100.0%)  subjects in the FAS were talking lipid-regulating  medication at baseline including 
statins  (100.0%) and ezetimibe (100.0%).  No HoFH  subjects in Study 20120124  were receiving 
lipoprotein apheresis therapy.

Since almost all patients  (96%) from Study 20120123  rolled over to Study 20120124,  the  baseline 
data is generally consistent with  those described for Study 20120123. 
HoFH 
In Study 20120124,  12 HoFH  patients  received IP. Most of the pediatric HoFH  patients were male 
(83.3%,  n=10)  and white  (75.0%,  n=9). Six (46.2%)  patients were 10 to  < 12 years of age and 7 
(53.8%)  were between 12 and 17 years of age. The mean LDL-C at baseline was 10.3 mmol/L and all 
the HoFH  patients  in this study had HoFH  diagnosis by genetic testing.  Furthermore, all HoFH  patients 
were on statin  (100%)  and ezetimibe (100%)  therapy at baseline. No HoFH  subjects in Study 
20120124  were receiving lipoprotein apheresis therapy. 
Numbers analysed 
Overall, 162 subjects received at least 1  dose of evolocumab and were included in the FAS. One 
(0.6%)  subject was excluded from the FAS as this  subject did not receive any dose of evolocumab. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
•  percent change from baseline to week 80  in LDL-C, non-HDL-C, ApoB,  total cholesterol/HDL-C 
ratio, and ApoB/ApoA1 ratio as well as change from baseline in LDL-C at week 80 
HeFH  Subjects 
Mean (SE) absolute reflexive LDL-C was 4.77 (1.24)  mmol/L at baseline and 3.11 (0.15)  mmol/L at 
week 80.  The mean (SE) reduction from baseline (of parent Study 20120123)  in reflexive LDL-C was 
36.3%  (2.5%) at week 80.   
Reductions in reflexive LDL-C were observed by the first assessment at the  week 12 timepoint  and 
were maintained throughout  the study both  for subjects randomized to the evolocumab in the  parent 
and subjects randomized to placebo in the parent study; mean (SE) reductions of 44.4% (1.7)  at week 
12, 40.6%  (2.2)  at week 48, and 36.3% (2.5)  at week 80 (Table 17,  Table 26 and  
Figure 5). Similar reductions from baseline in calculated LDL-C were observed; mean (SE) reductions 
of 44.4% (1.7) at week 12, 40.5% (2.2) at week 48, and 36.2% (2.5) at week 80. 
Evolocumab also improved other secondary lipid endpoints, including  reduction from baseline to week 
80 of non-HDL-C (mean [SE] 33.0% [2.4]),  ApoB (26.0% [2.3]),  total cholesterol/HDL-C ratio (28.9% 
[2.3]),  and ApoB/ApoA1 (30.6% [2.5]). 
HoFH  Subjects 
To note: Due to  the small sample size and non-normal distribution,  efficacy results for HoFH  are 
presented using the  median rather than mean. 
Median (Q1, Q3) absolute reflexive LDL-C was 10.30  mmol/L (8.87,  12.31)  at baseline and 8.00 
mmol/L (5.67,  12.12)  at week 80 (Table  27 and  
Figure 5).  
Reductions in reflexive LDL-C were observed by the first assessment at the  week 12 timepoint  and was 
maintained throughout  the study; median (Q1, Q3) reductions of 12.2 % (-2.6,  32.5) at  week 12, 14.5 
% (-3.7,  38.6)  at week 48, and 14.3 % (-3.5,  40.6) at week 80. Near identical reductions from 
baseline in calculated LDL-C were observed at week 12,  24, and 80.

An analysis of efficacy in the subset of 6  HoFH  subjects <  12 years of age in Study 20120124  was 
carried out to  evaluate consistency of effect in  these younger subjects relative to  subjects 12 to  17 
years of age enrolled in Study 20110271.   For the  6 HoFH  subjects < 12 years of age in Study 
20120124,  the median (Q1, Q3) reduction from baseline in calculated LDL-C was 12.2%  (0.6%, 26.2%) 
at week 12,  4.6% (-3.7%,  41.3%)  at  week 48, and 19.2  % (1.2%,  37.2%)  at week 80.  
Evolocumab also improved other secondary lipid endpoints, including  reductions from baseline to  week 
80 in non-HDL-C  (median [Q1, Q3] 13.0 % [-2.7%,  40.7%]),  ApoB (19.2%  [-11.6%,  33.3%]),  and 
ApoB/ApoA1 ratio (3.0% [-9.3,  35.7]).  For total cholesterol/HDL-C ratio, inter-subject variability was 
large; reductions were observed at week 12  (median [Q1,  Q3]; 6.2% [-12.8,  29.1])  and week 48 
(5.5%  [-6.6, 28.2]),  but  not at week 80  (3.7% [-7.6,  41.2].

Evolocumab therapy resulted in a consistent LDL-C  lowering effect from the  start of the OLE study up 
to week 80  in both subsets of pediatric HeFH  and HoFH  subjects. For the HeFH  subjects randomized to 
evolocumab treatment in the parent study, the  reductions in LDL-C  were maintained through week 80, 
thereby demonstrating maintenance of effect over a period of 2 years (104 weeks across both 
studies). The HeFH  subjects randomized to placebo in the  parent study demonstrated LDL-C reductions 
by the first time points of 12 weeks. Overall, the mean LDL-C reductions in the HeFH  subset were 
44.4%,  40.6% and 36.3%  at week 12, 48  and 80, respectively. As expected, LDL-C reductions were 
lower in HoFH  subjects compared with HeFH  subjects. For HoFH  subjects, the median LDL-C reductions 
were 12.2%,  14.5%,  and 14.3% at week 12, 48 and 80, respectively. The effect size in median LDL-C 
reduction of 12-14.5%  with the  420 mg QM regimen observed in the  pediatric HoFH  population  in 
Study 20120124  appears somewhat lower than  those observed with the 420 mg QM  regimen in the 
studies previously submitted, i.e. Study 20110233  (TESLA) and Study 20110271  (TAUSSIG) in the 
overall HoFH  population consisting adult  and pediatric subjects 12 years of age and over (32% and 
16.3%,  respectively). However, the effect size was consistent with  the median LDL-C reduction in the 
subset of 14 adolescents HoFH  from Study 20110271  who received the 420 mg QM regimen or the 
(higher dose) 420  mg Q2W regimen (13.3%,  8.1%, 8.7%,  9.5%,  and 20.0%  at weeks 48,  96, 144, 
192,  and 216,  respectively; see also section “supportive study”). Although the  pediatric HoFH  subjects 
showed a slightly  less LDL-C lowering effect compared with the overall HoFH  population, the LDL-C 
lowering effect in  the pediatric patients  is still considered substantial.   The efficacy results according to 
LRLR mutation  demonstrated that  treatment with  evolocumab leads to a reduction in LDL-C levels 
regardless of the type of LDLR mutation.  However, within  each subgroup of LDLR mutation  there was a 
large degree of intersubject variability including  non-responders which, however, were in  the minority.

For the HoFH  subjects 10 - ≤11 years of age, the median LDL-C reduction was comparable with the 
overall pediatric HoFH  population (12.2%,  4.6% and 19.2%  at week 12, week 48 and week 80, 
respectively). 
Furthermore, for both  the pediatric HeFH  and HoFH  subsets, the  findings of LDL-C lowering effect were 
supported by beneficial effects observed for other lipid parameters in e.g. non-HDL-C,  ApoB, Total 
cholesterol/HDL-C ratio and ApoB/apoA1 ratio. 
Overall, the data of this OLE study  confirmed the earlier finding of the long-term lowering LDL-C effect 
with  evolocumab.  
•  change in cIMT from baseline at  week 80 
HeFH  Subjects 
In HeFH  subjects, mean baseline values in  each treatment group at each site were < 0.6  mm (Table 
28). The mean change from baseline to week 24, 48,  and 80 at every site assessed was negative 
(indicating  a reduction in thickness) for subjects who  received evolocumab in the parent study with  the 
exception of anterior and posterior left common carotid artery (LCCA) at week 48  which were 
marginally positive. Similarly, the mean change from baseline to week 24, 48, and 80 at  all 6  sites 
assessed were negative for subjects who received placebo in the parent study with the  exception of 
lateral right common carotid artery (RCCA) week 24 and posterior LCCA week 24 and 48. 
HoFH  Subjects 
Eight  of 12  HoFH  subjects had cIMT data. In HoFH  subjects, median baseline value in the  lateral and 
posterior LCCA was < 0.6 mm. The median changes from baseline to week 24,  48, and 80 were largely 
negative in  the HoFH  group with a few exceptions; week 24 (lateral LCCA), week 48 (lateral RCCA, 
lateral LCCA), and week 80  (anterior RCCA, posterior RCCA).

Similarly, as observed in Study 20120123,  treatment with  evolocumab resulted in small mean 
reductions in cIMT from baseline to week 24, 48  and 80 in both subsets of subjects with HeFH  and 
HoFH,  suggestive of a beneficial effect of evolocumab with respect to atherogenesis. Nevertheless, the 
results in cIMT are considered too limited (short  study period and small reduction) to draw firm 
conclusions. Moreover, statistical significance analyses have not been provided.

•  percent change at measured timepoints  (week 12, 48 and 80)  in LDL-C, total  cholesterol, non-
HDL-C, ApoB, total cholesterol/HDL-C ratio, ApoB/ApoA1 ratio, triglycerides, very low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), HDL-C,  ApoA1, Lp(a) 
HeFH  Subjects 
Overall, evolocumab improved lipid parameters at each study assessment with  the following 
exceptions, no reduction in percent change from baseline was observed in triglycerides at week 12, 
reflective VLDL-C at week 12, and Lp(a)  at week 80. 
HoFH  Subjects 
Overall, evolocumab generally improved lipid parameters at each study assessment with  the following 
exceptions, no reduction in percent change from baseline was observed in TC/HDL-C ratio at week 80, 
triglycerides at week 12  or 48,  and calculated and reflective VLDL-C at week 12 or 48; and no increase 
in percent change from baseline was observed in ApoA1 at week 12 or HDL-C at any timepoint. 
The exploratory efficacy endpoints showed that  the treatment effect of evolocumab was generally 
consistent across the timepoints  week 12, week 48 and week 80, with  respect to  total cholesterol, non-
HDL-C, ApoB, TC/HDL-C ratio, ApoB/ApoA1 of the HeFH  subset and total  cholesterol, non-HDL-C, 
ApoB, TC/HDL-C ratio, ApoB/ApoA1 with  some exceptions at  several timepoints. Similar as observed in 
previous studies submitted  during the initial  MAA, evolocumab resulted in a small increase in HDL-C 
(range: 6-8.5% change from baseline) in the HeFH  subset, whereas no increase in percent change 
from baseline was observed in the HoFH  subset.

2.3.3.  Supportive study 
Study 20110271:  A multicenter, open-label  study to assess the long-term safety, 
tolerability, and efficacy of AMG  145 on LDL-C  in subjects with severe familial 
hypercholesterolemia ( final clinical study report) - TAUSSIG 
Interim data from Study 20110271,  along with  data from the parent Study 20110233,  was presented 
in the initial  MAA for evolocumab supporting the  approval of the indication  in adults and pediatric (12 
years and over) subjects with  HoFH.   Subsequently, the final results from Study 20110271  has been 
submitted  and assessed during a Type II variation application procedure in 2019 
(EMEA/H/C/003766/II/0031).  In the  current extension procedure, the focus primarily lies on the data 
from pediatric subjects with  HoFH  from the  final analysis of Study 20110271. 
Methods 
The study design has already been discussed during the initial  MAA and the  Type II variation 
application, but  for understanding briefly described below. 
This phase 2/3  open-label extension study was designed to characterize the safety, tolerability, and 
efficacy of long-term administration of evolocumab in subjects 12 to ≤ 80 years of age with  HoFH  or 
severe FH (ie, all those not meeting the protocol criteria for HoFH).   Non-apheresis subjects were

required to have elevated LDL C (≥ 100 mg/dL  [2.6 mmol/L] for subjects with  diagnosed CHD or risk 
equivalent and ≥130  mg/dL [3.4  mmol/L] for subjects without  diagnosed CHD or risk equivalent).  
Apheresis subjects did  not have a minimum LDL C requirement.   
Subjects not on lipid apheresis at enrollment or within  the  prior 8 weeks (referred to throughout  as 
non-apheresis subjects) initiated treatment  with  evolocumab 420 mg QM.  Subjects on lipid  apheresis 
at enrollment (referred to throughout as apheresis subjects) initiated treatment  with evolocumab 420 
mg once every 2 weeks (Q2W).  Dose frequency changes (420 mg QM vs 420 mg Q2W) were 
permitted at open-label extension week 12,  24, or other visits with  Amgen approval if subjects met 
specific protocol criteria.  Subjects with  < 5% LDL-C reduction from baseline and serum unbound 
PCSK9 < 100  ng/mL could discontinue evolocumab.  If serum unbound PCSK9 was ≥  100 ng/mL with 
QM dosing, the subject could switch  to evolocumab 420 mg Q2W treatment, if clinically indicated (e.g., 
LDL-C goals not met).  Subjects on apheresis with ≥ 5%  LDL-C reduction from baseline and serum 
unbound PCSK9 < 100 ng/mL with  Q2W treatment  could switch to QM  dosing. 
Subjects visited the  study centre Q2W or QM for evolocumab administration.  After open-label 
extension week 24, subjects either continued to visit the study centre for administration  of evolocumab 
or could decide to self-administer evolocumab in a non-clinic setting  (eg, in the home) once they 
demonstrated competency with self-administration.  The study design and treatment schema is 
provided in Figure 7. 
The primary endpoint was the subject incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events.  The 
secondary efficacy endpoints were percent change in LDL-C, non-HDL-C,  Lp(a), ApoB, total 
cholesterol/HDL-C ratio, and ApoB/ApoA1 ratio from baseline at each scheduled visit and response rate 
of subjects with  15%  or greater reduction in LDL-C  by scheduled visit.

Disposition of subjects 
A total of 300 subjects were enrolled (a total  of 246 subjects enrolled directly in Study 20110271  and 
54 subjects rolled over from Study 20110233);  106 HoFH  subjects including  14 (4.7%)  pediatric 
subjects and 194 severe FH subjects.  Of the 14 adolescent subjects, 3 subjects discontinued the study 
(withdrew  consent). After the completion of the large, double-blind, placebo-controlled cardiovascular 
outcomes Study 20110118  (FOURIER), the study was closed as further collection of data from this 
open-label study would  not contribute meaningfully to the long-term understanding of evolocumab 
safety.  
Demography and Other Baseline Characteristics 
The 14 pediatric subjects in  Study 20110271  included 9  (64.3%) men/boys and 
5 (35.7%)  women/girls; median (Q1, Q3)  age at baseline was 14.0  (14.0, 16.0)  years.  Most subjects 
were white  (78.6%),  followed by other (14.3%),  and American Indian or Alaskan native (7.1%).  
Ethnicity  was Hispanic or Latino  for 14.3%  of subjects.  All 14  pediatric subjects had a diagnosis of 
HoFH,  of which 10  were not on lipid apheresis at baseline and 4 were receiving lipid apheresis. Median 
(Q1, Q3) serum concentration of calculated LDL-C at baseline for pediatric subjects was 9.10  (7.97, 
11.62)  mmol/L.  At baseline, all pediatric subjects were on moderate- (14.3%)  or high-intensity statins 
(85.7%).  Four subjects were receiving apheresis and 10 were not.    
Efficacy results 
In the 14 adolescent HoFH  subjects in  Study 20110271,  median (Q1, Q3)  reductions from baseline in 
calculated LDL-C at open-label extension weeks 48, 96, 144,  192,  and 216  were 13.3%  (3.7%, 
56.2%),  8.1% (5.1%,  28.1%),  8.7% (- 16.6%,  26.2%),  9.5% ( -7.4%,  21.2%),  and 20.0% (-22.4%, 
42.6%),  respectively. To note, efficacy data at week 216  was available for 9 adolescent subjects with 
HoFH  (n=2  apheresis and  n=7  non-apheresis). 
Furthermore, at most visits of open-label Study 20110271,  pediatric subjects with  HoFH  had 
improvements in secondary lipid parameters.  Reductions from  baseline at week 216 of Study 
20110271  included non-HDL-C  (median [Q1, Q3]  of 12.0%  [-23.0%,  38.6%]),  ApoB (8.9%  [-15.5%, 
28.1%]),  and ApoB/ApoA1 ratio (17.2%  [-1.2%,  37.8%]).   For total cholesterol/ HDL-C ratio, inter-
subject variability was large; reductions were observed at most, but  not all, timepoints. 
A waterfall plot  of the  LDL-C lowering effect at week 84  by LDLR mutation  status at  baseline for 
pediatric subjects with  HoFH  in Study 20110271  is provided in  Figure 8.  There were no subjects with 
a measurement at week 84 for receptor negative, 7 subjects with  receptor defective, and 3 subjects 
with  receptor unclassified.

In comparing the dosing regimens in  Study 20110271,  the titration  analysis set (TAS) was analyzed.  
The TAS was the subset of subjects who were exposed to evolocumab 420 mg QM for at least 12 
weeks and then to evolocumab 420  mg Q2W for at least 12 weeks. There were 7 pediatric subjects 
with  HoFH  in the TAS.  The median (Q1, Q3) percent reductions in calculated LDL-C from baseline for 
pediatric subjects with  HoFH  in the  TAS were similar for the  2 dosing regimens with  21.18 % (2.78, 
39.05)  after 12  weeks of 420  mg QM dosing and 21.72 % (17.21,  44.21)  after 12 weeks of 420 mg 
Q2W dosing.  However, the  mean (SE) percent reductions in  calculated LDL-C from baseline were 
21.15%  (7.97) after 12 weeks of 420  mg QM  dosing and 31.12 % (8.09)  after 12 weeks of 420 mg 
Q2W dosing.  Median absolute reduction in calculated LDL C from baseline was 78.5  mg/dL and 81.0 
mg/dL, (mean: 54.1  mg/dL and 82.4 mg/dL)  after 12 weeks of QM  and Q2W  dosing, respectively. 
A waterfall plot  of percent change from baseline in calculated LDL-C at open-label extension week 12 
of 420 mg QM dosing and week 12  of 420  mg Q2W dosing for the 7 pediatric patients in  the TAS is 
provided in Figure 9.  For all but  1 subject, the LDL C reduction following Q2W dosing was equal to or 
greater than  the LDL-C reduction following QM dosing.  The results support the additional reduction in

Study 20110271  was a phase 2/3 open-label extension study designed to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, and efficacy of long-term administration  of evolocumab in subjects 12 -≤ 80  years of age 
with  HoFH  or severe FH (i.e., all those not meeting the protocol criteria for HoFH).  Non-apheresis 
subjects were required to have elevated LDL C (≥ 100 mg/dL  [2.6 mmol/L] for subjects with  diagnosed 
CHD or risk equivalent and ≥130  mg/dL [3.4  mmol/L] for subjects without  diagnosed CHD or risk 
equivalent). Two dose regimens were evaluated, i.e. evolocumab 420 mg QM and 420 mg Q2W. 
Subjects not on lipid apheresis at enrollment or within  the  prior 8 weeks initiated  treatment with 
evolocumab 420 mg QM, whereas subjects on lipid apheresis at enrollment initiated  treatment with 
evolocumab 420 mg Q2W.  Dose frequency changes (420  mg QM vs 420 mg Q2W) were permitted 
during the study if subjects met specific protocol criteria. Subjects with  < 5% LDL-C reduction from 
baseline and serum unbound  PCSK9 < 100  ng/mL could discontinue evolocumab.  If serum unbound 
PCSK9 was ≥ 100  ng/mL with  QM dosing, the subject could switch to  evolocumab 420 mg Q2W 
treatment if clinically indicated (e.g., LDL-C goals not met). Subjects on apheresis with ≥ 5%  LDL-C

reduction from baseline and serum unbound PCSK9 <  100 ng/mL with  Q2W treatment  could switch  to 
QM dosing. 
In Study 20110271,  14 adolescent subjects with  HoFH  were enrolled, of which 9 (64.3%)  men/boys 
and 5 (35.7%)  women/girls with  a median (Q1, Q3) age at baseline of 14.0  years. The median LCL-C 
levels at baseline were 9.10 mmol/L,  and all subjects were on moderate- (14.3%)  of high-intensity 
(85.7%)  statin therapy. Ten subjects were not on lipid apheresis at baseline, and 4  subjects received 
lipid apheresis at baseline. Three subjects discontinued  the study due to withdrawal consent. 
Evolocumab therapy resulted in a consistent LDL-C  lowering effect from the  start of the OLE study up 
to week 216  in pediatric subjects with  HoFH.  The  median (Q1, Q3) reductions from baseline in  LDL-C 
at weeks 48,  96, 144, 192,  and 216 were 13.3%, 8.1%,  8.7%, 9.5%,  and 20.0%, respectively. To 
note, efficacy data at week 216  was available for 9 adolescent subjects with  HoFH  (n=2 apheresis and  
n=7 non-apheresis). These findings with  respect to LDL-C  lowering were consistent with  the median 
LDL-C reductions of 12.2%, 14.5%,  and 14.3% at  week 12, 48 and 80,  respectively, observed in HoFH 
subjects age 10-18  years in Study 20120124.   
In Study 20110271,  there were no subjects with a measurement at week 84 for receptor negative, 
7 subjects with  receptor defective, and 3 subjects with  receptor unclassified. The efficacy results 
according to  LRLR mutation demonstrated that  treatment with  evolocumab leads to a reduction in LDL-
C levels in patients with  LDLR defective and unclassified mutation. However, within  each subgroup of 
LDLR mutation  there was a large degree of intersubject variability including  non-responders which, 
however, were in  the minority.   
As already described above, two different dose regimens were allowed in this  study. Pediatric subjects 
who started this  study receiving evolocumab 420 mg QM could change their dose to 420 mg Q2W if 
insufficient suppression of PCSK9 (> 100 ng/mL)  was observed at week 12  or 24.  In this  study, the 
titration  analysis set (TAS), defined as the subset of subjects who were exposed to evolocumab 420 
mg QM for at least 12 weeks and then to evolocumab 420  mg Q2W  for at least 12 weeks, showed that 
increasing the  frequency of the evolocumab 420  mg dose from QM  to Q2W resulted in an additional 
mean LDL-C  reduction of 10.0%  corresponding to a mean absolute reduction of 28.3 mg/dL. 
Considering that  in Study 20120124,  the  median LDL-C reduction was comparable between the HoFH 
subjects 10 - ≤11 years of age and the overall pediatric HoFH  population, it can be anticipated that   
increasing the  frequency of the evolocumab 420  mg dose from QM  to Q2W in HoFH  subjects 10 - ≤11 
years of age results in a comparable additional mean LDL-C reduction of 10%. Previously, secondary 
prevention LDL-C  lowering trials have shown  that reduction of 38.7 mg/dL  (1 mmol/L) in LDL-C is 
associated with  a 22% reduction in the 5-year incidence of major coronary events, revascularizations, 
and ischemic strokes (Cholesterol Treatment Trialists’ Collaboration [CTTC], 2010). Based on above, 
this additional  mean absolute reduction of 28.3  mg/dL upon increasing the frequency of the  420 mg 
dose to  Q2W can be considered clinically relevant, particularly in pediatric HoFH  subjects which are at 
high cardiovascular risk. 
Similarly, as in Study 20120123  and 20120124,  the findings  of LDL-C lowering effect were supported 
by beneficial effects observed for other lipid  parameters in, e.g. non-HDL-C,  ApoB, Total 
cholesterol/HDL-C ratio and ApoB/ApoA1 ratio.  
Since the  current application concerns extension of the indication to include pediatric patients with 
HoFH  10-≤11  years of age and Study 20110271  only enrolled pediatric HoFH  patients of 12 years and 
over (in line with  the inclusion criteria), this study is only considered supportive.

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Based on the initial  MAA in 2015, evolocumab is indicated in adult  patients with  primary 
hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia, including  those with HeFH.  Additionally, based on the 
same MAA, evolocumab is also approved for adults and adolescent patients aged 12 years and over 
with  HoFH.  The current extension of indication application concerns the inclusion  of pediatric HeFH 
patients aged 10 years and older and expanding the age range for the approved pediatric HoFH 
indication to  include pediatric patients  10-≤11 years of age. This extension of indication application is 
based on efficacy and safety data from the phase 3 Study 20120123  (HAUSER-RCT) and its ongoing 
phase 3  open-label extension Study 20120124  (HAUSER-OLE)  supplemented with data of the open-
label long-term Study 20110271.   
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Dose selection  
The approved dosing regimen for adults patients  with  HeFH  is 140  mg every 2 weeks (Q2W)  or 420  mg 
once monthly  (QM); both  doses are clinically equivalent. For adult  patients and adolescents aged 12 
years and over with HoFH,  the 420 mg QM and 420  mg Q2W are approved. The initial  recommended 
dose in  the HoFH  population is 420 mg QM,  which can be up-titrated  to 410  mg Q2W if a clinically 
meaningful response is not achieved. HoFH  patients on apheresis may initiate  treatment with  420  mg 
Q2M to  correspond with their apheresis schedule. Based on PK data in the initial  MAA, the approved 
420 SC QM regimen has been selected for the studies 20120123  and 20120124,  which evaluated the 
efficacy and safety of evolocumab in pediatric patients  from 10-≤17  years of age with  HeFH  or HoFH.   
Pharmacokinetic data from Study 20120123  and Study 20120124  confirmed that  mean serum 
evolocumab values of the 420 mg QM regimen in pediatric HeFH  and HoFH  subjects aged 10-≤17 
years were within  the range of values observed in adults with  HeFH  and non-apheresis pediatric 
subjects with HoFH  presented in the initial  marketing application. Additionally, efficacy and safety 
results of the 420 mg QM regimen observed in these studies were consistent with  those found in 
previous clinical studies in the evolocumab clinical program (see efficacy and safety section). 
Therefore, no changes to the approved evolocumab dosing regimens were proposed for the 
populations of pediatric HeFH  subjects aged 10-≤17  years and the HoFH  subjects aged 10-≤11 years, 
which are currently under review. However, in  Study 20120123  and 20120124,  only the  420 mg QM 
regimen has been evaluated, whereas in addition to  this regimen also the 140 mg Q2W regimen in 
pediatric HeFH  subjects aged 10-≤17  years and the 420  mg Q2W regimen in pediatric HoFH  subjects 
10-≤11  years are currently proposed (same regimens as those currently stated in the labelling for the 
approved HeFH  and HoFH  populations). As such, the efficacy and safety of the  140 mg Q2W dose 
regimen for pediatric HeFH  patients aged 10-≤17  years and the 420 mg Q2W dose regimen for 
pediatric HoFH  patients aged 10-≤11  years have not been evaluated. PK data have adequately shown 
that the PK is dose-linear and that  relative to primary hyperlipidaemia and mixed dyslipidemia, HeFH, 
HoFH  and age do not  have a clinically meaningful effect on the  PK profile of evolocumab. As such, the 
140 mg Q2W regimen, which is considered clinically equivalent to the  420 mg QM regimen proposed 
for pediatric HeFH  patients  aged 10-≤17  years, is considered acceptable. However, the 420  mg Q2W 
dose regimen proposed for HoFH  subjects 10-≤11  years of age concerns a 2-fold higher dose than the 
420 mg QM  regimen for which  the efficacy and safety in the proposed population  of pediatric HoFH 
patients aged 10-≤11  years are currently unknown. Despite similar PK across different types of FH  and 
age categories, the safety profile of the 420  mg Q2W regimen in the  pediatric patients  with HoFH  aged 
10-≤11  years can differ compared with the  adult population and the older pediatric HoFH  population of  
12-≤17  years for which this  dose regimen is currently already approved. The efficacy and safety of the

420 mg Q2W dose (together with  the 420 mg QM)  have only been evaluated in the adult  subjects with 
HoFH  or severe FH and in the older pediatric HoFH  population  of  12-≤17  years in Study 20110271.  In 
this study,  dose frequency changes (420  mg QM vs 420  mg Q2W) were permitted if a clinically 
meaningful response is not achieved. The titration  analysis set (TAS), defined as the  subset of subjects 
who were exposed to evolocumab 420  mg QM  for at least 12  weeks and then  to evolocumab 420 mg 
Q2W for at least 12 weeks, showed that increasing the frequency of the evolocumab 420 mg dose from 
QM to  Q2W resulted in an additional mean LDL-C reduction of 10.0% corresponding to a mean 
absolute reduction of 28.3  mg/dL.  Considering that in  Study 20120124,  the median LDL-C  reduction 
was comparable between the  HoFH  subjects 10  - ≤11 years of age and the  overall pediatric HoFH 
population, it  can be anticipated that   increasing the  frequency of the evolocumab 420  mg dose from 
QM to  Q2W in HoFH  subjects 10 - ≤11 years of age results in a comparable additional mean LDL-C 
reduction of 10%. Previously, secondary prevention LDL-C lowering trials have shown that  reduction of 
38.7  mg/dL (1 mmol/L) in LDL-C  is associated with a 22% reduction in the  5-year incidence of major 
coronary events, revascularizations, and ischemic strokes (Cholesterol Treatment Trialists’ 
Collaboration [CTTC], 2010).  Based on above this additional mean absolute reduction of 28.3  mg/dL 
upon increasing the  frequency of the 420  mg dose to Q2W can be considered clinically relevant, 
particularly in  pediatric HoFH  subjects which are at high cardiovascular risk. 
However, the  safety profile of the 420  mg Q2W dose in pediatric HoFH  subjects 10-≤11 years of age is 
still  unknown. The Applicant argued that in  Study 20120124  and Study 20110271  no unexpected 
safety concerns has been found. Additionally, none of the adverse events were related to growth, 
pubertal development, or hormonal status.  However, firm conclusion on growth  and pubertal 
development and hormonal status  can still not be made due to limited  sample size and treatment 
duration. Moreover, in Study 20120124,  only the 420  mg QM regimen has been evaluated, while in 
Study 20110271  both QM  and Q2W regimens has been evaluated but  only in HoFH  subjects 12-≤17 
years of age. In this context, an justification  in order to extrapolate these safety results to HoFH 
subjects aged 10-≤11 years of age receiving the Q2W  regimen has not been provided. Nevertheless, it 
is acknowledged that  the benefits of the additional  clinically relevant reduction in  LDL-C in HoFH 
subjects aged 10-≤11 years who are at  very high cardiovascular risk outweigh the adverse events 
observed in this HoFH  population  to date. 
Pediatric HeFH  population 
The evaluate the effect of evolocumab in pediatric HeFH  subjects aged 10 years and older, the  phase 3 
Study 20120123  (HAUSER-RCT) and its ongoing phase 3  open-label extension Study 20120124 
(HAUSER-OLE)  have been conducted. 
Study 20120123  is a 24-week double-blind,  randomized, placebo-controlled study in patients from 10-
≤ 17 years of age with  HeFH.  General inclusion criteria seem appropriate to reflect the patients for 
whom an indication is being sought. Eligible  subjects to be enrolled were male or female ≥10-≤17 
years of age at the time of randomization diagnosed with  HeFH  based on genetic testing  or following 
the clinical Broome criteria, the  Dutch Lipid Clinic Network and MEDPED with  LDL-C levels of ≥  3.4 
mmol/L at screening and receiving optimized background lipid-lowering  therapy for ≥ 4 weeks prior to 
screening. The design of the  RCT Study 20120123  is appropriated to  achieve the primary objective of 
the study. The duration of the screening period of a maximum of 8 weeks should be sufficient to 
establish a stable run-in  cholesterol level. The 24-week double-blind treatment period (evolocumab 
420mg SC QM or matching placebo SC QM, randomized 2:1)  is considered appropriate to provide 
reasonable results on the  LDL-C (and other cholesterol parameters) lowering effect of evolocumab. 
Each QM administration of investigational product (IP) consisted of 3 injections of 140 mg evolocumab 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report

or placebo in 1.0 mL (administration  by 3  AI/Pens). The primary endpoint  of percent change from 
baseline to week 24 in LDL-C is considered appropriate to establish the  LDL-C lowering effect of 
evolocumab. Key secondary endpoints evaluation of other lipid parameters (i.e., non-HDL-C, ApoB, 
total cholesterol/HDL-C ratio, ApoB/ApoA1 ratio) are considered appropriate to provide further insight 
on the overall lipid profile and confirmation of the primary objective. The sample size calculation, 
randomization and blinding  procedures are acceptable. With  respect to statistical  analysis, the 
definition of the analysis population  is considered standard and acceptable. The primary and secondary 
analyses will be performed with a linear effects model, and missing values are not imputed. This is in 
line with  the PIP (EMEA-001268-PIP01-12)  and thus acceptable. 
Study 20120124  is an open-label, single-arm extension study in patients  from 10-≤17  years of age 
with  HeFH  or HoFH.  Pediatric patients with  HeFH  who completed the parent study 20120123  and did 
not experience treatment-related adverse events were eligible to  enrol in this  OLE study. Additionally, 
de-novo pediatric patients aged 10-≤17  years with a diagnosis of HoFH  were eligible to  enrol in this 
OLE study. HoFH  was diagnosed by genetic confirmation or by clinical diagnosis based on a history of 
an untreated LDL-C concentration greater than 500  mg/dL (13 mmol/L)  together with  either xanthoma 
before 10 years of age or evidence of HeFH  in both  parents. All subjects received evolocumab 420 mg 
SC QM using either 3 AI/Pen injections or 1  automated mini-doser (AMD) administration. The design 
and the treatment duration of 80 weeks of this  OLE study is appropriate to achieve the primary 
objective of the study to characterize the safety and tolerability of long-term administration of 
evolocumab among pediatric patients with  HeFH  or HoFH.  The key secondary objective was to 
characterize the efficacy of long-term administration  of evolocumab as assessed by LDL-C and other 
lipid parameters. 
Pediatric HoFH  population 
Expanding the HoFH  age range to include pediatric patients 10-≤11 years of age is based on the 
interim results of the ongoing OLE Study 20120124  supplemented with Study 20110271. 
The design of OLE Study 20120124  has already been described above.  
Interim data from Study 20110271,  along with  data from the parent Study 20110233,  was presented 
in the initial  MAA for evolocumab supporting the  approval of the indication  in adults and pediatric (12 
years and over) subjects with  HoFH.  Subsequently, the final results from Study 20110271  have been 
submitted  and assessed during a Type II variation application procedure in 2019 
(EMEA/H/C/003766/II/0031).  In the  current extension procedure, the focus primarily lies on the data 
of pediatric subjects with  HoFH  from the final analysis of Study 20110271.   
Study 20110271  was a phase 2/3 open-label extension study to characterize the safety, tolerability, 
and efficacy of long-term administration  of evolocumab in subjects 12 -≤ 80  years of age with HoFH  or 
severe FH (i.e., all those not  meeting the  protocol criteria for HoFH).   Non-apheresis subjects were 
required to have elevated LDL C (≥ 100 mg/dL  [2.6 mmol/L] for subjects with  diagnosed CHD or risk 
equivalent and ≥130  mg/dL [3.4  mmol/L] for subjects without  diagnosed CHD or risk equivalent). Two 
dose regimens were evaluated, i.e. evolocumab 420 mg QM and 420  mg Q2W. Subjects not  on lipid 
apheresis at enrollment or within  the  prior 8 weeks initiated  treatment with  evolocumab 420 mg QM, 
whereas subjects on lipid apheresis at enrollment initiated treatment  with evolocumab 420  mg Q2W. 
Dose frequency changes (420  mg QM vs 420  mg Q2W) were permitted during  the study if subjects 
met specific protocol criteria. Subjects with  < 5% LDL-C reduction from baseline and serum unbound 
PCSK9 < 100  ng/mL could discontinue evolocumab.  If serum unbound PCSK9 was ≥  100 ng/mL with 
QM dosing, the subject could switch  to evolocumab 420 mg Q2W treatment, if clinically indicated (e.g., 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/572365/2021

LDL-C goals not met).  Subjects on apheresis with ≥ 5%  LDL-C reduction from baseline and serum 
unbound PCSK9 < 100 ng/mL with  Q2W treatment  could switch to QM  dosing. The primary objective of 
this study was to characterize the safety and tolerability of long-term administration  of evolocumab 
among pediatric patients  with HoFH.  The key secondary objective was to characterize the efficacy of 
long-term administration of evolocumab as assessed by LDL-C and other lipid  parameters. 
Since the  application under review concerns extension of the indication to  include pediatric patients 
with  HoFH  10-≤11 years of age and Study 20110271  only enrolled pediatric HoFH  patients of 12 years 
and over (in line with  the inclusion criteria), this study is only considered supportive. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
Pediatric HeFH  population 
In the RCT Study 20120123,  157 subjects were enrolled and received at least one dose of IP (104 and 
53 subjects in the evolocumab and placebo group, respectively). The percentage of subjects who 
completed the study was high and similar between the evolocumab and placebo group (99.0%  and 
100.0%,  respectively). Discontinuations due to an adverse event occurred in only one subject treated 
with  evolocumab, which is reassuring. With  respect to protocol deviations, the percentage of important 
protocol deviations were relatively low (7.0%)  and were not  considered to impact data interpretation. 
The study was multicentre and recruited patients across the  globe, with  more than  half of the subjects 
(65.8%)  from Europe, which is sufficiently representative for Europe.  
Overall baseline data, including  those on co-medications, distribution  of Tanner staging and risk 
factors, and stratification  factors, are well distributed across the two  treatment groups. The study 
population can be considered representative of a pediatric HeFH  population.  HeFH  diagnosis was 
sufficiently established as the diagnosis was for a large part of the population by genetic testing 
(66%).  Thirty-nine (24.7%)  subjects were children 10-≤11  years of age, and 119 (75.3%)  were 
adolescents between 12-≤17 years of age. Moreover, the elevated mean LDL-C baseline value of 4.8 
mmol/L reasonably corresponds to an LDL-C level generally observed within an adult HeFH  population. 
All subjects received statin  therapy, except for one subject in  the placebo group who took only 
ezetimibe. The majority (79%) of subjects were on moderate- or high-intensity  statins at baseline, and 
20% were on low-intensity statins. 
In the primary efficacy analysis, treatment with  evolocumab resulted in a substantial  decrease in LDL-
C at week 24 of 44%   with  an absolute mean change in LDL-C of 2.1 mmol/L (4.8  mmol/L at baseline 
and 2.7 mmol/L at week 24). The treatment difference between evolocumab and placebo was 38.3% 
(p<0.001).  The effect size in LDL-C lowering of 38.3% observed in this  RCT study in pediatric subjects 
with  HeFH  was lower than  the LDL-C lowering effect of 60% observed in adults with  HeFH  in the 
RUTHERFORD study (Study 20110117)  and other previous clinical studies (range: 60-70%)  submitted 
during the initial  MAA. There is no clear biological or pharmacokinetic explanation for this  discrepant 
effect across the paediatric and adult HeFH  population,  although higher baseline LDL-C  values in  the 
pediatric population could be one possible reason for the lower treatment effect size in the  paediatric 
population. Nevertheless, the  LDL-C lowering effect in the pediatric HeFH  population is still  considered 
substantial and clinically relevant. Primary endpoint analyses were supported by the secondary 
endpoint analysis showing  significant reductions in e.g. non-HDL-C (-35.04%),  ApoB (-32.47%),  total 
cholesterol/HDL-C ratio (-30.30%)  and ApoB/ApoA1 ratio (-36.38%). 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/572365/2021  
Page 83/131 
 
 
 
Further, the  LDL-C lowering effect already started at week 12 and was maintained up to 104  weeks of 
treatment as demonstrated in  the OLE Study 20120124  (discussed hereafter). Moreover, the effect 
appears generally consistent among several subgroups, including gender, race, age, region, baseline 
LDL-C values, statin  intensity,  and baseline PCSK9.  
Almost all patients from Study 20120123,  i.e. 150 out of 157 patients,  rolled over to  the OLE Study 
20120124,  of which 101  subjects received evolocumab in the parent study and 49 subjects received 
placebo. At the  data cut-off,  already a high  proportion of HeFH  patients (70.0%)  completed the study 
and 28.0 % HeFH  were still participating  the study. At the data cut-off,  the percentage of HeFH 
patients who discontinued  the study was relatively low (2.0%, n=3);   all discontinued due to 
withdrawal of consent from the study, which is reassuring. Evolocumab therapy resulted in a consistent 
LDL-C lowering effect from the start of the OLE  study up to week 80 in  pediatric HeFH  subjects aged 
10-≤17  years of age. For the HeFH  subjects randomized to evolocumab treatment in the  parent study, 
the reductions in LDL-C were maintained through week 80,  thereby demonstrating maintenance of 
effect over a period of 2 years (104  weeks across both studies). The HeFH  subjects randomized to 
placebo in the  parent study demonstrated LDL-C reductions by the  first time points of 12 weeks. 
Overall, the mean LDL-C reductions in the pediatric HeFH  subset were 44.4%,  40.6% and 36.3%  at 
week 12,  48 and 80, respectively. 
Carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT)  analysis showed small reductions in cIMT with  evolocumab 
therapy from baseline to week 24, 48, and 80 in  Study 20120123  and 20120124,  suggestive of a 
beneficial effect of evolocumab with respect to  atherogenesis. However, these results are too limited 
(short study period and small reduction) to draw firm conclusions.  
Pediatric HoFH  population 
Thirteen de-novo pediatric HoFH  patients aged 10-≤17  years were enrolled in the OLE  Study 
20120124.  At the  data cut-off,  these HoFH  patients either completed the  study (84.6%, n=11)  or 
discontinued the study (15.4%,  n=2;  withdrawal of consent and lost follow-up). Concerning baseline 
data, most of these pediatric HoFH  patients  were male (83.3%, n=10)  and white (75.0%,  n=9).   Six 
(46.2%)  patients were 10-≤11 years of age, and 7 (53.8%)  were between 12-≤  17 years of age. The 
number of HoFH  subjects aged 10-≤11 years who completed the  study (n=5) is limited,  however, 
acceptable considering the rarity of the disease. The mean LDL-C  at baseline was 10.3 mmol/L, and all 
the HoFH  patients  in this study had HoFH  diagnosis by genetic testing.  Furthermore, all HoFH  patients 
were on a statin  (100%) and ezetimibe (100%) therapy at baseline and none of the HoFH  subjects 
were receiving lipoprotein apheresis therapy. 
In Study 20120124,  treatment with  evolocumab resulted in  a consistent  LDL-C lowering effect from the 
start of the OLE study up to  week 80 in HoFH  subjects. The median LDL-C reductions were 12.2%, 
14.5%,  and 14.3% at week 12, 48 and 80, respectively. For the HoFH  subjects 10 - ≤11  years of age, 
the median LDL-C reduction was generally comparable with the overall pediatric HoFH  population 
(12.2%,  4.6% and 19.2%  at week 12, week 48 and week 80, respectively).  
The effect size in median LDL-C reduction of 12-14.5%  with  the 420  mg QM regimen observed in the 
overall pediatric HoFH  population in Study 20120124  appears somewhat lower than  those observed 
with  the 420 mg QM  regimen in the studies previously submitted,  i.e. Study 20110233  (TESLA) and 
Study 20110271  (TAUSSIG) in the overall HoFH  population  consisting adult and pediatric subjects 12 
years of age and over (32% and 16.3%,  respectively). However, the effect size was consistent with 
the median LDL-C reduction in the subset of the 14 adolescents HoFH  aged 12-≤17  from Study 
20110271  who received the 420 mg QM  regimen or the  (higher dose) 420 mg Q2W regimen (13.3%, 
8.1%,  8.7%, 9.5%,  and 20.0%  at weeks 48,  96, 144,  192, and 216, respectively). Although the 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/572365/2021  
Page 84/131 
 
 
 
 
pediatric HoFH  subjects showed a slightly less LDL-C lowering effect compared with  the overall HoFH 
population, the  LDL-C lowering effect in the pediatric patients is still  considered clinically relevant. The 
efficacy results according to LRLR mutation  (negative, defective, or unknown)  demonstrated that 
treatment with  evolocumab results in a reduction in  LDL-C levels regardless of the type of LDLR 
mutation.  However, within  each subgroup of LDLR mutation  there was a large degree of intersubject 
variability including  non-responders which, however, were in the minority.  In Study 20110271,  two 
different dose regiments were allowed in pediatric HoFH  subjects 12-≤  17 years of age. Pediatric 
subjects who started this study receiving evolocumab 420 mg QM  could change their dose to  420 mg 
Q2W if insufficient suppression of PCSK9 (> 100 ng/mL)  was observed at week 12  or 24.  In this  study, 
the titration  analysis set (TAS), defined as the subset of subjects who  were exposed to evolocumab 
420 mg QM  for at least 12 weeks and then  to evolocumab 420 mg Q2W for at least 12  weeks, showed 
that  increasing the frequency of the evolocumab 420 mg dose from QM to  Q2W resulted in an 
additional mean LDL-C reduction of 10.0%  corresponding to a mean absolute reduction of 28.3 mg/dL. 
Similarly, as previously found, the findings of the LDL-C lowering effect were supported by beneficial 
effects observed for the  other lipid parameters, non-HDL-C, ApoB, total  cholesterol/HDL-C ratio and 
ApoB/ApoA1 ratio in study 20120124  and 20110271.

2.3.5.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In conclusion, evolocumab demonstrated a substantial reduction in LDL-C and other lipid parameters 
on top of standard of care for both HoFH  and HeFH  patients  aged 10-≤17  years. The open-label 
extension studies provide data of maintenance of effect in the long term. As expected, LDL-C 
reductions were lower in HoFH  subjects compared with HeFH  subjects since the mechanism of action 
depends on the activity of the LDL  receptor.  
However, one uncertainty remain, which concerns the lack of confirmation of additional LDL-C 
reduction with  the higher evolocumab 420 mg Q2W regimen in HoFH  subjects aged 10 -≤11 years of 
age. However, considering that  the median LDL-C reduction with  the 420 mg QM dose regimen was 
comparable between the HoFH  subjects 10 - ≤11 years of age and the overall pediatric HoFH 
population in Study 20120124,  it can be anticipated  that  increasing the frequency of the  evolocumab 
420 mg dose from QM to  Q2W in HoFH  subjects 10 - ≤11 years of age results in a comparable 
additional mean LDL-C reduction of 10%,  which can be considered clinically relevant. 
2.4.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The focus of this safety section is pediatric safety data from the double-blind, randomized Study 
20120123  and its ongoing open-label extension Study 20120124  (Table 1).  Additional long-term 
safety data from 14 homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) pediatric subjects who

EMA/CHMP/572365/2021

participated in Study 20110271  is also included.  Because of considerable differences in study design, 
patient populations  enrolled, and study durations, safety data across studies were not  integrated. 
The safety analysis sets consisted of all subjects in the full  analysis set (FAS) who received at least 1 
dose of investigational product (evolocumab or placebo).  
The safety evaluation is primarily based on the on the double-blind, randomized Study 20120123  and 
its ongoing OLE study  2012014  and supplemented by safety data from the  phase 2/3 open-label 
extension Study 20110271,  which is appropriate. The safety data of the different studies were 
presented separately due to differences in study design and patient populations, which  is acceptable.  
Patient  exposure 
HeFH  subjects 
For pediatric HeFH  subjects in  Studies 20120123  and 20120124,  153 pediatric HeFH  subjects were 
administered evolocumab ((in  combination with standard of care), representing 249  patient years of 
exposure (Table 31).  Across these 2 studies, 149 (97.4%)  HeFH  subjects had evolocumab exposure 
≥  28  weeks (6.4  months), 135  (88.2%)  subjects had evolocumab exposure ≥ 52 weeks (12 months), 
and 76 (49.7%)  subjects had evolocumab exposure ≥ 96 weeks (22.1  months). 
In Study 20120123,  mean investigational product exposure was similar between the evolocumab (5.5 
months) and placebo (5.5  months) groups. Overall, 98 (94%)  subjects in  the evolocumab group and 
51 (96%)  subjects in the placebo group received all 6 doses of investigational product. Study exposure 
was also similar between the 2 treatment groups at 5.6 months  in the evolocumab group and 5.7 
months in the  placebo group.

HoFH  subjects 
In Study 20120124,  12 HoFH  subjects received at least 1  dose of 420 mg evolocumab QM.  One 
subject dropped out after 28 weeks, all other subjects have completed evolocumab dosing and have 
completed the study at week 80.  Median  evolocumab exposure was 18.4 months and median study 
exposure was 18.6  months; representing 17 total patient-years of exposure.  The corresponding 
durations in the 10-≤11  years of age subgroup were 16.608  (4.466)  and 16.756  (4.507) months, 
respectively and for the 12-≤17  years of age subgroup these were 18.382  (0.085) and 18.535 
(0.145)  months, respectively. As of the interim analysis data cutoff  (08 June 2020),  all subjects 
(100.0%)  had evolocumab exposure ≥ 28 weeks and 11 (91.7%)  had evolocumab exposure ≥ 72  weeks 
(Table 31).  
In Study 20110271,  14 pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age with  HoFH  received open-label 
evolocumab 420 mg for up to 5 years.  Ten subjects were not on lipid apheresis at enrollment or within 
the prior 8 weeks, initiated  treatment, and were dosed with 420  mg QM; 4 subjects were on lipid 
apheresis at enrollment and initiated treatment  with evolocumab 420  mg once every 2 weeks (Q2W).  
Exposure to evolocumab in pediatric subjects was 45.2  patient-years and the median (Q1, Q3) 
duration of exposure was 54.0  (9.2, 58.7)  months. 
Combined exposure for pediatric subjects with  HoFH  across Studies 20120124  and 20110271  was 62.2 
patient-years. 
In the initial  MA dossier, 5710 patients  (the majority were adult subjects) were exposed to evolocumab 
in > 25  clinical trials across broad patient populations, representing 5246 patient-years of exposure. 
With  the submission of the  cardiovascular outcome trial FOURIER, with a total  of 27525  adult  subjects 
and the GLAGOV study with  968 adult  subjects included, the overall exposure data from clinical studies 
has substantially increased although exposure in the FOURIER study was limited to  a median of 2.6 
years. Furthermore, it has been estimated that 748 312  patients (551 687 patient-years) have been 
exposed worldwide to evolocumab in the post-marketing setting (See section “Post-marketing 
experience).  So, there was a large safety experience with evolocumab, although the experience in 
pediatric patients was limited, however, increased based on the  safety data of Study 20120123  and 
20120124  currently under review. 
HeFH 
Across the RCT Study 20120123  and OLE Study 20120124,  a total of 153 pediatric HeFH  patients 
received at least 1  dose of evolocumab, with a total patient-year exposure of 249.  Of these patients, 
149 (97.4%),  135  (88.2%),  and 76 (49.7%)  HeFH  subjects were exposed to evolocumab for at least 
24, 48  and 96  weeks, respectively, which is considered sufficient.  More specifically, placebo-controlled 
safety data of pediatric HeFH  subjects who received all 6 doses of IP, i.e. 24  weeks of exposure, in the 
RCT Study 20120123  is available for 98 subjects (out of 104,  94%)  in the evolocumab group and 51 
(out of 53,   96%)  subjects in the placebo group.  
HoFH 
In the OLE Study 20120124,  12  de-novo pediatric HoFH  subjects 10-≤17  years of age received at least 
one dose of evolocumab, with a total  patient-year exposure of 17.  Of these patients,  all do-novo HoFH 
subjects (100.0%)  had evolocumab exposure ≥ 28 weeks, and 11  (91.7%) completed the study and, 
as such, were exposed to evolocumab for 80 weeks.  
Demographic data showed that  6 HoFH  subjects aged 10-≤11  years and 7 HoFH  subjects 12-≤17 
years were enrolled in  the OLE Study 20120124,  of which one subject never received IP, and one 
subject discontinued the study. However, the age of these two subjects has not been provided. Based 
on the above, it  can be concluded that  4-≤6   HoFH  subjects aged 10-≤11  years (for whom an 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/572365/2021  
Page 87/131 
 
 
 
indication is being sought)  received evolocumab for up to  80 weeks, which is considered limited  but 
expected and acceptable considering the  rarity of the HoFH  disease.   
In the OLE Study 20110271,  14  pediatric subjects 12 to 17  years of age with HoFH  received 
evolocumab for up to  5 years.  
Combined exposure for pediatric subjects with  HoFH  across Studies 20120124  and 20110271  was 62.2 
patient-years. 
Adverse events 
General  frequency of adverse  events 
HeFH  subjects 
The HeFH  subject incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of Studies 20120123  and 
20120124  are summarized in  Table 32 and Table 33, respectively.  
During Study 20120123,  64 (62%)  subjects in  the evolocumab group and 34 (64%)  subjects in the 
placebo group experienced at least 1 TEAE.  The majority of TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity 
(grade 1 and 2, respectively). The percentage of subjects with  serious adverse events (SAEs) and 
TEAEs leading to  discontinuation was both 1%  in the evolocumab group and 0%  in the placebo group, 
respectively.   
During Study 20120124,  100 (66.7%)  HeFH  subjects experienced at least 1 TEAE. Subject incidence of 
TEAEs was similar between HeFH  subjects receiving evolocumab (66.3%) or placebo (67.35)  in the 
parent study. The majority of TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. One (0.7%)  HeFH  subject 
experienced a SAE.

The HoFH  subject incidence of TEAEs of Studies 20120124  and 20110271  are summarized in Table 34 
and Table 35. 
In Study 20120124,  7 (58.3%)  HoFH  subjects experienced at least 1 TEAEs of which  the majority were 
mild or moderate in severity. SAEs were reported for 2 (16.7%)  HoFH  subjects and none of the 
subjects experienced AEs leading to  discontinuation of study drug.  
In Study 20110271,  12 (84.7%)  of the pediatric HoFH  subjects experienced at least 1 TEAE of which 
the majority were mild or moderate in severity. SAEs were reported for 4 (28.6%)  HoFH  subjects and 
1 (7.1%)  subject experienced AEs leading to discontinuation  of study drug.

Common TEAEs 
HeFH  subjects 
In Study 20120123,  the most commonly reported adverse event was nasopharyngitis (11.5%  in the 
evolocumab group versus 11.3%  in the placebo group), followed by headache (10.6%  vs 1.9%), 
gastroenteritis (4.8% vs 7.5%),  influenza (5.8%  vs 3.8%),  oropharyngeal pain (6.7%]  vs 0.0%), 
upper respiratory tract infection (5.8% vs 1.9%), pyrexia (2.9%  vs 5.7%),  and cough (1.9%  vs 5.7%) 
(Table 36). These adverse events were nonserious and mostly grade 1 or 2 (one event of headache 
was grade 3), and none led to discontinuation  of investigational product.

For HeFH  subjects in Study 20120124,  the most commonly reported AEs (reported in > 5% of subjects) 
nasopharyngitis (14.7%),  followed by headache (8.7%),  influenza-like illness (8.7%),  gastroenteritis 
(6.0%),  upper respiratory tract infection (5.3%),  and oropharyngeal pain (5.3%)  (Table 37). These 
events were nonserious and grade 1 or 2 in severity, with  the exception of a grade 3 serious adverse 
event of a headache.

HoFH  subjects 
In Study 20120124,  7 (58.3%)  HoFH  subjects experienced at least 1 TEAE. All adverse events 
occurred in only 1 subject except for epistaxis, which occurred in 2  (16.7%) subjects (Table 37).   
In the pediatric subjects of Study 20110271,  the most frequently reported adverse events (≥ 10%) 
were anxiety, migraine, and upper respiratory tract infection (21.4%  (n=3) each), and acne, increase 
in blood creatine phosphokinase, influenza, non-cardiac chest pain, rash, and urinary tract infection 
(14.3%  (n=2) each).  All other TEAE occurred in only 1 pediatric HoFH  subject each. 
HeFH 
In the RCT Study 20120123,  treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were frequently reported; 
however, the percentage of subjects with  TEAEs was slightly lower in the evolocumab group (61.5%) 
compared with  the placebo group (64.2%).   In the  OLE Study 20120124,  the percentage of  TEAEs 
was comparable between subjects who received evolocumab and placebo in  the parent study (67.3% 
vs 66.3%).   
In the RCT Study 20120123,  the most frequent AEs (>  5% of subjects) with  a higher incidence with 
evolocumab compared with placebo were nasopharyngitis (11.5%  vs 11.3%), headache (10.6%  vs 
1.9%),  oropharyngeal pain (6.7%  vs 0.0%),  influenza (5.8% vs 3.8%), upper respiratory tract 
infection (5.8%  vs 1.9%).  In the OLE Study 20120124,  the most frequent AEs (reported in > 5%  of 
subjects) were nasopharyngitis (14.7%),  headache (8.7%),  influenza-like illness (8.7%),  gastroenteritis 
(6.0%),  upper respiratory tract infection (5.3%),  and oropharyngeal pain (5.3%).   
The safety findings are consistent  with  the safety data observed in adults in the initial  MAA dossier and 
the FOURIER dossier, except for the disbalance in oropharyngeal pain. The TEAEs of oropharyngeal 
pain observed in HeFH  subjects in Study 20120123  (and 20120124)  were nonserious, mild  to 
moderate in severity and all considered not related to treatment with  evolocumab. 
HoFH 
In the OLE Study 20120124,  7 of the 12  (58.3%) HoFH  subjects experienced TEAEs. The reported 
TEAES occurred in  no more than 1 subject, with  the exception of epistaxis which occurred in 2 (16.7%) 
subjects.  
In the pediatric subset of the  OLE study 20110271,  12 of the 14  subjects (85.7%)  experienced TEAEs. 
The higher frequency of TEAEs compared with those observed for HeFH  subjects in Study 20120123 
and for the  HeFH  and HoFH  subjects in Study 20120123   can be explained by the longer (5-years) 
study duration of Study 20110271.  The most frequently reported adverse events (≥ 10%) in the 
pediatric subset of the  OLE study 20110271  were anxiety, migraine, and upper respiratory tract 
infection (21.4%  (n=3)  each), and acne, increase in blood creatine phosphokinase, influenza, non-

cardiac chest pain, rash, and urinary tract infection (14.3%  (n=2)  each).  All other TEAE occurred in 
only 1 pediatric HoFH  subject each. 
Device  related  TEAEs 
HeFH  subjects 
In Study 20120123,  3 (2.9%)  subjects in  the evolocumab group and 2 (3.8%)  subjects in the placebo 
group experienced an adverse event assessed as related to  the device; all of the events were 
consistent with  injection site reactions and all were mild in severity (Table 38). 
Table 38. Subject  incidence of device-related  adverse  events  by preferred term -  Study 
20120123 (full analysis set  - actual treatment) 
In Study 20120124,  a total of 11 (7.3%)  HeFH  subjects reported at least 1 device related AE. Most 
device related adverse events were mild in severity; 3 subjects experienced events of injection site 
pain, injection site reaction, and pyrexia which were moderate in severity (Table 39).

Table 39. Subject  incidence of device-related  treatment-emergent  adverse events  by 
preferred term – Study 20120124 (full analysis set – actual treatment)   
HoFH  subjects 
In Study 20120124,  one (8.3%) HoFH  subject reported 1  device-related adverse event of nausea and 
injection site hemmorrhage which were mild  in severity (Table 39). In Study 20110271,  no subjects 
reported a device-related adverse event. 
Overall, these findings in pediatric subjects with HeFH  and HoFH  are consistent with  those observed in 
the initial  MA dossier and the FOURIER dossier.  
Treatment  related TEAEs 
Overall, most treatment-related events were reported in 1 subject in either group, and most 
treatment-related adverse events in these 3 studies were known adverse drug reactions with 
evolocumab. 
In Study 20120123  (HeFH  subjects only) (Table  40), treatment-related adverse events were reported 
for 11 (10.6%)  subjects in the evolocumab group and 4 (7.5%)  subjects in the placebo group.  Most 
related adverse events were reported for 1  subject in  either group, except for injection site pain 
(2 [1.9%]  subjects in the evolocumab group, 1 [1.9%]  subject in the placebo group). 
In open-label extension Study 20120124  (Table 41), among subjects with  HeFH,  treatment-related 
adverse events were reported for 10 (6.7%)  subjects overall.  Most related events were reported for 
1 subject each, except for injection site erythema (4  [2.7%]  subjects), injection  site pain (2  [1.3%]), 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report

and injection site swelling (2 [1.3%]).   Among subjects with HoFH,  treatment-related adverse events 
were reported for 2 (16.7%)  subjects, and these events were nausea (1 [8.3%])  and epistaxis (1 
[8.3%]). 
In open-label extension Study 20110271  (HoFH  subjects) (Table 42), treatment-related adverse 
events were reported for 1 pediatric subject, and these events were rash and urticaria.

Treatment related TEAEs in pediatric subjects with  HeFH  and HoFH  are consistent  with  those observed 
in the initial  MA dossier and the FOURIER dossier. No  new treatment related TEAEs have been 
identified, which  is reassuring. Most of the TEAEs considered related to IP were injections site 
reactions, which  is a known ADR of evolocumab. 
Adverse events  of special interest  
Adverse events associated with  other injectable protein therapies (i.e., potential hypersensitivity 
events and potential  injection site reactions) were evaluated using narrow and broad Standard 
MedDRA Queries (SMQs).  An assessment of potential  neurocognitive adverse events using high level 
group terms was also carried out in Study 20120123  and Study 20120124.  These search strategies are 
used to contribute to signal detection in  retrieving any type of adverse event cases (MedDRA preferred 
terms) potentially related to  the condition under review when heterogeneous medical presentations 
may be expected.  
Potential hypersensitivity and potential  injection site reactions 
HeFH  subjects 
In Study 20120123,  potential hypersensitivity events, which are ADRs with evolocumab, occurred in a 
higher percentage of evolocumab subjects (4 [3.8%]  narrow SMQ; 7  [6.7%] broad SMQ) than placebo 
subjects (0% for both narrow and broad SMQ); the reported events were all nonserious and mild or 
moderate in severity.  Using the  narrow search strategy for potential  hypersensitivity events, 4 
subjects in the evolocumab group experienced events of hypersensitivity (1),  allergic dermatitis (2), 
and injection site urticaria (1); the reported events were all nonserious and grade 1 or 2. No  placebo 
subject experienced a potential hypersensitivity event.  
The overall subject incidence of potential injection site reactions was similar between the evolocumab 
(5 subjects [4.8%]  using both narrow and broad SMQ) and placebo (3 subjects [5.7%] using  both 
narrow and broad SMQ) treatment groups.  
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/572365/2021  
Page 99/131 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In Study 20120124,  potential hypersensitivity events occurred in 6 (4.0%)  subjects using the narrow 
SMQ and 11 (7.3%)  subjects using the broad SMQ.  Potential  injection site reaction events occurred in 
13 (8.7%)  subjects using both the  narrow and broad AMQ.  All potential  hypersensitivity and injection 
site reaction events were nonserious and mild  or moderate in severity.   
HoFH  subjects 
In Study 20120124,  no potential hypersensitivity events were noted and only 1 (8.3%)  subject had a 
potential injection site  reaction (nonserious, grade 1 injection site haemorrhage).   
In Study 20110271,  2 (14.3%)  pediatric HoFH  subjects reported a potential hypersensitivity event 
using the narrow SMQ. One of these subjects had a grade 3 nonserious adverse event of rash leading 
to discontinuation  of evolocumab. No pediatric subject in this  study had a potential  injection site 
reaction event.   
There were no events of potential injection site reaction in Study 20110271  and no events of 
hypersensitivity in Study 20120124  reported.  
HeFH  subjects 
In the RCT Study 20120123,  a higher incidence of hypersensitivity was observed in the evolocumab 
group (3.8% and 6.7%  using narrow and broad SMQ, respectively) compared with  the placebo group 
(0% using both  narrow and broad SMQ).  In contrast,  a lower incidence in  potential injection site 
reactions was observed in the evolocumab group (4.8% using both  broad and narrow SMQ) compared 
with  the placebo group (5.7%  using both broad and narrow SMQ). The incidence of hypersensitivity 
(4.0%  and 7.3%  using narrow and broad SMQ) observed in the  OLE Study 20120124  was comparable 
with  that observed in the RCT study. The incidence in injection  site reaction events of 8.7%  (using 
both the  narrow and broad SMQ) in the  OLE Study 20120124  was slightly higher than the RCT Study, 
which can be explained by the  longer study duration the OLE  study.  
Anti-evolocumab antibodies 
Across all included studies (20120123,  20120124,  and 20110271),  no subject receiving evolocumab 
had baseline or postbaseline anti-evolocumab binding  antibodies detected at  any time point  during the 
study. 
Neurocognitive adverse events 
HeFH  subjects 
In Study 20120123,  the subject incidence of potential  neurocognitive events was also similar between 
the evolocumab (1 subject [1.0%])  and placebo (0 subjects [0.0%]) groups. 
In Study 20120124,  five HeFH  subjects in this  study had potential  neurocognitive events of attention 
deficit hyperactivity disorder (4),  amnesia (1), and disturbance in attention  (1).  All events were 
nonserious, mild or moderate in severity, and considered unrelated to evolocumab by the  investigator.   
HoFH  subjects 
In Study 20120124,  one (8.3%) subject had a potential neurocognitive event (nonserious, grade 2 
attention  deficit hyperactivity disorder); the  subject had pre-existing ADHD. 
Cogstate Cognitive Battery of neurological tests 
Results of the Cogstate Cognitive Battery of neurological tests assessed in Study 20120123  in Study 
20120124  did not  reveal any trends indicative of a treatment effect of evolocumab on cognition in 
these subjects.  This was also true when the results were summarized by age (<14  years and ≥ 14 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report

Page 100/131 
 
 
 
years).  Findings  from neurological physical examinations in each study also did not reveal any 
clinically relevant abnormalities. 
Specific attention  has been given to neurocognitive abnormalities, as very low LDL-C levels have been 
associated with  increased risk of neurocognitive abnormalities, although this  was not  observed in the 
initially submitted  dossier and in a subset of the  FOURIER study (EBBINGHAUS subset). 
Six pediatric HeFH  subjects (1 subject in the evolocumab group of the  RCT Study 20120123  and 4 
subjects in the OLE Study 20120124),  and one HoFH  subject (OLE Study 2012024)  experienced 
potential neurocognitive events. Overall, the data are considered limited, which precludes appropriate 
assessment. 
Additionally, the Cogstate Cognitive Battery of neurological tests assessed in Study 20120123  in Study 
20120124  also did not reveal any clinically relevant abnormalities. 
Muscle adverse events 
Muscle adverse events were evaluated using  narrow and broad Standardized MedDRA Queries (SMQs) 
for rhabdomyolysis/myopathy events.  Overall, no noteworthy findings were observed in the few 
muscle adverse events that were reported. 
HeFH  subjects 
In Study 20120123,  no muscle adverse events were found using the narrow search terms.  Muscle 
adverse events using broad search terms were reported for 2 (1.9%)  subjects in the evolocumab 420 
mg QM group (1 [1.0%]  subject had musculoskeletal pain, 1 [1.0%]  subject had blood creatine 
phosphokinase increased), and 2 (3.8%)  subjects in the placebo group (1 [1.9%]  subject had myalgia, 
2 [3.8%]  subjects had blood creatine phosphokinase increased).  No subject had a postbaseline 
creatine kinase (CK) elevation > 5 x upper limit  normal (ULN). 
In Study 20120124,  myopathy (2  [1.3%] subjects) was the only muscle adverse event found using 
narrow search terms; both  events were nonserious and considered unrelated to evolocumab by the 
investigator, and neither led to  discontinuation of evolocumab.  Muscle adverse events using broad 
search terms were reported for 10 (6.7%)  subjects overall.  Most of these events were reported for 
1 subject each, except for myalgia (5 [3.3%]),  myopathy (2 [1.3%]),  and blood creatine phosphokinase 
increased (2 [1.3%]).   Two (1.6%)  HeFH  subjects with  normal CK at baseline had a postbaseline CK 
value that  was > 5 x ULN,  including 1 (0.8%)  subject with  a postbaseline CK value that was > 10  x ULN.   
Of these 2 subjects, 1  subject with  CK > 5 x ULN at  week 12 had no reported etiology for the elevation, 
and when queried, the  investigator reported that the  CK increase was not clinically significant and did 
not meet the definition  of an adverse event.  The second subject had CK > 10 x ULN at  week 12, and 
per the  investigator the  CK increase was sports-related and did not meet the definition  of an adverse 
event.  Both subjects had normal CK values at  their next scheduled assessment 
HoFH  subjects 
In Study 20120124,  no muscle events were found using narrow search terms, and myositis was 
reported for 1 (8.3%)  subject using the broad search terms. Two (18.2%)  HoFH  subjects with  normal 
baseline CK had at least 1 postbaseline CK value that  was > 5 x ULN;  of these, 1 subject reported a 
muscle adverse event of myositis, which was attributed  by the investigator to a concomitant  upper 
respiratory tract infection and considered unrelated to evolocumab.  No HoFH  subjects had a 
postbaseline CK value > 10  x ULN.

In Study 20110271,  among pediatric subjects with  HoFH,  no muscle adverse events were found using 
the narrow search terms.  Muscle  adverse events using broad search terms were reported for 2 
(14.3%)  subjects, both of whom had blood creatine phosphokinase increased.  Of these 2 subjects, one 
had CK >  10 x ULN  at week 36 and week 108;  in both instances, the subject had engaged in vigorous 
exercise before the study  visit/blood draw.  A nonserious Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) grade 1 adverse event of increased blood creatine phosphokinase was reported at  the 
week 36 visit;  the event resolved after 11 days and was considered unrelated to  evolocumab by the 
investigator.  The second subject had CK elevations at week 36 (> 10 x ULN),  week 48  (> 5 x ULN), 
and week 132 (>  10 x ULN).   Nonserious, CTCAE grade 1 treatment-emergent adverse events of 
increased blood creatine phosphokinase were reported at the week 36 and week 48  visits; the events 
resolved after 11 and 10  days, respectively.  The subject had engaged in vigorous exercise prior to the 
week 36 and week 48 study visit/blood draw and both  events were considered unrelated to 
evolocumab by the  investigator.  At week 132, the subject reported feeling well with  no muscle 
symptoms, and the  CK elevation was considered not  clinically significant  by the investigator; no 
adverse event was reported.  No other HoFH  subjects with  normal CK values at baseline had CK 
> 5 x ULN  at any postbaseline visit. 
Hepatic adverse events 
Hepatic adverse events were evaluated using narrow and broad SMQs for drug-related hepatic 
disorders events.  Overall, no noteworthy findings  were observed in the few hepatic adverse events 
that  were reported, which  is consistent with  the full dataset available for evolocumab.. 
HeFH  subjects 
In Study 20120123,  there were no reported drug-related hepatic disorders events among subjects in 
the evolocumab treatment group, while 2 (3.8%)  subjects in the placebo group had such events (1 
[1.9%]  subject had jaundice, 1 [1.9%]  subject had alanine aminotransferase increased), using both 
narrow and broad search terms.  One (1.0%)  evolocumab subject with normal total bilirubin  at baseline 
had postbaseline total  bilirubin > 2 x ULN.   No subject had alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) > 3 x ULN  at any time during the  study. 
In Study 20120124,  a drug-related hepatic disorders adverse event using narrow and broad search 
terms was reported for 1 (0.7%)  subject with  HeFH  who had blood bilirubin increased; this subject was 
subsequently diagnosed with  Gilbert’s syndrome.  In HeFH  subjects with  normal total  bilirubin at 
baseline, 2 (1.4%)  subjects had postbaseline total  bilirubin > 2 x ULN,  including the  subject who 
reported an adverse event of blood bilirubin increased.  No HeFH  subject with  normal ALT and AST at 
baseline had a postbaseline ALT or AST > 3 x ULN.    
HoFH  subjects 
In Study 20120124,  there were no events of drug-related hepatic disorders using either narrow or 
broad search strategies.  No HoFH  subjects with  normal total  bilirubin at baseline had total bilirubin > 
2 x ULN  at any time during the  study, and no HoFH  subject had ALT or AST > 3 x ULN  at any time 
during the study. 
In Study 20110271,  a drug-related hepatic disorders adverse event using narrow and broad search 
terms was reported for 1 (7.1%)  pediatric subject with HoFH  who had an abnormal liver function test.   
One (7.1%) subject had a postbaseline ALT or AST > 5 x ULN  and 1 (7.1%)  subject had total bilirubin 
> 2 x ULN.

Adverse events in subject who achieved LDL-C<  40 mg/dL)  (<1.0 mmol/L). 
Few subjects in Studies 20120123,  20120124,  and 20110271  achieved LDL-C values < 40 mg/dL, 
given their high LDL-C values at baseline.  No new safety concerns were identified based on the review 
of safety data for the 4 subjects with  low LDL-C values who had an adverse event.  The most 
frequently reported adverse events, presented below for each study, were generally consistent with 
the known adverse drug reactions for evolocumab, as described in the product labeling, and related 
symptoms (ie, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection). 
HeFH  subjects 
In Study 20120123,  no treatment-emergent adverse events were reported among subjects in  the 
evolocumab group who  achieved LDL-C < 40 mg/dL.  Among subjects who  achieved LDL-C ≥ 40 mg/dL, 
59 (61.5%)  in  the evolocumab group and 34 (64.2%)  in  the placebo group had at least 1  adverse 
event. 
In Study 20120124,  4 subjects with  HeFH  who achieved LDL-C < 40 mg/dL had a treatment-emergent 
adverse event, including  contusion, nasopharyngitis, depression, anxiety, dermatitis allergic, which 
were reported for 1 subject each; the 1 subject with the  contusion adverse event achieved LDL-C 
< 25 mg/dL.   Among those who achieved LDL-C ≥ 40  mg/dL, 94 (65.7%)  subjects had an adverse 
event.   
HoFH  subjects 
In Study 20120124,  no subjects with HoFH  achieved LDL-C <  40 mg/dL, and among those who 
achieved ≥ 40 mg/dL,  7 (58.3%)  subjects had at least 1 adverse event. 
In Study 20110271,  no subjects with HoFH  achieved LDL-C <  40 mg/dL.  Among those who achieved 
LDL-C > 40  mg/dL, treatment-emergent adverse events were reported for 2 (50.0%)  subjects with 
apheresis and 10 (100.0%)  subjects without  apheresis at enrollment. 
There is no evidence of an unexpected safety concern regarding muscle adverse events, hepatic events 
and adverse events in subjects who achieved low LDL-C levels. These findings are consistent with  the 
full dataset available for evolocumab. Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse  event

In Study 20120123,  1 (1.0%)  subject in the evolocumab group experienced a serious adverse event of 
cholelithiasis, which was not considered related to investigational product by the investigator.  No 
subject in the placebo group experienced either a serious adverse event. 
In Study 20120124,  SAEs were reported for 4  (2.7%) HeFH  subjects (wrist fracture, headache,  
perforated appendicitis and peritonitis, and anorexia nervosa) of which  none were considered related 
to study drug.  
Moreover, none of the  SAEs, which included an event of cholelithiasis, wrist  fracture, headache, 
perforated appendicitis and peritonitis, and anorexia nervosa, occurred in more than one subject, and 
none was considered related to IP. 
HoFH 
In Study 20120124,  SAEs were reported for 2  (16.7%)  HoFH  subjects (appendicitis  and arteriovenous 
fistula aneurysm) which  were considered not related to study drug.

In Study 20110271,  SAEs were reported for 4  (28.6%) HoFH  subjects including  3 subjects with  1 
event each of pleuritic pain, coronary artery occlusion, and ovarian germ cell teratoma, and 1 subject 
with  4 serious adverse events (non-cardiac chest pain, appendicitis, aortic stenosis, and 
nephrolithiasis). None of these SAEs were considered related to study drug.  
Deaths 
There were no fatal adverse events among pediatric subjects in Studies 20120123,  20120124,  and 
20110271.   
Other  significant events 
Events of death by any cause, cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable 
angina, coronary revascularization, stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), and hospitalization for 
heart failure were adjudicated by an independent CEC in  Study 20120123  and Study 20110271.   These 
events were not adjudicated in open-label Study 20120124.   Across the 2 studies  where these events 
were adjudicated, no pediatric subject had a positively adjudicated cardiovascular endpoint adverse 
event. 
Laboratory findings 
Clinical Laboratory abnormalities 
HeFH  subjects 
In Study 20120123,  laboratory values that  shifted from baseline grades 0, 1, or 2 to postbaseline 
grades 3 or 4 were single occurrences with the  exception of uric acid which occurred more frequently 
in the evolocumab group.  No subject experienced a grade 4 laboratory toxicity.  For uric acid, 7 
(6.7%)  subjects in  the evolocumab group and 2 (3.8%)  subjects in  the placebo group experienced 
shifts from baseline grade 0 to  postbaseline grade 3.  One placebo subject had an associated adverse 
event of increased uric acid reported; no other adverse events associated with  increases uric acid were 
reported. 
Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and fasting blood glucose values were similar between treatment groups at 
baseline and remained overall unchanged throughout  the study.  Shifts in hsCRP from baseline to 
maximum postbaseline were generally similar between the  evolocumab and placebo groups.  In each 
treatment group, there was little change in the percentage of subjects within  each grade category at 
baseline and postbaseline; a reduction in the  proportion of subjects with  postbaseline hsCRP >  3 mg/L, 
compared with  baseline, was observed in both treatment groups. 
No evidence of an impact of evolocumab on steroid hormone biosynthesis was observed; changes from 
baseline to week 24 were minimal in both  groups and not  clinically meaningful. 
A review of vitamin  assessments did not reveal any clinically significant impact of evolocumab on these 
parameters.  Vitamin A and vitamin D concentrations were similar between the treatment groups at 
baseline and at week 24.   Vitamin E concentrations at baseline were similar between the evolocumab 
and placebo groups.  As expected, a reduction in total  vitamin E over time was observed in the 
evolocumab group compared with  the placebo group; vitamin E plasma concentrations decreased as 
the concentrations of lipoproteins transporting vitamin E decreased.  While some variation in vitamin K 
concentrations between the treatment groups was observed, these seemed to be driven by outliers; 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report

median concentrations of vitamin K were similar between the treatment groups at baseline and at 
week 24. 
After review of all available data, no trends indicative of clinically important treatment  related 
laboratory abnormalities were observed with evolocumab in this study. 
In Study 20120124,  laboratory values that  shifted from baseline grades 0, 1, or 2 to postbaseline 
grades 3 or 4 were largely single occurrences with the  exception of creatine kinase (CK) and total 
cholesterol.  For CK, 1 subject had a shift from baseline grade 0 to grade 3  and 1  subject had a shift 
from baseline grade 0 to grade 4; in both subjects the CK shift was transient and there were no 
relevant adverse events reported.  For total  cholesterol, 1 subject had a shift from baseline grade 2 to 
grade 3 and 1 subject had a shift from baseline grade 1 to grade 3.  No other grade 4 laboratory 
toxicities occurred. 
In general, HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, and hsCRP values remained unchanged throughout  the 
study.  Changes in  steroid hormones from baseline to week 80 were minimal and/or not clinically 
meaningful.  This included assessments of estradiol in females, testosterone in male subjects, cortisol, 
luteinizing  hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and follicle 
stimulating  hormone. 
A review of vitamin  assessments did not reveal any clinically significant impact of evolocumab on these 
parameters.  Vitamin A, vitamin D, and vitamin E concentrations were similar at baseline and at week 
80.  Some variation in vitamin K concentrations were noted at week 80  (median [Q1,  Q3] change from 
baseline to week 80 was  -60.0 [-330.0,  12.0]);  however, these seemed to be driven by outliers and 
small sample size at week 80 (n = 13/150).   Median  concentrations of vitamin K were similar at 
baseline and at week 80. 
No trends indicative of clinically important  treatment-related laboratory abnormalities were observed 
with  evolocumab in this study. 
HoFH  subjects 
In Study 20120124,  laboratory values that  shifted from baseline grades 0, 1, or 2 to postbaseline 
grades 3 or 4 were observed in bilirubin (baseline grade 2 to grade 3  [n = 1]) and CK (baseline grade 
0 to grade 3 [n = 2]).  For CK, 1 subject had CK elevations at week 12 and week 80  with no relevant 
co-reported adverse events, and 1 subject had CK elevations at  week 48 coincident with  an upper 
respiratory tract infection; a grade 3 nonserious event of myositis was reported for this  subject.  Five 
HoFH  subjects also had a total cholesterol postbaseline grade 4 toxicity, but  all of these subjects had 
either grade 3 (2 [16.7%])  or grade 4 (3 [25.0%])  toxicities at  baseline.  No other grade 4 laboratory 
toxicities occurred. 
Overall, no trends indicative of clinically important treatment-related laboratory abnormalities were 
observed with evolocumab in this  study.  Interpretation of laboratory trends is minimized by the small 
sample size, particularly with  steroid hormones as there were only 2 female HoFH  subjects.  In 
general, HbA1c and fasting blood glucose values remained overall unchanged throughout  the study.  
Shifts in hsCRP from baseline <  3 mg/L to maximum postbaseline > 3 mg/L  were observed in 2 
(16.7%)  subjects.  A review of vitamin assessments did not reveal any clinically significant  impact of 
evolocumab on these parameters. 
In Study 20110271,  no patterns indicative of clinically important treatment-related laboratory 
abnormalities were observed in this  study. 
Laboratory values that  shifted from baseline grades 0, 1, or 2 to postbaseline grades 3 or 4  were 
observed in CK; 2  (14.3%) pediatric HoFH  subject had a shift from baseline grade 0 to grade 4.  For

both subjects, corresponding nonserious grade 1 adverse events of increased blood creatine 
phosphokinase were reported; the events were considered unrelated to evolocumab by the investigator 
and evolocumab was continued.   No other grade 3 or grade 4 postbaseline laboratory values were 
noted.  No significant  change in HbA1c from baseline was noted. 
Creatine  kinase 
HeFH  subjects 
In Study 20120123,  1 (1.0%)  subject in the evolocumab group had CK > 5 x upper limit  of normal 
(ULN)  at baseline.  No subject had a postbaseline CK value >5  x ULN  at week 24. 
In Study 20120124,  1(0.7%)  HeFH  subject had CK > 5 x ULN  at baseline only.  Two (1.4%)  subjects 
with  normal CK at baseline had a postbaseline CK value that  was > 5 x ULN at  week 12, including  1 
(0.7%)  subject with  a postbaseline CK value that  was >10 x ULN.   No other instance of postbaseline 
CK value > 5 x ULN  occurred. 
HoFH  subjects 
In Study 20120124,  no HoFH  subjects had CK> 5 x ULN  at baseline.  Two (16.7%)  subjects with 
normal baseline CK had at least 1 postbaseline CK value that was > 5 x ULN  at week 12 (n  = 1), week 
48 (n =  1), and week 80 (n =  1).  No HoFH  subjects had a postbaseline CK value > 10 x ULN. 
In Study 20110271,  2 (15.4%)  pediatric subjects with normal CK values at baseline had CK >  10 x ULN 
at any postbaseline visit. 
Liver function tests 
HeFH  subjects 
In Study 20120123,  1 (1.9%)  placebo subject had total bilirubin > 2 x ULN  at baseline, week 12, and 
week 24.   One (1.0%)  evolocumab subject with  normal total bilirubin  at baseline had total bilirubin  >2 
x ULN at  the week 24 visit.  No  subject had alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) > 3 x ULN  at any time during  the study. 
In Study 20120124,   3 (2.0%)  subjects had a postbaseline total  bilirubin > 2 x ULN.   In subjects with 
normal total  bilirubin at baseline, 2 (1.5%)  subjects had total  bilirubin > 2 x ULN  at the week 12  visit, 
and of these 1 subject had total  bilirubin > 2 x ULN  at the week 48  visit, and 1 subject at  the week 80 
visit. 
No HeFH  subjects had ALT or AST >  3 x ULN  at baseline.  One (0.7%)  HeFH  subject had ALT or AST > 
3 x ULN  at week 12.  No subject had ALT or AST > 5 x ULN  at any time during the  study. 
HoFH  subjects 
In Study 20120124,  1 (8.3%)  subject had total  bilirubin > 2 x ULN  at each postbaseline time point 
(week 12,  48, and 80).  No subjects with  normal total  bilirubin at baseline had total bilirubin >  2 x ULN 
at any time during the study. No HoFH  subject had ALT or AST > 3 x ULN  at any time during the  study. 
In the pediatric subset of Study 20110271,  1 (7.1%) subject had ALT or AST > 5 x ULN at  any 
postbaseline visit and 1 (7.1%)  subject had total bilirubin  > 2 x ULN at  any postbaseline visit.   No 
subject had (ALT or AST >  3 x ULN)  and (total  bilirubin > 2 x ULN  or international  normalized ratio > 
1.5) at  any postbaseline visit.

Overall, no trends indicative of clinically important treatment  related laboratory abnormalities including 
haemoglobin A1c, fasting blood glucose, hsCRP, hormone levels, vitamins were observed with 
evolocumab in Study 20120123,  20120124  and 20110271,  as laboratory values were generally within 
the normal range. Subject incidence of creatine kinase (CK) elevations and liver function tests (LFT) 
elevations was low, and no imbalance between treatment groups in double-blind, placebo-controlled 
Study 20120123  was observed. Moreover, safety data on vitamin E  levels show to be within  the 
normal range consistent with  the initial  dossier. In Study 20120123,  events of uric acid occurred more 
frequently in the evolocumab group (6.7%,  n-7) compared to  the placebo group (3.8%, n=2)  from 
baseline grade 0 to post-baseline grade 3. However, the events in the evolocumab group were all 
considered non-related to the study drug, which is reassuring. 
Vital  signs 
Across all included studies (20120123,  20120124,  and 20110271),  there were no trends indicative of 
important vital sign, including  systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate 
abnormalities observed. 
Tanner staging 
HEFH  subjects 
In Study 20120123,  a total of 66 male subjects (42  [98%5] evolocumab, 24 [92%]  placebo) and 76 
female subjects (54 [89%]  evolocumab, 22 [825] placebo) had assessment of growth  and pubertal 
development (Tanner stage) reported (Table 43). There was no evidence of an effect of evolocumab 
on Tanner stage.  Subjects had normal Tanner staging  appropriate for their age at baseline and week 
24, with  no differences in overall mean (SD) age between the evolocumab and placebo groups at 
baseline using the  criteria of gender (genital size for males and breast development for females) or 
pubic hair.  Furthermore, the number of subjects with  changes in Tanner stage while on treatment  was 
generally similar between treatment  groups for each criterion.  Most subjects in the evolocumab and 
placebo groups did not have a change in Tanner staging by each criterion during the study.

In Study 20120124,  42 male subjects and 59 female subjects had assessments of growth and pubertal 
development (Tanner stage) reported at week 80 (Table  44).   
There was no evidence of an effect of evolocumab on Tanner stage using the  criteria of gender (genital 
size for males and breast development for females) or pubic hair.  Subjects had normal Tanner staging 
appropriate for their age at baseline and week 80.

Table 44. Summary of Tanner staging at  baseline and  week  80 - Study 20120124 (full 
analysis set) 
HoFH  subjects 
In Study 20120124,  10 male subjects and 2 female subjects had assessments of growth and pubertal 
development (Tanner stage) reported at week 80 (Table  44). There was no evidence of an effect of 
evolocumab on Tanner stage using the criteria of gender (genital size for males and breast 
development for females) or pubic hair. Subjects had normal Tanner staging  appropriate for their age 
at baseline and week 80. 
Of the 9 pediatric subjects with  Tanner staging growth parameters in Study 20110271,  all had normal 
Tanner staging  for their age. 
Overall, no meaningful changes in blood pressure or heart rate were observed with  evolocumab in 
Study 20120123,  20120124  and 20110271.

Additionally, assessments of growth and pubertal development (Tanner stage)  did not reveal an effect 
of evolocumab on Tanner stage in  Study 20120123,  20120124  and 20110271.  However, the  placebo-
controlled safety data of 24 weeks exposure to evolocumab is considered too limited to draw firm 
conclusions on the  effect of evolocumab on Tanner staging.  
Safety  in special populations 
Age (10-≤11  vs 12 -≤17  years of age) 
HeFH 
In Study 20120123,  among subjects 10 -≤  11 years old, the overall incidence of treatment-emergent 
adverse events was similar in the  evolocumab (17 [70.8%])  and placebo (10 [71.4%])  treatment 
groups, and most adverse events were reported for 1 subject in  either group.  The most comment 
adverse events (> 5% of subjects in either group) were gastroenteritis (5 [20.8%]  evolocumab, 1 
[7.1%]  placebo), upper respiratory tract infection (4 [16.7%],  0), nasopharyngitis (3 [12.5%],  1 
[7.1%]),  viral upper respiratory tract infection (2 [8.3%],  0), injection site pain (2 [8.3%],  1 [7.1%]), 
pyrexia (2 [8.3%],  1 [7.1%]),  abdominal pain (2 [8.3%],  0), cough (2 [8.3%],  1 [7.1%]),  and 
headache (2 [8.3%],  0). 
Among subjects 12 -≤  17 years old, the overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was 
similar in the evolocumab (47 [58.8%])  and placebo (24 [61.5%])  treatment  groups, and most 
adverse events were reported for 1 subject in either group.  The most comment adverse events (> 5% 
of subjects in  either group) were nasopharyngitis (9 [11.3%]  evolocumab, 5 [12.8%]  placebo), 
headache (9 [11.3%],  1 [2.6%]),  oropharyngeal pain (6  [7.5%], 0),  influenza (5 [6.3%],  1 [2.6%]), 
pyrexia (1 [1.3%],  2 [5.1%]),  blood creatine phosphokinase increased (1 [1.3%], 2  [5.1%]), 
gastroenteritis (0, 3 [7.7%]),  rhinitis  (0, 2 [5.1%]),  cough (0, 2 [5.1%]),  and depression (0, 2 
[5.1%]). 
In Study 20120124,  among subjects 10 -≤11  years old with HeFH,  the overall incidence of treatment-
emergent adverse events was 11 (37.9%)  subjects.  Most adverse events were reported for 1  subject 
each, except for nasopharyngitis (5 [17.2%]),  pyrexia (2 [6.9%]),  and headache (2 [6.9%]). 
Among subjects 10 -≤11  years old with HoFH,  the overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse 
events was 3 (50.0%)  in the  evolocumab treatment group.  All reported adverse events occurred in 1 
subject each. 
Among subjects 12 -≤17  years old with HeFH,  the overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse 
events was 83 (73.5%)  subjects.  Most  adverse events were reported for 1 or 2 subjects in either 
group.  The most frequently reported adverse events (> 5%  of subjects) were nasopharyngitis (16 
[14.2%]),  headache (11 [9.7%]),  influenza like illness (9  [8.0%]), gastroenteritis (7 [6.2%]), 
oropharyngeal pain (7  [6.2%]), upper respiratory tract infection (7 [6.2%]),  and abdominal pain upper 
(6 [5.3%]).    
HoFH 
In Study 20120124,  among subjects 10 -≤  11 years old with HoFH,  the overall incidence of treatment-
emergent adverse events was 3 (50.0%)  in the evolocumab treatment group.  All reported adverse 
events occurred in  1 subject each. 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/572365/2021  
Page 110/131 
 
 
 
 
Among subjects 12 to  ≤ 17 years old with HoFH,  the overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse 
events was 4 (66.7%).   All reported adverse events occurred in 1  subject each, except for epistaxis 
(2 [33.3%]). 
Although higher adverse events rates could be observed in the 12-≤17  years of age subgroup 
compared with  the 10-≤ 11  years of age subgroup in both  the HeFH  and HoFH  subjects, no specific 
pattern indicative for a safety signal across the  subgroups could be observed. Overall, the most 
frequently reported events were generally consistent with  the known adverse drug reactions for 
evolocumab. 
Safety  related  to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No new information on drug-drug interaction is available for this  submission; Studies 20120123, 
20120124,  and 20110271  were not designed to  evaluate drug-drug or drug food interactions.  
Discontinuation due to adverse  events 
HeFH  subjects 
The incidence in discontinuation  due to adverse events was low. In Study 20120123,  1 (1.0%)  subject 
in the evolocumab group experienced a nonserious grade 2 adverse event of arthropathy leading to 
discontinuation  of investigational product that  was considered related to  investigational product  by the 
investigator.  No subject in the placebo group experienced an adverse event leading to discontinuation 
of investigational product.   
In Study 20120124,  no subjects experienced a treatment-emergent adverse event that  led to 
discontinuation  of evolocumab. 
HoFH  subjects 
In Study 20120124,  no subjects experienced TEAEs leading to discontinuation  of study drug. 
In Study 20110271,  one subject had a grade 3 nonserious adverse event of rash leading to 
discontinuation  of evolocumab. In the OLE Study 20110271,  1 out of 14 (7.1%)  HoFH  subject 
discontinued the study due to an adverse event of rash.  
Post marketing experience 
As of 17  July 2020,  evolocumab has been approved in 77 countries and an estimated 748 312 patients 
(551 687 patient-years) have been exposed worldwide to evolocumab in the postmarketing setting 
(Table 42).  On 30  January 2020,  the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use issued a 
positive opinion for evolocumab renewal covering the last  5 years and an unlimited  license for 
evolocumab in the European Union (EU).

The evaluation of the safety data from the postmarketing setting has not resulted in the detection of 
any new important  identified or potential risks for inclusion in the EU  Risk Management Plan (RMP).  
Postmarketing evaluation of relevant subgroups (pregnancy and lactation,  pediatric, elderly [≥ 75 
years], severe renal impairment, severe hepatic impairment, hepatitis C, type 1 diabetes, human 
immunodeficiency virus, patients with  HoFH)  has not resulted in any significant  safety findings.  
Cumulatively through  17 July 2020,  postmarketing adverse event case reports have been received for 
139 pediatric patients ranging in age from 2 to  17 years and exposed to evolocumab.  The majority 
(90%)  of reported adverse events were nonserious and overall the most commonly reported event was 
off-label use (based on age or dosing regimen).  Overall, the reported events were consistent with  the 
known safety profile of evolocumab and/or expected events in the  patient population independent of 
drug exposure. 
Exposure to evolocumab in the postmarketing setting  has identified adverse drug reactions of 
hypersensitivity including  angioedema and influenza like illness; the Summary of Product 
Characteristics has been updated accordingly.  Myalgia has also been identified as an adverse drug 
reaction based on the postmarketing experience; updates to regional prescribing information is 
ongoing.  Reports of nonserious finger stick events associated with  autoinjector use were received 
which resulted in a revision of the instructions  for use in the United  States (US),  EU, and other regions.   
In summary, it has been estimated that 748 312 patients (551 687 patient-years) have been exposed 
worldwide to evolocumab in the post-marketing setting.  Cumulatively through 17  July 2020, post-
marketing adverse event case reports have been received for 139 pediatric patients ranging in age 
from 2  to 17 years and exposed to evolocumab.  The majority (90%)  of reported adverse events were 
nonserious, and overall the most commonly reported event was off-label use (based on age or dosing 
regimen), which is reassuring. Overall, the reported events were consistent with  the known safety 
profile of evolocumab. 
2.4.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
In the current dossier, the safety evaluation is primarily based on the  double-blind, randomized Study 
20120123  and its ongoing OLE study 20120124  and supplemented by safety data from the  phase 2/3 
open-label extension Study 20110271.   
Patient  exposure. In the initial  MA dossier, 5710  patients, (majority were adult  subjects) were 
exposed to evolocumab  in > 25 clinical trials across broad patient  populations, representing 5246 
patient years of exposure. With the  submission of the cardiovascular outcome trial FOURIER, with  a 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/572365/2021  
Page 112/131 
 
 
 
 
total of 27525  adult subjects and the GLAGOV study with  968 adult  subjects included, the overall 
exposure data from clinical studies has substantially increased although exposure in the FOURIER 
study was limited to a median of 2.6  years. Furthermore, it  has been estimated that  748312 patients 
(551687  patient years) have been exposed worldwide to evolocumab in the post marketing setting; 
So, there is large safety experience with evolocumab, although the experience in pediatric patients is 
limited, however, increased based on the safety data of Study 20120123  and 20120124  currently 
under review. 
For the HeFH  population  aged 10-≤17  years across the RCT Study 20120123  and OLE Study 
20120124,  a total of 153  patients received at least 1 dose of evolocumab, with a total patient-year 
exposure of 249  with  149 (97.4%),  135 (88.2%),  and 76 (49.7%)  HeFH  subjects exposed to 
evolocumab for at least 24,  48 and 96 weeks, respectively. In terms of numbers this  is sufficient 
according to  guideline recommendations and considering that this  may be a life-long treatment. 
Placebo-controlled safety data of pediatric HeFH  subjects who received all 6 doses of IP, i.e. 24  weeks 
of exposure, in the RCT Study 20120123  is available for 98 subjects (out of 104, 94%)   in the 
evolocumab group and 51  (out of 53,  96%)  subjects in the  placebo group, which is considered 
sufficient to identify evolocumab related safety effects. 
For the HoFH  population,  12 de-novo pediatric HoFH  subjects 10-≤17  years of age in the OLE Study 
20120124  received at least one dose of evolocumab, with  a total patient-year exposure of 17. Of these 
patients, all do-novo HoFH  subjects (100.0%)  had evolocumab exposure ≥ 28 weeks and 11 (91.7%) 
completed the study and, as such, were exposed to evolocumab for 80 weeks. The safety exposure 
data is supplemented with  exposure data of 14 HoFH  pediatric subjects 12-≤  17 years of age in the 
OLE Study 20110271,  who received evolocumab for up to 5  years, which resulted in  a combined 
exposure of 62.2  patient-years, which  still remains limited  especially considering that  evolocumab is 
intended for life-long treatment. The number of  HoFH  subjects aged 10-≤11  years exposed to 
evolocumab is limited but expected and acceptable considering the rarity of the  HoFH  disease. 
Adverse events.  In pediatric HeFH  subjects in the  RCT Study 20120123,  TEAES were frequently 
reported, however, with  a lower percentage in the evolocumab group compared with  the placebo group 
(61.5%  vs 64.2%).  The most frequent AEs (> 5%  of subjects) with  a higher incidence with 
evolocumab compared with placebo were nasopharyngitis (11.5%  vs 11.3%), headache (10.6%  vs 
1.9%),  oropharyngeal pain (6.7%  vs 0.0%),  influenza (5.8% vs 3.8%), upper respiratory tract 
infection (5.8%  vs 1.9%).  When considering longer treatment (OLE Study 20120124),  the frequency in 
TEAEs increased slightly (66.7%),  however, an approximately similar safety profile was observed with 
nasopharyngitis (14.7%),  headache (8.7%),  influenza-like illness (8.7%),  gastroenteritis (6.0%), 
upper respiratory tract infection (5.3%), and oropharyngeal pain (5.3%) being the most prominent 
adverse events observed. The safety findings are consistent with  the safety data observed in adults in 
the initial  MAA dossier and the FOURIER dossier, with  the exception of the disbalance in oropharyngeal 
pain. The TEAEs of oropharyngeal pain observed in HeFH  subjects in Study 20120123  and 20120124 
were nonserious, mild to moderate in severity and all considered not related to treatment with 
evolocumab. 
For the pediatric HoFH  patients aged 10-≤17  years in the OLE Study 20120124,  7 of the 12  (58.3%) 
HoFH  subjects experienced TEAEs, however, none of the  TEAEs occurred in more than 1 subject with 
the exception of epistaxis (n=2, 16.7%),  which  is reassuring. In the  pediatric subset of HoFH  subjects 
aged 12-≤17  years of the OLE study 20110271,  12  of the  14 subjects (85.7%) experienced TEAEs with 
anxiety, migraine, and upper respiratory tract infection  (21.4% (n=3)  each) as being the most 
common adverse events observed. The higher frequency of TEAEs compared with those observed for 
HeFH  subjects in Study 20120123  and for the HeFH  and HoFH  subjects in Study 20120124  can be 
explained by the longer (5  year) study duration of Study 20110271.  Overall, no new safety signal as 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/572365/2021  
Page 113/131 
 
 
 
compared with  the initial MAA dossier and the FOURIER dossier is observed, although  firm conclusions 
cannot be made due to the limited  exposure data in pediatric HoFH  patients.   
The incidence in device-related adverse events was low (3 (2.9%)  vs 2 (3.8%)  HeFH  subjects in the 
evolocumab vs placebo group in Study 20120123  and 7.3%  of the  HeFH  subjects in Study 20120124 
and in one HoFH  subject in Study 20120124).  Moreover, the majority were mild in severity and related 
to the injection site,  which is consistent with  those observed in the initial MA dossier and the  FOURIER 
dossier.   No new TEAEs considered by the investigator related to IP has been identified, which is 
reassuring. As also described above, most of treatment related TEAEs were injections site reactions, 
which is a known ADR of evolocumab. 
AEs of special interest. Since evolocumab is a human monoclonal immunoglobulin,  specific attention 
has been given to potential hypersensitivity, potential injection site reactions and anti-evolocumab 
antibodies. In the HeFH  subjects of the  RCT Study 20120123,  a higher incidence of hypersensitivity 
was observed in the  evolocumab group (3.8%  and 6.7% using narrow and  broad SMQ, respectively) 
compared with  the placebo group (0% using both  narrow and broad SMQ), however, the incidence was 
relatively low and no specific pattern indicative for a safety signal could be observed. Moreover, the 
incidence in potential injection site reactions was lower in the evolocumab group (4.8% using both 
broad and narrow SMQ) compared with the  placebo group (5.7% using both  broad and narrow SMQ). 
With  respect to long-term treatment,  the incidence in hypersensitivity (observed in the OLE Study 
20120124)  was comparable with  that observed in the RCT study. The incidence in injection site 
reaction events of 8.7% (using both  the narrow and broad SMQ) in the OLE Study 20120124  was 
slightly higher compared with  the RCT Study, which  can be explained by the longer study duration of 
the OLE study.  For the HoFH  population, only one HoFH  subject in  the OLE Study 20120124  had a 
potential injection site  reaction, which was nonserious and mild in  severity and 2 HoFH  subjects in the 
OLE Study 20110271  reported a potential  hypersensitivity event. Furthermore, anti-evolocumab 
antibodies were not  reported in any of the studies 20120123,  20120124,  and 20110271,  which is 
reassuring. There is no evidence of an unexpected safety concern regarding muscle adverse events, 
hepatic events and adverse events in subjects who achieved low LDL-C  levels in both HeFH  and HoFH 
pediatric subjects.  
Specific attention  has been given to neurocognitive abnormalities, as very low levels of LDL-C have 
been associated with increased risk of neurocognitive abnormalities, although  this was not observed in 
the initial  submitted dossier nor in the  FOURIER dossier. No clinically relevant abnormalities were 
observed with six pediatric HeFH  subjects (1  subject in the  evolocumab group of the RCT Study 
20120123,  4 subjects in the OLE  Study 20120124,   and one HoFH  subject (OLE Study 2012024) 
experiencing potential neurocognitive events. Additionally, results of the Cogstate Cognitive Battery of 
neurological tests assessed in Study 20120123  and in Study 20120124  also did not reveal any 
clinically relevant abnormalities. Nevertheless, the  data are considered limited, which precludes 
appropriate assessment.  
Serious AEs. The incidence in  SAEs was relatively low with 1  (1%) HeFH  subject in the evolocumab vs 
none in placebo group in Study 20120123  and  4 (2.7%)  HeFH  subjects treated with  evolocumab in 
Study 20120124.  For the HoFH  population, 2 out of 12 (16.%)  subjects in Study 20120124  and in 4 
out of 14 (28.6%)  subjects in Study 20110271  experienced a SAE. Moreover, none of the SAEs were 
considered by the investigator related to IP, which is reassuring.  
Deaths.  No deaths were observed in subjects treated with  evolocumab or placebo in the Studies 
20120123,  20120124,  and 20110271.  Furthermore, in  the RCT Study 20120123  and OLE Study 
20110271,  no pediatric subject had a positively adjudicated cardiovascular endpoint adverse event. 
These events were not adjudicated in the OLE  Study 20120124.

Laboratory findings. Overall, no trends indicative of clinically important treatment-related laboratory 
abnormalities including  haemoglobin A1c, fasting blood glucose, hsCRP, hormone levels, vitamins were 
observed with evolocumab in Study 20120123,  20120124  and 20110271,  as laboratory values were 
generally within  the normal range. 
Vital  Signs. Across the studies 20120123,  20120124,  and 20110271,  no meaningful changes in blood 
pressure or heart rate were observed with  evolocumab. Additionally, assessments of growth and 
pubertal development (Tanner stage)  did not  reveal an effect of evolocumab on Tanner stage in Study 
20120123,  20120124  and 20110271.  However, the safety data, particularly the placebo-controlled 
safety data of 24 weeks exposure to evolocumab, is considered too limited to draw firm conclusions on 
the effect of evolocumab on Tanner staging. 
Safety  in special populations. Although higher adverse events rates could be observed in the 12-≤
17 years of age subgroup compared with  the 10-≤ 11  years of age subgroup of both the  HeFH  and 
HoFH  subjects, no specific pattern indicative for a safety signal across the subgroups could be 
observed. Overall, the most frequently reported events were generally consistent  with the  known 
adverse drug reactions for evolocumab. 
Discontinuations due to AEs. Across all three studies, only two discontinuations  due to AEs were 
observed (1 (1.0%) HeFH  subject in the  evolocumab group in Study 20120123  due to an AE of  
arthropathy and 1 out of 14 (7.1%)  HoFH  subject in the OLE Study 20110271  due to an AE of rash). 
Both AEs are known adverse drug reactions of evolocumab.  
Dose regimens. No safety data are available for the proposed 420 mg Q2W regimen for the  pediatric 
HoFH  subjects aged 10-≤11  years.  
Post marketing experience.  Cumulatively through 17  July 2020, post marketing adverse event case 
reports have been received for 139 pediatric patients  ranging in  age from 2  to 17 years and exposed to 
evolocumab. The majority (90%) of reported adverse events were nonserious and overall the most 
commonly reported event was off-label use (based on age or dosing regimen), which is reassuring.

2.4.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Evolocumab displays an acceptable safety profile in pediatric HeFH  and HoFH  patients aged 10-≤17 
years comparable to those observed in adults with  HeFH  and adults and adolescents with  HoFH  in the 
initial  MAA dossier and the  FOURIER dossier with very limited  patients discontinuing  treatment or 
showing serious adverse events.  
However, one uncertainty remain which  concerns safety confirmation on the evolocumab 420 mg Q2W 
regimen in HoFH  subjects 10-≤11  years of age.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Familial hyperlipidemia is a genetic disorder characterized by elevated serum lipid concentrations. 
Among the conditions that  comprise familial hyperlipidemia, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a 
more common form of inherited hypercholesterolemia characterized by elevated serum LDL-C and the 
development of premature cardiovascular disease (CVD). 
Heterozygous FH  (HeFH)  accounts for the large majority of FH  overall and is estimated to occur in 
1:250  individuals globally (Hu  et al., 2020; Wiegman et al., 2015).  Untreated LDL-C levels in affected 
individuals are significantly elevated (7.0  ± 0.2 mmol/L]) compared with  controls ( 2.6 ± 0.1  mmol/L) 
(Raal et  al., 2013). Despite aggressive statin use, there is still  a 2-fold excess of coronary heart 
disease (CHD) related deaths relative to age-matched controls within  this population  (Neil et al., 
2008). 
By comparison, the  prevalence of homozygous FH (HoFH)  is approximately 1:1,000,000  individuals 
and untreated LDL-C levels are 13.4  ± 0.7 mmol/L (Raal et al., 2013).  The incidence of major 
cardiovascular illness among homozygous individuals is even higher than  that of HeFH  individuals, with 
events such as myocardial infarction occurring by the second decade of life (Goldstein et al., 2001). 
The goal of therapy  in patients with  FH  is to reduce LDL-C, which  reduces atherogenesis and 
subsequently reduces CVD events and mortality, as demonstrated by the results of the CVOT 
FOURIER.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
HeFH  and HoFH  patients should be treated with  intensive LDL-C lowering drug therapy to lower their 
increased LDL-C levels. Currently, available registered therapies for pediatric HeFH  and HoFH  patients 
include statins and ezetimibe. Non-pharmacological therapies include lipid  apheresis. 
Statin therapy  is the cornerstone treatment  for LDL-C lowering and causes a LDL-C reduction of 30-
40% in  pediatric HeFH  patients  and LDL-C  reduction of ~22 % in pediatric patients with  HoFH.   
Ezetimibe, on top of statins, can reduce LDL-C by 15-30%  in pediatric patients with  HeFH  and HoFH. 
Apheresis is a non-pharmacological treatment option; a single treatment reduces LDL-C by 55%-70% 
relative to pre-treatment levels. However, apheresis may be burdensome and limited available. Also, 
only temporal reduction in LDL-C is achieved. 
Due to  the limitations  of currently available treatments, some patients,  especially those with  high LDL-
C like HoFH  patients,  are generally sub-optimally treated, resulting in remaining increased levels of 
LDL-C (with  increased CV risk), as such, there is still  an unmet  medical need for new treatment options 
for pediatric patients  with HeFH  and HoFH.   
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
For the pediatric HeFH  population, the  main evidence was provided by the phase 3 randomized 
placebo-controlled (RCT) Study 20120123  which compared the reduction of LDL-C by evolocumab 420 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/572365/2021  
Page 119/131 
 
 
 
mg QM (n=  104)  with  placebo (n=53)  after 24  weeks in HeFH  pediatric patients aged 10-≤17 years 
(with  standard of care lipid-lowering  background therapy) and its ongoing single-arm open-label 
extension (OLE)  Study 20120124  in which all subjects received 420 mg QM for 80 weeks. The primary 
endpoint of the RCT Study 20120123  was the percent change in LDL-C from baseline to week 24, 
whereas the percent change in  LDL-C from baseline to  week 80 was the key secondary endpoint of the 
OLE Study 20120124.   Important (other) secondary endpoints included other lipid parameters, i.e. 
non-HDL-C,  ApoB, total cholesterol, HDL-C ratio and ApoB/ApoA1 ratio. 
For the pediatric HoFH  population, the  main evidence was provided by de-novo HoFH  patients aged 10-
≤17 years enrolled in  the ongoing single-arm OLE Study 20120124,  supplemented with  data of the 
Phase 2/3   open-label long-term Study 20110271  in subjects 12-≤80  years of age with  HoFH  or severe 
FH. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Pediatric HeFH  population 
LDL-C  reduction. Evolocumab demonstrated a substantial reduction in LDL-C of 38.3%  at week 24 
compared with  placebo (-44% vs -6.23;  p<0.0001)  in a population of patients (n=157  with  2:1 ratio) 
aged 10-≤17  years with  genetically or clinically confirmed HeFH  on optimized background lipid-
lowering therapy with  a baseline level of 4.8 mmol/L (absolute mean change -2.1  mmol/L). The LDL-C 
lowering effect already started at week 12  and was maintained up to  104 weeks of treatment (across 
both parent and OLE studies). 
Other  endpoints. The LDL-C lowering effect was supported by other lipid  parameters, including non-
HDL-C (-35.04%),  ApoB (-32.47%),  total cholesterol/HDL-C ratio (-30.30%)  and ApoB/ApoA1 ratio (-
36.38%). 
Subgroups. The effect appears generally consistent among several subgroups, including gender, race, 
age, region, baseline LDL-C values, statin intensity,  and baseline PCSK9.  
Pediatric HoFH  population 
LDL-C  reduction. In the OLE  study 20120124,  evolocumab demonstrated a median LDL-C  reduction 
of 12.2%, 14.5%,  and 14.3%  at week 12, 48  and 80,  respectively, in a limited  population of patients 
(n=12)  aged 10-≤17  years with genetically or clinically confirmed HoFH  on optimized background lipid-
lowering therapy with  a baseline LDL-C level of 10.3  mmol/L. The effect size was consistent  with the 
median LDL-C reduction in the subset of the 14 adolescents HoFH  aged 12-≤17  years from Study 
20110271  who received the 420 mg QM  regimen or the  (higher dose) 420 mg Q2W regimen (13.3%, 
8.1%,  8.7%, 9.5%,  and 20.0%  at weeks 48,  96, 144,  192, and 216, respectively). 
The efficacy results according to LRLR mutation  (negative, defective, or unknown) demonstrated that 
treatment with  evolocumab leads to a reduction in LDL-C levels regardless of the type of LDLR 
mutation.  However, within  each subgroup of LDLR mutation  there was a large degree of intersubject 
variability including  non-responders which, however, were in the minority. 
In Study 20110271,  two different dose regiments were allowed in pediatric HoFH  subjects 12-≤ 17 
years of age. Pediatric subjects who started this  study receiving evolocumab 420 mg QM could change 
their dose to  420 mg Q2W if insufficient suppression of PCSK9 (> 100 ng/mL)  was observed at week 
12 or 24. In this study,  the titration  analysis set (TAS), defined as the subset of subjects who were 
exposed to evolocumab 420 mg QM for at least 12 weeks and then to  evolocumab 420 mg Q2W for at 
least 12 weeks, showed that  increasing the frequency of the evolocumab 420 mg dose from QM to 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/572365/2021  
Page 120/131 
 
 
 
Q2W resulted in an additional mean LDL-C reduction of 10.0%  corresponding to a mean absolute 
reduction of 28.3 mg/dL. 
Subgroups. For the HoFH  subjects 10-≤11  years of age, the median LDL-C reduction was comparable 
with  the overall pediatric HoFH  population (12.2%  and 19.2% at week 12, and week 80, respectively), 
except for week 48 (4.6%). 
Other  endpoints. The LDL-C lowering effect was supported by other lipid  parameters, including non-
HDL-C, ApoB, total cholesterol/HDL-C ratio and ApoB/ApoA1 ratio. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Pediatric HeFH  population 
Proposed dose regimen. In the RCT Study 20120123  and the OLE  Study 20120124,  only the  420 
mg QM regimen has been evaluated, whereas in addition  to this regimen also the 140  mg Q2W 
regimen in pediatric HeFH  subjects aged 10-≤17  years is proposed (same posology as currently 
approved for the adult  HeFH  population). As such, the efficacy of the 140 mg Q2W dose in pediatric 
HeFH  patients aged 10-≤17  years has not been evaluated. The efficacy of the  proposed 140 mg Q2W 
is extrapolated from the other dosing scheme and from adult studies. 
Effect size. The effect size in LDL-C lowering of 38.3%  observed in the RCT Study in  pediatric 
subjects with HeFH  was lower than the LDL-C  lowering effect of 60% observed in adults with  HeFH  in 
the RUTHERFORD study (Study 20110117)  and other previous clinical studies (range: 60-70%) 
submitted  during the initial MAA, despite comparable LDL-C levels at baseline. Nevertheless, the LDL-C 
lowering effect is still  considered substantial and clinically relevant. 
Carotid intima-media  thickness. The effect of evolocumab on clinical outcomes in the populations 
covered by this  application of variation are not known. cIMT analysis showed small reductions in cIMT 
with  evolocumab therapy from baseline to week 24,  48, and 80 in the pediatric HeFH  populations in 
Study 20120123  and 20120124,  suggesting a beneficial effect of evolocumab concerning 
atherogenesis. However, these results are too limited  (short study period and small reduction) to draw 
firm conclusions. 
Pediatric HoFH  population 
Proposed dose regimen. In the OLE Study 20120124,  only the 420 mg QM  regimen has been 
evaluated, whereas in  addition to this regimen also the  420 mg Q2W regimen in pediatric HoFH 
subjects 10-≤11  years is proposed (same posology as currently approved for the adult  and adolescent 
HoFH  population).  As such, the efficacy of the 420 mg Q2W dose in pediatric HoFH  patients aged 10-
≤11 years has not been evaluated. 
Effect size. The effect size in median LDL-C  reduction of 12-14.5%  with  the 420  mg QM regimen 
observed in the pediatric HoFH  population in Study 20120124  appears somewhat lower than  those 
observed with the  420 mg QM regimen in  the studies previously submitted, i.e. Study 20110233 
(TESLA) and Study 20110271  (TAUSSIG) in the overall HoFH  population consisting adult  and pediatric 
subjects aged 12-≤17  years (32% and 16.3%,  respectively).  
Carotid intima-media  thickness. cIMT analyses showed small reductions in cIMT with  evolocumab 
therapy from baseline to week 24, 48, and 80 in  the pediatric HoFH  population in Study 20120124, 
suggesting a beneficial effect of evolocumab concerning atherogenesis. However, these results are too 
limited (short study period and small reduction) to  draw firm conclusions.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Pediatric HeFH  population 
Exposure. A sufficient number of pediatric HeFH  patients  aged 10-≤17  years have been evaluated for 
safety according to guideline recommendations, including 149  (97.4%),  135 (88.2%),  and 76 (49.7%) 
pediatric HeFH  subjects exposed to evolocumab for at least 24, 48 and 96 weeks, respectively. 
Placebo-controlled safety data of pediatric HeFH  subjects who received all 6 doses of IP, i.e. 24  weeks 
of exposure, in the RCT Study 20120123  is available for 98 subjects (out of 104, 94%)   in the 
evolocumab group and 51  (out of 53,  96%)  subjects in the  placebo group, which is considered 
sufficient to identify evolocumab related safety effects. 
Adverse events.  TEAEs were frequently reported, however, with  a lower percentage in the 
evolocumab group compared with  the placebo group (61.5%  vs 64.2%).  The most frequent AEs (>  5% 
of subjects) with a higher incidence with  evolocumab compared with  placebo were nasopharyngitis 
(11.5%  vs 11.3%),  headache  (10.6%  vs 1.9%), oropharyngeal pain (6.7%  vs 0.0%),  influenza 
(5.8%  vs 3.8%),  upper respiratory tract infection (5.8% vs 1.9%). When considering longer 
treatment, the  frequency in TEAEs increased slightly (66.7%);  however, an approximately similar 
safety profile was observed with nasopharyngitis (14.7%),  headache  (8.7%),  influenza-like 
illness (8.7%),  gastroenteritis (6.0%), upper respiratory tract infection (5.3%),  and 
oropharyngeal pain (5.3%)  being the most prominent adverse events observed. The safety findings 
are consistent with  the safety data observed in adults  in the initial  MAA dossier and the  FOURIER 
dossier, with  the exception of the  disbalance in oropharyngeal pain. 
Device-related  adverse  events  were uncommon, mostly not severe, and generally limited to 
injection site reactions, consistent with  those observed in the initial  MA dossier and the FOURIER 
dossier.   
Drug-related  adverse  events.  No new TEAEs considered by the investigator related to IP has been 
identified. Most  of treatment related TEAEs were injections site reactions, which is a known ADR of 
evolocumab. 
Adverse events  of special interest. A higher incidence of potential hypersensitivity  was 
observed in the evolocumab group (3.8%  and 6.7% using narrow and broad SMQ, respectively) 
compared with  the placebo group (0% using both  narrow and broad SMQ); however, the incidence was 
relatively low, and no specific pattern indicative for a safety signal could be observed. Moreover, the 
incidence in potential injection site reactions was lower in the evolocumab group (4.8% using both 
broad and narrow SMQ) compared with the  placebo group (5.7% using both  broad and narrow SMQ). 
With  respect to long-term treatment,  the incidence in potential  hypersensitivity was consistent 
comparable with  that observed in the RCT study. The incidence in injection site reactions increased 
with  long-term treatment (8.7%)  due to longer study duration. Anti-evolocumab antibodies were 
not reported. There is no evidence of an unexpected safety concern regarding muscle adverse 
events,  hepatic events  and adverse  events  in subjects who achieved  low LDL-C  levels.   
Serious adverse  events.  The incidence in SAEs was relatively low with  1 (1%)  HeFH  subject in the 
evolocumab vs none in the placebo group in the  RCT study and 4 (2.7%)  HeFH  subjects treated with 
evolocumab in OLE study. Moreover, none of the SAEs were considered by the investigator related to 
IP. 
Deaths.  There were no deaths reported. 
Laboratory findings. No trends indicative of clinically important treatment-related laboratory 
abnormalities, including haemoglobin A1c, fasting blood glucose, hsCRP, hormone levels, vitamins, 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report

were observed with  evolocumab in Study 20120123  and 20120124,  as laboratory values were 
generally within  the normal range. 
Tolerability. Evolocumab was well tolerated, with  only one HeFH  patient  discontinuing  evolocumab 
treatment due to an event of arthropathy across the RCT and OLE study.  
Pediatric HoFH  population 
Adverse events.  For the pediatric HoFH  patients  aged 10-≤17 years in the OLE  Study 20120124,  7 of 
the 12 (58.3%)  HoFH  subjects experienced TEAEs; however, none of the TEAEs occurred in more than 
1 subject with  the exception of epistaxis (n=2,  16.7%).  In the pediatric subset of HoFH  subjects aged 
12-≤17  years of the  OLE study 20110271,  12 of the 14  subjects (85.7%)  experienced TEAEs with 
anxiety, migraine, and upper respiratory tract infection  (21.4% (n=3)  each) as being the most 
common adverse events observed. Overall, no new safety signal as compared with the initial  MAA 
dossier and the FOURIER dossier is observed, although firm conclusions cannot be made due to  the 
limited exposure data. 
Device-related  adverse  events  were uncommon, mostly not severe, and generally limited to 
injection site reactions, which is consistent with  those observed in the  initial MA dossier and the 
FOURIER dossier.   
Drug-related  adverse  events.  No new TEAEs considered by the investigator related to  IP has been 
identified. Most  of treatment related TEAEs were injections site reactions, which is a known ADR of 
evolocumab. 
Adverse events  of special interest. Across both Studies 20120124  and 20112071,  only one HoFH 
subject in the OLE Study 20120124  had a potential injection site reaction, which  was nonserious 
and mild in severity and only 2  HoFH  subjects in  the OLE Study 20110271  reported a potential 
hypersensitivity event.  Across both Studies 20120124  and 20112071,  anti-evolocumab 
antibodies were not  reported. There is no evidence of an unexpected safety concern regarding 
muscle adverse  events,  hepatic  events  and adverse  events  in subjects who achieved  low 
LDL-C  levels.   
Serious adverse  events.  The incidence in serious AEs was relatively low, with  2 out of 12 (16.%)) 
HoFH  subjects in Study 20120124  and in 4 out of 14 (28.6%)  HoFH  subjects in Study 20110271 
experiencing a SAE. Moreover, none of the  SAEs were considered by the investigator related to IP. 
Deaths.  There were no deaths reported. 
Laboratory findings. No trends indicative of clinically important treatment-related laboratory 
abnormalities including  haemoglobin A1c, fasting blood glucose, hsCRP, hormone levels, vitamins were 
observed with evolocumab in Study 20120124  and 20110271,  as laboratory values were generally 
within  the normal range. 
Tolerability. Evolocumab was well tolerated, with  only one HoFH  patient discontinuing  evolocumab 
treatment due to an event of rash in the OLE study. 
Post marketing experience 
Cumulatively through  17 July 2020,  post-marketing adverse event case reports have been received for 
139 pediatric patients ranging in age from 2 to  17 years and exposed to evolocumab.  The majority 
(90%)  of reported adverse events were nonserious, and overall the most commonly reported event 
was off-label use (based on age or dosing regimen).

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Pediatric HeFH  population 
Proposed dose regimen. In the RCT Study 20120123  and the OLE  Study 20120124,  only the  420 
mg QM regimen has been evaluated, whereas in addition  to this regimen also the 140  mg Q2W 
regimen in pediatric HeFH  subjects aged 10-≤17  years is proposed (same posology as currently 
approved for the adult  HeFH  population). As such, the safety of the 140  mg Q2W dose in pediatric 
HeFH  patients aged 10-≤17  years has not been evaluated.  
Subgroups. Although higher adverse events rates could be observed in the 12-≤17  years of age 
subgroup compared with the  10-≤ 11 years of age subgroup in  HeFH  subjects, no specific pattern 
indicative for a safety signal across the subgroups could be observed. Overall, the most frequently 
reported events were generally consistent with  the known adverse drug reactions for evolocumab. 
Adverse events  of special interest. Increased risk of neurocognitive and neurological 
abnormalities was not observed. However, the data are considered limited,  which precludes 
appropriate assessment. Nevertheless, neurocognitive and neurological abnormalities have 
comprehensively evaluated in a subset of the FOURIER study (EBBINGHAUS subset) in which no 
differences between evolocumab and placebo were found.  
Tanner stage.  Assessments of growth  and pubertal development (Tanner stage)  did not reveal an 
effect of evolocumab on Tanner stage in the RCT study and the OLE study. However, the safety data, 
particularly the  placebo-controlled safety data of 24 weeks exposure to evolocumab, is considered too 
limited to  draw firm conclusions on the  effect of evolocumab on Tanner staging. 
Pediatric HoFH  population 
Exposure. A limited number of pediatric subjects aged 10-≤17,  particularly the subset of 10-≤11 
years, were exposed to evolocumab. However, this  is expected and acceptable considering the rarity of 
the HoFH  disease. Overall, 12  de-novo pediatric HoFH  subjects 10-≤17  years of age in the  OLE Study 
20120124  received at least one dose of evolocumab, with  a total patient-year exposure of 17. Of these 
patients, all de-novo HoFH  subjects (100.0%)  had evolocumab exposure ≥ 28 weeks, and 11 (91.7%) 
completed the study and, as such, were exposed to evolocumab for 80 weeks. The safety exposure 
data is supplemented with  exposure data of 14 HoFH  pediatric subjects 12-≤17  years of age in the OLE 
Study 20110271,  who received evolocumab for up to 5 years, which  resulted in a combined exposure 
of 62.2 patient-years.  
Proposed dose regimen. In the OLE Study 20120124,  only the 420 mg QM  regimen has been 
evaluated, whereas in  addition to this regimen, the 420  mg Q2W  regimen in pediatric HoFH  subjects 
10-≤11  years is proposed (same posology as currently approved for the adult  and adolescent HoFH 
population). As such, the safety of the 420  mg Q2W dose in pediatric HoFH  patients  aged 10-≤11 
years has not  been evaluated. 
Subgroups. Although higher adverse events rates could be observed in the 12-≤17  years of age 
subgroup compared with the  10-≤ 11 years of age subgroup in  HoFH  subjects, no specific pattern 
indicative for a safety signal across the subgroups could be observed. Overall, the most frequently 
reported events were generally consistent with  the known adverse drug reactions for evolocumab. 
Adverse events  of special interest. Increased risk of neurocognitive and neurological 
abnormalities was not observed. However, the data are considered very limited, which  precludes 
appropriate assessment. Nevertheless, neurocognitive and neurological abnormalities have 
comprehensively evaluated in a subset of the FOURIER study (EBBINGHAUS subset) in which no 
differences between evolocumab and placebo were found.

Tanner stage.  Assessments of growth  and pubertal development (Tanner stage)  did not reveal an 
effect of evolocumab on Tanner stage in the HoFH  subset of Study 20120124RCT  study. However, the 
safety data, is considered very limited in order to  draw firm conclusions on the effect of evolocumab on 
Tanner staging.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
Evolocumab is a fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin G2 directed against human proprotein 
convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9  (PCSK9), which inhibits  circulating PCSK9 from binding  to the LDLR 
on the liver cell surface, thus  preventing PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation.  
In the current group of variations, a modified indication was proposed by the Applicant to include one 
new pediatric indication in pediatric patients aged 10 years and over with heterozygous familial 
hypercholesterolaemia based on results of study 20120123  (HAUSER-RCT) and 20120124  (HAUSER-

OLE) and to modify the existing indication for treatment of adults and paediatric patients  aged 10 
years and over with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia based on interim results from study 
20120124  (HAUSER-OLE). 
The agreed indication reads as follows (new  text in bold and underlined; removed text bold and 
stikethrough): 
Hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia 
Repatha is indicated in  adults with  primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and 
non-familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, and in paediatric patients aged  10 years and over with 
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia,  as an adjunct  to diet: 
• 
in combination with  a statin or statin  with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients unable to 
reach LDL-C  goals with  the maximum tolerated dose of a statin or, 
alone or in combination with  other lipid-lowering therapies in  patients who are statin-intolerant, 
or for whom a statin  is contraindicated. 
• 
Homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia 
Repatha is indicated in  adults and adolescents paediatric patients aged 12 10 years and over with 
homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia in combination with  other lipid-lowering  therapies. 
Established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 
Repatha is indicated in  adults with  established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (myocardial 
infarction, stroke or peripheral arterial disease) to  reduce cardiovascular risk by lowering LDL-C  levels, 
as an adjunct  to correction of other risk factors: 
• 
in combination with  the maximum tolerated dose of a statin  with  or without  other lipid-lowering 
therapies or, 
alone or in combination with  other lipid-lowering therapies in  patients who are statin-intolerant, 
or for whom a statin  is contraindicated. 
• 
For study results with  respect to effects on LDL-C,  cardiovascular events and populations studied see 
section 5.1. 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Evolocumab has demonstrated a substantial  and consistent  reduction in LDL-C and other lipid 
parameters on top of optimized lipid-lowering therapies, including  statins and ezetimibe, in pediatric 
HeFH  and HoFH  subjects aged 10-≤17  years of age. The reductions in  LDL-C (and other lipid 
parameters) were lower in HoFH  subjects compared with HeFH  subjects, however, expected 
considering that  the mechanism of action depends on the activity of the LDL receptor. The changes in 
LDL-C are considered to be clinically relevant effects as LDL-C is an important surrogate endpoint  with 
potential benefits in terms of a cardiovascular outcome, as previously confirmed by the results of the 
CVOT FOURIER. The long-term studies provided data indicating  maintenance of effect and safety for 
the pediatric HeFH  and HoFH  population. The documented exposure of evolocumab in the pediatric 
HeFH  subjects aged 10-≤17  is according to guideline recommendations and therefore sufficient. 
Concerning the  pediatric HoFH  population, the number of pediatric patients exposed to evolocumab, 
particularly the  HoFH  patients aged 10-≤11 years, is considered limited but  expected and acceptable 
considering the  rarity of the HoFH  disease.  
Regarding safety, evolocumab displayed an acceptable safety profile consistent  with the  safety data 
observed in adults HeFH  subjects and adults  and adolescents HoFH  subjects in the initial  MAA dossier 
and the FOURIER dossier with  very limited patients discontinuing  treatment or showing serious adverse 
events. Additionally, evolocumab did not  cause any clinically relevant differences in adverse events of

special interest,  including hypersensitivity, injection site reactions, anti-evolocumab antibodies, and 
neurological and neurocognitive abnormalities, muscle AEs, hepatic AEs,  AEs in  subjects who achieved 
low LDL-C levels, and AEs according to the  age categories 10-≤11 and 12-≤17 years in both  pediatric 
HeFH  and HoFH  populations. 
With  respect to the posology, no changes to the approved evolocumab dosing regimens were proposed 
for the populations of pediatric HeFH  subjects aged 10-≤17  years and the HoFH  subjects aged 10-≤11 
years, which are currently under review. However, in Study 20120123  and 20120124,  only the 420  mg 
QM regimen has been evaluated, whereas in addition  to this regimen also the 140  mg Q2W regimen in 
pediatric HeFH  subjects aged 10-≤17  years and the 420  mg Q2W regimen in pediatric HoFH  subjects 
10-≤11  years are currently proposed (same as those currently stated in the labelling for the approved 
HoFH  and HeFH  populations). As such, the efficacy and safety of the 140 mg Q2W dose regimen for 
pediatric HeFH  patients aged 10-≤17 years and the 420  mg Q2W  dose regimen for pediatric HoFH 
patients aged 10-≤11  years have not been evaluated. PK data have adequately shown that the PK is 
dose-linear and that  relative to primary hyperlipidaemia and mixed dyslipidemia, HeFH,  HoFH  and age 
do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetic profile of evolocumab. As such, the 
140 mg Q2W regimen, which is considered clinically equivalent to the  420 mg QM regimen proposed 
for pediatric HeFH  patients  aged 10-≤17  years, is considered acceptable. However, the 420  mg Q2W 
regimen proposed for HoFH  subjects 10-≤11  years of age concerns a 2-fold higher dose than the 420 
mg QM for which the efficacy and safety in the  proposed population of pediatric HoFH  patients  aged 
10-≤11  years is currently unknown. Despite similar PK across different types of FH  and age categories, 
the safety profile of the 420 mg Q2W in the  pediatric patients  with  HoFH  aged 10-≤11  years can differ 
compared to the adult  population and the older pediatric HoFH  population of  12-≤17  years for which 
this dose regimen is currently already approved. The efficacy and safety of the 420 mg Q2W dose 
(together with  the 420  mg QM)  have only been evaluated in the  adult subjects with  HoFH  or severe FH 
and in the older pediatric HoFH  population  of  12-≤17  years in Study 20110271.  In this  study, dose 
frequency changes (420  mg QM vs 420  mg Q2W) were permitted if a clinically meaningful response is 
not achieved. The titration  analysis set (TAS), defined as the subset of subjects who were exposed to 
evolocumab 420 mg QM for at least 12 weeks and then to  evolocumab 420 mg Q2W for at least 12 
weeks, showed that  increasing the frequency of the evolocumab 420 mg dose from QM to Q2W 
resulted in an additional mean LDL-C reduction of 10.0%  corresponding to a mean absolute reduction 
of 28.3 mg/dL.  Considering that  in Study 20120124,  the median LDL-C reduction with  the 420 mg QM 
dose regimen was comparable between the HoFH  subjects 10 - ≤11 years of age and the overall 
pediatric HoFH  population, it  can be anticipated that  increasing the frequency of the evolocumab 420 
mg dose from QM to Q2W in HoFH  subjects 10  - ≤11 years of age results in a comparable additional 
mean LDL-C  reduction of 10%.  Previously, secondary prevention LDL-C lowering trials have shown that 
reduction of 38.7 mg/dL (1  mmol/L) in LDL-C is associated with  a 22% reduction in the 5-year 
incidence of major coronary events, revascularizations, and ischemic strokes (Cholesterol Treatment 
Trialists’ Collaboration [CTTC], 2010).  Based on above, this additional mean absolute reduction of 28.3 
mg/dL upon increasing the frequency of the 420 mg dose to  Q2W can be considered clinically relevant, 
particularly in  pediatric HoFH  subjects which are at high cardiovascular risk. 
With  respect to safety, the safety profile of the  420 mg Q2W regimen in pediatric HoFH  subjects 10-≤
11 years of age is still  unknown. The Applicant  argued that  in Study 20120124  and Study 20110271  no 
unexpected safety concerns has been found. Additionally, none of the  adverse events were related to 
growth, pubertal development, or hormonal status. However, firm conclusion on growth and pubertal 
development and hormonal status  can still not be made due to limited  sample size and treatment 
duration and the fact that  in Study 20120124,  only the 420 mg QM  regimen in HoFH  subjects 10-≤11 
years has been evaluated. In this context,  an justification  in order to extrapolate these safety results 
to HoFH  subjects aged 10-≤11  years of age receiving the Q2W regimen has not been provided.

Nevertheless, it  is acknowledged that  the benefits of the additional clinically relevant reduction in LDL-
C upon increasing the frequency of the 420  mg dose to Q2W in HoFH  subjects aged 10-≤11 years who 
are at very high cardiovascular risk outweigh the  adverse events observed in this  HoFH  population to 
date. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Benefits of evolocumab in terms of a substantial  reduction in LDL-C are accompanied by limited risks. 
Notwithstanding  these results, there are some uncertainties including a lack of confirmation of 
additional LDL-C reduction with  an acceptable safety profile with the  higher evolocumab 420  mg Q2W 
regimen in HoFH  subjects. Nevertheless, it  is acknowledged that the  benefits of the additional  clinically 
relevant reduction in LDL-C upon increasing the frequency of the 420 mg dose to Q2W in HoFH 
subjects aged 10-≤11 years who are at  very high cardiovascular risk outweigh the adverse events 
observed in this HoFH  population  to date. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of evolocumab for the pediatric HeFH  subjects aged 10-≤17  and HoFH  aged 10-≤12 is 
positive.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted  data, the CHMP considers the following group of variations 
acceptable and therefore recommends the variation to  the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, 
concerning the  following change:

C.I.6 (EoI) 
Extension of indication to include one new pediatric indication  in pediatric patients aged 10  years and 
over with  heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia as an adjunct to diet, alone or in combination 
with  other lipid-lowering therapy, to  reduce LDL-C based on results of study 20120123  (HAUSER-RCT) 
and study 20120124  (HAUSER-OLE).  It is a randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 
parallel-group, 24 week trial in 158 pediatric patients aged 10 to >  18 years with heterozygous familial 
hypercholesterolaemia. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2,  4.8, 5.1 and 5.2  of the  SmPC are 
updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 7.1 of the RMP has also been 
submitted.

C.I.6 (EoI) 
Extension of indications to modify the  existing indication for treatment  of adults  and paediatric patients 
aged 10  years and over with  homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia in combination with  other 
lipid-lowering therapies based on interim results from study 20120124  (HAUSER-OLE).  It was an open-
label, single-arm, multicenter,  80 week trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Repatha 
for LDL-C reduction in pediatric patients  from aged ≥ 10 to < 18  years of age with homozygous 
familial hypercholesterolaemia.  As a consequence, sections 4.1,  4.2, 4.8,  5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are 
updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance.  
The requested group of variations leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics 
and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted  with  the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to  the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Paediatric data 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006,  the application included EMA  Decision 
P/0105/2018  on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000  and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000,  the MAH  did not submit  a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to  the proposed indication. 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this  variation. In particular the EPAR 
module 8 "steps after the  authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
Scope 
Please refer to the Recommendations section above. 
Summary

Population(s)
Diffuse Large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (EU)
Treatment of adult patients with R/R DLBCL after 2 or more lines of systemic therapy
Incidence:
DLBCL is an aggressive type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) that develops from the B-cells in 
the lymphatic system and the most common type of NHL, accounting for 30% to 40% of NHL.
LBCL is a heterogeneous collection of clinicopathological entities, which includes DLBCL (not 
otherwise specified [NOS]) (accounting for >80% of cases of LBCL), follicular lymphoma [FL]
grade 3b, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma [PMBCL], high grade B
cell lymphoma (HGBCL)
with MYC and B-cell lymphoma (BCL) 2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements and HGBCL, NOS

EU
The most up-to-date European Cancer Information System (ECIS) provides incidence of NHL 
but not subtypes in the EU for 2020 (ECIS - European Cancer Information System).
The incidence of DLBCL in the EU-27 was estimated by multiplying the incidence of NHL in the 
EU-27 for 2020 (18.3/per 100,000, age standardized rate [European new]) by the proportion 
of DLBCL (NOS) in NHL from Haematological Malignancy Research Network (HMRN; 40.6%) 
(ECIS - European Cancer Information System, Haematological Malignancy Research Network 
(HMRN)).  The estimated incidence of DLBCL was 7.4 (9.0 in males and 6.2 in females) per 
100,000 for 2020 in the EU-27 and ranged from 3.5 (Bulgaria) to 11.4 (Slovenia) per 100,000.  
(Smith 2015b).
The estimated incidence of DLBCL in the EU-27 for 2020 by age group (40 to 54, 55 to 69, and 
70 to 84 years) was 5.0, 13.1, 24.0 per 100,000, respectively.
US
Based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program and Cancer 
Statistics Review, the age-adjusted incidence of DLBCL in the US from 2015 to 2019 was 
5.6 per 100,000 per year (6.7 in males and 4.6 in females) (National Cancer Institute 2022b). 
The percent of new cases by age group (45 to 54, 55 to 64, 65 to 74, 75 to 84, > 84 years) 
was 11.5%, 21.2%, 26.2%, 20.0%, and 8.4%, respectively (National Cancer Institute 2022b).
FL grade 3b is fast growing and accounts for 5% to 10% of FL (Barraclough 2021).  The age-
adjusted incidence of FL in the US from 2015 to 2019 was 2.6 per 100,000 per year (2.8 in 
males and 2.4 in females).  The percent of new cases by age group (45 to 54, 55 to 64, 65 to 
74, 75 to 84, > 84 years) was 16.2%, 27.5%, 27.5%, 15.3%, 4.8%, respectively 
(National Cancer Institute 2022c).
PMBCL accounts for about 2% to 4% of NHL (National Cancer Institute 2022a).  The annual 
incidence of PMBCL was 0.04 per 100,000 (Yu 2021).
The proportion of HGBL with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements in DLBCL was 
estimated to be 1% to 12% (Scott 2018).  HGBL, NOS accounts for 3% of the adult invasive 
BCLs (Li 2020).
LBCL incidence is estimated to be 5.9 per 100,000 per year in the US (DLBCL, 5.6; FL 
grade 3b, 0.26; PMBCL, 0.04).
Prevalence:
EU
According to the Orphanet Report Series, the estimated DLBCL prevalence in Europe (age-
adjusted to the European population) was 4.3 per 10,000 (Orphanet 2020).
12
Epcoritamab
EU Risk Management Plan
Version 1.4 / Data Lock Point 31 January 2022
The prevalence of DLBCL in the EU-27, plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway in 2020 was 
estimated to be 4 per 10,000 individuals (European Medicines Agency 2022).
US
The prevalence of DLBCL in the US was estimated by multiplying the annual DLBCL incidence in 
the US derived from the SEER Program (5.6 per 100,000; 18,873.41 new cases per year) by 
the estimated disease duration (overall survival [OS], 5.0 years) (Costa 2014, National Cancer 
Institute 2022b).  The resulting prevalence estimate was 28.0 per 100,000 (93,216 cases) in
the US with DLBCL.
Demographics of the target population:
DLBCL is more common in males than females and occurs mostly in older people (see 
incidence data by gender and age group above). The average age at the time of diagnosis is 
mid-60s (National Cancer Institute 2022b).  Incidence varies by ethnicity, with Caucasians 
having higher risks compared to blacks, Asians, or other races (Morton 2006, Shirley 2013, 
Smith 2011).
A more recent study reported DLBCL incidence and relative survival (RS) in the Netherlands by 
age, sex, and stage of disease (Durmaz 2022).  By stage, the age-adjusted incidence during 
2011 to 2018 (per 100,000 per year) was 5.4 overall, 1.0 for stage 1, and 4.2 for stages 2 to 
4.  The incidence for all stages (per 100,000) was 4.4 in those 20 to 64 years of age, 22.2 in 
those 65 to 74 years of age, and 34.9 in those ≥ 75 years of age.  Specifically for stages 2 to 
4, the incidence (per 100,000 per year) was 3.5 in those 20 to 64 years of age, 17.9 in those 
65 to 74 years of age, and 26.0 in those ≥ 75 years of age.
Similar to DLBCL, FL grade 3b occurs mostly in older people and more commonly in males 
(Barraclough 2021).  Unlike other NHL subtypes, PMBCL occurs mostly in adolescents and 
young adults (median age, 35 years) with female predominance (National Cancer Institute 
2022a).
Risk Factors:
The etiology of DLBCL remains poorly understood. Risk increases with age and is higher in 
males and Caucasians (Haematological Malignancy Research Network (HMRN) , Howlader 
2020, National Cancer Institute 2022b).  Other potential risk factors include a family history of 
lymphoma, genetic susceptibility loci (tumor necrosis factor/lymphotoxin-alpha; 6p25.3; 
6p21.33; 2p23.3; 8q24-21), viruses (Epstein-Barr Virus, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], 
herpes virus type 8, hepatitis B, hepatitis C), solid-organ transplantation, B-cell-activating 
autoimmune disorders (systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's syndrome, celiac disease), 
immunodeficiency, increased body-mass index (in young adults), agricultural pesticides, and 
ionizing radiation (Sehn 2021).
No specific risk factors have been identified for FL grade 3b and PMBCL (Martelli 2017).

The main existing treatment options:
DLBCL is a rapidly advancing cancer that requires immediate treatment.  The standard first-line 
therapy for DLBCL is the combination of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and 
prednisone (CHOP), or a similar "CHOP-like" regimen, with rituximab (R-CHOP) (National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network 2021).  Approximately a third of patients are refractory to or 
relapse after R-CHOP within 5 years of diagnosis (Cunningham 2013).
For R/R patients after frontline chemoimmunotherapy, the sole option for long-term survival is 
salvage therapy, followed by high dose therapy (HDT) and autologous hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (ASCT). However, only half of the patients with R/R DLBCL are eligible to 
receive HDT-ASCT, and among those who are transplant-eligible, some are insensitive to 
salvage therapy, precluding ASCT (Gisselbrecht 2012, Hamadani 2014).  For the patients who 
relapse or are ineligible for second line HDT-ASCT, patients will normally be offered non-
intensive salvage therapy (eg, gemcitabine and oxaliplatin [GemOx] with or without rituximab, 
bendamustine with or without rituximab, pixuvri) or other palliative intervention
(Corazzelli 2009, National Comprehensive Cancer Network 2021, Vacirca 2014, 
Zelenetz 2021).
Recently, multiple drugs have been approved for R/R DLBCL.  Chimeric antigen receptor t-cell 
(CAR T-cell) therapies (tisagenlecleucel, axicabtagene ciloleucel, and lisocabtagene maraleucel) 
are approved for patients with R/R DLBCL after at least 2 lines of therapy in the US and EU.
Polatuzumab vedotin in combination with bendamustine + rituximab (BR) is approved for third-
line patients with R/R DLBCL in the US and second line in EU (if not eligible for ASCT); 
however, it is limited in many regions and is only an option for patients whose disease is 
sensitive to chemotherapy.  Tafasitamab (in combination with lenalidomide) is approved in the 
EU for the treatment of adult patients with R/R DLBCL.
FL grade 3b is often treated as DLBCL (Dreyling 2021).  Historically R-CHOP has been the usual 
first line treatment for PMBCL followed by involved site radiotherapy, however recent studies 
have shown excellent responses with etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin, and rituximab (DA-EPOCH-R) with omission of consolidative mediastinal RT. For 
R/R PMBCL, salvage chemoimmunotherapy followed by ASCT provides a best chance of long-
term disease control. Despite excellent responses to first-line therapy, outcomes of R/R PMBCL 
remain poor. Breyanzi and Yescarta have been recently approved for the treatment of adult 
patients with R/R PMBCL after at least 2 lines of therapy in the US and EU.  Keytruda is 
approved for third- or later lines PMBCL in the US and not approved in EU.  Patients with 
HGBCL are typically treated with standard R-CHOP or more aggressive regimens such as 
DA-EPOCH-R, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, adriamycin, and dexamethasone
(R-hyper-CVAD) or rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, 
methotrexate/ifosfamide, etoposide, high dose cytarabine (R-CODOX-M/IVAC) (Decker 2020, 
Ok 2020).

Natural history of the indicated disease/condition in the untreated population, including 
mortality and morbidity:
DLBCL is ideally diagnosed from an excisional biopsy of a suspicious lymph node, which shows 
sheets of large cells that disrupt the underlying structural integrity of the follicle center of the 
lymph node and stain positive for pan-B-cell-antigens, such as CD20 and CD79a.  DLBCL is a 
heterogeneous disease and can be classified in multiple ways: clinically, by morphology, or by 
immunohistochemical and molecular subgroups (Gatter 2010, Hans 2004, Scott 2014, 
Wright 2003).
DLBCL can present as de novo disease or occur as a transformation from low-grade BCLs such 
as FL or chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).  DLBCL is divided 
into 4 stages based upon involvement of lymph nodes and extranodal sites.  Approximately 
40% of DLBCL is stage 1/2 (localized) and 60% is stage 3/4 (advanced) at the time of 
diagnosis (Smith 2015b).  At least one-third of DLBCL becomes R/R, and 70% of R/R DLBCL 
(at least 25% of DLBCL overall) are transplant-ineligible or chemo-refractory (Sarkozy 2018).
The disease typically begins as a rapidly growing mass in a lymph node or other organ.  If left 
untreated, patients with DLBCL have a median survival of less than 1 year (Rovira 2015). 
Initial treatment with R-CHOP results in cure in approximately 50% to 70% of patients overall
(Liu 2019, Sarkozy 2018).  Patients who achieve event-free status at 24 months from 
diagnosis have a subsequent OS that is comparable to the general population (Maurer 2014).
For patients whose disease is refractory to initial treatment or relapses after achieving 
remission, the outcomes are poor (Liu 2019).  Approximately 10% to 15% of all DLBCL 
patients treated with R-CHOP will fail within 1 year of diagnosis, and these patients with early 
R/R disease have a very poor prognosis (Sarkozy 2018).  An additional 20% to 30% of all 
DLBCL patients will have a later relapse of disease.
For patients with R/R DLBCL, the current preferred treatment is salvage chemotherapy 
followed by HDT-ASCT. Due to advanced age or existing comorbid conditions a significant 
proportion of patients are ineligible for ASCT. Among those who are eligible for ASCT, only 
approximately 40% receive ASCT, mainly due to non-response to salvage therapy
(Sarkozy 2018).
PMBCL was previously classified as a DLBCL subtype. Due to its unique clinical, histological, and 
molecular characteristics, PMBCL has been listed as a separate type in lymphoma classification 
by the World Health Organization since 2016 (Swerdlow 2016).
PMBCL is an aggressive LBCL originating in the mediastinum, that mainly expresses B cell 
surface molecules, such as CD19, CD20, CD22, andCD79a. Clinically, they are characterized 
by rapidly increasing anterior mediastinal masses, which can cause compression of the 
surrounding tissues. The involvement of distant lymph nodes and bone marrow is rare.

Symptoms develop rapidly, usually within a few weeks of disease onset.  Eighty percent of 
cases are diagnosed as stage 1 to 2 (Yu 2021).
FL grade 3b is a special category in which the neoplasm is composed exclusively of 
centroblasts, without admixed centrocytes. Studies have reported that FL grade 3b exhibits a 
lower frequency of CD10 antigen expression and t(14;18) chromosomal translocation, both 
markers seen in a high proportion of FL grades 1 to 3a. By contrast, cytoplasmic 
immunoglobulin expression and the presence of chromosome band 3q27 rearrangement, 
features associated more commonly with DLBCL, were seen more commonly in FL grade 3b 
(Shustik 2011).
HGBCL with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements (ie, double hit or triple hit [DH/TH] 
lymphoma) shows variable morphologies including DLBCL, BCL-unclassified or blastoid 
features.  Patients with DH/TH lymphoma often have advanced stage disease and a poor 
prognosis. HGBCL that lacks DH/TH genetics have similar, aggressive morphological features 
(Ok 2020).
Survival:
Overall survival (OS) for newly diagnosed DLBCL patients approaches 75% at 5 years; 
however, in high-risk patients, it may be as low as 25% to 30% (DH/TH, non-germinal center 
b-cell) to 50% (International Prognostic Index [IPI] 3 to 5) at 5 years (Culpin 2013, 
Cunningham 2013, Ziepert 2010).  Among 202 patients aged 60 to 80 years old who were 
randomized to receive R-CHOP for DLBCL, the median OS was 8.4 years (Coiffier 2010).
After the introduction of the standard IPI, the use of the revised (R)-IPI has been proposed 
based on data from DLBCL patients treated with R-CHOP.  The R-IPI is a better predictor of 
outcome than the standard IPI for patients with DLBCL treated with R-CHOP.  The R-IPI 
includes the same factors as the IPI, but only includes 3 risk groups: very good (0 factors), 
good (1 to 2 factors), and poor (3 to 5 factors); with a 5-year survival of 93%, 81%, and 61%, 
respectively (Ruppert 2020, Sehn 2007).
In a population-based study in the UK, the 5-year OS and RS (in DLBCL, NOS diagnosed 2004
to 2012 and followed through to 2014) was 46.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 44.4 to 48.7) 
and 55.0 (52.6 to 57.4), respectively.  Among the patients that received intensive first-line 
chemotherapy with curative intent, the 5-year OS was 58.5% (Smith 2015a).
In a study from the Netherlands, the 5-year RS of adult patients diagnosed with DLBCL 
between 2011 and 2018 decreased by age and stage.  For stage 1, the 5-year RS was 96% in 
those 20 to 64 years of age, 84% in those 65 to 74 years of age, and 67% in those ≥ 75 years 
of age. For stage 2 to 4, the 5-year RS was 75% in those 20 to 64 years of age, 60% in those 
65 to 74 years of age, and 46% in those ≥ 75 years of age (Durmaz 2022).

In the US, the 5-year RS was similar for males and females (64%), higher in whites than 
blacks (65.1% and 60.7%, respectively), and decreased with age (79.4% in those < 55 years 
of age, 70.6% in those 55 to 64, and 54.8% in those ≥ 65) (National Cancer Institute 2022b).  
By stage, the 5-year RS was 79.5%, 74.6%, 65.5%, 54.7% for stage 1, 2, 3, 4, respectively.
In a pooled analysis of outcomes of refractory DLBCL from 2 multi-country Phase 3 clinical 
trials (Lymphoma Academic Research Organization-CORAL and Canadian Cancer Trials 
Group LY.12) and 2 observational cohorts (MD Anderson Cancer Center and University of 
Iowa/Mayo Clinic Lymphoma Specialized Program of Research Excellence), the median OS was 
6.1 (95% CI, 5.2 to 7.0) months in patients who received at least 3 lines of therapy.  1-year
and 2-year survival rates were 26% and 17%, respectively (Crump 2017).
In a multicenter retrospective review of 124 patients with newly diagnosed PMBCL between 
2001 and 2016, the 5-year OS for patients receiving R-CHOP, DA-EPOCH-R, and R-CHOP + RT 
were 76.1% (95% CI, 57.1% to 87.3%), 93.9% (95% CI, 77.8% to 98.4%), and 96.9% (95% 
CI, 79.8% to 99.5%), respectively (Chan 2019).  Among patients with R/R PMBCL who 
received pembrolizumab, the median OS was 31.4 months (Armand 2019).
A clinical outcome analysis of 71 patients (60 patients had de-novo DH/TH and 11 had 
transformation of a previously diagnosed low-grade lymphoma) showed that the median OS 
was 17.7, 13.5, 12.3 months in patients treated with R-CHOP, R-EPOCH, R-HyperCVAD, 
respectively.  Patients with DH/TH at transformation of previously diagnosed low-grade 
lymphoma had a very poor outcome (median OS = 10.8 months), which was inferior to 
patients with de-novo DH/TH (P = 0.0069).  The OS for the entire cohort at 5 years was 48% 
(Habermann 2016).
Important co-morbidities:
Several studies have published details about comorbid conditions among patients diagnosed 
with DLBCL. Cohorts that included younger patients or were restricted to patients who were 
treated with curative intent reported a lower prevalence of comorbidities. The most common 
comorbidities include diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, 
pulmonary disease, peptic ulcer disease, renal disease, solid tumor, arrythmia, and peripheral 
vascular disease.  Other comorbidities include congestive heart failure, heart valve disease, 
myocardial infarct, psychiatric disorders, connective tissue/rheumatologic disease, and liver 
disease (Kobayashi 2011, Kocher 2020, Nabhan 2011, van de Schans 2012, Wästerlid 2019, 
Wieringa 2014).
Module SII Non-Clinical Part of the Safety Specification
The nonclinical safety package to support the market approval of epcoritamab consists of in 
vitro cross-species binding assessments, in vitro safety studies using human cells and tissues 
(cytokine release assay, cross-reactivity, hemolytic potential, and plasma compatibility 
17

Version 1.4 / Data Lock Point 31 January 2022
assays), and in vivo studies in cynomolgus monkeys by both intravenous (IV) and SC 
administration route (including safety pharmacology and local tolerance evaluations).
The primary toxicity findings in cynomolgus monkeys administered epcoritamab included 
adverse clinical signs (incidents of vomiting, decreased activity, hunched posture; and 
mortality [≥ 1 mg/kg]). These findings were considered associated with elevated cytokine 
levels, observed primarily following the first dose.  SC administration of epcoritamab to 
cynomolgus monkeys was associated with lower maximum concentration values and lower 
peak cytokine levels, but comparable B-cell depletion relative to the same IV dose (mg/kg).  A 
priming dose administered IV as a lower dose than a later dose was associated with lower 
cytokine levels.  Other epcoritamab related findings included reversible hematologic changes 
(alterations in leukocytes and lymphocytes), and reversible B-cell depletion in peripheral blood 
consistent with reversible decreases in lymphoid cellularity in lymphoid tissues observed 
microscopically.
There were no epcoritamab-related local tolerance findings, nor any identified adverse effects 
on the cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurological systems, following IV and SC
administration of epcoritamab in cynomolgus monkeys.
Consistent with the in vivo findings in cynomolgus monkeys, epcoritamab also induced cytokine 
release in an in vitro cytokine release assay using human whole blood. In an in vitro assay of 
hemolytic potential using human whole blood, epcoritamab did not cause hemolysis and was 
also compatible with human whole blood and plasma at concentrations ≤ 20 μg/mL.  In the 
good laboratory practice (GLP) tissue cross-reactivity study using a comprehensive panel of 
human and cynomolgus monkey tissues, binding of epcoritamab was comparable across 
species and limited to mononuclear cells in various tissues. As CD3 and CD20 are expressed 
on T cells and B cells, respectively, the staining of blood lymphocyte and mononuclear cells in a 
majority of the tissues was in line with expected reactivity.
Overall, the observed toxicity findings in vivo are consistent with the anticipated pharmacologic 
activity of epcoritamab.

Risks Not Considered Important for Inclusion in 
the List of Safety Concerns in the RMP
Reasons for not including an identified or potential risk in the list of safety concerns 
in the RMP:
Risks with minimal clinical impact on patients (in relation to the severity of the 
indication treated):
Not applicable
Adverse reactions with clinical consequences, even serious, but occurring with a 
low frequency and considered to be acceptable in relation to the severity of the 
indication treated:
Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS)
TLS was observed in clinical trials with epcoritamab.  The observed frequency of TLS 
events in the epcoritamab clinical program was low.  Three (1.8%) subjects experienced 
treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) of TLS.  All 3 events met the criteria for Clinical 
TLS (CTLS), were grade 3, and were considered treatment related.  One event resolved 
and the other 2 events were ongoing at the time of death due to disease progression.  TLS 
commonly occurs in hematological malignant patients particularly non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 
and acute leukemia due to chemotherapy or spontaneously.  Hematologists and 
Oncologists treating hematological malignancies have appropriate awareness of this risk 
and follow standard prophylaxis and treatment as part of routine clinical practice.  TLS risk
is monitored via routine pharmacovigilance.
Known risks that require no further characterization and are followed up via 
routine pharmacovigilance and for which the risk minimization messages in the 
product information are adhered by prescribers (e.g., actions being part of 
standard clinical practice in each EU Member state where the product is 
authorized):
Neutropenia
Neutropenia is a very common TEAE observed in clinical trials with epcoritamab.  
Neutropenia events were reported in 47 (28.1%) subjects, with 36 subjects experiencing 
grade 3 or 4 events.  Neutropenia was managed with G-CSF (15.0%) and/or dose delays 
(4.2%).  No subjects discontinued epcoritamab treatment due to a TEAE of neutropenia.

Hematologists and Oncologists treating hematological malignancies have appropriate 
awareness of this risk and follow standard prophylaxis and treatment as part of routine 
clinical practice.  Neutropenia risk is monitored via routine pharmacovigilance.
Neurological events (excluding ICANS)
Neurological events were observed in clinical trials with epcoritamab.  Fifty nine of 
167 (35.3%) subjects experienced neurological events.  The most common neurological 
TEAEs (≥ 2% of subjects) were headache (12.6%; 21 subjects), ICANS (6.0%; 
10 subjects), dizziness (5.4%; 9 subjects), paresthesia (3.6%; 6 subjects), tremor (3.6%; 
6 subjects), and anxiety (2.4%; 4 subjects).  Most of the events were nonserious and were 
grade 1 or 2 in severity.  Hematologists and Oncologists treating hematological 
malignancies have appropriate awareness of this risk and follow standard prophylaxis and 
treatment as part of routine clinical practice.  Neurological events (excluding ICANS) risk is
monitored via routine pharmacovigilance.
Known risks that do not impact the risk-benefit profile:
Injection site reactions
Injection site reactions after subcutaneous administration of epcoritamab is a very common 
TEAE observed in clinical trials with epcoritamab.  Fifty (29.9%) subjects experienced at 
least 1 TEAE of injection site reaction.  In all subjects, the maximum event grade was 
either grade 1 (28.1%; 47 subjects) or grade 2 (1.8%; 3 subjects).  No grade 3 or higher 
events were observed.  Eleven (6.6%) subjects required treatment for at least 1 injection 
site reaction.  Treatment generally consisted of topical steroids and/or oral antihistamines.  
None of the events resulted in dose modifications.  Hematologists and Oncologists treating 
hematological malignancies have appropriate awareness of this risk and follow standard 
prophylaxis and treatment as part of routine clinical practice.  Injection site reactions risk 
is monitored via routine pharmacovigilance.
Pyrexia
Pyrexia is a very common TEAE observed in clinical trials with epcoritamab.  Pyrexia of any 
grade occurred in 22.8% of subjects.  No grade 3 or higher events were observed.  Pyrexia 
led to dose delay in 3%.  Hematologists and Oncologists treating hematological 
malignancies have appropriate awareness of this risk and follow standard prophylaxis and 
treatment as part of routine clinical practice.  Pyrexia risk is monitored via routine 
pharmacovigilance.

Risks Considered Important for Inclusion in the 
RMP
Important Identified Risks
Identified risk 1:  Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS)
Risk-benefit impact:  CRS is a class effect for other bispecific anticancer therapies and drugs engaging 
with T-cells.  Based on epcoritamab's mechanism of action, CRS is expected with epcoritamab.  CRS 
has been observed with epcoritamab in clinical trials.  In Study GCT3013-01, 2.4% (4/167) of LBCL 
subjects had grade 3 CRS.  In Study GCT3013-01 + Study GCT3013-04, 4.0% (15/374) of All B-NHL 
subjects had grade 3 CRS.  One (0.3%) subject in the All B-NHL group had grade 4 CRS.  There were 
no grade 5 CRS events.
Identified risk 2:  Immune Effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS)
Risk-benefit impact:  ICANS is a class effect for other bispecific anticancer therapies and drugs 
engaging with T-cells.  Based on epcoritamab's mechanism of action, ICANS is expected with 
epcoritamab.  ICANS has been observed with epcoritamab in clinical trials.  In Study GCT3013-01, 
6.0% (10/167) of LBCL subject experienced ICANS with most of the events either grade 1 (4.2%; 
7 subjects) or grade 2 (1.2%; 2 subjects) and no grade 3 or 4 events. One (0.6%) subject had a fatal 
ICANS event (grade 5).
Identified risk 3:  Serious Infections
Risk-benefit impact:  Infections are among the most common, potentially serious complications of B-cell 
malignancies and their treatments, due to immunosuppression caused by the underlying malignancy 
and treatments.  Infections have been reported with other bispecific antibody therapies.  Epcoritamab 
can cause immunomodulation of B- and T-cell interactions, B-cell depletion, and subsequently 
hypogammaglobulinemia.  Additionally, cytopenias observed during epcoritamab treatment may cause an 
increased risk of serious infections.  Serious infections have been observed with epcoritamab in clinical 
trials.  For LBCL, serious TEAEs of infection were reported in 16.2% (27/167) and fatal TEAEs in 2.4% 
(4/167) of subjects; all subjects were heavily pretreated and no fatal infection events were considered 
related to epcoritamab.
Important Potential Risks
Information 1:  Risk of overdose due to medication errors
Risk-benefit impact:  Potential events of overdose due to medication errors may occur with the 
administration of epcoritamab.  A total of 3 medication errors occurred in the epcoritamab clinical 
program and were included in the Summary of Clinical Safety (SCS) (2 in Study GCT3013-01 and 1 in 
Study GCT3013-02 [originally ascribed to Study GCT3013-04]).  An additional medication error 
occurred in Study GCT3013-05 after data lock and was also included in the SCS.  Three medication 
errors resulted in accidental overdoses, 2 with a priming dose and 1 with a full dose of 24 mg.  The 
patient who experienced a medication error in Study GCT3013-05 also experienced non-serious AEs of 
headache and chills on Study Day 2, which resolved without treatment.  There have been no reports of 
overdose due to medication errors for epcoritamab that directly caused life-threatening events or
death.

SVII.3.1
Presentation of Important Identified Risks and 
Important Potential Risks
Important Identified Risk 1:  Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS)
MedDRA terms: Preferred Term (PT) Cytokine release syndrome
Potential Mechanisms:
Activation of the T-cells upon binding to CD3 simultaneous with CD20 binding with release of granzymes 
and cytokines will induce lysis of the cells in close proximity (ie, the CD20 expressing cell).  Available 
clinical safety data from compounds and drugs engaging with T-cell as the mode of action draw 
attention to CRS as a frequent adverse event (AE).  The pathophysiology of CRS is incompletely 
understood.  Interleukin 6 (IL-6) seems to hold a key role in CRS pathophysiology since highly elevated 
IL-6 levels are seen in patients with CRS and in animal models (Shimabukuro-Vornhagen 2018).
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence:
Most frequent AE across epcoritamab clinical trials and literature (Salvaris 2021)

CRS Grading was based on ASTCT consensus criteria (Lee 2019).
Most CRS events occurred during the first cycle of treatment, with the highest incidence occurring after 
the first full dose administration of epcoritamab, which correlates with the overall median time to first 
CRS onset of 16 days.  CRS events were generally grade 1 or 2.  For LBCL, 4 subjects (2.4%) had 
grade 3 events and no grade 4 events.  One subject with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) in the All B-NHL 
group had grade 4 CRS. There were no grade 5 CRS events.  Median time to CRS event resolution was 
3.0 days.
Risk Factors and Risk Groups:
No risk factors and no risk groups have been identified in epcoritamab clinical trials.  Risks identified in 
literature include but are not limited to: high disease burden, preexisting thrombocytopenia and 
endothelial activation, lymphodepleting therapy with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, previous 
cardiovascular disease or organ dysfunction (Salvaris 2021, Schubert 2021, Xiao 2021).  Children seem 
to be at a higher risk of developing CRS than adults (Shimabukuro-Vornhagen 2018).
Preventability:
Mitigation strategies include dose titration (step up dosing including a priming and an intermediate 
dose), prophylaxis with corticosteroids, and monitoring.  Patients should be monitored for signs and 
symptoms of CRS following epcoritamab administration as described in the product label. At the first 
signs of symptoms of CRS, treatment of supportive care with tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids should 
be instituted as indicated in the product label.  Patients should be advised to contact their healthcare 
professional and seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms associated with CRS occur 
at any time.  Management of CRS may require either temporary delay or discontinuation of epcoritamab 
based on the severity of CRS.
Detailed information and guidance to mitigate the risk (including dose titration, prophylaxis, and 
monitoring measures) are provided in the product label and additional risk minimization measure
(Patient Card) targeted to patients.

Version 1.4 / Data Lock Point 31 January 2022
Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product:
CRS is generally manageable with appropriate preventative measures and guidance on management, as 
well as subject monitoring, dose delays, and/or supportive care. Failure to respond to supportive care 
could lead to serious life-threatening or fatal CRS events.
Public Health Impact:
As oncologists are experienced in identifying and treating CRS, the public health impact is considered to 
be low.
Important Identified Risk 2:  Immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome 
(ICANS)
MedDRA terms: PT Immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome
Potential Mechanisms:
Exact mechanism is unknown. One proposed mechanism is the release of neurotoxic cytokines and 
chemokines by activated T cells en route to the CNS, causing inflammation at the neuroendothelium 
(Salvaris 2021, Stein 2019).  Clinical data from compounds targeting CD19 and CD3, or CAR T-cells 
targeting CD19 report neurotoxicity (ICANS) as a frequent AE.  Whether this is related to CD19, to CD3 
or both as targets is unknown.

Epcoritamab
EU Risk Management Plan
Version 1.4 / Data Lock Point 31 January 2022
ICANS was reported in approximately 6% of subjects in any group. For LBCL, 6.0% (10/167) of 
subjects experienced ICANS (all of the events were considered treatment-related) with most of the 
events either grade 1 (4.2%; 7 subjects) or grade 2 (1.2%; 2 subjects) and no grade 3 or 4 events.
One (0.6%) subject had a fatal ICANS event (grade 5). The median time to onset was 16.5 days from 
initiation of epcoritamab.  The ICANS event resolved in 9 of 10 subjects, with a median time to 
resolution of 5 days.  The onset of ICANS can be concurrent with CRS, following resolution of CRS or in 
the absence of CRS. 
Risk Factors and Risk Groups:
No risk factors and no risk groups were identified in epcoritamab clinical trials.  Risks identified in 
literature include but are not limited to: Early and severe CRS with high levels of inflammatory 
cytokines, high disease burden, preexisting thrombocytopenia and endothelial activation, 
lymphodepleting therapy with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, preexisting neurologic 
comorbidities (Schubert 2021, Xiao 2021).
Preventability:
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of ICANS following epcoritamab administration as 
described in the product label.  At the first signs or symptoms of ICANS, treatment should be instituted 
as indicated in the product label.  Patients should be counseled on the signs and symptoms of ICANS
and that the onset of event may be delayed, and instructed to contact their healthcare professional and 
seek immediate medical attention if signs and symptoms occur at any time. Epcoritamab should be 
delayed or discontinued as recommended in the product label.
Detailed information and guidance to mitigate the risk (including dose titration, prophylaxis, and 
monitoring measures) is provided in the product label and additional risk minimization measure (Patient 
Card) targeted to patients.
Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product:
ICANS is generally manageable with appropriate preventative measures and guidance on management, 
as well as subject monitoring, dose delays, and/or supportive care.  Failure to respond to supportive 
care could lead to serious life-threatening or fatal ICANS events.
Public Health Impact:
As oncologists are experienced in identifying and treating ICANS following available guidelines 
(Lee 2019), the public health impact is considered to be low.

Epcoritamab
EU Risk Management Plan
Version 1.4 / Data Lock Point 31 January 2022
Important Identified Risk 3:  Serious Infections
MedDRA terms: System Organ Class Infections and Infestations (serious events)
Potential Mechanisms:
Epcoritamab can cause immunomodulation of B- and T-cell interactions, B-cell depletion and 
subsequently hypogammaglobulinemia.  Additionally, cytopenias observed during epcoritamab treatment 
may cause an increased risk of serious infections.
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence:
Epcoritamab clinical trials and literature (Longhitano 2021, Salvaris 2021)
Characterization of the Risk:
Patients with NHL have an increased risk of infection due to the underlying disease severity, and the risk 
varies based on the extent of disease, presence of cytopenias, use of cytotoxic agents, hematopoietic 
cell transplantation, and/or prophylactic anti-infectives.  Aggressive NHL may result in T-cell defects, 
impacting both innate and cellular immunity.
Bispecific antibodies have been associated with the development of cytopenias, and neutropenia and 
lymphopenia are established risk factors for infection.  Bispecific antibodies may also be associated with 
reduced levels of immunoglobulins, specifically hypogammaglobulinemia has been associated with an 
increased risk of infection (Longhitano 2021).

For LBCL, serious TEAEs of infection were reported in 16.2% and fatal TEAEs in 2.4% of subjects; none 
of the fatal TEAEs were assessed as related to epcoritamab.  The most frequently reported serious TEAEs 
of infection (reported for 2 or more subjects) included pneumonia in 2.4%, sepsis in 2.4%, COVID-19 in 
1.8%, COVID-19 pneumonia in 1.8%, and cellulitis in 1.8% of subjects and 2 subjects (1.2%) each with 
bacteremia, septic shock, and upper respiratory tract infection.  Fatal TEAEs of infection included 
COVID-19 in 1.2%, COVID-19 pneumonia in 0.6% and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in 
0.6% of subjects.

Epcoritamab
EU Risk Management Plan
Version 1.4 / Data Lock Point 31 January 2022
Risk Factors and Risk Groups:
No risk factors and no risk groups were identified in epcoritamab clinical trials.  The epidemiology and 
risks for infections amongst patients managed with bispecific antibodies remain unclear 
(Longhitano 2021).
Infections are more common in patients with advanced stage of disease, prolonged leukopenia, low 
granulocyte count, lymphopenia, hypogammaglobulinemia, defective monocytes, reduced serum 
complement levels, longer length of disease, steroid use, bone marrow transplant recipients, and 
renal dysfunction.
Patients with CRS are at a high risk of infection and the immunosuppressive treatment that is 
administered for the treatment of CRS can mask some of the signs of infection thereby delaying 
diagnosis and treatment of infections.  The mechanism that is responsible for the increased incidence of 
infection in patients with CRS is unknown (Longhitano 2021, Shimabukuro-Vornhagen 2018).
Preventability:
Administration of epcoritamab should be avoided in patients with clinically significant active systemic 
infections.  As appropriate, prophylactic antimicrobials should be administered prior to and during 
treatment with epcoritamab.  Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infections before 
and after epcoritamab administration, and treated appropriately. In the event of febrile neutropenia, 
patient should be evaluated for infection and managed with antibiotics, fluids, and other supportive care, 
according to local guidelines.
Detailed information and guidance to mitigate the risk (including prophylaxis and monitoring measures) 
is provided in the product label.
Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product:
Infections are generally manageable following standard guidelines for supportive care. Failure to 
respond to supportive care could lead to serious life-threatening or fatal infections.
Public Health Impact:
As oncologists are experienced in identifying and treating infections, the public health impact is 
considered to be low.

Epcoritamab
EU Risk Management Plan
Version 1.4 / Data Lock Point 31 January 2022
Important Potential Risk 1:  Risk of overdose due to medication errors
MedDRA terms: SMQ Medication Errors (Broad)
Potential Mechanisms:
The product must be diluted prior to administration of the priming and intermediate doses and re-priming 
may be necessary following delays in therapy.  Potential medication errors leading to overdose could occur 
in the prescribing, preparation, dispensing, and administration of epcoritamab.
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence:
Epcoritamab clinical trials
Characterization of the Risk:
Potential events of overdose due to medication errors may occur with the administration of epcoritamab.  
A total of 3 medication errors occurred in the epcoritamab clinical program and were included in the SCS 
(2 in Study GCT3013-01 and 1 in Study GCT3013-02 [originally ascribed to Study GCT3013-04]). An 
additional medication error occurred in Study GCT3013-05 after data lock and was also included in the 
SCS.  Three medication errors resulted in accidental overdoses, 2 with a priming dose and 1 with a full 
dose of 24 mg.  The patient who experienced a medication error in Study GCT3013-05 also experienced 
non-serious AEs of headache and chills on Study Day 2, which resolved without treatment.  There have 
been no reports of overdose due to medication error for epcoritamab that directly caused life-threatening 
events or death.
Risk Factors and Risk Groups:
No risk factors and no risk groups were identified in epcoritamab clinical trials.
Preventability:
To mitigate the risk of overdose due to medication errors with epcoritamab, comprehensive instructions
for dosing schedule, dilution, preparation, and administration procedures are provided in the product 
labeling.
Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product:
The causes for these overdoses due to medication errors are not related to the product quality and 
usually can be avoided if the approved prescribing instruction for dilution, preparation, and 
administration is strictly followed. The benefit-risk balance remains positive.
Public Health Impact:
As none of the AEs reported in the overdoses due to medication error cases were life-threatening or 
fatal, the public health impact is considered to be low.

Epcoritamab
EU Risk Management Plan
Version 1.4 / Data Lock Point 31 January 2022
Study Design:
This is an open-label, randomized (1:1), global, Phase 3 trial of epcoritamab vs prespecified IC
of chemotherapy in subjects with R/R DLBCL who failed or are ineligible for ASCT.  Eligible 
subjects will be randomized to either epcoritamab or IC of R-GemOx or BR; prior to 
randomization, the investigator must select and document reason for the intended choice of 
chemotherapy (which the subject will receive if randomized to the investigator choice); no 
change in chemotherapy is permitted for an individual subject during the active treatment 
phase of the trial.  Randomization will be stratified by number of prior lines of therapy (1 vs 
> 1), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (0 to 1 vs 2), prior ASCT (yes 
vs no), and prior CAR T cell therapy (yes vs no).
Approximately 480 subjects (240 in each arm) will be enrolled in the trial with a primary 
endpoint of OS.  An interim analysis will occur after approximately 180 deaths have occurred 
overall. An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will assess safety and efficacy 
data during the trial, according to the IDMC Charter.
Study Population:
Approximately 480 subjects aged 18 years or older with R/R DLBCL who failed a previous ASCT
or are ineligible for ASCT at screening will be enrolled.  The number of subjects with only 
1 prior therapy will be capped at approximately 120 subjects (approximately 25% of total 
enrollment).
Milestones:
Study is ongoing.  Primary analysis CSR (including final OS analysis) planned for Quarter 4 of 
2024 and final CSR planned for Quarter 1 of 2029.
Planned safety data to be included in the final CSR:
● Incidence of the following AEs: CRS, serious infections, and ICANS, and other AEs 
such as: injection site reactions, neutropenia/cytopenia, neurological events, 
CTLS, and tumor flares.
● Comparative safety data analysis
● Safety analysis for patients with prior CAR-T

Additional Risk Minimization Measures
Additional Risk Minimization 1:
Patient Card
A Patient Card targeted to patients treated with epcoritamab will be implemented to minimize 
the important identified risks of CRS and ICANS.
Objectives:
● The objective of the Patient Card is to minimize the risk of CRS and ICANS by:
○ Increasing patient awareness of CRS and ICANS
○ Providing information on signs and symptoms of CRS and ICANS
48
Epcoritamab
EU Risk Management Plan
Version 1.4 / Data Lock Point 31 January 2022
○ Alerting patients to promptly contact their HCPs/emergency care if they 
observe any of the signs or symptoms of CRS and ICANS
○ Alerting HCPs treating the patient at any time, including in conditions of 
emergency, that the patient is using epcoritamab.
Rationale for the Additional Risk Minimization Activity:
A Patient Card is considered necessary to communicate to patients the risk of CRS and ICANS 
and to describe CRS and ICANS signs and symptoms to prompt patient actions to seek 
immediate medical attention in case of their occurrence.  The Patient Card will also include 
information for any HCP providing care (including emergency) so the patient can be evaluated 
and treated for CRS and ICANS in a timely manner.
Target Audience and Planned Distribution Path:
Target audience includes all patients using epcoritamab.  The Patient Card will be available in 
print or electronically. The Patient Card will be disseminated to HCPs who would then 
distribute the Patient Card to patients who are prescribed epcoritamab.  Depending on local 
regulations or competent authority guidance, additional methods of distribution may also be 
applied to ensure all patients will receive the Patient Card in a timely manner.  HCPs will be 
provided information on how to request additional Patient Cards.
Plans to Evaluate the Effectiveness of the Interventions and Criteria for Success:
None.

Summary of the Risk Management Plan
Summary of Risk Management Plan for Epcoritamab
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for epcoritamab.  The RMP details 
important risks of epcoritamab, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information 
will be obtained about epcoritamab risks and uncertainties (missing information).
Epcoritamab's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to health care professionals (HCPs) and patients on how epcoritamab should be
used.
This summary of the RMP for epcoritamab should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all of which 
are part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
epcoritamab's RMP.
I
The Medicine and What it Is Used For
Epcoritamab as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or 
refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after 2 or more lines of systemic 
therapy (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains epcoritamab as the active substance and 
it is given by subcutaneous injection.
Further information about the evaluation of epcoritamab's benefits can be found in 
Epcoritamab's EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, 
under the medicine's webpage.

II
Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities 
to Minimize or Further Characterize the Risks
Important risks of epcoritamab, together with measures to minimize such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about epcoritamab risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
● Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and HCPs;
● Important advice on the medicine's packaging;
● The authorized pack size – the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly;
● The medicine's legal status – the way a medicine is supplied to the patient 
(eg, with or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.
In the case of epcoritamab, these measures are supplemented with additional risk 
minimization measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below.
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analyzed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary.  These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.
If important information that may affect the safe use of epcoritamab is not yet available, it is 
listed under "missing information" below.
II.A
List of Important Risks and Missing Information
Important risks of epcoritamab are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
administered.  Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks are 
concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of epcoritamab.  Potential 
risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on 
available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation.  
Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is 
currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

Summary of Important Risks
Important identified risk: CRS
Evidence for linking the risk to 
Most frequent AE across epcoritamab clinical trials and literature
the medicine
(Salvaris 2021).
Risk factors and risk groups
No risk factors and no risk groups were identified in epcoritamab 
trials.  Risks identified in literature include but not limited to: High 
disease burden, preexisting thrombocytopenia and endothelial 
activation, lymphodepleting therapy with fludarabine and
cyclophosphamide, previous cardiovascular disease or organ 
dysfunction (Schubert 2021, Xiao 2021).  Children seem to be at a 
higher risk of developing CRS than adults (Shimabukuro-Vornhagen 
2018).

Important identified risk: Serious Infections
Evidence for linking the risk to 
Epcoritamab clinical trials and literature (Longhitano 2021, 
the medicine
Salvaris 2021)
Risk factors and risk groups
No risk factors and no risk groups were identified in epcoritamab 
trials.  The epidemiology and risks for infections amongst patients 
managed with bispecific antibodies remain unclear
(Longhitano 2021).
Infections are more common in patients with advanced stage of 
disease, prolonged leukopenia, hypogammaglobulinemia, low 
granulocyte count, defective monocytes, reduced serum 
complement levels, longer length of disease, steroid use, bone 
marrow transplant recipients, and renal dysfunction.
Patients with CRS are at a high risk of infection and the 
immunosuppressive treatment that is administered for the 
treatment of CRS can mask some of the signs of infection thereby 
delaying diagnosis and treatment of infections.  The mechanism that 
is responsible for the increased incidence of infection in patients 
with CRS is unknown (Longhitano 2021, Shimabukuro-Vornhagen 
2018).

Key messages of the additional risk minimization measure
Additional risk minimization measure to minimize the important identified risks of CRS and 
ICANS consist of a Patient Card targeted to patients treated with epcoritamab.
Prior to the launch of epcoritamab in each Member State the Marketing Authorisation Holder 
(MAH) must agree about the content and format of the patient card, including communication 
media, distribution modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with the National 
Competent Authority.
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where epcoritamab is marketed, HCPs who 
are expected to prescribe epcoritamab and patients treated with epcoritamab have access 
to/are provided with the Patient Card which will inform and explain to patients the risks of CRS 
and ICANS.
The Patient Card will contain the following key messages:
● Provide information on signs/symptoms of CRS and ICANS
● Alert patients to promptly contact their HCPs/emergency care if they observe any 
of the signs or symptoms of CRS and ICANS
● A warning message for HCPs treating the patient at any time, including in 
conditions of emergency, that the patient is using epcoritamab.
● Contact details of the epcoritamab prescriber

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for bortezomib, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data from the literature and spontaneous reports including, in some cases, a close 
temporal relationship, positive de-challenge and in view of a plausible mechanism of action supporting 
the known neurotoxicity of bortezomib, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between bortezomib and 
Guillain-Barrè Syndrome and Demyelinating polyneuropathy is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC 
concluded that the product information of products containing bortezomib should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for bortezomib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing bortezomib is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

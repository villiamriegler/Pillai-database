2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Aplastic anemia is a life-threatening bone marrow disease characterised by tri-lineage marrow hypoplasia 
and lack of hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSCP), due to immune-mediated attack on the bone 
marrow. Aplastic anemia is characterised as "severe" (SAA) based on hypocellular bone marrow below 
30% and pancytopenia, with at least 2 of the following: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 500/μL; 
platelet counts < 20x103/μL; reticulocytes < 20x103/μL (or < 60x103/μL via automated counter). 
The MAH initially applied for the following indication: “Revolade in combination with standard 
immunosuppressive therapy for the first-line treatment of adult and paediatric patients 2 years and older 
with severe aplastic anemia.” 
During the initial application, the MAH changed the proposed indication to adult and paediatric patients 
aged 12 years and above.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Aplastic anemia is a rare disease, with an annual incidence of approximately 2 cases per million people 
and with a higher incidence in East-Asian countries (about 4-7 cases per million). There is no significant 
difference in incidence between men and women. The incidence has a biphasic age distribution with peaks 
from 10 to 25 years and above 60 years. Reported incidence in children and adolescent per million was 
1.7 in the group of 0 to 14 years and 2.2 in 15 to 24 years.

EMA/CHMP/620491/2019 
Page 7/162 
 
  
  
 
 
 
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis 
SAA is recognised as a chronic disease with frequent flares of the immune process and the need for long-
term immunosuppression. There is evidence that depletion of primitive hematopoietic stem and 
progenitor cells is profound, demonstrating that immune attack against the most primitive stem cells is 
paramount. Even with recovery of blood counts following successful immunosuppressive therapy (IST), a 
significant quantitative stem cell defect persists, suggesting either ongoing immune destruction or 
persistent depletion of stem cells. 
2.1.4.  Management 
The first-line treatment of choice is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for those 
who are eligible and have an available donor; it is the preferred option when feasible as it is curative. Yet 
less than 30% of subjects are suitable candidates for optimal HSCT because of a lack of a matched sibling 
donor, the lead time to identify a suitable unrelated donor, age, comorbidities, or access to 
transplantation. 
For subjects who are not suitable candidates for HSCT, IST is the therapy of choice worldwide. Rosenfeld 
et al reported that approximately half of subjects with SAA treated with an IST regimen of h-ATG + CsA 
had a durable recovery and an excellent long-term survival, and these outcomes were related to the 
quality of the hematologic recovery. Recent survival analyses support ATG + CsA vs. transplantation as 
the first-line therapy in subjects over 40 years. The IST regimen of choice is h-ATG for 4 days + CsA for 6 
months.  
The outcomes remain poor for subjects who have an insufficient response or relapse, and approximately 
40% of unresponsive subjects die within 5 years of diagnosis. Although h-ATG + CsA represented a major 
advance in the treatment of SAA, incomplete responses, relapses, and primary refractoriness limit the 
success of this therapy. Intensification of the IST with other immunosuppressive agents including r-ATG, 
alemtuzumab, or high dose cyclophosphamide or with the addition of sirolimus or mycophenolate to IST, 
do not improve the response rates. Thus, other regimens are needed to address these limitations and 
provide an alternative to stem cell transplantation. 
About the product 
Eltrombopag  is  an  orally  bioavailable,  small-molecule  thrombopoietin  (TPO)-receptor  agonist  that 
interacts  with  the  transmembrane  domain  of  the  human  TPO-receptor  and  initiates  signalling  cascades 
that  induce  proliferation  and  differentiation  from  bone  marrow  progenitor  cells.  Eltrombopag  has  been 
investigated in multiple clinical development programs and it is currently approved in the European Union 
for use in chronic immune thrombocytopenia, chronic hepatitis C virus associated thrombocytopenia and 
refractory severe aplastic anemia. 
Revolade is currently authorised for the following indications: 
•  Revolade is indicated for the treatment of patients aged 1 year and above with primary immune 
thrombocytopenia (ITP) lasting 6 months or longer from diagnosis and who are refractory to other 
treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins) (see sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC). 
•  Revolade  is  indicated  in  adult  patients  with  chronic  hepatitis  C  virus  (HCV)  infection  for  the 
treatment  of  thrombocytopenia,  where  the  degree  of  thrombocytopenia  is  the  main  factor 
preventing the initiation or limiting the ability to maintain optimal interferon-based therapy (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620491/2019 
Page 8/162 
 
  
  
 
•  Revolade  is  indicated  in  adult  patients  with  acquired  severe  aplastic  anaemia  (SAA)  who  were 
either refractory to prior immunosuppressive therapy or heavily pretreated and are unsuitable for 
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (see section 5.1 of the SmPC). 
The  purpose  of  this  submission  is  to  seek  approval  for  the  use  of  eltrombopag  in  combination  with 
standard immunosuppressive therapy for the first-line treatment of adult and paediatric patients 2 years 
and older with severe aplastic anemia.  
The clinical summary documents supporting this submission focus primarily on findings from the pivotal 
Study AUS01T, a single center, single arm, non-randomized, Phase I/II trial investigating the efficacy and 
safety  of  horse  antithymocyte  globulin  (h-ATG)  +  cyclosporine  in  combination  with  eltrombopag  as 
experimental  therapy  in  patients  with  severe  aplastic  anemia  who  have  not  received  prior  definitive 
immunosuppressive therapy.  
Supportive data from other clinical trials in aplastic anemia included in the dossier are:  
-  Study  E1201,  a  Novartis-sponsored  trial  in  treatment-refractory  Japanese  patients  provides 
supportive data for safety evaluation 
-  Study  AUS28T  and  Study  AUS18T,  the  pivotal  and  supportive  trials,  respectively,  filed  to  gain 
approval in the refractory severe aplastic anemia population provide supportive safety data on the 
development of cytogenetic abnormalities 
-  Study  E1202,  a  Novartis-sponsored  trial  in  treatment-naïve  Japanese  patients  with  moderate 
aplastic  anemia  or  severe  aplastic  anemia  and  PA17-0265/  Kadia  et  al  2015,  an  investigator-
initiated  trial  in  treatment-naïve  patients  diagnosed  with  aplastic  anemia  provide  independent 
substantiation of the results from Study AUS01T.  
-  Studies  06-H-0034,  03-H-0193,  90-H-0146,  and  97-H-0117,  four  historical  trials  evaluating  h-
ATG  +  cyclosporine  in  patients  with  severe  aplastic  anemia  provide  a  safety  and  efficacy 
reference against which the data from Study AUS01T has been compared  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
However, a revised environmental risk assessment report has been submitted of eltrombopag tablets and 
powder for oral suspension product addressing the following initially applied indication: 
“Revolade in combination with standard immunosuppressive therapy for the first-line treatment of adult 
and paediatric patients 2 years and older with severe aplastic anemia.” 
The maximum recommended dose for severe aplastic anemia is 150 mg once daily. 
2.2.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Phase I ERA: Estimation of exposure 
•  Screening for Persistence, Bioaccumulation and Toxicity (PBT) 
As  part  of  the  screening  for  persistence,  bioaccumulation  and  toxicity,  the  MAH  provided  log10POW 
(>4.52).  The  octanol-water  partition  coefficient  (POW)  has  been  estimated  at  pH  5,  7  and  9  and  20  ºC 
using “Shake Flask Method” according to the OECD 107. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620491/2019 
Page 9/162 
 
  
  
 
As the log10Pow value is > 4.5 at pH 7, there is requirement to screen eltrombopag olamine for PBT. 
In  agreement  with  OSPAR,  the  PBT/vPvB  assessment  is  required  since  the  estimated  log  KOW  value  is 
clearly above the cut-off of 4.5. 
•  Calculation of the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) 
 PECSURFACEWATER  was  calculated  and  was  above  the  trigger  value  for  proceeding  on  to  Phase  II 
assessment.  
10 mg/inhabitant/day x 0.01 
PECSURFACEWATER = 
200 L/inhabitant/day x 10 
= 0.00075 mg/L= 0.75 μg/L 
The  predicted  environmental  concentration  (PEC)  is  given  by  the  formula  proposed  in  guideline 
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00  corr  2  and  is  calculated  as  the  sum  of  all  PECs  for  all  indications  for  which 
eltrombopag is applied:  
PECsurfacewater = (DOSEai * Fpen) / (WASTEWinhab * DILUTION)  
= (75 mg/inhabitant/day * 0.01) / (200 L/inhabitant/day * 10)  
= 0.000375 mg/L = 0.375 µg/L for ITP  
PECsurface water = (DOSEai * Fpen) / (WASTEWinhab * DILUTION)  
= (100 mg/inhabitant/day * 0.01) / (200 L/inhabitant/day * 10)  
= 0.0005 mg/L = 0.5 µg/L for cHCV associated thrombocytopenia  
PECsurface water = (DOSEai * Fpen) / (WASTEWinhab * DILUTION)  
= (150 mg/inhabitant/day * 0.01) / (200 L/inhabitant/day * 10)  
= 0.00075 mg/L = 0.75 µg/L for SAA 
Overall PECsurface water = 0.375 µg/L + 0.5 µg/L + 0.75 µg/L = 1.625 µg/L  
Where:  
DOSEai = 75 mg/patient/day for ITP;  
= 100 mg/patient/day for cHCV associated thrombocytopenia  
= 150 mg/patient/day for 6 months for SAA  
Fpen = 1% (default)  
WASTEWinhab = 200 L/inhabitant/day  
DILUTION = 10  
The  overall  predicted  environmental  concentration  (PEC),  taking  into  account  all  indications,  is  1.625 
µg/L, which exceeds the trigger value of 0.01 µg/L.

Tier A- Initial environmental fate and effects 
•  Physico-chemical properties and fate 
Biodegradation 
The inherent ultimate biodegradability of eltrombopag was assessed under standard test conditions. The 
procedure  followed  was  based  upon  the  OECD  guideline  302C  Modified  MITI  Test  (II).  The  primary 
biodegradation was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. The results 
from  the  carbon  dioxide  evolution  data  indicated  that  eltrombopag  attained  a  mean  biodegradation  of 
14%  calculated  from  oxygen  consumption  values  on  Day  28.  Results  from  the  compound  specific 
analysis showed that there was a loss of parent compound equivalent to 10% primary biodegradation of 
eltrombopag  on  Day  28.  It  can  be  concluded  that  eltrombopag  is  neither  readily  nor  inherently 
biodegradable in aqueous biodegradation tests. 
Adsorption / Desorption 
As discussed in the Type II variation for HCV, eltrombopag was initially investigated for determination of 
activated sludge sorption isotherm according to OPPTS 835.1110 (Report SD2006/00091/00). However, 
no determination of the isotherm was possible in this study. This was due to the instability of the test 
material  in  aqueous  solution  at  a  concentration  and  pH  relevant  to  the  fate  of  the  test  material  in  the 
waste  water  treatment  plant.  At  the  time  it  was  not  possible  to  overcome  these  technical  challenges 
and,  therefore,  it  was  concluded  that  those  physico-chemical  characteristics  of  eltrombopag  that 
contributed  to  the  failure  of  this  study  were  the  same  as  those  which  would  likely  give  rise  to  a  Koc 
value for eltrombopag of greater than 10’000 L/kg ostensibly triggering the need for a Phase II Tier  B 
analysis  in  soil.  However,  since  this  submission  it  was  found  that  another  CRO  with  better  analytical 
capabilities  was  able  to  conduct  a  soil/sludge  adsorption  study  (OECD  106)  with  eltrombopag.  In  this 
study,  the  adsorption  and  desorption  of  eltrombopag  was  determined  in  three  soils  and  two  municipal 
sewage sludges using the batch equilibrium method according to the OECD test guideline no. 106. The 
following soils/sludges were used: soil I (Speyer 2.3; sandy loam), soil II (Hagenthal; silt loam), soil III 
(Mechtildshausen;  loam),  sludge  I  (Füllinsdorf)  and  sludge  II  (Sissach).  In  order  to  limit  microbial 
degradation  of  the  test  item  during  the  experiment,  all  soils  and  both  sludge  were  treated  by  γ-
irradiation before use. 
Adsorption kinetics were determined for a soil/sludge-to-solution ratio of 1/100 (1 g soil to 100 mL 0.01 
M  CaCl2)  and  a  test  item  concentration  of  0.027  μg/mL.  For  all  soils  and  sludge  species,  the  level  of 
adsorption (adsorbed fraction of applied) almost reached equilibrium after 48 hours of agitation due to 
its  high  adsorption.  The  fraction  of  adsorption  after  48  hours  was  94.1%,  92.7%  and  94.6%  of  the 
applied  radioactivity  for  soils  I  to  III,  respectively  and  95.8%  and  95.5%  for  sludge  I  and  II, 
respectively.  The  mass  balance,  determined  for  all  soils/sludge  after  48  hours  of  adsorption,  showed 
overall mean recoveries of 99.9%, 104.4% and 105.4% for the soils and 113.3% and 108.8% for both 
sludges, respectively. The higher recoveries in both sludge species are due to the high amount of non-
extractable  radioactivity  in  comparison  to  the  soils  and  the  small  amount  of  material  combusted.  The 
mean Koc adsorption value for the soils is 132,556 mL/g and 8,119 mL/g for the sludge. The adsorption 
showed to be independent of the cation exchange capacity, organic carbon or clay content of the soils. A 
slight dependence of the adsorption from the pH could be observed. Desorption kinetics were followed 2, 
5,  24  and  48  hours  after  the  48  hours  adsorption  period.  Very  little  desorption  was  observed  for  all 
soils/sludge  throughout  the  experiment.  The  percent  of  the  desorbed  radioactivity  amounted  to  3.5%, 
2.6%,  2.5%,  0.9%  and  0.9%  of  adsorbed  for  soils  I,  II,  III  and  sludge  I  and  II,  respectively  after  48 
hours of desorption. The mean Koc desorption value for the soils was 302,493 mL/g and 30,492 mL/g 
for the sludge.

The route and rate of degradation of [14C]eltrombopag olamine in two aquatic systems (river and pond) 
under  aerobic  conditions  were  investigated  at  20  ºC  in  the  dark.  [14C]eltrombopag  olamine  dissipated 
from  the  water  phase  mainly  due  to  rapid  degradation  and  dissipation  into  the  sediment  layer.  In  the 
water  phase  eltrombopag  olamine  immediately  degraded  to  transformation  product  M4  with  the  DT50 
reached  immediately  after  application.  The  immediate  transformation/degradation  of  eltrombopag 
olamine  in  the  water  phase  is  proposed  to  be  driven  by  abiotic  processes,  as  the  dilute  biomass 
associated  with  ‘competent’degraders  would  be  too  reduced  to  cause  such  an  abrupt  biotic  change. 
The  rapid  dissipation  of  [14C]eltrombopag  olamine  from  the  aqueous  phase  led  to  a  subsequent 
accumulation in the sediment compartment. Between 10 and 20% degradation was observed after 106 
days exposure. Eltrombopag olamine is very persistent considering the DT50 values of >1000 d at 12ºC 
in total system and the DT50 values of 653 and 3244 d at 12ºC in sediment.  
The criterion for sediment studies is met if more that 10% of the substance at any time point after or at 
14 days is present in sediment. The transformation product M 4 occurs in concentrations of 8.4 and 4.9 
% in sediment at study end (day 106) starting with concentrations of 21.2% and 27.4% at day 0. Thus 
TP  M  4  cannot  be  considered  as  transient.  Eltrombopag  was  exposed  to  UV  light  and  measurement  of 
light  absorption  revealed  that  this  substance  does  exhibit  significant  absorption  above  290  nm 
suggesting that degradation via direct photolysis may be a viable environmental depletion mechanism.

•  Calculation of Predicted No-Effect Concentration (PNEC) using assessment factors 
Based  on  the  generated  effect  data  the  MAH  carried  out  the  risk  characterisation  in  Tier  A  of  the 
environmental risk assessment. In order to assess the risk to the aquatic environment it is required to 
calculate  the  PEC/PNEC  ratios.  Therefore  the  predicted  no  effect  concentration  (PNEC)  has  to  be 
deduced from the NOEC values of the effects studies. In compliance with the guideline on environmental 
risk assessment the PNEC is calculated by applying an assessment factor (AF) to the no observed effect 
concentrations  (NOEC)  from  relevant  effect  studies.  A  default  assessment  factor  of  10  is  applied  to 
calculate the PNEC from the long-term toxicity test and the 10 to calculate anti-microbial effect study. 
PNECWATER = 52 μg/L /10 = 5.20 μg/L (based on lowest NOEC from all three trophic levels). 
PNECMICROORGANISM = 32,000 μg/L /10 = 3,200 μg/L (based on NOEC from Activate Sludge Respiration 
Inhibition study). 
PNECGROUNDWATER = 120 μg/L /10 = 12 μg/L (based on Daphnia magna repro NOEC) 
•  Calculation of refined PECsurfacewater 
The  PECSURFACEWATER  has  been  refined  as  the  sum  all  of  each  indication,  based  on  prevalence  of  the 
diseases  and  treatment  regimens.  The  new  value  has  been  considered  for  the  PEC/PNEC  ratios 
calculation. 
The  Tier  A  PEC  is  based  on  the  “total  residue  approach”,  neglecting  depletion  by  biotic  and  abiotic 
processes. The Phase II Tier A PECsurface  water has been calculated using epidemiological data for all 
currently  registered  and  newly  applied  for  indications,  i.e.  cHCVaT,  SAA,  cITP  and  first  line  SAA  (total 
PEC)  based  on  the  assumption  that  100%  of  drug  substance  used  enters  the  sewage  treatment  plant 
unchanged and passes through into the aquatic environment.  
Immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder characterised by autoantibody-
induced  platelet  destruction  and  reduced  platelet  production,  leading  to  a  chronically  low  peripheral 
blood  platelet  count  (<150,000/µL).  As  indicated  by  the  term  ‘idiopathic’,  the  exact  etiology  of  ITP  is 
unknown.  Anti-platelet  antibodies  are  thought  to  play  a  role  in  mediating  destruction  of  platelets,  and 
may impede the generation of platelets in the bone marrow. The prevalence of ITP in the population is 
known  to  be  very  low.  As  laid  out  in  the  latest  EU  Safety  Risk  Management  Plan  for  eltrombopag  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620491/2019 
Page 15/162 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
prevalence of ITP in the EU is estimated to be 2.1 in 100,000 inhabitants.  
Chronic  hepatitis  C  (cHCV)  infection  is  a  serious  disease,  especially  for  those  with  significant 
thrombocytopenia  (<100  Gi/L).  In  this  population,  the  annualised  incidence  rate  for  hepatocellular 
carcinoma  or  clinical  hepatic  decompensation  (ascites,  hepatic  encephalopathy,  variceal  bleeding, 
spontaneous bacterial  peritonitis)  is  approximately  8%.  Every  year  more  than 7%  die  or undergo  liver 
transplantation.  Over  a  5-year  period  1  out  of  4  such  patients  will  die.  The  aetiology  of 
thrombocytopenia in HCV-infected patients is multi-fold and severity correlates with the severity of liver 
disease.  Approximately  20%  of  HCV-infected  individuals  develop  liver  cirrhosis,  with  thrombocytopenia 
as  a  clinical  marker  of  progression  to  more  severe  hepatic  impairment.  Consequently,  low  platelet 
counts  are  predictive of  poorer  outcomes.  Thrombocytopenia  is  also  caused,  or  further  aggravated,  by 
interferon-based  antiviral  therapy  due  to  its  myelosuppressive  effects.  Eltrombopag,  working  as  a 
supporting care agent to increase the platelet count prior to and throughout interferon-based treatment 
of HCV infection initiate and help optimise and maintain the dose and duration of their antiviral therapy, 
improving  the  likelihood  of  achieving  a  sustained  virologic  response  (SVR).  In  Europe,  the  HCV 
prevalence  estimates  show  high  variability  between  countries  ranging  from  ≤  0.5%  in  the  northern 
European countries to ≥ 3% in the Romania and rural areas in Greece, Italy and Russia. The prevalence 
of thrombocytopenia in patients with HCV infection is estimated to be 5.8 %. Based on an EU population 
of  512.596.403  in  January  2018,  these  results  in  891’918  patients  with  cHCV  associated 
thrombocytopenia or a prevalence of 174 in 100’000 for the EU. 
Severe  aplastic  anaemia  (SAA)  is  a  rare,  life-threatening,  acquired  bone  marrow  failure  disease 
characterized by tri-lineage marrow hypoplasia and a lack of haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells 
(HSPC) due to an immune-mediated attack on the bone marrow. There is no standard of care for SAA 
patients with an insufficient response to immunosuppressive therapy who do not have suitable donor for 
bone marrow transplantation.  
For SAA no data on prevalence is available, however, information on incidence with a maximum of 2.54 
cases  in  1  million  people  found  within  the  EU  countries  for  which  information  is  available,  shows  that 
SAA is a very rare disease. In the absence of prevalence data, the market penetration factor for SAA has 
been calculated based on the maximum incidence for this disease for the EU.

Tier B: Extended Environmental Fate and Effects Analysis 
-  Water sediment effects 
The  water-sediment  study  has  shown  that  the  level  of  eltrombopag  in  sediment  at  14  days  is  greater 
than  10%  thereby  exceeding  the  guidance  criterion  for  sediment  studies.  The  toxicity  of  eltrombopag 
was  evaluated  on  the  sediment-dwelling  non-biting  midge  Chironomus  riparius  by  exposure  in  a  static 
sediment-water  test  system  over  a  28-day  period  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  OECD 
Chemicals Testing Guideline No. 218 Sediment-Water Chironomid Toxicity Test Using Spiked Sediment. 
Following a preliminary range-finding test, larvae of Chironomus riparius were exposed in groups of 80 
(four  replicates  of  20  larvae  per  concentration)  to  formulated  sediment  spiked  with  test  item  over  a 
range of concentrations of 100, 180, 320, 560 and 1000 mg/Kg for a period of 28 days. The numbers of 
emerged adult midges were recorded daily. 
Examination  of  the  numbers  of  male  and  female  adults  midges  emerged  showed  no  biological 
significance between the numbers of male and females. Therefore, it was considered that the test item 
had no significant effect on the sex ratio of emerged adults. 
The  toxicity  of  the  test  item  to  the  sediment-dwelling  larvae  of  Chironomus  riparius  has  been 
investigated and based on nominal concentrations gave 28-Day EC15 and EC50 (reduction in emergence) 
of  350  and  690  mg/Kg  respectively.  The  No  Observed  Effect  Concentration  was  560  mg/Kg  and  the 
Lowest  Observed  Effect  Concentration  was  1000  mg/Kg.  The  results  based  on  geometric  mean 
measured  concentrations  gave  28-  Day  EC15  and  EC50  (reduction  in  emergence)  of  66  and  130  mg/Kg 
respectively.  The  No  Observed  Effect  Concentration  was  104  mg/Kg  and  the  Lowest  Observed  Effect 
Concentration  was  185  mg/Kg.  The  28-Day  EC15  and  EC50  (development  rate)  values  were  not 
determined as only -0.4% reduction in development rate was determined for the 560 mg/Kg test group 
(the  highest  concentration  where  development  rate  could  be  calculated).  The  No  Observed  Effect 
Concentration was determined to be 560 mg/Kg (based on nominal concentration and 104 mg/Kg based 
on estimated geometric mean measured concentrations).

from the estimation of the adsorption coefficient in sewage sludge from two sewage treatment plants.

Kpsusp = Focsusp * Kocsoil = 0.1 kgoc/kgsolid * 132’556 L/kg = 13’255.6 L/kgsolid (Equation  
R.16.6) 
Kocsoil = 132’556 ml/g (Average from three soils, i.e. 155’386, 97’529 and 144’754 mL/g) 
Focsusp = 0.1 kgoc/kgsolid (Table 16.9) 
In order to account for the fact that the effect concentration of the sediment toxicity study is expressed 
as  a  dry  weight  concentration,  the  PECsediment  calculated  above,  which  relates  to  wet  sediment  is 
multiplied with a conversion factor of 4.6, resulting in a dry weight PECsediment of 662.96 µg/kg.  
The PNECsediment, based on the NOEC for the development of the sediment-dwelling larvae of Chironomus 
riparius  (Table  5-1)  including  an  assessment  factor  of  100,  is  1’040  µg/L.  The  risk  ratio  for  sediment 
therefore calculates as: 
PEC/PNECsediment = 662.96 µg/kg / 1’040 µg/kg = 0.64 
-  Bioaccumulation 
The  measured  octanol  water  partition  coefficient  (log  Dow,  pH  7  =  4.52)  of  eltrombopag  is  above  3.0 
indicating that eltrombopag could have a tendency to sorb to lipid surfaces and therefore bioaccumulate 
in the tissues of aquatic organisms. 
A  study  was  performed  to  assess  the  bioconcentration  potential  of  the  test  item  in  rainbow  trout 
(Oncorhynchus mykiss). The method followed was that described in the OECD Guideline for the Testing 
of Chemicals (1996) No 305 “Bioconcentration: Flow- Through Fish Test. 
Rainbow trout were exposed, in groups of 52, to an aqueous solution of the test item at concentrations 
of  0.0025  and  0.025  mg/l  for  a  period  of  14  days  under  dynamic  test  conditions.  Samples  of  test  fish 
were  taken  from  the  solvent  control,  0.0025  and  0.025  mg/l  test  groups  on  days  5,  7,  10,  12  and  14 
and the concentration of test item in the fish tissues determined. After 14 days exposure the remaining 
fish were subjected to a depuration period of 10 days. Samples of test fish were taken from the solvent 
control and 0.0025 and 0.025 mg/l test groups on days 3, 5, 7 and 10 of the depuration phase and the 
concentration of test item determined. The Bioconcentration Factors at steady state (BCFss) for the test 
item  based  on  total  radioactivity  in  the  whole  fish  after  14  days  were  calculated  to  be  14  at 
concentrations  of  0.0025  and  0.025  mg/l  (equivalent  to  0.0020  and  0.020  mg/l  as  free  base 
respectively). The Kinetic Bioconcentration Factors (BCFk) were also calculated and were shown to be 29 
at a concentration of 0.0025 mg/l and 16 at a concentration of 0.025 mg/l after 14 days. 
The uptake and depuration rate constants, k1 and k2, were determined to be 4.4148 and 0.1515 for the

0.0025  mg/l  test  concentration  and  3.0805  and  0.1957  for  the  0.025  mg/l  test  concentration.  As  the 
test  item  had  a  log  Kow  of  4.52,  following  the  recommendations  of  the  test  guidelines,  the  BCF  values 
were  also  calculated  as  a  function  of  the  lipid  content.  These  BCF  values  were  higher  than  those 
determined in the whole fish results thereby suggesting that the accumulation of the test item was into 
the  lipid  content  of  the  fish.  However,  as  the  values  were  below  2000,  the  test  item  would  not  be 
classified as bioaccumulative according to the PBT assessment criteria. The Bioconcentration Factors at 
steady state (BCFss) for the test item as a function of lipid content after 14 days was calculated to be 
135  at  concentrations  of  0.0025  and  0.025  mg/l  (equivalent  to  0.0020  and  0.020  mg/l  as  free  base 
respectively). For substances with high lipophilicity (e.g. log Kow >3) the bioconcentration factor should 
be  normalized  to  5%  lipid  content  (based  on  whole  body  wet  weight).  The  “BCF  steady  state” 
recalculated  and  related  to  5%  lipid  content  is  336  and  130  at  concentrations  of  0.0025  and  0.025 
mg/L. The Kinetic Bioconcentration Factors (BCFk) were also calculated and were shown to be 280 at a 
concentration of 0.0025 mg/l and 136 at a concentration of 0.025 mg/l after 14 days.

Eltrombopag olamine was shown not to significantly accumulate in fish tissue. At the end of the 10-Day 
depuration  period  88%  and  85%  of  eltrombopag  olamine  was  eliminated  from  the  fish  tissues  for  the 
0.0025  and  0.025  mg/l  test  concentrations  respectively.  Although  this  was  less  than  the  90% 
elimination detailed in the guideline, it was considered that the results of the test were valid given the 
low  BCF  values  obtained  during  the  study.  Based  on  this  information  the  biological half-life  of  the  test 
item is considered to be between 3 and 10 days.

2.2.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Phase I. Estimation of exposure 
Eltrombopag  has  a  partition  coefficient  greater  than  4.5  (log  Dow  =  4.52).  A  further  PBT  assessment  is 
warranted. A PBT assessment, including a bioconcentration study in fish has been conducted in Phase II-
Tier B of this assessment. 
The predicted environmental concentration (PEC) for eltrombopag is 0.75 μg/L which exceeds the trigger 
value of 0.01 μg/L as given by EMEA (2006) and therefore an environmental assessment Phase II –Tier A 
was  performed.  As  eltrombopag  can  be  prescribed  for  the  treatment  of  more  than  one  indication,  the 
PECsurface  water  has  been  calculated  as  the  sum  all  of  each  indication  PECs.  This  PEC  value  is  1.625  µg/L, 
which exceeds the trigger value of 0.01 µg/L. The assessment therefore proceeds to Phase II – Tier A. 
Phase II Tier A. Environmental fate and effects analysis 
Guideline  on 
the  environmental 
risk  assessment  of  medical  products 
for  human  use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00)  advises  the  Ready  Biodegradability  test  (OECD  301)  instead  of  the  OECD 
302C  performed  by  MAH.  Since  eltrombopag  is  not  considered  biodegradable  and  the  MAH  proposes  to 
perform  a  Tier  B  assessment,  there  is  no  concern  regarding  this  issue.  Eltrombopag  has  been  found  to 
quickly  dissipate  from  the  water  phase  into  the  sediment  (OECD  308).  The  half-life  determined  in  the 
study  on  transformation  in  total  water/sediment  systems  exceeds  120  days,  thus  being  very  persistent 
considering the DT50  values of >1000 d at 12ºC in total system and the DT50 values of 653 and 3244 d at 
12ºC  in  sediment.  Therefore,  an  assessment  for  sediment  has  been  presented  in  Phase  II-Tier  B  of  the 
current environmental risk assessment (OECD 218). Eltrombopag shows a low potential for adsorption to 
sludge (Koc<10000), indicate the unlikely affinity to bind to sewage sludge in the SPT, thus a terrestrial 
assessment  in  Phase  II  Tier  B  is  not  considered  necessary.  Significant  toxicity  to  aquatic  species,  i.e. 
Lemna (OECD 201), Daphnia magna (OECD 211) and fish (OECD 210) has been observed, with the fish 
species  Danio  rerio  (zebra  fish)  being  the  most  sensitive  of  the  aquatic  species  tested.  Based  on  PEC 
values calculated by the MAH, the risk for aquatic organisms in surface water and groundwater as well as 
for microorganisms in activated sludge microorganisms can be considered to be low.  
Phase II Tier B. Extended environmental fate and effects analysis 
A study on toxicity to the sediment-dwelling larvae of Chironomus riparius (OECD 218) was triggered and 
revealed no toxicity. PECSEDIMENT for eltrombopag and the ratio PECSEDIMENT/PNECSEDIMENT were recalculated 
considering  the  PECSURFACEWATER  value  calculated  as  the  sum  all  of  each  indication  PECs,  based  on 
prevalence  of  the  diseases  and  treatment  regimens.  The  result  indicates  that  eltrombopag  does  not 
constitute  a  risk  to  sediment  compartments.  As  eltrombopag  has  a  Log  Pow  value  which  is  >3  in  the 
environmental  pH  range,  a  fish  bioaccumulation  study  (OECD  305)  was  conducted.  As  shown  in  the 
bioconcentration  study  in  Oncorhynchus  mykiss,  eltrombopag  cannot  be  considered  bioaccumulative 
based on the maximum Biocencentration Factors at steady state (BCFSS) of 336-130, as the BCF remains 
below the criteria for a bio-accumulative substance.  
2.2.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this application lead to a significant increase in environmental exposure 
further to the use of eltrombopag.  
However, considering the above data, eltrombopag is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

After  the  original  cut-off  (30-Sept-2016)  the  MAH  updated  PK  with  a  new  cut-off  date  (28-Feb-2018). 
Data  from  this  period  include  PK  results  from  subjects  in  Cohort  1  and  from  the  Extension  Cohort.  The 
updated cut-off allowed assessment of PK parameters of eltrombopag in 33 subjects in Extension Cohort, 
of whom: 1 subject received daily eltrombopag at 37.5 mg (South-East Asian, 10 years), 6 subjects at 75 
mg (3 non-Asians, of 6 to 7 years and 3 South-East Asians > 18 years), and the remaining 26 subjects at 
150 mg. No PK data were collected in patients aged 2 to 5 years.

To  assess  the  pharmacokinetics  in  SAA  naïve  patients,  preliminary  data  with  original  cut-off  (30-Sept-
2016) from the AUS01T were available. This Investigator Initiated Trial, sponsored by the National Heart, 
Lung,  and  Blood  Institute,  is  a  non-randomized,  single-arm,  single-center,  PhaseI/II  study  investigating 
the  standard  regimen  of  horse  anti-thymocyte  globulin  (h-ATG)  and  cyclosporine  (CsA),  in  combination 
with  eltrombopag  as  experimental  therapy  in  subjects  with  SAA  who  have  not  received  prior  definitive 
IST.  
The subjects were treated with IST, h-ATG + CsA, combined with eltrombopag as experimental therapy. 
The cohorts differed only by the treatment starting day and duration of eltrombopag and the addition of a 
CsA maintenance regimen.  
Subjects  received  their  starting  dose  of  eltrombopag  according  to  their  age  and  ethnicity  (East/South-
East Asian or non-Asian). Eltrombopag 150 mg once daily was selected as the starting dose for non-Asian 
≥12  year  old  subjects.  h-ATG  was  administered  at  a  dose  of  40  mg/kg.  CsA  dosing  was  based  on  body 
weight, except for obese subjects (defined as a BMI >35 in subjects >20 years and > 95th percentile in 
subjects 12 to 20 years). Total daily dose of CsA for subjects ≥ 12 years and <12 years was 6 mg/kg/day 
and 12 mg/kg/day, respectively. For obese subjects the CsA dose was based on the adjusted body weight 
that  was  calculated  as  the  midpoint  between  the  ideal  weight  and  actual  body  weight.  CsA  dosing  was 
adjusted  to  obtain  a  therapeutic  trough  level  between  200  to  400  μg/L.  Eltrombopag  starting  doses  in 
East/South-East Asian subjects were to be 50% lower than those in non-Asians. 
The PK of eltrombopag was an exploratory objective of this study. Only subjects enrolled in Cohort 1 who 
had received once daily eltrombopag for at least 7 days prior to the landmark month 3 visit (to be at PK 
steady-state  with  no  recent  dose  interruptions)  were  included  in  the  PK  assessments.  Blood  samples  (2 
mL) for PK analysis were collected at the following times: within 30 min prior to eltrombopag dosing (pre-
dose sample), and at 2, 4, 6, and 8 h after eltrombopag dosing. An optional sample could be collected 24 
h  post-dose,  prior  to  administration  of  eltrombopag  on  the  next  day.  As  the  24  h  sample  was  not 
collected, the pre-dose sample was duplicated and analysed as a 24 h sample under the assumption that 
PK steady-state had been reached. 
Twenty-one (21) subjects enrolled in Cohort 1 (AUST01) were evaluable for PK, 1 subject at the 100 mg 
dose, 1 subject at the 125 mg dose, and 19 subjects at the 150 mg dose. Three (3) out of 21 subjects 
were  adolescents  aged  12,  14,  and  17  years  (2  of  them  received  150  mg  dose).  There  was  no 
East/South-East Asian subject evaluable for the PK assessment. PK parameters are presented in table 7 
and in figure 1.

Figure 1. Geometric and arithmetic means of eltrombopag plasma concentrations over time - 
Pharmacokinetic analysis set (cut-off 30-Sept-2016). 
Eltrombopag  was  absorbed  with  a  peak  plasma  concentration  occurring  2  to  6  hours  after  repeat  oral 
administration. In the 19 subjects with PK at the dose 150 mg day (two of them were aged from 12-18 
years), the geometric mean (geometric mean coefficient of variation - CV) Cmax was 34.1 μg/mL (44%), 
AUClast (equivalent to AUC0-24 post-dose, henceforth will be referred to as AUC) was 671 h.μg/mL (51%), 
and  Ctrough  was  23.9  μg/mL  (66%).  Overall  variability  of  PK  parameters  at  150  mg  was  moderate,  with 
geometric mean CV below 66% for all parameters. 
Subgroup  analyses  on  exposure  parameters  (AUC,  Cmax,  and  Ctrough)  were  performed  by  the  actual 
dose  administered  at  the  time  of  PK  assessment  (100  mg,  125  mg,  and  150  mg),  gender,  age  group 
(<18  years  and  ≥18  years),  race,  and  by  hematological  response  at  Month  3.  The  analysis  by  gender 
showed that Cmax, Ctrough, and AUC were approximately 35% to 50% higher in female as compared to 
male subjects (Table 8).

These  differences  are  considered  within  the  magnitude  of  the  observed  overall  variability  of  PK 
parameters. For the other subgroup analyses, no difference between subgroups was observed, suggesting 
in particular that exposure in the 2 adolescents was similar to that in adult subjects (Table 9).

New cut-off data (28-Feb-2018) were provided as part of this application. Data from this period include 
PK  results  from  subjects  in  Cohort  1  and  and  from  the  Extension  Cohort.  The  updated  cut-off  allowed 
assessment  of  PK  parameters  of  eltrombopag  in  33  subjects  in  Extension  Cohort,  of  whom:  1  subject 
received daily eltrombopag at 37.5 mg (South-East Asian, 10 years), 6 subjects at 75 mg (3 non-Asians, 
of 6 to 7 years and 3 South-East Asians > 18 years), and the remaining 26 subjects at 150 mg. No PK 
data were collected in patients aged 2 to 5 years.

Regarding PK results by age subgroup in a total of 50 non-Asian naïve SAA subjects, 3 of them were aged 
from 6 to 11 years, a total of 8 were aged 12-17 years and 39 subjects aged >18 years. These 50 
subjects received from 75 to 150 mg/day of eltrombopag. Exposure to eltrombopag in the non-Asian SAA 
paediatric patients when PK parameters were dose-normalised was consistent with what was previously 
observed in paediatris ITP patients, in relation to the >12 years age group (Table 13).

Studies providing supportive PK data in healthy subjects, in subjects with ITP, and in subjects 
with CLD 
Pharmacokinetics  comparison  SAA  (study  AUS01T)  vs.  non-SAA  (healthy  subjects,  in  subjects  with  ITP, 
and in subjects with CLD). 
Pharmacokinetic  results  in  Study  AUS01T  after  the  original  cut-off  (30-sept-2016)  were  compared  with 
published  data  in  healthy  subjects  (Matthys  et  al  2011),  in  subjects  with  chronic  immune 
thrombocytopenia  (ITP),  the  first indication  of eltrombopag  (Gibiansky  et  al 2011),  and  in  subjects  with 
chronic  liver  disease  (CLD)  (Farrell  et  al  2013).  The  details  of  the  studies  and  analyses  from  which  the 
reference PK data was derived are summarised in table 6. 
To  enable  comparisons  between  populations,  the  PK  parameters  obtained  at  150  mg  in  Study  AUS01T 
were  adjusted  to  the  theoretical  dose  for  which  empirical  Bayes  estimates  for  AUC  and  Cmax  were 
calculated in the ITP and CLD publications (50 mg, Table 6), under the assumption of PK linearity.  
When  considering  a  similar  dose  (by  dose-normalising  to  50  mg),  exposure  in  definitive  IST-naïve 
subjects  with  SAA  from  Study  AUS01T  was  between  2-  to  3-  fold  higher  than  exposure  in  healthy 
subjects,  and  in  subjects  with  ITP,  whereas  it  was  similar  to  the  exposure  in  subjects  with  CLD  (Table 
14). 
Table 14. Estimates of steady-state geometric mean Cmax and AUC following once-daily 
administration of eltrombopag in definitive IST-naïve SAA versus non-SAA subjects. 
After  the  updated  cut-off  (28-Feb-2018)  the  MAH  provided  PK  data  in  ITP  patients  by  age  subgroup 
(Table  15  and  Figure  3).  These  results  showed  similar  exposure  to  eltrombopag  (AUC,  Cmáx  and 
Ctrough) between adults and children aged 12-17 years. However, PK behaviour was found to be similar 
between younger patients (i.e. 6-11 years and 1-5 years). Comparing exposures between patients aged 
>12 years (including adults) vs ≤11 years, exposure to eltrombopag was higher in younger group (Cmax 
and AUC were approximately 50-65% higher and Ctrough was approximately 40% higher, in relation to 
>12 years group).

Studies providing supportive PK data Japanese naïve and refractory patients 
The absence of East/South-East Asian subjects in the study PK dataset on study AUS01T did not allow for 
the  characterisation  of  differences  in  ethnic  exposure.  Therefore,  comparisons  with  other  studies  were 
performed  using  PK  data  from  the  2  supportive  Japanese  studies  in  refractory  aplastic  anemia  (Study 
E1201) and definitive IST-naïve aplastic anemia (Study E1202).  
Description of Japanese Studies 
•  Study E1201 
This was a non-randomized, open-label, phase II study to assess the efficacy and safety of eltrombopag 
monotherapy in Japanese subjects with moderate or more severe AA  with a platelet count < 30,000/μL 
who were refractory to ATG-based IST, who had relapsed after ATG-based IST, or who were ineligible for 
ATG-based  IST.  Treatment  with  eltrombopag  was  started  at  25  mg/day  and  adjusted  according  to  the 
platelet count. Twenty-one subjects were enrolled in the study. All were evaluable for the PK assessment. 
The details of the studies and analyses are summarized in Table 5. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620491/2019

Exposure  to  eltrombopag  (AUC,  Cmax)  was  measured  at  steady-state  (Day  15)  and  was  considered 
similar to the previously reported values in Japanese ITP subjects. Trough concentrations increased with 
ascending  dose  from  25  to  100  mg.  No  substantial  difference  was  apparent  in  the  PK  of  eltrombopag 
monotherapy when comparing Japanese AA and ITP subjects. 
•  Study E1202 
This was a non-randomized, open label, single-arm, phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
eltrombopag in combination with rabbit ATG/CsA in Japanese subjects with moderate or more severe AA 
who had not received prior ATG/ALG-based immunosuppressive therapy. 
Subjects who were considered eligible in Screening and in the Day 1 tests started treatment with rabbit 
ATG/CsA on Day 1 (start of treatment). Treatment with eltrombopag was started on Day 15 (± 3 days). 
The dose of eltrombopag was 75 mg/day initially and could be decreased according to the platelet count 
or  safety.  Rabbit  ATG  was  administered  at  a  dose  of  2.5  to  3.75  mg/kg/day  for  5  days.  CsA  was 
administered until Week 26. Eltrombopag was administered until Week 26 unless meeting the stopping or 
withdrawal  criteria.  Ten  (10)  subjects  were  enrolled  in  the  study.  All  were  evaluable  for  the  PK 
assessment (day 15 trough, steady-state) described in Table 5. 
Trough concentrations increased with ascending dose from 25 to 75 mg.  
Pharmacokinetics comparison: study AUS01T vs. Japanese studies (naïve and refractory studies) 
For  the  comparison  of  eltrombopag  exposure  between  definitive  IST-naïve  AA  subjects  of  Asian  (Study 
E1202)  to  subjects  of  non-Asian  origin  (Study  AUS01T,  cut-off  30-Sept-2016),  stead-state  Ctrough  was 
used. The geometric mean Ctrough at 75 mg in the 10 Japanese subjects receiving 75 mg eltrombopag 
(20.4  μg/mL)  was  similar  to  the  geometric  mean  Ctrough  in  non-Japanese  subjects  receiving  twice  the 
dose at 150 mg eltrombopag (23.9 μg/mL). The observation of similar exposure for a 2-fold difference in 
dose is consistent with the previously identified ethnic sensitivity factor (2-fold higher exposure in Asian 
compared to non-Asian) (Table 16). 
Table  16.  Estimates  of  steady-state  PK  parameters  of  eltrombopag  following  once  daily 
administration  in  Japan  (Studies  E1201  and  E1202)  versus  non-Japan  population  (AUS01T 
Study cut-off 30-Sept-2016). 
Results in Japanese subjects suggest that Aat the same dose, average exposure in refractory AA (Study 
E1201)  is  approximately  2-fold  lower  than  exposure  in  definitive  IST-naïve  AA  (Study  E1202).  The 
generally high variability on Ctrough (CV% = 146%) could contribute to this difference, as the ranges of 
Assessment report

individual Ctrough values between Study E1201 (1.0 – 37.3 μg/mL) and Study E1202 (8.1 - 34.6 μg/mL) 
were overlapping. 
The origin of a possible overexposure in subjects with definitive IST-naïve AA receiving eltrombopag as a 
combination with CsA and ATG was investigated. The hypothesis that CsA, combined with eltrombopag in 
E1202  and  AUS01T  could  increase  eltrombopag  exposure  (CsA  being  a  BCRP  inhibitor  and  eltrombopag 
being  a  BCRP  substrate)  was  assessed.  A  formal  clinical  drug-drug  interaction  study  was  carried  out  to 
assess the effect of CsA on the plasma PK of eltrombopag (Zhang et al 2015). This was a Phase I, open-
label, randomized, three-period crossover study in healthy adult subjects. Results showed that there was 
no  increase  in  eltrombopag  exposure  when  eltrombopag  was  co-administered  with  CsA  at  the  doses  of 
200 mg or 600 mg. A statistically significant decrease in eltrombopag exposure was observed when it was 
coadministered with CsA, but it was not considered clinically meaningful (Zhang et al 2015). Therefore it 
is  unlikely  that  the  combination  with  CsA  was  responsible  for  the  increased  exposure  to  eltrombopag 
when it is combined with CsA in definitive IST-naïve AA subjects. 
The  composition  of  the  dataset  from  AUS01T  (proportion  of  subjects  usually  associated  with  higher 
eltrombopag exposure like females, children, elderly, subjects with hepatic impairment, East/South-East 
Asian subjects) could also not explain this observation. 
The  summary  of  PK  parameters  at  the  150  mg  dose  in  these  cohorts  (and  the  pooled  data)  were 
presented during evaluation. After daily 150 mg doses, the PK of eltrombopag at steady-state was similar 
between  subjects  in  Cohort  1  and  Extension  Cohort  both  for  rate  and  for  extent  of  absorption.  Peak 
concentrations (Cmax) in plasma were achieved between 2 and 8 hours (Tmax) after the morning dose 
and the overall variability of parameters was moderate, in line with what was reported in previous clinical 
studies. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Eltrombopag is an oral TPO-receptor (TPO-R) agonist, which interacts with the transmembrane domain of 
the  TPO-R  on  megakaryocytes  and  human  bone  marrow  progenitor  cells.  Eltrombopag  increases 
hematopoiesis  by  inducing  proliferation  and  differentiation  of  early  bone  marrow  progenitor  cells.  The 
multilineage effects of eltrombopag in subjects with aplastic anemia may be through stimulation of bone 
marrow progenitor cells, as suggested by some preclinical research. 
Results on eltrombopag mechanism of action, ethnopharmacologic and paediatric differences in exposure 
were detailed in prior applications. 
2.3.4.   PK/PD 
The small sample size and the restriction of PK and PD observations to a subset of subjects enrolled in 
Cohort 1 in Study AUS01T did not allow an extensive evaluation of PK/PD relationships. At Month 3, 
hematological response was observed at all quartiles of exposure measures with no particular trend. 
There was no apparent relationship between eltrombopag exposure and the occurrence of selected 
abnormal liver and renal function parameters at Month 3. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
A clinical pharmacology program had already been conducted for eltrombopag and was detailed in prior 
applications.  Current  information  on  absorption,  distribution,  metabolism,  excretion  and  drug-drug

interactions of eltrombopag is described in the approved SmPC and is considered adequate for the target 
population.  
To  assess  the  pharmacokinetics  in  SAA  naïve  patients,  data  from  the  AUS01T  are  used.  This  is  a  non-
randomized, single-arm, single-center, Phase I/II study investigating the standard regimen of h-ATG and 
CsA,  in  combination  with  eltrombopag  as  experimental  therapy  in  subjects  with  SAA  who  have  not 
received prior definitive IST. The PK of eltrombopag was an exploratory objective of this study. 
The  study  included  3  Cohorts  that  differed  only  by  the  treatment  starting  day,  duration  of  eltrombopag 
and  the  addition  of  a  CsA  maintenance  regimen.  h-ATG  was  administered  at  a  dose  of  40  mg/kg.  CsA 
dosing  was  based  on  body  weight,  except  for  obese  subjects  for  whom  the  dose  was  based  on  the 
adjusted  body  weight  that  was  calculated  as  the  midpoint  between  the  ideal  weight  and  actual  body 
weight.  Total  daily  dose  of  CsA  for  subjects  ≥  12  years  and  <12  years  was  6  mg/kg/day  and  12 
mg/kg/day,  respectively.  CsA  dosing  was  adjusted  to  obtain  a  therapeutic  trough  level  between  200  to 
400  μg/L.  Subjects  received  their  starting  dose  of  eltrombopag  according  to  their  age  and  ethnicity 
(East/South-East Asian or non-Asian). Eltrombopag 150 mg once daily was selected as the starting dose 
for  non-Asian  ≥12  year  old  subjects.  Eltrombopag  starting  dose  in  East/South-East  Asian  subjects  was 
50% lower than those in non-Asians. 
After  the  first  cut-off  (30-Sept-2016),  only  subjects  enrolled  in  Cohort  1  who  had  received  once  daily 
eltrombopag  for  at  least  7  days  prior  to  the  landmark  month  3  visit  (to  be  at  PK  steady-state  with  no 
recent  dose  interruptions)  were  included  in  the  PK  assessments.  Twenty-one  (21)  subjects  enrolled  in 
Cohort I (AUST01) were evaluable for PK, 1 subject at the 100 mg dose, 1 subject at the 125 mg dose, 
and 19 subjects at the 150 mg dose. Three (3) out of 21 subjects were adolescents aged 12, 14, and 17 
years (2 of them received 150 mg dose). There were no children between 2 and 11 years old included in 
the PK study and there were only two older than 12 years. There was no East/South-East Asian subject 
evaluable for the PK assessment.  
The update cut-off (28-feb-2018) allowed assessment on PK parameters of eltrombopag in 33 subjects in 
Extension Cohort, of whom 1 subject received eltrombopag at 37.5 mg/day (South-East Asian, 10 years), 
6  subjects  75  mg/day  (3  non-Asians  of  6  to  7  years  and  3  South-East  Asian  >18  years),  and  the 
remaining  26  subjects  at  150  mg/day.  Results  with  the  update  cut-off  (28-Feb-2018)  showed  similar 
results  as  those  obtained  during  the  original  cut-off.  Eltrombopag  was  absorbed  with  a  peak  plasma 
concentration occurring 2-8 hours after repeat oral administration. In the 45 subjects with PK at the dose 
150 mg dose the geometric mean (geometric mean coefficient of variation - CV) Cmax was 40.1 μg/mL 
(45%),  AUClast  (equivalent  to  AUC0-24  post-dose,  henceforth  will  be  referred  to  as  AUC)  was  772 
h.μg/mL (47%), and Ctrough was 29.4 μg/mL (62%). Overall variability of PK parameters at 150 mg was 
moderate, with geometric mean CV below 62% for all parameters. 
In addition, subgroup analyses by dose-normalised (to 150 mg/day), gender, race, and by hematological 
response at Month 3 including subjects in Cohort 1 and Extension cohort was performed. The analysis by 
gender  confirmed  a  trend  of  higher  exposure  in  females  and  South-Asian  subjects  when  compared  to 
male  subjects  or  other  races  (Cmax,  Ctrough  and  AUClast  were  approximately  40  to  50%  higher  in 
female and South-East Asian subjects when compared to male subjects and to other races). For the other 
subgroup analyses, no notable difference between subgroups was observed. 
Regarding PK results by age subgroup in a total of 50 non-Asian naïve SAA subjects, 3 of them were aged 
from  6  to  11  years  and  total  of  8  and  39  subjects  aged  12-17  years  and  >18  years  were  respectively 
included. These 50 subjects received from 75 to 150 mg/day of eltrombopag. When PK parameters were 
dose-normalised, a trend of higher exposure was observed in 6 to 11 years old subgroup when compared 
to older groups (Cmax, and AUClast in 6 to 11 years subjects were approximately 60-80% higher than in 
older age groups, whereas Ctrough are approximately 30% higher than in older age groups). PK results 
seen in 12-17 years subgroup and in adults could be considered similar. However, regarding adolescents

this  assertion  is  based  only  on  PK  data  from  8  patients  which  is  considered  not  enough  to  assure  PK 
behaviour  in  this  age group.  Also  it  must  be taken  into  account  that only  3  subjects  aged  from  6 to  11 
years and no patients aged 2 to 5 were included in the PK assessment. Therefore, the CHMP consider PK 
in patients aged <12 years has not been well established. 
In this respect, it is worth noting that according to the Paediatric Investigation Plan, an open-label, non-
controlled, intra-patient dose-escalating trial to evaluate PK, safety, activity and acceptability/palatability 
of  eltrombopag  in  children  from  1  year  to  less  than  18  years  of  age  with  SAA  that  is  refractory,  or 
relapsed  after  IST  or  with  newly  diagnosed  in  combination  with  IST  is  planned  (Study  identifier 
CETB115E2201).  In  this  study,  PK  assessment  will  be  the  primary  endpoint  with  a  dose  escalation 
schedule  according  to  paediatric  age.  20  paediatric  patients  on  each  group  (relapsed/refractory  and 
treatment naïve to IST) are planned to be included.   
The PK results above described in SAA naïve patients (Study AUS01T) after the original cut-off (30-Sept-
2016)  were  compared  with  PK  data  obtained  in  other  indications  currently  authorised  (i.e  ITP,  healthy 
subjects and CLD) from other studies (Matthys et al 201, Gibiansky et al 2011 and Farrell et al 2013). To 
enable comparisons between populations, the PK parameters obtained at 150 mg in Study AUS01T were 
adjusted to the theoretical dose for which empirical Bayes estimates for AUC and Cmax were calculated in 
the ITP and CLD publications (50 mg), under the assumption of PK linearity.  
When  considering  a  similar  dose  (by  dose-normalising  to  50  mg),  exposure  in  definitive  IST-naïve 
subjects with SAA from Study AUS01T (AUC for 150 mg dose=671 µh.h/ml; AUC  for normalised 50 mg 
dose =224 µh.h/ml) was between 2- to 3- fold higher than exposure in healthy subjects (AUC for 150 mg 
dose=239) µh.h/ml,) and in subjects with ITP (AUC for 50 mg dose=99 µh.h/ml), whereas it was similar 
to  the  exposure  in  subjects  with  CLD  (AUC  for  50  mg  dose=221  µh.h/ml).  In  addition  and  after  the 
updated  cut-off,  the  MAH  provided  exposure  data  by  subgroup  age  in  ITP  and  SAA  naïve  non-Asian 
patients. These results showed similar exposure to eltrombopag (AUC,  Cmáx  and Ctrough) between ITP 
adults  and  children  aged  12-17  years.  This  exposure  was  approximately  2-fold  in  ITP  younger  patients 
(i.e. 11 years and 1-5 years). PK data in naïve SAA patients by age subgroup showed similar behaviour: 
the exposure was higher in >12 years old subgroup (including adults) in comparison to younger group (6-
11 years old). No naïve SAA patients aged between 1-5 years were included in the PK analysis, therefore 
no conclusion can be drawn in this age group. Also it is important to consider that in the naïve SAA 6-11 
years  old  group,  only  3  patients  were  included  for  PK  analysis  which  is  not  considered  appropriate  to 
adequately describe the PK behaviour.  
In  addition,  and  in  the  absence  of  East/South-east  Asian  subjects  in  the  PK  AUS01T  study  (cut-off  30-
Sept-2016), a comparison with other studies was performed using PK data (Ctrough was used) from the 
2  supportive  Japanese  studies  in  refractory  aplastic  anemia  (Study  E1201)  and  definitive  IST-naïve 
aplastic anemia (Study E1202).  
In  Study  E1201,  the  exposure  to  eltrombopag  (AUC,  Cmax)  measured  at  steady-state  was  considered 
similar to the previously reported values in Japanese ITP subjects. No substantial difference was apparent 
in  the  PK  of  eltrombopag  monotherapy  when  starting  at  25  mg/day  and  adjusting  according  to  the 
platelet count, comparing Japanese AA and ITP subjects. In Study E1202 trough concentrations increased 
with ascending dose from 25 to 75 mg. Regarding the results obtained for the comparison of SAA naïve 
patients  in  AUS01T  vs.  Japanese  refractory  AA  population,  steady-state  Ctrough  was  used  and  similar 
results  in  median  Ctrough  were  seen  (Study  AUS01T  median  Ctrough  for  normalised  75  mg  dose=11.8 
µg/ml  [1.8-24.8];  Study  E1201  median  Ctrough  for  75  mg  dose=13.7  µg/ml  [1.0-37.9]).  In  Study 
E1202,  the  comparison  of  eltrombopag  exposure  between  definitive  IST-naïve  AA  Japanese  patients 
(Study E1202) to non-Asian origin (Study AUS01T), suggested that at the same dose, average exposure 
is  approximately  2-fold  higher  in  Japanese  naïve  patients  (mean  Ctrough  for  75  mg  dose  in  Japanese 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620491/2019

subjects= 21.3 μg/mL [8.1-34.9]; mean Ctrough for normalised 75 mg dose in non-Asian subjects=11.8 
μg/mL [1.8-24.8]).  
Given  all  these  results,  no  differences  were  found  in  the  exposure  to  eltrombopag  between  naïve  SAA 
patients and CLD patients. On the contrary, differences in exposure were found between treatment-naïve 
SAA patients and ITP. However, similar trend in exposure by age group were found between >12 years 
ITP and naïve-SAA patients vs <12 years ITP and naïve SAA patients.  
At the same time differences were found between Japanese refractory and Japanese naïve patients (and 
therefore  between  Japanese  naïve  SAA  and  non-Asian  naïve  SAA  patients).  No  justification  has  been 
provided  for  this  finding.  Considering  that  PK  behaviour  of  eltrombopag  could  be  different  for  all  naïve 
and  non-naïve  patients,  the  MAH  was  asked  to  discuss  the  PK  results  observed  in  non-Asian  naïve  SAA 
patients  compared  with  non-naïve  SAA  patients.  No  justification  has  been  provided,  at  this  time  point. 
However we agree with the MAH that, despite the higher eltrombopag exposures observed in naïve SAA 
patients, the safety profile of eltrombopag at doses up to 150 mg/day in naive SAA in AUS01T Study was 
consistent with the established safety profile in the approved IPT, HCV and refractory SAA indications. In 
addition,  dose  adjustment  rules  based  on  platelet  response  and  safety  events  of  liver  functions  and 
thrombosis were proposed. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The MAH provided updated PK data from AUS01T study in 50 non-Asian naïve SAA patients who received 
75-150  mg/day  of  eltrombopag  (cohort  1  and  Extension  cohort  from  study  AUS01T).  With  this  new  PK 
data  12-17  years  and  >18  years  subgroups  are  better  represented  (8  subjects  and  39  subjects, 
respectively).  According  to  PK  results  between  these  two  age  subgroups  exposure  to  eltrombopag 
appears  similar.  Comparing  eltrombopag  exposure  in  >12  years  naïve  SAA  patients  with  ITP  patients, 
similar  behaviour  has  been  found.  However,  the  PK  profile  in  adolescents  is  still  considered  not  well 
defined in this age group.  
Regarding the PK results in younger subgroups a trend of higher exposure was observed in 6 to 11 years 
old subgroup when compared to older ones. However the number of patients in this age range included 
for  this  assessment,  only  three,  is  considered  insufficient  to  characterise  PK  behaviour.  In  addition  no 
patient from 2-5 years were included. 
According to the PIP, the results of the planned trial proposed in paediatric patients (naïve and non-naïve 
SAA paediatric patients, CETB115E2201) would shed light on this issue.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The efficacy evaluation of eltrombopag with standard IST for the treatment of SAA as a first-line therapy 
is predominantly based on data from 123 subjects (enrolled as of 30-Sept-2016) who have been exposed 
to treatment with eltrombopag added to horse anti-thymocyte globulin (h-ATG)+cyclosporine (CsA) in the 
pivotal  Study  AUS01T.  The  MAH  updated  these  data  with  the  responses during  evaluation,  using  a  new 
cut-off  date  (28-Feb-2018).  With  this  new  cut-off  date,  data  are  provided  for  30  additional  subjects  (8 
paediatrics and 22 adults) providing data for a total of 92 patients presented in the Cohort 3+extension, 
in  which  the  treatment  recommended  by  the  MAH  was  given.  Moreover,  with  this  cut-off-date  41 
additional subjects were evaluable at month 6 for the efficacy, resulting in a total of 87 subjects evaluable 
in cohort3+extension. 
Efficacy  data  from  4  historical  studies  are  also  presented  to  assess  the  effect  of  adding  eltrombopag  to 
standard therapy of h-ATG+CsA; these include Scheinberg et al 2009, Scheinberg et al 2011, Tisdale et al 
2000, and Rosenfeld et al 2003. In addition, efficacy results from Study E1202 and Boddu et al 2017 are 
provided to independently substantiate the results of the pivotal study (Table 17).

The key efficacy analyses are primarily based on complete response (CR) and overall response (OR) rates

included in the historical analysis for comparisons of eltrombopag with h-ATG+CsA to the historical arms 
h-ATG+CSA alone.

No  dose  finding  studies  have  been  performed  in  the  clinical  development  of  this  product.  The  proposed 
posology  for  the  first  line  indication  in  SAA  is  eltrombopag  150  mg  once  daily  as  the  starting  dose  in 
patients older than 12 years of age, 75 mg once daily for children between 6 and 11 years of age, and

2.5 mg/kg once daily for children between 2 and 5 years of age in the non-Asian population. In addition, 
the  starting  dosing  regimen  must  consider  also  the ethnicity  given  the  PK  differences observed.  Further 
doses should be adjusted based on the subject’s platelet counts and the observable safety (Table 18, 19 
and 20).

A  more  detailed  explanation  about  this  issue  was  provided.  The  starting  dose  used  in  AUS01T  study  is 
based  on  results  from  refractory  SAA  study  (AUS28T),  exposure  observed  between  paediatric  and  adult 
ITP  patients  vs  paediatric  SAA  patients  as  well  as  PK/PD  results  and  safety  profile  obtained  from  the 
AUS01T updated cut-off (28-Feb-2018).

The  eltrombopag  dose  scheme  in  the  second  line  SAA  pivotal  Study  AUS28T  (also  referred  as  Study 
ELT112523 or 09-H-0154) in subjects with refractory SAA, consisted of starting doses in non-Asians of 50 
mg daily, to be adjusted in 25 mg increments every 2 weeks as necessary and up to a maximum dose of 
150  mg  daily  to  achieve  the  target  platelet  count  ≥  50,000/μL.  Nearly  all  patients  were  successfully 
escalated  to  the  150  mg  daily  dose  without  any  dose-limiting  toxicity.  Haematological  responses  were 
only  observed  while  receiving  the  150  mg  daily  dosing.  Based  on  these  observations,  the  NIH  modified 
the dose algorithm in Study AUS01T for first line SAA, with dose adjustments for ethnic and age-related 
considerations. 
Therefore the most effective dose used in AUS28T study (150 mg/day), adjusted for age (<12 years) and 
ethnicity (East/South-East Asian), was selected as starting dose of eltrombopag in AUS01T. 
• 
Exposure between paediatric and adult ITP patients. 
The proposed doses for paediatric subjects (i.e. 75 mg/day 2.5 mg/kg/day for patients aged 6-11 years  
and  2-5  years,  respectively)    are  based  on  the  pivotal  Study  AUS01T  and  on  pooled  PK  analysis  from 
Studies TRA108062 (PETIT) and TRA115450 (PETIT2) in paediatric ITP patients. 
In studies TRA108062/PETIT and TRA115450/PETIT2, dose-normalised (DN) eltrombopag exposure 
(Cmax and AUC) in ITP patients at steady state was similar between paediatric patients in the 12-17 
years group and adult patients. This data suggested the use of the same dosing strategy between SAA 
adult and 12-17 years old SAA patients  (i.e. 150 mg in SAA patients ≥12 years) (see next Table 21 and 
Figure 4). 
In younger ITP patients, from 1 to 11 years, plasma eltrombopag DN-AUCtau and DN-Cmax values were 
60%  higher  than  in  patients  ≥12  years  of  age,  supporting  a  2-fold  lower  eltrombopag  starting  dose  in 
subjects  of  1  to  11  years  of  age  than  in  subjects  ≥12  years  (i.e.  75  mg  in  SAA  patients  6-11  years). 
According  to  this  rationale  patients  aged  from  2-  5  years  would  be  candidate  to  receive  75  mg/day  of 
eltrombopag.  Instead,  a  more  conservative  approach  using  a  weight-based  dosing  strategy  was 
considered in the younger group (2-5 years).

patients.

Figure 4. Plasma eltrombopag dose-normalized (to 50mg) AUC(0-tau) and Cmax by covariates 
in ITP patients. 
The  popPK  analysis  in  paediatric  ITP  patients  showed  that  lower  body  weight was  associated  with lower 
plasma  eltrombopag  clearance  and  lower  volume  parameters,  with  estimated  exponents  for  weight  on 
clearance and volume parameters close to allometric values. Therefore, for patients in the younger group 
(2-5  years),  a  more  conservative  approach  using  a  weight-based  dosing  strategy  was  considered.  In 
Study  TRA108062,  review  of  the  platelet  count,  safety  and  eltrombopag  PK  data  in  non-Asian  ITP 
subjects  between  1  and  5  years  of  age  supported  eltrombopag  starting  doses  in  SAA  up  to  2.5  mg/kg 
once  daily.  The  latter,  considering  the  2- to  3-fold  higher  eltrombopag  exposure  (AUC)  in  SAA  than  ITP 
patient populations based on PK in adults, it provides the rationale for a safe and effective eltrombopag 
starting dose of 2.5 mg/kg in non-Asian first-line treatment of SAA subjects of 2 to 5 year. 
• 
PK/PD results and safety profile obtained from the AUS01T updated cut-off (28-Feb-2018). 
The PK of eltrombopag was an exploratory objective of Study AUS01T and only included in a sub-set of 
patients  in  Cohort  1  and  the  Extension  Cohort.  Table  19  presents  a  summary  of  dose-normalized 
eltrombopag PK parameters observed in Study AUS01T, by age group in non-East/South-East Asians, as 
of the 28-Feb-2018 cut-off date. PK parameter were normalized to a 150 mg dose in order to use all data 
available,  including  data  collected  in  patients  who may  have  received  lower  than  the  starting  doses.  No 
PK data were collected in patients aged 2 to 5 years (Table 22).

East/South-East Asian SAA subjects.

In SAA patients between 12 and 18 years of age, dose-normalised eltrombopag exposure was similar to 
that observed in adults (≥18 years), similar to what was previously observed in paediatric ITP patients. In 
patients aged 6-11, exposure (AUC and Cmax) when dose normalised to the same dose as in adults (150 
mg), was higher than in the older patients. In the 3 patients aged 6 to 11 years, dose-normalised Cmax 
and  AUClast  for  eltrombopag  are  approximately  60-90%  higher  than  in  older  age  groups,  whereas 
Ctrough is approximately 40-50% higher than in older age groups. 
The Cmax, AUClast, and Ctrough normalised to the starting dose of 75 mg in patients in the 6 to 11 year 
age group were 39.5 μg/mL, 640 μg*h/mL, and 19.2 μg/mL respectively; these were similar or slightly 
lower (20-25%) than in older (≥12 years old) age groups. 
Along  AUS01T  Study  up  to  51%  of  patients  required  temporary  dose  adjustment  (cohort  3+extension 
cut-off  28-Feb  2018),  being  the  main  reason  for  this  adjustment  platelet  count  >200x103/µl  (50.4%) 
(Table 23). 
Table 23. Dose adjustments of eltrombopag - Safety set. 
However, the majority of patients were receiving the same dose as recommended as starting dose at the 
time of month 6 assessment. In the subset of non-Asian ≥12 years old, expected to receive 150 mg/day, 
the  last  dose  was  still  150  mg  for  72%  of  patients  in  Cohort  3+extension  (cut-off  28-Feb-2018)  (Table 
24).

Pharmacokinetics in subjects with aplastic anemia updated AUS01T Study data 
After  the  updated  cut-off  (28-feb-2018)  new  PK  data  from  cohort  1  and  cohort  3+extension  in  AUS01T 
Study  was  included  for  evaluation.  This  new  cut-off  allowed  assessment  in 33  additional  subjects in  the 
extension  cohort.  The  analysis  by  gender  confirmed  that    exposure  (Cmax,  Ctrough  and  AUClast)  were 
approximately  40  to  50%  higher  in  female  and  South-East  Asian  subjects  when  compared  to  male 
subjects and to other races.

The analysis by age 50 non-Asian patients who received 75-150 mg/day of eltrombopag were included. In 
the 3 subjects aged 6-11 years included after this new cut-off, eltrombopag dose-normalised Cmax and 
AUClast  were  approximately  60-80%  higher  than  in  older  age  groups,  whereas  Ctrough  was 
approximately 30% higher than in older age groups (i.e >12 years). For the other subgroup analyses, no 
notable  difference  between  subgroups  was  observed.  This  trend  in  exposure  were  similar  to  those 
observed in ITP patients when comparing >12 years vs <12 years old patients.  
2.4.2.  Main study 
Study AUS01T (pivotal study) 
Study AUS01T was a Phase I/II, non-randomized, single-arm, single-center study designed to evaluate

Treatments 
The subjects were treated with immunosuppressive therapy, h-ATG + CsA, combined with eltrombopag 
as experimental therapy, see Figure 5. The cohorts differed by the starting day of eltrombopag, the 
duration of eltrombopag, and by the addition of a CsA maintenance regimen: 
-  Cohort 1 (N=31): h-ATG on Days 1-4 + CsA from Day 1 to month 6 + eltrombopag from Day 14 
to month 6. 
-  Cohort 2 (N=31): h-ATG on Days 1-4 + CsA from Day 1 to month 6 + eltrombopag from Day 14 
to month 3. Following amendment 15 to the protocol, responding subjects who did not relapse at 
month 6, received low dose of CsA (maintenance dose) from month 6 to month 24. 
-  Cohort 3 (N=31) and Extension Cohort (N=31 at data cut-off 30-Sept-2016 recruitment was still 
ongoing): All 3 drugs started concurrently on Day 1: h-ATG on Days 1-4, CsA and eltrombopag 
from Day 1 to month 6. Responding subjects received low dose of CsA (maintenance dose) from 
month 6 to month 24. Between 30-Septembre-2016 and 28-February-2018, eight additional 
paediatric patients and 22 additional adult subjects were enrolled in the Extension Cohort: 25 who 
met the Month 6 assessment or withdrew earlier and 5 subjects who had not yet reach this 
assessment and were still receiving the study treatment with eltrombopag. Additionally, 15 
subjects who were still receiving the study treatment with eltrombopag, and 1 subject who had 
stopped eltrombopag but was still on study, had not yet reached the Month 6 assessment at the 
original cut-off are included in this analysis. There are a total of 41 additional subjects now 
evaluable at Month 6 (or who withdrew earlier). All 46 subjects (30 newly recruited, and 16 newly 
evaluable for the Month 6 assessment) were enrolled in the Extension Cohort. 
All subjects were followed at the NHLBI at month 3 and month 6 visits (the landmark visits). Subsequent 
follow-up visits at the NHLBI were scheduled at month 12 and then annually for up to 5 years. The 
subjects were also followed between landmark visits by their referral physicians at their discretion.

*Following amendment 15 to the protocol (starting with Subject 46 in Cohort 2) responders received maintenance CsA 
up to month 24. In all cohorts, therapeutic doses of CsA could be re-started in subjects who had evidence of relapse 
after month 6. Eltrombopag could be restarted in subjects who had evidence of relapse after month 3 in Cohort 2 and 
after month 6 in all other cohorts. 
Study participation was considered complete after 5 years, unless the subject had died, voluntarily 
withdrawn, or had a protocol-specified event for which the study drug administration was discontinued at 
the discretion of the Principal Investigator. 
The treatment phase with CsA + eltrombopag was 6 months, with CsA maintenance from Month 6-24, 
with the possibility of re-initiation of CsA + eltrombopag at therapeutic dose in the case of relapse. 
Objectives 
Primary objective: 
• 
To evaluate the safety and activity profile of h-ATG/CsA/eltrombopag in treatment naïve SAA. 
Secondary objectives: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To evaluate hematological response at 3, 6 and 12 months and yearly thereafter 
To evaluate relapse 
To evaluate clonal evolution to PNH, clonal chromosomal population in bone marrow, 
myelodysplasia by morphology, or acute leukemia 
To evaluate overall survival 
To evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQL) 
To evaluate hematological response of relapsed subjects that re-start treatment 
To evaluate the effect of a 2 mg/kg/day CsA dose starting Month 6 for 18 months until month 24 
on the rate of relapse of subjects deemed responders at Month 6 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: Toxicity profile in the 6 months following h-ATG/CsA/eltrombopag, Complete 
response (CR) rate at 6 months following h-ATG + CsA + eltrombopag, defined as (all 3 were to be met): 
• Absolute neutrophil count >1×103/ μL 
• Platelet count >100×103/ μL 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620491/2019 
Page 49/162 
 
  
  
 
 
• Hgb>10 g/dL 
For each cohort, the rate of CR was calculated as the number of subjects who achieved a CR at 6 months, 
divided by the total number of subjects enrolled into that cohort who had reached the 6-month landmark 
or had withdrawn earlier for any reason, including non-evaluable subjects. The two-sided 95% confidence 
interval (CI) of the CR rate was computed based on the exact method of (Clopper & Pearson, 1934). 
Secondary endpoints: 
•  CR rates at 3 and 12 months and yearly thereafter up to 5 years 
•  Overall response (OR: CR or PR) rates at 3, 6 , 12 months and yearly thereafter up to 5 years 
•  Duration of CR 
•  Duration of OR 
•  Overall survival (OS) 
•  Relapse/duration of response  
•  Change from baseline to post-baseline assessments in PROMIS Global Health, Sleep Disturbance, 
Applied Cognition-Abilities, Anxiety and Depression scores 
•  Change from baseline to post-baseline assessments in FACT- Anemia, Thrombocytopenia and 
Neutropenia scores 
The primary analysis of complete hematological response rate at month 6 was based on the investigator 
assessment  of  response.  However,  improvement  in  blood  counts  following  administration  of  other 
therapies such as growth factors or transfusions (including re-introduction of eltrombopag after month 3 
and prior to month 6 for Cohort 2) were not considered as fulfilling the response criteria. Subjects were 
considered non-responders if they received the following therapies: 
• 
• 
Platelets transfusions: 7 days preceding the assessment of platelet count 
Packed red blood cell transfusions: 14 days preceding the assessment of hemoglobin 
•  Growth factors: 21 days preceding the assessment of response 
A  complete  response  was  defined  as  hematological  parameters  meeting  all  the  following  3  criteria  on  2 
consecutive serial blood count measurements at least one week apart: 
•  Absolute neutrophil count > 1000/μL 
• 
Platelet count > 100x103/μL 
•  Hemoglobin > 10 g/dL 
Sample size 
Past experience with h-ATG/CsA suggests that the CR probability at 6 months for previously untreated 
subjects given this regimen is approximately 10% to 12%. It was hypothesised that the actual CR 
probability using this treatment would reach 30% or more and a CR probability of 10% or less would 
warrant terminating the treatment on this subject population. 
The sample size was determined using 2-Stage Minimax Design of Simon, since it required a smaller total 
number of subjects (N=31) compared to 2-Stage Optimal Design (N=34). At first stage in Cohort 1, 24 
subjects were planned to be accrued and to test the null hypothesis, and the null hypothesis was 
accepted (i.e. the treatment had to be terminated) if no more than 2 subjects demonstrated a CR to the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620491/2019 
Page 50/162 
 
  
  
 
treatment within 6 months. If 3 or more subjects had a CR to the treatment within 6 months at the first 
stage, an additional 7 subjects was accrued.  
Once accrual to Cohort 1 was completed it was proposed to treat another cohort (Cohort 2) of 33 
subjects, and once accrual to Cohort 2 was completed it was proposed to treat another Cohort (Cohort 3) 
of 31 subjects. Of note, the protocol was amended to increase Cohort 2 sample size from 31 to 33 
subjects was submitted on 23-Oct-2014 while amendment to add Cohort 3 was being reviewed. 
Ultimately, only 31 subjects were enrolled in Cohort 2 as the Cohort 3 amendment was approved prior to 
enrol the 2 additional subjects in Cohort 2. 
An Extension to Cohort 3 of at least up to 55 subjects will improve precision of exploratory analysis of 
secondary endpoints. However, this data was not used for the primary analysis of Cohort 3. 
Randomisation 
Not applicable. 
Blinding (masking) 
Not applicable. 
Statistical methods 
Sensitivity and supportive analyses were performed to assess the overall robustness of the primary 
efficacy results. Sensitivity analyses included repeating the primary efficacy analysis using the per 
protocol set (PPS) and using a more stringent definition of CR (ANC ≥ 1500/μL, platelet count ≥ 
150×103/μL, hemoglobin ≥ 12g/dL). The supportive analysis included a subgroup analysis of CR rate at 
6-months by age (<18 years, 18-64 years, ≥ 65 years), gender, race, GPI negative neutrophils level (≤ 
50% vs. > 50%), and severity of aplastic anemia. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Study AUS01T (data cut-off of 30-Sep-2016) enrolled a total 123 subjects, and all of them received 
eltrombopag with h-ATG+CsA for the FAS. From the FAS, 30 subjects were included in Cohort 1, 31 
subjects in each of Cohort 2 and Cohort 3, and 31 subjects in the Extension to Cohort 3. At the update 
cut-off (28-Feb-2018), 30 additional subjects (8 paediatrics and 22 adults) were recruited, including 25 
who met the Month 6 assessment or withdrew earlier, and 5 subjects who had not yet reached this 
assessment and were still receiving the study treatment with eltrombopag. Additionally, 15 subjects who 
were still receiving the study treatment with eltrombopag, and 1 subject who had stopped eltrombopag 
but was still on study, had not yet reached the Month 6 assessment at the original cut-off are included in 
this analysis. There were in all 41 additional subjects now evaluable at Month 6 (or who withdrew earlier). 
All 46 subjects (30 newly recruited, and 16 newly evaluable for the Month 6 assessment) were enrolled in 
the Extension Cohort, and are presented for analysis. Longer follow-up of Study AUS01T and further 
evidence of the efficacy and safety of eltrombopag added to standard immunosuppressive therapy (IST) 
in IST-naïve severe aplastic anemia (SAA) subjects is provided. Overall median (min-max) follow-up now 
extends to 61, 47, 33 and 22 months in Cohort 1, 2, 3 and combined Cohort 3 + Extension Cohort, 
respectively. 
During the first cut-off period the majority of subjects (60.2%) were Caucasian (White).

Recruitment 
Recruitment was not randomized between the different cohorts.  
Study initiation date: 02-Jul-2012 (first subject first visit). The study is still ongoing. 
Conduct of the study 
The study was conducted according to the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed 
consent was obtained from each subject in writing before commencement of the treatment. 
The study protocol was amended 25 times prior to data cut-off (30 Sept-2016). The main protocol 
amendments were the following: 
• 
• 
• 
To increase the accrual ceiling to 31 subjects from 25 subjects 
To remove the following exclusion criterion: Subjects with a PNH clone size in granulocytes of > 
50% by flow cytometric analysis. 
To add a second cohort of 31 subjects (Cohort 2) and then increase to 33 subjects. 
•  Modify the eligibility criteria to clarify which lab results will be used to determine eligibility. 
•  Adding a 3rd cohort of 31 subjects with a modified treatment schedule 
•  Adding an Extension cohort of at least 26 subjects who will receive treatment as dictated in 
Cohort 3. 
Baseline data 
Disease characteristics were reflective of a population with advanced disease at baseline. In each cohort, 
approximately one-third of the subjects were diagnosed with very severe aplastic anemia (ANC < 
200/μL), and three subjects in total had glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI) negative neutrophil >50% 
at baseline (an actionable level for treatment of PNH) (Table 25). Demographic characteristics were 
unchanged at the update cut-off (Table 25-2).

Numbers analysed 
As of the data cut-off date of 30-Sep-2016, the eltrombopag post-treatment follow-up was still ongoing in 
61.3% subjects. Results from this primary efficacy analysis of the study are the key efficacy data to 
support the proposed indication. The MAH has updated these data expanding the cut-off date to 28-Feb-
2018. Providing data for 30 additional subjects (8 paediatrics and 22 adults) leading to a total of 92 
patients data presented in the Cohort 3+extension, which is the treatment recommended by the MAH. 
Moreover, with this cut-off-date 41 additional subjects were evaluable at month 6 for the efficacy, leading 
to a total of 87 subjects evaluable in Cohort 3+extension. 
Study AUS01T consisted of 3 consecutive cohorts of subjects, Cohort 1, 2, and 3, and an extension to the 
third cohort (where enrollment continues) to which subjects were sequentially enrolled. After the 28-Feb-
2018 cut-off-date the efficacy population, derived from the Full Analysis Set (FAS), comprised 153 
subjects in Study AUS01T with the target indication who received at least 1 dose of study drug. The 
median duration of exposure to eltrombopag was 183 days in Cohort 3 + Extension (h-ATG (Day 1-4) + 
CsA (Day 1-Month 6)) + eltrombopag (Day 1-Month 6).  
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy analysis: complete response at month 6 
The  study  met  its  primary  efficacy  objective  for  each  cohort.  The  null  hypothesis  of  complete  response 
rate ≤10% was rejected as ≥7 CRs were observed at month 6 assessment among the 31 subjects in each 
cohort. 
The study met its primary efficacy objective for the 3 cohorts that used a Simon two-stage design, with 
complete hematological response was observed at the month 6 landmark visit in 33.3% and 25.8% of 
subjects in Cohort 1 and 2, respectively, and in over half of the subjects in Cohort 3 (58.1%). There was 
no primary efficacy objective specific to the Extension Cohort, with the exception of the interest in 
collecting additional safety and efficacy within the target regimen. Complete hematological response at 
month 6 was observed in 24 (52.2%) subjects in combined Cohort 3 + Extension Cohort. 
Between 30-Sep-2016 and 28-Feb-2018 in the Extension Cohort, 41 additional subjects had reached the 
Month  6  visit  or  withdrew  earlier.  The  proportion  of  complete  responses  at  Month  6  in  the  combined 
Cohort 3 + Extension Cohort for the new period was reported at 43.7% (95% CI: 33.1-54.7) (Table 26).

Supportive, sensitivity and subgroup analyses 
Complete response at month 6 on per-protocol set (PPS) 
The  PPS  analysis  (including  only  subjects  with  sufficient  exposure  to  the  study  treatment  and  without 
major  protocol  deviations)  on  complete  hematological  response  at  month  6  was  consistent  with  the 
primary analysis on the FAS.(Table 27 cut-off 30-Sept-2016 and Table 27-2 cut-off 28-Feb-2018).

Table 27-2.  Complete hematological response rate at month 6-PPS  (cut-off 28-Feb-2018). 
Analysis on hematological responses defined as normalization of parameters 
A sensitivity analysis was also performed using a more stringent definition for complete response, taken 
as  complete  normalisation  of  hematological  parameters,  on  2  consecutive  serial  blood  count 
measurements at least one week apart: 
•  ANC ≥ 1500/μL 
• 
Platelet count ≥ 150x103/μL 
•  Hemoglobin ≥ 12 g/dL (female) or ≥ 13 g/dL (male)

Table 29-2. Complete response at month 6 by subgroup-FAS (cut-off 28-Feb-2018). 
As stated before, a reduction in complete response rates in Cohort 3 + Extension between both cut-offs 
was seen when results from the update was considered (52.2% vs 43.7%) and also with results obtained 
in Cohort 3 where complete response was reached in 58.1% of patients. Regarding results by subgroups 
differences  in  complete  response  between  some  of  these  subgroups  were  observed  but  the  number  of 
subjects  concerned  was  too  small  to  draw  any  conclusion  (i.e.  age).  Differences  were  also  observed 
between  gender  with  48.7%  of  complete  responders  in  male  vs.  39.6%  in  female  subjects.  An  ad  hoc 
logistic regression investigating the prognostic factors associated with complete response was carried out 
and included age, gender, pre-study platelet, neutrophil and reticulocytes counts as well as the severity 
of the disease. According to the MAH analysis, the severity of the disease and absolute neutrophil count 
emerged as the only significant prognostic factors. 
Based on these prognostic factors identified by the MAH, complete response along Cohort 3 + extension 
(cut-off  28-Feb-2018)  was  almost  20%  higher  in  the  subgroup  of  severe  aplastic  anemia  (sAA)  when 
compared  with  the  subgroup  of  very  severe  aplastic  anemia  (vsAA)  (52.1%  and  33.3%,  respectively). 
Differences in complete response between subgroups of sAA and vsAA along Cohort 3 + extension (cut-
off  30-Sept-2016)  were  around  25%  (63.0%  and  36.8%,  respectively).  However,  these  results  seemed 
lower  (around  3.5%)  for  Cohort  3  where  59.1%  and  55.6%  of  patients  with  sAA  and  vsAA  reached 
complete response. A higher proportion of patients with vsAA were included in Cohort 3 + extension for 
both cut-offs in relation to Cohort 3 (29%, 48%, 55% for Cohort 3, Cohort 3 + extension cut-off 30-Sept-
2016 and cut-off 28-Feb-2018, respectively). 
Complete response at month 6 is also presented by subgroups in figures 6-9 (both cut-offs) for all cohorts

Cohort 3 + extension (28-Feb-2018). 
Secondary efficacy results 
Subjects were enrolled sequentially into cohorts i.e. once enrollment into a given cohort was completed, 
enrollment  into  the  next  cohort  started.  Therefore,  the  follow-up  of  subjects  in  a  given  cohort  was 
approximately  1  year  longer  than  the  follow-up  of  subjects  in  the  next  cohort  (e.g.  1.5  year  more  for 
Cohort 1 as compared to Cohort 2). At the original 30-Sept-2016 cut-off, none of the subjects in Cohort 3 
had yet reached 2 year assessment, and none of the subjects in the Extension Cohort had yet reached 1 
year assessment. Therefore the data beyond month 6 were not yet mature enough for an evaluation of 
the  long-term  efficacy.  With  the  update  cut-off  (28-Sept-2018),  in  the  combined  Cohort  3  +  extension  
14  subjects  had  not  yet  reached  the  1  year  assessment  (or  withdrew  earlier),  including  5  subjects  who 
had not yet reached month 6 and were still receiving eltrombopag (all in the extension cohort). Efficacy 
by  assessment  time  such  as  hematological  response  by  assessment  time,  duration  of  response, 
maintenance of response or overall survival are presented cumulative as of the update cut-off and are not 
compared with the data at the original cut-off.

Hematological response by assessment time 
In Cohort 3, all subjects had already reached the Year 2 assessment (or withdrew earlier). In this cohort, 
the rate of complete responders was relatively stable and above 50% at all time points from Month 6 to 
Year 2. There was an incidence of relapse + withdrawal of 25.8% at Year 1 and 35.5% at Year 2. For this 
period,  Cohort  3  compares  favorably  against  Cohorts  1  and  2,  that  had  lower  complete  response  rates 
(always  below  24%  in  Cohort  1  and  below  42%  in  Cohort  2)  and  higher  rates  of  withdrawal  +  relapse 
(70.0%  and  38.7%,  respectively  in  Cohorts  1  and  2  at  Year  1,  and  73.3%  and  45.2%,  respectively  in 
Cohorts 1 and 2 at Year 2). Beyond Year 2, the results should be interpreted with caution as in Cohort 3 
only 17 subjects over 31 (55%) had yet reached Year 3 (or withdrew earlier) (Table 31). 
Table 31. Hematological responses by assessment time - FAS (cumulative as of 28-Feb-2018). 
Some subjects who were partial responders at Month 6 became complete responder at a later 
assessment. Although a confirmatory sample was not required from Year 1 onward, this improvement 
was due to a continuous increase of blood counts in most patients. Respectively 3 (10.0%), 10 (32.3%) 
and 8 (9.2%) subjects in Cohort 1, Cohort 2 and combined Cohort 3 + Extension Cohort improved their 
response after Month 6. Subjects in combined Cohort 3 + Extension Cohort had shorter follow-up and 
higher complete response rate at Month 6 which could explain the lower proportion of subjects who 
improved their response after Month 6. Several pediatric subjects, 3 in Cohort 2 (3 years, 7 years and 16 
years); 2 Subjects in combined Cohort 3 + Extension Cohort (5 years and 11 years)  with very severe 
aplastic anemia at baseline reached a complete response for the first time at Year 1 or later. 2 other 
pediatric subjects, with severe aplastic anemia, one in Cohort 1 (17 years) and another in combined 
Cohort 3 + Extension Cohort (14 years) reached also a complete response at Year 1 or later (Table 32).

Duration of response 
•  Duration of complete response 
As planned per protocol, none of the subjects in Cohort 1 and only approximately half of the responding 
subjects in Cohort 2 received a maintenance dose of CsA beyond the month 6 landmark visit. 
In Cohorts 2 and 3, the relapse-free (95% CI) probability estimate at 18 months after complete response 
was first observed compared favorably (80.2% and 79.7%, respectively) to Cohort 1 (53.8%) (Table 33). 
Results  for  longer  time  should  be  interpreted  with  caution,  as  not  all  responders  in  Cohort  3  were  on 
study long enough to have been followed more than 18 months after response.

In  Cohort  1,  almost  half  of  complete  responders  relapsed  within  1  year  whereas  in  other  cohorts  only 
20% relapsed within 1.5 years, (Figure 10).

For overall (complete + partial) responders the relapse-free (95% CI) probability at 18-month was 40.0 
(21.3,58.1),  69.2  (47.8,83.3),  77.8  (57.1,89.3),  72.9  (58.1,83.2)  for  Cohort  1,  Cohort  2,  Cohort  3  and

Maintenance of response 
• 
Effect of CsA maintenance dose on duration of overall response 
The  addition  of  a  maintenance  dose  of  CsA  from  Month  6  to  Month  24  was  implemented  with  protocol 
amendment  15  in  subjects  who  were  responders  at  Month  6.  It  started  with  Subject  AUS01T-046  in 
Cohort  2  and  continued  with  all  subjects  enrolled  thereafter.  In  Cohort  2,  responders  who  used 
maintenance  dose  of  CsA  (approximately  half  of  subjects  enrolled)  showed  a  longer  median  duration  of 
overall  response  of  35.5  months  vs.  26.0  months  for  subjects  who  did  not  in  this  cohort,  and  a  better 
relapse-free probability estimate at 1.5 years (80.0% vs 54.5%), (Table 35 and figure 12). In Cohort 1 
where no subject used maintenance CsA, a lower rate of relapse-free probabilities and a shorter median 
duration of overall response was also observed when compared with cohorts that used maintenance CsA. 
The addition of maintenance CsA (low dose) was associated with a prolonged duration of response.

Overall survival 
In  the  combined  Cohort  3  +  Extension  Cohort,  3  subjects  died  leading  to  a  probability  of  survival  at  2 
years of 96% (Table 36 and Figure 13). This is similar to what was reported in the most recent historical 
studies  of  IST  alone,  see  (Scheinberg  et  al  2009)  (Scheinberg  et  al  2011),  but  higher  than  the  70% 
survival observed at 2 years in the study reported by (Rosenfeld et al 2003).

Subject-reported outcomes 
Updated subject-reported outcomes have not been provided. The one´s described below are data from 
30-Sept-2016 cut-off. 
PROMIS scores 
Self-reported  health  outcomes  PROMIS  Global  Physical  (GPH)  and  Mental  (GMH)  Health,  sleep 
disturbance,  anxiety,  depression  and  applied  cognitive  abilities  were  secondary  endpoints.  For  analysis 
and ease of interpretation, scores are converted into T-scores where a score of 50 represents the mean 
for  the  US  population  with  a  standard  deviation  of  10.  A  higher  score  represents  more  of  the  concept 
being measured e.g. a person who has a score of 60 for the GPH or GMH scales is one standard deviation 
better  than  the  general  population.  Therefore,  on  the  GPH  and  GMH,  higher  scores  represent  better 
Assessment report

quality-of-life outcomes whereas on the symptom scales, a higher score represents a worse outcome e.g. 
more sleep disturbance, more anxiety and/or more depression.  
A  change  of  10  points  on  each  PROMIS  subscale  is  equal  to  one  standard  deviation  difference  from  the 
population  mean;  according  to  the  MAH  this  value  may  be  useful  for  interpretation  of  clinical  relevance 
where minimally important differences (MID) have not been established. For 3 subscales, published MIDs 
are  available:  Sleep  disturbance  MID=7.4  (Purvis  2017);  anxiety  MID=4.5  (Yost  2011);  and  depression 
MID=4.5 (Yost 2011). 
At Baseline, mean T-scores on the GPH ranged between 43.5 and 44.6 in the 3 cohorts. 
FACT scores 
According to the MAH data from Health related quality of life Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy 
assessment (FACT) (Wagner et al 2008) showed clinically mean improvements over time on the 3 
symptom specific FACT scales among groups of subjects who responded to eltrombopag treatment.

who  achieved  a  CR  at  month  6  landmark,  divided  by  the  total  number  of 
subjects enrolled into that cohort who had reached the month 6 landmark or 
had withdrew earlier for any reason and including non-evaluable subjects. 
Supportive studies 
Instead of performing a direct comparison and in order to assess the effect of the addition of eltrombopag 
to standard therapy the MAH retrieved efficacy data from 4 historical studies. For this retrieval, a search 
in PubMed was made using specified search criteria (i.e. (((aplastic anemia[Title]) OR aplastic 
anaemia[Title]) AND clinical trials) AND ("2001/01/01"[Date - Publication] : "2016/09/23"[Date - 
Publication])). 
All studies reported within a time period of approximately 15 years, 1-Jan-2001 to 23-Sept-2016, were 
considered for inclusion, in addition to studies prior to 1-Jan-2001 if they were mentioned in AUS01T 
study protocol as potential historical controls. 
As the search continued during the preparation of the dossier, a later update included publications issued 
from 2016/09/23 to 2017/12/31 which resulted in 5 additional publications, including (Townsley et al 
2017) publication reporting results from AUS01T study. 
In summary, a total of 71 publications excluding (Townsley et al 2017) (the subject of this dossier) were 
considered for further investigation. These trials were evaluated for inclusion using the following criteria: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620491/2019 
Page 68/162 
 
  
  
 
 
1. IST-naïve patients included in the trial, 
2. IST consisting of h-ATG+CsA for at least one arm, 
3. Definition of complete and/or overall responses based on similar criteria than AUS01T and response 
rate at month 6 reported, 
4. IST regimen comparable to AUS01T in terms of doses and durations 
Only studies that met all the criteria above were included as historical controls. This selection resulted in 
3 studies (Rosenfeld et al 2003, Scheinberg et al 2009 and Scheinberg et al 2011). A fourth study 
mentioned in the protocol and published earlier (Tisdale et al 2000) met the above criteria and was added 
to the pool of historical control studies. All 4 studies were coincidentally conducted at the NIH, the same 
institution conducting AUS01T.  
For completeness, a literature search of studies published before 2001 did not show any other study that 
meet the criteria except the Tisdale et al 2000 mentioned above and the Rosenfeld et al 1995 of which an 
updated version published in 2003 is already used as a historical control study. Furthermore, data 
obtained from NIH individual subject data from the 2 most recent studies (Scheinberg et al 2009 and 
Scheinberg et al 2011), including demographic data and baseline blood counts that defined the severity of 
the disease (age, gender, platelet count, neutrophil count and reticulocyte count). 
Historical studies 
Study population 
The historical studies reported in Scheinberg et al 2011, Scheinberg et al 2009, Tisdale et al 2000, and 
Rosenfeld et al 2003 all enrolled subjects with SAA who were also treatment-naïve; however, the 
Scheinberg et al 2011 and Rosenfeld et al 2003 studies only used treatment with h-ATG+CsA. The 
Scheinberg et al 2009 study and the Tisdale et al 2000 study had 2 treatment arms with treatment arm 
using h-ATG+CsA as comparison. The populations of interest in these historical studies are the arms 
using the IST treatment regimen alone (specifically h-ATG+CsA arms), as they are used for comparison 
to the pivotal Study AUS01T with h-ATG+CsA + eltrombopag. 
Demographic and other subject characteristics 
A comparison of key demographics and other baseline characteristics is presented for the h-ATG+CsA 
arm of the historical studies and Study AUS01T (Cohort 3+Extension) in table 38 (cut-off 30-Sept-2018). 
Subjects in each of the 4 historical studies had SAA similar to Study AUS01T, as determined by individual 
study inclusion criteria. All historical studies had paediatric subjects as in Study AUS01T, except for 
Tisdale et al 2000 with only adults participating. 
Some demographic information was unavailable in each of the historical study publications.

Table 38. Subject demographics and baseline characteristics in the h-ATG+CsA arms of 
historical studies and Study AUS01T (cohort 3+extension) (cut-off 30-Sept-2016). 
A detailed pediatric age ranged included in historical studies used for the comparison with pivotal study 
was requested to the MAH. Table 39 presents the age distribution from patients in the h-ATG+CsA arm 
for the historical control studies and from patients with efficacy data at month 6 for Study AUS01T using 
the cut-off date of 28-Feb-2018. Except the Tisdale et al 2000 study which enrolled only adult patients, 
the proportion of paediatric patients is similar in each of the historical studies and Study AUS01T. The age 
range in Table 38 was for all patients enrolled in both treatment arms in Scheinberg 2011 (i.e. over the 
60+60 patients studied) and Scheinberg 2009 (i.e. in the 42+35 patients studied), whereas it was limited 
to only patients treated with h-ATG+CsA alone in Table 39.

In Scheinberg et al 2011, a total of 120 consecutive subjects, 2 to 77 years of age, were randomly 
assigned to h-ATG+CsA or r-ATG+CsA (60 in each group). In the h-ATG+CsA arm, 1 subject had early 
evolution, and 59 subjects were evaluable at 3 months. Following this, 1 subject discontinued the study 
due to progressive disease, and 58 subjects were evaluable at 6 months. 
In Scheinberg et al 2009, 77 consecutive subjects with SAA (42 in the h-ATG+CsA arm; 35 in the h-
ATG+CsA + sirolimus arm) received an initial course of treatment. In total, 8 subjects died; 5 were in the 
h-ATG+CsA arm. 
Thirty-one subjects were enrolled into the study Tisdale et al 2000. Sixteen subjects were assigned h-
ATG+CsA, and 15 were assigned cyclophosphamide+CsA. The study was terminated prematurely after 3 
early deaths occurred in the cyclophosphamide arm within 6 weeks of the start of treatment. At a median 
follow-up of 667 days, 4 deaths had occurred (3 in the cyclophosphamide arm and 1 in the h-ATG arm 
due to refractory pseudomonal sepsis on Day 151). 
In Rosenfeld et al 2003, a cohort of 122 subjects (31≤18 years and 91>18 years) with SAA were enrolled 
into the single-arm study to receive h-ATG+CsA. Sixteen patients (13%) died prior to their 3-month 
evaluation (mainly due to fungal infection). 
Compliance 
No information on compliance was available in Scheinberg et al 2011, Scheinberg et al 2009, Tisdale et al 
2000, and Rosenfeld et al 2003. 
Treatment exposure 
No information, or very limited information, on treatment exposure was available in Scheinberg et al 
2011, Scheinberg et al 2009, Tisdale et al 2000, and Rosenfeld et al 2003. 
In Scheinberg et al 2011, the median follow-up was 839 days (28 months) (range: 2 to 1852 days) for all 
subjects and 891 days (30 months) (range: 185 to 1852 days) for surviving subjects. In Rosenfeld et al 
2003, the median follow-up at the time of the 6-month analysis was 7.2 years. 
Efficacy results in historical studies and comparison of Study AUS01T with historical efficacy 
data 
Complete response rate and overall response rate 
Indirect comparisons of CR results at month 6 from Study AUS01T (eltrombopag + h-ATG+CsA) to 
historical data (h-ATG+CsA alone) were performed for subject-level data (using propensity score 
matching and IPTW propensity score methods) and study summary-level data (using frequentist fixed 
effect, frequentist random effects, and Bayesian MAP methods). For CR, 3 historical studies were used for 
the comparison using study summary-level data, and 2 for the subject-level data. 
Complete response rates as presented by the MAH according to results obtained by Scheinberg et al 
2011, Scheinberg et al 2009 and Tisdale et al 2000 for the h-ATG+CsA arms were 11.7%, 7.1%, and 
12.5% at 3 months, with improved responses at 6 months of 20.0%, 11.9%, and 25.0%, respectively 
(Table 40). However, results from Scheinberg 2011 provided by the MAH are based on data from NIH, not 
available in publications selected according to bibliographic search proposed and therefore impossible for 
our part to review. Results from Tisdale 2000 provided by the MAH differ from the one available in the 
publication where only rough efficacy results can be extracted from a graph available in the publication 
(around 35% of patients, not 25% as stated by the Applicant, reached CR). Complete response rates for 
historical study Rosenfeld et al 2003 were not provided in the publications.

Overall response rates as presented by the MAH according to results obtained by Scheinberg et al 2011, 
Scheinberg et al 2009, Tisdale et al 2000 and Rosenfeld et al 2003 for the h-ATG+CsA arms were at 6 
months of 68.3%, 61.9%, 56.30% and 61.5% respectively (Table 40). 
Table 40. Complete response rates in historical control studies and Study AUS01T (cut-off 28-
Feb-2018). 
The overall treatment effect (i.e. difference from the CR between historical and AUS01T Study) as shown 
in table 40 is between 26.9% and 28.4%, depending on the method for the comparison performed. In 
addition, overall the treatment effect measured as OR (i.e. difference from the OR between historical and 
AUS01T Study) as shown in table 40 is between 9.9% and 16.3%, depending on the method for the 
comparison performed. 
In the comparison with the historical studies, no responses rates (CR or OR) by age range have been 
provided. 
Duration of response 
In the historical studies, the duration of response is represented by the incidence of relapse. In 
Scheinberg et al 2009, the incidence of relapse at 3 years was 25% for the h-ATG+CsA arm, with 6 
subjects relapsing. Four of these subjects had completed the CsA taper, and two had relapsed during 
tapering. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620491/2019 
Page 72/162 
 
  
  
 
 
In the h-ATG+CsA arm of Scheinberg et al 2011, the incidence of relapse at 3 years (calculated with the 
use of Kaplan–Meier estimates) was 28% (95% CI: 9 to 43). For the subjects receiving h-ATG+CsA in 
Rosenfeld et al 2003, the cumulative incidence of relapse among responders was approximately 35% at 5 
years. In this study, age, sex, delay between diagnosis and protocol entry, ANC prior to treatment, or 
presumed etiology were not associated with relapse. Qualitative blood counts at 3 months were also not 
associated with relapse. 
Overall survival 
The 3-year OS for subjects in the h-ATG+CsA taper arm in Scheinberg et al 2009 was 90%. After a 
median follow-up of 42 months, the median survival had not been reached in either treatment arm. In 
total, eight subjects died; five were in the h-ATG+CsA arm and three in the h-ATG+CsA+sirolimus arm. 
Three died from infectious complications, two died from transplant-related complications, one died of 
heart failure, one died in a car accident, and one died at home of unknown causes. 
In Scheinberg et al 2011, the OS rate at 3 years was 96% (95% CI: 90 to 100) in the h-ATG+CsA arm 
(vs. 76%, 95% CI: 61 to 95 in the r-ATG arm, p=0.04). Of the four deaths in the h-ATG arm, one each 
resulted from intracranial hemorrhage, sepsis, and lung cancer, and one occurred after stem cell 
transplantation. 
In Tisdale et al 2000, at median follow-up of 667 days, one death had occurred in the ATG group due to 
refractory pseudomonal sepsis on Day 151 (three deaths occurred in the cyclophosphamide arm). 
However, the OS comparison did not reach significance (p=0.26). 
Clonal evolution 
In Scheinberg et al 2009, four subjects in the h-ATG+CsA arm of this study showed evidence of clonal 
evolution (3 to monosomy 7 and 1 with complex cytogenetics). Of the 3 subjects who evolved to 
monosomy 7, 1 had died, 1 developed leukemia, and 1 was receiving only supportive care. 
In Scheinberg et al 2011, the cumulative incidence of clonal evolution at 3 years (in all subjects, those 
with and without a response) was 21% (95% CI: 7 to 33) in the h-ATG+CsA arm. Among the 60 subjects 
treated with h-ATG+CsA, 1 each had deletion 3, deletion 5q, deletion 13q, deletion 20q, and leukemia, 
and 4 had monosomy 7. 
Survival after clonal evolution in Rosenfeld et al 2003 was poor, as over 60% of subjects who had 
evolved (all with monosomy 7), had died within 3 years of the event. An assessment of evolution on 
survival using a Cox regression model with a time-varying covariate, showed that subjects who had 
evolved were at seven times the risk of death compared with those who had not evolved (p<0.001). 
Independent substantiation studies 
Study E1202 
Results from [Study E1202] independently provide further data on the efficacy of the addition of 
eltrombopag to IST in treatment-naïve subjects with MAA or SAA. In this study, the addition of 
eltrombopag to r-ATG+CsA demonstrated that this treatment is an improvement over r-ATG+CsA alone. 
Although Scheinberg et al 2011 confirmed that the hematological response rate in SAA subjects with h-
ATG was significantly higher than with r-ATG (68% vs. 37% at 6 months, p<0.001), the addition of 
eltrombopag to r-ATG+CsA in Study E1202 still showed improvement in response in subjects with SAA 
compared to r-ATG+CsA alone in Scheinberg et al 2011 at 6 months (57% vs. 37%, respectively). 
The median duration of eltrombopag was 168.5 days (range, 125 to 172 days). Ten subjects were 
enrolled and received eltrombopag. The median age was 55.5 years, and 7 of the subjects were female. 
All subjects were Asian (Japanese heritage). The median time since diagnosis of AA was 0.59 months. At 
baseline, the severity of AA was moderate or moderately severe (Stage II or III) in 3 subjects and severe 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620491/2019 
Page 73/162 
 
  
  
 
or very severe (Stage IV or V) in 7 subjects (including 4 subjects with Stage V). Six subjects were 
transfused with red blood cells (RBCs) within 8 weeks before starting r-ATG+CsA and 8 were transfused 
with platelets within 4 weeks before starting r-ATG+CsA. 
Median baseline values for platelets, hemoglobin, neutrophils, and reticulocytes were 14.3×103/μL, 77.5 
g/L, 0.26×103/μL, and 10×103/μL, respectively. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the ORR (CR and PR rates) at 6 months after the start of treatment 
(Week 26). The ORR at Week 26 was 70.0% (7 of 10), with no CRs. The ORR was 100% (3 of 3) in 
subjects with non-severe AA and 57.1% (4 of 7) in subjects with SAA. In comparison, in Scheinberg et al 
2011, the ORR in a similar population at 6 months treated with r-ATG+CsA alone was 37%. The ORR at 
Week 52 was 60.0% (6 of 10); all responses in 6 subjects were PRs. 
Of 7 partial responders at Week 26, 6 maintained PR until Week 52 despite interruption of eltrombopag 
after entering the Extension part according to the dose adjustment criteria. The remaining 1 responder 
had a relapse by Week 52 assessment. No delayed responses occurred, as subjects who had not 
responded by Week 26 did not respond in subsequent weeks. 
At baseline, 6 of 10 subjects were RBC transfusion dependent. Of the 6 subjects, 4 had been RBC 
transfusion independent at least for 8 weeks after initiation of treatment with r-ATG+CsA until Week 52. 
The 4 subjects became independent by Week 26 assessment, and 3 of them maintained independence 
until the clinical data cut-off for Week 52 analysis. The other 1 subject restarted RBC transfusion due to 
lack of efficacy during the Extension part. Four subjects were independent of RBC transfusion at baseline 
but required RBC transfusion after initiating the r-ATG+CsA therapy. Thereafter, they became 
independent of RBC transfusion by the Week 26 assessment. Of 4 subjects, 3 had been independent until 
the clinical data cut-off for Week 52 analysis. The other 1 subject achieved PR at Week 26 assessment 
but subsequently needed RBC transfusion. 
At baseline, 8 of 10 subjects were platelet transfusion dependent. Of the 8 subjects, 5 had been 
independent of platelet transfusion at least for 4 weeks after initiation of treatment with r-ATG+CsA until 
Week 52. Of these 5 subjects, 4 were platelet transfusion independent at Week 52 assessment. In the 
remaining 1 subject, platelet transfusion was required after entering the Extension part. Two subjects 
who were platelet transfusion independent at baseline were transfusion independent at Week 52 
assessment. For subjects who entered the Extension part, the median platelet counts, hemoglobin, 
neutrophil counts, and reticulocyte counts were stable after Week 26 assessment, though hematologic 
values had a great variability. No deaths were reported during the study. 
According to the MAH the results indicated improvement with the addition of eltrombopag to r-ATG+CsA 
for subjects with moderate or more severe AA who had not received prior ATG+CsA-based IST. 
Boddu et al 2017/Kadia et al 2015 
Results from Boddu et al 2017 (and in Kadia et al 2015) independently provide further data on the 
efficacy of the addition of eltrombopag to IST in treatment-naïve subjects. The single-arm, Phase-II study 
in subjects with severe and non-severe AA, presented in Boddu et al 2017 (and Kadia et al 2015), 
evaluated 2 sequential cohorts of interest (of the 5 total cohorts): 
1. h-ATG+CsA (plus prednisone/granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)) alone 
2. eltrombopag + h-ATG+CsA (plus prednisone/G-CSF) 
A total of 95 treatment-naïve AA (63 severe or very severe and 32 non severe AA) subjects were 
enrolled; 75 out the 95 subjects were treated with ATG-based IST regimen and 62 had evaluable 
response at a minimum of 3-month post-IST. ORRs were 74% (46/62); best attained response at any 
time was a CR in 32 (70%), and PR in 14 (30%). Boddu et al. 2017 did not specify how many evaluable 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620491/2019 
Page 74/162 
 
  
  
 
subjects were assigned to the above arms. Kadia et al 2015 indicated that 17 and 14 evaluable, 
treatment-naïve SAA subjects were treated with IST alone and eltrombopag + IST respectively; 10 (59%) 
and 11 (79%) responded to IST alone and Eltrombopag + IST, at any time during the study and 4 (24%) 
and 3 (21%) had a complete response. Kadia et al. 2015 concluded that despite including older pts and 
those with significantly lower blood counts, the cohort receiving eltrombopag had a higher ORR than IST 
alone, albeit with a longer time to response.  
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
No  formal  dose  finding  study  has  been  performed.  Instead,  a  rationale  has  been  provided  based  on 
results from the refractory SAA study (AUS28T), the exposure observed between paediatric and adult ITP 
patients  vs.  paediatric  SAA  patients,  as  well  as  the  PK/PD  results  and  safety  profile  obtained  from  the 
AUS01T updated cut-off (28-Feb-2018). 
In AUS28T Study where subjects with refractory SAA were included, haematological responses were only 
observed  while  receiving  150  mg/day  of  eltrombopag,  adjusted  for  age  (<12  years)  and  ethnicity 
(East/South-East  Asian).  Almost  all  patients  reached  this  maximum  dose  and,  therefore,  it  was 
considered the most effective dose. 
The  exposure  to  eltrombopag  for  paediatric  and  adult  ITP  patients,  based  on  results  from  PETIT  and 
PETIT  2  studies,  showed  that  the  exposure  after  dose-normalised  PK  parameters  for  adults  and  12-17 
years old patients was similar which supports the use of the same dosing for both age groups (i.e. 150 
mg/day in patients >12 years old). On the contrary, dose-normalised PK parameters in children aged 1-5 
years  and  6-11  years  resulted  in  similar  exposures  but  higher  (approximately  2-fold)  compared  to 
children  aged  12-17  years.  This  would  support  the  use  of  75  mg/day  as  the  initial  dose  in  these  age 
groups.  In  addition,  popPK  analysis  in  ITP  paediatric  patients  in  the  younger  group  (2-5  years)  showed 
that a lower body weight was associated with lower clearance and volume parameters. Therefore, a more 
conservative approach using a weight-based dosing strategy was proposed for this age group.  
PK/PD  results  and  safety  profile  obtained  from  the  AUS01T  updated  cut-off  (28-Feb-2018)  were 
considered.  With  these  new  data  33  additional  patients  from  the  extension  cohort  were  included 
compared to the original 19 patients in the initial cut-off (30-Sept-2016). These new data included overall 
50  patients:  39  patients  aged  >18  years,  8  patients  aged  12-17  years  and  only  3  patients  aged  6-11 
years. No patient aged 2-5 years or Asian patients were included in this assessment. Data revealed that 
dose-normalised  PK  parameters  in  adults  and  12-17  years  subgroups  were  comparable  showing  similar 
exposure data. In addition and similar to what has been described in ITP pediatric patients, the exposure 
to eltrombopag observed in 6-11 years old subgroup SAA naïve patients was approximately double than 
the exposure described for >12 years SAA naïve patients. 
In  addition,  in  AUS01T  Study,  where  the  majority  of  patients  (72%)  at  the  updated  cut-off  in  the 
extension  cohort  were  receiving  150  mg/day  of  eltrombopag,  the  safety  profile  was  consistent  with  the 
expected safety of eltrombopag in the approved chronic ITP, HCV and refractory SAA indications. 
Although the MAH’s rationale to explain the initial dose used in pivotal trial is acceptable, the PK profile in 
patients  aged  <18  years  cannot  be  considered  established  due  to  the  low  number  of  children  available. 
Concerns  about  the  appropriateness  of  the  dose  used  in  paediatric  patients  (i.e.  <18  years  old)  are 
raised.

Pivotal trial: Study AUS01T 
Efficacy of eltrombopag in the claimed indication is based on study AUS01T a phase I/II, non-randomized, 
single-arm,  single-center  study  designed  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  eltrombopag  in 
combination with h-ATG and CsA in definitive immunosuppressive therapy-naïve subjects with SAA. This 
study,  still  ongoing,  is  an  investigator-sponsored  study  conducted  by  the  Haematology  Branch  of  the 
National  Heart,  Lung  and  Blood  Institute/National  Institutes  of  Health  (NHLBI/NIH)  and  supported  by 
Novartis.  
The trial was designed in an adaptive way that is commonly used in phase I/II single arm trials to assess 
response  rate  at  an  interim  time  point  and  allow  early  termination  of  a  cohort  if  efficacy  is  not  shown. 
This  is  acceptable  in  early  steps  of  development  where  dose  response  and  the  best  regimen  are  being 
studied.  However,  this  study  has  been  submitted  as  the  pivotal  evidence  for  efficacy  in  the  new 
indication. Although it is acknowledged that conducting a randomized controlled trial in this setting could 
be  challenging,  the  inclusion  of  standard  treatment  as  a  comparator  would  have  been  crucial  to  assess 
the contribution of eltrombopag in naïve SAA patients.  
It is worth mentioning that there is an ongoing study comparing hATG+CsA vs hATG+CsA+Eltrombopag 
for SAA (Study RACE) sponsored by European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation with Novartis 
and Pfizer as collaborators. Differences between both studies, mainly in terms of treatment regimen and 
CsA maintenance dosing, have been pointed out by the MAH. According to this, in RACE study treatment 
regimen  is  similar  to  the  one  used  in  Cohort  1  and  2  from  AUS01T  study,  where  efficacy  results  were 
lower  compared  to  Cohort  3.  Also,  maintenance  treatment  with  CsA  is  not  employed  in  RACE  study.  In 
addition, assessment of efficacy in RACE study is limited to 3 months. However, even when a conclusive 
comparison  of  the  results  between  both  trials  is  not  possible,  the  RACE  study  does  demonstrate  that 
performing a randomized controlled trial in this setting (SAA patients) is feasible. Results from this study 
would have been considered supportive for this application; however the results are not yet available. 
As previously mentioned, study AUS01T consisted of 3 consecutive cohorts of subjects, Cohort 1, 2, and 
3, and an extension to the third cohort (where enrolment continues) to which subjects were sequentially 
enrolled. There are 3 sequential cohorts:  
•  Cohort 1: h-ATG (Day 1-4) + CsA (Day 1-Month 6) + eltrombopag (Day 14-Month 6) 
•  Cohort 2: h-ATG (Day 1-4) + CsA (Day 1-Month 6) + eltrombopag (Day 14-Month 3) 
•  Cohort 3 + Extension: h-ATG (Day 1-4) + CsA (Day 1-Month 6) + eltrombopag (Day 1-Month 6) 
The  extension  cohort  was  included  to  recruit  more  subjects  with  the  same  dosing  regimen  as  Cohort  3, 
and collect more data for the analysis of the secondary endpoints within the target regimen. In Cohort 2 
(starting with subject 46) and all of Cohort 3 and Extension, low-dose maintenance CsA was administered 
to subjects who achieved a hematologic response at 6 months. 
The primary endpoint was Complete response (CR) rate at 6 months following h-ATG+CsA+eltrombopag, 
defined as (all 3 were to be met): 
•  Absolute neutrophil count >1×103/ μL 
•  Platelet count >100×103/ μL 
•  Hgb>10 g/dL 
The secondary endpoints were mainly aimed at assessing CR at 3, 12 months and yearly thereafter up to 
5 years, overall response at 3, 6, 12 months and yearly thereafter up to 5 years, duration of CR and OR, 
overall survival, relapse/duration of response and HRQoL.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620491/2019 
Page 76/162 
 
  
  
 
The primary and secondary endpoints are considered acceptable for the assessment of the treatment in 
SAA.  A  complete  response  would  allow  reducing  the  risk  of  life-threatening  complications  such  as 
recurrent  infections  due  to  neutropenia,  bleeding  episodes  due  to  thrombocypopenia  and  fatigue  due  to 
anemia.  Considering  that  eltrombopag  induces  proliferation  and  differentiation  of  early  bone  marrow 
progenitor cells its action is expected to have effects on multi-lineage blood cells and mainly in platelets. 
Therefore,  the  addition  of  eltrombopag  to  standard  therapy  should  be  accompanied  by  a  decline  in 
transfusions requirements. Among all the affected cell lines, platelet deficiency is considered to be at the 
highest risk since it could not only generate longer hospitalizations but also life threatening bleedings. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The pivotal study included 153 treatment-naïve patients with SAA. Thirty patients were included in cohort 
1, 31 in cohort 2 and 3 and 92 in the cohort 3+extension (cut-off 28-Feb-2018). Previous efficacy results 
were reported at the original cut-off 30-Sept-2016 when 62 patients were included in the cohort 3 + 
extension. The MAH has confirmed that inherited causes were excluded from the study AUS01T.  
• 
Primary endpoint: Complete response (CR) at Month 6 
CR at month 6 was observed in 10 (33.3%), 8 (25.8%) and 18 (58.1%) subjects in cohort 1, cohort 2 
and cohort 3, respectively (FAS population). However, at the updated cut-off, 38 subjects (43.7%) in the 
pooled cohort 3 + extension cohort achieved a CR compared to the data at the original cut-off (52.2%) 
showing to some extent worse result. The MAH links this reduction in efficacy with the inclusion of more 
very severe AA patients  (vSAA) in the updated cohort 3 + extension (44,6%) compared to those 
included in cohort 3 (35.5%) and in cohort 3 + extension at the original cut-off (43.5%). However, in the 
updated cohort (February 2018) 20 and 21 new patients with vSAA and SAA, respectively, were included 
and CR was maintained in vSAA patients (36% in the original cut-off and 33% in the updated cut-off) 
while it was reduced in SAA patients (63% in the original cut-off and 52% in the updated cut-off). These 
data suggest that reduction in global CR (43.7%) could have not been influenced by the severity of the 
disease but by the higher number of patients assessed, bringing the efficacy results closer to reality.  
Improvement in blood counts is of little relevance if this not translated into clinical outcomes (e.g., 
reduction in the number of transfusions). The MAH states that they do not have the complete information 
regarding the transfusions even when legislation regarding transfusions compels blood transfusion 
centres/hospitals to record every transfusion done including information about the receptors (i.e. type 
and date of transfusion as well as patient identification). The MAH argued about the association between 
improvement in cytopenias and survival outcome (Rosenfeld et al 2003). In this publication the authors 
concluded that there is a relationship between platelet or reticulocytes achievements ≥50x103/µl and 
better survival, in relation to platelet or reticulocytes achievements <50x103/µl in survivors/responder at 
three months. Also, the MAH has provided data of improvements in transfusion-free interval and on the 
correlation between CR and longer relapse-free survival when eltrombopag is added to SOC.  However, at 
the time being, we cannot relate changes in transfusion requirements with the addition of eltrombopag to 
SOC, in the absence of a compared study. Therefore, the CHMP consider that the lack of a comparator in 
the pivotal study will continue to be the main unresolved issue. 
There were important differences in CR rate between Cohort 1 and 3 (33.3% vs. 58.1% of CR at month 
6, respectively). The MAH states that since demographic characteristics between the cohorts were similar 
the differences in efficacy can be attributed to the difference in duration of eltrombopag treatment. 
However, the difference was not so large, 14 days in the administration of eltrombopag between both 
cohorts. Moreover, the differences in efficacy among cohorts are reduced when higher number of patients 
are treated (updated cut-off results): 43.7% of CR at month 6 versus 58.1% (i.e. a difference of 
approximately 10% between both cohorts) probably bringing the efficacy results closer to reality.

There were also differences between the proportion of children included in cohort 1 vs. cohort 3 (16.7% 
vs. 25.8% respectively) which could have an impact on the efficacy results. However, the number of 
children included in Cohort 1 was too low it is difficult to draw any conclusion about the impact of children 
on efficacy or the relationship between age and efficacy.  
•  Secondary endpoints: Overall response (CR or PR) 
More than 75% of subjects of the whole population achieved an OR (PR or CR) at month 3 (76.7%, 
77.4%, 87.1%, 79.6% and 75.0% for Cohort 1, 2, 3, 3+extension original and updated cut-off, 
respectively) and improved at month 6 (80%, 87.1%, 93.5%, 84.8% and 79.3% for Cohort 1, 2, 3, 
3+extension original and updated cut-off, respectively). It seems, again, that the response decreases as 
more patients are included in the cohorts. 
•  Secondary endpoints: Duration of the effect 
In patients from Cohort 1 who did not received CsA maintenance treatment beyond month 6 the CR 
dropped from 33.3% at month 6 to 16.7% at month 12. On the contrary, in patients from Cohort 2 who 
did receive CsA as maintenance treatment, CR improved from 25.8% at month 6 to 32.3% at month 12. 
Moreover, for Cohort 2, relapse-free probability estimates for overall response was 72.7% vs. 86.7% at 
month 6 for patients who did not received and received   CsA as maintenance treatment, respectively, 
and 54.5% vs. 80.0% at month 12 for patients who did not received  and received CsA as maintenance 
treatment, respectively.  
Subjects from Cohort 3, at the updated time, had reached the 2 year assessment (or withdrew earlier). In 
this cohort CR was relatively stable and above 50% at all time points from month 6 to year 2. These 
results show favorable results for cohort 3 compared with the cohorts 1 and 2. However, for Cohort 3 and 
3+extension (updated cut-off 28-Feb-2018) the results beyond month 6 have to be read with caution 
since 14 patients have not yet reached 1 year assessment, including 5 subjects who had not yet reached 
month 6 and were still receiving eltrombopag. Furthermore, the maintenance treatment with CsA may 
have played a role in the response beyond month 6. In fact, in Cohort 3 and Cohort 3 + extension 
(updated cut-off) 8 patients who had partial response at month 6 improved their response after this time 
point when they did not received eltrombopag any longer and, on the contrary, were on CsA. Therefore, 
the real benefit of addition eltrombopag to IST in the long-term scenario is questionable.  
Moreover, taking into account that AA is an immune mediated disease and considering the mechanism of 
action of eltrombopag (inductor of proliferation and differentiation of progenitor cells in the bone marrow 
(mainly platelets)) and timoglobulin/CsA (immunomodulators), it seems more plausible that the 
administration of hATG as well as the long term use of CsA are related to this long-term effect. 
•  Secondary endpoints: Overall survival (OS) 
Regarding OS, results at 2 years reported by survival probability estimates were 96% in cohort 3 + 
extension. However, definite results of OS are still pending.  
No efficacy data are available for r-ATG. The fact that in some European countries only r-ATG is available 
could have potentially an impact on the efficacy results. The MAH was asked to discuss this point but this 
issue remains as an uncertainty.  
•  Subgroup analysis 
Subgroup analysis by age, gender, race and severity of the disease have been provided. For most of the 
subgroups numbers are too small as to reach any sound conclusion. As children are included in the 
claimed indication, efficacy assessment by age group deserves further discussion. At cut-off 28 Feb 2018 
and focusing on cohort 3+ extension original and updated cut-off in which the posology selected for the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620491/2019 
Page 78/162 
 
  
  
 
proposed indication was used, only 25 children were included, 1 (2-5 years old), 11 (6-11 years old) and 
13 (12-17 years old).  
In the subgroup of 12-17 years of age CR was observed in 71.4%, 62.5 % and 46.2% of patients in 
cohort 3, cohort 3 + extension original and updated cut-off, respectively. It is observed that only 6 out of 
13 achieved CR. In addition, the number of children aged 2 to 11 years included in the main study 
(n=12) was very limited and a complete response was only seen in one of them.  
As previously mentioned, the MAH attributed the worse efficacy results in the paediatric population to the 
severity of the disease (defined by ANC >200/mcl or <200/mcl for SAA and vSAA, respectively), even 
though the use of G-CSF was permitted during the AUS01T Study. In this sense 57.1% of patients <12 
years included in cohort 3+ extension suffered from very severe disease in comparison to 42.8% of 
patients aged >12 years.  However, the poorer efficacy attributed by the MAH to the severity of the 
disease contradicts the results obtained by Führer et al 2005, where a higher CR was observed in children 
with vSAA treated with IST + G-CSF compared to children with SAA (68% vs 45%, respectively) 
concluding that the more severe disease stage at diagnosis the more favourable outcome. As a general 
rule, a higher response rate and survival is expected in the paediatric population compared to adults due 
to the fact that children have a higher stem-cell reserve. However, results of AUS01T study do not go in 
this direction. In the limited number of children aged 2 to 11 years included (n=12) CR was seen in only 
one of them. It should be also considered that children are not included in the currently approved 
indication (refractory SAA) that it is limited to adults. Based on this, the MAH had proposed during the 
evaluation to restrict the initial indication to paediatric patients 12-17 years of age to reflect the following 
indication wording: 
‘Revolade is indicated for the first-line treatment of acquired Severe Aplastic Anaemia in combination with 
standard immunosuppressive therapy in adult and paediatric patients aged 12 years and above who are 
not eligible for a haematopoietic stem cell transplant at the time of diagnosis’. 
Supportive efficacy data and comparison with AUS01T results 
Supportive efficacy data from other clinical studies in AA were included in the dossier. Study E1202 
evaluated eltrombopag in combination with r-ATG + CsA in treatment naïve Japanese subjects with 
moderate AA or SAA. The study conducted by Boddu et al (2017) was carried out at the MD Anderson 
Cancer Center and evaluated h-ATG + CsA in combination with eltrombopag in treatment-naïve subjects 
diagnosed with AA. This data has been used by the MAH for further substantiation from a non-NIH center. 
However, no comparisons with the pivotal study were done as the design and the results of this study 
were available only as a publication and only limited information is available.  
Data from the pivotal study are compared with historical studies in which patients were treated with h-
ATG + CsA in SAA. The search strategy for the selection of historical studies has been justified by the 
MAH, as requested. The retrieval included the publications by Scheinberg et al 2009, Scheinberg et al 
2011, Tisdale et al 2000, and Rosenfeld et al 2003. From an efficacy point of view, only these historical 
studies are considered relevant as supportive information. 
However, the limitations of using historical controls are well-known and they can be considered as reliable 
as an internal control. The impact on the results of known and unknown prognostic factors for treatment-
naïve SSA patients cannot be controlled in the absence of a randomized clinical trial. In addition, the 
limited number of patients in study AUS01T could have substantial influence on the point estimates of the 
populations by chance, i.e. there is a higher risk that the point estimates could substantially deviate from 
the “true” parameter. In fact, with the updated cut-off (28-Feb-2018) when a more patients were 
included compared to the original cut-off, a reduction in the efficacy results measured as CR have been 
revealed.

The comparisons have been done between historical studies and the cohort 3+extension. The aim of this 
cohort was to increase the number of subjects with the same dosing regimen as Cohort 3 and to collect 
more data for the analysis of the secondary endpoints within the proposed regimen. It is relevant to 
highlight that only part of the whole population studied in each historical study (i.e. groups receiving h-
ATG + CsA) has taken into account for comparison. The age range reported originally for Scheinberg 
2009 and Scheinberg 2011 was for all patients enrolled in both treatment arms in Scheinberg 2009 (77 
[42+35] patients) and in Scheinberg 2011 (120 [60+60] patients). For the comparison, only those 
patients randomized to h-ATG+CsA, i.e., 42 and 60 patients, respectively were used.  
The study by Scheinberg et al 2009 included 77 patients with SAA of 4-78 years of age but the selected 
cohort (h-ATG+CsA) included only 42 patients. The MAH clarified that, for the selected cohort used in the 
comparison, patients between 9-78 years were included and of those 26.2%, 66.7% and 7.1% were <18 
years, 18-64 years and ≥64 years, respectively. However, the age range distribution of patients younger 
than 18 years it is not provided in the publication.  
The study by Scheinberg et al 2011 included 120 patients from 2 to 77 years of age who were assigned to 
hATG or rATG (60 in each group). For the selected cohort used in the comparison, patients between 5-76 
years were included. However, the number of children aged from 2-5, 6-11 and 12-17 years is not 
specified in the paper either.  
Tisdale’s et al study included 31 patients with an age range between 18-67 years and, therefore, no 
children were included. Only 16 who received ATG + CsA were included in the comparison. 
The study by Rosenfeld et al included 122 patients receiving h-ATG+CsA, 31 of whom were <18 years but 
the age range data, again, is not included in the publication.  
The MAH has compared the definition of haematological responses of study AUST01 with those used in 
the mentioned publications. However, it must be taken into account that for one of these historical 
studies (Rosenfeld et al 2003) CR results were not available. In the other three, the definition of CR was 
the same as the one used in AUS01T study. However, data provided on CR for Scheinberg et al 2011 (CR 
20%) and Tisdale et al 2000 (CR 25%) are not provided in the published papers. Only rough efficacy 
results from Tisdale et al 2000 study can be extracted from a graph available in the publication. The MAH 
states that efficacy results from both studies were obtained from NIH, but this is not confirmed by any 
document. Therefore, only one historical study (Scheinberg 2009) with 42 patients included (31 of them 
were adults) could be considered as acceptable for comparison. Nevertheless, there are shortcomings and 
limitations in the comparisons with historical controls and that mainly refer to the bias derived from the 
lack of randomisation. Moreover, in principle, one arm studies could be considered acceptable if 
comparative trials are unfeasible, e.g., due to the impossibility to recruit patients because of the rarity of 
the disease. This does not seem to be the case here as one comparative trial sponsored by EBMT with the 
collaboration of Novartis is currently ongoing (RACE study). 
Comparison of this study (Scheinberg et al 2009) with AUS01T shows that CR of eltrombopag + IST was 
28.4% higher than that of IST alone. However, in this comparison paediatric population is also included 
(11/42 subjects) and, again, the age range distribution of patients younger than 18 years is not provided 
in the publication making it unfeasible to compare efficacy results of patients aged 12-17 years between 
both studies.  
Bearing in mind the following limitations:  
- the absence of a comparative study (eltrombopag + IST vs. IST). The submitted data (study NIH 
AUS01T) do not allow a reliable and valid assessment of the efficacy and safety of Revolade as first line 
treatment of severe aplastic anaemia on top of IST due to the lack of a robust comparison against the 
established treatment. The indirect comparison with historical data cannot overcome this deficiency. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620491/2019 
Page 80/162 
 
  
  
 
results of the ongoing study RACE may provide supportive efficacy and safety data versus standard of 
care in these patients.  
- that the historical studies potentially acceptable included only 42 patients. 
Data provided suggest some treatment effect of eltrombopag on top of IST as a first line treatment in 
adults in terms of CR. However, the lack of a comparator in the pivotal study is the crucial unresolved 
issue that prevents from reaching a positive conclusion on the benefit/risk ratio of Revolade as the first 
line treatment of SAA patients.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
This extension of the indication is based on a single and non-comparative trial in which treatment-naïve 
patients with SAA were included (results from the study AUS01T) showed that CR, the primary endpoint, 
was observed in 33.3%, 25.8% and 58.1% of subjects in cohort 1, cohort 2 and cohort 3, respectively, 
(FAS population) at month 6 of treatment. When cohort 3 and the extension cohort were pooled (cut-off 
28 feb-2018) CR was observed in 43.7% of patients at month 6.  
In the absence of an internal comparator arm in study AUT01 the MAH has provided some comparisons 
with  historical  controls.  Only  one  study  where  CR  was  clearly  provided,  was  considered  valid  for  this 
purpose. This comparison suggests greater efficacy for the combination of eltrombopag and h-ATG+CsA 
than  for  h-ATG+CsA  alone  in  terms  of  CR  at  month  6.  However,  there  are  uncertainties  related  to  the 
inherent limitations of the historical controls and the impossibility to assure that all prognostic factors that 
can have an impact on the results have been controlled in the absence of randomization. 
Data  on  maintenance  of  the  effect  show  better  response  in  patients  treated  with  CsA  beyond  Month  6 
(when eltrombopag treatment was terminated) compared to those not treated with CsA suggesting that 
CsA may play a relevant role in the response of patients beyond month 6.  
No data on clinical efficacy apart from the haematological response has been provided. Transfusion data, 
that  could  show  clinical  benefit  beyond  haematological  response,  was  not  considered  as  an  endpoint  in 
AUS01T  study  so  they  were  not  collected  in  a  systematic  way.  The  lack  of  these  data  is  of  concern. 
Nonetheless, the main question remains: whether any beneficial effects observed in study AUS01T can be 
explained by the addition of eltrombopag due to the lack of comparison.  
Unfortunately,  the  study  design  does  not  allow  either  the  identification  of  patient  populations  who  can 
benefit of the addition of eltrombopag to IST as first line treatment. 
Data in children are particularly limited to conclude on efficacy and safety in this subpopulation. Efficacy 
in adolescents cannot be sufficiently demonstrated either. Furthermore, even if the efficacy and safety of 
adding  Revolade  to  IST  in  SAA  adult  patients  were  considered  demonstrated  the  indication  would  need 
additional refinement and be restricted to adults unsuitable for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.  
Overall, the role of eltrombopag in first-line therapy of naive SAA patients needs to be further elucidated 
as it cannot be concluded based on the data provided.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Eltrombopag  has  been  investigated  in  multiple  clinical  development  programs  since  2004  by  the  initial 
sponsor, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). GSK  was the original Marketing Authorization Holder (MAH) until 2015 
when Novartis acquired eltrombopag. The MAH transfer from GSK to Novartis is still ongoing or has been 
completed in the countries where the product is approved (dates and status vary per country). 
The  cumulative  post-marketing  exposure  worldwide  from  the  first  launch  until  June  2017  is  106,493 
subject-years  [PSUR  version  10-dated  22-Nov-  2017].  Hepatotoxicity,  thromboembolic  events,  post-
therapy  reoccurrence  of  thrombocytopenia,  renal  tubular  toxicity,  hematological  malignancies  and 
cytogenetic  abnormalities  are  adverse  events  of  special  interest  (AESIs).  Cytogenetic  abnormalities, 
although  considered  as  AESI,  were  considered  as  part  of  the  underlying  disease  and  therefore  not 
reported  as  AEs  by  the  Principal  Investigator  and  were  analysed  separately.  Eltrombopag  is  currently 
approved  in  over  45  countries  for  the  treatment  of  subjects  with  SAA  who  are  refractory  to  other 
treatments.  
A serious complication of aplastic anemia (AA) is its evolution to clonal hematologic diseases such as MDS 
and  leukaemia,  which  is  usually  associated  with  the  appearance  of  a  cytogenetic  abnormality  in  bone 
marrow cells. The actuarial risk for this complication has been estimated in other studies at around 15% 
at  5  years.  Conversion  from  normal  to  abnormal  karyotype  occurs  at  a  constant  rate  after  initial 
diagnosis, with about 50% of cases developing within the first 30 months (Maciejewski et al 2002). Clonal 
evolution  involving  chromosome  7  abnormalities  is  frequently  observed  in  SAA,  mostly  in  refractory 
subjects,  who  fare  as  poorly  as  in  primary  MDS,  with  a  high  rate  of  conversion  to  acute  leukaemia. 
However,  cytogenetic  abnormalities  are  not  necessarily  associated  with  a  bad  outcome  or  a  change  in 
symptoms or diagnosis of malignancy, but can be associated with dysplastic changes in bone marrow and 
development  of  MDS  (Maciejewski  et  al  2002).  It  was  previously  assumed  that  the  presence  of  an 
abnormal  cytogenetic  clone  indicated  a  diagnosis  of  MDS  and  not  AA.  However  it  is  now  evident  that 
abnormal  cytogenetic  clones  (such  as  del  (13q),  trisomy  8  and  others),  which  may  be  transient,  are 
present  in up  to  12%  of  subjects  with  otherwise  typical  AA  at  diagnosis  (Gupta  et  al  2006,  Afable  et  al 
2011b). Although monosomy 7 may indicate the likelihood of MDS in children, in adults monosomy 7 can 
also be seen in AA. Evolution of abnormal cytogenetic clones may arise during the course of the disease, 
and  the  appearance  of  a  new  cytogenetic  abnormality  may  provide  evidence  of  clonal  evolution. 
Interestingly, malignant clonal evolution is rare in complete responders of IST. This safety review is based 
on  the  results  of  Study  AUS01T  which  evaluated  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  eltrombopag  in  combination 
with  h-ATG  and  CsA  in  subjects  with  SAA  who  had  not  received  prior  definitive  IST.  Additionally,  the 
safety data from this single-arm study is put into perspective against two Novartis studies conducted in 
Japan,  Study  E1201  and  Study  E1202  and  historical  studies  in  subjects  treated  with  h-ATG  and  CsA. 
Additional  supportive  safety  data  from  the  refractory  studies  for  cytogenetic  abnormalities  are  provided 
from  Study  US28T  and  Study  US18T.  The  list  of  these  studies  and  publications  (Tisdale  et  al  (2000), 
Rosenfeld et al (2003), Scheinberg et al (2009) and Scheinberg et al (2011)) and their contribution to the 
safety analysis is provided in table 41.

Patient exposure 
Exposure in Study AUS01T 
Exposure to eltrombopag was planned from Day 14 to Month 6 (168 days) in Cohort 1, from Day 14 to 
Month 3 (77 days) in Cohort 2 and from Day 1 to Month 6 (182 days) in Cohort 3 and Extension Cohort. 
Exposure to h-ATG was planned from Day 1 to Day 4 (4 days) for all cohorts. The therapeutic dose of CsA 
was planned from Day 1 to Month 6 (182 days) for all cohorts. The maintenance dose of CsA was planned 
from Month 6 to Month 24 (540 days) for subjects enrolled in the study from protocol amendment 15 in

Cohort 2 (starting with Subject 46) and in Cohort 3 and Extension Cohort for subjects who were 
responders at Month 6. 
h-ATG was administered at a dose of 40 mg/kg. CsA dosing was based on body weight, except for obese 
subjects. Total daily dose of CsA for subjects ≥ 12 years and <12 years was 6 mg/kg/day and 12 
mg/kg/day, respectively. For obese subjects, the CsA dose was based on the adjusted body weight. CsA 
dosing was adjusted to obtain a therapeutic trough level between 200 to 400 μg/L. Subjects received a 
starting dose of eltrombopag according to age and ethnicity. Eltrombopag 150 mg once daily was selected 
as the starting dose for non-Asian subjects who were ≥ 12 years old. The median exposure to h-ATG in all 
cohorts was 4 days (range: 3-8 days). 
The median exposures to a therapeutic dose of CsA in Cohort 1, 2, 3, and combined Cohort 3+Extension 
Cohort were 187 days (range: 44-196 days), 185 days (range: 111-197 days), 186 days (range: 40-195 
days), and 183 days (range: 3-224 days), respectively. The median exposures to a maintenance dose of 
CsA in Cohort 2, Cohort 3, and combined Cohort 3 + Extension Cohort were 547 days (range: 13-739 
days), 203 days (range: 29-488 days), and 167 days (range: 12-488 days), respectively. 
The exposure to eltrombopag is presented in table 42. The exposure in Cohort 2 was lower than other 
cohorts as subjects’ exposure to eltrombopag stopped at Month 3 per protocol. Of note, 15 of 31 subjects 
in the Extension Cohort were ongoing on eltrombopag and a therapeutic dose of CsA at the data cut-off 
date (30-Sep-2016). In addition the updated exposure to study treatment (as of 28-Feb-2018) is only 
presented for the combined Cohort 3 + extension cohort (table 42-2). 
Maintenance dose of CsA was ongoing at the original cut-off date (30-Sep-2016) in subjects who had 
started at Month 6 (starting with Subject AUS01T-042 in Cohort 2) and had not withdrew from the study, 
or had not reached Month 24. Therefore, the updated exposure to maintenance dose of CsA is presented 
for all cohorts (except for Cohort 1 and for the subjects in Cohort 2 who never used maintenance dose of 
CsA).

to what was observed at original cut-off, see Table 43, Table 44 and Table 45, respectively.

Dose adjustments of eltrombopag 
The incidences and reasons for eltrombopag dose adjustment in combined Cohort 3 + Extension Cohort 
were similar to what was observed at the original cut-off (Table 46). 
Table 46. Dose adjustments of eltrombopag- Safety set. 
Exposure in Study E1202 
In the safety population of 10 subjects, the median treatment duration of eltrombopag including days of 
interruptions was 344.5 days (range: 125 to 355 days) as of the clinical cut-off date. The median average 
dose of eltrombopag including days of interruptions was 49.8 mg/day (range: 27 to 75 mg/day). 
The median duration of CsA was 365.0 days (range: 287 to 416 days). The median average dose of CsA 
was 135.5 mg/day (range: 82 to 276 mg/day). 
Exposure in Study E1201 
In the safety population of 21 subjects, the median treatment duration of eltrombopag was 189.0 days 
with a maximum duration of 371 days as of the clinical cut-off date. The average daily dose was <100 mg 
for all subjects. Almost all subjects (20/21) received the maximum dose of eltrombopag (100 mg/day) as 
per protocol-specified dose escalation, except one subject who discontinued eltrombopag due to hepatic 
function abnormal. 
Post-marketing exposure 
Estimates of the cumulative subject exposure based upon actual exposure data from completed and 
ongoing clinical trials until 30-Sep-2017 was 4463 subjects. The post marketing exposure data based on 
daily dose of 12.5 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg or 75 mg tablets, brings the cumulative exposure to 106,493 
patient years worldwide, from the first launch until June 2017. 
Subjects disposition 
Study AUS01T 
At the data cut-off 30-Sept-2016, all cohorts had completed their enrolment, except the Extension 
Cohort. A total of 124 subjects were enrolled in the study and 123 received eltrombopag, one subject 
(Subject 11) was misdiagnosed at Baseline (had AML and not SAA), the subject received h-ATG (4 days) 
and CsA (2 weeks) but did not start eltrombopag. Of the 123 subjects, 108 subjects completed treatment 
with eltrombopag. Post-eltrombopag treatment follow-up is ongoing in more than half (61.3%) of the 108 
subjects who completed treatment with eltrombopag.

Between 30-Sept-2016 and 28-Feb-2018 in the extension cohort, 30 additional subjects had received 
treatment with eltrombopag, of whom 5 subjects had not yet reached the month 6 landmark visit (or 
withdrew earlier). In the combined Cohort 3 + extension cohort, 64 subjects (69,6%) had completed the 
6-month treatment with eltrombopag as per protocol. Primary reasons to end eltrombopag and 
percentage of subjects who ended are presented in table 37.  
Table 47. Subject disposition in Study AUS01T (cut-off 28-Feb-2018). 
Study E1202 
At the data cut-off date, 6 of 10 subjects (60%) were still receiving eltrombopag: 3 subjects had 
discontinued for lack of efficacy and one subject had reached protocol defined withdrawal criteria. Four 
subjects had discontinued study treatment by the Week 52 assessment: 2 had completed the follow-up 
assessment and had been withdrawn, the other 2 were undergoing the follow-up assessment at the data 
cut-off date, and their participation in the study was considered as ongoing. Therefore, a total of 8 (80%) 
subjects were ongoing as of the clinical data cut-off date for the Week 52 analysis. 
Study E1201 
Twenty one subjects were enrolled in the study: 16 (76.2%) completed Week 26 assessment, of which 10 
(47.6%) entered the extension part of the study. Of these, 8 subjects (38.1%) were still receiving study 
treatment and 2 had discontinued due to lack of efficacy or withdrawal of consent after Week 26. 
Adverse events 
Safety assessments consisted of collecting AEs, SAEs, with their severity and relationship to study drug. 
Safety assessment included regular monitoring of haematology, blood chemistry and assessments of vital 
signs, physical condition, electrocardiogram (ECG). 
For Study AUS01T, AE summaries included all AEs occurring during the on-treatment period and reported 
in the database. The following AE summaries were produced by cohort for AEs occurring during the on-

treatment period (defined as the time interval between the date of first administration of study treatment 
and up to 30 days after the date of last administration of study drug, excluding the maintenance 
treatment of CsA); overview of AEs, AEs by system organ class and preferred term, summarised by 
maximum common terminology criteria for adverse events grade, relationship to study drug (AEs with 
missing, unlikely, possible, probable or definite attribution to investigational product), seriousness (SAEs 
and non-SAEs), leading to treatment discontinuation (AEs with therapy discontinued), leading to any 
study treatment dose interruption/adjustment (AEs with action taken either dose reduced, therapy 
interruption or both) and leading to fatal outcome. 
Furthermore, AEs occurring during the on-treatment period were summarised by cohort and subgroup 
defined by age overall (<18 years, 18-64 years, ≥65 years) and in paediatric subjects (2-5 years, 6-11 
years, 12-17 years), gender and race. 
Further AE summaries were provided for safety data collected during the first 13-days and during the first 
3-months of treatment and presented for Cohorts 1 and 2 combined and Cohorts 3 and Extension 
combined. 
Only AEs that occurred during the on treatment period (AEs that occur on or within the 30 days after last 
dose of eltrombopag treatment) were included in this SCS. 
In view of the underlying illness, subjects entered the study with abnormally low blood counts considered 
as a grade 3 or more commonly grade 4 toxicity and required frequent platelet and/or red cell 
transfusions. Thus grade 3-4 hematologic laboratory values including thrombocytopenia, platelet-
transfusion dependence, anemia, red cell transfusion dependence, neutropenia, lymphopenia, or 
leukopenia, were not recorded as AEs for this study. The hematologic laboratory values were collected in 
the subject’s source documents, but these abnormalities were not reported or recorded as AEs. 
In addition, the non-hematologic AEs were captured as described below: 
CsA, h-ATG, and eltrombopag are approved drugs with known toxicity profiles; any observed or 
volunteered AEs already listed on the package insert were not reported in the database or to the IRB 
unless the AE was: 
• 
previously unknown (not listed in the prescribing information) 
•  more severe than on package insert 
•  met the criteria of an SAE. 
Cohorts 1 and 2: during first week of h-ATG administration, only events that resulted in clinical action 
(i.e. dose reduction/discontinuation, prolongation of hospitalisation, etc.) were recorded in database. 
Cohorts 3 and Extension: from start of h-ATG to 14 days post-treatment: 
Grade 3 and 4 AEs that result in clinical action (i.e. dose reduction/discontinuation, prolongation of 
hospitalization, etc.) and AEs not attributed to h-ATG were recorded in database. 
Grade 3 and 4 LFTs were recorded in the medical records. Grade 3 and 4 LFTs that persisted at grade 3 
or 4 for greater than 5 days were recorded in the database and reported as AEs. 
Grade 1 events listed as expected in the protocol, consent forms, or other applicable protocol 
documentation were captured in the medical records but not reported as AE in the database. 
An Overview of the AEs and deaths in Study AUS01T is presented in table 48. In the combined Cohort 3 
+ Extension Cohort (cut-off 28-Feb-2018), the incidences of AEs related to eltrombopag, of grades 3/4 
AEs, and of SAEs increased by approximately 10%, compared to the incidences observed at the original 
cutoff (from 61.3% to 70.7%) (Table 48-2). This increase can be explained by a higher number of

subjects exposed to the full 6-month of eltrombopag at the update cutoff. 5.4% (5/92) subjects were on-
treatment at this update cutoff, while 24.2% (15/62) subjects were still on-treatment with eltrombopag 
at the original cut-off and so had not yet reached the Month 6 assessment. No increase in AEs leading to 
treatment discontinuation was observed. 4 additional deaths were recorded at the update cut-off, all 
occurred during the follow-up, and none was related to the study treatment.

Common adverse events in Study AUS01T 
System Organ Class 
Most frequently occurring (at least ≥ 20% in a Cohort 1, Cohort 2 or combined Cohort 3 + Extension 
Cohort) AEs by system organ classes (SOCs) were during cut-off 30-Sept-2016: 
•  Gastrointestinal disorders: 20%, 6.5% and 14.5% in Cohort 1, Cohort 2 and in combined Cohort 3 
+ Extension Cohort, respectively 
• 
• 
Infections and infestations: 30.0%, 32.3% and 29.0% in Cohort 1, Cohort 2 and in combined Cohort 
3 + Extension Cohort, respectively 
Investigations: 20.0%, 25.8% and 37.1% in Cohort 1, Cohort 2 and in combined Cohort 3 + 
Extension Cohort, respectively 
In the combined Cohort 3 + Extension Cohort during cut-off 28-Feb-2018, changes in the frequencies of 
AEs were observed in some SOCs as compared to the original cut-off (such as an increased by 9.0% in 
infections) (Table 51). However, the AEs which were reported did not suggest a change in the safety 
profile.

Table 51. AEs by primary SOC- Safety set (cut-off 28-Feb-2018).
Preferred terms 
The AEs observed were consistent with the known safety profile of eltrombopag and/or h-ATG and CsA in 
the SAA setting. Serum sickness was reported during the first 13 days, and was considered as “unlikely” 
related to or "unrelated" to eltrombopag by the principal investigator. 
AEs were generally manageable and reversible with dose adjustment and/or dose interruption (cut-off 30-
Sept-2016). AEs with a frequency exceeding 5% in any cohort are presented in table 52. Overall, 87 
(71%) subjects had at least 1 AE. ALT/AST increased, febrile neutropenia and blood bilirubin increased 
were the most common AEs reported by preferred term. The higher incidence of AEs of transaminases 
increased in combined Cohort 3 + Extension Cohort relative to Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, must be 
interpreted with caution and might be attributed to the differences in how increased LFT were reported as 
AEs between the cohorts. All liver safety events such as ALT, AST, total bilirubin and ALP labs of any 
grade were source document verified and should be used primarily when assessing hepatotoxicity.

Table 52. AE irrespective of relationship to treatment occurring commonly (by 5% or more) by 
preferred term and highest grade (Study AUS01T) (cut-off 30-Sept-2016).  
The AEs reported in the combined Cohort 3 + Extension Cohort during cut-off 28-Feb-2018 were similar 
to what was observed at the original cut-off (with 5% or less difference), with the exception of upper 
respiratory tract infection (7.6% at update cut-off vs. 1.6% at original cut-off). Additionally, there was a 
small increase (< 5%) in hypertension (5.4% at the update cut-off vs. 1.6% at the original cut-off). The 
increase in upper respiratory tract infection was not considered as clinically relevant as none of these 
events required hospitalisation and, hypertension is a known effect of CsA. 
The rules for reporting grade 3 and 4 liver function test (LFT) laboratory abnormalities as AEs were 
inconsistently applied at the NIH throughout the study. For this reason queries were issued to the 
investigator for all grade 3 and 4 liver function abnormalities from the beginning of the study to see if 
they should have been reported as an AE and presented in comparison with what was reported at the 
original submission (Table 53). This led to an increase (≥10%) in Cohorts 1 and 2 in reported liver AEs. 
This increase of liver AEs in these cohorts is a consequence of the query process. In the combined Cohort 
3 + Extension Cohort, the incidences of hepatobiliary events at the update cut-off were similar to what 
was observed at original cut-off.

Table 53. Incidence of hepatobiliary events by preferred term-original AEs and revised AEs at 
original cut-off and events at update cut-off-Safety set. 
AEs occurring during the first 13 days and during the first 3 months 
Cohort 1 and 2 had a staggered start of eltrombopag on Day 14 while Cohort 3 and Extension Cohort 
began all 3 drugs concurrently. Therefore, the evaluation of toxicity was done by comparing the AE and 
laboratory parameters between Day 1 and Day 13 between these 2 groups (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 
(double therapy: h-ATG + CsA), relative to Cohort 3 and Extension Cohort (triple therapy h-ATG + CsA + 
eltrombopag)), for a comparison of the toxicity when eltrombopag is given concurrently with h-ATG/CsA 
vs. the staggered initiation. 
Furthermore, data collected during the first 3 months were analysed in order to consider whether the 
concurrent initiation of treatment would be lead to a different safety profile beyond the initial 13 days. 
This analysis was driven by the anticipation that the concurrent initiation of eltrombopag together with h-
ATG/CsA might lead to intolerable hepatotoxicity as each of the 3 drugs has a known potential for 
hepatotoxicity. The known differences in the reporting of grade 3 and 4 LFTs as AEs make them unreliable 
for assessment and therefore the lab parameters should be primarily used for assessment of 
hepatotoxicity. 
During both time points (first 13 days and the first 3 months) and after first cut-off period (30-Sept-
2016), the incidences of AEs were typically similar in the 2 groups (< 5% differences), with the exception 
of AST and ALT increased and serum sickness. All AEs of serum sickness (in all cohorts) began within 13 
days of start of treatment, were reported as unlikely or unrelated to eltrombopag and resolved within one 
week. Of note, neither the AEs, AST and ALT increased nor the AEs serum sickness led to study 
discontinuation. There is no pharmacological rationale how eltrombopag can induce serum sickness and 
this event has not been seen as a safety issue in earlier studies with eltrombopag (there was no AE of 
serum sickness reported in Study AUS28T refractory SAA subjects who received eltrombopag alone). 
When comparing the number of increased liver laboratory parameters (AST/ALT/ and TBIL) in the first 13 
days after the first cut-off period (30-Sept-2016), they were consistent between the two groups with 
AST/ALT > 3xULN and TBIL > 2ULN for Day 1-13 in Cohort 1 and 2 observed in 9 subjects (14.8%) and 
in Cohort 3 + Extension observed in 3 subjects (4.8%). Furthermore, when looking at the liver function 
laboratory test up to 3 months, there were a limited number of subjects who had an increase of the liver 
function tests after Day 13 with AST/ALT > 3xULN and TBIL > 2ULN in Cohort 1 and 2 observed in 14 
subjects (23.0%) and in Cohort 3 + Extension observed in 7 subjects (11.3%) (Table 54 and 55).

As observed at the original cut-off, during the first 13 days after cut-off 28-Feb-2018, the incidences of 
adverse events were usually similar in the two groups (<5% differences), with the exception of AEs 
elevated AST/ALT and serum sickness. Both were manageable and none led to discontinuation. 
Considering the updated data after cut-off period 28-Feb-2018, the incidences of AEs of elevated 
ALT/AST, including AEs that required dose interruption/adjustment, were higher in the combined Cohort 3 
+ Extension Cohort than in combined Cohorts 1 + 2 (table 56, 57 and 58).

No subjects discontinued due these events when all 3 drugs were administered concurrently as in Cohort 
3 + Extension or when eltrombopag was staggered as in Cohorts 1 and 2. Note that the rules for 
reporting ALT/AST grade 3 and 4 LFTs laboratory abnormalities reported as AEs differed between cohorts, 
however LFTs laboratory data of grade 3 and 4 ALT and AST collected during this period were similar (< 
5% differences) between the 2 groups, or lower in the group Cohort 3 + Extension Cohort when 
compared to the group Cohorts 1 + 2. 
Overall, the analysis of liver related AEs in conjunction with the LFTs laboratory abnormalities captured 
during the first 13 days of study treatment showed that the concomitant dosing of eltrombopag with IST 
(h-ATG + CsA) did not lead to an increase in hepatic toxicity when compared with dosing with IST alone. 
The analysis of AEs, SAEs and AEs that required dose interruption/adjustment during the first 3 months 
and after the cut-off 28-Feb-2018 are presented in table 59, 60 and 61. 
As seen during the first 13 days of study therapy, the analysis at 3 months showed higher incidences of 
AEs of elevated ALT/AST, including AEs that required dose interruption/adjustment, in Cohort 3 + 
Extension Cohort relative to Cohorts 1+2. No subjects discontinued due to these events (in any cohorts). 
No subjects discontinued due to these events when all 3 drugs were administered concurrently as in 
Cohort 3 + Extension or when eltrombopag was staggered as in Cohorts 1 and 2. Note that the rules for 
reporting ALT/AST grade 3 and 4 LFTs laboratory abnormalities reported as AEs differed between cohorts, 
however LFTs laboratory data of grade 3 and 4 ALT and AST collected during this period were similar (<

compared to the group Cohorts 1 + 2.

Adverse events suspected to be drug related by the Investigator 
All AEs reported as “unlikely”, “possible” and “probably” related or with missing relationship to study drug 
are considered suspected to be study drug related. The 5 “suspected” cases of serum sickness were all 
reported as “unlikely” related to eltrombopag (including the case reported in Cohort 2 which occurred 
before the start of eltrombopag).

The AEs of increased ALT and AST in combined Cohort 3 + Extension Cohort did not result in 
discontinuation. When looking at the LFT laboratory abnormalities, there was no increase in grade 3 and 4 
ALT/AST in combined Cohort 3 + Extension Cohort relative to other cohorts. Although AEs of lung 
infection and bacteraemia are reported as suspected to be related to study drug, they are likely related to 
the underlying disease.

Analysis of adverse events by severity 
The majority (>50%) of AEs were ≥grade 3 across all cohorts: 53.3% in Cohort 1, 58.1% in Cohort 2, 
67.7% in Cohort 3 and 62.9% in combined Cohort 3 + Extension Cohort. Persistent high grades AEs for 
increased ALT and AST occurred with an incidence of ALT and AST increased in 35.5% and 22.6% of the 
subjects in Cohort 3, and in 27.4% and 19.4% of the subjects in combined Cohort 3 + Extension Cohort. 
Common adverse events in Study E1202 
Preferred terms 
The most common (in ≥3 subjects) AEs on treatment were nausea (6 subjects, 60.0%), headache (5 
subjects, 50.0%), constipation, edema, pyrexia, renal impairment and vomiting (4 subjects each, 
40.0%), ALT increased, blood bilirubin increased, hyperglycemia, hypertension, myalgia, and stomatitis 
(3 subjects each; 30.0%).  
Adverse events suspected to be drug related by the Investigator 
Of the 10 subjects treated with eltrombopag, 5 (50.0%) had 17 AEs related to eltrombopag (regardless of 
their relationship with r-ATG or CsA). Of the 17 AEs, 15 related to eltrombopag were reported by the 
Week 26 assessment, and an additional 2 AEs (impetigo and nausea) by the Week 52 assessment. The 
most common AEs related to eltrombopag (≥2 subjects) were myalgia (3 subjects), blood bilirubin 
increased and nausea (2 subjects each). 
Analysis of adverse events by severity 
The majority of AEs (80%; in 8 subjects) reported on treatment were grade 3 or grade 4. All grade 3 or 4 
AEs occurred in single subject. Grade 3 AEs were reported in 8 subjects (80%) and grade 4 AEs were 
reported in 2 subjects (20%). No fatal AEs were reported. 
Common adverse events in Study E1201 
Preferred terms 
The most common AEs (≥ 3 subjects) on treatment were nasopharyngitis (8 subjects, 38.1%), hepatic 
function abnormal and urticaria (3 subjects each, 14.3%). 
Adverse events suspected to be drug related by the Investigator 
Of the 21 subjects treated with eltrombopag, 12 (57.1%) had at least one drug related AE on treatment. 
The majority of AEs considered related to eltrombopag were hepatobiliary disorders (hepatic function 
abnormal, hyperbilirubinemia, and blood alkaline phosphatase increased in 2 subjects each; ALT 
increased and blood bilirubin increased in one subject each) and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
(rash in 2 subjects, purpura and urticaria in one subject each).

had grade 3 AEs and one subject had a grade 4 AE (4.8%) on treatment. No subject had a fatal AE. 
Deaths  
Deaths in study AUS01T 
Up to the update cut-off, 7 deaths have been reported and none was considered related to study 
treatment by the investigator. All subjects died during the follow-up except Subject-23 who died while 
on-treatment. 
Three subjects died as of the data cut-off date (30-Sept-2016), all in Cohort 1: 
•  Subject 23, aged 55 years, died on Day 85 while on-treatment with eltrombopag and CsA, from 
paraneoplastic encephalopathy that was attributed to thymoma that predated study entry. 
•  Subject 15, aged 37 years, died during the follow-up due to hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (HSCT)-related cause, approximately 1 year after the end of therapy. 
•  Subject 9, aged 66 years, died during the follow-up due to HSCT-related cause, approximately 2 
years after the end of therapy. 
None of the deaths were reported by the Investigator as related to the study treatment. 
At the update cut-off (28-Feb-2018), 4 additional subjects had died: 
•  Subject 42 in Cohort 2 aged 29 years died on Day 971, during the follow-up 881 days after last 
dose of eltrombopag, due to infection (study site communication: septic shock). 
•  Subject 80 in Cohort 3 aged 72 years died on Day 864, during the follow-up 676 days after last 
dose of eltrombopag, of unknown cause. 
•  Subject 111 in Extension Cohort aged 65 years died on Day 419, during the follow-up 225 days 
after last dose of eltrombopag, due to infection (study site communication: septic shock). 
•  Subject 113 in Extension Cohort aged 65 years died on Day 121, during the follow-up 109 days 
after last dose of eltrombopag, due to infection (study site communication: pneumonia). 
Deaths in studies E2102 and E2101 
No subjects died during the studies. 
Other serious adverse events  
Study AUS01T 
After original cut-off (30-Sept-2016) all SAEs are considered known effects of eltrombopag, of one of the 
medications used in IST or due to underlying disease. No trends were observed in the type of SAEs 
reported. The only SAEs observed in more than 2 subjects per cohorts were febrile neutropenia and 
serum sickness; five of the serum sickness SAEs were reported as unlikely to be related to eltrombopag, 
and 3 were reported as unrelated to eltrombopag. 
In combined Cohort 3 + Extension Cohort, 26 (41%) had at least 1 SAE. The SAEs observed in more than 
2 subjects were serum sickness (6 subjects, 9.7%), febrile neutropenia (5 subjects, 8.1%) and rash (3 
subjects, 4.8%). 
In the combined Cohort 3 + Extension Cohort (cut-off 28-Feb-2018), the SAEs reported were similar to 
what was observed at the original cut-off (Table 63).

Study E1202 
Two subjects (20.0%) experienced at least 1 SAE. SAEs of febrile neutropenia (grade 3) and 
nephrolithiasis (grade 3) were reported in 1 subject each and were considered to be unrelated to study 
treatment. 
Study E1201 
Four subjects (19.0%) experienced at least 1 SAE. The SAEs reported were retinal detachment, 
enterocolitis, pain, decreased appetite (1 subject each) and were considered to be unrelated to study 
treatment 
Adverse events leading to discontinuation 
Study AUS01T 
After original cut-off period (30-Sept-2016) AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were few, and were 
considered known effects of eltrombopag, or one of the drugs used in the IST (h-ATG and/or CsA) or due 
to the underlying disease. Overall, 6 subjects (4.9%) had an AE leading to treatment discontinuation: 1 
AE of encephalopathy (leading to the subject death; Cohort 1), 4 AEs of rash, and 1 AE of colitis (Cohort 
3 + Extension cohort). 
All 4 events of rash were reported as SAEs; 3 grade 3 and 1 grade 2 event which was associated with 
fever and oral pain, resulting in hospitalization and discontinuation of eltrombopag. Of the 4 events, 1 
occurred in Cohort 2 (Subject 54), 1 occurred in Cohort 3 (Subject 86) and 2 occurred in the Extension 
Cohort (Subjects 94 and 107). Subjects 86 and 107 were paediatric (6 and 16 years old, respectively). 
Overall, few subjects discontinued treatment due to an AE, and at the update cut-off (28-Feb-2018) no 
additional subject discontinued treatment due to an AE (Table 64).

Study E1202 
One subject discontinued treatment due to ECG QT prolonged (grade 2) which was considered not related 
to study treatment by the Investigator. 
Study E1201 
One subject discontinued treatment with study medication due to an abnormal hepatic function (ALT >5 
× ULN and AST >3 × ULN). This was considered by the Investigator to be related to eltrombopag. 
Adverse events leading to dose interruption or adjustment 
Study AUS01T 
Most AEs requiring eltrombopag dose adjustment/interruption were transaminases increased. This is 
considered a known effect of eltrombopag. After original cut-off period (30-Sept-2016) overall, 17 
subjects (13.8%) had AEs requiring dose adjustment or interruption. Most events were ALT / AST 
increased: 12 (9.8%)/9 (7.3%) subjects, respectively. All other AEs requiring dose 
interruptions/adjustments were observed in 1 subject only. 
Almost all ALT / AST increases requiring dose interruptions/adjustments were observed in the combined 
Cohort 3 + Extension Cohort: 11 (17.7%) / 9 (14.5%) subjects, respectively. Only 1 AE ALT increased 
requiring dose adjustment or interruption was observed in Cohort 1, and none in Cohort 2. 
At the update cut-off (28-Feb-2018) the incidences of AEs requiring dose interruptions/adjustments were 
similar to what was observed at the original cut-off (Table 65).

Three subjects (30.0%) had AEs that led to dose reduction or interruption of eltrombopag. The AEs were: 
nausea (2 subjects), ALT increased, blood bilirubin increased, dyspepsia, GGT increased, vomiting (1 
subject each). 
Study E1201 
Assessment report

No subject had dose reduction due to an AE. Five subjects (23.8%) had dose interruptions due to an AE. 
The AEs were chronic gastritis, dyspepsia, hepatic function abnormal, hyperbilirubinemia, rash (1 subject 
each). 
Adverse events of special interest 
Study AUS01T 
AESIs occurring during the 6 months of study treatment or within 30 days of eltrombopag discontinuation 
were reported, except for the malignancies which were reported for the duration of the study. 
New cytogenetic abnormalities were evaluated by peripheral blood and bone marrow evaluations. They 
were not considered as AEs per protocol or per evaluation by the Principal Investigator, as they are 
known events of the natural evolution of SAA and they occur with IST. However, it is included as an AESI 
in order to assess long term safety. 
•  Bleeding events: Bleeding is considered an expected event due to the underling disease and could 
occur at any time the platelet counts are low. Treatment emergent AESIs of bleeding did not 
cluster to a specific type of bleeding. After original cut-off period (30-Sept-2016) in Cohort 1, 2 
subjects had several types of haemorrhage (one subject had ileal haemorrhage, hematoma and 
lower gastrointestinal haemorrhage, and one subject had epistaxis and conjunctival 
hemorrhageIn Cohort 2, Cohort 3 and Cohort 3 + Extension, these events were observed in 1 
subject in each cohort (ovarian haemorrhage, mouth haemorrhage and menorrhagia, 
respectively). None of the bleeding events led to therapy discontinuation, or led to dose 
interruption/adjustment. After updated cut-off (28-Feb-2018) the incidences were similar to the 
original cut-off. 
•  Hepatobiliary events: The trial was designed by sequential cohort with each cohort informing the 
design of the subsequent cohort (duration of eltrombopag, addition of maintenance CsA, and 
concurrent administration of all 3 drugs). After original cut-off period (30-Sept-2016) increased 
aminotransferases (ALT and AST) and increased blood bilirubin were reported in 27.4%, 19.4%, 
and 14.5% of subjects, respectively, in the combined Cohort 3 + Extension Cohort. Most 
aminotransferases increased and one event each of increased blood bilirubin and liver injury 
required dose interruption/adjustment. None of the hepatobiliary events led to therapy 
discontinuation.  
The protocol specified grade 3 and 4 LFTs labs under certain circumstances to be captured as AEs. 
However, on retrospective review of the study data, the rules to translate LFT labs to AEs appeared 
inconsistently applied. Considering the above information, the laboratory results should be the primary 
evidence of hepatotoxicity, as all LFT lab values were source document verified.  
There were more liver AEs reported in Cohort 3 and Extension Cohort relative to Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, 
which can be attributed to differences in the reporting concept. When considering liver related laboratory 
parameters, i.e. AST and ALT, there was no meaningful difference between the cohorts. 
Since the original cut-off, queries were issued to the Investigator for all grade 3 and 4 liver function 
laboratory abnormalities from the beginning of the study to see if they should have been reported as an 
AE. This led to an increase (≥ 10%) in Cohorts 1 and 2 in reported liver AEs (table 43). This increase of 
liver AEs in these cohorts is a consequence of the query process. Independently from the reporting of 
hepatobiliary AEs by the Investigator, it is to be noted that the analyses displayed in clinical laboratory 
evaluation section (below) on the basis of actual LFTs laboratory measures and objective criteria, should 
remain the primary evidence for assessment of hepatotoxicity. All ALT, AST, TBIL and ALP abnormalities 
of any grade are presented in in the mentioned section. In the combined Cohort 3 + Extension Cohort, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620491/2019 
Page 104/162 
 
  
  
 
the incidences of hepatobiliary events at the update cut-off were similar to what was observed at original 
cut-off. 
• 
Thromboembolic events: AESI of thromboembolic events were rare in all cohorts (original cut-off 
30_sept-2016) (2 subjects in Cohort 2, who had transient blindness and myocardial infarction, 1 
subject in Cohort 3 and 2 subjects in combined Cohort 3 + Extension Cohort all of whom had 
embolisms: one was a catheter-related thrombosis in the basilica vein and the other was a non-
occlusive clot in the subclavian vein). None led to therapy discontinuation or to dose 
interruption/adjustment. No new events were recorded at the update cutoff (28-Feb-2018). 
•  Renal events: After the original cut-off AESI of renal events (AE of acute kidney injury) was 
observed in one subject in Cohort 2 and in one subject in Extension Cohort. These events did not 
lead to therapy discontinuation or to dose interruption/adjustment.  
•  No AEs of haematological malignancies, bone marrow fibrosis, or recurrence of thrombocytopenia 
after discontinuation of eltrombopag were reported. 
Study E1202 
One subject had thromboembolic AE of blood creatinine phosphokinase increased. Seven subjects had 
hepatobiliary AEs (ALT increased, blood bilirubin increased, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, GGT 
increased, hepatic function abnormal, and liver injury; grade 1/2). Two subjects had hepatobiliary 
laboratory abnormalities. Five subjects had renal AEs (renal impairment, dysuria, renal disorder); grade 1 
or 2. Three subjects had bleeding AEs (haematuria, haemorrhoidal haemorrhage, petechiae, and 
subcutaneous hematoma). None of these events were considered related to eltrombopag. 
One subject was detected with a cytogenetic abnormality that was not associated with dysplasia or an 
increase in bone marrow blasts; no progression to MDS was reported. This event was not reported as an 
AE by the Investigator. No AEs of malignancies or post-therapy thrombocytopenia was reported. Of the 
10 subjects treated with eltrombopag, 9 subjects had evaluable samples of the bone marrow biopsy at 
screening. The worsening in grade of reticulin through Week 52 was observed in 2 subjects for European 
Consensus Scale, and in 3 subjects for Bauermeister scale. These changes were not reported as AEs. 
Study E1201 
AESIs (hepatobiliary, renal-related, bleeding, and cytogenetic abnormalities) were infrequent. One 
subject with elevated baseline aminotransferases (ALT: 81 IU/L, AST: 75 IU/L) experienced hepatic 
function abnormal (grade 3) and eltrombopag was discontinued; the subject had ALT levels ≥5 × ULN at 
the time of treatment withdrawal. The event of hepatic function abnormal was suspected to be treatment-
related. Three subjects (all with normal karyotype at baseline) had a new cytogenetic abnormality 
detected after treatment, none of which was a hematologic malignancy. Of these, no subject had 
cytogenetic abnormalities affecting the structure or number of chromosome 7 by FISH. No AEs related to 
thromboembolic events, post-therapy thrombocytopenia or malignancies were reported. Eighteen of the 
enrolled subjects had evaluable samples of the bone marrow biopsy at screening. The worsening in grade 
of reticulin through Week 52 was observed in 2 subjects for European Consensus Scale, and in 1 subject 
for Bauermeister scale. These changes were not reported as AEs. 
Adverse drug reaction in the target indication  
Adverse events as reported in Study AUS01T were selected as candidates for further evaluation for their 
relationship with treatment with eltrombopag for the purpose of the labelling document. 
The strategy for ADR selection: 
-  AEs occurring in at least 2 subjects in the combined Cohort 3 + Extension cohort (corresponding 
to a frequency of at least 3.2%); AEs were assessed at the level of preferred terms; 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620491/2019 
Page 105/162 
 
  
  
 
-  AEs from Cohorts 1, 2, 3 and Extension cohort, which were on the Novartis list of designated 
medical events; 
-  AEs from Cohorts 1, 2, 3 and Extension cohort that were included in the Risk Management Plan as 
an important identified or potential risks but were not included as AEs in the product information. 
AEs identified in the candidate selection were considered ‘ADRs’ when there was enough evidence of a 
causal relationship between the drug and the event. The AEs which have been defined as ‘candidate 
ADRs’ were evaluated based on Bradford-Hill criteria. ADRs as defined may differ from the Investigator 
determined related adverse events. 
Special focus was given whether an AE has been associated with either h-ATG or CsA by reviewing the 
respective label-documents (US PI for h-ATG or NVS-CDS for CsA): 
An event which has been listed for either h-ATG or CsA was not considered related to eltrombopag 
unless: 
- 
- 
There is a clear pharmacological rationale to expect a relationship to eltrombopag or 
It is a known ADR for eltrombopag in other indications. 
Furthermore, events which are clearly associated with the underlying disease were not considered as 
ADRs. 
Upon review of safety data as of 28-Feb-2018, using the same ADR selection criteria as described in the 
original submission, an additional ADR of ‘skin discolouration’ was recognized. 
Of note, as Cohort 3+Extension reflects the chosen dosage regimen (h-ATG+CSA+Eltrombopag 
concurrently from Day 1) for this indication, this cohort was utilized in the selection of ADRs in patients 
with definitive immunosuppressive therapy-naïve SAA. 
Novartis proposes to include a separate ADR section using MedDRA version 21.0 for the definitive 
immunosuppressive therapy-naïve SAA patient population to provide clarity on the ADRs that were 
experienced in this patient population. The following ADR table was utilised to populate these ADRs:

Laboratory findings 
Hematology in Study AUS01T 
As anticipated in a population of subjects with SAA, there were high incidences of high CTC grade (≥grade 
3) haemoglobin, neutrophil and platelets abnormalities. After the original cut-off period (30-Sept-2016) 
there was no major differences between the cohorts, (Table 68). Subjects had transfusions at baseline, 
which could improve their haematology evaluation at that time. Most haematology abnormalities were 
already observed during the first 13 days. 
After the cut-off 28-Feb-2018 the incidences of worsening from baseline of haematology abnormalities, 
were similar to what was observed at the original cut-off, and most of these worsening haematology 
abnormalities were already observed during the 13 first days. 
Table 68. Haematology abnormalities grade worsening from baseline.  
Haematology in Study E1202 
Hematology assessments during the study included haemoglobin, lymphocytes, neutrophils and white 
blood cell count. Although most subjects had shifts in grades with regard to haematology parameters, the 
observed grade changes were consistent with those expected in subject with the underlying disease. 
Haematology in Study E1202 
Hematology assessments during the study included haemoglobin, lymphocytes, neutrophils and white 
blood cell count. The grade changes seen were common observations due to underlying disease. 
Clinical chemistry in AUS01T 
All 3 drugs are labelled for liver function abnormalities, and eltrombopag and CsA are labelled for 
hyperbilirubinemia. In subjects with SAA receiving CsA and h-ATG and eltrombopag, increased 
aminotransferase (AST/ALT) liver enzymes and increased bilirubin are anticipated. 
After the original cut-off (30-Sept-2018) there were no meaningful differences between the cohorts in 
liver related laboratory parameters, i.e. AST and ALT (Table 69). The elevations of the LFTs were typically 
transient and most subjects had recovered completely at data cut-off. Some subjects had elevations in 
transaminases (ALT/AST) that were sequential and not concurrently to the increases in bilirubin and no 
subjects discontinued due to transaminase elevation.

Table 69. Liver function test abnormalities based on CTC grade worsening from baseline 
(Study AUS01T) (cut-off 30-Sept-2016).  
In total, 40 cases met the biochemical criteria of ALT or AST >3xULN and TBIL >2xULN and (ALP <2xULN 
or missing), where the 3 minimum laboratory parameters met the defined thresholds (xULN) within a 30 
day period (Table 70).  
Table 70. Elevations of liver chemistry tests (Study AUS01T) (cut-off 30-Sept-2016).  
Of these 40 cases, 26 met the biochemical criteria for DILI/ Hy’s law prior to eltrombopag initiation, but 
its contribution to subsequent elevations is unclear. The remaining 14 cases met the criteria after 
Assessment report

initiation of eltrombopag. None of these cases were confirmed as DILI related to eltrombopag. The LFT 
elevations were typically transient and most subjects recovered completely. Some subjects had elevations 
in aminotransferase (ALT/AST) that were sequential and not concomitant to the increases in bilirubin. 
Other subjects had confounding factors in their medical history, and some were also receiving 
concomitant drugs known to induce transient LFT increases.  
The majority of elevated LFTs first occurred during the first 13 days in a similar way across all cohorts, 
and therefore the addition of eltrombopag did not change the hepatic safety profile. None of the subjects 
discontinued eltrombopag due to LFT elevations. 
Similar to the original cut-off, the incidences of biochemistry abnormalities, new or worsening from 
baseline, were mostly ≤grade 3 and the grade 4 increases aminotransferase (AST/ALT) liver enzyme and 
increased bilirubin were reported in ≤5% of the subjects in combined Cohort 3 + Extension Cohort (Table 
71). The incidences of elevation of liver chemistry tests were also similar to what was observed at the 
original cut-off (Table 72), as well as elevation of liver chemistry tests observed in the paediatric 
population (Table 73), or during the first 13 days and first 3 months (table 74 and table 75), respectively.

Table 75. Elevations of liver chemistry tests collected during the first 3 months in Cohort 1+2

In review of elevation of liver chemistry tests, 29 subjects in the combined Cohort 3 + Extension Cohort 
met the criteria of ALT or AST > 3xULN and TBIL > 2xULN and (ALP < 2xULN or missing), where the 3 
minimum laboratory parameters met the defined thresholds (ULN) within a 30 day period of each other. 
Similarly to what was reported at the original cut-off, the elevations of the LFTs were usually transient 
and mostly the subjects recovered completely. Some subjects had confounding factors in their medical 
history and some subjects were also receiving concomitant drugs known to induce transient increases of 
the LFTs. None of the subjects discontinued eltrombopag due to LFT elevations. 
Clinical chemistry in E1202 
In Study E1202, the majority of the worst post-baseline grade in the clinical chemistry parameters was 
grade 1 or grade 2 through Week 52 except for one subject whose sodium levels shifted from grade 0 
(baseline) to grade 3 post-baseline. No clinical chemistry laboratory parameters changed to severity 
grade 4. 
Clinical chemistry in E1201 
In Study E1201, the majority of grade changes were to grade 1 except one subject for whom elevated 
AST values shifted from grade 1 (at baseline) to grade 2 worst post-baseline and another subject for 
whom elevated ALT values shifted from grade 1 (at baseline) to grade 3 worst post baseline. No clinical 
chemistry laboratory parameters changed to severity grade 4. 
Vital signs, physical findings and other observations related to safety 
No clinically relevant changes were seen in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, 
weight and temperature in Study AUS01T. Neither were seen in Studies E1202 and E1201.  
Electrocardiogram 
None of the ECG findings were considered as clinically relevant, except for 1 ECG finding (Cohort 2) that 
was associated with an SAE of grade 4 myocardial infarction, with an onset prior to treatment with 
eltrombopag.  
ECG at Month 3 was mandated starting from Subject AUS01T-051 (Cohort 1). No clinically meaningful 
differences on ECG shift from baseline were recorded. 
In Study E1202, one subject had clinically significant change from baseline in QTcF (> 60 msec) which 
was reported as an AE (electrocardiogram QT prolonged) which led to discontinuation of eltrombopag. 
Assessment report

The outcome of the electrocardiogram QT prolonged was reported as recovered/resolved and the event 
was considered unrelated to study treatment. 
In Study 1201, no clinically significant findings were noted in ECG results. 
Historical controls 
Safety analysis from Scheinberg et al (2009) and Scheinberg et al (2011) is reported as presented in the 
publication and no further information about these studies are available. A direct comparison cannot be 
conducted; however, the regimen reported in these  two publications appears similar to the IST used in 
US01T up to the landmark visit of 6 months, and the information is presented as a guide to the events as 
they occur with IST alone. Limited safety data from other published literature, Tisdale et al (2000) and 
Rosenfeld et al (2003), are also presented in this section. 
Scheinberg et al (2011) 
The most frequently observed SAEs were infections (neutropenic fever, negative culture was reported in 
23 subjects in the h–ATG group and in 16 subjects in the r-ATG group). 2 subjects in the h-ATG group 
and 9 in the r-ATG group could not be evaluated at 6 months because of death and progressive disease, 
respectively. 
Clonal evolution was defined as a new clonal cytogenetic abnormality or characteristic dysplastic or 
leukemic changes in the bone marrow. The cumulative incidence of clonal evolution at 3 years (in all 
subjects, those with and those without a response) was 21% (95% CI, 7 to 33) in the h-ATG group and 
14% (95% CI, 1 to 25) in the r-ATG group (p=0.69). Among subjects treated with h-ATG, one each had 
deletion 3, deletion 5q, deletion 13q, deletion 20q, and leukemia, and 4 had monosomy 7. In 2 subjects, 
monosomy 7 was preceded by t(12;13) and deletion 13q. In the r-ATG group, 5 subjects had monosomy 
7, and one had deletion 13q. 
Scheinberg et al (2009) 
The most frequently observed SAEs were infections (infections of the ears, nose and throat) reported in 9 
subjects in the h-ATG + CsA group and 7 subjects in the h-ATG + CsA + sirolimus group. 
7 subjects showed evidence of clonal evolution; 3 subjects in the h-ATG + CsA + sirolimus group (one 
loss of chromosome 18, one deletion 13q, and one t (6,14) and 4 subjects in the h-ATG + CsA group (3 
with monosomy 7 and one with complex cytogenetics). 
Tisdale et al (2000) 
The trial was terminated prematurely after 3 early deaths in the cyclophosphamide group. Analyses were 
by intention to treat. The median follow-up was 21.9 months (range 1–33). 
There was excess morbidity in the cyclophosphamide group (invasive fungal infections, 4 vs. none; 
p=0.043) as well as excess early mortality (3 deaths within the first 3 months vs. none; p=0.101). There 
was no significant difference at 6 months after treatment in the overall response rates among evaluable 
subjects (6 of 13 [46%] on cyclophosphamide vs. 9 of 12 [75%] on ATG). Subjects who received 
cyclophosphamide sustained greater duration of profound neutropenia than those receiving ATG. 
A chromosomal abnormality classically attributed to MDS has been detected in one complete responder in 
the ATG group (trisomy 8); however, detection of this abnormality 3 months after treatment raises the 
possibility that it was present but not detectable due to poor in-vitro marrow-cell growth at presentation. 
A longer period of observation would be necessary to assess late clonal complications. 
Rosenfeld et al (2003) 
Assessment report

16 subjects (13%) died before their 3-month evaluation (mostly due to fungal infection). Despite 
persistent thrombocytopenia, few subjects died of haemorrhage. 6 subjects died due to complications 
following bone marrow transplant. 
13 (10.6%) subjects evolved to a new cytogenetic abnormality, involving predominantly chromosome 7 
(monosomy in 9 subjects and deletion 7p in 1 subject) and chromosome 8 (trisomy in 2 subjects). 
Monosomy 7 usually occurred with either a minimal initial clinical response or clinical relapse to severe 
pancytopenia. Seven subjects with this finding died, 4 of refractory pancytopenia and 3 after evolution to 
acute myelogenous leukaemia. In contrast, trisomy 8 was associated with a good long-term prognosis. 
Safety in special populations 
After the original cut-off (30-Sept-2016) in Study AUS01T, there were no meaningful differences in the 
incidence of AEs by subgroup analyses by age category, gender, or race. 
• 
Elderly subjects 
In the safety assessment of the elderly subgroup (≥65 years), there were 5 subjects in Cohort 1, 2 
subjects in Cohort 2 and 10 subjects in combined Cohort 3 + Extension Cohort, and AEs were reported in 
3 (60.0%) subjects, 2 (100%) subjects, and 8 (80.0%) subjects, respectively. 
The AEs that were observed in at least 2 elderly subjects overall, irrespective of causal relationship, were 
ALT/AST increased in 4 subjects each, blood bilirubin increased in 3 subjects and acute kidney injury in 2 
subjects. Of the 2 events of kidney injury one was reported as unlikely related to eltrombopag in a 
subject with diabetes and recovered, and the other was reported as unrelated to eltrombopag in a subject 
with diarrhoea and dehydration which was ongoing at the data cut-off date. 
1 AE of colitis in a 65 years subject occurred concomitantly with sepsis, haemorrhagic typhlitis and a 
cecal infection; the event typhlitis was reported as unrelated to eltrombopag. None of the AEs had a fatal 
outcome. The AEs observed were consistent with those observed in non-elderly subjects with the 
exception of the 2 cases of renal injury and typhlitis. 
During the updated cut-off (28-Feb-2018), in the safety assessment of the elderly subgroup (≥ 65 years), 
there were 15 subjects in the combined Extension Cohort, that is an additional 5 subjects from the 
original cut-off. The AEs that were observed in at least 2 elderly subjects in the combined Cohort 3 + 
Extension Cohort, irrespective of causal relationship, were ALT increased (6 subjects, 40.0%), AST and 
blood bilirubin increased (4 subjects, 26.7% each), lung infection (3 subjects, 20.0%), and hypertension 
(2 subjects, 13.3%). The AEs in elderly observed in the combined Extension Cohort were consistent with 
those observed in non-elderly subjects. 
• 
Paediatric subjects 
In the safety assessment of the paediatric subgroups after the original cut-off (30-Sept-2016), there were 
29 subjects aged 2-17 years: 2 subjects 2-5 years; 8 subjects 6-11 years; 19 subjects 12-17 years with 
AEs reported in 1, 6 and 13 subjects, respectively. The AEs that were observed in 2 or more than 2 
paediatric subjects (Table 76) overall irrespective of causal relationship were febrile neutropenia in 8 
subjects, ALT/AST increased in 4 and 2 subjects, respectively; blood bilirubin increased, serum sickness, 
and lung infection in 3 subjects each; and device related infection, infusion related reaction, sinusitis, and 
maculopapular rash in 2 subjects each. The 2 events of maculopapular rash led to discontinuation of 
treatment in one subject aged 6 years and another subject aged 16 years. No other AE led to treatment 
discontinuation and none of the AEs had a fatal outcome. The AEs observed were consistent with those 
observed in the overall study population included in the same study.

Table 76. AEs by paediatric subgroups observed in at least 2 paediatric subjects overall – 
Safety set 
AEs suspected to be drug related were observed in 1, 4, and 8 subjects in the 2-5 years, 6-11 years and 
12-17 years paediatric subgroups, respectively . Febrile neutropenia was the most frequent SAE, reported 
in 1 subject in each of the 2-5 years and 12-17 years paediatric subgroups and in 4 subjects in the 6-11 
years subgroup . 
No AESIs were reported in the 2-5 years paediatric subgroups. The few AESIs in the 6-11 years and 12-
17 years paediatric subgroups are mentioned below:  
-  Bleeding events were observed in the 12-17 years paediatric subgroup, in 1 subject each in 
Cohort 1 and combined Cohort 3 + Extension Cohort. 
-  Hepatobiliary events were observed in the 6-11 years paediatric subgroup in 1 subject in the 
combined Cohort 3 + Extension Cohort and in the 12-17 years subgroup in 1 subject in Cohort 1 
and 4 subjects in the combined Cohort 3 + Extension Cohort. The hepatobiliary events were 
aminotransferase increased and blood bilirubin increased. 
- 
The analysis of chemistry laboratory abnormalities in paediatric subjects across all cohorts and all 
ages showed that out of the 29 paediatric subjects, no grade 4 were reported, and the incidence 
of grade 3 were ALT: 20.7% (6 subjects), AST 6.9% (2 subjects), bilirubin 13.8% (4 subjects), 
hyperglycemia: 3.4% (1 subject); there was no grade 3 of hypoglycemia, creatinine or ALP. No 
subjects discontinued due to increased ALT or AST. 
-  No incidence of thromboembolic events, renal events, malignancies, bone marrow fibrosis, and 
recurrences of thrombocytopenia was observed in the paediatric subgroup. 
Of the 9 subjects with cytogenetic abnormalities, 3 were reported in paediatric subjects, including one 
(Subject 78: 16 years) who had the loss of chromosome 7, the other 2 abnormalities were of unclear 
significance. 
At the update cut-off, 8 additional paediatric subjects had been enrolled (all in the Extension Cohort). 
There were no notable differences in AEs recorded in the combined Cohort 3 + Extension Cohort when 
compared to the analysis at the original cut-off (Table 77).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620491/2019 
Page 114/162 
 
  
  
 
 
Overall in the study, all cohorts combined, the AEs recorded in paediatric subjects were consistent with 
those recorded in adult subjects, with the exception of a higher incidence of febrile neutropenia in 
paediatric (13 over 37 subjects 35.1%) vs. adult (10 over 116 subjects, 8.6%), and a higher incidence of 
upper respiratory tract infection in paediatric (4 over 37 subjects, 10.8%) vs. adult (5 over 116 subjects, 
4.3%). None resulted in discontinuation.

The SAEs recorded in the combined Cohort 3 + Extension Cohort were similar to what was recorded at 
the original cut-off, with differences that were not considered as clinically meaningful (Table 78).

Cytogenetic abnormality, including clonal evolution 
The protocol does not define cytogenetic abnormality as an AE, and they were not considered as AEs by 
the Investigator due to their relationship with the underlying disease and IST. However, all cases of 
cytogenetic clonal evolution are recorded in the clinical database regardless of the date of occurrence and 
SAE status. 
In study AUS01T, after the original cut-off (30-Sept-2016) with a median follow up of 22.19 months 
(range: 0.1 to 51.0 months), clonal cytogenetic evolution occurred in 9 of 123 (7%) subjects (including 3 
paediatric subjects) which is within the range (14% to 20%) that would be expected with IST alone in 
subjects with SAA at 2 years after the initiation of treatment (Townsley et al (2017), Maciejewski et al 
(2002), Scheinberg et al (2012), Scheinberg et al (2011): 
•  3 subjects (Subject 6: 17 years, Subject 7: 39 years, and Subject 50: 7 years), chromosomal 
aberrations were of unclear significance.  
• 
Five subjects (Subject 9: 64 years, Subject 18: 69 years, Subject 40: 48 years, Subject 65: 60 
years, and Subject 78: 16 years) had a loss of chromosome 7, either alone or in combination with 
complex cytogenetic abnormalities, and in 3 of the 5 subjects this was accompanied by 
morphologic evidence of dysplasia or full myeloid malignant transformation; and 4 of the 5 
occurred within 6.1 months.  
•  One subject (Subject 14: 68 years), the chromosomal abnormality was deletion of chromosome 
13, considered a good prognostic factor in aplastic anaemia.  
It is unclear if these evolutions occurred due to the underlying disease, the IST and/or eltrombopag, 
however, it does not appear that eltrombopag is associated with higher frequency of clonal evolution.  
At update cut-off, 6 additional cases of clonal evolution had occurred in adult subjects (1 in Cohort 1 at 
Year 5 assessment, and 5 in the Extension Cohort) and none in paediatric subjects. The total number of 
cases was 15 of 154 subjects, 10%:  
•  4 subjects had chromosomal aberrations of unclear significance. 
•  7 of these 15 subjects had loss of chromosome 7, either alone or in combination with complex 
cytogenetic abnormalities (and in 6 of the 7 subjects the alteration in chromosome 7 occurred 
within 6.1 months); in 3 of the 7 subjects this was accompanied by morphologic evidence of 
dysplasia or full myeloid malignant transformation. 
•  One subject had a follow-up bone marrow assessment at 5 years which was markedly changed 
compared to prior bone marrow assessment, with features of dysplasia with hypercellularity 
concerning for potential development of MDS. 
It is unclear if these evolutions occurred due to the underlying disease, the IST and/or eltrombopag, 
however it does not appear that eltrombopag is associated with higher frequency or earlier onset of clonal 
evolution. 
At the update cut-off time to clonal evolution is presented in table 79. In all cohorts, estimated probability 
of being clonal evolution-free was above 90% up to 24 months, and later it decreased below 90% only in

Cohort 1. The evolution to MDS/AML was < 5% in all cohorts except Cohort 1 (16.7%). However, the 
overall median follow-up now extends to 61, 47, 33 and 22 months in Cohort 1, 2, 3 and combined 
Cohort 3 + Extension Cohort, respectively and the difference seen between cohorts in clonal evolution 
might be partially explained by the longer follow-up of the earlier cohorts. These observations are 
consistent with what has been reported in the studies in refractory SAA subjects who received 
eltrombopag alone (Winkler et al 2017). 
Table 79. Time to clonal evolution – FAS (cumulative as of 28-Feb-2018). 
In Study E1202, of the 10 treatment-naïve MAA and SAA subjects treated with eltrombopag, a 
cytogenetic abnormality was detected in one (10%) subject who discontinued eltrombopag on the Day 
355 due to lack of efficacy (relapse after the ATG therapy), and the cytogenetic abnormality (46,XX,del 
(6) (q?)[2]/ 46,XX[18]), which was detected at the withdrawal visit and reported after the data cut-off at 
Week 26. This cytogenetic abnormality was not associated with dysplasia nor increase in bone marrow 
blasts; no progression to MDS was reported. This event was not reported as an AE by Investigator. 
In Study E1201, of the 21 MAA and SAA subjects refractory to IST treated with eltrombopag, 19 had 
normal karyotype and 1 subject had insufficient metaphases to assess karyotype at screening. The 
remaining subject had no data to perform cytogenetics at screening for this study; however, no 
cytogenetic abnormality was observed within 3 months before the study entry. Of the 20 subjects with 
normal karyotype or insufficient metaphases at screening, 18 had a normal karyotype after treatment 
and 3 (14%) subjects (all with a normal karyotype at baseline) had a new cytogenetic abnormality 
detected after treatment:  
• 
In one subject, trisomy 8 was detected in 3/20 metaphases with ≥10% of erythroid dysplasia.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620491/2019 
Page 117/162 
 
  
  
 
 
• 
• 
In another, deletion of chromosome Y in 3/20 metaphase. 
In the third, karyotype was 46XY, inv(10) (p13q24) in 2 metaphases.  
Of these, none had an abnormality involving chromosome 7 by FISH. 
In Study US28T, of the 43 subjects refractory to IST, 7 (16.2%) developed clonal cytogenetic 
abnormalities after treatment. Of these: 
•  5 subjects had cytogenetic abnormalities affecting the structure or number of chromosome 7; all 
5 were non-responders to eltrombopag. One of these 5 had insufficient bone marrow aspirate at 
baseline, so it is unknown whether the cytogenetic abnormality was present in the bone marrow 
prior to treatment with eltrombopag. In one subject, the monosomy 7 was transient and was not 
present on repeat bone marrow examination 21 days later.  
• 
The 2 remaining subjects had trisomy 8 (Subject 8) and deletion of chromosome 13 (Subject 26). 
Three of the seven subjects with a cytogenetic abnormality detected after treatment had evidence of 
dysplasia in their bone marrow examinations, and two were considered to have MDS. For the 7 subjects 
who had a cytogenetic abnormality detected during the study, the median time on study to a cytogenetic 
abnormality was 2.9 months. 
In Study US18T with a median time of initial treatment of 10 months (6-68 months), of the 40 subjects 
refractory to IST, 6 (18%) subjects developed cytogenetic abnormalities during eltrombopag 
administration; and one subject with no metaphases grown at baseline and profound pancytopenia 
developed AML at 2 months; upon re-review of subject’s baseline marrow biopsy showed already blasts 
suggestive for transformation to AML prior to start eltrombopag. Two of the 6 cytogenetic abnormalities 
were in chromosome 7. The author hypothesized that due to the temporal relationship between clonal 
evolution and drug exposure it suggests that in a subgroup of subjects, eltrombopag may promote 
expansion of dormant pre-existing clones with an aberrant karyotype (Winkler et al 2017). 
Given the similar rates of clonal evolution in these two studies (Study US18T and Study US28T), a pooled 
analysis of cytogenetic progression for all subjects (n=83) at up to 8 years of follow-up was performed. 
Sixteen of 83 (18%) subjects clonally evolved. Clonal evolution was an early event after eltrombopag 
initiation: occurred within 6 months in 13/16 evolvers (81%), and in 6/6 evolvers with high risk 
chromosome 7 abnormalities (5/6 within 3 months) (Winkler et al 2017). 
In historical studies where SAA subjects received standard IST (h-ATG + CsA) without eltrombopag as 
first-line, the incidence of clonal evolution in Scheinberg et al (2009) and Scheinberg et al (2012) at a 
median follow-up of 3 years was 9.5% and 21%, respectively. In Rosenfeld et al (2003), clonal evolution 
was reported in 10.6% of the subjects. In Tisdale et al (2000), one chromosomal abnormality classically 
attributed to myelodysplastic syndrome was in reported in the ATG group. 
The overall incidence of clonal evolution in Study AUS01T was 7% and not higher relative to historic data, 
with 5 events of clonal evolution occurred within 6.1 months of starting treatment 4 of which had 
abnormalities in chromosome 7.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Study AUS01T 
After original cut-off period (30-Sept-2016) AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were few, and were 
considered known effects of eltrombopag, or one of the drugs used in the IST (h-ATG and/or CsA) or due 
to the underlying disease. Overall, 6 subjects (4.9%) had an AE leading to treatment discontinuation: 1 
AE of encephalopathy (leading to the subject death; Cohort 1), 4 AEs of rash, and 1 AE of colitis (Cohort 
3 + Extension cohort). 
All  4  events  of  rash  were  reported  as  SAEs;  3  grade  3  and  1  grade  2  event  which  was  associated  with 
fever  and  oral  pain,  resulting  in  hospitalization  and  discontinuation  of  eltrombopag.  Of  the  4  events,  1 
occurred in Cohort 2 (Subject 54), 1 occurred in Cohort 3 (Subject 86) and 2 occurred in the Extension 
Cohort (Subjects 94 and 107). Subjects 86 and 107 were paediatric (6 and 16 years old, respectively). 
Overall,  few  subjects discontinued  treatment  due  to  an  AE,  and  at  the  update  cut-off  (28-Feb-2018)  no 
additional subject discontinued treatment due to an AE (Table 64). 
Table 64. AEs leading to treatment discontinuation-Safety set (cut-off 28-Feb-2018). 
Study E1202 
One subject discontinued treatment due to ECG QT prolonged (grade 2) which was considered not related 
to study treatment by the Investigator. 
Study E1201 
One subject discontinued treatment with study medication due to an abnormal hepatic function (ALT >5 
× ULN and AST >3 × ULN). This was considered by the Investigator to be related to eltrombopag. 
Post marketing experience 
The IBD of Revolade is 20-Nov-2008 (United States).The product is referred to as Promacta, Revolade or 
eltrombopag. GSK was the original MAH until 2015 when Novartis acquired eltrombopag. The MAH 
transfer from GSK to Novartis is still ongoing or has been completed in the countries where the product is 
approved (dates and status vary per country).Novartis is currently the MAH in more than 70 countries.  
Eltrombopag is registered in the following indications: 
- Adult chronic ITP [European Union (EU) approval 28-Jan-2016, US approval 20-Nov- 2008. 
- Paediatric chronic ITP (since 04 Apr 2016 in EU and 11-Jun-2015 in US). 
- Treatment of thrombocytopenia in subjects with chronic HCV (since 19-Sep-2013 in EU and 16-Nov-
2012 in US). 
- SAA in subjects refractory to prior IST (since 25-Aug-2015 in EU and 26-Aug-2014 in the US). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620491/2019

- Aplastic anemia (25-Aug-2017 in Japan). 
Estimates of the cumulative subject exposure, based upon actual exposure data from completed and 
ongoing clinical trials until 30-Sep-2017 is 4463 subjects. The algorithm used to derive post marketing 
exposure data is based on daily dose of 12.5 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg or 75 mg tablets. This brings the 
cumulative exposure to 106,493 subject years worldwide, from the first launch until June 2016. 
Overall, safety data provided in PSUR version 10 (dated 22-Nov-2017) demonstrates that the overall 
benefit-risk assessment balance of eltrombopag in the approved indications remains positive.  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
This  safety  review  is  mainly  based  on  the  results  of  Study  AUS01T  which  evaluated  the  safety  and 
efficacy  of  eltrombopag  in  combination  with  h-ATG  and  CsA  in  subjects  with  SAA  who  had  not  received 
prior definitive IST. Study AUS01T was designed with sequential cohorts with each cohort informing the 
design  of  the  subsequent  one  (in  relation  to  the  duration  of  eltrombopag  treatment,  addition  of 
maintenance  CsA  treatment  and  concurrent  administration  of  all  3  drugs).  As  supportive  data,  the  MAH 
submitted two studies conducted in Japan, Study E1201 and Study E1202, and also historical studies in 
subjects  treated  with  h-ATG  and  CsA  (Tisdale  et  al  (2000),  Rosenfeld  et  al  (2003),  Scheinberg  et  al 
(2009)  and  Scheinberg  et  al  (2011)).  Additional  supportive  safety  data  from  the  refractory  studies  for 
cytogenetic abnormalities are provided from Study US28T and Study US18T. Is important to note that the 
safety  assessment  is  hampered  by  the  lack  of  a  controlled  study  including  the  standard  treatment  (h-
ATG+CsA).  
In Study AUS01T the most common AEs (regardless of causal relationship to study drug) observed with 
an incidence ≥10% were febrile neutropenia (known to occur in SAA), ALT/AST increase (known to occur 
with eltrombopag, h-ATG and CsA), blood bilirubin increase and serum sickness (known to occur with h-
ATG). 
Febrile neutropenia (grade 3.4 or 5) was not reported with higher frequencies in Cohort 3 and Extension 
Cohort    vs.  the  other  cohorts  (6.7%  for  Cohort  1,  16.1%  for  Cohort  2  and  16.1%  for  Cohort  3  and 
Extension Cohort). These results are maintained when updated cut-off is considered. 
The  protocol  specified  grade  3  and  4  liver  function  tests  (LFT)  laboratory  values  under  certain 
circumstances to be captured as AEs. Hepatobiliary AEs were reported more commonly in Cohort 3 and in 
combined Cohort 3 + Extension Cohort original cut-off (40% to 45%) compared to Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 
(17%  to  23%).  However,  on  retrospective  review  of  the  data,  this  rule  was  inconsistently  applied. 
Therefore, MAH considered that these differences were attributed to divergences in the reporting concept. 
Considering this information, for assessment of liver function as a safety observation, laboratory results 
were used as the primary evidence of hepatotoxicity. Due to these divergences in the reporting concept 
and after the updated cut-off (28-Feb-2018) queries were issued to the investigator for all grade 3 and 4 
liver function abnormalities from the beginning of the study to see if they should have been reported as 
an  AE  and  presented  in  comparison  with  what  was  reported  at  the  original  submission.  This  led  to  an 
increase (≥10%) in Cohorts 1 and 2 in reported liver AEs. This increase of liver AEs in these cohorts is a 
consequence of the query process. Therefore, when considering liver related laboratory parameters there 
was no appreciable difference between the cohorts. Most of these AEs reflect increased aminotransferase 
and/or increased blood bilirubin. From Day 1 to Day 13, subjects in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 were receiving 
IST  only  (h-ATG  for  4  days  +  CsA)  while  subjects  in  Cohort  3  and  Extension  Cohort  were  concurrently 
receiving  IST  +  eltrombopag.  As  Cohort  1  and  Cohort  2  had  a  staggered  start  for  eltrombopag  vs. 
concurrent  start  in  Cohort  3  and  Extension  Cohort,  AEs  occurring  during  the  first  13  days  in  these  2 
groups  allows  comparison  of  the  double  therapy  (h-ATG  +  CsA)  vs.  the  triple  therapy  (h-ATG  +  CsA  + 
eltrombopag). When comparing the number of increased liver laboratory parameters (AST/ALT/ and TBIL) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620491/2019 
Page 120/162 
 
  
  
 
in  the  first  13  days,  they  were  consistent  between  the  two  groups  with  AST/ALT  >  3xULN  and  TBIL  > 
2ULN  for  Day  1-13  in  Cohort  1  and  2  observed  in  9  subjects  (14.8%)  and  in  Cohort  3  +  Extension 
observed  in  3  subjects  (4.8%).  Results  obtained  for  this  parameter  for  the  updated  data  were  similar 
(n=5, 5.4%). Furthermore, when looking at the liver function laboratory test up to 3 months, there were 
a limited number of subjects who had an increase of the liver function tests after Day 13 with AST/ALT > 
3xULN and TBIL > 2ULN in Cohort 1 and 2 observed in 7 subjects (11.5%) and in Cohort 3 + Extension 
observed  in  7  subjects  (11.3%).  Results  obtained  for  this  parameter  for  the  updated  data  were  similar 
(n=7,  7.6%).  None  led  to  treatment  discontinuation  and  none  fulfilled  the  criteria  of  severe  DILI 
according to “Hy’s law”. 
In the combined Cohort 3 + Extension Cohort, the incidences of hepatobiliary events at the update cut-off 
were similar to what was observed at original cut-off. 
As  previously  mentioned,  the  lack  of  a  comparator  arm  makes  it  difficult  to  elucidate  which  adverse 
events are due to eltrombopag treatment. However, alterations of liver function are described as adverse 
reactions in Revolade SmPC that are not likely to be reported in patients receiving IST alone.  
All AEs of serum sickness, (eight in all cohorts) began during the first 13 days of start of treatment and 
resolved  within one  week.  Five  of  them  were  reported  as  unlikely  to  be  related  to  eltrombopag  and  the 
remaining  3  AEs  reported  as  unrelated.  Serum  sickness  was  observed  more  frequently  in  Cohort  3  and 
Extension Cohort original cut-off (6 subjects) where all 3 study drugs were given concurrently, compared 
to the other cohorts where eltrombopag was started on Day 14 (none in Cohort 1, 2 in Cohort 2). With 
the updated data 8 subjects reported serum sickness in cohort 3+extension. There is no pharmacological 
rationale how eltrombopag can induce serum sickness and this event has not been seen in earlier studies 
with  eltrombopag  as  a  safety  issue  (there  was  no  AE  of  serum  sickness  reported  in  US28T  study  in 
refractory SAA subjects who received eltrombopag alone).  
No  deaths  related  to  the  study  treatment  were  reported.  All  SAEs  were  considered  known  effects  of 
eltrombopag, of one of the medications used in IST, or due to the underlying disease. 
With the original cut-off few AEs led to treatment discontinuation: Of 6, 1 AE of encephalopathy (leading 
to  the  on-treatment  death  as  above),  4  AEs  of  rash,  and  1  AE  of  colitis.  At  the  updated  cut-off  no 
aditional  subject  discontinue 
treatment  due 
to  an  AE.  Most  of 
the  AEs  requiring  dose 
interruption/adjustment  with  the  original  cut-off  (17  subjects)  were  increased  ALT  and  AST.  After  this 
period the incidence of dose interruptions/adjustments were similar to the ones reported at original cut-
off. 
Regarding  the  adverse  events  of  special  interest,  already  described,  no  events  of  recurrence  of 
thrombocytopenia,  bone  marrow  fibrosis,  or  hematologic  malignancies  were  reported.  Renal  events, 
thromboembolic  events  and  bleeding  events  were  rare  in  all  cohorts.  None  of  these  events  led  to 
treatment  discontinuation  or  to  dose  interruption/adjustment.  After  the  updated  cut-off  no  new  AE  of 
special interest were reported. 
In study AUS01T, 29 (23.6%) subjects were in the paediatric age range (<18 years) with the original cut-
off  and  8  additional  paediatric  patients  were  included.  The  AEs  that  were  observed  in  the  paediatric 
subgroups of 2-5 years, 6-11 years and 12-17 years were similar to those observed in the overall safety 
population. No new safety signals were seen in this population, for both cut-off periods. 
The safety profile observed in other supportive and historical studies included in this application (despite 
of  the  difference  in  the  safety  reporting  criteria  and  the  treatment  given)  is  consistent  with  the  known 
safety profile of eltrombopag, the medications used in IST or to the underlying disease. To what extent 
the  safety  profile  of  eltrombopag  +  IST  differs  from  that  of  standard  IST  alone,  cannot  be  properly 
answered in the absence of a comparator.

Considering  the  adverse  reactions  proposed  to  be  included  in  the  labelling  document  for  the  target 
indication, the strategies carried out for the identification of adverse events described in study AUS01T as 
candidates  for  establish  the  relationship  with  eltrombopag  were  based  on  Novartis  list  of  designated 
medical events and EMA list of designated medical events which was considered acceptable.  
A  serious  complication  of  AA  is  its  evolution  to  clonal  hematologic  diseases  such  as  myelodisplasia  and 
leukemia,  which  is  usually  associated  with  the  appearance  of  a  citogenetic  abnormality  in  bone  marrow 
cells.  Cytogenetic  abnormalities  are  not  necessarily  associated  with  a  bad  outcome,  a  change  in 
symptoms  or  diagnosis  of  malignancy.  In  addition,  and  despite  evident  short-term  efficacy,  long-term 
benefits of IST have been questioned as the late complications of immunosuppression include high rates 
of  relapse,  evolution  to  paroxysmal  nocturnal  haemoglobinuria,  myelodysplasia  and 
leukemic 
transformation (Rosenfeld et al 2003). 
In this context, the analysis of the 2 historical controls studies where SAA subjects received standard IST 
(h-ATG + CsA) without eltrombopag as first-line, the incidence of clonal evolution was 9.5% and 21% at 
3  years  in  Scheinberg  et  al  2009  and  Scheinberg  et  al  2011  respectively.  The  analysis  of  the  studies 
where  SAA  subjects  received  eltrombopag  alone,  the  incidence  of  clonal  evolution  in  the  2  studies  with 
IST refractory subjects (Study US18T and Study US28T) was 18%; in the Japanese refractory subjects it 
was 14% and in the Japanese treatment-naïve subjects it was 10%.  
In  Study  AUS01T  and  with  the  original  cut-off,  clonal  cytogenetic  evolution  occurred  in  9  of  123  (7%) 
subjects which is not higher compare to historical data, with 5 events of clonal evolution occurred within 
6.1 months of starting treatment, 4 of which had abnormalities in chromosome 7. With the updated data, 
a total of 15/154 subjects (10%) reported clonal evolution. These observations are consistent with what 
has  been  reported  in  the  studies  in  refractory  SAA  subjects  who  received  eltrombopag  alone  (Study 
US18T  and  Study  US28T).  Although  it  does  not  appear  that  eltrombopag  is  associated  with  higher 
frequency  or  earlier  onset  of  clonal  evolution,  a  final  conclusion  about  the  early  onset  of  cytogenetic 
abnormalities relative to SAA, immunosuppression treatment or eltrombopag need more data on a higher 
number of patients with a long-term follow-up. In this sense, cytogenetic abnormalities are still included 
in the RMP as an important potential risk.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The  main  uncertainties  related  to  the  assessment  of  the  safety  profile  of  eltrombopag  in  naïve  SAA 
patients have to do with the severity of the underlying condition, the lack of control arm and the overall 
limited database provided. 
Overall, the safety and tolerability of eltrombopag in treatment-naïve SAA patients seems similar to the 
already known safety profile in refractory SAA. Nevertheless, whether the safety profile of eltrombopag + 
IST differs from that of standard IST alone cannot be answered due to the lack of comparator in AUS01T 
study. No new or unexpected findings have been identified for eltrombopag based on the data presented. 
Most of the AE and SAE identified are related to the underlying condition and seem manageable in clinical 
practice.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 52.0 is acceptable. The PRAC endorsed 
PRAC Rapporteur assessment report is attached. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application was of the opinion that due to the 
concerns identified with this application, the risk management plan cannot be agreed at this stage. 
2.6.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable.  
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The MAH applied for an extension of indication to include first line treatment of adult and paediatric 
patients aged 2 years and older with severe aplastic anaemia for Revolade in combination with standard 
immunosuppressive therapy.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The only curative treatment is the hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). However, 
immunosuppressant therapy (IST) with ATG/CsA has changed the prognosis of the disease in patients 
who are not candidates to HCT. First line therapy is selected according to the age of the patient, which 
correlates with ability to tolerate HCT, the severity of the disease and the availability of an appropriate 
donor (basically a fully HLA-matched family member). The treatment must balance the relative toxicities 
and long-term efficacy of the therapies, which differ over time (i.e. higher up-front mortality but greater 
chance of cure with HCT), and according to patient age. Published prospective long-term studies show 
that standard initial IST (horse ATG and CsA) achieve haematological recovery in 60-70% and excellent 
long-term survival among responders. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
For this indication no specific dose finding studies for adults or children have been performed. The 
proposed dose is based on results from refractory SAA study (AUS28T), the exposure observed for 
paediatric and adult ITP patients vs. paediatric SAA patients as well as the PK/PD results and the safety 
profile obtained from the AUS01T updated cut-off (28-Feb-2018). 
The main evidence of efficacy of eltrombopag in treatment-naïve patients with SAA is provided by the 
study AUS01T, a phase I/II, non-randomized, single-arm, single-center study designed to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of eltrombopag treatment, in combination with the regimen of h-ATG and CsA, in 
immunosuppressive therapy-naïve subjects with SAA. This study followed an adaptive design which is 
commonly used in phase I/II single arm trials to assess response rate at an interim time point and allow 
early termination of a cohort if efficacy is not shown. 
Complete response rate at Month 6 was the primary endpoint and it was defined as absolute neutrophil 
count >1×103/ μL, and platelet count >100×103/ μL, and  Hgb>10 g/dL.

Overall, the pivotal study submitted included treatment-naïve patients with SAA in principle not 
candidates to HCT. In all 30 patients were included in cohort 1, 31 in cohort 2 and 3. In addition, it was 
proposed to add the extension cohort to recruit more subjects with the same dosing regimen as Cohort 3, 
and collect more data for the analysis of the secondary endpoints within the target regimen. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Complete response (CR), the primary endpoint, was observed in 33.3%, 25.8% and 58.1% of subjects in 
cohort 1, cohort 2 and cohort 3, respectively (FAS  population) at month 6 of treatment. When cohort 3 
and  the  extension  cohort  were  pooled  (cut-off  28  feb-2018)  CR  was  observed  in  43.7%  of  patients  at 
month 6.  
More than 75% of the whole population achieved an OR (PR or CR) at month 3 (76.7%, 77.4%, 87.1% 
and  79.6%,  for  Cohort  1,  2,  3  and  3+extension,  respectively)  and  improved  at  month  6  (80%,  87.1%, 
93.51% and 84.8%, for Cohort 1, 2, 3 and 3+extension, respectively). Updated data have been provided 
with a cut-off of February 2018 for study AUS01T. In this study, eltrombopag has a durable effect since 
50% of patients achieved a complete response at any time, and 83.1% of them still responded at month 
18. Among the patients with overall response during the study (76.1%), 72.9% of patients still responded 
18 months later.  
Some comparisons versus historical controls have been provided, suggesting that the combination could 
have better efficacy in adults over h-ATG+CsA alone in terms of CR at month 6. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Study AUS01T is a small phase I/II study in which 92 patients were included in cohort 3+extension (cut-
off 28-February 2018). This study followed an adaptive design that it is acceptable in early steps of 
development where dose response and the best regimen are being studied. However, this study has been 
submitted as the pivotal evidence for efficacy in the new indication. Although conducting a randomized 
controlled trial in this clinical setting may be challenging, the performance of a controlled trial would have 
been crucial to assess in a robust way the efficacy results in the treatment-naïve severe aplastic anemia. 
In fact, a study comparing hATG+CsA vs hATG+CsA+Eltrombopag for SAA (Study RACE) sponsored by 
European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation with Novartis and Pfizer as collaborators is ongoing 
showing that a comparative study to support the first line indication in SAA patients is feasible. 
The absence of a comparator is the main limitation for the assessment of the addition of eltrombopag to 
IST.  In the comparison versus historical controls the MAH has made an effort to match patients to assure 
the comparability of the groups. However, the use of external comparators has relevant limitations since 
in the absence of randomisation it is not possible to control all known and unknown prognostic factors 
that can have an impact on the results. For a robust evaluation of efficacy, a phase III trial with 
randomisation and a comparison with the standard treatment would be needed. Since the RACE study 
differs mainly in the dose regimen of IST and eltrombopag in relation to AUS01T study, this study could 
be considered supportive for a 1st line indication when results become available. 
The maintenance of the effect beyond 6 months is not demonstrated as a decline in OR is observed at 
month 12 for patients on all cohorts. The MAH has provided updated results (cut-off of February 2018) 
showing that 83.1% of patients who achieved a CR at any time of the study and 72.9% of those with OR 
during the study still responded 18 months later, but it should be considered that patients did not receive 
eltrombopag beyond month 6 while they remained on CsA for the whole follow-up period. Therefore, the 
prolonged effect  is likely to be related to the continuous administration of CsA.  
Data on the effect of eltrombopag + IST on transfusion requirements are clinically relevant and important 
from the patient perspective. While the MAH states that transfusion data were not systematically 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620491/2019 
Page 124/162 
 
  
  
 
recorded in study AUS01T it is known that legislation compels blood transfusion centres/hospitals to 
record every transfusion done including information about the receptors (i.e. type and date of transfusion 
as well as patient identification). The MAH has provided some data on transfusion-free interval. However, 
the lack of a comparator in the pivotal study is the key point that prevents from concluding on the true 
benefit/risk balance of Revolade as first line option in SAA patients. 
No efficacy data are available for r-ATG. Considering that the only ATG available in different countries in 
the EU is r-ATG, this could potentially have an impact on the efficacy results. Available data comparing 
both ATG efficacy are conflicting and it is not possible to reach a clear conclusion on if one of the two ATG 
performs better. Information on the type of ATG used in the trial would have had to be included in the 
SmPC if this application would have been considered acceptable. 
Few children and adolescents were included in study AUS01T. Updated data (cut-off 28-Feb_2018) 
contributed with 13 children older than 12 years of age of whom only 6 patients reached CR. None of the 
patients in the subgroup of 2-5 years of age and only 1 out of 11 patients between 6 and 11 years old 
reached CR. Although efficacy in adolescents seems similar to that in adults it is based on very limited 
data and the comparison with historical studies was not feasible due to the lack of efficacy data by age 
group in those studies. Therefore, the inclusion of this population in the indication is not sufficiently 
supported.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall,  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  eltrombopag  in  treatment-naive  SAA  patients  appears  consistent 
with what was shown in previous indications as no new or unexpected findings have been identified. Most 
of  the  AE  and  SAE  identified  are  related  to  the  underlying  condition  and  are  manageable  in  clinical 
practice.  
In study AUS01T the most common AEs (regardless of causal relationship to study drug) observed with 
an incidence ≥10% were febrile neutropenia (known to occur in SAA), ALT/AST increase (known to occur 
with eltrombopag, h-ATG and CsA), blood bilirubin increase and serum sickness (known to occur with h-
ATG). 
No deaths related to the study treatment were reported.  
Few  AEs  led  to  treatment  discontinuation:  Of  6,  1  AE  of  encephalopathy  (leading  to  the  on-treatment 
death  as  above),  4  AEs  of  rash,  and  1  AE  of  colitis.  Most  of  the  AEs  requiring  dose 
interruption/adjustment (17 subjects) were increased ALT and AST. 
Regarding  the  adverse  events  of  special  interest  already  described,  no  events  of  recurrence  of 
thrombocytopenia,  bone  marrow  fibrosis,  or  hematologic  malignancies  were  reported.  Renal  events, 
thromboembolic  events  and  bleeding  events  were  rare  in  all  cohorts.  None  of  these  events  led  to 
treatment discontinuation or to dose interruption/adjustment. 
A  serious  complication  of  AA  is  its  evolution  to  clonal  hematologic  diseases  such  as  myelodisplasia  and 
leukemia, which is usually associated with the appearance of a cytogenetic abnormality in bone marrow 
cells.  In  Study  AUS01T,  clonal  cytogenetic  evolution  occurred  in  9  of  123  (7%)  subjects  which  is  not 
higher  compared  to  historical  data,  with  5  events  of  clonal  evolution  occurred  within  6.1  months  of 
starting  treatment,  4  of  which  had  abnormalities  in  chromosome  7.  These  observations  are  consistent 
with  what  has  been  reported  in  the  studies  in  refractory  SAA  subjects  who  received  eltrombopag  alone 
(Study US18T and Study US28T).

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The assessment of safety of eltrombopag in this population is hampered by the severity of the underlying 
condition, the lack of control arm and the overall limited database. Although the safety profile seems 
similar to that observed for the refractory SAA indication the lack of comparator prevents from 
ascertaining which adverse events are related to the addition of eltrombopag.  
A final conclusion about the early onset of cytogenetic abnormalities relative to SAA, immunosuppressant 
treatment or eltrombopag cannot be reached until having more data on a higher number of patients with 
a long-term follow-up more data on additional subjects is needed. In this regard, “cytogenetic 
abnormalities” is already included in the RMP as an important potential risk. 
Six deaths (5 on-treatment and 1 in screening) have been reported in study SOAR. The aim of this study 
was to assess the efficacy and safety of the combination of eltrombopag and cyclosporine alone in naïve 
SAA patients. The impact that this can have in the B/R balance of the current application is unknown. The 
MAH has provided information about the possible reasons regarding these deaths. In principle, the 
available data do not suggest that eltrombopag is the cause. The lack of efficacy related to the infra-
therapeutic dose of CsA and the lack of h-ATG in the treatment scheme were discarded. This issue can 
only be further understood when the SOAR study will end.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The  only  curative  treatment  is  the  hematopoietic  cell  transplantation  (HCT).  In  patients  who  are  not 
candidate to hematopoietic cell transplantation treatment is based on immunosuppressant therapy (IST) 
with  ATG/CsA.  As  there  are  still  patients  who  do  not  achieve  a  complete  haematological  response  with 
this treatment any medicinal product improving clinical outcomes is welcome.  
In this variation the MAH is seeking the first line use of eltrombopag+IST in SAA patients. Efficacy results 
for  the  whole  population  show  that  around  44%  of  patients  reached  CR  (primary  endpoint)  and  79% 
achieved  OR  (CR  or  PR)  at  month  6  when  treated  with  eltrombopag+IST.  However,  the  lack  of  a  direct 
comparison versus the current standard of care severely limits the efficacy conclusions.  
Data  on  haematological  response  from  AUS01T  study  were  compared  with  historical  data  that  used 
standard  of  care.  Data  seem  promising  but  the  limitations  of  such  comparisons  are  well  known  and 
prevent  from  drawing  any  sound  conclusions.  A  randomised  clinical  trial  showing  better  results  of  the 
combination  versus  IST  alone  would  solve  the  uncertainties.  Other  relevant  clinical  data  are  transfusion 
requirements  that  have  an  important  impact  on  morbidity  and  QoL  of  patients.  As  stated  by  the  MAH, 
these data were not systematically recorded in AUS01T study, although legislation regarding transfusions 
compels blood transfusion centres/hospitals to record every transfusion done including information about 
the receptors (i.e type and date of transfusion as well as patient identification). The MAH provided some 
data  on  transfusion-free  interval.  However,  the  lack  of  a  comparator  in  the  pivotal  study  remains  the 
main unresolved issue that prevents from concluding on the positive benefit/risk balance of Revolade as 
first line option in SAA patients. 
In  relation  to  the  maintenance  of  the  effect,  since  patients  did  not  received  eltrombopag  after  Month  6 
the effect beyond this time point is likely to be related to the continuous administration of CsA.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Improvement in blood counts has been shown over time in study AUS01T. However, the evidence 
provided is weak as it comes from a phase I/II, single arm clinical trial in combination with IST and 
mainly relies on the haematological response compared with historical controls. Such comparisons are 
problematic due to the impossibility that all known and unknown prognostic factors that can impact on 
the results have been controlled in the absence of randomisation. These limitations prevent reaching a 
sound conclusion on the contribution of Revolade to the effect observed. Data on improvement of 
transfusion-free interval and the correlation between complete responses and longer relapse-free survival 
have been provided. However, no comparison versus IST has been given. 
The  safety  profile  of  eltrombopag  in  naive  SAA  patients  seems  similar  to  that  of  the  refractory  SAA 
population  although  the  data  provided  are  rather  limited.  Nevertheless,  whether  there  are  relevant 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620491/2019

differences  in  the  safety  profile  between  eltrombopag  +  IST  and  the  standard  IST  alone,  cannot  be 
answered due to the lack of comparator.  
Uncertainties  remain  on  the  potential  risk  of  inducing  cytogenetic  abnormalities/MDS  progression,  given 
that these are expected findings in the studied population. 
There are scarce data in paediatric population and efficacy in children younger than 11 years of age has 
not been demonstrated. For adolescents, efficacy has not been sufficiently demonstrated. Given all this, a 
conclusion on the benefit/risk balance for this population is not possible.   
Some treatment effect of eltrombopag on top of IST as first line treatment in SAA adults in terms of CR 
and OR has been found. Data provided are encouraging despite the difficult interpretation caused by the 
lack  of  a  comparator  arm  in  the  clinical  trial  receiving  IST  alone.  The  use  of  external  cohorts  for 
comparison  with  standard  of  care  suggest  better  response  with  the  addition  of  eltrombopag  but  the 
limitations of such comparisons are well known and alleviate only partially the concerns. 
The  safety  profile  of  eltrombopag  in  naive  SAA  patients  seems  similar  to  that  of  the  refractory  SAA 
population  although  the  data  provided  are  rather  limited.  Nevertheless,  whether  there  are  relevant 
differences  in  the  safety  profile  between  eltrombopag  +  IST  and  the  standard  IST  alone,  cannot  be 
answered  due  to  the  lack  of  comparator.  Reported  alteration  of  liver  function  suggest  that  they  are 
related to the addition of eltrombopag to IST.  
The benefit-risk balance for eltrombopag for the first-line treatment of acquired severe aplastic anaemia 
(SAA)  in  combination  with  standard  immunosuppressive  therapy  in  adult  and  paediatric  patients  aged 
12 years and above who are not eligible for a haematopoietic stem cell transplant at the time of diagnosis 
is negative. 
The study RACE, comparing eltrombopag+IST versus IST in adult SAA patients, currently ongoing, could 
be used only as supportive evidence considering the differences in the posology with the pivotal trial. A 
comparative study versus standard of care is considered necessary to demonstrate the benefit of adding 
eltrombopag to IST in the first line treatment of SAA patients. 
From a safety point of view, no unexpected findings have been identified compared to the refractory SAA 
population.  However,  due  to  the  absence  of  a  comparator  in  study  AUS-01T  including  the  standard  of 
care it is not possible to know the contribution of eltrombopag to the safety profile of the combination in 
this setting.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Data in adolescent and children are specially limited and it is not possible to conclude on the benefit/risk 
balance in this subsets.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Revolade is negative.

Grounds for refusal 
Whereas: 
• 
The efficacy and safety data of eltrombopag on top of standard of care as first line treatment of 
patients with severe aplastic anemia has not been sufficiently demonstrated. The submitted 
data, based on study NIH AUS01T, do not allow a reliable and valid assessment of the benefit of 
Revolade when added to the standard of care (SOC) due to the lack of a robust comparison 
against established treatment. The indirect comparison with historical data cannot overcome this 
deficiency.  
Therefore,  it  is  not  possible  to  establish  a  positive  benefit  risk  balance  for  Revolade  in  the  proposed 
indication. 
Divergent positions to the majority recommendation are appended to this report. 
5.  Re-examination of the CHMP opinion of 27 June 2019 
Following the CHMP conclusion that Revolade was not approvable because the efficacy and safety data of 
eltrombopag on top of standard of care as first line treatment of patients with severe aplastic anaemia 
has not been sufficiently demonstrated, the MAH submitted detailed grounds for the re-examination of 
the grounds for refusal.  
Detailed grounds for re-examination submitted by the applicant 
The MAH presented in writing and at an oral explanation arguments refuting the grounds for refusal. The 
MAH argumentation was as follows: 
Grounds for refusal: 
• 
The efficacy and safety data of eltrombopag on top of standard of care as first line treatment of 
patients with severe aplastic anaemia has not been sufficiently demonstrated. The submitted

deficiency.  
Executive summary 
Novartis acknowledges the Agency’s concern on the lack of a robust comparison against the established 
treatment in the pivotal study AUS01T and the challenges generally faced with single-arm studies to 
adequately assess clinical benefit of a treatment. Nonetheless, Novartis is of the opinion that the results 
Assessment report

shown in AUS01T in consideration of the high unmet medical need for patients with SAA who are 
unsuitable for a HSCT, justify the addition of eltrombopag to standard IST (h-ATG/CsA) for the first-line 
treatment of SAA.  
As of today, the treatment of SAA with standard IST (h-ATG/CsA) remains suboptimal with few complete 
responses and high rate of relapses and refractoriness (Desmond et al. 2015, Townsley et al. 2017). 
These patients remain at risk of morbidities due to prolonged pancytopenia which is difficult for patients 
to sustain and for treating physicians to manage (Desmond et al. 2015, Scheinberg. 2018, Townsley et 
al. 2017). The outcome of SAA patients being treated with standard IST (h-ATG/CsA) is predictable and 
has not changed for the last 20 years despite many endeavours in trying to improve this outcome 
through using additional immunosuppressive agents or adding growth factors, until eltrombopag, a 
thrombopoeitin mimetic, has proven efficacy in the refractory SAA setting, through stimulation of the 
bone marrow stem and progenitor cells (Desmond et al. 2015, Townsley et al. 2017). Based on this novel 
discovery and the exciting prospect of breaking the ‘ceiling effect’ in response that has been observed for 
so long with IST alone, the AUS01T trial was set up to investigate eltrombopag in combination with 
standard IST (h-ATG/CsA) for the first-line treatment of SAA (Desmond et al. 2015, Scheinberg. 2018, 
Townsley et al. 2017).  
At the time the AUS01T study was designed, eltrombopag treatment had never been initiated together 
with h-ATG and CsA, thus uncertainties existed on the tolerability and efficacy of this triple drug regimen. 
Therefore, the design of the AUS01T pilot study was adapted for each cohort based on the accumulated 
knowledge from previous cohorts to optimize the treatment regimen. The highest quality and durability of 
haematological response was observed in Cohort 3 + Extension when eltrombopag was added 
concomitantly on Day 1 to IST for 6 months, followed by low dose of maintenance CsA treatment: a 
complete response (CR) rate of 44% and an overall response (OR) rate of 79%.  
In the absence of a direct comparison against the standard of care in the AUS01T study, the study results 
were compared to high-quality and rigorously selected historical controls, confirming the unprecedented 
treatment effect observed by adding eltrombopag to IST in the first-line SAA setting (2-3-fold increase in 
CR rate observed in AUS01T; see section 3.4.2). The safety of the combination of eltrombopag with IST 
was acceptable with no patient discontinuing for a hepatic event and no increase of the rate of clonal 
evolutions; the safety profile was in line with the already known safety of the three drugs, as reported in 
their respective product information, further supporting the positive benefit-risk of adding eltrombopag to 
IST for the first-line treatment of SAA. 
In addition to the above and in order to address the Agency’s concern on the lack of representativeness in 
the historical controls, Novartis conducted a sensitivity analysis comparing the results of the AUS01T 
study to a broader list of studies that did not meet the initial stringent selection criteria for the historical 
controls. The results of these analyses are consistent with the findings of the primary comparison to the 
historical control and further confirm the conclusion that eltrombopag when added to IST, brings a 
significant increase in haematological response (see section 3.6).  
Novartis also engaged discussions with the EBMT in order to provide early data from the RACE study 
during the re-examination process of this application.  
In summary, the key points discussed in this detailed grounds for re-examination include: 
•  Unmet medical need for SAA patients remains high despite IST treatment and with no drug 
currently approved in EU for this disease; 
• 
The current standard of care in SAA is shifting worldwide to use eltrombopag in combination with 
IST for the first-line treatment of SAA;   
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620491/2019 
Page 130/162 
 
  
  
 
•  Significant and robust improvement in CR rate observed in a well-designed study AUS01T by the 
NIH, as compared to matched historical controls;  
• 
The responses in AUS01T (CR and OR) also compare favourably to a broader pool of historical 
trials conducted worldwide, which supports the generalizability of AUS01T findings; 
•  Safety profile of eltrombopag in first-line SAA is in line with the known safety profile in the other 
approved indications, with no new safety signals identified. 
Based on this, Novartis strongly believes that the benefit of adding eltrombopag to IST for the first-line 
treatment of SAA patients outweighs the risks and justifies the present request for re-examination. 
Novartis remains committed to help make this disease-modifying treatment available as quickly as 
possible in Europe to address a high unmet medical need in patients with SAA and would like to kindly 
request the Agency to re-evaluate its negative opinion. The detailed grounds for re-examination are 
presented thereafter and specifically address the Agency’s major concerns: 
Unmet medical need in SAA remains high despite IST 
SAA is a rare, life threatening bone marrow disease characterised by tri-lineage pancytopenias and lack of 
haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). SAA has a very low incidence in Europe and North 
America, with about two cases per million/year and a bimodal distribution with peaks occurring mainly in 
patients aged 15 to 25 years old and those over 60 (Young et al. 2006, Young and Kaufman 2008, Marsh 
et al 2009).  
Historically, SAA was nearly uniformly a fatal diagnosis due to infections or excessive bleedings resulting 
from prolonged pancytopenia: untreated SAA can result in 80-90% mortality in 1-2 years (Rosenfeld et al 
2003). HSCT is the preferred treatment option when possible, however, less than 30% of SAA patients 
are suitable candidates for HSCT due to the lack of a matched sibling donor, infectious complications, and 
graft failure especially in older patients (Rosenfeld et al. 2003, Desmond et al. 2015). 
Treatment with IST consisting of h-ATG combined with CsA, proved to be the treatment of choice for SAA 
patients who do not qualify for HSCT. However, of those patients treated with this regimen, one quarter 
to one third will not respond, and 40% of responders relapse (Rosenfeld et al. 2003, Desmond et al. 
2015, Townsley et al. 2017) 
Patients who relapse or are refractory to a first course of IST may be eligible for salvage therapies 
including eltrombopag, however, more than half of patients who receive eltrombopag monotherapy in the 
refractory/relapsed setting will not respond, and those who respond usually require continued use 
(Desmond et al. 2015, Marsh and Kulasekararaj. 2013). Other therapies such as a second course of IST 
add on toxicity and do not lead to better outcome (Scheinberg et al. 2012, Scheinberg et al. 2006). 
The outcome remains poor for patients who have an insufficient response to IST or relapse, with limited 
treatment options (Desmond et al. 2015, Townsley et al. 2017).  These patients are exposed longer to 
higher risks of ongoing morbidity such as infections or bleeding because of their pancytopenia. 
Approximately 40% of unresponsive patients die within 5 years of diagnosis. Therefore, every effort to 
reduce the pool of SAA patients who relapse or are refractory to IST is highly preferable (Rosenfeld et al. 
2003, Desmond et al. 2015, Townsley et al. 2017).  
In addition to the above, it is important to note that the majority of the haematological responses 
observed following initial IST are partial responses, with only a few patients achieving complete 
responses. Partial responders remain at higher risk of morbidity and need further transfusions and 
ultimately relapse (Rosenfeld et al. 2003, Desmond et al. 2015).

Young age, baseline absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) are known 
prognostic factors in SAA and were in general associated with better response to IST (Rosenfeld et al. 
2003, Scheinberg et al. 2009). However, a favourable response to IST with a better quality of response 
(CR versus partial response (PR)) cannot be routinely or reliably predicted (Scheinberg et al. 2009) and it 
is therefore not possible to identify the population of patients that will or will not respond or relapse after 
a first course of IST, thus making it important to treat all SAA patients early with eltrombopag combined 
with IST, to reduce the pool of refractory and relapsed patients who experience significant morbidity, and 
improve outcome overall. 
It is also noteworthy to mention that since the successful addition of CsA to h-ATG, the outcome of SAA 
patients has not changed for over 20 years. Several efforts to introduce growth factors, androgens, other 
immunosuppressants (mycophenolate mofetil, sirolimus) or the use of more potent lymphocytotoxic 
agents (rabbit ATG, cyclophosphamide, alemtuzumab) were shown to be unsuccessful, with no 
improvement in response rates and/or prohibitive toxicity (Scheinberg P, Young NS. 2012). This led to 
the conclusion that a ‘ceiling effect’ was reached with IST alone, until the compelling results shown by 
adding eltrombopag concomitantly to IST (h-ATG/CsA) in the pivotal study AUS01T (Desmond et al. 
2015, Townsley et al. 2017, Scheinberg. 2018).  
In summary, in treatment-naive patients with SAA, increasing the speed and the quality of the 
haematologic recovery, shortens the time at risk for infections, bleeding, transfusions, clonal evolution 
and increases the potential for improved survival (Rosenfeld et al. 2003). Treatment with IST alone in the 
first-line setting is a suboptimal treatment with a predictable outcome demonstrated by decades of 
clinical practice, therefore, the objective of adding eltrombopag in the pivotal study AUS01T early and 
concomitantly to standard immunosuppressive treatment (h-ATG/CsA) aimed at both improving the 
quality of the response and reducing the pool of refractory patients which represent a high unmet medical 
need. 
Rationale for using eltrombopag added to IST in first-line SAA 
Aplastic anaemia is characterised by a very limited number of HSCs due to a T cell autoimmune-mediated 
destruction of the bone marrow. Several preclinical experiments have demonstrated positive effect of TPO 
and the TPO-receptor on expansion of HSPCs (Zeigler et al. 1994, Alexander et al. 1996, Kimura et al. 
1998, Qian et al. 2007).  
TPO is an important regulator of haematopoiesis and is known to have distinct properties in stimulating 
HSCs. At first, TPO was associated with megakaryocyte stimulation and platelet production (Kuter et al. 
1994). However, results from in vitro studies indicated that the hormone played rather an important role 
in the stem cell proliferation and maintenance, mainly for the below reasons: 
•  Unlike the receptors for erythropoietin and G-CSF, the TPO-receptor (c-MPL) is expressed on 
HSCs (Yoshihara et al. 2007);  
• 
In TPO knockout mice models, significant reductions in HSCs were observed in addition to 
megakaryocytopenia and thrombocytopenia (Alexander et al. 1996, Qian et al. 2007, Fox et al. 
2002); 
•  TPO is frequently used with other growth factors to stimulate stem cells in vitro (Yoshihara et al. 
2007); 
•  Mutations in the c-MPL results in multi-lineage cytopenias (Ballmaier et al. 2003, Ihara et al. 
1999, Tonelli et al. 2000, Ballmaier et al. 2001). 
Eltrombopag, a TPO receptor agonist (TPO-RA), was thought to be active in ameliorating not only 
megakaryocyte proliferation but also the marrow function through its involvement in HSC haematopoiesis 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620491/2019 
Page 132/162 
 
  
  
 
as well as thrombopoiesis. At first, the very high level of endogenous TPO in SAA patients suggested that 
TPO-RA may not be effective, however, the efficacy of eltrombopag (as monotherapy) was first confirmed 
through the compelling results observed in the refractory SAA setting, resulting in 40% responses 
including multi-lineage responses and then in the first-line SAA setting in combination with IST leading to 
a complete response rate of 44% (Desmond et al. 2014, Scheinberg. 2018, Townsley et al. 2017) and 
supported by a unique mechanism of action.   
Eltrombopag was found to bind to the c-MPL at a different site than endogenous TPO. Furthermore, 
recent studies indicate that Interferon gamma (IFNγ) in SAA, would be released by autoreactive cytotoxic 
T cells (CTL) and forms heteromeric complexes with TPO, thus blocking the TPO from binding to the c-
MPL at both high and low affinity, and eltrombopag is thought to evade this process (Alvado et al. 2019). 
All the mechanisms by which eltrombopag improves the marrow function are diverse and still being 
investigated (Scheinberg et al. 2018). 
Considering the pathophysiology of SAA, the results of the studies investigating stronger 
immunosuppressant associated with the theory of a T cells mediated autoimmune disease suggest that 
autoimmune T cells survive the assault of IST compounded with an important destruction of the primitive 
haematopoietic compartment preventing the haematopoietic cells from recovering, even after the 
immune reaction is controlled (Scheinberg et al. 2018). 
Taking this into account, eltrombopag, when added earlier and before the bone marrow becomes depleted 
from the immune assault, complements the immunosuppressive effect of IST by increasing the pool of 
haematopoietic stem cells, leading to a more robust and durable response than with IST alone (Townsley 
et al. 2017), which is associated with better long-term outcome and decreased risk of clonal evolution, 
since a larger and more heterogeneous stem cell reserve is thought to ensure less stress on individual 
clone thus limiting oncogenesis (Rosenfeld et al. 2003, Desmond et al. 2015).   
Compelling results from a well conducted study 
Study AUS01T, designed to optimize the treatment regimen  
In SAA, eltrombopag was first investigated in SAA patients unresponsive to initial IST. In the dose 
escalation study (pivotal study supporting the refractory SAA indication) thereafter referred to as 
AUS028T, treatment with eltrombopag monotherapy led to a 40% response rate (Desmond et al. 2014). 
Multi-lineage responses as well as improvement in marrow cellularity were observed suggesting the 
stimulation of HSCs by eltrombopag (Desmond et al. 2015). These results were further confirmed by a 
subsequent Phase 2 study (AUS18T) initiated after AUS01T, in which 39 patients were treated with a 150 
mg dose of eltrombopag during 6 months. Improvement in response rates was consistent with what was 
observed in AUS28T with 49% at Month 6 and with even more frequent multi-lineage responses given the 
higher starting dose and the longer duration of treatment (Winkler T et al. 2017). 
Based on the results observed in the first refractory SAA study AUS028T which were later confirmed by 
the AUS18T study, eltrombopag was for the first time evaluated in the first-line setting in combination 
with the standard of care IST (CsA+h-ATG), in the pivotal study AUS01T. The intent of adding 
eltrombopag to IST was to counter the ‘ceiling effect’ in haematological responses reached by h-ATG/CsA 
alone and reduce the pool of refractory patients. As discussed previously, the refractoriness to IST 
treatment in about one third of the patients suffering from SAA, is thought to be due to a profound 
destruction of HSCs that could not recover, even with immunosuppression (Desmond et al. 2015).  
The AUS01T is the first study in which eltrombopag was studied in combination with CsA and h-ATG and 
considering that the safety and efficacy of the triple drug combination was not known at the time, 
conducting a randomized study was considered premature. The AUS01T is a well-conducted trial by

worldwide recognised medical experts at the NIH with a broad knowledge and expertise in the treatment 
of SAA patients. The study was appropriately designed to optimize the treatment regimen through three 
sequential cohorts and an extension cohort that differed by the time and duration of treatment of 
eltrombopag and maintenance CsA (see Figure 3-1). 
In study AUS01T, the starting dose of eltrombopag at 150 mg (75 mg in East Asian patients) was based 
on the results from study AUS028T, the pivotal refractory study, where all but three patients escalated 
eltrombopag to a 150 mg dose, and there were no responders below that dose.  
In Cohort 1 of AUS01T study, eltrombopag was started at 150 mg on Day 14 and combined with standard 
IST (h-ATG+CsA) for a total treatment duration of 6 months. This regimen resulted in a significant CR 
rate of 33%. The reason for starting eltrombopag on Day 14 was to avoid potential hepatotoxicity from 
the combination of the three drugs.  
In Cohort 2, eltrombopag was also added to IST on Day 14 at 150 mg but only given for 3 months in an 
effort to obtain the same promising results observed in Cohort 1 with less exposure to eltrombopag. This 
regimen, however, resulted in a drop of CR rate to 26%. Sustained haematological response correlates 
with better survival since patients are less exposed to risks for morbidities (Rosenfeld et al. 2003). 
Therefore, in order to maintain the responses seen by combining eltrombopag to IST with the intent to 
improve survival, low dose maintenance CsA was added to responding patients after Month 6.  
Based on the reassuring safety results observed in Cohorts 1 and 2 and in order to increase the number 
of responders, in Cohort 3 + Extension, eltrombopag was administered concomitantly with h-ATG and 
CsA on Day 1 for a duration of 6 months followed by low dose maintenance CsA. This optimized 
treatment regimen resulted in a CR rate of 44%. These results confirmed the optimal treatment regimen 
leading to earlier and robust haematological recovery which correlates with better long-term outcome and 
has consequently been recommended as the proposed regimen in the current application for the 
extension of indication for use of Revolade (eltrombopag) in combination with IST as first-line treatment 
of SAA.

Significant treatment effect when eltrombopag is added to IST in first-line 
SAA 
Increase in the haematological response is considered the strongest surrogate for survival in SAA and is 
therefore the main endpoint when assessing efficacy of a treatment (Rosenfeld et al. 2003).  
The primary endpoint in study AUS01T consisting of the CR rate at Month 6, is an objective endpoint 
based solely on blood counts unaided by blood transfusions and growth factors and, confirmed by a 
second blood sample collected at least one week later.  
To confirm the benefit of adding eltrombopag to IST, the CR rate observed in study AUS01T was 
compared to three well-matched historical studies (all conducted in the same institution - NIH) using 
various methods and accounting for the covariates influencing the outcome (see details in section 3.5).  
The results of study AUS01T demonstrated an outstanding efficacy. The CR rate in Cohort 3 + Extension 
exceeded by approximately 27% the CR rate historically reported (see Figure 3-2; CR rate of 44% in 
AUS01T vs. historical CR rate of 17% obtained from fixed effect meta-analysis). The CR rates were 
consistent across the three historical control trials conducted over an extended period of time (13 years), 
further confirming the validity of the historical controls as well as the predictable outcome of IST alone in 
the first-line setting, thus assuring the acceptability of this pivotal single-arm trial in this indication.  
Figure 3-2 
Study AUS01T showed significantly higher CR rate compared to historical controls
In addition to the above, Novartis would like to emphasise that the results (CR and OR) of the AUS01T 
study observed in each cohort as well as in all cohorts combined, were higher than historically reported 
response rates as shown in Table 3-1 below.

Novartis would also like to highlight that in patients 12 years and above only, which represent the patient 
population included in the proposed indication, a CR rate of 49.3% (37/75) was observed in Cohort 3 + 
Extension, which represents a more significant improvement in CR by 32.2 % (95% confidence interval 
(CI): [18.9%, 45.6%]) compared to historically reported CR rate of 17% with IST alone (see details in 
section 3.10). 
In addition to the substantially higher CR rate, the efficacy of adding eltrombopag to IST was also 
demonstrated through the achievement of a long transfusion-free interval and sustained response. 
Rigorously selected historical control  
Novartis acknowledges that a direct comparison against established treatment in a randomised trial is 
preferred. However, we conducted a rigorous historical control analysis to ensure comparison of the same 
patient population, treated with the same IST regimen (in terms of drugs, doses and duration) and 
evaluated using the same endpoints, in order to minimise bias. 
An extensive literature search, described in detail below, was conducted to identify all similarly designed 
trials that have been published. This included a review of the literature, searching for clinical trials 
conducted in aplastic anaemia (AA) patients, regardless of the study design, treatment and endpoints. 
This search was done in PubMed with the following search criteria: 
(((aplastic anemia[Title]) OR aplastic anaemia[Title]) AND clinical trials) AND ("2001/01/01"[Date - 
Publication]: "2016/09/23"[Date - Publication]) 
In order to provide a reasonably contemporaneous comparison, all studies reported within a time period 
of approximately 15 years, 01-Jan-2001 to 23-Sept-2016, were considered for inclusion, in addition to 
studies prior to 01-Jan-2001 if they were mentioned in AUS01T study protocol as potential historical 
controls.  
A total of 165 publications were retrieved with the above search. Of these, 67 met the criteria for 
inclusion, i.e., they were clinical studies evaluating a medical therapy in patients with severe aplastic 
anaemia. 
As the search continued during the preparation of the dossier, a later update included publications issued 
from 23-Sep-2016 to 31-Dec-2017 which resulted in five additional publications, including (Townsley et al 
2017) publication reporting results from AUS01T study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620491/2019 
Page 136/162 
 
  
  
 
 
 
In summary, a total of 71 publications, excluding Townsley et al 2017 (the subject of this application), 
were considered for further investigation. These trials were evaluated for inclusion using the following 
criteria: 
• 
• 
IST-naïve patients included in the trial 
IST consisting of h-ATG+CsA for at least one arm 
•  Definition of complete and/or overall responses based on the same criteria as in AUS01T and 
response rate at Month 6 reported 
• 
IST regimen comparable to AUS01T in terms of drugs doses and durations 
Only studies that met all the criteria above were included as historical controls.  
This selection resulted in three studies (Rosenfeld et al 2003, Scheinberg et al 2009 and Scheinberg et al 
2011). A fourth study mentioned in the protocol and published earlier (Tisdale et al 2000) met the above 
criteria and was added to the pool of historical control studies (see Figure 3-3 for details). All four studies 
were coincidentally conducted at the NIH, the same institution conducting study AUS01T, adding to the 
validity of the historical controls to minimise bias, since the standard medical management within this 
single institution was more likely to be similar.  
For completeness, a literature search of studies published before 2001 did not show any other study that 
met the criteria except Tisdale et al 2000 mentioned above and Rosenfeld et al 1995 of which an updated 
version published in 2003 was already used as a historical control study.  
Furthermore, Novartis obtained from the NIH individual patient data from the two most recent studies 
(Scheinberg et al 2009 and Scheinberg et al 2011), including demographic data and baseline blood counts 
that define the severity of the disease (age, gender, platelet count, neutrophil count and reticulocyte 
count). This allowed for a robust comparison to historical control, accounting for the most likely 
prognostic factors.  
Figure 3-3 
Selection of historical control studies 
Assessment report

Note: Tisdale et al. was published in 2000 but, since it was mentioned in the protocol and it met the other 
selection criteria, it was added to the pool of historical studies. 
In summary, Novartis is of the opinion that despite the lack of a comparator in the pivotal trial, the robust 
comparison to rigorously selected matched historical control data from the same institution, the NIH, has 
greatly compensated for the lack of a control arm in study AUS01T. 
AUS01T study results compare favourably to expanded pool of historical 
studies 
While Novartis remains of the opinion that all similarities noted between the AUS01T study and the 
historical controls contribute to the validity of the historical control to reduce bias, Novartis understands 
the Agency’s concern raised during the OE on the lack of variability in the pool of historical controls 
considering that all were conducted at the same institution as AUS01T, which would affect the 
generalizability of the findings to other sites and countries. 
To address this concern, Novartis relaxed the selection criteria of historical studies to allow inclusion of 
studies from other sites and countries and conducted sensitivity analyses comparing the results from 
AUS01T to those from different sets of studies. 
Historical studies published at any time, either prospective or retrospective, were selected if they met the 
following criteria: 
1.  IST-naïve patients included in the trial 
2.  Treatment with: 
a.  IST consisting of h-ATG or h-ALG (Lymphoglobulin) + CsA for at least one arm, regardless 
of the doses and durations 
b.  Additional treatment(s) on top of h-ATG/h-ALG + CsA were allowed (e.g., growth factors, 
other immunosuppressive agents) 
3.  Definition of complete and/or overall responses based on the same parameters irrespective of the 
threshold considered  
4.  CR rate and/or OR rate at Month 6 or best CR rate and/or OR rate within 6 months or longer, 
reported.

The resulting historical studies have the following features: 
•  All studies enrolled IST-naive SAA patients, commonly defined based on Camitta criteria (Camitta 
et al. 1975), similar to AUS01T study; 
•  All studies used either h-ATG (ATGAM) at a dose of 40 mg/kg/day for 4 days or h-ALG 
(Lymphoglobulin) at a dose of 12 to 15 mg/kg/day for 5 days, similar to AUS01T study (assuming 
that h-ATG and h-ALG are interchangeable); 
•  All studies used CsA for at least 6 months with one exception (study Teramura 2007) with 
variable starting dose that was adjusted based on cyclosporine concentrations targeting a 
therapeutic range of 100 to 400 ng/µL, similar to AUS01T study; 
• 
In some studies, growth factors (G-CSF, EPO), or other immunosuppressive agents (MMF, 
sirolimus, etc.) were given on top of h-ATG/ h-ALG + CsA. 
•  CR definition was either similar to the one used in AUS01T study or more stringent; 
•  PR definition was similar or comparable to the one used in AUS01T study;

•  Either the response at Month 6 or the best response within 6 months was reported, except in 
Bacigalupo 2000 where the timeframe for the best response was not defined.  
Several sensitivity analyses for both CR and OR rates, using random effects meta-analyses (due to high 
heterogeneity between studies), were performed with the following subsets of studies:  
1.  All historical studies reporting the response rate at Month 6 and using h-ATG + CsA only. 
2.  All historical studies reporting the response rate at Month 6 and using h-ATG or h-ALG + CsA 
only. 
3.  All historical studies which used h-ATG or h-ALG + CsA only, i.e., with no additional treatment 
such as growth factors or other immunosuppressive agents and reporting either the response at 
Month 6 or the best response over time (usually by Month 6); 
4.  All historical studies; 
Of note, studies with more than one treatment arm using h-ATG or h-ALG + CsA, with and without other 
treatments, were analysed separately for each arm.  
The CR rate for all historical studies is displayed in Figure 3-4 which shows a high heterogeneity between 
studies reflecting the heterogeneity of the definitions of CR across studies. In most of the studies, the CR 
rate ranged between 10 and 30%, however, some studies reported more extreme results as outlined 
below: 
Two historical studies showed higher than expected CR rates: 
•  Bacigalupo et al. 2000 reported only the CR rate (48%) after one or more courses of h-ATG + CsA + 
G-CSF. The CR rate after one course of this treatment was not reported and likely much lower, 
considering that the OR rate after only one course was 50% as compared to 77% after one or more 
courses.  
•  Zheng et al. 2006 reported a CR rate of 60% in patients treated with h-ALG+CsA and the same 60% 
in those treated with h-ALG+CsA+G-CSG+EPO. The publication did not provide an explanation for this 
unprecedented finding. Such CR rate was never observed in other studies using h-ALG + CsA only.  
In contrast, the below historical studies showed very low CR rates: 
•  Scheinberg et al. 2009 reported a CR rate of 0% in patients treated with h-ATG+CsA+sirolimus. In 
contrast, patients treated with h-ATG+CsA alone had a CR rate of 12%; 
• 
Peffault de Latour et al. 2018 reported a CR rate of 2.8% which may be explained by the more 
stringent definition of CR (normal Hb for age, ANC > 1.5x109/L and PLT > 150x109/L); 
•  Afable et al. 2011 reported a CR rate of 6% in patients treated with h-ATG+CsA only, but the 
definition of CR was not provided. The publication did not provide an explanation for this low CR rate; 
• 
Teramura et al. 2007 reported a CR rate of 6.4% in patients treated with h-ALG + CsA and 4.2% in 
those treated with h-ALG + CsA + G-CSF. The CR definition is slightly more stringent than NIH 
definition;

In conclusion, in the AUS01T study, the addition of eltrombopag to h-ATG + CsA increased the CR rate at 
Month 6 by at least 25 percentage points as compared to historically reported CR rate with IST alone or 
the combination of IST and growth factors, further confirming that eltrombopag when added to IST led to 
a significant improvement in haematological response. 
Clinical significance of the haematological response – reduction in 
transfusion burden  
The improvement in haematological response, especially achieving a complete response is a surrogate for 
reduction in morbidities usually due to bleeding events and infections in SAA (Rosenfeld et al. 2003). 
Although achieving a complete response should also per definition translate into reduction in transfusions, 
Novartis agrees with the Agency that a correlation between the haematological response and reduction in 
transfusion burden should be demonstrated. Therefore, following the requests from the Agency, we 
collected retrospectively all available transfusion data from patients in Cohort 3+ Extension from the NIH 
blood bank and referral sites. 
Based on all collected transfusion data, patients in study AUS01T who achieved haematological 
responses, demonstrated a substantial reduction in transfusion needs, and as expected, those who 
achieved complete responses had the best outcome in terms of reduction in transfusion burden and 
durability of response. This is highly relevant for SAA patients as it clearly correlates the improvement in 
the haematological response with clinical benefit and better quality of life, considering that these patients 
were heavily transfused at baseline (by study Day 1) and in the first months until they responded, of 
either platelets, package red blood cells (pRBC) or both. This can be appreciated from Figure 3-6 that 
displays individual patients’ status and associated transfusion needs and shows that: non-responders 
continued to be heavily transfused, whereas partial responders required none or much less transfusions, 
and complete responders no longer required transfusions. This figure also shows that complete 
responders maintained their response much longer than partial responders as demonstrated by less or 
later relapses in patients with CRs versus PRs.

Further to the above, it was also observed that patients who achieved the best responses showed 
increases in transfusion-free intervals and increased duration of response:  
In Cohort 3 + Extension, the median platelet transfusion-free interval prior to Month 6 response 
assessment, defined as the time from the date of the most recent platelet transfusion prior to Month 6 
assessment to the date of Month 6 response assessment, was 164 days, 145 days and 6 days in CR, PR 
and non-responder (NR) patients, respectively (see [HAQ Table 14.3-1.13r]). Similarly, the pRBC 
transfusion-free interval prior to Month 6 response assessment was 159.5 days, 114 days and 7.5 days in 
CR, PR and NR patients, respectively (see [HAQ Table 14.3-1.14r]).  
To emphasize the association between the quality of response and transfusion requirement, the 
transfusion-free interval was categorized and displayed in Figure 3-7 below.  
Figure 3-7 
Transfusion-free interval prior to Month 6 response 
In summary, the above confirms that improving the quality of the haematological response in AUS01T, 
clearly correlated with less transfusions, longer transfusion-free intervals, less or delayed relapses 
translating into no or shorter exposure to morbidities, all confirming the clinical benefit and an 
improvement in quality of life derived from the achievement of complete response. 
Contribution of eltrombopag added to IST to long-term effect 
The comparison to historical control studies demonstrated that the addition of eltrombopag to IST 
significantly increased the CR rate at Month 6 as compared to what was historically reported with IST 
alone (see Figure 3-2). Novartis would like to emphasise that the use of eltrombopag concurrently with 
CsA and h-ATG in the AUS01T study was during the first 6 months of treatment, followed by lower 
maintenance dose of CsA alone in responders for 18 months, i.e., until Month 24, to support the 
maintenance of the responses achieved at 6 months and to reduce the number of relapses. The 
comparison of haematological response observed in AUS01T versus historical control was done at Month 6 
before the start of CsA maintenance dose and is therefore not affected by the latter.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620491/2019 
Page 145/162 
 
  
  
 
 
The maintenance of response is not solely due to CsA maintenance dose. By improving the CR rate, 
eltrombopag when added to IST also contributes to the maintenance of the response. Indeed, as shown 
in Figure 3-8, the duration of response in patients from Cohort 3+ Ext, all treated with CsA maintenance 
dose, who achieved a CR is longer compared to patients who achieved a PR, indicating that the quality of 
response, to which eltrombopag contributed substantially, is associated with better long-term outcome.  
Figure 3-8 
Cohort 3 + Extension 
Kaplan-Meir plot of duration of response by the quality of response at Month 6 in 
To further address the Agency`s concern on the long-term benefit of adding eltrombopag to IST, Novartis 
would like to clarify that there were indeed 6 patients who did not receive CsA maintenance dose (#006, 
012 and 024 in Cohort 1 and #038, #043 and #045 in Cohort 2 and improved their response from PR at 
Month 6 to CR later without any treatment, indicating the restoration of haematopoiesis may take longer 
in some patients. This effect is likely due to eltrombopag combined with IST during the first 6 months of 
treatment and not a function of CsA maintenance alone. 
In summary, the addition of eltrombopag to IST contributed to: 
• 
• 
The improvement of the robustness of response (higher CR rate) which correlated with longer 
relapse-free survival (26% higher in CR patients than PR patients at 18 months); 
The increase of the number of responders (higher OR rate) who could benefit from CsA maintenance 
dose; 
In conclusion, Novartis believes that the above clearly demonstrates that eltrombopag when added to CsA 
and h-ATG lead to a robust and clinically significant response and to the maintenance of response beyond 
Month 6.

Safety profile of eltrombopag in first-line SAA is in line with the known safety 
in other indications  
Eltrombopag has a well-established safety profile in the approved ITP (adult and paediatric), HCV and 
refractory SAA indications, supported by almost 10 years of post-marketing data since its initial approval 
in the EU in 2010.  
In study AUS01T, the safety and tolerability of eltrombopag when added to IST (h-ATG+CsA) in 
treatment-naïve SAA patients was acceptable with no new or unexpected safety signals. The safety profile 
of eltrombopag was consistent with the expected safety profile in patients with SAA and the established 
safety profile in the approved ITP, HCV and refractory SAA indications. 
As of the 28-Feb-2018 cut-off date, the overall median (min-max) follow-up extended to 61, 47, 33 and 
22 months in Cohort 1, 2, 3 and combined Cohort 3 + Extension, respectively. Seven deaths have been 
reported in the study and none was considered related to study treatment by the investigators. Amongst 
the seven reported deaths, three were reported in Cohort 3 + Extension leading to a probability of 
survival at two years of 96%.  
There was no on-treatment fatal infection or bleeding and only two cases of grade 4 infection (sepsis in 
Cohort 2 and sinusitis in Cohort 3) and no grade 4 bleeding event).  
Treatment discontinuation in the study was also relatively low and none was due to hepatotoxicity in any 
of the 153 treated patients. As of the 28-Feb-2018 cut-off date, five patients discontinued the treatment 
due to safety reasons: four due to rash and one due to colitis.  
No events of recurrence of thrombocytopenia, bone marrow fibrosis, or haematologic malignancies were 
reported. Renal events, thromboembolic events and bleeding events were rare in all cohorts.  
Cytogenetic abnormalities, including clonal evolution occurred in 15 of 153 (10%) patients, which is lower 
than the range (14% to 20%) that is expected with IST alone at two years after the initiation of 
treatment. This is also lower than what was reported in the literature for eltrombopag in the refractory 
setting overall, further supporting that an early and robust response correlates with fewer risks and thus 
better outcome (Townsley et al 2017, Maciejewski et al 2002, Scheinberg et al 2012, Scheinberg et al 
2011, Winkler et al. 2019). 
In conclusion, eltrombopag when added to IST for the first-line treatment of SAA is well tolerated and 
with a safety profile in line with the known safety in the other approved indications. This, in addition to 
the outstanding treatment effect observed by adding eltrombopag to IST, supports a positive benefit-risk 
for eltrombopag in combination with standard IST for the first-line treatment of SAA. 
With the initial variation application, Novartis proposed to include the paediatric population aged 2 years 
and above in the indication, however, following the concerns raised by the Agency on the limited number 
of complete responders among patients below the age of 12 enrolled in the study, Novartis agreed to limit 
the indication to paediatric patients 12-17 years of age as justified below. 
Novartis would like to highlight that despite the rarity of SAA, 37 paediatric patients were enrolled in 
study AUS01T, including 26 in Cohort 3 + Extension, of whom 25 were evaluable for efficacy (1, 11 and 
13 patients in 2-5 year, 6-11 year and 12-17 year age groups, respectively). In the younger age groups 
(<12 years), 8% (1/12) patients achieved a CR at Month 6. In the 12-17 year age group, 46% (6/13) 
were complete responders, in line with the overall CR rate in Cohort 3 + Extension (43.7%), and similar 
to the 50% CR rate observed in adults (31/62). This CR rate (46%) compares favourably with the 
historically reported CR rate of 25% in this age group as shown in Table 3-5, despite a higher proportion 
of vSAA in study AUS01T study as compared to the two Scheinberg studies (Scheinberg et al. 2009, 
Scheinberg et al. 2011) (6/13 vs. 4/12, respectively).

Furthermore, several paediatric patients (two, two and three patients in 2-5 year, 6-11 year and 12-17 
year age groups, respectively) who were PR at Month 6, improved to CR later.  
Excluding paediatric patients <12 years of age, the overall CR rate reached 49.3% (37/75) in study 
Cohort 3 + Extension, comparing even more favourably to historical control formed by the two 
Scheinberg studies (Scheinberg et al. 2009, Scheinberg et al. 2011) (after excluding patients <12 years 
of age) and Tisdale et al. 2000 which enrolled only adults, reporting a pooled CR rate of 17.1% (using the 
fixed effects model). The improvement in CR rate represented 32.2% (95% confidence interval (CI): 
[18.9%, 45.6%]) (see Table 3-6).

In conclusion, Novartis considers that the CR rates observed in patients 12-17 years of age in study 
AUS01T as compared to historical controls, justify the inclusion of this age group in this indication.  
Novartis’ proposed post-approval commitments  
Novartis would like to further share with the Agency that based on the results from the AUS01T study, 
eltrombopag in combination with IST has been approved for the first-line treatment of adult and 
paediatric SAA patients in several countries as shown in Table 3-7 below:

Furthermore and as confirmed by the clinical community, clinical practice in the first-line treatment of 
SAA has changed and eltrombopag added to IST is evolving as the global standard of care.  
For the above reasons, a new randomised trial comparing eltrombopag added to IST versus IST alone, 
would be very difficult to conduct. 
Novartis engaged discussions with the EBMT in order to share the early results from the ongoing 
randomised trial RACE, whenever available during the re-examination process of the present application. 
Although the regimen used in RACE differs from the AUS01T, Novartis agrees that the results from the 
RACE trial can be used as supportive of the AUS01T findings to confirm the positive treatment effect of 
adding eltrombopag to standard IST. 
As a reminder, the RACE study is sponsored by the EBMT with Novartis and Pfizer as collaborators. 
Novartis is not involved in the conduct of the study and does not have access to patient level data and 
will therefore only be able to provide to the EMA the data as generated by EBMT. The final study report 
(24 months analysis) is planned to be available at the earliest in Q4 2021, which, in addition to the early 
results, will also be shared with the Agency once available to Novartis.  
In addition to the above and based on the assessment from the Agency of the re-examination request, 
Novartis is open for further discussions with the Agency on potential post-approval commitment, as 
applicable.   
Novartis’ conclusion 
Eltrombopag had already demonstrated significant activity in heavily pre-treated refractory SAA patients; 
as single agent, eltrombopag led to robust results with 40% (17/43) of patients achieving haematologic 
response, some of which were multi-lineage leading to transfusion independence (Olnes et al. 2012). 
These results supported the approval of eltrombopag in patients with SAA who have had an insufficient 
response to immunosuppressive therapy. 
The results of the AUS01T pivotal study in first-line SAA patients have confirmed a positive benefit-risk 
ratio when adding eltrombopag to IST demonstrating an early and robust CR rate approximately 27% 
higher than historical data of IST alone. This was further confirmed by the improvement in CR in AUS01T 
as compared to the broader pool of historical controls. 
The safety profile of eltrombopag is well characterised in a much larger patient population in the 
approved indications: ITP, HCV-associated thrombocytopenia and refractory SAA and there are no new 
emerging safety signals from the AUS01T study.   
Novartis has demonstrated that the AUS01T study was well conducted by experts in the field, in a rare 
disease, and that the significant improvement in efficacy observed by adding eltrombopag to IST as 
compared to the established efficacy of historical control of IST alone, outweigh the lack of a comparator 
raised as an uncertainty by the Agency to demonstrate the positive benefit-risk of eltrombopag in the 
first-line treatment of SAA. 
Novartis concludes that the unprecedented treatment benefit combined with the acceptable safety profile 
of eltrombopag in combination with IST (h-ATG + CsA) demonstrated in study AUS01T   a positive 
benefit-risk for its intended use as first-line treatment in patients aged 12 years and older with SAA.

expert Group inviting the experts to provide their views on the CHMP grounds for refusal, taking into 
account the applicant’s response.  
The expert group were asked to comment on the CHMP grounds for refusal: 
• 
The efficacy and safety data of eltrombopag on top of standard of care as first line treatment of 
patients with severe aplastic anemia has not been sufficiently demonstrated. The submitted data, 
based on study NIH AUS01T, do not allow a reliable and valid assessment of the benefit of 
Revolade when added to the standard of care (SOC) due to the lack of a robust comparison 
against established treatment. The indirect comparison with historical data cannot overcome this 
deficiency.  
Therefore,  it  is  not  possible  to  establish  a  positive  benefit  risk  balance  for  Revolade  in  the  proposed 
indication. 
Response: Some members of the expert group agreed that the benefit of eltrombopag used in 
combination with antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine in adult patients with SAA has been established 
on the basis of the available evidence from study NIH AUS01T and indirect comparisons with historical 
data. Given the high level of activity observed, the methodological weaknesses of indirect comparisons 
were not considered critical. 
Others disagreed and considered that the available data are promising but hypothesis-generating only 
due to the methodological weaknesses of single-arm combination design and the indirect comparisons. 
According to this view, the benefits even in the adult population were not considered established in the 
absence of a confirmatory study. 
All members agreed that the benefits have not been established in children and adolescents due to 
apparent lack of a relevant clinical effect in study NIH AUS01T, although numbers were small. Adequate 
evidence of benefit in this population should be available, at least from an externally controlled trial 
looking at response rate, before extrapolation on the basis of PK/PD data can be considered. It should be 
noted that based on the exclusion criteria, the ongoing RACE study will likely not provide useful 
information to address efficacy and safety in children and adolescents. 
Lastly, the experts agreed that there is a significant risk of clonal evolution that needs to be characterised 
on the basis of long-term safety data (current follow-up is only about 2 years). Such data should ideally 
be collected systematically using a disease registry and sensitive techniques (e.g., NGS). A registry could 
also help to address the many existing optimisation questions and further confirm the benefits in the real-
life setting (e.g., start of treatment). 
In addition, the following questions are raised to the ad hoc group in view of the grounds for 
re-examination: 
1.  Could the experts comment on the overall strength of evidence, including but not limited 
to: 
a.   Can the standard of care for SAA patients be considered comparable between 
the pivotal trial AUS01T and the historical control trials (Rosenfeld et al 2003, 
Scheinberg et al 2009 and Scheinberg et al 2011)? 
The  standard  of  care  for  SAA  is  generally  the  same  in  terms  of  main  therapeutic 
approaches  including  antithymocyte  globulin  (h-ATG),  cyclosporine,  and  stem  cell 
transplantation (see also relevant European guidelines and references). However, clinical 
practices and guidelines vary in terms of which treatment strategy is used when between 
regions and often even within regions and different hospitals. Therefore, for some experts, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620491/2019 
Page 150/162 
 
  
  
 
the different practices add to the uncertainties of indirect comparisons of small series from 
single institutions. 
b.   Do the experts consider the definition of CR in SAA as standardized such that CR 
rates in SAA in clinical practice can be compared to the CR rates of historical 
controls proposed by the applicant? 
The  criteria  for  adjudicating  partial  or  "complete"  response  across  studies  are  often 
slightly  different  but  the  differences  are  of  negligible  clinical  importance.  Response  and 
other  clinical  outcomes  (e.g.,  transfusion  independence,  normal  function)  are  generally 
clinically  important  regardless  of  the  precise  definition.  However,  where  the  primary 
outcome is  defined  by  CR,  the  variable  criteria  may impact on the  reported  success  of  a 
therapy.  Thus,  small  changes  in  adjudication  criteria  may  add  significant  uncertainty  to 
the historical comparisons presented.  
c.   Is the standard of care (including supportive care such as e.g. use of G-CSF and 
antimicrobials) for SAA patients comparable across regions (US and EU)? 
There  is  no  single  internationally  agreed  standard  of  care  (see  answer  to  question  1a), 
and this applies to supportive care as well. The standards in terms of supportive care are 
expected  to  be  very  heterogeneous  and  likely  vary  from  hospital  to  hospital.  However, 
these  variations  are  not  expected  to  add  significant  uncertainties  to  the  historical 
comparisons presented. 
d.   Are observed effects (in terms of CR, transfusion requirements for platelets and 
red blood cells, supportive treatments, hospitalisation and quality of life) in the 
pivotal study of clinical relevance?  
Response  and  other  clinical  outcomes  are  generally  clinically  important  regardless  of  the 
precise  definition.  The observed  effects,  if  associated  to  the  product  (an  association  that 
some  experts  considered  unproven),  were  considered  clinically  relevant.  The  experts 
noted that Quality of Life data were missing. 
e.   Do the experts agree that reaching complete response (and/or overall 
response) can be considered as a prognostic factor/ surrogate for a favourable 
long-term outcome? 
The  experts  agreed  that  failure  to  respond  is  associated  with  very  poor  outcome  in  the 
absence  of  rescue  treatments  and  response  is  associated  with  improvement  in  survival. 
Therefore,  the  outcomes  studied  showing  improvement  in  complete  response  and/or 
overall response are considered clinically important. 
f.    Is the safety profile of the proposed treatment regimen acceptable for the 
intended patient population? 
The  safety  profile  of  the  proposed  treatment  regimen  appears  to  be  acceptable  in  the 
short  term.  However,  long-term  data  (e.g.,  15  years  of  follow-up)  are  needed  to  assess 
the risk of clonal evolution.  
2.  As younger age predicts a more favourable outcome of IST, the experts are asked if the 
demographics of the AUS01T population  (median age 26.5 years;  in cohort 3+extension 
29% were <18, 55% were 18-64 and 16% were ≥65 years of age) can be considered 
representative for SAA patients seen in the clinical setting. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620491/2019 
Page 151/162 
 
  
  
 
The population included based on median age was slightly younger than expected. However, given 
that the effect appeared to be lower in younger patients, there are no concerns about selection bias 
in terms of a younger population. 
Furthermore, despite the slightly younger population, there are no concerns in terms of 
generalisability to the target indication. 
3.  Could results from RACE add substantial information to support an extension of 
indication? 
From the point of the design of the study, given the randomized add-on design, the RACE study 
(given sufficient follow-up for safety) is expected to be able to provide a direct estimate of the 
efficacy and safety of eltrombopag used in combination with antithymocyte globulin and 
cyclosporine compared to antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine, in the adult population. 
4.  Do the experts share the view of the applicant that the use of eltrombopag in SAA has 
shifted to first line in clinical practise already? What impact will the claimed 
improvement in clinical efficacy of first line eltrombopag + IST have on the only curative 
treatment (i.e. allogeneic stem cell transplantation) in SAA? 
Although practices including off-label use vary, currently there is no widespread off-label use of 
eltrombopag in first-line treatment due to various reasons, e.g. access (including pricing and 
reimbursement).  
There is no concern that a potential change in practice would hinder or somehow shift the practice 
against stem-cell transplantation, which, if possible, remains the only curative option. However, it 
is important that eltrombopag treatment is initiated by haematologists expert in the management 
of SAA. 
5.  What is the experts´ view on extrapolation from adults to the paediatric population, and 
specifically on the inclusion of adolescents from 12-17 years (n=13), children from 6-11 
years (n=11) and infants aged 2-5 years (n=1) in the indication?  
All members agreed that the benefits have not been established in children and adolescents due to 
apparent lack of a relevant clinical effect in study NIH AUS01T. Adequate evidence of benefit in this 
population should be available, at least from an externally controlled trial looking at response rate, 
before extrapolation on the basis of PK/PD data can be considered.  
Discussion and overall conclusion on grounds for re-examination  
The CHMP assessed all the detailed grounds for re-examination and argumentations presented by the 
applicant and considered the views of the ad hoc expert group.  The CHMP assessment of the key points 
discussed in the detailed grounds for re-examination submitted is summarised as follows: 
• 
Unmet medical need for SAA patients remains high despite IST treatment and with no drug 
currently approved in EU for this disease 
The MAH stresses the unmet medical need in the treatment of SAA and the importance of increasing the 
speed and quality of haematologic recovery for treatment-naïve patients with SAA. This is acknowledged 
since only about one third of patients are suitable for HSCT and not all patients respond to IST (h-AST 
and CsA), the present standard of care for transplant ineligible patients. Availability of a treatment 
reducing the overall burden of disease (e.g. reducing transfusion needs or lowering the impact of IST) 
would be of special interest to health care professionals and patients. However, the unmet medical need 
Assessment report

Page 152/162 
 
  
  
 
 
has not been part of the grounds for refusal; the grounds are mainly addressing the efficacy and safety of 
eltrombopag in the proposed first line of treatment/new treatment regimen. 
In conclusion, this key point does not resolve the existing grounds for refusal. 
• 
The current standard of care in SAA is shifting worldwide to use eltrombopag in combination with 
IST for the first-line treatment of SAA   
Scientific literature indeed points to an effect of eltrombopag not only on megakaryocyte stimulation and 
platelet production, but also in stem cell proliferation and maintenance. Yet again, the therapeutic 
rationale was not refuted in the original procedure and it is not regarded as part of the CHMP´s ground 
for refusal; it remains the applicant’s choice to select and investigate a treatment regimen and the 
applicant’s responsibility to provide robust data to substantiate the intended label claim. 
• 
Significant and robust improvement in CR rate observed in a well-designed study AUS01T by the 
NIH, as compared to matched historical controls; and the responses in AUS01T (CR and OR) also 
compare favourably to a broader pool of historical trials conducted worldwide, which supports the 
generalizability of AUS01T findings 
The MAH argued to have provided “compelling results from a well conducted study” referring to the 
pivotal trial AUS01T, which was the basis of the initial type II variation submission. 
However, as outlined throughout several RSI´s in the initial procedure and in the grounds for refusal, the 
major drawback of study AUS01T is the non-controlled, non-randomized combination study design that 
results in major uncertainties on the reliability of the interpretation of the study results. Direct 
comparison of the results obtained in AUS01T with responses to first line immunosuppressive (IS) 
treatment is not possible. The claimed difference in CR at 6 months compared with historically reported 
CR rates with IST cannot be robustly established, due to the heterogeneity of CR rates reported in the 
literature. 
Study AUS01T was an uncontrolled study and study outcomes were compared with historical data to 
provide a reference range for the efficacy and safety endpoints. The MAH reports the rationale and 
procedure behind the selection of studies deemed suitable as historical control.  
With regards to the selection of the historical controls; in the first attempt, the selection criteria were 
more stringent to assure comparability of treatment concerning the regimen, treatments, dose and 
duration of treatment, resulting in overall 4 studies that could be compared to the study outcomes of 
study AUS01T.  
The selection criteria were as follows: 
1. IST-naïve patients included in the trial 
2. IST consisting of h-ATG+CsA for at least one arm 
3. Definition of complete and/or overall responses based on the same criteria as in AUS01T and 
response rate at Month 6 reported 
4. IST regimen comparable to AUS01T in terms of drugs doses and durations 
From this comparison, it appeared that the rate of the observed complete, partial and overall 
haematological responses might indeed support a claim towards increased efficacy. However, several 
uncertainties apply: The selected 4 trials were all conducted by the NIH (National Institutes of Health), 
which is incidentally also the sponsor of AUS01T, the pivotal trial for this application. This hampers the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620491/2019 
Page 153/162 
 
  
  
 
 
 
external validity of the overall comparison. Further, a selection bias cannot be ruled out, e.g. that only 
SAA patients with a high probability of achieving a response might have been asked to participate in the 
trial. This notion is supported by the fact that the age distribution of subjects in AUS01T differs 
significantly from that of comparable trials in a treatment naïve population (e.g. Assi, 2018). Thus, 
substantial doubt remains about the reliability of such a single centre comparison and the external 
validity of the obtained pivotal data. 
The applicant has recognized the lack of variability in the pool of historical controls as one major 
drawback and widened the selection criteria for study inclusion for additional analyses. 
The inclusion criteria here were as follows: 
1. IST-naïve patients included in the trial 
2. Treatment with: 
a. IST consisting of h-ATG or h-ALG (Lymphoglobulin) + CsA for at least one arm, regardless of the 
doses and durations 
b. Additional treatment(s) on top of h-ATG/h-ALG + CsA were allowed (e.g., growth factors, other 
immunosuppressive agents) 
3. Definition of complete and/or overall responses based on the same parameters irrespective of the 
threshold considered  
4. CR rate and/or OR rate at Month 6 or best CR rate and/or OR rate within 6 months or longer, reported. 
Under these widened criteria, 13 publications including studies from other sites and countries on top of 
the initially selected 4 trials were applicable for inclusion.  
The MAH conducted additional analyses for both CR and OR rates, using random effects meta-analyses 
due to high heterogeneity between studies. This approach is methodologically appropriate to address the 
situation and results seem to be comparable to the analysis of the initial 4 studies. However, the widening 
of the inclusion criteria introduced large heterogeneity of the responses rates. This fully reflects the 
CHMP´s concern raised in the grounds for refusal on the comparison to historical data, i.e. that 
differences in the characteristics/risk factors of the study populations and in the setup of the studies, 
unknown or known (such as variations in doses and treatments for IST and slight differences in the 
definition/timing of the primary endpoint), make indirect comparisons very unreliable.  
In this respect, it does not help that study AUS01T compares favourably against the mean of a set of 
historical trials in the comparisons presented by the MAH. Rather than how AUS01T compares against the 
mean of other trials, the key question is, in which region the response rate of the patients included in 
AUS01T would lie without add-on eltrombopag treatment. This, however, is difficult to conclude on, as the 
range of CR in historical studies is extremely wide.  
As can be seen from Figure 3-4 for the historical studies included, the rate for CR ranged between 3% 
and 60%, with most studies showing a CR rate between 10% to 30%. However, some important sources, 
e.g. the rather large number of EBMT patients/data reported by Bacigalupo, showing higher response 
rates, should not be ignored. Therefore, it remains difficult to define where exactly the threshold for a 
meaningful comparison should be set, considering the heterogeneity of the CR rates reported in these 
studies (3%-60%). This is however deemed essential in order to conclude that the observed response 
rates are indeed compelling.  
Despite the fact that the widened inclusion criteria indeed provided more studies for comparison, the 
trends observed pointing towards efficacy in these sensitivity analyses need to be kept in perspective. 
The additional studies could not solve the major drawback of uncontrolled data per se, but rather 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620491/2019 
Page 154/162 
 
  
  
 
introduced more heterogeneity, instead of rendering a comparison less difficult. The analyses conducted 
still do not outweigh the necessity for a valid internal comparator demonstrating superior efficacy of the 
new treatment regimen compared to current standard of treatment with IST. Compelling evidence of 
superior benefit is necessary to avoid an increased treatment burden in an already highly vulnerable and 
heavily treated patient population. Additionally, eltrombopag is used as an effective rescue treatment in 
relapsed and resistant patients and it is not clear if first line use will blunt the response to subsequent 
rescue treatment.  
Overall, no significant new information changing the grounds for refusal has been provided that could 
overcome the uncertainty whether historical data could compensate for the lack of a comparative study 
(eltrombopag + IST versus IST alone). Therefore, the concern raised in the grounds for refusal on the 
lack of robustness and the indirect comparison remains. 
Another open question was the uncertainty with regard to the contribution of eltrombopag to the duration 
of the haematological response. In cohort 3 of the AUS01T study, the treatment regimen intended for 
marketing authorization (eltrombopag + IST for 6 months) was administered. But after the initial 6 
months of treatment, a maintenance dose of CsA was introduced for 24 months; it was not entirely clear 
whether/how much eltrombopag contributed to the overall long-term effect in terms of response and 
relapse rates. 
The MAH concludes that the long-term responses are “likely due to eltrombopag combined with IST 
during the first 6 months of treatment and not a function of CsA maintenance alone”. The rationale for 
this statement seems largely based on 6 patients, who did not receive CsA maintenance but still improved 
to CR at a later time point. However, if this long-term positive effect is actually based on the addition of 
eltrombopag or the standard IST alone remains unclear, especially considering the very limited sample 
size of 6 patients showing improvements beyond 6 months. Furthermore, 3 of these patients were from 
cohort 1, receiving eltrombopag from D14 to 6 months, and 3 from cohort 2, receiving eltrombopag only 
from D14 to month 3. Additionally, the provided argumentation does not answer questions regarding the 
relapse rates, which are also of high interest for long-term outcomes. 
In conclusion, the responses to these key points do not resolve the existing grounds for refusal. 
• 
Safety profile of eltrombopag in first-line SAA is in line with the known safety profile in the other 
approved indications, with no new safety signals identified  
The CHMP considered that the grounds for refusal outlined in section 4 cover mainly the lack of a valid 
internal comparator in the pivotal study AUS01T. Interpretation of study results is thus hampered and 
major uncertainties on the reliability of the obtained efficacy and safety data question the role of 
eltrombopag in first-line therapy of SAA patients. 
The MAH elaborates on the safety profile of eltrombopag when added on top of first line IST. This was 
part of the grounds of refusal since a major uncertainty existed in the initial submission whether 
unfavourable effects may be introduced if eltrombopag is added on top of IST. 
The MAH reconfirms that from the data set available no new safety signals became apparent, with a well-
known safety profile of eltrombopag and the standard immunosuppressive therapy (IST) treatment 
regimens (h-ATG and CsA). Overall, bleeding events and thromboembolic events seem to be rare in all 3 
cohorts in study AUS01T. Seven deaths occurred, but were considered unrelated to study medication. No 
events of recurrent thrombocytopenia, bone marrow fibrosis or hematologic malignancies were reported. 
These findings indicate that the safety profile observed in study AUS01T is consistent with the expected 
safety profile for subjects with SAA.

However, uncertainty remains regarding the risk of emergence of clonal evolution, a serious complication 
of aplastic anaemia. Although clonal cytogenetic evolution does not seem to be higher in study AUS01T 
compared with historical data (in fact even lower than the reported values for the treatment with IST 
alone), it cannot be ruled out yet that eltrombopag as a component of the triple therapy (h-ATG + CsA + 
eltrombopag) may contribute to or enhance clonal aberrations. Studies AUS28T and Study AUS18T 
provide supportive data on the development of cytogenetic abnormalities for eltrombopag alone, but not 
for the on top treatment regimen. Recent literature raises concern of a possible link between eltrombopag 
in addition to IST treatment and cytogenetic clonal evolution (Winkler et al. 2019). rSAA subjects were 
treated in 2 consecutive eltrombopag studies. Clonal evolution was almost always an early event: 13 
(87%) of 15 occurred within 6 months of EPAG initiation, including all with chromosome 7 abnormalities. 
The authors conclude that the striking kinetics of these events in relation to EPAG treatment may suggest 
a direct link.  
Conclusion 
In the provided discussion, the MAH addresses several aspects, such as a justification for the selected 
treatment regimen of eltrombopag on top of standard IST and the unmet medical need in the treatment 
of SAA. The reduction of the transfusion burden as a clinical readout of the haematological response is 
also discussed. However, these issues are not primarily part of the grounds for refusal and the discussion 
provided is regarded only as supportive.  
Following the concerns raised in the course of the initial type II assessment procedure, the MAH in the re-
examination limited the indication regarding paediatric patients to an age of 12-17 years. SAA mainly 
peaks in patients aged 15 to 25 years old and those over 60. Data generated so far seem to indicate 
favourable response rates in children aged 12 years and above. If the uncertainties, which are part of the 
grounds for refusal and currently question the role of eltrombopag as first line therapy on top of standard 
IST, are resolved, a label for the paediatric subpopulation aged 12-17 years may be considered. 
The major and crucial concern remains the lack of a valid internal comparator to establish superior 
efficacy of the new treatment regimen compared with the current standard of treatment, IST. In this 
context, the applicant carried out additional analyses with widened inclusion criteria in order to provide 
more studies for comparison serving as historical control. Under these widened criteria, it is 
acknowledged that trends are observed indicating efficacy of the tested triple regimen. However, this 
approach did not solve the major drawback of uncontrolled data per se, but rather introduced 
heterogeneity for the comparison to be made against a wide range of historical response rates.  
Overall, the historical data presented are insufficient to compensate for the lack of a comparative study 
(eltrombopag + IST versus IST alone).  
As for the safety,the major uncertainty with regard to the risk of emergence of clonal aberrations, a 
serious complication of aplastic anaemia, remains. Recent literature raises the concern of a possible link 
between eltrombopag addition to IST treatment and cytogenetic clonal evolution in the refractory SAA 
setting (Winkler et al. 2019).  
In conclusion, the lack of a direct comparison versus the current standard of care IST, severely limits 
interpretation of the magnitude of clinical benefit. 
Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application was of the opinion that due to the 
concerns identified with this application, the risk management plan cannot be agreed at this stage.

6.  Benefit-risk balance 
Therapeutic Context 
Disease or condition 
The MAH initially applied for an extension of indication to include first line treatment of adult and 
paediatric patients aged 2 years and older with severe aplastic anaemia for Revolade in combination with 
standard immunosuppressive therapy.  During the procedure the MAH changed the proposed indication to 
adult and paediatric patients aged 12 years and above. 
Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The  only  curative 
treatment 
is  haematopoietic  stem  cell 
transplantation  (HSCT).  However, 
immunosuppressant  therapy  (IST)  with  ATG/CsA  has  changed  the  prognosis  of  the  disease  in  patients 
who are not candidates for HSCT. First line therapy is selected according to the age of the patient, which 
correlates with ability to tolerate HSCT, the severity of the disease and the availability of an appropriate 
donor (basically a fully HLA-matched family member). The treatment must balance the relative toxicities 
and long-term efficacy of the therapies, which differ over time (i.e. higher up-front mortality but greater 
chance of cure with HSCT), and according to patient age. Published prospective long-term studies show 
that standard initial IST (horse ATG and CsA) achieve haematological recovery in 60-70% and excellent 
long-term  survival  among  responders.  The  medical  need  for  a  treatment  that  can  significantly  increase 
the  rate  of  responders  and  decrease  relapse  rate,  together  with  an  acceptable  safety  profile,  remains 
high, considering the severity of the disease, but also the overall burden associated with IST as current 
standard of care. 
Main clinical studies 
For  this  indication  no  specific  dose  finding  studies  for  adults  or  children  have  been  performed.  The 
proposed  dose  is  based  on  results  from  refractory  SAA  study  (AUS28T),  the  exposure  observed  for 
paediatric and adult ITP patients vs. paediatric SAA patients as well as the PK/PD results and the safety 
profile obtained from the AUS01T updated cut-off (28-Feb-2018). 
The  main  evidence  of  efficacy  of  eltrombopag  in  treatment-naïve  patients  with  SAA  comes  from  study 
AUS01T, a phase I/II, non-randomized, single-arm, single-centre study evaluating the efficacy and safety 
of  eltrombopag  treatment,  in  combination  with  the  regimen  of  h-ATG  and  CsA,  in  immunosuppressive 
therapy-naïve subjects with SAA. This study followed an adaptive design such as commonly used in phase 
I/II  single  arm  trials  to  assess  response  rate  at  an  interim  time  point  and  allow  early  termination  of  a 
cohort if efficacy is not shown. 
Complete response rate at Month 6 was the primary endpoint and it was defined as absolute neutrophil 
count >1×103/ μL, and platelet count >100×103/ μL, and  Hgb>10 g/dL. 
Overall,  the  pivotal  study  included  treatment-naïve  patients  with  SAA  who  were  in  principle  not 
candidates  for  HSCT.  In  total,  30  patients  were  included  in  cohort  1  and  31  in  cohort  2  and  3, 
respectively. In addition, the extension cohort was added to recruit more subjects with the same dosing 
regimen as Cohort 3, and collect more data for the analysis of the secondary endpoints within the target 
regimen.

Favourable effects 
Complete response (CR), the primary endpoint, was observed in 33.3%, 25.8% and 58.1% of subjects in 
cohort 1, cohort 2 and cohort 3, respectively (FAS  population) at month 6 of treatment. When cohort 3 
and  the  extension  cohort  were  pooled  (cut-off  28  Feb-2018),  CR  was  observed  in  43.7%  of  patients  at 
month 6.  
More than 75% of the whole population achieved an OR (PR or CR) at month 3 (76.7%, 77.4%, 87.1% 
and  79.6%,  for  Cohort  1,  2,  3  and  3+extension,  respectively)  and  improved  at  month  6  (80%,  87.1%, 
93.51%  and  84.8%,  for  Cohort  1,  2,  3  and  3+extension,  respectively).  Updated  results  were  provided 
with a cut-off of February 2018. The MAH concludes that eltrombopag has a durable effect since 50% of 
patients  achieved  a  complete  response  at  any  time,  and  83.1%  of  them  still  responded  at  month  18. 
Among the patients with overall response during the study (76.1%), 72.9% of patients still responded 18 
months later.  
Provided  comparisons  versus  historical  controls  seem  to  suggest  that the triple  combination  might  have 
better  efficacy  over  h-ATG+CsA  alone  in  terms  of  CR  at  month  6.  In  addition,  the  evaluation  of  the 
reported  haematological  response,  as  reported  for  re-examination,  seems  to  indicate  less  transfusions 
and longer transfusion free intervals hinting towards a clinical benefit for treatment responders, with even 
better results for patients achieving CR than PR. 
Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Study  AUS01T  is  a  small,  uncontrolled  phase  I/II  study,  in  which  93  patients  were  included  in3 
consecutive  cohorts.  Although  conducting  a  randomized  controlled  trial  in  this  clinical  setting  may  be 
challenging, performance of a controlled trial would have been crucial to assess the efficacy results in a 
robust way. In fact, a randomised study comparing hATG+CsA vs hATG+CsA+Eltrombopag for SAA (the 
RACE  study)  sponsored  by  European  Group  for  Blood  and  Marrow  Transplantation  (with  Novartis  and 
Pfizer as collaborators) is ongoing since 2014, thus showing that a comparative study to support the first 
line indication in SAA patients would have been feasible.  
The absence of a comparator is the main limitation for assessment of the additive effect of eltrombopag 
to  IST.  In  the  comparison  versus  historical  controls,  the  MAH  has  made  an  effort  to  match  patients  to 
assure comparability of the groups. However, using external comparators has important limitations since 
in  the  absence  of  randomisation  it  is  not  possible  to  control  all  prognostic  factors  and  unknown 
confounders that can have an impact on the results. This limitation also holds true for the enlarged pool 
of historical comparator studies in the scope of the analysis presented for re-examination. Less stringent 
criteria  for  study  inclusion  were  applied  in  order  to  extend  the  original  pool  of  four  studies  with  an 
additional  13  studies  from  other  sites  and  countries.  However,  the  trends  pointing  towards  efficacy  in 
these  sensitivity  analyses  need  to  be  kept  in  perspective:  this  approach  does  not  solve  the  major 
drawback of uncontrolled data per se, but rather confirms CHMP´s concern. The range of responses (CR 
rates) is very broad, reaching from 3% to 60%, and this heterogeneity makes a comparison very difficult 
and poses an additional uncertainty per se. 
The  maintenance  of  the  effect  beyond  6  months  is  not  demonstrated  as  a  decline  in  OR  is  observed  at 
month  12  for  patients  on  all  cohorts.  The  MAH  has  provided  updated  results  (cut-off  of  February  2018) 
showing that 83.1% of patients who achieved a CR at any time of the study and 72.9% of those with OR 
during the study still responded 18 months later, but it should be considered that patients did not receive 
eltrombopag beyond month 6 while they remained on CsA for the whole follow-up period. Therefore, the 
prolonged effect is likely to be related to the continuous administration of CsA.

Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of Revolade in the claimed indication is mainly based on the results of Study AUS01T 
that evaluated the safety and efficacy of eltrombopag in combination with h-ATG and CsA in subjects with 
SAA, who had not received prior IST. Safety data from the clinical development in the other indications is 
also available as well as data from the post-marketing experience. 
Overall,  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  eltrombopag  in  treatment-naive  SAA  patients  appears  consistent 
with what was shown in previous indications; no new or unexpected findings have been identified. Most of 
the AE and SAE identified are related to the underlying condition and are manageable in clinical practice.  
In study AUS01T the most common AEs (regardless of causal relationship to study drug) observed with 
an incidence of ≥10% were febrile neutropenia, ALT/AST increase (known to occur with eltrombopag, h-
ATG and CsA), blood bilirubin increase and serum sickness (attributable to h-ATG). No deaths related to 
study treatment were reported. Few AEs led to treatment discontinuation: Of 6, 1 AE of encephalopathy 
(leading to the on-treatment death as above), 4 AEs of rash, and 1 AE of colitis. Most of the AEs requiring 
dose interruption/adjustment (17 subjects) were increased ALT and AST. Regarding the adverse events of 
special interest already described, no events of recurrence of thrombocytopenia, bone marrow fibrosis, or 
haematologic  malignancies  were  reported.  Renal  events,  thromboembolic  events  and  bleeding  events 
were  rare  in  all  cohorts,  and  none  of  these  events  led  to  treatment  discontinuation  or  to  dose 
interruption/adjustment. 
A serious complication of AA is its evolution to clonal haematologic diseases such as myelodysplasia and 
leukemia,  which  is  usually  associated  with  the  appearance  of  cytogenetic  abnormalities  in  bone  marrow 
cells.  In  Study  AUS01T,  clonal  cytogenetic  evolution  occurred  in  9  of  123  (7%)  subjects,  which  is  not 
higher compared with historical data; 5 events of clonal evolution occurred within 6.1 months of starting 
treatment, 4 of which had abnormalities in chromosome 7. These observations are consistent with what 
has  been  reported  in  the  studies  in  refractory  SAA  subjects  who  received  eltrombopag  alone  (Study 
US18T and Study US28T).  
Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The assessment of safety of eltrombopag in this population is hampered by the severity of the underlying 
condition,  the  lack  of  a  control  arm  and  the  overall limited  database.  Although  the  safety  profile  seems 
similar  to  that  observed  for  the  refractory  SAA  indication,  the  lack  of  a  comparator  prevents  from 
ascertaining which adverse events are related to the addition of eltrombopag.  
A  final  conclusion  about  the  early  onset  of  cytogenetic  abnormalities  with  eltrombopag  relative  to 
immunosuppressant treatment cannot be reached until more data in a higher number of patients with a 
long-term follow-up is available. Such a risk is further highlighted by recent literature reporting a possible 
relationship  between  exposure  to  eltrombopag  and  increased  rates  of  cytogenetic  clonal  evolution 
(Winkler et al. 2019).

Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The lack of a direct comparison versus the current standard of care IST, severely limits interpretation of 
the  magnitude  of  clinical  benefit.  Haematological  response  in  the  AUS01T  study  was  compared  with 
results  from  historical  studies  that  used  standard  IST.  Comparative  results  seem  promising,  but  the 
limitations of such comparisons are well known, preventing drawing sound conclusions.  
The  reported  safety  profile  of  eltrombopag  is  similar  to  the  already  known  safety  profile  in  the 
refractory/relapsed population. Nevertheless, the lack of a comparator arm makes it difficult to ascertain 
which  adverse  events  are  related  to  the  addition  of  eltrombopag  to  standard  treatment.  From  the 
available  data  set,  no  new  safety  signals  became  apparent.  However,  the  risk  of  emergence  of  clonal 
aberrations,  a  serious  complication  of  aplastic  anaemia,  remains  a  major  uncertainty  warranting  a 
dedicated follow-up study to address this risk.  
Balance of benefits and risks 
The effect of eltrombopag on top of IST for the first line treatment in SAA patients looks encouraging in 
terms  of  CR  and  OR,  but  it  is  difficult  to  interpret  due  to  the  lack  of  a  comparator  arm  in  the  pivotal 
clinical trial. The use of external cohorts for comparison with standard IST suggests a favourable response 
when adding eltrombopag to IST, but such comparisons have well known limitations. In the comparison 
including  only  NIH  based  studies,  external  validity  is  questioned  and  selection  bias  cannot  be  excluded. 
The  approach  of  using  an  extended  historical  study  pool  based  on  widened  criteria  for  study  selection 
tried to overcome these limitations. However, it could not solve the major drawback of uncontrolled data 
per se, but rather introduced more heterogeneity. 
From  a  safety  point  of  view,  no  unexpected  findings  have  been  identified,  but  due  to  the  absence  of  a 
comparator in study AUS01T it is difficult to assess the contribution of eltrombopag to the safety profile of 
the  triple  combination  in  this  setting.  No  safety  advantage,  such  as  e.g.  a  lower  dose  of 
immunosuppressive  drugs,  comes  with  the  first  line  eltrombopag  regimen,  and  while  the  AE  profile  in 
AUS01T  seems  similar  to  what  is  known  from  the  approved  indication,  concerns  about  the  potential  of 
clonal evolution with eltrombopag need to be followed up.

7.  Recommendations following re-examination 
Final outcome 
Based on the arguments of the applicant and all the supporting data on quality, safety and efficacy, the 
CHMP re-examined its initial opinion and in its final opinion considers the following variation not 
acceptable and therefore does not recommend by a majority of 28 out of 30, the variation to the terms of 
the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:

Extension of indication to include first line treatment of adult and paediatric patients aged 2 years and 
older with severe aplastic anaemia for Revolade in combination with standard immunosuppressive 
therapy; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The 
Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. The RMP version 50 has also been updated. 
During the initial application, the MAH changed the proposed indication to adult and paediatric patients 
aged 12 years and above. 
Grounds for refusal: 
• 
The efficacy and safety data of eltrombopag on top of standard of care as first line treatment of 
patients with severe aplastic anemia has not been sufficiently demonstrated. The submitted 
data, based on study NIH AUS01T, do not allow a reliable and valid assessment of the benefit of 
Revolade when added to the standard of care (SOC) due to the lack of a robust comparison 
against established treatment. The indirect comparison with historical data cannot overcome this 
deficiency.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
10 December 2020 
The MAH for Keytruda is applying for an extension of indication of pembrolizumab as first line treatment 
of unresectable or metastatic microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) 
colorectal cancer in adults, based on the results of the open-label international randomized phase 3 trial 
KEYNOTE-177 of pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy in MSI-H or dMMR Stage IV Colorectal Carcinoma. 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
The claimed therapeutic indication at the time of submission was: 
“KEYTRUDA as monotherapy is indicated for the first-line treatment of unresectable or metastatic 
microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) colorectal cancer in adults”  
During the procedure, the MAH updated the sought indication as follows: 
“KEYTRUDA as monotherapy is indicated for the first-line treatment of unresectable or metastatic 
microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) colorectal cancer in adults”

Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Colorectal cancer ranks third in terms of incidence and second in terms of mortality worldwide1. 
Approximately 12-15% of all CRC and 4% of metastatic CRC are characterized as microsatellite 
instability-high (MSI-H) and/or mismatch repair-deficiency (dMMR).2 
Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
Mismatch repair proteins (MMR) repair insertions or deletions in microsatellites, which are repetitive DNA 
units. MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 are known MMR gene products. Dysfunction of this system is known 
as deficient mismatch repair (dMMR), which leads to the insertion of deletion of the repeating nucleotides 
microsatellites during DNA replication and accumulation of mutations due to failure to correct errors in 
nucleotide repeat. This form of genomic instability is called microsatellite instability (MSI).  
MSI-H/dMMR has been observed in many types of cancer including CRC, gastric, endometrial, biliary, 
urinary tract, ovarian and breast tumours. Some tumour types have noticeably higher MSI-H prevalence 
than others (endometrial and colon cancer in particular), being the overall prevalence in stage IV cancers 
of approximately 5%.3  
There are two forms of MSI colorectal cancer: (1) the hereditary type, caused by the deficiency of MMR 
system resulting from a germline mutation in MMR genes predisposing to Lynch syndrome (LS) or 
hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, which is the most common hereditary colon cancer syndrome, 
inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern; (2) the sporadic form, which is related to the somatic 
inactivation of the same pathway, most commonly through hypermethylation (epigenetic inactivation) of 
the MLH1 gene, leading to sporadic MSI/dMMR CRC.  
Recent studies highlighted genetic diversity and distinct patterns in CRC with MSI, suggesting substantial 
heterogeneity, also based on MSI etiology.4 
Methylation of the MLH1 promoter region in the sporadic form is strongly associated with the BRAF V600E 
gene mutation. The presence of the BRAF V600E mutation in CRC essentially excludes Lynch syndrome, 
except for rare cases associated with PMS2 germ-line mutation. While BRAF V600E mutation has a 
negative prognostic impact in proficient MMR CRC, data on the role of BRAF in relation to MMR status are 
scarce and the impact of BRAFV600E mutation on MSI CRCs remains controversial. 5 By contrast, KRAS 
mutations (in codons 12 or 13) are inversely correlated with MSI-H status.6 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The MSI-high (MSI-H) phenotype is characterized by clinical and pathologic features distinct from those 
observed in microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC. MSI-H CRCs are usually diagnosed at younger age and at an 
earlier stage than MSS CRC, with a predominance in the right colon. The sporadic form is however 
characterized by older age at diagnosis than the hereditary one and it’s more often associated with

female sex and cigarette smoking.8 Regardless whether hereditary or sporadic, MSI-H CRCs are 
histologically characterized by great production of mucin with extracellular accumulation, signet ring and 
medullary types, often admixed, with increased numbers of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and 
prominent Crohn’s-like lymphoid reaction.7 
Patients with Lynch syndrome have an increased risk of synchronous or metachronous tumours, as well 
as higher risk for the development of extracolonic cancer, in particular endometrial carcinoma, and also 
cancers of the small bowel, stomach, genitourinary system and biliary tract.  
With regard to the molecular diagnosis, MMR or MSI status can be determined by examining either: (1) 
protein expression by IHC staining for 4 MMR proteins (MLH1/MSH2/MSH6/PMS2) on tumour samples to 
identify negative or loss of staining (i.e. loss of protein expression) that characterize dMMR as a surrogate 
for MSI; or (2) molecular DNA testing PCR-based microsatellite instability analysis evaluating a specific 
panels of microsatellite markers to identify instability in selected loci. In general, tumours are classified as 
MSI-H (including MMR deficient) when expression of at least 1 of 4 MMR proteins is not detectable by 
IHC, or when 30% or more of the loci show instability. Both methods are sensitive and specific for MSI 
detection and have a high concordance rate. Although both IHC- and PCR-based approaches are currently 
considered the standard for MSI detection, several studies have proposed other methods such as NGS.6 8   
These tests are performed directly on tumour samples.  
International guidelines (ESMO, NCCN, ASCO) recommend MMR/MSI testing with either an MMR protein 
IHC-based assay or PCR-based MSI loci for all patients with CRC in clinical decision making, and that “IHC 
for MMR and DNA analysis for MSI are different assays and measure different biological effects caused by 
deficient mismatch repair function”. Patients determined to have defective MMR status are biologically the 
same population as those with MSI-H status. 9 10 11 
Findings from a pooled analysis of four phase 3 studies in participants with metastatic CRC treated with 
first-line SOC therapies, showed that the median PFS and OS were significantly worse for participants 
with MSI-H/dMMR CRC compared with participants whose tumours were microsatellite stable (PFS: 
HR=1.33; 95% CI:1.12–1.57; OS: HR=1.35;95% CI:1.13–1.61)12 (see table below). 
The underlying hypothesis for studies with anti PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies in MSI-H/dMMR cancer is that MSI-
H/dMMR cancers are characterized by a high burden of somatic mutation and tumour-specific neoantigen 
load mediated by MSI and common defects in MMR, which can be recognized by the patient’s immune 
system.6 In this subset of MSI-H/dMMR cancer patients a large number of activated CD8 positive 
cytotoxic T cells and a cytokine-rich environment have been observed, associated with upregulated 
expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 and others checkpoints (e.g. CTLA-4). As a result, the MSI-H/dMMR 
phenotype represents a unique immunobiology that implicates the role of lymphocyte infiltration, high 
mutational load, and responsiveness to immune checkpoint blockade that can be addressed by anti-PD-1 
therapy. Not all patients with MSI-H tumours, however, respond to immunotherapy, suggesting that a 
deeper understanding of immune-related mechanisms in MSI-H CRC is required. 13

Management 
The outcome of patients with mCRC has clearly improved during recent years with median survival now 
reaching 30 months in clinical trials. The treatment of mCRC patients should be seen as a continuum of 
care in which the determination of the goals of the treatment is important: prolongation of survival, cure, 
improving tumour-related symptoms, stopping tumour progression and/or maintaining quality of life.14 
Patients are treated according to international guidelines for colorectal cancer. Combination 
chemotherapy of FOLFOX (oxaliplatin, 5-FU, and leucovorin/folinic acid) or FOLFIRI (irinotecan, 5-FU, and 
leucovorin/folinic acid) are established first-line SOC chemotherapy options for metastatic CRC. Both are 
partners for biologicals, but have a different toxicity profile, and may be used depending on the 
physician’s recommendation and regional preference. Capecitabine per OS can be used instead of IV 5-FU 
in combination with oxaliplatin. Monoclonal antibodies against vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF 
(bevacizumab) and against the epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR (cetuximab, panitumumab) are 
approved for use in combination with chemotherapy as first-line treatment in CRC, since they improve the 
outcome of mCRC. A summary of approved treatments for first-line treatment of metastatic CRC is 
presented in table below.  
Although there are currently available treatment options, the presence of additional effective therapies in 
this targeted advanced setting is welcomed.

2.1.2.  About the product 
Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is a humanized mAb IgG4/kappa isotype directed against PD-1. By blocking 
the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands PD-L1/2, pembrolizumab enhances T cell lymphocyte activity 
with consequent stimulation of the immune-mediated anti-tumour activity. Pembrolizumab also 
modulates the level of IL-2, TNFα, IFNγ, and other cytokines. The antibody potentiates existing immune 
responses in the presence of antigen only; it does not non-specifically activate T cells. 
Pembrolizumab is currently approved in EU for the treatment of melanoma, NSCLC, RCC, HNSCC, 
urothelial cancer, and cHL. Pembrolizumab has been approved both as monotherapy and in combination 
with other agents.  
The  scope  of  this  variation  is  to  include  a  new  indication  for  Keytruda  for  the  first-line  treatment  of 
metastatic microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) colorectal cancer in 
adults. The proposed indication is based on the results from of a single pivotal study, KEYNOTE-177, an 
ongoing  open-label,  2-arm,  randomized  (1:1),  multicentre,  international,  phase  3  trial  evaluating  the 
efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab monotherapy (200 mg Q3W) versus SOC chemotherapies (mFOLFOX6 
or  FOLFIRI  alone  or  in  combination  with  bevacizumab  or  cetuximab)  as  first  line  treatment  for  locally 
confirmed  dMMR  or  MSI-H  stage  IV  CRC.  A  total  of  307  patients  were  randomized  to  one  of  the  two 
treatment arms. 
The MAH applied for the following indication: 
Keytruda  as  monotherapy  is  indicated  for  the  first-line  treatment  of  unresectable  or  metastatic 
Assessment report

microsatellite instability-high (MSI H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) colorectal cancer in adults. 
The CHMP agreed to the following indication: 
Keytruda as monotherapy is indicated for the first-line treatment of metastatic microsatellite instability-high 
(MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) colorectal cancer in adults. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
Scientific advice was obtained from the CHMP on 22-OCT-2015 (EMEA/H/SA/2437/8/2015/II) on the 
design of KEYNOTE-177 study. With regard to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, the CHMP commented that 
excluding patients with ECOG PS 2 was not considered necessary. About the comparator, while all the 6 
proposed regimens individually were deemed acceptable, it was advised to reduce the number of possible 
investigator choice chemotherapies to 4 or 2, in order to reduce heterogeneity. The final design however 
retained all the 6 comparators. PFS was proposed as primary endpoint for the study, with OS as a key 
secondary endpoint, and collection of PFS2 data was ensured (in the current design PFS and OS are dual 
primary instead). The CHMP considered this acceptable, provided sufficiently mature OS data were 
submitted. In this regard, the CHMP recommended to perform the primary PFS analysis with the interim 
OS analysis after further maturity of the study. The MAH followed such advice, by increasing the maturity 
of final PFS analysis (i.e. OS IA) compared to the original design.  
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. The assessment of 
KN177 data did not raise concern over GCP compliance leading to request for GCP inspection.   
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
According to the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) proteins are exempted from the submission of ERA studies because they are 
unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. Pembrolizumab is a protein, therefore an ERA has 
not been submitted by the MAH. This is acceptable. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Comprehensive review of the key clinical pharmacology findings for pembrolizumab as monotherapy (200 
mg Q3W dosing regimen) from melanoma, NSCLC, HNSCC, HL, UC, GEJ adenocarcinoma and HCC 
indications have been discussed extensively in previous submissions. The key clinical pharmacology 
characteristics are summarized in the current and EU SmPC.  
Clinical pharmacology results specific to this submission include: 
• PK data of pembrolizumab at 200 mg Q3W from adults with MSI-/dMMR CRC (KEYNOTE-177). 
• A proposed additional dosing regimen of 400 mg Q6W for pembrolizumab selected using Modeling & 
Simulation analyses, primarily based on PK exposure matching with approved Q3W dosing regimens. 
Pharmacokinetics in Subjects with MSI-H/dMMR CRC 
PK samples with a 20-Nov-2017 visit cut-off date were measured for a total of 126 subjects in KEYNOTE-
177. The PK analysis was constructed from the final locked SDTM datasets using SAS version 9.4 and 
contains observed MK-3475 serum concentrations and actual elapsed blood sampling times relative to the 
corresponding time of dose. 
PK sampling schedule in KEYNOTE-177 200 mg Q3W: Pre-dose pembrolizumab serum concentrations 
(Ctrough) were obtained within 24 hours prior to dosing at cycles 1,2,4,6,8,12 and every 4 cycles 
thereafter. Post-dose samples (Cmax) were drawn at cycle 1 and cycle 8 within approximately 30 minutes 
after the end of MK-3475 infusion. Additional PK samples were drawn at 24 hours, between 72 and 168 
hours and at 336 hours after cycle 1 dosing. PK samples were also collected at discontinuation of 
pembrolizumab and 30 days after discontinuation of pembrolizumab.

Over the course of clinical development of pembrolizumab, PK has been robustly characterised. Using a 
dataset with sample size of 2993 participants, a time-dependent PK model was created to describe the PK 
profile as indicated in the USPI and EU SmPC. This model is used as the reference PK model to support 
pembrolizumab submissions across indications worldwide. Observed pembrolizumab concentration data in 
KEYNOTE-177 where pembrolizumab was administered to subjects with microsatellite instability-high 
colorectal carcinoma are overlaid on the simulated profile using the reference model as shown in the 
following figure:

Pembrolizumab serum concentrations in cycle 1, 2 and 8 observed at 200 mg Q3W in MSI-H CRC patients 
are  comparable  to  the  range  of  concentrations  at  the  same  dose  levels  observed  in  patients  with  other 
types of cancer (Melanoma, NSCLC, HNSCC…).  
The observed concentrations in MSI-H CRC generally fall within the range of predicted concentrations, both 
after first dose and at steady state (at and after cycle 8) indicating that the definitive population TD PK 
model provides an adequate representation of the pembrolizumab pharmacokinetics in this population, in 
addition to other indications.

2.3.1.  Pharmacodynamics 
Dose regimen 
The 200 mg Q3W dosing regimen is approved for use in multiple indications globally and is based on a 
large, integrated body of evidence at this dose level across indications. Furthermore, clinical response in 
patients from the MSI-H/dMMR CRC trials including treatment arms dosed at 200 mg Q3W (KEYNOTE-
177) support the favorable benefit-risk of patient outcomes at the proposed dosing regimen of 200 mg 
Q3W. 
The proposed additional dosing regimen of 400 mg Q6W for pembrolizumab was selected using Modelling 
& Simulation analyses, primarily based on PK exposure matching with approved Q3W dosing regimens. 
Specifically, the dosing regimen of 400 mg Q6W is considered adequate, given the following rationale: 
• PK simulations demonstrating that in terms of pembrolizumab exposures – 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/33664/2021 
Page 21/100 
 
 
  
  
 
 - Cavg over the dosing interval or AUC at 400 mg Q6W are similar to those at the approved 200 mg Q3W 
dose, thus bridging efficacy between dosing regimens. 
- Cmin at 400 mg Q6W are ~12% lower at a mean level compared to that at the lowest clinically tested 
dose of 2 mg/kg Q3W, at steady state. However, in majority (>99%) of patients, Cmin are generally 
within the range of clinical experience of Cmin achieved with 2 mg/kg or 200 mg Q3W. 
- Cmax and concentrations over the entire PK profile at 400 mg Q6W are well below the Cmax and PK 
profile for the highest clinically tested dose of 10 mg/kg Q2W. Clinically, the observed safety profiles were 
similar among 2 mg/kg Q3W, 10 mg/kg Q3W, and 10 mg/kg Q2W in multiple tumour types based on 
randomized dose comparisons. Since the Cmax,ss (and Cavg through the dosing interval) expected at 
400 mg Q6W lies within the range of those achieved at these clinically tested doses, the safety profile is 
expected to be comparable to the established safety profile of pembrolizumab. 
• Exposure-Response for pembrolizumab has been demonstrated to be flat across multiple indications. OS 
predictions in melanoma and NSCLC demonstrate that efficacy at 400 mg Q6W is expected to be similar 
to that at 200 mg or 2 mg/kg Q3W, given the similar exposures among these dosing regimens. Thus, 400 
mg Q6W is expected to be efficacious across indications where 200 mg (or 2 mg/kg) Q3W have 
demonstrated efficacy, given the generally similar PK and flat E-R for pembrolizumab across tumour 
types.  
Immunogenicity 
The existing immunogenicity assessment for pembrolizumab for the monotherapy setting is based on a 
sufficiently large dataset of patients across several indications, with low observed rates of total treatment 
ADA across different pembrolizumab regimens (1.4 – 3.8%) as well as of neutralizing antibodies (0.4 – 
1.6%). This analysis has not demonstrated impact on efficacy or safety, as currently summarized in the 
USPI and EU SmPC. This low rate of immunogenicity has been shown to be consistent across tumour type 
and no clinically meaningful consequences have been observed in the subjects with a positive 
immunogenicity reading. Based on the existing robust characterization of immunogenicity potential, 
alignment has been obtained with the US FDA and EMA that the current assessment of immunogenicity 
for pembrolizumab is adequate for non-adjuvant monotherapy settings. 
2.3.2.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
No dose finding study was conducted for pembrolizumab monotherapy for treatment of MSI-H/dMMR 
mCRC. The investigated dose and schedule of pembrolizumab monotherapy for treatment of MSI-H/dMMR 
mCRC is the same as that approved for other monotherapy indications: 200 mg IV infusion over 60 
minutes Q3W. This is considered acceptable. 
The MAH presented a clinical pharmacology report on a total of 126 patients recruited in study KEYNOTE-
177 with a cut-off date of 20-Nov-2017. The following analyses were provided: i) descriptive PK 
concentrations by cycle and relative time to pembrolizumab dosing (Ctrough up to Cycle 24 and Cmax at 
Cycle 1 and Cycle 8), ii) observed pembrolizumab concentrations (both pre-dose and post-dose) at Cycle 
1 and at steady-state overlaid on the predictions using the reference model (i.e., a time-dependent PK 
model constructed using sample size of 2993 participants with melanoma and NSCLC as indicated in the 
USPI and EU SmPC), and iii) a comparison across pembrolizumab monotherapy studies following multiple 
administrations of 200 mg Q3W dosing, including KEYNOTE-177. 
The time course of PK samples following multiple administrations of pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W in study 
KEYNOTE-177 shows a progressive increase of Ctrough that plateaued around Cycle 6 (Week 15; median: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/33664/2021 
Page 22/100 
 
 
  
  
 
35.4  µg/ml), with a slight trend in ongoing accumulation. With respect to the reference PK model, 
observed concentrations both at Cycle 1 and steady-state generally lay within 90% of prediction interval 
with only a few outliers, indicating that variability in exposure in patients with CRC is satisfactorily 
predicted by the definitive population PK model developed on the basis of prior monotherapy studies. 
Data are confirmed by the comparison across tumour types showing a similar range of peak 
concentrations at Cycle 1 and similar tough levels at steady state in the different studies, with the only 
exception for HL that was characterised by a higher level of Cmin at steady-state compared to other 
tumour types in line with prior findings (40 times higher according with current SmPC). 
The MAH proposed an additional dosing regimen of 400 mg Q6W for pembrolizumab. This regimen was 
approved on 28-MAR-2019 for all monotherapy indications approved at the time based on PK and E-R 
bridging using M&S analyses (procedure number EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0062). The established flat E-R 
profiles and the popPK analysis indicate that there are no major differences in pharmacokinetics of 
pembrolizumab in mCRC compared to other solid tumour types. Therefore, the 400 mg Q6W dosing 
regimen should have a similar benefit-risk profile as the 200 mg Q3W (or 2 mg/kg Q3W) dosing regimen 
in the clinical use of pembrolizumab in adult patients with MSI-H/dMMR metastatic CRC.  
No additional assessments of the immunogenicity were performed. The observed incidences indicate a low 
potential of pembrolizumab to elicit anti-drug antibody formation.  
2.3.3.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology profile of pembrolizumab in patients with CRC is consistent with historical data.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The efficacy data supporting this extension of indication are based on the results of a single pivotal study, 
KEYNOTE-177, an ongoing open-label, 2-arm, randomized (1:1), multicentre, international, phase 3 
trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab monotherapy (200 mg Q3W) versus SOC 
chemotherapies (mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI alone or in combination with bevacizumab or cetuximab) as first 
line treatment for locally confirmed dMMR or MSI-H stage IV CRC. Subjects randomized to the control 
arm had the option to crossover and receive pembrolizumab after PD. A total of 307 patients were 
randomized. Dual primary endpoints were PFS per RECIST 1.1 by BICR and OS. This submission is based 
on the second interim analysis (i.e. final PFS and interim OS analysis) results with data cutoff date of 19-
FEB-2020 (24 months after the last subject was randomized). The median follow-up duration was 28.4 
months (range, 0.2 to 48.3) for the pembrolizumab group and 27.2 months (range, 0.8 to 46.6) for the 
SOC treatment group.

Treatment must be discontinued for confirmed radiographic PD, unacceptable AEs, intercurrent illness 
that prevents further administration of treatment, consent withdrawal, investigator’s decision to 
discontinue the subject from treatment, confirmed positive serum pregnancy test of the subject, 
administrative reasons, or the subject completed 35 treatments (2 years) of pembrolizumab. 
Discontinuation of pembrolizumab may be considered for subjects with locally confirmed CR after at least 
8 cycles (approximately 6 months), and at least 2 treatments beyond the date when the initial CR was 
declared.  
During the study, subjects may undergo resection of the primary tumour and metastasectomy with 
curative intent if deemed eligible per site institutional standard after achieving a response to study 
medication converting unresectable to resectable. After surgery, subjects may resume the same pre-
operative treatment (SOC or Pembrolizumab) when clinically appropriate.

Second Course Phase (pembrolizumab arm and SOC chemotherapy arm following crossover):  
Subjects who stopped pembrolizumab after confirmed CR, or who completed 35 cycles of pembrolizumab 
with SD, PR or CR, may be eligible for retreatment with pembrolizumab (up to 17 cycles i.e. about 1 
year) if they progress after stopping study treatments.  
Crossover Phase (SOC chemotherapy arm):  
Subjects in the chemotherapy arm with documented PD per RECIST 1.1 confirmed by BICR could be 
eligible for crossover to pembrolizumab (up to 17 cycles), if meeting eligibility criteria for the Crossover 
Phase. Surgical subjects who progress post operatively are also eligible to receive pembrolizumab in the 
Crossover Phase with up to 17 administrations (approximately 1 year) of pembrolizumab. 
Imaging assessment 
Tumour imaging was performed every 9 weeks during study treatment. All scheduled and unscheduled 
images for all study subjects from the sites were submitted to the central imaging vendor. 
Subjects who undergo surgical resection with curative intent while on study resumed imaging 
postoperatively when clinically possible to maintain the Q9W imaging schedule. 
Local-site investigator assessed 1st PD must be verified by the central imaging vendor. If PD is confirmed 
centrally by RECIST 1.1, patients on chemotherapy arm may crossover to pembrolizumab (if all criteria 
for crossover phase are met), while patients on pembrolizumab arm should repeat imaging ≥4 weeks at 
site to confirm PD. If patient is clinically stable may continue pembrolizumab at investigator discretion 
while awaiting confirmatory tumour scan. If PD is then verified by site at repeated images, subject should 
discontinue pembrolizumab (unless deriving clinically meaningful benefit after consultation with the 
Applicant).  
For all subjects, per RECIST 1.1, PR or CR should be confirmed by a repeat tumour imaging assessment. 
In subjects who discontinue trial treatment without documented PD, every effort should be made to 
continue monitoring their disease status by radiologic imaging every 9 weeks until start of new anti-
cancer treatment, PD, death, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up or the end of the study. 
Evaluation of tumour response by RECIST 1.1 per the central imaging vendor is the basis for efficacy 
assessment in this study. irRECIST is used by site investigator/local radiology review to assess tumour 
response and progression, and make treatment decisions while subjects are receiving pembrolizumab. 
irRECIST was used to make treatment decisions beyond progression by RECIST 1.1, allowing treatment 
after progression if patients derived clinical benefit according to investigator.

Sample size 
The study was event-driven and planned to randomize approximately 300 subjects with 1:1 ratio into the 
two treatment groups: pembrolizumab and SOC. 
Two interim efficacy analyses were planned in this study, one for PFS, two for OS and none for ORR. A 
Lan-DeMets O’Brien-Fleming alpha-spending function was constructed to implement group sequential 
efficacy boundaries to control the Type I error for each PFS and each OS hypothesis. The sample size 
calculation for the two primary hypotheses are listed: 
(1)  With 209 PFS events, there was 98% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.55 (pembrolizumab vs. 
SOC) at alpha = 1.25% (one-sided), assuming PFS follows an exponential distribution with a 
median of 10 months in the control arm, an enrolment period of 30 months from first subject 
randomized and minimum of 13 months follow-up after enrolment completion. The dropout rate 
was assumed to be 5% yearly. 
(2)  With 190 OS events, there was 85% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.62 (pembrolizumab vs. 
SOC) at alpha = 1.25% (one-sided) assuming OS follows an exponential distribution with a 
median of 24 months in the control arm, and an enrolment period of 30 months from first 
subjects randomized and a minimum of 33.5 months follow-up after enrolment completion. The 
dropout rate was assumed to be 2% yearly. 
For the key secondary endpoint of ORR, which was planned to be tested if either the PFS or the OS 
hypothesis was rejected, there was 92% power (1-sided 2.5% alpha) to detect an 19% improvement on 
the experimental arm assuming the true ORR for the control arm ranges between 50%, depending on the 
actual percentage of subjects without prior SCT are enrolled.

Randomisation 
Patients were randomized 1:1 to pembrolizumab or SOC arm centrally using an interactive voice response 
system/integrated web response system (IVRS/IWRS).  
No stratification factors were used.  
Blinding (masking) 
The study was open-label.  
Independent radiologist(s) who centrally reviewed the images had no knowledge of subject treatment 
assignment. 
Statistical methods 
Efficacy populations 
The analyses of efficacy endpoints were performed on the Intention-to-Treat (ITT) population, which 
includes all randomized subjects in the treatment group to which they are assigned, whether or not 
treatment was administered.  
For the PRO assessment, the primary analysis was conducted in the quality of life related full analysis set 
(FAS) population, consisting of all randomized subjects who have received at least one dose of study 
medication, and have completed at least one PRO assessment. There is one FAS population per PRO 
instrument scale.

Sensitivity analysis for primary endpoints 
Two sensitivity analyses with different censoring rules for PFS were planned to be performed for the 
primary analysis, see table below. In comparison to the primary analysis, in the first sensitivity analysis 
subjects were censored at last disease assessment without PD, when PD/death was documented after 
more than one missing disease assessment. In the second sensitivity analysis, patients were considered 
for discontinuation of treatment or initiation of an anticancer treatment subsequent to discontinuation of 
study-specified treatments to be a PD event for subjects without documented PD or death.  
Table: censoring rules for Primary and Sensitivity analyses of PFS 
Participants who had curative intent surgery were censored in the PFS analysis at the date of surgery 
unless a prior PD event had been noted per central review. 
Sensitivity analyses for overall survival was performed, where the crossover of patients who switched to 
pembrolizumab after progressive disease was (1) adjusted for by appropriate methods, and (2) where 
patients were censored at the start of crossover treatment or the start of first subsequent immune 
checkpoint inhibitor treatment, whichever occurs first. 
Interim Analysis 
Two interim analyses were planned. The timing of the interim analyses together with the nominal 
significance levels are shown in the table below. For the PFS and OS hypotheses, Lan-DeMets O’Brien-
Fleming alpha spending function was used to construct group sequential boundaries to control the type I 
error. For PFS analysis the extended graphical method was planned to be used (Anderson et al, 
unpublished data, 2018). This means that the actual boundaries were to be adjusted using the Lan-
DeMets O’Brien-Fleming spending function with spending time determined by the minimum of the actual 
information fraction and the expected information fraction.

Multiplicity 
The family-wise type I error rate for this study was controlled at 2.5% (one-sided), whereby the 
allocation to the different hypotheses was defined as shown in the following figure by Maurer and Bretz 
(2013):

Table: Efficacy Boundaries and Properties for Overall Survival Analyses 
The trial initially allocates 0% to the ORR hypothesis. If null hypotheses for both OS and PFS are rejected, 
an ORR benefit may be tested at the 2.5% 1-sided level. If only one of the OS and PFS null hypotheses is 
rejected, ORR would be tested at the 0.0125% 1-sided level. The p-value from IA1 will be used to 
compare with α-levels, considering ORR data will be mature at IA1.

Eleven participants who were randomized to the SOC group withdrew from the study prior to starting 
treatment. The reasons for withdrawal were unknown (5 participants), randomized to the SOC arm (5), 
and administrative issues (1).  
Among participants who received treatment during the initial treatment phase, more participants in the 
SOC group than in the pembrolizumab group discontinued due to withdrawal of consent (11 vs 1) and 
physician decision (12 vs 3). The reasons for withdrawal of consent in the SOC group were unknown (6 
participants), no longer wanted therapy (3 participants), and pursuing surgical intervention (2 
participants). The reasons for discontinuation due to physician decision included surgical resection (7 
participants), status of subject not conducive to continue treatment (3 participants), and additional 
therapy required (2 participants).

Out of 4 patients who received second-course treatment with pembrolizumab, one achieved PR upon 
retreatment. Out of 3 patients who stopped for progression, one had PR when retreated. The patient who 
discontinued due to CR had SD at retreatment. One patient who stopped pembrolizumab due to an AE 
(not specified) was rechallenged with SD. 
Table: Summary of Subsequent Therapies (ITT Population) 
Recruitment 
A total of 307 patients (153 in the pembrolizumab arm and 154 in the SOC arm) were randomized in 120 
centers in 23 countries worldwide (Australia, Europe, Asia, America, South Africa). First patient first visit 
was on 30-NOV-2015.   
KEYNOTE-177 study is ongoing; this report is based on the second interim analysis (i.e. final for PFS, IA 
for OS) with data cutoff date of 19-FEB-2020 (database lock date 16-MAR-2020).  
Median duration of follow-up at the time of data cutoff was 28.4 months (range: 0.2, 48.3 months) and 
27.2 months (range: 0.8, 46.6 months) in the pembrolizumab and SOC groups, respectively.

Rationale 
17-MAR-2016 
• Required subjects to discontinue 
pembrolizumab after confirmed 
disease progression. 
• Clarified exclusion criterion to 
address contraindications to 
standard of care options. 
As per French Health Authority 
(ANSM) request.

20-NOV-2017 
• Addresses the need for a subject 
to discontinue the study if there is 
progression/recurrence/occurrence 
of another malignancy that 
requires active treatment 
• Clarified exclusion criterion to 
address contraindications to 
standard of care options. 
• Added prohibited medications for 
all standard of care agents 
according to respective SmPCs. 
• Added cautionary information for 
5-FU 
• Added assessments for physical 
exam for subjects assigned to 
FOLFOX-based regimens 
• Primary objective was changed 
from a single PFS endpoint to dual 
endpoints of PFS and OS. 
• Sample size was increased to 
300. 
• Interim and final analysis timing 
was updated and one IA for PFS 
and OS was added. 
04 
Global 
30-APR-2018 
• The timing component of IA1 
and IA2 was prolonged by 3 
additional months and the alpha 
spending method for PFS was 
modified. 
05 
Global 
17-DEC-2019 
• The timing of IA2 and FA was 
changed. IA2 will be performed 
when approximately 209 PFS 
events have occurred or 24 
months after last participant 
randomized, whichever occurs 
first. FA will be performed after 
approximately 190 OS events 
have occurred or 12 months after 
IA2, whichever occurs first. 
As per UK Regulatory Agency 
(MHRA) request.  
The revisions were based on 
desire to add OS as a dual 
primary endpoint. OS power was 
increased to 85% to increase 
probability of success for this 
primary hypothesis. Timing of 
analyses changed to allow for 
more mature PFS and OS data to 
account for a potential delayed 
separation in survival curves 
observed in immune-oncology 
studies, while adding an interim 
analysis to allow for earlier 
stopping if this is not the case. 
For PFS analysis, the alpha 
spending function to control the 
Type-I error based on 
information fraction was replaced 
by a function of the minimum of 
the actual event information 
fraction and the expected event 
information fraction. The timing 
component for conducting both 
interim analysis 1 and interim 
analysis 2 was prolonged by 3 
additional months. This change 
was made due to emerging 
results from multiple 
immunotherapy trials in which 
delayed treatment effects have 
been observed for time to event 
endpoints. To account for this 
potential effect, the timing of 
interim analyses 1 and 2 was 
changed to allow for a longer 
follow-up time, and the alpha 
spending method was modified 
accordingly. 
In the event that PFS or OS 
events accrue slower than 
expected as has been shown with 
immunotherapy in biomarker 
selected populations, alternate 
maximum time periods are 
specified for the conduct of the 
final PFS analysis and the final 
OS analysis.

Protocol deviations 
Protocol deviations were classified as per the ICH E3 classification as: 
- important (those that may significantly impact the quality or integrity of key study data or that may 
significantly affect a participant’s rights, safety, or well-being)  
- clinically important (deviations that may compromise critical data analyses pertaining to primary 
efficacy and/or safety endpoints or the participant’s safety)  
- not clinically important 
- not important 
Patients with one or more important protocol deviations were 13 (8.5%) in the pembrolizumab arm and 
17 (11%) in the SOC arm; most of these deviations pertained to reportable safety events or follow-up 
safety information that was reported outside the safety reporting window (6.5% and 9.1% in the 
pembrolizumab and SOC group, respectively). Important protocol deviations considered to be clinically 
important occurred in 1 patient in each arm: one clinically important deviation occurred in a participant 
who had a positive MSI-H status upon entering the study, but when retested centrally had a negative 
MSI-H status. This has been reported as due to a problem on the device used locally to perform the MSI 
test. The other clinically important deviation was noted in a participant who did not have measurable 
disease upon entering the study.  
No participant data were excluded from analyses due to an important protocol deviation.

Key secondary endpoint 
•  Overall Response Rate (ORR) 
Based on protocol-specified multiplicity strategy, if ORR by BICR per RECIST 1.1 was not significant at 
IA1, ORR at IA1 could be tested following a statistically significant PFS or OS hypothesis test at IA2 or 
final analysis. Because PFS was statistically significant at IA2, ORR at IA1 was formally tested and 
statistical significance was not demonstrated, as the p-value of 0.0582 for ORR at IA1 was above the 
p-value boundary of 0.000125. 
Only 2 cases of pseudoprogression were identified in the pembrolizumab arm.

Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) 
At baseline, the compliance rates for the EORTC QLQ-C30 were similar and above 90% in both treatment 
groups (92.8% vs 92.9%, respectively) and remained high at prespecified Week 18 (87.9% vs 76.6%, 
respectively). Compliance rates at baseline through Week 18 were similar for the EORTC QLQ-CR29 and 
EQ-5D. 
Baseline global health status/QoL scores were similar between treatment groups. At prespecified Week 
18, the mean change from baseline in the global health status/QoL score showed improvement (LS mean 
= 3.33 points [95% CI: -0.05, 6.72]) in the pembrolizumab group, and a decline (LS mean = -5.63 
points [95% CI: -9.32, -1.94]) in the SOC group. The difference in LS means between pembrolizumab 
and the SOC group at Week 18 was 8.96 points (95% CI: 4.24, 13.69; two-sided nominal p=0.0002, not 
adjusted for multiplicity). 
In the PRO FAS population with baseline assessments, based on the EORTC QLQ-C30, for participants in 
the pembrolizumab group compared to those in the SOC group, prolonged TTD was observed in global 
health status/QoL score (HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.38-0.98; one-sided nominal p=0.0195, not adjusted for 
multiplicity).  
A greater proportion of participants in the pembrolizumab group showed improvement in global health 
status/QoL score and all functioning and symptom scores (except insomnia) compared to those in the 
SOC group, while a greater proportion of participants in the SOC group showed deterioration in global 
health status/QoL score and all functioning and symptom scores compared to those in the pembrolizumab 
group.

Baseline EQ-5D VAS and utility scores were similar between treatment groups. At prespecified Week 18, 
the mean change from baseline in the EQ-5D VAS score showed improvement (LS mean = 4.50 points 
[95% CI: 1.16, 7.83]) in the pembrolizumab group, and a decline (LS mean = -2.88 points [95% CI: -
6.46, 0.69]) in the SOC group. The difference in LS means between pembrolizumab and the SOC group at 
Week 18 was 7.38 points (95% CI: 2.82, 11.93; two-sided nominal p=0.0016, not adjusted for 
multiplicity), a clinically important difference. For the EQ-5D utility score, the mean change from baseline 
to Week 18 showed improvement (LS mean = 0.04 points [95% CI: 0.00, 0.08]) in the pembrolizumab 
group, and a decline (LS mean = -0.01 points [95% CI: -0.05, 0.02]) in the SOC group, although the 
difference was not clinically meaningful (difference in LS means = 0.05; 95% CI: 0.00, 0.10; two-sided 
nominal p=0.0311, not adjusted for multiplicity).

Ancillary analyses (pre-specified) 
Sensitivity analyses for PFS 
- Sensitivity analysis using time to disease recurrence after curative-intent surgery: because some 
patients received surgery with curative intent (9.2% in the pembrolizumab group and 8.4% in the SOC 
group), a PFS sensitivity analysis (defined as PFS using time from randomization to disease recurrence 
after surgery for surgical participants) was performed: PFS HR= 0.60, 95%CI 0.45, 0.80. 
- PFS sensitivity analysis 1 (censors at the last disease assessment without PD when PD or death is 
documented after >1 missed disease assessment): PFS HR=0.62, 95%CI 0.46, 0.84. 
- PFS sensitivity analysis 2 (considers discontinuation of treatment or initiation of an anticancer treatment 
subsequent to discontinuation of study-specified treatments, whichever occurs later, to be a PD event for 
participants without documented PD or death): PFS HR=0.61, 95%CI 0.48, 0.79. 
Sensitivity analysis for OS – adjustment for crossover 
Sensitivity analyses were carried out to assess the impact of crossover on overall survival. Subjects in 
SOC arm who initiated subsequent anti-PD1/PDL1 treatment include those who crossed over from SOC to 
Pembrolizumab (n=56) and those who did not cross over but received subsequent anti-PD1/PDL1 
treatment (n=35). 
- inverse probability of censoring weighting model (IPCW): OS HR = 0.54 (95% CI: 0.27, 1.39)  
- rank preserving structural failure time model (RPSFT): OS HR = 0.72 (95% CI: 0.47, 1.11)

Multivariate Cox Regression analysis of PFS 
A multivariate Cox regression analysis of PFS was performed to further investigate potential covariates of 
prognostic interest in CRC. Two-sided p-values of <0.05 were observed for treatment by ECOG 
interaction and treatment by KRAS/NRAS status interaction. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was 
adjusted for ECOG, KRAS/NRAS status, treatment by ECOG interaction and treatment by KRAS/NRAS 
status interaction. The results of this analysis may suggest evidence of an interaction effect. However,

this analysis was not prespecified or adjusted for multiplicity and is underpowered due to the small 
sample size among participants with known KRAS/NRAS mutations (N = 74), as well as the fraction of the 
study population (29% of participants) whose KRAS/NRAS results were either undetermined or missing.

Supportive study(ies) 
N/A 
The MAH included in the dossier (but not presented as supportive) the CSR of KEYNOTE-164, a phase II 
single arm study of pembrolizumab in subjects with previously treated dMMR or MSI-H CRC, which 
included overall 124 adult, of whom 61 in Cohort A (patients previously treated with at least 2 lines of 
standard of care therapies), and 63 in Cohort B (patients previously treated with at least 1 line of 
systemic standard of care therapy). ORR per RECIST by IRC was the primary endpoint. Treatment with 
pembrolizumab resulted in an ORR of 32.8% (95%CI 21.3, 46) for Cohort A and 34.9% (95%CI 23.3, 48) 
for Cohort B, with 4.9% and 12.7% of complete responses in Cohort A and B, respectively With a median 
follow-up time of 31.4 months for Cohort A and 36.1 months for Cohort B, the median DOR was not 
reached in either cohort. 95% of responding patients have a response lasting ≥ 12 months.  
Of note, although advanced unresectable disease was formally included in KEYNOTE-164, according to 
baseline characteristics 100% of the patients had Stage IV mCRC (Cohort A and B).

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The MAH is seeking an extension of indication for Keytruda (pembrolizumab) as monotherapy for the 
first-line treatment of metastatic microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient 
(dMMR) colorectal carcinoma in adults, based on the results of the pivotal KEYNOTE-177 study, an 
ongoing phase 3 open-label randomized (1:1) study of pembrolizumab vs investigator’s choice SOC 
chemotherapy. Patients in the SOC arm had the option to crossover to pembrolizumab at BICR-confirmed 
radiographic PD. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The randomized 1:1 active controlled design of KEYNOTE-177 study is acceptable. The open label design 
is acknowledged in view of the marked differences of the treatments in the two arms.  
The inclusion/exclusion criteria are considered overall appropriate to define the target population, 
although mostly reflecting relatively fit patients (ECOG 0-1). Patients with ECOG 2/3 account for more 
than 30% of the mCRC patients. In MSI-H/dMMR this proportion seems to be even higher (Aasebø et al. 
2019). Information that only patients with ECOG 0 or 1 were enrolled is however included in the SmPC.  
The population proposed to be included in the initially sought indication was “unresectable or metastatic”, 
although only patients with stage IV disease (i.e. metastatic) were included in KEYNOTE-177. During the 
procedure,  the  indication  was  updated  to  include  “metastatic”  patients  only,  reflecting  the  population 
treated in the study.   
Inclusion was based on locally determined MSI/MMR testing by PCR or ICH, respectively, which is 
considered acceptable in general, taking into account that testing is already recommended by 
international guidelines in routine clinical practice and the acceptable concordance between PCR and IHC. 
In KEYNOTE-177 only 16 MSI-H tumours were detected via PCR. IHC testing was used for the majority of 
participants (105 pembrolizumab, 97 SOC) with far fewer participants assessed using PCR (16 
participants in each treatment group) or PCR and IHC (32 pembrolizumab, 40 SOC); therefore, 
considering the differences in the number of participants within each group, caution should be used when 
comparing across groups. Data provided for PCR detected (MSI-H) tumours are too limited to draw 
conclusions but given the reported data it could be that PCR-test with a 3 poly-A panel used in this study 
is not adequate in terms of specificity to detect MSI-H tumours. However, this is considered to be not 
clinically relevant in this specific indication due to the predominant use of IHC test in CRC. 
The comparator arm consisted of an investigator’s choice treatment (chosen before randomization) 
among 6 different polychemotherapy regimens, each acceptable as 1L regimen: 45% of the patients 
received mFOLFOX6+bevacizumab, followed by FOLFIRI+bevacizumab (25%), less than 20% of subjects 
received chemotherapy alone, and about 11% was treated with chemotherapy in combination with 
cetuximab. A consistent OS and PFS benefit of pembrolizumab vs each SOC (alone or grouped) was 
generally observed when analysed separately. Data for FOLFIRI/FOLFOX6 and cetuximab are too limited 
to draw any conclusion, nevertheless, contrary to worse OS, PFS was in favour of pembrolizumab. 
Further, due to the favourable safety profile of the pembrolizumab monotherapy, the use of several 
different regimen does not raise relevant concern of heterogeneity in the control arm. 
The study had PFS per RECIST 1.1 by BICR and OS as dual primary endpoint, i.e. the study was 
considered to have met its primary objective if pembrolizumab is superior to SOC chemotherapies in 
either of the 2 primary endpoints. ORR was a secondary endpoint, and PFS2 and DOR among the 
exploratory endpoint. The use of central imaging review is endorsed in view of the open-label design.  
A justification for the assumptions made for median PFS (10 months) and median OS (24 months) in the 
control arm, which the sample size calculation was based on, has not been found, although it seems 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/33664/2021 
Page 64/100 
 
 
  
  
congruent with the available historical data of chemotherapy in 1L CRC setting. Overall, statistical 
methods appeared standard and not controversial.  
The timing of the interim analyses was postponed several times. The MAH explained that the reason for 
postponing interim analysis 2 in amendment 5 by 8 months was motivated by the slow number of PFS 
events observed after interim analysis 1. The results for the timing defined in Amendment 4 however are 
consistent with the results of the final Amendment 5, which is reassuring. 
While in the original protocol PFS was the solely primary endpoint, OS was upgraded from key secondary 
to (dual) primary endpoint with Amendment 3 on 20.11.2017, which occurred before enrolment closure 
(on 19.02.2018) and before IA1 (on 19.10.2018). The MAH stated that revisions occurred to allow for 
more mature PFS and OS data to account for a potential delayed separation in survival curves observed 
in immuno-oncology studies, indeed all the study referenced were published before Amendment 3 was 
released. The argumentation that the changes were implemented solely based on emerging data from 
other immunotherapy trials outside of KEYNOTE-177 can be therefore followed.  
The MAH explained the procedure of IA1, which is acceptable. There seem to be no association between 
IA1 and the motivation of protocol amendment 5. PFS results are significant for both approaches of p-
value boundaries, the expected and the observed event fraction. 
Overall, the rate of protocol deviations was similar in both arms and no concern is raised over possible 
impact of protocol deviations on efficacy results.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 307 patients were randomized to pembrolizumab (n=153) vs SOC arm (n=154). Compared to 
the  pembrolizumab  arm,  a  higher  number  of  patients  did  not  receive  the  SOC  treatment  assigned  at 
randomization (0 vs 11 patients) as well as discontinued SOC treatment for subject’s or physician’s decision 
(4 vs 23). In this regard, the MAH presented 2 worst-case scenarios for PFS and OS. 34 participants in the 
SOC arm who were not treated, or withdrawn by physician’s decision, or withdrew by participant’s choice 
follow the PFS/OS pattern in the pembrolizumab arm. The results show consistency with the primary PFS 
and OS analysis. 
On  the  contrary,  it  is  noted  that,  apparently  unexpectedly,  a  higher  number  of  patients  in  the 
pembrolizumab than in the control arm discontinued treatment due to AEs (22 vs 17). However, based on 
the safety data, this could be related to a longer duration of exposure (see clinical safety).  
The MAH presented the results of the 2nd interim analysis (i.e. final PFS and interim OS analysis) having 
data cut-off date of 19-FEB-2020 (24 months after the last subject was randomized), with a median survival 
follow-up duration of about 28 months. 
The baseline characteristics appeared mostly balanced between the two treatment arms, with the exception 
(differences  ≥5%  between  arms)  of:  gender  (male  46.4%  vs  54.2%),  ECOG  (ECOG  0  49%  vs  54.5%), 
hepatic or pulmonary metastases (56.2% vs 47.4%), mutation status (KRAS/NRAS mutations 21.6% vs 
26.6%, BRAF V600E 22.2% vs 27.9%), in pembrolizumab vs SOC arm, respectively. It is noted that no 
stratification factors at randomization were used. It is reassuring that the results of the multivariate cox 
regression analyses adjusted for unbalanced baseline factors were similar to the overall study results (PFS 
HR=0.60, OS HR=0.77).  BRAF/KRAS/NRAS mutations were mutually exclusive in almost all tested patients. 
Unfortunately,  about  30%  of  subjects  had  unknown  mutational  status,  as  this  was  not  mandatory  for 
enrolment. Tumour burden was more commonly higher than the median in the pembrolizumab arm, which 
is not expected to have favoured the pembrolizumab arm.

Per  protocol,  tissue  was  not  collected  in  KEYNOTE-177,  and  therefore,  no  data  are  available  to  permit 
assessment of PD-L1 expression and TMB scores. The MAH mentioned that expression of PD-L1 was not 
found to be significantly associated with survival in KEYNOTE-016 study, but the number of patients with 
PD-L1 data available in this phase II study was very limited (n=30). No data on smoking status have been 
collected.  
Efficacy analyses were carried out in the ITT population. Pembrolizumab showed statistically significant 
and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS by BICR per RECIST 1.1 (final analysis) compared to SOC, 
with HR 0.60 (95%CI 0.45, 0.80), p=0.0002. Median PFS was 16.5 (95%CI 5.4, 32.4) vs 8.2 (95%CI 
6.1, 10.2) months. PFS events occurred in 53.6% vs 73.5% of subjects in pembrolizumab vs SOC arm. 
The pembrolizumab PFS KM curve is slightly below/overlap the SOC one, but after month 6 the two 
curves demonstrate an increasingly pronounced separation (PFS rate at 12 months 55.3% vs 37.3%, PFS 
rate at 24 months 48.3% vs 18.6%). Censoring from month 22-24 preclude the interpretation of the tail 
of the curve. PFS sensitivity analyses were consistent with the primary analysis result. Overall, the PFS 
benefit of pembrolizumab over SOC can be considered clinically relevant. 
On the contrary, OS (interim analysis) was not statistically significant, although a trend toward a survival 
advantage for pembrolizumab over SOC is noted: HR 0.77 (95%CI 0.54, 1.09), p=0.0694. Number of OS 
events were 36.6% vs 44.8% in pembrolizumab vs SOC arm, respectively, which is considered a 
reasonable maturity. Curves are however no more interpretable after 24 months due to high rate of 
censoring. Median OS was not reached in the pembrolizumab arm, vs 34.8 months (95%CI 26.3, NR) in 
the control arm, the latter being far higher compared to what originally expected with standard 
treatments (mOS 24 months). It is acknowledged that the high crossover rate to anti-PD(L)1 in the SOC 
arm (59%) could be implicated in this observation. Indeed, sensitivity analyses carried out to assess the 
impact of crossover on OS indicated possibly lower HRs compared to the primary OS analysis. However, 
no definitive conclusions can be drawn with respect to a possible effect on OS although pembrolizumab is 
not expected to be associated with a detrimental effect with respect to OS. 
As repeatedly observed with anti-PD(L)1 vs chemotherapy, an initial crossing of KM overall survival 
curves up to month 8 is seen, after that point curves diverge (about 5-10% difference in favour of 
pembrolizumab arm). Hazard rates were greater in the pembrolizumab arm compared with the SOC arm 
for the first 4 months. Baseline characteristics of the 32 participants (19 in the pembrolizumab group and 
13 in the SOC group) with early OS events within the first 4 months showed the largest difference 
between treatment groups included presence of hepatic or pulmonary metastases, age over 70 and high 
baseline CEA value, occurred in a higher proportion of participants in the pembrolizumab group. However, 
due to the limited number of patients, it is not possible to clearly define one or more characteristics as 
risk factors of early death with pembrolizumab. Text in the SmPC section 4.4 reporting that “in KEYNOTE-
177, the hazard rates for overall survival events were greater for pembrolizumab compared with 
chemotherapy for the first 4 months of treatment, followed by a long-term survival benefit for 
pembrolizumab” has been added.      
The MAH agreed to include interim OS analysis data in the SmPC and in the EPAR. Final OS analysis for 
KEYNOTE-177 will be submitted by the MAH (estimated Q3 2021) as Annex II condition to confirm interim 
OS data.  
An advantage in PFS2 further support that pembrolizumab is not expected to be associated with a 
detrimental effect with respect to subsequent therapies (HR 0.63, 95%CI 0.45, 0.88).  
ORR was a key secondary endpoint, adjusted for multiplicity. Statistical significance was not reached, 
however. ORR was also in favour of pembrolizumab compared to the standard chemotherapy: 43.8% 
(95% CI: 35.8, 52.0) vs 33.1% (95% CI: 25.8, 41.1), including higher CR rate (11.1% versus 3.9%). On 
the contrary, pembrolizumab more rarely induced disease stabilization, and progressive disease as best 
response were more than doubled with pembrolizumab than with chemotherapy (29.4% vs 12.3%).

Withdrawal from study treatment was the main cause of the higher number of patients in the SOC 
compared to pembrolizumab arm not having the first radiological assessment. 
By looking at the waterfall plot, it seems that the maximum target lesion change (both tumour increase 
and reduction) is more pronounced with pembrolizumab. Patients who responded to pembrolizumab have 
generally long duration of response (median DOR not reached in the pembrolizumab group vs 10.6 
months in the SOC group), as also shown by a relevant proportion of patients who responded to 
pembrolizumab reaching DOR ≥12 months (85.1% vs 43.8%). As observed in other indications, 
pembrolizumab seems to induce prolonged and deep responses in patients who responded, but if patients 
did not respond the disease is rarely controlled and patient progress, which is also probably also linked to 
the early crossing of the KM OS/PFS curves.  
Patients were allowed to undergo resection of primary tumour or metastases with curative intent if 
deemed eligible after responding to treatment. The possibility to be treated with curative intent after 
systemic treatment-induced response is considered clinically relevant as this can result in long term 
survival. The MAH clarified that a total of 13 patients underwent curative surgery in the SOC arm, vs 14 
patients in the pembrolizumab arm. It is concluded that, despite a higher objective response rate and 
apparently deeper response achieved in the pembrolizumab arm compared to SOC, disappointingly the 
possibility to undergo curative surgery with pembrolizumab treatment did not seem to increase.  
No significant deterioration in health status is observed with pembrolizumab, with a trend toward 
improvement in QoL and most of the functioning and symptoms score compared to SOC. Overall, PRO 
data are supporting the benefit of pembrolizumab over the chemotherapy regimens in KEYNOTE-177 
study in terms of efficacy and safety. However, the open-label design of the study and the lack of 
multiplicity control does not allowt upholding formal superiority claims. PROs data have not been included 
in the SmPC.  
Subgroup analyses showed overall consistent results with the exception of subgroups by metastatic 
sites and mutational status.  
Based upon ad-hoc exploratory sub-group analyses, patients with hepatic and/or pulmonary metastases 
seem to achieve less benefit from pembrolizumab vs chemotherapy compared to a clearer advantage in 
patients with metastases other than hepatic and pulmonary. In particular, this seems to be observed in 
subjects with lung metastases: as the only site of metastases (15 vs 19, ca. 10% of the randomized 
patient population (PFS 1.02, OS 1.99), or with other sites (36 vs 34, ca. 23% of patients, PFS 1.13, OS 
1.05, ORR 25% vs 41.2%). It is acknowledged that the concern regarding a reduced efficacy in patients 
with lung metastases is based on a limited dataset of only 34 patients and that conclusions based on this 
sample size are prone to uncertainties. In view of this, it can be considered acceptable that information 
on the uncertain benefit for patients with lung metastases are not to be included in the SmPC. 
Nevertheless, there is a common observation that patients with more advanced disease with high tumour 
burden may not have sufficient time to respond on immunotherapeutics (20% of the patients with lung 
metastases died in the first 4 month in KEYNOTE-177). The inclusion of OS KM curves in section 5.1 as 
well as text in section 4.4 of the SmPC (see above) are considered appropriate.  
The benefit of pembrolizumab over SOC seems somewhat more limited in RAS mutant disease compared 
to wild type tumours. In the subgroup KRAS/NRAS mutant (n=74), no advantage of pembrolizumab over 
SOC was apparent in PFS (HR 1.19). For OS (HR 0.89) KM curves are overlapping until month 24 (after 
this point they seem to diverge in favour of pembrolizumab but there are too many censored patients), 
but no detriment is observed (HR 0.89), and ORR was also similar. Limitations in the interpretation of 
subgroup analyses are acknowledged, also related to small number of patients in some subgroups, and

the lack of information on mutational status in 30% of subjects. Further, a multivariate Cox regression 
analysis of PFS suggested interaction between treatment and RAS status.   
Higher tumour burden may confer worse prognosis in line with historical data in mCRC. Benefit of 
pembrolizumab over chemotherapy was seen regardless of tumour burden but much more pronounced in 
smaller tumours. Patients with prior radiation therapy seem not to benefit from pembrolizumab 
monotherapy treatment, but number of patients was too low (11 vs 13) to draw conclusion. 
Pembrolizumab improved PFS and OS over SOC regardless having or not received prior neoadjuvant 
treatment.  
Heterogeneity has been suggested in MSI-H/dMMR CRC based on MSI aetiology. A benefit of 
pembrolizumab over SOC is however seen also in the small subgroup of patients with Lynch syndrome. 
A trend toward more limited efficacy of pembrolizumab compared to SOC is seen in older patients 
compared to younger ones (≤65 vs >65, ≤75 vs >75). For patients over 75 years of age (n=50), 
pembrolizumab and SOC seems to perform similarly in OS, PFS and ORR. The pembrolizumab safety 
profile could however represent an advantage over SOC in this aged population (lower incidence of drug-
related AEs, G3-5 AEs, drug-related G3-5 AEs, drug-related SAE and discontinuation due to drug-related 
SAE is reported in pembrolizumab compared to SOC arm in patients ≥75, see safety section). The MAH 
has reflected in the SmPC section 4.2 the fact that that a limited number of patients >75 have been 
included in KN-177 study.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Pembrolizumab demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS 
compared to SOC chemotherapies as first line treatment for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer 
MSI-H/dMMR in KEYNOTE-177 study. During the procedure, the MAH updated the indication to include 
“metastatic” patients only to reflect the studied population. The benefit of pembrolizumab was supported 
by PFS sensitivity analyses. Although not statistically significant, a trend toward OS advantage in 
pembrolizumab treated patients, analysed at an interim analysis having a reasonable maturity level, is 
considered supportive of the PFS results, notwithstanding the crossing of the OS KM curves, as seen in 
several studies of anti-PD(L)1 antibodies. An advantage in PFS2 further support the data. Increased ORR 
is seen, although not statistically significant, but CR rate is higher and responses appear durable.  
The MAH agreed to submit the final OS analysis for KEYNOTE-177 as part of the final CSR when available 
(estimated Q3 2021) as an Annex II condition in the Product Information in order to confirm interim OS 
data.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Pembrolizumab monotherapy safety data presented in the current submission are from the randomized, 
controlled, open-label Phase 3 study KEYNOTE-177, which is the pivotal study supporting the intended 
use of pembrolizumab for the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic MSI-H or 
dMMR CRC. Safety analyses are presented by the treatment group (pembrolizumab vs investigator’s 
choice of SOC chemotherapy, consisting in either mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI or respective combinations with 
bevacizumab or cetuximab) in participant who received treatment (ASaT population, n=153 in 
pembrolizumab and n=143 in SOC arm,) up to the data cutoff date of 19-FEB-2020. Adverse events were 
graded according to the NCI CTCAE, version 4.03. AEs were coded using MedDRA Version 22.1.

In addition, the new pembrolizumab safety data from KEYNOTE-177 have been compared to the 
established safety profile for pembrolizumab monotherapy from the Reference Safety Dataset. Thus, the 
following 4 datasets are presented side by side: 
1.  KEYNOTE-177 Dataset - Pembrolizumab (N=153): Participants with unresectable or metastatic MSI-
H/dMMR CRC, who received pembrolizumab in KEYNOTE-177.  
2.  KEYNOTE-177 Dataset - SOC (N=143): Participants with unresectable or metastatic MSI-H/dMMR 
CRC who received SOC therapy in KEYNOTE-177. 
3.  Pembrolizumab Monotherapy Reference Safety Dataset (N = 5884): includes participants who 
received pembrolizumab in the following populations and studies: melanoma (n=2076) in KEYNOTE-
001, KEYNOTE-002, KEYNOTE-006 and KEYNOTE-054; NSCLC (n=2022) in KEYNOTE-001, KEYNOTE-
002, KEYNOTE-006, KEYNOTE-010, KEYNOTE-024 and KEYNOTE-42; HNSCC (n=909) in KEYNOTE-
012, KEYNOTE-040, KEYNOTE-048 and KEYNOTE-055; HL (n=241) in KEYNOTE-013 and KEYNOTE-
087; Bladder (n=636) in KEYNOTE-045 and KEYNOTE-052. This dataset represents the established 
safety profile for pembrolizumab. 
4.  Cumulative Running Pembrolizumab Monotherapy Safety Dataset (N=8098): Cumulative 
pembrolizumab safety data from all studies reported to a regulatory authority for which a submission 
occurred at least 6 weeks prior to the database lock date for KEYNOTE-177. Participants from 
KEYNOTE-177 (pembrolizumab arm), the RSD, and participants treated with pembrolizumab in 
KEYNOTE-012 Cohorts B and B2 (HNSCC), Cohort C (Urothelial Tract Cancer) and Cohort D (Gastric 
Cancer), KEYNOTE-013 Cohort 3 (Hodgkin Lymphoma), KEYNOTE-013 Cohort 4A (PMBCL), KEYNOTE-
017, KEYNOTE-024, KEYNOTE-028 Cohort A4 (Esophageal Cancer), Cohort B4 (Cervical Cancer) and 
Cohort C1 (SCLC), KEYNOTE-040, KEYNOTE-042, KEYNOTE-045, KEYNOTE-048, KEYNOTE-052, 
KEYNOTE-054, KEYNOTE-055, KEYNOTE-057, KEYNOTE-059 Cohort 1 (Gastric Cancer), KEYNOTE-
062, KEYNOTE-087, KEYNOTE-158 Cohort E (Cervical Cancer) and Cohort G (SCLC), KEYNOTE-158 
with TMB-H, KEYNOTE-164 Cohort A (CRC), KEYNOTE-170, KEYNOTE-180, KEYNOTE-181, KEYNOTE-
224, and KEYNOTE-427. 
Statistical Methods for Key Safety Analyses: The analysis of safety results followed a tiered approach.  
“Tier 1” safety endpoints were subject to inferential testing for statistical significance with p-values and 
95% CI provided for between-group comparisons. Other safety parameters were considered Tier 2 or Tier 
3. Tier 2 parameters were assessed via point estimates with 95% CI for between-group comparisons; 
only point estimates by treatment group are provided for Tier 3 safety parameters. There are no Tier 1 
events in KEYNOTE-177 study. The between-treatment difference were analyzed using the Miettinen and 
Nurminen method.

 Duration of Exposure is calculated as last dose date - first dose date + 1. 
Safety populations: distribution of gender, race, and ECOG performance status were generally similar 
across the KEYNOTE-177 pembrolizumab safety dataset and the SOC Safety Dataset. Compared with the 
RSD, the KEYNOTE-177 pembrolizumab safety dataset had a lower proportion of male participants and a 
greater proportion of EU participants.

All AEs leading to a fatal outcome were reported in a single participant. In the pembrolizumab arm: 
abdominal sepsis, death, diarrhoea, duodenal perforation, failure to thrive, pseudobulbar palsy; in the 
SOC arm: aortic dissection, aspiration, cardiac arrest, cholangitis, intestinal perforation, pulmonary 
embolism, upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage. None of the deaths were attributed to a drug-related AEs 
by investigator, vs one death considered due to a drug-related AE in the SOC arm.  
Additionally, 3 subjects in the pembrolizumab crossover phase experienced AEs leading to death: 
recurrent lung carcinoma, pulmonary embolism, respiratory failure. All AEs leading to death were 
considered not related to pembrolizumab by the investigator.        
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AEOSI) 
The analysis of AEOSIs is the primary method of assessing immune-related AEs (irAEs) and infusion-
related reactions for this study. The frequency and maximum severity of AEOSI analyses are based on a 
predefined list of preferred AE terms deemed clinically consistent with the identified risks of 
pembrolizumab (AEOSIs) and potentially associated with an immune etiology. This list was developed by 
the Sponsor and includes AEOSI terms identified to allow consistent assessment of AEOSIs across 
pembrolizumab studies. The list of terms is updated periodically based on emerging pembrolizumab 
safety data.

Table: time to onset and duration of AEOSI colitis 
Out of the 10 participants with colitis events in the KEYNOTE-177 pembrolizumab safety dataset, 8 were 
treated with systemic corticosteroids (vs 58% in the RSD).  
As of the data cutoff date, 9 of 10 participants with colitis AEOSIs had resolved events. One participant 
had an unresolved Grade 1 event; however, this participant experienced disease progression resulting in 
the participant’s death.    
Laboratory findings 
In KEYNOTE-177, the only laboratory test that was >10% points higher in the pembrolizumab group 
relative to the SOC group was blood bilirubin increased, with most of the toxicities being Grade 1 or 2.  
The incidence of laboratory abnormalities with clinically meaningful (Grade 3 to 4 events) worsening from 
baseline was similar in the pembrolizumab safety dataset compared with the SOC safety dataset, except 
for lower rates (≥10% lower incidence) of neutrophils decreased reported in the pembrolizumab safety 
dataset compared with the SOC safety dataset (2.7% vs 34.5%), known to be associated with cytotoxic 
chemotherapies.  
The incidences of laboratory abnormalities with clinically meaningful worsening from baseline in the 
KEYNOTE-177 pembrolizumab safety dataset were generally consistent with the RSD.  
None of the participants in KEYNOTE-177 (in either arm) had laboratory values that satisfied the protocol-
specified criteria for potential drug-induced liver injury.

Immunogenicity 
No new immunogenicity data are available. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
As pembrolizumab is an IgG antibody that is administered parenterally and cleared by catabolism, food 
and DDI are not anticipated to influence exposure. Drugs that affect the cytochrome P450 and other 
metabolizing enzymes, are not expected to interfere with the metabolism of an IgG antibody.  
Studies evaluating PD drug interactions with pembrolizumab have not been conducted. No relationship 
was observed between prolonged use of systemic corticosteroids and pembrolizumab exposure. 
Nevertheless, given the study design, exclusion criteria, and immunomodulatory mechanism of action, 
the use of systemic corticosteroids (at doses greater than physiologic replacement), or other 
immunosuppressants before the start of pembrolizumab treatment, is not recommended, but can be used 
to treat immune-related adverse reactions.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Treatment discontinuation 
In the KEYNOTE-177 safety dataset, discontinuation due to AE (all causality) occurred in 21 (13.7%) vs 
17 (11.9%) patients in pembrolizumab vs SOC arm, respectively. After adjustment for exposure, the 
incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation remained consistent in the KEYNOTE-177 pembrolizumab 
safety dataset relative to the SOC safety dataset (11.58 vs 16.37 events/100 person-years).  
The proportion of participants who experienced AEs leading to pembrolizumab discontinuation in the 
KEYNOTE-177 pembrolizumab safety dataset (13.7%) was consistent with the RSD (13.3%)   
The incidence of drug-related AEs leading to treatment discontinuation 9.8% (15 patients) in the 
KEYNOTE-177 pembrolizumab safety dataset and 5.6% (8 patients) in the SOC safety dataset. After 
adjustment for exposure, the incidence of drug-related AEs leading to treatment discontinuation was 
similar in the pembrolizumab safety dataset relative to the SOC safety dataset (8.27 vs 8.19 events/100 
person-years). The drug-related AEs leading to treatment discontinuation in the pembrolizumab arm 
were: Autoimmune colitis, Colitis, Hepatitis, Alanine aminotransferase increased (2 patients each), 
Autoimmune hepatitis, Immune-mediated hepatitis, Aspartate aminotransferase increased, Hypophysitis, 
Acute kidney injury, Pneumonitis, Psoriasis (1 patient each).  
The proportion of participants who experienced drug-related AEs leading to pembrolizumab 
discontinuation in the KEYNOTE-177 pembrolizumab safety dataset (9.8%) was generally consistent with 
the RSD (6.9%). Compared to the RSD, a higher frequency of discontinuation due to gastrointestinal and 
hepatic events was observed. After adjustment for exposure, the incidence of drug-related AEs leading to 
discontinuation remained similar in the KEYNOTE-177 pembrolizumab safety dataset relative to the RSD 
(8.27 vs 11.35 events/100 person-years).  
Treatment interruption 
A lower proportion of participants in the KEYNOTE-177 pembrolizumab safety dataset experienced an AE 
as well as drug-related AEs resulting in treatment interruption than in the SOC safety dataset (AEs: 
37.9% vs 69.2%; drug-related AEs 22.9% vs 58.7%).  
Compared to the RSD, the proportion of participants who experienced AEs and drug-related AEs leading 
to treatment interruption in the KEYNOTE-177 pembrolizumab safety dataset was higher than the RSD 
(AEs: 37.9% vs 25.2%; drug-related AEs: 22.9% vs 14.2%).  
Drug-related AEs leading to treatment interruption that occurred more frequently (≥2% difference) in the 
KEYNOTE-177 pembrolizumab safety dataset versus the RSD were aspartate aminotransferase increased 
(3.3% vs 0.7%), diarrhea (3.3% vs 1.4%), and colitis (2.6% vs 0.5%).  
Safety in Participants Who Crossed Over to Pembrolizumab Monotherapy 
There were 56 participants from the SOC group who crossed over to pembrolizumab monotherapy within 
the study. Of the 56 participants who crossed over to pembrolizumab, 94.6% experienced at least 1 AE 
after  initiating  crossover  treatment.  The  incidences  of  drug-related  AEs,  drug-related  Grade  3  to  5  AEs, 
SAEs,  and  drug-related  SAEs  were  similar  to  those  in  the  pembrolizumab  group  in  the  initial  treatment 
phase.  
Review of listings of events in participants who crossed over to pembrolizumab did not identify any new 
safety  concerns.  The  summary  safety  data  observed  for  participants  who  crossed  over  from  SOC  to

pembrolizumab treatment were generally consistent with the summary AE data in the pembrolizumab group 
in the initial treatment phase.

Post marketing experience 
The safety profile of pembrolizumab was summarized in the PSUR (period from 04-SEP-2018-03 to SEP-
2019). There are no records of any pembrolizumab registration being revoked or withdrawn for safety 
reasons in any country. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The evaluation of the safety profile of pembrolizumab in the sought extension of indication for Keytruda 
as first line treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic MSI-H or dMMR colorectal cancer is 
based on the pivotal phase III study KEYNOTE-177 IA2 results (n=153 patients in the pembrolizumab 
group vs n=143 patients in the SOC chemotherapy mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI or respective combinations 
with bevacizumab or cetuximab). Data have been presented side by side with the Reference Safety 
Dataset (RSD, n=5884) and the Cumulative Running Pembrolizumab Monotherapy Safety Dataset 
(N=8098), in order to assess the consistency of the pembrolizumab monotherapy safety in the intended 
indication with its already established safety profile in the other indications.  
Median exposure to treatment was longer for the pembrolizumab group than for the SOC group (11.1 vs 
5.7 months). It was also longer compared to the RSD (11.1 vs 4.9 months), with more than twice the 
median number of administrations in KN177 (median 16 vs 8). Patients exposed to pembrolizumab ≥12 
months were 47.7% in KN177, vs 20.3% in the RSD.   
Regarding the summary of adverse events, pembrolizumab treatment was generally well-tolerated 
when compared to SOC treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/33664/2021 
Page 89/100 
 
 
  
  
 
The overall incidence of AEs was similar in pembrolizumab (97.4%) and SOC safety datasets (99.3%), as 
well as in the RSD (96.5%). The most frequent (>20% incidence) AEs in the KN177 pembrolizumab arm 
were diarrhoea, fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, decreased appetite and vomiting. Diarrhoea, nausea 
and fatigue were also the most common ARs in the SOC arm, although at higher frequency (>50%). On 
the contrary, AEs with a ≥10% point difference in KN177 pembrolizumab compared with the SOC group 
were arthralgia, hypothyroidism, and blood alkaline phosphatase increased. When compared to the 
established pembrolizumab safety profile of the RSD, AEs more frequently (≥10% point difference) 
reported in the KN177 pembrolizumab safety dataset than RSD were diarrhoea (44.4% vs 20.3%), 
abdominal pain (24.2% vs 8.1%), and nausea (30.7% vs 20.4%). Higher rates of diarrhoea and 
abdominal pain compared to RSD are still observed after adjusting for exposure. Overall, the above 
events appear more commonly reported in both arms of KN177 study; they can be considered expected 
in patients with colon cancer.  
The incidence of grade 3-5 AEs was lower in the KEYNOTE-177 pembrolizumab compared with the SOC 
safety dataset (56.2% vs 77.6%), which was driven by the higher incidences of haematological toxicities 
in the chemotherapy arm. But it was higher when compared to the RSD (48.7%). However, the difference 
between pembrolizumab in KN177 and in RSD is no more evident after adjusting for exposure. The most 
common G3-5 AEs was hypertension (7.2%, vs 4.9% in the SOC and 1.7% in the RSD). The MAH stated 
that all participants with a reported event of G3-5 hypertension had a medical history of hypertension at 
the time of enrolment. In addition, the frequency of hypertension is markedly lower at 0.7%, lower than 
the SOC (4.2%) and in line with the RSD (0.2%) when treatment-related G3-5 AEs are considered. This 
is reassuring.  
The most frequently (>10%) reported drug-related AEs in KN177 pembrolizumab arm were diarrhoea, 
fatigue, pruritus, nausea, AST increased, rash, arthralgia and hypothyroidism. Among them, diarrhoea, 
fatigue and nausea were detected at higher incidence in the SOC arm. Diarrhoea was the drug-related AR 
reported more frequently (>10% point difference) in the KN177 pembrolizumab safety dataset vs the 
RSD (24.8% vs 10.7%). Diarrhoea, colitis, ALT increase and fatigue were the most commonly reported 
G3-5 drug-related AEs (2% each) in the KN177 pembrolizumab arm; all were more common in KN177 
than in the RSD, and colitis and ALT increase were also more frequent than in the SOC arm (0% and 
0.7% respectively).  
Incidence of SAE was lower in the pembrolizumab than in the SOC arm of KN177 study (40.5% vs 
52.4%) and in line with the RSD (38.3%). The most frequently reported (>2%) SAEs in the KN177 
pembrolizumab safety dataset were abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and pyrexia. Abdominal pain was higher 
in the KN177 pembrolizumab safety dataset (4.6%) compared to SOC (1.4%) as well as to 
pembrolizumab RSD (0.6%). The MAH stated that medical review of abdominal pain events indicate that 
these AEs were associated with the underlying colon cancer disease. Diarrhoea was on the contrary less 
common in the pembrolizumab than in the SOC arm (2.6% vs 6.3%), but higher compared to the RSD 
(0.6%).  
The overall incidence of drug-related SAE in the KN177 pembrolizumab safety dataset was lower 
compared with the SOC safety dataset (16.3% vs 28.7%). On the contrary, when compared to RSD the 
incidence in KN177 was slightly higher (16.3% vs 11.3%), but this trend reversed when adjusted for 
exposure (rate 16.34 vs 24.13). The most common drug-related SAE was colitis (2%, in 3 patients), 
followed by acute kidney injury, autoimmune colitis, diarrhoea, hepatitis and pyrexia (1.3%, 2 patients 
each). Colitis was not reported in the SOC, and it was reported at higher incidence than in the RSD (2% 
vs 0.9% for colitis, 1.3% vs 0% for autoimmune colitis).  
As expected, the overall incidence of AEOSI was higher in the KN177 pembrolizumab compared with the 
SOC safety dataset (30.7% vs 12.6%), the most common (≥2% incidence) being hypothyroidism, colitis, 
hyperthyroidism, pneumonitis, adrenal insufficiency, hepatitis, and infusion reactions. The frequency of 
Assessment report

AEOSI was higher for pembrolizumab-treated patients in KN177 compared to RSD (30.7% vs 24.9%), but 
it is reassuring that this trend reverted when adjusted for exposure (rate 35.85 vs 53.39). While the most 
common AEOSI was hypothyroidism in both pembrolizumab KN177 arm and RSD at a similar frequency 
(12.4% vs 10.7%), it can be observed an higher incidence of colitis (6.5% vs 2%), adrenal insufficiency 
(2.6% vs 0.8%) and hepatitis (2.6% vs 1%) in KN177 pembrolizumab arm than in RSD. When adjusted 
for exposure, the above differences tended to be reduced. Most of the AEOSI were grade 1 and 2, with no 
fatal AEOSI reported. Approximately half of the AEOSI were not resolved as of the data cut-off date. The 
highest rate of not-resolved AEOSI was hypothyroidism, as expected due to long term hormone thyroid 
replacement.  
Treatment discontinuation due to AEs (all causality and drug related) were more frequently reported in 
the pembrolizumab arm compared to patients receiving chemotherapy in the SOC arm, as well as 
compared to pembrolizumab RSD (discontinuation due to drug-related AE: 9.8% vs 5.6% vs 6.9%, 
respectively). However, after adjusting for exposure, discontinuations in the pembrolizumab KN177 arm 
were lower than the other two datasets. Of the 15 patients who discontinued pembrolizumab due to drug 
related AEs, 13 were due to gastrointestinal and hepatic events.  
The proportion of participants with AEs resulting in death was similar in the KN177 pembrolizumab and 
SOC safety datasets (6 participants [3.9%] vs 7 participants [4.9%]). Additionally, 3 deaths were 
reported in patients receiving pembrolizumab in the crossover phase. None of the deaths were considered 
related to pembrolizumab by investigator. Clarifications have been requested regarding two AEs leading 
to death: for the first one “pseudobulbar palsy”, the MAH stated that pseudobulbar palsy is impacted by 
the confounding factor of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, although this diagnosis is not included in the past 
medical history and it is unclear whether this diagnosis was made during the study. With regard to a 
subjects who died due to aggravating diarrhoea “without infection focus”, from a regulatory and 
retrospective perspective, it appears that the patient experienced autoimmune hepatitis, worsening of 
pre-existing autoimmune disease (psoriasis) and very likely also immune-related colitis, the latter 
however was not further investigated (e.g. colonoscopy) and no immunosuppressive therapy was 
initiated, so this cannot be finally determined. Nonetheless, the MAH’s interpretation that this event is 
unlikely related to pembrolizumab is not shared. The omission of further diagnostic and therapeutic 
intervention during the course of non-infectious, aggravating and finally fatal diarrhoea remains 
worrisome and underlines that physicians’ awareness of the risk of potential autoimmune colitis appears 
clinically relevant (see colitis below).  
The MAH performed a separate analysis for the events of colitis. In the pembrolizumab KN177 arm 10 
patients experienced colitis (6.5%), vs none in the SOC arm. The incidence of colitis was higher also 
compared to the RSD (2%). Half (n=5) of the colitis events were G3-4, which is however similar to what 
observed in the RSD (60% were G3-4) (but when taking into account G4 only events these are more 
common in KN177 study). Difference remains after adjusting for exposure although less pronounced, but 
still incidences of all grade and severe colitis are about 50% higher for patients with CRC than in the RSD. 
On one side, it might not be fully appropriate to argue the clinical relevance of higher colitis AEs away by 
referring to the lower differences in exposure-adjusted event rates (since most of the AEs overall are 
expected to occur during the early treatment phase). On the other side, the longer exposure could be 
important in the incidence of colitis, taking into account that the median time to onset of colitis was 
approximately 6 months (range 3 to 18 months). Four G4 colitis events were considered treatment-
related SAEs, and colitis led to pembrolizumab discontinuation in four patients. The median duration was 
about 2.4 months (range 15 days to 1 year). Corticosteroids were administered in 8/10 cases. It is 
reassuring that in 9/10 patients, colitis was resolved at the cut-off date. The argument that the role of 
metastatic CRC as a risk factor for colitis is unclear is understood. Nonetheless, while colitis is a known 
AEOSI to pembrolizumab already included in the SmPC, higher incidences were observed for 
pembrolizumab in Study KEYNOTE-177 compared to the RSD, and physicians should be informed about 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/33664/2021 
Page 91/100 
 
 
  
  
this. Awareness might be especially relevant in the context of the underlying disease, since clinical 
symptoms of colitis might be more easily misinterpreted (and remain untreated). The observed 
incidences of all grade and Grade 3-5 colitis events in patients with CRC in KEYNOTE-177 has been 
included by the MAH in the SmPC section 4.8, immune-related colitis.  
The MAH was requested to discuss hepatic toxicity. In the KN177 pembrolizumab arm, among the 
AEOSI, 4 patients experienced hepatitis (2.6%), all grade 3 and all leading to treatment discontinuation. 
Reassuringly, all the 4 events of hepatitis resolved at the data cut-off date. In the RSD, the incidence of 
hepatitis was lower (1%), but when adjusted for exposure, hepatitis was similar between pembrolizumab 
arm in KN-177 and RSD (all grades and grade 3-5). Hepatitis is a known AEOSI associated to 
pembrolizumab and reported in the SmPC. None of the participants in KN177 (in either arm) had 
laboratory values that satisfied the protocol-specified criteria for potential drug-induced liver injury, 
however participants in the KEYNOTE-177 pembrolizumab safety dataset compared with the RSD 
reported a higher frequency of ALT increased (14.4% vs 6.6%), AST increased (15.7% vs 6.5%), and 
blood bilirubin increased (4.6% vs 2.1%). When adjusted for exposure, the difference was overall 
comparable. The incidence of liver investigation abnormalities does not seem to be related with the liver 
metastases. Based on the overall data, no change in the SmPC is warranted.  
No major concerns are raised based on the analysis of safety by subgroups based on intrinsic factors 
(age, sex, ECOG).  
A higher incidence (≥12% point) of Grade 3 to 5 AEs and SAEs was noted in the ≥65 years age group of 
the KEYNOTE-177 pembrolizumab safety dataset compared to the participants <65 years of age. A less 
pronounced difference was observed between the age groups in the RSD. However, AE incidences for 
pembrolizumab in the higher age group did not exceed the rates of those in the SOC arm. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of pembrolizumab remains unchanged and no new safety concerns were 
identified in the KEYNOTE-177 study. Pembrolizumab showed a favourable safety overall relative to 
polychemotherapy SOC, with a different AE profile as expected.  
Compared to the known safety profile of pembrolizumab in RSD, in some cases a trend toward worse 
toxicity and higher rate of discontinuations were observed in the CRC MSI-H pembrolizumab treated 
population of KN177. However, in most cases this appears to be due to the longer exposure, which was 
almost doubled in the KN177 dataset compared to RSD, as shown based on exposure-adjusted safety 
analyses. The safety profile of pembrolizumab was characterized by an increased gastrointestinal toxicity, 
especially diarrhoea and abdominal pain, compared to the known pembrolizumab safety profile. The 
incidence of immune-related colitis observed in CRC patients in KEYNOTE-177 study is included in the 
SmPC section 4.8.

2.7.  Changes to the Product Information 
As  a  result  of  this  variation,  section(s)  4.1,  4.2,  4.4,  4.8  and  5.1  of  the  SmPC  are  being  updated.  The 
Package Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly. 
Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The changes to the package leaflet are limited; in particular, the key messages for the safe use of the 
medicinal product are not impacted. Furthermore, the design, layout and format of the package leaflet 
will not be affected by the proposed revisions. Therefore, these proposed revisions do not constitute 
Assessment report

significant changes that would require the need to conduct a new user consultation or abridged focus 
testing.  
2.7.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(3) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Keytruda (pembrolizumab) has been removed 
from the additional monitoring list with the renewal procedure five years after the Union reference date. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The final indication is “KEYTRUDA as monotherapy is indicated for the first-line treatment of metastatic 
microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) colorectal cancer in adults” 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Combination chemotherapy in the form of FOLFOX (oxaliplatin, 5-FU, and leucovorin/folinic acid) or 
FOLFIRI (irinotecan, 5-FU, and leucovorin/folinic acid) has been established as first-line SOC 
chemotherapy options for metastatic CRC and may be used interchangeably depending on the physician’s 
recommendation and regional preference.  
The treatment of mCRC patients should be seen as a continuum of care in which the determination of the 
goals of the treatment is important: prolongation of survival, cure, improving tumour-related symptoms, 
stopping tumour progression and/or maintaining quality of life15.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
KEYNOTE-177 is an ongoing, two-arm, multicenter, international, randomized, open-label, controlled 
study of pembrolizumab monotherapy vs standard chemotherapy in participants with Stage IV MSI-
H/dMMR CRC. The dual primary objectives of the study are PFS per RECIST 1.1 by BICR and OS. A total 
of 307 participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W (n=153) or 
investigator’s choice of SOC (6 regimens allowed: mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI alone or in combination with 
bevacizumab or cetuximab) (n=154).  
The MAH submitted the Interim Analysis 2 (i.e. final PFS and interim OS analysis) results with data cutoff 
date of 19-FEB-2020 (median survival follow-up 27 months). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
•  Statistically significant and clinically relevant PFS advantage of pembrolizumab vs SOC: HR 0.60 
(95%CI 0.45, 0.80), p=0.0002, median PFS 16.5 (95%CI 5.4, 32.4) vs 8.2 (95%CI 6.1, 10.2) 
months. Kaplan-Meier PFS curves demonstrate an increasingly pronounced separation after month 6

(PFS rate at 12 months 55.3% vs 37.3%, PFS rate at 24 months 48.3% vs 18.6%). PFS results were 
consistent across sensitivity analyses. 
•  A favourable OS trend was observed: HR 0.77 (95% CI 0.54, 1.09), p=0.0694, median OS NR vs 
34.8 months (95%CI 26.3, NR). 
•  A trend toward higher ORR with pembrolizumab compared to SOC was seen [43.8% (95% CI: 35.8, 
52.0) vs 33.1% (95% CI: 25.8, 41.1], including higher CR rate (11.1% versus 3.9%). 
•  Durable responses with pembrolizumab compared to SOC: median DOR NR in the pembrolizumab vs 
10.6 months in the SOC group, proportion of patients with DOR ≥12 months 85.1% vs 43.8%. 
• 
• 
PFS2 advantage is seen with pembrolizumab compared to SOC (HR 0.63, 95%CI 0.45, 0.88). 
Trend toward improvement in QoL and most of the functioning and symptoms score in the 
pembrolizumab arm compared to SOC, supporting the overall efficacy and safety data.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
•  A crossing of the OS KM curves up to month 8, with greater Hazard rates in the pembrolizumab arm 
compared  with  the  SOC  arm  for  the  first  4  months,  is  observed.  Number  of  patients  is  too  small  to 
firmly identify risk factors of early death. Text in the SmPC section 4.4 reporting that “in Keynote-177, 
the  hazard  rates  for  overall  survival  events  were  greater  for  pembrolizumab  compared  with 
chemotherapy  for  the  first  4  months  of  treatment,  followed  by  a  long-term  survival  benefit  for 
pembrolizumab” has been added, and OS KM curves are shown in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
•  Similar efficacy of pembrolizumab and SOC is observed, but with better safety profile in patients 
beyond the age of 75 years. Data in this age group is however limited. This is reflected in the SmPC. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
•  Drug-related AEs were reported in 79.7% of pembrolizumab treated MSI-H CRC patients in KN177 
study. The most commonly (>10%) observed drug-related AEs were diarrhoea (24.8%), fatigue 
(20.9%), pruritus (13.7%), nausea (12.1%), AST increased (11.1%), rash (11.1%), arthralgia 
(10.5%) and hypothyroidism (10.5%).  
•  Drug-related G3-5 AEs occurred in 21.6% of subjects, being ALT increase, colitis, diarrhoea and 
fatigue the most frequent (2% each).  
• 
The incidence of drug-related SAEs was 16.3%, with colitis as the most frequent (2%). 
•  AEOSI occurred in 30.7% of patients, most common being hypothyroidism (12.4%) and colitis 
(6.5%).   
•  Drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation of pembrolizumab in 9.8% (n=15) of patients. 
Autoimmune colitis, Colitis, Hepatitis and ALT increase cause discontinuation of treatment in 2 
patients each.   
•  Compared to the known pembrolizumab safety profile, an increased frequency of gastrointestinal 
toxicity, in particular diarrhoea and abdominal pain, as well as a higher incidence of the AEOSI colitis 
was evident in KN177. The argument that the role of metastatic CRC as a risk factor for colitis is 
unclear is understood. Difference in incidence of colitis between arms is reduced when adjusted for 
exposure, but still awareness might be especially relevant in the context of the underlying disease, 
since clinical symptoms of colitis might be more easily misinterpreted (and remain untreated). The

Notes: 
3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In the open-label study KEYNOTE-177, pembrolizumab demonstrated a statistically significant and 
clinically meaningful PFS benefit for patients with metastatic MSI-H/ dMMR mCRC. The median PFS in the 
pembrolizumab arm was almost doubled compared to the SOC arm, with a gain of about 8 months.  
OS curves showed initial crossing with greater hazard rates in the pembrolizumab arm compared with the 
SOC arm for the first 4 months. Some imbalances in baseline characteristics of patients who died early in 
the two arms are observed, although the small number of patients prevent to identify risk factors for 
early death with pembrolizumab. OS KM curves in section 5.1 as well as text in section 4.4 of the SmPC 
have been included to inform prescribers.  
Safety analyses broadly confirmed the already well-known and different toxicity profiles of 
pembrolizumab, which compared favourably to polychemotherapy regimens. An increased incidence of GI 
toxicity was on reported, in particular the AEOSI of Colitis. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The efficacy data of pembrolizumab monotherapy as demonstrated in study KEYNOTE-177 support its 
benefit as first line treatment of metastatic MSI-H/dMMR CRC outweighing the established risks of 
treatment. The wording of the indication was updated to include only patients actually enrolled in the 
clinical trial (i.e. metastatic).  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The MAH is requesting to approve the 400 mg Q6W as alternative dose for the sought indication, as done 
for the other pembrolizumab monotherapy indications, which is considered acceptable.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Keytruda is positive.  
The following measures are considered necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
The MAH agreed to submit the final OS analysis for KEYNOTE-177 as part of the final CSR when available 
(estimated Q3 2021), as an Annex II condition in the Product Information in order to confirm interim OS 
data.

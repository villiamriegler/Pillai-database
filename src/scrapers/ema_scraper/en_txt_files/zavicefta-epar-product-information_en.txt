age that have a CrCL < 16 mL/min/1.73 m2.
Hepatic impairment
No dosage adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of Zavicefta in paediatric patients < 3 months old have not been established.
No data are available.
Method of administration
Intravenous use.
Zavicefta is administered by intravenous infusion over 120 minutes in an appropriate infusion volume
(see section 6.6).
For instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration see 
section 6.6.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
Hypersensitivity to any cephalosporin antibacterial agent.
Severe hypersensitivity (e.g. anaphylactic reaction, severe skin reaction) to any other type of β-lactam 
antibacterial agent (e.g. penicillins, monobactams or carbapenems).
6
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Hypersensitivity reactions
Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity reactions are possible (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). In case 
of hypersensitivity reactions, treatment with Zavicefta must be discontinued immediately and adequate 
emergency measures must be initiated.
There have been reports of hypersensitivity reactions which progressed to Kounis syndrome (acute 
allergic coronary arteriospasm that can result in myocardial infarction, see section 4.8).
Before beginning treatment, it should be established whether the patient has a history of 
hypersensitivity reactions to ceftazidime, to other cephalosporins or to any other type of β-lactam 
antibacterial agent. Caution should be used if ceftazidime/avibactam is given to patients with a history 
of non-severe hypersensitivity to penicillins, monobactams or carbapenems.
Clostridioides difficile - associated diarrhoea
Clostridioides difficile - associated diarrhoea has been reported with ceftazidime/avibactam, and can
range in severity from mild to life-threatening. This diagnosis should be considered in patients who 
present with diarrhoea during or subsequent to the administration of Zavicefta (see section 4.8). 
Discontinuation of therapy with Zavicefta and the administration of specific treatment for 
Clostridioides difficile should be considered. Medicinal products that inhibit peristalsis should not be 
given.
Renal impairment
Ceftazidime and avibactam are eliminated via the kidneys, therefore, the dose should be reduced 
according to the degree of renal impairment (see section 4.2). Neurological sequelae, including tremor, 
myoclonus, non-convulsive status epilepticus, convulsion, encephalopathy and coma, have 
occasionally been reported with ceftazidime when the dose has not been reduced in patients with renal 
impairment.
In patients with renal impairment, close monitoring of estimated creatinine clearance is advised. In 
some patients, the creatinine clearance estimated from serum creatinine can change quickly, especially 
early in the course of treatment for the infection.
Nephrotoxicity
Concurrent treatment with high doses of cephalosporins and nephrotoxic medicinal products such as 
aminoglycosides or potent diuretics (e.g. furosemide) may adversely affect renal function.
Direct antiglobulin test (DAGT or Coombs test) seroconversion and potential risk of haemolytic 
anaemia
Ceftazidime/avibactam use may cause development of a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAGT, or 
Coombs test), which may interfere with the cross-matching of blood and/or may cause drug induced 
immune haemolytic anaemia (see section 4.8). While DAGT seroconversion in patients receiving 
Zavicefta was very common in clinical studies (the estimated range of seroconversion across Phase 3 
studies was 3.2% to 20.8% in patients with a negative Coombs test at baseline and at least one 
follow-up test), there was no evidence of haemolysis in patients who developed a positive DAGT on 
treatment. However, the possibility that haemolytic anaemia could occur in association with Zavicefta
treatment cannot be ruled out. Patients experiencing anaemia during or after treatment with Zavicefta
should be investigated for this possibility.
7
Limitations of the clinical data
Clinical efficacy and safety studies of Zavicefta have been conducted in cIAI, cUTI and HAP
(including VAP).
Complicated intra-abdominal infections in adults
In two studies in patients with cIAI, the most common diagnosis (approximately 42%) was 
appendiceal perforation or peri-appendiceal abscess. Approximately 87% of patients had APACHE II 
scores of ≤ 10 and 4% had bacteraemia at baseline. Death occurred in 2.1% (18/857) of patients who 
received Zavicefta and metronidazole and in 1.4% (12/863) of patients who received meropenem.
Among a subgroup with baseline CrCL 30 to 50 mL/min death occurred in 16.7% (9/54) of patients 
who received Zavicefta and metronidazole and 6.8% (4/59) of patients who received meropenem. 
Patients with CrCL 30 to 50 mL/min received a lower dose of Zavicefta than is currently 
recommended for patients in this sub-group.
Complicated urinary tract infections in adults
In two studies in patients with cUTI, 381/1091 (34.9%) patients were enrolled with cUTI without 
pyelonephritis while 710 (65.1%) were enrolled with acute pyelonephritis (mMITT population). A 
total of 81 cUTI patients (7.4%) had bacteraemia at baseline.
Hospital-acquired pneumonia (including ventilator-associated pneumonia) in adults
In a single study in patients with nosocomial pneumonia 280/808 (34.7%) had VAP and 40/808 (5%) 
were bacteraemic at baseline.
Patients with limited treatment options
The use of ceftazidime/avibactam to treat patients with infections due to Gram-negative aerobic 
pathogens who have limited treatment options is based on experience with ceftazidime alone and on 
analyses of the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship for ceftazidime/avibactam (see 
section 5.1).
Spectrum of activity of ceftazidime/avibactam
Ceftazidime has little or no activity against the majority of Gram-positive organisms and anaerobes 
(see sections 4.2 and 5.1). Additional antibacterial agents should be used when these pathogens are 
known or suspected to be contributing to the infectious process. 
The inhibitory spectrum of avibactam includes many of the enzymes that inactivate ceftazidime, 
including Ambler class A β-lactamases and class C β-lactamases. Avibactam does not inhibit class B 
enzymes (metallo-β-lactamases) and is not able to inhibit many of the class D enzymes (see 
section 5.1).
Non-susceptible organisms
Prolonged use may result in the overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms (e.g. enterococci, fungi), 
which may require interruption of treatment or other appropriate measures.
Interference with laboratory tests
Ceftazidime may interfere with copper reduction methods (Benedict's, Fehling's, Clinitest) for 
detection of glycosuria leading to false positive results. Ceftazidime does not interfere with enzyme-
based tests for glycosuria.
8
Controlled sodium diet
This medicinal product contains approximately 146 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 7.3% of the 
WHO recommended maximum daily intake (RDI) of 2 g sodium for an adult.
The maximum daily dose of this product is equivalent to 22% of the WHO recommended maximum 
daily intake for sodium. Zavicefta is considered high in sodium. This should be considered when 
administering Zavicefta to patients who are on a controlled sodium diet.
Zavicefta may be diluted with sodium-containing solutions (see section 6.6) and this should be 
considered in relation to the total sodium from all sources that will be administered to the patient.
Paediatric population
There is a potential risk of overdosing, particularly for paediatric patients aged from 3 to less than 
12 months of age. Care should be taken when calculating the volume of administration of the dose (see 
sections 4.9 and 6.6).
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
In vitro, avibactam is a substrate of OAT1 and OAT3 transporters which might contribute to the active 
uptake of avibactam from the blood compartment and, therefore, affect its excretion. Probenecid (a 
potent OAT inhibitor) inhibits this uptake by 56% to 70% in vitro and, therefore, has the potential to 
alter the elimination of avibactam. Since a clinical interaction study of avibactam and probenecid has 
not been conducted, co-administration of avibactam with probenecid is not recommended.
Avibactam showed no significant inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes in vitro. Avibactam and 
ceftazidime showed no in vitro cytochrome P450 induction at clinically relevant concentrations. 
Avibactam and ceftazidime do not inhibit the major renal or hepatic transporters in the clinically 
relevant exposure range, therefore the interaction potential via these mechanisms is considered to be 
low.
Clinical data have demonstrated that there is no interaction between ceftazidime and avibactam, and 
between ceftazidime/avibactam and metronidazole.
Other types of interaction
Concurrent treatment with high doses of cephalosporins and nephrotoxic medicinal products such as 
aminoglycosides or potent diuretics (e.g. furosemide) may adversely affect renal function (see 
section 4.4).
Chloramphenicol is antagonistic in vitro with ceftazidime and other cephalosporins. The clinical 
relevance of this finding is unknown, but due to the possibility of antagonism in vivo this drug 
combination should be avoided.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
Animal studies with ceftazidime do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to 
pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development. Animal studies with 
avibactam have shown reproductive toxicity without evidence of teratogenic effects (see section 5.3).
Ceftazidime/avibactam should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit outweighs the 
possible risk.
9
Breast-feeding
Ceftazidime is excreted in human milk in small quantities. It is unknown whether avibactam is 
excreted in human milk. A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made 
whether to discontinue breast feeding or to discontinue/abstain from ceftazidime/avibactam therapy 
taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.
Fertility
The effects of ceftazidime/avibactam on fertility in humans have not been studied. No data are 
available on animal studies with ceftazidime. Animal studies with avibactam do not indicate harmful 
effects with respect to fertility (see section 5.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Undesirable effects may occur (e.g. dizziness), which may influence the ability to drive and use 
machines following administration of Zavicefta (see section 4.8).
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
In seven Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials, 2024 adults were treated with Zavicefta. The most 
common adverse reactions occurring in ≥5% of patients treated with Zavicefta were Coombs direct 
test positive, nausea, and diarrhoea. Nausea and diarrhoea were usually mild or moderate in intensity.
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
The following adverse reactions have been reported with ceftazidime alone and/or identified during the 
Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials with Zavicefta. Adverse reactions are classified according to frequency and

Paediatric population
The safety assessment in paediatric patients is based on the safety data from two trials in which 
61 patients (aged from 3 years to less than 18 years) with cIAI and 67 patients with cUTI (aged from 
3 months to less than 18 years) received Zavicefta. Overall, the safety profile in these 128 paediatric 
patients was similar to that observed in the adult population with cIAI and cUTI.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
Overdose with ceftazidime/avibactam can lead to neurological sequelae including encephalopathy, 
convulsions and coma, due to the ceftazidime component.
Serum levels of ceftazidime can be reduced by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. During a 4-hour 
haemodialysis period, 55% of the avibactam dose was removed.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antibacterials for systemic use, other beta-lactam antibacterials, 
third-generation cephalosporins, ATC code: J01DD52
12
Mechanism of action
Ceftazidime inhibits bacterial peptidoglycan cell wall synthesis following binding to penicillin binding 
proteins (PBPs), which leads to bacterial cell lysis and death. Avibactam is a non β-lactam, 
β-lactamase inhibitor that acts by forming a covalent adduct with the enzyme that is stable to 
hydrolysis. It inhibits both Ambler class A and class C β-lactamases and some class D enzymes, 
including extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), KPC and OXA-48 carbapenemases, and AmpC 
enzymes. Avibactam does not inhibit class B enzymes (metallo-β-lactamases) and is not able to inhibit 
many class D enzymes.
Resistance
Bacterial resistance mechanisms that could potentially affect ceftazidime/avibactam include mutant or 
acquired PBPs, decreased outer membrane permeability to either compound, active efflux of either 
compound, and β-lactamase enzymes refractory to inhibition by avibactam and able to hydrolyse 
ceftazidime.
Antibacterial activity in combination with other antibacterial agents
No synergy or antagonism was demonstrated in in vitro drug combination studies with 
ceftazidime/avibactam and metronidazole, tobramycin, levofloxacin, vancomycin, linezolid, colistin 
and tigecycline.
Susceptibility testing breakpoints
Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) breakpoints established by the European Committee on 
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) for ceftazidime/avibactam can be viewed on the 
following website:
https://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/other/minimum-inhibitory-concentration-mic-
breakpoints_en.xlsx
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship
The antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime against specific pathogens has been shown to best correlate 
with the percent time of free-drug concentration above the ceftazidime/avibactam minimum inhibitory 
concentration over the dose interval (% fT >MIC of ceftazidime/avibactam). For avibactam the PK-PD 
index is the percent time of the free drug concentration above a threshold concentration over the dose 
interval (% fT >CT).

Paediatric population
Zavicefta has been evaluated in paediatric patients aged 3 months to < 18 years in two Phase 2 
single-blind, randomised, comparative clinical studies, one in patients with cIAI and one in patients 
with cUTI. The primary objective in each study was to assess safety and tolerability of 
ceftazidime-avibactam (+/- metronidazole). Secondary objectives included assessment of 
pharmacokinetics and efficacy; efficacy was a descriptive endpoint in both studies. Clinical cure rate at 
TOC (ITT) was 91.8% (56/61) for Zavicefta compared to 95.5% (21/22) for meropenem in paediatric 
patients with cIAI. Microbiological eradication rate at TOC (micro-ITT) was 79.6% (43/54) for 
Zavicefta compared to 60.9% (14/23) for cefepime in paediatric patients with cUTI.
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Zavicefta in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of cIAI, cUTI, 
pneumonia and Gram-negative bacterial infections (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Distribution
The human protein binding of both ceftazidime and avibactam is approximately 10% and 8%, 
respectively. The steady-state volumes of distribution of ceftazidime and avibactam were about 17 L 
and 22 L, respectively in healthy adults following multiple doses of 2 g/0.5 g ceftazidime/avibactam 
infused over 2 hours every 8 hours. Both ceftazidime and avibactam penetrate into human bronchial 
epithelial lining fluid (ELF) to the same extent with concentrations around 30% of those in plasma. 
The concentration time profiles are similar for ELF and plasma.
Penetration of ceftazidime into the intact blood-brain barrier is poor. Ceftazidime concentrations of 
4 to 20 mg/L or more are achieved in the CSF when the meninges are inflamed. Avibactam penetration 
of the blood brain barrier has not been studied clinically; however, in rabbits with inflamed meninges, 
CSF exposures of ceftazidime and avibactam were 43% and 38% of plasma AUC, respectively. 
Ceftazidime crosses the placenta readily, and is excreted in the breast milk.
Biotransformation
Ceftazidime is not metabolised. No metabolism of avibactam was observed in human liver 
preparations (microsomes and hepatocytes). Unchanged avibactam was the major drug-related 
component in human plasma and urine following dosing with [14C]-avibactam.
Elimination
The terminal half-life (t½) of both ceftazidime and avibactam is about 2 h after intravenous
administration. Ceftazidime is excreted unchanged into the urine by glomerular filtration; 
approximately 80-90% of the dose is recovered in the urine within 24 h. Avibactam is excreted 
unchanged into the urine with a renal clearance of approximately 158 mL/min, suggesting active 
tubular secretion in addition to glomerular filtration. Approximately 97% of the avibactam dose is 
recovered in the urine, 95% within 12 h. Less than 1% of ceftazidime is excreted via the bile and less 
than 0.25% of avibactam is excreted into faeces.
Linearity/non-linearity
The pharmacokinetics of both ceftazidime and avibactam are approximately linear across the dose 
range studied (0.05 g to 2 g) for a single intravenous administration. No appreciable accumulation of 
ceftazidime or avibactam was observed following multiple intravenous infusions of 2 g/0.5 g of 
ceftazidime/avibactam administered every 8 hours for up to 11 days in healthy adults with normal 
renal function.
Special populations
Renal impairment
Elimination of ceftazidime and avibactam is decreased in patients with moderate or severe renal 
impairment. The average increases in avibactam AUC are 3.8-fold and 7-fold in subjects with 
moderate and severe renal impairment, see section 4.2.
Hepatic impairment
Mild to moderate hepatic impairment had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of ceftazidime in 
individuals administered 2 g intravenously every 8 hours for 5 days, provided renal function was not 
impaired. The pharmacokinetics of ceftazidime in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not 
been established. The pharmacokinetics of avibactam in patients with any degree of hepatic 
impairment has not been studied.
15
As ceftazidime and avibactam do not appear to undergo significant hepatic metabolism, the systemic 
clearance of either active substance is not expected to be significantly altered by hepatic impairment.
Elderly patients (≥65 years)
Reduced clearance of ceftazidime was observed in elderly patients, which was primarily due to 
age-related decrease in renal clearance of ceftazidime. The mean elimination half-life of ceftazidime 
ranged from 3.5 to 4 hours following intravenous bolus dosing with 2 g every 12 hours in elderly 
patients aged 80 years or older.
Following a single intravenous administration of 500 mg avibactam as a 30-minute IV infusion, the 
elderly had a slower terminal half-life of avibactam, which may be attributed to age related decrease in 
renal clearance.
Paediatric population
The pharmacokinetics of ceftazidime and avibactam were evaluated in paediatric patients from 
3 months to < 18 years of age with suspected or confirmed infections following a single dose of 
ceftazidime 50 mg/kg and avibactam 12.5 mg/kg for patients weighing < 40 kg or Zavicefta 2 g/0.5 g 
(ceftazidime 2 grams and avibactam 0.5 grams) for patients weighing ≥ 40 kg. Plasma concentrations 
of ceftazidime and avibactam were similar across all four age cohorts in the study (3 months to 
< 2 years, 2 to < 6 years, 6 to < 12 years, and 12 to < 18 years). Ceftazidime and avibactam AUC0-t and 
Cmax values in the two older cohorts (paediatric patients from 6 to < 18 years), which had more 
extensive pharmacokinetic sampling, were similar to those observed in healthy adult subjects with 
normal renal function that received Zavicefta 2 g/0.5 g. Data from this study and the two Phase 2 
paediatric studies in patients with cIAI and cUTI were pooled with PK data from adults (Phase 1 to 
Phase 3) to update the population PK model, which was used to conduct simulations to assess PK/PD 
target attainment. Results from these simulations demonstrated that the recommended dose regimens 
for paediatric patients with cIAI, cUTI and HAP/VAP, including dose adjustments for patients with 
renal impairment, result in systemic exposure and PK/PD target attainment values that are similar to 
those in adults at the approved Zavicefta dose of 2 g/0.5 g administered over 2 hours, every 8 hours.
There is limited experience with the use of ceftazidime plus avibactam in the paediatric groups of 
3 months to < 6 months. The recommended dosing regimens are based on simulations conducted using 
the final population PK models. Simulations demonstrated that the recommended dose regimens result 
in comparable exposures to other age groups with PK/PD target attainment > 90%. Based on data from 
the completed paediatric clinical trials, at the recommended dose regimens, there was no evidence of 
over or under exposure in the subjects aged 3 months to < 6 months.
In addition, there is very limited data in paediatric patients aged 3 months to < 2 years with impaired 
renal function (CrCL ≤ 50 mL/min/1.73 m2), with no data in severe renal impairment from the 
completed paediatric clinical trials. Population PK models for ceftazidime and avibactam were used to 
conduct simulations for patients with impaired renal function.
Gender and race
The pharmacokinetics of ceftazidime/avibactam is not significantly affected by gender or race.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Ceftazidime
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, reproduction toxicity or genotoxicity. Carcinogenicity studies 
have not been conducted with ceftazidime.
16
Avibactam
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity or genotoxicity. Carcinogenicity studies have not been 
conducted with avibactam.
Reproduction toxicity
In pregnant rabbits administered avibactam at 300 and 1000 mg/kg/day, there was a dose-related lower 
mean foetal weight and delayed ossification, potentially related to maternal toxicity. Plasma exposure 
levels at maternal and foetal NOAEL (100 mg/kg/day) indicate moderate to low margins of safety.
In the rat, no adverse effects were observed on embryofetal development or fertility. Following 
administration of avibactam throughout pregnancy and lactation in the rat, there was no effect on pup 
survival, growth or development, however there was an increase in incidence of dilation of the renal 
pelvis and ureters in less than 10% of the rat pups at maternal exposures greater than or equal to 
approximately 1.5 times human therapeutic exposures.

Instructions for preparing adult and paediatric doses in INFUSION BAG or in INFUSION SYRINGE:
NOTE: The following procedure describes the steps to prepare an infusion solution with a final 
concentration of 8-40 mg/mL of ceftazidime. All calculations should be completed prior to initiating 
these steps. For paediatric patients aged 3 to 12 months, detailed steps to prepare a 20 mg/mL 
concentration (sufficient for most scenarios) are also provided.
18
1. Prepare the reconstituted solution (167.3 mg/mL of ceftazidime):
a)
Insert the syringe needle through the vial closure and inject 10 mL of sterile water for 
injections.
b) Withdraw the needle and shake the vial to give a clear solution.
c)
Insert a gas relief needle through the vial closure after the product has dissolved to relieve the 
internal pressure (this is important to preserve product sterility).
a)
2. Prepare the final solution for infusion (final concentration must be 8-40 mg/mL of ceftazidime):
Infusion bag: Further dilute the reconstituted solution by transferring an appropriately 
calculated volume of the reconstituted solution to an infusion bag containing any of the 
following: sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection, dextrose 50 mg/mL (5%) 
solution for injection, or Lactated Ringer’s solution.
Infusion syringe: Further dilute the reconstituted solution by transferring an appropriately 
calculated volume of the reconstituted solution combined with a sufficient volume of diluent 
(sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection or dextrose 50 mg/mL (5%) solution 
for injection) to an infusion syringe.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What Zavicefta is and what it is used for
What Zavicefta is
Zavicefta is an antibiotic medicine that contains two active substances ceftazidime and avibactam.

Ceftazidime belongs to the group of antibiotics called “cephalosporins”. It can kill many types 
of bacteria.
Avibactam is a “beta-lactamase inhibitor” that helps ceftazidime kill some bacteria that it cannot 
kill on its own.

What Zavicefta is used for
Zavicefta is used in adults and paediatric patients aged 3 months and over to treat:




infections of the stomach and gut (abdomen)
infections of the bladder or kidneys called “urinary tract infections”
an infection of the lungs called “pneumonia”
infections caused by bacteria that other antibiotics may not be able to kill
Zavicefta is used in adults to treat infection of the blood associated with infections of the abdomen,
urinary tract, or pneumonia.
How Zavicefta works
Zavicefta works by killing certain types of bacteria, which can cause serious infections.
2. What you need to know before you use Zavicefta
Do not use Zavicefta if:

you are allergic to ceftazidime, avibactam or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed 
in section 6)
you are allergic to other cephalosporin antibiotics
you have ever had a severe allergic reaction to other antibiotics belonging to the penicillin or 
carbapenem groups


Do not use Zavicefta if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse 
before using Zavicefta.
30
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or nurse before using Zavicefta if:


you have ever had any allergic reaction (even if only a skin rash) to other antibiotics belonging 
to the penicillin or carbapenem groups
you have kidney problems - your doctor may give you a lower dose to make sure you don’t get 
too much medicine. This could cause symptoms such as fits (see section If you use more 
Zavicefta than you should)
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before using 
Zavicefta.
Talk to your doctor or nurse if you suffer from diarrhoea during your treatment.
Other infections
There is a small possibility that you may get a different infection caused by another bacteria during or 
after treatment with Zavicefta. These include thrush (fungal infections of the mouth or genital area).
Lab tests
Tell your doctor that you are taking Zavicefta if you are going to have any tests. This is because you 
may get an abnormal result with a test called “DAGT” or “Coombs”. This test looks for antibodies that 
fight against your red blood cells.
Zavicefta can also affect the results of some urine tests for sugar. Tell the person taking the sample that 
you have been given Zavicefta.
Paediatric patients
Zavicefta should not be used in paediatric patients aged under 3 months. This is because it is not 
known if the medicine is safe to use in this age group.
Other medicines and Zavicefta
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.
Talk to your doctor before using Zavicefta if you are taking any of the following medicines:




an antibiotic called chloramphenicol
a type of antibiotic called an aminoglycoside – such as gentamicin, tobramycin
a water tablet called furosemide
a medicine for gout called probenecid
Tell your doctor before using Zavicefta if any of the above apply to you.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine.
Driving and using machines
Zavicefta may make you feel dizzy. This may affect you being able to drive, use tools or machines.
Zavicefta contains sodium
This medicine contains approximately 146 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 
vial. This is equivalent to 7.3% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake for sodium for an 
adult.
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you need 3 or more vials daily for a prolonged period, especially 
if you have been advised to have a low salt (sodium) diet.

How to use Zavicefta 
Zavicefta will be given to you by a doctor or a nurse.
How much to use
The recommended dose for adults is one vial (2 g of ceftazidime and 0.5 g of avibactam), every 
8 hours. The dose for paediatric patients aged 3 months and over will be calculated by the doctor based 
on the weight and age of the child.
It is given as a drip into a vein – this will normally take about 2 hours.
A course of treatment usually lasts from 5 to up to 14 days, depending on the type of infection you 
have and how you respond to treatment.
People with kidney problems
If you have kidney problems your doctor may lower your dose. This is because Zavicefta is removed 
from your body by the kidneys.
If you use more Zavicefta than you should
Zavicefta will be given to you by a doctor or a nurse, so it is unlikely you will be given the wrong 
dose. However, if you have side effects or think you have been given too much Zavicefta, tell your 
doctor or nurse straight away. If you have too much Zavicefta it could have an effect on the brain and 
cause fits or coma.
If you miss a dose of Zavicefta
If you think you have missed a dose, tell your doctor or nurse straight away.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:
Important: Please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics before prescribing.
The compatibility of Zavicefta with other medicines has not been established. Zavicefta should not be 
mixed with or physically added to solutions containing other medicinal products.
The powder must be reconstituted with water for injections and the resulting concentrate must then be 
immediately diluted prior to use. The reconstituted solution is a pale yellow solution and is free of 
particles.
Mix gently to reconstitute and check to see that the contents have dissolved completely. Parenteral 
medicinal products should be inspected visually for particulate matter prior to administration.
Infusion bags
If the intravenous solution is prepared with diluents listed in section 6.6 (ceftazidime concentration 
8 mg/mL), the chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated (from initial vial 
puncture) for up to 12 hours at 2 - 8°C, followed by up to 4 hours at not more than 25°C. 
If the intravenous solution is prepared with diluents listed in section 6.6 (ceftazidime concentration 
> 8 mg/mL to 40 mg/mL), the chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated (from 
initial vial puncture) for up to 4 hours at not more than 25°C.
From a microbiological point of view, the medicinal product should be used immediately, unless 
reconstitution and dilution have taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. If not used 
immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and 
must not exceed those stated above.
Infusion syringes
The chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated (from initial vial puncture) for up to 
6 hours at not more than 25°C. 
From a microbiological point of view, the medicinal product should be used immediately unless 
reconstitution and dilution have taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. If not used 
immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and 
must not exceed 6 hours at not more than 25°C.
Zavicefta (ceftazidime/avibactam) is a combination product; each vial contains 2 g of ceftazidime and 
0.5 g of avibactam in a fixed 4:1 ratio. Dosage recommendations are based on the ceftazidime 
component only.
Standard aseptic techniques should be used for solution preparation and administration. Doses may be 
prepared in an appropriately sized infusion bag or infusion syringe.
The resulting solution should be administered over 120 minutes.
Each vial is for single use only.
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.
The total time interval between starting reconstitution and completing preparation of the intravenous 
infusion should not exceed 30 minutes.
36
Instructions for preparing adult and paediatric doses in INFUSION BAG or in INFUSION SYRINGE:
NOTE: The following procedure describes the steps to prepare an infusion solution with a final 
concentration of 8-40 mg/mL of ceftazidime. All calculations should be completed prior to initiating 
these steps. For paediatric patients aged 3 to 12 months, detailed steps to prepare a 20 mg/mL 
concentration (sufficient for most scenarios) are also provided.
1.
2.
Prepare the reconstituted solution (167.3 mg/mL of ceftazidime):
a)
Insert the syringe needle through the vial closure and inject 10 mL of sterile water for 
injections.
b) Withdraw the needle and shake the vial to give a clear solution.
c)
Insert a gas relief needle through the vial closure after the product has dissolved to relieve 
the internal pressure (this is important to preserve product sterility).
Prepare the final solution for infusion (final concentration must be 8-40 mg/mL of 
ceftazidime):
a)
Infusion bag: Further dilute the reconstituted solution by transferring an appropriately 
calculated volume of the reconstituted solution to an infusion bag containing any of the 
following: sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection, dextrose 50 mg/mL 
(5%) solution for injection, or Lactated Ringer’s solution.
Infusion syringe: Further dilute the reconstituted solution by transferring an appropriately 
calculated volume of the reconstituted solution combined with a sufficient volume of 
diluent (sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection or dextrose 50 mg/mL 
(5%) solution for injection) to an infusion syringe.

2 Dilute to final ceftazidime concentration of 8 mg/mL for in-use stability up to 12 hours at 2 - 8°C, 
followed by up to 4 hours at not more than 25°C (i.e. dilute 2 g dose of ceftazidime in 250 mL, 1 g 
dose of ceftazidime in 125 mL, 0.75 g dose of ceftazidime in 93 mL, etc.). All other ceftazidime 
concentrations (> 8 mg/mL to 40 mg/mL) have in-use stability up to 4 hours at not more than 25°C.
Preparation of Zavicefta for use in paediatric patients aged 3 to 12 months of age in INFUSION 
SYRINGE:
NOTE: The following procedure describes the steps to prepare an infusion solution with a final 
concentration of 20 mg/mL of ceftazidime (sufficient for most scenarios). Alternative concentrations 
may be prepared, but must have a final concentration range of 8-40 mg/mL of ceftazidime.

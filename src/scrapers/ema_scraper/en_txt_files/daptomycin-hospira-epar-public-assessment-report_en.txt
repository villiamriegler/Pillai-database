2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Daptomycin  is  cyclic  lipopeptide  antibiotic,  which  exhibits  bactericidal  activity  against  a  number  of  clinically 
important antibiotic-resistant gram-positive microorganisms.  
The mechanism of action involves binding (in the presence of calcium ions) to bacterial membranes of both 
growing and stationary phase cells causing depolarisation and leading to a rapid inhibition of protein, DNA, and 
RNA synthesis. This results in bacterial cell death with negligible cell lysis.  
Extensive clinical trials with daptomycin have been conducted all over the world including Europe. Collectively, 
these studies have documented the efficacy and safety of daptomycin for various indications. Daptomycin is 
indicated for the treatment in both adults and paediatric (1 to 17 years of age) patients with cSSTI, in adult 
patients with right-sided IE due to S. aureus and in adult patients with bacteraemia caused by S. aureus 
associated with right-sided IE or with cSSTI. 
This centralised procedure is based on Article 10(1), generic application, an application for a medicinal product 
as defined in Article 10(2)(b) referring to a so-called reference medicinal product with a Marketing authorisation 
granted in a Member State or in the Community.  The active substance daptomycin has been in medicinal use for 
more than 10 years in the Community. The originator Cubicin from Novartis Europharm Ltd. marketed in the 
Community is the reference medicinal product. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as powder for solution for injection/infusion containing 350 mg or 500 mg of 
daptomycin as active substance.  
The other ingredient is sodium hydroxide used for pH adjustment. 
The product is available in single use 10 ml type I clear glass vials with grey rubber closure and aluminium cap 
as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.

2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The information on daptomycin is provided according to the Active Substance Master File (ASMF) procedure. 
The chemical name of daptomycin is 
N-decanoyl-L-tryptophyl-L-asparaginyl-L-aspartyl-L-threonylglycyl-L-ornithyl-L-aspartyl-D-alanyl-L-aspartylgl
ycyl-D-seryl-threo-3-methyl-L-glutamyl-3-anthraniloyl-L-alanine[ε] 1-lactone corresponding to the molecular 
formula C72H101N17O26 and has a relative molecular mass of 1620.67 and the following structure: 
Figure 1. Chemical structure of daptomycin 
The structure of the active substance was elucidated by a combination of infrared absorption spectroscopy, 
UV-VIS absorption spectroscopy, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectroscopy and electrospray ionisation mass 
spectrometry (ESI-MS). Comparison of IR, UV, NMR and ESI-MS spectra with those of the reference product 
provided further proof of structure. A screening of crystalline forms was performed using X-Ray Powder 
Diffraction (XRPD). 
The active substance is a pale yellow to yellow, amorphous hygroscopic powder. It is freely soluble in water, 
slightly soluble in methanol and ethanol and practically insoluble in acetone, ethyl acetate and chloroform. It is 
sensitive to heat and photosensitive. 
Daptomycin exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of 13 chiral centres that are controlled in the 
constituent amino acids and by the fermentation process. Enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely by specific 
optical rotation. Polymorphism has not been observed for daptomycin and it is only known in the amorphous 
form. Daptomycin is fully dissolved and lyophilised during finished product manufacturing process, therefore 
polymorphic form is not considered relevant for finished product performance. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of the 
ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. A single source of the active substance is used. 
Assessment report  
EMA/109959/2017 
Page 9/20 
 
  
  
 
Daptomycin is manufactured in three main steps: fermentation stage by Streptomyces roseosporus, purification 
stage and lyophilisation stage.  
A series of purification steps are carried out to remove impurities and ensure the purity of the active substance. 
Stereochemistry originates in the raw material inputs and is controlled by the organism during fermentation. 
Steps critical to the quality of the active substance have been identified and they are controlled with adequate 
in-process controls applied during the manufacturing process. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented and considered as satisfactory. 
Reprocessing steps and criteria have been defined and considered satisfactory. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. Adequate 
purge of reagents and their by-products has been demonstrated. 
The active substance is packaged in 2-ply heat-sealed polyethylene bags under vacuum. It is then packaged in 
heat-sealed aluminium foil bag and placed in an aluminium container. The primary packaging complies with the 
EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: description (appearance), identification (IR, HPLC), specific 
optical rotation (USP), clarity of solution (Ph. Eur.), colour of solution (Ph. Eur.), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), 
water content (Ph. Eur.), heavy metals (USP), pH (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), residual 
solvents (GC), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur., USP) and microbial limits (Ph. Eur, USP). 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were accepted based on 
levels found in the originator product, which are considered as qualified. The comparison provided by the 
Applicant included results of analyses of multiple batches of the originator product, which were sourced from the 
European market and were tested prior and close to expiry date. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for the active substance and impurities has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on four commercial scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on commercial scale batches of the active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in the 
intended commercial package for up to 36 months under long term conditions (5 °C ± 3 °C) (5 batches) and for 
up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 25 °C ± 2 °C / 60% RH ± 5% RH (6 batches) according to the 
ICH guidelines were provided. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance, appearance of solution, pH, water content, specific optical 
rotation, assay, related substances, residual solvents, bacterial endotoxins and bioburden. The analytical 
methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. 
Assessment report  
EMA/109959/2017 
Page 10/20 
 
  
  
A slight decrease in assay, combined with an increase in total impurities was observed under both long term and 
accelerated conditions. The increase in total impurities is mainly attributed to the gradual increase of the 
anhydro daptomycin impurity upon storage. Nevertheless, both the assay and total impurities remained within 
the specifications under both storage conditions. Other parameters remained constant upon storage under both 
storage conditions. 
Forced degradation studies including acid and base hydrolysis, oxidation, thermal degradation and photolysis in 
line with ICH Q1B guideline were also performed, indicating that daptomycin was unstable under all conditions 
tested. The results from this study demonstrated that the proposed methods for assay and related substances 
are stability indicating and suitable for their intended use, and that the active substance should be stored 
protected from light. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period when stored at proposed conditions in the 
proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a sterile powder for solution for injection/infusion containing 350 mg or 500 mg of 
daptomycin as active substance per vial. The product is intended for reconstitution with sodium chloride 0.9% 
solution for injection prior to intravenous administration. The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to 
develop a finished product equivalent to that of the reference medicinal product, Cubicin. 
The only excipient present in the finished product is sodium hydroxide used for pH adjustment of the bulk 
formulation. According to the information provided, water for injection is a co-solvent/vehicle which is removed 
from the final product by lyophilisation. Nitrogen is a processing agent used during the manufacture (following 
lyophilisation and during stoppering steps) as air displacement to minimise the moisture content in the vials. All 
excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. 
There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 
6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.2.1 of this report. Since the excipients selected are the same used for the 
reference medicinal product, no excipient compatibility studies were performed. 
During pharmaceutical development a number of comparative studies were performed that demonstrated that 
Daptomycin Hospira is comparable to the reference product. The following quality attributes were investigated: 
identity, physico-chemical properties, related substances profile, biological activity and stability. Both products 
are nearly identical for all tested quality attributes. Both products have the same osmolality. As mentioned 
earlier in the report, the active substance is freely soluble in aqueous media but it is photosensitive and sensitive 
to heat. Photostability studies were conducted to assess the worst case impact of this condition on the product 
during the manufacturing process. No significant differences between the exposed sample and the control were 
observed under these conditions. The finished product is lyophilised and not photosensitive as confirmed by the 
photostability study conducted in line with ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and 
Products (see stability section). 
Hold time studies were performed on bulk solution. Stability of the bulk solution was confirmed and acceptable 
maximum holding times were defined. 
The finished product is manufactured using a non-standard process as it is aseptically processed. Selection of 
the sterilization method was appropriately justified. As the active substance and the finished product are heat 
Assessment report  
EMA/109959/2017 
Page 11/20 
 
  
  
sensitive and other sterilisation methods result in significant increase in impurity levels, an aseptic 
filtration/filling process of the product was selected. 
The primary packaging is single use 10 ml type I clear glass vials with grey rubber closure and aluminium cap. 
The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been 
validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. A compatibility study with 0.9% 
sodium chloride (the proposed reconstitution solution) and the container closure system was also performed. 
The results demonstrated that Daptomycin Hospira solutions are stable under tested conditions and comparable 
to the reference product. A study of the extractables and leachables that could be present in the reconstituted 
finished product demonstrated that no significant extraction or leaching occurred. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of five main steps: dispensing, compounding, sterile filtration (passed 
through two 0.2 μm filters in series), aseptic filling and lyophilisation. The processing steps and parameters that 
were considered critical to the finished product quality include the active substance handling, bulk solution pH 
and temperature, aseptic filtration and filling, and lyophilisation. The process is considered to be a non-standard 
manufacturing process. 
A detailed description of the manufacturing process of the finished product including the manufacture of the bulk 
solution, subsequent steps of the sterile filtration and respective in-process controls has been provided. 
Appropriate in-process controls were used during the manufacturing process of the finished product.  
Major  steps of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated by  a  number  of  studies.  Validation  data  was 
provided and considered acceptable. The formulation and manufacturing process for all presentations of the 
finished  product  are  identical  with  the  exception  of  the  final  fill  volume.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the 
manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. 
The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for a sterile parenteral dosage form and 
include: description (visual), description of solution (visual), identification (IR, HPLC), pH (Ph. Eur.), assay 
(HPLC), related substances (HPLC), water content (Ph. Eur.), reconstitution time (visual), particulate matter 
(Ph. Eur.), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), sterility (Ph. Eur.) and bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.). The 
finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional final 
product release testing. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the 
ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing 
has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three commercial scale batches of each strength, confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data on three commercial scale batches of each strength of the finished product stored under long term 
conditions for 36 months at 5 °C ± 3 °C, intermediate conditions for 6 months at 15 °C ± 2 °C and for 6 months 
under accelerated conditions at 25 °C ± 2 °C / 60% RH ± 5% RH were provided. The batches of medicinal 
Assessment report  
EMA/109959/2017 
Page 12/20 
 
  
  
product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for 
marketing.  
In addition, supportive stability data on four batches (3 batches for 350 mg/vial strength and 1 batch for 500 
mg/vial presentation) intended for the marketing authorisation application in the US were provided. Testing was 
conducted under long term conditions for up to 36 months at 5 °C ± 3 °C and for 6 months under accelerated 
conditions at 25 °C ± 2 °C / 60% RH ± 5% RH. These batches were representative of the batches intended for 
the EU market and the analytical methods used are the same as those applied for in this application. 
Samples  were  tested  for  description,  description  of  solution,  pH,  assay,  related  substances,  water  content, 
reconstitution  time  (visual),  particulate  matter,  sterility  and  bacterial  endotoxins.  The  analytical  procedures 
used are the same as the methods used for release testing and they are stability indicating. The vials were 
stored in upright and inverted positions. 
All results of the stability study complied with the proposed shelf-life specification.  
Stress studies on the finished product were performed by storing the product in a freezer (-15 °C to -25°C) for 
1 month. Results showed that the freeze-thaw conditions had no impact on the finished product since all 
attributes (appearance, pH, assay, related substances and water content) remained unchanged. 
Forced degradation studies on one lab scale batch exposed to acid, base, heat, oxidation (H2O2) and light were 
also conducted. The data demonstrates that the product is susceptible to degradation under all these conditions, 
and especially under heat and alkali conditions. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug 
Substances and Products. No signs of degradation after exposure to light were observed. Therefore, the finished 
product is not considered to be photosensitive. 
As indicated under pharmaceutical development, since Daptomycin Hospira is required to be reconstituted with 
0.9% sodium chloride prior to administration, a study to demonstrate the stability of the product upon 
reconstitution and storage for up to 12 hours at room temperature or up to 48 hours under refrigeration at 2 °C 
to 8 °C, was conducted. The results demonstrated that similarly to the reference medicinal product, the 
reconstituted product is stable when reconstituted as described in the product information. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 3 years when stored in a refrigerator (2 °C – 8 °C) 
as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. Chemical and physical in-use stability of the reconstituted 
solution in the vial has been demonstrated for 12 hours at 25°C and up to 48 hours at 2°C – 8°C. Chemical and 
physical stability of the diluted solution in infusion bags is established as 12 hours at 25°C or 24 hours at 2°C – 
8°C. For the 30-minute intravenous infusion, the combined storage time (reconstituted solution in vial and 
diluted solution in infusion bag; see section 6.6) at 25°C must not exceed 12 hours (or 24 at 2°C–8°C).  
For the 2-minute intravenous injection, the storage time of the reconstituted solution in the vial (see section 6.6) 
at 25°C must not exceed 12 hours (or 48 hours at 2°C–8°C). However, from a microbiological point of view the 
product should be used immediately. No preservative or bacteriostatic agent is present in this product. If not 
used immediately, in-use storage times are the responsibility of the user and would not normally be longer than 
24 hours at 2°C–8°C, unless reconstitution/dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic 
conditions. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. 
Development of the generic product was based on the formulation, dosage form, concentration and use of the 
reference product. The composition of the generic formulation is qualitatively identical and quantitatively nearly 
identical to the innovator product Cubicin. The active substance is manufactured using classical fermentation 
from Streptomyces roseosporus. It is formulated with a single excipient, sodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment), 
and presented as 350 mg or 500 mg sterile powder for solution for injection/infusion. 
Comparative experimental data regarding the physicochemical characteristics, e.g. identity, physico-chemical 
properties, related substances profile, biological activity and stability have been provided. No significant 
differences were observed from the comparative studies between the generic product and the reference 
product. Therefore, similarity between Daptomycin Hospira and the reference product Cubicin can be accepted. 
The finished product is manufactured using a non-standard manufacturing process, as it consists of sterile 
filtration and aseptic processing. Based on the provided process validation data, it has been demonstrated that 
the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible 
manner.The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform 
performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is 
based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to generate 
additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects of the 
SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been discussed and was 
considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the introduction of 
Daptomycin Hospira manufactured by Hospira UK Ltd. is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase 
Assessment report  
EMA/109959/2017 
Page 14/20 
 
  
  
in the combined sales volumes for all daptomycin containing products and the exposure of the environment to 
the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical overview on the pre-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology is adequate. 
An environmental risk assessment is not required. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
There are no objections to approval of Daptomycin Hospira from a non-clinical point of view. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The clinical overview on the clinical pharmacology, efficacy and safety is adequate. 
Daptomycin Hospira and the reference product Cubicin, proprietary medicinal product with central marketing 
authorisation [EMEA/H/C/000637(II-0053)] have an identical SmPC.  
The applicant did not receive CHMP Scientific Advice pertinent to the clinical investigation. 
Relevant for the assessment is the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98). 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
No  bioequivalence  study  was  submitted  to  support  the  application  and  no  study  is  required  according  to 
Appendix II to the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence as the test product is to be administered as 
an aqueous intravenous solution containing the same active substance as the currently approved product. The 
test product contains the same excipient as the reference product.   
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application. 
2.4.4.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The application contains an adequate review of published clinical data. No bioequivalence study is required for 
this application according to Appendix II of the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence.  
Daptomycin Hospira is essentially similar to the reference product Cubicin of Novartis Europharm Limited. 
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
A summary of the literature with regard to clinical data of Daptomycin Hospira and justifications that the product

3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of daptomycin.  The reference product Cubicin is indicated for the 
treatment in both adults and paediatric (1 to 17 years of age) patients with complicated skin and soft tissue 
infections (cSSTI), in adult patients with right-sided infective endocarditis (IE) due to S. aureus and in adult 
patients with bacteraemia caused by S. aureus associated with right-sided IE or with cSSTI.  No non-clinical 
studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available non-clinical 
information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical perspective, this 
application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy 
and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical aspects based on 
information from published literature was considered sufficient. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference 
Assessment report  
EMA/109959/2017 
Page 18/20 
 
  
  
 
medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those 
included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Daptomycin Hospira is favourable in the following indication: 
Daptomycin is indicated for the treatment of the following infections (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).  
-  Adult and paediatric (1 to 17 years of age) patients with complicated skin and soft-tissue infections (cSSTI). 
-  Adult patients with right-sided infective endocarditis (RIE) due to Staphylococcus aureus. It is recommended 
that the decision to use daptomycin should take into account the antibacterial susceptibility of the organism 
and should be based on expert advice. (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).  
-  Adult patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (SAB) when associated with RIE or with cSSTI.  
Daptomycin is active against Gram positive bacteria only (see section 5.1). In mixed infections where Gram 
negative and/or certain types of anaerobic bacteria are suspected, daptomycin should be co-administered with 
appropriate antibacterial agent(s).  
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents.  
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the 
list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any 
subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP 
presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being 
received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an important 
(pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Assessment report  
EMA/109959/2017 
Page 19/20 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
If the dates for submission of a PSUR and the update of a RMP coincide, they can be submitted at the same time. 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder shall ensure that all physicians who are expected to prescribe/use 
Daptomycin Hospira are provided with: 
- 
- 
Summary of Product Characteristics 
Dosage card 
The dosage card should contain the following key messages: 
- 
- 
- 
That there is a risk of severe skeletal muscle toxicity and so measuring the CPK at treatment initiation and 
at regular intervals is important. Patients at higher risk of developing myopathy should have more 
frequent CPK measurements. 
That Daptomycin Hospira can interfere with coagulation tests (PT/INR) and this might lead to false results. 
To minimise this risk, physicians should be advised that for coagulation levels testing it is recommended 
to draw blood samples near the time of Daptomycin Hospira trough plasma concentration. 
The dosage card should contain the appropriate algorithms for calculating the Daptomycin Hospira dose 
for reconstitution, to help minimise the risk of medication errors (high osmolarity, overdose). 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder shall ensure that all laboratories expected to perform Daptomycin Hospira 
susceptibility testing are provided with: 
- 
- 
Summary of Product Characteristics 
Laboratory susceptibility testing leaflet 
The laboratory susceptibility testing leaflet should contain the following key messages: 
- 
- 
That susceptibility testing minimises the risk of treatment failure by identifying strains with potential 
resistance to daptomycin. 
That daptomycin susceptibility testing needs Ca in the testing medium and testing methods with mediums 
providing consistent Ca concentrations are recommended.

The CHMP, having reviewed the evidence of compliance 
II and PL 
with the specific obligations and the impact of the data 
submitted by the MAH on the benefit/risk profile of the 
medicinal product, concluded that marketing authorisation 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

It is proposed a new SOB that the MAH shall provide yearly 
updates (simultaneously with submission of Periodic Safety 
Update reports) on any new information concerning efficacy 
and safety of the product in patients with LEMS in order to 
address the remaining uncertainties especially related to 
the need to for additional treatment when Firdapse 
treatment can no longer control symptoms of LEMS.

Marketing Authorisation Holder has submitted the final 
results of BMN125-13-011andBNM125-13-026 .The 
purpose of study BMN125-13-011 was to evaluate the 
palatability and determine the toxicokinetics of Firdapse 
phosphate when offered in the diet. The results were used 
to determine the initial dietary dose levels for the 
carcinogenicity study BMN125-13 026. 
In the 2-year rat dietary carcinogenicity study BMN125-13 
026, amifampridine caused small but statistically significant 
dose-related increases in the incidence of Schwannomas in 
both genders and of endometrial carcinomas in females. 
Amifampridine was not genotoxic in a standard battery of 
in vitro and in vivo tests. The correlation between the use 
of amifampridine and the development of tumours in 
humans is unknown at this time.Most Schwannomas are 
benign and asymptomatic. They can present in many 
locations, therefore the clinical presentation can be varied. 
A diagnosis of Schwannoma should be considered for 
patients who present with symptoms such as a mass that is 
painful on palpation or symptoms similar to a compressive 
neuropathy. Schwannomas are generally slow-growing and 
can exist for months to years without producing symptoms. 
The benefit of continuing treatment with amifampridine 
should be reviewed for any patient who develops a 
Schwannoma. Amifampridine should be used with caution 
in patients with an increased risk of Schwannomas, such as 
patients with past medical history of such tumours, 
neurofibromatosis Type 2 or schwannomatosis.

Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
II, Labelling 
including all variations introduced since the marketing 
and PL 
authorisation was granted, the CHMP considered that the 
risk-benefit balance of Firdapse in the symptomatic 
treatment of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) 
in adults remains favourable and therefore recommended 
the renewal of the marketing authorisation.  
In addition, the SmPC was updated in sections 4.6 and 5.3 
in order to reflect to reflect newly available pre-clinical data 
regarding developmental and reproductive toxicity. The 
Package Leaflet (PL) was updated accordingly. 
Considering that Firdapse was authorised under exceptional 
circumstances and two safety related specific obligations 
were still outstanding at the time of this renewal, i.e. the 
LEMS registry and carcinogenicity testing, as well as taking 
into account the overall limitations in patient exposure to 
Firdapse, the CHMP was of the view that one additional 
five-year renewal on the basis of pharmacovigilance 
grounds was required.

Following completion of a QTc study, the Product 
on data from a completed QTc study (specific 
obligation): 4.4 to add a statement providing 
information on the absence of ECG morphological 
changes, 4.8 to include additional terms with > 10% 
incidence (hypoaesthesia, hypoaesthesia oral 
paraesthesia oral, hyperhidrosis and cold sweat) and 
4.9 to reflect the experience with higher doses 
II, Labelling 
Information was updated to add new information regarding 
and PL 
cardiac safety. Specifically, the CHMP considered that no 
clinically relevant ECG morphological changes were 
observed in healthy volunteers after administration of 
amifampridine phosphate. The Product Information was 
also updated to include additional adverse reactions 
reported, i.e. reduced sense of touch or sensation and

accordance. 
Furthermore, consequently to the submission of the

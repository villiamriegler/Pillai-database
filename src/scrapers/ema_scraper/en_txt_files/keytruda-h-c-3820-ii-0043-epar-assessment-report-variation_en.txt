Keytruda (pembrolizumab, MK-3475) is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody targeting the human 
programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) expressed on the surface of cancer cells and tumour infiltrating 
lymphocytes. It acts as immune check-point inhibitor by blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway that 
downregulates the effector function of T cells, with consequent stimulation of the immune-mediated 
anti-tumour activity (Oncologist. 2017 Jan; 22(1): 81–88). 
The pharmacological inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 is a consolidated approach in the treatment of different 
malignancies. In the setting of lung disease, pembrolizumab is recommended as first-line option in 
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) highly-expressing PD-L1 (≥50% tumour portion score, TPS) 
and negative for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) 
gene rearrangements. In the second-line setting, pembrolizumab is indicated for the treatment of locally 
advanced or metastatic NSCLC in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 with a ≥1% TPS and who have 
received at least one prior chemotherapy regimen (patients with EGFR or ALK positive tumour mutations 
should also have received targeted therapy before receiving Keytruda). (ESMO Guidelines 2018).For both

these clinical indications, pembrolizumab is used as a monotherapy. Regulatory approval was granted on 29 
July 2016 for the treatment of previously treated PD-L1 TPS ≥1% locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC 
patients on the basis of the KEYNOTE-010 clinical trial, and on 27 January 2017 for the first-line treatment 
of metastatic PD-L1 TPS ≥50% NSCLC as supported by the KEYNOTE-024 study. With the current type II 
variation application, the MAH is pursuing an extension of indication of pembrolizumab to be used in 
combination with platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy in the treatment of metastatic non-squamous NSCLC 
with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.  
Lung cancer is the main cause of malignancy-related mortality worldwide, accounting for 1.69 million of 
deaths globally per year as estimated by the World Health Organization (WHO). Around 85%-90% of all lung 
cancers are Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), that include non-squamous (i.e, adenocarcinoma, 
large-cell carcinoma, and other cell types) and squamous (epidermoid) cell carcinoma (Brambilla et al, 2014 
and Schrump DS et al. NSCLC; Principles and Practice of Oncology. 9th Edition. 2011). During the last 25 
years, the distribution of NSCLC histological types changed in Europe, with a decrease of squamous cell 
carcinoma and an increase of adenocarcinoma in men, while in women there was an increase of both 
histologies. Non-squamous NSCLC is the prevailing histological type diagnosed in never smoker NSCLC 
patients, with a higher prevalence in females than males. More than half of the patients are diagnosed at an 
advanced stage of disease, which directly contributes to poor survival, as expressed by an untreated median 
OS of 4 months and a metastatic 5-year survival rate of <5% (Lindsey A. et al, 2016). 
Platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy has long been considered among the equally effective platinum 
doublet regimens (cisplatin and carboplatin combinations with gemcitabine, paclitaxel and docetaxel) that 
current guidelines recommend as 1L approach, in the absence of driver mutations (i.e, EGFR and ALK 
negative disease), for the treatment of patients who present without major comorbidities and ECOG PS 0-2 
(Novello S. et al, 2016). The efficacy of pemetrexed maintenance treatment, either as long-term use of an 
agent included in the first-line treatment (“continuation maintenance”) or as introduction of a new agent 
after 4 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy (“switch maintenance”) has demonstrated significant 
improvement in the efficacy outcome of the non-squamous NSCLC histology. With the advent of 
pembrolizumab and its approval (2016) in the 1L setting as monotherapy in NSCLC with TPS ≥50% based on 
the positive results of the phase III, randomized, KEYNOTE-024 study (i.e PFS HR: 0.50, p<0.001; OS HR: 
0.60, p=0.005 pembrolizumab vs a SOC platinum-based doublet), this is now indicated as first-choice also 
in non-squamous NSCLC patients highly expressing tumour PD-L1 (TPS ≥50%). (ESMO eUpdate 28 June 
2017). However, there remains substantial unmet medical need for patients with previously untreated 
nonsquamous NSCLC, since a fraction of subjects with highly expressing tumour PD-L1 (TPS ≥50%) does 
not derive benefit from pembrolizumab as monotherapy, and also considering that only 25% to 30% of 
patients with NSCLC have tumors with a PD-L1 TPS ≥50%. 
Emerging evidence suggest that combining immunotherapy with anticancer agents could provide better 
clinical outcomes by enhancing the anti-tumour immune response stimulated by chemotherapy (Apetoh L et 
al, 2015). 
The MAH applied for the following change of indication:  
“KEYTRUDA, in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line 
treatment of metastatic non-squamous NSCLC in adults whose tumours have no EGFR or ALK positive 
mutations.” 
The same indication was the subject of a previously submitted Type II variation 
(EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0027) that the MAH subsequently withdrew.   
For the purpose of the current submission, an updated analysis of the KEYNOTE-021 Cohort G is provided as 
supportive study. Results from the first Interim Analysis (IA1) of the Pivotal/Main study KEYNOTE-189 (A 
Randomized, Double-Blind, Phase III Study of Platinum+ Pemetrexed Chemotherapy with or without

Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in First Line Metastatic Nonsquamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Subjects 
(KEYNOTE-189) are also presented. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Pembrolizumab is a protein, which is expected to be metabolised in the body and biodegrade in the 
environment. Thus, according to the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products 
for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), pembrolizumab is exempt from the submission of an 
Environmental Risk Assessment as the product and excipients do not expect to pose a significant risk to the 
environment. 
2.2.2.  Discussion and conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The applicant did not submit studies for the ERA. According to the guideline, in the case of products 
containing proteins as active pharmaceutical ingredient(s), this is acceptable. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Clinical pharmacology results specific to 1st line treatment of metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) in combination with platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy indication are available from study 
KEYNOTE-021 (cohort G1) and are further informed by results obtained in other indications previously 
approved with pembrolizumab. 
The updated clinical pharmacology results in this submission include: 
• Pharmacokinetic (PK) data from KEYNOTE-021 (cohort G1) 
• A focused analysis to assess the consistency of pembrolizumab pharmacokinetics in patients with NSCLC 
from study KN021 (Cohort C and G1) who received concomitant pemetrexed and platinum therapy with the 
established definitive population PK model for pembrolizumab monotherapy.

Pharmacokinetic in target population 
Previously, a pooled population PK analysis using data from the KN001, KN002 and KN006 studies was 
performed to characterize serum pembrolizumab concentrations over time based on a dataset including 
2188 subjects across the melanoma and NSCLC indications (Report 04DDV3). In support of this specific 
submission, a focused PK analysis was conducted primarily to show the similarity of observed concentrations 
in subjects with NSCLC from study KN021 (Cohort C and G1) who received concomitant pemetrexed and 
platinum therapy with the predictions from the definitive population PK analysis, and is presented in the PK 
report (Report 04JYRX). See below section on PK/PD Modelling. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Pembrolizumab is an antibody which binds to the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor and blocks its 
interaction with ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. The PD-1 receptor is a negative regulator of T-cell activity that has 
been shown to be involved in the control of T-cell immune responses. Pembrolizumab potentiates T-cell 
responses, including anti-tumour responses, through blockade of PD-1 binding to PD-L1 and PD-L2, which 
are expressed in antigen presenting cells and may be expressed by tumours or other cells in the tumour 
microenvironment. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
No new primary or secondary pharmacology studies have been submitted. 
2.3.3.  PK/PD modelling 
Previously, a pooled population PK analysis (report 04DDV3) using KN001, KN002 and KN006 studies was 
performed to characterize serum concentrations over time based on a dataset including 2188 subjects 
across the melanoma and NSCLC indications. This analysis is considered the definitive population PK 
analysis to characterize pembrolizumab PK and inform the label for pembrolizumab.  
The structure of the definitive population PK model for pembrolizumab has a two-compartment model 
structure with a linear clearance from the central compartment, parameterized in terms of clearance (CL), 
inter-compartmental clearance (Q), central compartment volume of distribution (Vc), and peripheral 
compartment volume of distribution (Vp). All PK parameters were allometrically scaled based on body 
weight with separate exponents estimated for the clearance (CL, Q) and volume (Vc, Vp) parameters, as 
follows:  
where θx is a typical value of a pharmacokinetic parameter P*, and θy is the fixed-effect parameter to be 
estimated. WT is the individual body weight, and Median WT is the median body weight across the analysis 
population. 
In addition to body weight, the existing population PK model contained several more covariate relationships, 
which were established through a stepwise covariate search. The covariate relationships used the following 
generic form for continuous covariates, similar to the relationships for body weight. 
The following function was used to describe the effects of categorical covariates: 
Assessment report  
EMA/548820/2018 
Page 10/89 
 
 
  
 
 
Where θx is a typical value of a pharmacokinetic parameter P*, and θy is the fixed-effect parameter to be 
estimated, and Cov is the (continuous) covariate value and Q is the indicator variable denoting the category 
of the (categorical) covariate. 
Specifically, the following covariates were included in the model: 
In this model, the impact of these covariates on pembrolizumab exposure was limited (generally less than 
20%) and therefore was not considered to be of clinical relevance. 
Inter-individual variability (IIV) of the PK parameters (CL, Volume of distributions (Vc and Vp) and 
inter-compartmental clearance Q) was included using a lognormal random effects model. 
Residual variability (RV), a composite measure of assay error, dose/sample time collection errors, model 
misspecification, and any other unexplained variability within a subject, was modeled using a 
log-transformed additive error model (for the assessment of the population PK analysis, please refer to the 
EPAR for variation II/11 of Keytruda).  
No additional model development was performed in the current analysis, and the definitive population PK 
was used as is. For this updated PK evaluation, the data from NSCLC concomitantly treated with pemetrexed 
and platinum therapy from Cohorts C and G of study KN021 were added to the dataset. The final analysis 
data set from studies KN001, KN002, KN006 and KN021 used for the population PK based comparisons 
comprised of a total of 12588 pembrolizumab concentrations from 2259 patients. Of these, 335 observations 
from KN021 cohort C and G1 are in NSCLC receiving concomitant treatment. 
The number of subjects and PK observations by dose in the pooled analysis dataset are provided in the 
following table:

The figure below shows the pembrolizumab serum concentrations for the NSCLC subjects treated with 200 
mg Q3W in combination with pemetrexed and platinum therapy, together with a predicted concentration 
range (median and 90% prediction interval) from the definitive population PK model, based on the data from 
patients with melanoma or NSCLC.

concentration-time profiles during the first dose (left panel) and at steady state (right panel) at 
200 mg Q3W 
To further establish the similarity in pembrolizumab exposures across indications, several comparisons have 
been made of peak and trough concentrations between indications. Observed peak and trough 
concentrations at 200 mg Q3W in NSCLC patients concomitantly treated with pemetrexed and platinum 
therapy are compared to predicted peak and trough concentrations in NSCLC patients at this dose regimen 
(in monotherapy) in the figure and table below.

2.3.4.  Discussion and conclusion on clinical pharmacology 
The starting point for the population PK analysis submitted in the current variation application was the 
previous population PK analysis based on dataset including 2188 subjects across the melanoma and NSCLC 
indications (KN001, KN002 and KN006 studies). This former analysis is considered the definitive population 
PK model to inform the label for pembrolizumab and no further model development was performed in the 
current analysis which incorporates data from NSCLC patients concomitantly treated with pemetrexed and 
carboplatin therapy recruited in study KN021. Thus, the final dataset consist of a total of 
12588 determinations of pembrolizumab concentrations from 2259 patients.  
The approach taken by the applicant was to utilize the definitive population PK model to predict 
pembrolizumab levels in NSCLC patients concomitantly treated with pemetrexed and carboplatin therapy 
after 200 mg Q3W administration. The predictions were compared with observed levels determined in study 
KN021. 
In general, the observed concentrations in this setting (1L NSCLC in combination with pemetrexed and 
platinum therapy) fall within the range of predicted concentrations, at least during the first cycle, indicating 
that the definitive population PK model developed on monotherapy data provides an adequate description of 
the pharmacokinetics of pembrolizumab in combination with pemetrexed and platinum therapy.  
Assessment report  
EMA/548820/2018 
Page 13/89 
 
 
  
 
 
 
It is noted that observed median Cmin (Cycle 1) of pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3w in NSCLC patients 
concomitantly treated with pemetrexed and platinum therapy is slightly higher than expected from NSCLC 
patients treated with pembrolizumab monotherapy at the same dose regimen (14.15 vs. 12.7 µg/mL).  
According to the study protocols, PK sampling of study KN021 included several pre- dose trough samples 
beyond cycle 1. In particular, as reported in the final protocol of the study, “trough (pre-dose) and peak 
(post-dose) samples will be collected at Cycles 1 and 2. A trough sample will be collected at Cycle 3, 6, 9, 13 
and 17. All trough samples should be drawn within 24 hours before infusion of pembrolizumab and the peak 
samples in cycle 1 and 2 should be drawn within 30 minutes after the end of the infusion”.  
Regarding immunogenicity, no new data are available for this submission since no more data were collected 
with respect to the previous dataset. 
The existing immunogenicity assessment for pembrolizumab is based on a sufficiently large dataset of 3268 
patients, with a very low observed rate of treatment emergent ADA (1.8%) and no demonstrated impact on 
efficacy or safety. This percentage was consistent across tumour type. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
This submission is based on the first interim analysis (IA1; date cut-off: 08 Nov 2017) of the Phase 3 trial 
KEYNOTE-189, supported by data from an updated analysis of the Phase 1/2 trial KEYNOTE-021 Cohort G 
(KEYNOTE-021-G). Both studies evaluated pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in combination with 
pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy (pembro combo) compared with pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy 
(control) in the first-line treatment of subjects with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC. Detailed information 
for both studies are summarised in the following table:

2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
The recommended dose of 200 mg Q3W of pembrolizumab in combination with pemetrexed/carboplatin, 
which is also the approved dose of pembrolizumab in monotherapy for previously-untreated PD-L1 strongly 
positive NSCLC patients, was derived from the KEYNOTE-021 study. The use of the approved 200 mg Q3W 
monotherapy dose in combination with pemetrexed/carboplatin is supported by consistency in 
pembrolizumab PK between combination and monotherapy administration. This has been reviewed in the 
context of a previous application (EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0027) which was withdrawn during the procedure. 
2.4.2.  Main study 
A Randomized, Double-Blind, Phase III Study of Platinum+ Pemetrexed Chemotherapy with or 
without Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in First Line Metastatic Nonsquamous Non-small Cell Lung 
Cancer Subjects (KEYNOTE-189) 
KEYNOTE-189 is a worldwide, randomized, active-controlled, parallel-group, multi-site, double-blind study 
of pembrolizumab combined with pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy versus saline placebo combined with 
pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy in subjects with advanced or metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC who had 
not previously received systemic therapy for advanced disease and in whom EGFR or ALK-directed therapy 
was not indicated.

Methods 
Study participants 
Main inclusion criteria: 
•  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of Stage IV (M1a or M1b-American Joint Committee on 
Cancer 7th edition) nonsquamous NSCLC. 
•  Confirmation that EGFR or ALK-directed therapy was not indicated. 
•  Measurable  disease  based  on  RECIST  1.1  as  determined  by  the  local  site  investigator/radiology 
assessment. 
•  No prior systemic treatment for their advanced/metastatic NSCLC at screening. 
•  Tumor tissue from locations not radiated prior to biopsy. 
•  Age ≥18 years 
•  Life expectancy of at least 3 months. 
•  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. 
Main exclusion criteria: 
•  Predominantly squamous histology NSCLC. 
•  Prior  systemic  cytotoxic  chemotherapy  for  metastatic  disease,  or  other  targeted  or  biological 
antineoplastic therapy, before the first dose of study treatment; had a major surgery within 3 weeks prior 
to first dose.

of  new  or  enlarging  brain  metastases  and  also  are  off  steroids  3  days  prior  to  dosing  with  study 
medication.  Subjects with untreated, asymptomatic brain metastases (i.e., no neurological symptoms, 
no requirements for corticosteroids, and no lesion >1.5 cm) could participate but were required regular 
imaging of the brain as a site of disease.  
•  Active autoimmune disease that had required systemic treatment in past 2 years. 
•  Chronic systemic steroids. 
•  Subjects unable or unwilling to take folic acid or vitamin B12 supplementation. 
•  Prior treatment targeting PD-1, PD-L1/PD-L2, or other immune-regulatory receptors or mechanisms. 
•  Active infection requiring therapy. 
•  History of (noninfectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current pneumonitis. 
Treatments 
Table 4: Trial treatment 
Reduction of one chemotherapy agent and not the other agent was allowed if, in the opinion of the 
Investigator, the toxicity was clearly related to one of the treatments. If the toxicity was related to the 
combination of three agents, all three agents were to be reduced, interrupted or discontinued according to 
scheme below:

Objectives 
Primary Objectives  
1.  To evaluate the antitumor activity of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy compared 
with saline placebo in combination with chemotherapy using PFS per Response Evaluation Criteria 
on  Solid  Tumors,  Version  1.1  (RECIST  1.1)  as  assessed  by  blinded  independent  central  review 
(BICR) of imaging. 
2.  To evaluate the antitumor activity of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy compared 
with saline placebo in combination with chemotherapy using OS. 
Secondary Objectives 
1.  To evaluate the antitumor activity of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy compared 
with saline placebo in combination with chemotherapy using ORR per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by 
BICR. 
2.  To evaluate the antitumor activity of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy compared 
with saline placebo in combination with chemotherapy using duration of response (DOR) per RECIST 
1.1 as assessed by BICR. 
3.  To  evaluate  the  safety  and  tolerability  profile  of  pembrolizumab  in  combination  with 
pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy. 
Exploratory Objectives  
1. To evaluate the effect of PD-L1 expression levels on the efficacy endpoints of PFS, OS, and ORR. 
2. To evaluate the antitumor activity of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy compared with 
saline placebo in combination with chemotherapy using PFS, ORR, and DOR assessed by the investigator 
using RECIST 1.1. 
3. To evaluate changes in health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) assessments from baseline in the 
biomarker-positive strata and in the overall study population using the European Organization for Research 
and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ)-Core 30 items (C30) and EORTC 
QLQ-Lung Cancer 13 items (LC13). 
4. To characterize utilities in subjects treated with pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy 
compared with saline placebo in combination with chemotherapy using the EuroQoL 5 Dimension (EQ-5D). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoints 
- Overall survival (OS) defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. 
Assessment report  
EMA/548820/2018 
Page 17/89 
 
 
  
 
- Progression Free Survival (PFS) defined as the time from randomization to documented PD per RECIST 1.1 
based on BICR or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. 
Secondary endpoints 
- Overall response rate (ORR) assessed per RECIST 1.1 based on BICR 
- Duration of response (DOR) 
Sample size 
The analyses are event driven. A sample size of 570 subjects was planned to provide an adequate number 
of events in order to detect an HR of 0.7 at α=0.025 (one-sided) for both PFS and OS with a power of: 
• 
• 
• 
at least 72% for the PFS and 37% for the OS endpoint at the IA1 tests, 
at least 90% for the PFS and 73% for the OS at the IA2 tests (final of PFS), and 
at least 90% at the final analysis for the OS, 
assuming a median PFS of ~6.5 months and a median OS of 13 months in the control arm (assumed to follow 
an exponential distribution), with a randomization ratio of 2:1 between the experimental and control group. 
Enrollment of 570 subjects is assumed to occur over 12 months. 
One interim analysis of PFS and two interim analyses of OS are planned in addition to the respective final 
analyses. 
Randomisation 
Treatment allocation/randomization occurred centrally using an interactive voice response system / 
integrated web response system (IVRS/IWRS). Subjects were assigned randomly in a 2:1 ratio to 
pembrolizumab and chemotherapy or saline placebo and chemotherapy, respectively. The choice of cisplatin 
or carboplatin treatment was determined prior to randomization and documented in the IVRS/IWRS. 
Treatment allocation/randomization was stratified according to the following factors: 
1. PD-L1 expression: Tumor Proportion Score ≥1% vs <1%. PD-L1 unevaluable subjects were included in the 
TPS <1% group. 
2. Platinum chemotherapy: cisplatin vs carboplatin 
3. Smoking status: never vs former/current 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was double-blinded, but the clinical supplies were provided open-label. Therefore, an unblinded 
pharmacist provided the investigative staff with ready-to-use blinded pembrolizumab or saline infusion 
solutions, packaged identically in order to maintain the blinding, for administration at scheduled infusion 
visits. 
Assessment report  
EMA/548820/2018 
Page 18/89 
 
 
  
 
Treatment identification information was unmasked only if necessary for the welfare of the subject. Once an 
emergency unblinding occurred, the principal investigator, site personnel, and Sponsor personnel were 
unblinded so that appropriate follow-up medical care could be provided to the subject. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis populations 
The Intention-to-Treat (ITT) population served as the population for primary efficacy analysis. All 
randomized subjects will be included in this population. Subjects will be included in the treatment group to 
which they are randomized. If an unexpectedly large number of randomized subjects are not treated, 
analyses may be performed using the Full Analysis Set (FAS), including all randomized subjects who 
received at least 1 dose of study treatment and did not have a major protocol violation. 
Primary Endpoint analyses:  
The non-parametric Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate the PFS and survival curve in each 
treatment group. The following table summarizes the primary analysis approach for primary and key 
secondary efficacy endpoints: 
Multiplicity 
The trial uses the graphical method of Maurer and Bretz to provide multiplicity control for multiple 
hypotheses as well as interim analyses. The type I error reallocation strategy for endpoints PFS, OS, and 
ORR is shown in the following figure: 
Assessment report  
EMA/548820/2018 
Page 19/89 
 
 
  
 
 
The overall Type I error rate for each endpoint in the group sequential tests is strictly controlled at 2.5% 
(one-sided); for both PFS and OS, this is based on the Lan-DeMets O'Brien-Fleming spending function. 
Between the endpoints, the type I error is controlled by the following rollover rule. The total type I error 
allocated to PFS (0.0095) is subject to rollover to OS if the PFS test is positive. The type I error allocated to 
OS (0.0155) is subject to rollover to PFS if the OS test is positive. Furthermore, the total type I error (0.025) 
is subject to rollover to ORR at IA1 if the PFS and OS tests are both positive. 
Sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoints 
Mainly, sensitivity analyses will be performed for PFS endpoint. 
For the primary analysis, for the subjects who have PD, the true date of disease progression will be 
approximated by the date of the first assessment at which PD is objectively documented per RECIST 1.1 by 
BICR, regardless of discontinuation of study drug. Death is always considered as a confirmed PD event. In 
order to evaluate the robustness of the PFS endpoint per RECIST 1.1 by central imaging vendor, two 
sensitivity analyses with different sets of censoring rules were performed. The censoring rules for primary 
and sensitivity analyses are summarized in the following table. 
Table 5: Censory rules for primary and sensitivity analyses 
Sensitivity analyses will be performed also for comparison of PFS based on investigator's assessment. 
In case of potential gross imbalance in baseline prognostic factors in the ITT population with TPS≥50% (due 
to lack of stratification according to TPS≥50% vs. TPS<50%), sensitivity analyses for OS and PFS may be 
performed using the multivariate Cox regression to adjust for those imbalanced baseline prognostic factors.

Conduct of the study 
The original protocol was implemented by a total of 8 amendments.  
The main changes are summarised below: 
Protocol Amendment 
Most relevant changes 
02 (10 Feb 2016) 
04 (16 Mar 2017) 
07 (06 Nov 2017) 
Corrected  the  reporting  periods  for  all  AE  categories  following 
cessation of study treatment, from 14 to 90 days for SAEs or 30 
days  in  the  event  of  initiation  of  new  anti-cancer  therapies; 
removed  inclusion  criterion  requiring  TSH  within  normal  limits; 
updated the list of concomitant medications allowed and prohibited; 
updated  required  assessments  for  PK  analysis,  quality  of  life  and 
safety follow-up   
Revised the SAP and objectives according with FDA input to place 
more  emphasis  on  OS;  addition  of  exploratory  objective  n.1  to 
address  the  importance  of  PD-L1  expression  on  efficacy  and 
objective  n.8 
importance  of  outcomes 
the 
post-Crossover 
Promoted OS to primary endpoint; timing of IA1 was changed to 
occur  at  approximately  370  PFS  rather  than  300  events  PFS  as 
previously defined, to provide a more robust analysis of the data, 
focusing on OS and adjust the alpha spending. In addition, subject 
accrual was greater than originally expected and estimated timing 
of  interim  analyses  can  now  be  calculated  based  on  actual 
enrollment (N=616), rather than the planned enrollment (N=570).

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Pembrolizumab monotherapy is already part of the NSCLC treatment algorithm, having been approved as 
first-line treatment of metastatic PD-L1 strongly positive (TPS≥50%) NSCLC in the absence of EGFR or ALK 
gene rearrangements; and in second-line for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic PD-L1 positive 
(TPS≥1%) patients who have received at least one prior chemotherapy regimen, including the approved 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors for EGFR and ALK positive tumours.   
The current Type II variation application aims at extending the clinical indication of pembrolizumab as 
add-on treatment to platinum/pemetrexed chemotherapy in non-squamous metastatic NSCLC patients 
irrespective of tumour PD-L1 level of expression based on the results of the pivotal phase III trial 
KEYNOTE-189.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The efficacy evidence in support of the current regulatory submission are derived from the first interim 
analysis (IA1 with cut-off date 08 Nov 2017) of the KEYNOTE-189, an ongoing Randomized, Double-Blind, 
Phase III Study of Platinum + Pemetrexed Chemotherapy with or without Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in First 
Line Metastatic Nonsquamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Subjects. The data are supported by an updated 
analysis of cohort G of the Phase I/II study KEYNOTE-021, previously submitted as part of an application 
(EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0027) subsequently withdrawn, consisting of the group of patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic (Stage IIIB/IV) NSCLC cancer exposed to the intended dose of pembrolizumab (200 
Assessment report  
EMA/548820/2018 
Page 43/89 
 
 
  
 
 
mg Q3W) in combination with carboplatin/pemetrexed. Patients with sensitizing EGFR mutation or ALK 
translocation were not eligible. 
As being a randomised, double blind superiority trial versus chemotherapy alone, the study design of the 
pivotal KEYNOTE-189 allows for a controlled analysis of the add-on value of pembrolizumab to cytotoxic 
agents. Overall, patient selection criteria reflect the target population of the pursued clinical indication. The 
use of platinum/pemetrexed as a study comparator is deemed in line with current clinical practice as it 
represents a valuable therapeutic option among those recommended as 1L choice in the treatment of 
non-squamous NCSLC patients with tumours negative for EGFR and ALK mutations.  It is acknowledged that 
KEYNOTE-189 was designed before regulatory approval for pembrolizumab in 1L for NSCLC patients with 
high PD-L1 expression (TPS≥50%) was granted, and therefore the study design lacks a comparative arm 
including pembrolizumab monotherapy, that is currently the SoC for the treatment of this patient subgroup. 
The partial overlapping of the population targeted by the pursued extension of indication with the one for 
which a licensed indication is already in place, constitutes an element of concern. In the absence of a direct 
comparison between pembrolizumab as monotherapy and as add-on therapy to platinum-based doublets, a 
specification was proposed by the MAH to be included in section 4.2 of the SmPC to better reflect the need 
for treating physicians to consider a B/R ratio evaluation on individual basis, and provide a comprehensive 
description of currently available clinical trial results that are of clinical value in the process of 
treatment-decision making (i.e. efficacy outcomes by PD-L1 status and special considerations in the 
subgroup of patients aged ≥75 years) 
The choice of OS and PFS per RECIST 1.1 by BICR as primary endpoints enables a clinical benefit evaluation 
based on relevant efficacy outcomes in cancer therapy, and it is therefore deemed adequate. The key 
secondary endpoint was ORR per RECIST 1.1, with additional secondary endpoints to describe DOR and 
safety and tolerability.  
Treatment allocation/randomization was stratified according to PD-L1 expression (TPS ≥1% vs <1%; PD-L1 
unevaluable included in the TPS <1% group), Platinum chemotherapy (cisplatin vs carboplatin), smoking 
status (never vs former/current). This approach is deemed adequate. The sample size calculation of 
KEYNOTE-189 was appropriate for a comparative analysis between the two treatment arms (pembro combo 
vs control) in the ITT population (616 patients in total). The IA1 of KEYNOTE-189 that has been presented 
was event-driven and set-up at around 370 PFS events, as specified by Protocol Amendment n.7 (dated 06 
Nov 2017), with an appropriate multiplicity adjustment between the two dual primary endpoints PFS and 
OS. It is noted that upgrading of OS as primary end-point was introduced with Amendment n.7, in response 
to FDA suggestions to pose major emphasis on the survival outcome, which is a reasonable approach. 
However, it should be noted that while PFS reached a maturity level of 88%, the level of maturity of OS 
analysis was 57% at this stage. Considering that the focus of this application is to extend the clinical 
indication of pembrolizumab as add-on treatment to chemotherapy irrespective of the PD-L1 level of 
expression, a robust characterisation of the efficacy profile of the experimental treatment in the different 
subgroups (TPS<1%, TPS 1-49%, TPS≥50%) would be of value, particularly to contextualize the results 
taking into account the current treatment landscape. An updated analysis will be submitted post 
authorisation together with the final CSR by June 2021 (see RMP). 
The supportive study KN021, in particular the randomized Cohort G1 of KEYNOTE-021 (ITT population=123 
patients), is very similar in terms of eligibility criteria. Differently from study KN-189, cisplatin-based 
combinations were not allowed in this study, even though based on inclusion criteria, cisplatin-eligible 
patients could have been enrolled. The primary efficacy endpoint of Study KN021 was ORR per RECIST 1.1 
based on BICR, while PFS per RECIST 1.1 based on BICR was considered a key secondary endpoint. These 
two endpoints were analyzed using a step down procedure, in which the Type I error rate (alpha=2.5%, 
one-sided) over the multiple endpoints was controlled by a fixed-sequence, closed-testing procedure that 
tested for a treatment difference for ORR first, followed by a test for a treatment difference for PFS. As 
additional secondary endpoints, OS and duration of response (DOR) were also evaluated. The primary 
Assessment report  
EMA/548820/2018 
Page 44/89 
 
 
  
efficacy analysis of efficacy was planned to occur with at least 6 months of treatment or follow up for all 
patients enrolled, which is considered adequate. An updated analysis with 8 additional months of follow-up 
compared to the prior submission (EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0027) has been submitted (cutoff date 31- 
MAY-2017 vs 31-DEC-2016 in prior application). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The study population of both the pivotal study KEYNOTE-189 and supportive study KEYNOTE-021G, can be 
considered overall representative of the population targeted by the sought indication with regard to disease 
staging and histology. Baseline characteristics in KEYNOTE-189 appear well balanced between treatment 
arms, with the exception of age, gender and ECOG PS score. One could get a notion that the baseline 
characteristics of the pembro/combo group are slightly favourable (eg. ECOG=1 54% vs.61%). On the other 
hand, a higher percentage of subjects ≥65-year-old were recruited in the pembro combo compared to 
control (52% vs 44%). In addition, the higher percentage of female patients in the control arm could also 
favour the chemotherapy vs the pembro-combo arm (47% vs 38%).  At the time of inclusion, most patients 
in the pembrolizumab arm had ECOG 1 status (54%) or 0 (45.4%).  
A clinically relevant benefit in OS is reported in KEYNOTE-189, with the Kaplan-Meier curves showing a more 
favourable outcome of pembro combo versus control, with a compelling HR=0.49 (95% CI: 0.38,0.64; 
p<0.00001) in the overall study population. The median OS was not reached for the pembro combo but was 
11.3 months (95% CI: 8.7, 15.1) for the control. The KM curves for OS demonstrated a separation beginning 
at Month 1 and these curves never cross, indicating the favourable OS for the pembro-chemo-combo 
therapy. This will be provided as a post-authorisation measure with the final CSR to be submitted by June 
2021.  
A benefit is also reported for PFS (with 66% of the total population with a PFS event occurred at the time of 
IA1) for pembro combo versus the control arm in the overall population, with a reduction in disease 
progression by 48% and a gain of about 4 months in median PFS (HR=0.52 [0.43, 0.64]; p<0.00001). The 
data were confirmed by both the Sensitivity analysis 1 (HR=0.51 [0.42, 0.63]; p<0.00001) and 
Investigator-based assessment (HR=0.53 [0.43, 0.64] P<0.00001), demonstrating robustness of the 
finding.  
The secondary end-point results are in further support of a beneficial effect of pembrolizumab 
co-administrated with chemotherapy over chemotherapy alone (ORR 47.6% vs 18.9% with a median DoR of 
11.2 vs 7.8 months in pembro combo vs control respectively).  
Efficacy endpoints by subgroup analysis also demonstrate overall better performance of the combined 
treatment versus platinum/pemetrexed in all categories for both OS and PFS. However, stratification of 
results by factors such as age, sex and PD-L1 score demonstrates a variable degree of superiority of pembro 
combo vs control in OS and PFS, with PFS curves almost superimposable and HR=0.75 (95%CI 0.53-1.05) 
in the subgroup of patients with PD-L1<1%. The dependency of treatment effect upon PD-L1 status 
recognises biological plausibility. Despite the 95% CI of PFS HR crossing 1 in the subgroup with PD-L1 score 
<1%, the significant advantage in terms of OS of the experimental treatment versus chemotherapy only in 
this subpopulation, makes the results of clinical value. 
A total of 57 NSCLC patients aged ≥ 75 years were enrolled in study KEYNOTE-189 (35 in the 
pembrolizumab combination and 22 in the control). A trend towards reduced performance of pembrolizumab 
combination according to increasing age was noted with an apparent detrimental effect in subjects aged ≥75 
years (HR=2.09 [0.84,5.23] in OS, and HR=1.73 [0.77,3.90] in PFS). Data are limited on the efficacy of 
pembrolizumab in combination with platinum chemotherapy in this patient population.  
Unlike prior clinical studies (KEYNOTE-010; KEYNOTE-024) showing no apparent benefit of pembrolizumab 
monotherapy in women, the KEYNOTE-189 points toward a higher efficacy of the combined therapy vs 
Assessment report  
EMA/548820/2018 
Page 45/89 
 
 
  
control in female than male subjects. Even in KN021 the ORR difference of male patients compared to female 
patients was 4%. The results from KN189 seem to be inconsistent. A gender imbalance has been noted 
between the two arms (38% vs 47.1% of the female population in pembro combo and control arm, 
respectively) that might constitute a bias in data interpretation, also in view of a historical difference in the 
clinical outcomes of immunotherapy in prior studies (Conforti F, et al. Lancet Oncol 2018) in favour of males. 
A sex adjusted analysis was requested and showed no bias due to gender in results analysis. There was 
underperformance of females in the control arm of KEYNOTE-189 (57.7% deaths compared to 47.7% deaths 
in males) as well as fewer deaths in females (23.1%) compared to males (35.8%) in the pembrolizumab 
combination arm. In addition, the therapeutic approach in KEYNOTE-189 is different from all of the studies 
evaluated by Conforti et al, as none included a treatment arm with an anti-PD-1 inhibitor and chemotherapy. 
The observed difference between males and females will be monitored in the future submissions.  
A benefit for the combination of pembrolizumab and chemotherapy is observed in the overall population. 
However, the results in the subgroup of patients with PD-L1 score ≥50% should be considered in the context 
of the already authorised monotherapy indication for Keytruda. In this patient population, the combined 
therapy led to a substantial benefit with a HR=0.36 (0.25, 0.52; p<0.00001) in PFS and HR=0.42 (0.26, 
0.68; p=0.00012) in OS and 4.7 month gain over control in PFS. In the KEYNOTE-024, supporting the use 
of pembrolizumab as monotherapy in the first line NSCLC indication in patients with PD-L1 score ≥50%, a 
HR=0.63 (0.47, 0.86) vs SOC (p=0.002) was observed, with a gain of almost 15 months in OS over the 
control arm (HR=0.66 vs platinum/pemetrexed regimen). Hence, indirect comparison of data from 
KEYNOTE-024 and KEYNOTE-189 indicates a minimal advantage of the pembrolizumab/chemotherapy 
combination over pembrolizumab monotherapy. Nevertheless, the outcome in the control arms of both 
studies differs, suggesting a slightly different (more favourable) patient population in KEYNOTE-189.  Thus 
the effect of chemotherapy could be regarded as borderline and therefore detrimental, because of the 
superior toxicity. Appropriate evaluations on the B/R ratio should be performed by treating physicians on an 
individual basis, particularly within the subgroups of patients with TPS≥50% and/or aged ≥75 years, taking 
into account all the experimental evidence emerged so far. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy results derived from the IA1 of the pivotal KEYNOTE-189 study provide evidence for a beneficial 
effect of pembrolizumab as add-on therapy to platinum/pemetrexed in non-squamous NSCLC patients. Data 
are limited in patients ≥ 75 years of age for whom pembrolizumab combination therapy should be used with 
caution after careful consideration of the potential benefit/risk on an individual basis.  No clinically 
meaningful differences in treatment effect between male and female patients emerged.  An updated analysis 
will be submitted post-authorisation together with the final CSR to better estimate the magnitude of the 
effect in the overall study population, as well as in the various subgroups taking into account the already 
authorised indication of pembrolizumab monotherapy as first line treatment in patients with TPS≥50%. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The evaluation of pembrolizumab‘s safety in combination with pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy for 
first-line treatment of metastatic non-squamous NSCLC with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumour aberrations is 
primarily based on results of the pivotal study KEYNOTE-189 trial. Supportive data from Cohorts C and G of 
the KEYNOTE-021 study are also provided.  
Safety data are presented in tabular format including results from the following 5 datasets:

KEYNOTE-012 Cohort B and B2 (head and neck cancer), Cohort C (bladder cancer), and Cohort D 
(gastric  cancer);  KEYNOTE-013  Cohort  3  and  KEYNOTE-087  (classical  Hodgkin  lymphoma); 
KEYNOTE-024 (NSCLC), KEYNOTE-045 and KEYNOTE-052 (urothelial cancer); KEYNOTE-059 Cohort 
1 (gastric cancer); KEYNOTE-164 Cohort A (colorectal cancer); and KEYNOTE-013 Cohort 4a and 
KEYNOTE-170 (primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma); n=4484.  
Safety analyses were carried out on the All-Subjects-as-Treated (ASaT) population (randomized subjects 
receiving at least one study treatment dose at the time of cut-off dates). The 67 subjects who crossed over 
from chemotherapy (Control arm) to pembrolizumab monotherapy were censored at time of crossover and 
safety results of these patients are not provided.  
No Tier 1 safety parameters were specified in the protocol. Differently from planned in the protocol, 
between-group comparisons were not performed for all non-prespecified Tier 2 events, occurring in <4 
subjects in any treatment group. In the changed safety analyses, between-group comparison was carried 
out and reported with risk differences and 95% Confidence Interval (CI) only for some selected events within 
AEs with >10% incidence and Grade 3-5 AEs >5% incidence. Tier 3 events, occurring in <4 subjects in any 
treatment group, were evaluated only with point estimates by treatment group.

Patient exposure 
For KEYNOTE-189, data cut-off was 08 Nov 2017. At that time, out of 616 randomized, a total of 607 
participants had received at least one study dose. Treatment was ongoing in 33.8% of 405 subjects treated 
of the Pembro Combo arm and in 17.8% of 202 patients of the Control arm. Sixty-seven subjects (33.2%) 
treated with chemotherapy, crossed over to pembrolizumab monotherapy because of disease progression 
and according to protocol-specified criteria.

Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) 
The following approach was used to reflect ADRs in the SmPC section 4.8: events not already included in 
section 4.8 as associated with pembrolizumab monotherapy and for which clinically meaningful imbalances 
between treatment arms persisted despite adjustment for exposure and for which there was potential 
biologic plausibility for an association with exposure to pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy 
were selected for inclusion. The appropriate frequency categories for these events were then determined 
according to MedDRA definitions. The events, febrile neutropenia and acute kidney injury met these criteria 
and are proposed for inclusion in section 4.8.

Deaths 
The proportion of deaths due to AEs was similar between the treatment groups (pembro combo: 27 subjects 
[6.7%]; control: 12 subjects [5.9%]). Pneumonitis (3 [0.7%]), in the pembro combo, was the most 
frequently reported AE resulting in death. 
Cardiac events (cardiac arrest, cardiac failure, cardiopulmonary failure, and myocardial infarction) resulting 
in death were more frequently reported in the pembro combo compared with the control (1.2% versus 
0.0%, respectively). Cardiac arrest occurred in the setting of Grade 3 dyspnea with Grade 4 neutropenia and 
thrombocytopenia; cardiac failure occurred in the setting of Grade 2 cerebrovascular accident; and 
cardiopulmonary failure occurred in the setting of Grade 4 asthenia. Two were acute events: cardiac arrest 
and myocardial infarction. Autopsies were available for 2 of these events confirming cardiorespiratory 
decompensation in the setting of NSCLC and myocardial infarction with cardiorespiratory arrest. These all

occurred early in the course of treatment in subjects with multiple comorbidities and were reported as 
terminal events; none appear associated with immune-related AEs. 
Adverse events of Special Interest (AEOSIs) 
The following AEOSIs were reported: Pneumonitis (4.5% vs 1.9% in chemo and 3.3% in pembro 
monotherapy), Hyperthyroidism (4.0% vs 3.3% in pembro monotherapy), Colitis (2.2% vs 1.9% in pembro 
monotherapy), Severe Skin Reaction (2.0% vs 1.3% in pembro monotherapy), and Hepatitis (1.2% vs 0.6% 
in pembro monotherapy). Nephritis was observed with increased frequency in the pembro combo than the 
reference database (1.7% vs 0.2% in pembro monotherapy).

Laboratory findings 
The most frequently reported (≥50%) laboratory abnormalities were similar in the Pooled Combo SD and the 
Pooled Chemo SD, and the majority were CTCAE Grade 1 to 2 toxicity: 
• Pooled Combo SD: hemoglobin decreased (84.4%), glucose increased (65.7%), lymphocytes decreased 
(62.6%), leukocytes decreased (53.2%)  
• Pooled Chemo SD: hemoglobin decreased (82.0%), lymphocytes decreased (63.9%), glucose increased 
(62.0%), leukocytes decreased (52.0%) 
The most frequently reported (≥9%) Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were similar in the Pooled Combo 
SD and the Pooled Chemo SD: 
• Pooled Combo SD: lymphocytes decreased (22.6%), neutrophils decreased (18.6%), hemoglobin 
decreased (16.9%), leukocytes decreased (11.7%), platelets decreased (10.9%), phosphate decreased 
(9.7%) 
• Pooled Chemo SD: lymphocytes decreased (24.6%), hemoglobin decreased (19.1%), neutrophils 
decreased (16.7%), phosphate decreased (13.1%), leukocytes decreased (9.4%), and platelets  decreased 
(9.1%) 
Though reported less commonly, the higher frequency of increased creatinine was consistent with the 
increased frequency of acute kidney injury and nephritis observed in the Pooled Combo SD and Pooled 
Chemo SD. Increased creatinine was reported more frequently in the Pooled Combo SD compared with the 
Pooled Chemo SD and the Pembrolizumab Monotherapy RSD, at 36.8%, 23.8%, and 16.0%, respectively. 
Likewise, the frequency of Grade 3 to 4 increased creatinine was 4.2%, 0.8%, and 0.7%, respectively.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal DDI studies have been conducted as part of this application. 
As pembrolizumab is an IgG antibody that is administered parenterally and cleared by catabolism, food and 
DDI are not anticipated to influence exposure. Drugs that affect the cytochrome P450 enzymes, and other 
metabolizing enzymes, are not expected to interfere with the metabolism of an IgG antibody. The IgG 
antibodies, in general, do not directly regulate the expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes, other enzymes, 
or transporters involved in drug elimination. Therefore, no dedicated DDI studies have been performed. In 
addition, in vitro experiments and studies conducted in preclinical species have been shown to have limited 
value in predicting DDI potential in humans. Therefore, no preclinical pharmacokinetic studies were 
conducted to assess the propensity of pembrolizumab to be a victim or perpetrator of pharmacokinetic DDIs. 
Studies evaluating pharmacodynamic drug interactions with pembrolizumab have not been conducted. 
However, as systemic corticosteroids may be used in combination with pembrolizumab to ameliorate 
potential side effects, the potential for a pharmacokinetic DDI with pembrolizumab as a victim was assessed 
as part of the population pharmacokinetic analysis. No relationship was observed between prolonged use of 
systemic corticosteroids and pembrolizumab exposure. Nevertheless, given the study design, exclusion 
criteria, and immunomodulatory mechanism of action, the use of systemic corticosteroids (at doses greater 
than physiologic replacement), or other immunosuppressants before the start of pembrolizumab treatment, 
is not recommended. However, systemic corticosteroids, or other immunosuppressants, can be used during 
pembrolizumab treatment to treat immune-related adverse reactions.

Post marketing experience 
The safety profile of pembrolizumab was summarized in the Periodic Safety Update Report covering the 
period 04-Mar-2017 through 03-Sep-2017 (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010403/201709).

As a result of the review of the PSUR, the SmPC section 4.8 was updated to add pericarditis and pericardial 
effusion as new adverse drug reactions (ADR) with a frequency uncommon and to add a footnote to the 
existing ADR  ‘myasthenic syndrome’ to indicate that the event ‘myasthenia gravis’ is included. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The evaluation of pembrolizumab‘s safety in combination with pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy for 
first-line treatment of metastatic non-squamous NSCLC with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumour aberrations is 
primarily based on the results of the first interim analysis of the ongoing pivotal KEYNOTE-189 trial 
supported by data from Cohorts C and G of the KEYNOTE-021 study. The two study populations were 
grouped in a Pooled Combo (n=488) and  Pooled Chemo (n=264) dataset for a comparative analysis, which 
is acceptable in light of the consistency in clinical and disease characteristics between the two study 
populations, and only minor dissimilarities in patient demographics. Furthermore, the safety database 
include a reference dataset for the Pembrolizumab Monotherapy RSD (NSCLC and melanoma, n=2799) and 
the Cumulative Running Pembrolizumab Monotherapy SD, regardless of indication (n=4484).  
Overall, the submitted dataset is considered numerically appropriate for safety evaluation, also in 
consideration of the fact that long-term exposure data derived from the KEYNOTE-189 study were available 
in 51.7% and 14.5% of the study population for ≥6 months and ≥12 months, respectively. 
The duration of exposure was considerably longer for the pembro combo compared with the control (and the 
Pembrolizumab Monotherapy RSD). This included a higher exposure to pemetrexed with more patients 
entering the maintenance phase and a higher exposure to carboplatin in the induction phase in the pembro 
combo arm compared with the control. It is acknowledged that these differences in exposure have to be 
taken into consideration when evaluating the safety profile of the different treatment options. 
While overall adverse events (AEs, Grade 3-5 AEs, SAEs) compared similarly among treatment strategies,  
the frequency of drug-related Grade 3-5 AEs (47.3% vs 37.1%), SAEs (50% vs 43.6%), and drug-related 
SAEs (26.4% vs 18.6%), as well as the rate of subjects who discontinued any drug due to either AEs (26.4% 
vs 14.8%), drug-related AEs (20.5% vs 9.8%), or SAEs (17.6% vs 8.3%) were all increased in patients 
treated with pembrolizumab+chemotherapy compared to those who received chemotherapy only. In both 
treatment groups, evaluation over time of exposure-adjusted incidences (0-3, 3-6, 6-12, >12 months) in 
Study KEYNOTE-189 shows that overall and SOC-specific AE frequencies were higher during the first two 
periods, with declining rates thereafter, likely due to the more toxic platinum-based induction phase than 
the pemetrexed maintenance period. 
Exposure-adjusted event rate was slightly lower in the Pembro Combo compared to the Control arm (194.01 
vs 211.23 person-years of follow-up). Exposure adjusted incidences of drug-related Grade 3-5 AEs, SAEs, 
drug-related SAEs, that were more frequently reported with combo compared to chemotherapy were not 
reported, and have been requested.  
Most common AEs (incidence ≥40%) were nausea, anaemia and fatigue in both treatment arms. Diarrhoea 
and rash were reported with higher incidences in the pembro combo arm compared to control (95% CI of 
risk difference exceeding 0). But most of the point estimates of other common AEs also favoured the control 
group. The risks of dyspnoea and cough occurred more commonly in the control group which possibly 
suggests improved disease control in the pembro combo in line with the more favourable efficacy results. 
Drug-related Grade 3-5 AEs were mainly associated with the known toxicity profile of chemotherapeutic 
agents, as being dominated by Blood and lymphatic system disorders (25.8% vs 23.5% in Pooled Pembro vs 
Pooled Chemo) that are uncommon in pembrolizumab monotherapy. However, within this SOC category, an 
additive effect of pembrolizumab could be recognised on the incidence of febrile neutropenia and 
Neutropenia. As regards the other categories, pembrolizumab as add-on therapy has worsen the safety 
profile of chemotherapy in all the different SOCs, with a particularly marked effect on Diarrhoea, 
Assessment report

Thrombocytopenia, Lacrimation increased, Constipation, Rash, Alanine Aminotransferase increase, Blood 
creatinine increased; in addition, 6 cases of both cardiac disorders and hepatobiliary disorders were reported 
in the population exposed to combined therapy compared to none in the control arm. 
Myelotoxicity, gastrointestinal disorders, pneumonitis and renal toxicity were among the most 
frequent drug-related SAEs for both the combined therapy group and control arm, although with higher 
frequency in the former than the latter.  
Pneumonitis and acute kidney injury were also among the major reasons for drug-related AEs leading to 
pembrolizumab discontinuation. On the contrarily, myelotoxicity represented the major cause of 
drug-related interruption for both pembrolizumab and chemotherapy. 
Overall, type and frequency of specific AEOSIs was consistent with the established pembrolizumab safety 
profile with the exception of Pneumonitis, Hyperthyroidism, Colitis, Severe Skin Reaction, Nephritis, and 
Hepatitis. No new indication-specific, immune-mediated AE causally associated with pembrolizumab was 
found. These findings likely reflect overlapping toxicities associated with pembrolizumab monotherapy and 
pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy alone. Prior exposure to thoracic radiation was identified as risk factor 
associated with a higher incidence of pneumonitis. 
In conclusion, it appears that the addition of pembrolizumab increases the risk of some expected toxicities 
with chemotherapy regimens. Based on the submitted data it is not possible to understand if such an 
increase is observed regardless of the platinum-based regimen used, or whether the added toxicity is more 
pronounced with one treatment or the other.  
For the purpose of better understanding the relation between the toxicities observed with the combination 
compared to chemotherapy alone, the MAH has been requested to present safety data from both arms of 
KEYNOTE-189 by the type of chemotherapy regimen (i.e. cisplatin- or carboplatin-based), and summarize 
the pattern of AEs observed when pembrolizumab is combined with either cisplatin-based chemotherapy or 
carboplatin-based chemotherapy (data not shown). The combination of pembrolizumab to either cisplatin or 
carboplatin-based doublets showed a similar safety profile. No differences emerged in terms of AE pattern 
across the different SOC categories between the groups of patients treated with pembrolizumab in 
combination to either cisplatin or carboplatin-based chemotherapy. 
Death rate in Study KEYNOTE-189 was slightly higher in the Pembro Combo arm when compared to Controls 
(27 subjects [6.7%] vs 12 subjects [5.9%], respectively). All narratives of these events were reviewed, 
drug-related deaths were reported in 9 subjects [2.2%] in the Pembro Combo versus 2 subjects [1%] in the 
Control. In the pembro combo arm 3 patients suffered deaths due to pneumonitis. 5 subjects died due 
to cardiac events (versus 0 in the control). Apart from two acute cardiac events concomitant AEs in the 3 
further subjects were myelotoxicity (Grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia), cerebrovascular accident 
and Grade 4 asthenia (with pneumonia and PE in the autopsy). Neutropenia appeared to be a relevant 
underlying factor also for other deaths with and without infections (e.g. grade 5 neutropenic sepsis; grade 5 
peritonitis with Grade 4 febrile neutropenia; Grade 5 Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia with Grade 4 
neutropenia; Grade 5 acute kidney injury with neutropenic sepsis in two cases; Grade 5 intestinal ischaemia 
with grade 4 decreased neutrophil count; Grade 5 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with grade 4 
neutropenia and 4 decreased platelet count). 
Fatal infections without (relevant) neutropenia were reported in three further patients (pneumonia in the 
context of malignant neoplasm progression, septic shock and lung infection). 
Further notable is a higher proportion of fatal ischaemic vascular events (2 cases of ischaemic 
stroke/cerebral infarction) and 3 cases of intestinal ischaemia/mesenteric artery embolism compared to 
none in the control arm).

The 27 fatal events in the KEYNOTE-189 Pembro Combo arm occurred predominantly in males and all cases 
were >60 years. Specifically, within the group of patients aged ≥75 years (34 patients in the experimental 
arm and 21 in the control group), fatalities were considerably higher in pembrolizumab+chemotherapy 
(20.6%) compared to chemotherapy only (4.8%). In agreement with this, the comparison between Pooled 
Combo vs Pooled Chemo in subjects aged ≥65 years revealed reduced tolerability of the combined therapy 
in more elderly patients as demonstrated by an increased incidence of drug-related grade 3-5 AEs (50.6% 
vs 39.8%), drug-related SAE (31.3% vs 21.1%), discontinuation due to drug-related AEs (23.5% vs 12.2%) 
and discontinuation due to drug related SAEs (13.6% vs 4.9%) . Particulalry marked it is the difference in 
drug-related Grade 3-5 AEs within the subgroup aged ≥75 years (46.3% vs 33.3%) and discontinuations 
due to drug-related SAEs (24.4% vs 4.2%). Because of the relatively low number of subjects, and the 
potential for baseline comorbities as a confounding factor, the B/R profile for patients ≥75 years has not 
been established. In the absence of these data, pembrolizumab should be used with caution in this 
population after careful consideration of the potential risk-benefit on an individual basis (see section 4.4 of 
the SmPC). As regards other subgroup analysis, the safety profile of pembro combo versus control arm looks 
overall comparable between gender and, as expected, the proportion of subjects in the Pooled Combo SD 
with an ECOG status of 0 who experienced AEs was generally lower than that of subjects with an ECOG 
status of 1. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The pembrolizumab/chemotherapy regimen was overall more toxic than chemotherapy alone or 
pembrolizumab monotherapy, especially in older patients. An additive effect of the immune check-point 
inhibitor on toxicities due to cytotoxic agents was observed, as well as an increased incidence of AEOSI such 
as pneumonitis and renal disorders that occurred at uncommon frequency in pembrolizumab monotherapy. 
Some adverse events (or the combination of AEs) are of concern and highlight the need for special 
awareness for treating physicians (such as severe and serious febrile neutropenia associated with fatal 
events, acute kidney injury and nephritis. Toxicities observed with the combination compared to 
chemotherapy alone were similar between cisplatin and carboplatin-based regimens. Due to the partial 
overlapping of the target population of the sought indication with non-squamous NSCLC patients expressing 
high levels of PD-L1 (TPS ≥50%) for whom pembrolizumab monotherapy is recommended as SOC, 
evaluation of the B/R ratio on an individual basis should be considered by treating physicians in treatment 
decision-making, as supported by the experimental evidence reported in the SmPC.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptablefor the following reasons: 
- A CHMP request was received during variation EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0023/G (new indications in urothelial 
carcinoma approved on 24-Aug-2017) to perform new user testing considering that all sections of the 
package leaflet were affected since marketing authorization. The proposed revisions included in this 
variation for 1L NSCLC do not constitute significant changes that would require the need to conduct a new 
user consultation. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
The MAH proposes an extension of indication for KEYTRUDA as add-on therapy to platinum-pemetrexed 
chemotherapy in the first-line setting of non-squamous NSCLC negative for EGFR and ALK gene aberrations. 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Lung cancer is the main cause of malignancy-related mortality worldwide, accounting for 1.69 million of 
deaths globally per year as estimated by the World Health Organization (WHO). Around 85%-90% of all lung 
cancers are Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), that include non-squamous (i.e, adenocarcinoma, 
large-cell carcinoma, and other cell types) and squamous (epidermoid) cell carcinoma (Brambilla et al, 2014 
and Schrump DS et al. NSCLC; Principles and Practice of Oncology. 9th Edition. 2011). During the last 25 
years, the distribution of NSCLC histological types changed in Europe, with a decrease of squamous cell 
carcinoma and an increase of adenocarcinoma in men, while in women there was an increase of both 
histologies.  
Non-squamous NSCLC is the prevailing histological type diagnosed in never smoker NSCLC patients, with a 
higher prevalence in females than males. More than half of the patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage

of disease, which directly contributes to poor survival, as expressed by an untreated median OS of 4 months 
and a metastatic 5-year survival rate of <5% (Lindsey A. et al, 2016). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In the first-line setting in non-squamous NSCLC not harbouring driver mutations (i.e, EGFR, ALK and ROS1 
negative disease), chemotherapy represents the recommended choice for patients presenting with a tumour 
PD-L1 score <50%. Platinum-based doublets (four to a maximum of six cycles) are considered the standard 
of care in patients with PS 0-1, as well as selected PS 2 and adequate organ function, with no major 
differences in terms of efficacy across combinations. Among these, platinum/pemetrexed represents a valid 
alternative and consists of a first induction phase with the two cytotoxic agents, followed by a continuation 
maintenance treatment with pemetrexed only, in the absence of progression after the first cycles of 
combined chemotherapy (ESMO guidelines). Introduction into clinical practice of this therapeutic scheme 
was based upon the positive results of the Phase III PARAMOUNT trial, providing evidence for an OS 
advantage of cisplatin induction (4 cycles) followed by pemetrexed over cisplatin induction plus placebo 
(median 13.9 months versus 11.0 months, hazard ratio = 0.78, 95%CI=0.64-0.96, p=0.0195) that was 
consistent across patient subgroups (including disease stage, induction response, ECOG PS, smoking status, 
gender, histology and age).   
With the advent of pembrolizumab and its approval (2016) in the 1L setting as monotherapy in NSCLC with 
TPS ≥50% based on the positive results of the phase III, randomized, KEYNOTE-024 study (i.e PFS HR: 
0.50, p<0.001; OS HR: 0.60, p=0.005 pembrolizumab vs a SOC platinum-based doublet), this is now 
indicated as first-choice also in non-squamous NSCLC patients highly expressing tumour PD-L1 (TPS 
≥50%). (ESMO eUpdate 28 June 2017). However, there remains substantial unmet medical need for 
patients with previously untreated nonsquamous NSCLC. Available systemic therapies, except that for 
tumors not harbouring EGFR sensitizing mutations or ALK rearrangements, can only determine a limited 
improvement in survival up to 8–12 months, with an enhanced symptom control and a better quality of life 
in 60%–70% despite treatment toxicity (Leighl NB. et al, 2012). In addition,  a fraction of subjects with 
highly expressing tumour PD-L1 (TPS ≥50%) does not derive benefit from pembrolizumab as monotherapy, 
and only 25% to 30% of patients with NSCLC have tumours with a PD-L1 TPS ≥50%. 
KEYTRUDA as monotherapy is already part of the treatment algorithm of NSCLC, with a licensed indication 
in the following therapeutic settings: 
-  Second-line in locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC in adults whose tumour express PD-L1 with a 
≥1% TPS and who have received at least one prior chemotherapy regimen, and targeted therapy for 
patients with EGFR and ALK positive tumour mutations 
- 
First-line in metastatic NSCLC (including both squamous and non-squamous hystology) in adults 
whose tumours express PD-L1 with a ≥50% TPS and no EGFR or ALK positive tumour mutations. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The current application is based upon results of the Phase III KEYNOTE-189 trial, a Randomized, 
Double-Blind, Study of Platinum+ Pemetrexed Chemotherapy with or without Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in 
First Line Metastatic Nonsquamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Subjects. This is an ongoing study currently 
at its first interim analysis (IA1; date cut-off: 08 Nov 2017). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
•  A more favourable outcome of pembrolizumab combination versus control in terms of OS was 
demonstrated in the overall study population (HR=0.49 [95% CI: 0.38,0.64]; p<0.00001)  
Assessment report  
EMA/548820/2018 
Page 85/89 
 
 
  
•  A gain of about 4.7 months in median PFS (HR=0.52 [0.43, 0.64]; p<0.00001) was reported for the 
pembrolizumab combination vs control in the overall population. 
•  ORR was 47.6% vs 18.9% in the pembrolizumab combination vs control respectively, resulting in 
28.5% difference in response rates in the overall population. Additionally the median DOR was 11.2 
months for the pembrolizumab combination and 7.8 months for the control. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
• 
Immaturity in OS (57% of events at the planned IA1); however the MAH committed to provide 
updated data as post-authorisation measure with the CSR to be expected by June 2021  
•  Decreased survival (HR=2.09 [0.84, 5.23] in OS), reduction in PFS (HR=1.73 [0.77,3.90] and an 
increase in ORR (14.4% difference [-11.1,36.4]) induced by pembrolizumab combination in patients 
aged ≥ 75 years; the limited sample size of this subgroup does not allow definitive conclusions to be 
made and the limitations have been reflected in sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC. 
• 
Lack of comparison with a control arm consisting of pembrolizumab in monotherapy for NSCLC 
patients with TPS≥50% (reflecting currently licensed indication); in the absence of direct 
comparative analysis, the B/R should be considered on an individual basis by treating physicians on 
the basis of experimental data as detailed in sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
• 
• 
In KEYNOTE-189, frequency of drug-related Grade 3-5 AEs (48.4% vs 39.6%), and of subjects who 
discontinued any drug due to either AEs (27.7% vs 14.9%), or drug-related AEs (21.0% vs 8.4%), 
or SAEs (18.8% vs 9.4) or drug-related SAEs (13.3 vs 3.5) were all increased in patients treated 
with pembrolizumab+chemotherapy compared to those who received chemotherapy only. 
Patients treated with pembrolizumab+chemotherapy displayed a higher occurrence of drug-related  
Diarrhoea (20.1% vs 11.7%), Thrombocytopenia (14.8% vs 11.7%), Lacrimation increased (12.7% 
vs 8%), %), Constipation (16.8% vs 11.4%), Rash (14.8% vs 9.8%), Alanine Aminotransferase 
increase (11.3% vs 9.1%), Blood creatinine increased (9.2% vs 6.1%), Febrile neutropenia (5.3% 
vs 1.5%), Acute kidney injury (3.7% vs 0.4%), Pyrexia (6.1% vs 1.9%), Dysgeusia (10% vs 8%), 
Peripheral Oedema (7.8% vs 5.7%). Moreover, an increased rate of drug-related AEOSI for 
pembrolizumab were generally reported in the combined regimen than in pembrolizumab 
monotherapy, with particular reference to pneumonitis (4.1% vs 3.1% in the Pooled Combo and 
Cumulative Reference SD; 1.1% in the Pooled Chemo) and nephritis (1.4% vs 0.2% in the Pooled 
Combo and Cumulative Reference SD; 0% in the Pooled Chemo). 
• 
The most common drug-related AEs leading to pembrolizumab discontinuation in the Pooled Pembro 
Combo were Pneumonitis (2.5% vs 1.1% in Pooled Chemo) and Acute kidney injury (2% vs 0% in 
Pooled Chemo). The incidence of these drug-related AEs in the group treated with pembrolizumab in 
combination to chemotherapy was higher also in comparison to pembrolizumab monotherapy (1.2% 
and 0.1% for Pneumonitis and Acute kidney injury, respectively in the Reference dataset). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
•  Differences in safety between elderly and younger patients were observed in all treatment arms, but 
appear partially more pronounced in the Pooled Combo SD (e.g. for subjects with 75-84 years 
73.2% grade 3-5 AEs, 17.1% death due to AEs, 31.7% discontinuations due to an AE, 24.4% 
discontinuations due to SAEs). Moreover, for subjects with 75-84 years a high rate of CV events 
(34.1%) and cerebrovascular events (12.2%) was observed in the Pooled Combo SD (compared to 
Assessment report  
EMA/548820/2018 
Page 86/89 
 
 
  
8.3% and 0%, respectively in the Pooled Chemo SD). Thus, the tolerability of the combination 
therapy in subjects of ≥75 year could be questioned, but the sample size in this subgroup might be 
not sufficient to draw reliable conclusions. This has been reflected in the SmPC.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Immune check-point inhibitors are expected to improve clinical outcomes in patients co-treated with 
chemotherapy, through a potentiating effect on the anti-tumour immunological activity induced by the 
cytotoxic agents. According with this, an add-on value of pembrolizumab to the platinum/pemetrexed 
treatment scheme has been generally demonstrated in the KEYNOYTE-189 trial, in term of both OS and PFS.  
Pembrolizumab in co-administration to platinum/pemetrexed seems to potentiate the toxic effects of the 
cytotoxic agents, as demonstrated by an increased rate of drug-related myelosuppression, gastrointestinal 
effects, and renal disorders in patients exposed to the combined therapy compared to those receiving 
platinum/pemetrexed only. On the other hand, chemotherapy appears to increase the immunological 
toxicity of pembrolizumab, considering that a higher frequency of nephritis was observed in the 
experimental arm compared to control.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Results from KEYNOTE-189 study are considered sufficient to establish a positive B/R in the sought 
indication for the first line treatment of metastatic non-squamous NSCLC in combination with pemetrexed 
and platinum. The efficacy and safety profile of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy, 
particularly within the subgroups of patients with TPS≥50% and ≥75-year old has been adequately 
described in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy for the first-line 
treatment  of  metastatic  non-squamous  NSCLC  in  adults  whose  tumours  have  no  EGFR  or  ALK  positive 
mutations is positive.

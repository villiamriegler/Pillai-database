1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Viela Bio submitted on 23 November 2020 an application for marketing authorisation to 
the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Uplizna, through the centralised procedure falling within the 
Article  3(1)  and  point  4  of  Annex  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004.  The  eligibility  to  the  centralised 
procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 19 November 2020.  
Uplizna, was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/17/1856 on 20 March 2017 in the following 
condition: Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal 
Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Uplizna as an orphan medicinal product in the approved 
indication. More information on the COMP’s review can be found in the orphan maintenance assessment 
report published under the ‘Assessment history’ tab on the Agency’s website:  
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/Uplizna 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Uplizna is indicated for the treatment of adults with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) 
to reduce the risk of attacks and associated worsening of disability. 
1.2.  Legal basis, dossier content 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical 
and  clinical  data  based  on  applicants’  own  tests  and  studies  and/or  bibliographic  literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
1.3.  Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant  to  Article  7  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006,  the  application  included  an  EMA  Decision(s) 
P/0428/2020 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At  the  time  of  submission  of  the  application,  the  PIP  P/0428/2020  was  not  yet  completed  as  some 
measures were deferred. 
The PDCO issued an opinion on compliance for the PIP P/0428/2020. 
1.4.  Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
1.4.1.  Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised

Prof. Luca Pani 
There are no available scientific guidelines for the development of products intended for the treatment 
of NMOSD.  
SA on Uplizna was provided to MedImmune, as the clinical trial sponsor, in 2013 including questions on 
Chemical, Pharmaceutical and Biological development, toxico-Pharmacological development and Clinical 
development  (EMEA/H/SA/2664/1/2013/III).  Regarding  this  last  section,  SA  was  provided  to  the 
applicant for several aspects including mechanisms of action, study population, study design features 
(randomisation scheme and particularly the use of a placebo-controlled trial), sample size estimations, 
primary endpoint (definition of the event and role of adjudication committee), secondary endpoints and 
pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) modelling.  
Advices given regarding the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological development have been followed 
by the applicant. 
Of note, the CHMP showed some concerns on the inclusion of Aquaporin
4 Immunoglobulin G antibodies 
(AQP4-IgG) seronegative patients: (1) paucity of scientific evidence supporting this role; (2) potential 
negative  impact  for  the  assessment  derived  from  the  inclusion  of  a  heterogeneous  group  [AQP4-IgG 
‐
seropositive  and  AQP4-IgG  seronegative  are  different.  Additionally,  AQP4-  is  a  heterogeneous  group 
itself];  (3)  the  study  was  not  powered  for  assessing  the  efficacy  of  inebilizumab  in  AQP4-IgG 
seronegative  patients  based  on  sample  size  considerations  and  the  analysis  plan  presented  by  the 
applicant (EMEA/H/SA/2664/1/2013/III).   
Instead  of  using  the  time  to  first  on-trial  adjudicated  relapse  as  primary  efficacy  endpoint,  the  SA 
EMEA/H/SA/2664/1/2013/III  recommended  using  investigator-confirmed  attacks  for  the  primary 
analyses  and  to  conduct  sensitivity  analyses  using  the  adjudicated  cases.  This  advice  has  not  been 
followed by the applicant. However, all pivotal trials for Inebilizumab, Eculizumab and Satralizumab used 
adjudicated events (relapses) for primary endpoint.   
The  applicant’s  proposal  of  hierarchical  key  secondary  endpoints  was  endorsed  during  the  SA.  The 
proposal included the following endpoints to be evaluated only in AQP4-IgG seropositive subjects in this 
order: (1) expanded disability status scale (EDSS) worsening, (2) change in low-contrast visual acuity, 
(3) number of attack-related medical facility visits, (4) change in quality of life by short-form-36 and (5) 
time from Day-1 to onset of confirmed attack on or before Day-183. In the submitted application, key 
secondary endpoints evaluated in AQP4-IgG seropositive and in the full-study population included: (1) 
EDSS  worsening,  (2)  change  in  binocular  low-contrast  visual  acuity,  (3)  cumulative  total  magnetic

resonance  imaging  (MRI)  lesions  and  (4)  number  of  NMOSD-related  in-patient  hospitalisations.  The 
proposed and endorsed hierarchical order during SA was not fully followed.  
A following SA was obtained in 2015 regarding the use of Placebo-controlled trial without background 
immunosuppressive therapy (IST) (EMEA/H/SA/2664/1/FU/1/2015/II), which agreed with placebo use 
under certain conditions to limit placebo exposure (e.g. unequal randomisation; use of a time-to-event 
outcome; limiting the time on placebo in a given patient to a maximum of 6.5 months). These conditions 
were met in current pivotal study.  
The  applicant  held  a  pre-submission  meeting  with  the  Product  Lead  and  Regulatory  Affairs  team 
November 2019 and received written feedback from the Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur teams in March 
2020.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD; also known as Devic’s syndrome and previously known 
as  neuromyelitis  optica  [NMO])  is  a  rare,  chronic,  autoimmune,  inflammatory,  disorder  of  the  central 
nervous system (CNS) manifesting clinically as optic neuritis, myelitis, and certain brain and brainstem 
syndromes. Cases clinically diagnosed as NMOSD may include AQP4-IgG seropositive patients and AQP4-
IgG seronegative patients.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
The epidemiology of NMOSD is complex and differs greatly depending on the region and the ethnicity of 
the study population. The incidence of NMOSD is estimated between 0.05-0.4 per 100,000 population, 
and the prevalence estimates vary from 0.5-10 per 100,000 population. The prevalence among white 
people is ~1/100,000 population, with an annual incidence of <1/million population. Among East Asians, 
the prevalence is higher, at ~3.5/100,000 population, while the prevalence in African people may be up 
to 10/100,000 population.  
AQP4-antibody disease has a high female-to-male ratio (up to 9:1), and its mean age at onset of ~40 
years is later than that seen in multiple sclerosis, though onset can occur throughout the lifespan. Onset 
in childhood occurs very rarely and the paediatric manifestation of NMOSD is poorly understood.  
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder is a distinct, although heterogeneous, disease (Wingerchuk et 
al, 2007). A defining feature of NMOSD is the presence of serum AQP4-IgG, which is detected in about 
80-90% of NMOSD patients (Jarius and Wildemann, 2010; Pittock and Lucchinetti, 2016). Aquaporin-4 
is the most abundant water channel expressed on the plasma membrane of astrocytes throughout the 
CNS. AQP4-IgG is thought to be pathogenic by causing astrocyte loss through complement-dependent 
mechanisms,  antibody-dependent  cellular  phagocytosis  (ADCP)  and  antibody-dependent  cellular 
cytotoxicity (ADCC), and/or by unfavourably altering astrocyte physiology by reducing expression of key 
water channel proteins (Ratelade and Verkman, 2012). 
Pathogenic  AQP4-IgG  is  produced  by  B-lineage  cells,  specifically  a  subpopulation  of  CD19-positive 
(CD19+)  CD20-negative  (CD20-)  B  cells  showing  morphological  and  phenotypical  properties  of 
Assessment report  
EMA/266309/2022  
Page 9/137 
 
 
 
plasmablasts  (Chihara  et  al,  2011).  These  cells  are  increased  selectively  in  the  peripheral  blood  of 
NMOSD  patients  (Chihara  et  al,  2011;  Kim  W  et  al,  2011;  Greenberg  et  al,  2012),  and  are  further 
expanded in the periphery; they are also found in the CNS at the time of NMOSD attack (Chihara et al, 
2011; Kowarik et al, 2017). 
Even using the most reliable assays, there are subsets of subjects who do not test seropositive for AQP4-
IgG who may still present with NMOSD phenotype. Some of the “seronegative” NMOSD patients have 
antibodies to myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (Kitley et al, Nov 2012; Kitley et al, 2014), and others 
may  have  autoantibodies  that  have  not  yet  been  identified.  Different  etiological  mechanisms  may  be 
involved in AQP4-IgG seronegative NMOSD (Kitley et al, Sep 2012; Mader et al, 2011; Jarius et al, 2012).  
Occasionally, patients without detectable serum AQP4-IgG are later found to be seropositive. There may 
be  technical  explanations  in  some  cases,  but  antibody  levels  also  increase  with  clinical  relapses  and 
decrease with immunosuppressive therapy in some patients. Therefore, retesting should be considered 
before B-cell or antibody-targeted therapies (plasma exchange, immunosuppressive drugs) are instituted 
and in seronegative patients who relapse. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
The  diagnosis  of  NMOSD  relies  on  a  clinician’s  assessment  of  a  patient’s  history  and  findings  being 
consistent  with  consensus  international  clinical  criteria  for  NMOSD  (2015  International  Panel  on  NMO 
Diagnosis (IPND) criteria) (Table 1). 
Assessment report  
EMA/266309/2022  
Page 10/137 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 1: IPND Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorders Diagnostic Criteria 
The  disease  is  characterised  by  attacks  of  predominantly  ON  and  longitudinally  extensive  transverse 
myelitis, and, less frequently, affecting the brain and brainstem. Commonly reported symptoms include 
ocular  pain,  unilateral  and  bilateral  loss  of  visual  acuity  that  can  reach  blindness,  loss  of  sensation, 
weakness including paraplegia, bladder and bowel dysfunction, paroxysmal tonic spasms of the trunk 
and limbs, and Lhermitte’s phenomenon (Wingerchuk et al, 2007).  
Up to 90% of patients with NMOSD have relapsing episodes of ON and myelitis rather than following a 
monophasic  course  (Ghezzi  et  al,  2004;  Wingerchuk  et  al,  1999).  The  monophasic  NMOSD  is  a 
recognizable clinical entity but the criteria that accurately predict long-term adherence to a monophasic 
course  cannot  currently  be  defined.  An  interval  longer  than  4  weeks  between  index  attacks  indicates 
relapsing  disease  (Wingerchuk  et  al,  2015).  A  second  attack  occurs  within  1 year  of  onset  in  60% of 
seropositive patients and within 3 years in 90% of  patients. Few patients who experience an NMOSD 
relapse  have  a  full  recovery.  More  than  half  of  patients  with  NMOSD  have  permanent  blindness  or 
paralysis as the result of NMOSD relapses. If inflammation compromises brainstem regions involved in 
breathing  or  heart  function,  which  occurs  rarely,  NMOSD  relapses  can  be  fatal  due  to  neurogenic 
respiratory failure (Oh and Levy, 2012).  
Differential  diagnosis  between  NMOSD  and  conditions  that  may  cause  myelitis  and  ON  by  other 
mechanisms is important to establish as some MS immunotherapies appear to aggravate NMOSD.

2.1.5.  Management 
Patients  who  are  AQP4-IgG  seropositive  should  be  assumed  to  be  at  risk  for  relapse  indefinitely  and 
preventive  treatment  should  be  considered,  even  in  the  setting  of  a  prolonged  clinical  remission 
(Wingerchuk et al, 2015).  
Current treatments for NMOSD are aimed at prevention of attacks, acute management of attacks, and 
amelioration of persistent symptoms. Patients with NMOSD have been treated prophylactically for attack 
prevention  with  off-label  IST  such  as  azathioprine,  mycophenolate  mofetil,  daily  prednisone,  or 
rituximab.  High-dose  steroids  and  plasmapheresis  are  generally  used  for  the  acute  management  of 
attacks.  Symptomatic  treatments  are  used  to  address  symptoms,  which  can  include  general  and 
neuropathic  pain  (e.g,  anti-epileptics,  anti-spasmodics,  anti-depressants,  or  analgesics),  bowel  (e.g, 
laxatives), bladder (e.g, bethanechol), and fatigue and depression (e.g, psychotherapy or medication) 
disorders (Kessler et al, 2016). 
Since 2019 to the date of this report, two new therapies have been authorised in the EU for the treatment 
of APQ4-IgG seropositive NMOSD patients. Blockade of complement-mediated damage by eculizumab is 
approved for AQP4-IgG+ NMOSD patients with a relapsing course of the disease (2019). Satralizumab, 
a  humanised  interleukin-6  (IL-6)  receptor  antagonist  is  for  the  treatment  of  NMOSD  in  adult  and 
adolescent  patients  from  12  years  of  age  who  are  AQP4-IgG  positive.  There  are  other  treatment 
strategies being tested in phase I and II for treatment of NMOSD. 
Results of uncontrolled studies with rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the human 
CD20 molecule, provide low level evidence for utility of B-cell depletion as a means of preventing attacks 
in NMOSD (Cree et al, 2005; Jacob et al, 2008; Bedi et al, 2011; Kim SH et al, 2011; Ip et al, 2013). B-
cell  analysis  of  rituximab  failures  revealed  the  presence  of  CD19+/CD20-  plasmablasts  (unpublished 
data,  Dr  Larry  Steinman,  Stanford  University),  which  supports  the  need  for  a  more  comprehensive  B 
cell-depleting  therapy  than  rituximab  for  effective  treatment  of  this  disease.  CD19  is  expressed  on  a 
wider  lineage  of  B  cells,  from  pro-B  to  plasmablasts  and  some  plasma  cells,  compared to  CD20.  It is 
therefore conceivable that direct depletion of CD19+ B cells could be more effective in reducing the risk 
for NMOSD attack by more effectively depleting plasmablasts producing AQP4-IgG. 
The  preventive  therapy  has  been  regarded  as  beneficial,  and  the  scarce  published  data  provide  an 
indication of a preventive effect to an extent; consensus treatment regimens have been published and 
are  widely  used  throughout  the  world  with  an  apparent  clinical  benefit.  Nevertheless,  an  adequate 
evidence base of randomised controlled trials has been lacking to support these currently used treatment 
options. Thus, an unmet medical need for highly effective and specific therapies has long been prevalent.   
2.2.  About the product 
Inebilizumab is a humanised, affinity-optimised, afucosylated IgG1 kappa (IgG1κ) mAb that binds to the 
B  cell-specific  surface  antigen  CD19,  resulting  in  a  profound  depletion  of  B  cells;  these  include 
plasmablasts and some plasma cells via ADCC and ADCP mechanisms.  
Inebilizumab is generated by expression of the human CD19-specific mAb 16C4 in a fucosyltransferase-
deficient  Chinese  hamster  ovary  producer  cell  line,  thereby  generating  a  homogenously  afucosylated 
antibody with enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.

The claimed indication was the following:  
Uplizna  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adults  with  neuromyelitis  optica  spectrum  disorders 
(NMOSD) to reduce the risk of attacks and associated worsening of disability (see section 5.1).  
The approved indication is the following:  
Uplizna is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with neuromyelitis optica 
spectrum  disorders  (NMOSD)  who  are  anti-aquaporin-4  immunoglobulin  G  (AQP4-IgG) 
seropositive see section 5.1). 
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
N/A 
2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The  finished  product  (FP)  is  presented  as  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  containing  100  mg  of 
inebilizumab as active substance (AS).  
Other  ingredients  are:  L-histidine,  L-histidine  hydrochloride  monohydrate,  sodium  chloride,  trehalose 
dihydrate, polysorbate 80 and water for injection. 
The product is available in glass vials, each vial containing 100 mg of inebilizumab in a concentration of 
10 mg/mL as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. The final concentration after dilution is 1.0 mg/mL. 
2.4.2.  Active substance 
2.4.2.1.  General information 
The  AS,  inebilizumab  (INN)  is  a  recombinant  humanised  IgG1κ  monoclonal  antibody  (mAb)  directed 
against CD19 and therefore targets the B-lineage plasmablasts.  
The Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO)-cell line used for inebilizumab expression has been designed to be 
fucosyltransferase-deficient  (i.e.  lost the  ability  to  transfer  fucose),  and  the  N-linked  oligosaccharides 
attached  at  the  residue  Asn-301  are  therefore  homogenously  afucosylated  without  core  fucosylation 
thereby increasing the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular 
phagocytosis (ADCP) activities. 
2.4.2.2.  Manufacture, process controls and characterisation 
Inebilizumab  AS  is  manufactured  by  a  standard  mAb  manufacturing  process  at  an  AstraZeneca 
Pharmaceuticals  LP  Frederick  Manufacturing  Center  (FMC)  manufacturing  site  in  Maryland  USA.  Good 
Manufacturing Practice (GMP) compliance has been documented for all sites involved.

Description  of  manufacturing  process  and  process  controlsThe  manufacturing  process  of 
inebilizumab AS encompasses cell culture, harvest and primary capture, purification including orthogonal 
dedicated virus clearance steps, concentration, formulation and filtration to final fill. Dilution buffer and 
excipient  addition  buffer  are  added  to  the  product  in  quantities  calculated  to  achieve  the  target 
composition.  
The manufacturing process, process parameters (including criticality assignment), the material inputs 
and  process  outputs  (in-process  controls  (IPCs),  microbial  controls,  and  performance  attributes)  are 
summarised.  The  purpose  of  each  step  is  clearly  stated,  and  a  brief  description  is  provided.  Several 
critical process parameters (CPPs) and IPCs have been identified. The acceptance criteria for the process 
parameters and IPCs, as well as action limits for process outputs, are also included and generally justified 
by  process  characterisation  data.  The  manufacturing  process  and  process  controls  are  considered 
acceptable. 
Control of materials 
All  raw  materials  used  in  the  cell  banking,  cell  culture  and  purification  processes  are  either  tested 
according  to in-house  criteria  or  according to  US  pharmacopeia  (USP),  European  Pharmacopoeia  (Ph. 
Eur.), or Japan Pharmacopoeia (JP). Importantly, excipients are tested according to Ph. Eur. Materials 
are inspected upon receipt, and supplier certificates of analysis are reviewed. The internal specifications 
for the non-compendial raw materials are available. 
The cell culture media and nutrient feeds are confirmed to be free of animal proteins.  
Supplier certificates of analysis and certificate of origin are available for all raw materials of biological 
origin and transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) Certificate of Suitability is provided for all 
relevant materials of animal origin or a risk assessment was considered sufficient. Based on the provided 
risk assessment, the confirmed bovine spongiform encephalopathies (BSE)-free status of the animal and 
selective sourcing from ‘negligible BSE risk’-countries, it is agreed that the risk for BSE is sufficiently low 
for these two raw materials. 
A detailed description of the source, history and generation of the cell substrate is provided giving no 
reason  for  concern.  The  CHO-cell  line  used  for  inebilizumab  expression  is  fucosyltransferase-deficient 
and has therefore lost the ability to transfer fucose, resulting in a homogenously afucosylated antibody. 
The cell banking system employed for inebilizumab is a standard two-tiered system. All cell banks have 
been tested in accordance with relevant guidelines and the results confirm the suitability of the master 
cell bank (MCB) and WCB. Cell line stability has been sufficiently demonstrated. 
In conclusion, the control of material section is considered to contain sufficient information.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
In-process  bioburden  controls  are  in  place  for  all AS manufacturing  steps  with  associated  acceptance 
criteria for the Production Bioreactor step, and action limits for the rest of the steps. In-process endotoxin 
controls are in place for all steps from harvest and onwards.  
Hold times for the AS process intermediates have been validated.  
Process validation and evaluation 
Process validation has been performed with three consecutive and successful batches at the commercial 
scale  manufactured  with  the  commercial  Process  3  process.  The  manufacturing  process  for  AS  is 
considered validated. 
Assessment report

Efficient and robust clearance of the process-related impurities was demonstrated, supporting that 
testing for these impurities can be omitted from the AS release specification. The data also 
demonstrate efficient clearance of host cell protein, which remains controlled at AS release.  
Manufacturing process development 
History and comparability 
Four  manufacturing  processes  were  used  during  the  development:  Pilot  Process  (for  non-clinical 
toxicology),  Process  1  (for  clinical  trials),  Process  2  (for  clinical  trials  including  the  pivotal  trial),  and 
Process 3 (used for commercial manufacturing). Process 2, and not Process 3 material, has been used 
for manufacturing the pivotal phase 2/3 clinical batches. 
Overall, the manufacturing history and comparability exercises are described in sufficient detail and the 
results support comparability of product quality when manufactured with the different processes during 
development. The test panel included in the comparability exercise covers relevant attributes. 
Critical quality attributes, control strategy and process characterisation  
Critical quality attributes (CQAs) and control strategy: The assigned CQAs are supported. The proposed 
control strategy is found sufficiently comprehensive to ensure acceptable quality of CQAs. 
Process characterisation: Extensive process characterisation studies have been executed to determine 
the impact of the process parameters on product quality, resulting in parameter classification as critical 
or  non-critical  process  parameters.  Several  elements  of  Quality-by-Design  (QbD)  (risk  assessments, 
multivariate  design  of  experiments,  statistical  tools)  are  applied.  The  results  from  the  process 
characterisation support the acceptance ranges presented. 
A robust process understanding is demonstrated and the classification of CPP and non-CPP is supported 
with an extensive number of identified CPPs. 
Lastly,  contact  materials  which  may  introduce  leachables  have  been  evaluated  based  on  the  vendor-
provided  extractable  data.  As  all  leachable  exposures  were  below  the  appropriate  Threshold  of 
Toxicological Concern (TTC) level, it is agreed that these contact materials pose a negligible safety risk. 
Characterisation 
Inebilizumab  has  been  sufficiently  characterised  in  accordance  with  EMA/CHMP/BWP/532517/2008, 
‘Guideline on development, production, characterisation and specification for monoclonal antibodies and 
related products’.  
The  primary  sequence,  secondary  and  tertiary  structure  and  post  translational  modifications  of 
inebilizumab were characterised by state-of-the-art analytical methods and found to be consistent with 
the  expected  theoretical  values.  Moreover,  inebilizumab  has  the  expected  biological  properties. 
Inebilizumab contains N-linked glycosylation at position Asn-301 of each heavy chain in the Fc part of 
the molecule. As expected, the detected glycoforms were afucosylated as inebilizumab is expressed in a 
cell line engineered to produce afucosylated structures.  
Product  variants  of  inebilizumab  are  defined  as  variants  with  no  impact  on  safety  or  efficacy.  Safety 
evaluations  concluded  that  the  presence  of  these  variants  pose  no  or  minimal  risk  to  patients  as  the 
variants are either naturally occurring within endogenous proteins (such as glycation and Asn-388 and 
Asn-393 deamidation (acidic variants)) or will be processed in vivo (such as cleavage of additional C-
terminal lysine (basic variants)). The characterisation and evaluation of the safety and efficacy of these 
variants is considered sufficient and acceptable.

Impurities 
Levels  of  product-related  impurities  in  representative  inebilizumab  AS  batches  from  manufacturing 
processes 1, 2, and 3 were evaluated. In general, low levels of product-related impurities were found.  
The characterisation study also concluded that the maximum levels found in representative AS batches 
had no effect on the biological activity or PK of the product, as determined by one or several relevant 
assays. During the assessment limits for certain product-related impurities in AS and FP at release and 
stability were tightened to better reflect process capability. Process-related impurities arise from the cell 
substrates,  cell  culture,  and  purification  processing  Data  from  manufacturing  history  and  small-scale 
clearance studies demonstrated that during the manufacturing process, Process-related impurities are 
robustly cleared to levels below clinically relevant specifications and levels defined in EU, FDA or WHO 
guidelines and /or controlled at the level of the AS.  
The characterisation and evaluation of product and process related impurities is acceptable. 
2.4.2.3.  Specification 
The AS specifications include general tests, test for total protein, purity, potency identity, impurities, and 
safety. 
Upon request, some specification limits have been recalculated and tightened.  
The proposed AS release specifications are accepted for the initial marketing authorisation.  
Analytical methods and acceptance criteria 
The panel of methods used to assure the quality of the AS is considered broad and in accordance with 
ICH Q6B, Ph. Eur. 2031, and EMA/CHMP/BWP/532517/2008. All methods are validated and considered 
suitable for their intended use. Product specific verification of the compendial methods was conducted, 
confirming that inebilizumab AS does not inhibit or in other ways affect the methods. 
Acceptance  criteria  are  set  according to one  of  three  approaches:  Published limits  approach,  Stability 
limits approach or Non-stability limits approach. The Stability limits approach takes into consideration 
process  and  assay  variation  along  with  process  capability  evaluated  through  batch  data  and  rate  of 
change during stability. The Non-stability approach is based on findings from product characterisation 
and manufacturing process capability.  
Batch analysis  
The submitted batch data from process 1 , process 2  and process 3  batches confirm batch consistency 
within  each  process,  and  low  variation  between  manufacturing  processes  as  confirmed  in  process 
development comparability studies. 
Reference materials  
A two-tiered reference standard system has been introduced for inebilizumab, comprising of a Primary 
Reference Standard (PRS) and Working Reference Standards (WRS).  
Container closure 
Compatibility  between  the  container  closure  and  inebilizumab  AS has  been  evaluated  through  the  AS 
stability studies.  
Assessment report  
EMA/266309/2022  
Page 16/137 
 
 
 
2.4.2.4.  Stability 
Stability studies based on ICH guidelines have been conducted for the active substance. 
Relevant parameters were selected to study the stability profile of the active substance.  
The analytical methods were validated and are described in the relevant sections of the dossier. The data 
from primary stability and supporting stability studies support the proposed shelf life at the designated 
storage condition in the proposed container closure system.  
2.4.3.  Finished medicinal product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The inebilizumab finished product (FP) is a sterile, concentrate for solution for infusion. It has a label 
claim of 100 mg of inebilizumab in a 10 mL volume. The FP is aseptically filled into 10R clear glass vials 
(single use) closed with elastomeric stoppers, capped with an aluminium seal and packaged as 3 vials 
per carton, sufficient for preparation of a single 300 mg dose.  
Besides  the  active  ingredient,  inebilizumab,  the  composition  comprises  only  compendial  excipients, 
typically used for formulating mAbs: L-histidine, L-histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, sodium chloride, 
trehalose  dihydrate,  polysorbate  80  and  water  for  injection.  The  excipients  were  chosen  to  provide 
optimal buffering capacity, enhance stability, and protect the antibody during manufacture and storage. 
An overfill is applied for the vials to ensure a deliverable volume of 10 mL. 
Formulation development and robustness 
The proposed commercial FP formulation is overall the same as the formulation used during the clinical 
trials. Importantly, Process 2 and Process 3 formulations and vial presentations are identical, hence the 
inebilizumab FP tested in the pivotal clinical study corresponds to the intended commercial presentation.  
The results from univariate and multivariate studies support the robustness of the intended commercial 
formulation.  The  rationale  used  to  select  the  final  composition/formulation  has  been  sufficiently 
described. 
Manufacturing process development – history and comparability 
The FP was produced using three different processes: Process 1, Process 2 and Process 3, the 
current, commercial formulation. The changes between FP manufacturing processes are summarised. 
The comparability study including inebilizumab FP from the Process 2 and Process 3 is found sufficient 
with confirmation of comparable product quality and stability. 
Process characterisation  
Process characterisation studies have been executed to determine the impact of the process parameters 
on product quality, resulting in parameter classification (non-CPP versus CPP). Several elements of QbD 
(risk assessments, multivariate design of experiments, statistical tools) are applied, but no design space 
is claimed. The process characterisation presented is considered sufficiently comprehensive. The results 
from the process characterisation support most of the acceptance ranges presented in in the dossier.  
Product-contact material compatibility and photosensitivity  
A material product compatibility study was conducted to confirm that no meaningful change occurred to 
the  FP  quality  when  inebilizumab  FP  was  exposed  to  various  product-contact  materials  at  worst-case 
Assessment report  
EMA/266309/2022  
Page 17/137 
 
 
 
conditions  and  at  manufacturing-representative  durations.  The  results  are  acceptable.  The  risk  of 
leachables from product contact materials was also evaluated and found sufficiently low. 
Photosensitivity was evaluated by worst-case cumulative light exposures.  
Collectively,  robust  process  and  environmental-impact  understanding  are  demonstrated  and  the 
classification of CPP/non-CPP and the control strategy is supported. 
Compatibility and in-use stability  
The section on compatibility includes in-use stability testing. The inebilizumab FP must be diluted in 0.9% 
(w/v) saline prior to IV bag dose administration. Biochemical compatibility of the inebilizumab FP was 
assessed using intravenous (IV) bags containing saline and with an administration set with a 0.2 μm in-
line  filter.  The  results  confirm  biochemical  compatibility  at  both  in-use  storage  temperatures.  In  the 
SmPC, the claimed in-use storage is 2-8°C for up to 24 hours or 4 hours at room temperature for diluted 
product.  In  addition  to  the  biochemical  compatibility  study,  an  in-use  microbial  challenge  study  was 
conducted with samples stored at 2-8°C and at room temperature and the results support the maximum 
intended hold times.  
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The batch size of inebilizumab FP 100mg/10mL is defined.  
Description of manufacturing process, process controls and GMP 
Inebilizumab finished product is manufactured and tested at EU GMP-compliant sites. Sufficient proof of 
GMP compliance has been provided. The FP is released in the EEA by Almac Pharma services, Ireland. 
The FP manufacturing process is overall standard for monoclonal antibodies. The AS is thawed, mixed 
with  dilution  buffer,  sterile  filtered,  filled  into  vials;  vials  are  fully  stoppered  and  crimped,  and  visual 
inspection is performed before secondary packaging and labelling. The FP is 100% visually inspected, 
acceptable  quality  limit  sampling  is  performed,  and  the  FP  is  bulk  packaged,  and  shipped  to  the 
packaging, labeling and storage site. Before and after visual inspection, the vials are stored at 2-8°C.  
Reprocessing (refiltration) during FP manufacturing is not presented in the dossier.  
Overall, the description of the manufacturing process is found to be satisfactory with each manufacturing 
step  being  clearly  summarised  in  a  table  with  the  important  features  (incoming  materials,  filters  and 
product  contact  disposables,  critical  and  non-critical  process  parameters,  IPCs  and  performance 
attributes). Acceptance ranges for process parameters and process controls have been presented and 
are in general supported by the process characterisation studies.  
The bioburden limit before sterile filtration is in line with guideline requirements. The hold times have 
been defined and are supported by the presented hold time validation data (see also Process validation 
and/or evaluation).  
There are no intermediates isolated in the FP manufacturing process.  
The minimal and maximal batch sizes are established for inebilizumab FP fill.  
Process validation and/or evaluation: 
The  process  validation  studies  comprise  Process  Performance  Qualification  (PPQ),  qualification  of  in-
process hold times, aseptic process validation, container closure integrity testing, filter validation, and 
shipping qualification. 
Assessment report  
EMA/266309/2022  
Page 18/137 
 
 
 
 
 
Consecutive PPQ batches were manufactured at the commercial FP manufacturing site with parameters 
and testing results meeting the defined ranges.  
The hold times have been sufficiently qualified.  
Filter validation was performed, and data has been included in accordance with guideline requirements. 
The  aseptic  filling  has  been  sufficiently  validated  with  media  fills  performed  at  simulated  routine 
production and at worst-case challenge.  
In conclusion, the activities at the FP manufacturing site can be considered sufficiently validated.  
2.4.3.3.  Product specification  
The specification for the finished product includes control of identity, purity and impurity, potency and 
other general tests. The finished product specification was established in line with ICH Q6B and Ph. Eur. 
monograph 2031 on monoclonal antibodies for human use.  
Upon request, some specification limits have been recalculated and slightly tightened. The proposed FP 
release specifications are accepted for the initial marketing authorisation.  
Analytical methods and acceptance criteria 
Many analytical methods used for release and stability testing of FP are equal to those used for the AS 
or are compendial.  
Methods for analysis used for both AS and FP, and justification for specifications for these analyses is 
given in the AS part.  
The compendial methods have been verified using inebilizumab FP, to show that the sample material 
itself does not inhibit the assays.  
Batch analysis data 
All batch release data from process 1, process 2 , and process 3  batches were within the specifications 
in place at the time of testing. These data, show a high degree of batch consistency within and across 
processes. 
Reference standard 
The same reference standard as used for the AS analyses is used at the FP level. Please refer to the AS 
part. 
Container closure system 
Inebilizumab FP is stored in a 10 mL Type 1 clear and colorless glass vial with an elastomeric stopper 
and a mist grey flip-off aluminium seal. Schematic drawings of the container closure system are provided. 
The choice of the container closure system is in line with pharmaceutical standards and the components 
comply with pharmacopoeial requirements. 
The primary container closure system has been analysed with respect to extractables according to Ph. 
Eur. and the results are acceptable. 
Overall,  the  suitability  of  the  FP  primary  container  closure  was  demonstrated  through  FP  protection 
studies  (protection  from  light,  moisture  and  microbiological  contamination),  extractables  studies, 
elemental  impurities  study,  compatibility  studies  (based  on  stability  data  including  total  protein  to 
evaluate possible adsorption) and withdrawal performance studies.  
Assessment report  
EMA/266309/2022  
Page 19/137 
 
 
 
The  FP  vials  are  individually  labelled  and  placed  in  a  paperboard  carton  (3  vials  per  carton).  The 
secondary packaging components comprise of an opaque paperboard carton to protect the FP from light 
exposure and an internal paperboard carton partition to secure the vials during transportation. 
The FP container closure system is considered suitable for storage of inebilizumab. 
Impurities 
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the FP has been performed (as 
requested) considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for 
marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) 
No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and 
the  “Assessment  report-  Procedure  under  Article  5(3)  of  Regulation  EC  (No)  726/2004-  Nitrosamine 
impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the information provided it is 
accepted that no risk was identified on the possible presence of nitrosamine impurities in the AS or the 
related FP. Therefore, no additional control measures are deemed necessary. 
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf-life for Uplizna FP is 3 years at 2–8°C. 
Stability studies were performed in line with ICH and CHMP guidelines on a suitable number of batches 
representative of the final commercial product. Relevant parameters were selected to study the stability 
of the finished product. The analytical methods were appropriately validated. 
Photostability has been tested in one FP PV batch, in accordance with ICH Q1B.  
Elemental  impurities,  originating  from  the  AS  and  FP  manufacturing  processes  or  from  the  container 
closure system were evaluated according to ICH Q3D ‘Guideline for Elemental Impurities’, with respect 
to parenteral formulations.  
In-use  stability  results,  performed  as  part  of  the  compatibility  studies  (described  in  P.2),  support  the 
maximum  intended  hold  times  of  4h  at  25ºC  and  24h  at  2-8ºC  of  FP  diluted  into  0.9%  (w/v)  saline 
solution. The results demonstrate that there was no change (only change within method variability) in 
appearance, purity, charge isoforms, and potency, or any undesired changes in protein concentration 
when  FP  was  diluted  into  0.9%  (w/v)  saline,  or  upon  subsequent  agitation  and  hold,  with  all 
administration components tested. There was no sub-visible particle formation upon dilution, or upon 
subsequent agitation and hold at the final timepoint compared to the initial timepoint. Also, any sub-
visible/visible particles observed for samples obtained through the injection port (pre-in-line filter) are 
removed after passing through the in-line filter (post-in-line filter). 
Based  on  available  stability  data,  the  shelf-life  and  storage  conditions  as  stated  in  the  SmPC  are 
acceptable. 
2.4.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
Non-Viral Adventitious Agents  
The cell banks have been sterility-tested for bacteria, fungi and mycoplasma using Ph. Eur. methods.  
No  material of  human origin is  used  in  the  manufacturing  process of  inebilizumab.  All  animal-derived 
ingredients are discussed with regards to TSE/BSE risk and the detailed risk assessments following the 
EMA/410/01  ‘Guideline  Note  for  Guidance  on  Minimising  the  Risk  of  Transmitting  Animal  Spongiform 
Encephalopathy’ support an acceptably low risk for introduction of BSE-TSE infectious agents. Supplier 
Assessment report  
EMA/266309/2022

information  with  certificates  of  analysis  and  origin  as  well  as  Certificates  of  Suitability  (TSE)  where 
relevant  have  been  provided  for  the  materials.  For  two  animal-derived  raw  materials,  Certificate  of 
Suitability were not provided, but the provided risk assessment is considered sufficient.  
Viral Adventitious Agents  
The  bioburden  and  mycoplasma  testing  are  conducted  according  to  Ph.  Eur.  Testing  for  viral 
contaminants is conducted using a 28-day in vitro assay for adventitious viruses with MRC-5, Vero, CHO-
K1, and 324K cells as detector cells. The test is compliant with ICH Q5A(R1), and the result for three 
PPQ batches verifies the absence of viral contamination, as well as mycoplasma and bioburden.  
A comprehensive programme has been employed to test, evaluate, and eliminate the potential risks of 
adventitious and endogenous viral agents in accordance with ICH Q5A, and includes: 1) Control of raw 
materials, facilities, and procedures used in manufacturing; 2) Viral testing and characterisation of the 
cell  banks  used  in  GMP  manufacturing;  3)  Viral  testing  of  unprocessed  bulk;  and  4)  Viral  clearance 
assessment of the purification process.  
The  viral  clearance  capacity  of  the  inebilizumab  AS purification  process  was  confirmed  by  conducting 
viral clearance studies for relevant steps, using qualified scale down models in accordance with ICH Q5A. 
Four  model  viruses  were  used  for  the  virus  validation;  Xenotropic  Murine  Leukemia  Virus  (XMuLV), 
reovirus type 3 (REO3), pseudorabies virus (PRV), and mouse minute virus (MVM). The selected model 
viruses are supported. Global reduction factors were satisfactory regarding the virus removal/inactivation 
for enveloped viruses as well as for nonenveloped viruses. 
In conclusion, the risk of contamination of the inebilizumab AS with adventitious agents, including TSE, 
mycoplasma, bacteria, fungi, and viruses, is considered well contained based on selection of safe raw 
materials, demonstration of absence of viral contaminants in cell banks, testing at relevant stages of the 
process,  and  finally  the  substantial  virus  clearance  capacity,  demonstrated  for  the  inebilizumab 
purification process. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Overall, the quality of inebilizumab AS and FP has been well evaluated and presented by the applicant. 
Inebilizumab  AS  is  expressed  in  CHO  cells  and  further  processed  by  a  standard  monoclonal  antibody 
manufacturing process. No excipients of animal or human origin are used. Critical in-process controls 
are  in  place.  The  manufacturing  history  of  the  AS  and  FP  is  overall  described  in  sufficient  detail  and 
comparability is supported. The AS and FP processes are considered validated.  
Inebilizumab has been sufficiently characterised and all identified impurities have either been evaluated 
to be present at non-significant levels, to be cleared from the product through downstream processing 
or are controlled on the release specification. 
The AS and FP specifications are extensive, and the analytical methods used are generally considered 
valid and capable of controlling the quality of the AS and FP at both release and during shelf-life. The 
specification limits are considered acceptable for the initial marketing authorisation.  
Inebilizumab remains stable at the proposed storage conditions and shelf-lives.  
A nitrosamine risk evaluation has been provided, confirming that AS and FP manufacturing processes 
are  not  conductive  to  nitrosamine  formation  and  the  raw  materials,  excipients,  materials  used  in 
manufacturing,  and  the  primary  packaging  material  does  not  contain  nitrosamines  or  nitrosating 
reagents.  
The applicant agreed to Recommendations.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented 
to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.4.6.  Recommendations for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommended points for investigation. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical package included 6 pivotal GLP-conducted toxicology studies (four repeated dose toxicity 
studies, one Fertility and embryofetal development study and one pre and postnatal development study) 
and several in vitro and in vivo supportive PD studies  
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Several  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  pharmacology  studies  were  conducted  to  determine  the  binding 
characteristics, effector function and efficacy of inebilizumab.  
A series of assays were employed to optimise the binding affinity of the humanised anti-CD19mAb 3649 
and  identify  the  humanised,  affinity-optimised  monoclonal  antibody  variant  16C4.  This  humanised, 
affinity-optimised monoclonal variant binds specifically to human CD19 approximately twice as strongly 
as does the humanised antibody (study No ONC551-0001). The binding properties including the affinity, 
dissociation, and internalisation of anti-CD19 affinity-matured version mAb 16C4 (the fucosylated form 
of  inebilizumab)  were  further  examined  in  Daudi  human  Burkitt  lymphoma  cells  used  as  model  B 
lymphocytes. The results indicate that mAb 16C4 possesses the desired qualities of enhanced binding, 
slower  dissociation,  and  minimal  internalisation  favorable  for  achieving  ADCC.  Furthermore, 
measurement of the equilibrium binding constants demonstrated an approximate 10-fold increase in the 
binding of afucosylated human IgG1-Fc to the human activating Fcγ receptor, FcγRIIIA and its murine 
homologue, FcγRIV over the fucosylated form (study No ONC551-0002). 
It was shown that inebilizumab mediated ADCC when tested with B lymphoma cell lines as targets but 
showed no complement-dependent cytotoxicity in the presence of B lymphoma targets and human serum 
from healthy donors (study No ONC551-0003). This ADCC was further evaluated against normal human 
peripheral  B  cells,  lymphocytic  leukemia  tumour  cells  and  acute  lymphoblastic  leukemia  tumour  cells 
demonstrating the ADCC of inebilizumab (study No ONC551-0004). In another study inebilizumab also 
displayed ADCC by significantly depleting both human peripheral blood mononuclear cell differentiated 
plasma cells as well as freshly isolated plasma cells from human bone marrow (study No RIA551-0002). 
Evaluated by flow cytometry analysis anti-CD19 mAb 16C4 (the fucosylated form of inebilizumab) had 
poor cross-reactivity with CD19 on the surface of B  cells from baboon, rhesus monkey, African green

monkey,  or  cynomolgus  monkey  but  bound  well  to  CD19  expressed  on  B  cells  of  humans  (study  No 
ONC551-0008).  Similarly,  in  three  separate  in  vitro  experiments  there  was  no  detectable  binding  of 
inebilizumab to IgM positive B cells from rabbit blood (study No RIA551-0005).  
In another tissue cross-reactivity study (study No MI-0007) inebilizumab stained B cells within human 
and huCD19 Tg mouse tissues, but not within the rat. Inebilizumab-specific staining unrelated to B cells 
occurred in multiple tissues and cell types in all 3 species tested; however, the staining pattern, intensity 
and frequency in the human tissue panel were more similar to the staining pattern noted in the rat.  
Characterisation  of  human  CD19  Tg  mice  as  a  pharmacologically  relevant  species  was  carried  out  in 
study No ONC551-009. The binding of inebilizumab to CD19 on human B cells was comparable to its 
binding to human CD19 on B cells from huCD19 Tg mice. In huCD19 Tg mice, inebilizumab bound to B 
cells  from  blood,  spleen,  bone  marrow,  and  the  peritoneal  cavity.  Inebilizumab  is  specific  for  human 
CD19 and does not react with murine surface markers on B or non-B cells.  
The in vivo pharmacological activity of inebilizumab was evaluated in huCD19 Tg mice as the relevant 
species  since  this  mAb  was  specific  for  human  CD19  and  had  poor  cross-reactivity  with  CD19  on  the 
surface  of  B  cells  from  rat,  rabbit,  baboon,  rhesus  monkey,  African  green  monkey,  or  cynomolgus 
monkey. In study No ONC551-0010 the specific depletion and recovery of B cells in normal blood and 
tissues  was  shown  in  huCD19  Tg  mice  at  single  intravenous  (IV)  doses  of  inebilizumab  (10  to  250 
µg/mouse).  At  250  µg  treatment  the  duration  of  B-cell  depletion  was  dose-dependent  (sustained  for 
more than 10 weeks post treatment) and recovery of B cells to levels and maturities similar to control 
animals was seen 14 to 16 weeks after treatment. It was suggested B cell-activating factor likely plays 
a role in promoting B cell recovery. Inebilizumab also caused inhibition of antibody responses.  
Two in vivo studies were undertaken to characterise the pharmacological activity of inebilizumab in a B 
cell–dependent model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) (Chen et al, 2014 and Chen 
et al, 2016). In this model a single dose of 250 µg inebilizumab effectively depleted CD19+ B cells and 
plasma cells in EAE mice, resulting in a global reduction of autoantibodies in blood and in the CNS (Chen 
et  al,  2014).  Thus,  inebilizumab  was  effective  in  targeting  pathogenic  B  cells  in  a  preclinical 
neuroinflammatory setting. 
The  efficacy  of  inebilizumab  was  investigated  in  a  second  autoimmune  mouse  model  Sle1-hCD19  Tg 
exhibiting  classical  autoimmune  manifestations  including  high  levels  of  autoantibodies,  skewed  B  cell 
subsets, and profoundly activated B and T cells (study No RIA551-0003). Inebilizumab was shown to 
deplete  blood  and  tissue  B  cells  in  the  Sle1-huCD19  Tg  mice  in  a  dose-dependent  manner.  B  cells in 
blood,  spleen  and  bone  marrow  were  reduced  by  >90%  and  total  serum  immunoglobulin,  and 
autoantibodies.  Some  inflammatory  markers  in  circulation  were  also  decreased  and  others  were 
increased.  
A huCD19 TG murine model of scleroderma also demonstrated the efficacy of inebilizumab in depleting 
pathogenic  B  cells.  Animals  displayed  sustained  depletion  of  B-cell  populations,  including  depletion  of 
antibody secreting cells, and had reduced serum immunoglobulins and autoantibodies (study No RIA551-
0001). 
Preliminary PK and PD data of inebilizumab in human CD19 transgenic mice was determined in study No 
ONC551-0011. Following a single IV bolus injection of inebilizumab at doses of 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, or 12.5 
mg/kg to female human CD19 transgenic mice the maximum concentration (Cmax) increased in a dose-
dependent manner within the dose-range of 0.5 to 12.5 mg/kg, the area under the concentration-time 
curve from dosing extrapolated to infinity (AUCinf) increased in a more than dose-proportional manner 
at this dose range and the terminal half-life (t1/2) increased with increasing doses. In the same setting

inebilizumab treatment led to marked B-cell depletion in blood, bone marrow and spleen with different 
effects  on  B-cell  recovery.  Between  one  and  three  weeks,  blood,  bone  marrow,  and  spleen  B  cells 
remained depleted in mice treated at doses of with 1, 2.5, or 12.5 mg/kg. 
In general, the in vitro and in vivo studies were comprehensive and relevant. Proof of concept and mode 
of action were established and are supported.  
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No  secondary  PD  studies  of  inebilizumab  were  conducted.  Due  to  the  specific  receptor  targeting,  low 
biodistribution  to  non-target  tissues  and  low  cross-reactivity  the  absence  of  dedicated  secondary  PD 
studies was accepted.  
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
Dedicated safety pharmacology studies were not performed. The potential for exaggerated pharmacology 
on  the  neurological,  cardiovascular,  and  respiratory  systems  was  assessed  through  cage  side 
observations and detailed physical examinations conducted during the repeat-dose toxicology studies. 
No  effects  on  these  systems  were  observed.  Inebilizumab  is  a  biotechnology-derived  product  that 
achieves  highly  specific  receptor  targeting  therefore  in  accordance  with  the  ICH  guideline  S7A  the 
omission of dedicated safety pharmacology studies is supported. 
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Non-clinical PD drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies were not conducted. As inebilizumab is highly specific 
for human CD19 the absence of studies investigating PD DDI was endorsed. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Inebilizumab  specifically  recognises  human  CD19  and  has  poor  cross-reactivity  to  rodent,  rabbit  or 
nonhuman primate CD19. Therefore, human CD19 transgenic mice were selected as the relevant animal 
species to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of inebilizumab. With the exception of the initial non-GLP (good 
laboratory  practice)  PK/PD  study  (study  No  ONC551-0011),  the  PK  and  toxicokinetics  (TK)  of 
inebilizumab in huCD19 Tg mice were assessed as part of the toxicity studies. 
2.5.3.1.  Methods of analysis 
A sandwich ELISA method was developed and qualified for the quantification of inebilizumab in mouse 
serum  from  the  PK/PD  Study  ONC551-0011.  An  electrochemiluminescent,  solution-phase,  bridging 
immunoassay  that  uses  MSD  technology  (Method  SOP  CT050091)  was  developed  and  validated  by 
MedImmune for the detection and titration of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) to inebilizumab in mouse serum 
(MedImmune Validation Report CTVR0045).  
The electrochemiluminescent sandwich immunoassay for measurement of inebilizumab in mouse serum 
was adequately validated with regards to accuracy, precision, range of quantification (20 ng/mL to 2000 
ng/mL),  dilutional  linearity,  hook  effect  (concentrations  up  to  64000  ng/mL),  specificity,  antibody 
interference, robustness, stability (three freeze-thaw cycles, for up to 16 hours at room temperature, 15 
days at 5 ± 3°C and up to 45 days at -80 ±10°C). The selectivity of the assay was affected since anti-
inebilizumab antibodies at concentrations of 50 ng/mL (at the LQC level) and 1500 ng/mL (at the LQC 
and HQC levels) interfered with the assay’s ability to measure inebilizumab (study CTVR-0044). 
Assessment report  
EMA/266309/2022

An  electrochemiluminescent,  solution-phase,  bridging  immunoassay  for  detection  of  anti-inebilizumab 
antibodies in mouse serum met the acceptance criteria for accuracy and precision of classification and 
titre, intermediate precision, repeatability, robustness, selectivity, specificity and matrix stability. Anti-
inebilizumab antibody levels of 0.5 μg/mL were detectable in the presence of 25 μg/mL of inebilizumab. 
This is supported (study CTVR-0045).  
2.5.3.2.  Absorption 
In study ONC551-0011, following a single IV administration of inebilizumab to female huCD19 Tg mice 
at 0.5, 1, 2.5 and 12.5 mg/kg doses (n = 24/group), the Cmax increased dose-proportionally within the 
0.5  to  12.5  mg/kg  dose  range.  The  systemic  exposure  (AUCinf)  increased  in  a  more  than  dose-
proportional  manner  at  this  dose  range.  This  was  consistent  with  the  presence  of  an  antigen  sink.  A 
decrease in clearance and an increase in terminal t1/2 of inebilizumab were observed with an increasing 
dose of inebilizumab. 
In study No 08-2083, following the first IV administration of inebilizumab, a more than dose-proportional 
increase in exposure was observed in the area under the concentration-time curve from hour 0 to day 7 
(AUC0-7d) within the 0.675 to 36.6 mg/kg dose range. Following the last administration of inebilizumab, 
parallel terminal phases with similar clearance values and t1/2 were observed after the mid- (3.71 mg/kg) 
and high- (36.6 mg/kg) doses. The clearance rates in the mid- and high-dose groups were typical of 
clearance of a human IgG1 antibody in mice in the absence of an antigen sink, which is consistent with 
the  having  depleted  CD19+  B  lymphocytes  in  the  mid  and  high  dose  groups.  No  appreciable  gender 
difference in TK was observed during the treatment period in the mid and high dose groups. Only animals 
from the 0.675 mg/kg dose group (6/13, 4 females and 2 males) showed anti-inebilizumab antibodies 
development. Titres ranged from 1:10 to 1:20480 by the end of the study. The immunogenicity results 
were  consistent  with  the  depletion  and  recovery  kinetics  of  B  lymphocytes  observed  in  inebilizumab-
treated groups as the development of anti-inebilizumab antibodies is dependent upon antibody producing 
B cells. One animal from the control group had consistently detectable anti-inebilizumab antibodies. 
In study No 08-2084, following the first IV administration of inebilizumab in huCD19 Tg mice, systemic 
exposure increased in a more than dose-proportional manner, consistent with the presence of antigen 
sink. The nonlinearity was less pronounced at steady state (Day 71), consistent with B cell depletion and 
consequent  reduction  of  the  antigen  sink.  From  the  immunogenicity  screening  assay,  no  pre-existing 
anti-inebilizumab  antibodies  were  detected.  During  the  dosing  phase,  2  out  of  17  animals  from  the 
control group and 2 out of 9 animals from the 0.5 mg/kg dose group (2 females) were positive for anti-
inebilizumab antibodies. Titres ranged from 1:10 to 1:1280.  
In study No 09-2153, following both the first and the 26th IV injection of inebilizumab, exposure (Cmax 
and AUC0-7d) was dose-proportional in the 2 dose groups (3 and 30 mg/kg) for both male and female 
huCD19 Tg mice. t1/2 were shorter and clearance was faster in female than in males. Steady-state was 
reached by the 13th dose. With regards to immunogenicity 2/14 animals (2 females) tested in Group 1 
and 2/14 animals tested in Group 2 developed inebilizumab antibodies. 
In  study  No  10-2237,  following  the  first  subcutaneous  (SC)  administration  of  inebilizumab,  exposure 
(Cmax and AUC0-7d) was approximately dose-proportional for the 3 and 30 mg/kg dose groups. Following 
the 13th SC administration of inebilizumab, apparent clearance (CL/F) and t1/2 were similar between the 
2 dose groups, with mean t1/2 values of 18.2 and 20.6 days, and mean CL/F of 3.49 and 4.63 mL/kg/d 
for the 3 and 30 mg/kg doses, respectively. Following the IV administration of inebilizumab at 30 mg/kg, 
t1/2 was similar to that of the SC doses and estimated to be 20.9 day. Clearance was estimated as 4.83 
mL/kg/d. The bioavailability of 104% was estimated for SC at 30 mg/kg. No anti-inebilizumab antibodies 
were detected in animals in the 30 mg/kg/wk SC or IV groups. Positive results for antibodies in 4 control

mice and 1/14 mice in the 3 mg/kg/week (SC) group in the predose phase were considered to be false 
positives. 
In general, TK data for inebilizumab showed that exposure increased in a dose-proportional manner and 
was independent of sex. Immunogenicity samples were not collected from the TK groups, the impact of 
ADA on TK profiles and TK parameters was not analysed.  
2.5.3.3.  Distribution 
Tissue  distribution  of  inebilizumab  was  carried  out  in  the  Fischer-344  rat  because  antigen-specific  or 
cross-reactive binding studies previously showed that the staining pattern of human tissue panel was 
more similar to the staining pattern in the rat (study No MI-0007).  
Following  a  single  IV  injection  in  male  and  female  Fischer-344  rats  the  tissue  distribution  pattern  of 
inebilizumab  compared  with  a  control  afucosylated  antibody  R347afuc  was  evaluated  by 
immunohistochemistry analysis (study No ONC551-0012). The presence of R347afuc or inebilizumab in 
Group  Nos  1  and  2  was  detected  within  the  vasculature,  most  prominently  at  Day  3  and  somewhat 
diminished  at  Day  7.  There  was  no  detectable  membrane-bound  or  intracellular  signal  in  any  of  the 
tissues examined, except for the testes. Testes analysed from Group No 2 males (treated with 25 mg/kg 
inebilizumab) at necropsy Day 3 and Day 7 had detectable signal of rare cells within the seminiferous 
tubules. 
Therefore, the potential testicular toxicity of inebilizumab was investigated in study No 08-2087. Fischer 
344 rats were injected IV once weekly with 0, 2.5, or 25 mg/kg inebilizumab for 1 month (5 injections). 
Histopathology evaluation at 1 month revealed no macro- or microscopic findings in the testes of treated 
rats and no evidence of testicular toxicity. 
In study No AAO00141, male huCD19 Tg mice received a total of 9 weekly IV injections of inebilizumab 
while female huCD19 Tg mice received a total of 5 weekly IV injections of inebilizumab at the doses of 
3 or 30 mg/kg. Following the first and last IV bolus administration of inebilizumab, systemic exposure 
increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner in the tested range of 3 to 30 mg/kg. Fetal-to-
maternal  inebilizumab  concentration  percent  ratios  were  114%  and  31.1%  for  dose  groups  3  and  30 
mg/kg,  respectively.  Adequate  exposure  of  fetus  to  inebilizumab  was  demonstrated  by  detecting 
inebilizumab  in  the  serum  of  fetuses  at  levels  comparable  or  exceeding  the  levels  measured  in  the 
corresponding maternal animals. 
In study No 62509, following 3 and 30 mg/kg intravenous (bolus) injection of inebilizumab on Gestation 
Days  6,  9,  12,  15,  and  18  and  on  Lactation  Days  1,  4,  7,  10,  14,  17,  and  20  maternal  serum 
concentrations  of  inebilizumab  were  approximately  dose  proportional  on  lactation  day  21.  Mean 
concentrations of inebilizumab in pup serum on postnatal day 21 were only slightly lower compared to 
maternal  serum  concentrations  at  the  same  interval;  mean  concentrations  were  similar  in  male  and 
female pups. No inebilizumab was detected in serum samples collected from the control group dams or 
pups at the time of weaning. Comparable maternal and pup serum levels of inebilizumab on Lactation 
Day/Postnatal Day 21 indicated inebilizumab is excreted into the milk. 
2.5.3.4.  Metabolism 
No  studies  of  metabolism  of  inebilizumab  were  conducted.  Inebilizumab  is  a  humanised  IgG1κ 
monoclonal mAb, which is expected to be degraded to small peptides and amino acids. According to the 
guideline  ICH  S6(R1)  on  Preclinical  Safety  Evaluation  of  Biotechnology-Derived  Pharmaceuticals  the 
expected  metabolism  is  the  degradation  to  small  peptides  and  individual  amino  acids  and  thus  the 
absence of metabolism studies can be accepted.  
Assessment report  
EMA/266309/2022  
Page 26/137 
 
 
 
2.5.3.5.  Excretion 
No studies of excretion of inebilizumab were conducted. Due to the large molecular size, inebilizumab is 
not expected to be excreted in urine. As inebilizumab is expected to be degraded to small peptides and 
individual amino acids the omission of excretion studies was endorsed. 
2.5.3.6.  Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Nonclinical PK DDI studies were not performed for inebilizumab. Inebilizumab is a humanized mAb where 
the  primary  elimination  pathway  is  clearance  by  the  reticuloendothelial  system.  Cytochrome  P450 
enzymes, efflux pumps, and protein-binding mechanisms are not involved in clearance of inebilizumab. 
Therefore, the potential risk of interaction between inebilizumab and other drugs is low. This is endorsed. 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
The  use  of  the  transgenic  huCD19  mouse  model  for  the  toxicology  programme  of  inebilizumab,  is 
supported in accordance with ICH S6(R1). No other animal species was considered relevant, as binding 
to human CD19 does not occur in standard toxicology models in rodents and monkeys. In contrast, the 
huCD19  Tg  mouse  model  showed  similar  binding  and  effector  function,  as  found  in  human  cells  by 
demonstrated  the  pharmacologic  effect  of  CD19+  B-cell  depletion  and  recovery  in  blood  and  tissues. 
With no viable alternative, it is therefore endorsed that the nonclinical in vivo programme is performed 
primarily in this model. 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
Two non-GLP single dose toxicity studies were conducted in huCD19 Tg mice with IV doses of 2.5, 10, 
or 40 mg/kg for a 7-day observation period (ONC551-0013) and 0.5, 10, or 50 mg/kg for a maximum 
observation period of 28-days (ONC551-0014). The second study was conducted with animals of both 
genders,  while  this  aspect  is  not  clear  in  relation  to  the  first  study.  The  lack  of  GLP  compliance  is 
acceptable. 
Results  from  these  studies  showed  that  B-cell  depletion  occurred  at  all  doses  with  a  dose-dependent 
decrease and recovery pattern. No changes were seen in other cell populations (e.g. T-cells, NK-cells). 
Additionally,  histopathological  examination  showed  inebilizumab-related  findings  in  spleen  and  lymph 
nodes, as a reduction of follicles/germinal centres most evident at high doses. In general, findings were 
consistent with the expected pharmacology of inebilizumab and no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) 
values of ≥ 40 mg/kg and ≥ 50 mg/kg were determined for single dose administration in the two studies. 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
Four GLP compliant repeat-dose toxicity studies were conducted with inebilizumab in huCD19 transgenic 
mice. Inebilizumab was well tolerated at once weekly IV administration at doses up to 36.6 mg/kg for 1 
month (total of 5 administrations; Study a08-2083) and at doses up to 30 mg/kg for 3 months (total of 
13  administrations;  Study  08-2084)  or  6  months  (total  of  26  administrations;  Study  09-2153). 
Furthermore,  a  3-month  study  was  conducted  comparing  SC  and  IV  administration  of  inebilizumab, 
showing  that  the  pharmacological  effects  of  B-cells  depletion  were  independent  of  the  route  of 
administration  at  doses  up  to  30  mg/kg  once  weekly  (total  of  13  administrations;  Study  10-2237). 
However,  as  IV  is  the  intended  clinical  administration  route,  SC  administration  will  only  briefly  be 
discussed. All four studies had a long recovery period (35 to 45 weeks), corresponding to the B220+ B 
lymphocytes returning to a level of > 25% of control.    
Assessment report  
EMA/266309/2022

Primary  findings  were  to  a  large  degree  consistent  between  studies  and  with  the  expected 
pharmacological effect of inebilizumab on B lymphocytes. These findings included decreases in B220+ 
lymphocytes  in  blood,  spleen  and  bone  marrow,  decreased  spleen  weight,  microscopic  findings  of 
decreased size of the white pulp compartment of the spleen due to lymphocyte depletion, and decreased 
size and cellularity of the B lymphocyte areas of the mediastinal and mesenteric lymph nodes. A small 
number of changes unrelated to the pharmacological effect was detected in the studies, most of which 
were reversable after the recovery period and therefore not considered adverse.  
Non-pharmacological related findings of a more severe character were observed in the 3-month SC and 
IV study (study 10-2237), as an increased incidence of skin changes and bronchiolo-alveolar adenomas. 
Unscheduled euthanisations occurred due to severe skin ulcerations/infections in both SC and IV dose 
groups, without any apparent dose response but with a majority of cases occurring in the SC group. The 
applicant argued that it could be an exacerbation of skin sores commonly seen in mice in combination 
with  the  immunosuppressive  effect  of  the  test  article.  This  explanation  is  considered  plausible,  thus 
indicating that a general risk of infection exists with the use of inebilizumab. However, it is puzzling that 
the skin lesions were detected only in this particular study (study 10-2237) and not in the three other 
repeat-dose  studies  (study  08-2083,  08-2084  and  09-2153).  Additionally,  an  increased  incidence  of 
bronchiolo-alveolar adenomas (50%) were detected in males at end recovery in the IV 30 mg/kg/week 
group in study 10-2237. Results from a background study in untreated huCD19 Tg mice revealed that 
bronchiolo-alveolar adenomas occur in males at an incidence of 3.4% to 8.9%, depending on the age of 
the mouse (Iverson et al, 2017). However, there is still a long way from 8.9% to the observed incidence 
of  50%.  According  to  the  applicant,  various  factors  were  explored,  including  the  phenotype  of  the 
transgenic animals and material used on the study, without identifying the cause of the skin lesions or 
bronchiolo-alveolar  adenomas.  When  specifically  considering  the  most  recent  3-month  study  with  SC 
and IV administration, in relation to the alveolar adenoma findings in Study 10-2237, the applicant adds 
that the weight of evidence suggests that this was an incidental background finding and is not considered 
to  represent  a  risk  to  patients.  It  was  not  observed  in  other  studies  and  is  an  expected  background 
finding for this mouse strain and gender.  
In  relation  to  the  skin  ulcerations,  the  applicant  adds  that  these  were  also  observed  in  the  6-month 
study, but were not considered test article-related as they were observed in both the control and test 
article  treated  animals  with  no  dose-dependence.  Furthermore,  in  terms  of  data  from  clinical  trials, 
although observations of skin ulcerations were seen in subjects treated with inebilizumab, these were 
infrequent, possible complications of the underlying disease, or assessed by investigator as not related 
to inebilizumab.  
A  general  IV  NOAEL=30  mg/kg/week  is  considered  acceptable  based  on  the  conducted  repeat-dose 
studies  and  the  argumentation  presented  above.  However,  a  SC  NOAEL  of  30  mg/kg/week  is  not 
endorsed based on the pronounced skin lesion detected. However, since the route of administration is 
IV  and  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  finding  therefore  is  considered  low,  the  issue  will  not  be  further 
pursued.   
TK parameters were evaluated in a single-dose study and in all four repeat-dose studies. In the single-
dose  study  and  in  the  1-  and  3-months  repeat-dose  studies,  systemic  exposure  (measured  by  AUC) 
appeared to increase in a more than dose-proportional manner. This was consistent with the presence 
of an initial antigen sink. However, the non-linearity was less pronounced at the end of the 3-months 
study (Day 71), which is consistent with B-cell depletion and consequent reduction of the antigen sink. 
In  the  6-months  repeat-dose  study  (09-2153),  inebilizumab  exposure  (Cmax  and  AUC0-7d)  was  dose-
proportional in the 2 dose groups (3 and 30 mg/kg). After SC administration in the 3-months repeat-
dose study (10-2237), inebilizumab exposure was approximately dose proportional following the first SC 
injection but less than dose proportional following the 13th SC injection in both dose groups (3 and 30 
mg/kg). A tendency toward a lower drug exposure (lower Cmax and AUC) were seen in females compared

to males in the 6-month study and at low doses in the 1-month study. However, none of the repeat dose 
toxicity studies included TK data for the control groups, despite the presence of ADA in control animals. 
The applicant justified the lack of TK data from control group animals used in the repeated dose toxicity 
studies  based  on  the  3Rs principles.  The  repeated  dose  toxicity  studies  were conducted  in  transgenic 
mice, from which limited volumes of blood can be collected. Inclusion of separate TK groups would be 
required.  As  for  the  presence  of  anti-inebilizumab  antibodies  in  animals  from  control  groups,  the 
applicant suggests that this represents false positives. Owing to the small amount of blood able to be 
collected  from  individual  mice,  the  ADA  samples  were  only  evaluated  in  the  screening  tier  and  not 
subjected to a confirmatory test. 
Interspecies comparison data was presented by the applicant, as a comparison of doses and exposures 
over a 6-month treatment period in huCD19 Tg mice and human patients. Data obtained at the NOAEL 
of 30 mg/kg/week iv from the 6-month repeat-dose GLP chronic toxicology study (Study 09-2153) in 
huCD19  Tg  mice  were  used  for  the  comparison  and  the  dose  was  successfully  corrected  to  human 
equivalent dose (HED) using the generic allometric scaling factor proposed by the FDA*. When comparing 
the total dose received during 6-months of treatment in mice and humans, an HED-based safety factor 
of  6.9-fold  was  determined.  Furthermore,  an  exposure-based  safety  margin  of  55-fold  existed  when 
using accumulated AUC26week data from female huCD19 Tg mice with the lowest systemic exposure. The 
calculated safety margins are supported, as well as the NOAEL determination.

2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
No genotoxicity studies were conducted, which is acceptable in accordance with ICH S6.  
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
In accordance with the weight of evidence approach outlined in ICH S6 (R1), the applicant has presented 
argumentation for waiving of carcinogenicity studies. It is agreed, that data from a 2-year carcinogenicity 
study in human transgenic CD19 mice do not seem to provide much additional clinically relevance, due 
to  the  limited  interpretability  of  study  results,  as  a  lack  of  historical  reference  data.  Additionally,  the 
applicant  argues  that  findings  from  the  6-months  repeat-dose  study  in  huCD19  Tg  mice,  showed  no 
adverse organ weight changes, detected masses, or histological findings suggestive of proliferative or 
pre-neoplastic lesions, which is endorsed. It should furthermore be mentioned that the mice in the 6-
months study received a higher number of treatments with shorter duration between, than expected in 
the  clinical  setting.  In  line  with  the  SA  EMEA/H/SA/2664/1/2013/III,  experience  from  other  B-cell 
depleting agents (i.e. rituximab, belimumab, alemtuzumab) was taken into consideration, showing no 
increased risk of malignancies and for rituximab this was supported by data from a 11-year period of 
using rituximab in the clinical programme. The applicant did not include the mAb ocrelizumab in their 
weight of evidence discussion. Ocrelizumab is also a B-cell depleting agent (targeting CD20 positive B-
cells),  for  which,  in  contrast  to  the  previously  mentioned,  there  is  as  clinical  signal  regarding  breast 
cancer. The presented rationale for omitting carcinogenicity studies is however considered acceptable, 
due to the reasons listed above.     
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
A GLP compliant combined male and female fertility and embryofetal development study was conducted 
with IV doses of 0, 3 and 30 mg/kg/week for 9 and 5 weekly dose administrations in male and females, 
respectively. The conduct of a combined study is accepted, and the study is considered sufficient to cover 
Assessment report  
EMA/266309/2022  
Page 29/137 
 
 
 
all aspects of fertility and embryofetal development. A dose-dependent treatment-related reduction in 
fertility index (96%, 76% and 64% in control, 3 and 30 mg/kg/week group respectively) were noted. 
However,  the  reason  for  the  reduced  fertility  index  was  unclear,  since  no  impact  on  estous/diestrous 
were detected in females and no effect on male reproductive organs (i.e. right and left epididymis, left 
cauda epididymis, left testis, seminal vesicles with and without fluid, right testis and prostate), sperm 
motility  or  number  of  male  mice  that  mated  was  seen.  The  section  5.3  of  the  Summary  of  product 
characteristics (SmPC) states that a treatment-related reduction in fertility index has been observed in 
a non-clinical study.  
Systemic exposure of inebilizumab was confirmed in the fetuses in the combined fertility and embryofetal 
development  study  (see  PK  section).  No  impact  was  detected  on  embryofetal  development  (i.e. 
malformations, variations), however, a marked difference was seen in huCD19+ B-cells in fetal livers 
from progeny of dosed mice compared to undosed (population average of 60.7% in undosed compared 
to 0.32% and 0.15% in dosed progeny). This shows that inebilizumab crosses the placenta and causes 
huCD19+ B-cell depletion in fetuses.  
A pre- and postnatal development study were conducted in huCd19 Tg mice with IV administration of 
inebilizumab at doses of 3 and 30 mg/kg. The study was initiated on GD6 and therefore provided an 
overlap with the combined fertility and embryofetal development study, covering the whole reproductive 
and developmental period as requested by guideline. Findings suggestive of an impairment in normal B-
cell function in the F1 generation at all doses correlated with above mentioned findings of inebilizumab 
placenta crossing and B-cell depletion from the combined fertility and embryofetal development study. 
A fetal and newborn B-cell depletion in case of in utero exposure in humans is therefore expected. This 
is reflected in section 4.6 and 5.3 of SmPC. 
As  no  adverse  effects  on  the  F0  dams,  F1  growth,  survival,  and  reproductive  development  and 
performance, and F2 fetuses were detected at any dosage level, the NOAEL for F0 maternal, F1 systemic 
and  reproductive,  and  F2  embryo/fetal  developmental  toxicity  was  considered  to  be  30 mg/kg/dose. 
However, malignant lymphoma was identified in 2 F1 females at 3 mg/kg and 1 F1 female at 30 mg/kg 
on PND 357. The finding accentuates the weakness of the model due to lack of sufficient historical data, 
but it is agreed with the applicant that given the advanced age of the females and lack of a dose response 
pattern, the relationship to the test article is uncertain. Furthermore, no particular malignant lymphoma 
concern  was  highlighted  for  other  B-cell  depleting  agents  on  the  market,  as  addressed  under 
carcinogenicity subsection. A statistically significantly increase in startle response was noted in F1 males 
of the 30 mg/kg dose group but not in the females. Even though, the finding does not correlate with 
other neurobehaviour parameters, it is still considered to be test article related. The NOAEL of 30 mg/kg 
for developmental neurotoxicity is therefore not endorsed. However, as the clinical relevance is unclear 
and a sufficient caution for use in pregnant women is included in the SmPC section 4.6, the issue is not 
further pursued.  
From the non-clinical point of view, information in the two sections of the SmPC is generally considered 
adequate.  
No juvenile animal studies have been conducted. This is acceptable, as the medicinal product is indicated 
for adult patients only. 
2.5.4.6.  Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance after IV and SC injection was assessed as a part of the conducted repeat-dose studies. 
No gross or histopathological changes attributed to IV injection were seen, whereas, slight reversable 
acute  to  subacute  inflammation  were  presented  at  the  SC  injection  site.  As  the  clinical  route  of 
Assessment report  
EMA/266309/2022  
Page 30/137 
 
 
 
administration is IV, the evaluation of local tolerance is considered sufficient and no further studies are 
necessary.  
2.5.4.7.  Other toxicity studies 
A study was conducted in order to assess potential cross-reactivity of inebilizumab with cryosection of 
human, rat (Fischer-344) and huCD19 Tg mouse tissues (MI-0007). In tissues from human and huCD19 
Tg mice, membranous staining pattern were localised to B-cells primarily in lymphatic tissue but also to 
scattered B-cells in various other tissues. None-B-cell related staining were seen in various tissue from 
all three species, however, the staining was cytoplasmic in nature, and it is anticipated by the applicant 
that any potential intracellular cross-reactive epitope would not be accessible to a large molecule such 
as inebilizumab under in vivo conditions. The applicant states GLP compliance of the study, however, 
this is questioned due to e.g. lack study directors’ signature at a compliance statement in the report. 
However, no demand for GLP compliance exists for these types of studies according guideline.   
In order to exclude off-target tissue binding of inebilizumab, a single dose IV biodistribution study was 
conducted in Fischer-344 rats (ONC551-0012). The rat was selected as the relevant species for off-target 
binding, as a comparable staining pattern were seen between rat and human tissue in the MI-0007 study 
above. Staining of rare cells within the seminiferous tubules of the testes indicated a potential for off-
target tissue binding of inebilizumab, leading to the conduct of a testicular toxicity study in rats (08-
2087). A GLP compliant testicular toxicity study was then conducted in rats with five repeat-doses of 
inebilizumab administered IV at dose of 0, 2.5 and 25 mg/kg (08-2087). No test-related effect on weight, 
macroscopic  or  histopathological  findings  were  seen  in  the  testes  or  epididymites  of  the  treated  rats, 
indicating no in vivo testicular toxicity at the tested doses. The results are considered reliable, as the 
dosing  period  covered  a  minimum  of  3  seminiferous  epithelial  cycles  and  the  high  dose  of  25  mg/kg 
caused distribution to the testes in the biodistribution study.  
The  translational  value  of ADA  formation  in  animal models  are  limited.  Nevertheless,  immunogenicity 
and formation of ADA was assessed based on data from the 1, 3, 6-months repeat-dose studies and the 
3-months SC and IV repeat-dose study but the results were only sparsely addressed in the overview and 
toxicology written summary. It appeared like ADA were primarily formed in the lowest dose groups (at 
0.675 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg in the 1- and 3-months study respectively). As stated by the applicant, the 
ADA  formation  correlated  with  depletion  and  recovery  kinetics  of  B  lymphocytes  in  the  inebilizumab 
treated groups, as the development of ADA is dependent upon antibody-producing B cells.  
No data was presented for immunotoxicity, dependence, metabolites or impurities.  
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  applicant  has  provided  an  acceptable  justification  for  not  conducting  a  full  environmental  risk 
assessment. Since inebilizumab is an afucosylated, monoclonal antibody with effect on human CD19 B-
cells, it is expected to be fully metabolised into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways 
in  the  body  with  negligible  excretion  of  intact,  biologically  active  protein.  In  accordance  to  guideline 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 21*), inebilizumab is therefore considered to be of no particular hazard 
to the environment and no special precautions in terms of use and disposal are needed.

2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
The binding properties, effector function and efficacy of inebilizumab were sufficiently characterised in 
pharmacodynamic in vitro and in vivo studies. 
A  series  of  assays  identified  and  showed  that  the  humanised,  affinity-optimised  monoclonal  antibody 
variant 16C4 (the fucosylated form of inebilizumab) bound specifically to human CD19 approximately 
twice  as  strongly  as  the  humanised  antibody  (study  No  ONC551-0001).  The  fucosylated  form  of 
inebilizumab  mAb  16C4  had  enhanced  binding,  slower  dissociation,  and  minimal  internalisation 
favourable for achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Furthermore, a 10-fold increase in the 
binding of afucosylated human IgG1-Fc to the human activating Fcγ receptor, FcγRIIIA and its murine 
homologue, FcγRIV over the fucosylated form was demonstrated (study No ONC551-0002). 
Inebilizumab  mediated  ADCC  cytotoxicity  against  B  lymphoma  cell  lines  (study  No  ONC551-0003), 
normal  human  peripheral  B  cells,  lymphocytic  leukemia  tumour  cells,  acute  lymphoblastic  leukemia 
tumour cells (study No ONC551-0004) and both human peripheral blood mononuclear cell differentiated 
plasma cells as well as freshly isolated plasma cells from human bone marrow (study No RIA551-0002). 
It  was  also  demonstrated  that  the  ADCC  of  inebilizumab  was  without  activation  of  complement-
dependent cytotoxicity (study No ONC551-0003).  
The  human  CD19  transgenic  (huCD19  Tg)  mice  was  established  as  the  pharmacologically  relevant 
toxicology  species.  Three  different  in  vitro  tissue  cross-reactivity  studies  showed  inebilizumab  was 
specific for human CD19, does not cross-react with rodent CD19 (study No ONC551-009) and has no or 
poor cross-reactivity with CD19 on the surface of B cells from rat (study No MI-0007), rabbit (study No 
RIA551-0005),  baboon,  rhesus  monkey,  African  green  monkey,  or  cynomolgus  monkey  (study  No 
ONC551-0008). In study No RIA551-0005 no detectable binding of inebilizumab to IgM positive B cells 
from rabbit blood in three separate experiments was seen. 
The in vivo pharmacological activity of inebilizumab was evaluated in huCD19 Tg mice as the relevant 
species. In study No ONC551-0010 the specific depletion and recovery of B cells in normal blood and 
tissues was shown in huCD19 Tg mice at single IV doses of inebilizumab (10 to 250 µg/mouse).  
The pharmacological activity of inebilizumab was characterised in several in vivo models. Treatment with 
inebilizumab effectively depleted CD19+ B cells and plasma cells in EAE huCD19 Tg mice. This led to a 
global reduction of autoantibodies in blood and in the CNS and to significantly reduced disease scores 
(Chen et al, 2014 and Chen et al, 2016). Inebilizumab also effectively depleted blood and tissue B cells 
and splenic plasma cells in a second autoimmune mouse model (study No RIA551-0003). Sle1-human 
CD19  Tg  mice  displayed  reduced  total  serum  immunoglobulin,  autoantibodies,  and  inflammatory 
mediators  in  this  model.  Some  inflammatory  markers  in  circulation  were  decreased  and  others  were 
increased.  
In a preliminary PK and PD study of inebilizumab following a single IV bolus injection at doses of 0.5, 
1.0, 2.5, or 12.5 mg/kg in female human CD19 transgenic mice the Cmax increased in a dose-dependent 
manner  within  the  dose-range  of  0.5  to  12.5  mg/kg,  the  AUCinf  increased  in  a  more  than  dose-
proportional  manner  at  this  dose  range  and  the  terminal  t1/2  increased  with  increasing  doses. 
Inebilizumab treatment led to marked B-cell depletion in blood, bone marrow and spleen with different 
effects on B-cell recovery. 
The characterisation of the immunological properties of inebilizumab including specific receptor targeting, 
low biodistribution to non-target tissues and low cross-reactivity justified the omission of secondary PD 
studies in conformity with ICH guideline S6(R1).  
Assessment report  
EMA/266309/2022  
Page 32/137 
 
 
 
In accordance with the ICH guideline S7A no dedicated safety pharmacology studies were carried out 
since inebilizumab is a biotechnology-derived product that achieves highly specific receptor targeting. 
Safety pharmacology endpoints were included in the general toxicity studies.  
The lack of non-clinical PD DDI studies was accepted as inebilizumab was highly specific for human CD19. 
Pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics 
A sandwich enzyme-linked immunoassay method was developed and qualified for the quantification of 
inebilizumab  in  mouse  serum  from  the  PK/PD  Study  ONC551-0011.  An  electrochemiluminescent, 
solution-phase,  bridging  immunoassay  that  uses  MSD  technology  (Method  SOP  CT050091)  was 
developed and validated by MedImmune for the detection and titration of ADA to inebilizumab in mouse 
serum (MedImmune Validation Report CTVR0045).  
Two assays for the measurement of inebilizumab study No CTVR-0044 (used in the pivotal toxicology 
study  Nos  08-2083,  08-2084,  09-2153,  10-2237,  AAO00141  and  62509)  and  detection  of  anti-
inebilizumab  antibodies  study  No  CTVR-0045  (used  in  the  pivotal  toxicology  study  Nos  08-2083,  08-
2084, 09-2153 and 10-2237) in mouse serum were developed and validated according to GLP.  
The TK of inebilizumab in huCD19 Tg mice were assessed as an integral part in the pivotal toxicology 
studies (study Nos 08-2083, 08-2084, 09-2153, 10-2237, AAO00141 and 62509).  
Absorption and exposure of inebilizumab were evaluated in huCD19 Tg mice following single (study No 
ONC551-011)  and  multiple  IV  or  SC  administrations  (study  Nos  08-2083,  08-2084,  09-2153  and  10-
2237). Inebilizumab exhibited nonlinear PK following single IV administration in the 0.5 and 12.5 mg/kg 
dose range, consistent with the presence of an antigen sink. More than a dose-proportional increase in 
exposure  was  observed.  A  decrease  in  clearance  and  an  increase  in  terminal  t1/2 were  observed  with 
increasing inebilizumab dose from 0.5 mg/kg to 12.5 mg/kg. In the 1-month repeat-dose study, systemic 
exposure  increased  more  than  dose-proportionally.  After  last  dose  the  mean  terminal  t1/2 were  7.78, 
12.0  and  14.7  days  for  the  0.675,  3.71,  and  36.6  mg/kg  dose  groups,  respectively.  In  the  3-month 
repeat-dose study, following the first IV administration of inebilizumab to huCD19 Tg mice, nonlinear PK 
were described by a more than a dose-proportional increase in both AUC0-7d and minimum concentration 
on Day 8. The nonlinearity was less pronounced at steady state, consistent with B-cell depletion and the 
consequent loss of the antigen sink. In studies involving placental transfer, adequate exposure of fetus 
to inebilizumab was demonstrated by detecting inebilizumab in the serum of fetuses at levels comparable 
or exceeding the levels measured in the corresponding maternal animals.  
In general, TK data for inebilizumab showed that exposure increased in a dose-proportional manner and 
was independent of sex. Immunogenicity samples were not collected from the TK groups, the impact of 
ADA on TK profiles and TK parameters was not analysed.  
Tissue  distribution  of  inebilizumab  was  carried  out  in  the  Fischer-344  rat  because  antigen-specific  or 
cross-reactive binding studies previously showed that the staining pattern of human tissue panel was 
more similar to the staining pattern in the rat (study No MI-0007). Following a single IV injection in male 
and female Fischer-344 rats the tissue distribution pattern of inebilizumab demonstrated that there were 
no  detectable  membrane-bound  or  intracellular  signal  in  any  of  the  tissues  examined,  except  for  the 
testes (study No ONC551-0012). Due to detectable staining in the testes, the potential testicular toxicity 
of inebilizumab was further investigated in study No 08-2087. Fischer 344 rats were injected IV once 
weekly  with  0,  2.5,  or  25  mg/kg  inebilizumab  for  1  month  (5  injections)  and  revealed  no  macro-  or 
microscopic findings in the testes of treated rats and no evidence of testicular toxicity. 
In studies involving placental transfer, male huCD19 Tg mice received a total of 9 weekly IV injections 
of inebilizumab while female huCD19 Tg mice received a total of 5 weekly IV injections of inebilizumab 
at  the  doses  of  3  or  30  mg/kg.  Following  the  first  and  last  IV  bolus  administration  of  inebilizumab, 
Assessment report  
EMA/266309/2022  
Page 33/137 
 
 
 
 
systemic exposure increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner in the tested range of 3 to 
30 mg/kg. Fetal-to-maternal inebilizumab concentration percent ratios were 114% and 31.1% for dose 
groups  3  and  30  mg/kg,  respectively  (study  No  AAO00141).  Following  3  and  30  mg/kg  intravenous 
(bolus) injection of inebilizumab on Gestation Days 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 and on Lactation Days 1, 4, 7, 
10, 14, 17, and 20 maternal serum concentrations of inebilizumab were approximately dose-proportional 
on  lactation  day  21.  Comparable  maternal  and  pup  serum  levels  of  inebilizumab  on  Lactation 
Day/Postnatal Day 21 indicated inebilizumab is excreted into the milk (study No 62509). 
Inebilizumab is a humanised IgG1κ mAb, which is expected to be degraded to small peptides and amino 
acids. In accordance with ICH S6(R1) the omission of metabolism studies of inebilizumab was accepted.  
As  inebilizumab  is  expected  to  be  degraded  to  small  peptides  and  individual  amino  acids  the  lack  of 
excretion studies is endorsed. 
Inebilizumab  is  a  humanised  mAb  where  the  primary  elimination  pathway  is  clearance  by  the 
reticuloendothelial system. Cytochrome P450 enzymes, efflux pumps, and protein-binding mechanisms 
are  not  involved  in  clearance  of  inebilizumab.  Therefore,  the  potential  risk  of  interaction  between 
inebilizumab and other drugs was considered low and no PK DDI studies were conducted.  
Toxicology 
The toxicological profile of inebilizumab was characterised in two non-GLP single-dose studies (ONC551-
0013 and ONC551-0014) and in three GLP compliant repeat-dose toxicity studies with once weekly IV 
administration  of  inebilizumab  for  1-,  3-  and  6-months  (Study  08-2083,  08-2084  and  09-2153). 
Moreover,  a  GLP  compliant  3-month  study  was  conducted  comparing  SC  and  IV  administration  of 
inebilizumab (Study 10-2237). All toxicological studies were conducted in the transgenic huCD19 mouse 
model, as binding to human CD19 does not occur in standard toxicology models in rodents, rabbits and 
monkeys. With no other pharmacologically relevant animal species, this is endorsed in accordance with 
ICH 56(R1). 
In general, inebilizumab was well tolerated in single-dose studies up to 50 mg/kg and in repeat-dose 
studies up to 30 mg/kg/week, supporting a general NOAEL of 30 mg/kg/week determined based on the 
3- and 6-months IV repeat-dose study. A HED-based safety margin of 6.9-fold and an exposure-based 
safety  margin  of  55-fold  was  calculated  by  comparing  doses  and  exposures  at  the  NOAEL  of  30 
mg/kg/week  over  a  6-month  treatment  period  in  huCD19  Tg  mice  in  the  09-2153  study  and  human 
patients. This is endorsed.  
Consistent  with  the  expected  pharmacological  effect  of  inebilizumab,  B-cell  depletion  occurred  at  all 
doses with a dose-dependent decrease and recovery pattern. Findings were most evident at high doses 
and included decreases in B lymphocytes in blood, spleen and bone marrow, decreased spleen weight 
and histopathological examination showed inebilizumab-related findings in spleen and lymph nodes, as 
a reduction of follicles/germinal centres. A small number of changes unrelated to the pharmacological 
effect  was  detected  in  the  repeat-dose  studies,  most  of  which  were  reversible  after  recovery  and 
therefore not considered adverse. An increased incidence of bronchiolo-alveolar adenomas occurred in 
males  receiving  30  mg/kg/week  by  IV  administration  the  3-month  study  comparing  SC  and  IV 
administration of inebilizumab (Study 10-2237). Additionally, skin lesions were detected predominantly 
in the SC group, indicating an immunosuppressive effect of inebilizumab and hence, an increased general 
risk of infection.  
In all the repeat dose toxicity studies, systemic exposures increased with the dose level. However, none 
of  the  studies  included  TK  data  for  the  control  groups.  This  was  justified  from  a  3R  principle,  since 
transgenic mice was used.

In accordance with ICH S6 (R1), no genotoxicity studies were conducted, and an acceptable weight of 
evidence  discussion  was  presented,  supporting  that any  carcinogenicity  studies  would  most  likely  not 
add clinically relevant information under the current circumstances.    
A dose-dependent treatment-related reduction in fertility index and in the number of pregnant mice per 
number of mice in cohabitation were seen in the GLP compliant combined male and female fertility and 
embryofetal development study.  
In the conducted pre- and postnatal development study, no adverse effects on the F0 dams, F1 growth, 
survival, and reproductive development and performance, and F2 fetuses were detected at any dosage 
level and the NOAELs was considered to be 30 mg/kg/week. However, no NOAEL could be determined 
for F1 development and immunotoxicity, as findings of impaired normal B-cell function were seen in the 
F1 generation at all doses and correlated with findings of placenta crossing and B-cell depletion in the 
combined fertility and embryofetal development study. This is now reflected in SmPC.  
No unexpected tissue cross-reactivity of inebilizumab were seen in cryosection of human, rat (Fischer-
344) and huCD19 Tg mouse tissues (MI-0007). However, in an IV biodistribution study in Fischer rats 
(ONC551-0012) staining of rare cells within the seminiferous tubules of the testes indicated a potential 
for off-target tissue binding of inebilizumab, leading to the conduct of a testicular toxicity study in rats 
(08-2087). Since this staining did not correlate to findings in repeat-dose studies, it is not considered 
clinically relevant. 
In accordance to guideline (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 21*), inebilizumab is not expected to pose 
a risk to the environment. 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, in vitro and in vivo pharmacology studies demonstrated proof of concept and mode of action. 
Antigenic specificity for inebilizumab was determined. The huCD19 Tg mice model was established as 
the relevant species. This model displayed similar binding and effector function as found in human cells 
and predictably demonstrated the pharmacologic effect of CD19+ B-cell depletion and recovery in the 
blood and tissues. Studies on secondary PD, dedicated safety pharmacology and PD DDI were omitted. 
From the PK point of view, the huCD19 Tg was the most relevant  species for non-clinical efficacy and 
safety studies. The repeat-dose studies displayed dose-proportionality and following last administration 
of inebilizumab, parallel terminal phases with similar clearance values and t1/2 were observed in the dose 
range of 3.0 to 36.6 mg/kg for both male and female huCD19 Tg mice. ADA were negligible. Inebilizumab 
was only distributed in the testes. Placental transfer was shown by detecting inebilizumab in the serum 
of fetuses at levels comparable or exceeding the levels measured in the corresponding maternal animals. 
No studies on metabolism, excretion and drug interactions were conducted. 
Overall, the toxicology programme revealed no major concerns. Findings of B-cell depletions in single- 
and  repeat-dose  studies  were  consistent  with  the  expected  pharmacological  effect  of  inebilizumab. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies showed a dose-dependent treatment-related reduction 
in fertility index, B cell depletion in fetuses and impaired B-cell function in the F1 generation of treated 
animals.  Additionally,  a  decrease  in  T-cell  dependent  antibody  response  was  noted  in  the  pre-  and 
postnatal  development  study.  An  in  vivo  study  of  testicular  toxicity  in  rats,  revealed  no  evidence  of 
toxicity at the tested doses.   
Based  on  the  non-clinical  data  presented  by  the  applicant  regarding  PD,  PK  and  toxicology,  the 
application could be approvable.

a In Study 1102, 6 subjects were randomised inebilizumab 30 mg to Cohort 1, but one subject received 100 mg instead of 30 mg. 
2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Inebilizumab  (formerly  known  as  MEDI-551)  is  being  developed  for  the  treatment  of  NMOSD. 
Inebilizumab  is  a  humanised,  affinity  optimised,  afucosylated  immunoglobulin  G1  kappa  (IgG1κ) 
monoclonal antibody that binds to the B cell specific surface antigen CD19 resulting in the depletion of 
CD19+ B cells, plasmablasts and some plasma cells. 
No dedicated human PK studies were conducted for inebilizumab. The clinical pharmacology programme 
assessed the PK, PD, and immunogenicity of inebilizumab in two completed phase 1 studies (CP200 and 
1102, conducted in subjects with scleroderma and multiple sclerosis, respectively), and in one phase 2/3 
global  randomised  prospective  placebo-controlled  study  in  subjects  with  NMOSD  (Study  CD-IA-MEDI-
551-1155 [Study 1155]) (Table 7). Population PK characteristics were assessed based on pooled data 
from all 3 studies and exposure-response characteristics were assessed using data from NMOSD Study 
1155. The population PK (popPK) dataset contained 1617 measurable PK samples from 213 subjects (IV 
administration).  
Dose rationale 
The  recommended  dosing  regimen  of  inebilizumab  is  a  fixed  dose  of  300  mg  administered  as  an  IV 
infusion on treatment day 1 and day 15, and thereafter one dose of 300 mg every 6 months. The 300 
mg fixed dose was selected for study in NMOSD subjects to achieve and maintain persistent depletion of 
peripheral B cells for 28 weeks. The second dose of inebilizumab, administered 2 weeks later, was timed 
to deplete the newly recirculated B cells out of the lymphoid tissues. 
The applicant notes that the selected dose of 300 mg resides on the efficacy plateau.  
Analytical methods 
A  stepwise  enzyme-linked  immunosorbent  assay  method  was  used  to  quantitate  the  PK  inebilizumab 
concentration in human serum samples. The ADA method is a bridging assay format measured on the 
Meso  Scale  Discovery  electrochemiluminescence  technology  platform.  The  CD20+  B  cell  count  in 
peripheral  blood  was  measured  as  an  exploratory  PD  marker  using  a  validated  flow  cytometric,

fluorescence-activated  cell  sorting  method.  In  general,  the  assays  were  considered  adequately 
documented. Presence of ADAs was shown to impact the quantification of inebilizumab resulting in lower 
concentrations. The drug tolerance of the ADA screening and confirmatory assay were acceptable. Many 
of the samples positive for ADAs against inebilizumab came from placebo treated patients or were pre-
treatment samples. Measurement of CD20+B cell count was used as an alternative approach to assess 
for presence of functionally neutralizing antibodies.  
Population PK modelling 
Three datasets (IV data only, combined IV and SC data and SC data only) with data from studies CP200, 
1102 and 1155 were used in the population analyses. The popPK dataset of IV administration contained 
1617  measurable  PK  samples  from  213  subjects.  The  final  IV  PK  model  was  a  2-compartment  model 
with parallel non-specific linear clearance and Michaelis-Menten nonlinear clearance that decreases with 
time. Effect of body weight was included on disposition parameters with estimation of scaling exponents. 
The allometric scaling factors of weight was estimated to 0.39 and 0.4 for volume of distribution in the 
central compartment (Vc) and volume of distribution in the peripheral compartment (Vp) and to 0.57 
and 0.84 for clearance (CL) and Q (inter-compartmental clearance), respectively.

in the peripheral compartment; Vmax= maximum velocity of Michaelis-Menten equation; Kdec= first=order rate constant describing

The  final  parameters  were  estimated  with  good  precision  (all  relative  standard  error  <30%)  and 
interindividual  variability  with  coefficient  of  variation  <30%.  The  IIV  of  Vp  and  maximum  velocity  of 
Michaelis-Menten equation (Vmax) were both estimated with poor precision and high shrinkage suggesting 
data do not inform the estimated distribution of these parameters. The final IV PK model was evaluated 
by bootstrapping (n=1000), goodness-of-fit plots and prediction-corrected Visual Predictive Check. None 
of  the  diagnostics  indicated  trends  of  misspecification  and  the  model  could  adequately  describe  the 
observed data.

After the final IV PK model was developed, the initially excluded PK data from the 6 multiple sclerosis 
subjects (Study 1102) who received inebilizumab subcutaneously were combined with the IV PK data to 
characterise the first order absorption rate constant and absolute bioavailability via SC injection. Data 
were too sparse for reliable estimations.

and descriptive statistics are rounded to 3 significant figures except tmax (rounded to 2 decimal places) and geometric CV% (rounded 
to 1 decimal place).  
The difference in total sample size reported between the 2 doses and overall PK parameters is primarily 
due to subjects with insufficient data in the terminal phase to estimate parameters.  
The  Drug  Substance  included  process  changes  from  a  pilot  Process  (used  on  nonclinical  toxicology), 
Process  1  (used  on  nonclinical  toxicology  and  clinical),  Process  2  (used  on  nonclinical  toxicology  and 
clinical) to a Process 3 (commercial). This also resulted in Drug Product changes that were supported by 
analytical comparability and demonstrated that the commercial Drug Product is comparable to the clinical 
Drug Products that have been used throughout clinical development. No in vivo studies were performed 
with the commercial Drug Product. 
Distribution 
Based on population PK analysis, the estimated typical central and peripheral volume of distribution were 
2.95L  and  2.57L,  respectively.  The  interindividual  variability  of  distribution  volumes  was  low  (≤17% 
coefficient of variation). The distribution volumes increased with body weight. 
Elimination 
From  population  PK  analysis,  the  estimated  systemic  clearance  of  the  first-order  elimination  pathway 
was 0.19 L/day and the t1/2 was 18 days. 
The primary elimination pathways for mAbs like inebilizumab are degradation by the reticuloendothelial 
system  (like  endogenous  IgG)  or  by  target-mediated  elimination.  At  the  therapeutic  dose  level,  the 
nonlinear CD19-mediated elimination pathway is considered to be saturated.   
Dose proportionality  
Following a single IV administration (study CP200), inebilizumab exhibited nonlinear PK in the dose range 
investigated  (0.1-10.0  mg/kg).  The  Cmax  of  inebilizumab  demonstrated  a  dose-proportional  increase, 
while area under the concentration-time curve from dosing to last measurable timepoint (AUClast) and 
AUCinf increased more than dose-proportionally.  
In study 1102, the PK of inebilizumab after two IV administrations was dose-proportional in the 30-600 
mg range (Figure 7).

Time dependencies 
Simulations of the impact of a time-dependent target-mediated CL on inebilizumab PK exposure indicate 
that the exposure is expected to be very similar after the first, second, and third administration.

Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Inter-individual  variability  was  estimated  for  CL,  Vc,  and  Vp  in  the  final  popPK  model  (Table  3).  The 
interindividual  variability  in  the  selected  PK  parameters  estimated  in  the  final  popPK  model  varied 
between 16% and 27%. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Inebilizumab PK was evaluated in both the target population and in two small studies with patients with 
scleroderma and multiple sclerosis. Although other patient populations contribute to the popPK analysis, 
the  results  are  not  expected  to  significantly  deviate  from  what  would  be  seen  in  a  pure  NMOSD 
population.

Impaired renal function 
The  pop  PK  analysis  did  not  indicate  any  impact  of  creatinine  clearance/eGFR  on  CL  of  inebilizumab 
(Figure  9).  However,  data  are  sparse  comprising  63  subjects  with  mild  and  only  3  with  moderate 
impairment, and no subjects with creatinine clearance below 50 ml/min.  
Impaired hepatic function 
The pop PK analysis did not indicate any impact of hepatic impairment on inebilizumab CL (Figure 10). 
However, data are sparse comprising 19 subjects with mild, 2 subjects with moderate, and no subjects 
with severe impairment.  
Figure 9: Inebilizumab CL was not affected by hepatic function, renal function and baseline B-cell count 
CL = clearance; IIV = interindividual variability. The horizontal curves in scatter plots are loess smooth lines. Hepatic impairment (HI) 
was defined as normal if total bilirubin (TB) and aspartate transaminase (AST) are ≤ Upper Normal Limit (UNL); mild HI if TB ≤ UNL 
and AST > UNL or TB > 1 to 1.5 times of UNL and any AST values; moderate HI if TB > 1.5 to 3 times of UNL and any AST values, 
when UNL of TB and AST are 17.1 μmol/L and 40 U/L, respectively. The HI group consists of 19 subjects with mild HI and 2 subjects 
with moderate HI. Due to the 
small number in the moderate HI group, the subjects of mild and moderate HI groups were combined for plotting. 
Renal Impairment (RI) was defined as normal if estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73m2; mild if eGFR is 
60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2; moderate if eGFR is 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2. The RI group consists of 63 subjects with mild RI and 3 
subjects with moderate RI. Due to the small number in the moderate RI group, the subjects of mild and moderate RI groups were 
combined for plotting. 
The number in each box is the number of subjects. The lower and upper hinges correspond to the first and third quartiles (interquartile 
range: IQR), while the line inside in the box is the median of the distribution. The upper whisker extends from the hinge to the largest 
value no further than 1.5 x IQR from the hinge. The lower whisker extends from the hinge to the smallest value at most 1.5 x IQR of 
the hinge. Data beyond the end of the whiskers are called "outlying" points and are plotted individually as solid circles. Boxes are 
drawn with widths proportional to the square-roots of the number of observations in the groups.

Weight 
As for other therapeutic mAbs, inebilizumab CL and distribution volumes increased with body weight. 
The observed range in weight was 38-148 kg.  
PK exposure is lower in subjects with heavier body weight (Q4) compared with the rest of the subjects 
(Figure 10).

Gender, race, and age 
Based on population PK analysis, neither gender, race, nor age affected inebilizumab clearance (Figure 
11). Inebilizumab has not been studied in adolescents or children.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Formal DDI studies have not been conducted for inebilizumab. 
Cytochrome P450 enzymes, efflux pumps, and protein-binding mechanisms are not involved in the CL 
of inebilizumab. The primary elimination pathway for inebilizumab is clearance by the reticuloendothelial 
system in the same way as that for an endogenous IgG. Therefore, the potential risk of PK interactions 
between inebilizumab and other drugs is low.  
Based  on  population  analysis,  commonly  used  small  molecule  drugs  by  subjects  with  NMOSD 
(paracetamol, diphenhydramine, prednisolone, and methylprednisolone) had no impact on inebilizumab 
CL. 
As with other B-cell depleting drugs, concomitant usage of inebilizumab and other IST may result in an 
increased risk of infection. 
Immunogenicity 
In study 1155, during the RCP, the ADA prevalence (at any time including baseline) for inebilizumab-
treated subjects was 9.8% (17/174), while the prevalence for placebo subjects was 14.3% (8/56). 
Although  the  CL  of  inebilizumab  in  ADA-positive  subjects  appeared  higher  than  that  in  ADA-negative 
subjects,  population  analysis  showed  no  statistically  significant  effect  of  the  presence  of  ADA  on  CL 
(Figure 12).

whisker extends from the hinge to the smallest value at most 1.5 * IQR of the hinge. Data beyond the end of the whiskers are called 
"outlying"  points  and  are  plotted  individually  as  solid  circles.  Boxes  are  drawn  with  widths  proportional  to  the  square-roots  of  the 
number of observations in the groups. 
In  study  CP200,  ADAs  against  inebilizumab  were  detected  in  4  out  of  24  subjects  (16.7%),  which  is 
considered a high ratio, and all four subjects had lower exposure to inebilizumab after single dosing. It 
is noted that no apparent impact on B-cell depletion was observed in the ADA-positive subjects following 
a single dose of inebilizumab.  
The  popPK  model  that  accounts  for  time-varying  ADA  status  effect  on  clearance  did  not  show  any 
significant impact. 
AQP4-IgG status 
In  study  1155,  a  difference  in  exposure  between  AQP4-IgG  seronegative  and  seropositive  subjects  is 
noticed 84 days after first exposure. The difference is not considered clinically meaningful. The indication 
is restricted to AQP4-IgG seropositive subjects. 
The concentration-time profiles by AQP4-IgG status are presented in Figure 13 and PK parameters are 
summarised in Table 5.

AQP4-IgG = aquaporin-4 autoantibodies; d = day; IV = intravenous; LLOQ = lower limit of quantitation; n = sample size; NMOSD = 
neuromyelitis  optica  spectrum  disorder;  sero-  =  seronegative;  sero+  =  seropositive.  The  AQP4-IgG  Seropositive  and  AQP4-IgG 
Combined populations had comparable geometric mean concentration-time profiles; therefore, on the semi-log plot, the 2 curves are 
almost fully overlapping. 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Inebilizumab is a humanised, affinity-optimised, afucosylated immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1κ) mAb 
that  binds  to  the  B  cell-specific  surface  antigen  CD19,  resulting  in  the  depletion  of  B  cells,  including 
plasmablasts and some plasma cells.  
The primary PD endpoint was change from baseline in CD20-positive B-cells.  
Assessment  of  an  exposure-efficacy  (E-E)  relationship  was  conducted  using  AC-determined  NMOSD 
attack  as  efficacy  parameter.  Assessment  of  an  exposure-safety  (E-S)  relationship  has  not  been 
provided. 
Depletion of B-cells 
In  study  1155,  following  treatment  with  inebilizumab,  blood  CD20+  B-cell  counts  were  profoundly 
decreased during the 28-week randomised-controlled period (RCP). For B-cell counts, assays for CD20+ 
B-cells were used because the presence of inebilizumab interferes with the recognition of cell surface 
CD19 in the CD19 assay. CD20+ B-cells were significantly reduced 8 days after the initial infusion and 
remained below the lower limit of normal in 100% of inebilizumab-treated subjects at 4 weeks and 94% 
of  subjects  at  28  weeks  after  initial  treatment.  CD20+  B-cell  counts  were  not  significantly  different 
between any RCP timepoints in the placebo group (Figure 14).

Inebilizumab produces a profound depletion of the CD20-positive B-cells, and this effect is not 
influenced by ADA status. Depletion of B-cells stratified by ADA status in study 1155 is depicted in 
Figure 15.

test. No statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed.

It is reported by the applicant that CD19 is expressed on a wider lineage of B cells, compared to CD20, 
and that AQP4 autoantibodies originates from a subpopulation of CD19-positive and CD20-negative B 
cells. In all of the performed studies, B-cell counts were assessed using assays for CD20+ B cells because 
the presence of inebilizumab interferes with the recognition of cell surface CD19 in the CD19 assay. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
Exploratory  exposure-response  (E-R)  analyses  were  conducted  investigating  the  relationship  between 
inebilizumab exposure and endpoints of efficacy by means of Cox proportional hazard models or logistic 
regression models. Kaplan-Meier plots and Forest plots were used to display the results of the analyses. 
No model diagnostics were provided. The effect of  body weight and ADA status on efficacy measures 
was also evaluated. 
Efficacy exposure-response analyses 
The  relationships  between  PK  exposure  and  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  (AC-determined  NMOSD 
attack)  and  key  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were  evaluated.  Three  PK  metrics,  namely  AUC0-14d 
following the first dose, AUCcumulative, and the CL of the first-order elimination pathway, were obtained 
from the population PK modelling (Table 7). 
Table 7: Summary statistics of model-predicted individual PK exposures.  
AUC0-14d = area under the concentration time curve from time 0 to 14 days postdose; AUC0-14d Tertile 1= inebilizumab-treated subjects 
with low AUC0-14d; AUC0-14d  Tertile 2 = inebilizumab-treated subjects with medium AUC0-14d; AUC0-14d  Tertile 3 = inebilizumab-treated 
subjects with high AUC0-14d; AUCcumulative = cumulative area under the concentration time curve from time 0 of Dose 1 to the last 
measurable concentration in RCP; AUCcumulative Tertile 1 = inebilizumab-treated subjects with low AUCcumulative; AUCcumulative Tertile 2 = 
inebilizumab-treated  subjects  with  medium  AUCcumulative;  AUCcumulative  Tertile  3=  300mg  inebilizumab-treated  subjects  with  high 
AUCcumulative; CL = systemic clearance; NA = not applicable; Q1 = inebilizumab-treated subjects with lowest quartile body weight; 
Q2 & Q3 = inebilizumab-treated subjects with interquartile range (2nd and 3rd Quartile) of body weight; Q4 = inebilizumab-treated 
subjects  with  large  quartile  of  body  weight.  For  an  unbiased  assessment  of  the  PK  exposure-response  relationship,  population  PK 
model estimated individual CL was utilised as a surrogate of overall PK exposure AUCinf. Subjects in the Tertile 3 for clearance represent 
subjects with the lowest AUC (Tertile 1) for AUCcumulative and AUC0-14d while subjects in the Tertile 1 for clearance represent subjects 
with the highest AUC (Tertile 3) for AUCcumulative and AUC0-14d

Primary endpoint 
The  Kaplan-Meier  plot  of  AC-determined  NMOSD  attack  during  the  RCP  in  placebo  and  inebilizumab-
treated subjects with low (first tertile), middle (second tertile), and high (third tertile) AUC0-14d is shown 
in Figure 16. The AUC following the first dose was selected for E
R assessment since steady-state PK 
data were unavailable. Per protocol, subjects who experienced an AC-determined NMOSD attack exited 
the RCP and had the option to enrol into the OLP to initiate or continue to receive inebilizumab treatment, 
‐
resulting in incomplete PK profiles following the second dose in those who discontinued treatment in the 
RCP.

low AUC0-14d; Tertile 2 = 300mg inebilizumab-treated subjects with medium AUC0-14d; Tertile 3 = 300mg inebilizumab-treated subjects 
with high AUC0-14d The numbers under the legend represent the corresponding number of subjects for placebo, Tertile 1, Tertile 2 and 
Tertile 3 at the X axis time to AC-determined attack (days). The hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval were 0.289 (0.123 – 0.679) 
for AUC0-14d Tertile 1, 0.189 (0.072 – 0.501) for AUC0-14d Tertile 2, and 0.341 (0.157 – 0.741) for AUC0-14d Tertile 3. 
There  was  no  apparent  relationship  between  the  hazard  ratio  for  the  primary  endpoint  with  AUC0-14d 
(Figure  16),  suggesting  the  300  mg  dose  of  inebilizumab  resides  at  the  efficacy  plateau.  In  fact,  the 
efficacy  was  slightly  lower  in  subjects  with  high  AUC0-14d,  likely  due  to  random  variability  across 
subgroups. 
Exposure: The protocol allowed those who experienced an AC-determined NMOSD attack to leave the 
RCP and enter the OLP, resulting in lower AUCcumulative in such subjects. For an unbiased assessment, 
population PK model-estimated individual CL was utilised as a surrogate of overall PK exposure (AUCinf): 
subjects with slow, medium, and fast CL correspond to the high, medium, and low AUCinf, respectively. 
Among subjects in the inebilizumab group during the RCP, there was essentially no impact of CL on AC-
determined NMOSD attack (Figure 17). The similarity in efficacy outcome in subjects with different CL 
Assessment report

confirmed that the 300 mg dose of inebilizumab resides at the efficacy plateau of lowering NMOSD attack 
probability, i.e., PK variability across subjects had no impact on the therapeutic efficacy outcome. 
Body  Weight:  Reduction  in  the  risk  of  AC-determined  NMOSD  attack  with  inebilizumab  compared  to 
placebo during the RCP was observed in subjects across different body weight groups. With the 300 mg 
dose, there were no clear trends in efficacy across the subjects with different quartiles of body weight 
(Figure 18 and Figure 18). 
ADA:  The  presence  of  ADA  had  no  significant  effect  on  the  risk  of  AC-determined  NMOSD  attacks  in 
subjects with NMOSD (Figure 17).

Key Secondary Endpoints 
A nominally significant improvement with inebilizumab compared with placebo was demonstrated for 3 
of  the  4  key  secondary  endpoints:  worsening  from  baseline  to  the  last  visit  of  the  RCP  in  EDSS, 
cumulative  total  active  MRI  lesions  during  the  RCP,  and  number  of  NMOSD-related  in-patient 
hospitalisations during the RCP. There was no effect of inebilizumab treatment on the secondary endpoint 
of change from baseline in low-contrast visual acuity binocular score measured by low-contrast Landolt 
C Broken Rings Chart at the last visit during the RCP.  
No relationship between exposure, CL, weight, and ADA status of inebilizumab and secondary endpoints 
was demonstrated.

Safety exposure-response analysis 
Infusion-related  reactions  are  an  identified  risk  of  inebilizumab.  Hypersensitivity  reactions  (including 
anaphylaxis  and  serious  skin  reactions),  immune  complex  disease  (vasculitis,  nephritis),  cytopenia, 
serious infections (including viral reactivation and opportunistic infections), and progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML) are potential risks of inebilizumab. These events were assessed as adverse 
events of special interest (AESI) in study 1155.  
Inebilizumab-treated  subjects  were  split  into  4 quartiles  based  on  PK  exposure  (first  dose  AUC0-14d) 
(Table 8). The quartiles were then compared by frequency of treatment-emergent serious adverse events 
(SAEs). Quartile 1 is the group with highest exposure. After receiving the first dose, more patients in 
quartile 1 had SAEs but the number of patients with SAEs is small and no clear exposure related trend 
is observed. In conclusion, no apparent exposure-safety relationship has been demonstrated.

2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Inebilizumab  is  being  developed  for  the  treatment  of  NMOSD.  Inebilizumab  is  a  humanised,  affinity 
optimised, afucosylated immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1κ) mAb that binds to the B cell specific surface 
antigen CD19 resulting in the depletion of CD19 positive (CD19+) B cells, plasmablasts and some plasma 
cells. 
No dedicated human PK studies were conducted for inebilizumab. The clinical pharmacology programme 
assessed the PK, PD, and immunogenicity of inebilizumab in two completed phase 1 studies (subjects 
with  scleroderma  and  multiple  sclerosis),  and  in  one  phase  2/3  randomised  prospective  placebo-
controlled  study  in  subjects  with  NMOSD.  PopPK  characteristics  were  assessed  based  on  pooled  data 
from all 3 studies and exposure-response characteristics were assessed using data from NMOSD Study 
1155. The popPK dataset contained 1,617 measurable PK samples from 213 subjects (IV administration).  
The bioanalysis of inebilizumab is considered adequately documented. Presence of ADAs may impact the 
quantification of inebilizumab in study samples. Drug tolerance of the ADA assay was acceptable. Several 
samples that tested positive for ADAs against inebilizumab came from placebo treated patients or were 
pre-treatment samples.  
The population kinetics for inebilizumab IV was described by a 2-compartment model with parallel non-
specific linear clearance and Michaelis-Menten nonlinear clearance that decreases with time. Body weight 
was the only covariate included. The allometric scaling factors of weight effect on distribution parameters 
were estimated and deviated from the typical values. A model for SC administration (n=6 SC, n=213 
IV)  was  developed  in  an  attempt  to  characterise  the  bioavailability  and  ka,  however,  data  were  too 
sparse for reliable estimations. 
Assessment report  
EMA/266309/2022  
Page 59/137 
 
 
 
 
Due to the PD effect of the substance no dedicated human PK studies in healthy subjects were performed. 
The  effect  of  renal  or  hepatic  impairment  was  not  formally  tested  in  dedicated  clinical  trials,  and  no 
interaction studies has been undertaken. 
The  recommended  dosing  regimen  of  inebilizumab  is  a  fixed  dose  of  300  mg  administered  as  an  IV 
infusion on treatment Day 1 and Day 15, and thereafter one dose of 300 mg every 6 months. 
The  product  is  intended  for  IV  administration  and  the  bioavailability  is  therefore  100%  and  Cmax  is 
reached at the end of infusion. Overall volume of distribution is estimated to be approximately 6 L. The 
reported values of clearance and t1/2 of 0.19 L/day and 18 days, respectively, are typical for mAbs. At 
the therapeutic dose level, a saturation of the CD19-mediated elimination pathway is expected.  
The primary elimination pathways for mAbs like inebilizumab are degradation by the reticuloendothelial 
system (like endogenous IgG) or by target-mediated elimination. Metabolites are amino acids and small 
peptides that are recycled into the protein metabolism.  
Based on study CP200 and 1102, with one and two IV administrations, respectively, dose-proportionality 
of AUC is uncertain due to diverging results. Cmax seems to exhibit dose-proportionality. Simulations of 
the  impact  of  a  time-dependent  target-mediated  CL  on  inebilizumab  PK  exposure  indicate  that  the 
exposure is expected to be very similar after the first, second, and third administration.    
As to special populations, popPK analyses found no impact of age, gender, race, renal impairment, or 
hepatic impairment on inebilizumab clearance.   
No renal or hepatic impairment studies have been conducted. The popPK analysis did not indicate any 
impact of renal or hepatic impairment on CL of inebilizumab. However, data are sparse and no subjects 
with severely impaired renal or hepatic function were evaluated. Given the elimination pathways of the 
drug  product,  an  effect  of  impaired  renal  or  hepatic  function  on  the  exposure  of  inebilizumab  is  not 
expected. 
No clinical DDI studies have been conducted. In the popPK analysis, co-medication with paracetamol, 
methylprednisolone, diphenhydramine, or prednisolone did not seem to influence the CL of inebilizumab. 
As with other B-cell depleting drugs, concomitant usage of inebilizumab and other immunosuppressant 
drugs may result in an increased risk of infection. 
The primary PD endpoint was change from baseline in CD20-positive B-cells. In all three studies in the 
clinical pharmacology programme, inebilizumab treatment led to a major reduction in peripheral CD20-
positive B-cell counts.  
No secondary PD biomarkers of inebilizumab effects have been evaluated. 
In study 1155, the incidence of AC-determined NMOSD attacks (primary efficacy endpoint) was lower in 
all exposure subgroups compared to placebo. No exposure-efficacy relationship was demonstrated. The 
body weight range was 38 kg to 148 kg. As weight is a significant covariate of Vd and clearance, effect 
of weight was tested on response and presented in Kaplan Meier plots. The results did not indicate any 
impact of weight on efficacy (time to onset of AC-Determined NMOSD Attack), and the proposed fixed 
dose (300 mg) seems acceptable.   
There is no indication of an impact on the primary endpoint (AC-determined NMOSD attacks) between 
ADA-positive and ADA-negative subjects receiving inebilizumab.

2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  clinical  pharmacology  programme  consists  of  three  clinical  studies  and  popPK/PD  analyses. 
Considering the nature of the product (mAb), the pharmacology package is considered adequate and the 
proposed dosing of inebilizumab seems appropriate.  
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The evidence of the efficacy of Uplizna (inebilizumab) is based on data from the double-blind (DB) part 
(completed) of one phase 2/3 clinical trial, i.e. Study CD-IA-MEDI-551-1155 (Study 1155). Maintenance 
of the effect is based on available results from the ongoing open label period (OLP) of the study and is 
limited to an updated analysis of annualised Adjudication Committee (AC)-determined NMOSD relapse 
rate (ARR). OLP will continue for a maximum of 3 years after the last subject enrolled.  
2.6.5.1.  Dose response studies 
No  dose-response  study  has  been  conducted.  Dose finding  was  performed in Phase  I  trials  (SAD  and 
MAD studies) in Scleroderma and Relapsing MS patients.  
In the phase 1 study in scleroderma (Study MI-CP200), inebilizumab was administered as an IV infusion 
at single doses up to 10 mg/kg, or placebo was administered.  
In the phase 1 study in relapsing multiple sclerosis (Study 1102), inebilizumab was administered as a 
single fixed IV course (30, 100, or 600 mg) on Day 1 and Day 15, or a single SC dose (60 or 300 mg), 
or placebo was administered.  
All subjects were monitored over a 24-week period. Any subject whose B-cell count had not returned to 
baseline, or lower limit of normal value, was asked to return to the study site every month for 3 months 
and every 3 months thereafter until the B-cell count returned to baseline or lower limit of normal value. 
Based on PK and B-cell PD data from Study CP200, a fixed dose of 300 mg inebilizumab given on Day 1 
and Day 15 was predicted to fully deplete peripheral blood B cells to undetectable levels and maintain 
B-cell suppression for 28 weeks, thereby sustaining B cell depletion for the duration of the RCP. In theory, 
an initial dose of inebilizumab will deplete the peripheral blood B cells; however, additional B cells will 
then recirculate out of the lymphoid tissues. The second dose of inebilizumab on Day 15 was timed to 
deplete the newly recirculated B cells from the peripheral blood. This dose regimen was supported by 
clinical data from other B-cell depleting mAbs, where IV dosing on Day 1 and Day 15 provided optimal 
B-cell  depletion  in  both  blood  and  tissues  (Huffstutter  et  al,  2011;  Hauser  et  al,  2008;  Bar-Or  et  al, 
2008; Kappos et al, 2011).

Methods 
The design of the pivotal trial is a multicentre, multinational, randomised, DB, placebo-controlled, parallel 
group confirmatory trial. The study had screening (28 days), randomised controlled (up to 197 days), 
open label (minimum of one year and a maximum of 3 years after the last subject enters) and safety 
follow up (minimum 52 weeks) periods. 
Study RCP duration was variable for subjects. Subjects who experienced an AC-determined attack in the 
RCP, or who completed the Day197 visit without an attack, exited the RCP and had the option to enrol 
into the OLP and initiate or continue treatment with inebilizumab. Subjects in whom an attack was not 
confirmed  by  the  AC  continued  in  the  RCP  until  Day  197  (or  until  another  attack  occurred  and  was 
determined to be an NMOSD attack by the AC).

•  Study Participants  
Main inclusion criteria: 
Eligible patients in Study 1155 were adults (18 years and older) with an EDSS score ≤ 7.5 (≤ 8.0 if the 
Investigator  and  medical  monitor  agreed  that  the  subject  was  reasonably  able  to  participate  in  the 
study), a diagnosis of NMOSD at the time of screening, and a documented history of ≥ 1 NMOSD attacks 
that required rescue therapy in the previous year or ≥ 2 NMOSD attacks that required rescue therapy in 
the preceding 2 years.  
Subjects who had a relapse immediately prior to screening must have had at least 4 weeks in which their 
relapse symptoms were stable or improving prior to randomisation. 
AQP4-IgG seropositive and seronegative subjects (as tested and verified by the central laboratory only) 
were enrolled in the study. The study was designed to include a ratio of seropositive to seronegative that 
represents  the  reported  ratio  in  the  literature  (approximately  80%  subjects  who  are  AQP4-IgG 
seropositive  and  20%  of  subjects  who  are  AQP4-IgG  seronegative).  Subjects  who  are  AQP4-IgG 
seronegative, where the diagnosis of NMOSD is less clear, needed to meet the clinical criteria for NMOSD 
according to Wingerchuk et al 2006 by the determination of independent Eligibility Committee.

The NMOSD diagnostic criteria were updated in 2015, after enrolment for the study had already begun 
and the protocol was not amended regarding this change. As it turned out, the protocol criteria for AQP4-
IgG  seropositive  subjects  were  consistent  with  the  2015  IPND  diagnostic  criteria  for  NMOSD,  and  as 
such,  the  protocol-defined  study  population  was  representative  of  the  population  defined  by  the  new 
criteria.

The use of background IST while on trial was not permitted. 
A comprehensive set of exclusion criteria addressed concomitant or previous therapy (rituximab or any 
experimental B-cell depleting agent within last 6 months, alemtuzumab, total lymphoid irradiation, bone 
marrow  transplant,  T-cell  vaccination  therapy,  intravenous  immune  globulin  (IVIG),    natalizumab, 
cyclosporin,  methotrexate,  mitoxantrone,  cyclophosphamide,  tocilizumab,  eculizumab),  drug  or  food 
allergy,  autoimmune  diseases,  any  concomitant  disease  that  required  steroid  treatment  within  the  6 
months prior to screening, AQP4-IgG seronegative subjects with a brain MRI abnormality that met the 
diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis, vaccination history, immune status, infection status and risk, 
malignancy risk, general safety, laboratory criteria, B cell counts, and CD19+ B cell counts below the 
lower limit of normal (LLN) according to the central laboratory. 
•  Treatments 
During RCP, a fixed dose of 300 mg inebilizumab was given on Day 1 and Day 15. A placebo-comparator 
treatment arm was chosen for the conduct of this study. 
Inebilizumab and placebo were provided in 10mL vials which were stored at 2ºC to 8ºC and were not 
frozen or shaken. The investigational product (IP) was diluted into a 250 mL 0.9% sodium chloride IV 
infusion bag for administration.  
No  background  IST  for  treatment  of  NMSOD  were  permitted.  A  2-week  course  of  oral  corticosteroids 
(prednisone 20 mg/day or equivalent oral glucocorticoid) (plus a 1-week taper) was given to all subjects 
following the first administration of IP in the RCP only. The rationale was to provide prophylaxis against 
an  NMOSD  attack  for  the  period  wherein  the  PD  effect  of  inebilizumab  was  not  expected  and  when 
increase rate of attack has been reported with other B-cell depletion therapy (e.g. during first month of 
therapy  with  rituximab).  Based  on  PK/PD  data,  a  period  of  approximately  2-4  weeks  is  required  for 
maximal B cell depletion to occur. 
During  the  OLP,  a  fixed  dose  of  300  mg  inebilizumab  administered  on  OLP  Day  1  and  then  every  26 
weeks was predicted to fully deplete peripheral blood B cells to undetectable levels and maintain B-cell 
suppression for the dose interval of the OLP. 
During both the RCP and OLP, all subjects were premedicated with IV methylprednisolone (80-125 mg 
or  equivalent  glucocorticoid),  oral  diphenhydramine  (25-50  mg or  equivalent antihistamine),  and oral 
paracetamol  (acetaminophen;  500-650  mg)  prior  to  IP  administration  to  reduce  the  risk  of  infusion-
related reactions. 
Due to the potential severity of NMOSD attacks and their debilitating nature, rescue therapy was initiated 
as  needed  for  NMOSD  attacks  at  the  discretion  of  the  site  Investigator.  Treatment  of  an  attack  was 
preferably initiated after completion of the attack assessments and the determination as to whether the 
protocol attack criteria were met. However, the Investigator could initiate rescue therapy at any time 
before full assessment was completed. Rescue therapy was given as directed by the investigator and 
may have included IV corticosteroids, IVIG, and/or plasma exchange.

•  Objectives 
Primary Objective:  
To  compare  the  efficacy  of  inebilizumab  versus  placebo  in  reducing  the  risk  of  an  NMOSD  attack  in 
subjects with NMOSD.  
Secondary Objectives:  
To compare the efficacy of inebilizumab versus placebo on the  
1) reduction of EDSS worsening in subjects with NMOSD;  
2) change from baseline of low-contrast visual acuity score in subjects with NMOSD;  
3) reduction of the cumulative active MRI lesion count (new Gd-enhancing or new/enlarging T2);  
4) reduction of NMOSD-related in-patient hospitalisations in subjects with NMOSD.  
Additional secondary objectives were to: 
• 
• 
• 
characterise the long-term efficacy of inebilizumab by means of annualised attack rate;  
evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single course of inebilizumab in subjects with NMOSD 
in the RCP and repeated doses of inebilizumab in the OLP; and  
characterise the PK profile and immunogenicity of inebilizumab in NMOSD subjects. 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint: 
The primary efficacy endpoint was time (days) from Day 1 to onset of an AC-determined NMOSD attack 
on or before Day 197.  
For the primary analysis, only AC-determined attacks were used. 
The NMOSD attack criteria were developed and used in this study. The definition of an NMOSD attack is 
the presence of a new symptom(s) or worsening of an existing symptom(s) related to NMOSD that meets 
at least one of the protocol-defined criteria for an attack (Table 14).  
Subjects  with  new  or  worsening  symptom(s)  of  a  potential  NMOSD  attack  were  evaluated  at  an 
assessment visit at the clinical site by the investigator as soon as possible, but within 72 hours of the 
report. The data from these procedures was provided to the AC to conduct the adjudication. Only attacks 
that  occurred  in  the  RCP  or  OLP  underwent  an  assessment  visit;  attacks  that  occurred  during  the 
screening period, safety follow-up period (SFP), or during an interval between the end of RCP and Day 
1 of OLP did not undergo an assessment visit, but were instead recorded as adverse events (AEs).

CF = counting fingers; EDSS = Expanded Disability Severity Score; FSS = Functional System Scores; Gd = gadolinium; HM = hand 
motion; LP = light perception; MRI = magnetic resonance imaging; NLP = no light perception; NMOSD = neuromyelitis optica spectrum 
disorders; ON = optic neuritis; RAPD = relative afferent pupillary defect.  
a The symptoms listed are examples and are not inclusive of all NMOSD symptoms.  
b Four major areas of the body may be affected by an attack: the optic nerve, resulting in ON; the spinal cord, resulting in myelitis; 
the brainstem, resulting in a number of outcomes; and the brain.  
c At least 2-step drop can be any of the following worsening: on Landolt C Broken Rings Chart to HM, LP, or NLP; CF to LP or NLP; HM 
to NLP.  
d At least 1-step drop can be any of the following worsening: on Landolt C Broken Rings Chart to CF, HM, LP, or NLP; CF to HM or LP 
or NLP; HM to LP or NLP; LP to NLP.  
e Note: A 1-point change in a single FSS without a change in the EDSS, with or without a new Gd-enhancing or new/enlarging T2 MRI 
lesion in the spinal cord, is not considered a clinically significant change and will not count as an attack per this protocol.  
f Lesions seen in the optic chiasm also count toward these criteria.  
g Other neurological  signs  may include:  double vision, dysarthria,  dysphagia, vertigo,  oculomotor  palsy, weakness, nystagmus, or 
other cranial nerve abnormality. 
Key secondary endpoints: 
1. Worsening from baseline in EDSS at last visit during the RCP. A subject will be considered to have a 
worsening in overall EDSS score if one of the following criteria is met: 
a. Worsening of 2 or more points in EDSS score for subjects with baseline score of 0. 
b. Worsening of 1 or more points in EDSS score for subjects with baseline score of 1 to 5. 
c. Worsening of 0.5 points or more in EDSS score for subjects with baseline score of 5.5 or more. 
2. Change from baseline in low-contrast visual acuity binocular score measured by low-contrast Landolt 
C Broken Rings Chart, at last visit during the RCP. 
3. Cumulative total active MRI lesions (new Gd-enhancing or new/enlarging T2) during the RCP. 
4.  Number  of  NMO/NMOSD-related  in-patient  hospitalisations.  In-patient  hospitalisation  is  defined  as 
more  than  an  overnight  stay.  Hospitalisations  for  the  administration  of  NMO-related  medications  or 
procedures only were not counted when measuring this variable. 
Other secondary endpoints: 
ARR  (total  number  of  AC-determined  NMO/NMOSD  attacks  normalised  by  person-years)  during  any 
exposure to inebilizumab. 
Exploratory endpoints: 
Assessment  of  NMOSD  attack  severity,  NMOSD  attack  recovery,  Modified  Rankin  Scale,  Pain  Numeric 
Rating  Scale,  SF-36  Health  Survey,  healthcare  resource  utilisation,  additional  ophthalmology 
assessments.

•  Sample size 
This study was planned to detect a target relative reduction of 60% (HR of 0.4) in risk for time from Day 
1 to onset of an AC-determined NMOSD attack on or before Day 197 with at least 90% power and α = 
0.05 (two-sided). A total of 67 AC-determined NMOSD attacks were required for the ITT population. If 
the seropositive cohort had 80% of the attacks, the study had approximately 82% power to detect the 
target relative reduction of 60%. A blinded review of the attack rate for the first 78 subjects to complete 
the  RCP,  and  a  simulation  based  on  these  subjects  indicated  a  >  90%  probability  of  achieving  the 
required 67 AC-determined attacks with 252 subjects. The number of Japanese subjects was determined 
primarily  by  feasibility  and  did  not  depend  on  a  minimum  number  of  NMOSD  attacks  observed  from 
Japanese subjects. 
•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Following a screening period of up to 28 days, eligible patients were randomised and dosed in a 3:1 ratio 
(IV inebilizumab 300 mg on Day 1 and on Day 15, or matching placebo). Subjects were stratified by 
AQP4-IgG  serostatus  at  screening,  then  further  stratified  by  Japan  versus  Non-Japan  region.  The 
stratification ratio was anticipated to be approximately 80:20 with higher allocation to the seropositive 
cohort. 
Subjects, Investigators, and Sponsor staff were blinded to treatment assignments. The procedures for 
administering  blinded  IP  were  followed  throughout  the  RCP  as  well  as  on  OLP  Day  15  to  ensure  RCP 
treatment assignments remained blinded after subjects entered the OLP. At the time of the CSR (15 May 
2019), subjects and Investigators remained blinded to subjects’ RCP treatment assignments. 
Study personnel responsible for evaluating the key efficacy endpoints (EDSS, ophthalmology data, and 
MRI)  were  not  otherwise  involved  in  the  care  of  the  subject.  This  was  done  to  reduce  the  risk  that 
knowledge  of  other  study  data  (e.g  AEs)  might  bias  their  evaluations.  The  EDSS  and  ophthalmology 
raters also conducted their assessments without access to prior evaluation results to further reduce the 
potential for bias. 
An  independent  data  monitoring  committee  (IDMC)  for  this  study  was  charged  per  protocol  with 
providing oversight of safety, conducting the futility analysis, and monitoring the process and function 
of the AC. 
•  Statistical methods 
Analysis Populations 
Intent-to-treat (ITT) population was defined as all subjects who were randomised into the study, received 
at  least  one  dose  of  IP,  and  which  included  both  AQP4-IgG  seropositive  and  seronegative  subjects. 
Efficacy  results  were  analysed  based  on  both  the  AQP4-IgG  seropositive  population  and  total  ITT 
population.  
Analysis of primary endpoint 
The primary hypothesis for this study was that by depleting CD19+ B cells including plasmablasts and 
some plasma cells, inebilizumab would be effective in reducing the risk of NMOSD attack compared to 
placebo, thus effectively reducing the risk of irreversible disability caused by such attacks. 
The  planned  data  cut-off  date  for  the  primary  analysis  was  when  the  last  subject  completed  the 
discontinuation  visit  following  the  67th  AC-determined  NMOSD  attack,  or  after  all  subjects  have 
completed the RCP if 67 AC-determined attacks did not occur, or when the last subject completed the 
discontinuation visit following discontinuation of enrolment upon recommendation of the IDMC based on 
evidence of efficacy and safety. 
Assessment report  
EMA/266309/2022  
Page 67/137 
 
 
 
For the AQP4-IgG seropositive cohort, the treatment effect for the primary endpoint was assessed using 
the  Cox  proportional  hazards  model  (CPHM)  with  treatment  indicator  (inebilizumab  or  placebo)  as  an 
explanatory factor; whereas for the ITT population, the model also included serostatus as an additional 
explanatory factor. The hazard ratio (HR) of inebilizumab versus placebo was estimated together with 
its associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs).  
Only AC-determined attacks with an assessment visit scheduled within 120 hours (5 days) of reporting 
symptoms and all assessments completed within 10 days of an assessment Visit, were included in the 
primary analysis. Other AC-determined attacks that were not included in primary analysis were included 
in other supportive analyses. Missing baseline evaluations or data for primary analysis were not imputed 
and were considered missing. 
Multiple sensitivity analyses (8 predefined) assess the robustness of the primary endpoint: 
1.  Analysis  using  the  CPHM  with  following  baseline  characteristics  and  treatment  as  explanatory 
variables: number of prior NMOSD relapses, baseline EDSS score. 
2. Analysis similar to primary analysis (attacks from all strata) based on unanimous adjudicated attacks 
(all 3 adjudicators agree) as events, remaining subjects will be considered as censored. 
3.  Analysis  similar  to  primary  analysis  (attacks  from  all  strata)  including  subjects  who  prematurely 
discontinue  the  RCP  without  experiencing  an  AC-determined  attack  as  treatment  failures  (events); 
remaining subjects will be considered as censored. 
4.  Analysis  similar  to  primary  analysis  (attacks  from  all  strata)  including  safety  SFP  data  for  subjects 
who prematurely discontinue the RCP without experiencing an AC-determined attack. Attack data from 
the SFP up to 204 days after the subject’s initial randomisation will be used in the analysis for subjects 
who prematurely discontinue the RCP. If the subject did not have an attack in the SFP before or on Day 
204, then they will be censored at Day 204. 
5. Analysis similar to primary analysis (attacks from all strata) based on only clinical criteria (ie excluding 
attacks that require MRI-dependent criteria); remaining subjects will be considered as censored. 
6. The impact of the loss of attacks outside of the attack assessment windows in the primary analysis 
will be evaluated. The AC-determined attacks falling into different attack assessment windows will be 
analysed similarly to primary analysis. 
•  Attacks regardless of attack assessment window; 
•  Attacks with an Assessment Visit scheduled within 72 hours (3 days) of reporting symptoms 
and all assessments done within 5 days of an Assessment Visit; 
•  Attacks with an Assessment Visit scheduled within 72 hours (3 days) of reporting symptoms, 
regardless whether all assessments are done within 5 days of an Assessment Visit. 
7. The impact of attacks with onset before the full PD effect of inebilizumab has been reached will be 
evaluated. Subjects with AC-determined attacks with onset on or before Day 15 will be censored at the 
time of the attack. 
8. Analysis similar to primary analysis including AC-determined attacks up to and including 27Jan2017; 
remaining subjects will be censored on 27Jan2017 (the appropriate firewalled Sponsor contact, but not 
the study team, received a recommendation from IDMC to stop enrolment and conclude the RCP of the 
study on 27Jan2017.  
Per the US FDA’s request, sensitivity analysis on relapses as reported by subjects was conducted as well. 
The compliance with the study medication for both treatment arms and its impact on the primary and 
key secondary study outcomes were investigated. The applicant also evaluated the impact on key study 
results of study sites with Investigators who disclosed financial interests.

Analysis of secondary endpoints 
The analyses for the key secondary endpoints for the AQP4-IgG seropositive subjects were as follows: 
•  EDSS  worsening:  Treatment  effect  for  secondary  efficacy  endpoint  based  on  EDSS  worsening  was 
assessed using a logistic regression model with treatment and baseline EDSS as explanatory variables. 
The percentage of subjects meeting the endpoint, odds ratios (OR), p value, and 95% CIs of the ORs 
are presented. 
• Low-contrast visual acuity: The treatment effect for the low-contrast visual acuity measured by change 
from  baseline  in  low-contrast  Landolt  C  Broken  Rings  Chart  binocular  scores  was  assessed  using  an 
analysis of covariance model using treatment and baseline Landolt C Broken Rings Chart binocular score 
as explanatory variables. 
• MRI lesions and in-patient hospitalisations: The treatment effect for the secondary efficacy endpoints 
based  on  the  cumulative  number  of  active  MRI  lesions  and  number  of  NMOSD-related  in-patient 
hospitalisations  was  tested  using  Negative  Binomial  regression  with  treatment  as  an  explanatory 
variable. 
Similar analyses were performed for the ITT population by extending the above-mentioned models to 
include an indicator variable for serostatus. 
Missing values of the secondary efficacy endpoints due to dropout or missing data were to be handled 
as follows: 
1.  For  worsening  from  baseline  in  EDSS  endpoint,  missing  values  will  be  considered  as 
‘worsening’ according to non-responder imputation rule. 
2.  For  low-contrast  visual  acuity  endpoint,  the  last  non-missing  value  will  be  considered  for 
analysis. 
Type I error control and multiplicity 
The  primary  endpoint  was  to  be  tested  first  at  α  = 0.05  for  the  AQP4-IgG  seropositive  cohort  and,  if 
significant,  was  to  be  tested  in  the  overall  ITT  population  at  α  =  0.05.  If  the  primary  endpoint  was 
statistically significant in the ITT population, the secondary endpoints were tested. The same sequential 
testing strategy was used within each of 4 individual key secondary endpoints. However, the secondary 
endpoints  were  not  hierarchically  ordered.  Based  on  2  populations  of  interest  (seropositive  and  ITT 
populations) and one primary, four key secondary endpoints, 10 null hypotheses of no treatment effect 
were tested. 
The  multiplicity  adjustment  strategy  based  on  Bonferroni-based  chain  procedure.  Each  secondary 
hypothesis  was  initially  tested  based  on  the  Bonferroni  method  at  α  =  0.05/4  =  0.0125.  If  the  null 
hypothesis  for  a  particular  secondary  endpoint  was  rejected  across  both  the  seropositive  and the  ITT 
populations, the Type I error saved was to be propagated equally to other non-rejected sets of secondary 
null hypotheses. The testing procedure was to be repeated until all null hypotheses were rejected or no 
further null hypothesis could be rejected. 
Subgroup analyses 
Sex (male vs female), baseline EDSS (< 5 vs ≥ 5), number of prior NMOSD relapses (< 2 vs ≥ 2), disease 
duration category (< 5 years vs ≥ 5 years), AQP4-IgG serostatus (positive vs negative) as determined 
at  screening  were  the  five  subgroup  analyses  were  performed  for  the  ITT  population  on  the  efficacy 
endpoints. Per the US FDA’s request, subgroup analyses by race, site region, and previous treatment for 
the prevention of NMO attacks on the primary endpoint were performed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/266309/2022  
Page 69/137 
 
 
 
 
 
Interim analyses 
An unblinded interim analysis was planned for a futility assessment by the IDMC when approximately 34 
(50% of the total planned AC-determined) NMOSD attacks occurred the study. The futility analysis was 
performed per protocol by the IDMC with unblinded data on 14 November 2017, and the study was found 
not futile (Cree et al 2019, appendix). 
A  blinded  review  of  the  attack  rate  for  the  first 78  subjects  to  complete  the  RCP  was  used  to  modify 
sample size in protocol/SAP amendments. 
Results 
•  Participant flow 
Despite planned target population size of 67 AC-determined attacks with 252 subjects, on 07 Sep 2018, 
the  applicant  received  a  recommendation  from  the  IDMC  to  stop  enrollment  and  to  close  the  RCP  as 
efficacy was established and there was no justification to continue to expose patients to the placebo arm 
where risk for attack is higher with no background treatment. All subjects in the RCP at that time were 
given the option to enter the open-label treatment arm. At that point, 231 patients were enrolled with 
230  treated,  and  42  AC-determined  NMOSD  attacks  had  occurred  in  the  RCP  (one  additional  AC-
determined NMOSD attack occurred before DCO for a total of 43 AC-determined NMOSD attacks in the 
RCP). The Sponsor remained blinded until after database lock.  
A total of 231 subjects were randomised to treatment (213 AQP4-IgG seropositive and 18 seronegative). 
230 subjects were included in ITT analyses.  
Overall, 223 subjects (97.0%) completed the RCP and 213 subjects (90.4% for placebo and 95.7% for 
inebilizumab) entered the OLP. The rates of withdrawal during RCP were 3.8% for placebo and 2.5% for 
inebilizumab,  while 
these 
rates  were  17% 
for  placebo/inebilizumab  and  20.8% 
for 
inebilizumab/inebilizumab during OLP. 
The number of subjects randomised from each site was low: one site randomised 10 subjects, 10 sites 
each randomised between 6 and 9 subjects, and the remaining 71 sites each randomised < 6 subjects. 
Other reasons for withdrawal during RCP included (n=3 from inebilizumab arm) disallowed concomitant 
treatment need, incorrect randomisation, NMO attack after randomisation but before dosing, and (n=1 
in placebo arm) patient decision to continue with safety follow up instead of RCP procedures.  
The reasons for withdrawal during OLP included 14 withdrawals of consent, 3 AEs, 3 deaths, 1 lost to 
follow up and 21 due to other reasons.

The original SAP was not submitted, there were 4 subsequent versions: 31 Oct 2016, 27 Feb 2017, 12 
Sep  2018,  and  a  final  version  dated  18  Oct  2018.  The  numerous  amendments  to  the  SAP  are 
predominantly minor; however, the changes also touch upon handling of outcome variables and blinded 
sample size. 
Protocol amendments  
There were 6 protocol amendments in this study: 01 Jul 2014 (before first patient was enrolled), 10 Dec 
2015, 18 Oct 2016, 08 Mar 2017, 16 Jul 2018, 11 Oct 2018.  
Protocol amendment no. 2 included some changes in response to SA from the EMA. Protocol amendment 
no. 4 included the removal of the sample size reassessment (as agreed with the FDA) and the inclusion 
of  clear  guidance  that  stopping  enrolment  is  event  driven  and  based  on  the  occurrence  of  67  AC-
determined NMOSD attacks or when 252 subjects have been enrolled, whichever occurs first. Finally, 
Protocol amendment no. 6 included changes to the protocol based on the recommendations from the 
IDMC, based on evidence of efficacy and safety, to stop study enrolment and allow subjects in the RCP 
at that time the option to enter the OLP. 
•  Baseline data 
Subjects  had  a  mean  age  (range)  of  42.9  years  (18-74  years),  and  the  majority  were  female  with 
proportionally more males among the AQP4-IgG seronegative subjects (47.1%, 8/17) than among the 
AQP4-IgG  seropositive  subjects  (6.1%,  13/213);  the  majority  of  subjects  were  white  (52.2%)  (Table 
10). 
Assessment report  
EMA/266309/2022  
Page 72/137 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 10: Demographics (ITT population) 
Mean baseline EDSS was 3.9 for the ITT population, with variability noted for AQP4-IgG seronegative 
subjects likely due to small numbers of subjects (n = 17 total) (Table 11). 
Assessment report  
EMA/266309/2022  
Page 73/137 
 
 
 
 
 
Most subjects (82.6%) in the ITT population were diagnosed with NMOSD within 5 years prior to study 
Day 1; the mean disease duration was 2.49 years prior to Day 1. Most subjects (83.0%) had experienced 
≥ 2 relapses prior to enrolment ( 
Assessment report  
EMA/266309/2022  
Page 74/137 
 
 
 
 
Table 12).  
The  Eligibility  Committee  rejected  about  two  thirds  of  the  AQP4-IgG  seronegative  subjects  who  were 
referred for review and enrolment confirmation. This high rate of rejection underscores the uncertainty 
of diagnosis of NMOSD in AQP4-IgG seronegative subjects and led to the enrolment of fewer of these 
subjects into the study. The study design did not enforce the enrolment of 20% AQP4-IgG seronegative 
subjects, but rather allowed for open enrolment with the assumption that the ratio between AQP4-IgG 
seronegative and seropositive subjects would represent the reported ratio (20/80%).

•  Numbers analysed 
Efficacy  results  were  analysed  based  on  both  the  AQP4-IgG  seropositive  population  and  total  ITT 
population.  230  subjects  total  were  included  in  ITT  analyses,  213  AQP4-IgG  seropositive  (161  on 
inebilizumab). 
One  randomised  subject,  AQP4-IgG  seronegative,  was  excluded  from  both  the  efficacy  analyses  (ITT 
population)  and  the  safety  analyses  (As-treated  population).  The  subject  was  randomised  to  receive 
inebilizumab and had an NMOSD attack prior to dosing, resulting in discontinuation from the RCP.

Table  15  summarises  the  degree  of  agreement  between  the  AC  and  Investigator  decisions  whether 
potential  NMOSD  attacks  in  the  RCP  met  protocol-defined  attack  criteria.  The  kappa  statistic  for 
agreement between Investigator and AC decisions was 0.6859, indicating moderate agreement. There 
were  64  possible  relapse  events  adjudicated  by  the  AC,  36  in  the  group  treated  with  inebilizumab 
(20.7%) and 28 in the placebo group (50%). The investigator-determined clinical events were 34 in the 
group  treated  with  inebilizumab  and  25  in  the  placebo  group.  AC  confirmed  21  attacks  in  the  group 
treated with inebilizumab and 21 in the placebo group.

Key secondary endpoints: 
1.  Worsening  in  EDSS  score  from  baseline  to  last  visit  of  the  RCP  occurred  in  a  lower  proportion  of 
subjects in the inebilizumab group than the placebo group among AQP4-IgG seropositive subjects (Table 
16 and Table 17). 
Table 16: Worsening from baseline in EDSS using a logistic regression model, randomised-controlled 
period (ITT population) 
AQP4-IgG = autoantibodies against aquaporin-4; CI = confidence interval; EDSS = Expanded Disability Status Scale; ITT = intent-to-
treat sero+ = seropositive; sero- = seronegative.  
a A subject was considered to have a worsening in EDSS score if one of the following criteria was met: (1) Worsening of 2 or more 
points in EDSS score for subjects with baseline score of 0; (2) Worsening of 1 or more points in EDSS score for subjects with baseline 
score of 1 to 5; (3) Worsening of 0.5 points or more in EDSS score for subjects with baseline score of 5.5 or more.  
b Subjects with missing data are imputed as 'worsening'. Denominator represents the total number of subjects in each group with 
baseline.  
c Odds ratio, its 95% CI, and p-value are estimated by logistic regression model, using non-responder imputation, i.e., missing values 
will be considered as 'worsening'.

2. Low-contrast visual acuity binocular score (measured by low-contrast Landolt C Broken Rings Chart) 
change  from  baseline  to  the  last  visit  of  the  RCP  was  similar  in  the  inebilizumab  and  placebo  groups 
(Table 18).

low-contrast visual acuity.  
3. Cumulative total active MRI lesions (new Gd-enhancing or new/enlarging T2) during the RCP (Table 
19). In the RCP, 45.3% of inebilizumab subjects had new Gd-enhancing MRI lesions (placebo 59.6%), 
and 21.7% of inebilizumab subjects had new/enlarging T2 MRI lesions (placebo 40.4%) among AQP4-
IgG seropositive subjects. New Gd-enhancing lesions were most common in the optic nerve, followed by 
spinal  cord  and  brain;  no  new  Gd-enhancing  lesions  were  seen  in  the  brainstem.  New/enlarging  T2 
lesions were most common in the spinal cord, followed by optic nerve, brain, and brainstem.

•  Ancillary analyses 
Multiplicity adjustment: 
A  multiplicity  adjustment  was  performed  for  the  analyses  of  the  primary  and  key  secondary  efficacy 
endpoints. The adjusted p-values remained < 0.05 for all endpoints except for change from baseline in 
low-contrast visual acuity binocular score at last visit.

Persistence of efficacy: 
ARR  (total  number  of  AC-determined  NMO/NMOSD  attacks  normalised  by  person-years)  during  any 
exposure to inebilizumab, as of the primary date of cut-off of 26 Oct2 018, was calculated for evaluating 
persistence of efficacy (Table 22). 
Table 22: Annualised adjudication committee-determined NMOSD attack rate (any inebilizumab 
population) 
AC = Adjudication Committee; AQP4-IgG = autoantibodies against aquaporin-4; SFP = safety follow-up period; sero- = seronegative; 
sero+ = seropositive.  
a Total person-years will  be  calculated as the sum of the person-years for individual subject. Person-year  for individual  subject is 
defined as (Date of last day before SFP - 1st inebilizumab dose date +1)/365.25.  
b Annualised attack rate is defined as total number of AC-determined attacks divided by total person-years. 
At the time of the Day 120 safety update (date of cut-off 06 Jun 2019), an updated analysis of annualised 
AC-determined NMOSD attack rate was performed (Table 23).  
Table 23: Annualised adjudication committee-determined NMOSD attack rate at 120-day safety

a Total person-years were calculated as the sum of the person-years for individual subject. Person-year for individual subject is defined 
as (Date of last day before SFP - 1st inebilizumab dose date +1)/365.25. 
b Annualised attack rate is defined as total number of AC-determined attacks divided by total person-years. 95% CI is calculated using 
exact Poisson confidence interval. 
NMOSD Attacks by Domain 
Table 24 summarises the AC-determined NMOSD attacks by domain. All of the 43 AC-determined NMOSD 
attacks involved myelitis and/or ON. Less than 5% of attacks involved the brainstem, and both of these 
also included either ON or myelitis. No AC-determined attacks affected the brain.

neuritis; RCP = randomised-controlled period; sero+ = seropositive; sero- = seronegative.  
a Subjects with an attack in > 1 domain may be counted in multiple domain categories. Categorisation by domain was determined by 
concordance of AC members Source: Data on file. 
Severity of attacks: 
Severity was assessed using an exploratory scale (opticospinal impairment scale) based on the degree 
of neurological worsening since the prior assessment (Table 25). Similar results were obtained using a 
second exploratory scale based on severity by attack criteria. 
Table 25: AC-determined NMOSD attacks based on severity according to the OSI, RCP (ITT population) 
AQP4-IgG = autoantibodies against aquaporin-4; ITT = intent-to-treat; NMOSD = neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders; ON = 
optic neuritis; OSI = opticospinal impairment scale; RCP = randomised-controlled period; sero+ = seropositive; sero- = 
seronegative. 
Analysis of Attack Recovery: 
Thirteen subjects with RCP attacks in the inebilizumab group and 17 in the placebo group had attack 
follow-up data within 35 days (Table 26).

spectrum disorders; ON = optic neuritis; RCP = randomised-controlled period; sero+ = seropositive; sero- = seronegative.  
a In the placebo group, the number of subjects for whom recovery data was collected was 17. Using this as a denominator to calculate 
percentages yields the following: Major, 11.8%; Minor, 35.5%; No recovery, 52.9%.  
b In the inebilizumab group, the number of subjects for whom recovery data was collected was 13. Using this as a denominator to 
calculate percentages yields the following: Major, 15.4%; Minor, 38.5%; No recovery, 46.2%. 
Exploratory Analyses of Modified Rankin Scale: 
AQP4-IgG  seropositive  subjects  who  received  inebilizumab  were  74.2%  more  likely  to  report  less 
disability compared to placebo subjects. In 52.8% of possible pairs of inebilizumab and placebo subjects, 
inebilizumab subjects had a better outcome than the placebo subjects at the last visit. In 25.7% of pairs, 
placebo  subjects  had  a  better  outcome  and  in  21.5%  of  pairs,  inebilizumab  subjects  were  tied  with 
placebo subjects. This leads to Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney odds of 1.742 (p = 0.0014). 
Exploratory Analyses of Time to First NMSOD Attack in the RCP and OLP and During the OLP: 
Survival probability estimates at Day 197 were 88.7% and 87.7% for the AQP4-IgG seropositive and ITT 
populations,  respectively.  Corresponding  estimates  at  Day  365  of  the  OLP  were  85.1%  and  84.4%, 
respectively.  
In the analysis of time to first AC-determined OLP attack, subjects who received placebo during the RCP 
displayed a similar survival curve in the OLP to that seen in the inebilizumab subjects in the RCP (Figure 
23).

Design 
Study CD-IA-MEDI-551-1155 (Study 1155) is a multicentre, multinational, randomised, double-
blind, placebo-controlled study with an open-label extension period to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of IV inebilizumab in adult patients with AQP4-IgG seropositive or seronegative NMOSD. 
Eligible patients were randomised and dosed in a 3:1 ratio (intravenous [IV] inebilizumab 300 mg 
on Day 1 and on Day 15, or matching placebo). Background immunosuppressive therapy was not 
permitted. 
Subjects were followed for a 197-day period (the randomised controlled-period, RCP) for new or 
worsening symptom(s) of a potential NMOSD attack. The Investigator evaluated all subjects with 
new or worsening symptom(s) of an attack at an attack Assessment Visit at the clinical site. 
An  independent  and  blinded  Adjudication  Committee  (AC)  of  3  expert  NMOSD  physicians 
evaluated all possible NMOSD attacks. The unblinded IDMC performed evaluations of safety and 
clinical outcome data at specified regular intervals throughout the study. 
Subjects who experienced an AC-determined attack in the RCP, or who completed the Day 197 
visit  without  an  attack,  exited  the RCP  and  had  the  option  to  enrol  into  an OLP  and  initiate  or 
continue treatment with inebilizumab in a manner that did not unblind their RCP treatment. 
Duration of main phase: 
197 ± 7 days 
Duration of Run-in phase:  
28 days 
Duration of Extension phase: 
A minimum of one year and a maximum of 3 years after 
the last subject enters the open label period.

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
No  dose-response  study  has  been  conducted.  Dose finding  was  performed in Phase  I  trials  (SAD  and 
MAD  studies)  in  scleroderma  and  Relapsing  MS  patients.  The  300  mg  fixed  dose  of  inebilizumab 
administered IV on Days 1 and 15 was selected for study in NMOSD subjects to achieve and maintain 
persistent depletion of peripheral B cells for 28 weeks. 
The design of the pivotal trial is a multicentre, multinational, randomised, DB, placebo-controlled, parallel 
group confirmatory trial. The study consisted of screening (28 days), randomised controlled (up to 197 
days), open label (minimum of one year and a maximum of 3 years after the last subject enters) and 
safety follow up (minimum 52 weeks) periods. The study was overseen by an IDMC and an AC.

Study RCP duration was variable for subjects. Subjects who experienced an AC-determined attack in the 
RCP, or who completed the Day197 visit without an attack, exited the RCP and had the option to enrol 
into  the  OLP  (open  label  period)  and initiate or  continue treatment  with inebilizumab  (still ongoing in 
2019). Subjects in whom an attack was not confirmed by the AC continued in the RCP until Day 197 (or 
until another attack occurred and was determined to be an NMOSD attack by the AC). 
The  use  of  background  IST  while  on  trial  is  not  permitted  and  no  active  comparator  is  used.  Rescue 
therapy was initiated as needed for NMOSD attacks at the discretion of the site Investigator and may 
have  included  IV  corticosteroids,  IVIG,  and/or  plasma  exchange.  The  CHMP  did  not  initially  endorse 
conducting  a  pure  (no  background  IST  allowed)  placebo-controlled  trial 
for  Inebilizumab 
(EMEA/H/SA/2664/1/2013/III).  This  aspect  was 
further 
revised 
in  a 
follow  up  SA 
(EMEA/H/SA/2664/1/FU/1/2015/II)  and  the  conduction  of  a  placebo-controlled  trial  without  IST  as 
standard  of  care  was  only  regarded  appropriate  considering  included  measures  to  mitigate  placebo 
exposure (e.g. unequal randomisation; use of a time-to-event outcome; limiting the time on placebo in 
a given patient to a maximum of 6.5 months). These conditions were met in current design. There were 
no EU approved treatment options at the time of study design, so no comparison to an active comparator 
is  acceptable.  It  should  be  noted  that  other  treatments  currently  approved  (eculizumab  and 
satralizumab)  for  NMOSD were  studied  as  an  add-on  to  background  IST,  although  one  of  two  pivotal 
studies for satralizumab was also placebo-controlled without IST. Overall, the study design is considered 
acceptable.  However,  due  to  no  IST  use  in  the  background,  the  applicant  was  required  to  discuss  
potential interactions with other IST or treatments for acute management of attacks and amelioration of 
persistent symptoms, instructions for starting treatment with inebilizumab and switching from or to other 
treatments used in standard of care. The applicant added a dedicated subsection in section 4.4 of the 
SmPC: “Prior treatment with immunosuppressive therapies” where the relevant information is included, 
and the concerns are addressed in the risk management plan (RMP). 
The  inclusion  criteria  are  specific  for  NMOSD,  enriched  the  population  for  patients  with  active  and 
relapsing  disease,  and  together  with  exclusion  criteria  they  can  generally  be  considered  to  define  a 
relevant patient population, with a caveat due to inclusion of AQP4-IgG seronegative patients.  
Eligible patients in Study 1155 were adults (18 years and older) with an EDSS score ≤ 7.5 (≤ 8.0 if the 
subject was reasonably able to participate in the study), a diagnosis of NMOSD at the time of screening, 
and a documented history of ≥ 1 NMOSD attacks that required rescue therapy in the previous year or ≥ 
2 NMOSD attacks that required rescue therapy in the preceding 2 years. Enrolment of patients only with 
active  and  relapsing  disease  is  understandable  and  acceptable  due  to  desired  minimum  exposure  to 
placebo and short time in RCT. 
Both treatment naïve and previously treated patients were enrolled, however, patients were excluded if 
previously treated with IST within an interval specified for each such therapy. A comprehensive set of 
exclusion criteria addressed concomitant therapy, autoimmune diseases or any concomitant disease that 
required steroid treatment within the 6 months prior to screening, vaccination history, immune status, 
infection status and risk, malignancy risk, general safety, laboratory criteria, B cell counts, CD19+ B cell 
counts, but were not limited to these. 
The study was designed to include both AQP4-IgG seropositive and seronegative patients (expected ratio 
was the reported ratio in the literature, 80-90% of all subjects are AQP4-IgG seropositive). Subjects who 
are  AQP4-IgG  seronegative,  where  the  diagnosis  of  NMOSD  is  less  clear,  needed  to  meet  the  clinical 
criteria for NMOSD according to Wingerchuk et al 2006 by the determination of Independent Eligibility 
Committee. The CHMP showed some concerns on the inclusion of AQP4-IgG seronegative patients due 
to paucity of scientific evidence supporting the background scientific rationale, potential negative impact 
for  the  assessment  derived  from  the  inclusion  of  a  heterogeneous  group  (differences  from  AQP4-IgG 
seropositive  patients,  differences  within  seronegative  group),  and  the  study  not  being  powered  for

assessing  the  efficacy  of  inebilizumab  in  AQP4-IgG  seronegative  patients  based  on  sample  size 
considerations and the analysis plan presented by the applicant (EMEA/H/SA/2664/1/2013/III).      
The NMOSD diagnostic criteria were updated in 2015, after enrolment for the study had already begun 
and the protocol was not amended regarding this change. As it turned out, the protocol criteria for AQP4-
IgG  seropositive  subjects  were  consistent  with  the  2015  IPND  diagnostic  criteria  for  NMOSD,  and  as 
such,  the  protocol-defined  study  population  was  representative  of  the  population  defined  by  the  new 
criteria. 
As no background IST for treatment of NMSOD were permitted, a 2-week course of oral corticosteroids 
(prednisone 20 mg/day or equivalent oral glucocorticoid) (plus a 1-week taper) was given to all subjects 
following the first administration of IP in the RCP only. The rationale was to provide prophylaxis against 
an NMOSD attack for the period where the PD effect of inebilizumab was not expected (approximately 
2-4 weeks) and when increase rate of attack has been reported with other B-cell depletion therapy (e.g. 
during  first  month  of  therapy  with  rituximab).  The  applicant  informed  that  the  2-week  course  of  oral 
corticosteroids  (plus  a  1-week  taper)  was  not  further  pursued  for  patients  entering  the  OLP  after 
receiving placebo as they have not recently discontinued an IST. The SmPC is updated accordingly to 
inform physicians of this course of therapy for patients starting inebilizumab treatment in clinical trials.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was time to onset of an AC-determined NMOSD attack. It is considered 
appropriate choice as a time to event endpoint helping to minimise the risk of placebo exposure. The 
definition  for  the  criteria  of  the  clinical  endpoint  is  detailed  by  the  protocol,  and  the  events  were 
adjudicated centrally by an independent committee as advisable. Of note, the CHMP recommended using 
investigator-confirmed  attacks  for  the  primary  analyses  and  conducting  sensitivity  analyses  using the 
adjudicated  cases.  However,  all  pivotal  trials  for  inebilizumab,  eculizumab  and  satralizumab  used 
adjudicated events (relapses) for primary endpoint.  
The selected key secondary endpoints were worsening from baseline in EDSS at last visit during the RCP, 
change from baseline in low-contrast visual acuity binocular score at last visit during the RCP, cumulative 
total  active  MRI  lesions  (new  Gd-enhancing  or  new/enlarging  T2)  during  the  RCP,  number  of 
NMO/NMOSD-related  in-patient  hospitalisations.  It  may  be  questioned  whether  the  proposed  and 
endorsed  hierarchical  order  of  key  secondary  endpoints  was  taken  into  account  in  the  submitted 
application as there seems to be many changes on study endpoints and statistical analysis plan on the 
way.  ARR  (total  number  of  AC-determined  NMOSD  attacks  normalised  by  person-years)  during  any 
exposure to inebilizumab was chosen to evaluate maintenance of efficacy over OLP. Although secondary 
endpoints are relevant in the clinical use to evaluate disability or severity of attacks and disease activity 
at patient level, they are not established methods to measure treatment effect on NMOSD.   
According to testing hierarchy in SAP, the primary endpoint was to be tested first at α = 0.05 for the 
AQP4-IgG seropositive cohort and, if significant, was to be tested in the overall ITT population at α = 
0.05. If the primary endpoint was statistically significant in the ITT population, each secondary endpoint 
was tested with the same sequential testing strategy but without a hierarchical order in between different 
endpoint. This strategy is acceptable but could be questioned in the following cases: 
1.  Amendment 6 implicitly plans a stop of the trial for efficacy on IDMC recommendation before reaching 
the 67 final events, this early stop is not accounted for in the proposed multiplicity procedure for 
controlling the overall type-one error. Several looks in the data of a trial need a reallocation of the 
type-one error through interim and final analyses of the primary and key secondary endpoints. As 
justification why the interim step was not accounted for in the multiplicity adjustment process, the 
applicant informed that they did not plan interim looks at efficacy, but it was performed by the IDMC. 
The  explanation  of  not  being  aware  of  the  process  is  not  acceptable.  After  accounting  for  the 
multiplicity adjustment, the p-values for the primary efficacy endpoint were < 0.0001 for both the 
ITT population and AQP4-seropositive patients. Thus, issue is not pursued.

EMA/266309/2022  
Page 94/137 
 
 
 
2.  Tests  on  key  secondary  endpoints  are  not  powered  on  expected  clinical  effects,  any  statistically 
significant test on these endpoints should be supported by relevant clinical benefit. Therefore, the 
secondary endpoints are only briefly described in SmPC.   
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Despite planned target population size of 67 AC-determined attacks with 252 subjects, on 07 Sep 2018, 
the applicant received a recommendation from the IDMC to stop enrolment as efficacy was established 
and there was no justification to continue to expose patients to the placebo arm where risk for attack is 
higher with no background treatment. At that point, 231 subjects were randomised to treatment (213 
AQP4-IgG seropositive and 18 seronegative) at 82 participating sites in 24 countries. 230 patients and 
43  AC-determined  NMOSD  attacks  were  included  in  ITT  analyses.  Overall,  223  subjects  (97.0%) 
completed the RCP and 213 subjects entered the OLP. The percent of screening failure (236/457 51.6%) 
in this study was high. 46/230 (20%) patients reported an important protocol deviation. Overall, 223 
subjects (97.0%) completed the RCP and 213 subjects (90.4% for placebo and 95.7% for inebilizumab) 
entered the OLP. The rates of withdrawal during RCP were 3.8% for placebo and 2.5% for inebilizumab, 
while these rates were 17% for placebo/inebilizumab and 20.8% for inebilizumab/inebilizumab during 
OLP. 
Overall, study population at baseline reflects the intended indication for AQP4-IgG seropositive NMOSD 
and illuminates further the challenges around diagnosis and treatment of seronegative population despite 
“expected” similar phenotype. Subjects had a mean age (range) of 42.9 years (18-74 years), 4.3% of 
the patients were at or above the age of 65, the majority were female (90.9%) and of white race (52.2%) 
with 40.9% enrolled in Europe-Israel region.  
Baseline  disease  characteristics  in  AQP4-IgG  seropositive  subgroup  were  suitable  with  slightly  more 
disability  in  placebo  group  compared  to  inebilizumab  group  with  higher  mean  EDSS  (4.35  vs  3.81), 
higher percentage of patients in EDSS category >5 (30.8% vs 23%), but slightly less disease activity 
with higher number of patients with less than 2 relapses (25% vs 15%) and less mean number of Gd 
enhancing lesions (0.8 vs 1.2). Distribution of involvement as ON, myelitis or brainstem, and ARR prior 
to treatment in the study was well balanced. Slight differences between placebo and active groups in 
AQP4-IgG seropositive subset are not expected to have significant impact on the primary endpoint and 
key secondary endpoints.  
The number of AQP4- IgG seronegative patients was too low for formal statistical testing. This has been 
partly affected by the uncertainty of diagnosis for AQP4-IgG seronegative subjects (too many rejected 
by  AC).  AQP4-IgG  seronegative  subgroup  showed  imbalances  in  demographics  and  baseline  disease 
characteristics  due  to  very  small  numbers.  Specifically,  the  mean  disease  duration  is  significantly 
different in AQP4-IgG seronegative group as 1.2 years (0.2 to 5.5 years) (in comparison to 2.5 years 
(0.1 to 22.2 years) in AQP4-IgG seropositive group), with more significant brain/brainstem involvement 
and  a  smaller  number  of  relapses  concentrated  in  a  shorter  time  period.  Two  out  of  17  seronegative 
patients  (1  out  of  4  seronegative  placebo  subgroup  patients)  had  only  1  attack  at  baseline.  Placebo 
treated patients in AQP4-IgG seronegative group showed baseline differences (only 0.78 years disease 
duration, maximum 3 attacks, 50% brain/brainstem involvement, 2.29 ARR prior to IP administration) 
which could be one of the reasons for observed difference in results from AQP4-IgG seropositive group.  
Due to very short time frame in the RCP and possibly different etiological mechanisms involved in AQP4-
IgG seronegative NMOSD, it is impossible to know if the seronegative patients would have had attacks 
if  they  were  followed  longer  without  inebilizumab  treatment.  Limited  data  suggest  that  seronegative 
NMOSD  might have higher  likelihood  to  be  monophasic  or  to  have  fewer  relapses.  Overall,  AQP4-IgG 
seronegative group is considered as a significantly different group at baseline with very small numbers, 
no  place  in  testing  hierarchy,  no  attacks  observed  in  placebo  subgroup  during  study  period,  and  no 
observed therapy benefit.

As such, the applicant was requested to restrict the indication for AQP4-IgG seropositive patients. The 
proposed  indication  for  inebilizumab  was  changed  as  “indicated  as  monotherapy  for  the  treatment  of 
adults with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) who are anti-aquaporin-4 immunoglobulin 
G  (AQP4-IgG)  seropositive”  after  resolution  of  major  objections  raised  on  the  indication  wording  on 
inclusion of endpoints and AQP4-IgG seronegative patients and intended use as “monotherapy”. 
The efficacy of inebilizumab in reducing risk of attacks in AQP4-IgG seropositive population is confirmed. 
In  the  AQP4-IgG-seropositive  subgroup,  18  (11%)  of  161  participants  receiving  inebilizumab  had  an 
attack compared with 22 (42%) of 52 participants receiving placebo (HR 0.227 [95% CI 0.121–0.423]; 
p  <0.0001).  The  number  needed  to  treat  was  3.23  (95%  CI  2.72–4.54)  (Cree  et  al  2019).  This  is 
considered clinically meaningful change.  The HR of AC-determined attacks with inebilizumab treatment 
relative to placebo was 0.272 (95% CI: 0.1496, 0.4691) for the total ITT population (p < 0.0001). The 
significant result for ITT group is considered to be driven by strong results from seropositive group which 
constitutes 93% of ITT population. 
Sensitivity analyses were consistent with the primary analysis in the sense that the HR estimates were 
all below 1.00 and all sensitivity analyses reached significance (<0.05). Sensitivity analyses of primary 
analysis address most of the concerns around the study conduct (potential unblinding, determination of 
attacks, discontinuations) or heterogeneity of study population.  
There were 64 possible relapse events adjudicated by the AC, 36 in the group treated with inebilizumab 
(20.7%)  and  28  in  the  placebo  group  (50%).  Of  the  64  potential  attacks  assessed  in  the  RCP  of  the 
study, the Investigator determined that 51 (80%) met attack criteria and 13 (20%) did not. In contrast, 
the AC determined that 43 potential attacks (67%) met attack criteria and 21 (33%) did not. Twenty-
one of the 36 (58.3%) events in the inebilizumab group were confirmed by the AC; 22 of the 28 (79%) 
in  the  placebo  group  were  confirmed  by  the  AC.  Despite  higher  rate  of  AC-confirmed  relapses  in  the 
placebo treatment group which could introduce bias, sensitivity analyses of primary endpoint included 
analyses  with  all  investigator  determined  or  patient  reported  attacks  which  supported  results  with 
primary endpoint analysis. The issue is not pursued. All of the 43 AC-determined NMOSD attacks involved 
myelitis and/or ON. Less than 5% of attacks involved the brainstem, and both of these also included 
either ON or myelitis. No AC-determined attacks affected the brain.  
Three of four key secondary endpoints showed nominally significant results but their clinical significance 
was questioned due to methodological concerns and their uncertain predictive value on treatment effect.  
Changes from baseline in low-contrast visual binocular acuity did not differ between inebilizumab and 
placebo recipients. The overall effect of inebilizumab treatment on existing or cumulating disability of 
optic neuritis attacks is unclear, though it should be kept in mind that clinical manifestations of optic 
neuritis are devastating, frequently permanent and lead to blindness and that episodes of optic neuritis 
are more frequently unilateral while the low-contrast visual acuity was tested binocularly. 
At  the  end  of  the  RCP,  significantly  fewer  inebilizumab  than  placebo  recipients  in  the  AQP4-IgG 
seropositive  [16%  vs.  35%  (ORs=0.371;  p  =  0.007)]  and  overall  ITT  [16%  vs.  34%  (ORs=0.370; 
p=0.0049)] populations had worsening on the EDSS. There should be some caution with interpretation 
of  this  result  as  EDSS  is  highly  correlated  with  presence  of  a  recent  attack.  On  the  positive  side, 
exploratory  analysis  with  modified  Rankin  Scale  was  supportive  (AQP4-IgG  seropositive  subjects  who 
received  inebilizumab  were  74.2%  more  likely  to  report  less  disability  compared  to  placebo  subjects) 
and severity of attacks in AQP4-IgG seropositive population were reduced from 45.5% to 33.3% major 
attacks with inebilizumab use. The sustainability of results in longer term follow up is unknown.

The  cumulative  number  of  active  MRI  lesions,  new  Gd-enhancing  MRI  lesions,  new/enlarging  T2  MRI 
lesions  decreased  with  inebilizumab  treatment  compared  to  the  placebo.  In  the  RCP,  45.3%  of 
inebilizumab subjects had new Gd-enhancing MRI lesions (placebo 59.6%), and 21.7% of inebilizumab 
subjects  had  new/enlarging  T2  MRI  lesions  (placebo  40.4%)  among  AQP4-IgG  seropositive  subjects. 
New Gd-enhancing lesions were most common in the optic nerve, followed by spinal cord and brain; no 
new Gd-enhancing lesions were seen in the brainstem. New/enlarging T2 lesions were most common in 
the  spinal  cord,  followed  by  optic  nerve,  brain,  and  brainstem.  The  annualised  rates  of  MRI  lesions 
(cumulative number of active MRI lesions, new Gd-enhancing T1 lesions, new/enlarging T2 MRI lesions) 
in RCP and OLP were presented upon query and the analyses are supportive of the primary endpoint. 
Treatment with inebilizumab reduced the number of in-patient hospitalisations compared to treatment 
with placebo in RCP. The rate ratio between the groups was 0.258 (95% CI:0.0904, 0.7384; p = 0.0115) 
among AQP4-IgG seropositive subjects. 
A multiplicity adjustment performed for the analyses of the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints 
revealed significant results for all except for change in low-contrast visual acuity. 
Persistence of efficacy was evaluated through ARR (total number of AC-determined NMO/NMOSD attacks 
normalised by person-years) during any exposure to inebilizumab. Across the RCP and OLP, as of the 
primary  DCO  of  26Oct2018,  the  annualised  AC-determined  NMOSD  attack  rate  in  any  AQP4-IgG 
seropositive  subject  treated  with  inebilizumab  was  0.13.  Updated  annualised  AC-determined  NMOSD 
attack rate in the same subgroup at the time of the Day 120 safety update (date of cut-off 06 Jun 2019) 
was 0.118 (0.088-0.155). Effect of inebilizumab treatment seen on time to first AC-determined attack 
during RCP was sustained throughout the OLP, as measured by numerically similar survival estimates at 
Day 365 of the OLP (85.1%) compared with those seen on Day 197 of the RCP (88.7%) in the AQP4-
IgG seropositive population. Due to open label design, the results have to be considered cautiously. 
The rhythm of administration was mainly based on experience with rituximab in MS. B cell data show 
persistent depletion in 94% of cases at 28 weeks on Inebilizumab treatment. Further data with memory 
B lymphocytes counts under Inebilizumab treatment should be provided to confirm the maintenance of 
biologic effect in this study. A follow-up study for monitoring of the B cell memory is planned. 
Subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint were performed across the prespecified subgroups related 
to demographics and baseline disease characteristics (sex, race, baseline EDSS, number of prior NMOSD 
relapses, disease duration, AQP4-IgG serostatus, region [Japan/Non-Japan], site region, and previous 
treatment for the prevention of NMOSD attacks. There were no significant interaction p-values for any 
of these subgroup analyses. Post hoc analysis based on patient´s age and additional information on older 
subjects  are  requested  and  reviewed,  however  are  limited  and  it  is  reflected  in  SmPC.  The  "Europe" 
analysis (n=94) proposed in the overview does not correspond to the EU population involved in the trial 
(n=56).  Further  analyses  confirm  that the  treatment  effect  in the  EU  subgroup  is  consistent  with the 
primary analysis: in the AQP4-IgG-seropositive subgroup, 5/40 (12,5%) patients receiving Inebilizumab 
had an attack compared with 3/10 (30%) patients receiving placebo (HR 0,361 [95% CI 0,086–1,516]; 
p  =0,1640).  This  point  estimate  shows  more  than  60%  reduction  risk  of  attacks  under  Inebilizumab 
treatment as compared to the placebo response, which is in line with the 79% and 77% and reduction 
risks  respectively  in  the  non-EU  population  (HR=0.205)  and  overall  seropositive  population 
(HR=0.227).For  the  endpoint  of  low-contrast  visual  acuity,  inebilizumab  was  nominally  better  in  the 
subgroup  with  <  2  prior  NMOSD  relapses  compared  with  ≥  2  prior  relapses  (nominal  p  =  0.0129; 
interaction  p  =  0.0019),  in  Japan  compared  with  non-Japan  (nominal  p  =  0.0026;  interaction  p  = 
0.0317),  and  in  subjects  who  had  not  received  prior  NMOSD  medications  (nominal  p  =  0.0251; 
interaction  p  =  0.0090).  The  results  should  be  interpreted  with  caution  given  the  small  number  of 
subjects  and  insignificant  key  secondary  endpoint  of  low-contrast  visual  acuity.  However,  nominally 
Assessment report

better results for patients with less than 2 relapses might be in line with clinical thinking that frequently 
and permanently diminished visual acuity would not improve with effective relapse control. 
There were concerns around immunogenicity subgroup results (e.g. validity of the ADA assay, interaction 
of ADAs with the quantification of inebilizumab in real-life study samples or clearance of inebilizumab, 
lack of testing for neutralizing antibodies in ADA positive samples and their clinical impact). Observed 
dominance  of  pre-existing  and  treatment-boosted  antibodies  make  it  questionable  that  current  ADA 
assay results could be of any use at all in clinical evaluation in this dossier or in real life. The applicant 
argues that any association between neutralizing antibodies and risk of attacks could be evaluated by B-
cell count as the more reproducible, sensitive, and actionable evaluation of any clinical impact. Due to 
mechanism of action and demonstrated overlap of results on comparison of PK, PD, and efficacy by ADA 
status,  the  argument  is  acceptable.  In  case  of  any  clinical  suspicion  for  loss  of  efficacy  due  to 
immunogenicity, the clinician should follow B-cell counts as a direct measure of clinical impact. In section 
5.1 of the SmPC, a summary of immunogenicity data (in terms of incidence, subtypes of ADA and impact 
on PK, safety, B-cell kinetics) is provided.    
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of inebilizumab in reducing risk of attacks in AQP4-IgG seropositive NMOSD population as 
monotherapy is confirmed. AQP4-IgG seronegative group is considered as significantly different group 
at baseline with very small numbers and no observed therapeutic benefit.  
The use of inebilizumab (Anti-CD19 mAb) in this condition is based on direct depletion of CD19+ B cells 
which  could  be  effective  in  reducing  the  risk  for  NMOSD  attack  by  depleting  plasmablasts  producing 
AQP4-IgG.  
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
In the pivotal phase 2/3 Study 1155, the populations for safety analyses are:  
• 
As-treated population: Subjects who received any IP (either inebilizumab or placebo) were 
included  in  the  As-treated  population  and  analysed  according  to  treatment  received. 
Specifically,  subjects  randomised  to  inebilizumab  who  received  all  placebo  doses  were 
included in the placebo group; conversely, subjects randomised to placebo who received at 
least one dose of inebilizumab were included in the active treatment group. 
• 
• 
• 
Any Inebilizumab population: Subjects who received at least one dose of inebilizumab (either 
in the RCP or OLP).  
Open-label population: Subjects who received at least one dose of inebilizumab during the 
OLP. These subjects had baseline data from the RCP.

A  total  of  225  adult  patients  with  NMOSD  (Study  1155),  24  adult  subjects  with  scleroderma  (Study 
CP200), and 21 subjects with MS (Study 1102) were treated with inebilizumab in these studies. Besides 
deaths, only safety data pertaining to the pivotal Study 1155 are presented in the Clinical Safety part of 
the Overview. 
Across  the  RCP  and  the  OLP  of  Study  1155,  225  subjects  have  received  one  or  more  doses  of 
inebilizumab; 174 of these patients received active treatment during the RCP, while the remainder were 
initially randomised to placebo before receiving active treatment during the open-label study period. The 
median  duration  of  inebilizumab  in  the  overall  Any  inebilizumab  population  was  1178.0  days  and  the 
total inebilizumab exposure was 730.4 person-years. 
The extent of exposure in the RCP was calculated as last RCP dose date minus 1st RCP dose date + 60 
days,  the  latter  representing  5  half-lives  of  inebilizumab;  similarly,  extent  of  exposure  in  the  Any 
Inebilizumab Population was calculated from the date of the last OLP dose (excluding placebo dose at 
Day 15) minus first dose date plus 60 days. Since the B-cell depleting effect of inebilizumab is in the 
order  of  6  months,  the  applicant’s  methodology  regarding  calculation  of  exposure  time  may  be 
considered conservative. 
Overall, considering the rarity of NMOSD, the safety database is deemed sufficient to support MAA for 
inebilizumab. 
Among the inebilizumab groups and placebo groups, demographic and baseline disease characteristics 
were generally well balanced. In the ITT population (which comprised the same subject populations as 
the As-treated Population), the mean age was 42.9 years with a small proportion above the age of 65 
years (4.3%). Of the total population, 90.9% were female. However, the ratio of female to male was 
different between the AQP4-IgG seropositive and seronegative subjects, 93.9% versus 6.1%, and 52.9% 
versus  47.1%,  respectively.  With  Europe  representing  approximately  40%  of  patients  recruited  and 
White race further constituting >50% of the ITT population, the geographical and racial distribution of 
study subjects would not appear to represent any clear limitations to extrapolating the safety results to 
European patients.   
2.6.8.2.  Adverse events 
Overview of Adverse Events 
During the RCP, the majority of subjects had at least one treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) ( 
Assessment report  
EMA/266309/2022  
Page 99/137 
 
 
 
 
Table 29). In the total As-treated population, similar proportions of subjects experienced TEAEs in the 
inebilizumab group (73.0%) and the placebo group (73.2%). There were no deaths during the RCP. The 
proportions of subjects with at least one treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TESAE) and/or ≥ 
Grade 3 TEAE were similar between the inebilizumab group (10.9%) and the placebo group (16.1%). 
During the RCP, in the total As-treated population, the incidence rate of TEAEs per 100 person-years 
was 620.23 in the inebilizumab group and 662.63 in the placebo group. In the OLP, the incidence rate 
of TEAEs per 100 person-years was 227.86 in the inebilizumab/inebilizumab group and 278.51 in the 
placebo/inebilizumab group. 
In the inebilizumab group, 2 subjects had a TEAE resulting in discontinuation of IP and 4 subjects had a 
TEAE  leading  to  dose  interruption.  There  were  no  TEAEs  resulting  in  treatment  interruption  or 
discontinuation in the placebo group.

In the OLP, 61 of 216 subjects (28.2%) had at least one TESAE and/or ≥ Grade 3 TEAE,  5 subjects had 
a TEAE resulting in discontinuation, and 7 subjects had a TEAE resulting in dose interruption (

Overall,  similar  TEAE  profiles  were  observed  in  the  AQP4-IgG  seropositive  and  total  As-treated 
population. There were too few subjects in the seronegative population to draw conclusions based on 
any apparent imbalances. 
Common Adverse Events 
The most common AEs associated with inebilizumab were urinary tract infections, joint pain and other 
pain-related preferred terms (PTs): In the RCP, there were higher proportions of patients treated with 
inebilizumab vs placebo reporting the AEs urinary tract infection (11.5% vs. 8.9%), arthralgia (10.3% 
vs. 5.4%) and back pain (7.5% vs. 3.6%). The reason for the higher rate of arthralgia is unclear. The 
proportion  of  subjects  for  whom  arthralgia  was  reported  during  the  OLP  was  10.3%  for  the 
inebilizumab/inebilizumab  subjects  and  19.3%  for  the  placebo/inebilizumab  subjects.  No  patient 
discontinued Study 1155 due to arthralgia or other pain-related symptoms.  
In addition, falls (4.6% vs. 1.8%), the sensory symptoms dysaesthesia (1.7% vs. 0%), hypoaesthesia 
(3.4% vs. 1.8%) and paraesthesia (2.3% vs. 0%), eye pain (2.3% vs. 1.8%) and blurred vision (1.7% 
vs.  0%)  were  more  common  in  subjects  treated  with  inebilizumab  vs.  placebo.  These  AEs  were  not 
considered treatment-related by the investigators and may be associated with NMOSD.  
Apart from relatively few  events of diarrhoea (n=20 (8.9%), nausea n= 16 (7.1%)) and constipation 
(n=14 (6.2%)) within the gastrointestinal disorders SOC, the most common AEs in the Any Inebilizumab 
Population (Table 32) were overall similar to those described during the RCP.  
No  significant  differences  in  incidence  of  AEs  or  any  new  obvious  safety  signals  were  apparent  when 
limiting the analysis to AQP4-IgG-seropositive subjects.

Adverse Events by Severity 
Most TEAEs reported during the RCP and OLP were mild or moderate in severity.  
Overall,  during  the  RCP,  patients  treated  with  inebilizumab  experienced  fewer  Grade  3  TEAEs  than 
patients treated with placebo (8.0% vs. 12.5%), including in the SOC of Infections and Infestations, the 
SOC under which Grade 3 TEAEs were most frequently reported (n=3 (5.4%) and n=4 (2.3%) in the 
placebo  and  inebilizumab  group,  respectively).  The  only  Grade  3  TEAEs  occurring  in  more  than  1 
inebilizumab-treated  subject  during  the  RCP  were  2  cases  each  of  urinary  tract  infection  and 
hypertension.  
There were 9 subjects with life-threatening (Grade 4) TEAEs in the study. During the RCP, 1 subject in 
inebilizumab group had Grade 4 atypical pneumonia, which resulted in treatment discontinuation. The 
subject was first hospitalised on study day 18, i.e. when the maximal PD effect of inebilizumab had likely 
not occurred. CBC revealed lymphocyte and absolute neutrophil counts within the reference range. The 
sponsor  considered  that  the  event  was  possibly  related  to  study  drug,  however,  possible  risk  factors 
contributing  to  the  event  included  a  history  of  pulmonary  tuberculosis  and  prior  treatment  with 
mycophenolate mofetil within 30 days of AE onset.  
In total, 8 subjects experienced Grade 4 TEAEs during the OLP (4 in the inebilizumab/inebilizumab group 
and 4 in the placebo/inebilizumab group). Among these, 1 subject in the inebilizumab/inebilizumab group 
had Grade 4 respiratory failure. This TEAE involved a 47-year-old female patient initially randomised to 
the  inebilizumab  group  who  was  hospitalised  on  multiple  occasions  for  treatment  of  opportunistic 
respiratory infections, with administered treatments including IV immunoglobulin. There would appear 
to be ample indication that this life-threatening TEAE was likely related to treatment with inebilizumab, 
and that immunosuppression resulting in potentially life-threatening infections is a serious concern, even 
during relatively short duration of treatment.  
The  patient  with  4  TEAEs  reported  with  Grade  4  severity  (CNS  infection,  NMOSD,  probable  PML,  and 
post-cardiac arrest syndrome) is discussed in “Serious Adverse Events and Deaths” below. PTs of Grade 
4 TEAEs observed during the OLP for the remaining 6 subjects are listed below; all were assessed as not

Adverse Events of Special Interest 
During the RCP, infusion-related reactions were more common in the placebo group compared to the 
inebilizumab treatment arm (10.7% vs. 9.2%). The most common infusion-related reaction symptoms 
observed in the Any Inebilizumab population were headache (n =7, 3.1%) and nausea (n = 5, 2.2%). 
In the OLP, infusion-related reactions were less frequent in the inebilizumab/inebilizumab group than in 
the placebo/inebilizumab group. Throughout Study 1155, there were no anaphylactic or other serious 
allergic events related to infusion, with all infusion-related reactions rated Grade 1 or Grade 2, including 
one  Grade  2  infusion-related  reaction  (migraine)  that  was  serious  and  required  hospitalisation  of  the 
patient. 
Infections overall were reported in a similar percentage of patients in both treatment groups during the 
RCP (39.1% in the inebilizumab total group and 41.1% in the placebo group). Also, patients treated with 
inebilizumab experienced fewer serious infections compared to placebo (1.1% vs. 3.6%).  According to 
the originally submitted CSR of Study 1155 dated 15 May 2019 (which formed the basis for the day 80 
Assessment report  
EMA/266309/2022  
Page 109/137 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
critical assessment reports), during the RCP, opportunistic infections were recorded in a lower proportion 
of subjects treated with inebilizumab (2.9%) compared to placebo (10.7%); conversely, in the open-
label period, opportunistic infections occurred more frequently in the inebilizumab/inebilizumab group 
compared to placebo/inebilizumab-treated  subjects  (10.9%  vs.  5.9%).  According  to  the updated  CSR 
(dated 09 Jun 2021) submitted together with the applicant’s MAA Day 120 Clinical Responses, during 
the  RCP  there  were  no  occurrences  of  opportunistic  infection,  and  during  the  OLP  there  were  2 
opportunistic  infections,  both  occurring  in  inebilizumab-treated  subjects.  The  difference  in  observed 
frequency of opportunistic infections between the primary analysis (database lock Dec 2018) and the 
final analysis (database lock Dec 2020) is due to up-versioning of MedDRA between the initial and final 
analyses. The initial analysis was based on the Opportunistic Infection SMQ from MedDRA version 21.0. 
The final analysis was based on the “narrow” terms in the Opportunistic Infection SMQ from MedDRA 
version  23.0.  This  resulted  in  some  preferred  terms  (in  particular  herpes  zoster,  influenza,  and  oral 
herpes) no longer being tabulated as opportunistic infections and accounts for the apparent reduction in 
opportunistic infection frequency; these preferred terms are now categorised in the SOC “Infections.” 
Based  on  the  initial  submission’s  information,  while  the  data  overall  does  not  demonstrate  any  clear 
trend  regarding  opportunistic  infections,  the  noted  between-group  difference  during  the  OLP  could 
indicate  that  treatment  with  inebilizumab  over  the  longer  term  might  indeed  increase  such  risk.  As 
previously discussed, one TEAE of Grade 4 respiratory failure during the OLP was reported for a patient 
in  the  inebilizumab/inebilizumab  group  who  was  hospitalised  on  multiple  occasions  for  treatment  of 
opportunistic respiratory infections. 
There  was  one  case  of  “probable  PML”  (verbatim  term)/”progressive  multifocal  leukoencephalopathy” 
(PT) reported in the OLP, which was associated with a fatal TESAE of pneumonia. This case is presented 
in the section “Serious adverse events and deaths” below.  
Of note, 2 cases of COVID-19 were reported during the OLP of study 1155 (including one fatal case of 
COVID-19  pneumonia  and  3  events  related  to  COVID-19  have  been  reported  in  post-marketing 
surveillance data up to 30Apr2021).  The applicant indicates that SARS-CoV-2 immunisation status of 
the  5  COVID-19  cases  is  not  known  and that  based  on  the  dates  of  occurrence  relative  to  COVID-19 
vaccine availability, vaccination of these patients was unlikely. 
The applicant agrees that data is needed on vaccine responses in patients receiving inebilizumab. COVID-
19  vaccine  responses  are  being  measured  in  the  ongoing  kidney  transplant  desensitisation  study 
(VIB0551.P2.S1) and will be measured in the long-term follow-up of NMOSD patients. 
During  the  OLP,  one  subject  had  a  serious  adverse  event  of  “colon  cancer  stage  III”.  The  size  and 
duration of the randomised controlled period and the open label follow-up extension are too limited to 
adequately assess long-term risks of secondary malignancies (and opportunistic infections).

2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
There was a total of 5 deaths reported in the two phase 1 and one phase 2/3 studies of inebilizumab. 
During the pivotal Study 1155, there were no deaths during the RCP and 3 deaths during the OLP. One 
of these cases involved a patient (age 30-40 years) with longstanding NMOSD and significant baseline 
disability who was initially randomised to placebo. The applicant’s assessment that this death was not 
related to inebilizumab is considered reasonable, as the clinical picture suggested a new NMOSD-related 
proximal CNS lesion affecting respiratory function as likely cause of the subject’s rather sudden demise: 
a  protocol-defined  relapse  occurred  two  days  prior  to  death,  during  which  the  subject  experienced 
increased extremity weakness and new bladder/bowel dysfunction. The second death was a patient (age 
60-70 years) randomised to inebilizumab who after several months of treatment was hospitalised with 
lesions consistent with PML, with differential diagnoses including acute disseminated encephalomyelitis 
and atypical NMOSD relapse. JC virus testing results were discrepant. While a definite diagnosis of the 
CNS lesions could not be established, this case of potential PML together with the fact that other B-cell-
depleting therapies have been associated with risk of PML support an SmPC warning for PML and other 
opportunistic  infections.  The  third  death  involved  a  subject  who  was  randomised  to  inebilizumab  and 
subsequently entered the OLP. The subject died as a result of viral pneumonia due to coronavirus disease 
2019 (COVID-19). Both Investigator and Sponsor assessed this event as not related to inebilizumab.  
There would appear to be no indication that the two deaths in the phase 1 study programme were related 
to treatment with the IP. 
Other Serious Adverse Events 
During  the  RCP,  15  subjects  had  at  least  TESAE:  9  subjects  (5.2%)  in  the  inebilizumab  group  and  6 
subjects (10.7%) in the placebo group. There was no predominant event by PT and there were no overall 
trends observed by SOC. However, with regards to hepatobiliary disorders, 3 TESAEs (PTs: cholangitis 
acute,  cholecystitis  acute  and  hepatic  function  abnormal)  were  reported  in  the  inebilizumab-treated 
group versus none in the placebo group during the RCP. TESAEs within the Infections and infestations 
SOC were reported for 2 patients (1.1%) treated with inebilizumab (“atypical pneumonia” and “urinary 
tract infection”) and for two subjects (3.6%) in the placebo group (PTs: “meningitis viral”, “pneumonia” 
and “septic shock”). During the RCP, 2 subjects in the inebilizumab-arm also experienced hepatobiliary 
SAE  (“cholangitis  acute”,  “cholecystitis  acute”,  as  per  above)  which  could  have  been  included  in  the 
basket of isolated single events involving serious infections. Nonetheless, there was no difference in the 
incidence of serious infections between active and placebo treatment groups. Two of the TESAEs within 
the  active  treatment  group  (“Neuromyelitis  optica  spectrum  disorder”  and  “myelitis  transverse”,  the 
latter reported as non-infectious) were likely due to the disease under study. 
During the OLP, in total 41 subjects (19.0%) had at least one TESAE.  Among these, 23 subjects had 
serious infections, including 8 subjects with urinary tract infection and 6 subjects with pneumonia, two 
of which resulted in death (including one case of COVID-19 pneumonia), two cases of appendicitis as 
well  as  single  cases  of  bacteraemia,  bronchiolitis,  cellulitis,  COVID-19,  chorioretinitis,  Hepatitis  A, 
influenza, intervertebral discitis, neuroborreliosis, osteomyelitis, “possible PML”, pyelonephritis chronic, 
renal abscess, sinusitis, subcutaneous abscess, and herpes zoster. The TESAEs of bronchiolitis, cellulitis, 
herpes zoster, influenza, sinusitis, and subcutaneous abscess were reported as related to IP, as was a 
case of sepsis. TESAEs of seizures and acute kidney injury were also reported.

2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
Laboratory Values Over Time 
No clinically meaningful trends were identified in the average changes from baseline during the RCP or 
OLP  in  haematologic  variables  of  haemoglobin,  haematocrit,  eosinophils,  eosinophils/leukocytes  (%), 
basophils, basophils/leukocytes (%), erythrocytes, mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration, mean 
corpuscular volume, and platelets. 
During the RCP overall, lymphocyte counts were lower in the inebilizumab group than the placebo group, 
which is consistent with the mechanism of action of the drug. With longer-term exposure during the OLP, 
the lymphocyte levels trended back to the baseline level. 
Neutrophil levels were elevated in both treatment groups at Weeks 1 and 2, likely reflecting an effect 
from corticosteroids. Neutrophil levels returned to the baseline level at Week 4. Mean percent change 
from  baseline  at  Week  28  in  neutrophil  levels  was  similar  between  the  treatment  groups  (0.87%  for 
inebilizumab, 1.14% placebo). During the OLP, there was no trend for neutrophil counts. 
No clinically meaningful trends were identified in the average changes from baseline in albumin, alkaline 
phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin, cholesterol, 
creatinine,  gamma  glutamyl  transferase,  magnesium,  potassium,  sodium,  triglycerides,  urate,  or 
glucose. 
Immunoglobulin results by visit in the RCP and OLP are provided for total Ig (Figure 26) and for IgM 
(Figure 27).

Figure 27: Median percent of baseline in IgM levels (Study 1155) 
IgM = immunoglobulin M; OLP = open-label period 
During the OLP, Ig levels generally trended lower over time. Of note are the following: 
• 
In the subjects receiving inebilizumab from the start of the RCP, the median percent of baseline 
in total Ig levels at OLP Week 0 was approximately 90%, decreasing to 70-75% of baseline by 
Study  Day  1107  in  all  inebilizumab-treated  subjects,  including  placebo-randomised  subjects 
receiving inebilizumab in the OLP. 
• 
Ig subtypes followed the same overall decreasing trend as total Ig levels with IgE showing the 
greatest median percentage change from baseline levels at Study Day 1107 (-78%). IgA and 
IgM levels decreased to approximately 58% and 45%, respectively, of baseline by Study Day 
1107. 
• 
The change in IgG levels was more gradual and was consistent with total Ig. 
This progressive decrease in serum immunoglobins, which did not appear to reach a clear plateau, is a 
substantial concern as it may over time lead to increased risk of serious and/or opportunistic infections. 
The level of immunoglobulins should be monitored prior to initiating treatment, during treatment and 
after discontinuation of treatment until B-cell repletion as per SmPC wordings.  
Anti-tetanus  toxoid  IgG  was  measured  to  evaluate  the  effect  on  inebilizumab  on  vaccine-generated 
antibody titres. Tetanus vaccine titres were tested at Day 1 for all subjects. Subjects with a negative 
result  did  not  continue  to  be  tested;  subjects  who  tested  positive  were  tested  at  protocol  specified 
timepoints (RCP: W0 and W28; OLP: W13, W26, W52 and every 26 weeks thereafter).  
Results  were  available  for  91  inebilizumab  and  25  placebo  treated  subjects  at  RCP  Week  28.  Median 
percent change from baseline was 6.82% for inebilizumab and -5.10% for placebo. During the OLP, for 
the group originally randomised to inebilizumab, the median percent change from baseline in titre at OLP 
Week  52  was  15.82%  (n=118),  at  OLP  Week  104  was  7.78%  (n=109),  and  at  OLP  Week  156  was  -
1.01% (n=65). In contrast, for the group originally randomised to placebo, the median percent change 
from baseline in titre at OLP Week 52 was -0.11% (n=40), at OLP Week 104 was -8.85% (n=32), and 
at OLP Week 156 was -13.48% (n=19).

Regarding  the  apparent  decrease  from  baseline  in  median  vaccine  titres  in  the  placebo/inebilizumab 
group during the OLP, the applicant indicated that this decrease was apparent at most of the OLP time 
points with some variation in median values, and concludes that the significance of this effect is not clear 
and may be related to the relatively small number of subjects in the placebo/inebilizumab subgroup as 
the OLP progressed. 
In  conclusion,  vaccine  titre  results  for  subjects  treated  with  inebilizumab/inebilizumab  indicate  no 
reduction  in  tetanus  vaccine  titres  after  3.5  years  of  treatment,  while  results  for  subjects  of  the 
placebo/inebilizumab group are more equivocal. In this regard, the fact that no sentence indicating the 
proportion of patients with positive antibody titres against the tetanus toxin when compared to baseline 
after treatment with inebilizumab has been added in section 4.5, is supported.  
Individual Subject Changes 
During  the  RCP,  a  higher  proportion  of  subjects  in  the  inebilizumab  group  had  at  least  a  2-grade 
worsening from baseline compared to the placebo group in the following laboratory parameters: 
• 
• 
• 
Leukocytes: inebilizumab 6.4% versus placebo 1.8% 
Lymphocytes (decreased): inebilizumab 20.2% versus placebo 8.9% 
Neutrophils: inebilizumab 5.8% versus placebo 0%. 
By analysis of laboratory results in the RCP, a neutrophil level of 1.0 to 1.5 × 109/L was observed in 
6.9% of inebilizumab-treated patients versus 1.8% of placebo-treated patients. A neutrophil level of 0.5 
to  1.0  ×  109/L  was  observed  in  1.7%  of  inebilizumab-treated  patients  versus  0%  of  placebo-treated 
patients. Neutropenia was generally transient, and no subject with laboratory-defined Grade 2 or higher 
neutropenia experienced a serious infection.  
Of 9 reports of neutropenia, the time to onset for 8 events occurred at least 4 weeks after the previous 
dose (range, 34 to 291 days; mean, 151 days) and the duration ranged from 7 to 109 days (mean, 35 
days). The majority of the events were mild to moderate in severity and 9 events resolved. The applicant 
added  “late  onset  neutropenia”  to  the  tabulated  list  of  adverse  reactions  in  section  4.8  of  the  SmPC, 
which  is  supported.  A  dedicated  paragraph  has  been  added  to  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC,  with 
measurements of blood neutrophils to be recommended in patients with signs and symptoms of infection, 
in agreement with SmPC of other B-cell depleting therapies. 
No other clinically meaningful trends were observed. 
Individual Clinically Significant Abnormalities 
Grade 2 leukopenia was numerically more common in the inebilizumab group (3.3% inebilizumab, 0% 
placebo at RCP Week 28). 
There were no Grade 3 or higher leukopenia events. 
Neutropenia reported as AE was numerically more common in the inebilizumab group, though overall 
rates were low: 1.7% vs 0% in placebo for ≥ Grade 3 events during the RCP; 1.9% vs. 0% for ≥ Grade 
3  events  in  the  inebilizumab/inebilizumab  group  compared  to  placebo/inebilizumab-treated  subjects 
during the OLP. No cases of Grade 4-5 neutropenia were reported. Neutropenia lead to discontinuation 
of inebilizumab in one patient following study day 576. The subject had previously experienced two cases 
of mild influenza, which began on study day 375 and study day 438. No other episodes of infection were 
reported  for  this  patient.  Reduced  neutrophil  counts  have  been  reported  for  other  B-cell  depleting 
monoclonal antibodies and may be a class effect.  
There were no cases that fulfilled the Hy’s criteria for hepatic injury

2.6.8.5.  Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic and Extrinsic Factors 
Fewer American Indian or Alaskan Native subjects reported TEAEs (inebilizumab group 35.7% versus 
73.0%  in  total  population;  placebo  group  40.0%  versus  73.2%  in  the  total  population).  Within  the 
inebilizumab group, at least one TEAE was reported in a higher proportion of the subgroup with prior 
NMOSD treatment than the subgroup without prior NMOSD treatment (80.9% versus 57.6%). No other 
notable subgroup differences were present when analyzed by sex, race, geographic region, or previous 
treatment;  however,  some  subgroups  had  too  few  subjects  to  draw  conclusions  regarding  potential 
imbalances.  A  popPK  analysis  indicated  that  there  was  no  significant  effect  of  sex,  age,  or  race  on 
inebilizumab clearance.  
The number of patients >65 years of age in the pivotal Study 1155 was limited to n=10.  
No formal clinical studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of renal or hepatic impairment 
on inebilizumab. 
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
While pregnancy or lactation constituted exclusion criteria in the clinical study programme, pregnancies 
occurred in 3 inebilizumab-treated patients. All 3 children were delivered with no abnormalities or health 
problems reported. 
Immunoglobulins are known to cross the placenta, and lymphocytopenia have been reported in infants 
exposed in utero to maternal treatment with other B-cell depleting antibodies. There was a reduction in 
huCD19+  B  cells  in  the  fetal  livers  of  progeny  of  dosed  mice,  suggesting  inebilizumab  crosses  the 
placenta and depletes B cells. In a study evaluating the reproductive process in huCD19 transgenic mice, 
inebilizumab appeared to be associated with reduced number of pregnancies without apparent adverse 
effects  on  fetal  development.  However,  offspring  from  both  inebilizumab  dose  levels  tested  displayed 
diminished antibody response to functional testing after B-cells had repopulated. 
Considered the above and the fact that women of reproductive age make up a substantial proportion of 
patients with NMOSD a Pregnancy Registry has been requested.  
2.6.8.6.  Immunological events 
Rates of TEAEs, including infusion-related reactions, did not differ based on ADA status. Concerns on the 
validity of the ADA assay were discussed and the arguments provided by the applicant were considered 
acceptable (clinical efficacy discussion). 
No  clinical  data  has  established  a  link  between  B  cell  depletion  and  development  or  worsening  of 
autoimmune diseases. 
2.6.8.7.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The risk of PK DDI involving inebilizumab as either victim or perpetrator is considered low. 
As with other B-cell depleting drugs, concomitant usage of inebilizumab and other IST may increase the 
risk of infection.

2.6.8.8.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
During the RCP, 2 subjects had TEAEs resulting in permanent discontinuation of the IP. Both subjects 
were in the inebilizumab group: 1 subject had atypical pneumonia and the other subject had worsening 
of myasthenia gravis. During the OLP, 5 subjects had TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation; these 
TEAEs were neutropenia, steroid withdrawal syndrome, hepatic steatosis, pneumonia, liver function test 
increased, and breast cancer female.  
Overall, the rates of discontinuation due to AE during the RCP and OLP were low. However, these low 
rates  should  be  viewed  in  context  of  the  short  time  of  treatment  during  the  RCP  (up  to  197  days), 
including the RCP’s time-to-event design, together with the relatively limited duration of the OLP. 
During the OLP, an imbalance in discontinuations due to “Withdrawal of consent” was observed between 
groups  of  AQP4-IgG  seropositive  subjects  (n  =  13  for  inebilizumab/inebilizumab  vs.  n  =  0  for 
placebo/inebilizumab). The applicant has clarified that in no case did the investigator provide a reason 
underlying  such  withdrawals.  While  this  between-group  difference  is  unexplained,  the  unequal 
randomisation (3:1 inebilizumab versus placebo) must be acknowledged. Further, the lack of any clear 
imbalance  between  groups  in  overall  withdrawals  during  the  OLP  (17%  for  placebo/inebilizumab  and 
20.8% for inebilizumab/inebilizumab) and the fact that “AE” was available to the investigator as a reason 
for subject withdrawal offer some level of reassurance. 
2.6.8.9.  Post marketing experience 
On June 11, 2020, the US FDA approved inebilizumab (Uplizna) for treatment of NMOSD in adult patients 
who are AQP4 antibody positive. The applicant provided a summary of requested post-marketing data 
(11 Jun 2020 – 30 Apr 2021). Fifty-two (52) spontaneous case reports are mentioned for a total of 165 
events. Among these events, 9 were considered serious and 156 were considered non-serious. Narratives 
for these 9 SAEs were provided by the applicant but were however not considered very informative due 
to the lack of details and missing information. (These 9 SAEs including 5 cases with limited information 
or  due to  underlying  NMOSD  (gait  inability,  monoplegia,  NMOSD,  blindness  and  NMOSD)  and  3  SAEs 
related to Covid-19 infections). The risk of increased susceptibility to infection is already described in 
section 4.4 of the SmPC and is considered appropriate. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Clinical Studies Contributing to the Safety Evaluation 
The safety assessment of inebilizumab is mainly based on data from the randomised controlled period 
and the OLP of a single pivotal phase 2/3 trial (CD-IA-MEDI-551-1155 [Study 1155]). In addition, data 
from two small, single-dose phase 1 studies, one in patients with scleroderma (Study MI-CP200 [Study 
CP200]) and one in subjects with relapsing forms of MS (Study CD-IA-MEDI-551-1102 [Study 1102]) 
are briefly summarised. 
Safety Population and Exposure 
Patients  recruited  into  the  pivotal  clinical  Study  1155  covered  a  broad  spectrum  of  NMOSD  disease 
severity  at  baseline,  both  naïve  and  previously  treated  patients  were  included.  Background 
immunosuppressive therapy was not permitted. Among 230 subjects randomised and treated during the 
RCP (56 subjects received placebo), only 17 (including 4 placebo-treated subjects) were seronegative 
for  the  antiAQP4-lgG  antibody.  The  ratio  of  female  to  male  was  different  between  the  AQP4-IgG 
seropositive  and  seronegative  subjects,  93.9%  versus  6.1%,  and  52.9%  versus  47.1%,  respectively. 
Otherwise, demographic and baseline disease characteristics did not differ notably in regard to safety 
Assessment report

risks  by  AQP4-IgG  status  and  were  overall  well-balanced  between  treatment  groups.  The  number  of 
patients >65 years of age in Study 1155 was limited to n=10.  
The total exposure among 174 patients treated with inebilizumab during the RCP (duration up to 197 
days) in Study 1155 was 82.55 person-years. Across the RCP and the OLP, 225 subjects received one 
or more doses of inebilizumab, with 87.6% of the subjects in the Any Inebilizumab population having 
received  IP  for  >  548  days.  As  of  end  of  study,  the  total  person  years  of  inebilizumab  exposure was 
730.36,  and  204  subjects  (189  AQP4-IgG-seropositive)  had  been  treated  with  inebilizumab  for ≥366 
days.  
In conclusion, the number of patients exposed to inebilizumab in the pivotal Study 1155 is rather small 
but exceeds the minimum of 100 subjects exposed to IP for at least one year recommended by ICH E1 
guidance.  Furthermore,  the  applicant’s  analysis  of  exposure  time  can  be  considered  conservative: 
exposure time calculations were based on last dose date plus 60 days (to reflect approximately 5 t1/2 of 
IP), however inebilizumab is predicted to maintain B-cell suppression for 28 weeks.  
Disposition 
Two patients (3.6%) in the placebo group and 6 patients (3.4%) in the inebilizumab arm did not complete 
the RCP. Of the 6 subjects in the inebilizumab group who withdrew from the RCP, 2 discontinued due to 
AEs: 1 subject with worsening of myasthenia gravis and 1 subject with atypical pneumonia. During the 
OLP, 5 subjects had TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation; these TEAEs were neutropenia, steroid 
withdrawal  syndrome,  hepatic  steatosis,  pneumonia,  liver  function  test  increased,  and  breast  cancer 
female. These discontinuations due to TEAE do not raise specific concerns, since each TEAE that resulted 
in permanent discontinuation of IP was experienced by one subject. During the OLP, an imbalance in 
discontinuations due to “Withdrawal of consent” was observed between groups of AQP4-IgG seropositive 
subjects (n = 13 for inebilizumab/inebilizumab vs. n = 0 for placebo/inebilizumab). The applicant has 
clarified that in no case did the investigator provide a reason underlying such withdrawals. While this 
between-group difference is unexplained, the unequal randomisation (3:1 inebilizumab versus placebo) 
is acknowledged. Further, the lack of any clear imbalance between groups in overall withdrawals during 
the OLP (17% for placebo/inebilizumab and 20.8% for inebilizumab/inebilizumab) and the fact that “AE” 
was available to the investigator as a reason for subject withdrawal offer some level of reassurance. 
Overview of Adverse Events 
Adverse events were analysed in terms of percentage incidence in standard frequency tables. During the 
RCP,  the  majority  of  subjects  had  at  least  one  TEAE.  In  the  total  As-treated  population,  similar 
proportions  of  subjects  experienced  TEAEs  in  the  inebilizumab  group  (73.0%)  and  the  placebo  group 
(73.2%). In general, during the RCP, patients treated with inebilizumab had proportionately fewer severe 
and serious AEs compared to placebo-treated subjects, and the majority of AEs were mild or moderate.  
During  the  OLP,  the  incidence  rate  of  TEAEs  per  100  person-years  was  227.86  in  the 
inebilizumab/inebilizumab group and 278.51 in the placebo/inebilizumab group. 
Common Adverse Events 
The most common AEs associated with inebilizumab were urinary tract infections, joint pain and other 
pain-related  PTs:  In  the  RCP,  there  were  higher  proportions  of  patients  treated  with  inebilizumab  vs 
placebo reporting the AEs urinary tract infection (11.5% vs. 8.9%), arthralgia (10.3% vs. 5.4%) and 
back pain (7.5% vs. 3.6%). The explanation for the potentially higher rate of joint pain and back pain 
with inebilizumab is unknown. Of note, an even higher rate of arthralgia (> 15%) has been reported for 
another NMOSD therapy (satralizumab (Enspryng)) with a different mechanism of action (interleukin-6 
receptor  antagonism).  No  patient  discontinued  Study  1155  due  to  arthralgia  or  other  pain-related 
symptoms. The opposite finding in use of analgesics during the RCP – reported by 67.9% in the placebo 
Assessment report  
EMA/266309/2022  
Page 118/137 
 
 
 
group vs. 50.6% of subjects randomised to inebilizumab – offers some further level of reassurance. 
Conversely, lower rates of several AEs potentially associated with NMOSD (pain in extremity, pruritus, 
vomiting) were observed in the inebilizumab group compared with placebo. 
No  significant  differences  in  incidence  of  AEs  or  any  new  obvious  safety  signals  were  apparent  when 
limiting the analysis to AQP4-IgG-seropositive subjects.   
Apart  from  relatively  few  events  of  diarrhoea  (n=20  (8.9%),  nausea  (n=16(7.1%))  and  constipation 
(n=14 (6.2%)) within the gastrointestinal disorders SOC, the most common AEs in the Any Inebilizumab 
Population were overall similar to those described during the RCP.     
AEs  involving  infusion-related  reaction,  hypersensitivity,  infections  and  cytopenia  are  among  adverse 
events of special interest discussed below.   
Treatment-emergent serious adverse events 
During the RCP, 15 subjects had at least one TESAE: 9 subjects (5.2%) in the inebilizumab group and 6 
subjects (10.7%) in the placebo group. There was no predominant event by PT and there were no trends 
observed by SOC. During the OLP, 41 subjects had at least one TESAE; 23 subjects had TESAEs in the 
SOC of Infections and infestations, including 8 subjects with urinary tract infections and 4 subjects with 
pneumonia. 
Across  both  treatment  periods,  few  subjects  receiving  inebilizumab  had  TEAEs  leading  to  permanent 
discontinuation  of  IP:  2  subjects  in  the  RCP  (one  with  atypical  pneumonia  and  one  with  myasthenia 
gravis)  and  5  subjects  in  the  OLP  (neutropenia,  steroid  withdrawal  syndrome,  hepatic  steatosis, 
pneumonia, liver function test increased, and breast cancer female). 
Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Infections 
Infections overall were reported in a similar percentage of patients in both treatment groups during the 
RCP (39.1% in the inebilizumab total group and 41.1% in the placebo group). Serious infections were 
reported in 2 subjects (3.6%) in the placebo group and 2 subjects (1.1%) in the inebilizumab group. 
According to the originally submitted CSR of Study 1155 dated 15May2019 (which formed the basis for 
the day 80 critical assessment reports), during the RCP, opportunistic infections were recorded in a lower 
proportion of subjects treated with inebilizumab (2.9%) compared to placebo (10.7%); conversely, in 
the open-label period, opportunistic infections occurred more frequently in the inebilizumab/inebilizumab 
group compared to placebo/inebilizumab-treated subjects (10.9% vs. 5.9%). According to the updated 
CSR (dated 09Jun2021) submitted together with the applicant’s MAA Day 120 Clinical Responses, during 
the  RCP  there  were  no  occurrences  of  opportunistic  infection,  and  during  the  OLP  there  were  2 
opportunistic  infections,  both  occurring  in  inebilizumab-treated  subjects.  The  difference  in  observed 
frequency of opportunistic infections between the primary analysis (database lock Dec 2018) and the 
final analysis (database lock Dec 2020) is due to up-versioning of MedDRA between the initial and final 
analyses. The initial analysis was based on the Opportunistic Infection SMQ from MedDRA version 21.0. 
The final analysis was based on the “narrow” terms in the Opportunistic Infection SMQ from MedDRA 
version  23.0.  This  resulted  in  some  preferred  terms  (in  particular  herpes  zoster,  influenza,  and  oral 
herpes) no longer being tabulated as opportunistic infections and accounts for the apparent reduction in 
opportunistic infection frequency; these preferred terms are now categorised in the SOC “Infections.” 
Based  on  the  initial  submission’s  information,  while  the  data  overall  does  not  demonstrate  any  clear 
trend  regarding  opportunistic  infections,  the  noted  between-group  difference  during  the  OLP  could 
indicate  that  treatment  with  inebilizumab  over  the  longer  term  might  indeed  increase  such  risk.  As 
previously discussed, one TEAE of Grade 4 respiratory failure during the OLP was reported for a patient 
Assessment report  
EMA/266309/2022  
Page 119/137 
 
 
 
in  the  inebilizumab/inebilizumab  group  who  was  hospitalised  on  multiple  occasions  for  treatment  of 
opportunistic respiratory infections. 
Information concerning the mechanism of the risk of infection, need for monitoring and discontinuation 
in case of infections is reflected in section 4.4. of the SmPC. 
There  were  7  subjects  with  life-threatening  (Grade  4)  TEAEs  in  Study  1155  involving  infections,  with 
these subjects including one patient who subsequently died following onset of new brain lesions involving 
possible PML. These events are discussed below (see “Adverse Events by Severity”).  
The SmPC includes a dedicated section for PML in section 4.4.   
Of note, 2 cases of COVID-19 were reported during the OLP of study 1155 (including one fatal case of 
COVID-19  pneumonia  and  3  events  related  to  COVID-19  have  been  reported  in  post-marketing 
surveillance data up to 30Apr2021. The SARS-CoV-2 immunisation status of these 5 COVID-19 cases is 
not known, but based on the dates of occurrence relative to vaccine availability it is likely that these 
patients  had  not  been  vaccinated.  The  Sponsor  agrees  that  data  is  needed  on  vaccine  responses  in 
patients receiving inebilizumab. COVID-19 vaccine responses are being measured in the ongoing kidney 
transplant  desensitisation  study  (VIB0551.P2.S1)  and  will  be  measured  in  the  long-term  follow-up  of 
NMOSD patients. 
In conclusion, while the data overall does not demonstrate any clear trend regarding risk of opportunistic 
or  other  serious  infections,  inebilizumab  was  associated  with  a  small  number  of  life-threatening 
infections,  and  longer-term  treatment  might  well  increase  such  risk.  (See  related  discussion  below 
regarding  progressive  decrease  in  serum  immunoglobulins).  Due  to  exclusion  criteria,  mechanism  of 
action  for  inebilizumab  and  observed  safety  profile,  severe  active  infection  including  active  chronic 
infections such as hepatitis B and tuberculosis, history of PML and severely immunocompromised state 
have been added to the SmPC’s list of contraindications.  
Infusion-related Reactions 
During the RCP, infusion-related reactions were more common in the placebo group compared to the 
inebilizumab treatment arm (9.2% vs. 10.7%). The placebo treatment had the same excipients as the 
active IP.  
Throughout Study 1155, there were no anaphylactic or other serious allergic events related to infusion, 
with  all  infusion-related  reactions  rated  Grade  1  or  Grade  2.  Only  one  infusion-related  reaction  was 
recorded as a serious AE, with this event in the OLP involving a case of migraine with debut during an 
infusion necessitating a single night’s hospitalisation beginning two days post-infusion. Overall, the data 
suggests that infusion of inebilizumab following appropriate pre-medication (IV methylprednisolone (or 
equivalent  glucocorticoid),  oral  diphenhydramine  (or  equivalent  antihistamine)  and  oral  paracetamol) 
appears  to  be  well-tolerated.  Specific  guidance  in  the  event  an  infusion-related  reaction  occurs  is 
provided in section 4.4 of the SmPC. Considering the protein nature of the product, its mechanism of 
action and the fact that the applicant considers hypersensitivity reactions as an important potential risk 
in  the  RMP,  a  warning  on hypersensitivity  reactions  has  been  added  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC.  The 
applicant has listed infusion-related reactions with a frequency of “very common” in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC.

Haematology and coagulation 
During  the  RCP,  a  higher  proportion  of  subjects  in  the  inebilizumab  group  had  at  least  a  2-grade 
worsening from baseline compared to the placebo group in the following laboratory parameters: 
• 
• 
• 
Leukocytes: inebilizumab 6.4% versus placebo 1.8% 
Lymphocytes (decreased): inebilizumab 20.2% versus placebo 8.9% 
Neutrophils: inebilizumab 5.8% versus placebo 0%. 
Since  neutropenia  and  lymphopenia  are  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  infection  and  that 
inebilizumab is intended for chronic administration, the risk of neutropenia and lymphopenia is identified 
in section 4.4 of the SmPC and measurements of blood neutrophils and lymphocytes are recommended 
prior to initiation of treatment with inebilizumab, regularly during treatment and upon signs of infections. 
Since neutropenia and late neutropenia have been reported for B-cell depleting therapies,  a dedicated 
paragraph has been added to section 4.4 of the SmPC, with measurements of blood neutrophils to be 
recommended in patients with signs and symptoms of infection. Lymphopenia and decreased lymphocyte 
count  events  are  consistent  with  the  mechanism  of  action  of  B-cell  depletion.  Neutropenia  has  been 
observed with other B-cell depleting monoclonal antibodies and may be a class effect. 
Neutropenia  was  generally  transient,  and  no  subject  with  laboratory-defined  Grade  2  or  higher 
neutropenia experienced a serious infection. Grade 3 neutropenia occurred in 3 subjects (all treated with 
inebilizumab) during the RCP and in 1 subject (in the inebilizumab/inebilizumab group) during the OLP. 
Neutropenia lead to discontinuation of inebilizumab in one patient (during the OLP). No cases of Grade 
4 neutropenia were reported.  
Malignancies 
One subject had a TESAE of “colon cancer stage III” (PT), which was the first malignancy in the study 
for a subject treated with inebilizumab. The size and duration of the RCP (up to 197 days) and the open 
label follow-up extension (continuing for a maximum of 3 years after the last subject was randomised) 
are  too  limited  to  adequately  assess  long-term  risks  of  secondary  malignancies  (and  opportunistic 
infections).  Of  note,  ocrelizumab,  which  targets  CD20-expressing  B  cells,  has  been  associated  with  a 
(statistically non-significant) increase in malignancies (driven by breast cancer) relative to placebo- and 
interferon beta-1a- comparators (Ocrevus EPAR). In this context, the facts that inebilizumab depletes 
an even wider of B-lymphocytes compared to ocrelizumab would appear to represent cause for concern. 
Language  regarding  malignancy  has  been  provided  in  Section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  although  a  risk  of 
malignancy has not been clearly established with inebilizumab or other B-cell-depleting agents. Active 
malignancies are included among the SmPC’s list of contraindications. Long-term monitoring for risk of 
secondary cancers will be implemented in the RMP. 
Adverse Events by Severity 
During  the  RCP,  patients  treated  with  inebilizumab  experienced  fewer  Grade  3  TEAEs  than  patients 
treated  with  placebo  (8.0%  vs.  12.5%),  including in  the  SOC  of  Infections  and  Infestations,  the  SOC 
under  which  Grade  3  TEAEs  were  most  frequently  reported  (n=4  (2.3%)  and  n=3  (5.4%)  in  the 
inebilizumab  and  placebo  group,  respectively).  The  only  Grade  3  TEAEs  occurring  in  more  than  1 
inebilizumab-treated  subject  during  the  RCP  were  2  cases  each  of  urinary  tract  infection  and 
hypertension.

During the RCP and OLP, there were 9 subjects with life-threatening (Grade 4) TEAEs in Study 1155. 
One  subject  (in  the  inebilizumab  group)  had  Grade  4  atypical  pneumonia  within  the  first  month  of 
treatment, which resulted in discontinuation (possible risk factors contributing to the event included a 
history of pulmonary tuberculosis and prior treatment with mycophenolate mofetil within 30 days of AE 
onset). During the OLP, 8 subjects experienced Grade 4 TEAEs. Among these, 6 subjects had Grade 4 
TEAEs within or related to the Infections and infestations SOC: 1 subject (placebo/inebilizumab group) 
had  Grade  4  cholecystitis  acute,  1  subject  (placebo/inebilizumab  group)  had  Grade  4  perforated 
appendicitis, 1 subject (placebo/inebilizumab group) had Grade 4 urinary tract infection and pneumonia 
among  multiple  events  with  Grade  4  severity,  1  subject  in  the  inebilizumab/inebilizumab  group  had 
Grade 4 respiratory failure, this following persistent opportunistic bacterial, viral and mycotic respiratory 
infections,  1  subject  (inebilizumab/inebilizumab  group)  had  Grade  4  bacteremia,  and  1  subject 
(inebilizumab/inebilizumab group) had 4 Grade 4 TEAEs, which were CNS infection, NMOSD, probable 
PML, and post-cardiac arrest syndrome. The events CNS infection, NMOSD, and PML were the differential 
diagnosis for the single event of new brain lesions observed and are not separate events; this subject 
also experienced a fatal TEAE of pneumonia.   
No fatal (Grade 5) TEAEs occurred during the RCP. During the OLP, there were 3 fatal TESAEs. One of 
these deaths involved a patient (60-70 years)  who developed new brain lesions consistent with, but not 
conclusively  confirmed  as,  PML,  with  differential  diagnoses 
including  acute  disseminated 
encephalomyelitis and atypical NMOSD relapse. While a definite diagnosis of the CNS lesions could not 
be  established,  this  case  of  potential  PML  together  with  the  fact  that  other  B-cell-depleting  therapies 
have  been  associated  with  risk  of  PML  support  an  SmPC  warning  for  PML  and  other  opportunistic 
infections. The second fatality was in a patient (30-40 years) with longstanding NMOSD and significant 
baseline disability who likely developed a new NMOSD-related proximal CNS lesion leading to respiratory 
failure. The applicant’s assessment that the latter death was not related to inebilizumab is considered 
reasonable. The third death involved a subject who was randomised to inebilizumab and subsequently 
entered  the  OLP.  The  subject  died  as  a  result  of  viral  pneumonia  due  to  coronavirus  disease  2019 
(COVID-19). Both Investigator and Sponsor assessed this event as not related to inebilizumab.   
On June 11, 2020, the US FDA approved inebilizumab (Uplizna) for treatment of NMOSD in adult patients 
who are AQP4 antibody positive. The applicant provided a summary of requested post-marketing data 
(11 Jun 2020 – 30 Apr 2021). Fifty-two (52) spontaneous case reports are mentioned for a total of 165 
events. Among these events, 9 were considered serious and 156 were considered non-serious. Narratives 
for these 9 SAEs, while characterised by lack of detail, did not identify new significant safety data (said 
narratives  included  5  cases  of  events  likely  related  to  the  underlying  disease  and  3  cases  related  to 
Covid-19 infections). 
Adverse Events by Subgroups 
Subgroup analyses performed by the applicant did not uncover any noteworthy difference in AE incidence 
by gender, anti-drug antibody status, race or geographic region. However, the small numbers of subjects 
within  certain  subgroups  limit  interpretation  of  the  comparisons.  Likewise,  there  were  no  obvious 
differences in incidence of TESAEs during the RCP or OLP by AQP4-IgG status; again, the limited number 
of subjects in the anti-AQP4 lgG seronegative group together with low number of events within individual 
SOCs limit comparisons.  
Other Safety Concerns 
In  Study  1155,  by  the  end  of  the  RCP,  total  immunoglobulins  decreased  by  approximately  10%  in 
subjects  treated  with  inebilizumab.  Within  each  class  of  Ig,  the  largest  reductions  during  the  RCP  in 
inebilizumab-treated subjects was for IgE and IgM (median percent change from baseline of -35% and 
-32%,  respectively).  The  decrease  in  Ig  over  time  continued  in  the  OLP:  in  subjects  receiving 
inebilizumab  from  the  start  of  the  RCP,  the  median  percent  change  in  total  Ig  and  IgG  levels  was  -
Assessment report  
EMA/266309/2022  
Page 122/137 
 
 
 
12.42% and -8.88%, respectively, at OLP Week 0, declining to -39.19% and -28.64%, respectively, at 
OLP Week156. This progressive decrease in serum immunoglobins, which did not appear to reach a clear 
plateau, is a substantial concern as it may over time lead to increased risk of serious and/or opportunistic 
infections. The applicant provided an analysis on the association of reduced levels of immunoglobulins 
and  occurrence  of  infections  in  inebilizumab-treated  patients.  Results  indicate  that  there  was  no 
statistically significant association between infection rate and worst level of IgG (p = 0.7576), IgM (p = 
0.3354), or IgA (p = 0.3154). Given the limited data, the applicant concluded that data do not rule out 
such an association. As a consequence, warnings on the risk of infection relating to decreased levels of 
immunoglobulins  is  indicated  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC,  and  monitoring  of  immunoglobulins  is  also 
detailed in  section  4.2  of  the  SmPC.  The  study  data  are  not  sufficient  to  permit  determination  of  the 
timing of B-cell repletion; this is reflected by text in SmPC section 4.4. In view of the generally limited 
number  of  subjects  and  the  relatively  short  duration  of  treatment  in  Study  1155,  the  applicant  is 
committed to conduct a long-term safety study with inebilizumab, in order to monitor immunoglobulins 
and evaluate the risk of adverse events within the Infections and infestations SOC.  
While pregnancy or lactation constituted exclusion criteria in the study programme, pregnancies occurred 
in 3 inebilizumab-treated patients. All 3 children were delivered with no abnormalities or health problems 
reported.  In  the  SmPC,  a  period  of  6  months  for  use  of  effective  contraception  following  the  last 
administration  of  inebilizumab  is  recommended.  Based  on  experience  with  other  B-cell  depleting 
antibodies,  section  4.6  of  the  SmPC  includes  information  relating  to  the  potential  risk  of  fetal  B-cell 
depletion and monitoring following in utero exposure to inebilizumab, including that vaccinations with 
live virus vaccines such as BCG vaccine should be postponed until the infant’s B-cell count has recovered. 
Considering that women of reproductive age make up a substantial proportion of patients with NMOSD, 
a pregnancy registry has been requested. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The amount of exposure to inebilizumab in the pivotal phase 2/3 Study 1155 is considered adequate to 
inform a B/R assessment.  
Inebilizumab  causes  prolonged  depletion  of  CD19  positive  (CD19+)  B  cells,  plasmablasts  and  some 
plasma  cells  via  both  antibody-dependent  cellular  cytotoxicity  and  antibody-dependent  cellular 
phagocytosis  mechanisms.  The  most  common  AEs  associated  with  inebilizumab  were  urinary  tract 
infections, joint pain and other pain-related PTs and were apparently manageable conditions, with few 
subjects  discontinuing  due  to  adverse  event.  In  line  with  the  safety  profile  described  for  other  B-cell 
depleting  therapies,  the  primary  risk  associated  with  inebilizumab  is  likely  infections.  Although  Study 
1155 did not demonstrate an increased incidence of infections in inebilizumab-treated subjects compared 
to  placebo,  the  relatively  small  number  of  subjects  and  short  treatment  duration  confer  significant 
uncertainty, and in inebilizumab-treated subjects, several cases of Grade 4 AEs related to infections as 
well as a single death involving possible PML were reported. In particular, inebilizumab was associated 
with a progressive decrease in serum immunoglobulins, which did not appear to reach a clear plateau. 
This is a substantial concern as it may over time lead to increased risk of serious and/or opportunistic 
infections. Inebilizumab’s long-term effects on serum immunoglobulins and on associated risk of infection 
are considered to necessitate further surveillance post-marketing. Furthermore, long-term monitoring 
for risk of secondary cancers will be implemented in the RMP. Considering that women of reproductive 
age  make  up  a  substantial  proportion  of  patients  with  NMOSD  and  that  pregnancies  occurred  in  3 
inebilizumab-treated subjects, a post-authorisation pregnancy registry has been requested.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle 
with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 05 May 2010. The new EURD list entry will therefore 
use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant  to  Article  23(1)  of  Regulation  No  (EU)  726/2004,  Uplizna  (inebilizumab)  is  included  in  the 
additional  monitoring  list  as  it  contains  a  new  active  substance  which,  on  1  January  2011,  was  not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is a rare, chronic, autoimmune, inflammatory, disorder 
of the CNS with a worldwide prevalence of 0.5-10/100,000. The disease is characterised by attacks of 
predominantly  ON  and  longitudinally  extensive  transverse  myelitis,  and,  less  frequently,  affecting the 
brain and brainstem. Cases clinically diagnosed as NMOSD may include AQP4-IgG seropositive and AQP4-
IgG seronegative  
Up to 90% of patients with NMOSD have relapsing episodes of ON and myelitis rather than following a 
monophasic  course.  A  second  attack  occurs  within  1  year  of  onset  in  60%  of  AQP4-IgG  seropositive 
patients and within 3 years in 90% of patients. Attacks can be severe and result in blindness, paralysis, 
Assessment report  
EMA/266309/2022  
Page 128/137 
 
 
 
and even death due to neurogenic respiratory failure. There are cases of monophasic NMOSD but the 
criteria that accurately predict long-term adherence to a monophasic course cannot currently be defined. 
An interval longer than 4 weeks between index attacks indicates relapsing disease (Wingerchuk et al, 
2015).  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Patients  who  are  AQP4-IgG  seropositive  should  be  assumed  to  be  at  risk  for  relapse  indefinitely  and 
preventive  treatment  should  be  considered,  even  in  the  setting  of  a  prolonged  clinical  remission 
(Wingerchuk et al, 2015).  
Current treatments for NMOSD are aimed at prevention of attacks, acute management of attacks, and 
amelioration of persistent symptoms. High-dose steroids and plasmapheresis are generally used for the 
acute  management  of  attacks.  Symptomatic  treatments  are  used  to  address  symptoms,  which  can 
include  general  and  neuropathic  pain  (e.g,  anti-epileptics,  anti-spasmodics,  anti-depressants,  or 
analgesics),  bowel  (e.g,  laxatives),  bladder  (e.g,  bethanechol),  and  fatigue  and  depression  (e.g, 
psychotherapy  or  medication)  disorders.  Patients  with  NMOSD  have  been  treated  prophylactically  for 
attack prevention with off-label immunosuppressants such as azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, daily 
prednisone, or rituximab. Since 2019 to the date of this report, two new therapies have been authorised 
in EU for the treatment of APQ4-IgG seropositive NMOSD patients.  
Results of uncontrolled studies with rituximab (anti-CD20) provide low level evidence for utility of B-cell 
depletion as a means of preventing attacks in NMOSD. B-cell analysis of rituximab failures revealed the 
presence  of  CD19+/CD20-  plasmablasts,  which  supports  the  need  for  a  more  comprehensive  B  cell-
depleting therapy than rituximab for effective treatment of this disease. CD19 is expressed on a wider 
lineage of B cells, from pro-B to plasmablasts and some plasma cells, compared to CD20. It is therefore 
conceivable that direct depletion of CD19+ B cells could be more effective in reducing the risk for NMOSD 
attack by more effectively depleting plasmablasts producing AQP4-IgG, being the hypothesis tested for 
inebilizumab.  
After the first dose, inebilizumab is administered once every 6 months which makes the posology very 
convenient for the patients. Therefore, there is a still medical need in this very severe and rare disease, 
in particular with regards to preventing relapse with a convenient posology. This is also supported by 
patients  who  were  consulted  by  EMA  through  Eurordis  (a  non-profit  alliance  of  rare  disease  patient 
organisations). 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence of the efficacy submitted is a single phase 2/3 multicentre, randomised, DB, placebo-
controlled  study  comparing  300  mg  iv  inebilizumab  or  placebo  (without  any  background  IST)  in 
previously treated or de-novo adult patients with NMOSD who have an EDSS score ≤ 7.5 (≤ 8.0 if able 
to participate in the study) and a relapsing active course of disease (≥ 1 relapse in the prior year, or ≥ 
2 in the prior 2 years, that required rescue therapy) (Study CD-IA-MEDI-551-1155, Study 1155). The 
RCP duration was maximum 6.5 months.  
The primary objective was to compare the efficacy of Inebilizumab versus placebo in reducing the risk 
of an NMOSD attack in subjects with NMOSD. The primary endpoint was defined as time to onset of an 
AC- determined NMOSD attack on or before Day 197. 
230 NMOSD patients were randomised, 213 patients were AQP4-IgG positive (161 in Inebilizumab arm 
and 52 in placebo arm) and 17 were AQP4-IgG seronegative (13 in Inebilizumab arm and 4 in placebo 
arm).

Maintenance of the effect is based on available results from the ongoing open label period of the study 
and is limited to an updated analysis of AC-determined ARR.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Primary Endpoint: 
In  the  AQP4-IgG-seropositive  subgroup,  18  (11%)  of  161  participants  receiving  inebilizumab  had  an 
attack compared with 22 (42%) of 52 participants receiving placebo (HR 0.227 [95% CI 0.121–0.423]; 
p  <0.0001)  representing  a  77.3  %  reduction  in  the  risk  of  relapse.  For  ITT  population  (AQP4-IgG-
seropositive and seronegative), the HR of AC-determined attacks with inebilizumab treatment relative 
to placebo was 0.272 (95% CI: 0.1496, 0.4691) (p < 0.0001). Sensitivity analyses were consistent with 
the primary analysis in the sense that the HR estimates were all below 1.00 and all sensitivity analyses 
reached significance (<0.05). 
Key secondary endpoints: 
Three of four key secondary endpoints showed nominally significant results.  
At  the  end  of  the  RCP,  significantly  fewer  inebilizumab  than  placebo  recipients  in  the  AQP4-IgG 
seropositive [16% vs. 35% (odds ratio 0.371; p = 0.007)] and overall ITT [16% vs. 34% (odds ratio 
0.370; p=0.0049)] populations had worsening on the EDSS.  
The  cumulative  number  of  active  MRI  lesions,  new  Gd-enhancing  MRI  lesions,  new/enlarging  T2  MRI 
lesions decreased with inebilizumab treatment compared to the placebo in both AQP4-IgG seropositive 
subjects (rate ratio 0.568 [95% CI: 0.3851, 0.8363]; p = 0.0042) and ITT population (rate ratio 0.566 
[95%  CI:  0.3866,  0.8279];  p  =  0.0034).  In  the  RCP,  45.3%  of  inebilizumab  subjects  had  new  Gd-
enhancing MRI lesions (placebo 59.6%), and 21.7% of inebilizumab subjects had new/enlarging T2 MRI 
lesions (placebo 40.4%) among AQP4-IgG seropositive subjects. New Gd-enhancing lesions were most 
common in the optic nerve, followed by spinal cord and brain; no new Gd-enhancing lesions were seen 
in  the  brainstem.  New/enlarging  T2  lesions  were  most  common  in  the  spinal  cord,  followed  by  optic 
nerve, brain, and brainstem. 
Treatment with inebilizumab reduced the number of in-patient hospitalisations compared to treatment 
with placebo in RCP in both AQP4-IgG seropositive subjects (rate ratio 0.258 [95% CI: 0.0904, 0.7384]; 
p = 0.0115) and total ITT population (rate ratio 0.286 [95% CI: 0.1105, 0.7411]; p = 0.0100). 
A multiplicity adjustment performed for the analyses of the key secondary efficacy endpoints revealed 
significant results for all except for change in low-contrast visual acuity. 
Across  the  RCP  and  OLP  the  AC-determined  ARR  in  any  AQP4-IgG  seropositive  subject  treated  with 
inebilizumab was 0.13, and in any subject treated with inebilizumab was 0.126. Updated AC-determined 
ARR in the AQP4-IgG seropositive subgroup at the time of the Day 120 safety update (date of cut-off 06 
Jun 2019) was 0.118 (0.088-0.155). This shows maintenance of ARR over time in OLP. Supportively, 
survival estimate in the AQP4-IgG seropositive population at Day 197 of the RCP was 88.7%, followed 
by 85.1% on Day 365 of the OLP. 
Exploratory analysis with modified Rankin scale was supportive of EDSS findings (AQP4-IgG seropositive 
subjects who received inebilizumab were 74.2% more likely to report less disability compared to placebo 
subjects)  and  severity  of  attacks  in  AQP4-IgG  seropositive  population  were  reduced  from  45.5%  to 
33.3% major attacks with inebilizumab use.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There  are  limitations  of  the  study  design  with  potential  impact  on  favourable  effects.  The  use  of 
background  IST  while  on  trial  was  not  permitted  and  no  active  comparator  was  used.  Consequently, 
there are concerns about the potential interactions with other IST or treatments for acute management 
of attacks and amelioration of persistent symptoms, instructions for starting treatment with inebilizumab 
and switching from or to other treatments used in standard of care. As such, a dedicated subsection was 
added  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC:  “Prior  treatment  with  immunosuppressive  therapies”  where  the 
relevant information is included. Additionally, the concerns are addressed in the RMP. Additionally, the 
applicant was requested to specify in the wording of the indication (section 4.1) that inebilizumab is to 
be used as a monotherapy.  
The significant result for primary analysis of ITT group is driven by strong results from seropositive group 
which  constitutes  93%  of  ITT  population.  The  study  was  not  powered  for  assessing  the  efficacy  of 
inebilizumab in AQP4-IgG seronegative patients, the number of AQP4- IgG seronegative patients enrolled 
was too low for formal statistical testing (7% of enrolled patients, 4 in the placebo arm and 13 in the 
Inebilizumab  arm),  they  were  not  included  in  testing  hierarchy  and  they  showed  imbalances  in 
demographics and baseline disease characteristics. No attacks were observed in placebo subgroup AQP4-
IgG seronegative group, and there is no observed therapy benefit. Due to very short time frame in the 
RCP  and  possibly  different  etiological  mechanisms  involved  in  AQP4-IgG  seronegative  NMOSD,  it  is 
impossible  to  know  if  the  seronegative  patients  would  have  had  attacks  if  they  were  followed  longer 
without  inebilizumab  treatment.  Treatment  effect  in  AQP4-IgG  seronegative  patients  is  unknown. 
Consequently, the applicant was requested to narrow the indication to adult NMOSD patients with AQP4-
IgG. 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  set  as time  to  onset of  an  AC-determined  NMOSD  attack,  and  not 
investigator-confirmed attacks reflecting actual clinical practise and decision making and as advised in 
the SA (EMEA/H/SA/2664/1/2013/III). Nevertheless, all pivotal trials for inebilizumab, eculizumab and 
satralizumab used adjudicated events (relapses) for primary endpoint and the sensitivity analysis using 
investigator-determined NMOSD attack showed similar results.  
Although secondary endpoints are chosen as relevant tools in the clinic to evaluate disability or severity 
of attacks and disease activity at patient level, they are not developed or validated for NMOSD, they are 
not established methods to measure treatment effect on NMOSD and there are methodological concerns 
(e.g. missing data being imputed as attacks, timing of EDSS evaluation around attacks), high correlation 
with presence of a recent attack and uncertain independent predictive value on treatment effect from 
primary  endpoint.  The  clinical  significance  of  results  for  EDSS  and  MRI  related  endpoints  are 
questionable. 
For  the  endpoint  of  low-contrast  binocular  visual  acuity,  inebilizumab  was  nominally  better  in  the 
subgroup  with  <  2  prior  NMOSD  relapses  compared  with  ≥  2  prior  relapses  (nominal  p=0.0129; 
interaction  p=0.0019),  and  in  subjects  who  had  not  received  prior  NMOSD  medications  (nominal 
p=0.0251; interaction p=0.0090). The results should be interpreted with caution given the small number 
of subjects and the fact that low contrast visual acuity was measured binocularly while the majority of 
optic neuritis episodes in NMOSD are unilateral.  
B cell data > 28 weeks effect are missing.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The profile of inebilizumab is consistent with its mechanism of action (anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody 
leading  to  B-cell  depletion)  and  other  B-cell  depleting  therapies  (anti-CD20)  with  reported  cases  of 
infusion-related reactions, infections, neutropenia, lymphopenia and decreases in immunoglobulins. 
Urinary  tract  infection  is  a  very  common  and  respiratory  tract  infection,  infusion-related  reactions, 
arthralgia, back pain, lymphopenia and neutropenia are common adverse reactions with inebilizumab. 
ADR  reported  at  higher  proportions  (≥5%)  with  inebilizumab  than  with  placebo  were  urinary  tract 
infection (11.5% vs. 8.9%), arthralgia (9.8% vs. 3.6%) and back pain (7.5% vs. 3.6%). Patients treated 
with  inebilizumab  had  a  similar  overall  risk  of  TEAEs  and  had  proportionately  fewer  severe  and  SAEs 
compared to placebo-treated subjects. Two subjects in the inebilizumab group had a TEAE resulting in 
discontinuation of IP vs. no such subjects in the placebo group.  
During the RCP, infections overall were reported in a similar percentage of patients in both treatment 
groups  (37.9%  in  the  inebilizumab  and  41.1%  in  the  placebo  total  groups) and  patients  treated  with 
inebilizumab experienced fewer serious infections compared to placebo (1.7% vs. 3.6%). In the OLP, 
the  proportion  of  infections  was  important  in  both  placebo/inebilizumab  treated  patients  (70.6%,  36 
subjects)  and  inebilizumab/inebilizumab  treated  patients  (53.9%,  89  patients).  Among  these,  serious 
infections 
represented  17.6%  of  placebo/inebilizumab  patients 
(n=9)  and  4.8%  of 
inebilizumab/inebilizumab treated patients (n=8). Also, opportunistic infections – as per analysis based 
on  the  Opportunistic  Infection  SMQ  from  MedDRA  version  21.0  -  occurred  more  frequently  in  the 
inebilizumab/inebilizumab group compared to placebo/inebilizumab-treated subjects (10.9% vs. 5.9%).  
There  were  4  subjects  with  life-threatening  (Grade 4)  TEAEs,  all  involving  infections,  during  the  OLP, 
including one patient who subsequently died following onset of new brain lesions involving possible PML.  
By the end of the RCP, total immunoglobulins decreased by approximately 10% in subjects treated with 
inebilizumab. The decrease in immunoglobulins over time continued in the open-label extension period: 
in subjects receiving inebilizumab from the start of the RCP, the median percent change in total Ig and 
IgG levels was -12.42% and -8.88%, respectively, at OLP Week 0, declining to -40.12% and -36.12%, 
respectively,  at  OLP  Week  143.  Furthermore,  inebilizumab  was  associated  with  reduced  neutrophil 
counts. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There  is  currently  a  limited  safety  database  with  225  patients  treated  with  at  least  one  dose  of 
inebilizumab in the pivotal phase 2/3 Study 1155. As of the date of cut-off of 06 Jun2019, 177 subjects 
(162  AQP4-IgG-seropositive)  and  53  subjects  (45  AQP4-IgG-seropositive)  had  been  treated  with 
inebilizumab for ≥366 days and ≥1094 days, respectively.  
Regarding the death of the patient with probable PML, the cause of the patient’s brain lesions could not 
be established with certainty and the differential diagnosis of the patient’s brain lesions included PML, 
acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and atypical NMOSD relapse. Nevertheless, the SmPC includes a 
dedicated section for PML in section 4.4. and PML has been included in the RMP as an important potential 
risk.  
The proportion of patients with infections and opportunistic infections was similar between placebo and 
inebilizumab-treated patients during the RCP. However, the RCP was of short duration (6 months) and 
the number of patients exposed was limited. Since inebilizumab is intended for chronic administration 
and considering that neutropenia, lymphopenia and decreases in immunoglobulin (consistent with the 
mechanism  of  action  of  inebilizumab)  were  common  during  the  study,  a  risk  of  infections  (including 
opportunistic  infections)  cannot  be  excluded  for  patients  receiving  long-term  treatment.  A  dedicated 
Assessment report  
EMA/266309/2022  
Page 132/137 
 
 
 
section  has  been  included  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  and  serious  infections,  viral  reactivation  and 
opportunistic infections are included as important potential risks in the RMP.  
Given the very limited long-term safety data at current stage, the potential impact of treatment with 
inebilizumab on the development of malignancies is unknown. During the OLP, one subject had a TESAE 
of  “colon  cancer  stage  III”.  Again,  the  short  duration  of  the  study  and  limited  long-term  safety  data 
precludes a firm assessment of the risk.   A dedicated section has been included in section 4.4 of the 
SmPC and malignancy is included as important potential risks in the RMP.  
There is missing information with regard to the safety in several populations, including elderly patients 
as only 6 patients above 65 years were treated with inebilizumab, in patients concomitantly receiving 
other immunosuppressive medications and in pregnant or lactating women. Specific sections have been 
included in SmPC (section 4.2 for elderly; SmPC 4.4 for pregnancy; SmPC 4.5 concomitant use of IST) 
and all these groups are included as missing information in the RMP.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The  efficacy  package  presented  in  this  application  establish  the  effectiveness  of  inebilizumab  as 
monotherapy  for  the  treatment  of  NMOSD  in  adult patients  who  are  AQP4-IgG  seropositive.  Reduced 
(AC-adjudicated) relapse frequency for AQP4-IgG seropositive patients is a highly statistically significant 
outcome and is supported by sensitivity analyses. As relapses in patients with NMOSD can cause serious, 
permanent disability and can even be fatal, preventing relapses and reducing the frequency of relapses 
is  a  clinically  meaningful  outcome  for  patients  with  NMOSD,  which  is  supported  by  the  significant 
decrease in hospitalisation need. 
The significant result for primary analysis of ITT group is considered to be driven by strong results from 
seropositive group which constitutes 93% of ITT population.  
Background  scientific  evidence  suggests  that  pathogenic  AQP4-IgG  is  produced  by  B-lineage  cells, 
specifically  a  subpopulation  of  CD19-positive  CD20-negative  B  cells  showing  morphological  and 
phenotypical properties of plasmablasts. This is supportive evidence for efficacy of inebilizumab in AQP4-
IgG seropositive patients. Even using the most reliable assays, there are subsets of subjects who do not 
test  seropositive  for  AQP4-IgG  who  may  still  present  with  NMOSD  phenotype;  however,  different 
Assessment report  
EMA/266309/2022  
Page 134/137 
 
 
 
 
etiological mechanisms may be involved in AQP4-IgG seronegative NMOSD. Arising evidence shows that 
seronegative NMOSD might have a different pathogenic mechanism and a subset of this group, NMOSD 
phenotype with MOG-IgG, may be a distinct entity (MOG antibody disease). Due to very short time frame 
in the RCP and possibly different etiological mechanisms involved in AQP4-IgG seronegative NMOSD, it 
is difficult to know if the seronegative patients (with or without inebilizumab treatment) would have had 
more attacks if they were followed longer, but due to very heterogenous pathology and low number of 
patients evaluated this is not considered very likely. In conclusion, there was no evidence of a clinical 
benefit for AQP4-IgG seronegative patients with inebilizumab treatment. As such, the indication has been 
restricted to adult patients with NMOSD with AQP4-IgG seropositive. 
There are limitations of the study design and conduct with potential impact on favourable effects.  
First of all, the primary efficacy endpoint was set as time to onset of an AC-determined NMOSD attack, 
and not investigator-confirmed attacks reflecting actual clinical practise and decision making. This is a 
concern on its own, however, due to significant results with sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint 
for investigator or patient reported attacks, there is scientific support for reassurance. 
Secondly, the use of background IST while on trial was not permitted, rescue treatments were limited, 
and no active comparator was used. Up to 90% of patients with NMOSD have relapsing episodes. The 
monophasic NMOSD exits as clinical entity but the criteria that accurately predict long-term adherence 
to  a  monophasic  course  cannot  currently  be  defined.  So,  it  is  highly  recommended  to  start  effective 
treatments to prevent attacks as soon as the NMOSD diagnosis is reached and monoclonal treatments 
in use (such as eculizumab, satralizumab) are used as first line therapy by key experts for NMOSD. Due 
to pivotal study design and conduct, there is no experience with inebilizumab with switching from or to 
or concomitant use with other IST used in standard of care for NMOSD. Sufficient instructions should be 
provided  to  clinicians  covering  or  mitigating  these  concerns,  and  it  is  necessary  to  support  current 
evidence with long term exposure and efficacy-safety data.  
Thirdly, the secondary endpoints were chosen from relevant tools in the clinic to evaluate disability or 
severity  of  attacks  and  disease  activity  at  patient  level  but  they  are  not  developed  or  validated  for 
NMOSD,  they  are  not  established  methods  to  measure  treatment  effect  for  NMOSD  and  there  are 
methodological concerns. EDSS is highly correlated with presence of a recent attack, so even in relapsing 
multiple  sclerosis  where  EDSS  use  is  established,  disability  is  evaluated  by  3  or  preferably  6  months 
cumulative disability measures, instead of simple comparison of study end EDSS to baseline. Similarly, 
MRI has different scans for evaluating active inflammation or subacute/chronic damage, and they are 
typically  assessed  separately  with  some  measures  to  take  attack  periods  into  account.  The  clinical 
significance of results for EDSS and MRI related endpoints are questionable on their own, mainly due to 
very  high  correlation  with  attacks  and  very  short  study  period.  It  should  be  noted  that  exploratory 
endpoints  such  as  mRS,  attack  severity,  attack  recovery,  and  decrease  in  number  of  attacks  under 
treatment despite presence of active inflammation in MRI are supportive of the primary outcome of the 
study. The results for hospitalisation, modified Rankin scale, attack recovery could also be considered as 
supportive  of  positive  functional  clinical  outcome  despite  lack  of  significant  direct  measures  of 
functionality or quality of life. The results from the binocular low contrast visual acuity are difficult to 
interpreted as discussed above.  
There are serious identified and potential risks with inebilizumab therapy which appear to be manageable 
with  labeling  and  monitoring.  Some  of  the  most  common  AEs  related  to  pain  were  noted  in  another 
NMOSD development programme and raise the possibility of a non-specific effect of effective therapies 
of unclear significance and aetiology. Otherwise, the identified risks are consistent with other approved 
therapies  that  deplete  B-cells  used  in  other  indications  such  as  multiple  sclerosis  and  haematologic 
malignancies.  A  long-term  safety  study  with  inebilizumab,  in  order  to  monitor  immunoglobulins  and 
evaluate the risk of adverse events within the Infections and infestations SOC, is warranted and it has

been included in the RMP. Need for monitoring of the level of immunoglobulins at the beginning, during, 
and after discontinuation of inebilizumab until B-cell repletion as well as median time to B-cell repletion 
have been implemented in the SmPC. Although two deaths that occurred in the pivotal study were not 
clearly directly attributable to therapy, PML was included in the differential diagnosis for one of the cases 
with inconclusive results. Due to exclusion criteria, mechanism of action for inebilizumab and observed 
safety  profile,  severe  active  infection  including  active  chronic  infections  such  as  hepatitis  B  and 
tuberculosis,  history  of  PML  and  severely  immunocompromised  state  are  added  to  the  SmPC’s  list  of 
contraindications. The overall safety profile of inebilizumab is acceptable for the treatment of NMOSD, a 
serious, disabling, potentially fatal disease.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
A clinically relevant effect on the reduction of attacks has been well demonstrated in a study population 
consisting mainly of AQP4-IgG seropositive adult patients. Overall, from the analysis of safety data, no 
major safety issues were reported for inebilizumab in NMOSD patients. The safety profile of inebilizumab 
was consistent with its mechanism of action, in line with known anti-CD20 therapies and the identified 
risks could be manageable. The balance of benefits and risks in the proposed indication is positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
N/A 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The  overall  benefit/risk  balance  of  Uplizna  is  positive,  subject  to  the  conditions  stated  in  section 
‘Recommendations’ 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that inebilizumab is not similar to eculizumab and satralizumab 
within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000. See Appendix on Similarity. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of Uplizna is favourable in the following indication(s): 
Uplizna is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with neuromyelitis optica 
spectrum  disorders  (NMOSD)  who  are  anti-aquaporin-4  immunoglobulin  G  (AQP4-IgG) 
seropositive (see section 5.1). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription.

Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
•  Periodic Safety Update Reports 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
•  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency. 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result 
of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
•  Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to launch of Uplizna in each Member State, the MAH must agree about the content and format of 
the  educational  programme,  including  communication  media,  distribution  modalities,  and  any  other 
aspects of the programme, with the National Competent Authority.   
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where Uplizna is marketed, all healthcare professionals 
and patients/carers who are expected to prescribe and use Uplizna have access to/are provided with the 
following educational package:  
 - A patient card 
The patient card shall contain the following key messages: 
o  What is inebilizumab and how does it work  
o  What is neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD)  
o  Information  that  inebilizumab  treatment  may  increase  the  risk  of  serious  infections,  viral 
reactivation, opportunistic infections, and PML  
o  A warning message on seeking early medical care in case of signs and symptoms of infection 
and PML  
o  A warning message for healthcare professionals treating the patient at any time, including in 
conditions of emergency that the patient is receiving inebilizumab  
o  Contact details of treating physician/centre  
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
to be implemented by the Member States 
Not applicable. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that inebilizumab is to be qualified 
as a new active substance in itself as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised 
within the European Union.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) 
CABOMETYX is indicated as monotherapy for advanced renal cell carcinoma 
- as first-line treatment of adult patients with intermediate or poor risk (see section 5.1), 
- in adults following prior vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy (see 
section 5.1). 
CABOMETYX, in combination with nivolumab, is indicated for the first-line treatment of advanced 
renal cell carcinoma in adults (see section 5.1). 
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
CABOMETYX is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in 
adults who have previously been treated with sorafenib. 
Differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) 
CABOMETYX is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced 
or metastatic differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC), refractory or not eligible to radioactive iodine 
(RAI) who have progressed during or after prior systemic therapy. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Therapy with CABOMETYX should be initiated by a physician experienced in the administration of 
anticancer medicinal products.  
Posology 
CABOMETYX tablets and cabozantinib capsules are not bioequivalent and should not be used 
interchangeably (see section 5.2).  
CABOMETYX as monotherapy 
For RCC, HCC and DTC, the recommended dose of CABOMETYX is 60 mg once daily.  
Treatment should continue until the patient is no longer clinically benefiting from therapy or until 
unacceptable toxicity occurs. 
CABOMETYX in combination with nivolumab in first-line advanced RCC 
The recommended dose of CABOMETYX is 40 mg once daily in combination with nivolumab 
administered intravenously at either 240 mg every 2 weeks or 480 mg every 4 weeks. The treatment 
should continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Nivolumab should be continued 
until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease 
progression (see the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for posology of nivolumab). 
Treatment modification 
Management of suspected adverse drug reactions may require temporary treatment interruption and/or 
dose reduction (see Table 1). When dose reduction is necessary in monotherapy, it is recommended to 
reduce to 40 mg daily, and then to 20 mg daily.  
When CABOMETYX is administered in combination with nivolumab, it is recommended to reduce 
the dose to 20 mg of CABOMETYX once daily, and then to 20 mg every other day (refer to the 
nivolumab SmPC for recommended treatment modification for nivolumab). 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dose interruptions are recommended for management of CTCAE grade 3 or greater toxicities or 
intolerable grade 2 toxicities. Dose reductions are recommended for events that, if persistent, could 
become serious or intolerable. 
If a patient misses a dose, the missed dose should not be taken if it is less than 12 hours before the 
next dose.

Concomitant medicinal products 
Concomitant medicinal products that are strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be used with caution, 
and chronic use of concomitant medicinal products that are strong inducers of CYP3A4 should be 
avoided (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Selection of an alternative concomitant medicinal product with no or minimal potential to induce or 
inhibit CYP3A4 should be considered. 
Special populations 
Elderly  
No specific dose adjustment for the use of cabozantinib in elderly patients (≥ 65 years) is 
recommended.  
Race 
No dose adjustment is necessary based on ethnicity (see section 5.2)  
Renal impairment  
Cabozantinib should be used with caution in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.  
Cabozantinib is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment as safety and 
efficacy have not been established in this population. 
Hepatic impairment 
In patients with mild hepatic impairment no dose adjustment is required. Since only limited data are 
available for patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B), no dosing recommendation 
can be provided. Close monitoring of overall safety is recommended in these patients (see sections 4.4 
and 5.2). There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C), so 
cabozantinib is not recommended for use in these patients (see section 5.2). 
Cardiac impairment 
There are limited data in patients with cardiac impairment. No specific dosing recommendations can 
be made. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of cabozantinib in children and adolescents aged <18 years have not yet been 
established. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation 
on a posology can be made. 
Method of administration 
CABOMETYX is for oral use. The tablets should be swallowed whole and not crushed. Patients 
should be instructed to not eat anything for at least 2 hours before through 1 hour after taking 
CABOMETYX. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
As most adverse reactions occur early in the course of treatment, the physician should evaluate the 
patient closely during the first eight weeks of treatment to determine if dose modifications are 
warranted. Adverse reactions that generally have early onset include hypocalcaemia, hypokalaemia, 
thrombocytopenia, hypertension, palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (PPES), proteinuria, 
and gastrointestinal (GI) events (abdominal pain, mucosal inflammation, constipation, diarrhoea, 
vomiting).  
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Management of suspected adverse reactions may require temporary interruption or dose reduction of 
cabozantinib therapy (see section 4.2): 
In renal cell carcinoma following prior vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy, 
dose reductions and dose interruptions due to an adverse event (AE) occurred in 59.8% and 70%, 
respectively, of cabozantinib-treated patients in the pivotal clinical trial (METEOR). Two dose 
reductions were required in 19.3% of patients. The median time to first dose reduction was 55 days, 
and to first dose interruption was 38 days. 
In treatment-naïve renal cell carcinoma, dose reductions and dose interruptions occurred in 46% and 
73%, respectively, of cabozantinib-treated patients in the clinical trial (CABOSUN). 
When cabozantinib is given in combination with nivolumab in first-line advanced renal cell 
carcinoma, dose reduction and dose interruption of cabozantinib due to an AE occurred in 54.1% and 
73.4% of patients in the clinical trial (CA2099ER). Two dose reductions were required in 9.4% of 
patients. The median time to first dose reduction was 106 days, and to first dose interruption was 68 
days. 
In hepatocellular carcinoma following prior systemic therapy, dose reductions and dose interruptions 
occurred in 62% and 84%, respectively, of cabozantinib-treated patients in the clinical trial 
(CELESTIAL). Two dose reductions were required in 33% of patients. The median time to first dose 
reduction was 38 days, and to first dose interruption was 28 days. Closer monitoring is advised in 
patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment.  
In differentiated thyroid carcinoma, dose reductions and dose interruptions occurred in 67% and 71% 
respectively of cabozantinib treated patients in the clinical trial (COSMIC-311). Two dose reductions 
were required in 33% of patients. The median time to first dose reduction was 57 days and to first 
dose interruption was 38.5 days.  
Hepatotoxicity 
Abnormalities of liver function tests (increases in alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate 
aminotransferase [AST] and bilirubin) have been frequently observed in patients treated with 
cabozantinib. It is recommended to perform liver function tests (ALT, AST and bilirubin) before 
initiation of cabozantinib treatment and to monitor closely during treatment. For patients with 
worsening of liver function tests considered related to cabozantinib treatment (i.e. where no 
alternative cause is evident), the dose modification advice in Table 1 should be followed (see section 
4.2). 
When cabozantinib is given in combination with nivolumab, higher frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 
ALT and AST elevations have been reported relative to cabozantinib monotherapy in patients with 
advanced RCC (see section 4.8). Liver enzymes should be monitored before initiation of and 
periodically throughout treatment. Medical management guidelines for both medicines should be 
followed (see section 4.2 and refer to the SmPC for nivolumab). 
Rare instances of vanishing bile duct syndrome have been reported. All cases have occurred in 
patients who have received immune checkpoint inhibitors, either before or concurrently with 
cabozantinib treatment. 
Cabozantinib is eliminated mainly via the hepatic route. Closer monitoring of the overall safety is 
recommended in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (see also sections 4.2 and 5.2). A 
higher relative proportion of patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) developed 
hepatic encephalopathy with cabozantinib treatment. Cabozantinib is not recommended for use in 
patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C, see section 4.2).  
Hepatic encephalopathy 
In the HCC study (CELESTIAL), hepatic encephalopathy was reported more frequently in the 
cabozantinib than the placebo arm. Cabozantinib has been associated with diarrhoea, vomiting, 
decreased appetite and electrolyte abnormalities. In HCC patients with compromised livers, these 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
non-hepatic effects may be precipitating factors for the development of hepatic encephalopathy. 
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy. 
Perforations and fistulas  
Serious GI perforations and fistulas, sometimes fatal, have been observed with cabozantinib. Patients 
who have inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, peritonitis, 
diverticulitis, or appendicitis), have tumour infiltration in the GI tract, or have complications from 
prior GI surgery (particularly when associated with delayed or incomplete healing) should be 
carefully evaluated before initiating cabozantinib therapy and subsequently they should be monitored 
closely for symptoms of perforations and fistulas including abscesses and sepsis. Persistent or 
recurring diarrhoea while on treatment may be a risk factor for the development of anal fistula. 
Cabozantinib should be discontinued in patients who experience a GI perforation or a fistula that 
cannot be adequately managed. 
Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders  
Diarrhoea, nausea/vomiting, decreased appetite, and stomatitis/oral pain were some of the most 
commonly reported GI events (see section 4.8). Prompt medical management, including supportive 
care with antiemetics, antidiarrhoeals, or antacids, should be instituted to prevent dehydration, 
electrolyte imbalances and weight loss. Dose interruption or reduction, or permanent discontinuation 
of cabozantinib should be considered in case of persistent or recurrent significant GI adverse reactions 
(see Table 1). 
Thromboembolic events 
Events of venous thromboembolism, including pulmonary embolism, and arterial thromboembolism, 
sometimes fatal, have been observed with cabozantinib. Cabozantinib should be used with caution in 
patients who are at risk for, or who have a history of, these events.  
In the HCC study (CELESTIAL), portal vein thrombosis was observed with cabozantinib, including 
one fatal event. Patients with a history of portal vein invasion appeared to be at higher risk of 
developing portal vein thrombosis.  Cabozantinib should be discontinued in patients who develop an 
acute myocardial infarction or any other clinically significant thromboembolic complication. 
Haemorrhage 
Severe haemorrhage, sometimes fatal, has been observed with cabozantinib. Patients who have a 
history of severe bleeding prior to treatment initiation should be carefully evaluated before initiating 
cabozantinib therapy. Cabozantinib should not be administered to patients that have or are at risk for 
severe haemorrhage. 
In the HCC study (CELESTIAL), fatal haemorrhagic events were reported at a higher incidence with 
cabozantinib than placebo. Predisposing risk factors for severe haemorrhage in the advanced HCC 
population may include tumour invasion of major blood vessels and the presence of underlying liver 
cirrhosis resulting in oesophageal varices, portal hypertension, and thrombocytopenia. The 
CELESTIAL study excluded patients with concomitant anticoagulation treatment or antiplatelet 
agents. Subjects with untreated, or incompletely treated, varices with bleeding or high risk for 
bleeding were also excluded from this study.  
The study of cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab in first-line advanced RCC (CA2099ER) 
excluded patients with anticoagulants at therapeutic doses. 
Aneurysms and artery dissections 
The use of VEGF pathway inhibitors in patients with or without hypertension may promote the 
formation of aneurysms and/or artery dissections. Before initiating cabozantinib, this risk should be 
carefully considered in patients with risk factors such as hypertension or history of aneurysm. 
Thrombocytopenia 
In the HCC study (CELESTIAL) and in the DTC study (COSMIC-311), thrombocytopenia and 
decreased platelets were reported. Platelet levels should be monitored during cabozantinib treatment 
and the dose modified according to the severity of the thrombocytopenia (see Table 1). 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Wound complications 
Wound complications have been observed with cabozantinib. Cabozantinib treatment should be 
stopped at least 28 days prior to scheduled surgery, including dental surgery or invasive dental 
procedures, if possible. The decision to resume cabozantinib therapy after surgery should be based on 
clinical judgment of adequate wound healing. Cabozantinib should be discontinued in patients with 
wound healing complications requiring medical intervention. 
Hypertension 
Hypertension, including hypertensive crisis has been observed with cabozantinib. Blood pressure 
should be well-controlled prior to initiating cabozantinib.After cabozantinib initiation, blood pressure 
should be monitored early and regularly and treated as needed with appropriate antihypertensive 
therapy. In the case of persistent hypertension despite use of anti-hypertensives, the cabozantinib 
treatment should be interrupted until blood pressure is controlled, after which cabozantinib can be 
resumed at a reduced dose. Cabozantinib should be discontinued if hypertension is severe and 
persistent despite anti-hypertensive therapy and dose reduction of cabozantinib. In case of 
hypertensive crisis, cabozantinib should be discontinued. 
Osteonecrosis 
Events of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) have been observed with cabozantinib. An oral examination 
should be performed prior to initiation of cabozantinib and periodically during cabozantinib therapy. 
Patients should be advised regarding oral hygiene practice. Cabozantinib treatment should be held at 
least 28 days prior to scheduled dental surgery or invasive dental procedures, if possible. Caution 
should be used in patients receiving agents associated with ONJ, such as bisphosphonates. 
Cabozantinib should be discontinued in patients who experience ONJ. 
Palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome  
Palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (PPES) has been observed with cabozantinib. When 
PPES is severe, interruption of treatment with cabozantinib should be considered. Cabozantinib 
should be restarted with a lower dose when PPES has been resolved to grade 1. 
Proteinuria 
Proteinuria has been observed with cabozantinib. Urine protein should be monitored regularly during 
cabozantinib treatment. Cabozantinib should be discontinued in patients who develop nephrotic 
syndrome. 
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome  
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been observed with cabozantinib. This 
syndrome should be considered in any patient presenting with multiple symptoms, including seizures, 
headache, visual disturbances, confusion or altered mental function. Cabozantinib treatment should be 
discontinued in patients with PRES. 
Prolongation of QT interval  
Cabozantinib should be used with caution in patients with a history of QT interval prolongation, 
patients who are taking antiarrhythmics, or patients with relevant pre-existing cardiac disease, 
bradycardia, or electrolyte disturbances. When using cabozantinib, periodic monitoring with 
on-treatment ECGs and electrolytes (serum calcium, potassium, and magnesium) should be 
considered.  
Thyroid dysfunction 
Baseline laboratory measurement of thyroid function is recommended in all patients. Patients with 
pre-existing hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism should be treated as per standard medical practice 
prior to the start of cabozantinib treatment. All patients should be observed closely for signs and 
symptoms of thyroid dysfunction during cabozantinib treatment. Thyroid function should be 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
monitored periodically throughout treatment with cabozantinib. Patients who develop thyroid 
dysfunction should be treated as per standard medical practice.  
Biochemical laboratory test abnormalities 
Cabozantinib has been associated with an increased incidence of electrolyte abnormalities (including 
hypo- and hyperkalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, hypocalcaemia, hyponatremia). Hypocalcaemia has 
been observed with cabozantinib at a higher frequency and/or increased severity (including Grade 3 
and 4) in patients with thyroid cancer compared to patients with other cancers. It is recommended to 
monitor biochemical parameters during cabozantinib treatment and to institute appropriate 
replacement therapy according to standard clinical practice if required. Cases of hepatic 
encephalopathy in HCC patients can be attributed to the development of electrolyte disturbances. 
Dose interruption or reduction, or permanent discontinuation of cabozantinib should be considered in 
case of persistent or recurrent significant abnormalities (see Table 1). 
CYP3A4 inducers and inhibitors 
Cabozantinib is a CYP3A4 substrate. Concurrent administration of cabozantinib with the strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole resulted in an increase in cabozantinib plasma exposure. Caution is 
required when administering cabozantinib with agents that are strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. Concurrent 
administration of cabozantinib with the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin resulted in a decrease in 
cabozantinib plasma exposure. Therefore, chronic administration of agents that are strong CYP3A4 
inducers with cabozantinib should be avoided (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). 
P-glycoprotein substrates  
Cabozantinib was an inhibitor (IC50 = 7.0 μM), but not a substrate, of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transport 
activities in a bi-directional assay system using MDCK-MDR1 cells. Therefore, cabozantinib may 
have the potential to increase plasma concentrations of co-administered substrates of P-gp. Subjects 
should be cautioned regarding taking a P-gp substrate (e.g., fexofenadine, aliskiren, ambrisentan, 
dabigatran etexilate, digoxin, colchicine, maraviroc, posaconazole, ranolazine, saxagliptin, sitagliptin, 
talinolol, tolvaptan) while receiving cabozantinib (see section 4.5). 
MRP2 inhibitors 
Administration of MRP2 inhibitors may result in increases in cabozantinib plasma concentrations. 
Therefore, concomitant use of MRP2 inhibitors (e.g. cyclosporine, efavirenz, emtricitabine) should be 
approached with caution (see section 4.5). 
Excipient 
Lactose 
Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or 
glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
“sodium-free”. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Effect of other medicinal products on cabozantinib 
CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers 
Administration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg daily for 27 days) to healthy 
volunteers decreased cabozantinib clearance (by 29%) and increased single-dose plasma cabozantinib 
exposure (AUC) by 38%. Therefore, co-administration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, 
itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, grapefruit juice) with cabozantinib should be approached 
with caution.  
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Administration of the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin (600 mg daily for 31 days) to healthy 
volunteers increased cabozantinib clearance (4.3-fold) and decreased single-dose plasma cabozantinib 
exposure (AUC) by 77%. Chronic co-administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, 
carbamazepine, rifampicin, phenobarbital or herbal preparations containing St. John’s Wort 
[Hypericum perforatum]) with cabozantinib should therefore be avoided.  
Gastric pH modifying agents 
Co-administration of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) esomeprazole (40 mg daily for 6 days) with a single 
dose of 100 mg cabozantinib to healthy volunteers resulted in no clinically-significant effect on 
plasma cabozantinib exposure (AUC). No dose adjustment is indicated when gastric pH modifying 
agents (i.e., PPIs, H2 receptor antagonists, and antacids) are co-administered with cabozantinib. 
MRP2 inhibitors 
In vitro data demonstrate that cabozantinib is a substrate of MRP2. Therefore, administration of 
MRP2 inhibitors may result in increases in cabozantinib plasma concentrations.  
Bile salt-sequestering agents 
Bile salt-sequestering agents such as cholestyramine and cholestagel may interact with cabozantinib 
and may impact absorption (or reabsorption) resulting in potentially decreased exposure (see section 
5.2). The clinical significance of these potential interactions is unknown. 
Effect of cabozantinib on other medicinal products 
The effect of cabozantinib on the pharmacokinetics of contraceptive steroids has not been 
investigated. As unchanged contraceptive effect may not be guaranteed, an additional contraceptive 
method, such as a barrier method, is recommended. 
The effect of cabozantinib on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin has not been investigated. An 
interaction with warfarin may be possible. In case of such combination, INR values should be 
monitored. 
P-glycoprotein substrates  
Cabozantinib was an inhibitor (IC50 = 7.0 μM), but not a substrate, of P-gp transport activities in a 
bi-directional assay system using MDCK-MDR1 cells. Therefore, cabozantinib may have the 
potential to increase plasma concentrations of co-administered substrates of P-gp. Subjects should be 
cautioned regarding taking a P-gp substrate (e.g., fexofenadine, aliskiren, ambrisentan, dabigatran 
etexilate, digoxin, colchicine, maraviroc, posaconazole, ranolazine, saxagliptin, sitagliptin, talinolol, 
tolvaptan) while receiving cabozantinib. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females 
Women of childbearing potential must be advised to avoid pregnancy while on cabozantinib. Female 
partners of male patients taking cabozantinib must also avoid pregnancy. Effective methods of 
contraception should be used by male and female patients and their partners during therapy, and for at 
least 4 months after completing therapy. Because oral contraceptives might possibly not be considered 
as “effective methods of contraception”, they should be used together with another method, such as a 
barrier method (see section 4.5). 
Pregnancy 
There are no studies in pregnant women using cabozantinib. Studies in animals have shown 
embryo-foetal and teratogenic effects (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. 
Cabozantinib should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires 
treatment with cabozantinib. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether cabozantinib and/or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because of 
the potential harm to the infant, mothers should discontinue breast-feeding during treatment with 
cabozantinib, and for at least 4 months after completing therapy. 
Fertility 
There are no data on human fertility. Based on non-clinical safety findings, male and female fertility 
may be compromised by treatment with cabozantinib (see section 5.3). Both men and women should 
be advised to seek advice and consider fertility preservation before treatment. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Cabozantinib has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Adverse reactions such as 
fatigue and weakness have been associated with cabozantinib. Therefore, caution should be 
recommended when driving or operating machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects

Cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab in first-line advanced RCC 
Summary of safety profile 
When cabozantinib is administered in combination with nivolumab, refer to the SmPC for nivolumab 
prior to initiation of treatment. For additional information on the safety profile of nivolumab 
monotherapy, please refer to the nivolumab SmPC. 
In a dataset of cabozantinib 40 mg once daily in combination with nivolumab 240 mg every two 
weeks in RCC (n =320), with a minimum follow‑up of 16 months, the most common serious adverse 
drug reactions (≥1% incidence) are diarrhoea, pneumonitis, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, 
hyponatremia, pyrexia, adrenal insufficiency, vomiting, dehydration.  
The most frequent adverse reactions (≥25%) were diarrhoea, fatigue, palmar-plantar 
erythrodysaesthesia syndrome, stomatitis, musculoskeletal pain, hypertension, rash, hypothyroidism, 
decrease appetite, nausea, abdominal pain. The majority of adverse reactions were mild to moderate 
(Grade 1 or 2).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Data for the following reactions are based on patients who received CABOMETYX 60 mg orally 
once daily as monotherapy in the pivotal studies in RCC following prior VEGF-targeted therapy and 
in treatment-naïve RCC, in HCC following prior systemic therapy and in DTC in patient refractory or 
not eligible to radioactive iodine (RAI) who have progressed during or after prior systemic therapy or 
in patients who received CABOMETYX 40 mg orally once daily in combination with nivolumab in 
first-line advanced RCC (section 5.1).  
Gastrointestinal (GI) perforation (see section 4.4) 
In the study in RCC following prior VEGF-targeted therapy (METEOR), GI perforations were 
reported in 0.9% (3/331) of cabozantinib-treated RCC patients. Events were Grade 2 or 3. Median 
time to onset was 10.0 weeks.  
In the treatment-naïve RCC study (CABOSUN), GI perforations were reported in 2.6% (2/78) of 
cabozantinib-treated patients. Events were Grade 4 and 5. 
In the HCC study (CELESTIAL), GI perforations were reported in 0.9% of cabozantinib-treated 
patients (4/467). All events were Grade 3 or 4. Median time to onset was 5.9 weeks. 
In the DTC study (COSMIC-311), GI perforation grade 4 was reported in one patient (0.6%) of 
cabozantinib-treated patients and occurred after 14 weeks of treatment. 
In combination with nivolumab in advanced RCC in first-line treatment (CA2099ER) the incidence of 
GI perforations was 1.3% (4/320) treated patients. One event was grade 3, two events were grade 4 
and one event was grade 5 (fatal). 
Fatal perforations have occurred in the cabozantinib clinical program. 
Hepatic encephalopathy (see section 4.4) 
In the HCC study (CELESTIAL), hepatic encephalopathy (hepatic encephalopathy, encephalopathy, 
hyperammonaemic encephalopathy) was reported in 5.6% of cabozantinib-treated patients (26/467); 
Grade 3-4 events in 2.8%, and one (0.2%) Grade 5 event. Median time to onset was 5.9 weeks. 
No cases of hepatic encephalopathy were reported in the RCC studies (METEOR, CABOSUN and 
CA2099ER) and in the DTC study (COSMIC-311). 
15 
 
 
 
 
Diarrhoea (see section 4.4) 
In the study in RCC following prior VEGF-targeted therapy (METEOR), diarrhoea was reported in 
74% of cabozantinib-treated RCC patients (245/331); Grade 3-4 events in 11%. Median time to onset 
was 4.9 weeks.  
In the treatment-naïve RCC study (CABOSUN), diarrhoea was reported in 73% of cabozantinib-
treated patients (57/78); Grade 3-4 events in 10%.  
In the HCC study (CELESTIAL), diarrhoea was reported in 54% of cabozantinib-treated patients 
(251/467); Grade 3- 4 events in 9.9%. Median time to onset of all events was 4.1 weeks. Diarrhoea 
led to dose modifications, interruptions and discontinuations in 84/467 (18%), 69/467 (15%) and 
5/467 (1%) of subjects, respectively. 
In the DTC study (COSMIC-311), diarrhoea was reported in 62% of cabozantinib treated patients 
(105/170); Grade 3-4 events in 7.6%. Diarrhoea led to dose reduction and interruption in 24/170 
(14%) and 36/170 (21%) of subjects respectively. 
In combination with nivolumab in advanced RCC in first-line treatment (CA2099ER), the incidence 
of diarrhoea was reported in 64.7% (207/320) of treated patients; Grade 3-4 events in 8.4% (27/320). 
Median time to onset of all events was 12.9 weeks. Dose delay or reduction occurred in 26.3% 
(84/320) and discontinuation in 2.2% (7/320) of patients with diarrhoea, respectively. 
Fistulas (see section 4.4) 
In the study in RCC following prior VEGF-targeted therapy (METEOR), fistulas were reported in 
1.2% (4/331) of cabozantinib-treated patients and included anal fistulas in 0.6% (2/331) cabozantinib-
treated patients. One event was Grade 3; the remainder were Grade 2. Median time to onset was 30.3 
weeks. 
In the treatment-naïve RCC study (CABOSUN), no cases of fistulas were reported. 
In the HCC study (CELESTIAL), fistulas were reported in 1.5% (7/467) of the HCC patients. Median 
time to onset was 14 weeks.  
In the DTC study (COSMIC-311), fistulas (two anal and one pharyngeal fistula) were reported in 1.8 
% (3/170) of the cabozantinib treated patients. 
In combination with nivolumab in advanced RCC in first-line treatment (CA2099ER) the incidence of 
fistula was reported in 0.9% (3/320) of treated patients and the severity was Grade 1.  
Fatal fistulas have occurred in the cabozantinib clinical program 
Haemorrhage (see section 4.4) 
In the study in RCC following prior VEGF-targeted therapy (METEOR), the incidence of severe 
haemorrhagic events (Grade ≥ 3) was 2.1% (7/331) in cabozantinib-treated RCC patients. Median 
time to onset was 20.9 weeks.  
In the treatment-naïve RCC study (CABOSUN), the incidence of severe haemorrhagic events (Grade 
≥ 3) was 5.1% (4/78) in cabozantinib-treated RCC patients. 
In the HCC study (CELESTIAL), the incidence of severe haemorrhagic events (Grade ≥ 3) was 7.3% 
in cabozantinib-treated patients (34/467). Median time to onset was 9.1 weeks.  
In combination with nivolumab in advanced RCC in first-line treatment (CA2099ER) the incidence of 
≥ Grade 3 haemorrhage was in 1.9% (6/320) of treated patients. 
In the DTC study (COSMIC-311), the incidence of severe haemorrhagic events (grade ≥ 3) was 2.4% 
in cabozantinib-treated patients (4/170). Median time to onset was 80.5 days.  
Fatal haemorrhages have occurred in the cabozantinib clinical program.  
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) (see section 4.4) 
No case of PRES was reported in the METEOR, CABOSUN, CA2099ER or CELESTIAL studies, 
but PRES has been reported in one patient in the DTC study (COSMIC-311) and rarely in other 
clinical trials (in 2/4872 subjects; 0.04%).  
Elevated liver enzymes when cabozantinib is combined with nivolumab in RCC 
In a clinical study of previously untreated patients with RCC receiving cabozantinib in combination 
with nivolumab, a higher incidence of Grades 3 and 4 ALT increased (10.1%) and AST increased 
(8.2%) were observed relative to cabozantinib monotherapy in patients with advanced RCC (ALT 
16 
 
 
 
 
increased of 3.6% and AST increased of 3.3% in METEOR study). The median time to onset of grade 
> 2 increased ALT or AST was 10.1 weeks (range: 2 to 106.6 weeks; n=85). In patients with grade ≥ 
2 increased ALT or AST, the elevations resolved to Grades 0-1in 91% with median time to resolution 
of 2.29 weeks (range: 0.4 to 108.1 weeks).  
Among the 45 patients with Grade ≥2 increased ALT or AST who were rechallenged with either 
cabozantinib (n=10) or nivolumab (n=10) administered as a single agent or with both (n=25), 
recurrence of Grade ≥2 increased ALT or AST was observed in 4 patients receiving cabozantinib, 
in 3 patients receiving nivolumab and 8 patients receiving both cabozantinib and nivolumab. 
Hypothyroidism  
In the study in RCC following prior VEGF-targeted therapy (METEOR), the incidence of 
hypothyroidism was 21% (68/331).  
In the treatment-naïve RCC study (CABOSUN), the incidence of hypothyroidism was 23% (18/78) in 
cabozantinib-treated RCC patients. 
In the HCC study (CELESTIAL), the incidence of hypothyroidism was 8.1% (38/467) in 
cabozantinib-treated patients and Grade 3 events in 0.4% (2/467).  
In the DTC study (COSMIC-311), the incidence of hypothyroidism was 2.4% (4/170), all grade 1-2, 
none requiring modification of treatment. 
In combination with nivolumab in advanced RCC in first-line treatment (CA2099ER) the incidence of 
hypothyroidism was 35.6% (114/320) of treated patients.  
Paediatric population (see section 5.1) 
In study ADVL1211, a limited dose-escalation study of cabozantinib in paediatric and adolescent 
patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors including CNS tumors, the following events: 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased (very common, 76.9%), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
increased (very common, 71.8%), lymphocyte count decreased (very common, 48.7%), neutrophil 
count decreased (very common, 35.9%), and lipase increased (very common, 33.3%) were observed 
at a higher frequency in all subjects across all dose groups included in the safety population (N=39), 
compared to adults. The increased rates for these Preferred Terms (PTs) concern any grade as well as 
grade 3/4 of these ADRs. The adverse events reported are in line qualitatively with the recognised 
safety profile for cabozantinib in adult populations. However, the small numbers of subjects preclude 
a conclusive assessment of trends and frequencies and further comparison with the recognised safety 
profile of cabozantinib. 
In study ADVL1622 of cabozantinib in children and young adults with the following solid tumor 
strata: Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas (NRSTS), 
osteosarcoma, Wilms tumor and other rare solid tumors (nonstatistical cohort), the safety profile of 
cabozantinib treated children and young adults in all strata was comparable with that observed in 
adults treated with cabozantinib. 
Physeal widening has been observed in children with open growth plates when treated with 
cabozantinib. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9 
 Overdose 
There is no specific treatment for cabozantinib overdose and possible symptoms of overdose have not 
been established. 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the event of suspected overdose, cabozantinib should be withheld and supportive care instituted. 
Metabolic clinical laboratory parameters should be monitored at least weekly or as deemed clinically 
appropriate to assess any possible changing trends. Adverse reactions associated with overdose are to 
be treated symptomatically. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agent, protein kinase inhibitor, ATC code: L01EX07. 
Mechanism of action 
Cabozantinib is a small molecule that inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) implicated in 
tumour growth and angiogenesis, pathologic bone remodelling, drug resistance, and metastatic 
progression of cancer. Cabozantinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of 
kinases and was identified as an inhibitor of MET (hepatocyte growth factor receptor protein) and 
VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) receptors. In addition, cabozantinib inhibits other tyrosine 
kinases including the GAS6 receptor (AXL), RET, ROS1, TYRO3, MER, the stem cell factor 
receptor (KIT), TRKB, Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), and TIE-2. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Cabozantinib exhibited dose-related tumour growth inhibition, tumour regression, and/or inhibited 
metastasis in a broad range of preclinical tumour models. 
Cardiac electrophysiology 
An increase from baseline in corrected QT interval by Fridericia (QTcF) of 10 – 15 ms on Day 29 
(but not on day 1) following initiation of cabozantinib treatment (at a dose of 140 mg once daily) was 
observed in a controlled clinical trial in medullary thyroid cancer patients. This effect was not 
associated with a change in cardiac wave form morphology or new rhythms. No cabozantinib-treated 
subjects in this study had a confirmed QTcF >500 ms, nor did any cabozantinib-treated subjects in the 
RCC or HCC studies (at a dose of 60 mg). 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Renal cell carcinoma  
Randomized study in RCC patients who have received prior vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF)-targeted therapy (METEOR) 
The safety and efficacy of CABOMETYX for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma following prior 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy were evaluated in a randomized, open-
label, multicenter phase 3 study (METEOR). Patients (N=658) with advanced RCC with a clear cell 
component who had previously received at least 1 prior VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
(VEGFR TKI) were randomized (1:1) to receive cabozantinib (N=330) or everolimus (N=328). 
Patients could have received other prior therapies, including cytokines, and antibodies targeting 
VEGF, the programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor, or its ligands. Patients with treated brain metastases 
were allowed. Progression-free survival (PFS) was assessed by a blinded independent radiology 
review committee, and the primary analysis was conducted among the first 375 subjects randomized. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS). Tumour 
assessments were conducted every 8 weeks for the first 12 months, then every 12 weeks thereafter. 
The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were similar between the cabozantinib and 
everolimus arms. The majority of the patients were male (75%), with a median age of 62 years. 
Seventy-one percent (71%) received only one prior VEGFR TKI; 41% of patients received sunitinib 
as their only prior VEGFR TKI. According to the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center criteria 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for prognostic risk category, 46% were favourable (0 risk factors), 42% were intermediate (1 risk 
factor), and 13% were poor (2 or 3 risk factors). Fifty-four percent (54%) of patients had 3 or more 
organs with metastatic disease, including lung (63%), lymph nodes (62%), liver (29%), and bone 
(22%). The median duration of treatment was 7.6 months (range 0.3 – 20.5) for patients receiving 
cabozantinib and 4.4 months (range 0.21 – 18.9) for patients receiving everolimus. 
A statistically significant improvement in PFS was demonstrated for cabozantinib compared to 
everolimus (Figure 1 and Table 4). A planned interim analysis of OS was conducted at the time of the 
PFS analysis and did not reach the interim boundary for statistical significance (202 events, HR=0.68 
[0.51, 0.90], p=0.006). In a subsequent unplanned interim analysis of OS, a statistically significant 
improvement was demonstrated for patients randomized to cabozantinib as compared with everolimus 
(320 events, median of 21.4 months vs. 16.5 months; HR=0.66 [0.53, 0.83], p=0.0003; Figure 2). 
Comparable results for OS were observed with a follow-up analysis (descriptive) at 430 events. 
Exploratory analyses of PFS and OS in the ITT population have also shown consistent results in 
favour of cabozantinib compared to everolimus across different subgroups according to age (<65 vs. 
≥65, sex, MSKCC risk group (favourable, intermediate, poor), ECOG status (0 vs. 1), time from 
diagnosis to randomisation (<1 year vs. ≥1 year), tumour MET status (high vs. low vs. unknown), 
bone metastases (absence vs. presence), visceral metastases (absence vs. presence), visceral and bone 
metastases (absence vs. presence), number of prior VEGFR-TKIs (1 vs. ≥2), duration of first VEGFR-
TKI (≤6 months vs. >6 months). 
Objective response rate findings are summarized in Table 5.

Randomized study in treatment-naïve renal cell carcinoma patients (CABOSUN) 
The safety and efficacy of CABOMETYX for the treatment of treatment-naïve renal cell carcinoma 
were evaluated in a randomized, open-label, multicenter study (CABOSUN). Patients (N=157) with 
previously untreated, locally advanced or metastatic RCC with a clear cell component were randomized 
(1:1) to receive cabozantinib (N=79) or sunitinib (N=78). Patients had to have intermediate or poor risk 
disease  as  defined  by  the  International  Metastatic  RCC  Database  Consortium  (IMDC)  risk  group 
categories.  Patients  were  stratified  by  IMDC  risk  group  and  presence  of  bone  metastases  (yes/no). 
Approximately 75% of patients had a nephrectomy prior to onset of treatment. 
For intermediate risk disease, one or two of the following risk factors were met, while for poor risk, 
three or more factors were met: time from diagnosis of RCC to systemic treatment < 1 year, Hgb < 
LLN, corrected calcium > ULN, KPS < 80%, neutrophil count > ULN and platelet count > ULN. 
The primary endpoint was PFS. Secondary efficacy endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and 
overall survival (OS). Tumour assessments were conducted every 12 weeks. 
The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were similar between the cabozantinib and 
sunitinib arms. The majority of the patients were male (78%) with a median age of 62 years. Patient 
distribution by IMDC risk groups was 81% intermediate (1-2 risk factors) and 19% poor (≥3 risk 
factors). Most patients (87%) had ECOG performance status of 0 or 1; 13% had an ECOG 
performance status of 2. Thirty-six percent (36%) of patients had bone metastases.  
A statistically significant improvement in PFS as retrospectively assessed by a blinded Independent 
Radiology Committee (IRC) was demonstrated for cabozantinib compared to sunitinib (Figure 3 and 
Table 6). The results from the investigator determined analysis and IRC-determined analysis of PFS 
were consistent.  
Patients  with  both  positive  and  negative  MET  status  showed  a  favourable  effect  with  cabozantinib 
compared to sunitinib, with greater activity in patients with a positive MET status compared to patients 
with a negative MET status (HR=0.32 (0.16, 0.63) vs 0.67 (0.37, 1.23)) respectively.

Cabozantinib treatment was associated with a trend for longer survival compared to sunitinib (Table 6). 
The study was not powered for the OS analysis and the data are immature.  
Objective response rate (ORR) findings are summarized in Table 6.

Randomised phase 3 study of cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab vs. sunitinib (CA2099ER)   
The safety and efficacy of cabozantinib 40 mg orally daily in combination with nivolumab 240 mg 
intravenously every 2 weeks for the first-line treatment of advanced/metastatic RCC was evaluated in 
a phase 3, randomised, open label study (CA2099ER). The study included patients (18 years or older) 
with advanced or metastatic RCC with a clear cell component, Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) 
> 70%, and measurable disease as per RECIST v1.1 were included regardless of their PD-L1 status or 
IMDC risk group. The study excluded patients with autoimmune disease or other medical conditions 
requiring systemic immunosuppression, patients who had prior treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti PD-
L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CD137, or anti-CTLA-4 antibody, poorly controlled hypertension despite 
antihypertensive therapy, active brain metastases and uncontrolled adrenal insufficiency. Patients 
were stratified by IMDC prognostic score, PD-L1 tumour expression, and region. 
A total of 651 patients were randomised to receive either cabozantinib 40 mg once daily orally in 
combination with nivolumab 240 mg (n=323) administered intravenously every 2 weeks or sunitinib 
(n = 328) 50 mg daily, administered orally for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks off. Treatment continued 
until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity with nivolumab administration up to 24 months. 
Treatment beyond initial Investigator-assessed RECIST version 1.1-defined progression was 
permitted if the patient had a clinical benefit and was tolerating study drug, as determined by 
investigator. First tumour assessment post-baseline was performed at 12 weeks (± 7 days) following 
randomisation. Subsequent tumour assessments occurred at every 6 weeks (± 7 days) until Week 60, 
then every 12 weeks (± 14 days) until radiographic progression, confirmed by the Blinded 
23 
 
 
 
 
Independent Central review (BICR). The primary efficacy outcome measure was PFS as determined 
by a BICR. Additional efficacy measures included OS and ORR as key secondary endpoints. 
Baseline characteristics were generally balanced between the two groups. The median age was 
61 years (range: 28-90) with 38.4%  65 years of age and 9.5%  75 years of age. The majority of 
patients were male (73.9%) and white (81.9%). Eight percent of patients were Asian, 23.2% and 
76.5% of patients had a baseline KPS of 70 to 80% and 90 to 100%, respectively. Patient distribution 
by IMDC risk categories was 22.6% favourable, 57.6% intermediate, and 19.7% poor. For tumour 
PD-L1 expression, 72.5% of patients had PD-L1 expression < 1% or indeterminate and 24.9% of 
patients had PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%. 11.5% of patients had tumours with sarcomatoid features. The 
median duration of treatment was 14.26 months (range: 0.2-27.3 months) in cabozantinib with 
nivolumab-treated patients and was 9.23 months (range: 0.8-27.6 months) in sunitinib-treated patients.  
The study demonstrated a statistically significant benefit in PFS, OS, and ORR for patients 
randomised to cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab as compared to sunitinib. 
Efficacy results from the primary analysis (minimum follow-up 10.6 months; median follow-up 18.1 
months) are shown in Table 7.

The primary analysis of PFS included censoring for new anti-cancer treatment (Table 7). Results for 
PFS with and without censoring for new anti-cancer treatment were consistent. 
PFS benefit was observed in the cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab arm vs. sunitinib 
regardless of tumour PD L1 expression. Median PFS for tumour PD L1 expression ≥ 1% was 13.08 
for cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab, and was 4.67 months in the sunitinib arm (HR = 
0.45; 95% CI: 0.29, 0.68). For tumour PD L1 expression < 1%, the median PFS was 19.84 months for 
the cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab, and 9.26 months in the sunitinib arm (HR = 0.50; 
95% CI: 0.38, 0.65). 
PFS benefit was observed in the cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab arm vs. sunitinib 
regardless of the (IMDC) risk category. Median PFS for the favourable risk group was not reached for 
cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab, and was 12.81 months in the sunitinib arm (HR = 0.60; 
95% CI: 0.37, 0.98). Median PFS for the intermediate risk group was 17.71 months for cabozantinib 
in combination with nivolumab and was 8.38 months in the sunitinib arm (HR = 0.54; 95% CI: 0.41, 
0.73). Median PFS for the poor risk group was 12.29 months for cabozantinib in combination with 
nivolumab and was 4.21 months in the sunitinib arm (HR = 0.36; 95% CI: 0.23, 0.58). 
An updated PFS and OS analysis were performed when all patients had a minimum follow-up of 
16 months and a median follow-up of 23.5 months (see figures 4 and 5). The PFS hazard ratio was 
0.52 (95% CI: 0.43; 0.64). The OS hazard ratio was 0.66 (95% CI: 0.50; 0.87). Updated efficacy data 
(PFS and OS) in subgroups for the IMDC risk categories and PD-L1 expression levels confirmed the 
original results. With the updated analysis, median PFS is reached for the favourable risk group.

Hepatocellular carcinoma 
Controlled study in patients who have received sorafenib (CELESTIAL) 
The safety and efficacy of CABOMETYX were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo--
controlled phase 3 study (CELESTIAL). Patients (N=707) with HCC not amenable to curative 
treatment and who had previously received sorafenib for advanced disease were randomized (2:1) to 
receive cabozantinib (N=470) or placebo (N=237). Patients could have received one other prior 
systemic therapy for advanced disease in addition to sorafenib. Randomization was stratified by 
aetiology of disease (HBV [with or without HCV], HCV [without HBV], or other), geographic region 
(Asia, other regions) and by presence of extrahepatic spread of disease and/or macrovascular 
invasions (Yes, No). 
The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival (OS). Secondary efficacy endpoints were 
progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR), as assessed by the investigator 
using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) 1.1. Tumour assessments were 
conducted every 8 weeks. Subjects continued blinded study treatment after radiological disease 
progression whilst they experienced clinical benefit or until the need for subsequent systemic or liver-
directed local anticancer therapy. Crossover from placebo to cabozantinib was not allowed during the 
blinded treatment phase. 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were similar between the cabozantinib and 
placebo arms and are shown below for all 707 randomised patients. 
The majority of patients (82%) were male: the median age was 64 years. The majority of patients 
(56%) were Caucasian and 34% of patients were Asian. Fifty three percent (53%) of patients had 
ECOG performance status (PS) 0 and 47% had ECOG PS 1. Almost all patients (99%) were Child 
Pugh A and 1% were Child Pugh B. Aetiology for HCC included 38% hepatitis B virus (HBV), 21% 
hepatitis C virus (HCV), 40% other (neither HBV nor HCV). Seventy-eight percent (78%) had 
macroscopic vascular invasion and/ or extra-hepatic tumour spread, 41% had alfa-fetoprotein (AFP) 
levels ≥400μg/L, 44% had been treated by loco-regional transarterial embolisation or chemoinfusion 
procedures, 37% had radiotherapy prior to cabozantinib treatment. Median duration of sorafenib 
treatment was 5.32 months. Seventy-two percent (72%) of patients had received 1 and 28% had 
received 2 prior systemic therapy regimens for advanced disease. 
A statistically significant improvement in OS was demonstrated for cabozantinib compared to placebo 
(Table 8 and Figure 6).  
PFS and ORR findings are summarized in Table 8.

The incidence of systemic non-radiation and local liver-directed systemic non-protocol anticancer 
therapy (NPACT) was 26% in the cabozantinib arm and 33% in the placebo arm. Subjects receiving 
these therapies had to discontinue study treatment. An exploratory OS analysis censoring for the use 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of NPACT supported the primary analysis: the HR, adjusted for stratification factors (per IxRS), was 
0.66 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.84; stratified logrank p-value = 0.0005). The Kaplan- Meier estimates for 
median duration of OS were 11.1 months in the cabozantinib arm versus 6.9 months in the placebo 
arm, an estimated 4.2-month difference in the medians. 
Non-disease specific quality of life (QoL) was assessed using the EuroQoL EQ-5D-5L. A negative 
effect of cabozantinib versus placebo on the EQ-5D utility index score was observed during the first 
weeks of treatment. Only limited QoL data are available after this period. 
Differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) 
Placebo -Controlled study in adult patients who have received prior systemic therapy and are 
refractory or not eligible to radioactive iodine (COSMIC-311) 
The safety and efficacy of CABOMETYX was evaluated in COSMIC-311, a randomised (2:1), 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial in adult patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic disease with differentiated thyroid cancer that had progressed following up to two prior 
VEGFR-targeting therapy (including, but not limited to, lenvatinib or sorafenib) and were radioactive 
iodine-refractory or not eligible. Patients with measurable disease and documented radiographic 
progression per RECIST 1.1 per the Investigator, during or following treatment with VEGFR-
targeting TKI, were randomised (N=258) to receive cabozantinib 60 mg orally once daily (N=170) or 
placebo (N=88).  
Randomisation was stratified by prior receipt of lenvatinib (yes vs. no) and age (≤ 65 years vs. > 65 
years). Eligible patients randomised to placebo were allowed to cross-over to cabozantinib upon 
confirmation of progressive disease by blinded independent radiology review committee (BIRC). 
Subjects continued blinded study treatment as long as they experienced clinical benefit or until there 
was unacceptable toxicity. The primary efficacy outcome measures were progression-free survival 
(PFS) in the ITT population, and objective response rate (ORR) in the first 100 randomised patients, 
as assessed by BIRC per RECIST 1.1. Tumour assessments were conducted every 8 weeks after 
randomisation during the first 12 months on study, then every 12 weeks thereafter. Overall survival 
(OS) was an additional endpoint.  
The primary analysis of PFS included 187 randomised patients, 125 to cabozantinib and 62 to 
placebo. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were generally balanced for both 
treatment groups. The median age was 66 years (range 32 to 85 years), 51% being ≥ 65 years of age, 
13% being ≥ 75 years of age. The majority of patients were white (70%), 18% of patients were Asian 
and 55% were female. Histologically, 55% had a confirmed diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma, 
48% had follicular thyroid carcinoma including 17% patients with Hürthle cell thyroid cancer. 
Metastases were present in 95% of the patients: lungs in 68%, lymph nodes in 67%, bone in 29%, 
pleura in 18% and liver in 15%. Five patients had not received prior RAI due to ineligibility, 63% had 
received prior lenvatinib, 60% had received prior sorafenib and 23% had received both sorafenib and 
lenvatinib. Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (48%) or 1 (52%).  
The median duration of treatment was 4.4 months in the cabozantinib arm and 2.3 months in the 
placebo arm.  
The results of the primary analysis (with a cut-off date of 19 August 2020 and median follow up 6.2 
months for the PFS), and the updated analysis (with a cut-off date of 08 February 2021 and median 
follow-up 10.1 months for the PFS) are presented in Table 9. The trial did not demonstrate a 
statistically significant improvement in ORR for patients randomised to cabozantinib (n=67) 
compared with placebo (n=33): 15% vs. 0%. The trial demonstrated a statistically significant 
improvement in PFS (median follow up 6.2 months) for patients randomised to cabozantinib (n=125) 
compared with placebo (n=62).  
An updated analysis of PFS and OS (median follow up 10.1 months) was performed including 258 
randomised patients, 170 to cabozantinib and 88 to placebo.  
The overall survival analysis was confounded as placebo-treated subjects with confirmed disease 
progression had the option to cross over to cabozantinib.

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of some studies 
with CABOMETYX in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of solid 
malignant tumours (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
ADVL 1211 
A  phase  1  study  (ADVL1211)  of  cabozantinib  in  paediatric  patients  with  solid  tumours  has  been 
conducted by the Children Oncology Group (COG). Eligible patients were ≥2 years and ≤18 years. This 
study enrolled patients at 3 dose levels: 30 mg/m2, 40 mg/m2, and 55 mg/m2 once daily on a continuous 
dosing schedule (weekly dosing by BSA and rounded to the nearest 20 mg).  Cabozantinib was dosed 
based on body surface area (BSA) according to a dosing nomogram 
The objective was to define dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), to determine the recommended phase 2 
dose (RP2D), to obtain preliminary pharmacokinetics data in children and to explore efficacy in solid 
tumours. Forty-one patients were enrolled, of whom 36 were fully evaluable. Patients had a variety of 
solid tumours: MTC (n=5), osteosarcoma (n=2), EWS (n=4), rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) (n=2), other 
soft tissue sarcoma (STS) (n=4), Wilms tumour (WT) (n=2), hepatoblastoma (n=2), HCC (n=2), RCC 
(n=3), central nervous system (CNS) tumours (n=9), and others (n=6).  
Of the 36 subjects in the evaluable population, four subjects (11.1%) had best overall response of PR 
and eight subjects (22.2%) had SD (lasting at least 6 cycles). Of the 12 subjects with PR or SD greater 
than or equal to 6 cycles 10 subjects were in the cabozantinib 40 mg/m2 or 55 mg/m2 groups (seven 
and three, respectively).   
Based on central review, partial responses were seen in 2/5 patients with MTC, one patient with Wilms 
tumour, and one patient with clear cell sarcoma.  
ADVL1622 
ADVL1622 assessed the activity of cabozantinib in selected pediatric solid tumors. This multicenter, 
open label two-stage phase 2 trial included the following solid tumour strata: non-osteosarcoma strata 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(including Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas 
(NRSTS) and Wilms tumour), osteosarcoma stratum and rare solid tumours strata (including medullary 
thyroid  carcinoma  (MTC),  renal  cell  carcinoma  (RCC),  hepatocellular  carcinoma  (HCC), 
hepatoblastoma,  adrenocortical  carcinoma  and  other  solid tumours).  Cabozantinib  was  administered 
orally  once  daily  on  a  continuous  dosing  schedule  of  28-day  cycles  at  a  dose  of  40  mg/m2/day 
(cumulative weekly dose of 280 mg/m2 using a dosing nomogram). Subjects were ≥2 and ≤30 years of 
age at the time of study entry for all strata except upper age limit of ≤18 years of age for MTC, RCC 
and HCC. 
For  non-osteosarcoma  and  rare  tumors  strata  the  primary  endpoint  was  the  objective  response  rate 
(ORR). For the osteosarcoma stratum, a two-stage design that incorporated dual endpoints of objective 
response (CR + PR) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 
criteria and treatment success as defined by SD for ≥4 months was utilized. The PK of cabozantinib in 
pediatric and adolescent subjects was assessed (please refer to section 5.2) 
Efficacy Results Summary 
At the data cutoff date (30 June 2021), 108/109 subjects had received at least one dose of cabozantinib. 
Each statistical cohort in the non-osteosarcoma strata included 13 subjects. No responses were observed 
in these statistical cohorts. The osteosarcoma stratum included in total 29 subjects including 17 children 
(aged 9 to 17 years) and 12 adults (aged 18 to 22 years).  
In the osteosarcoma stratum, all subjects had received prior systemic therapy A PR was observed in one 
adult and one child. The Disease Control Rate (DCR) was 34.5% (95% CI: 17.9, 54.3). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following oral administration of cabozantinib, peak cabozantinib plasma concentrations are reached 
at 3 to 4 hours post-dose. Plasma-concentration time profiles show a second absorption peak 
approximately 24 hours after administration, which suggests that cabozantinib may undergo 
enterohepatic recirculation. 
Repeat daily dosing of cabozantinib at 140 mg for 19 days resulted in an approximately a 4- to 5-fold 
mean cabozantinib accumulation (based on AUC) compared to a single dose administration; steady 
state is achieved by approximately Day 15. 
A high-fat meal moderately increased Cmax and AUC values (41% and 57%, respectively) relative to 
fasted conditions in healthy volunteers administered a single 140 mg oral cabozantinib dose. There is 
no information on the precise food-effect when taken 1 hour after administration of cabozantinib. 
Bioequivalence could not be demonstrated between the cabozantinib capsule and tablet formulations 
following a single 140 mg dose in healthy subjects. A 19% increase in the Cmax of the tablet 
formulation compared to the capsule formulation was observed. A less than 10% difference in the 
AUC was observed between cabozantinib tablet and capsule formulations. 
Distribution 
Cabozantinib is highly protein bound in vitro in human plasma (≥ 99.7%). Based on the population-
pharmacokinetic (PK) model, the volume of distribution of the central compartment (Vc/F) was 
estimated to be 212 L.  
Biotransformation 
Cabozantinib was metabolized in vivo. Four metabolites were present in plasma at exposures (AUC) 
greater than 10% of parent: XL184-N-oxide, XL184 amide cleavage product, XL184 monohydroxy 
sulfate, and 6-desmethyl amide cleavage product sulfate. Two non-conjugated metabolites (XL184-
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
N-oxide and XL184 amide cleavage product), which possess <1% of the on-target kinase inhibition 
potency of parent cabozantinib, each represent <10% of total drug-related plasma exposure. 
Cabozantinib is a substrate for CYP3A4 metabolism in vitro, as a neutralizing antibody to CYP3A4 
inhibited formation of metabolite XL184 N-oxide by >80% in a NADPH-catalysed human liver 
microsomal (HLM) incubation; in contrast, neutralizing antibodies to CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1 had no effect on cabozantinib metabolite formation. A 
neutralizing antibody to CYP2C9 showed a minimal effect on cabozantinib metabolite formation 
(ie, a <20% reduction). 
Elimination 
In a population PK analysis of cabozantinib using data collected from 1883 patients and 140 healthy 
volunteers following oral administration of a range of doses from 20 to 140 mg, the plasma terminal 
half-life of cabozantinib is approximately 110 hours. Mean clearance (CL/F) at steady-state was 
estimated to be 2.48 L/hr. Within a 48-day collection period after a single dose of 14C-cabozantinib in 
healthy volunteers, approximately 81% of the total administered radioactivity was recovered with 
54% in faeces and 27% in urine.  
Pharmacokinetics in special patient populations 
Renal impairment 
In a renal impairment study conducted with a single 60 mg dose of cabozantinib, the ratios of 
geometric LS mean for total plasma cabozantinib, Cmax and AUC0-inf were 19% and 30% higher, for 
subjects with mild renal impairment (90% CI for Cmax 91.60% to 155.51%; AUC0-inf 98.79% to 
171.26%) and 2% and 6-7% higher (90% CI for Cmax 78.64% to 133.52%; AUC0-inf 79.61% to 
140.11%), for subjects with moderate renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal 
function. The geometric LS means for unbound plasma cabozantinib AUC0-inf was 0.2% higher for 
subjects with mild renal impairment (90% CI 55.9% to 180%) and 17% higher (90% CI 65.1% to 
209.7%) for subjects with moderate renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal 
function. Subjects with severe renal impairment have not been studied. 
Hepatic impairment 
Based on an integrated population pharmacokinetic analysis of cabozantinib in healthy subjects and 
cancer patients (including HCC), no clinically significant difference in the mean cabozantinib plasma 
exposure was observed amongst subjects with normal liver function (n=1425) and mild hepatic 
impairment (n=558). There is limited data in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (n=15) as per 
NCI-ODWG (National Cancer Institute – Organ Dysfunction working Group) criteria. The 
pharmacokinetics of cabozantinib was not evaluated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
Race 
A population PK analysis did not identify clinically relevant differences in PK of cabozantinib based 
on race. 
Paediatrics 
Data obtained from simulation performed with the population pharmacokinetic model developed in 
healthy subjects as well as adult patients with different type of malignancies show that in adolescent 
patients aged 12 years and older, a dose of 40 mg of cabozantinib once daily for patients < 40 kg, or a 
dose of 60 mg once daily in patients ≥ 40 kg results in a similar plasma exposure attained in adults 
treated with 60 mg of cabozantinib once daily (see section 4.2). 
In the two clinical studies conducted by the COG in paediatric patients with solid tumours (ADVL1211 
and  ADVL1622), cabozantinib  was  dosed  based on  body  surface  area  (BSA)  according  to  a  dosing 
nomogram, using available 20 mg and 60 mg tablets intended for adults. Among the 55 patients, median 
age was 13 years (range: 4 to 18 years). A population PK analysis was built using PK data collected in 
both studies. The PK of cabozantinib was adequately described by a two-compartment model with first-
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
order  elimination  and  first-order  absorption  processes.  There  was  no  evidence  that  age,  sex,  race 
ethnicity and tumour type affected cabozantinib PK in children and adolescent patients. Only BSA was 
found to be a significant predictor of cabozantinib PK. No dose dependency was seen in the developed 
model  across  the  three  tested  dose  levels  (30,  40  and  55  mg/m²). The  exposures  in  children  and 
adolescent  subjects  following  an  administration  of  a  BSA-based  dose  of  40mg/m²  are  similar  to 
exposures in adults with a fixed dose of 60mg QD. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Adverse reactions not observed in clinical trials, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to 
clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows: 
In rat and dog repeat-dose toxicity studies up to 6 months duration, target organs for toxicity were GI 
tract, bone marrow, lymphoid tissues, kidney, adrenal and reproductive tract tissues. The no observed 
adverse effect level (NOAEL) for these findings were below human clinical exposure levels at 
intended therapeutic dose. 
Cabozantinib has shown no mutagenic or clastogenic potential in a standard battery of genotoxicity 
assays. The carcinogenic potential of cabozantinib has been evaluated in two species: rasH2 
transgenic mice and Sprague-Dawley rats. In the 2-year rat carcinogenicity study, cabozantinib-
related neoplastic findings consisted of an increased incidence of benign pheochromocytoma, alone or 
in combination with malignant pheochromocytoma/complex malignant pheochromocytoma of the 
adrenal medulla in both sexes at exposures well below the intended exposure in humans. The clinical 
relevance of the observed neoplastic lesions in rats is uncertain, but likely to be low. 
Cabozantinib was not carcinogenic in the rasH2 mouse model at a slightly higher exposure than the 
intended human therapeutic exposure. 
Fertility studies in rats have shown reduced male and female fertility. Further, hypospermatogenesis 
was observed in male dogs at exposure levels below human clinical exposure levels at intended 
therapeutic dose.  
Embryo-foetal development studies were performed in rats and rabbits. In rats, cabozantinib caused 
postimplantation loss, foetal oedema, cleft palate/lip, dermal aplasia and kinked or rudimentary tail. In 
rabbits, cabozantinib produced foetal soft tissue changes (reduced spleen size, small or missing 
intermediate lung lobe) and increased foetal incidence of total malformations. NOAEL for embryo-
foetal toxicity and teratogenic findings were below human clinical exposure levels at intended 
therapeutic dose. 
Juvenile rats (comparable to a >2 year-old paediatric population) administered cabozantinib showed 
increased WBC parameters, decreased haematopoiesis, pubescent/immature female reproductive 
system (without delayed vaginal opening), tooth abnormalities, reduced bone mineral content and 
density, liver pigmentation and lymph node lymphoid hyperplasia. Findings in uterus/ovaries and 
decreased haematopoiesis appeared to be transient, while effects on bone parameters and liver 
pigmentation were sustained. Juvenile rats (correlating to a <2- year paediatric population) showed 
similar treatment-related findings, with additional findings in male reproductive system (degeneration 
and/or atrophy of seminiferous tubules in testes, reduced luminal sperm in epididymis), and appeared 
to be more sensitive to cabozantinib-related toxicity at comparable dose levels.

1.  What CABOMETYX is and what it is used for 
What CABOMETYX is 
CABOMETYX is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance cabozantinib.  
It is used in adults to treat: 
- 
- 
advanced kidney cancer called advanced renal cell carcinoma  
liver cancer when a specific anticancer medicine (sorafenib) is no longer stopping the disease 
from progressing.  
CABOMETYX is also used to treat locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer, a 
type of cancer in the thyroid gland, in adults when radioactive iodine and anticancer medicine 
treatments are no longer stopping the disease from progressing. 
CABOMETYX may be given in combination with nivolumab for advanced kidney cancer. It is 
important that you also read the package leaflet of nivolumab. If you have any questions about these 
medicines, please ask your doctor. 
How CABOMETYX works 
CABOMETYX blocks the action of proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), which are 
involved in the growth of cells and the development of new blood vessels that supply them. These 
proteins can be present in high amounts in cancer cells, and by blocking their action this medicine can 
slow down the rate at which the tumour grows and help to cut off the blood supply that the cancer 
needs.  
55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you take CABOMETYX 
Do not take CABOMETYX

if you are allergic to cabozantinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).

Other medicines and CABOMETYX

Introduction 
ASSESSMENT 
The final report for Amgen study 20021618 submitted in accordance with Article 46 of the Regulation 
(EC) No 1901/2006. 
1.  Background 
Study 20021618 (open label extension treatment with Etanercept for subjects with DMARD-refractory 
rheumatoid arthritis participating in etanercept clinical trials) is part of the paediatric development 
programme (PIP EMEA-000299-PIP-01-08). 
Previous annual updates, including that submitted in January 2009, have presented safety information 
from the following two juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) studies: 
•  Amgen study 20021626 (formerly study 16.0026) – a 36 month phase 4 open-label 
registry study of etanercept versus methotrexate in children with polyarticular and 
systemic onset JIA. 
•  Amgen Study 20021618 (formerly study 16.0018) – an open label extension treatment 
with etanercept for participating patients in etanercept JIA clinical trials.  
Study 20021626 completed in 2008 and its CSR was presented with the January 2009 update for this 
follow-up measure. Therefore this year’s update consists of the CSR 79728 abbreviated report for study 
20021618 plus a brief clinical overview.  
LINE LISTING OF ALL THE STUDIES INCLUDED IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  SECTION 2 – DATA FROM STUDY 20021618 ONLY WITH 
FOCUS ON PAEDIATRIC DATA 
Etanercept was first approved for use in pediatric patients in May 1999 in the United States and in 
February 2000 in the European Union for the indication of polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) 
in children 4 to 17 years of age. Subsequently, etanercept has more recently been approved for use in 
pediatric patients with severe plaque psoriasis from the age of 8 years in the EU.  
Per the approval of etanercept for the treatment of polyarticular JIA in the European Union, the Marketing 
Authorisation Holder (MAH) was committed to present the results from future studies in pediatric subjects 
(Commitment 16). Updates on the progress of the pediatric studies were to be provided on an annual basis 
and final study reports were to be submitted. 
Study 16.0016 established the safety, population pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of 0.4 mg/kg etanercept 
twice weekly (BIW) in subjects aged 4 to 17 years who were refractory or intolerant to methotrexate, and 
was the basis for the approval for the treatment of polyarticular JIA.  
Study 20021618 was an open-label study of long-term etanercept treatment through 10 years, which 
included pediatric subjects who had previously participated in study 16.0016 as well as adult subjects who 
had previously participated in double-blind rheumatoid arthritis studies. Pediatric subjects who entered 
study 20021618 with well-controlled arthritis symptoms continued with the etanercept dose administered 
in study 16.0016 (0.4 mg/kg etanercept BIW up to a maximum dose of 25 mg per injection). The study 
was conducted at 36 sites in the United States and 2 sites in Canada. Study 20021618 was completed in 
December 2008, and the final clinical study report (CSR-79728) summarizing approximately 10 years of 
cumulative safety and efficacy results from study 20021618 is included in this post-approval commitment.  
Study Design, Methodology, and Study Population 
All subjects from the initial etanercept study 16.0016 were eligible to enrol in study 20021618. Although 
pediatric subjects who entered study 20021618 initially continued with the etanercept dose administered in 
study 16.0016 (0.4 mg/kg etanercept BIW up to a maximum dose of 25 mg per injection), the 0.8-mg/kg 
weekly dose (maximum dose of 50 mg per week) could be administered as two 0.4-mg/kg subcutaneous 
(SC) injections either on the same day or 3 to 4 days apart, or as a single 0.8-mg/kg injection once weekly. 
Fifty-eight (58, 84%) of the 69 pediatric subjects from study 16.0016 received etanercept in study 
20021618 (Table 14-1.1.1B).  
 
 
 
 
 
Fifteen (15) of the 58 pediatric subjects who enrolled in study 20021618 completed the study and 43 
discontinued treatment. 
The most common reasons for discontinuation for pediatric subjects enrolled in study 20021618 were as 
follows: other (not related to safety, 10 subjects), response status (lack of efficacy in 9 subjects and 
remission in 3 subjects), and subject refusal (7 subjects). 
Comment: A higher rate of discontinuation in children (74.1%) compared with adults (62.5%) was seen. 
Discontinuations due to AEs were less common in children compared with adults  
The study 20021618 pediatric population consisted of 39 female and 19 male subjects aged 4 to 17 years 
(mean age 11.02 years).  
CSR-79728 includes cumulative data from both studies 16.0016 and 20021618 (n=69), as well as study-
specific data for study 20021618 alone (n=58).  
Effectiveness Endpoints 
The effectiveness endpoints for paediatric subjects in the study 20021618 database included  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. 
juvenile rheumatoid arthritis 30% definition of improvement (JRA-DOI 30), JRA-DOI 50, JRA-
DOI 70, JRA-DOI 90, and JRA-DOI 100 responses;  
2.  JRA-DOI components at the effectiveness assessment visit: physician global assessment (PGA) of 
disease activity, subject global assessment (SGA) of disease activity, number of active joints, 
Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ) score, C-reactive protein (CRP), and loss of 
motion (LOM) joint count;  
3.  other clinical endpoints at the effectiveness assessment visits: LOM plus tender/painful joint 
count, JRA-DOI 30, subject’s pain visual analog scale (VAS), and duration of morning stiffness;  
4.  change from baseline in subject’s assessment of pain; and  
5.  change from baseline in morning stiffness. 
No imputation or estimation methods were used for missing values during the study (ie, a last-observation-
carried-forward approach was not used). 
Comment: This approach is endorsed. 
Results 
Pediatric subjects received up to 7 months of etanercept exposure in study 16.0016 before enrolling in 
study 20021618. During study 20021618, pediatric subjects maintained clinical improvements in disease 
activity (total active joints, LOM and pain/tender joints, pain assessment, PGA, patient/parent global 
assessment, CHAQ, and CRP) relative to baseline (Table 2-4). 
The proportion of pediatric subjects achieving JRA-DOI 30, JRA-DOI 50, JRA-DOI 70, JRA-DOI 90, and 
JRA-DOI 100 remained relatively stable over 10 years (Table 2-4). 
Comment: 
While it is likely that efficacy was maintained in those who remained on etanercept, it is difficult to 
evaluate long-term efficacy after year 6. The number of subjects for whom there was efficacy data 
available after year 6 constitutes a progressively smaller percentage of the patients still in the study at 
those time points. 
At year 6, 27/27 were evaluable; year 7, 22/26; year 8, 11/22; year 9, 6/18 and for year 10 only 3/14 cases 
had efficacy data available. Therefore while the statement that the proportion of paediatric subjects 
achieving JRA-DOI 30, JRA-DOI 50, JRA-DOI 70, JRA-DOI 90, and JRA-DOI 100 remained relatively 
 
 
 
stable over 10 years is correct in terms of percentages, the absolute numbers evaluable make the data less 
definitive.  The MAH is requested to explain why such little efficacy data was available in the later years 
of the study.  
Safety  
The safety endpoints for the study-specific database (20021618) included exposure to etanercept, vital 
signs and physical examinations, adverse events, hematology profile, chemistry profile, urinalysis, 
premature discontinuations, deaths, serious adverse events (SAEs), anti-etanercept antibodies, and 
autoimmune features checklist. Throughout the initial study 16.0016 and the first year of study 20021618, 
adverse events (serious and nonserious) were collected and analyzed. After the first year of study 
20021618, data were collected for all SAEs and predefined events of interest (including hospitalization, 
deaths, serious infections, development of malignancies, and new signs or symptoms of other connective 
tissue disease). 
SAEs were classified using a modified version of the Coding Symbols for a Thesaurus of Adverse 
Reaction Terms (COSTART) dictionary. In previous reports of long-term etanercept use, serious 
infections were defined as those requiring hospitalization or intravenous (IV) antibiotics. Because the only 
informational source for serious infections after the first year of study 20021618 was SAE reports, 
nonserious infections treated with IV antibiotics, but not requiring hospitalization, were not collected.  
Opportunistic infections were defined based on the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention 
definition of opportunistic infections, as described for patients with human immunodeficiency virus (CDC 
Wonder On-line Database, 1992). Exposure-adjusted rates of events per subject-year were calculated as 
total number of events reported, divided by total etanercept exposure (summed over subjects), excluding 
time elapsed between studies. 
Safety Results 
Fifty-eight  (58,  84%)  of  the  69  pediatric  subjects  from  study  16.0016  received  etanercept  in  study 
20021618.  The  total  etanercept  exposure  for  the  58  pediatric  subjects  in  study  20021618  was  341.98 
patient-years (Table 14-6.4.1B).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Comment: This change in the classification of serious infections could lead to a reduction in numbers due 
to the change in classification after the first year.  However from year 2 onwards a comparison of the rates 
of serious infections is possible.  As can be seen from Table 14-6.4.1.B the incidence of serious infections 
in the paediatric population did not show a trend of increasing over time, although the absolute number of 
subjects declined each year, and there were no serious infections in the paediatric group after year 8.    
The mean paediatric exposure to etanercept was 614.2 doses (mean) over 2153.6 days (mean). 
Five (5) pediatric subjects were withdrawn from study 20021618 because of the following adverse events: 
JRA flare in 1 subject;  
purpura fulminans in 1 subject;  
skin disorder and fibro tendon in 1 subject;  
infection/infection super in 1 subject; and  
diarrhea, vomiting, bone disorder, and meningitis in 1 subject  
The rate of SAEs in the pediatric subjects remained relatively constant over time in study 20021618 with 
the highest rates observed in years 1 and 2 (Table 14-6.4.1B). 
A total of 44 SAEs were reported in 16 pediatric subjects (27.6% of subjects; 12.87 events per 100 
subject-years) (Tables 14-6.1.1B and 14-6.3.1B).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Most of the SAEs occurred in only 1 pediatric subject each, with the exception of rheumatoid arthritis 
which occurred in 6 (10.3%) pediatric subjects, and aggravated reaction, infection, abdominal pain, and 
arthralgia which occurred in 2 (3.4%) subjects each. 
The rate of serious infections in the pediatric subjects remained relatively constant over time with 
increasing exposure to etanercept (Table 14-6.4.1B).  
A total of 11 serious infections were reported in 8 pediatric subjects (13.8% of subjects; 3.22 events per 
100 subject-years) (Tables 14-6.1.2B and 14-6.3.2B). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No malignancies, including lymphoma, were reported for pediatric subjects in study 20021618 (Table 14-
6.4.1B). 
No deaths were reported for pediatric subjects in study 20021618 (Table 14-6.4.1B). 
Comment: No deaths, no malignancies and no increase in serious infections or SAEs over time were 
found in the paediatric population. 
Several specific adverse events historically have been of increased interest in subjects receiving tumor 
necrosis factor antagonist therapies. These events include demyelinating diseases, opportunistic infections, 
cardiovascular events, and sepsis. One (1) case of sepsis was reported in a pediatric subject in study 
20021618: an 8-year-old female subject experienced an SAE of sepsis in year 3 of study 20021618, after 
810 exposure days to etanercept.  
The event of sepsis resolved; however, ischemia of the left foot and distal leg required mid-calf 
amputation.  
No cases of demyelinating disease, opportunistic infection, or cardiovascular disease were reported in 
pediatric subjects (Table 14-6.7A). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MAH CONCLUSIONS 
The findings from study 20021618 suggest that long-term treatment with etanercept of pediatric subjects 
with disease-modifying antirheumatic disease (DMARD)-refractory JIA is associated with a favorable and 
consistent benefit/risk profile over time. The rates and types of SAEs and serious infections remained 
relatively constant over approximately 10 years of follow-up. There were no reports of malignancy or 
death. No previously unknown safety risks were identified as a result of this 10-year analysis. As reflected 
by the proportion of subjects achieving JRA-DOI 30, JRA-DOI 50, JRA-DOI 70, and JRA-DOI 90, the 
effectiveness response to etanercept was sustained over time. 
In conclusion, these data are consistent with the known safety and efficacy profile of etanercept as 
described in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) for the treatment of pediatric patients with 
DMARD-refractory JIA. The MAH considers the SPC to adequately communicate the risks and benefits 
of etanercept in this population, and therefore no changes to the SPC are proposed at this time. 
CHMP’s Conclusions on the paediatric safety and efficacy from study 20021618 
Limited efficacy is available at later time points after year 6 for the paediatric subjects. The MAH are 
asked to comment. 
However the safety profile of the paediatric data is consistent with what is known for etanercept and 
highlighted in the SPC. No change to the positive benefit:risk ratio for etanercept follows from this FUM. 
The data submitted in accordance with Article 46 is considered satisfactory and no changes to the SPC are 
requested.  
II. 
RAPPORTEUR’S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND FURTHER 
ACTION IF REQUIRED 
Overall Conclusion: 
The data from the long-term study 20021618 has shown that the safety profile for paediatric subjects is 
consistent with what is known for etanercept.  The data submitted in accordance with Article 46 is 
considered satisfactory and no changes to the SPC are requested.  
No change to the positive benefit:risk ratio for etanercept follows from this FUM. 
  PAC fulfilled with one outstanding question. 
While it is likely that efficacy was maintained in those who remained on etanercept, it is difficult to 
evaluate long-term efficacy after year 6 from the paediatric data. The number of subjects for whom there 
was efficacy data available after year 6 constitutes a progressively smaller percentage of the patients still 
in the study at those time points. 
The MAH is requested to explain why such little efficacy data was available in the later years of the study 
for the paediatric subjects.

The SmPC section 4.3 has been updated to remove the 
To update sections 4.3 and 4.6 of the SmPC in order 
to remove the contraindication on the initiation of 
treatment in pregnancy and to update the 
recommendations on use in pregnancy and 
breastfeeding following the completion of the 
European IFN Beta Pregnancy Registry (8th Annual 
and final report) and the Final CSR of the register-
based study in the Nordic countries (EUPAS13054). 
The MAH took the opportunity to add information 
about traceability in section 4.4 and to update the 
Product information to the QRD template version 
10.1. 
The Package leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
This submission fulfils MEA 024.2 and 21. 
The RMP has been updated (ver 4.6) to include 
changes to the safety specification related to 
Pregnancy missing information status, in light of the 
contraindication ‘initiation of treatment in pregnancy’ 
The SmPC section 4.6 has been updated as follows:  
Pregnancy 
A large amount of data (more than 1,000 pregnancy 
outcomes) from interferon beta registries, national 
registries and post marketing experience indicates no 
increased risk of major congenital anomalies, after pre-
conception exposure or exposure during the first trimester 
of pregnancy. 
However, the duration of exposure during the first 
trimester is uncertain, because data were collected when 
interferon beta use was contraindicated during pregnancy, 
and treatment was likely interrupted when the pregnancy 
was detected and/or confirmed. Experience with exposure 
during the second and third trimesters is very limited. 
Based on animal data (see section 5.3), there is a possibly 
increased risk for spontaneous abortion. The risk of 
spontaneous abortions in pregnant women exposed to

to other key sections of the RMP, adapting to the

guidelines.

interferon beta cannot adequately be evaluated by means 
of the currently available data, but the data suggest no 
increased risk so far. 
If clinically needed, the use of Extavia may be considered 
during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
Limited information available on the transfer of interferon 
beta-1b into breast milk, together with the chemical / 
physiological characteristics of interferon beta, suggests 
that levels of interferon beta-1b excreted in human milk 
are negligible. No harmful effects on the breast-fed 
newborn/infant are anticipated. 
Extavia can be used during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
No investigations on fertility have been conducted (see 
section 5.3). 
The PL has been updated accordingly.

there might be a causal relationship between the class of 
interferons and thrombotic microangiopathy, and that the

concurred that a warning about the risk of thrombotic 
microangiopathy, including recommendations for 
monitoring of early symptoms, prompt treatment and 
discontinuation of interferon beta products when the 
reaction occurs, should be added to the Product 
Information.

SmPC and PL 
In order to adapt Extavia Product Information to the 
the following adverse reactions identified during 
post-marketing surveillance: weight increased, 
menorrhagia, arthralgia, dizziness, vasodilatation, 
diarrhoea and the following terms which are 
described in section 4.4: capillary leak syndrome, 
hepatic injury and hepatic failure. Table 2 in section 
4.8 (i.e. adverse drug reaction listing based on 
reports from post marketing surveillance) was 
amended such that reaction frequencies are based 
on pooled clinical trial data. Update of section 4.4 of 
the SmPC to align the text with the reference 
product Betaferon. 
The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update 
the list of local representatives in the Package 
Leaflet.

current Corporate Core Data Sheet, the MAH proposed to 
update section 4.8 of the SmPC with adding adverse 
reactions based on the post-marketing reporting. The CHMP 
considered the MAH´s assessment of causality for 
arthralgia, diarrhoea, dizziness, menorrhagia, 
vasodilatation and weight increased and concluded that 
adding these reactions into section 4.8 of the SmPC was 
justified, since these events were considered as “possibly 
related”. The CHMP was also of the view that “weight 
decreased” can be moved from section “Investigation” to 
section “Metabolism and nutrition disorder” and that the 
following terms: capillary leak syndrome, hepatic injury and 
hepatic failure, already captured in section 4.4, can also be 
listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC. Following a request from 
the CHMP, adverse reaction frequencies in table 2 were 
updated based on incidence rates of the pooled clinical trial 
data, when feasible.

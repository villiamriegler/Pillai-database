CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Synjardy is indicated for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to diet and 
exercise:


in patients insufficiently controlled on their maximally tolerated dose of metformin alone
in combination with other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes, in patients 
insufficiently controlled with metformin and these medicinal products
in patients already being treated with the combination of empagliflozin and metformin as 
separate tablets.

For study results with respect to combinations, effects on glycaemic control and cardiovascular events, 
and the population studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Posology
Adults with normal renal function (eGFR ≥90 ml/min/1.73 m2)
The recommended dose is one tablet twice daily. The dosage should be individualised on the basis of 
the patient’s current regimen, effectiveness, and tolerability using the recommended daily dose of 
10 mg or 25 mg of empagliflozin, while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of 
metformin.
For patients insufficiently controlled on metformin (either alone or in combination with other 
medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes)
In patients insufficiently controlled on metformin alone or in combination with other medicinal 
products for the treatment of diabetes, the recommended starting dose of Synjardy should provide
empagliflozin 5 mg twice daily (10 mg daily dose) and the dose of metformin similar to the dose
already being taken. In patients tolerating a total daily dose of empagliflozin 10 mg and who need 
tighter glycaemic control, the dose can be increased to a total daily dose of empagliflozin 25 mg. 
When Synjardy is used in combination with a sulphonylurea and/or insulin, a lower dose of 
sulphonylurea and/or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia (see sections 4.5 and 
4.8). 
For patients switching from separate tablets of empagliflozin and metformin
Patients switching from separate tablets of empagliflozin (10 mg or 25 mg total daily dose) and 
metformin to Synjardy should receive the same daily dose of empagliflozin and metformin already 
being taken or the nearest therapeutically appropriate dose of metformin (for available strengths see 
section 2).
Missed dose
If a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as the patient remembers; however, a double dose 
should not be taken on the same time. In that case, the missed dose should be skipped.
Special populations
Renal impairment
The glycaemic efficacy of empagliflozin is dependent on renal function. For cardiovascular risk 
reduction as add on to standard of care, a dose of 10 mg empagliflozin daily should be used in patients 
with an eGFR below 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 (see Table 1). Because the glycaemic lowering efficacy of 
empagliflozin is reduced in patients with moderate renal impairment and likely absent in patients with 
3
severe renal impairment, if further glycaemic control is needed, the addition of other anti-
hyperglycaemic agents should be considered.
For dose adjustment recommendations according to eGFR or CrCL refer to Table 1.
A eGFR should be assessed before initiation of treatment with metformin containing products and at 
least annually thereafter. In patients at increased risk of further progression of renal impairment and in 
the elderly, renal function should be assessed more frequently, e.g. every 3-6 months.
If no adequate strength of Synjardy is available, individual monocomponents should be used instead of 
the fixed dose combination.

b patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease
Hepatic impairment
This medicinal product must not be used in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 
5.2).
Elderly 
Due to the mechanism of action, decreased renal function will result in reduced glycaemic efficacy of 
empagliflozin. Because metformin is excreted by the kidney and elderly patients are more likely to 
have decreased renal function, Synjardy should be used with caution in these patients. Monitoring of 
renal function is necessary to aid in prevention of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, particularly in 
elderly patients (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). In patients 75 years and older, an increased risk for volume 
depletion should be taken into account (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of Synjardy in children and adolescents aged 0 to 18 years has not been 
established. No data are available.
Method of administration 
Synjardy should be taken twice daily with meals to reduce the gastrointestinal adverse reactions
associated with metformin. The tablets should be swallowed whole with water. All patients should 
continue their diet with an adequate distribution of carbohydrate intake during the day. Overweight 
patients should continue their energy restricted diet.

Disease which may cause tissue hypoxia (especially acute disease, or worsening of chronic 
disease) such as: decompensated heart failure, respiratory failure, recent myocardial infarction, 
shock (see section 4.4).
Hepatic impairment, acute alcohol intoxication, alcoholism (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Lactic acidosis
Lactic acidosis, a very rare but serious metabolic complication, most often occurs at acute worsening 
of renal function or cardiorespiratory illness or sepsis. Metformin accumulation occurs at acute 
worsening of renal function and increases the risk of lactic acidosis.
In case of dehydration (severe diarrhoea or vomiting, fever or reduced fluid intake), metformin should 
be temporarily discontinued and contact with a health care professional is recommended.
Medicinal products that can acutely impair renal function (such as antihypertensives, diuretics and 
NSAIDs) should be initiated with caution in metformin-treated patients. Other risk factors for lactic 
acidosis are excessive alcohol intake, hepatic insufficiency, inadequately controlled diabetes, ketosis, 
prolonged fasting and any conditions associated with hypoxia, as well as concomitant use of medicinal 
products that may cause lactic acidosis (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).
Patients and/or care-givers should be informed of the risk of lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis is 
characterised by acidotic dyspnea, abdominal pain, muscle cramps, asthenia and hypothermia followed 
by coma. In case of suspected symptoms, the patient should stop taking metformin and seek 
immediate medical attention. Diagnostic laboratory findings are decreased blood pH (<7.35), 
increased plasma lactate levels (>5 mmol/l) and an increased anion gap and lactate/pyruvate ratio. 
Diabetic ketoacidosis
Rare cases of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), including life-threatening and fatal cases, have been 
reported in patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin. In a number of cases, the 
presentation of the condition was atypical with only moderately increased blood glucose values, below 
14 mmol/l (250 mg/dl). It is not known if DKA is more likely to occur with higher doses of 
empagliflozin.
The risk of diabetic ketoacidosis must be considered in the event of non-specific symptoms such as 
nausea, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain, excessive thirst, difficulty breathing, confusion, unusual 
fatigue or sleepiness. Patients should be assessed for ketoacidosis immediately if these symptoms 
occur, regardless of blood glucose level. 
In patients where DKA is suspected or diagnosed, treatment with empagliflozin should be 
discontinued immediately. 
Treatment should be interrupted in patients who are hospitalised for major surgical procedures or acute 
serious medical illnesses. Monitoring of ketones is recommended in these patients. Measurement of 
blood ketone levels is preferred to urine. Treatment with empagliflozin may be restarted when the 
ketone values are normal and the patient’s condition has stabilised.
5
Before initiating empagliflozin, factors in the patient history that may predispose to ketoacidosis 
should be considered.
Patients who may be at higher risk of DKA include patients with a low beta-cell function reserve (e.g. 
type 2 diabetes patients with low C-peptide or latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) or 
patients with a history of pancreatitis), patients with conditions that lead to restricted food intake or 
severe dehydration, patients for whom insulin doses are reduced and patients with increased insulin 
requirements due to acute medical illness, surgery or alcohol abuse. SGLT2 inhibitors should be used 
with caution in these patients.
Restarting SGLT2 inhibitor treatment in patients with previous DKA while on SGLT2 inhibitor 
treatment is not recommended, unless another clear precipitating factor is identified and resolved.
Synjardy should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes. Data from a clinical trial program in 
patients with type 1 diabetes showed increased DKA occurrence with common frequency in patients 
treated with empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg as an adjunct to insulin compared to placebo.
Administration of iodinated contrast agent
Intravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents may lead to contrast induced nephropathy, 
resulting in metformin accumulation and an increased risk of lactic acidosis. Metformin should be 
discontinued prior to or at the time of the imaging procedure and not restarted until at least 48 hours 
after, provided that renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be stable (see sections 4.2 and 
4.5).
Renal impairment
Due to the mechanism of action, decreased renal function will result in reduced glycaemic efficacy of 
empagliflozin. Empagliflozin/metformin is contraindicated in patients with eGFR<30 ml/min/1.73 m2
and should be temporarily discontinued in the presence of conditions that alter renal function (see 
section 4.3).
Monitoring of renal function
Assessment of renal function is recommended as follows:
- Prior to empagliflozin/metformin initiation and periodically during treatment, i.e. at least yearly (see 
section 4.2).
- Prior to initiation of any concomitant medicinal product that may have a negative impact on renal 
function.
Cardiac function
Patients with heart failure are more at risk of hypoxia and renal insufficiency. In patients with stable 
chronic heart failure, Synjardy may be used with a regular monitoring of cardiac and renal function. 
For patients with acute and unstable heart failure, Synjardy is contraindicated due to the metformin 
component (see section 4.3).
Surgery
Metformin must be discontinued at the time of surgery under general, spinal or epidural anaesthesia. 
Therapy may be restarted no earlier than 48 hours following surgery or resumption of oral nutrition 
and provided that renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be stable.
Risk for volume depletion
Based on the mode of action of SGLT2 inhibitors, osmotic diuresis accompanying therapeutic 
glucosuria may lead to a modest decrease in blood pressure (see section 5.1). Therefore, caution 
6
should be exercised in patients for whom a empagliflozin-induced drop in blood pressure could pose a 
risk, such as patients with known cardiovascular disease, patients on anti-hypertensive therapy with a 
history of hypotension or patients aged 75 years and older.
In case of conditions that may lead to fluid loss (e.g. gastrointestinal illness), careful monitoring of 
volume status (e.g. physical examination, blood pressure measurements, laboratory tests including 
haematocrit) and electrolytes is recommended for patients receiving Synjardy. Temporary interruption 
of treatment with Synjardy should be considered until the fluid loss is corrected.
Elderly 
The effect of empagliflozin on urinary glucose excretion is associated with osmotic diuresis, which 
could affect the hydration status. Patients aged 75 years and older may be at an increased risk of 
volume depletion. Therefore, special attention should be given to their volume intake in case of co-
administered medicinal products which may lead to volume depletion (e.g. diuretics, ACE inhibitors). 
Urinary tract infections
Post marketing cases of complicated urinary tract infections including pyelonephritis and urosepsis 
have been reported in patients treated with empagliflozin (see section 4.8). Temporary interruption of 
treatment should be considered in patients with complicated urinary tract infections.
Necrotising fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier’s gangrene)
Post-marketing cases of necrotising fasciitis of the perineum, (also known as Fournier’s gangrene), 
have been reported in female and male patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. This is a rare but serious and 
potentially life-threatening event that requires urgent surgical intervention and antibiotic treatment.
Patients should be advised to seek medical attention if they experience a combination of symptoms of 
pain, tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, with fever or malaise. Be aware 
that either uro-genital infection or perineal abscess may precede necrotising fasciitis. If Fournier´s 
gangrene is suspected, Synjardy should be discontinued and prompt treatment (including antibiotics 
and surgical debridement) should be instituted.
Lower limb amputations
An increase in cases of lower limb amputation (primarily of the toe) has been observed in long-term
clinical studies with another SGLT2 inhibitor. It is unknown whether this constitutes a class effect. 
Like for all diabetic patients it is important to counsel patients on routine preventative foot-care.
Hepatic injury
Cases of hepatic injury have been reported with empagliflozin in clinical trials. A causal relationship 
between empagliflozin and hepatic injury has not been established.
Elevated haematocrit
Haematocrit increase was observed with empagliflozin treatment (see section 4.8).
Chronic kidney disease
There is experience with empagliflozin for the treatment of diabetes in patients with chronic kidney 
disease (eGFR ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2) both with and without albuminuria. Patients with albuminuria 
may benefit more from treatment with empagliflozin.
7
Urine laboratory assessments
Due to its mechanism of action, patients taking Synjardy will test positive for glucose in their urine.
Interference with 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) assay
Monitoring glycaemic control with 1,5-AG assay is not recommended as measurements of 1,5-AG are 
unreliable in assessing glycaemic control in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. Use of alternative 
methods to monitor glycaemic control is advised.
Vitamin B12
Metformin may reduce vitamin B12 levels. The risk of low vitamin B12 levels increases with
increasing metformin dose, treatment duration, and/or in patients with risk factors known to cause
vitamin B12 deficiency. In case of suspicion of vitamin B12 deficiency (such as anaemia or
neuropathy), vitamin B12 serum levels should be monitored. Periodic vitamin B12 monitoring could
be necessary in patients with risk factors for vitamin B12 deficiency. Metformin therapy should be
continued for as long as it is tolerated and not contra-indicated and appropriate corrective treatment for
vitamin B12 deficiency provided in line with current clinical guidelines.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Co-administration of multiple doses of empagliflozin and metformin does not meaningfully alter the
pharmacokinetics of either empagliflozin or metformin in healthy subjects.
No interaction studies have been performed for Synjardy. The following statements reflect the 
information available on the individual active substances.
Empagliflozin
Pharmacodynamic interactions
Diuretics
Empagliflozin may add to the diuretic effect of thiazide and loop diuretics and may increase the risk of 
dehydration and hypotension (see section 4.4).
Insulin and insulin secretagogues
Insulin and insulin secretagogues, such as sulphonylureas, may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia. 
Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or an insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce the risk of 
hypoglycaemia when used in combination with empagliflozin (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).
Pharmacokinetic interactions
Effects of other medicinal products on empagliflozin
In vitro data suggest that the primary route of metabolism of empagliflozin in humans is 
glucuronidation by uridine 5'-diphosphoglucuronosyltransferases UGT1A3, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, and
UGT2B7. Empagliflozin is a substrate of the human uptake transporters OAT3, OATP1B1, and 
OATP1B3, but not OAT1 and OCT2. Empagliflozin is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast 
cancer resistance protein (BCRP).
Co-administration of empagliflozin with probenecid, an inhibitor of UGT enzymes and OAT3, 
resulted in a 26% increase in peak empagliflozin plasma concentrations (Cmax) and a 53% increase in 
area under the concentration-time curve (AUC). These changes were not considered to be clinically 
meaningful. 
The effect of UGT induction (e.g. induction by rifampicin or phenytoin) on empagliflozin has not been 
studied. Co-treatment with known inducers of UGT enzymes is not recommended due to a potential 
8
risk of decreased efficacy. If an inducer of these UGT enzymes must be co-administered, monitoring 
of glycaemic control to assess response to Synjardy is appropriate.
An interaction study with gemfibrozil, an in vitro inhibitor of OAT3 and OATP1B1/1B3 transporters, 
showed that empagliflozin Cmax increased by 15% and AUC increased by 59% following 
co-administration. These changes were not considered to be clinically meaningful.
Inhibition of OATP1B1/1B3 transporters by co-administration with rifampicin resulted in a 75% 
increase in Cmax and a 35% increase in AUC of empagliflozin. These changes were not considered to 
be clinically meaningful.
Empagliflozin exposure was similar with and without co-administration with verapamil, a P-gp 
inhibitor, indicating that inhibition of P-gp does not have any clinically relevant effect on 
empagliflozin.
Interaction studies suggest that the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin were not influenced by 
co-administration with metformin, glimepiride, pioglitazone, sitagliptin, linagliptin, warfarin, 
verapamil, ramipril, simvastatin, torasemide and hydrochlorothiazide.
Effects of empagliflozin on other medicinal products
Empagliflozin may increase renal lithium excretion and the blood lithium levels may be decreased.
Serum concentration of lithium should be monitored more frequently after empagliflozin initiation and 
dose changes. Please refer the patient to the lithium prescribing doctor in order to monitor serum 
concentration of lithium.
Based on in vitro studies, empagliflozin does not inhibit, inactivate, or induce CYP450 isoforms. 
Empagliflozin does not inhibit UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, or UGT2B7. Drug-drug 
interactions involving the major CYP450 and UGT isoforms with empagliflozin and concomitantly 
administered substrates of these enzymes are therefore considered unlikely. 
Empagliflozin does not inhibit P-gp at therapeutic doses. Based on in vitro studies, empagliflozin is 
considered unlikely to cause interactions with active substances that are P-gp substrates. 
Co-administration of digoxin, a P-gp substrate, with empagliflozin resulted in a 6% increase in AUC 
and 14% increase in Cmax of digoxin. These changes were not considered to be clinically meaningful.
Empagliflozin does not inhibit human uptake transporters such as OAT3, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3 
in vitro at clinically relevant plasma concentrations and, as such, drug-drug interactions with 
substrates of these uptake transporters are considered unlikely.
Interaction studies conducted in healthy volunteers suggest that empagliflozin had no clinically 
relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glimepiride, pioglitazone, sitagliptin, 
linagliptin, simvastatin, warfarin, ramipril, digoxin, diuretics and oral contraceptives.
Metformin
Concomitant use not recommended
Alcohol
Alcohol intoxication is associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis, particularly in cases of
fasting, malnutrition or hepatic impairment.
Organic cation transporters (OCT)
Metformin is a substrate of both transporters OCT1 and OCT2. Co-administration of metformin with 
•
•
Inhibitors of OCT1 (such as verapamil) may reduce efficacy of metformin.
Inducers of OCT1 (such as rifampicin) may increase gastrointestinal absorption and efficacy of 
metformin.
9
•
•
Inhibitors of OCT2 (such as cimetidine, dolutegravir, ranolazine, trimethoprime, vandetanib, 
isavuconazole) may decrease the renal elimination of metformin and thus lead to an increase in 
metformin plasma concentration.
Inhibitors of both OCT1 and OCT2 (such as crizotinib, olaparib) may alter efficacy and renal 
elimination of metformin.
Caution is therefore advised, especially in patients with renal impairment, when these drugs are co-
administered with metformin, as metformin plasma concentration may increase. If needed, dose 
adjustment of metformin may be considered as OCT inhibitors/inducers may alter the efficacy of 
metformin (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
Iodinated contrast agents
Metformin must be discontinued prior to or at the time of the imaging procedure and not restarted until 
at least 48 hours after, provided that renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be stable (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.4).
Combination requiring precautions for use
Some medicinal products can adversely affect renal function which may increase the risk of lactic 
acidosis, e.g. NSAIDs, including selective cyclo-oxygenase (COX) II inhibitors, ACE inhibitors, 
angiotensin II receptor antagonists and diuretics, especially loop diuretics. When starting or using such 
products in combination with metformin, close monitoring of renal function is necessary.
Glucocorticoids (given by systemic and local routes), beta 2 agonists, and diuretics have intrinsic 
hyperglycaemic activity. The patient should be informed and more frequent blood glucose monitoring 
performed, especially at the beginning of treatment with such medicinal products. If necessary, the 
dose of the anti hyperglycaemic medicinal product should be adjusted during therapy with the other 
medicinal product and on its discontinuation.
Insulin and insulin secretagogues
Insulin and insulin secretagogues, such as sulphonylureas, may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia. 
Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or an insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce the risk of 
hypoglycaemia when used in combination with metformin (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There are no data from the use of this medicinal product or empagliflozin in pregnant women. Animal 
studies show that empagliflozin crosses the placenta during late gestation to a very limited extent but 
do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to early embryonic development. 
However, animal studies have shown adverse effects on postnatal development. A limited amount of 
data suggests that the use of metformin in pregnant women is not associated with an increased risk of 
congenital malformations. Animal studies with the combination of empagliflozin and metformin or 
with metformin alone have shown reproductive toxicity at higher doses of metformin only (see section 
5.3). 
When the patient plans to become pregnant, and during pregnancy, it is recommended that diabetes is 
not treated with this medicinal product, but insulin be used to maintain blood glucose levels as close to 
normal as possible, to reduce the risk of malformations of the foetus associated with abnormal blood 
glucose levels.
Breast-feeding
Metformin is excreted into human milk. No effects have been shown in breastfed newborns/infants of 
treated women. No data in humans are available on excretion of empagliflozin into milk. Available 
animal data have shown excretion of empagliflozin and metformin in milk. A risk to the 
newborns/infants cannot be excluded. 
10
This medicinal product should not be used during breast feeding.
Fertility
No studies on the effect on human fertility have been conducted for this medicinal product or 
empagliflozin. Animal studies with empagliflozin and metformin do not indicate direct or indirect 
harmful effects with respect to fertility (see section 5.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Synjardy has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised to 
take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia while driving and using machines, in particular when 
Synjardy is used in combination with a sulphonylurea and/or insulin.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The most commonly reported adverse reactions in clinical trials were hypoglycaemia in combination 
with insulin and/or sulphonylurea and gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, 
abdominal pain and loss of appetite). No additional adverse reactions were identified in clinical trials 
with empagliflozin as add-on to metformin compared to the side effects of the single components.
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
The adverse reactions are listed by absolute frequency. Frequencies are defined as very common 
(≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), or 
very rare (<1/10,000), and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

c Mean changes from baseline in haematocrit were 3.6% and 4.0% for empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg, 
respectively, compared to 0% for placebo. In the EMPA-REG Outcome study, haematocrit values returned 
towards baseline values after a follow-up period of 30 days after treatment stop.
d Pooled data of empagliflozin trials in patients with heart failure (where half of the patients had type 2 diabetes 
mellitus) showed a higher frequency of volume depletion (“very common”: 11.4% for empagliflozin versus 
9.7% for placebo).

Description of selected adverse reactions
Hypoglycaemia
The frequency of hypoglycaemia depended on the background therapy in the respective studies and
was similar for empagliflozin and placebo as add-on to metformin, as add-on to linagliptin and 
metformin, for the combination of empagliflozin with metformin in drug-naïve patients compared to 
those treated with empagliflozin and metformin as individual components, and as adjunct to standard 
care therapy. An increased frequency was noted when empagliflozin given as add-on to metformin and
a sulfonylurea (empagliflozin 10 mg: 16.1%, empagliflozin 25 mg: 11.5% and placebo: 8.4%), or as 
add-on to metformin and insulin (empagliflozin 10 mg: 31.3%, empagliflozin 25 mg: 36.2% and 
placebo: 34.7%). 
Major hypoglycaemia (events requiring assistance)
The overall frequency of patients with major hypoglycaemic events was low (<1%) and similar for
empagliflozin and placebo as add-on to metformin, and for the combination of empagliflozin with 
metformin in drug-naïve patients compared to those treated with empagliflozin and metformin as 
individual components, and as adjunct to standard care therapy. Major hypoglycaemic events occurred 
in 0.5%, 0% and 0.5% of patients treated with empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg and placebo 
when added on to metformin and insulin, respectively. No patient had a major hypoglycaemic event in 
the combination with metformin and a sulphonylurea and as add-on to linagliptin and metformin.
Urinary tract infection
The overall frequency of urinary tract infection adverse events was higher in metformin-treated 
patients who received empagliflozin 10 mg (8.8%) compared to empagliflozin 25 mg (6.6%) or
placebo (7.8%). Similar to placebo, urinary tract infection was reported more frequently for 
empagliflozin in patients with a history of chronic or recurrent urinary tract infections. The intensity of 
urinary tract infections (i.e. mild/moderate/severe) was similar to placebo. Urinary tract infection 
events were reported more frequently for empagliflozin 10 mg compared with placebo in female 
patients, but not for empagliflozin 25 mg. The frequencies of urinary tract infections were low for 
male patients and were balanced across treatment groups.
Vaginal moniliasis, vulvovaginitis, balanitis and other genital infection
Vaginal moniliasis, vulvovaginitis, balanitis and other genital infections were reported more 
frequently in metformin-treated patients who received empagliflozin 10 mg (4.0%) and empagliflozin 
25 mg (3.9%) compared to placebo (1.3%), and were reported more frequently for empagliflozin 
compared to placebo in female patients. The difference in frequency was less pronounced in male 
patients. Genital tract infections were mild and moderate in intensity, none was severe in intensity.
Increased urination
As expected from the mechanism of action, increased urination (as assessed by PT search including 
pollakiuria, polyuria, nocturia) was observed at higher frequencies in metformin-treated patients who 
received empagliflozin 10 mg (3.0%) and empagliflozin 25 mg (2.9%) compared to placebo (1.4%) as 
add-on to metformin therapy. Increased urination was mostly mild or moderate in intensity. The 
frequency of reported nocturia was comparable between placebo and empagliflozin (<1%).
Volume depletion
The overall frequency of volume depletion (including the predefined terms blood pressure 
(ambulatory) decreased, blood pressure systolic decreased, dehydration, hypotension, hypovolaemia, 
orthostatic hypotension, and syncope) in metformin-treated patients who received empagliflozin was 
low: 0.6% for empagliflozin 10 mg, 0.3% for empagliflozin 25 mg and 0.1% for placebo. The effect of 
empagliflozin on urinary glucose excretion is associated with osmotic diuresis, which could affect 
hydration status of patients age 75 years and older. In patients ≥75 years of age volume depletion 
13
events have been reported in a single patient treated with empagliflozin 25 mg as add-on to metformin 
therapy.
Blood creatinine increased/Glomerular filtration rate decreased
The overall frequency of patients with increased blood creatinine and decreased glomerular filtration 
rate were similar between empagliflozin and placebo as add-on to metformin (blood creatinine 
increased: empagliflozin 10 mg 0.5%, empagliflozin 25 mg 0.1%, placebo 0.4%; glomerular filtration 
rate decreased: empagliflozin 10 mg 0.1%, empagliflozin 25 mg 0%, placebo 0.2%).
Initial increases in creatinine and initial decreases in estimated glomerular filtration rates in patients 
treated with empagliflozin as add-on to metformin therapy were generally transient during continuous 
treatment or reversible after drug discontinuation of treatment.
Consistently, in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study, patients treated with empagliflozin experienced 
an initial fall in eGFR (mean: 3 ml/min/1.73 m2). Thereafter, eGFR was maintained during continued 
treatment. Mean eGFR returned to baseline after treatment discontinuation suggesting acute 
haemodynamic changes may play a role in these renal function changes.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
Symptoms
Empagliflozin
In controlled clinical studies single doses of up to 800 mg empagliflozin (equivalent to 32-times the 
highest recommended daily dose) in healthy volunteers and multiple daily doses of up to 100 mg 
empagliflozin (equivalent to 4-times the highest recommended daily dose) in patients with type 2 
diabetes did not show any toxicity. Empagliflozin increased urine glucose excretion leading to an 
increase in urine volume. The observed increase in urine volume was not dose-dependent and is not 
clinically meaningful. There is no experience with doses above 800 mg in humans.
Metformin
Hypoglycaemia has not been seen with metformin doses of up to 85 g, although lactic acidosis has 
occurred in such circumstances. High overdose of metformin or concomitant risks may lead to lactic 
acidosis. Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency and must be treated in hospital (see sections 4.4 and 
4.5). 
Therapy
In the event of an overdose, treatment should be initiated as appropriate to the patient‘s clinical status. 
The most effective method to remove lactate and metformin is haemodialysis. The removal of 
empagliflozin by haemodialysis has not been studied.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, combinations of oral blood glucose lowering 
drugs, ATC code: A10BD20
14
Mechanism of action
Synjardy combines two antihyperglycaemic medicinal products with complementary mechanisms of
action to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: empagliflozin, an inhibitor of 
sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2), and metformin hydrochloride, a member of the biguanide 
class.
Empagliflozin
Empagliflozin is a reversible, highly potent (IC50 of 1.3 nmol) and selective competitive inhibitor of 
SGLT2. Empagliflozin does not inhibit other glucose transporters important for glucose transport into 
peripheral tissues and is 5000-times more selective for SGLT2 versus SGLT1, the major transporter 
responsible for glucose absorption in the gut. SGLT2 is highly expressed in the kidney, whereas 
expression in other tissues is absent or very low. It is responsible, as the predominant transporter, for 
the reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate back into the circulation. In patients with type 
2 diabetes and hyperglycaemia a higher amount of glucose is filtered and reabsorbed.
Empagliflozin improves glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes by reducing renal glucose 
reabsorption. The amount of glucose removed by the kidney through this glucuretic mechanism is 
dependent on blood glucose concentration and GFR. Inhibition of SGLT2 in patients with type 2 
diabetes and hyperglycaemia leads to excess glucose excretion in the urine. In addition, initiation of 
empagliflozin increases excretion of sodium resulting in osmotic diuresis and reduced intravascular 
volume.
In patients with type 2 diabetes, urinary glucose excretion increased immediately following the first 
dose of empagliflozin and is continuous over the 24 hour dosing interval. Increased urinary glucose 
excretion was maintained at the end of the 4-week treatment period, averaging approximately 78 g/day
with empagliflozin 25 mg. Increased urinary glucose excretion resulted in an immediate reduction in 
plasma glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. 
Empagliflozin improves both fasting and post-prandial plasma glucose levels. The mechanism of 
action of empagliflozin is independent of beta cell function and insulin pathway and this contributes to 
a low risk of hypoglycaemia. Improvement of surrogate markers of beta cell function including 
Homeostasis Model Assessment-β (HOMA-β) was noted. In addition, urinary glucose excretion 
triggers calorie loss, associated with body fat loss and body weight reduction. The glucosuria observed 
with empagliflozin is accompanied by mild diuresis which may contribute to sustained and moderate 
reduction of blood pressure. The glucosuria, natriuresis and osmotic diuresis observed with
empagliflozin may contribute to the improvement in cardiovascular outcomes.
Metformin
Metformin is a biguanide with antihyperglycaemic effects, lowering both basal and postprandial 
plasma glucose. It does not stimulate insulin secretion and therefore does not produce hypoglycaemia.
Metformin may act via 3 mechanisms:



reduction of hepatic glucose production by inhibiting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis,
in muscle, by increasing insulin sensitivity, improving peripheral glucose uptake and utilization,
and delay of intestinal glucose absorption.
Metformin stimulates intracellular glycogen synthesis by acting on glycogen synthase. Metformin 
increases the transport capacity of all types of membrane glucose transporters (GLUTs) known to date.
In humans, independently of its action on glycaemia, metformin has favourable effects on lipid 
metabolism. This has been shown at therapeutic doses in controlled, medium-term or long-term
clinical studies: metformin reduces total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels.
15
Clinical efficacy and safety
Both improvement of glycaemic control and reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are 
an integral part of the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
Glycaemic efficacy and cardiovascular outcomes have been assessed in a total of 10,366 patients with 
type 2 diabetes who were treated in 9 double-blind, placebo or active-controlled clinical studies of at 
least 24 weeks duration, of which 2950 patients received empagliflozin 10 mg and 3701 received 
empagliflozin 25 mg as add-on to metformin therapy. Of these, 266 or 264 patients were treated with
empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg as add-on to metformin plus insulin, respectively.
Treatment with empagliflozin in combination with metformin with or without other antidiabetic 
medicinal products (pioglitazone, sulfonylurea, DPP-4 inhibitors, and insulin) led to clinically relevant 
improvements in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), body weight, systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure. Administration of empagliflozin 25 mg resulted in a higher proportion of patients achieving 
HbA1c goal of less than 7% and fewer patients needing glycaemic rescue compared to empagliflozin 
10 mg and placebo. In patients age 75 years and older, numerically lower reductions in HbA1c were 
observed with empagliflozin treatment. Higher baseline HbA1c was associated with a greater 
reduction in HbA1c. In addition, empagliflozin as adjunct to standard care therapy reduced 
cardiovascular mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease.
Empagliflozin as add-on to metformin, sulphonylurea, pioglitazone
Empagliflozin as add-on to metformin, metformin and a sulphonylurea, or pioglitazone and metformin
resulted in statistically significant (p<0.0001) reductions in HbA1c and body weight compared to 
placebo (Table 3). In addition it resulted in a clinically meaningful reduction in FPG, systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure compared to placebo.
In the double-blind placebo-controlled extension of these studies, reduction of HbA1c, body weight 
and blood pressure were sustained up to Week 76.

Empagliflozin in combination with metformin in drug-naïve patients
A factorial design study of 24 weeks duration was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
empagliflozin in drug-naïve patients. Treatment with empagliflozin in combination with metformin 
(5 mg and 500 mg; 5 mg and 1000 mg; 12.5 mg and 500 mg, and 12.5 mg and 1000 mg given twice 
daily) provided statistically significant improvements in HbA1c (Table 4) and led to greater reductions 
in FPG (compared to the individual components) and body weight (compared to metformin).

In a prespecified subgroup of patients with baseline HbA1c greater or equal than 8.5% the reduction

Empagliflozin 24 months data, as add-on to metformin in comparison to glimepiride
In a study comparing the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin 25 mg versus glimepiride (up to 4 mg
per day) in patients with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin alone, treatment with 
empagliflozin daily resulted in superior reduction in HbA1c (Table 6), and a clinically meaningful 
reduction in FPG, compared to glimepiride. Empagliflozin daily resulted in a statistically significant 
reduction in body weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and a statistically significantly lower 
proportion of patients with hypoglycaemic events compared to glimepiride (2.5% for empagliflozin, 
24.2% for glimepiride, p<0.0001).

Add-on to insulin therapy
Empagliflozin as add-on to multiple daily insulin
The efficacy and safety of empagliflozin as add-on to multiple daily insulin with concomitant 
metformin therapy was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 52 weeks duration. 
During the initial 18 weeks and the last 12 weeks, the insulin dose was kept stable, but was adjusted to 
achieve pre-prandial glucose levels <100 mg/dl [5.5 mmol/l], and post-prandial glucose levels 
<140 mg/dl [7.8 mmol/l] between Weeks 19 and 40. 
At Week 18, empagliflozin provided statistically significant improvement in HbA1c compared with 
placebo (Table 7). 
At Week 52, treatment with empagliflozin resulted in a statistically significant decrease in HbA1c and 
insulin sparing compared with placebo and a reduction in body weight.

Empagliflozin as add on to basal insulin
The efficacy and safety of empagliflozin as add on to basal insulin with  concomitant metformin 
therapy was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 78 weeks duration. During the 
initial 18 weeks the insulin dose was kept stable, but was adjusted to achieve a FPG <110 mg/dl in the 
following 60 weeks. 
At week 18, empagliflozin provided statistically significant improvement in HbA1c. A greater 
proportion of patients treated with empagliflozin and with a baseline HbA1c ≥7.0% achieved a target 
HbA1c of <7% compared to placebo (Table 8).
At 78 weeks, the decrease in HbA1c and insulin sparing effect of empagliflozin was maintained.
Furthermore, empagliflozin resulted in a reduction in FPG, body weight and blood pressure.

Empagliflozin and linagliptin as add-on therapy to metformin
In a double-blind trial in patients with inadequate glycemic control, 24-weeks treatment with both 
doses of empagliflozin plus linagliptin as add-on to metformin therapy provided statistically 
significant (p<0.0001) reductions in HbA1c (change from baseline of -1.08% for empagliflozin 10 mg 
plus linagliptin 5 mg, -1.19% for empagliflozin 25 mg plus linagliptin 5 mg, -0.70% for linagliptin 
5 mg). Compared to linagliptin 5 mg, both doses of empagliflozin plus linagliptin 5 mg provided 
statistically significant reductions in FPG and blood pressure. Both doses provided similar statistically 
significant reductions in body weight, expressed as kg and percentage change. A greater proportion of 
patients with a baseline HbA1c ≥7.0% and treated with empagliflozin plus linagliptin achieved a target 
HbA1c of <7% compared to linagliptin 5 mg. Clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c were 
maintained for 52 weeks.
Empagliflozin twice daily versus once daily as add on to metformin therapy
The efficacy and safety of empagliflozin twice daily versus once daily (daily dose of 10 mg and 
25 mg) as add-on therapy in patients with in sufficient glycemic control on metformin monotherapy 
was evaluated in a double blind placebo-controlled study of 16 weeks duration. All treatments with 
empagliflozin resulted in significant reductions in HbA1c from baseline (total mean 7.8%) after 16 
weeks of treatment compared with placebo. Empagliflozin twice daily dose regimens on a background 
of metformin led to comparable reductions in HbA1c versus once daily dose regimens with a 
treatment difference in HbA1c reductions from baseline to week 16 of -0.02% (95% CI -0.16, 0.13) 
for empagliflozin 5 mg twice daily versus 10 mg once daily, and -0.11% (95% CI -0.26, 0.03) for 
empagliflozin 12.5 mg twice daily versus 25 mg once daily.
22
Cardiovascular outcome
The double-blind, placebo-controlled EMPA-REG OUTCOME study compared pooled doses of 
empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg with placebo as adjunct to standard care therapy in patients with 
type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. A total of 7020 patients were treated 
(empagliflozin 10 mg: 2345, empagliflozin 25 mg: 2342, placebo: 2333) and followed for a median of 
3.1 years. The mean age was 63 years, the mean HbA1c was 8.1%, and 71.5% were male. At baseline,
74% of patients were being treated with metformin, 48% with insulin, and 43% with a sulfonylurea. 
About half of the patients (52.2%) had an eGFR of 60-90 ml/min/1.73 m2, 17.8% of 
45-60 ml/min/1.73 m2 and 7.7% of 30-45 ml/min/1.73 m2.
At week 12, an adjusted mean (SE) improvement in HbA1c when compared to baseline of 0.11% 
(0.02) in the placebo group, 0.65% (0.02) and 0.71% (0.02) in the empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg groups 
was observed. After the first 12 weeks glycaemic control was optimized independent of investigative 
treatment. Therefore the effect was attenuated at week 94, with an adjusted mean (SE) improvement in 
HbA1c of 0.08% (0.02) in the placebo group, 0.50% (0.02) and 0.55% (0.02) in the empagliflozin 
10 and 25 mg groups.
Empagliflozin was superior in preventing the primary combined endpoint of cardiovascular death, 
non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke, as compared with placebo. The treatment effect 
was driven by a significant reduction in cardiovascular death with no significant change in non-fatal 
myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke. The reduction of cardiovascular death was comparable for 
empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg (see Figure 1) and confirmed by an improved overall survival (Table 
9). The effect of empagliflozin on the primary combined endpoint of CV death, non-fatal MI, or non-
fatal stroke was largely independent of glycaemic control or renal function (eGFR) and generally 
consistent across eGFR categories down to an eGFR of 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 in the EMPA-REG 
OUTCOME study.
The efficacy for preventing cardiovascular mortality has not been conclusively established in patients 
using empagliflozin concomitantly with DPP-4 inhibitors or in Black patients because the 
representation of these groups in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study was limited.

Heart failure requiring hospitalization 
In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study, empagliflozin reduced the risk of heart failure requiring 
hospitalization compared with placebo (empagliflozin 2.7 %; placebo 4.1 %; HR 0.65, 95 % CI 0.50, 
0.85).
Nephropathy
In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study, for time to first nephropathy event, the HR was 0.61 (95 % CI 
0.53, 0.70) for empagliflozin (12.7 %) vs placebo (18.8 %).
In addition, empagliflozin showed a higher (HR 1.82, 95 % CI 1.40, 2.37) occurrence of sustained 
normo- or micro-albuminuria (49.7 %) in patients with baseline macro-albuminuria compared with 
placebo (28.8 %).
2 hour post-prandial glucose
Treatment with empagliflozin as add-on to metformin or metformin plus sulfonylurea resulted in 
clinically meaningful improvement of 2-hour post-prandial glucose (meal tolerance test) at 24 weeks 
(add-on to metformin, placebo: +5.9 mg/dl, empagliflozin 10 mg: -46.0 mg/dl, empagliflozin 
25 mg: -44.6 mg/dl; add-on to metformin plus sulphonylurea, placebo: -2.3 mg/dl, empagliflozin 
10 mg: -35.7 mg/dl, empagliflozin 25 mg: -36.6 mg/dl).
Patients with baseline HbA1c ≥9%
In a pre-specified analysis of subjects with baseline HbA1c ≥9.0%, treatment with empagliflozin 
10 mg or 25 mg as add-on to metformin resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA1c at 
Week 24 (adjusted mean change from baseline of -1.49% for empagliflozin 25 mg, -1.40% for 
empagliflozin 10 mg, and -0.44% for placebo).
24
Body weight
In a pre-specified pooled analysis of 4 placebo controlled studies, treatment with empagliflozin (68% 
of all patients were on metformin background) resulted in body weight reduction compared to placebo 
at week 24 (-2.04 kg for empagliflozin 10 mg, -2.26 kg for empagliflozin 25 mg and -0.24 kg for 
placebo) that was maintained up to week 52 (-1.96 kg for empagliflozin 10 mg, -2.25 kg for 
empagliflozin 25 mg and -0.16 kg for placebo).
Blood pressure
The efficacy and safety of empagliflozin was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo controlled study of 
12 weeks duration in patients with type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure on different antidiabetic 
and up to 2 antihypertensive therapies. Treatment with empagliflozin once daily resulted in 
statistically significant improvement in HbA1c, and 24 hour mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
as determined by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (Table 10). Treatment with empagliflozin 
provided reductions in seated SBP and DBP.

In a pre-specified pooled analysis of 4 placebo-controlled studies, treatment with empagliflozin (68% 
of all patients were on metformin background) resulted in a reduction in systolic blood pressure 
(empagliflozin 10 mg: -3.9 mmHg, empagliflozin 25 mg: -4.3 mmHg) compared with placebo 
(-0.5 mmHg), and in diastolic blood pressure (empagliflozin 10 mg: -1.8 mmHg, empagliflozin

week 52.
Metformin
The prospective randomised (UKPDS) study has established the long-term benefit of intensive blood 
glucose control in type 2 diabetes. Analysis of the results for overweight patients treated with 
metformin after failure of diet alone showed:

a significant reduction of the absolute risk of any diabetes-related complication in the metformin 
group (29.8 events/1,000 patient-years) versus diet alone (43.3 events/1,000 patient-years), 
p=0.0023, and versus the combined sulphonylurea and insulin monotherapy groups 
(40.1 events/1,000 patient-years), p=0.0034,
a significant reduction of the absolute risk of any diabetes-related mortality: metformin 
7.5 events/1,000 patient-years, diet alone 12.7 events/1,000 patient-years, p=0.017,
a significant reduction of the absolute risk of overall mortality: metformin 
13.5 events/1,000 patient-years versus diet alone 20.6 events/1,000 patient-years, (p=0.011), and 
versus the combined sulphonylurea and insulin monotherapy groups 
18.9 events/1,000 patient-years (p=0.021),
a significant reduction in the absolute risk of myocardial infarction: metformin 
11 events/1,000 patient-years, diet alone 18 events/1,000 patient-years, (p=0.01).

Paediatric population
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Synjardy in all subsets of the paediatric population in type 2 diabetes (see section 4.2 for information 
on paediatric use).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Synjardy
The results of bioequivalence studies in healthy subjects demonstrated that Synjardy
(empagliflozin/metformin hydrochloride) 5 mg/850 mg, 5 mg/1,000 mg, 12.5 mg/850 mg, and 
12.5 mg/1,000 mg combination tablets are bioequivalent to co-administration of corresponding doses 
of empagliflozin and metformin as individual tablets.
Administration of empagliflozin/metformin 12.5 mg/1,000 mg under fed conditions resulted in 9% 
decrease in AUC and a 28% decrease in Cmax for empagliflozin, when compared to fasted conditions. 
For metformin, AUC decreased by 12% and Cmax decreased by 26% compared to fasting conditions. 
The observed effect of food on empagliflozin and metformin is not considered to be clinically 
relevant. However, as metformin is recommended to be given with meals, Synjardy is also proposed to 
be given with food.
The following statements reflect the pharmacokinetic properties of the individual active substances of 
Synjardy.
Empagliflozin
Absorption
The pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin have been extensively characterised in healthy volunteers and 
patients with type 2 diabetes. After oral administration, empagliflozin was rapidly absorbed with peak 
plasma concentrations occurring at a median tmax of 1.5 hours post-dose. Thereafter, plasma 
26
concentrations declined in a biphasic manner with a rapid distribution phase and a relatively slow 
terminal phase. The steady state mean plasma AUC and Cmax were 1870 nmol.h/l and 259 nmol/l with 
empagliflozin 10 mg and 4740 nmol.h/l and 687 nmol/l with empagliflozin 25 mg once daily. 
Systemic exposure of empagliflozin increased in a dose-proportional manner. The single-dose and 
steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of empagliflozin were similar suggesting linear 
pharmacokinetics with respect to time. There were no clinically relevant differences in empagliflozin 
pharmacokinetics between healthy volunteers and patients with type 2 diabetes.
The pharmacokinetics of 5 mg empagliflozin twice daily and 10 mg empagliflozin once daily were 
compared in healthy subjects. Overall exposure (AUCss) of empagliflozin over a 24-hour period with 
empagliflozin 5 mg administered twice daily was similar to empagliflozin 10 mg administered once 
daily. As expected, empagliflozin 5 mg administered twice daily compared with 10 mg empagliflozin 
once daily resulted in lower Cmax and higher trough plasma empagliflozin concentrations (Cmin).
Administration of empagliflozin 25 mg after intake of a high-fat and high calorie meal resulted in 
slightly lower exposure; AUC decreased by approximately 16% and Cmax by approximately 37% 
compared to fasted condition. The observed effect of food on empagliflozin pharmacokinetics was not 
considered clinically relevant and empagliflozin may be administered with or without food. Similar 
results were obtained when Synjardy (empagliflozin/metformin) combination tablets were 
administered with high-fat and high calorie meal.
Distribution
The apparent steady-state volume of distribution was estimated to be 73.8 l based on the population 
pharmacokinetic analysis. Following administration of an oral [14C]-empagliflozin solution to healthy 
volunteers, the red blood cell partitioning was approximately 37% and plasma protein binding was 
86%.
Biotransformation
No major metabolites of empagliflozin were detected in human plasma, as defined by at least 10% of 
total drug-related material, and the most abundant metabolites were three glucuronide conjugates (2-, 
3-, and 6-O-glucuronide). In vitro studies suggested that the primary route of metabolism of 
empagliflozin in humans is glucuronidation by the uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases 
UGT2B7, UGT1A3, UGT1A8, and UGT1A9.
Elimination
Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, the apparent terminal elimination half-life of 
empagliflozin was estimated to be 12.4 hours and apparent oral clearance was 10.6 l/hour. The 
inter-subject and residual variabilities for empagliflozin oral clearance were 39.1% and 35.8%, 
respectively. With once-daily dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations of empagliflozin were 
reached by the fifth dose. Consistent with the half-life, up to 22% accumulation, with respect to 
plasma AUC, was observed at steady-state. Following administration of an oral [14C]-empagliflozin 
solution to healthy volunteers, approximately 96% of the drug-related radioactivity was eliminated in 
faeces (41%) or urine (54%). The majority of drug-related radioactivity recovered in faeces was 
unchanged parent drug and approximately half of drug-related radioactivity excreted in urine was 
unchanged parent drug.
Special populations
Renal impairment
In patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 - <90 ml/min) 
and patients with kidney failure/end stage renal disease (ESRD), AUC of empagliflozin increased by 
approximately 18%, 20%, 66%, and 48%, respectively compared to subjects with normal renal 
function. Peak plasma levels of empagliflozin were similar in subjects with moderate renal impairment 
and kidney failure/ESRD compared to patients with normal renal function. Peak plasma levels of 
27
empagliflozin were roughly 20% higher in subjects with mild and severe renal impairment as 
compared to subjects with normal renal function. The population pharmacokinetic analysis showed 
that the apparent oral clearance of empagliflozin decreased with a decrease in creatinine clearance
leading to an increase in drug exposure.
Hepatic impairment
In subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment according to the Child-Pugh 
classification, AUC of empagliflozin increased approximately by 23%, 47%, and 75% and Cmax by 
approximately 4%, 23%, and 48%, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function.
Body Mass Index
Body mass index had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin based on 
the population pharmacokinetic analysis. In this analysis, AUC was estimated to be 5.82%, 10.4%, and 
17.3% lower in subjects with BMI of 30, 35, and 45 kg/m2, respectively, compared to subjects with a 
body mass index of 25 kg/m2.
Gender
Gender had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin based on the 
population pharmacokinetic analysis.
Race
In the population pharmacokinetic analysis, AUC was estimated to be 13.5% higher in Asians with a 
body mass index of 25 kg/m2 compared to non-Asians with a body mass index of 25 kg/m2.
Elderly 
Age did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin based on 
the population pharmacokinetic analysis.
Paediatric population
A paediatric Phase 1 study examined the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of empagliflozin 
(5 mg, 10 mg and 25 mg) in children and adolescents ≥10 to <18 years of age with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus. The observed pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses were consistent with those 
found in adult subjects.
Metformin
Absorption
After an oral dose of metformin, tmax is reached in 2.5 hours. Absolute bioavailability of a 500 mg or
850 mg metformin hydrochloride tablet is approximately 50-60% in healthy subjects. After an oral
dose, the non-absorbed fraction recovered in faeces was 20-30%. After oral administration, metformin 
absorption is saturable and incomplete. It is assumed that the pharmacokinetics of metformin 
absorption are non-linear. At the recommended metformin doses and dosing schedules, steady-state 
plasma concentrations are reached within 24 to 48 hours and are generally less than 1 microgram/ml. 
In controlled clinical trials, maximum metformin plasma levels (Cmax) did not exceed 5 microgram/ml, 
even at maximum doses.
Food decreases the extent and slightly delays the absorption of metformin. Following administration 
of a dose of 850 mg metformin hydrochloride, a 40% lower plasma peak concentration, a 25% 
decrease in AUC and a 35 minute prolongation of the time to peak plasma concentration were
observed. The clinical relevance of these decreases is unknown.
Distribution
Plasma protein binding is negligible. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes. The blood peak is lower 
than the plasma peak and appears at approximately the same time. The red blood cells most likely 
28
represent a secondary compartment of distribution. The mean volume of distribution (Vd) ranged 
between 63 - 276 l.
Biotransformation
Metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine. No metabolites have been identified in humans.
Elimination
Renal clearance of metformin is >400 ml/min, indicating that metformin is eliminated by glomerular 
filtration and tubular secretion. Following an oral dose, the apparent terminal elimination half-life is 
approximately 6.5 hours.
When renal function is impaired, renal clearance is decreased in proportion to that of creatinine and
thus the elimination half-life is prolonged, leading to increased levels of metformin in plasma.
Special populations
Paediatric population
Single dose study: after single doses of metformin hydrochloride 500 mg, paediatric patients have
shown a similar pharmacokinetic profile to that observed in healthy adults.
Multiple-dose study: After repeated doses of 500 mg twice daily for 7 days in paediatric patients the 
peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and systemic exposure (AUC0-t) were approximately 33% and 40%
lower, respectively, compared to diabetic adults who received repeated doses of 500 mg twice daily 
for 14 days. As the dose is individually titrated based on glycaemic control, this is of limited clinical 
relevance.

Empagliflozin and metformin
General toxicity studies in rats of up to 13 weeks were performed with the combination of
empagliflozin and metformin and did not reveal any additional target organs when compared to 
empagliflozin or metformin alone. Some responses were increased by the combination treatment, such 
as effects on renal physiology, electrolyte balance and acid/base state. However, only hypochloremia 
was considered adverse at exposures of approximately 9- and 3-times the clinical AUC exposure of 
the maximum recommended dose of empagliflozin and metformin, respectively.
An embryofetal development study in pregnant rats did not indicate a teratogenic effect attributed to 
the co-administration of empagliflozin and metformin at exposures of approximately 14-times the 
clinical AUC exposure of empagliflozin associated with the highest dose, and 4-times the clinical 
AUC exposure of metformin associated with the 2000 mg dose.
Empagliflozin
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, genotoxicity, fertility and early embryonic development. 
In long term toxicity studies in rodents and dogs, signs of toxicity were observed at exposures greater 
than or equal to 10-times the clinical dose of empagliflozin. Most toxicity was consistent with 
secondary pharmacology related to urinary glucose loss and electrolyte imbalances including
decreased body weight and body fat, increased food consumption, diarrhoea, dehydration, decreased 
serum glucose and increases in other serum parameters reflective of increased protein metabolism and
gluconeogenesis, urinary changes such as polyuria and glucosuria, and microscopic changes including 
mineralisation in kidney and some soft and vascular tissues. Microscopic evidence of the effects of 
exaggerated pharmacology on the kidney observed in some species included tubular dilatation, and 
29
tubular and pelvic mineralisation at approximately 4-times the clinical AUC exposure of empagliflozin 
associated with the 25 mg dose.
Empagliflozin is not genotoxic.
In a 2-year carcinogenicity study, empagliflozin did not increase the incidence of tumours in female 
rats up to the highest dose of 700 mg/kg/day, which corresponds to approximately 72-times the 
maximal clinical AUC exposure to empagliflozin. In male rats, treatment-related benign vascular 
proliferative lesions (haemangiomas) of the mesenteric lymph node were observed at the highest dose, 
but not at 300 mg/kg/day, which corresponds to approximately 26-times the maximal clinical exposure 
to empagliflozin. Interstitial cell tumours in the testes were observed with a higher incidence in rats at 
300 mg/kg/day and above, but not at 100 mg/kg/day which corresponds to approximately 18-times the 
maximal clinical exposure to empagliflozin. Both tumours are common in rats and are unlikely to be 
relevant to humans.
Empagliflozin did not increase the incidence of tumours in female mice at doses up to 
1,000 mg/kg/day, which corresponds to approximately 62-times the maximal clinical exposure to
empagliflozin. Empagliflozin induced renal tumours in male mice at 1,000 mg/kg/day, but not at 
300 mg/kg/day, which corresponds to approximately 11-times the maximal clinical exposure to
empagliflozin. The mode of action for these tumours is dependent on the natural predisposition of the 
male mouse to renal pathology and a metabolic pathway not reflective of humans. The male mouse 
renal tumours are considered not relevant to humans.
At exposures sufficiently in excess of exposure in humans after therapeutic doses, empagliflozin had 
no adverse effects on fertility or early embryonic development. Empagliflozin administered during the 
period of organogenesis was not teratogenic. Only at maternally toxic doses, empagliflozin also 
caused bent limb bones in the rat and increased embryofetal loss in the rabbit.
In pre- and postnatal toxicity studies in rats, reduced weight gain of offspring was observed at 
maternal exposures approximately 4-times the maximal clinical exposure to empagliflozin. No such 
effect was seen at systemic exposure equal to the maximal clinical exposure to empagliflozin. The 
relevance of this finding to humans is unclear.
In a juvenile toxicity study in the rat, when empagliflozin was administered from postnatal day 21 
until postnatal day 90, non-adverse, minimal to mild renal tubular and pelvic dilation in juvenile rats 
was seen only at 100 mg/kg/day, which approximates 11-times the maximum clinical dose of 25 mg. 
These findings were absent after a 13 weeks drug-free recovery period.
Metformin
Preclinical data for metformin reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of
safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, or carcinogenic potential or reproductive
toxicity. At dose levels of 500 mg/kg/day administered to Wistar Hannover rats, associated with 
7-times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of metformin, teratogenicity of metformin 
was observed, mostly evident as an increase in the number of skeletal malformations.

Possible side effects
1. What Synjardy is and what it is used for
What Synjardy is
Synjardy contains two active substances empagliflozin and metformin. Each belongs to a group of 
medicines called “oral anti-diabetics”. These are medicines taken by mouth to treat type 2 diabetes. 
What is type 2 diabetes?
Type 2 diabetes is a disease that comes from both your genes and your lifestyle. If you have type 2 
diabetes, your pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose in your blood, 
and your body is unable to use its own insulin effectively. This results in high levels of glucose in your 
blood which can lead to medical problems like heart disease, kidney disease, blindness, and poor 
circulation in your limbs.
How Synjardy works
Empagliflozin belongs to a group of medicines called sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) 
inhibitors. It works by blocking the SGLT2 protein in your kidneys. This causes blood sugar (glucose) 
to be removed in your urine. Metformin works in a different way to lower blood sugar levels, mainly 
by blocking glucose production in the liver. 
Thereby Synjardy lowers the amount of sugar in your blood. This medicine can also help prevent heart 
disease. 
What Synjardy is used for

Synjardy is added to diet and exercise to treat type 2 diabetes in adult patients (aged 18 years 
and older) whose diabetes cannot be controlled by adding metformin alone or metformin with 
other medicines for diabetes.

Synjardy can also be combined with other medicines for the treatment of diabetes. These may 
be medicines taken by mouth or given by injection such as insulin.
67

In addition, Synjardy can be used as an alternative to taking both empagliflozin and metformin 
as single tablets. To avoid overdose, do not continue taking empagliflozin and metformin tablets
separately, if you are taking this medicine.
It is important that you continue with your diet and exercise plan as told by your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse.
2. What you need to know before you take Synjardy
Do not take Synjardy

if you are allergic to empagliflozin, metformin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6);
if you have uncontrolled diabetes, with, for example, severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood 
glucose), nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rapid weight loss, lactic acidosis (see ‘Risk of lactic 
acidosis’ below) or ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis is a condition in which substances called ‘ketone 
bodies’ accumulate in the blood and which can lead to diabetic pre-coma. Symptoms include 
stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or your breath developing an unusual fruity 
smell;
if you have had a diabetic pre-coma;
if you have serious kidney problems. Your doctor may limit your daily dose or ask you to take a 
different medicine (see also section 3, ‘How to take Synjardy’).
if you have a severe infection such as an infection affecting your lung or bronchial system or 
your kidney. Severe infections may lead to kidney problems, which can put you at risk for lactic 
acidosis (see 'Warnings and precautions');
if you have lost a lot of water from your body (dehydration), e.g. due to long-lasting or severe 
diarrhoea, or if you have vomited several times in a row. Dehydration may lead to kidney 
problems, which can put you at risk for lactic acidosis (see 'Warnings and precautions');
if you are treated for acute heart failure or have recently had a heart attack, have severe 
problems with your circulation (such as shock) or have breathing difficulties. This may lead to a 
lack in oxygen supply to tissue which can put you at risk for lactic acidosis (see section 
‘Warnings and precautions');
if you have problems with your liver;
if you drink large amounts of alcohol, either every day or only from time to time (see section 
“Synjardy with alcohol”).

Warnings and precautions
Risk of lactic acidosis
Synjardy may cause a very rare, but very serious side effect called lactic acidosis, particularly if your 
kidneys are not working properly. The risk of developing lactic acidosis is also increased with
uncontrolled diabetes, serious infections, prolonged fasting or alcohol intake, dehydration (see further 
information below), liver problems and any medical conditions in which a part of the body has a 
reduced supply of oxygen (such as acute severe heart diseases).
If any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor for further instructions.
Stop taking Synjardy for a short time if you have a condition that may be associated with 
dehydration (significant loss of body fluids) such as severe vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, exposure to 
heat or if you drink less fluid than normal. Talk to your doctor for further instructions.
Stop taking Synjardy and contact a doctor or the nearest hospital immediately if you experience 
some of the symptoms of lactic acidosis, as this condition may lead to coma. 
Symptoms of lactic acidosis include:



vomiting
stomach ache (abdominal pain)
muscle cramps
68



a general feeling of not being well with severe tiredness
difficulty in breathing
reduced body temperature and heartbeat
Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency and must be treated in a hospital.
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking this medicine, and during treatment:

if you experience rapid weight loss, feeling sick or being sick, stomach pain, excessive thirst, 
fast and deep breathing, confusion, unusual sleepiness or tiredness, a sweet smell to your breath, 
a sweet or metallic taste in your mouth, or a different odour to your urine or sweat, contact a 
doctor or the nearest hospital straight away. These symptoms could be a sign of “diabetic 
ketoacidosis” – a rare, but serious, sometines life-threatening problem you can get with diabetes 
because of increased levels of “ketone bodies” in your urine or blood, seen in tests. The risk of 
developing diabetic ketoacidosis may be increased with prolonged fasting, excessive alcohol 
consumption, dehydration, sudden reductions in insulin dose, or a higher need of insulin due to 
major surgery or serious illness;
if you have “type 1 diabetes” – this type usually starts when you are young and your body does 
not produce any insulin. You should not take Synjardy if you have type 1 diabetes;
might be at risk of dehydration, for example:
o
o
if you are being sick, have diarrhoea or fever, or if you are not able to eat or drink
if you are taking medicines that increase urine production [diuretics] or lower blood 
pressure
o if you are 75 years old or older.
Possible signs are listed in section 4 under ‘dehydration’. Your doctor may ask you to stop taking 
Synjardy until you recover to prevent loss of too much body fluid. Ask about ways to prevent 
dehydration. 
if you have a serious infection of the kidney or the urinary tract with fever. Your doctor may ask 
you to stop taking Synjardy until you have recovered;
if you need to undergo an examination with iodination contrast agents (such as X-ray or scan). 
More information is given below in “Other medicines and Synjardy”.




Talk to your doctor immediately if you develop a combination of symptoms of pain, tenderness, 
redness, or swelling of the genitals or the area between the genitals and the anus with fever or feeling 
generally unwell. These symptoms could be a sign of a rare but serious or even life-threatening 
infection, called necrotising fasciitis of the perineum or Fournier´s gangrene which destroys the tissue 
under the skin. Fournier’s gangrene has to be treated immediately.
Surgery
If you need to have major surgery you must stop taking Synjardy during and for some time after the 
procedure. Your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with 
Synjardy.
Kidney function
During treatment with Synjardy, your doctor will check your kidney function at least once a year or 
more frequently if you are elderly and/or if you have worsening kidney function.
Foot care
Like for all diabetic patients it is important to check your feet regularly and adhere to any other advice 
regarding foot care given by your health care professional.
Urine glucose
Because of how this medicine works, your urine will test positive for sugar while you are taking this 
medicine.
69
Children and adolescents
This medicine is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years, because it has 
not been studied in these patients.
Other medicines and Synjardy
If you need to have an injection of a contrast medium that contains iodine into your bloodstream, for 
example in the context of an X-ray or scan, you must stop taking Synjardy before or at the time of the 
injection. Your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with 
Synjardy.
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. You may 
need more frequent blood glucose and kidney function tests, or your doctor may need to adjust the 
dosage of Synjardy. It is especially important to mention the following:

medicines which increase urine production (diuretics), as Synjardy may increase the risk of 
losing too much fluid. Your doctor may ask you to stop taking Synjardy. Possible signs of 
losing too much fluid from your body are listed in section 4.
other medicines that lower the amount of sugar in your blood such as insulin or a 
“sulphonylurea” medicine. Your doctor may want to lower the dose of these other medicines, to 
prevent your blood sugar levels from getting too low (hypoglycaemia).
medicines that may change the amount of metformin in your blood, especially if you have 
reduced kidney function (such as verapamil, rifampicin, cimetidine, dolutegravir, ranolazine, 
trimethoprime, vandetanib, isavuconazole, crizotinib, olaparib).
bronchodilators (beta-2 agonists) which are used to treat asthma.
corticosteroids (given by mouth, as an injection, or inhaled), which are used to treat 
inflammation in diseases like asthma and arthritis.
medicines used to treat pain and inflammation (NSAID and COX-2-inhibitors, such as 
ibuprofen and celecoxib).
certain medicines for the treatment of high blood pressure (ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II 
receptor antagonists).
medicines that contain alcohol (see section ‘Synjardy with alcohol’).
iodinated contrast agents (medicines used during an X-ray, see section ‘Warnings and 
precautions’.
if you are taking lithium because Synjardy can lower the amount of lithium in your blood.









Synjardy with alcohol
Avoid excessive alcohol intake while taking Synjardy since this may increase the risk of lactic acidosis
(see section ‘Warnings and precautions’).
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
Do not take Synjardy if you are pregnant. It is unknown if this medicine is harmful to the unborn 
child.
Metformin passes into human milk in small amounts. It is not known whether empagliflozin passes 
into human breast milk. Do not take Synjardy if you are breast-feeding.
Driving and using machines
Synjardy has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Taking this medicine in combination with medicines called sulphonylureas or with insulin can cause 
blood sugar levels to drop too low (hypoglycaemia), which may cause symptoms such as shaking, 
sweating and change in vision, and may affect your ability to drive and use machines. Do not drive or 
use any tools or machines if you feel dizzy while taking Synjardy.

How to take Synjardy
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist
if you are not sure.
How much to take
The dose of Synjardy varies depending on your condition and the doses of diabetes medicines you 
currently take. Your doctor will adjust your dose as necessary and tell you exactly which strength of 
the medicine to take.
The recommended dose is one tablet twice a day. Your doctor will normally start Synjardy treatment 
by prescribing the strength of tablet that supplies the same dose of metformin you are already taking 
(850 mg or 1,000 mg twice a day), and the lowest dose of empagliflozin (5 mg twice a day). If you are 
already taking both medicines separately, your doctor will start treatment with tablets of Synjardy that 
will supply the same amount of both. If you have reduced kidney function, your doctor may prescribe 
a lower dose or decide to use an alternative medicine.
Taking this medicine



Swallow the tablet whole with water.
Take the tablets with meals to lower your chance of an upset stomach.
Take the tablet twice daily by mouth.
Your doctor may prescribe Synjardy together with another diabetes medicine. Remember to take all 
medicines as directed by your doctor to achieve the best results for your health. Your doctor may need 
to adjust your doses to control your blood sugar.
Appropriate diet and exercise help your body use its blood sugar better. It is important to stay on the 
diet and exercise program recommended by your doctor while taking Synjardy.
If you take more Synjardy than you should
If you take more Synjardy tablets than you should have, you may experience lactic acidosis. 
Symptoms of lactic acidosis are non-specific such as feeling or being very sick, vomiting, stomach 
ache with muscle cramps, a general feeling of not being well with severe tiredness, and difficulty in 
breathing. Further symptoms are reduced body temperature and heartbeat. If this happens to you, you 
may need immediate hospital treatment, as lactic acidosis can lead to coma. Stop taking this 
medicine immediately and contact a doctor or the nearest hospital straight away (see section 2). 
Take the medicine pack with you.
If you forget to take Synjardy
If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If you do not remember until it is time for your 
next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular schedule. Do not take a double dose of this 
medicine.
If you stop taking Synjardy
Do not stop taking Synjardy without first consulting your doctor. Your blood sugar levels may increase 
when you stop taking Synjardy.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
Comirnaty 30 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection 
COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine 
2.  QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 
This is a multidose vial with a purple cap and must be diluted before use.  
One vial (0.45 mL) contains 6 doses of 0.3 mL after dilution, see sections 4.2 and 6.6. 
One dose (0.3 mL) contains 30 micrograms of tozinameran, a COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine (nucleoside 
modified, embedded in lipid nanoparticles).  
Tozinameran is a single-stranded, 5’-capped messenger RNA (mRNA) produced using a cell-free 
in vitro transcription from the corresponding DNA templates, encoding the viral spike (S) protein of 
SARS-CoV-2. 
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Concentrate for dispersion for injection (sterile concentrate). 
The vaccine is a white to off-white frozen dispersion (pH: 6.9 - 7.9). 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Comirnaty 30 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is indicated for active 
immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, in individuals 12 years of age and older.  
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Individuals 12 years of age and older 
Comirnaty is administered intramuscularly after dilution as a single dose of 0.3 mL for individuals 
12 years of age and older regardless of prior COVID-19 vaccination status (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
For individuals who have previously been vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty should be 
administered at least 3 months after the most recent dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.  
Severely immunocompromised aged 12 years and older 
Additional doses may be administered to individuals who are severely immunocompromised in 
accordance with national recommendations (see section 4.4).

Paediatric population 
There are paediatric formulations available for infants aged 6 months and above and children below 
12 years of age. For details, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for other 
formulations. 
The safety and efficacy of the vaccine in infants aged less than 6 months have not yet been 
established. 
Elderly population 
No dose adjustment is required in elderly individuals ≥ 65 years of age. 
Method of administration 
Comirnaty 30 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection should be administered 
intramuscularly after dilution (see section 6.6). 
After dilution, vials of Comirnaty contain 6 doses of 0.3 mL of vaccine. In order to extract 6 doses 
from a single vial, low dead-volume syringes and/or needles should be used. The low dead-volume 
syringe and needle combination should have a dead volume of no more than 35 microlitres. If standard 
syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract a sixth dose from a single 
vial. Irrespective of the type of syringe and needle: 
• 
• 
Each dose must contain 0.3 mL of vaccine. 
If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.3 mL, discard the 
vial and any excess volume.  
Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials. 
• 
The preferred site is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. 
Do not inject the vaccine intravascularly, subcutaneously or intradermally.  
The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products. 
For precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4. 
For instructions regarding thawing, handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability  
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
General recommendations 
Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis 
Events of anaphylaxis have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should 
always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the 
vaccine.  
Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. No further dose of 
the vaccine should be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis after a prior dose of 
Comirnaty.

Myocarditis and pericarditis 
There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Comirnaty. These 
conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 
14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger 
males (see section 4.8). Available data indicate that most cases recover. Some cases required intensive 
care support and fatal cases have been observed. 
Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. 
Vaccinees (including parents or caregivers) should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention 
if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest 
pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination. 
Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this 
condition. 
Anxiety-related reactions 
Anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress‐related 
reactions (e.g. dizziness, palpitations, increases in heart rate, alterations in blood pressure, 
paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia and sweating) may occur in association with the vaccination process itself. 
Stress-related reactions are temporary and resolve on their own. Individuals should be advised to bring 
symptoms to the attention of the vaccination provider for evaluation. It is important that precautions 
are in place to avoid injury from fainting. 
Concurrent illness 
Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute 
infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination. 
Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders 
As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals 
receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as 
haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in 
these individuals. 
Immunocompromised individuals 
The efficacy and safety of the vaccine has not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, 
including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of Comirnaty may be lower in 
immunocompromised individuals. 
Duration of protection 
The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by 
ongoing clinical trials. 
Limitations of vaccine effectiveness 
As with any vaccine, vaccination with Comirnaty may not protect all vaccine recipients. Individuals 
may not be fully protected until 7 days after their vaccination. 
Excipients 
This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘potassium-free’.  
This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
Concomitant administration of Comirnaty with other vaccines has not been studied. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
A large amount of observational data from pregnant women vaccinated with Comirnaty during the 
second and third trimester have not shown an increase in adverse pregnancy outcomes. While data on 
pregnancy outcomes following vaccination during the first trimester are presently limited, no 
increased risk for miscarriage has been seen. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful 
effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition or post-natal development 
(see section 5.3). Comirnaty can be used during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
No effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of 
breast-feeding woman to Comirnaty is negligible. Observational data from women who were 
breast-feeding after vaccination have not shown a risk for adverse effects in breastfed 
newborns/infants. Comirnaty can be used during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Comirnaty has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of 
the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile 
Participants 16 years of age and older – after 2 doses 
In Study 2, a total of 22 026 participants 16 years of age or older received at least 1 dose of Comirnaty 
and a total of 22 021 participants 16 years of age or older received placebo (including 138 and 
145 adolescents 16 and 17 years of age in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively). A total of 
20 519 participants 16 years of age or older received 2 doses of Comirnaty.  
At the time of the analysis of Study 2 with a data cut-off of 13 March 2021 for the placebo-controlled 
blinded follow-up period up to the participants’ unblinding dates, a total of 25 651 (58.2%) 
participants (13 031 Comirnaty and 12 620 placebo) 16 years of age and older were followed up for 
≥ 4 months after the second dose. This included a total of 15 111 (7 704 Comirnaty and 7 407 placebo) 
participants 16 to 55 years of age and a total of 10 540 (5 327 Comirnaty and 5 213 placebo) 
participants 56 years of age and older. 
The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 16 years of age and older that received 2 doses 
were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 50%), myalgia (> 40%), chills 
(> 30%), arthralgia (> 20%), pyrexia and injection site swelling (> 10%) and were usually mild or 
moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of 
reactogenicity events was associated with greater age.

The safety profile in 545 participants 16 years of age and older receiving Comirnaty, that were 
seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, was similar to that seen in the general population. 
Adolescents 12 to 15 years of age – after 2 doses 
In an analysis of long-term safety follow-up in Study 2, 2 260 adolescents (1 131 Comirnaty and 
1 129 placebo) were 12 to 15 years of age. Of these, 1 559 adolescents (786 Comirnaty and 
773 placebo) have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. 
The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age was similar to that seen in 
participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in adolescents 12 to 
15 years of age that received 2 doses were injection site pain (> 90%), fatigue and headache (> 70%), 
myalgia and chills (> 40%), arthralgia and pyrexia (> 20%). 
Participants 12 years of age and older – after booster dose 
A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 306 adults 18 to 55 years of age who completed the 
original Comirnaty 2-dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 6 months 
(range of 4.8 to 8.0 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, 
had a median follow-up time of 8.3 months (range 1.1 to 8.5 months) and 301 participants had been 
followed for ≥ 6 months after the booster dose to the cut-off date (22 November 2021). 
The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after 2 doses. The most frequent 
adverse reactions in participants 18 to 55 years of age were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue 
(> 60%), headache (> 40%), myalgia (> 30%), chills and arthralgia (> 20%).  
In Study 4, a placebo-controlled booster study, participants 16 years of age and older recruited from 
Study 2 received a booster dose of Comirnaty (5 081 participants), or placebo (5 044 participants) at 
least 6 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, 
had a median follow-up time of 2.8 months (range 0.3 to 7.5 months) after the booster dose in the 
blinded placebo-controlled follow-up period to the cut-off date (8 February 2022). Of these, 
1 281 participants (895 Comirnaty and 386 placebo) have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the 
booster dose of Comirnaty. No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified. 
A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 825 adolescents 12 to 15 years of age who completed 
the original Comirnaty 2-dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 
11.2 months (range of 6.3 to 20.1 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a 
booster dose, had a median follow-up time of 9.5 months (range 1.5 to 10.7 months) based on data up 
to the cut-off date (3 November 2022). No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified. 
Participants 12 years of age and older – after subsequent booster doses 
The safety of a booster dose of Comirnaty in participants 12 years of age and older is inferred from 
safety data from studies of a booster dose of Comirnaty in participants 18 years of age and older. 
A subset of 325 adults 18 to ≤ 55 years of age who had completed 3 doses of Comirnaty, received a 
booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 90 to 180 days after receiving Dose 3. Participants who received a 
booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty had a median follow-up time of 1.4 months up to a data cut-off 
date of 11 March 2022. The most frequent adverse reactions in these participants were injection site 
pain (> 70%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 40%), myalgia and chills (> 20%), and arthralgia (> 10%).  
In a subset from Study 4 (Phase 3), 305 adults > 55 years of age who had completed 3 doses of 
Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 5 to 12 months after receiving Dose 3. 
Participants who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty had a median follow-up time of at least 
1.7 months up to a data cut-off date of 16 May 2022. The overall safety profile for the Comirnaty 
booster (fourth dose) was similar to that seen after the Comirnaty booster (third dose). The most 
frequent adverse reactions in participants > 55 years of age were injection site pain (> 60%), 
fatigue (> 40%), headache (> 20%), myalgia and chills (> 10%).

Booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine  
In 5 independent studies on the use of a Comirnaty booster dose in individuals who had completed 
primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose), no new 
safety issues were identified (see section 5.1).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Myocarditis and pericarditis 
The increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty is highest in younger males (see 
section 4.4). 
Two large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have estimated the excess risk in younger 
males following the second dose of Comirnaty. One study showed that in a period of 7 days after the 
second dose there were about 0.265 (95% CI 0.255 - 0.275) extra cases of myocarditis in 12-29 year 
old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. In another study, in a period of 28 days after the 
second dose there were 0.56 (95% CI 0.37 - 0.74) extra cases of myocarditis in 16-24 year old males 
per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. 
Limited data indicate that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty in 
children aged 5 to 11 years seems lower than in ages 12 to 17 years. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V and include batch/Lot number if available. 
4.9  Overdose 
Overdose data is available from 52 study participants included in the clinical trial that due to an error 
in dilution received 58 micrograms of Comirnaty. The vaccine recipients did not report an increase in 
reactogenicity or adverse reactions.  
In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is 
recommended. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BN01 
Mechanism of action 
The nucleoside-modified messenger RNA in Comirnaty is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which 
enable delivery of the non-replicating RNA into host cells to direct transient expression of the 
SARS-CoV-2 S antigen. The mRNA codes for membrane-anchored, full-length S with two point 
mutations within the central helix. Mutation of these two amino acids to proline locks S in an 
antigenically preferred prefusion conformation. The vaccine elicits both neutralizing antibody and 
cellular immune responses to the spike (S) antigen, which may contribute to protection against 
COVID-19. 
Efficacy 
Study 2 is a multicentre, multinational, Phase 1/2/3 randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind 
dose-finding, vaccine candidate selection and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. 
Randomisation was stratified by age: 12 to 15 years of age, 16 to 55 years of age, or 56 years of age 
and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the ≥ 56-year stratum. The study excluded 
participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological 
diagnosis of COVID-19. Participants with pre-existing stable disease, defined as disease not requiring 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before 
enrolment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV).  
Efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older – after 2 doses 
In the Phase 2/3 portion of Study 2, based on data accrued through 14 November 2020, approximately 
44 000 participants were randomised equally and were to receive 2 doses of COVID-19 mRNA 
Vaccine or placebo. The efficacy analyses included participants that received their second vaccination 
within 19 to 42 days after their first vaccination. The majority (93.1%) of vaccine recipients received 
the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Participants are planned to be followed for up to 
24 months after Dose 2, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID-19. In the clinical 
study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 14 days before and after 
administration of an influenza vaccine in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA 
Vaccine. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 60 days 
before or after receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins within through conclusion of the 
study in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine. 
The population for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included 36 621 participants 12 years 
of age and older (18 242 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 18 379 in the placebo group) 
who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 through 7 days after the second dose. 
In addition, 134 participants were between the ages of 16 to 17 years of age (66 in the COVID-19 
mRNA Vaccine group and 68 in the placebo group) and 1 616 participants 75 years of age and older 
(804 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 812 in the placebo group). 
At the time of the primary efficacy analysis, participants had been followed for symptomatic 
COVID-19 for in total 2 214 person-years for the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and in total 
2 222 person-years in the placebo group.  
There were no meaningful clinical differences in overall vaccine efficacy in participants who were at 
risk of severe COVID-19 including those with 1 or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe 
COVID-19 (e.g. asthma, body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes 
mellitus, hypertension). 
The vaccine efficacy information is presented in Table 2.

Efficacy of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing first COVID-19 occurrence from 7 days after 
Dose 2 compared to placebo was 94.6% (95% confidence interval of 89.6% to 97.6%) in participants 
16 years of age and older with or without evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2.  
Additionally, subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint showed similar efficacy point 
estimates across genders, ethnic groups, and participants with medical comorbidities associated with 
high risk of severe COVID-19.  
Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additional confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued during 
blinded placebo-controlled follow-up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy 
population.  
The updated vaccine efficacy information is presented in Table 3.

In the updated efficacy analysis, efficacy of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing first COVID-19 
occurrence from 7 days after Dose 2 compared to placebo was 91.1% (95% CI of 88.8% to 93.0%) 
during the period when Wuhan/Wild type and Alpha variants were the predominant circulating strains 
in participants in the evaluable efficacy population with or without evidence of prior infection with 
SARS-CoV-2.  
Additionally, the updated efficacy analyses by subgroup showed similar efficacy point estimates 
across sexes, ethnic groups, geography and participants with medical comorbidities and obesity 
associated with high risk of severe COVID-19.  
Efficacy against severe COVID-19 
Updated efficacy analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints supported benefit of the COVID-19 mRNA 
Vaccine in preventing severe COVID‑19. 
As of 13 March 2021, vaccine efficacy against severe COVID-19 is presented only for participants 
with or without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 4) as the COVID-19 case counts in participants 
without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection were the same as those in participants with or without prior 
SARS-CoV-2 infection in both the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and placebo groups.

Efficacy and immunogenicity in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age – after 2 doses 
In an initial analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (representing a median follow-up 
duration of > 2 months after Dose 2) without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 
1 005 participants who received the vaccine and 16 cases out of 978 who received placebo. The point 
estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 75.3, 100.0). In participants with or without 
evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 18 cases in 
1 110 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% 
(95% confidence interval 78.1, 100.0).  
Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additional confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued during 
blinded placebo-controlled follow-up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy 
population.  
In the updated efficacy analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age without evidence of 
prior infection, there were no cases in 1 057 participants who received the vaccine and 28 cases out of 
1 030 who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 86.8, 
100.0) during the period when Alpha variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants 
with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 
30 cases  in 1 109 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy 
is 100% (95% confidence interval 87.5, 100.0). 
In Study 2, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising titres 1 month after Dose 2 was conducted in a 
randomly selected subset of participants who had no serological or virological evidence of past 
SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, comparing the response in adolescents 12 to 
15 years of age (n = 190) to participants 16 to 25 years of age (n = 170).  
The ratio of the geometric mean titres (GMT) in the 12 to 15 years of age group to the 16 to 25 years 
of age group was 1.76, with a 2-sided 95% CI of 1.47 to 2.10. Therefore, the 1.5-fold noninferiority 
criterion was met as the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio [GMR] was 
> 0.67. 
Immunogenicity in participants 18 years of age and older – after booster dose 
Effectiveness of a booster dose of Comirnaty was based on an assessment of 50% neutralizing 
antibody titres (NT50) against SARS-CoV-2 (USA_WA1/2020) in Study 2. In this study, the booster 
dose was administered 5 to 8 months (median 7 months) after the second dose. In Study 2, analyses of 
NT50 1 month after the booster dose compared to 1 month after the primary series in individuals 18 
through 55 years of age who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection 
up to 1 month after the booster vaccination demonstrated noninferiority for both geometric mean ratio 
(GMR) and difference in seroresponse rates. Seroresponse for a participant was defined as achieving a 
≥ 4-fold rise in NT50 from baseline (before primary series). These analyses are summarized in 
Table 5.

Relative vaccine efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older – after booster dose 
An interim efficacy analysis of Study 4, a placebo-controlled booster study performed in 
approximately 10 000 participants 16 years of age and older who were recruited from Study 2, 
evaluated confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued from at least 7 days after booster vaccination up to a 
13 
 
  
 
data cut-off date of 5 October 2021, which represents a median of 2.5 months post-booster follow-up. 
The booster dose was administered 5 to 13 months (median 11 months) after the second dose. Vaccine 
efficacy of the Comirnaty booster dose after the primary series relative to the placebo booster group 
who only received the primary series dose was assessed.  
The relative vaccine efficacy information for participants 16 years of age and older without prior 
evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is presented in Table 6. Relative vaccine efficacy in participants 
with or without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was 94.6% (95% confidence interval of 
88.5% to 97.9%), similar to that seen in those participants without evidence of prior infection. Primary 
COVID-19 cases observed from 7 days after booster vaccination were 7 primary cases in the 
Comirnaty group, and 124 primary cases in the placebo group.

Immunogenicity of a booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 
vaccine 
Effectiveness of a Comirnaty booster dose (30 mcg) in individuals who completed primary 
vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose) is inferred from 
immunogenicity data from an independent National Institutes of Health (NIH) study phase 1/2 
open-label clinical trial (NCT04889209) conducted in the United States. In this study, adults (range 19 
to 80 years of age) who had completed primary vaccination with Moderna 100 mcg 2-dose series 
(N = 51, mean age 54±17), Janssen single dose (N = 53, mean age 48±14), or Comirnaty 30 mcg 
2-dose series (N = 50, mean age 50±18) at least 12 weeks prior to enrolment and who reported no 
history of SARS-CoV-2 infection received a booster dose of Comirnaty (30 mcg). The boost with 
Comirnaty induced a 36, 12, and 20 GMR-fold rise in neutralising titres following the Janssen, 
Moderna, and Comirnaty primary doses, respectively. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Heterologous boosting with Comirnaty was also evaluated in the CoV-BOOST study 
(EudraCT 2021-002175-19), a multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 2 trial of third dose booster 
vaccination against COVID-19, in which 107 adult participants (median age 71 years of age, 
interquartile range 54 to 77 years of age) were randomised at least 70 days post 2 doses of 
AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine. After the AstraZeneca COVID‑19 Vaccine primary series, 
pseudovirus (wild-type), neutralising antibody NT50 GMR-fold change increased 21.6-fold with 
heterologous Comirnaty booster (n = 95).  
Immunogenicity in participants > 55 years of age – after a booster dose (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 
(30 mcg) 
In an interim analysis of a subset from Study 4 (Substudy E), 305 participants > 55 years of age who 
had completed a series of 3 doses of Comirnaty received Comirnaty (30 mcg) as a booster dose (fourth 
dose) 5 to 12 months after receiving Dose 3. For the immunogenicity subset data see Table 7.  
Immunogenicity in participants 18 to ≤ 55 years of age – after a booster dose (fourth dose) of 
Comirnaty (30 mcg)  
In Substudy D [a subset from Study 2 (Phase 3) and Study 4 (Phase 3)], 325 participants 18 to 
≤ 55 years of age who had completed 3 doses of Comirnaty received Comirnaty (30 mcg) as a booster 
dose (fourth dose) 90 to 180 days after receiving Dose 3. For the immunogenicity subset data see

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Not applicable. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose 
toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity. 
General toxicity 
Rats intramuscularly administered Comirnaty (receiving 3 full human doses once weekly, generating 
relatively higher levels in rats due to body weight differences) demonstrated some injection site 
oedema and erythema and increases in white blood cells (including basophils and eosinophils) 
consistent with an inflammatory response as well as vacuolation of portal hepatocytes without 
evidence of liver injury. All effects were reversible. 
Genotoxicity/Carcinogenicity 
Neither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies were performed. The components of the vaccine (lipids 
and mRNA) are not expected to have genotoxic potential.  
Reproductive toxicity 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity were investigated in rats in a combined fertility and 
developmental toxicity study where female rats were intramuscularly administered Comirnaty prior to 
mating and during gestation (receiving 4 full human doses that generate relatively higher levels in rat 
due to body weight differences, spanning between pre-mating day 21 and gestational day 20). 
SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody responses were present in maternal animals from prior to mating 
to the end of the study on postnatal day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no 
vaccine-related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo-foetal or offspring development. No 
Comirnaty data are available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk.

General recommendations 
Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis 
Events of anaphylaxis have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should 
always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the 
vaccine.  
Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. No further dose of 
the vaccine should be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis after a prior dose of 
Comirnaty. 
Myocarditis and pericarditis 
There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Comirnaty. These 
conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 
14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger 
males (see section 4.8). Available data indicate that most cases recover. Some cases required intensive 
care support and fatal cases have been observed. 
Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. 
Vaccinees (including parents or caregivers) should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention 
if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest 
pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination. 
Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this 
condition. 
Anxiety-related reactions 
Anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress‐related 
reactions (e.g. dizziness, palpitations, increases in heart rate, alterations in blood pressure, 
paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia and sweating) may occur in association with the vaccination process itself. 
Stress-related reactions are temporary and resolve on their own. Individuals should be advised to bring 
symptoms to the attention of the vaccination provider for evaluation. It is important that precautions 
are in place to avoid injury from fainting. 
Concurrent illness 
Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute 
infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination. 
Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders 
As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals 
receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as 
haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in 
these individuals. 
Immunocompromised individuals 
The efficacy and safety of the vaccine has not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, 
including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of Comirnaty may be lower in 
immunocompromised individuals. 
Duration of protection 
The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by 
ongoing clinical trials. 
Limitations of vaccine effectiveness 
As with any vaccine, vaccination with Comirnaty may not protect all vaccine recipients. Individuals 
may not be fully protected until 7 days after their vaccination.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
Concomitant administration of Comirnaty with other vaccines has not been studied. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
A large amount of observational data from pregnant women vaccinated with Comirnaty during the 
second and third trimester have not shown an increase in adverse pregnancy outcomes. While data on 
pregnancy outcomes following vaccination during the first trimester are presently limited, no 
increased risk for miscarriage has been seen. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful 
effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition or post-natal development 
(see section 5.3). Comirnaty can be used during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
No effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of 
breast-feeding woman to Comirnaty is negligible. Observational data from women who were 
breast-feeding after vaccination have not shown a risk for adverse effects in breastfed 
newborns/infants. Comirnaty can be used during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Comirnaty has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of 
the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile 
Participants 16 years of age and older – after 2 doses 
In Study 2, a total of 22 026 participants 16 years of age or older received at least 1 dose of Comirnaty 
and a total of 22 021 participants 16 years of age or older received placebo (including 138 and 
145 adolescents 16 and 17 years of age in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively). A total of 
20 519 participants 16 years of age or older received 2 doses of Comirnaty.  
At the time of the analysis of Study 2 with a data cut-off of 13 March 2021 for the placebo-controlled 
blinded follow-up period up to the participants’ unblinding dates, a total of 25 651 (58.2%) 
participants (13 031 Comirnaty and 12 620 placebo) 16 years of age and older were followed up for 
≥ 4 months after the second dose. This included a total of 15 111 (7 704 Comirnaty and 7 407 placebo) 
participants 16 to 55 years of age and a total of 10 540 (5 327 Comirnaty and 5 213 placebo) 
participants 56 years of age and older. 
The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 16 years of age and older that received 2 doses 
were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 50%), myalgia (> 40%), chills 
(> 30%), arthralgia (> 20%), pyrexia and injection site swelling (> 10%) and were usually mild or 
moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of 
reactogenicity events was associated with greater age. 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The safety profile in 545 participants 16 years of age and older receiving Comirnaty, that were 
seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, was similar to that seen in the general population. 
Adolescents 12 to 15 years of age – after 2 doses 
In an analysis of long-term safety follow-up in Study 2, 2 260 adolescents (1 131 Comirnaty and 
1 129 placebo) were 12 to 15 years of age. Of these, 1 559 adolescents (786 Comirnaty and 
773 placebo) have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. 
The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age was similar to that seen in 
participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in adolescents 12 to 
15 years of age that received 2 doses were injection site pain (> 90%), fatigue and headache (> 70%), 
myalgia and chills (> 40%), arthralgia and pyrexia (> 20%). 
Participants 12 years of age and older – after booster dose 
A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 306 adults 18 to 55 years of age who completed the 
original Comirnaty 2-dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 6 months 
(range of 4.8 to 8.0 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, 
had a median follow-up time of 8.3 months (range 1.1 to 8.5 months) and 301 participants had been 
followed for ≥ 6 months after the booster dose to the cut-off date (22 November 2021). 
The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after 2 doses. The most frequent 
adverse reactions in participants 18 to 55 years of age were injection site pain (> 80%), 
fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 40%), myalgia (> 30%), chills and arthralgia (> 20%).  
In Study 4, a placebo-controlled booster study, participants 16 years of age and older recruited from 
Study 2 received a booster dose of Comirnaty (5 081 participants), or placebo (5 044 participants) at 
least 6 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, 
had a median follow-up time of 2.8 months (range 0.3 to 7.5 months) after the booster dose in the 
blinded placebo-controlled follow-up period to the cut-off date (8 February 2022). Of these, 
1 281 participants (895 Comirnaty and 386 placebo) have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the 
booster dose of Comirnaty. No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified. 
A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 825 adolescents 12 to 15 years of age who completed 
the original Comirnaty 2-dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 
11.2 months (range of 6.3 to 20.1 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a 
booster dose, had a median follow-up time of 9.5 months (range 1.5 to 10.7 months) based on data up 
to the cut-off date (3 November 2022). No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified. 
Participants 12 years of age and older – after subsequent booster doses 
The safety of a booster dose of Comirnaty in participants 12 years of age and older is inferred from 
safety data from studies of a booster dose of Comirnaty in participants 18 years of age and older. 
A subset of 325 adults 18 to ≤ 55 years of age who had completed 3 doses of Comirnaty, received a 
booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 90 to 180 days after receiving Dose 3. Participants who received a 
booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty had a median follow-up time of 1.4 months up to a data cut-off 
date of 11 March 2022. The most frequent adverse reactions in these participants were injection site 
pain (> 70%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 40%), myalgia and chills (> 20%), and arthralgia (> 10%).  
In a subset from Study 4 (Phase 3), 305 adults > 55 years of age who had completed 3 doses of 
Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 5 to 12 months after receiving Dose 3. 
Participants who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty had a median follow-up time of at least 
1.7 months up to a data cut-off date of 16 May 2022. The overall safety profile for the Comirnaty 
booster (fourth dose) was similar to that seen after the Comirnaty booster (third dose). The most 
frequent adverse reactions in participants > 55 years of age were injection site pain (> 60%), 
fatigue (> 40%), headache (> 20%), myalgia and chills (> 10%).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Myocarditis and pericarditis 
The increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty is highest in younger males (see 
section 4.4). 
Two large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have estimated the excess risk in younger 
males following the second dose of Comirnaty. One study showed that in a period of 7 days after the 
second dose there were about 0.265 (95% CI 0.255 - 0.275) extra cases of myocarditis in 12-29 year 
old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. In another study, in a period of 28 days after the 
second dose there were 0.56 (95% CI 0.37 - 0.74) extra cases of myocarditis in 16-24 year old males 
per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. 
Limited data indicate that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty in 
children aged 5 to 11 years seems lower than in ages 12 to 17 years. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V and include batch/Lot number if available. 
4.9  Overdose 
Overdose data is available from 52 study participants included in the clinical trial that due to an error 
in dilution received 58 micrograms of Comirnaty. The vaccine recipients did not report an increase in 
reactogenicity or adverse reactions.  
In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is 
recommended.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BN01 
Mechanism of action 
The nucleoside-modified messenger RNA in Comirnaty is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which 
enable delivery of the non-replicating RNA into host cells to direct transient expression of the 
SARS-CoV-2 S antigen. The mRNA codes for membrane-anchored, full-length S with two point 
mutations within the central helix. Mutation of these two amino acids to proline locks S in an 
antigenically preferred prefusion conformation. The vaccine elicits both neutralizing antibody and 
cellular immune responses to the spike (S) antigen, which may contribute to protection against 
COVID-19. 
Efficacy 
Study 2 is a multicentre, multinational, Phase 1/2/3 randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind 
dose-finding, vaccine candidate selection and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. 
Randomisation was stratified by age: 12 to 15 years of age, 16 to 55 years of age, or 56 years of age 
and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the ≥ 56-year stratum. The study excluded 
participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological 
diagnosis of COVID-19. Participants with pre-existing stable disease, defined as disease not requiring 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before 
enrolment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV).  
Efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older – after 2 doses 
In the Phase 2/3 portion of Study 2, based on data accrued through 14 November 2020, approximately 
44 000 participants were randomised equally and were to receive 2 doses of COVID-19 mRNA 
Vaccine or placebo. The efficacy analyses included participants that received their second vaccination 
within 19 to 42 days after their first vaccination. The majority (93.1%) of vaccine recipients received 
the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Participants are planned to be followed for up to 
24 months after Dose 2, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID-19. In the clinical 
study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 14 days before and after 
administration of an influenza vaccine in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA 
Vaccine. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 60 days 
before or after receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins within through conclusion of the 
study in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine. 
The population for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included 36 621 participants 12 years 
of age and older (18 242 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 18 379 in the placebo group) 
who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 through 7 days after the second dose. 
In addition, 134 participants were between the ages of 16 to 17 years of age (66 in the COVID-19 
mRNA Vaccine group and 68 in the placebo group) and 1 616 participants 75 years of age and older 
(804 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 812 in the placebo group). 
At the time of the primary efficacy analysis, participants had been followed for symptomatic 
COVID-19 for in total 2 214 person-years for the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and in total 
2 222 person-years in the placebo group.  
There were no meaningful clinical differences in overall vaccine efficacy in participants who were at 
risk of severe COVID-19 including those with 1 or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe 
COVID-19 (e.g. asthma, body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes 
mellitus, hypertension).

Efficacy against severe COVID-19  
Updated efficacy analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints supported benefit of the COVID-19 mRNA 
Vaccine in preventing severe COVID‑19. 
As of 13 March 2021, vaccine efficacy against severe COVID-19 is presented only for participants 
with or without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 4) as the COVID-19 case counts in participants 
without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection were the same as those in participants with or without prior 
SARS-CoV-2 infection in both the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and placebo groups.

Efficacy and immunogenicity in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age – after 2 doses  
 In an initial analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (representing a median follow-up 
duration of > 2 months after Dose 2) without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 
1 005 participants who received the vaccine and 16 cases out of 978 who received placebo. The point 
estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 75.3, 100.0). In participants with or without 
evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 18 cases in 
1 110 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% 
(95% confidence interval 78.1, 100.0).  
Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additional confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued during 
blinded placebo-controlled follow-up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy 
population.  
In the updated efficacy analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age without evidence of 
prior infection, there were no cases in 1 057 participants who received the vaccine and 28 cases out of 
1 030 who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 86.8, 
100.0) during the period when Alpha variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants 
with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 
30 cases  in 1 109 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy 
is 100% (95% confidence interval 87.5, 100.0). 
In Study 2, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising titres 1 month after Dose 2 was conducted in a 
randomly selected subset of participants who had no serological or virological evidence of past 
SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, comparing the response in adolescents 12 to 
15 years of age (n = 190) to participants 16 to 25 years of age (n = 170).  
The ratio of the geometric mean titres (GMT) in the 12 to 15 years of age group to the 16 to 25 years 
of age group was 1.76, with a 2-sided 95% CI of 1.47 to 2.10. Therefore, the 1.5-fold noninferiority 
criterion was met as the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio [GMR] was 
> 0.67. 
Immunogenicity in participants 18 years of age and older – after booster dose 
Effectiveness of a booster dose of Comirnaty was based on an assessment of 50% neutralizing 
antibody titres (NT50) against SARS-CoV-2 (USA_WA1/2020) in Study 2. In this study, the booster 
dose was administered 5 to 8 months (median 7 months) after the second dose. In Study 2, analyses of 
NT50 1 month after the booster dose compared to 1 month after the primary series in individuals 18 
through 55 years of age who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection 
up to 1 month after the booster vaccination demonstrated noninferiority for both geometric mean ratio 
(GMR) and difference in seroresponse rates. Seroresponse for a participant was defined as achieving a 
≥ 4-fold rise in NT50 from baseline (before primary series). These analyses are summarized in 
Table 5.

Relative vaccine efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older – after booster dose 
An interim efficacy analysis of Study 4, a placebo-controlled booster study performed in 
approximately 10 000 participants 16 years of age and older who were recruited from Study 2, 
evaluated confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued from at least 7 days after booster vaccination up to a 
data cut-off date of 5 October 2021, which represents a median of 2.5 months post-booster follow-up. 
The booster dose was administered 5 to 13 months (median 11 months) after the second dose. Vaccine 
efficacy of the Comirnaty booster dose after the primary series relative to the placebo booster group 
who only received the primary series dose was assessed.  
32 
 
  
 
 
The relative vaccine efficacy information for participants 16 years of age and older without prior 
evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is presented in Table 6. Relative vaccine efficacy in participants 
with or without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was 94.6% (95% confidence interval of 
88.5% to 97.9%), similar to that seen in those participants without evidence of prior infection. Primary 
COVID-19 cases observed from 7 days after booster vaccination were 7 primary cases in the 
Comirnaty group, and 124 primary cases in the placebo group.

Immunogenicity of a booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 
vaccine 
Effectiveness of a Comirnaty booster dose (30 mcg) in individuals who completed primary 
vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose) is inferred from 
immunogenicity data from an independent National Institutes of Health (NIH) study phase 1/2 
open-label clinical trial (NCT04889209) conducted in the United States. In this study, adults (range 19 
to 80 years of age) who had completed primary vaccination with Moderna 100 mcg 2-dose series 
(N = 51, mean age 54±17), Janssen single dose (N = 53, mean age 48±14), or Comirnaty 30 mcg 
2-dose series (N = 50, mean age 50±18) at least 12 weeks prior to enrolment and who reported no 
history of SARS-CoV-2 infection received a booster dose of Comirnaty (30 mcg). The boost with 
Comirnaty induced a 36, 12, and 20 GMR-fold rise in neutralising titres following the Janssen, 
Moderna, and Comirnaty primary doses, respectively. 
Heterologous boosting with Comirnaty was also evaluated in the CoV-BOOST study 
(EudraCT 2021-002175-19), a multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 2 trial of third dose booster 
vaccination against COVID-19, in which 107 adult participants (median age 71 years of age, 
interquartile range 54 to 77 years of age) were randomised at least 70 days post 2 doses of 
AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine. After the AstraZeneca COVID‑19 Vaccine primary series,

pseudovirus (wild-type), neutralising antibody NT50 GMR-fold change increased 21.6-fold with 
heterologous Comirnaty booster (n = 95).  
Immunogenicity in participants > 55 years of age – after a booster dose (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 
(30 mcg) 
In an interim analysis of a subset from Study 4 (Substudy E), 305 participants > 55 years of age who 
had completed a series of 3 doses of Comirnaty received Comirnaty (30 mcg) as a booster dose (fourth 
dose) 5 to 12 months after receiving Dose 3. For the Immunogenicity subset data see Table 7.

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Comirnaty in the paediatric population in prevention of COVID-19 (see section 4.2 for information on 
paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Not applicable. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose 
toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity. 
General toxicity 
Rats intramuscularly administered Comirnaty (receiving 3 full human doses once weekly, generating 
relatively higher levels in rats due to body weight differences) demonstrated some injection site 
oedema and erythema and increases in white blood cells (including basophils and eosinophils) 
consistent with an inflammatory response as well as vacuolation of portal hepatocytes without 
evidence of liver injury. All effects were reversible. 
Genotoxicity/Carcinogenicity 
Neither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies were performed. The components of the vaccine (lipids 
and mRNA) are not expected to have genotoxic potential.  
Reproductive toxicity 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity were investigated in rats in a combined fertility and 
developmental toxicity study where female rats were intramuscularly administered Comirnaty prior to 
mating and during gestation (receiving 4 full human doses that generate relatively higher levels in rat 
due to body weight differences, spanning between pre-mating day 21 and gestational day 20). 
SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody responses were present in maternal animals from prior to mating 
to the end of the study on postnatal day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no 
vaccine-related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo-foetal or offspring development. No 
Comirnaty data are available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk.

in vitro transcription from the corresponding DNA templates, encoding the viral spike (S) protein of 
SARS-CoV-2. 
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Concentrate for dispersion for injection (sterile concentrate). 
The vaccine is a white to off-white frozen dispersion (pH: 6.9 - 7.9). 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Comirnaty 10 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is indicated for active 
immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, in children aged 5 to 11 years.  
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) 
Comirnaty 10 micrograms/dose is administered intramuscularly after dilution as a single dose of 
0.2 mL for children 5 to 11 years of age regardless of prior COVID-19 vaccination status (see sections 
4.4 and 5.1). 
For individuals who have previously been vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty should be 
administered at least 3 months after the most recent dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.  
Severely immunocompromised aged 5 years and older 
Additional doses may be administered to individuals who are severely immunocompromised in 
accordance with national recommendations (see section 4.4). 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Comirnaty 10 micrograms/dose should be used only for children 5 to 11 years of age. 
Paediatric population 
There are paediatric formulations available for infants and children aged 6 months to 4 years. For 
details, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for other formulations. 
The safety and efficacy of the vaccine in infants aged less than 6 months have not yet been 
established.  
Method of administration 
Comirnaty 10 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection should be administered 
intramuscularly after dilution (see section 6.6).  
After dilution, vials of Comirnaty contain 10 doses of 0.2 mL of vaccine. In order to extract 10 doses 
from a single vial, low dead-volume syringes and/or needles should be used. The low dead-volume 
syringe and needle combination should have a dead volume of no more than 35 microlitres. If standard 
syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract 10 doses from a single 
vial. Irrespective of the type of syringe and needle: 
• 
• 
Each dose must contain 0.2 mL of vaccine. 
If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.2 mL, discard the 
vial and any excess volume.  
Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials. 
• 
The preferred site is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. 
Do not inject the vaccine intravascularly, subcutaneously or intradermally.  
The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products. 
For precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4. 
For instructions regarding thawing, handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability  
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
General recommendations 
Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis 
Events of anaphylaxis have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should 
always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the 
vaccine.  
Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. No further dose of 
the vaccine should be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis after a prior dose of 
Comirnaty. 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Myocarditis and pericarditis 
There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Comirnaty. These 
conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 
14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger 
males (see section 4.8). Available data indicate that most cases recover. Some cases required intensive 
care support and fatal cases have been observed. 
Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. 
Vaccinees (including parents or caregivers) should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention 
if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest 
pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination. 
Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this 
condition. 
Anxiety-related reactions 
Anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress‐related 
reactions (e.g. dizziness, palpitations, increases in heart rate, alterations in blood pressure, 
paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia and sweating) may occur in association with the vaccination process itself. 
Stress-related reactions are temporary and resolve on their own. Individuals should be advised to bring 
symptoms to the attention of the vaccination provider for evaluation. It is important that precautions 
are in place to avoid injury from fainting. 
Concurrent illness 
Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute 
infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination. 
Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders 
As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals 
receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as 
haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in 
these individuals. 
Immunocompromised individuals 
The efficacy and safety of the vaccine has not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, 
including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of Comirnaty may be lower in 
immunocompromised individuals. 
Duration of protection 
The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by 
ongoing clinical trials. 
Limitations of vaccine effectiveness 
As with any vaccine, vaccination with Comirnaty may not protect all vaccine recipients. Individuals 
may not be fully protected until 7 days after their vaccination. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
Concomitant administration of Comirnaty with other vaccines has not been studied.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
A large amount of observational data from pregnant women vaccinated with Comirnaty during the 
second and third trimester have not shown an increase in adverse pregnancy outcomes. While data on 
pregnancy outcomes following vaccination during the first trimester are presently limited, no 
increased risk for miscarriage has been seen. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful 
effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition or post-natal development 
(see section 5.3). Comirnaty can be used during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
No effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of 
breast-feeding woman to Comirnaty is negligible. Observational data from women who were 
breast-feeding after vaccination have not shown a risk for adverse effects in breastfed 
newborns/infants. Comirnaty can be used during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Comirnaty has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of 
the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile 
Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – after 2 doses 
In Study 3, a total of 3 109 children 5 to 11 years of age received at least 1 dose of Comirnaty 10 mcg 
and a total of 1 538 children 5 to 11 years of age received placebo. At the time of the analysis of 
Study 3 Phase 2/3 with data up to the cut-off date of 20 May 2022, 2 206 (1 481 Comirnaty 10 mcg 
and 725 placebo) children have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the second dose in the 
placebo-controlled blinded follow-up period. The safety evaluation in Study 3 is ongoing. 
The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in participants 5 to 11 years of age was similar to that seen in 
participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in children 5 to 11 years of 
age that received 2 doses were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 50%), headache (> 30%), 
injection site redness and swelling (≥ 20%), myalgia, chills, and diarrhoea (> 10%). 
Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – after booster dose  
In a subset from Study 3, a total of 401 children 5 to 11 years of age received a booster dose of 
Comirnaty 10 mcg at least 5 months (range of 5 to 9 months) after completing the primary series. The 
analysis of the Study 3 Phase 2/3 subset is based on data up to the cut-off date of 22 March 2022 
(median follow-up time of 1.3 months). 
The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after the primary course. The 
most frequent adverse reactions in children 5 to 11 years of age were injection site pain (> 70%), 
fatigue (> 40%), headache (> 30%), myalgia, chills, injection site redness and swelling (> 10%).

Adolescents 12 to 15 years of age – after 2 doses 
In an analysis of long-term safety follow-up in Study 2, 2 260 adolescents (1 131 Comirnaty and 
1 129 placebo) were 12 to 15 years of age. Of these, 1 559 adolescents (786 Comirnaty and 
773 placebo) have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the second dose. 
The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age was similar to that seen in 
participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in adolescents 12 to 
15 years of age that received 2 doses were injection site pain (> 90%), fatigue and headache (> 70%), 
myalgia and chills (> 40%), arthralgia and pyrexia (> 20%). 
Participants 16 years of age and older – after 2 doses 
In Study 2, a total of 22 026 participants 16 years of age or older received at least 1 dose of Comirnaty 
30 mcg and a total of 22 021 participants 16 years of age or older received placebo (including 138 and 
145 adolescents 16 and 17 years of age in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively). A total of 
20 519 participants 16 years of age or older received 2 doses of Comirnaty.  
At the time of the analysis of Study 2 with a data cut-off of 13 March 2021 for the placebo-controlled 
blinded follow-up period up to the participants’ unblinding dates, a total of 25 651 (58.2%) 
participants (13 031 Comirnaty and 12 620 placebo) 16 years of age and older were followed up for 
≥ 4 months after the second dose. This included a total of 15 111 (7 704 Comirnaty and 7 407 placebo) 
participants 16 to 55 years of age and a total of 10 540 (5 327 Comirnaty and 5 213 placebo) 
participants 56 years of age and older. 
The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 16 years of age and older that received 2 doses 
were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 50%), myalgia (> 40%), chills 
(> 30%), arthralgia (> 20%), pyrexia and injection site swelling (> 10%) and were usually mild or 
moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of 
reactogenicity events was associated with greater age. 
The safety profile in 545 participants 16 years of age and older receiving Comirnaty, that were 
seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, was similar to that seen in the general population. 
Participants 12 years of age and older – after booster dose 
A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 306 adults 18 to 55 years of age who completed the 
original Comirnaty 2-dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 6 months 
(range of 4.8 to 8.0 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, 
had a median follow-up time of 8.3 months (range 1.1 to 8.5 months) and 301 participants had been 
followed for ≥ 6 months after the booster dose to the cut-off date (22 November 2021). 
The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after 2 doses. The most frequent 
adverse reactions in participants 18 to 55 years of age were injection site pain (> 80%), 
fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 40%), myalgia (> 30%), chills and arthralgia (> 20%).  
In Study 4, a placebo-controlled booster study, participants 16 years of age and older recruited from 
Study 2 received a booster dose of Comirnaty (5 081 participants), or placebo (5 044 participants) at 
least 6 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, 
had a median follow-up time of 2.8 months (range 0.3 to 7.5 months) after the booster dose in the 
blinded placebo-controlled follow-up period to the cut-off date (8 February 2022). Of these, 
1 281 participants (895 Comirnaty and 386 placebo) have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the 
booster dose of Comirnaty. No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified. 
A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 825 adolescents 12 to 15 years of age who completed 
the original Comirnaty 2-dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 
11.2 months (range of 6.3 to 20.1 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a 
booster dose, had a median follow-up time of 9.5 months (range 1.5 to 10.7 months) based on data up 
to the cut-off date (3 November 2022). No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Myocarditis and pericarditis 
The increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty is highest in younger males (see 
section 4.4). 
Two large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have estimated the excess risk in younger 
males following the second dose of Comirnaty. One study showed that in a period of 7 days after the 
second dose there were about 0.265 (95% CI 0.255 – 0.275) extra cases of myocarditis in 12-29 year 
old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. In another study, in a period of 28 days after the 
second dose there were 0.56 (95% CI 0.37 – 0.74) extra cases of myocarditis in 16-24 year old males 
per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. 
Limited data indicate that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty in 
children aged 5 to 11 years seems lower than in ages 12 to 17 years. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V and include batch/Lot number if available. 
4.9  Overdose 
Overdose data is available from 52 study participants included in the clinical trial that due to an error 
in dilution received 58 micrograms of Comirnaty. The vaccine recipients did not report an increase in 
reactogenicity or adverse reactions.  
In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is 
recommended. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BN01 
Mechanism of action 
The nucleoside-modified messenger RNA in Comirnaty is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which 
enable delivery of the non-replicating RNA into host cells to direct transient expression of the 
SARS-CoV-2 S antigen. The mRNA codes for membrane-anchored, full-length S with two point 
mutations within the central helix. Mutation of these two amino acids to proline locks S in an 
antigenically preferred prefusion conformation. The vaccine elicits both neutralizing antibody and 
cellular immune responses to the spike (S) antigen, which may contribute to protection against 
COVID-19. 
Efficacy 
Study 2 is a multicentre, multinational, Phase 1/2/3 randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind 
dose-finding, vaccine candidate selection and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. 
Randomisation was stratified by age: 12 to 15 years of age, 16 to 55 years of age, or 56 years of age 
and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the ≥ 56-year stratum. The study excluded 
participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological 
diagnosis of COVID-19. Participants with pre-existing stable disease, defined as disease not requiring 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before 
enrolment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV).  
Efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older – after 2 doses 
In the Phase 2/3 portion of Study 2, based on data accrued through 14 November 2020, approximately 
44 000 participants were randomised equally and were to receive 2 doses of COVID-19 mRNA 
Vaccine or placebo. The efficacy analyses included participants that received their second vaccination 
within 19 to 42 days after their first vaccination. The majority (93.1%) of vaccine recipients received 
the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Participants are planned to be followed for up to 
24 months after Dose 2, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID-19. In the clinical 
study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 14 days before and after 
administration of an influenza vaccine in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA 
Vaccine. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 60 days 
before or after receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins within through conclusion of the 
study in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine. 
The population for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included 36 621 participants 12 years 
of age and older (18 242 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 18 379 in the placebo group) 
who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 through 7 days after the second dose. 
In addition, 134 participants were between the ages of 16 to 17 years of age (66 in the COVID-19 
mRNA Vaccine group and 68 in the placebo group) and 1 616 participants 75 years of age and older 
(804 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 812 in the placebo group). 
At the time of the primary efficacy analysis, participants had been followed for symptomatic 
COVID-19 for in total 2 214 person-years for the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and in total 
2 222 person-years in the placebo group.  
There were no meaningful clinical differences in overall vaccine efficacy in participants who were at 
risk of severe COVID-19 including those with 1 or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe 
COVID-19 (e.g. asthma, body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes 
mellitus, hypertension).

Dose 2 compared to placebo was 94.6% (95% confidence interval of 89.6% to 97.6%) in participants 
16 years of age and older with or without evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2.  
Additionally, subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint showed similar efficacy point 
estimates across genders, ethnic groups, and participants with medical comorbidities associated with 
high risk of severe COVID-19.  
Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additional confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued during 
blinded placebo-controlled follow-up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy 
population.

In the updated efficacy analysis, efficacy of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing first COVID-19 
occurrence from 7 days after Dose 2 compared to placebo was 91.1% (95% CI of 88.8% to 93.0%) 
during the period when Wuhan/Wild type and Alpha variants were the predominant circulating strains 
in participants in the evaluable efficacy population with or without evidence of prior infection with 
SARS-CoV-2.  
Additionally, the updated efficacy analyses by subgroup showed similar efficacy point estimates 
across sexes, ethnic groups, geography and participants with medical comorbidities and obesity

Efficacy against severe COVID-19  
Updated efficacy analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints supported benefit of the COVID-19 mRNA 
Vaccine in preventing severe COVID‑19. 
As of 13 March 2021, vaccine efficacy against severe COVID-19 is presented only for participants 
with or without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 4) as the COVID-19 case counts in participants 
without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection were the same as those in participants with or without prior 
SARS-CoV-2 infection in both the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and placebo groups.

Efficacy and immunogenicity in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age – after 2 doses 
In an initial analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (representing a median follow-up 
duration of > 2 months after Dose 2) without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 
1 005 participants who received the vaccine and 16 cases out of 978 who received placebo. The point 
estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 75.3, 100.0). In participants with or without 
evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 18 cases in 
1 110 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% 
(95% confidence interval 78.1, 100.0).  
Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additional confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued during 
blinded placebo-controlled follow-up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy 
population.  
In the updated efficacy analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age without evidence of 
prior infection, there were no cases in 1 057 participants who received the vaccine and 28 cases out of 
1 030 who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 86.8, 
100.0) during the period when Alpha variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants 
with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 
30 cases  in 1 109 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy 
is 100% (95% confidence interval 87.5, 100.0). 
In Study 2, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising titres 1 month after Dose 2 was conducted in a 
randomly selected subset of participants who had no serological or virological evidence of past 
SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, comparing the response in adolescents 12 to 
15 years of age (n = 190) to participants 16 to 25 years of age (n = 170).  
The ratio of the geometric mean titres (GMT) in the 12 to 15 years of age group to the 16 to 25 years 
of age group was 1.76, with a 2-sided 95% CI of 1.47 to 2.10. Therefore, the 1.5-fold noninferiority 
criterion was met as the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio [GMR] was 
> 0.67. 
Efficacy and immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – 
after 2 doses 
Study 3 is a Phase 1/2/3 study comprised of an open-label vaccine dose-finding portion (Phase 1) and 
a multicentre, multinational, randomised, saline placebo-controlled, observer-blind efficacy portion 
(Phase 2/3) that has enrolled participants 5 to 11 years of age. The majority (94.4%) of randomised 
vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. 
Initial descriptive vaccine efficacy results in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior

Note: Confirmed cases were determined by Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and at 
least 1 symptom consistent with COVID-19 (symptoms included: fever; new or increased cough; new or increased 
shortness of breath; chills; new or increased muscle pain; new loss of taste or smell; sore throat; diarrhoea; 
vomiting).  
*  Participants who had no evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection (i.e. N-binding antibody [serum] negative at 
Visit 1 and SARS-CoV-2 not detected by NAAT [nasal swab] at Visits 1 and 2), and had negative NAAT 
(nasal swab) at any unscheduled visit prior to 7 days after Dose 2 were included in the analysis.

b.  n1 = Number of participants meeting the endpoint definition. 
c.  Total surveillance time in 1 000 person-years for the given endpoint across all participants within each group

d.  n2 = Number of participants at risk for the endpoint. 
Pre-specified hypothesis-driven efficacy analysis was performed with additional confirmed 
COVID-19 cases accrued during blinded placebo-controlled follow-up, representing up to 6 months 
after Dose 2 in the efficacy population.  
In the efficacy analysis of Study 3 in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior infection, 
there were 10 cases in 2 703 participants who received the vaccine and 42 cases out of 1 348 who 
received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 88.2% (95% confidence interval 76.2, 94.7) during 
the period when Delta variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants with or without 
evidence of prior infection there were 12 cases in the 3 018 who received vaccine and 42 cases in 
1 511 participants who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 85.7% (95% confidence 
interval 72.4, 93.2). 
In Study 3, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralising titres (NT50) 1 month after Dose 2 in a 
randomly selected subset of participants demonstrated effectiveness by immunobridging of immune 
responses comparing children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) in the Phase 2/3 
part of Study 3 to participants 16 to 25 years of age in the Phase 2/3 part of Study 2 who had no 
serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, meeting 
the prespecified immunobridging criteria for both the geometric mean ratio (GMR) and the 
seroresponse difference with seroresponse defined as achieving at least 4-fold rise in SARS-CoV-2 
NT50 from baseline (before Dose 1).  
The GMR of the SARS-CoV-2 NT50 1 month after Dose 2 in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to 
less than 12 years of age) to that of young adults 16 to 25 years of age was 1.04 (2-sided 95% CI: 0.93, 
1.18). Among participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after 
Dose 2, 99.2% of children 5 to 11 years of age and 99.2% of participants 16 to 25 years of age had a 
seroresponse at 1 month after Dose 2. The difference in proportions of participants who had 
seroresponse between the 2 age groups (children – young adult) was 0.0% (2-sided 95% CI: -2.0%, 
2.2%). This information is presented in Table 6.

Immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – after booster 
dose  
A booster dose of Comirnaty was given to 401 randomly selected participants in Study 3. 
Effectiveness of a booster dose in ages 5 to 11 is inferred by immunogenicity. The immunogenicity of 
this was assessed through NT50 against the reference strain of SARS-CoV-2 (USA_WA1/2020). 
Analyses of NT50 1 month after the booster dose compared to before the booster dose demonstrated a 
substantial increase in GMTs in individuals 5 through 11 years of age who had no serological or 
virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after the dose 2 and the booster 
dose. This analysis is summarized in Table 7.

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Comirnaty in the paediatric population in prevention of COVID-19 (see section 4.2 for information on 
paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Not applicable. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose 
toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity. 
General toxicity 
Rats intramuscularly administered Comirnaty (receiving 3 full human doses once weekly, generating 
relatively higher levels in rats due to body weight differences) demonstrated some injection site 
oedema and erythema and increases in white blood cells (including basophils and eosinophils) 
53 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
consistent with an inflammatory response as well as vacuolation of portal hepatocytes without 
evidence of liver injury. All effects were reversible. 
Genotoxicity/Carcinogenicity 
Neither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies were performed. The components of the vaccine (lipids 
and mRNA) are not expected to have genotoxic potential.  
Reproductive toxicity 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity were investigated in rats in a combined fertility and 
developmental toxicity study where female rats were intramuscularly administered Comirnaty prior to 
mating and during gestation (receiving 4 full human doses that generate relatively higher levels in rat 
due to body weight differences, spanning between pre-mating day 21 and gestational day 20). 
SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody responses were present in maternal animals from prior to mating 
to the end of the study on postnatal day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no 
vaccine-related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo-foetal or offspring development. No 
Comirnaty data are available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Concentrate for dispersion for injection (sterile concentrate). 
The vaccine is a white to off-white frozen dispersion (pH: 6.9 - 7.9). 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Comirnaty 3 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is indicated for active 
immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, in infants and children aged 6 months to 
4 years.  
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Infants and children 6 months to 4 years of age without history of completion of a COVID-19 primary 
course or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection 
Comirnaty 3 micrograms/dose is administered intramuscularly after dilution as a primary course of 
3 doses (0.2 mL each). It is recommended to administer the second dose 3 weeks after the first dose 
followed by a third dose administered at least 8 weeks after the second dose (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
If a child turns 5 years old between their doses in the primary course, he/she should complete the 
primary course at the same 3 micrograms dose level. 
58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Infants and children 6 months to 4 years of age with history of completion of a COVID-19 primary 
course or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection 
Comirnaty 3 micrograms/dose is administered intramuscularly after dilution as a single dose of 0.2 mL 
for infants and children 6 months to 4 years of age. 
For individuals who have previously been vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty should be 
administered at least 3 months after the most recent dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.  
Severely immunocompromised aged 6 months to 4 years 
Additional doses may be administered to individuals who are severely immunocompromised in 
accordance with national recommendations (see section 4.4). 
Interchangeability  
The primary course may consist of either Comirnaty, Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5, or 
Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 (or a combination) but not exceeding the total number of doses required 
as primary course. The primary course should only be administered once.  
The interchangeability of Comirnaty with COVID-19 vaccines from other manufacturers has not been 
established.  
Paediatric population 
There are paediatric formulations available for children 5 to 11 years of age. For details, please refer to 
the Summary of Product Characteristics for other formulations. 
The safety and efficacy of the vaccine in infants aged less than 6 months have not yet been 
established.  
Method of administration 
Comirnaty 3 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection should be administered 
intramuscularly after dilution (see section 6.6).  
After dilution, vials of Comirnaty contain 10 doses of 0.2 mL of vaccine. In order to extract 10 doses 
from a single vial, low dead-volume syringes and/or needles should be used. The low dead-volume 
syringe and needle combination should have a dead volume of no more than 35 microlitres. If standard 
syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract 10 doses from a single 
vial. Irrespective of the type of syringe and needle: 
• 
• 
Each dose must contain 0.2 mL of vaccine. 
If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.2 mL, discard the 
vial and any excess volume.  
Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials. 
• 
In infants from 6 to less than 12 months of age, the recommended injection site is the anterolateral 
aspect of the thigh. In individuals 1 year of age and older, the recommended injection site is the 
anterolateral aspect of the thigh or the deltoid muscle. 
Do not inject the vaccine intravascularly, subcutaneously or intradermally.  
The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products. 
For precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4. 
For instructions regarding thawing, handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability  
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
General recommendations 
Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis 
Events of anaphylaxis have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should 
always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the 
vaccine.  
Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. No further dose of 
the vaccine should be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis after a prior dose of 
Comirnaty. 
Myocarditis and pericarditis 
There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Comirnaty. These 
conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 
14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger 
males (see section 4.8). Available data indicate that most cases recover. Some cases required intensive 
care support and fatal cases have been observed. 
Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. 
Vaccinees (including parents or caregivers) should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention 
if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest 
pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination. 
Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this 
condition. 
Anxiety-related reactions 
Anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress‐related 
reactions (e.g. dizziness, palpitations, increases in heart rate, alterations in blood pressure, 
paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia and sweating) may occur in association with the vaccination process itself. 
Stress-related reactions are temporary and resolve on their own. Individuals should be advised to bring 
symptoms to the attention of the vaccination provider for evaluation. It is important that precautions 
are in place to avoid injury from fainting. 
Concurrent illness 
Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute 
infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination. 
Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders 
As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals 
receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as 
haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in 
these individuals. 
Immunocompromised individuals 
The efficacy and safety of the vaccine has not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, 
including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of Comirnaty may be lower in 
immunocompromised individuals.

Duration of protection 
The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by 
ongoing clinical trials. 
Limitations of vaccine effectiveness 
As with any vaccine, vaccination with Comirnaty may not protect all vaccine recipients. Individuals 
may not be fully protected until 7 days after their vaccination. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
Concomitant administration of Comirnaty with other vaccines has not been studied. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Comirnaty 3 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is not intended for individuals 
older than 5 years of age.  
For details for use in individuals older than 5 years of age, please refer to the Summary of Product 
Characteristics for those formulations. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Comirnaty has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive, cycle, and use machines. However, 
some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive, cycle, or 
use machines.

Summary of safety profile 
Infants 6 to 23 months of age – after 3 doses 
In an analysis of Study 3 (Phase 2/3), 1 776 infants (1 178 Comirnaty 3 mcg and 598 placebo) were 
6 to 23 months of age. Based on data in the blinded placebo-controlled follow-up period up to the 
cut-off date of 29 April 2022, 570 infants 6 to 23 months of age who received a 3-dose primary course 
(386 Comirnaty 3 mcg and 184 placebo) have been followed for a median of 1.3 months after the third 
dose. 
The most frequent adverse reactions in infants 6 to 23 months of age that received any primary course 
dose included irritability (> 60%), drowsiness (> 40%), decreased appetite (> 30%), tenderness at the 
injection site (> 20%), injection site redness and fever (> 10%). 
Children 2 to 4 years of age – after 3 doses 
In an analysis of Study 3 (Phase 2/3), 2 750 children (1 835 Comirnaty 3 mcg and 915 placebo) were 
2 to 4 years of age. Based on data in the blinded placebo-controlled follow-up period up to the cut-off 
date of 29 April 2022, 886 children 2 to 4 years of age who received a 3-dose primary course 
(606 Comirnaty 3 mcg and 280 placebo) have been followed a median of 1.4 months after the third 
dose. 
The most frequent adverse reactions in children 2 to 4 years of age that received any primary course 
dose included pain at injection site and fatigue (> 40%), injection site redness and fever (> 10%). 
Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – after 2 doses 
In Study 3, a total of 3 109 children 5 to 11 years of age received at least 1 dose of Comirnaty 10 mcg 
and a total of 1 538 children 5 to 11 years of age received placebo. At the time of the analysis of 
Study 3 Phase 2/3 with data up to the cut-off date of 20 May 2022, 2 206 (1 481 Comirnaty 10 mcg

and 725 placebo) children have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the second dose in the 
placebo-controlled blinded follow-up period. The safety evaluation in Study 3 is ongoing. 
The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in participants 5 to 11 years of age was similar to that seen in 
participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in children 5 to 11 years of 
age that received 2 doses were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 50%), headache (> 30%), 
injection site redness and swelling (≥ 20%), myalgia, chills, and diarrhoea (> 10%). 
Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – after booster dose  
In a subset from Study 3, a total of 401 children 5 to 11 years of age received a booster dose of 
Comirnaty 10 mcg at least 5 months (range of 5 to 9 months) after completing the primary series. The 
analysis of the Study 3 Phase 2/3 subset is based on data up to the cut-off date of 22 March 2022 
(median follow-up time of 1.3 months). 
The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after the primary course. The 
most frequent adverse reactions in children 5 to 11 years of age were injection site pain (> 70%), 
fatigue (> 40%), headache (> 30%), myalgia, chills, injection site redness and swelling (> 10%). 
Adolescents 12 to 15 years of age – after 2 doses 
In an analysis of long-term safety follow-up in Study 2, 2 260 adolescents (1 131 Comirnaty and 
1 129 placebo) were 12 to 15 years of age. Of these, 1 559 adolescents (786 Comirnaty and 
773 placebo) have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the second dose. 
The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age was similar to that seen in 
participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in adolescents 12 to 
15 years of age that received 2 doses were injection site pain (> 90%), fatigue and headache (> 70%), 
myalgia and chills (> 40%), arthralgia and pyrexia (> 20%). 
Participants 16 years of age and older – after 2 doses 
In Study 2, a total of 22 026 participants 16 years of age or older received at least 1 dose of Comirnaty 
30 mcg and a total of 22 021 participants 16 years of age or older received placebo (including 138 and 
145 adolescents 16 and 17 years of age in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively). A total of 
20 519 participants 16 years of age or older received 2 doses of Comirnaty.  
At the time of the analysis of Study 2 with a data cut-off of 13 March 2021 for the placebo-controlled 
blinded follow-up period up to the participants’ unblinding dates, a total of 25 651 (58.2%) 
participants (13 031 Comirnaty and 12 620 placebo) 16 years of age and older were followed up for 
≥ 4 months after the second dose. This included a total of 15 111 (7 704 Comirnaty and 7 407 placebo) 
participants 16 to 55 years of age and a total of 10 540 (5 327 Comirnaty and 5 213 placebo) 
participants 56 years of age and older. 
The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 16 years of age and older that received 2 doses 
were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 50%), myalgia (> 40%), chills 
(> 30%), arthralgia (> 20%), pyrexia and injection site swelling (> 10%) and were usually mild or 
moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of 
reactogenicity events was associated with greater age. 
The safety profile in 545 participants 16 years of age and older receiving Comirnaty, that were 
seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, was similar to that seen in the general population. 
Participants 12 years of age and older – after booster dose 
A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 306 adults 18 to 55 years of age who completed the 
original Comirnaty 2-dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 6 months 
(range of 4.8 to 8.0 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, 
had a median follow-up time of 8.3 months (range 1.1 to 8.5 months) and 301 participants had been 
followed for ≥ 6 months after the booster dose to the cut-off date (22 November 2021).

The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after 2 doses. The most frequent 
adverse reactions in participants 18 to 55 years of age were injection site pain (> 80%), 
fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 40%), myalgia (> 30%), chills and arthralgia (> 20%).  
In Study 4, a placebo-controlled booster study, participants 16 years of age and older recruited from 
Study 2 received a booster dose of Comirnaty (5 081 participants), or placebo (5 044 participants) at 
least 6 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, 
had a median follow-up time of 2.8 months (range 0.3 to 7.5 months) after the booster dose in the 
blinded placebo-controlled follow-up period to the cut-off date (8 February 2022). Of these, 
1 281 participants (895 Comirnaty and 386 placebo) have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the 
booster dose of Comirnaty. No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified. 
A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 825 adolescents 12 to 15 years of age who completed 
the original Comirnaty 2-dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 
11.2 months (range of 6.3 to 20.1 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a 
booster dose, had a median follow-up time of 9.5 months (range 1.5 to 10.7 months) based on data up 
to the cut-off date (3 November 2022). No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified. 
Booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine  
In 5 independent studies on the use of a Comirnaty booster dose in individuals who had completed 
primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose), no new 
safety issues were identified.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Myocarditis and pericarditis 
The increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty is highest in younger males (see 
section 4.4). 
Two large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have estimated the excess risk in younger 
males following the second dose of Comirnaty. One study showed that in a period of 7 days after the 
second dose there were about 0.265 (95% CI 0.255 - 0.275) extra cases of myocarditis in 12-29 year 
old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. In another study, in a period of 28 days after the 
second dose there were 0.56 (95% CI 0.37 - 0.74) extra cases of myocarditis in 16-24 year old males 
per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. 
Limited data indicate that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty in 
children aged 5 to 11 years seems lower than in ages 12 to 17 years. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V and include batch/Lot number if available. 
4.9  Overdose 
Overdose data is available from 52 study participants included in the clinical trial that due to an error 
in dilution received 58 micrograms of Comirnaty. The vaccine recipients did not report an increase in 
reactogenicity or adverse reactions.  
In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is 
recommended.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BN01 
Mechanism of action 
The nucleoside-modified messenger RNA in Comirnaty is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which 
enable delivery of the non-replicating RNA into host cells to direct transient expression of the 
SARS-CoV-2 S antigen. The mRNA codes for membrane-anchored, full-length S with two point 
mutations within the central helix. Mutation of these two amino acids to proline locks S in an 
antigenically preferred prefusion conformation. The vaccine elicits both neutralizing antibody and 
cellular immune responses to the spike (S) antigen, which may contribute to protection against 
COVID-19. 
Efficacy 
Study 2 is a multicentre, multinational, Phase 1/2/3 randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind 
dose-finding, vaccine candidate selection and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. 
Randomisation was stratified by age: 12 to 15 years of age, 16 to 55 years of age, or 56 years of age 
and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the ≥ 56-year stratum. The study excluded 
participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological 
diagnosis of COVID-19. Participants with pre-existing stable disease, defined as disease not requiring 
significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before 
enrolment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV).  
Efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older – after 2 doses 
In the Phase 2/3 portion of Study 2, based on data accrued through 14 November 2020, approximately 
44 000 participants were randomised equally and were to receive 2 doses of COVID-19 mRNA 
Vaccine or placebo. The efficacy analyses included participants that received their second vaccination 
within 19 to 42 days after their first vaccination. The majority (93.1%) of vaccine recipients received 
the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Participants are planned to be followed for up to 
24 months after Dose 2, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID-19. In the clinical 
study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 14 days before and after 
administration of an influenza vaccine in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA 
Vaccine. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 60 days 
before or after receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins within through conclusion of the 
study in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine. 
The population for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included 36 621 participants 12 years 
of age and older (18 242 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 18 379 in the placebo group) 
who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 through 7 days after the second dose. 
In addition, 134 participants were between the ages of 16 to 17 years of age (66 in the COVID-19 
mRNA Vaccine group and 68 in the placebo group) and 1 616 participants 75 years of age and older 
(804 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 812 in the placebo group). 
At the time of the primary efficacy analysis, participants had been followed for symptomatic 
COVID-19 for in total 2 214 person-years for the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and in total 
2 222 person-years in the placebo group.  
There were no meaningful clinical differences in overall vaccine efficacy in participants who were at 
risk of severe COVID-19 including those with 1 or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe 
COVID-19 (e.g. asthma, body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes 
mellitus, hypertension).

during the period when Wuhan/Wild type and Alpha variants were the predominant circulating strains 
in participants in the evaluable efficacy population with or without evidence of prior infection with 
SARS-CoV-2.  
Additionally, the updated efficacy analyses by subgroup showed similar efficacy point estimates 
across sexes, ethnic groups, geography and participants with medical comorbidities and obesity 
associated with high risk of severe COVID-19.  
Efficacy against severe COVID-19  
Updated efficacy analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints supported benefit of the COVID-19 mRNA 
Vaccine in preventing severe COVID‑19. 
As of 13 March 2021, vaccine efficacy against severe COVID-19 is presented only for participants 
with or without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 4) as the COVID-19 case counts in participants 
without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection were the same as those in participants with or without prior 
SARS-CoV-2 infection in both the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and placebo groups.

Efficacy and immunogenicity in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age – after 2 doses 
In an initial analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (representing a median follow-up 
duration of > 2 months after Dose 2) without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 
1 005 participants who received the vaccine and 16 cases out of 978 who received placebo. The point 
estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 75.3, 100.0). In participants with or without 
evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 18 cases in 
1 110 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% 
(95% confidence interval 78.1, 100.0).  
Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additional confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued during 
blinded placebo-controlled follow-up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy 
population.  
In the updated efficacy analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age without evidence of 
prior infection, there were no cases in 1 057 participants who received the vaccine and 28 cases out of 
68 
 
 
 
 
1 030 who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 86.8, 
100.0) during the period when Alpha variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants 
with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 
30 cases  in 1 109 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy 
is 100% (95% confidence interval 87.5, 100.0). 
In Study 2, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising titres 1 month after Dose 2 was conducted in a 
randomly selected subset of participants who had no serological or virological evidence of past 
SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, comparing the response in adolescents 12 to 
15 years of age (n = 190) to participants 16 to 25 years of age (n = 170).  
The ratio of the geometric mean titres (GMT) in the 12 to 15 years of age group to the 16 to 25 years 
of age group was 1.76, with a 2-sided 95% CI of 1.47 to 2.10. Therefore, the 1.5-fold noninferiority 
criterion was met as the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio [GMR] was 
> 0.67. 
Efficacy and immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – 
after 2 doses 
Study 3 is a Phase 1/2/3 study comprised of an open-label vaccine dose-finding portion (Phase 1) and 
a multicentre, multinational, randomised, saline placebo-controlled, observer-blind efficacy portion 
(Phase 2/3) that has enrolled participants 5 to 11 years of age. The majority (94.4%) of randomised 
vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. 
Initial descriptive vaccine efficacy results in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior 
SARS-CoV-2 infection are presented in Table 5. No cases of COVID-19 were observed in either the 
vaccine group or the placebo group in participants with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In the efficacy analysis of Study 3 in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior infection, 
there were 10 cases in 2 703 participants who received the vaccine and 42 cases out of 1 348 who 
received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 88.2% (95% confidence interval 76.2, 94.7) during 
the period when Delta variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants with or without 
evidence of prior infection there were 12 cases in the 3 018 who received vaccine and 42 cases in 
1 511 participants who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 85.7% (95% confidence 
interval 72.4, 93.2). 
In Study 3, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralising titres (NT50) 1 month after Dose 2 in a 
randomly selected subset of participants demonstrated effectiveness by immunobridging of immune 
responses comparing children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) in the Phase 2/3 
part of Study 3 to participants 16 to 25 years of age in the Phase 2/3 part of Study 2 who had no 
serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, meeting 
the prespecified immunobridging criteria for both the geometric mean ratio (GMR) and the 
seroresponse difference with seroresponse defined as achieving at least 4-fold rise in SARS-CoV-2 
NT50 from baseline (before Dose 1).  
The GMR of the SARS-CoV-2 NT50 1 month after Dose 2 in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to 
less than 12 years of age) to that of young adults 16 to 25 years of age was 1.04 (2-sided 95% CI: 0.93, 
1.18). Among participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after 
Dose 2, 99.2% of children 5 to 11 years of age and 99.2% of participants 16 to 25 years of age had a 
seroresponse at 1 month after Dose 2. The difference in proportions of participants who had 
seroresponse between the 2 age groups (children – young adult) was 0.0% (2-sided 95% CI: -2.0%, 
2.2%). This information is presented in Table 6.

Immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – after booster 
dose  
A booster dose of Comirnaty was given to 401 randomly selected participants in Study 3. 
Effectiveness of a booster dose in ages 5 to 11 is inferred by immunogenicity. The immunogenicity of 
this was assessed through NT50 against the reference strain of SARS-CoV-2 (USA_WA1/2020). 
Analyses of NT50 1 month after the booster dose compared to before the booster dose demonstrated a 
substantial increase in GMTs in individuals 5 through 11 years of age who had no serological or 
virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after the dose 2 and the booster 
dose. This analysis is summarized in Table 7.

Efficacy and immunogenicity of a 3-dose primary course in infants and children 6 months to 4 years of 
age 
The efficacy analysis of Study 3 was performed across the combined population of participants 
6 months through 4 years of age based on cases confirmed among 873 participants in the COVID-19 
mRNA Vaccine group and 381 participants in the placebo group (2:1 randomization ratio) who 
received all 3 doses of study intervention during the blinded follow-up period when the Omicron 
variant of SARS-CoV-2 (BA.2) was the predominant variant in circulation (data cut-off date of 
17 June 2022).

Immunogenicity analyses have been performed in the immunobridging subset of 82 Study 3 
participants 6 to 23 months of age and 143 Study 3 participants 2 to 4 years of age without evidence of 
infection up to 1 month after Dose 3 based on a data cut-off date of 29 April 2022.  
SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralising antibody titres (NT50) were compared between an immunogenicity 
subset of Phase 2/3 participants 6 to 23 months of age and 2 to 4 years of age from Study 3 at 1 month 
after the 3-dose primary course and a randomly selected subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants 16 
to 25 years of age at 1 month after the 2-dose primary course, using a microneutralisation assay 
against the reference strain (USA_WA1/2020).  
The primary immunobridging analyses compared the geometric mean titres (using a geometric mean 
ratio [GMR]) and the seroresponse (defined as achieving at least 4-fold rise in SARS-CoV-2 NT50 
from before Dose 1) rates in the evaluable immunogenicity population of participants without 
evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 3 in participants 6 to 23 months of 
age and 2 to 4 years of age and up to 1 month after Dose 2 in participants 16 to 25 years of age. The 
prespecified immunobridging criteria were met for both the GMR and the seroresponse difference for 
both age groups (Table 9).

Note: Participants who had no serological or virological evidence [(up to 1 month after Dose 2 (Study 2) or 
1 month after Dose 3 (Study 3) blood sample collection)] of past SARS-CoV-2 infection [(i.e. N-binding 
antibody [serum] negative at Dose 1, Dose 3 (Study 3) and 1 month after Dose 2 (Study 2) or 1 month after 
Dose 3 (Study 3), SARS-CoV-2 not detected by NAAT [nasal swab] at Dose 1, Dose 2, and Dose 3 (Study 3) 
study visits, and negative NAAT (nasal swab) at any unscheduled visit up to 1 month after Dose 2 (Study 2) or 
1 month after Dose 3 (Study 3) blood collection)] and had no medical history of COVID-19 were included in the 
analysis. 
Note: Seroresponse is defined as achieving a ≥ 4-fold rise from baseline (before Dose 1). If the baseline 
measurement is below the LLOQ, a postvaccination assay result ≥ 4 × LLOQ is considered a seroresponse. 
a.  N = Number of participants with valid and determinate assay results for the specified assay at the given 
dose/sampling time point for GMTs and number of participants with valid and determinate assay results for 
the specified assay at both baseline and the given dose/sampling time point for seroresponse rates.  
b.  GMTs and 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the mean logarithm of the titres and the 
corresponding CIs (based on the Student t distribution). Assay results below the LLOQ were set to 
0.5 × LLOQ. 
c.  GMRs and 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the mean difference of the logarithms of the 
titres (younger age group minus 16 to 25 years of age) and the corresponding CI (based on the 
Student t distribution). 
d.  For each younger age group (2 to 4 years, 6 to 23 months), immunobridging based on GMR is declared if the 
lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR ratio is greater than 0.67 and the point estimate of the GMR 
is ≥ 0.8. 
e.  SARS-CoV-2 NT50 were determined using the SARS-CoV-2 mNeonGreen Virus Microneutralisation 
Assay. The assay uses a fluorescent reporter virus derived from the USA_WA1/2020 strain and virus 
neutralization is read on Vero cell monolayers. The sample NT50 is defined as the reciprocal serum dilution 
at which 50% of the virus is neutralised. 
f.  n = Number of participants with seroresponse for the given assay at the given dose/sampling time point. 
g.  Exact 2-sided CI based on the Clopper and Pearson method. 
h.  Difference in proportions, expressed as a percentage (younger age group minus 16 to 25 years of age). 
i.  2-sided CI, based on the Miettinen and Nurminen method for the difference in proportions, expressed as a 
percentage. 
j.  For each younger age group (2 to 4 years, 6 to 23 months), immunobridging based on seroresponse rate is 
declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in proportions is greater than -10.0% 
provided that the immunobridging criteria based on GMR were met. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Comirnaty in the paediatric population in prevention of COVID-19 (see section 4.2 for information on 
paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Not applicable. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose 
toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity. 
General toxicity 
Rats intramuscularly administered Comirnaty (receiving 3 full human doses once weekly, generating 
relatively higher levels in rats due to body weight differences) demonstrated some injection site 
oedema and erythema and increases in white blood cells (including basophils and eosinophils) 
consistent with an inflammatory response as well as vacuolation of portal hepatocytes without 
evidence of liver injury. All effects were reversible. 
74 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Genotoxicity/Carcinogenicity 
Neither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies were performed. The components of the vaccine (lipids 
and mRNA) are not expected to have genotoxic potential.  
Reproductive toxicity 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity were investigated in rats in a combined fertility and 
developmental toxicity study where female rats were intramuscularly administered Comirnaty prior to 
mating and during gestation (receiving 4 full human doses that generate relatively higher levels in rat 
due to body weight differences, spanning between pre-mating day 21 and gestational day 20). 
SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody responses were present in maternal animals from prior to mating 
to the end of the study on postnatal day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no 
vaccine-related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo-foetal or offspring development. No 
Comirnaty data are available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 (15/15 micrograms)/dose dispersion for injection is indicated for 
active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, in individuals 12 years of age and 
older who have previously received at least a primary vaccination course against COVID-19 (see 
sections 4.2 and 5.1).  
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Individuals 12 years of age and older 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 is administered intramuscularly as a single dose of 0.3 mL for 
individuals 12 years of age and older who have previously received at least a primary vaccination 
course against COVID-19 (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For individuals who have previously been vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.1 should be administered at least 3 months after the most recent dose of a 
COVID-19 vaccine.  
Severely immunocompromised aged 12 years and older 
Additional doses may be administered to individuals who are severely immunocompromised in 
accordance with national recommendations (see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
There are paediatric formulations available for infants aged 6 months and above and children below 
12 years of age. For details, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for other 
formulations. 
The safety and efficacy of the vaccine in children aged less than 6 months have not yet been 
established. 
Elderly population 
No dose adjustment is required in elderly individuals ≥ 65 years of age. 
Method of administration 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 (15/15 micrograms)/dose dispersion for injection should be 
administered intramuscularly (see section 6.6). Do not dilute prior to use. 
Vials of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 contain 6 doses of 0.3 mL of vaccine. In order to extract 
6 doses from a single vial, low dead-volume syringes and/or needles should be used. The low 
dead-volume syringe and needle combination should have a dead volume of no more than 
35 microlitres. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract 
a sixth dose from a single vial. Irrespective of the type of syringe and needle: 
• 
• 
Each dose must contain 0.3 mL of vaccine. 
If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.3 mL, discard the 
vial and any excess volume.  
Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials. 
• 
The preferred site is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. 
Do not inject the vaccine intravascularly, subcutaneously or intradermally.  
The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products. 
For precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4. 
For instructions regarding thawing, handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

General recommendations 
Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis 
Events of anaphylaxis have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should 
always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the 
vaccine.  
Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. No further dose of 
the vaccine should be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis after a prior dose of 
Comirnaty. 
Myocarditis and pericarditis 
There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Comirnaty. These 
conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 
14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger 
males (see section 4.8). Available data indicate that most cases recover. Some cases required intensive 
care support and fatal cases have been observed. 
Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. 
Vaccinees (including parents or caregivers) should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention 
if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest 
pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination. 
Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this 
condition. 
Anxiety-related reactions 
Anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress‐related 
reactions (e.g. dizziness, palpitations, increases in heart rate, alterations in blood pressure, 
paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia and sweating) may occur in association with the vaccination process itself. 
Stress-related reactions are temporary and resolve on their own. Individuals should be advised to bring 
symptoms to the attention of the vaccination provider for evaluation. It is important that precautions 
are in place to avoid injury from fainting. 
Concurrent illness 
Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute 
infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination. 
Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders 
As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals 
receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as 
haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in 
these individuals. 
Immunocompromised individuals 
The efficacy and safety of the vaccine has not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, 
including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of Comirnaty Original/Omicron 
BA.1 may be lower in immunocompromised individuals. 
Duration of protection 
The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by 
ongoing clinical trials.  
Limitations of vaccine effectiveness 
As with any vaccine, vaccination with Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 may not protect all vaccine 
recipients. Individuals may not be fully protected until 7 days after their vaccination.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
Concomitant administration of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 with other vaccines has not been 
studied. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 during pregnancy.  
However, a large amount of observational data from pregnant women vaccinated with the initially 
approved Comirnaty vaccine during the second and third trimester have not shown an increase in 
adverse pregnancy outcomes. While data on pregnancy outcomes following vaccination during the 
first trimester are presently limited, no increased risk for miscarriage has been seen. Animal studies do 
not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, 
parturition or post-natal development (see section 5.3). Since differences between products are 
confined to the spike protein sequence, and there are no clinically meaningful differences in 
reactogenicity, Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 can be used during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 during 
breast-feeding. 
However, no effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of 
breast-feeding woman to the vaccine is negligible. Observational data from women who were 
breast-feeding after vaccination with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine have not shown a risk 
for adverse effects in breastfed newborns/infants. Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 can be used 
during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use 
machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the 
ability to drive or use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 
Participants > 55 years of age – after a booster dose of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 (fourth 
dose) 
In a subset from Study 4 (Phase 3), 305 adults > 55 years of age who had completed 3 doses of 
Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 (15/15 mcg) 4.7 to 
11.5 months after receiving Dose 3. Participants who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.1 had a median follow-up time of at least 1.7 months.  
82 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The overall safety profile for the Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 booster (fourth dose) was similar 
to that seen after the Comirnaty booster (third dose). The most frequent adverse reactions in 
participants greater than 55 years of age were injection site pain (> 50%), fatigue (> 40%), headache 
(> 30%), myalgia (> 20%), chills and arthralgia (> 10%). No new adverse reactions were identified for 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1. 
Participants 18 to ≤ 55 years of age – after a booster dose of monovalent Omicron BA.1 (fourth dose) 
The safety of a Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 booster dose in individuals from 18 to ≤ 55 years 
of age is extrapolated from safety data from a subset of 315 adults 18 to ≤ 55 years of age who 
received a booster (fourth dose) of Omicron BA.1 30 mcg (monovalent) after completing 3 doses of 
Comirnaty. The most frequent adverse reactions in these participants 18 to ≤ 55 years of age were 
injection site pain (> 70%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 40%), myalgia (> 30%), chills (> 30%) and 
arthralgia (> 20%). 
Comirnaty 30 mcg 
Participants 16 years of age and older – after 2 doses 
In Study 2, a total of 22 026 participants 16 years of age or older received at least 1 dose of Comirnaty 
and a total of 22 021 participants 16 years of age or older received placebo (including 138 and 
145 adolescents 16 and 17 years of age in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively). A total of 
20 519 participants 16 years of age or older received 2 doses of Comirnaty.  
At the time of the analysis of Study 2 with a data cut-off of 13 March 2021 for the placebo-controlled 
blinded follow-up period up to the participants’ unblinding dates, a total of 25 651 (58.2%) 
participants (13 031 Comirnaty and 12 620 placebo) 16 years of age and older were followed up for 
≥ 4 months after the second dose. This included a total of 15 111 (7 704 Comirnaty and 7 407 placebo) 
participants 16 to 55 years of age and a total of 10 540 (5 327 Comirnaty and 5 213 placebo) 
participants 56 years of age and older. 
The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 16 years of age and older that received 2 doses 
were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 50%), myalgia (> 40%), chills 
(> 30%), arthralgia (> 20%), pyrexia and injection site swelling (> 10%) and were usually mild or 
moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of 
reactogenicity events was associated with greater age. 
The safety profile in 545 participants 16 years of age and older receiving Comirnaty, that were 
seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, was similar to that seen in the general population. 
Adolescents 12 to 15 years of age – after 2 doses 
In an analysis of long-term safety follow-up in Study 2, 2 260 adolescents (1 131 Comirnaty and 
1 129 placebo) were 12 to 15 years of age. Of these, 1 559 adolescents (786 Comirnaty and 
773 placebo) have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. 
The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age was similar to that seen in 
participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in adolescents 12 to 
15 years of age that received 2 doses were injection site pain (> 90%), fatigue and headache (> 70%), 
myalgia and chills (> 40%), arthralgia and pyrexia (> 20%). 
Participants 12 years of age and older – after booster dose 
A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 306 adults 18 to 55 years of age who completed the 
original Comirnaty 2-dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 6 months 
(range of 4.8 to 8.0 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, 
had a median follow-up time of 8.3 months (range 1.1 to 8.5 months) and 301 participants had been 
followed for ≥ 6 months after the booster dose to the cut-off date (22 November 2021). 
The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after 2 doses. The most frequent 
adverse reactions in participants 18 to 55 years of age were injection site pain (> 80%), 
fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 40%), myalgia (> 30%), chills and arthralgia (> 20%).

In Study 4, a placebo-controlled booster study, participants 16 years of age and older recruited from 
Study 2 received a booster dose of Comirnaty (5 081 participants), or placebo (5 044 participants) at 
least 6 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, 
had a median follow-up time of 2.8 months (range 0.3 to 7.5 months) after the booster dose in the 
blinded placebo-controlled follow-up period to the cut-off date (8 February 2022). Of these, 
1 281 participants (895 Comirnaty and 386 placebo) have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the 
booster dose of Comirnaty. No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified. 
A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 825 adolescents 12 to 15 years of age who completed 
the original Comirnaty 2-dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 11.2 
months (range of 6.3 to 20.1 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a 
booster dose, had a median follow-up time of 9.5 months (range 1.5 to 10.7 months) based on data up 
to the cut-off date (3 November 2022). No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified. 
Booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine 
In 5 independent studies on the use of a Comirnaty booster dose in individuals who had completed 
primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose), no new 
safety issues were identified (see section 5.1).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Myocarditis and pericarditis 
The increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty is highest in younger males (see 
section 4.4). 
Two large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have estimated the excess risk in younger 
males following the second dose of Comirnaty. One study showed that in a period of 7 days after the 
second dose there were about 0.265 (95% CI 0.255 - 0.275) extra cases of myocarditis in 12-29 year 
old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. In another study, in a period of 28 days after the 
second dose there were 0.56 (95% CI 0.37 - 0.74) extra cases of myocarditis in 16-24 year old males 
per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. 
Limited data indicate that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty in 
children aged 5 to 11 years seems lower than in ages 12 to 17 years. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V and include batch/Lot number if available. 
4.9  Overdose 
Overdose data is available from 52 study participants included in the clinical trial that due to an error 
in dilution received 58 micrograms of Comirnaty. The vaccine recipients did not report an increase in 
reactogenicity or adverse reactions.  
In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is 
recommended.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BN01 
Mechanism of action 
The nucleoside-modified messenger RNA in Comirnaty is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which 
enable delivery of the non-replicating RNA into host cells to direct transient expression of the 
SARS-CoV-2 S antigen. The mRNA codes for membrane-anchored, full-length S with two point 
mutations within the central helix. Mutation of these two amino acids to proline locks S in an 
antigenically preferred prefusion conformation. The vaccine elicits both neutralizing antibody and 
cellular immune responses to the spike (S) antigen, which may contribute to protection against 
COVID-19. 
Efficacy 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 
Relative vaccine immunogenicity in participants > 55 years of age – after a booster dose of Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.1 (fourth dose) 
In an interim analysis of a subset from Study 4 (Substudy E), 610 adults greater than 55 years of age 
who had completed a series of 3 doses of Comirnaty received 1 of the following as a booster dose 
(fourth dose): Comirnaty (30 mcg) or Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 (15/15 mcg). GMRs and 
seroresponse rates were evaluated at 1 month after Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 (15/15 mcg) 
booster vaccination up to a data cut-off date of 16 May 2022, which represents a median of at least 
1.7 months post-booster follow-up. The Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 (15/15 mcg) booster dose 
was administered 4.7 to 11.5 months (median 6.3 months) after the third dose.  
The primary objective of the analysis was to assess superiority with respect to level of neutralising 
titre and noninferiority with respect to seroresponse rate of the anti-Omicron immune response 
induced by a dose of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 (15/15 mcg) relative to the response elicited 
by a dose of Comirnaty (30 mcg) given as a fourth dose in Comirnaty-experienced participants greater 
than 55 years of age. 
Superiority of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 (15/15 mcg) to Comirnaty (30 mcg) was met, as the 
lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for GMR was > 1 (Table 2).  
Seroresponse is defined as achieving ≥ 4-fold rise from baseline (before the study vaccination). If the 
baseline measurement is below the LLOQ, the postvaccination measure of ≥ 4 × LLOQ is considered 
a seroresponse. 
The difference in percentages of participants who achieved seroresponse to Omicron variant between 
the Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 group (71.6%) and Comirnaty group (57%) was 14.6% 
(2-sided 95% CI: 4.0%, 24.9%). Thus, noninferiority was met.

Study 2 is a multicentre, multinational, Phase 1/2/3 randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind 
dose-finding, vaccine candidate selection and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. 
Randomisation was stratified by age: 12 to 15 years of age, 16 to 55 years of age, or 56 years of age 
and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the ≥ 56-year stratum. The study excluded 
participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological 
diagnosis of COVID-19. Participants with pre-existing stable disease, defined as disease not requiring 
significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before 
enrolment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV).  
Efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older – after 2 doses 
In the Phase 2/3 portion of Study 2, based on data accrued through 14 November 2020, approximately 
44 000 participants were randomised equally and were to receive 2 doses of COVID-19 mRNA 
Vaccine or placebo. The efficacy analyses included participants that received their second vaccination 
within 19 to 42 days after their first vaccination. The majority (93.1%) of vaccine recipients received 
the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Participants are planned to be followed for up to 
24 months after Dose 2, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID-19. In the clinical 
study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 14 days before and after 
administration of an influenza vaccine in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA 
Vaccine. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 60 days 
before or after receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins within through conclusion of the 
study in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine. 
The population for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included 36 621 participants 12 years 
of age and older (18 242 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 18 379 in the placebo group) 
87 
 
 
 
 
who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 through 7 days after the second dose. 
In addition, 134 participants were between the ages of 16 to 17 years of age (66 in the COVID-19 
mRNA Vaccine group and 68 in the placebo group) and 1 616 participants 75 years of age and older 
(804 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 812 in the placebo group). 
At the time of the primary efficacy analysis, participants had been followed for symptomatic 
COVID-19 for in total 2 214 person-years for the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and in total 
2 222 person-years in the placebo group.  
There were no meaningful clinical differences in overall vaccine efficacy in participants who were at 
risk of severe COVID-19 including those with 1 or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe 
COVID-19 (e.g. asthma, body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes 
mellitus, hypertension).

Efficacy against severe COVID-19  
Updated efficacy analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints supported benefit of the COVID-19 mRNA 
Vaccine in preventing severe COVID‑19. 
As of 13 March 2021, vaccine efficacy against severe COVID-19 is presented only for participants 
with or without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 5) as the COVID-19 case counts in participants 
without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection were the same as those in participants with or without prior 
SARS-CoV-2 infection in both the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and placebo groups.

1 005 participants who received the vaccine and 16 cases out of 978 who received placebo. The point 
90 
 
 
 
 
 
estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 75.3, 100.0). In participants with or without 
evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 18 cases in 
1 110 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% 
(95% confidence interval 78.1, 100.0).  
Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additional confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued during 
blinded placebo-controlled follow-up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy 
population.  
In the updated efficacy analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age without evidence of 
prior infection, there were no cases in 1 057 participants who received the vaccine and 28 cases out of 
1 030 who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 86.8, 
100.0) during the period when Alpha variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants 
with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 
30 cases  in 1 109 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy 
is 100% (95% confidence interval 87.5, 100.0). 
In Study 2, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising titres 1 month after Dose 2 was conducted in a 
randomly selected subset of participants who had no serological or virological evidence of past 
SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, comparing the response in adolescents 12 to 
15 years of age (n = 190) to participants 16 to 25 years of age (n = 170).  
The ratio of the geometric mean titres (GMT) in the 12 to 15 years of age group to the 16 to 25 years 
of age group was 1.76, with a 2-sided 95% CI of 1.47 to 2.10. Therefore, the 1.5-fold noninferiority 
criterion was met as the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio [GMR] was 
> 0.67. 
Immunogenicity in participants 18 years of age and older – after booster dose 
Effectiveness of a booster dose of Comirnaty was based on an assessment of 50% neutralizing 
antibody titres (NT50) against SARS-CoV-2 (USA_WA1/2020) in Study 2. In this study, the booster 
dose was administered 5 to 8 months (median 7 months) after the second dose. In Study 2, analyses of 
NT50 1 month after the booster dose compared to 1 month after the primary series in individuals 18 
through 55 years of age who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection 
up to 1 month after the booster vaccination demonstrated noninferiority for both geometric mean ratio 
(GMR) and difference in seroresponse rates. Seroresponse for a participant was defined as achieving a 
≥ 4-fold rise in NT50 from baseline (before primary series). These analyses are summarized in 
Table 6.

Relative vaccine efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older – after booster dose 
An interim efficacy analysis of Study 4, a placebo-controlled booster study performed in 
approximately 10 000 participants 16 years of age and older who were recruited from Study 2, 
evaluated confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued from at least 7 days after booster vaccination up to a 
data cut-off date of 5 October 2021, which represents a median of 2.5 months post-booster follow-up. 
92 
 
  
 
The booster dose was administered 5 to 13 months (median 11 months) after the second dose. Vaccine 
efficacy of the Comirnaty booster dose after the primary series relative to the placebo booster group 
who only received the primary series dose was assessed.  
The relative vaccine efficacy information for participants 16 years of age and older without prior 
evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is presented in Table 7. Relative vaccine efficacy in participants 
with or without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was 94.6% (95% confidence interval of 
88.5% to 97.9%), similar to that seen in those participants without evidence of prior infection. Primary 
COVID-19 cases observed from 7 days after booster vaccination were 7 primary cases in the 
Comirnaty group, and 124 primary cases in the placebo group.

Immunogenicity of a booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 
vaccine 
Effectiveness of a Comirnaty booster dose (30 mcg) in individuals who completed primary 
vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose) is inferred from 
immunogenicity data from an independent National Institutes of Health (NIH) study phase 1/2 
open-label clinical trial (NCT04889209) conducted in the United States. In this study, adults (range 19 
to 80 years of age) who had completed primary vaccination with Moderna 100 mcg 2-dose series 
(N = 51, mean age 54±17), Janssen single dose (N = 53, mean age 48±14), or Comirnaty 30 mcg 
2-dose series (N = 50, mean age 50±18) at least 12 weeks prior to enrolment and who reported no 
history of SARS-CoV-2 infection received a booster dose of Comirnaty (30 mcg). The boost with 
Comirnaty induced a 36, 12, and 20 GMR-fold rise in neutralising titres following the Janssen, 
Moderna, and Comirnaty primary doses, respectively. 
Heterologous boosting with Comirnaty was also evaluated in the CoV-BOOST study 
(EudraCT 2021-002175-19), a multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 2 trial of third dose booster 
93 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
vaccination against COVID-19, in which 107 adult participants (median age 71 years of age, 
interquartile range 54 to 77 years of age) were randomised at least 70 days post 2 doses of 
AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine. After the AstraZeneca COVID‑19 Vaccine primary series, 
pseudovirus (wild-type), neutralising antibody NT50 GMR-fold change increased 21.6-fold with 
heterologous Comirnaty booster (n = 95).  
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Comirnaty in the paediatric population in prevention of COVID-19 (see section 4.2 for information on 
paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Not applicable. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose 
toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity. 
General toxicity 
Rats intramuscularly administered Comirnaty (receiving 3 full human doses once weekly, generating 
relatively higher levels in rats due to body weight differences) demonstrated some injection site 
oedema and erythema and increases in white blood cells (including basophils and eosinophils) 
consistent with an inflammatory response as well as vacuolation of portal hepatocytes without 
evidence of liver injury. All effects were reversible. 
Genotoxicity/Carcinogenicity 
Neither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies were performed. The components of the vaccine (lipids 
and mRNA) are not expected to have genotoxic potential.  
Reproductive toxicity 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity were investigated in rats in a combined fertility and 
developmental toxicity study where female rats were intramuscularly administered Comirnaty prior to 
mating and during gestation (receiving 4 full human doses that generate relatively higher levels in rat 
due to body weight differences, spanning between pre-mating day 21 and gestational day 20). 
SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody responses were present in maternal animals from prior to mating 
to the end of the study on postnatal day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no 
vaccine-related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo-foetal or offspring development. No 
Comirnaty data are available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability  
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
General recommendations 
Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis 
Events of anaphylaxis have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should 
always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the 
vaccine.  
Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. No further dose of 
the vaccine should be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis after a prior dose of 
Comirnaty. 
Myocarditis and pericarditis 
There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Comirnaty. These 
conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 
14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger 
males (see section 4.8). Available data indicate that most cases recover. Some cases required intensive 
care support and fatal cases have been observed. 
Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. 
Vaccinees (including parents or caregivers) should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention 
if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest 
pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination. 
Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this 
condition. 
Anxiety-related reactions 
Anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress‐related 
reactions (e.g. dizziness, palpitations, increases in heart rate, alterations in blood pressure, 
paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia and sweating) may occur in association with the vaccination process itself. 
Stress-related reactions are temporary and resolve on their own. Individuals should be advised to bring 
symptoms to the attention of the vaccination provider for evaluation. It is important that precautions 
are in place to avoid injury from fainting. 
Concurrent illness 
Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute 
infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination. 
Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders 
As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals 
receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as 
haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in 
these individuals. 
Immunocompromised individuals 
The efficacy and safety of the vaccine has not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, 
including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of Comirnaty Original/Omicron 
BA.4-5 may be lower in immunocompromised individuals.

Duration of protection 
The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by 
ongoing clinical trials.  
Limitations of vaccine effectiveness 
As with any vaccine, vaccination with Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 may not protect all 
vaccine recipients. Individuals may not be fully protected until 7 days after their vaccination. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
Concomitant administration of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 with other vaccines has not been 
studied. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 during pregnancy.  
However, a large amount of observational data from pregnant women vaccinated with the initially 
approved Comirnaty vaccine during the second and third trimester have not shown an increase in 
adverse pregnancy outcomes. While data on pregnancy outcomes following vaccination during the 
first trimester are presently limited, no increased risk for miscarriage has been seen. Animal studies do 
not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, 
parturition or post-natal development (see section 5.3). Based on data available with other vaccine 
variants, Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 can be used during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 during 
breast-feeding.  
However, no effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of 
breast-feeding woman to the vaccine is negligible. Observational data from women who were 
breast-feeding after vaccination with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine have not shown a risk 
for adverse effects in breastfed newborns/infants. Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 can be used 
during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use 
machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the 
ability to drive or use machines.

Summary of safety profile 
The safety of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 is inferred from safety data from Comirnaty and 
Omicron adapted vaccines. 
Comirnaty 30 mcg 
Participants 16 years of age and older – after 2 doses 
In Study 2, a total of 22 026 participants 16 years of age or older received at least 1 dose of Comirnaty 
and a total of 22 021 participants 16 years of age or older received placebo (including 138 and 
145 adolescents 16 and 17 years of age in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively). A total of 
20 519 participants 16 years of age or older received 2 doses of Comirnaty.  
At the time of the analysis of Study 2 with a data cut-off of 13 March 2021 for the placebo-controlled 
blinded follow-up period up to the participants’ unblinding dates, a total of 25 651 (58.2%) 
participants (13 031 Comirnaty and 12 620 placebo) 16 years of age and older were followed up for 
≥ 4 months after the second dose. This included a total of 15 111 (7 704 Comirnaty and 7 407 placebo) 
participants 16 to 55 years of age and a total of 10 540 (5 327 Comirnaty and 5 213 placebo) 
participants 56 years of age and older. 
The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 16 years of age and older that received 2 doses 
were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 50%), myalgia (> 40%), chills 
(> 30%), arthralgia (> 20%), pyrexia and injection site swelling (> 10%) and were usually mild or 
moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of 
reactogenicity events was associated with greater age. 
The safety profile in 545 participants 16 years of age and older receiving Comirnaty, that were 
seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, was similar to that seen in the general population. 
Adolescents 12 to 15 years of age – after 2 doses 
In an analysis of long-term safety follow-up in Study 2, 2 260 adolescents (1 131 Comirnaty and 
1 129 placebo) were 12 to 15 years of age. Of these, 1 559 adolescents (786 Comirnaty and 
773 placebo) have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. 
The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age was similar to that seen in 
participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in adolescents 12 to 
15 years of age that received 2 doses were injection site pain (> 90%), fatigue and headache (> 70%), 
myalgia and chills (> 40%), arthralgia and pyrexia (> 20%). 
Participants 12 years of age and older – after booster dose 
A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 306 adults 18 to 55 years of age who completed the 
original Comirnaty 2-dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 6 months 
(range of 4.8 to 8.0 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, 
had a median follow-up time of 8.3 months (range 1.1 to 8.5 months) and 301 participants had been 
followed for ≥ 6 months after the booster dose to the cut-off date (22 November 2021). 
The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after 2 doses. The most frequent 
adverse reactions in participants 18 to 55 years of age were injection site pain (> 80%), 
fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 40%), myalgia (> 30%), chills and arthralgia (> 20%).  
In Study 4, a placebo-controlled booster study, participants 16 years of age and older recruited from 
Study 2 received a booster dose of Comirnaty (5 081 participants), or placebo (5 044 participants) at 
least 6 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, 
had a median follow-up time of 2.8 months (range 0.3 to 7.5 months) after the booster dose in the 
blinded placebo-controlled follow-up period to the cut-off date (8 February 2022). Of these, 
102 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1 281 participants (895 Comirnaty and 386 placebo) have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the 
booster dose of Comirnaty. No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified. 
A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 825 adolescents 12 to 15 years of age who completed 
the original Comirnaty 2-dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 11.2 
months (range of 6.3 to 20.1 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a 
booster dose, had a median follow-up time of 9.5 months (range 1.5 to 10.7 months) based on data up 
to the cut-off date (3 November 2022). No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified. 
Booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine  
In 5 independent studies on the use of a Comirnaty booster dose in individuals who had completed 
primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose), no new 
safety issues were identified (see section 5.1). 
Omicron-adapted Comirnaty 
Participants 12 years of age and older – after a booster dose of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 
(fourth dose) 
In a subset from Study 5 (Phase 2/3), 107 participants 12 to 17 years of age, 313 participants 18 to 
55 years of age and 306 participants 56 years of age and older who had completed 3 doses of 
Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 
(15/15 micrograms) 5.4 to 16.9 months after receiving Dose 3. Participants who received a booster 
(fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 had a median follow-up time of at least 1.5 
months. 
The overall safety profile for the Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 booster (fourth dose) was 
similar to that seen after 3 doses. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 12 years of age 
and older were injection site pain (> 60%), fatigue (> 50%), headache (> 40%), muscle pain (> 20%), 
chills (> 10%), and joint pain (> 10%).

g.  Facial swelling in vaccine recipients with a history of injection of dermatological fillers has been reported in 
the post-marketing phase. 
h.  Most cases appeared to be non-serious and temporary in nature. 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Myocarditis and pericarditis 
The increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty is highest in younger males (see 
section 4.4). 
Two large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have estimated the excess risk in younger 
males following the second dose of Comirnaty. One study showed that in a period of 7 days after the 
second dose there were about 0.265 (95% CI 0.255 - 0.275) extra cases of myocarditis in 12-29 year 
old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. In another study, in a period of 28 days after the 
second dose there were 0.56 (95% CI 0.37 - 0.74) extra cases of myocarditis in 16-24 year old males 
per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. 
Limited data indicate that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty in 
children aged 5 to 11 years seems lower than in ages 12 to 17 years. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V and include batch/Lot number if available. 
4.9  Overdose 
Overdose data is available from 52 study participants included in the clinical trial that due to an error 
in dilution received 58 micrograms of Comirnaty. The vaccine recipients did not report an increase in 
reactogenicity or adverse reactions.  
In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is 
recommended.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BN01 
Mechanism of action 
The nucleoside-modified messenger RNA in Comirnaty is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which 
enable delivery of the non-replicating RNA into host cells to direct transient expression of the 
SARS-CoV-2 S antigen. The mRNA codes for membrane-anchored, full-length S with two point 
mutations within the central helix. Mutation of these two amino acids to proline locks S in an 
antigenically preferred prefusion conformation. The vaccine elicits both neutralizing antibody and 
cellular immune responses to the spike (S) antigen, which may contribute to protection against 
COVID-19. 
Efficacy 
Omicron-adapted Comirnaty 
Immunogenicity in participants 12 years of age and older – after the booster (fourth dose) 
In an analysis of a subset from Study 5, 105 participants 12 to 17 years of age, 297 participants 18 to 
55 years of age, and 286 participants 56 years of age and older who had previously received a 2-dose 
primary series and booster dose with Comirnaty received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5. In participants 12 to 17 years of age, 18 to 55 years of age, and 56 years of 
age and older, 75.2%, 71.7% and 61.5% were positive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, respectively. 
Analyses of 50% neutralizing antibody titres (NT50) against Omicron BA.4-5 and against reference 
strain among participants 56 years of age and older who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 in Study 5 compared to a subset of participants from Study 4 who received 
a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty demonstrated superiority of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 
to Comirnaty based on geometric mean ratio (GMR) and noninferiority based on difference in 
seroresponse rates with respect to anti-Omicron BA.4-5 response, and noninferiority of anti-reference 
strain immune response based on GMR (Table 2). 
Analyses of NT50 against Omicron BA.4/BA.5 among participants 18 to 55 years of age compared to 
participants 56 years of age and older who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 in Study 5 demonstrated noninferiority of anti-Omicron BA.4-5 response 
among participants 18 to 55 years of age compared to participants 56 years of age and older for both 
GMR and difference in seroresponse rates (Table 2). 
The study also assessed the level of NT50 of the anti-Omicron BA.4-5 SARS-CoV-2 and reference 
strains pre-vaccination and 1 month after vaccination in participants who received a booster (fourth 
dose) (Table 3).

Study 2 is a multicentre, multinational, Phase 1/2/3 randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind 
dose-finding, vaccine candidate selection and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. 
Randomisation was stratified by age: 12 to 15 years of age, 16 to 55 years of age, or 56 years of age 
and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the ≥ 56-year stratum. The study excluded 
participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological 
diagnosis of COVID-19. Participants with pre-existing stable disease, defined as disease not requiring 
significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before 
enrolment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV).  
Efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older – after 2 doses 
In the Phase 2/3 portion of Study 2, based on data accrued through 14 November 2020, approximately 
44 000 participants were randomised equally and were to receive 2 doses of the initially approved 
COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine or placebo. The efficacy analyses included participants that received their 
107 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
second vaccination within 19 to 42 days after their first vaccination. The majority (93.1%) of vaccine 
recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Participants are planned to be 
followed for up to 24 months after Dose 2, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID-19. 
In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 14 days before and 
after administration of an influenza vaccine in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA 
Vaccine. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 60 days 
before or after receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins within through conclusion of the 
study in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine. 
The population for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included 36 621 participants 12 years 
of age and older (18 242 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 18 379 in the placebo group) 
who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 through 7 days after the second dose. 
In addition, 134 participants were between the ages of 16 to 17 years of age (66 in the COVID-19 
mRNA Vaccine group and 68 in the placebo group) and 1 616 participants 75 years of age and older 
(804 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 812 in the placebo group). 
At the time of the primary efficacy analysis, participants had been followed for symptomatic 
COVID-19 for in total 2 214 person-years for the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and in total 
2 222 person-years in the placebo group.  
There were no meaningful clinical differences in overall vaccine efficacy in participants who were at 
risk of severe COVID-19 including those with 1 or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe 
COVID-19 (e.g. asthma, body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes 
mellitus, hypertension).

Efficacy against severe COVID-19  
Updated efficacy analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints supported benefit of the COVID-19 mRNA 
Vaccine in preventing severe COVID‑19. 
As of 13 March 2021, vaccine efficacy against severe COVID-19 is presented only for participants 
with or without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 6) as the COVID-19 case counts in participants 
without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection were the same as those in participants with or without prior

Efficacy and immunogenicity in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age – after 2 doses 
In an initial analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (representing a median follow-up 
duration of > 2 months after Dose 2) without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 
1 005 participants who received the vaccine and 16 cases out of 978 who received placebo. The point 
estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 75.3, 100.0). In participants with or without 
evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 18 cases in 
1 110 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% 
(95% confidence interval 78.1, 100.0).  
Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additional confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued during 
blinded placebo-controlled follow-up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy 
population.  
In the updated efficacy analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age without evidence of 
prior infection, there were no cases in 1 057 participants who received the vaccine and 28 cases out of 
1 030 who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 86.8, 
100.0) during the period when Alpha variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants 
with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 
30 cases  in 1 109 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy 
is 100% (95% confidence interval 87.5, 100.0). 
In Study 2, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising titres 1 month after Dose 2 was conducted in a 
randomly selected subset of participants who had no serological or virological evidence of past 
SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, comparing the response in adolescents 12 to 
15 years of age (n = 190) to participants 16 to 25 years of age (n = 170).  
The ratio of the geometric mean titres (GMT) in the 12 to 15 years of age group to the 16 to 25 years 
of age group was 1.76, with a 2-sided 95% CI of 1.47 to 2.10. Therefore, the 1.5-fold noninferiority 
criterion was met as the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio [GMR] was 
> 0.67. 
Immunogenicity in participants 18 years of age and older – after booster dose 
Effectiveness of a booster dose of Comirnaty was based on an assessment of 50% neutralizing 
antibody titres (NT50) against SARS-CoV-2 (USA_WA1/2020) in Study 2. In this study, the booster 
dose was administered 5 to 8 months (median 7 months) after the second dose. In Study 2, analyses of 
NT50 1 month after the booster dose compared to 1 month after the primary series in individuals 18 
through 55 years of age who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection 
up to 1 month after the booster vaccination demonstrated noninferiority for both geometric mean ratio 
(GMR) and difference in seroresponse rates. Seroresponse for a participant was defined as achieving a 
≥ 4-fold rise in NT50 from baseline (before primary series). These analyses are summarized in 
Table 7.

Relative vaccine efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older – after booster dose 
An interim efficacy analysis of Study 4, a placebo-controlled booster study performed in 
approximately 10 000 participants 16 years of age and older who were recruited from Study 2, 
evaluated confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued from at least 7 days after booster vaccination up to a 
data cut-off date of 5 October 2021, which represents a median of 2.5 months post-booster follow-up. 
112 
 
  
 
The booster dose was administered 5 to 13 months (median 11 months) after the second dose. Vaccine 
efficacy of the Comirnaty booster dose after the primary series relative to the placebo booster group 
who only received the primary series dose was assessed.  
The relative vaccine efficacy information for participants 16 years of age and older without prior 
evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is presented in Table 8. Relative vaccine efficacy in participants 
with or without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was 94.6% (95% confidence interval of 
88.5% to 97.9%), similar to that seen in those participants without evidence of prior infection. Primary 
COVID-19 cases observed from 7 days after booster vaccination were 7 primary cases in the 
Comirnaty group, and 124 primary cases in the placebo group.

Immunogenicity of a booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 
vaccine 
Effectiveness of a Comirnaty booster dose (30 mcg) in individuals who completed primary 
vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose) is inferred from 
immunogenicity data from an independent National Institutes of Health (NIH) study phase 1/2 
open-label clinical trial (NCT04889209) conducted in the United States. In this study, adults (range 19 
to 80 years of age) who had completed primary vaccination with Moderna 100 mcg 2-dose series 
(N = 51, mean age 54±17), Janssen single dose (N = 53, mean age 48±14), or Comirnaty 30 mcg 
2-dose series (N = 50, mean age 50±18) at least 12 weeks prior to enrolment and who reported no 
history of SARS-CoV-2 infection received a booster dose of Comirnaty (30 mcg). The boost with 
Comirnaty induced a 36, 12, and 20 GMR-fold rise in neutralising titres following the Janssen, 
Moderna, and Comirnaty primary doses, respectively. 
Heterologous boosting with Comirnaty was also evaluated in the CoV-BOOST study 
(EudraCT 2021-002175-19), a multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 2 trial of third dose booster 
vaccination against COVID-19, in which 107 adult participants (median age 71 years of age, 
113 
 
 
 
 
 
interquartile range 54 to 77 years of age) were randomised at least 70 days post 2 doses of 
AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine. After the AstraZeneca COVID‑19 Vaccine primary series, 
pseudovirus (wild-type), neutralising antibody NT50 GMR-fold change increased 21.6-fold with 
heterologous Comirnaty booster (n = 95).

Comirnaty in the paediatric population in prevention of COVID-19 (see section 4.2 for information on 
paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Not applicable. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose 
toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity. 
General toxicity 
Rats intramuscularly administered Comirnaty (receiving 3 full human doses once weekly, generating 
relatively higher levels in rats due to body weight differences) demonstrated some injection site 
oedema and erythema and increases in white blood cells (including basophils and eosinophils) 
consistent with an inflammatory response as well as vacuolation of portal hepatocytes without 
evidence of liver injury. All effects were reversible. 
Genotoxicity/Carcinogenicity 
Neither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies were performed. The components of the vaccine (lipids 
and mRNA) are not expected to have genotoxic potential.  
Reproductive toxicity 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity were investigated in rats in a combined fertility and 
developmental toxicity study where female rats were intramuscularly administered Comirnaty prior to 
mating and during gestation (receiving 4 full human doses that generate relatively higher levels in rat 
due to body weight differences, spanning between pre-mating day 21 and gestational day 20). 
SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody responses were present in maternal animals from prior to mating 
to the end of the study on postnatal day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no 
vaccine-related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo-foetal or offspring development. No 
Comirnaty data are available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (5/5 micrograms)/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is 
indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, in children aged 
5 to 11 years.  
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 is administered intramuscularly after dilution as a single dose of 
0.2 mL for children 5 to 11 years of age regardless of prior COVID-19 vaccination status (see sections 
4.4 and 5.1). 
For individuals who have previously been vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 should be administered at least 3 months after the most recent dose of a 
COVID-19 vaccine.  
119 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Severely immunocompromised aged 5 years and older 
Additional doses may be administered to individuals who are severely immunocompromised in 
accordance with national recommendations (see section 4.4). 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (5/5 micrograms)/dose should be used only for children 5 to 
11 years of age. 
Paediatric population 
There are paediatric formulations available for infants and children aged 6 months to 4 years. For 
details, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for other formulations. 
The safety and efficacy of the vaccine in infants aged less than 6 months have not yet been 
established. 
Method of administration 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (5/5 micrograms)/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection 
should be administered intramuscularly after dilution (see section 6.6).  
After dilution, vials of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 contain 10 doses of 0.2 mL of vaccine. In 
order to extract 10 doses from a single vial, low dead-volume syringes and/or needles should be used. 
The low dead-volume syringe and needle combination should have a dead volume of no more than 
35 microlitres. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract 
10 doses from a single vial. Irrespective of the type of syringe and needle: 
• 
• 
Each dose must contain 0.2 mL of vaccine. 
If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.2 mL, discard the 
vial and any excess volume.  
Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials. 
• 
The preferred site is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. 
Do not inject the vaccine intravascularly, subcutaneously or intradermally.  
The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products. 
For precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4. 
For instructions regarding thawing, handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability  
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
General recommendations 
Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis 
Events of anaphylaxis have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should 
always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the 
vaccine.  
120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. No further dose of 
the vaccine should be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis after a prior dose of 
Comirnaty. 
Myocarditis and pericarditis 
There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Comirnaty. These 
conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 
14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger 
males (see section 4.8). Available data indicate that most cases recover. Some cases required intensive 
care support and fatal cases have been observed. 
Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. 
Vaccinees (including parents or caregivers) should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention 
if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest 
pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination. 
Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this 
condition. 
Anxiety-related reactions 
Anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress‐related 
reactions (e.g. dizziness, palpitations, increases in heart rate, alterations in blood pressure, 
paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia and sweating) may occur in association with the vaccination process itself. 
Stress-related reactions are temporary and resolve on their own. Individuals should be advised to bring 
symptoms to the attention of the vaccination provider for evaluation. It is important that precautions 
are in place to avoid injury from fainting. 
Concurrent illness 
Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute 
infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination. 
Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders 
As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals 
receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as 
haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in 
these individuals. 
Immunocompromised individuals 
The efficacy and safety of the vaccine has not been assessed in individuals with weakened immune 
systems, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 may be lower in individuals with weakened immune systems. 
Duration of protection 
The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by 
ongoing clinical trials. 
Limitations of vaccine effectiveness 
As with any vaccine, vaccination with Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 may not protect all 
vaccine recipients. Individuals may not be fully protected until 7 days after their vaccination. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
Concomitant administration of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 with other vaccines has not been 
studied.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 during pregnancy.  
However, a large amount of observational data from pregnant women vaccinated with the initially 
approved Comirnaty vaccine during the second and third trimester have not shown an increase in 
adverse pregnancy outcomes. While data on pregnancy outcomes following vaccination during the 
first trimester are presently limited, no increased risk for miscarriage has been seen. Animal studies do 
not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, 
parturition or post-natal development (see section 5.3). Based on data available with other vaccine 
variants, Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 can be used during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 during 
breast-feeding.  
However, no effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of 
breast-feeding woman to the vaccine is negligible. Observational data from women who were 
breast-feeding after vaccination with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine have not shown a risk 
for adverse effects in breastfed newborns/infants. Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 can be used 
during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use 
machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the 
ability to drive or use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile 
The safety of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 is inferred from safety data from Comirnaty and 
Omicron adapted vaccines. 
Comirnaty  
Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – after 2 doses 
In Study 3, a total of 3 109 children 5 to 11 years of age received at least 1 dose of the initially 
approved Comirnaty vaccine 10 mcg and a total of 1 538 children 5 to 11 years of age received 
placebo. At the time of the analysis of Study 3 Phase 2/3 with data up to the cut-off date of 20 May 
2022, 2 206 (1 481 Comirnaty 10 mcg and 725 placebo) children have been followed for ≥ 4 months 
after the second dose in the placebo-controlled blinded follow-up period. The safety evaluation in 
Study 3 is ongoing. 
The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in participants 5 to 11 years of age was similar to that seen in 
participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in children 5 to 11 years of 
age that received 2 doses were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 50%), headache (> 30%), 
injection site redness and swelling (≥ 20%), myalgia, chills, and diarrhoea (> 10%).

Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – after booster dose  
In a subset from Study 3, a total of 401 children 5 to 11 years of age received a booster dose of 
Comirnaty 10 mcg at least 5 months (range of 5 to 9 months) after completing the primary series. The 
analysis of the Study 3 Phase 2/3 subset is based on data up to the cut-off date of 22 March 2022 
(median follow-up time of 1.3 months). 
The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after the primary course. The 
most frequent adverse reactions in children 5 to 11 years of age were injection site pain (> 70%), 
fatigue (> 40%), headache (> 30%), myalgia, chills, injection site redness and swelling (> 10%). 
Adolescents 12 to 15 years of age – after 2 doses 
In an analysis of long-term safety follow-up in Study 2, 2 260 adolescents (1 131 Comirnaty and 
1 129 placebo) were 12 to 15 years of age. Of these, 1 559 adolescents (786 Comirnaty and 
773 placebo) have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the second dose. 
The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age was similar to that seen in 
participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in adolescents 12 to 
15 years of age that received 2 doses were injection site pain (> 90%), fatigue and headache (> 70%), 
myalgia and chills (> 40%), arthralgia and pyrexia (> 20%). 
Participants 16 years of age and older – after 2 doses 
In Study 2, a total of 22 026 participants 16 years of age or older received at least 1 dose of Comirnaty 
30 mcg and a total of 22 021 participants 16 years of age or older received placebo (including 138 and 
145 adolescents 16 and 17 years of age in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively). A total of 
20 519 participants 16 years of age or older received 2 doses of Comirnaty.  
At the time of the analysis of Study 2 with a data cut-off of 13 March 2021 for the placebo-controlled 
blinded follow-up period up to the participants’ unblinding dates, a total of 25 651 (58.2%) 
participants (13 031 Comirnaty and 12 620 placebo) 16 years of age and older were followed up for 
≥ 4 months after the second dose. This included a total of 15 111 (7 704 Comirnaty and 7 407 placebo) 
participants 16 to 55 years of age and a total of 10 540 (5 327 Comirnaty and 5 213 placebo) 
participants 56 years of age and older. 
The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 16 years of age and older that received 2 doses 
were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 50%), myalgia (> 40%), chills 
(> 30%), arthralgia (> 20%), pyrexia and injection site swelling (> 10%) and were usually mild or 
moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of 
reactogenicity events was associated with greater age. 
The safety profile in 545 participants 16 years of age and older receiving Comirnaty, that were 
seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, was similar to that seen in the general population. 
Participants 12 years of age and older – after booster dose 
A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 306 adults 18 to 55 years of age who completed the 
original Comirnaty 2-dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 6 months 
(range of 4.8 to 8.0 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, 
had a median follow-up time of 8.3 months (range 1.1 to 8.5 months) and 301 participants had been 
followed for ≥ 6 months after the booster dose to the cut-off date (22 November 2021). 
The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after 2 doses. The most frequent 
adverse reactions in participants 18 to 55 years of age were injection site pain (> 80%), 
fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 40%), myalgia (> 30%), chills and arthralgia (> 20%).  
In Study 4, a placebo-controlled booster study, participants 16 years of age and older recruited from 
Study 2 received a booster dose of Comirnaty (5 081 participants), or placebo (5 044 participants) at 
least 6 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, 
had a median follow-up time of 2.8 months (range 0.3 to 7.5 months) after the booster dose in the 
123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
blinded placebo-controlled follow-up period to the cut-off date (8 February 2022). Of these, 
1 281 participants (895 Comirnaty and 386 placebo) have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the 
booster dose of Comirnaty. No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified. 
A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 825 adolescents 12 to 15 years of age who completed 
the original Comirnaty 2-dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 
11.2 months (range of 6.3 to 20.1 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a 
booster dose, had a median follow-up time of 9.5 months (range 1.5 to 10.7 months) based on data up 
to the cut-off date (3 November 2022). No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified. 
Booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine  
In 5 independent studies on the use of a Comirnaty booster dose in individuals who had completed 
primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose), no new 
safety issues were identified. 
Omicron-adapted Comirnaty 
Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – after the booster (fourth dose)  
In a subset from Study 6 (Phase 3), 113 participants 5 to 11 years of age who had completed 3 doses of 
Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (5/5 mcg) 2.6 to 
8.5 months after receiving Dose 3. Participants who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 had a median follow-up time of at least 1.6 months. 
The overall safety profile for the Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 booster (fourth dose) was 
similar to that seen after 3 doses. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 5 to 11 years of 
age were injection site pain (> 60%), fatigue (> 40%), headache (> 20%), and muscle pain (> 10%). 
Participants 12 years of age and older – after a booster dose of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 
(fourth dose) 
In a subset from Study 5 (Phase 2/3), 107 participants 12 to 17 years of age, 313 participants 18 to 
55 years of age and 306 participants 56 years of age and older who had completed 3 doses of 
Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (15/15 mcg) 5.4 
to 16.9 months after receiving Dose 3. Participants who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 had a median follow-up time of at least 1.5 months. 
The overall safety profile for the Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 booster (fourth dose) was 
similar to that seen after 3 doses. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 12 years of age 
and older were injection site pain (> 60%), fatigue (> 50%), headache (> 40%), muscle pain (> 20%), 
chills (> 10%), and joint pain (> 10%).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Myocarditis and pericarditis 
The increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty is highest in younger males (see 
section 4.4). 
Two large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have estimated the excess risk in younger 
males following the second dose of Comirnaty. One study showed that in a period of 7 days after the 
second dose there were about 0.265 (95% CI 0.255 - 0.275) extra cases of myocarditis in 12-29 year 
old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. In another study, in a period of 28 days after the 
second dose there were 0.56 (95% CI 0.37 - 0.74) extra cases of myocarditis in 16-24 year old males 
per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. 
125 
 
 
 
Limited data indicate that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty in 
children aged 5 to 11 years seems lower than in ages 12 to 17 years. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V and include batch/Lot number if available. 
4.9  Overdose 
Overdose data is available from 52 study participants included in the clinical trial that due to an error 
in dilution received 58 micrograms of Comirnaty. The vaccine recipients did not report an increase in 
reactogenicity or adverse reactions.  
In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is 
recommended.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BN01 
Mechanism of action 
The nucleoside-modified messenger RNA in Comirnaty is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which 
enable delivery of the non-replicating RNA into host cells to direct transient expression of the 
SARS-CoV-2 S antigen. The mRNA codes for membrane-anchored, full-length S with two point 
mutations within the central helix. Mutation of these two amino acids to proline locks S in an 
antigenically preferred prefusion conformation. The vaccine elicits both neutralizing antibody and 
cellular immune responses to the spike (S) antigen, which may contribute to protection against 
COVID-19. 
Efficacy 
Omicron-adapted Comirnaty 
Immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – after the booster 
(fourth dose) 
In an analysis of a subset from Study 6, 103 participants 5 to 11 years of age who had previously 
received a 2-dose primary series and booster dose with Comirnaty received a booster (fourth dose) of 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5. Results include immunogenicity data from a comparator subset 
of participants 5 to 11 years of age in Study 3 who received 3 doses of Comirnaty. In participants 5 to 
11 years of age who received a fourth dose of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 and participants 
5 to 11 years of age who received a third dose of Comirnaty, 57.3% and 58.4% were positive for 
SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, respectively. 
The immune response 1 month after a booster dose (fourth dose), Comirnaty Original/Omicron 
BA.4-5 elicited generally similar Omicron BA.4/BA.5-specific neutralizing titres compared with the 
titres in the comparator group who received 3 doses of Comirnaty. Comirnaty Original/Omicron 
BA.4-5 also elicited similar reference strain-specific titres compared with the titres in the comparator 
group.

Immunogenicity in participants 12 years of age and older – after the booster (fourth dose) 
In an analysis of a subset from Study 5, 105 participants 12 to 17 years of age, 297 participants 18 
through 55 years of age, and 286 participants 56 years of age and older who had previously received a 
2-dose primary series and booster dose with Comirnaty received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5. In participants 12 through 17 years of age, 18 through 55 years of age, and 
56 years of age and older, 75.2%, 71.7% and 61.5% were positive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, 
respectively. 
Analyses of 50% neutralizing antibody titres (NT50) against Omicron BA.4-5 and against reference 
strain among participants 56 years of age and older who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 in Study 5 compared to a subset of participants from Study 4 who received 
a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty demonstrated superiority of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 
to Comirnaty based on geometric mean ratio (GMR) and noninferiority based on difference in 
seroresponse rates with respect to anti-Omicron BA.4-5 response, and noninferiority of anti-reference 
strain immune response based on GMR (Table 3).

Comirnaty  
Study 2 is a multicentre, multinational, Phase 1/2/3 randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind 
dose-finding, vaccine candidate selection and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. 
Randomisation was stratified by age: 12 to 15 years of age, 16 to 55 years of age, or 56 years of age 
and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the ≥ 56-year stratum. The study excluded 
participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological 
diagnosis of COVID-19. Participants with pre-existing stable disease, defined as disease not requiring 
significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before 
enrolment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV).  
129 
 
 
 
 
Efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older – after 2 doses 
In the Phase 2/3 portion of Study 2, based on data accrued through 14 November 2020, approximately 
44 000 participants were randomised equally and were to receive 2 doses of the initially approved 
COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine or placebo. The efficacy analyses included participants that received their 
second vaccination within 19 to 42 days after their first vaccination. The majority (93.1%) of vaccine 
recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Participants are planned to be 
followed for up to 24 months after Dose 2, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID-19. 
In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 14 days before and 
after administration of an influenza vaccine in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA 
Vaccine. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 60 days 
before or after receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins within through conclusion of the 
study in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine. 
The population for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included 36 621 participants 12 years 
of age and older (18 242 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 18 379 in the placebo group) 
who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 through 7 days after the second dose. 
In addition, 134 participants were between the ages of 16 to 17 years of age (66 in the COVID-19 
mRNA Vaccine group and 68 in the placebo group) and 1 616 participants 75 years of age and older 
(804 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 812 in the placebo group). 
At the time of the primary efficacy analysis, participants had been followed for symptomatic 
COVID-19 for in total 2 214 person-years for the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and in total 
2 222 person-years in the placebo group.  
There were no meaningful clinical differences in overall vaccine efficacy in participants who were at 
risk of severe COVID-19 including those with 1 or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe 
COVID-19 (e.g. asthma, body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes 
mellitus, hypertension). 
The vaccine efficacy information is presented in Table 5.

Efficacy of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing first COVID-19 occurrence from 7 days after 
Dose 2 compared to placebo was 94.6% (95% confidence interval of 89.6% to 97.6%) in participants 
16 years of age and older with or without evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2.  
Additionally, subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint showed similar efficacy point 
estimates across genders, ethnic groups, and participants with medical comorbidities associated with 
high risk of severe COVID-19.  
Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additional confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued during 
blinded placebo-controlled follow-up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy 
population.

Efficacy and immunogenicity in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age – after 2 doses 
In an initial analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (representing a median follow-up 
duration of > 2 months after Dose 2) without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 
1 005 participants who received the vaccine and 16 cases out of 978 who received placebo. The point 
estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 75.3, 100.0). In participants with or without 
evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 18 cases in 
1 110 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% 
(95% confidence interval 78.1, 100.0).  
Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additional confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued during 
blinded placebo-controlled follow-up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy 
population.  
In the updated efficacy analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age without evidence of 
prior infection, there were no cases in 1 057 participants who received the vaccine and 28 cases out of 
1 030 who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 86.8, 
100.0) during the period when Alpha variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants 
with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 
30 cases  in 1 109 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy 
is 100% (95% confidence interval 87.5, 100.0). 
In Study 2, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising titres 1 month after Dose 2 was conducted in a 
randomly selected subset of participants who had no serological or virological evidence of past 
SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, comparing the response in adolescents 12 to 
15 years of age (n = 190) to participants 16 to 25 years of age (n = 170).  
The ratio of the geometric mean titres (GMT) in the 12 to 15 years of age group to the 16 to 25 years 
of age group was 1.76, with a 2-sided 95% CI of 1.47 to 2.10. Therefore, the 1.5-fold noninferiority 
criterion was met as the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio [GMR] was 
> 0.67. 
Efficacy and immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – 
after 2 doses 
Study 3 is a Phase 1/2/3 study comprised of an open-label vaccine dose-finding portion (Phase 1) and 
a multicentre, multinational, randomised, saline placebo-controlled, observer-blind efficacy portion 
(Phase 2/3) that has enrolled participants 5 to 11 years of age. The majority (94.4%) of randomised 
vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. 
Initial descriptive vaccine efficacy results in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior 
SARS-CoV-2 infection are presented in Table 8. No cases of COVID-19 were observed in either the 
vaccine group or the placebo group in participants with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Pre-specified hypothesis-driven efficacy analysis was performed with additional confirmed 
COVID-19 cases accrued during blinded placebo-controlled follow-up, representing up to 6 months 
after Dose 2 in the efficacy population.  
In the efficacy analysis of Study 3 in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior infection, 
there were 10 cases in 2 703 participants who received the vaccine and 42 cases out of 1 348 who 
received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 88.2% (95% confidence interval 76.2, 94.7) during 
the period when Delta variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants with or without 
evidence of prior infection there were 12 cases in the 3 018 who received vaccine and 42 cases in 
1 511 participants who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 85.7% (95% confidence 
interval 72.4, 93.2). 
In Study 3, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralising titres (NT50) 1 month after Dose 2 in a 
randomly selected subset of participants demonstrated effectiveness by immunobridging of immune 
responses comparing children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) in the Phase 2/3 
part of Study 3 to participants 16 to 25 years of age in the Phase 2/3 part of Study 2 who had no 
serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, meeting 
the prespecified immunobridging criteria for both the geometric mean ratio (GMR) and the 
seroresponse difference with seroresponse defined as achieving at least 4-fold rise in SARS-CoV-2 
NT50 from baseline (before Dose 1).  
The GMR of the SARS-CoV-2 NT50 1 month after Dose 2 in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to 
less than 12 years of age) to that of young adults 16 to 25 years of age was 1.04 (2-sided 95% CI: 0.93, 
1.18). Among participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after 
Dose 2, 99.2% of children 5 to 11 years of age and 99.2% of participants 16 to 25 years of age had a 
seroresponse at 1 month after Dose 2. The difference in proportions of participants who had 
seroresponse between the 2 age groups (children – young adult) was 0.0% (2-sided 95% CI: -2.0%, 
2.2%). This information is presented in Table 9.

Immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – after booster 
dose  
A booster dose of Comirnaty was given to 401 randomly selected participants in Study 3. 
Effectiveness of a booster dose in ages 5 to 11 is inferred by immunogenicity. The immunogenicity of 
this was assessed through NT50 against the reference strain of SARS-CoV-2 (USA_WA1/2020). 
Analyses of NT50 1 month after the booster dose compared to before the booster dose demonstrated a 
substantial increase in GMTs in individuals 5 through 11 years of age who had no serological or 
virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after the dose 2 and the booster 
dose. This analysis is summarized in Table 10.

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Comirnaty in the paediatric population in prevention of COVID-19 (see section 4.2 for information on 
paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Not applicable. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose 
toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity. 
General toxicity 
Rats intramuscularly administered Comirnaty (receiving 3 full human doses once weekly, generating 
relatively higher levels in rats due to body weight differences) demonstrated some injection site 
oedema and erythema and increases in white blood cells (including basophils and eosinophils) 
136 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
consistent with an inflammatory response as well as vacuolation of portal hepatocytes without 
evidence of liver injury. All effects were reversible. 
Genotoxicity/Carcinogenicity 
Neither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies were performed. The components of the vaccine (lipids 
and mRNA) are not expected to have genotoxic potential.  
Reproductive toxicity 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity were investigated in rats in a combined fertility and 
developmental toxicity study where female rats were intramuscularly administered Comirnaty prior to 
mating and during gestation (receiving 4 full human doses that generate relatively higher levels in rat 
due to body weight differences, spanning between pre-mating day 21 and gestational day 20). 
SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody responses were present in maternal animals from prior to mating 
to the end of the study on postnatal day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no 
vaccine-related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo-foetal or offspring development. No 
Comirnaty data are available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability  
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
General recommendations 
Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis 
Events of anaphylaxis have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should 
always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the 
vaccine.  
Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. No further dose of 
the vaccine should be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis after a prior dose of 
Comirnaty. 
Myocarditis and pericarditis 
There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Comirnaty. These 
conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 
14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger 
males (see section 4.8). Available data indicate that most cases recover. Some cases required intensive 
care support and fatal cases have been observed.  
Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. 
Vaccinees (including parents or caregivers) should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention 
if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest 
pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination. 
Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this 
condition. 
Anxiety-related reactions 
Anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress‐related 
reactions (e.g. dizziness, palpitations, increases in heart rate, alterations in blood pressure, 
paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia and sweating) may occur in association with the vaccination process itself. 
Stress-related reactions are temporary and resolve on their own. Individuals should be advised to bring 
symptoms to the attention of the vaccination provider for evaluation. It is important that precautions 
are in place to avoid injury from fainting. 
Concurrent illness 
Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute 
infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination. 
Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders 
As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals 
receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as 
haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in 
these individuals. 
Immunocompromised individuals 
The efficacy and safety of the vaccine has not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, 
including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of Comirnaty Original/Omicron 
BA.4-5 may be lower in immunocompromised individuals. 
143 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Duration of protection 
The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by 
ongoing clinical trials. 
Limitations of vaccine effectiveness 
As with any vaccine, vaccination with Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 may not protect all 
vaccine recipients. Individuals may not be fully protected until 7 days after their vaccination. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
Concomitant administration of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 with other vaccines has not been 
studied. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 during pregnancy.  
However, a large amount of observational data from pregnant women vaccinated with the initially 
approved Comirnaty vaccine during the second and third trimester have not shown an increase in 
adverse pregnancy outcomes. While data on pregnancy outcomes following vaccination during the 
first trimester are presently limited, no increased risk for miscarriage has been seen. Animal studies do 
not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, 
parturition or post-natal development (see section 5.3). Based on data available with other vaccine 
variants, Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 can be used during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 during 
breast-feeding.  
However, no effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of 
breast-feeding woman to the vaccine is negligible. Observational data from women who were 
breast-feeding after vaccination with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine have not shown a risk 
for adverse effects in breastfed newborns/infants. Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 can be used 
during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use 
machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the 
ability to drive or use machines.

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile 
The safety of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 is inferred from safety data from Comirnaty and 
Omicron adapted vaccines. 
Comirnaty 
Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – after 2 doses   
In Study 3, a total of 3 109 children 5 to 11 years of age received at least 1 dose of the initially 
approved Comirnaty vaccine 10 mcg and a total of 1 538 children 5 to 11 years of age received 
placebo. At the time of the analysis of Study 3 Phase 2/3 with data up to the cut-off date of 20 May 
2022, 2 206 (1 481 Comirnaty 10 mcg and 725 placebo) children have been followed for ≥ 4 months 
after the second dose in the placebo-controlled blinded follow-up period. The safety evaluation in 
Study 3 is ongoing. 
The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in participants 5 to 11 years of age was similar to that seen in 
participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in children 5 to 11 years of 
age that received 2 doses were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 50%), headache (> 30%), 
injection site redness and swelling (≥ 20%), myalgia, chills, and diarrhoea (> 10%). 
Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – after booster dose  
In a subset from Study 3, a total of 401 children 5 to 11 years of age received a booster dose of 
Comirnaty 10 mcg at least 5 months (range of 5 to 9 months) after completing the primary series. The 
analysis of the Study 3 Phase 2/3 subset is based on data up to the cut-off date of 22 March 2022 
(median follow-up time of 1.3 months). 
The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after the primary course. The 
most frequent adverse reactions in children 5 to 11 years of age were injection site pain (> 70%), 
fatigue (> 40%), headache (> 30%), myalgia, chills, injection site redness and swelling (> 10%). 
Adolescents 12 to 15 years of age – after 2 doses 
In an analysis of long-term safety follow-up in Study 2, 2 260 adolescents (1 131 Comirnaty and 
1 129 placebo) were 12 to 15 years of age. Of these, 1 559 adolescents (786 Comirnaty and 
773 placebo) have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the second dose.  
The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age was similar to that seen in 
participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in adolescents 12 to 
15 years of age that received 2 doses were injection site pain (> 90%), fatigue and headache (> 70%), 
myalgia and chills (> 40%), arthralgia and pyrexia (> 20%). 
Participants 16 years of age and older – after 2 doses 
In Study 2, a total of 22 026 participants 16 years of age or older received at least 1 dose of Comirnaty 
30 mcg and a total of 22 021 participants 16 years of age or older received placebo (including 138 and 
145 adolescents 16 and 17 years of age in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively). A total of 
20 519 participants 16 years of age or older received 2 doses of Comirnaty.  
At the time of the analysis of Study 2 with a data cut-off of 13 March 2021 for the placebo-controlled 
blinded follow-up period up to the participants’ unblinding dates, a total of 25 651 (58.2%) 
participants (13 031 Comirnaty and 12 620 placebo) 16 years of age and older were followed up for 
≥ 4 months after the second dose. This included a total of 15 111 (7 704 Comirnaty and 7 407 placebo) 
participants 16 to 55 years of age and a total of 10 540 (5 327 Comirnaty and 5 213 placebo) 
participants 56 years of age and older. 
The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 16 years of age and older that received 2 doses 
were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 50%), myalgia (> 40%), chills 
(> 30%), arthralgia (> 20%), pyrexia and injection site swelling (> 10%) and were usually mild or 
145 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of 
reactogenicity events was associated with greater age. 
The safety profile in 545 participants 16 years of age and older receiving Comirnaty, that were 
seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, was similar to that seen in the general population. 
Participants 12 years of age and older – after booster dose 
A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 306 adults 18 to 55 years of age who completed the 
original Comirnaty 2-dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 6 months 
(range of 4.8 to 8.0 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, 
had a median follow-up time of 8.3 months (range 1.1 to 8.5 months) and 301 participants had been 
followed for ≥ 6 months after the booster dose to the cut-off date (22 November 2021). 
The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after 2 doses. The most frequent 
adverse reactions in participants 18 to 55 years of age were injection site pain (> 80%), 
fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 40%), myalgia (> 30%), chills and arthralgia (> 20%).  
In Study 4, a placebo-controlled booster study, participants 16 years of age and older recruited from 
Study 2 received a booster dose of Comirnaty (5 081 participants), or placebo (5 044 participants) at 
least 6 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, 
had a median follow-up time of 2.8 months (range 0.3 to 7.5 months) after the booster dose in the 
blinded placebo-controlled follow-up period to the cut-off date (8 February 2022). Of these, 
1 281 participants (895 Comirnaty and 386 placebo) have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the 
booster dose of Comirnaty. No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified. 
A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 825 adolescents 12 to 15 years of age who completed 
the original Comirnaty 2-dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 
11.2 months (range of 6.3 to 20.1 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a 
booster dose, had a median follow-up time of 9.5 months (range 1.5 to 10.7 months) based on data up 
to the cut-off date (3 November 2022). No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified. 
Booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine  
In 5 independent studies on the use of a Comirnaty booster dose in individuals who had completed 
primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose), no new 
safety issues were identified. 
Omicron-adapted Comirnaty 
Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – after the booster (fourth dose)  
In a subset from Study 6 (Phase 3), 113 participants 5 to 11 years of age who had completed 3 doses of

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Myocarditis and pericarditis 
The increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty is highest in younger males (see 
section 4.4). 
Two large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have estimated the excess risk in younger 
males following the second dose of Comirnaty. One study showed that in a period of 7 days after the 
second dose there were about 0.265 (95% CI 0.255 - 0.275) extra cases of myocarditis in 12-29 year 
old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. In another study, in a period of 28 days after the 
second dose there were 0.56 (95% CI 0.37 - 0.74) extra cases of myocarditis in 16-24 year old males 
per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. 
Limited data indicate that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty in 
children aged 5 to 11 years seems lower than in ages 12 to 17 years. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V and include batch/Lot number if available. 
4.9  Overdose 
Overdose data is available from 52 study participants included in the clinical trial that due to an error 
in dilution received 58 micrograms of Comirnaty. The vaccine recipients did not report an increase in 
reactogenicity or adverse reactions.  
In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is 
recommended.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BN01 
Mechanism of action 
The nucleoside-modified messenger RNA in Comirnaty is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which 
enable delivery of the non-replicating RNA into host cells to direct transient expression of the 
SARS-CoV-2 S antigen. The mRNA codes for membrane-anchored, full-length S with two point 
mutations within the central helix. Mutation of these two amino acids to proline locks S in an 
antigenically preferred prefusion conformation. The vaccine elicits both neutralizing antibody and 
cellular immune responses to the spike (S) antigen, which may contribute to protection against 
COVID-19. 
Efficacy 
Omicron-adapted Comirnaty 
Immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – after the booster 
(fourth dose) 
In an analysis of a subset from Study 6, 103 participants 5 to 11 years of age who had previously 
received a 2-dose primary series and booster dose with Comirnaty received a booster (fourth dose) of 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5. Results include immunogenicity data from a comparator subset 
148 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of participants 5 to 11 years of age in Study 3 who received 3 doses of Comirnaty. In participants 5 to 
11 years of age who received a fourth dose of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 and participants 
5 to 11 years of age who received a third dose of Comirnaty, 57.3% and 58.4% were positive for 
SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, respectively. 
The immune response 1 month after a booster dose (fourth dose), Comirnaty Original/Omicron 
BA.4-5 elicited generally similar Omicron BA.4/BA.5-specific neutralizing titres compared with the 
titres in the comparator group who received 3 doses of Comirnaty. Comirnaty Original/Omicron 
BA.4-5 also elicited similar reference strain-specific titres compared with the titres in the comparator 
group.  
The vaccine immunogenicity results after a booster dose in participants 5 to 11 years of age are 
presented in Table 2.

Original/Omicron BA.4-5 in Study 5 compared to a subset of participants from Study 4 who received 
a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty demonstrated superiority of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 
to Comirnaty based on geometric mean ratio (GMR) and noninferiority based on difference in 
seroresponse rates with respect to anti-Omicron BA.4-5 response, and noninferiority of anti-reference 
strain immune response based on GMR (Table 3).

compared to participants 56 years of age and older who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 in Study 5 demonstrated noninferiority of anti-Omicron BA.4-5 response 
among participants 18 through 55 years of age compared to participants 56 years of age and older for 
both GMR and difference in seroresponse rates (Table 3). 
The study also assessed the level of NT50 of the anti-Omicron BA.4-5 SARS-CoV-2 and reference

Comirnaty 
Study 2 is a multicentre, multinational, Phase 1/2/3 randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind 
dose-finding, vaccine candidate selection and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. 
Randomisation was stratified by age: 12 to 15 years of age, 16 to 55 years of age, or 56 years of age 
and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the ≥ 56-year stratum. The study excluded 
participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological 
diagnosis of COVID-19. Participants with pre-existing stable disease, defined as disease not requiring 
significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before 
enrolment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV).  
Efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older – after 2 doses 
In the Phase 2/3 portion of Study 2, based on data accrued through 14 November 2020, approximately 
44 000 participants were randomised equally and were to receive 2 doses of the initially approved 
COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine or placebo. The efficacy analyses included participants that received their 
second vaccination within 19 to 42 days after their first vaccination. The majority (93.1%) of vaccine 
recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Participants are planned to be 
followed for up to 24 months after Dose 2, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID-19. 
In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 14 days before and 
after administration of an influenza vaccine in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA 
Vaccine. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 60 days 
before or after receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins within through conclusion of the 
study in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine. 
The population for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included 36 621 participants 12 years 
of age and older (18 242 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 18 379 in the placebo group) 
who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 through 7 days after the second dose. 
In addition, 134 participants were between the ages of 16 to 17 years of age (66 in the COVID-19 
mRNA Vaccine group and 68 in the placebo group) and 1 616 participants 75 years of age and older 
(804 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 812 in the placebo group). 
At the time of the primary efficacy analysis, participants had been followed for symptomatic 
COVID-19 for in total 2 214 person-years for the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and in total 
2 222 person-years in the placebo group.  
There were no meaningful clinical differences in overall vaccine efficacy in participants who were at 
risk of severe COVID-19 including those with 1 or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe 
COVID-19 (e.g. asthma, body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes 
mellitus, hypertension). 
The vaccine efficacy information is presented in Table 5.

Efficacy of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing first COVID-19 occurrence from 7 days after 
Dose 2 compared to placebo was 94.6% (95% confidence interval of 89.6% to 97.6%) in participants 
16 years of age and older with or without evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2.  
Additionally, subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint showed similar efficacy point 
estimates across genders, ethnic groups, and participants with medical comorbidities associated with 
high risk of severe COVID-19.  
Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additional confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued during 
blinded placebo-controlled follow-up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy 
population.

Efficacy and immunogenicity in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age – after 2 doses   
In an initial analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (representing a median follow-up 
duration of > 2 months after Dose 2) without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 
1 005 participants who received the vaccine and 16 cases out of 978 who received placebo. The point 
estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 75.3, 100.0). In participants with or without 
evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 18 cases in 
1 110 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% 
(95% confidence interval 78.1, 100.0).  
Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additional confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued during 
blinded placebo-controlled follow-up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy 
population.  
155 
 
 
 
 
In the updated efficacy analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age without evidence of 
prior infection, there were no cases in 1 057 participants who received the vaccine and 28 cases out of 
1 030 who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 86.8, 
100.0) during the period when Alpha variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants 
with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 
30 cases  in 1 109 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy 
is 100% (95% confidence interval 87.5, 100.0). 
In Study 2, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising titres 1 month after Dose 2 was conducted in a 
randomly selected subset of participants who had no serological or virological evidence of past 
SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, comparing the response in adolescents 12 to 
15 years of age (n = 190) to participants 16 to 25 years of age (n = 170).  
The ratio of the geometric mean titres (GMT) in the 12 to 15 years of age group to the 16 to 25 years 
of age group was 1.76, with a 2-sided 95% CI of 1.47 to 2.10. Therefore, the 1.5-fold noninferiority 
criterion was met as the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio [GMR] was 
> 0.67. 
Efficacy and immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – 
after 2 doses 
Study 3 is a Phase 1/2/3 study comprised of an open-label vaccine dose-finding portion (Phase 1) and 
a multicentre, multinational, randomised, saline placebo-controlled, observer-blind efficacy portion 
(Phase 2/3) that has enrolled participants 5 to 11 years of age. The majority (94.4%) of randomised 
vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. 
Initial descriptive vaccine efficacy results in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior 
SARS-CoV-2 infection are presented in Table 8. No cases of COVID-19 were observed in either the 
vaccine group or the placebo group in participants with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Pre-specified hypothesis-driven efficacy analysis was performed with additional confirmed 
COVID-19 cases accrued during blinded placebo-controlled follow-up, representing up to 6 months 
after Dose 2 in the efficacy population.  
In the efficacy analysis of Study 3 in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior infection, 
there were 10 cases in 2 703 participants who received the vaccine and 42 cases out of 1 348 who 
received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 88.2% (95% confidence interval 76.2, 94.7) during 
the period when Delta variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants with or without 
evidence of prior infection there were 12 cases in the 3 018 who received vaccine and 42 cases in 
1 511 participants who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 85.7% (95% confidence 
interval 72.4, 93.2). 
In Study 3, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralising titres (NT50) 1 month after Dose 2 in a 
randomly selected subset of participants demonstrated effectiveness by immunobridging of immune 
responses comparing children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) in the Phase 2/3 
part of Study 3 to participants 16 to 25 years of age in the Phase 2/3 part of Study 2 who had no 
serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, meeting 
the prespecified immunobridging criteria for both the geometric mean ratio (GMR) and the 
seroresponse difference with seroresponse defined as achieving at least 4-fold rise in SARS-CoV-2 
NT50 from baseline (before Dose 1).  
The GMR of the SARS-CoV-2 NT50 1 month after Dose 2 in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to 
less than 12 years of age) to that of young adults 16 to 25 years of age was 1.04 (2-sided 95% CI: 0.93, 
1.18). Among participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after 
Dose 2, 99.2% of children 5 to 11 years of age and 99.2% of participants 16 to 25 years of age had a 
seroresponse at 1 month after Dose 2. The difference in proportions of participants who had 
seroresponse between the 2 age groups (children – young adult) was 0.0% (2-sided 95% CI: -2.0%, 
2.2%). This information is presented in Table 9.

Immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – after booster 
dose  
A booster dose of Comirnaty was given to 401 randomly selected participants in Study 3. 
Effectiveness of a booster dose in ages 5 to 11 is inferred by immunogenicity. The immunogenicity of 
this was assessed through NT50 against the reference strain of SARS-CoV-2 (USA_WA1/2020). 
Analyses of NT50 1 month after the booster dose compared to before the booster dose demonstrated a 
substantial increase in GMTs in individuals 5 through 11 years of age who had no serological or 
virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after the dose 2 and the booster 
dose. This analysis is summarized in Table 10.

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Comirnaty in the paediatric population in prevention of COVID-19 (see section 4.2 for information on 
paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Not applicable. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose 
toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity. 
General toxicity 
Rats intramuscularly administered Comirnaty (receiving 3 full human doses once weekly, generating 
relatively higher levels in rats due to body weight differences) demonstrated some injection site 
oedema and erythema and increases in white blood cells (including basophils and eosinophils) 
consistent with an inflammatory response as well as vacuolation of portal hepatocytes without 
evidence of liver injury. All effects were reversible. 
Genotoxicity/Carcinogenicity 
Neither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies were performed. The components of the vaccine (lipids 
and mRNA) are not expected to have genotoxic potential.  
Reproductive toxicity 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity were investigated in rats in a combined fertility and 
developmental toxicity study where female rats were intramuscularly administered Comirnaty prior to 
mating and during gestation (receiving 4 full human doses that generate relatively higher levels in rat 
due to body weight differences, spanning between pre-mating day 21 and gestational day 20). 
SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody responses were present in maternal animals from prior to mating 
to the end of the study on postnatal day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no 
vaccine-related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo-foetal or offspring development. No 
Comirnaty data are available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk.

4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Infants and children 6 months to 4 years of age without history of completion of a COVID-19 primary 
course or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (1.5/1.5 micrograms)/dose is administered intramuscularly after 
dilution as a primary course of 3 doses (0.2 mL each). It is recommended to administer the second 
dose 3 weeks after the first dose followed by a third dose administered at least 8 weeks after the 
second dose (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
164 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If a child turns 5 years old between their doses in the primary course, he/she should complete the 
primary course at the same 3 micrograms or 1.5/1.5 micrograms dose level. 
Infants and children 6 months to 4 years of age with history of completion of a COVID-19 primary 
course or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (1.5/1.5 micrograms/dose) is administered intramuscularly after 
dilution as a single dose of 0.2 mL for infants and children 6 months to 4 years of age.  
For individuals who have previously been vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 should be administered at least 3 months after the most recent dose of a 
COVID-19 vaccine.  
Severely immunocompromised aged 6 months to 4 years 
Additional doses may be administered to individuals who are severely immunocompromised in 
accordance with national recommendations (see section 4.4). 
Interchangeability  
The primary course may consist of either Comirnaty, Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5, or 
Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 (or a combination) but not exceeding the total number of doses required 
as primary course. The primary course should only be administered once.  
The interchangeability of Comirnaty with COVID-19 vaccines from other manufacturers has not been 
established.  
Paediatric population 
There are paediatric formulations available for children 5 to 11 years of age. For details, please refer to 
the Summary of Product Characteristics for other formulations. 
The safety and efficacy of the vaccine in infants aged less than 6 months have not yet been 
established.  
Method of administration 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (1.5/1.5 micrograms)/dose concentrate for dispersion for 
injection should be administered intramuscularly after dilution (see section 6.6).  
After dilution, vials of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 contain 10 doses of 0.2 mL of vaccine. In 
order to extract 10 doses from a single vial, low dead-volume syringes and/or needles should be used. 
The low dead-volume syringe and needle combination should have a dead volume of no more than 
35 microlitres. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract 
10 doses from a single vial. Irrespective of the type of syringe and needle: 
• 
• 
Each dose must contain 0.2 mL of vaccine. 
If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.2 mL, discard the 
vial and any excess volume.  
Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials. 
• 
In infants from 6 to less than 12 months of age, the recommended injection site is the anterolateral 
aspect of the thigh. In individuals 1 year of age and older, the recommended injection site is the 
anterolateral aspect of the thigh or the deltoid muscle. 
Do not inject the vaccine intravascularly, subcutaneously or intradermally.  
The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products.

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability  
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
General recommendations 
Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis 
Events of anaphylaxis have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should 
always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the 
vaccine.  
Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. No further dose of 
the vaccine should be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis after a prior dose of 
Comirnaty. 
Myocarditis and pericarditis 
There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Comirnaty. These 
conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 
14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger 
males (see section 4.8). Available data indicate that most cases recover. Some cases required intensive 
care support and fatal cases have been observed. 
Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. 
Vaccinees (including parents or caregivers) should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention 
if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest 
pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination. 
Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this 
condition. 
Anxiety-related reactions 
Anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress‐related 
reactions (e.g. dizziness, palpitations, increases in heart rate, alterations in blood pressure, 
paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia and sweating) may occur in association with the vaccination process itself. 
Stress-related reactions are temporary and resolve on their own. Individuals should be advised to bring 
symptoms to the attention of the vaccination provider for evaluation. It is important that precautions 
are in place to avoid injury from fainting. 
Concurrent illness 
Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute 
infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination. 
Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders 
As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals 
receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as 
haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in 
these individuals. 
166 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Immunocompromised individuals 
The efficacy and safety of the vaccine has not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, 
including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of Comirnaty Original/Omicron 
BA.4-5 may be lower in immunocompromised individuals. 
Duration of protection 
The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by 
ongoing clinical trials. 
Limitations of vaccine effectiveness 
As with any vaccine, vaccination with Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 may not protect all 
vaccine recipients. Individuals may not be fully protected until 7 days after their vaccination. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
Concomitant administration of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 with other vaccines has not been 
studied. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (1.5/1.5 micrograms)/dose concentrate for dispersion for 
injection is not intended for individuals older than 5 years of age.  
For details for use in individuals older than 5 years of age, please refer to the Summary of Product 
Characteristics for those formulations. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive, cycle, and 
use machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the 
ability to drive, cycle, or use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile 
The safety of a dose of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 is inferred from safety data from 
Comirnaty and Omicron adapted vaccines. 
Comirnaty  
Infants 6 to 23 months of age – after 3 doses 
In an analysis of Study 3 (Phase 2/3), 1 776 infants (1 178 initially approved Comirnaty 3 mcg and 
598 placebo) were 6 to 23 months of age. Based on data in the blinded placebo-controlled follow-up 
period up to the cut-off date of 29 April 2022, 570 infants 6 to 23 months of age who received a 
3-dose primary course (386 Comirnaty 3 mcg and 184 placebo) have been followed for a median of 
1.3 months after the third dose. 
The most frequent adverse reactions in infants 6 to 23 months of age that received any primary course 
dose included irritability (> 60%), drowsiness (> 40%), decreased appetite (> 30%), tenderness at the 
injection site (> 20%), injection site redness and fever (> 10%).

Participants 12 years of age and older – after a booster dose of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 
(fourth dose) 
In a subset from Study 5 (Phase 2/3), 107 participants 12 to 17 years of age, 313 participants 18 to 
55 years of age and 306 participants 56 years of age and older who had completed 3 doses of 
Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 
(15/15 micrograms) 5.4 to 16.9 months after receiving Dose 3. Participants who received a booster 
(fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 had a median follow-up time of at least 1.5 
months.  
The overall safety profile for the Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 booster (fourth dose) was 
similar to that seen after 3 doses. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 12 years of age 
and older were injection site pain (> 60%), fatigue (> 50%), headache (> 40%), muscle pain (> 20%), 
chills (> 10%), and joint pain (> 10%).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Myocarditis and pericarditis 
The increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty is highest in younger males (see 
section 4.4). 
Two large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have estimated the excess risk in younger 
males following the second dose of Comirnaty. One study showed that in a period of 7 days after the 
second dose there were about 0.265 (95% CI 0.255 - 0.275) extra cases of myocarditis in 12-29 year 
old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. In another study, in a period of 28 days after the 
second dose there were 0.56 (95% CI 0.37 – 0.74) extra cases of myocarditis in 16-24 year old males 
per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. 
Limited data indicate that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty in 
children aged 5 to 11 years seems lower than in ages 12 to 17 years. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V and include batch/Lot number if available. 
4.9  Overdose 
Overdose data is available from 52 study participants included in the clinical trial that due to an error 
in dilution received 58 micrograms of Comirnaty. The vaccine recipients did not report an increase in 
reactogenicity or adverse reactions.  
In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is 
recommended.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BN01 
Mechanism of action 
The nucleoside-modified messenger RNA in Comirnaty is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which 
enable delivery of the non-replicating RNA into host cells to direct transient expression of the 
SARS-CoV-2 S antigen. The mRNA codes for membrane-anchored, full-length S with two point 
mutations within the central helix. Mutation of these two amino acids to proline locks S in an 
antigenically preferred prefusion conformation. The vaccine elicits both neutralizing antibody and 
cellular immune responses to the spike (S) antigen, which may contribute to protection against 
COVID-19. 
Efficacy 
Omicron-adapted Comirnaty 
Immunogenicity in infants and children 6 months to 4 years of age – after the booster (fourth dose) 
In an analysis of a subset from Study 6, 60 participants 6 months to 4 years of age received a booster 
(fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (1.5/1.5 mcg) after receiving 3 prior doses of 
Comirnaty 3 micrograms dose concentrate for dispersion. Results include immunogenicity data from a 
comparator subset of participants 6 months to 4 years of age in Study 3 who received 3 doses of 
Comirnaty 3 micrograms dose concentrate for dispersion.  
At 1 month after a booster dose (fourth dose), a booster dose with Comirnaty Original/Omicron 
BA.4-5 (1.5/1.5 mcg) elicited higher Omicron BA.4-5 specific neutralizing titres (regardless of 
baseline SARS-CoV-2 status) compared with the titres in the comparator group who received 3 doses 
of Comirnaty 3 micrograms dose concentrate for dispersion. Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 
(1.5/1.5 mcg) also elicited similar reference strain-specific titres compared with the titres in the 
comparator group.  
The vaccine immunogenicity results after a booster dose in participants 6 months to 4 years of age are 
presented in Table 2.

Immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – after the booster 
(fourth dose) 
In an analysis of a subset from Study 6, 103 participants 5 to 11 years of age who had previously 
received a 2-dose primary series and booster dose with Comirnaty received a booster (fourth dose) of 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5. Results include immunogenicity data from a comparator subset 
of participants 5 to 11 years of age in Study 3 who received 3 doses of Comirnaty. In participants 5 to 
11 years of age who received a fourth dose of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 and participants 5 
to 11 years of age who received a third dose of Comirnaty, 57.3% and 58.4% were positive for 
SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, respectively. 
The immune response 1 month after a booster dose (fourth dose), Comirnaty Original/Omicron 
BA.4-5 elicited generally similar Omicron BA.4/BA.5-specific neutralizing titres compared with the 
titres in the comparator group who received 3 doses of Comirnaty. Comirnaty Original/Omicron 
BA.4-5 also elicited similar reference strain-specific titres compared with the titres in the comparator 
group.

Immunogenicity in participants 12 years of age and older – after the booster (fourth dose) 
In an analysis of a subset from Study 5, 105 participants 12 to 17 years of age, 297 participants 18 to 
55 years of age, and 286 participants 56 years of age and older who had previously received a 2-dose 
primary series and booster dose with Comirnaty received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5. In participants 12 through 17 years of age, 18 through 55 years of age, and 
56 years of age and older, 75.2%, 71.7% and 61.5% were positive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, 
respectively. 
Analyses of 50% neutralizing antibody titres (NT50) against Omicron BA.4-5 and against reference 
strain among participants 56 years of age and older who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 in Study 5 compared to a subset of participants from Study 4 who received 
a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty demonstrated superiority of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 
to Comirnaty based on geometric mean ratio (GMR) and noninferiority based on difference in 
seroresponse rates with respect to anti-Omicron BA.4-5 response, and noninferiority of anti-reference 
strain immune response based on GMR (Table 4).  
Analyses of NT50 against Omicron BA.4/BA.5 among participants 18 through 55 years of age 
compared to participants 56 years of age and older who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 in Study 5 demonstrated noninferiority of anti-Omicron BA.4-5 response 
among participants 18 through 55 years of age compared to participants 56 years of age and older for 
both GMR and difference in seroresponse rates (Table 4). 
The study also assessed the level of NT50 of the anti-Omicron BA.4-5 SARS-CoV-2 and reference 
strains pre-vaccination and 1 month after vaccination in participants who received a booster (fourth 
dose) (Table 5).

Study 2 is a multicentre, multinational, Phase 1/2/3 randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind 
dose-finding, vaccine candidate selection and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. 
Randomisation was stratified by age: 12 to 15 years of age, 16 to 55 years of age, or 56 years of age 
and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the ≥ 56-year stratum. The study excluded 
participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological 
diagnosis of COVID-19. Participants with pre-existing stable disease, defined as disease not requiring 
significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before 
enrolment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV).  
Efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older – after 2 doses 
In the Phase 2/3 portion of Study 2, based on data accrued through 14 November 2020, approximately 
44 000 participants were randomised equally and were to receive 2 doses of the initially approved 
COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine or placebo. The efficacy analyses included participants that received their 
second vaccination within 19 to 42 days after their first vaccination. The majority (93.1%) of vaccine 
recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Participants are planned to be 
followed for up to 24 months after Dose 2, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID-19. 
In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 14 days before and 
after administration of an influenza vaccine in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA 
Vaccine. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 60 days 
before or after receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins within through conclusion of the 
study in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine. 
The population for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included 36 621 participants 12 years 
of age and older (18 242 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 18 379 in the placebo group) 
who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 through 7 days after the second dose. 
In addition, 134 participants were between the ages of 16 to 17 years of age (66 in the COVID-19 
176 
 
 
 
mRNA Vaccine group and 68 in the placebo group) and 1 616 participants 75 years of age and older 
(804 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 812 in the placebo group). 
At the time of the primary efficacy analysis, participants had been followed for symptomatic 
COVID-19 for in total 2 214 person-years for the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and in total 
2 222 person-years in the placebo group.  
There were no meaningful clinical differences in overall vaccine efficacy in participants who were at 
risk of severe COVID-19 including those with 1 or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe 
COVID-19 (e.g. asthma, body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes 
mellitus, hypertension).

Efficacy against severe COVID-19  
Updated efficacy analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints supported benefit of the COVID-19 mRNA 
Vaccine in preventing severe COVID‑19. 
As of 13 March 2021, vaccine efficacy against severe COVID-19 is presented only for participants 
with or without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 8) as the COVID-19 case counts in participants 
without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection were the same as those in participants with or without prior 
SARS-CoV-2 infection in both the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and placebo groups.

Efficacy and immunogenicity in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age – after 2 doses 
In an initial analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (representing a median follow-up 
duration of > 2 months after Dose 2) without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 
1 005 participants who received the vaccine and 16 cases out of 978 who received placebo. The point 
estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 75.3, 100.0). In participants with or without 
179 
 
 
 
 
 
evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 18 cases in 
1 110 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% 
(95% confidence interval 78.1, 100.0).  
Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additional confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued during 
blinded placebo-controlled follow-up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy 
population.  
In the updated efficacy analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age without evidence of 
prior infection, there were no cases in 1 057 participants who received the vaccine and 28 cases out of 
1 030 who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 86.8, 
100.0) during the period when Alpha variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants 
with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 
30 cases  in 1 109 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy 
is 100% (95% confidence interval 87.5, 100.0). 
In Study 2, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising titres 1 month after Dose 2 was conducted in a 
randomly selected subset of participants who had no serological or virological evidence of past 
SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, comparing the response in adolescents 12 to 
15 years of age (n = 190) to participants 16 to 25 years of age (n = 170).  
The ratio of the geometric mean titres (GMT) in the 12 to 15 years of age group to the 16 to 25 years 
of age group was 1.76, with a 2-sided 95% CI of 1.47 to 2.10. Therefore, the 1.5-fold noninferiority 
criterion was met as the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio [GMR] was 
> 0.67. 
Efficacy and immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – 
after 2 doses 
Study 3 is a Phase 1/2/3 study comprised of an open-label vaccine dose-finding portion (Phase 1) and 
a multicentre, multinational, randomised, saline placebo-controlled, observer-blind efficacy portion 
(Phase 2/3) that has enrolled participants 5 to 11 years of age. The majority (94.4%) of randomised 
vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. 
Initial descriptive vaccine efficacy results in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior 
SARS-CoV-2 infection are presented in Table 9. No cases of COVID-19 were observed in either the 
vaccine group or the placebo group in participants with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Pre-specified hypothesis-driven efficacy analysis was performed with additional confirmed 
COVID-19 cases accrued during blinded placebo-controlled follow-up, representing up to 6 months 
after Dose 2 in the efficacy population.  
In the efficacy analysis of Study 3 in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior infection, 
there were 10 cases in 2 703 participants who received the vaccine and 42 cases out of 1 348 who 
received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 88.2% (95% confidence interval 76.2, 94.7) during 
the period when Delta variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants with or without 
evidence of prior infection there were 12 cases in the 3 018 who received vaccine and 42 cases in 
1 511 participants who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 85.7% (95% confidence 
interval 72.4, 93.2). 
In Study 3, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralising titres (NT50) 1 month after Dose 2 in a 
randomly selected subset of participants demonstrated effectiveness by immunobridging of immune 
responses comparing children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) in the Phase 2/3 
part of Study 3 to participants 16 to 25 years of age in the Phase 2/3 part of Study 2 who had no 
serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, meeting 
the prespecified immunobridging criteria for both the geometric mean ratio (GMR) and the 
seroresponse difference with seroresponse defined as achieving at least 4-fold rise in SARS-CoV-2 
NT50 from baseline (before Dose 1).  
The GMR of the SARS-CoV-2 NT50 1 month after Dose 2 in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to 
less than 12 years of age) to that of young adults 16 to 25 years of age was 1.04 (2-sided 95% CI: 0.93, 
1.18). Among participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after 
Dose 2, 99.2% of children 5 to 11 years of age and 99.2% of participants 16 to 25 years of age had a 
seroresponse at 1 month after Dose 2. The difference in proportions of participants who had 
seroresponse between the 2 age groups (children – young adult) was 0.0% (2-sided 95% CI: -2.0%, 
2.2%). This information is presented in Table 10.

Immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – after booster 
dose  
A booster dose of Comirnaty was given to 401 randomly selected participants in Study 3. 
Effectiveness of a booster dose in ages 5 to 11 is inferred by immunogenicity. The immunogenicity of 
this was assessed through NT50 against the reference strain of SARS-CoV-2 (USA_WA1/2020). 
Analyses of NT50 1 month after the booster dose compared to before the booster dose demonstrated a 
substantial increase in GMTs in individuals 5 through 11 years of age who had no serological or 
virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after the dose 2 and the booster 
dose. This analysis is summarized in Table 11.

Efficacy and immunogenicity of a 3-dose primary course in infants and children 6 months to 4 years of 
age 
The efficacy analysis of Study 3 was performed across the combined population of participants 
6 months through 4 years of age based on cases confirmed among 873 participants in the COVID-19 
mRNA Vaccine group and 381 participants in the placebo group (2:1 randomization ratio) who 
received all 3 doses of study intervention during the blinded follow-up period when the Omicron 
variant of SARS-CoV-2 (BA.2) was the predominant variant in circulation (data cut-off date of 
17 June 2022).

SARS-CoV-2 infection (i.e. negative N-binding antibody [serum] result at Dose 1, 1 month post-Dose 2 (if 
available), Dose 3 (if available) visits, SARS-CoV-2 not detected by NAAT [nasal swab] at Dose 1, Dose 2, 
and Dose 3 study visits, and a negative NAAT [nasal swab] result at any unscheduled visit prior to 7 days 
after receipt of Dose 3) and had no medical history of COVID-19 were included in the analysis.

Vaccine efficacy in participants with or without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was similar to those 
participants without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
Severe COVID-19 criteria (as described in the protocol, based on FDA definition and modified for 
children) were fulfilled for 12 cases (8 COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and 4 placebo) among participants 
6 months to 4 years of age. Among participants 6 months through 23 months of age, severe 
COVID-19 criteria were fulfilled for 3 cases (2 COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and 1 placebo).  
Immunogenicity analyses have been performed in the immunobridging subset of 82 Study 3 
participants 6 to 23 months of age and 143 Study 3 participants 2 to 4 years of age without evidence of 
infection up to 1 month after Dose 3 based on a data cut-off date of 29 April 2022.  
SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralising antibody titres (NT50) were compared between an immunogenicity 
subset of Phase 2/3 participants 6 to 23 months of age and 2 to 4 years of age from Study 3 at 1 month 
after the 3-dose primary course and a randomly selected subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants 16 
to 25 years of age at 1 month after the 2-dose primary course, using a microneutralisation assay 
against the reference strain (USA_WA1/2020).  
The primary immunobridging analyses compared the geometric mean titres (using a geometric mean 
ratio [GMR]) and the seroresponse (defined as achieving at least 4-fold rise in SARS-CoV-2 NT50 
from before Dose 1) rates in the evaluable immunogenicity population of participants without 
evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 3 in participants 6 to 23 months of 
age and 2 to 4 years of age and up to 1 month after Dose 2 in participants 16 to 25 years of age. The

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Comirnaty in the paediatric population in prevention of COVID-19 (see section 4.2 for information on 
paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Not applicable. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose 
toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity. 
General toxicity 
Rats intramuscularly administered Comirnaty (receiving 3 full human doses once weekly, generating 
relatively higher levels in rats due to body weight differences) demonstrated some injection site 
oedema and erythema and increases in white blood cells (including basophils and eosinophils) 
consistent with an inflammatory response as well as vacuolation of portal hepatocytes without 
evidence of liver injury. All effects were reversible. 
Genotoxicity/Carcinogenicity 
Neither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies were performed. The components of the vaccine (lipids 
and mRNA) are not expected to have genotoxic potential.  
Reproductive toxicity 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity were investigated in rats in a combined fertility and 
developmental toxicity study where female rats were intramuscularly administered Comirnaty prior to 
mating and during gestation (receiving 4 full human doses that generate relatively higher levels in rat 
due to body weight differences, spanning between pre-mating day 21 and gestational day 20). 
SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody responses were present in maternal animals from prior to mating 
to the end of the study on postnatal day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no 
vaccine-related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo-foetal or offspring development. No 
Comirnaty data are available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk.

12 years of age. For details, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for other 
formulations. 
The safety and efficacy of the vaccine in infants aged less than 6 months have not yet been 
established. 
Elderly population 
No dose adjustment is required in elderly individuals ≥ 65 years of age. 
Method of administration 
Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 30 micrograms/dose dispersion for injection should be administered 
intramuscularly (see section 6.6). Do not dilute prior to use. 
The preferred site is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. 
Do not inject the vaccine intravascularly, subcutaneously or intradermally.  
The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products. 
For precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4. 
For instructions regarding thawing, handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6. 
Single dose vials 
Single dose vials of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 contain 1 dose of 0.3 mL of vaccine.  
•  Withdraw a single 0.3 mL dose of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5.  
• 
• 
Discard vial and any excess volume.  
Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials. 
Multidose vials 
Multidose vials of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 contain 6 doses of 0.3 mL of vaccine. In order to 
extract 6 doses from a single vial, low dead-volume syringes and/or needles should be used. The low 
dead-volume syringe and needle combination should have a dead volume of no more than 
35 microlitres. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract 
a sixth dose from a single vial. Irrespective of the type of syringe and needle: 
• 
• 
Each dose must contain 0.3 mL of vaccine. 
If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.3 mL, discard the 
vial and any excess volume.  
Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials.

General recommendations 
Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis 
Events of anaphylaxis have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should 
always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the 
vaccine.  
Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. No further dose of 
the vaccine should be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis after a prior dose of 
Comirnaty. 
Myocarditis and pericarditis 
There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Comirnaty. These 
conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 
14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger 
males (see section 4.8). Available data indicate that most cases recover. Some cases required intensive 
care support and fatal cases have been observed.  
Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. 
Vaccinees (including parents or caregivers) should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention 
if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest 
pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination. 
Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this 
condition. 
Anxiety-related reactions 
Anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress‐related 
reactions (e.g. dizziness, palpitations, increases in heart rate, alterations in blood pressure, 
paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia and sweating) may occur in association with the vaccination process itself. 
Stress-related reactions are temporary and resolve on their own. Individuals should be advised to bring 
symptoms to the attention of the vaccination provider for evaluation. It is important that precautions 
are in place to avoid injury from fainting. 
Concurrent illness 
Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute 
infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination. 
Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders 
As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals 
receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as 
haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in 
these individuals. 
Immunocompromised individuals 
The efficacy and safety of the vaccine has not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, 
including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 
may be lower in immunocompromised individuals. 
Duration of protection 
The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by 
ongoing clinical trials. 
Limitations of vaccine effectiveness 
As with any vaccine, vaccination with Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 may not protect all vaccine 
recipients. Individuals may not be fully protected until 7 days after their vaccination.

Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
Concomitant administration of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 with other vaccines has not been studied. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 during pregnancy.  
However, a large amount of observational data from pregnant women vaccinated with the initially 
approved Comirnaty vaccine during the second and third trimester have not shown an increase in 
adverse pregnancy outcomes. While data on pregnancy outcomes following vaccination during the 
first trimester are presently limited, no increased risk for miscarriage has been seen. Animal studies do 
not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, 
parturition or post-natal development (see section 5.3). Based on data available with other vaccine 
variants, Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 can be used during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 during breast-feeding.  
However, no effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of 
breast-feeding woman to the vaccine is negligible. Observational data from women who were 
breast-feeding after vaccination with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine have not shown a risk 
for adverse effects in breastfed newborns/infants. Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 can be used during 
breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive 
or use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile 
The safety of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 is inferred from safety data of the prior Comirnaty 
vaccines.  
Comirnaty 30 mcg 
Participants 16 years of age and older – after 2 doses 
In Study 2, a total of 22 026 participants 16 years of age or older received at least 1 dose of the 
initially approved Comirnaty vaccine and a total of 22 021 participants 16 years of age or older 
received placebo (including 138 and 145 adolescents 16 and 17 years of age in the vaccine and 
placebo groups, respectively). A total of 20 519 participants 16 years of age or older received 2 doses 
of Comirnaty.  
193 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At the time of the analysis of Study 2 with a data cut-off of 13 March 2021 for the placebo-controlled 
blinded follow-up period up to the participants’ unblinding dates, a total of 25 651 (58.2%) 
participants (13 031 Comirnaty and 12 620 placebo) 16 years of age and older were followed up for 
≥ 4 months after the second dose. This included a total of 15 111 (7 704 Comirnaty and 7 407 placebo) 
participants 16 to 55 years of age and a total of 10 540 (5 327 Comirnaty and 5 213 placebo) 
participants 56 years of age and older. 
The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 16 years of age and older that received 2 doses 
were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 50%), myalgia (> 40%), chills 
(> 30%), arthralgia (> 20%), pyrexia and injection site swelling (> 10%) and were usually mild or 
moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of 
reactogenicity events was associated with greater age. 
The safety profile in 545 participants 16 years of age and older receiving Comirnaty, that were 
seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, was similar to that seen in the general population. 
Adolescents 12 to 15 years of age – after 2 doses 
In an analysis of long-term safety follow-up in Study 2, 2 260 adolescents (1 131 Comirnaty and 
1 129 placebo) were 12 to 15 years of age. Of these, 1 559 adolescents (786 Comirnaty and 
773 placebo) have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. 
The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age was similar to that seen in 
participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in adolescents 12 to 
15 years of age that received 2 doses were injection site pain (> 90%), fatigue and headache (> 70%), 
myalgia and chills (> 40%), arthralgia and pyrexia (> 20%). 
Participants 12 years of age and older – after booster dose 
A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 306 adults 18 to 55 years of age who completed the 
original Comirnaty 2-dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 6 months 
(range of 4.8 to 8.0 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, 
had a median follow-up time of 8.3 months (range 1.1 to 8.5 months) and 301 participants had been 
followed for ≥ 6 months after the booster dose to the cut-off date (22 November 2021). 
The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after 2 doses. The most frequent 
adverse reactions in participants 18 to 55 years of age were injection site pain (> 80%), 
fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 40%), myalgia (> 30%), chills and arthralgia (> 20%).  
In Study 4, a placebo-controlled booster study, participants 16 years of age and older recruited from 
Study 2 received a booster dose of Comirnaty (5 081 participants), or placebo (5 044 participants) at 
least 6 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, 
had a median follow-up time of 2.8 months (range 0.3 to 7.5 months) after the booster dose in the 
blinded placebo-controlled follow-up period to the cut-off date (8 February 2022). Of these, 
1 281 participants (895 Comirnaty and 386 placebo) have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the 
booster dose of Comirnaty. No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified. 
A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 825 adolescents 12 to 15 years of age who completed 
the original Comirnaty 2-dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 
11.2 months (range of 6.3 to 20.1 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a 
booster dose, had a median follow-up time of 9.5 months (range 1.5 to 10.7 months) based on data up 
to the cut-off date (3 November 2022). No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified. 
Participants 12 years of age and older – after subsequent booster doses 
The safety of a booster dose of Comirnaty in participants 12 years of age and older is inferred from 
safety data from studies of a booster dose of Comirnaty in participants 18 years of age and older. 
A subset of 325 adults 18 to ≤ 55 years of age who had completed 3 doses of Comirnaty, received a 
booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 90 to 180 days after receiving Dose 3. Participants who received a 
194 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty had a median follow-up time of 1.4 months up to a data cut-off 
date of 11 March 2022. The most frequent adverse reactions in these participants were injection site 
pain (> 70%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 40%), myalgia and chills (> 20%), and arthralgia (> 10%).  
In a subset from Study 4 (Phase 3), 305 adults > 55 years of age who had completed 3 doses of 
Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 5 to 12 months after receiving Dose 3. 
Participants who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty had a median follow-up time of at least 
1.7 months up to a data cut-off date of 16 May 2022. The overall safety profile for the Comirnaty 
booster (fourth dose) was similar to that seen after the Comirnaty booster (third dose). The most 
frequent adverse reactions in participants > 55 years of age were injection site pain (> 60%), 
fatigue (> 40%), headache (> 20%), myalgia and chills (> 10%).  
Booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine  
In 5 independent studies on the use of a Comirnaty booster dose in individuals who had completed 
primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose), no new 
safety issues were identified (see section 5.1). 
Omicron-adapted Comirnaty 
Participants 12 years of age and older – after a booster dose of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 
(fourth dose) 
In a subset from Study 5 (Phase 2/3), 107 participants 12 to 17 years of age, 313 participants 18 to 
55 years of age and 306 participants 56 years of age and older who had completed 3 doses of 
Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 
(15/15 micrograms) 5.4 to 16.9 months after receiving Dose 3. Participants who received a booster 
(fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 had a median follow-up time of at least 
1.5 months. 
The overall safety profile for the Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 booster (fourth dose) was 
similar to that seen after 3 doses. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 12 years of age 
and older were injection site pain (> 60%), fatigue (> 50%), headache (> 40%), muscle pain (> 20%), 
chills (> 10%), and joint pain (> 10%).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Myocarditis and pericarditis 
The increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty is highest in younger males (see 
section 4.4). 
Two large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have estimated the excess risk in younger 
males following the second dose of Comirnaty. One study showed that in a period of 7 days after the 
second dose there were about 0.265 (95% CI 0.255 - 0.275) extra cases of myocarditis in 12-29 year 
old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. In another study, in a period of 28 days after the 
second dose there were 0.56 (95% CI 0.37 - 0.74) extra cases of myocarditis in 16-24 year old males 
per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. 
Limited data indicate that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty in 
children aged 5 to 11 years seems lower than in ages 12 to 17 years. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V and include batch/Lot number if available. 
4.9  Overdose 
Overdose data is available from 52 study participants included in the clinical trial that due to an error 
in dilution received 58 micrograms of Comirnaty. The vaccine recipients did not report an increase in 
reactogenicity or adverse reactions.  
196 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is 
recommended.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BN01 
Mechanism of action 
The nucleoside-modified messenger RNA in Comirnaty is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which 
enable delivery of the non-replicating RNA into host cells to direct transient expression of the 
SARS-CoV-2 S antigen. The mRNA codes for membrane-anchored, full-length S with two point 
mutations within the central helix. Mutation of these two amino acids to proline locks S in an 
antigenically preferred prefusion conformation. The vaccine elicits both neutralizing antibody and 
cellular immune responses to the spike (S) antigen, which may contribute to protection against 
COVID-19. 
Efficacy 
Omicron-adapted Comirnaty 
Immunogenicity in participants 12 years of age and older – after the booster (fourth dose) 
In an analysis of a subset from Study 5, 105 participants 12 to 17 years of age, 297 participants 18 to 
55 years of age, and 286 participants 56 years of age and older who had previously received a 2-dose 
primary series and booster dose with Comirnaty received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5. In participants 12 to 17 years of age, 18 to 55 years of age, and 56 years of 
age and older, 75.2%, 71.7% and 61.5% were positive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, respectively. 
Analyses of 50% neutralizing antibody titres (NT50) against Omicron BA.4-5 and against reference 
strain among participants 56 years of age and older who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 in Study 5 compared to a subset of participants from Study 4 who received 
a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty demonstrated superiority of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 
to Comirnaty based on geometric mean ratio (GMR) and noninferiority based on difference in 
seroresponse rates with respect to anti-Omicron BA.4-5 response, and noninferiority of anti-reference 
strain immune response based on GMR (Table 2). 
Analyses of NT50 against Omicron BA.4/BA.5 among participants 18 to 55 years of age compared to 
participants 56 years of age and older who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 in Study 5 demonstrated noninferiority of anti-Omicron BA.4-5 response 
among participants 18 to 55 years of age compared to participants 56 years of age and older for both 
GMR and difference in seroresponse rates (Table 2). 
The study also assessed the level of NT50 of the anti-Omicron BA.4-5 SARS-CoV-2 and reference 
strains pre-vaccination and 1 month after vaccination in participants who received a booster (fourth 
dose) (Table 3).

Abbreviations: CI = confidence interval; GMR = geometric mean ratio; GMT = geometric mean titre; 
LLOQ = lower limit of quantitation; LS = least square; NT50 = 50% neutralizing titre; SARS-CoV-2 = severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. 
Note: Seroresponse is defined as achieving a ≥ 4-fold rise from baseline. If the baseline measurement is below 
the LLOQ, a postvaccination assay result ≥ 4 × LLOQ is considered a seroresponse. 
a.  n = Number of participants with valid and determinate assay results for the specified assay at the given 
sampling time point. 
b.  GMTs and 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the mean logarithm of the titres and the 
corresponding CIs (based on the Student t distribution). Assay results below the LLOQ were set to 
0.5 × LLOQ. 
c.  GMRs and 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the difference of LS means and 
corresponding CIs based on analysis of logarithmically transformed neutralizing titres using a linear 
regression model with terms of baseline neutralizing titre (log scale) and vaccine group or age group.

Study 2 is a multicentre, multinational, Phase 1/2/3 randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind 
dose-finding, vaccine candidate selection and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. 
Randomisation was stratified by age: 12 to 15 years of age, 16 to 55 years of age, or 56 years of age 
and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the ≥ 56-year stratum. The study excluded 
participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological 
diagnosis of COVID-19. Participants with pre-existing stable disease, defined as disease not requiring 
significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before 
enrolment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV).  
Efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older – after 2 doses 
In the Phase 2/3 portion of Study 2, based on data accrued through 14 November 2020, approximately 
44 000 participants were randomised equally and were to receive 2 doses of the initially approved 
COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine or placebo. The efficacy analyses included participants that received their 
199 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
second vaccination within 19 to 42 days after their first vaccination. The majority (93.1%) of vaccine 
recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Participants are planned to be 
followed for up to 24 months after Dose 2, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID-19. 
In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 14 days before and 
after administration of an influenza vaccine in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA 
Vaccine. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 60 days 
before or after receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins within through conclusion of the 
study in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine. 
The population for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included 36 621 participants 12 years 
of age and older (18 242 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 18 379 in the placebo group) 
who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 through 7 days after the second dose.  
In addition, 134 participants were between the ages of 16 to 17 years of age (66 in the COVID-19 
mRNA Vaccine group and 68 in the placebo group) and 1 616 participants 75 years of age and older 
(804 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 812 in the placebo group). 
At the time of the primary efficacy analysis, participants had been followed for symptomatic 
COVID-19 for in total 2 214 person-years for the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and in total 
2 222 person-years in the placebo group.  
There were no meaningful clinical differences in overall vaccine efficacy in participants who were at 
risk of severe COVID-19 including those with 1 or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe 
COVID-19 (e.g. asthma, body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes 
mellitus, hypertension).

In the updated efficacy analysis, efficacy of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing first COVID-19 
occurrence from 7 days after Dose 2 compared to placebo was 91.1% (95% CI of 88.8% to 93.0%) 
during the period when Wuhan/Wild type and Alpha variants were the predominant circulating strains 
in participants in the evaluable efficacy population with or without evidence of prior infection with 
SARS-CoV-2.  
Additionally, the updated efficacy analyses by subgroup showed similar efficacy point estimates 
across sexes, ethnic groups, geography and participants with medical comorbidities and obesity 
associated with high risk of severe COVID-19.  
Efficacy against severe COVID-19  
Updated efficacy analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints supported benefit of the COVID-19 mRNA 
Vaccine in preventing severe COVID‑19. 
As of 13 March 2021, vaccine efficacy against severe COVID-19 is presented only for participants 
with or without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 6) as the COVID-19 case counts in participants 
without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection were the same as those in participants with or without prior 
SARS-CoV-2 infection in both the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and placebo groups.

Efficacy and immunogenicity in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age – after 2 doses  
In an initial analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (representing a median follow-up 
duration of > 2 months after Dose 2) without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 
1 005 participants who received the vaccine and 16 cases out of 978 who received placebo. The point 
estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 75.3, 100.0). In participants with or without 
evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 18 cases in 
1 110 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% 
(95% confidence interval 78.1, 100.0).  
Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additional confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued during 
blinded placebo-controlled follow-up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy 
population.  
In the updated efficacy analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age without evidence of 
prior infection, there were no cases in 1 057 participants who received the vaccine and 28 cases out of 
1 030 who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 86.8, 
100.0) during the period when Alpha variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants 
with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 
30 cases  in 1 109 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy 
is 100% (95% confidence interval 87.5, 100.0). 
In Study 2, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising titres 1 month after Dose 2 was conducted in a 
randomly selected subset of participants who had no serological or virological evidence of past 
SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, comparing the response in adolescents 12 to 
15 years of age (n = 190) to participants 16 to 25 years of age (n = 170).  
The ratio of the geometric mean titres (GMT) in the 12 to 15 years of age group to the 16 to 25 years 
of age group was 1.76, with a 2-sided 95% CI of 1.47 to 2.10. Therefore, the 1.5-fold noninferiority 
criterion was met as the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio [GMR] was 
> 0.67. 
Immunogenicity in participants 18 years of age and older – after booster dose 
Effectiveness of a booster dose of Comirnaty was based on an assessment of 50% neutralizing 
antibody titres (NT50) against SARS-CoV-2 (USA_WA1/2020) in Study 2. In this study, the booster 
dose was administered 5 to 8 months (median 7 months) after the second dose. In Study 2, analyses of 
NT50 1 month after the booster dose compared to 1 month after the primary series in individuals 18 
through 55 years of age who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection 
up to 1 month after the booster vaccination demonstrated noninferiority for both geometric mean ratio 
(GMR) and difference in seroresponse rates. Seroresponse for a participant was defined as achieving a 
≥ 4-fold rise in NT50 from baseline (before primary series). These analyses are summarized in 
Table 7.

who only received the primary series dose was assessed.  
204 
 
  
 
 
The relative vaccine efficacy information for participants 16 years of age and older without prior 
evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is presented in Table 8. Relative vaccine efficacy in participants 
with or without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was 94.6% (95% confidence interval of 
88.5% to 97.9%), similar to that seen in those participants without evidence of prior infection. Primary 
COVID-19 cases observed from 7 days after booster vaccination were 7 primary cases in the 
Comirnaty group, and 124 primary cases in the placebo group.

Immunogenicity of a booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 
vaccine 
Effectiveness of a Comirnaty booster dose (30 mcg) in individuals who completed primary 
vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose) is inferred from 
immunogenicity data from an independent National Institutes of Health (NIH) study phase 1/2 
open-label clinical trial (NCT04889209) conducted in the United States. In this study, adults (range 19 
to 80 years of age) who had completed primary vaccination with Moderna 100 mcg 2-dose series 
(N = 51, mean age 54±17), Janssen single dose (N = 53, mean age 48±14), or Comirnaty 30 mcg 
2-dose series (N = 50, mean age 50±18) at least 12 weeks prior to enrolment and who reported no 
history of SARS-CoV-2 infection received a booster dose of Comirnaty (30 mcg). The boost with 
Comirnaty induced a 36, 12, and 20 GMR-fold rise in neutralising titres following the Janssen, 
Moderna, and Comirnaty primary doses, respectively. 
Heterologous boosting with Comirnaty was also evaluated in the CoV-BOOST study 
(EudraCT 2021-002175-19), a multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 2 trial of third dose booster 
vaccination against COVID-19, in which 107 adult participants (median age 71 years of age, 
interquartile range 54 to 77 years of age) were randomised at least 70 days post 2 doses of 
AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine. After the AstraZeneca COVID‑19 Vaccine primary series, 
205 
 
 
 
 
pseudovirus (wild-type), neutralising antibody NT50 GMR-fold change increased 21.6-fold with 
heterologous Comirnaty booster (n = 95).  
Immunogenicity in participants > 55 years of age – after a booster dose (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 
(30 mcg) 
In an interim analysis of a subset from Study 4 (Substudy E), 305 participants > 55 years of age who 
had completed a series of 3 doses of Comirnaty received Comirnaty (30 mcg) as a booster dose (fourth 
dose) 5 to 12 months after receiving Dose 3. For the Immunogenicity subset data see Table 7.  
Immunogenicity in participants 18 to ≤ 55 years of age – after a booster dose (fourth dose) of 
Comirnaty (30 mcg)  
In Substudy D [a subset from Study 2 (Phase 3) and Study 4 (Phase 3)], 325 participants 18 to 
≤ 55 years of age who had completed 3 doses of Comirnaty received Comirnaty (30 mcg) as a booster 
dose (fourth dose) 90 to 180 days after receiving Dose 3. For the Immunogenicity subset data see

Comirnaty in the paediatric population in prevention of COVID-19 (see section 4.2 for information on 
paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Not applicable. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose 
toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity. 
General toxicity 
Rats intramuscularly administered Comirnaty (receiving 3 full human doses once weekly, generating 
relatively higher levels in rats due to body weight differences) demonstrated some injection site 
oedema and erythema and increases in white blood cells (including basophils and eosinophils) 
consistent with an inflammatory response as well as vacuolation of portal hepatocytes without 
evidence of liver injury. All effects were reversible. 
Genotoxicity/Carcinogenicity 
Neither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies were performed. The components of the vaccine (lipids 
and mRNA) are not expected to have genotoxic potential.  
Reproductive toxicity 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity were investigated in rats in a combined fertility and 
developmental toxicity study where female rats were intramuscularly administered Comirnaty prior to 
mating and during gestation (receiving 4 full human doses that generate relatively higher levels in rat 
due to body weight differences, spanning between pre-mating day 21 and gestational day 20). 
SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody responses were present in maternal animals from prior to mating 
to the end of the study on postnatal day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no 
vaccine-related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo-foetal or offspring development. No 
Comirnaty data are available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 10 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is indicated 
for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, in children aged 5 to 11 years.  
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) 
Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 10 micrograms/dose is administered intramuscularly after dilution as a 
single dose of 0.2 mL for children 5 to 11 years of age regardless of prior COVID-19 vaccination 
status (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
For individuals who have previously been vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty Omicron 
XBB.1.5 should be administered at least 3 months after the most recent dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.  
Severely immunocompromised aged 5 years and older 
Additional doses may be administered to individuals who are severely immunocompromised in 
accordance with national recommendations (see section 4.4). 
212 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 10 micrograms/dose should be used only for children 5 to 11 years of 
age. 
Paediatric population 
There are paediatric formulations available for infants and children aged 6 months to 4 years. For 
details, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for other formulations. 
The safety and efficacy of the vaccine in infants aged less than 6 months have not yet been 
established. 
Method of administration 
Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 10 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection should be 
administered intramuscularly after dilution (see section 6.6).  
After dilution, vials of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 contain 10 doses of 0.2 mL of vaccine. In order 
to extract 10 doses from a single vial, low dead-volume syringes and/or needles should be used. The 
low dead-volume syringe and needle combination should have a dead volume of no more than 
35 microlitres. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract 
10 doses from a single vial. Irrespective of the type of syringe and needle: 
• 
• 
Each dose must contain 0.2 mL of vaccine. 
If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.2 mL, discard the 
vial and any excess volume.  
Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials. 
• 
The preferred site is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. 
Do not inject the vaccine intravascularly, subcutaneously or intradermally.  
The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products. 
For precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4. 
For instructions regarding thawing, handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability  
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
General recommendations 
Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis 
Events of anaphylaxis have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should 
always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the 
vaccine.  
Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. No further dose of 
the vaccine should be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis after a prior dose of 
Comirnaty. 
213 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Myocarditis and pericarditis 
There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Comirnaty. These 
conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 
14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger 
males (see section 4.8). Available data indicate that most cases recover. Some cases required intensive 
care support and fatal cases have been observed.  
Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. 
Vaccinees (including parents or caregivers) should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention 
if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest 
pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination. 
Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this 
condition. 
Anxiety-related reactions 
Anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress‐related 
reactions (e.g. dizziness, palpitations, increases in heart rate, alterations in blood pressure, 
paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia and sweating) may occur in association with the vaccination process itself. 
Stress-related reactions are temporary and resolve on their own. Individuals should be advised to bring 
symptoms to the attention of the vaccination provider for evaluation. It is important that precautions 
are in place to avoid injury from fainting. 
Concurrent illness 
Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute 
infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination. 
Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders 
As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals 
receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as 
haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in 
these individuals. 
Immunocompromised individuals 
The efficacy and safety of the vaccine has not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, 
including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 
may be lower in immunocompromised individuals. 
Duration of protection 
The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by 
ongoing clinical trials. 
Limitations of vaccine effectiveness 
As with any vaccine, vaccination with Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 may not protect all vaccine 
recipients. Individuals may not be fully protected until 7 days after their vaccination. 
4.5

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 during pregnancy.  
However, a large amount of observational data from pregnant women vaccinated with the initially 
approved Comirnaty vaccine during the second and third trimester have not shown an increase in 
adverse pregnancy outcomes. While data on pregnancy outcomes following vaccination during the 
first trimester are presently limited, no increased risk for miscarriage has been seen. Animal studies do 
not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, 
parturition or post-natal development (see section 5.3). Based on data available with other vaccine 
variants, Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 can be used during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 during breast-feeding.  
However, no effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of 
breast-feeding woman to the vaccine is negligible. Observational data from women who were 
breast-feeding after vaccination with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine have not shown a risk 
for adverse effects in breastfed newborns/infants. Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 can be used during 
breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive 
or use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile 
The safety of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 is inferred from safety data of the prior Comirnaty 
vaccine.  
Comirnaty  
Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – after 2 doses 
In Study 3, a total of 3 109 children 5 to 11 years of age received at least 1 dose of the initially 
approved Comirnaty vaccine 10 mcg and a total of 1 538 children 5 to 11 years of age received 
placebo. At the time of the analysis of Study 3 Phase 2/3 with data up to the cut-off date of 
20 May 2022, 2 206 (1 481 Comirnaty 10 mcg and 725 placebo) children have been followed for 
≥ 4 months after the second dose in the placebo-controlled blinded follow-up period. The safety 
evaluation in Study 3 is ongoing. 
The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in participants 5 to 11 years of age was similar to that seen in 
participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in children 5 to 11 years of 
age that received 2 doses were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 50%), headache (> 30%), 
injection site redness and swelling (≥ 20%), myalgia, chills, and diarrhoea (> 10%).

Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – after booster dose  
In a subset from Study 3, a total of 401 children 5 to 11 years of age received a booster dose of 
Comirnaty 10 mcg at least 5 months (range of 5 to 9 months) after completing the primary series. The 
analysis of the Study 3 Phase 2/3 subset is based on data up to the cut-off date of 22 March 2022 
(median follow-up time of 1.3 months). 
The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after the primary course. The 
most frequent adverse reactions in children 5 to 11 years of age were injection site pain (> 70%), 
fatigue (> 40%), headache (> 30%), myalgia, chills, injection site redness and swelling (> 10%). 
Adolescents 12 to 15 years of age – after 2 doses 
In an analysis of long-term safety follow-up in Study 2, 2 260 adolescents (1 131 Comirnaty and 
1 129 placebo) were 12 to 15 years of age. Of these, 1 559 adolescents (786 Comirnaty and 
773 placebo) have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the second dose. 
The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age was similar to that seen in 
participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in adolescents 12 to 
15 years of age that received 2 doses were injection site pain (> 90%), fatigue and headache (> 70%), 
myalgia and chills (> 40%), arthralgia and pyrexia (> 20%). 
Participants 16 years of age and older – after 2 doses 
In Study 2, a total of 22 026 participants 16 years of age or older received at least 1 dose of Comirnaty 
30 mcg and a total of 22 021 participants 16 years of age or older received placebo (including 138 and 
145 adolescents 16 and 17 years of age in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively). A total of 
20 519 participants 16 years of age or older received 2 doses of Comirnaty.  
At the time of the analysis of Study 2 with a data cut-off of 13 March 2021 for the placebo-controlled 
blinded follow-up period up to the participants’ unblinding dates, a total of 25 651 (58.2%) 
participants (13 031 Comirnaty and 12 620 placebo) 16 years of age and older were followed up for 
≥ 4 months after the second dose. This included a total of 15 111 (7 704 Comirnaty and 7 407 placebo) 
participants 16 to 55 years of age and a total of 10 540 (5 327 Comirnaty and 5 213 placebo) 
participants 56 years of age and older. 
The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 16 years of age and older that received 2 doses 
were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 50%), myalgia (> 40%), chills 
(> 30%), arthralgia (> 20%), pyrexia and injection site swelling (> 10%) and were usually mild or 
moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of 
reactogenicity events was associated with greater age. 
The safety profile in 545 participants 16 years of age and older receiving Comirnaty, that were 
seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, was similar to that seen in the general population. 
Participants 12 years of age and older – after booster dose 
A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 306 adults 18 to 55 years of age who completed the 
original Comirnaty 2-dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 6 months 
(range of 4.8 to 8.0 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, 
had a median follow-up time of 8.3 months (range 1.1 to 8.5 months) and 301 participants had been 
followed for ≥ 6 months after the booster dose to the cut-off date (22 November 2021). 
The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after 2 doses. The most frequent 
adverse reactions in participants 18 to 55 years of age were injection site pain (> 80%), 
fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 40%), myalgia (> 30%), chills and arthralgia (> 20%).  
In Study 4, a placebo-controlled booster study, participants 16 years of age and older recruited from 
Study 2 received a booster dose of Comirnaty (5 081 participants), or placebo (5 044 participants) at 
least 6 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, 
had a median follow-up time of 2.8 months (range 0.3 to 7.5 months) after the booster dose in the 
216 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
blinded placebo-controlled follow-up period to the cut-off date (8 February 2022). Of these, 
1 281 participants (895 Comirnaty and 386 placebo) have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the 
booster dose of Comirnaty. No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified. 
A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 825 adolescents 12 to 15 years of age who completed 
the original Comirnaty 2-dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 
11.2 months (range of 6.3 to 20.1 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a 
booster dose, had a median follow-up time of 9.5 months (range 1.5 to 10.7 months) based on data up 
to the cut-off date (3 November 2022). No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified. 
Booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine  
In 5 independent studies on the use of a Comirnaty booster dose in individuals who had completed 
primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose), no new 
safety issues were identified. 
Omicron-adapted Comirnaty 
Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – after the booster (fourth dose)  
In a subset from Study 6 (Phase 3), 113 participants 5 to 11 years of age who had completed 3 doses of 
Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (5/5 mcg) 2.6 to 
8.5 months after receiving Dose 3. Participants who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 had a median follow-up time of at least 1.6 months. 
The overall safety profile for the Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 booster (fourth dose) was 
similar to that seen after 3 doses. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 5 to 11 years of 
age were injection site pain (> 60%), fatigue (> 40%), headache (> 20%), and muscle pain (> 10%). 
Participants 12 years of age and older – after a booster dose of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 
(fourth dose) 
In a subset from Study 5 (Phase 2/3), 107 participants 12 to 17 years of age, 313 participants 18 to 
55 years of age and 306 participants 56 years of age and older who had completed 3 doses of 
Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (15/15 mcg) 5.4 
to 16.9 months after receiving Dose 3. Participants who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 had a median follow-up time of at least 1.5 months. 
The overall safety profile for the Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 booster (fourth dose) was 
similar to that seen after 3 doses. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 12 years of age

h. 
i.  Most cases appeared to be non-serious and temporary in nature. 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Myocarditis and pericarditis 
The increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty is highest in younger males (see 
section 4.4). 
Two large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have estimated the excess risk in younger 
males following the second dose of Comirnaty. One study showed that in a period of 7 days after the 
second dose there were about 0.265 (95% CI 0.255 – 0.275) extra cases of myocarditis in 12-29 year 
old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. In another study, in a period of 28 days after the 
second dose there were 0.56 (95% CI 0.37 – 0.74) extra cases of myocarditis in 16-24 year old males 
per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. 
218 
 
 
 
Limited data indicate that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty in 
children aged 5 to 11 years seems lower than in ages 12 to 17 years. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V and include batch/Lot number if available. 
4.9  Overdose 
Overdose data is available from 52 study participants included in the clinical trial that due to an error 
in dilution received 58 micrograms of Comirnaty. The vaccine recipients did not report an increase in 
reactogenicity or adverse reactions.  
In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is 
recommended. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BN01 
Mechanism of action 
The nucleoside-modified messenger RNA in Comirnaty is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which 
enable delivery of the non-replicating RNA into host cells to direct transient expression of the 
SARS-CoV-2 S antigen. The mRNA codes for membrane-anchored, full-length S with two point 
mutations within the central helix. Mutation of these two amino acids to proline locks S in an 
antigenically preferred prefusion conformation. The vaccine elicits both neutralizing antibody and 
cellular immune responses to the spike (S) antigen, which may contribute to protection against 
COVID-19. 
Efficacy 
Omicron-adapted Comirnaty 
Immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – after the booster 
(fourth dose) 
In an analysis of a subset from Study 6, 103 participants 5 to 11 years of age who had previously 
received a 2-dose primary series and booster dose with Comirnaty received a booster (fourth dose) of 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5. Results include immunogenicity data from a comparator subset 
of participants 5 to 11 years of age in Study 3 who received 3 doses of Comirnaty. In participants 5 to 
11 years of age who received a fourth dose of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 and participants 
5 to 11 years of age who received a third dose of Comirnaty, 57.3% and 58.4% were positive for 
SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, respectively. 
The immune response 1 month after a booster dose (fourth dose), Comirnaty Original/Omicron 
BA.4-5 elicited generally similar Omicron BA.4/BA.5-specific neutralizing titres compared with the 
titres in the comparator group who received 3 doses of Comirnaty. Comirnaty Original/Omicron 
BA.4-5 also elicited similar reference strain-specific titres compared with the titres in the comparator 
group.

Immunogenicity in participants 12 years of age and older – after the booster (fourth dose) 
In an analysis of a subset from Study 5, 105 participants 12 to 17 years of age, 297 participants 18 
through 55 years of age, and 286 participants 56 years of age and older who had previously received a 
2-dose primary series and booster dose with Comirnaty received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5. In participants 12 through 17 years of age, 18 through 55 years of age, and 
56 years of age and older, 75.2%, 71.7% and 61.5% were positive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, 
respectively. 
Analyses of 50% neutralizing antibody titres (NT50) against Omicron BA.4-5 and against reference 
strain among participants 56 years of age and older who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 in Study 5 compared to a subset of participants from Study 4 who received 
a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty demonstrated superiority of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 
to Comirnaty based on geometric mean ratio (GMR) and noninferiority based on difference in 
seroresponse rates with respect to anti-Omicron BA.4-5 response, and noninferiority of anti-reference 
strain immune response based on GMR (Table 3). 
Analyses of NT50 against Omicron BA.4/BA.5 among participants 18 through 55 years of age 
compared to participants 56 years of age and older who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 in Study 5 demonstrated noninferiority of anti-Omicron BA.4-5 response 
among participants 18 through 55 years of age compared to participants 56 years of age and older for 
both GMR and difference in seroresponse rates (Table 3).

Study 2 is a multicentre, multinational, Phase 1/2/3 randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind 
dose-finding, vaccine candidate selection and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. 
Randomisation was stratified by age: 12 to 15 years of age, 16 to 55 years of age, or 56 years of age 
and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the ≥ 56-year stratum. The study excluded 
participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological 
diagnosis of COVID-19. Participants with pre-existing stable disease, defined as disease not requiring 
significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before 
enrolment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV).

Efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older – after 2 doses 
In the Phase 2/3 portion of Study 2, based on data accrued through 14 November 2020, approximately 
44 000 participants were randomised equally and were to receive 2 doses of the initially approved 
COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine or placebo. The efficacy analyses included participants that received their 
second vaccination within 19 to 42 days after their first vaccination. The majority (93.1%) of vaccine 
recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Participants are planned to be 
followed for up to 24 months after Dose 2, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID-19. 
In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 14 days before and 
after administration of an influenza vaccine in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA 
Vaccine. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 60 days 
before or after receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins within through conclusion of the 
study in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine. 
The population for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included 36 621 participants 12 years 
of age and older (18 242 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 18 379 in the placebo group) 
who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 through 7 days after the second dose. 
In addition, 134 participants were between the ages of 16 to 17 years of age (66 in the COVID-19 
mRNA Vaccine group and 68 in the placebo group) and 1 616 participants 75 years of age and older 
(804 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 812 in the placebo group). 
At the time of the primary efficacy analysis, participants had been followed for symptomatic 
COVID-19 for in total 2 214 person-years for the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and in total 
2 222 person-years in the placebo group.  
There were no meaningful clinical differences in overall vaccine efficacy in participants who were at 
risk of severe COVID-19 including those with 1 or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe 
COVID-19 (e.g. asthma, body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes 
mellitus, hypertension).

Efficacy and immunogenicity in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age – after 2 doses 
In an initial analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (representing a median follow-up 
duration of > 2 months after Dose 2) without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 
1 005 participants who received the vaccine and 16 cases out of 978 who received placebo. The point 
estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 75.3, 100.0). In participants with or without 
evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 18 cases in 
1 110 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% 
(95% confidence interval 78.1, 100.0).  
Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additional confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued during 
blinded placebo-controlled follow-up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy 
population.  
In the updated efficacy analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age without evidence of 
prior infection, there were no cases in 1 057 participants who received the vaccine and 28 cases out of 
1 030 who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 86.8, 
100.0) during the period when Alpha variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants 
with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 
30 cases  in 1 109 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy 
is 100% (95% confidence interval 87.5, 100.0). 
In Study 2, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising titres 1 month after Dose 2 was conducted in a 
randomly selected subset of participants who had no serological or virological evidence of past 
SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, comparing the response in adolescents 12 to 
15 years of age (n = 190) to participants 16 to 25 years of age (n = 170).  
The ratio of the geometric mean titres (GMT) in the 12 to 15 years of age group to the 16 to 25 years 
of age group was 1.76, with a 2-sided 95% CI of 1.47 to 2.10. Therefore, the 1.5-fold noninferiority 
criterion was met as the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio [GMR] was 
> 0.67. 
Efficacy and immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – 
after 2 doses 
Study 3 is a Phase 1/2/3 study comprised of an open-label vaccine dose-finding portion (Phase 1) and 
a multicentre, multinational, randomised, saline placebo-controlled, observer-blind efficacy portion 
(Phase 2/3) that has enrolled participants 5 to 11 years of age. The majority (94.4%) of randomised 
vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. 
Initial descriptive vaccine efficacy results in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior 
SARS-CoV-2 infection are presented in Table 8. No cases of COVID-19 were observed in either the 
vaccine group or the placebo group in participants with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In the efficacy analysis of Study 3 in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior infection, 
there were 10 cases in 2 703 participants who received the vaccine and 42 cases out of 1 348 who 
received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 88.2% (95% confidence interval 76.2, 94.7) during 
the period when Delta variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants with or without 
evidence of prior infection there were 12 cases in the 3 018 who received vaccine and 42 cases in 
1 511 participants who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 85.7% (95% confidence 
interval 72.4, 93.2). 
In Study 3, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralising titres (NT50) 1 month after Dose 2 in a 
randomly selected subset of participants demonstrated effectiveness by immunobridging of immune 
responses comparing children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) in the Phase 2/3 
part of Study 3 to participants 16 to 25 years of age in the Phase 2/3 part of Study 2 who had no 
serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, meeting 
the prespecified immunobridging criteria for both the geometric mean ratio (GMR) and the 
seroresponse difference with seroresponse defined as achieving at least 4-fold rise in SARS-CoV-2 
NT50 from baseline (before Dose 1).

less than 12 years of age) to that of young adults 16 to 25 years of age was 1.04 (2-sided 95% CI: 0.93, 
1.18). Among participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after 
Dose 2, 99.2% of children 5 to 11 years of age and 99.2% of participants 16 to 25 years of age had a 
seroresponse at 1 month after Dose 2. The difference in proportions of participants who had 
seroresponse between the 2 age groups (children – young adult) was 0.0% (2-sided 95% CI: -2.0%, 
2.2%). This information is presented in Table 9.

Immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – after booster 
dose  
A booster dose of Comirnaty was given to 401 randomly selected participants in Study 3. 
Effectiveness of a booster dose in ages 5 to 11 is inferred by immunogenicity. The immunogenicity of 
this was assessed through NT50 against the reference strain of SARS-CoV-2 (USA_WA1/2020). 
Analyses of NT50 1 month after the booster dose compared to before the booster dose demonstrated a 
substantial increase in GMTs in individuals 5 through 11 years of age who had no serological or 
virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after the dose 2 and the booster 
dose. This analysis is summarized in Table 10.

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Comirnaty in the paediatric population in prevention of COVID-19 (see section 4.2 for information on 
paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Not applicable. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose 
toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity. 
General toxicity 
Rats intramuscularly administered Comirnaty (receiving 3 full human doses once weekly, generating 
relatively higher levels in rats due to body weight differences) demonstrated some injection site 
oedema and erythema and increases in white blood cells (including basophils and eosinophils) 
229 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
consistent with an inflammatory response as well as vacuolation of portal hepatocytes without 
evidence of liver injury. All effects were reversible. 
Genotoxicity/Carcinogenicity 
Neither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies were performed. The components of the vaccine (lipids 
and mRNA) are not expected to have genotoxic potential.  
Reproductive toxicity 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity were investigated in rats in a combined fertility and 
developmental toxicity study where female rats were intramuscularly administered Comirnaty prior to 
mating and during gestation (receiving 4 full human doses that generate relatively higher levels in rat 
due to body weight differences, spanning between pre-mating day 21 and gestational day 20). 
SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody responses were present in maternal animals from prior to mating 
to the end of the study on postnatal day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no 
vaccine-related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo-foetal or offspring development. No 
Comirnaty data are available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability  
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
General recommendations 
Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis 
Events of anaphylaxis have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should 
always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the 
vaccine.  
Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. No further dose of 
the vaccine should be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis after a prior dose of 
Comirnaty. 
Myocarditis and pericarditis 
There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Comirnaty. These 
conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 
14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger 
males (see section 4.8). Available data indicate that most cases recover. Some cases required intensive 
care support and fatal cases have been observed.  
Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. 
Vaccinees (including parents or caregivers) should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention 
if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest 
pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination. 
Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this 
condition. 
Anxiety-related reactions 
Anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress‐related 
reactions (e.g. dizziness, palpitations, increases in heart rate, alterations in blood pressure, 
paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia and sweating) may occur in association with the vaccination process itself. 
Stress-related reactions are temporary and resolve on their own. Individuals should be advised to bring 
symptoms to the attention of the vaccination provider for evaluation. It is important that precautions 
are in place to avoid injury from fainting. 
Concurrent illness 
Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute 
infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination. 
Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders 
As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals 
receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as 
haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in 
these individuals. 
Immunocompromised individuals 
The efficacy and safety of the vaccine has not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, 
including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 
may be lower in immunocompromised individuals. 
236 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Duration of protection 
The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by 
ongoing clinical trials. 
Limitations of vaccine effectiveness 
As with any vaccine, vaccination with Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 may not protect all vaccine 
recipients. Individuals may not be fully protected until 7 days after their vaccination. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
Concomitant administration of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 with other vaccines has not been studied. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 during pregnancy.  
However, a large amount of observational data from pregnant women vaccinated with the initially 
approved Comirnaty vaccine during the second and third trimester have not shown an increase in 
adverse pregnancy outcomes. While data on pregnancy outcomes following vaccination during the 
first trimester are presently limited, no increased risk for miscarriage has been seen. Animal studies do 
not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, 
parturition or post-natal development (see section 5.3). Based on data available with other vaccine 
variants, Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 can be used during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 during breast-feeding.  
However, no effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of 
breast-feeding woman to the vaccine is negligible. Observational data from women who were 
breast-feeding after vaccination with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine have not shown a risk 
for adverse effects in breastfed newborns/infants. Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 can be used during 
breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive 
or use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile 
The safety of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 is inferred from safety data of the prior Comirnaty 
vaccine.

In Study 3, a total of 3 109 children 5 to 11 years of age received at least 1 dose of the initially 
approved Comirnaty vaccine 10 mcg and a total of 1 538 children 5 to 11 years of age received 
placebo. At the time of the analysis of Study 3 Phase 2/3 with data up to the cut-off date of 20 May 
2022, 2 206 (1 481 Comirnaty 10 mcg and 725 placebo) children have been followed for ≥ 4 months 
after the second dose in the placebo-controlled blinded follow-up period. The safety evaluation in 
Study 3 is ongoing. 
The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in participants 5 to 11 years of age was similar to that seen in 
participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in children 5 to 11 years of 
age that received 2 doses were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 50%), headache (> 30%), 
injection site redness and swelling (≥ 20%), myalgia, chills, and diarrhoea (> 10%). 
Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – after booster dose  
In a subset from Study 3, a total of 401 children 5 to 11 years of age received a booster dose of 
Comirnaty 10 mcg at least 5 months (range of 5 to 9 months) after completing the primary series. The 
analysis of the Study 3 Phase 2/3 subset is based on data up to the cut-off date of 22 March 2022 
(median follow-up time of 1.3 months). 
The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after the primary course. The 
most frequent adverse reactions in children 5 to 11 years of age were injection site pain (> 70%), 
fatigue (> 40%), headache (> 30%), myalgia, chills, injection site redness and swelling (> 10%). 
Adolescents 12 to 15 years of age – after 2 doses 
In an analysis of long-term safety follow-up in Study 2, 2 260 adolescents (1 131 Comirnaty and 
1 129 placebo) were 12 to 15 years of age. Of these, 1 559 adolescents (786 Comirnaty and 
773 placebo) have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the second dose. 
The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age was similar to that seen in 
participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in adolescents 12 to 
15 years of age that received 2 doses were injection site pain (> 90%), fatigue and headache (> 70%), 
myalgia and chills (> 40%), arthralgia and pyrexia (> 20%). 
Participants 16 years of age and older – after 2 doses 
In Study 2, a total of 22 026 participants 16 years of age or older received at least 1 dose of Comirnaty 
30 mcg and a total of 22 021 participants 16 years of age or older received placebo (including 138 and 
145 adolescents 16 and 17 years of age in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively). A total of 
20 519 participants 16 years of age or older received 2 doses of Comirnaty.  
At the time of the analysis of Study 2 with a data cut-off of 13 March 2021 for the placebo-controlled 
blinded follow-up period up to the participants’ unblinding dates, a total of 25 651 (58.2%) 
participants (13 031 Comirnaty and 12 620 placebo) 16 years of age and older were followed up for 
≥ 4 months after the second dose. This included a total of 15 111 (7 704 Comirnaty and 7 407 placebo) 
participants 16 to 55 years of age and a total of 10 540 (5 327 Comirnaty and 5 213 placebo) 
participants 56 years of age and older. 
The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 16 years of age and older that received 2 doses 
were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 50%), myalgia (> 40%), chills 
(> 30%), arthralgia (> 20%), pyrexia and injection site swelling (> 10%) and were usually mild or 
moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of 
reactogenicity events was associated with greater age. 
The safety profile in 545 participants 16 years of age and older receiving Comirnaty, that were 
seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, was similar to that seen in the general population.

Participants 12 years of age and older – after booster dose 
A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 306 adults 18 to 55 years of age who completed the 
original Comirnaty 2-dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 6 months 
(range of 4.8 to 8.0 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, 
had a median follow-up time of 8.3 months (range 1.1 to 8.5 months) and 301 participants had been 
followed for ≥ 6 months after the booster dose to the cut-off date (22 November 2021). 
The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after 2 doses. The most frequent 
adverse reactions in participants 18 to 55 years of age were injection site pain (> 80%), 
fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 40%), myalgia (> 30%), chills and arthralgia (> 20%).  
In Study 4, a placebo-controlled booster study, participants 16 years of age and older recruited from 
Study 2 received a booster dose of Comirnaty (5 081 participants), or placebo (5 044 participants) at 
least 6 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, 
had a median follow-up time of 2.8 months (range 0.3 to 7.5 months) after the booster dose in the 
blinded placebo-controlled follow-up period to the cut-off date (8 February 2022). Of these, 
1 281 participants (895 Comirnaty and 386 placebo) have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the 
booster dose of Comirnaty. No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified. 
A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 825 adolescents 12 to 15 years of age who completed 
the original Comirnaty 2-dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 
11.2 months (range of 6.3 to 20.1 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a 
booster dose, had a median follow-up time of 9.5 months (range 1.5 to 10.7 months) based on data up 
to the cut-off date (3 November 2022). No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified. 
Booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Myocarditis and pericarditis 
The increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty is highest in younger males (see 
section 4.4). 
Two large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have estimated the excess risk in younger 
males following the second dose of Comirnaty. One study showed that in a period of 7 days after the 
second dose there were about 0.265 (95% CI 0.255 - 0.275) extra cases of myocarditis in 12-29 year 
old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. In another study, in a period of 28 days after the 
second dose there were 0.56 (95% CI 0.37 - 0.74) extra cases of myocarditis in 16-24 year old males 
per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. 
Limited data indicate that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty in 
children aged 5 to 11 years seems lower than in ages 12 to 17 years. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V and include batch/Lot number if available. 
4.9  Overdose 
Overdose data is available from 52 study participants included in the clinical trial that due to an error 
in dilution received 58 micrograms of Comirnaty. The vaccine recipients did not report an increase in 
reactogenicity or adverse reactions.  
In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is 
recommended.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BN01 
Mechanism of action 
The nucleoside-modified messenger RNA in Comirnaty is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which 
enable delivery of the non-replicating RNA into host cells to direct transient expression of the 
SARS-CoV-2 S antigen. The mRNA codes for membrane-anchored, full-length S with two point 
mutations within the central helix. Mutation of these two amino acids to proline locks S in an 
antigenically preferred prefusion conformation. The vaccine elicits both neutralizing antibody and 
cellular immune responses to the spike (S) antigen, which may contribute to protection against 
COVID-19. 
Efficacy 
Omicron-adapted Comirnaty 
Immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – after the booster 
(fourth dose) 
In an analysis of a subset from Study 6, 103 participants 5 to 11 years of age who had previously 
received a 2-dose primary series and booster dose with Comirnaty received a booster (fourth dose) of 
241 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5. Results include immunogenicity data from a comparator subset 
of participants 5 to 11 years of age in Study 3 who received 3 doses of Comirnaty. In participants 5 to 
11 years of age who received a fourth dose of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 and participants 
5 to 11 years of age who received a third dose of Comirnaty, 57.3% and 58.4% were positive for 
SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, respectively. 
The immune response 1 month after a booster dose (fourth dose), Comirnaty Original/Omicron 
BA.4-5 elicited generally similar Omicron BA.4/BA.5-specific neutralizing titres compared with the 
titres in the comparator group who received 3 doses of Comirnaty. Comirnaty Original/Omicron 
BA.4-5 also elicited similar reference strain-specific titres compared with the titres in the comparator 
group.  
The vaccine immunogenicity results after a booster dose in participants 5 to 11 years of age are 
presented in Table 2.

Immunogenicity in participants 12 years of age and older – after the booster (fourth dose) 
In an analysis of a subset from Study 5, 105 participants 12 to 17 years of age, 297 participants 18 
through 55 years of age, and 286 participants 56 years of age and older who had previously received a 
2-dose primary series and booster dose with Comirnaty received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5. In participants 12 through 17 years of age, 18 through 55 years of age, and 
56 years of age and older, 75.2%, 71.7% and 61.5% were positive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline,

Analyses of 50% neutralizing antibody titres (NT50) against Omicron BA.4-5 and against reference 
strain among participants 56 years of age and older who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 in Study 5 compared to a subset of participants from Study 4 who received 
a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty demonstrated superiority of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 
to Comirnaty based on geometric mean ratio (GMR) and noninferiority based on difference in 
seroresponse rates with respect to anti-Omicron BA.4-5 response, and noninferiority of anti-reference 
strain immune response based on GMR (Table 3). 
Analyses of NT50 against Omicron BA.4/BA.5 among participants 18 through 55 years of age 
compared to participants 56 years of age and older who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 in Study 5 demonstrated noninferiority of anti-Omicron BA.4-5 response 
among participants 18 through 55 years of age compared to participants 56 years of age and older for 
both GMR and difference in seroresponse rates (Table 3). 
The study also assessed the level of NT50 of the anti-Omicron BA.4-5 SARS-CoV-2 and reference 
strains pre-vaccination and 1 month after vaccination in participants who received a booster (fourth 
dose) (Table 4).

Study 2 is a multicentre, multinational, Phase 1/2/3 randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind 
dose-finding, vaccine candidate selection and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. 
Randomisation was stratified by age: 12 to 15 years of age, 16 to 55 years of age, or 56 years of age 
and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the ≥ 56-year stratum. The study excluded 
participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological 
diagnosis of COVID-19. Participants with pre-existing stable disease, defined as disease not requiring 
significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before 
enrolment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV).  
Efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older – after 2 doses 
In the Phase 2/3 portion of Study 2, based on data accrued through 14 November 2020, approximately 
44 000 participants were randomised equally and were to receive 2 doses of the initially approved 
COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine or placebo. The efficacy analyses included participants that received their 
second vaccination within 19 to 42 days after their first vaccination. The majority (93.1%) of vaccine 
recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Participants are planned to be 
followed for up to 24 months after Dose 2, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID-19. 
In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 14 days before and 
after administration of an influenza vaccine in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA 
Vaccine. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 60 days 
before or after receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins within through conclusion of the 
study in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine. 
The population for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included 36 621 participants 12 years 
of age and older (18 242 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 18 379 in the placebo group) 
who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 through 7 days after the second dose. 
In addition, 134 participants were between the ages of 16 to 17 years of age (66 in the COVID-19 
245 
 
 
 
 
mRNA Vaccine group and 68 in the placebo group) and 1 616 participants 75 years of age and older 
(804 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 812 in the placebo group). 
At the time of the primary efficacy analysis, participants had been followed for symptomatic 
COVID-19 for in total 2 214 person-years for the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and in total 
2 222 person-years in the placebo group.  
There were no meaningful clinical differences in overall vaccine efficacy in participants who were at 
risk of severe COVID-19 including those with 1 or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe 
COVID-19 (e.g. asthma, body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes 
mellitus, hypertension).

Efficacy against severe COVID-19  
Updated efficacy analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints supported benefit of the COVID-19 mRNA 
Vaccine in preventing severe COVID‑19. 
As of 13 March 2021, vaccine efficacy against severe COVID-19 is presented only for participants 
with or without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 7) as the COVID-19 case counts in participants 
without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection were the same as those in participants with or without prior 
SARS-CoV-2 infection in both the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and placebo groups.

Efficacy and immunogenicity in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age – after 2 doses   
In an initial analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (representing a median follow-up 
duration of > 2 months after Dose 2) without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 
1 005 participants who received the vaccine and 16 cases out of 978 who received placebo. The point 
248 
 
 
 
 
 
estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 75.3, 100.0). In participants with or without 
evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 18 cases in 
1 110 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% 
(95% confidence interval 78.1, 100.0).  
Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additional confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued during 
blinded placebo-controlled follow-up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy 
population.  
In the updated efficacy analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age without evidence of 
prior infection, there were no cases in 1 057 participants who received the vaccine and 28 cases out of 
1 030 who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 86.8, 
100.0) during the period when Alpha variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants 
with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 
30 cases  in 1 109 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy 
is 100% (95% confidence interval 87.5, 100.0). 
In Study 2, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising titres 1 month after Dose 2 was conducted in a 
randomly selected subset of participants who had no serological or virological evidence of past 
SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, comparing the response in adolescents 12 to 
15 years of age (n = 190) to participants 16 to 25 years of age (n = 170).  
The ratio of the geometric mean titres (GMT) in the 12 to 15 years of age group to the 16 to 25 years 
of age group was 1.76, with a 2-sided 95% CI of 1.47 to 2.10. Therefore, the 1.5-fold noninferiority 
criterion was met as the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio [GMR] was 
> 0.67. 
Efficacy and immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – 
after 2 doses 
Study 3 is a Phase 1/2/3 study comprised of an open-label vaccine dose-finding portion (Phase 1) and 
a multicentre, multinational, randomised, saline placebo-controlled, observer-blind efficacy portion 
(Phase 2/3) that has enrolled participants 5 to 11 years of age. The majority (94.4%) of randomised 
vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. 
Initial descriptive vaccine efficacy results in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior 
SARS-CoV-2 infection are presented in Table 8. No cases of COVID-19 were observed in either the 
vaccine group or the placebo group in participants with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Pre-specified hypothesis-driven efficacy analysis was performed with additional confirmed 
COVID-19 cases accrued during blinded placebo-controlled follow-up, representing up to 6 months 
after Dose 2 in the efficacy population.  
In the efficacy analysis of Study 3 in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior infection, 
there were 10 cases in 2 703 participants who received the vaccine and 42 cases out of 1 348 who 
received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 88.2% (95% confidence interval 76.2, 94.7) during 
the period when Delta variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants with or without 
evidence of prior infection there were 12 cases in the 3 018 who received vaccine and 42 cases in 
1 511 participants who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 85.7% (95% confidence 
interval 72.4, 93.2). 
In Study 3, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralising titres (NT50) 1 month after Dose 2 in a 
randomly selected subset of participants demonstrated effectiveness by immunobridging of immune 
responses comparing children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) in the Phase 2/3 
part of Study 3 to participants 16 to 25 years of age in the Phase 2/3 part of Study 2 who had no 
serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, meeting 
the prespecified immunobridging criteria for both the geometric mean ratio (GMR) and the 
seroresponse difference with seroresponse defined as achieving at least 4-fold rise in SARS-CoV-2 
NT50 from baseline (before Dose 1).  
The GMR of the SARS-CoV-2 NT50 1 month after Dose 2 in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to 
less than 12 years of age) to that of young adults 16 to 25 years of age was 1.04 (2-sided 95% CI: 0.93, 
1.18). Among participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after 
Dose 2, 99.2% of children 5 to 11 years of age and 99.2% of participants 16 to 25 years of age had a 
seroresponse at 1 month after Dose 2. The difference in proportions of participants who had 
seroresponse between the 2 age groups (children – young adult) was 0.0% (2-sided 95% CI: -2.0%,

Immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – after booster 
dose  
A booster dose of Comirnaty was given to 401 randomly selected participants in Study 3. 
Effectiveness of a booster dose in ages 5 to 11 is inferred by immunogenicity. The immunogenicity of 
this was assessed through NT50 against the reference strain of SARS-CoV-2 (USA_WA1/2020). 
Analyses of NT50 1 month after the booster dose compared to before the booster dose demonstrated a 
substantial increase in GMTs in individuals 5 through 11 years of age who had no serological or 
virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after the dose 2 and the booster 
dose. This analysis is summarized in Table 10.

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Comirnaty in the paediatric population in prevention of COVID-19 (see section 4.2 for information on 
paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Not applicable. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose 
toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity. 
General toxicity 
Rats intramuscularly administered Comirnaty (receiving 3 full human doses once weekly, generating 
relatively higher levels in rats due to body weight differences) demonstrated some injection site 
oedema and erythema and increases in white blood cells (including basophils and eosinophils) 
consistent with an inflammatory response as well as vacuolation of portal hepatocytes without 
evidence of liver injury. All effects were reversible. 
Genotoxicity/Carcinogenicity 
Neither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies were performed. The components of the vaccine (lipids 
and mRNA) are not expected to have genotoxic potential.  
252 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reproductive toxicity 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity were investigated in rats in a combined fertility and 
developmental toxicity study where female rats were intramuscularly administered Comirnaty prior to 
mating and during gestation (receiving 4 full human doses that generate relatively higher levels in rat 
due to body weight differences, spanning between pre-mating day 21 and gestational day 20). 
SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody responses were present in maternal animals from prior to mating 
to the end of the study on postnatal day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no 
vaccine-related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo-foetal or offspring development. No 
Comirnaty data are available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 3 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is indicated 
for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, in infants and children aged 
6 months to 4 years.  
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Infants and children 6 months to 4 years of age without history of completion of a COVID-19 primary 
course or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection 
Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 3 micrograms/dose is administered intramuscularly after dilution as a 
primary course of 3 doses (0.2 mL each). It is recommended to administer the second dose 3 weeks 
after the first dose followed by a third dose administered at least 8 weeks after the second dose (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
If a child turns 5 years old between their doses in the primary course, he/she should complete the 
primary course at the same 3 micrograms dose level.

Infants and children 6 months to 4 years of age with history of completion of a COVID-19 primary 
course or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection 
Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 3 micrograms/dose is administered intramuscularly after dilution as a 
single dose of 0.2 mL for infants and children 6 months to 4 years of age. 
For individuals who have previously been vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty Omicron 
XBB.1.5 should be administered at least 3 months after the most recent dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.  
Severely immunocompromised aged 6 months to 4 years 
Additional doses may be administered to individuals who are severely immunocompromised in 
accordance with national recommendations (see section 4.4). 
Interchangeability  
The primary course may consist of either Comirnaty, Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5, or 
Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 (or a combination) but not exceeding the total number of doses required 
as primary course. The primary course should only be administered once.  
The interchangeability of Comirnaty with COVID-19 vaccines from other manufacturers has not been 
established.  
Paediatric population 
There are paediatric formulations available for children 5 to 11 years of age. For details, please refer to 
the Summary of Product Characteristics for other formulations. 
The safety and efficacy of the vaccine in infants aged less than 6 months have not yet been 
established.  
Method of administration 
Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 3 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection should be 
administered intramuscularly after dilution (see section 6.6).  
After dilution, vials of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 contain 10 doses of 0.2 mL of vaccine. In order 
to extract 10 doses from a single vial, low dead-volume syringes and/or needles should be used. The 
low dead-volume syringe and needle combination should have a dead volume of no more than 
35 microlitres. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract 
10 doses from a single vial. Irrespective of the type of syringe and needle: 
• 
• 
Each dose must contain 0.2 mL of vaccine. 
If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.2 mL, discard the 
vial and any excess volume.  
Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials. 
• 
In infants from 6 to less than 12 months of age, the recommended injection site is the anterolateral 
aspect of the thigh. In individuals 1 year of age and older, the recommended injection site is the 
anterolateral aspect of the thigh or the deltoid muscle. 
Do not inject the vaccine intravascularly, subcutaneously or intradermally.  
The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products. 
For precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4. 
For instructions regarding thawing, handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6.

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability  
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
General recommendations 
Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis 
Events of anaphylaxis have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should 
always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the 
vaccine.  
Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. No further dose of 
the vaccine should be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis after a prior dose of 
Comirnaty. 
Myocarditis and pericarditis 
There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Comirnaty. These 
conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 
14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger 
males (see section 4.8). Available data indicate that most cases recover. Some cases required intensive 
care support and fatal cases have been observed.  
Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. 
Vaccinees (including parents or caregivers) should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention 
if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest 
pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination. 
Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this 
condition. 
Anxiety-related reactions 
Anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress‐related 
reactions (e.g. dizziness, palpitations, increases in heart rate, alterations in blood pressure, 
paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia and sweating) may occur in association with the vaccination process itself. 
Stress-related reactions are temporary and resolve on their own. Individuals should be advised to bring 
symptoms to the attention of the vaccination provider for evaluation. It is important that precautions 
are in place to avoid injury from fainting. 
Concurrent illness 
Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute 
infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination. 
Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders 
As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals 
receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as 
haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in 
these individuals. 
259 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Immunocompromised individuals 
The efficacy and safety of the vaccine has not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, 
including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 
may be lower in immunocompromised individuals. 
Duration of protection 
The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by 
ongoing clinical trials. 
Limitations of vaccine effectiveness 
As with any vaccine, vaccination with Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 may not protect all vaccine 
recipients. Individuals may not be fully protected until 7 days after their vaccination. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
Concomitant administration of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 with other vaccines has not been studied. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 3 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is not 
intended for individuals older than 5 years of age.  
For details for use in individuals older than 5 years of age, please refer to the Summary of Product 
Characteristics for those formulations. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive, cycle, and use 
machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the 
ability to drive, cycle, or use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile 
The safety of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 is inferred from safety data of the prior Comirnaty 
vaccines.  
Comirnaty  
Infants 6 to 23 months of age – after 3 doses 
In an analysis of Study 3 (Phase 2/3), 1 776 infants (1 178 initially approved Comirnaty 3 mcg and 
598 placebo) were 6 to 23 months of age. Based on data in the blinded placebo-controlled follow-up 
period up to the cut-off date of 29 April 2022, 570 infants 6 to 23 months of age who received a 
3-dose primary course (386 Comirnaty 3 mcg and 184 placebo) have been followed for a median of 
1.3 months after the third dose. 
The most frequent adverse reactions in infants 6 to 23 months of age that received any primary course 
dose included irritability (> 60%), drowsiness (> 40%), decreased appetite (> 30%), tenderness at the 
injection site (> 20%), injection site redness and fever (> 10%). 
Children 2 to 4 years of age – after 3 doses 
In an analysis of Study 3 (Phase 2/3), 2 750 children (1 835 Comirnaty 3 mcg and 915 placebo) were 
2 to 4 years of age. Based on data in the blinded placebo-controlled follow-up period up to the cut-off 
date of 29 April 2022, 886 children 2 to 4 years of age who received a 3-dose primary course

(606 Comirnaty 3 mcg and 280 placebo) have been followed a median of 1.4 months after the third 
dose. 
The most frequent adverse reactions in children 2 to 4 years of age that received any primary course 
dose included pain at injection site and fatigue (> 40%), injection site redness and fever (> 10%). 
Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – after 2 doses 
In Study 3, a total of 3 109 children 5 to 11 years of age received at least 1 dose of Comirnaty 10 mcg 
and a total of 1 538 children 5 to 11 years of age received placebo. At the time of the analysis of 
Study 3 Phase 2/3 with data up to the cut-off date of 20 May 2022, 2 206 (1 481 Comirnaty 10 mcg 
and 725 placebo) children have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the second dose in the 
placebo-controlled blinded follow-up period. The safety evaluation in Study 3 is ongoing. 
The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in participants 5 to 11 years of age was similar to that seen in 
participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in children 5 to 11 years of 
age that received 2 doses were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 50%), headache (> 30%), 
injection site redness and swelling (≥ 20%), myalgia, chills and diarrhoea (> 10%). 
Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – after booster dose  
In a subset from Study 3, a total of 401 children 5 to 11 years of age received a booster dose of 
Comirnaty 10 mcg at least 5 months (range of 5 to 9 months) after completing the primary series. The 
analysis of the Study 3 Phase 2/3 subset is based on data up to the cut-off date of 22 March 2022 
(median follow-up time of 1.3 months). 
The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after the primary course. The 
most frequent adverse reactions in children 5 to 11 years of age were injection site pain (> 70%), 
fatigue (> 40%), headache (> 30%), myalgia, chills, injection site redness and swelling (> 10%). 
Adolescents 12 to 15 years of age – after 2 doses 
In an analysis of long-term safety follow-up in Study 2, 2 260 adolescents (1 131 Comirnaty and 
1 129 placebo) were 12 to 15 years of age. Of these, 1 559 adolescents (786 Comirnaty and 
773 placebo) have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the second dose. 
The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age was similar to that seen in 
participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in adolescents 12 to 
15 years of age that received 2 doses were injection site pain (> 90%), fatigue and headache (> 70%),

30 mcg and a total of 22 021 participants 16 years of age or older received placebo (including 138 and 
145 adolescents 16 and 17 years of age in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively). A total of 
20 519 participants 16 years of age or older received 2 doses of Comirnaty.  
At the time of the analysis of Study 2 with a data cut-off of 13 March 2021 for the placebo-controlled 
blinded follow-up period up to the participants’ unblinding dates, a total of 25 651 (58.2%) 
participants (13 031 Comirnaty and 12 620 placebo) 16 years of age and older were followed up for 
≥ 4 months after the second dose. This included a total of 15 111 (7 704 Comirnaty and 7 407 placebo) 
participants 16 to 55 years of age and a total of 10 540 (5 327 Comirnaty and 5 213 placebo) 
participants 56 years of age and older. 
The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 16 years of age and older that received 2 doses 
were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 50%), myalgia (> 40%), chills 
(> 30%), arthralgia (> 20%), pyrexia and injection site swelling (> 10%) and were usually mild or 
moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of 
reactogenicity events was associated with greater age.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Myocarditis and pericarditis 
The increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty is highest in younger males (see 
section 4.4). 
Two large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have estimated the excess risk in younger 
males following the second dose of Comirnaty. One study showed that in a period of 7 days after the 
second dose there were about 0.265 (95% CI 0.255 - 0.275) extra cases of myocarditis in 12-29 year 
old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. In another study, in a period of 28 days after the 
second dose there were 0.56 (95% CI 0.37 - 0.74) extra cases of myocarditis in 16-24 year old males 
per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. 
Limited data indicate that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty in 
children aged 5 to 11 years seems lower than in ages 12 to 17 years. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V and include batch/Lot number if available. 
4.9  Overdose 
Overdose data is available from 52 study participants included in the clinical trial that due to an error 
in dilution received 58 micrograms of Comirnaty. The vaccine recipients did not report an increase in 
reactogenicity or adverse reactions.  
In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is 
recommended.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BN01 
Mechanism of action 
The nucleoside-modified messenger RNA in Comirnaty is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which 
enable delivery of the non-replicating RNA into host cells to direct transient expression of the 
SARS-CoV-2 S antigen. The mRNA codes for membrane-anchored, full-length S with two point 
mutations within the central helix. Mutation of these two amino acids to proline locks S in an 
antigenically preferred prefusion conformation. The vaccine elicits both neutralizing antibody and 
cellular immune responses to the spike (S) antigen, which may contribute to protection against 
COVID-19. 
Efficacy 
Omicron-adapted Comirnaty 
Immunogenicity in infants and children 6 months to 4 years of age – after the booster (fourth dose) 
In an analysis of a subset from Study 6, 60 participants 6 months to 4 years of age received a booster 
(fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (1.5/1.5 mcg) after receiving 3 prior doses of 
Comirnaty 3 micrograms dose concentrate for dispersion. Results include immunogenicity data from a 
comparator subset of participants 6 months to 4 years of age in Study 3 who received 3 doses of 
Comirnaty 3 micrograms dose concentrate for dispersion.  
At 1 month after a booster dose (fourth dose), a booster dose with Comirnaty Original/Omicron 
BA.4-5 (1.5/1.5 mcg) elicited higher Omicron BA.4-5 specific neutralizing titres (regardless of 
baseline SARS-CoV-2 status) compared with the titres in the comparator group who received 3 doses 
of Comirnaty 3 micrograms dose concentrate for dispersion. Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 
(1.5/1.5 mcg) also elicited similar reference strain-specific titres compared with the titres in the 
comparator group.  
The vaccine immunogenicity results after a booster dose in participants 6 months to 4 years of age are 
presented in Table 2.

Immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – after the booster 
(fourth dose) 
In an analysis of a subset from Study 6, 103 participants 5 to 11 years of age who had previously 
received a 2-dose primary series and booster dose with Comirnaty received a booster (fourth dose) of 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5. Results include immunogenicity data from a comparator subset 
of participants 5 to 11 years of age in Study 3 who received 3 doses of Comirnaty. In participants 5 to 
11 years of age who received a fourth dose of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 and participants 5 
to 11 years of age who received a third dose of Comirnaty, 57.3% and 58.4% were positive for 
SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, respectively. 
The immune response 1 month after a booster dose (fourth dose), Comirnaty Original/Omicron 
BA.4-5 elicited generally similar Omicron BA.4/BA.5-specific neutralizing titres compared with the 
titres in the comparator group who received 3 doses of Comirnaty. Comirnaty Original/Omicron 
BA.4-5 also elicited similar reference strain-specific titres compared with the titres in the comparator 
group.

Immunogenicity in participants 12 years of age and older – after the booster (fourth dose) 
In an analysis of a subset from Study 5, 105 participants 12 to 17 years of age, 297 participants 18 to 
55 years of age, and 286 participants 56 years of age and older who had previously received a 2-dose 
primary series and booster dose with Comirnaty received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5. In participants 12 through 17 years of age, 18 through 55 years of age, and 
56 years of age and older, 75.2%, 71.7% and 61.5% were positive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, 
respectively. 
Analyses of 50% neutralizing antibody titres (NT50) against Omicron BA.4-5 and against reference

Original/Omicron BA.4-5 in Study 5 compared to a subset of participants from Study 4 who received 
a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty demonstrated superiority of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 
to Comirnaty based on geometric mean ratio (GMR) and noninferiority based on difference in 
seroresponse rates with respect to anti-Omicron BA.4-5 response, and noninferiority of anti-reference 
strain immune response based on GMR (Table 4).  
Analyses of NT50 against Omicron BA.4/BA.5 among participants 18 through 55 years of age 
compared to participants 56 years of age and older who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 in Study 5 demonstrated noninferiority of anti-Omicron BA.4-5 response 
among participants 18 through 55 years of age compared to participants 56 years of age and older for 
both GMR and difference in seroresponse rates (Table 4). 
The study also assessed the level of NT50 of the anti-Omicron BA.4-5 SARS-CoV-2 and reference 
strains pre-vaccination and 1 month after vaccination in participants who received a booster (fourth 
dose) (Table 5).

Study 2 is a multicentre, multinational, Phase 1/2/3 randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind 
dose-finding, vaccine candidate selection and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. 
Randomisation was stratified by age: 12 to 15 years of age, 16 to 55 years of age, or 56 years of age 
and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the ≥ 56-year stratum. The study excluded 
participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological 
diagnosis of COVID-19. Participants with pre-existing stable disease, defined as disease not requiring 
significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before 
enrolment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV).  
Efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older – after 2 doses 
In the Phase 2/3 portion of Study 2, based on data accrued through 14 November 2020, approximately 
44 000 participants were randomised equally and were to receive 2 doses of the initially approved 
COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine or placebo. The efficacy analyses included participants that received their 
second vaccination within 19 to 42 days after their first vaccination. The majority (93.1%) of vaccine 
recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Participants are planned to be 
followed for up to 24 months after Dose 2, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID-19. 
In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 14 days before and 
after administration of an influenza vaccine in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA 
Vaccine. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 60 days 
before or after receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins within through conclusion of the 
study in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine. 
The population for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included 36 621 participants 12 years 
of age and older (18 242 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 18 379 in the placebo group) 
who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 through 7 days after the second dose. 
In addition, 134 participants were between the ages of 16 to 17 years of age (66 in the COVID-19 
269 
 
 
 
mRNA Vaccine group and 68 in the placebo group) and 1 616 participants 75 years of age and older 
(804 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 812 in the placebo group). 
At the time of the primary efficacy analysis, participants had been followed for symptomatic 
COVID-19 for in total 2 214 person-years for the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and in total 
2 222 person-years in the placebo group.  
There were no meaningful clinical differences in overall vaccine efficacy in participants who were at 
risk of severe COVID-19 including those with 1 or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe 
COVID-19 (e.g. asthma, body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes 
mellitus, hypertension).

Efficacy against severe COVID-19  
Updated efficacy analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints supported benefit of the COVID-19 mRNA 
Vaccine in preventing severe COVID‑19. 
As of 13 March 2021, vaccine efficacy against severe COVID-19 is presented only for participants 
with or without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 8) as the COVID-19 case counts in participants 
without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection were the same as those in participants with or without prior 
SARS-CoV-2 infection in both the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and placebo groups.

Efficacy and immunogenicity in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age – after 2 doses 
In an initial analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (representing a median follow-up 
duration of > 2 months after Dose 2) without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 
1 005 participants who received the vaccine and 16 cases out of 978 who received placebo. The point 
estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 75.3, 100.0). In participants with or without 
272 
 
 
 
 
 
evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 18 cases in 
1 110 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% 
(95% confidence interval 78.1, 100.0).  
Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additional confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued during 
blinded placebo-controlled follow-up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy 
population.  
In the updated efficacy analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age without evidence of 
prior infection, there were no cases in 1 057 participants who received the vaccine and 28 cases out of 
1 030 who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 86.8, 
100.0) during the period when Alpha variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants 
with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 
30 cases  in 1 109 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy 
is 100% (95% confidence interval 87.5, 100.0). 
In Study 2, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising titres 1 month after Dose 2 was conducted in a 
randomly selected subset of participants who had no serological or virological evidence of past 
SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, comparing the response in adolescents 12 to 
15 years of age (n = 190) to participants 16 to 25 years of age (n = 170).  
The ratio of the geometric mean titres (GMT) in the 12 to 15 years of age group to the 16 to 25 years 
of age group was 1.76, with a 2-sided 95% CI of 1.47 to 2.10. Therefore, the 1.5-fold noninferiority 
criterion was met as the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio [GMR] was 
> 0.67. 
Efficacy and immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – 
after 2 doses 
Study 3 is a Phase 1/2/3 study comprised of an open-label vaccine dose-finding portion (Phase 1) and 
a multicentre, multinational, randomised, saline placebo-controlled, observer-blind efficacy portion 
(Phase 2/3) that has enrolled participants 5 to 11 years of age. The majority (94.4%) of randomised 
vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. 
Initial descriptive vaccine efficacy results in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior 
SARS-CoV-2 infection are presented in Table 9. No cases of COVID-19 were observed in either the 
vaccine group or the placebo group in participants with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.

d.  n2 = Number of participants at risk for the endpoint. 
Pre-specified hypothesis-driven efficacy analysis was performed with additional confirmed 
COVID-19 cases accrued during blinded placebo-controlled follow-up, representing up to 6 months 
after Dose 2 in the efficacy population.  
In the efficacy analysis of Study 3 in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior infection, 
there were 10 cases in 2 703 participants who received the vaccine and 42 cases out of 1 348 who 
received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 88.2% (95% confidence interval 76.2, 94.7) during 
the period when Delta variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants with or without 
evidence of prior infection there were 12 cases in the 3 018 who received vaccine and 42 cases in 
1 511 participants who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 85.7% (95% confidence 
interval 72.4, 93.2). 
In Study 3, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralising titres (NT50) 1 month after Dose 2 in a 
randomly selected subset of participants demonstrated effectiveness by immunobridging of immune 
responses comparing children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) in the Phase 2/3 
part of Study 3 to participants 16 to 25 years of age in the Phase 2/3 part of Study 2 who had no 
serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, meeting 
the prespecified immunobridging criteria for both the geometric mean ratio (GMR) and the 
seroresponse difference with seroresponse defined as achieving at least 4-fold rise in SARS-CoV-2 
NT50 from baseline (before Dose 1).  
The GMR of the SARS-CoV-2 NT50 1 month after Dose 2 in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to 
less than 12 years of age) to that of young adults 16 to 25 years of age was 1.04 (2-sided 95% CI: 0.93, 
1.18). Among participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after 
Dose 2, 99.2% of children 5 to 11 years of age and 99.2% of participants 16 to 25 years of age had a 
seroresponse at 1 month after Dose 2. The difference in proportions of participants who had 
seroresponse between the 2 age groups (children – young adult) was 0.0% (2-sided 95% CI: -2.0%, 
2.2%). This information is presented in Table 10.

Immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – after booster 
dose  
A booster dose of Comirnaty was given to 401 randomly selected participants in Study 3. 
Effectiveness of a booster dose in ages 5 to 11 is inferred by immunogenicity. The immunogenicity of 
this was assessed through NT50 against the reference strain of SARS-CoV-2 (USA_WA1/2020). 
Analyses of NT50 1 month after the booster dose compared to before the booster dose demonstrated a 
substantial increase in GMTs in individuals 5 through 11 years of age who had no serological or 
virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after the dose 2 and the booster 
dose. This analysis is summarized in Table 11.

Efficacy and immunogenicity of a 3-dose primary course in infants and children 6 months to 4 years of 
age 
The efficacy analysis of Study 3 was performed across the combined population of participants 
6 months through 4 years of age based on cases confirmed among 873 participants in the COVID-19 
mRNA Vaccine group and 381 participants in the placebo group (2:1 randomization ratio) who 
received all 3 doses of study intervention during the blinded follow-up period when the Omicron 
variant of SARS-CoV-2 (BA.2) was the predominant variant in circulation (data cut-off date of 
17 June 2022).

Vaccine efficacy in participants with or without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was similar to those 
participants without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
Severe COVID-19 criteria (as described in the protocol, based on FDA definition and modified for 
children) were fulfilled for 12 cases (8 COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and 4 placebo) among participants 
6 months to 4 years of age. Among participants 6 months through 23 months of age, severe 
COVID-19 criteria were fulfilled for 3 cases (2 COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and 1 placebo).  
Immunogenicity analyses have been performed in the immunobridging subset of 82 Study 3 
participants 6 to 23 months of age and 143 Study 3 participants 2 to 4 years of age without evidence of 
infection up to 1 month after Dose 3 based on a data cut-off date of 29 April 2022.  
SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralising antibody titres (NT50) were compared between an immunogenicity 
subset of Phase 2/3 participants 6 to 23 months of age and 2 to 4 years of age from Study 3 at 1 month 
after the 3-dose primary course and a randomly selected subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants 16 
to 25 years of age at 1 month after the 2-dose primary course, using a microneutralisation assay 
against the reference strain (USA_WA1/2020).  
The primary immunobridging analyses compared the geometric mean titres (using a geometric mean 
ratio [GMR]) and the seroresponse (defined as achieving at least 4-fold rise in SARS-CoV-2 NT50 
from before Dose 1) rates in the evaluable immunogenicity population of participants without 
evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 3 in participants 6 to 23 months of 
age and 2 to 4 years of age and up to 1 month after Dose 2 in participants 16 to 25 years of age. The 
prespecified immunobridging criteria were met for both the GMR and the seroresponse difference for 
both age groups (Table 13).

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Comirnaty in the paediatric population in prevention of COVID-19 (see section 4.2 for information on 
paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Not applicable. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose 
toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity. 
General toxicity 
Rats intramuscularly administered Comirnaty (receiving 3 full human doses once weekly, generating 
relatively higher levels in rats due to body weight differences) demonstrated some injection site 
oedema and erythema and increases in white blood cells (including basophils and eosinophils) 
consistent with an inflammatory response as well as vacuolation of portal hepatocytes without 
evidence of liver injury. All effects were reversible. 
Genotoxicity/Carcinogenicity 
Neither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies were performed. The components of the vaccine (lipids 
and mRNA) are not expected to have genotoxic potential.  
Reproductive toxicity 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity were investigated in rats in a combined fertility and 
developmental toxicity study where female rats were intramuscularly administered Comirnaty prior to 
mating and during gestation (receiving 4 full human doses that generate relatively higher levels in rat 
due to body weight differences, spanning between pre-mating day 21 and gestational day 20). 
SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody responses were present in maternal animals from prior to mating 
to the end of the study on postnatal day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no 
vaccine-related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo-foetal or offspring development. No 
Comirnaty data are available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk.

30 °C. 
Thawed vials can be handled in room light conditions. 
Once thawed, the vaccine should not be re-frozen. 
Handling of temperature excursions during refrigerated storage 
• 
Stability data indicate that the unopened vial is stable for up to 10 weeks when stored at 
temperatures from -2 °C to 2 °C, and within the 10 weeks storage period between 2 °C and 
8 °C. 
Stability data indicate the vial can be stored for up to 24 hours at temperatures of 8 °C to 30 °C,

Diluted medicinal product 
Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 12 hours at 2 ºC to 30 ºC, after 
dilution with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection, which includes up to 6 hours 
transportation time. From a microbiological point of view, unless the method of dilution precludes the 
risk of microbial contamination, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, 
in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user. 
6.4  Special precautions for storage 
Store in a freezer at -90 °C to -60 °C. 
Store in the original package in order to protect from light. 
During storage, minimise exposure to room light, and avoid exposure to direct sunlight and ultraviolet 
light.  
For storage conditions after thawing and dilution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3.  
6.5  Nature and contents of container 
0.4 mL concentrate for dispersion in a 2 mL clear multidose vial (type I glass) with a stopper 
(synthetic bromobutyl rubber) and a maroon flip-off plastic cap with aluminium seal. Each vial 
contains 10 doses, see section 6.6. 
Pack size: 10 vials 
6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
Handling instructions prior to use 
Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 should be prepared by a healthcare professional using aseptic technique 
to ensure the sterility of the prepared dispersion. 
• 
Verify that the vial has a maroon plastic cap and the product name is Comirnaty Omicron 
XBB.1.5 (3 micrograms)/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection (infants and children 
6 months to 4 years).  
If the vial has another product name on the label, please make reference to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics for that formulation. 
If the vial is stored frozen it must be thawed prior to use. Frozen vials should be transferred to 
an environment of 2 °C to 8 °C to thaw; a 10-vial pack may take 2 hours to thaw. Ensure vials 
are completely thawed prior to use. 
Upon moving vials to 2 °C to 8 °C storage, update the expiry date on the carton. 
Unopened vials can be stored for up to 10 weeks at 2 °C to 8 °C; not exceeding the printed 
expiry date (EXP). 
Alternatively, individual frozen vials may be thawed for 30 minutes at temperatures up to 30 °C. 
Prior to use, the unopened vial can be stored for up to 12 hours at temperatures up to 30 °C. 
Thawed vials can be handled in room light conditions.

Dilution 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Allow the thawed vial to come to room temperature and gently invert it 10 times prior to 
dilution. Do not shake. 
Prior to dilution, the thawed dispersion may contain white to off-white opaque amorphous 
particles.  
The thawed vaccine must be diluted in its original vial with 2.2 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL 
(0.9%) solution for injection, using a 21 gauge or narrower needle and aseptic techniques.  
Equalise vial pressure before removing the needle from the vial stopper by withdrawing 2.2 mL 
air into the empty diluent syringe. 
281 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Gently invert the diluted dispersion 10 times. Do not shake. 
The diluted vaccine should present as a white to off-white dispersion with no particulates 
visible. Do not use the diluted vaccine if particulates or discolouration are present. 
The diluted vials should be marked with the appropriate discard date and time. 
After dilution, store at 2 ºC to 30 ºC and use within 12 hours.  
Do not freeze or shake the diluted dispersion. If refrigerated, allow the diluted dispersion to 
come to room temperature prior to use. 
Preparation of 0.2mL doses 
After dilution, the vial contains 2.6 mL from which 10 doses of 0.2 mL can be extracted. 
Using aseptic technique, cleanse the vial stopper with a single-use antiseptic swab. 
• 
• 
•  Withdraw 0.2 mL of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 for infants and children aged 6 months to 
4 years. 
Low dead-volume syringes and/or needles should be used in order to extract 10 doses from a 
single vial. The low dead-volume syringe and needle combination should have a dead volume of 
no more than 35 microlitres. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be 
sufficient volume to extract ten doses from a single vial. 
Each dose must contain 0.2 mL of vaccine. 
If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.2 mL, discard the 
vial and any excess volume. 
Discard any unused vaccine within 12 hours after dilution.  
• 
• 
• 
Disposal 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

Adults and adolescents from 12 years 
COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine 
tozinameran 
This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 
for how to report side effects. 
Read all of this leaflet carefully before you receive this vaccine because it contains important 
information for you. 
• 
• 
• 
Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  
If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible 
side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

6.   Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Comirnaty is and what it is used for 
Comirnaty is a vaccine used for preventing COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2.  
Comirnaty 30 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is given to adults and 
adolescents from 12 years of age and older.  
The vaccine causes  the immune system (the body’s natural defences) to produce antibodies and blood 
cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID-19. 
As Comirnaty does not contain the virus to produce immunity, it cannot give you COVID-19. 
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.   
2.  What you need to know before you receive Comirnaty  
Comirnaty should not be given 
• 
if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed 
in section 6)  
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given the vaccine if: 
• 
you have ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after any other vaccine 
injection or after you were given this vaccine in the past. 
you are feeling nervous about the vaccination process or have ever fainted following any needle 
injection. 
you have a severe illness or infection with high fever. However, you can have your vaccination 
if you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold. 
• 
• 
341 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
you have a bleeding problem, you bruise easily or you use a medicine to prevent blood-clots. 
you have a weakened immune system, because of a disease such as HIV infection or a medicine 
such as corticosteroid that affects your immune system. 
There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis 
(inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Comirnaty (see section 4). These 
conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 
14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger 
males. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis seems lower in children ages 5 to 11 years compared 
with ages 12 to 17 years. Most cases of myocarditis and pericarditis recover. Some cases required 
intensive care support and fatal cases have been seen. Following vaccination, you should be alert to 
signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek 
immediate medical attention should these occur.  
As with any vaccine, Comirnaty may not fully protect all those who receive it and it is not known how 
long you will be protected. 
The efficacy of Comirnaty may be lower in people who are immunocompromised. If you are 
immunocompromised, you may receive additional doses of Comirnaty. In these cases, you should 
continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID-19. In addition, your close contacts 
should be vaccinated as appropriate. Discuss appropriate individual recommendations with your 
doctor. 
Children 
Comirnaty 30 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is not recommended for 
children aged under 12 years. 
There are paediatric formulations available for infants aged 6 months and above and children below 
12 years of age. For details, please refer to the Package Leaflet for other formulations. 
The vaccine is not recommended for infants aged under 6 months. 
Other medicines and Comirnaty 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines 
or have recently received any other vaccine. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before you 
receive this vaccine. 
Comirnaty can be used during pregnancy. A large amount of information from pregnant women 
vaccinated with Comirnaty during the second and third trimester have not shown negative effects on 
the pregnancy or the newborn baby. While information on effects on pregnancy or the newborn baby 
after vaccination during the first trimester is limited, no change to the risk for miscarriage has been 
seen.  
Comirnaty can be given during breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
Some of the effects of vaccination mentioned in section 4 (Possible side effects) may temporarily 
affect your ability to drive or use machines. Wait until these effects have worn off before you drive or 
use machines. 
Comirnaty contains potassium and sodium 
This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘potassium-free’. 
342 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
3.  How Comirnaty is given 
Comirnaty is given after dilution as an injection of 0.3 mL into a muscle of your upper arm. 
You will receive 1 injection, regardless whether you have received a COVID-19 vaccine before. 
If you were previously vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, you should not receive a dose of 
Comirnaty until at least 3 months after the most recent dose.  
If you are immunocompromised, you may receive additional doses of Comirnaty.  
If you have any further questions on the use of Comirnaty, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency website: 
http://www.ema.europa.eu.  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Administer Comirnaty intramuscularly after dilution as a single dose of 0.3 mL regardless of prior 
COVID-19 vaccination status.  
For individuals who have previously been vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty should be 
administered at least 3 months after the most recent dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.  
Additional doses may be given to individuals who are severely immunocompromised. 
Traceability  
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.  
Handling instructions prior to use 
Comirnaty should be prepared by a healthcare professional using aseptic technique to ensure the 
sterility of the prepared dispersion. 
• 
Verify that the vial has a purple plastic cap and the product name is Comirnaty 
30 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection (12 years and older).  
If the vial has another product name on the label, please make reference to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics for that formulation. 
The vial is stored frozen and must be thawed prior to dilution. Frozen vials should be transferred 
to an environment of 2 °C to 8 °C to thaw; a 195-vial pack may take 3 hours to thaw. 
Alternatively, frozen vials may also be thawed for 30 minutes at temperatures up to 30 °C for 
immediate use. 
The unopened vial can be stored for up to 1 month at 2 °C to 8 °C; not exceeding the printed 
expiry date (EXP). Within the 1-month shelf life at 2 °C to 8 °C, up to 48 hours may be used for 
transportation.  
Allow the thawed vial to come to room temperature. Prior to use, the unopened vial can be 
stored for up to 2 hours at temperatures up to 30 °C. Thawed vials can be handled in room light 
conditions. 
Dilution 
• 
• 
Gently invert the vial 10 times prior to dilution. Do not shake. 
Prior to dilution, the thawed dispersion may contain white to off-white opaque amorphous 
particles.  
The thawed vaccine must be diluted in its original vial with 1.8 mL of sodium chloride 
9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection, using a 21 gauge or narrower needle and aseptic 
techniques.  
Equalise vial pressure before removing the needle from the vial stopper by withdrawing 1.8 mL 
air into the empty diluent syringe. 
Gently invert the diluted dispersion 10 times. Do not shake. 
The diluted vaccine should present as an off-white dispersion with no particulates visible. Do 
not use the diluted vaccine if particulates or discolouration are present. 
The diluted vials should be marked with the appropriate discard date and time. 
After dilution, store at 2 ºC to 30 ºC and use within 6 hours, including any transportation time.  
Do not freeze or shake the diluted dispersion. If refrigerated, allow the diluted dispersion to 
come to room temperature prior to use. 
Preparation of 0.3 mL doses 
• 
• 
After dilution, the vial contains 2.25 mL from which 6 doses of 0.3 mL can be extracted.  
Using aseptic technique, cleanse the vial stopper with a single-use antiseptic swab.

• 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Withdraw 0.3 mL of Comirnaty.  
Low dead-volume syringes and/or needles should be used in order to extract 6 doses from a 
single vial. The low dead-volume syringe and needle combination should have a dead volume of

1.  What Comirnaty is and what it is used for 
Comirnaty is a vaccine used for preventing COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2.  
Comirnaty 30 micrograms/dose dispersion for injection is given to adults and adolescents from 
12 years of age and older.  
The vaccine causes  the immune system (the body’s natural defences) to produce antibodies and blood 
cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID-19. 
As Comirnaty does not contain the virus to produce immunity, it cannot give you COVID-19. 
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 
2.  What you need to know before you receive Comirnaty  
Comirnaty should not be given 
• 
if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed 
in section 6)  
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given the vaccine if: 
• 
you have ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after any other vaccine 
injection or after you were given this vaccine in the past. 
you are feeling nervous about the vaccination process or have ever fainted following any needle 
injection. 
you have a severe illness or infection with high fever. However, you can have your vaccination 
if you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold. 
• 
• 
349 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
you have a bleeding problem, you bruise easily or you use a medicine to prevent blood-clots. 
you have a weakened immune system, because of a disease such as HIV infection or a medicine 
such as corticosteroid that affects your immune system. 
There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis 
(inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Comirnaty (see section 4). These 
conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 
14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger 
males. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis seems lower in children ages 5 to 11 years compared 
with ages 12 to 17 years. Most cases of myocarditis and pericarditis recover. Some cases required 
intensive care support and fatal cases have been seen. Following vaccination, you should be alert to 
signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek 
immediate medical attention should these occur.  
As with any vaccine, Comirnaty may not fully protect all those who receive it and it is not known how 
long you will be protected. 
The efficacy of Comirnaty may be lower in people who are immunocompromised. If you are 
immunocompromised, you may receive additional doses of Comirnaty. In these cases, you should 
continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID-19. In addition, your close contacts 
should be vaccinated as appropriate. Discuss appropriate individual recommendations with your 
doctor. 
Children 
Comirnaty 30 micrograms/dose dispersion for injection is not recommended for children aged under 
12 years. 
There are paediatric formulations available for infants aged 6 months and above and children below 
12 years of age. For details, please refer to the Package Leaflet for other formulations. 
The vaccine is not recommended for infants aged under 6 months. 
Other medicines and Comirnaty 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines 
or have recently received any other vaccine. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before you 
receive this vaccine. 
Comirnaty can be used during pregnancy. A large amount of information from pregnant women 
vaccinated with Comirnaty during the second and third trimester have not shown negative effects on 
the pregnancy or the newborn baby. While information on effects on pregnancy or the newborn baby 
after vaccination during the first trimester is limited, no change to the risk for miscarriage has been 
seen.  
Comirnaty can be given during breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
Some of the effects of vaccination mentioned in section 4 (Possible side effects) may temporarily 
affect your ability to drive or use machines. Wait until these effects have worn off before you drive or 
use machines.

3.  How Comirnaty is given 
Comirnaty is given as an injection of 0.3 mL into a muscle of your upper arm. 
You will receive 1 injection, regardless whether you have received a COVID-19 vaccine before. 
If you were previously vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, you should not receive a dose of 
Comirnaty until at least 3 months after the most recent dose.  
If you are immunocompromised, you may receive additional doses of Comirnaty.  
If you have any further questions on the use of Comirnaty, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Administer Comirnaty intramuscularly after dilution as a single dose of 0.2 mL regardless of prior 
COVID-19 vaccination status. 
For individuals who have previously been vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty should be 
administered at least 3 months after the most recent dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.  
Additional doses may be given to individuals who are severely immunocompromised. 
Traceability  
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.  
Handling instructions prior to use 
Comirnaty should be prepared by a healthcare professional using aseptic technique to ensure the 
sterility of the prepared dispersion. 
361 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Verify that the vial has an orange plastic cap and the product name is Comirnaty 
10 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection (children 5 to 11 years).  
If the vial has another product name on the label, please make reference to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics for that formulation. 
If the vial is stored frozen it must be thawed prior to use. Frozen vials should be transferred to 
an environment of 2 °C to 8 °C to thaw; a 10-vial pack may take 4 hours to thaw. Ensure vials 
are completely thawed prior to use. 
Upon moving vials to 2 °C to 8 °C storage, update the expiry date on the carton. 
Unopened vials can be stored for up to 10 weeks at 2 °C to 8 °C; not exceeding the printed 
expiry date (EXP). 
Alternatively, individual frozen vials may be thawed for 30 minutes at temperatures up to 30 °C. 
Prior to use, the unopened vial can be stored for up to 12 hours at temperatures up to 30 °C. 
Thawed vials can be handled in room light conditions.  
Dilution 
• 
Allow the thawed vial to come to room temperature and gently invert it 10 times prior to 
dilution. Do not shake. 
Prior to dilution, the thawed dispersion may contain white to off-white opaque amorphous 
particles.  
The thawed vaccine must be diluted in its original vial with 1.3 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL 
(0.9%) solution for injection, using a 21 gauge or narrower needle and aseptic techniques.  
Equalise vial pressure before removing the needle from the vial stopper by withdrawing 1.3 mL 
air into the empty diluent syringe. 
Gently invert the diluted dispersion 10 times. Do not shake. 
The diluted vaccine should present as a white to off-white dispersion with no particulates 
visible. Do not use the diluted vaccine if particulates or discolouration are present. 
The diluted vials should be marked with the appropriate discard date and time. 
After dilution, store at 2 ºC to 30 ºC and use within 12 hours.  
Do not freeze or shake the diluted dispersion. If refrigerated, allow the diluted dispersion to 
come to room temperature prior to use.

Preparation of 0.2 mL doses 
• 
• 
•  Withdraw 0.2 mL of Comirnaty for children aged 5 to 11 years. 
After dilution, the vial contains 2.6 mL from which 10 doses of 0.2 mL can be extracted. 
Using aseptic technique, cleanse the vial stopper with a single-use antiseptic swab. 
Low dead-volume syringes and/or needles should be used in order to extract 10 doses from a 
single vial. The low dead-volume syringe and needle combination should have a dead volume of 
no more than 35 microlitres. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be 
sufficient volume to extract ten doses from a single vial. 
Each dose must contain 0.2 mL of vaccine. 
If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.2 mL, discard the 
vial and any excess volume. 
Discard any unused vaccine within 12 hours after dilution.

safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects your child may get. See the end of 
section 4 for how to report side effects. 
Read all of this leaflet carefully before your child receives this vaccine because it contains 
important information for your child. 
• 
• 
• 
Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  
If you have any further questions, ask your child’s doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
If your child gets any side effects, talk to your child’s doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes

4.   Possible side effects  
5.   How to store Comirnaty 
6.   Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Comirnaty is and what it is used for 
Comirnaty is a vaccine used for preventing COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2.  
Comirnaty 3 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is given to infants and children 
from 6 months to 4 years of age.  
The vaccine causes  the immune system (the body’s natural defences) to produce antibodies and blood 
cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID-19. 
As Comirnaty does not contain the virus to produce immunity, it cannot give your child COVID-19. 
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 
2.  What you need to know before your child receives Comirnaty  
Comirnaty should not be given 
• 
if your child is allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6)  
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your child’s doctor, pharmacist or nurse before your child is given the vaccine if your child: 
• 
has ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after any other vaccine injection or 
after having been given this vaccine in the past. 
is feeling nervous about the vaccination process or has ever fainted following any needle 
injection. 
has a severe illness or infection with high fever. However, your child can have the vaccination if 
he/she has a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold. 
• 
• 
363 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
has a bleeding problem, bruises easily or uses a medicine to prevent blood-clots. 
has a weakened immune system, because of a disease such as HIV infection or a medicine such 
as corticosteroid that affects the immune system. 
There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis 
(inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Comirnaty (see section 4). These 
conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 
14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger 
males. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis seems lower in children ages 5 to 11 years compared 
with ages 12 to 17 years. Most cases of myocarditis and pericarditis recover. Some cases required 
intensive care support and fatal cases have been seen. Following vaccination, you should be alert to 
signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek 
immediate medical attention should these occur.  
As with any vaccine, Comirnaty may not fully protect all those who receive it and it is not known how 
long your child will be protected. 
The efficacy of Comirnaty may be lower in people who are immunocompromised. If your child is 
immunocompromised, he/she may receive additional doses of Comirnaty. In these cases, your child 
should continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID-19. In addition, your child’s 
close contacts should be vaccinated as appropriate. Discuss appropriate individual recommendations 
with your child’s doctor. 
Children 
Comirnaty 3 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is not recommended for 
children aged 5 years to 11 years.  
There are paediatric formulations available for children 5 to 11 years of age. For details, please refer to 
the Package Leaflet for other formulations. 
The vaccine is not recommended for infants aged under 6 months. 
Other medicines and Comirnaty 
Tell your child’s doctor or pharmacist if your child is using, has recently used or might use any other 
medicines or has recently received any other vaccine. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Comirnaty 3 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is not intended for individuals 
older than 5 years of age. 
For details for use in individuals older than 5 years of age, please refer to the Package Leaflet for those 
formulations. 
Driving and using machines 
Some of the effects of vaccination mentioned in section 4 (Possible side effects) may temporarily 
affect your child’s ability to use machines or undertake activities such as cycling. Wait until these 
effects have worn off before resuming activities that require your child’s full attention. 
3.  How Comirnaty is given 
If your infant is from 6 months to less than 12 months of age, he/she will be given Comirnaty after 
dilution as an injection of 0.2 mL into a muscle of the thigh. If your infant or child is 1 year of age or 
older, he/she will be given Comirnaty after dilution as an injection of 0.2 mL into a muscle of the thigh 
or into a muscle of the upper arm. 
364 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If your child has not completed a COVID-19 primary vaccination course or has not been infected by 
COVID-19 in the past, your child will receive a maximum of 3 injections (the total number of doses 
required as primary course). It is recommended to receive the second dose 3 weeks after the first dose 
followed by a third dose at least 8 weeks after the second dose to complete the primary course.  
If your child has previously completed a COVID-19 primary vaccination course or has had 
COVID-19, your child will receive 1 injection. If your child was previously vaccinated with a 
COVID-19 vaccine, your child should not receive a dose of Comirnaty until at least 3 months after the 
most recent dose.  
If your child turns 5 years old between their doses in the primary course, he/she should complete the 
primary course at the same 3 micrograms dose level. 
If your child is immunocompromised, he/she may receive additional doses of Comirnaty.  
Interchangeability 
Your child may receive either Comirnaty, Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5, or Comirnaty 
Omicron XBB.1.5 (or a combination) for the primary course. Your child should not receive more than 
the total number of doses needed as primary course. Your child should only be administered the 
primary course once.  
If you have any further questions on the use of Comirnaty, ask your child’s doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
If the child has not completed a COVID-19 primary vaccination course or does not have a history of 
prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, administer Comirnaty intramuscularly after dilution as a primary course 
of maximum 3 doses (the total number of doses required as primary course) (0.2 mL each); the second 
dose administered 3 weeks after the first dose followed by a third dose at least 8 weeks after the 
second dose to complete the primary course. 
If the child has completed a COVID-19 primary vaccination course or has a history of prior SARS-
CoV-2 infection, administer Comirnaty intramuscularly after dilution a single dose of 0.2 mL. If the 
individual was previously vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, the individual should receive a dose 
of Comirnaty at least 3 months after the most recent dose. 
Additional doses may be given to individuals who are severely immunocompromised. 
368 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Traceability  
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.  
Handling instructions prior to use 
Comirnaty should be prepared by a healthcare professional using aseptic technique to ensure the 
sterility of the prepared dispersion. 
• 
Verify that the vial has a maroon plastic cap and the product name is Comirnaty 
3 micrograms/dose  concentrate for dispersion for injection (infants and children 6 months to 
4 years).  
If the vial has another product name on the label, please make reference to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics for that formulation.  
If the vial is stored frozen it must be thawed prior to use. Frozen vials should be transferred to 
an environment of 2 °C to 8 °C to thaw; a 10-vial pack may take 2 hours to thaw. Ensure vials 
are completely thawed prior to use. 
Upon moving vials to 2 °C to 8 °C storage, update the expiry date on the carton. 
Unopened vials can be stored for up to 10 weeks at 2 °C to 8 °C; not exceeding the printed 
expiry date (EXP). 
Alternatively, individual frozen vials may be thawed for 30 minutes at temperatures up to 30 °C. 
Prior to use, the unopened vial can be stored for up to 12 hours at temperatures up to 30 °C. 
Thawed vials can be handled in room light conditions.  
Dilution 
• 
Allow the thawed vial to come to room temperature and gently invert it 10 times prior to 
dilution. Do not shake. 
Prior to dilution, the thawed dispersion may contain white to off-white opaque amorphous 
particles.  
The thawed vaccine must be diluted in its original vial with 2.2 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL 
(0.9%) solution for injection, using a 21 gauge or narrower needle and aseptic techniques.  
Equalise vial pressure before removing the needle from the vial stopper by withdrawing 2.2 mL 
air into the empty diluent syringe. 
Gently invert the diluted dispersion 10 times. Do not shake. 
The diluted vaccine should present as a white to off-white dispersion with no particulates 
visible. Do not use the diluted vaccine if particulates or discolouration are present. 
The diluted vials should be marked with the appropriate discard date and time. 
After dilution, store at 2 ºC to 30 ºC and use within 12 hours.  
Do not freeze or shake the diluted dispersion. If refrigerated, allow the diluted dispersion to 
come to room temperature prior to use.

• 
Using aseptic technique, cleanse the vial stopper with a single-use antiseptic swab. 
•  Withdraw 0.2 mL of Comirnaty for infants and children aged 6 months to 4 years. 
Low dead-volume syringes and/or needles should be used in order to extract 10 doses from a 
single vial. The low dead-volume syringe and needle combination should have a dead volume of 
no more than 35 microlitres. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be 
sufficient volume to extract ten doses from a single vial. 
Each dose must contain 0.2 mL of vaccine. 
If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.2 mL, discard the 
vial and any excess volume. 
Discard any unused vaccine within 12 hours after dilution.

1.  What Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 is and what it is used for 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 is a vaccine used for preventing COVID-19 caused by 
SARS-CoV-2. It is given to adults and adolescents from 12 years of age and older.  
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 is only for individuals who have previously received at least a 
primary vaccination course against COVID-19. 
The vaccine causes  the immune system (the body’s natural defences) to produce antibodies and blood 
cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID-19. 
As Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 does not contain the virus to produce immunity, it cannot give 
you COVID-19. 
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.   
2.  What you need to know before you receive Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 should not be given 
• 
if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed 
in section 6)  
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given the vaccine if: 
• 
you have ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after any other vaccine 
injection or after you were given this vaccine in the past. 
you are feeling nervous about the vaccination process or have ever fainted following any needle 
injection. 
• 
370 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
you have a severe illness or infection with high fever. However, you can have your vaccination 
if you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold. 
you have a bleeding problem, you bruise easily or you use a medicine to prevent blood-clots. 
you have a weakened immune system, because of a disease such as HIV infection or a medicine 
such as corticosteroid that affects your immune system. 
There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis 
(inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Comirnaty (see section 4). These 
conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 
14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger 
males. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis seems lower in children ages 5 to 11 years compared 
with ages 12 to 17 years. Most cases of myocarditis and pericarditis recover. Some cases required 
intensive care support and fatal cases have been seen. Following vaccination, you should be alert to 
signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek 
immediate medical attention should these occur.  
As with any vaccine, Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 may not fully protect all those who receive it 
and it is not known how long you will be protected. 
The efficacy of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 may be lower in people who are 
immunocompromised. If you are immunocompromised, you may receive additional doses of 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1. In these cases, you should continue to maintain physical 
precautions to help prevent COVID-19. In addition, your close contacts should be vaccinated as 
appropriate. Discuss appropriate individual recommendations with your doctor. 
Children 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 (15/15 micrograms)/dose dispersion for injection is not 
recommended for children aged under 12 years. 
There are paediatric formulations available for infants aged 6 months and above and children below 
12 years of age. For details, please refer to the Package Leaflet for other formulations. 
The vaccine is not recommended for infants aged under 6 months. 
Other medicines and Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines 
or have recently received any other vaccine. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before you 
receive this vaccine. 
No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 during pregnancy. 
However, a large amount of information from pregnant women vaccinated with the initially approved 
Comirnaty vaccine during the second and third trimester have not shown negative effects on the 
pregnancy or the newborn baby. While information on effects on pregnancy or the newborn baby after 
vaccination during the first trimester is limited, no change to the risk for miscarriage has been seen. 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 can be used during pregnancy. 
No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 during 
breast-feeding. However, no effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Data from women 
who were breast-feeding after vaccination with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine have not 
shown a risk for adverse effects in breastfed newborns/infants. Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 can 
be used while breast-feeding. 
371 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Driving and using machines 
Some of the effects of vaccination mentioned in section 4 (Possible side effects) may temporarily 
affect your ability to drive or use machines. Wait until these effects have worn off before you drive or 
use machines. 
3.  How Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 is given 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 is given as an injection of 0.3 mL into a muscle of your upper arm. 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 is only for individuals who have previously received at least a 
primary vaccination course against COVID-19. 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 may be given at least 3 months after the most recent dose of a 
COVID-19 vaccine.  
Please check with your healthcare provider regarding eligibility for and timing of the booster dose. 
If you are immunocompromised, you may receive additional doses of Comirnaty Original/Omicron 
BA.1. 
For details on the primary vaccination course in individuals 12 years of age and older, please refer to 
the Package Leaflet for those formulations. 
If you have any further questions on the use of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1, ask your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse.

1.  What Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 is and what it is used for 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 is a vaccine used for preventing COVID-19 caused by 
SARS-CoV-2. It is given to adults and adolescents from 12 years of age and older.  
The vaccine causes  the immune system (the body’s natural defences) to produce antibodies and blood 
cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID-19. 
As Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 does not contain the virus to produce immunity, it cannot 
give you COVID-19. 
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.   
2.  What you need to know before you receive Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 should not be given 
• 
if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed 
in section 6)  
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given the vaccine if: 
• 
you have ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after any other vaccine 
injection or after you were given this vaccine in the past. 
you are feeling nervous about the vaccination process or have ever fainted following any needle 
injection. 
you have a severe illness or infection with high fever. However, you can have your vaccination 
if you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold. 
• 
• 
377 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
you have a bleeding problem, you bruise easily or you use a medicine to prevent blood-clots. 
you have a weakened immune system, because of a disease such as HIV infection or a medicine 
such as corticosteroid that affects your immune system. 
There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis 
(inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Comirnaty (see section 4). These 
conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 
14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger 
males. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis seems lower in children ages 5 to 11 years compared 
with ages 12 to 17 years. Most cases of myocarditis and pericarditis recover. Some cases required 
intensive care support and fatal cases have been seen. Following vaccination, you should be alert to 
signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek 
immediate medical attention should these occur.  
As with any vaccine, Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 may not fully protect all those who receive 
it and it is not known how long you will be protected. 
The efficacy of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 may be lower in people who are 
immunocompromised. If you are immunocompromised, you may receive additional doses of 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5. In these cases, you should continue to maintain physical 
precautions to help prevent COVID-19. In addition, your close contacts should be vaccinated as 
appropriate. Discuss appropriate individual recommendations with your doctor. 
Children 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (15/15 micrograms)/dose dispersion for injection is not 
recommended for children aged under 12 years. 
There are paediatric formulations available for infants aged 6 months and above and children below 
12 years of age. For details, please refer to the Package Leaflet for other formulations. 
The vaccine is not recommended for infants aged under 6 months.

No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 during pregnancy. 
However, a large amount of information from pregnant women vaccinated with the initially approved 
Comirnaty vaccine during the second and third trimester have not shown negative effects on the 
pregnancy or the newborn baby. While information on effects on pregnancy or the newborn baby after 
vaccination during the first trimester is limited, no change to the risk for miscarriage has been seen. 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 can be used during pregnancy. 
No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 during 
breast-feeding. However, no effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Data from women 
who were breast-feeding after vaccination with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine have not 
shown a risk for adverse effects in breastfed newborns/infants. Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 
can be used while breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
Some of the effects of vaccination mentioned in section 4 (Possible side effects) may temporarily 
affect your ability to drive or use machines. Wait until these effects have worn off before you drive or

3.  How Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 is given 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 is given as an injection of 0.3 mL into a muscle of your upper 
arm. 
You will receive 1 injection, regardless whether you have received a COVID-19 vaccine before. 
If you were previously vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, you should not receive a dose of 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 until at least 3 months after the most recent dose. 
If you are immunocompromised, you may receive additional doses of Comirnaty Original/Omicron

Original/Omicron BA.4-5 should be administered at least 3 months after the most recent dose of a 
COVID-19 vaccine.  
Additional doses may be given to individuals who are severely immunocompromised. 
Traceability  
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.  
Handling instructions prior to use 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 should be prepared by a healthcare professional using aseptic 
technique to ensure the sterility of the prepared dispersion. 
• 
Verify that the vial has a grey plastic cap and the product name is Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (15/15 micrograms)/dose dispersion for injection (12 years and 
older).  
If the vial has another product name on the label, please make reference to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics for that formulation. 
If the vial is stored frozen it must be thawed prior to use. Frozen vials should be transferred to 
an environment of 2 °C to 8 °C to thaw. Ensure vials are completely thawed prior to use. 
− 
−  Multidose vials: A 10-vial pack of multidose vials may take 6 hours to thaw. 
Upon moving vials to 2 °C to 8 °C storage, update the expiry date on the carton.

Preparation of 0.3 mL doses 
• 
• 
Gently mix by inverting vials 10 times prior to use. Do not shake. 
Prior to mixing, the thawed dispersion may contain white to off-white opaque amorphous 
particles.  
After mixing, the vaccine should present as a white to off-white dispersion with no particulates 
visible. Do not use the vaccine if particulates or discolouration are present. 
Check whether the vial is a single dose vial or a multidose vial and follow the applicable 
handling instructions below: 
−  Single dose vials 
  Withdraw a single 0.3 mL dose of vaccine. 
  Discard vial and any excess volume. 
−  Multidose vials 
  Multidose vials contain 6 doses of 0.3 mL each. 
  Using aseptic technique, cleanse the vial stopper with a single-use antiseptic 
swab. 
  Withdraw 0.3 mL of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5.  
Low dead-volume syringes and/or needles should be used in order to extract 6 doses from a 
single vial. The low dead-volume syringe and needle combination should have a dead volume of 
no more than 35 microlitres. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be 
sufficient volume to extract a sixth dose from a single vial. 
Each dose must contain 0.3 mL of vaccine. 
If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.3 mL, discard the 
vial and any excess volume.  
Record the appropriate date/time on the vial. Discard any unused vaccine 12 hours after first 
puncture.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Administer Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 intramuscularly after dilution as a single dose of 
0.2 mL regardless of prior COVID-19 vaccination status. 
For individuals who have previously been vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 should be administered at least 3 months after the most recent dose of a 
COVID-19 vaccine.  
Additional doses may be given to individuals who are severely immunocompromised.  
Traceability  
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.  
390 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Handling instructions prior to use 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 should be prepared by a healthcare professional using aseptic 
technique to ensure the sterility of the prepared dispersion. 
• 
Verify that the vial has an orange plastic cap and the product name is Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (5/5 micrograms)/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection 
(children 5 to 11 years).  
If the vial has another product name on the label, please make reference to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics for that formulation. 
If the vial is stored frozen it must be thawed prior to use. Frozen vials should be transferred to 
an environment of 2 °C to 8 °C to thaw; a 10-vial pack may take 4 hours to thaw. Ensure vials 
are completely thawed prior to use. 
Upon moving vials to 2 °C to 8 °C storage, update the expiry date on the carton. 
Unopened vials can be stored for up to 10 weeks at 2 °C to 8 °C; not exceeding the printed 
expiry date (EXP). 
Alternatively, individual frozen vials may be thawed for 30 minutes at temperatures up to 30 °C. 
Prior to use, the unopened vial can be stored for up to 12 hours at temperatures up to 30 °C. 
Thawed vials can be handled in room light conditions.

Dilution 
• 
Allow the thawed vial to come to room temperature and gently invert it 10 times prior to 
dilution. Do not shake. 
Prior to dilution, the thawed dispersion may contain white to off-white opaque amorphous 
particles.  
The thawed vaccine must be diluted in its original vial with 1.3 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL 
(0.9%) solution for injection, using a 21 gauge or narrower needle and aseptic techniques.  
Equalise vial pressure before removing the needle from the vial stopper by withdrawing 1.3 mL 
air into the empty diluent syringe. 
Gently invert the diluted dispersion 10 times. Do not shake. 
The diluted vaccine should present as a white to off-white dispersion with no particulates 
visible. Do not use the diluted vaccine if particulates or discolouration are present. 
The diluted vials should be marked with the appropriate discard date and time. 
After dilution, store at 2 ºC to 30 ºC and use within 12 hours.  
Do not freeze or shake the diluted dispersion. If refrigerated, allow the diluted dispersion to 
come to room temperature prior to use.

Preparation of 0.2 mL doses 
• 
After dilution, the vial contains 2.6 mL from which 10 doses of 0.2 mL can be extracted. 
• 
Using aseptic technique, cleanse the vial stopper with a single-use antiseptic swab. 
•  Withdraw 0.2 mL of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 for children aged 5 to 11 years. 
Low dead-volume syringes and/or needles should be used in order to extract 10 doses from a 
single vial. The low dead-volume syringe and needle combination should have a dead volume of 
no more than 35 microlitres. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be 
sufficient volume to extract ten doses from a single vial. 
Each dose must contain 0.2 mL of vaccine. 
If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.2 mL, discard the 
vial and any excess volume. 
Discard any unused vaccine within 12 hours after dilution.

1.  What Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 is and what it is used for 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 is a vaccine used for preventing COVID-19 caused by 
SARS-CoV-2. It is given to children from 5 to 11 years of age.  
The vaccine causes  the immune system (the body’s natural defences) to produce antibodies and blood 
cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID-19. 
As Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 does not contain the virus to produce immunity, it cannot 
give your child COVID-19. 
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 
2.  What you need to know before your child receives Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 should not be given 
• 
if your child is allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6)  
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your child’s doctor, pharmacist or nurse before your child is given the vaccine if your child: 
• 
has ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after any other vaccine injection or 
after having been given this vaccine in the past. 
is feeling nervous about the vaccination process or has ever fainted following any needle 
injection. 
has a severe illness or infection with high fever. However, your child can have the vaccination if 
he/she has a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold. 
• 
• 
392 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
has a bleeding problem, bruises easily or uses a medicine to prevent blood-clots. 
has a weakened immune system, because of a disease such as HIV infection or a medicine such 
as corticosteroid that affects the immune system. 
There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis 
(inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Comirnaty (see section 4). These 
conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 
14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger 
males. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis seems lower in children ages 5 to 11 years compared 
with ages 12 to 17 years. Most cases of myocarditis and pericarditis recover. Some cases required 
intensive care support and fatal cases have been seen. Following vaccination, you should be alert to 
signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek 
immediate medical attention should these occur.  
As with any vaccine, Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 may not fully protect all those who receive 
it and it is not known how long your child will be protected. 
The efficacy of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 may be lower in people who are 
immunocompromised. If your child is immunocompromised, he/she may receive additional doses of 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5. In these cases, your child should continue to maintain physical 
precautions to help prevent COVID-19. In addition, your child’s close contacts should be vaccinated 
as appropriate. Discuss appropriate individual recommendations with your child’s doctor. 
Children 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (5/5 micrograms)/dose dispersion for injection is not 
recommended for children aged under 5 years. 
There are paediatric formulations available for infants and children aged 6 months to 4 years. For 
details, please refer to the Package Leaflet for other formulations. 
The vaccine is not recommended for infants aged under 6 months. 
Other medicines and Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 
Tell your child’s doctor or pharmacist if your child is using, has recently used or might use any other 
medicines or has recently received any other vaccine. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If your child is pregnant, tell your child’s doctor, nurse or pharmacist before your child receives this 
vaccine. 
No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 during pregnancy. 
However, a large amount of information from pregnant women vaccinated with the initially approved 
Comirnaty vaccine during the second and third trimester have not shown negative effects on the 
pregnancy or the newborn baby. While information on effects on pregnancy or the newborn baby after 
vaccination during the first trimester is limited, no change to the risk for miscarriage has been seen. 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 can be used during pregnancy. 
No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 during 
breast-feeding. However, no effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Data from women 
who were breast-feeding after vaccination with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine have not 
shown a risk for adverse effects in breastfed newborns/infants. Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 
can be used while breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
Some of the effects of vaccination mentioned in section 4 (Possible side effects) may temporarily 
affect your child’s ability to use machines or undertake activities such as cycling. Wait until these 
effects have worn off before resuming activities that require your child’s full attention. 
393 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.  How Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 is given 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 is given as an injection of 0.3 mL into a muscle of your child’s 
upper arm. 
Your child will receive 1 injection, regardless whether he/she has received a COVID-19 vaccine 
before. 
If your child was previously vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, he/she should not receive a dose of 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 until at least 3 months after the most recent dose. 
If your child is immunocompromised, your child may receive additional doses of Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5.  
If you have any further questions on the use of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5, ask your child’s 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Administer Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 intramuscularly as a single dose of 0.3 mL regardless 
of prior COVID-19 vaccination status.  
397 
 
 
  
 
 
 
For individuals who have previously been vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 should be administered at least 3 months after the most recent dose of a 
COVID-19 vaccine.  
Additional doses may be given to individuals who are severely immunocompromised. 
Traceability  
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.  
Handling instructions prior to use 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 should be prepared by a healthcare professional using aseptic 
technique to ensure the sterility of the prepared dispersion. 
• 
Verify that the vial has a blue plastic cap and the product name is Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (5/5 micrograms)/dose dispersion for injection (children 5 to 
11 years).  
If the vial has another product name on the label, please make reference to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics for that formulation. 
If the vial is stored frozen it must be thawed prior to use. Frozen vials should be transferred to 
an environment of 2 °C to 8 °C to thaw. Ensure vials are completely thawed prior to use. 
− 
−  Multidose vials: A 10-vial pack of multidose vials may take 6 hours to thaw. 
Upon moving vials to 2 °C to 8 °C storage, update the expiry date on the carton. 
Unopened vials can be stored for up to 10 weeks at 2 °C to 8 °C; not exceeding the printed 
expiry date (EXP).  
Alternatively, individual frozen vials may be thawed for 30 minutes at temperatures up to 30 °C.  
Prior to use, the unopened vial can be stored for up to 12 hours at temperatures up to 30 °C. 
Thawed vials can be handled in room light conditions. 
Single dose vials: A 10-vial pack of single dose vials may take 2 hours to thaw.  
Preparation of 0.3 mL doses 
• 
• 
Gently mix by inverting vials 10 times prior to use. Do not shake. 
Prior to mixing, the thawed dispersion may contain white to off-white opaque amorphous 
particles.  
After mixing, the vaccine should present as a clear to slightly opalescent dispersion with no 
particulates visible. Do not use the vaccine if particulates or discolouration are present. 
Check whether the vial is a single dose vial or a multidose vial and follow the applicable 
handling instructions below: 
−  Single dose vials 
  Withdraw a single 0.3 mL dose of vaccine. 
  Discard vial and any excess volume. 
−  Multidose vials 
  Multidose vials contain 6 doses of 0.3 mL each. 
  Using aseptic technique, cleanse the vial stopper with a single-use antiseptic 
swab. 
  Withdraw 0.3 mL of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 for children aged 5 to 
11 years.  
Low dead-volume syringes and/or needles should be used in order to extract 6 doses from a 
single vial. The low dead-volume syringe and needle combination should have a dead volume of 
no more than 35 microlitres. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be 
sufficient volume to extract a sixth dose from a single vial. 
Each dose must contain 0.3 mL of vaccine.   
If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.3 mL, discard the 
vial and any excess volume.  
Record the appropriate date/time on the vial. Discard any unused vaccine 12 hours after first 
puncture.

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects your child may get. See the end of 
section 4 for how to report side effects. 
Read all of this leaflet carefully before your child receives this vaccine because it contains 
important information for your child. 
• 
• 
• 
Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  
If you have any further questions, ask your child’s doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
If your child gets any side effects, talk to your child’s doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes 
any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

6.   Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 is and what it is used for 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 is a vaccine used for preventing COVID-19 caused by 
SARS-CoV-2. It is given to infants and children from 6 months to 4 years of age.  
The vaccine causes  the immune system (the body’s natural defences) to produce antibodies and blood 
cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID-19. 
As Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 does not contain the virus to produce immunity, it cannot 
give your child COVID-19. 
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.   
2.  What you need to know before your child receives Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5  
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 should not be given 
• 
if your child is allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6)  
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your child’s doctor, pharmacist or nurse before your child is given the vaccine if your child: 
• 
has ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after any other vaccine injection or 
after having been given this vaccine in the past. 
is feeling nervous about the vaccination process or has ever fainted following any needle 
injection. 
has a severe illness or infection with high fever. However, your child can have the vaccination if 
he/she has a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold. 
• 
• 
400 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
has a bleeding problem, bruises easily or uses a medicine to prevent blood-clots. 
has a weakened immune system, because of a disease such as HIV infection or a medicine such 
as corticosteroid that affects the immune system. 
There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis 
(inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Comirnaty (see section 4). These 
conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 
14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger 
males. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis seems lower in children ages 5 to 11 years compared 
with ages 12 to 17 years. Most cases of myocarditis and pericarditis recover. Some cases required 
intensive care support and fatal cases have been seen. Following vaccination, you should be alert to 
signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek 
immediate medical attention should these occur.  
As with any vaccine, Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 may not fully protect all those who receive 
it and it is not known how long your child will be protected. 
The efficacy of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5, may be lower in people who are 
immunocompromised. If your child is immunocompromised, he/she may receive additional doses of 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5. In these cases, your child should continue to maintain physical 
precautions to help prevent COVID-19. In addition, your child’s close contacts should be vaccinated 
as appropriate. Discuss appropriate individual recommendations with your child’s doctor. 
Children 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (1.5/1.5 micrograms)/dose concentrate for dispersion for 
injection is not recommended for children aged 5 years to 11 years.  
There are paediatric formulations available for children 5 to 11 years of age. For details, please refer to 
the Package Leaflet for other formulations. 
The vaccine is not recommended for infants aged under 6 months. 
Other medicines and Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 
Tell your child’s doctor or pharmacist if your child is using, has recently used or might use any other 
medicines or has recently received any other vaccine. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (1.5/1.5 micrograms)/dose concentrate for dispersion for 
injection is not intended for individuals older than 5 years of age. 
For details for use in individuals older than 5 years of age, please refer to the Package Leaflet for those 
formulations. 
Driving and using machines 
Some of the effects of vaccination mentioned in section 4 (Possible side effects) may temporarily 
affect your child’s ability to use machines or undertake activities such as cycling. Wait until these 
effects have worn off before resuming activities that require your child’s full attention. 
3.  How Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 is given 
If your infant is from 6 months to less than 12 months of age, he/she will be given Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 after dilution as an injection of 0.2 mL into a muscle of the thigh. If your 
infant or child is 1 year of age or older, he/she will be given Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 after 
dilution as an injection of 0.2 mL into a muscle of the thigh or into a muscle of the upper arm. 
401 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If your child has not completed a COVID-19 primary vaccination course or has not been infected by 
COVID-19 in the past, your child will receive a maximum of 3 injections (the total number of doses 
required as primary course). It is recommended to receive the second dose 3 weeks after the first dose 
followed by a third dose at least 8 weeks after the second dose to complete the primary course.  
If your child has previously completed a COVID-19 primary vaccination course or has had COVID-19 
your child will receive 1 injection. If your child was previously vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, 
your child should not receive a dose of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 until at least 3 months 
after the most recent dose.   
If your child turns 5 years old between their doses in the primary course, he/she should complete the 
primary course at the same 3 micrograms dose level. 
If your child is immunocompromised, he/she may receive additional doses of Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5.  
Interchangeability 
Your child may receive either Comirnaty or Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (or a combination of 
both) for the primary course. Your child should not receive more than the total number of doses 
needed as primary course. Your child should only be administered the primary course once.  
If you have any further questions on the use of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5, ask your child’s 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Dilution 
• 
Allow the thawed vial to come to room temperature and gently invert it 10 times prior to 
dilution. Do not shake. 
Prior to dilution, the thawed dispersion may contain white to off-white opaque amorphous 
particles.  
The thawed vaccine must be diluted in its original vial with 2.2 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL 
(0.9%) solution for injection, using a 21 gauge or narrower needle and aseptic techniques.  
Equalise vial pressure before removing the needle from the vial stopper by withdrawing 2.2 mL 
air into the empty diluent syringe. 
Gently invert the diluted dispersion 10 times. Do not shake. 
The diluted vaccine should present as a white to off-white dispersion with no particulates 
visible. Do not use the diluted vaccine if particulates or discolouration are present. 
The diluted vials should be marked with the appropriate discard date and time. 
After dilution, store at 2 ºC to 30 ºC and use within 12 hours.  
Do not freeze or shake the diluted dispersion. If refrigerated, allow the diluted dispersion to

1.  What Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 is and what it is used for 
Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 is a vaccine used for preventing COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2.  
Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 30 micrograms/dose dispersion for injection is given to adults and 
adolescents from 12 years of age and older.  
The vaccine causes  the immune system (the body’s natural defences) to produce antibodies and blood 
cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID-19. 
As Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 does not contain the virus to produce immunity, it cannot give you 
COVID-19. 
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 
2.  What you need to know before you receive Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5  
Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 should not be given 
• 
if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed 
in section 6)  
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given the vaccine if: 
• 
you have ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after any other vaccine 
injection or after you were given this vaccine in the past. 
you are feeling nervous about the vaccination process or have ever fainted following any needle 
injection. 
• 
408 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
you have a severe illness or infection with high fever. However, you can have your vaccination 
if you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold. 
you have a bleeding problem, you bruise easily or you use a medicine to prevent blood-clots. 
you have a weakened immune system, because of a disease such as HIV infection or a medicine 
such as corticosteroid that affects your immune system. 
There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis 
(inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Comirnaty (see section 4). These 
conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 
14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger 
males. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis seems lower in children ages 5 to 11 years compared 
with ages 12 to 17 years. Most cases of myocarditis and pericarditis recover. Some cases required 
intensive care support and fatal cases have been seen. Following vaccination, you should be alert to 
signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek 
immediate medical attention should these occur.  
As with any vaccine, Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 may not fully protect all those who receive it and it 
is not known how long you will be protected. 
The efficacy of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 may be lower in people who are immunocompromised. 
If you are immunocompromised, you may receive additional doses of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5. 
In these cases, you should continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID-19. In 
addition, your close contacts should be vaccinated as appropriate. Discuss appropriate individual 
recommendations with your doctor. 
Children 
Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 30 micrograms/dose dispersion for injection is not recommended for 
children aged under 12 years. 
There are paediatric formulations available for infants aged 6 months and above and children below 
12 years of age. For details, please refer to the Package Leaflet for other formulations. 
The vaccine is not recommended for infants aged under 6 months. 
Other medicines and Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines 
or have recently received any other vaccine. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before you 
receive this vaccine. 
No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 during pregnancy. 
However, a large amount of information from pregnant women vaccinated with the initially approved 
Comirnaty vaccine during the second and third trimester have not shown negative effects on the 
pregnancy or the newborn baby. While information on effects on pregnancy or the newborn baby after 
vaccination during the first trimester is limited, no change to the risk for miscarriage has been seen. 
Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 can be used during pregnancy.  
No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 during breast-feeding. 
However, no effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Data from women who were 
breast-feeding after vaccination with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine have not shown a risk 
for adverse effects in breastfed newborns/infants. Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 can be used while 
breast-feeding.

Driving and using machines 
Some of the effects of vaccination mentioned in section 4 (Possible side effects) may temporarily 
affect your ability to drive or use machines. Wait until these effects have worn off before you drive or 
use machines. 
3.  How Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 is given 
Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 is given as an injection of 0.3 mL into a muscle of your upper arm. 
You will receive 1 injection, regardless whether you have received a COVID-19 vaccine before. 
If you were previously vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, you should not receive a dose of 
Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 until at least 3 months after the most recent dose.  
If you are immunocompromised, you may receive additional doses of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5.  
If you have any further questions on the use of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5, ask your doctor,

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Administer Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 intramuscularly after dilution as a single dose of 0.2 mL 
regardless of prior COVID-19 vaccination status. 
For individuals who have previously been vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty Omicron 
XBB.1.5 should be administered at least 3 months after the most recent dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.  
Additional doses may be given to individuals who are severely immunocompromised. 
Traceability  
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

Handling instructions prior to use 
Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 should be prepared by a healthcare professional using aseptic technique 
to ensure the sterility of the prepared dispersion. 
• 
Verify that the vial has an orange plastic cap and the product name is Comirnaty Omicron 
XBB.1.5 (10 micrograms)/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection (children 5 to 
11 years).  
If the vial has another product name on the label, please make reference to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics for that formulation. 
If the vial is stored frozen it must be thawed prior to use. Frozen vials should be transferred to 
an environment of 2 °C to 8 °C to thaw; a 10-vial pack may take 4 hours to thaw. Ensure vials 
are completely thawed prior to use. 
Upon moving vials to 2 °C to 8 °C storage, update the expiry date on the carton. 
Unopened vials can be stored for up to 10 weeks at 2 °C to 8 °C; not exceeding the printed 
expiry date (EXP). 
Alternatively, individual frozen vials may be thawed for 30 minutes at temperatures up to 30 °C.

Dilution 
• 
Allow the thawed vial to come to room temperature and gently invert it 10 times prior to 
dilution. Do not shake. 
Prior to dilution, the thawed dispersion may contain white to off-white opaque amorphous 
particles.  
The thawed vaccine must be diluted in its original vial with 1.3 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL 
(0.9%) solution for injection, using a 21 gauge or narrower needle and aseptic techniques.  
Equalise vial pressure before removing the needle from the vial stopper by withdrawing 1.3 mL 
air into the empty diluent syringe. 
Gently invert the diluted dispersion 10 times. Do not shake. 
The diluted vaccine should present as a white to off-white dispersion with no particulates 
visible. Do not use the diluted vaccine if particulates or discolouration are present. 
The diluted vials should be marked with the appropriate discard date and time. 
After dilution, store at 2 ºC to 30 ºC and use within 12 hours.  
Do not freeze or shake the diluted dispersion. If refrigerated, allow the diluted dispersion to 
come to room temperature prior to use.

Using aseptic technique, cleanse the vial stopper with a single-use antiseptic swab. 
•  Withdraw 0.2 mL of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 for children aged 5 to 11 years. 
Low dead-volume syringes and/or needles should be used in order to extract 10 doses from a 
single vial. The low dead-volume syringe and needle combination should have a dead volume of 
no more than 35 microlitres. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be 
sufficient volume to extract ten doses from a single vial. 
Each dose must contain 0.2 mL of vaccine. 
If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.2 mL, discard the 
vial and any excess volume. 
Discard any unused vaccine within 12 hours after dilution.

6.   Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 is and what it is used for 
Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 is a vaccine used for preventing COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2.  
Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 10 micrograms/dose dispersion for injection is given to children from 5 
to 11 years of age.  
The vaccine causes  the immune system (the body’s natural defences) to produce antibodies and blood 
cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID-19. 
As Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 does not contain the virus to produce immunity, it cannot give your 
child COVID-19. 
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 
2.  What you need to know before your child receives Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 
Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 should not be given 
• 
if your child is allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6)  
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your child’s doctor, pharmacist or nurse before your child is given the vaccine if your child: 
• 
has ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after any other vaccine injection or 
after having been given this vaccine in the past. 
is feeling nervous about the vaccination process or has ever fainted following any needle 
injection. 
• 
423 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
has a severe illness or infection with high fever. However, your child can have the vaccination if 
he/she has a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold. 
has a bleeding problem, bruises easily or uses a medicine to prevent blood-clots. 
has a weakened immune system, because of a disease such as HIV infection or a medicine such 
as corticosteroid that affects the immune system. 
There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis 
(inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Comirnaty (see section 4). These 
conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 
14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger 
males. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis seems lower in children ages 5 to 11 years compared 
with ages 12 to 17 years. Most cases of myocarditis and pericarditis recover. Some cases required 
intensive care support and fatal cases have been seen. Following vaccination, you should be alert to 
signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek 
immediate medical attention should these occur.  
As with any vaccine, Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 may not fully protect all those who receive it and it 
is not known how long your child will be protected. 
The efficacy of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 may be lower in people who are immunocompromised. 
If your child is immunocompromised, he/she may receive additional doses of Comirnaty Omicron 
XBB.1.5. In these cases, your child should continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent 
COVID-19. In addition, your child’s close contacts should be vaccinated as appropriate. Discuss

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Administer Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 intramuscularly as a single dose of 0.3 mL regardless of 
prior COVID-19 vaccination status.  
For individuals who have previously been vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty Omicron 
XBB.1.5 should be administered at least 3 months after the most recent dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.  
Additional doses may be given to individuals who are severely immunocompromised. 
Traceability  
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.  
Handling instructions prior to use 
Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 should be prepared by a healthcare professional using aseptic technique 
to ensure the sterility of the prepared dispersion. 
• 
Single dose vials: A 10-vial pack of single dose vials may take 2 hours to thaw.  
Verify that the vial has a blue plastic cap and the product name is Comirnaty Omicron 
XBB.1.5 (10 micrograms)/dose dispersion for injection (children 5 to 11 years).  
If the vial has another product name on the label, please make reference to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics for that formulation. 
If the vial is stored frozen it must be thawed prior to use. Frozen vials should be transferred to 
an environment of 2 °C to 8 °C to thaw. Ensure vials are completely thawed prior to use. 
− 
−  Multidose vials: A 10-vial pack of multidose vials may take 6 hours to thaw. 
Upon moving vials to 2 °C to 8 °C storage, update the expiry date on the carton. 
Unopened vials can be stored for up to 10 weeks at 2 °C to 8 °C; not exceeding the printed 
expiry date (EXP).  
Alternatively, individual frozen vials may be thawed for 30 minutes at temperatures up to 30 °C.  
Prior to use, the unopened vial can be stored for up to 12 hours at temperatures up to 30 °C. 
Thawed vials can be handled in room light conditions. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Preparation of 0.3 mL doses 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Gently mix by inverting vials 10 times prior to use. Do not shake. 
Prior to mixing, the thawed dispersion may contain white to off-white opaque amorphous 
particles.  
After mixing, the vaccine should present as a clear to slightly opalescent dispersion with no 
particulates visible. Do not use the vaccine if particulates or discolouration are present. 
Check whether the vial is a single dose vial or a multidose vial and follow the applicable 
handling instructions below: 
−  Single dose vials 
  Withdraw a single 0.3 mL dose of vaccine. 
  Discard vial and any excess volume. 
−  Multidose vials 
  Multidose vials contain 6 doses of 0.3 mL each. 
  Using aseptic technique, cleanse the vial stopper with a single-use antiseptic 
swab. 
  Withdraw 0.3 mL of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 for children aged 5 to 11 
years.  
Low dead-volume syringes and/or needles should be used in order to extract 6 doses from a 
single vial. The low dead-volume syringe and needle combination should have a dead volume of 
no more than 35 microlitres. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be 
sufficient volume to extract a sixth dose from a single vial. 
Each dose must contain 0.3 mL of vaccine.   
If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.3 mL, discard the 
vial and any excess volume.  
429 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Record the appropriate date/time on the vial. Discard any unused vaccine 12 hours after first 
puncture.  
Disposal 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects your child may get. See the end of 
section 4 for how to report side effects. 
Read all of this leaflet carefully before your child receives this vaccine because it contains 
important information for your child. 
• 
• 
• 
Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  
If you have any further questions, ask your child’s doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
If your child gets any side effects, talk to your child’s doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes 
any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

6.   Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 is and what it is used for 
Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 is a vaccine used for preventing COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2.  
Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 3 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is given to 
infants and children from 6 months to 4 years of age.  
The vaccine causes  the immune system (the body’s natural defences) to produce antibodies and blood 
cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID-19. 
As Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 does not contain the virus to produce immunity, it cannot give your 
child COVID-19. 
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 
2.  What you need to know before your child receives Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 
Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 should not be given 
• 
if your child is allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6)  
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your child’s doctor, pharmacist or nurse before your child is given the vaccine if your child: 
• 
has ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after any other vaccine injection or 
after having been given this vaccine in the past. 
is feeling nervous about the vaccination process or has ever fainted following any needle 
injection. 
• 
431 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
has a severe illness or infection with high fever. However, your child can have the vaccination if 
he/she has a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold. 
has a bleeding problem, bruises easily or uses a medicine to prevent blood-clots. 
has a weakened immune system, because of a disease such as HIV infection or a medicine such 
as corticosteroid that affects the immune system. 
There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis 
(inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Comirnaty (see section 4). These 
conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 
14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger 
males. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis seems lower in children ages 5 to 11 years compared 
with ages 12 to 17 years. Most cases of myocarditis and pericarditis recover. Some cases required 
intensive care support and fatal cases have been seen. Following vaccination, you should be alert to 
signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek 
immediate medical attention should these occur.  
As with any vaccine, Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 may not fully protect all those who receive it and it 
is not known how long your child will be protected. 
The efficacy of Comirnaty may be lower in people who are immunocompromised. If your child is 
immunocompromised, he/she may receive additional doses of Comirnaty. In these cases, your child 
should continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID-19. In addition, your child’s 
close contacts should be vaccinated as appropriate. Discuss appropriate individual recommendations 
with your child’s doctor. 
Children 
Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 3 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is not 
recommended for children aged 5 years to 11 years.  
There are paediatric formulations available for children 5 to 11 years of age. For details, please refer to 
the Package Leaflet for other formulations. 
The vaccine is not recommended for infants aged under 6 months. 
Other medicines and Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 
Tell your child’s doctor or pharmacist if your child is using, has recently used or might use any other 
medicines or has recently received any other vaccine. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 3 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is not 
intended for individuals older than 5 years of age. 
For details for use in individuals older than 5 years of age, please refer to the Package Leaflet for those 
formulations. 
Driving and using machines 
Some of the effects of vaccination mentioned in section 4 (Possible side effects) may temporarily 
affect your child’s ability to use machines or undertake activities such as cycling. Wait until these 
effects have worn off before resuming activities that require your child’s full attention. 
3.  How Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 is given 
If your infant is from 6 months to less than 12 months of age, he/she will be given Comirnaty Omicron 
XBB.1.5 after dilution as an injection of 0.2 mL into a muscle of the thigh. If your infant or child is 1 
year of age or older, he/she will be given Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 after dilution as an injection of 
0.2 mL into a muscle of the thigh or into a muscle of the upper arm. 
432 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If your child has not completed a COVID-19 primary vaccination course or has not been infected by 
COVID-19 in the past, your child will receive a maximum of 3 injections (the total number of doses 
required as primary course). It is recommended to receive the second dose 3 weeks after the first dose 
followed by a third dose at least 8 weeks after the second dose to complete the primary course.  
If your child has previously completed a COVID-19 primary vaccination course or has had 
COVID-19, your child will receive 1 injection. If your child was previously vaccinated with a 
COVID-19 vaccine, your child should not receive a dose of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 until at least 
3 months after the most recent dose. 
If your child turns 5 years old between their doses in the primary course, he/she should complete the 
primary course at the same 3 micrograms dose level. 
If your child is immunocompromised, he/she may receive additional doses of Comirnaty Omicron 
XBB.1.5.  
Interchangeability 
Your child may receive either Comirnaty, Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5, or Comirnaty 
Omicron XBB.1.5 (or a combination) for the primary course. Your child should not receive more than 
the total number of doses needed as primary course. Your child should only be administered the 
primary course once. 
If you have any further questions on the use of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5, ask your child’s doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
If the child has not completed a COVID-19 primary vaccination course or does not have a history of 
prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, administer Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 intramuscularly after dilution 
as a primary course of maximum 3 doses (the total number of doses required as primary course) 
(0.2 mL each); the second dose administered 3 weeks after the first dose followed by a third dose at 
least 8 weeks after the second dose to complete the primary course.

single dose of 0.2 mL. If the individual was previously vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, the 
individual should receive a dose of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 at least 3 months after the most 
recent dose.   
Additional doses may be given to individuals who are severely immunocompromised. 
Traceability  
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.  
Handling instructions prior to use 
Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 should be prepared by a healthcare professional using aseptic technique 
to ensure the sterility of the prepared dispersion. 
• 
Verify that the vial has a maroon plastic cap and the product name is Comirnaty Omicron 
XBB.1.5 (3 micrograms)/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection (infants and children 
6 months to 4 years).  
If the vial has another product name on the label, please make reference to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics for that formulation.  
If the vial is stored frozen it must be thawed prior to use. Frozen vials should be transferred to 
an environment of 2 °C to 8 °C to thaw; a 10-vial pack may take 2 hours to thaw. Ensure vials 
are completely thawed prior to use. 
Upon moving vials to 2 °C to 8 °C storage, update the expiry date on the carton. 
Unopened vials can be stored for up to 10 weeks at 2 °C to 8 °C; not exceeding the printed 
expiry date (EXP). 
Alternatively, individual frozen vials may be thawed for 30 minutes at temperatures up to 30 °C. 
Prior to use, the unopened vial can be stored for up to 12 hours at temperatures up to 30 °C. 
Thawed vials can be handled in room light conditions.

Dilution 
• 
Allow the thawed vial to come to room temperature and gently invert it 10 times prior to 
dilution. Do not shake. 
Prior to dilution, the thawed dispersion may contain white to off-white opaque amorphous 
particles.  
The thawed vaccine must be diluted in its original vial with 2.2 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL 
(0.9%) solution for injection, using a 21 gauge or narrower needle and aseptic techniques.  
Equalise vial pressure before removing the needle from the vial stopper by withdrawing 2.2 mL 
air into the empty diluent syringe. 
Gently invert the diluted dispersion 10 times. Do not shake. 
The diluted vaccine should present as a white to off-white dispersion with no particulates 
visible. Do not use the diluted vaccine if particulates or discolouration are present. 
The diluted vials should be marked with the appropriate discard date and time. 
After dilution, store at 2 ºC to 30 ºC and use within 12 hours.  
Do not freeze or shake the diluted dispersion. If refrigerated, allow the diluted dispersion to 
come to room temperature prior to use.

4 years. 
Low dead-volume syringes and/or needles should be used in order to extract 10 doses from a 
single vial. The low dead-volume syringe and needle combination should have a dead volume of 
no more than 35 microlitres. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be 
sufficient volume to extract ten doses from a single vial. 
Each dose must contain 0.2 mL of vaccine.

vial and any excess volume. 
Discard any unused vaccine within 12 hours after dilution.  
Disposal 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

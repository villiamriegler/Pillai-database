CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Adults 
Olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia. 
Olanzapine is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in 
patients who have shown an initial treatment response. 
Olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode. 
In patients whose manic episode has responded to olanzapine treatment, olanzapine is indicated for the 
prevention of recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Adults 
Schizophrenia: The recommended starting dose for olanzapine is 10 mg/day. 
Manic episode: The starting dose is 15 mg as a single daily dose in monotherapy or 10 mg daily in 
combination therapy (see section 5.1). 
Preventing recurrence in bipolar disorder: The recommended starting dose is 10 mg/day. For patients 
who have been receiving olanzapine for treatment of manic episode, continue therapy for preventing 
recurrence at the same dose. If a new manic, mixed, or depressive episode occurs, olanzapine 
treatment should be continued (with dose optimisation as needed), with supplementary therapy to treat 
mood symptoms, as clinically indicated. 
During treatment for schizophrenia, manic episode and recurrence prevention in bipolar disorder, daily 
dosage may subsequently be adjusted on the basis of individual clinical status within the range 5-
20 mg/day. An increase to a dose greater than the recommended starting dose is advised only after 
appropriate clinical reassessment and should generally occur at intervals of not less than 24 hours. 
Olanzapine can be given without regards for meals as absorption is not affected by food. Gradual 
tapering of the dose should be considered when discontinuing olanzapine. 
ZYPREXA VELOTAB orodispersible tablet should be placed in the mouth, where it will rapidly 
disperse in saliva, so it can be easily swallowed. Removal of the intact orodispersible tablet from the 
mouth is difficult. Since the orodispersible tablet is fragile, it should be taken immediately on opening 
the blister. Alternatively, it may be dispersed in a full glass of water or other suitable beverage (orange 
juice, apple juice, milk or coffee) immediately before administration.  
Olanzapine orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to olanzapine coated tablets, with a similar rate and 
extent of absorption. It has the same dosage and frequency of administration as olanzapine coated 
tablets. Olanzapine orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to olanzapine coated tablets. 
Special populations 
Elderly  
A lower starting dose (5 mg/day) is not routinely indicated but should be considered for those 65 and 
over when clinical factors warrant (see section 4.4). 
Renal and/or hepatic impairment 
A lower starting dose (5 mg) should be considered for such patients. In cases of moderate hepatic 
insufficiency (cirrhosis, Child-Pugh Class A or B), the starting dose should be 5 mg and only 
increased with caution. 
 3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Smokers 
The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for non-smokers relative to smokers. The 
metabolism of olanzapine may be induced by smoking. Clinical monitoring is recommended and an 
increase of olanzapine dose may be considered if necessary (see section 4.5). 
When more than one factor is present which might result in slower metabolism (female gender, 
geriatric age, non-smoking status), consideration should be given to decreasing the starting dose. Dose 
escalation, when indicated, should be conservative in such patients. 
In cases where dose increments of 2.5 mg are considered necessary, ZYPREXA coated tablets should 
be used. 
(See sections 4.5 and 5.2.) 
Paediatric population 
Olanzapine is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age due to a 
lack of data on safety and efficacy. A greater magnitude of weight gain, lipid and prolactin alterations 
has been reported in short term studies of adolescent patients than in studies of adult patients (see 
sections 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.   
Patients with known risk of narrow-angle glaucoma. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
During antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several days 
to some weeks. Patients should be closely monitored during this period. 
Dementia-related psychosis and/or behavioural disturbances 
Olanzapine is not recommended for use in patients with dementia-related psychosis and/or behavioural 
disturbances because of an increase in mortality and the risk of cerebrovascular accident. In placebo-
controlled clinical trials (6-12 weeks duration) of elderly patients (mean age 78 years) with dementia-
related psychosis and/or disturbed behaviours, there was a 2-fold increase in the incidence of death in 
olanzapine-treated patients compared to patients treated with placebo (3.5% vs. 1.5 %, respectively). 
The higher incidence of death was not associated with olanzapine dose (mean daily dose 4.4 mg) or 
duration of treatment. Risk factors that may predispose this patient population to increased mortality 
include age > 65 years, dysphagia, sedation, malnutrition and dehydration, pulmonary conditions (e.g., 
pneumonia, with or without aspiration), or concomitant use of benzodiazepines. However, the 
incidence of death was higher in olanzapine-treated than in placebo-treated patients independent of 
these risk factors. 
In the same clinical trials, cerebrovascular adverse events (CVAE e.g., stroke, transient ischemic 
attack), including fatalities, were reported. There was a 3-fold increase in CVAE in patients treated 
with olanzapine compared to patients treated with placebo (1.3 % vs. 0.4 %, respectively). All 
olanzapine- and placebo-treated patients who experienced a cerebrovascular event had pre-existing 
risk factors. Age > 75 years and vascular/mixed type dementia were identified as risk factors for 
CVAE in association with olanzapine treatment. The efficacy of olanzapine was not established in 
these trials. 
Parkinson's disease 
The use of olanzapine in the treatment of dopamine agonist associated psychosis in patients with 
Parkinson's disease is not recommended. In clinical trials, worsening of Parkinsonian symptomatology 
and hallucinations were reported very commonly and more frequently than with placebo (see section 
4.8), and olanzapine was not more effective than placebo in the treatment of psychotic symptoms. In 
 4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
these trials, patients were initially required to be stable on the lowest effective dose of anti-
Parkinsonian medicinal products (dopamine agonist) and to remain on the same anti-Parkinsonian 
medicinal products and dosages throughout the study. Olanzapine was started at 2.5 mg/day and 
titrated to a maximum of 15 mg/day based on investigator judgement. 
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)  
NMS is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with antipsychotic medicinal products. Rare 
cases reported as NMS have also been received in association with olanzapine. Clinical manifestations 
of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability 
(irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional 
signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal 
failure. If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or presents with unexplained 
high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all antipsychotic medicines, including 
olanzapine must be discontinued. 
Hyperglycaemia and diabetes 
Hyperglycaemia and/or development or exacerbation of diabetes occasionally associated with 
ketoacidosis or coma has been reported uncommonly, including some fatal cases (see section 4.8). In 
some cases, a prior increase in body weight has been reported which may be a predisposing factor. 
Appropriate clinical monitoring is advisable in accordance with utilised antipsychotic guidelines, e.g. 
measuring of blood glucose at baseline, 12 weeks after starting olanzapine treatment and annually 
thereafter.  Patients treated with any antipsychotic medicines, including ZYPREXA VELOTAB, 
should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, 
polyphagia, and weakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus 
should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Weight should be monitored 
regularly, e.g. at baseline, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after starting olanzapine treatment and quarterly 
thereafter. 
Lipid alterations 
Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in olanzapine-treated patients in placebo-
controlled clinical trials (see section 4.8). Lipid alterations should be managed as clinically 
appropriate, particularly in dyslipidemic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development 
of lipids disorders. Patients treated with any antipsychotic medicines, including ZYPREXA 
VELOTAB, should be monitored regularly for lipids in accordance with utilised antipsychotic 
guidelines, e.g. at baseline, 12 weeks after starting olanzapine treatment and every 5 years thereafter. 
Anticholinergic activity  
While olanzapine demonstrated anticholinergic activity in vitro, experience during the clinical trials 
revealed a low incidence of related events. However, as clinical experience with olanzapine in patients 
with concomitant illness is limited, caution is advised when prescribing for patients with prostatic 
hypertrophy, or paralytic ileus and related conditions. 
Hepatic function 
Transient, asymptomatic elevations of hepatic aminotransferases, ALT, AST have been seen 
commonly, especially in early treatment. Caution should be exercised and follow-up organised in 
patients with elevated ALT and/or AST, in patients with signs and symptoms of hepatic impairment, 
in patients with pre-existing conditions associated with limited hepatic functional reserve, and in 
patients who are being treated with potentially hepatotoxic medicines. In cases where hepatitis 
(including hepatocellular, cholestatic or mixed liver injury) has been diagnosed, olanzapine treatment 
should be discontinued. 
Neutropenia 
Caution should be exercised in patients with low leukocyte and/or neutrophil counts for any reason, in 
patients receiving medicines known to cause neutropenia, in patients with a history of drug-induced 
bone marrow depression/toxicity, in patients with bone marrow depression caused by concomitant 
illness, radiation therapy or chemotherapy and in patients with hypereosinophilic conditions or with 
 5 
 
 
 
 
 
myeloproliferative disease. Neutropenia has been reported commonly when olanzapine and valproate 
are used concomitantly (see section 4.8).  
Discontinuation of treatment 
Acute symptoms such as sweating, insomnia, tremor, anxiety, nausea, or vomiting have been reported 
rarely ( ≥ 0.01 % and <  0.1 %) when olanzapine is stopped abruptly.  
QT interval 
In clinical trials, clinically meaningful QTc prolongations (Fridericia QT correction [QTcF] 
≥ 500 milliseconds [msec] at any time post baseline in patients with baseline QTcF < 500 msec) were 
uncommon (0.1 % to 1 %) in patients treated with olanzapine, with no significant differences in 
associated cardiac events compared to placebo. However, caution should be exercised when 
olanzapine is prescribed with medicines known to increase QTc interval, especially in the elderly, in 
patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, heart hypertrophy, hypokalaemia 
or hypomagnesaemia. 
Thromboembolism 
Temporal association of olanzapine treatment and venous thromboembolism has been reported 
uncommonly (≥ 0.1% and < 1%). A causal relationship between the occurrence of venous 
thromboembolism and treatment with olanzapine has not been established. However, since patients 
with schizophrenia often present with acquired risk factors for venous thromboembolism all possible 
risk factors of VTE e.g. immobilisation of patients, should be identified and preventive measures 
undertaken. 
General CNS activity 
Given the primary CNS effects of olanzapine, caution should be used when it is taken in combination 
with other centrally acting medicines and alcohol. As it exhibits in vitro dopamine antagonism, 
olanzapine may antagonize the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists. 
Seizures 
Olanzapine should be used cautiously in patients who have a history of seizures or are subject to 
factors which may lower the seizure threshold. Seizures have been reported to occur uncommonly in 
patients when treated with olanzapine. In most of these cases, a history of seizures or risk factors for 
seizures were reported. 
Tardive Dyskinesia 
In comparator studies of one year or less duration, olanzapine was associated with a statistically 
significant lower incidence of treatment emergent dyskinesia. However the risk of tardive dyskinesia 
increases with long term exposure, and therefore if signs or symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in 
a patient on olanzapine, a dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered. These symptoms 
can temporally deteriorate or even arise after discontinuation of treatment.  
Postural hypotension 
Postural hypotension was infrequently observed in the elderly in olanzapine clinical trials. It is 
recommended that blood pressure is measured periodically in patients over 65 years. 
Sudden cardiac death  
In postmarketing reports with olanzapine, the event of sudden cardiac death has been reported in 
patients with olanzapine. In a retrospective observational cohort study, the risk of presumed sudden 
cardiac death in patients treated with olanzapine was approximately twice the risk in patients not using 
antipsychotics. In the study, the risk of olanzapine was comparable to the risk of atypical 
antipsychotics included in a pooled analysis. 
 6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric population 
Olanzapine is not indicated for use in the treatment of children and adolescents. Studies in patients 
aged 13-17 years showed various adverse reactions, including weight gain, changes in metabolic 
parameters and increases in prolactin levels(see sections 4.8 and 5.1). 
Aspartame 
This medicine contains up to 1.6 mg aspartame in each tablet. 
Aspartame is a source of phenylalanine. It may be harmful for people who have phenylketonuria 
(PKU), a rare genetic disorder in which phenylalanine builds up because the body cannot remove it 
properly. 
Sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate and sodium propyl parahydroxybenzoate 
This medicine contains sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate and sodium propyl parahydroxybenzoate, 
which may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed)  
Sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
Potential interactions affecting olanzapine 
Since olanzapine is metabolised by CYP1A2, substances that can specifically induce or inhibit this 
isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine.  
Induction of CYP1A2 
The metabolism of olanzapine may be induced by smoking and carbamazepine, which may lead to 
reduced olanzapine concentrations. Only slight to moderate increase in olanzapine clearance has been 
observed. The clinical consequences are likely to be limited, but clinical monitoring is recommended 
and an increase of olanzapine dose may be considered if necessary (see section 4.2). 
Inhibition of CYP1A2 
Fluvoxamine, a specific CYP1A2 inhibitor, has been shown to significantly inhibit the metabolism of 
olanzapine. The mean increase in olanzapine Cmax following fluvoxamine was 54 % in female non-
smokers and 77 % in male smokers. The mean increase in olanzapine AUC was 52 % and 108 % 
respectively. A lower starting dose of olanzapine should be considered in patients who are using 
fluvoxamine or any other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as ciprofloxacin. A decrease in the dose of 
olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated. 
Decreased bioavailability 
Activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral olanzapine by 50 to 60 % and should be taken at 
least 2 hours before or after olanzapine. 
Fluoxetine (a CYP2D6 inhibitor), single doses of antacid (aluminium, magnesium) or cimetidine have 
not been found to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine. 
Potential for olanzapine to affect other medicinal products 
Olanzapine may antagonise the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists. 
Olanzapine does not inhibit the main CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro (e.g. 1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, 3A4). 
Thus no particular interaction is expected as verified through in vivo studies where no inhibition of 
metabolism of the following active substances was found: tricyclic antidepressant (representing mostly 
CYP2D6 pathway), warfarin (CYP2C9), theophylline (CYP1A2) or diazepam (CYP3A4 and 2C19).  
 7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Olanzapine showed no interaction when co-administered with lithium or biperiden. 
Therapeutic monitoring of valproate plasma levels did not indicate that valproate dosage adjustment is 
required after the introduction of concomitant olanzapine. 
General CNS activity 
Caution should be exercised in patients who consume alcohol or receive medicinal products that can 
cause central nervous system depression. 
The concomitant use of olanzapine with anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products in patients with 
Parkinson's disease and dementia is not recommended (see section 4.4).  
QTc interval 
Caution should be used if olanzapine is being administered concomitantly with medicinal products 
known to increase QTc interval (see section 4.4). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Patients should be advised to 
notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with 
olanzapine. Nevertheless, because human experience is limited, olanzapine should be used in 
pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. 
New born infants exposed to antipsychotics (including olanzapine) during the third trimester of 
pregnancy are at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that 
may vary in severity and duration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, 
hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. Consequently, newborns 
should be monitored carefully. 
Breast-feeding 
In a study in breast-feeding, healthy women, olanzapine was excreted in breast milk. Mean infant 
exposure (mg/kg) at steady state was estimated to be 1.8 % of the maternal olanzapine dose (mg/kg). 
Patients should be advised not to breast feed an infant if they are taking olanzapine. 
Fertility 
Effects on fertility are unknown (see section 5.3 for preclinical information). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Because 
olanzapine may cause somnolence and dizziness, patients should be cautioned about operating 
machinery, including motor vehicles. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile

1 Clinically significant weight gain was observed across all baseline Body Mass Index (BMI) 
categories. Following short term treatment (median duration 47 days), weight gain ≥ 7% of baseline 
body weight  was very common (22.2 %), ≥ 15 % was common (4.2 %) and ≥ 25 % was uncommon 
(0.8 %). Patients gaining ≥ 7 %, ≥ 15 % and ≥ 25 % of their baseline body weight with long-term 
exposure (at least 48 weeks) were very common (64.4 %, 31.7 % and 12.3 % respectively). 
2 Mean increases in fasting lipid values (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides) were 
greater in patients without evidence of lipid dysregulation at baseline. 
3 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline (< 5.17 mmol/l) which increased to high 
(≥ 6.2 mmol/l). Changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline (≥ 5.17 - 
< 6.2 mmol/l) to high (≥ 6.2 mmol/l) were very common. 
4 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline (< 5.56 mmol/l) which increased to high (≥ 7 mmol/l). 
Changes in fasting glucose from borderline at baseline (≥ 5.56 - < 7 mmol/l) to high (≥ 7 mmol/l) were 
very common.  
5 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline (< 1.69 mmol/l) which increased to high 
(≥ 2.26 mmol/l). Changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline (≥ 1.69 mmol/l - 
< 2.26 mmol/l) to high (≥ 2.26 mmol/l) were very common. 
6 In clinical trials, the incidence of Parkinsonism and dystonia in olanzapine-treated patients was 
numerically higher, but not statistically significantly different from placebo. Olanzapine-treated patients 
had a lower incidence of Parkinsonism, akathisia and dystonia compared with titrated doses of 
haloperidol. In the absence of detailed information on the pre-existing history of individual acute and 
tardive extrapyramidal movement disorders, it cannot be concluded at present that olanzapine produces 
less tardive dyskinesia and/or other tardive extrapyramidal syndromes. 
7 Acute symptoms such as sweating, insomnia, tremor, anxiety, nausea and vomiting have been 
reported when olanzapine is stopped abruptly. 
8 In clinical trials of up to 12 weeks, plasma prolactin concentrations exceeded the upper limit of 
normal range in approximately 30% of olanzapine treated patients with normal baseline prolactin 
value. In the majority of these patients the elevations were generally mild, and remained below two 
times the upper limit of normal range.

11 Adverse event identified from spontaneous post-marketing reporting with frequency determined 
utilising the Olanzapine Integrated Database. 
12 Adverse event identified from spontaneous post-marketing reporting with frequency estimated at the 
upper limit of the 95% confidence interval utilising the Olanzapine Integrated Database.

Long-term exposure (at least 48 weeks) 
The proportion of patients who had adverse, clinically significant changes in weight gain, glucose, 
total/LDL/HDL cholesterol or triglycerides increased over time. In adult patients who completed 9-12  
months of therapy, the rate of increase in mean blood glucose slowed after approximately 6 months. 
Additional information on special populations 
In clinical trials in elderly patients with dementia, olanzapine treatment was associated with a higher 
incidence of death and cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared to placebo (see section 4.4). Very 
common adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in this patient group were abnormal 
gait and falls. Pneumonia, increased body temperature, lethargy, erythema, visual hallucinations and 
urinary incontinence were observed commonly.  
In clinical trials in patients with drug-induced (dopamine agonist) psychosis associated with 
Parkinson’s disease, worsening of Parkinsonian symptomatology and hallucinations were reported 
very commonly and more frequently than with placebo. 
In one clinical trial in patients with bipolar mania, valproate combination therapy with olanzapine 
resulted in an incidence of neutropenia of 4.1%; a potential contributing factor could be high plasma 
valproate levels. Olanzapine administered with lithium or valproate resulted in increased levels 
(≥ 10%) of tremor, dry mouth, increased appetite, and weight gain. Speech disorder was also reported 
commonly. During treatment with olanzapine in combination with lithium or divalproex, an increase 
of ≥ 7% from baseline body weight occurred in 17.4% of patients during acute treatment (up to 6 
weeks). Long-term olanzapine treatment (up to 12 months) for recurrence prevention in patients with 
bipolar disorder was associated with an increase of ≥ 7% from baseline body weight in 39.9% of 
patients. 
Paediatric population 
Olanzapine is not indicated for the treatment of children and adolescent patients below 18 years. 
Although no clinical studies designed to compare adolescents to adults have been conducted, data 
from the adolescent trials were compared to those of the adult trials.  
The following table summarises the adverse reactions reported with a greater frequency in adolescent 
patients (aged 13-17 years) than in adult patients or adverse reactions only identified during short-term 
clinical trials in adolescent patients. Clinically significant weight gain (≥ 7%) appears to occur more 
frequently in the adolescent population compared to adults with comparable exposures. The magnitude 
of weight gain and the proportion of adolescent patients who had clinically significant weight gain 
were greater with long-term exposure (at least 24 weeks) than with short-term exposure.  
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. 
The frequency terms listed are defined as follows: Very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to 
< 1/10). 
Metabolism and nutrition disorders 
Very common: Weight gain13, elevated triglyceride levels14, increased appetite. 
Common: Elevated cholesterol levels15 
Nervous system disorders 
Very common: Sedation (including: hypersomnia, lethargy, somnolence). 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
Common: Dry mouth 
Hepatobiliary disorders 
Very common: Elevations of hepatic aminotransferases (ALT/AST; see section 4.4). 
Investigations  
Very common: Decreased total bilirubin, increased GGT, elevated plasma prolactin levels16. 
13 Following short term treatment (median duration 22 days), weight gain ≥ 7% of baseline body 
weight (kg) was very common (40.6 %), ≥ 15% of baseline body weight was common (7.1 %) and ≥ 
 12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
25 % was common (2.5 %). With long-term exposure (at least 24 weeks), 89.4 % gained ≥ 7 %, 55.3 
% gained ≥ 15 % and 29.1 % gained ≥ 25% of their baseline body weight.  
14  Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline (< 1.016 mmol/l) which increased to high 
(≥ 1.467 mmol/l) and changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline (≥ 1.016 mmol/l - 
< 1.467 mmol/l) to high (≥ 1.467 mmol/l). 
15 Changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from normal at baseline (< 4.39 mmol/l) to high 
(≥ 5.17 mmol/l) were observed commonly. Changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline 
at baseline (≥ 4.39 - < 5.17 mmol/l) to high (≥ 5.17 mmol/l) were very common. 
16 Elevated plasma prolactin levels were reported in 47.4% of adolescent patients. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed 
in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Signs and symptoms 
Very common symptoms in overdose (> 10 % incidence) include tachycardia, 
agitation/aggressiveness, dysarthria, various extrapyramidal symptoms, and reduced level of 
consciousness ranging from sedation to coma.  
Other medically significant sequelae of overdose include delirium, convulsion, coma, possible 
neuroleptic malignant syndrome, respiratory depression, aspiration, hypertension or hypotension, 
cardiac arrhythmias (< 2 % of overdose cases) and cardiopulmonary arrest. Fatal outcomes have been 
reported for acute overdoses as low as 450 mg but survival has also been reported following acute 
overdose of approximately 2 g of oral olanzapine. 
Management 
There is no specific antidote for olanzapine. Induction of emesis is not recommended. Standard 
procedures for management of overdose may be indicated (i.e. gastric lavage, administration of 
activated charcoal). The concomitant administration of activated charcoal was shown to reduce the 
oral bioavailability of olanzapine by 50 to 60 %. 
Symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital organ function should be instituted according to 
clinical presentation, including treatment of hypotension and circulatory collapse and support of 
respiratory function. Do not use epinephrine, dopamine, or other sympathomimetic agents with beta-
agonist activity since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension. Cardiovascular monitoring is 
necessary to detect possible arrhythmias. Close medical supervision and monitoring should continue 
until the patient recovers.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: psycholeptics, diazepines, oxazepines, thiazepines and oxepines, ATC 
code N05A H03. 
Pharmacodynamic effects  
Olanzapine is an antipsychotic, antimanic and mood stabilising agent that demonstrates a broad 
pharmacologic profile across a number of receptor systems.  
 13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In preclinical studies, olanzapine exhibited a range of receptor affinities (Ki < 100 nM) for serotonin 5 
HT2A/2C, 5 HT3, 5 HT6; dopamine D1, D2, D3, D4, D5; cholinergic muscarinic receptors M1-M5; α1 
adrenergic; and histamine H1 receptors. Animal behavioural studies with olanzapine indicated 5HT, 
dopamine, and cholinergic antagonism, consistent with the receptor-binding profile. Olanzapine 
demonstrated a greater in vitro affinity for serotonin 5HT2 than dopamine D2 receptors and greater 5 
HT2 than D2 activity in vivo models. Electrophysiological studies demonstrated that olanzapine 
selectively reduced the firing of mesolimbic (A10) dopaminergic neurons, while having little effect on 
the striatal (A9) pathways involved in motor function. Olanzapine reduced a conditioned avoidance 
response, a test indicative of antipsychotic activity, at doses below those producing catalepsy, an effect 
indicative of motor side-effects. Unlike some other antipsychotic agents, olanzapine increases 
responding in an “anxiolytic” test. 
In a single oral dose (10 mg) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) study in healthy volunteers, 
olanzapine produced a higher 5 HT2A than dopamine D2 receptor occupancy. In addition, a Single 
Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) imaging study in schizophrenic patients revealed 
that olanzapine-responsive patients had lower striatal D2 occupancy than some other antipsychotic- 
and risperidone-responsive patients, while being comparable to clozapine-responsive patients. 
Clinical efficacy  
In two of two placebo and two of three comparator controlled trials with over 2,900 schizophrenic 
patients presenting with both positive and negative symptoms, olanzapine was associated with 
statistically significantly greater improvements in negative as well as positive symptoms.  
In a multinational, double-blind, comparative study of schizophrenia, schizoaffective, and related 
disorders which included 1,481 patients with varying degrees of associated depressive symptoms 
(baseline mean of 16.6 on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale), a prospective secondary 
analysis of baseline to endpoint mood score change demonstrated a statistically significant 
improvement (p= 0.001) favouring olanzapine (-6.0) versus haloperidol (-3.1). 
In patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder, olanzapine demonstrated superior 
efficacy to placebo and valproate semisodium (divalproex) in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 
weeks. Olanzapine also demonstrated comparable efficacy results to haloperidol in terms of the 
proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania and depression at 6 and 12 weeks. In a 
co-therapy study of patients treated with lithium or valproate for a minimum of 2 weeks, the addition 
of olanzapine 10 mg (co-therapy with lithium or valproate) resulted in a greater reduction in symptoms 
of mania than lithium or valproate monotherapy after 6 weeks. 
In a 12-month recurrence prevention study in manic episode patients who achieved remission on 
olanzapine and were then randomised to olanzapine or placebo, olanzapine demonstrated statistically 
significant superiority over placebo on the primary endpoint of bipolar recurrence. Olanzapine also 
showed a statistically significant advantage over placebo in terms of preventing either recurrence into 
mania or recurrence into depression. 
In a second 12-month recurrence prevention study in manic episode patients who achieved remission 
with a combination of olanzapine and lithium and were then randomised to olanzapine or lithium 
alone, olanzapine was statistically non-inferior to lithium on the primary endpoint of bipolar 
recurrence (olanzapine 30.0%, lithium 38.3%; p = 0.055). 
In an 18-month co-therapy study in manic or mixed episode patients stabilised with olanzapine plus a 
mood stabiliser (lithium or valproate), long-term olanzapine co-therapy with lithium or valproate was 
not statistically significantly superior to lithium or valproate alone in delaying bipolar recurrence, 
defined according to syndromic (diagnostic) criteria. 
Paediatric population 
Controlled efficacy data in adolescents (ages 13 to 17 years) are limited to short term studies in 
schizophrenia (6 weeks) and mania associated with bipolar I disorder (3 weeks), involving less than 
200 adolescents. Olanzapine was used as a flexible dose starting with 2.5 and ranging up to 
 14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
20 mg/day. During treatment with olanzapine, adolescents gained significantly more weight compared 
with adults. The magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and 
prolactin (see sections 4.4 and 4.8) were greater in adolescents than in adults. There are no controlled 
data on maintenance of effect or long term safety (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Information on long term 
safety is primarily limited to open-label, uncontrolled data. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Olanzapine orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to olanzapine coated tablets, with a similar rate and 
extent of absorption. Olanzapine orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to olanzapine 
coated tablets. 
Absorption 
Olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 5 to 
8 hours. The absorption is not affected by food. Absolute oral bioavailability relative to intravenous 
administration has not been determined. 
Distribution 
The plasma protein binding of olanzapine was about 93 % over the concentration range of about 7 to 
about 1000 ng/ml. Olanzapine is bound predominantly to albumin and α1-acid-glycoprotein. 
Biotransformation 
Olanzapine is metabolized in the liver by conjugative and oxidative pathways. The major circulating 
metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide, which does not pass the blood brain barrier. Cytochromes P450-
CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 contribute to the formation of the N-desmethyl and 2-hydroxymethyl 
metabolites, both exhibited significantly less in vivo pharmacological activity than olanzapine in 
animal studies. The predominant pharmacologic activity is from the parent olanzapine.  
Elimination 
After oral administration, the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects 
varied on the basis of age and gender. 
In healthy elderly (65 and over) versus non-elderly subjects, the mean elimination half-life was 
prolonged (51.8 versus 33.8 hr) and the clearance was reduced (17.5 versus 18.2 l/hr). The 
pharmacokinetic variability observed in the elderly is within the range for the non-elderly. In 44 
patients with schizophrenia > 65 years of age, dosing from 5 to 20 mg/day was not associated with any 
distinguishing profile of adverse events. 
In female versus male subjects the mean elimination half life was somewhat prolonged (36.7 versus 
32.3 hrs) and the clearance was reduced (18.9 versus 27.3 l/hr). However, olanzapine (5-20 mg) 
demonstrated a comparable safety profile in female (n=467) as in male patients (n=869). 
Renal impairment 
In renally impaired patients (creatinine clearance < 10 ml/min) versus healthy subjects, there was no 
significant difference in mean elimination half-life (37.7 versus 32.4 hr) or clearance (21.2 versus 
25.0 l/hr). A mass balance study showed that approximately 57 % of radiolabelled olanzapine 
appeared in urine, principally as metabolites. 
Hepatic impairment 
A small study of the effect of impaired liver function in 6 subjects with clinically significant (Childs 
Pugh Classification A (n = 5) and B (n = 1)) cirrhosis revealed little effect on the pharmacokinetics of 
orally administered olanzapine (2.5 – 7.5 mg single dose): Subjects with mild to moderate hepatic 
dysfunction had slightly increased systemic clearance and faster elimination half-time compared to 
subjects with no hepatic dysfunction (n = 3). There were more smokers among subjects with cirrhosis 
(4/6; 67 %) than among subjects with no hepatic dysfunction (0/3; 0 %). 
 15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Smoking 
In non-smoking versus smoking subjects (males and females) the mean elimination half-life was 
prolonged (38.6 versus 30.4 hr) and the clearance was reduced (18.6 versus 27.7 l/hr). 
The plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in elderly versus young subjects, in females versus males, 
and in non-smokers versus smokers. However, the magnitude of the impact of age, gender, or smoking 
on olanzapine clearance and half-life is small in comparison to the overall variability between 
individuals.  
In a study of Caucasians, Japanese, and Chinese subjects, there were no differences in the 
pharmacokinetic parameters among the three populations. 
Paediatric population 
Adolescents (ages 13 to 17 years): The pharmacokinetics of olanzapine are similar between 
adolescents and adults. In clinical studies, the average olanzapine exposure was approximately 27% 
higher in adolescents. Demographic differences between the adolescents and adults include a lower 
average body weight and fewer adolescents were smokers. Such factors possibly contribute to the 
higher average exposure observed in adolescents. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Acute (single-dose) toxicity 
Signs of oral toxicity in rodents were characteristic of potent neuroleptic compounds: hypoactivity, 
coma, tremors, clonic convulsions, salivation, and depressed weight gain. The median lethal doses 
were approximately 210 mg/kg (mice) and 175 mg/kg (rats). Dogs tolerated single oral doses up to 
100 mg/kg without mortality. Clinical signs included sedation, ataxia, tremors, increased heart rate, 
labored respiration, miosis, and anorexia. In monkeys, single oral doses up to 100 mg/kg resulted in 
prostration and, at higher doses, semi-consciousness. 
Repeated-dose toxicity  
In studies up to 3 months duration in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs, the predominant effects 
were CNS depression, anticholinergic effects, and peripheral haematological disorders. Tolerance 
developed to the CNS depression. Growth parameters were decreased at high doses. Reversible effects 
consistent with elevated prolactin in rats included decreased weights of ovaries and uterus and 
morphologic changes in vaginal epithelium and in mammary gland. 
Haematologic toxicity: Effects on haematology parameters were found in each species, including 
dose-related reductions in circulating leukocytes in mice and non-specific reductions of circulating 
leukocytes in rats; however, no evidence of bone marrow cytotoxicity was found. Reversible 
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or anaemia developed in a few dogs treated with 8 or 10 mg/kg/day 
(total olanzapine exposure [area under the curve] is 12- to 15-fold greater than that of a man given a 
12-mg dose). In cytopenic dogs, there were no adverse effects on progenitor and proliferating cells in 
the bone marrow.  
Reproductive toxicity 
Olanzapine had no teratogenic effects. Sedation affected mating performance of male rats. Estrous 
cycles were affected at doses of 1.1 mg/kg (3 times the maximum human dose) and reproduction 
parameters were influenced in rats given 3 mg/kg (9 times the maximum human dose). In the offspring 
of rats given olanzapine, delays in foetal development and transient decreases in offspring activity 
levels were seen. 
Mutagenicity 
Olanzapine was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a full range of standard tests, which included bacterial 
mutation tests and in vitro and in vivo mammalian tests. 
Carcinogenicity 
Based on the results of studies in mice and rats, it was concluded that olanzapine is not carcinogenic.

1.  What ZYPREXA VELOTAB is and what it is used for 
ZYPREXA VELOTAB contains the active substance olanzapine. ZYPREXA VELOTAB belongs to a 
group of medicines called antipsychotics and is used to treat the following conditions: 
•  Schizophrenia, a disease with symptoms such as hearing, seeing or sensing things which are not 
there, mistaken beliefs, unusual suspiciousness, and becoming withdrawn. People with this 
disease may also feel depressed, anxious or tense. 
•  Moderate to severe manic episodes, a condition with symptoms of excitement or euphoria. 
ZYPREXA VELOTAB has been shown to prevent recurrence of these symptoms in patients with 
bipolar disorder whose manic episode has responded to olanzapine treatment. 
2.  What you need to know before you take ZYPREXA VELOTAB  
Do not take ZYPREXA VELOTAB 
• 
If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to olanzapine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). An allergic reaction may be recognised as a rash, itching, a swollen face, 
swollen lips or shortness of breath. If this has happened to you, tell your doctor.  
If you have been previously diagnosed with eye problems such as certain kinds of glaucoma 
(increased pressure in the eye).

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide with an estimated 1 
million newly diagnosed cases and 880 000 deaths each year. Non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of all lung cancer cases. Progress has been made in 
the clinical management of early stage NSCLC by establishing comprehensive, multi-modality 
treatment regimens; however, the prognosis for advanced disease has not improved 
substantially. With an overall 5-year survival rate of 9% to 13%, the treatment of NSCLC 
remains a highly unmet medical need. 
According to the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines, first-line treatment 
with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), erlotinib or gefitinib, should be prescribed to patients with 
tumours bearing an activating (sensitising) epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation 
because of significantly higher response rate (RR), longer progression free survival (PFS), and 
better quality of life (QoL) when compared with first-line chemotherapy. Platinum-based 
combination chemotherapy prolongs survival, improves QoL, and controls symptoms. This 
platinum chemotherapy is the backbone treatment for patients not candidates to be treated with 
TKIs. Patients with NSCLC harbouring an anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement 
should be considered for crizotinib. 
The frequency of somatic EGFR mutations was reported to be about 10% in patients with NSCLC 
from the US, Europe or Australia and up to 30% in patients with NSCLC from Japan and Taiwan. 
The 2 most common mutations account for about 90% of EGFR mutations observed in NSCLC 
specimens. These are an in-frame deletion in exon 19, leading to loss of amino acids E746 to 
A750 (Del 19), and a point mutation in exon 21, resulting in an amino acid substitution (L858R). 
Despite the initial clinical response to reversible EGFR TKIs, patients almost invariably develop 
resistance to these inhibitors and their tumours relapse. 
Giotrif (afatinib) is an irreversible inhibitor of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases (TKI). 
It covalently binds to and blocks signalling from all homo- and heterodimers formed by the ErbB 
family members EGFR (ErbB1), HER 2 (ErbB2), ErbB3 and ErbB4. Aberrant ErbB signalling 
triggered by receptor mutations, and/or amplification, and/or receptor ligand overexpression 
contributes to the malignant phenotype. The recommended dose is 40 mg once daily.  
The claimed therapeutic indication is: 
GIOTRIF is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation(s). 
The approved indication is: 
Giotrif as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 
(EGFR) TKI-naïve adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) with activating EGFR mutation(s). 
The Applicant has received Scientific Advice by the CHMP on clinical issues in January 2007, 
December 2007 and December 2008. The CHMP gave advice in relation to the pivotal trial LUX 
Lung 3, and the supportive trial LUX lung 1.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets containing 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg or 50 
mg of afatinib (INN) (as dimaleate) as active substance. The other ingredients for the core-
tablets are: lactose monohydrate, cellulose microcrystalline, silica colloidal anhydrous, 
crospovidone and magnesium stearate. The film-coating consists of hypromellose, macrogol 400, 
titanium dioxide, indigo carmine (except for the 20 mg film-coated tablets) and polysorbate 80.  
The film-coated tablets are marketed in perforated blister card consisting of a PVC/PVDC forming 
sheet and an aluminium lidding foil as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active substance  
The chemical name of afatinib dimaleate is (2E)-N-[4-(3-chloro-4-fluoroanilino)-7-{[(3S)-oxolan-
3-yl]oxy}quinoxazolin-6-yl]-4-(dimethylamino)but-2-enamide and has the following structure: 
Afatinib  dimaleate  is  a  white  to  brownish  yellow  powder.  It  exists  as  a  salt  (dimaleate)  and  is 
highly  soluble  in  water.  The  highest  solubility  in  organic  solvents  is  observed  in  DMSO  then  in 
methanol.  For  most  of  the  other  organic  solvents  solubility  is  less  than  1  mg/ml.  It  is  highly 
soluble in aqueous buffer media with a pH of less than 6.  The solubility of afatinib dimaleate is 
pH-dependent.  It  was  noted  that  the  free  base  has  two  ionizable  groups  due  to  presence  of  a 
dimethylamine and a quinazoline moiety. 
Afatinib  dimaleate  is  obtained  as  the  crystalline  anhydrous  form  A.  Afatinib  contains  a  chiral 
center within the furanoyl moiety in the 3S configuration. Furthermore, the 2-buteneamide sub-
structure  allows  for  E/Z  isomerism.  The  active  substance  is  manufactured  and  exists  as  the  E-
isomer. The enantiomeric purity of this active substance is controlled routinely by HPLC. 
The  chemical  structure  elucidation  has  been  performed  by  infrared  spectroscopy,  ultraviolet 
spectroscopy,  1H  NMR  spectroscopy,  13C  NMR  spectroscopy,  X-ray  powder diffraction,  and  mass 
spectrometry.  The  data  from  1H  NMR  spectroscopy  clearly  prove  the  E  configuration  of  the  2-
buteneamide  moiety.  The  results  of  the  elemental  analysis  are  consistent  with  the  proposed 
molecular formula (C32H 33ClFN5O11).

Manufacture 
The manufacturing process consists of six main synthetic steps including formation of the 
dimaleate salt and its crystallisation using well defined starting materials with acceptable 
specifications.  
The designation of the starting materials for the synthesis of the active substance has been 
justified with respect to their impurity profiles, their potential for a carry-over into the final active 
substance, their structural complexity and with respect to their proximity to the final 
intermediate and the drug substance, respectively.  
Information provided describes adequately the manufacturing including reactions conditions, 
quantities of raw materials and yields.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the EU 
guideline on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well 
discussed with regards to their origins and were characterised. The carry-over of impurities, 
reagents, solvents and catalysts from the starting material into the final active substance has 
been discussed. Discussion about the impurities confirmed that there is no identified genotoxic 
risk.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control 
methods for intermediates, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The S configuration of afatinib is derived from the stereochemistry of one of the starting 
materials. The other proposed starting materials contain no chiral centres or olefinic double 
bonds that could result in stereoisomers. The correct absolute configuration S of the chiral centre 
for afatinib has been confirmed by the analysis of enantiomeric purity (polarimetry and chiral gas 
chromatography). Based on the synthetic steps, it has been justified and confirmed that a 
racemisation or inversion cannot occur. 
Regarding polymorphism, Forms A and B are the only under ambient conditions stable forms. 
Anhydrous form A and form B, do not directly transform into each other, both forms represent 
two totally independent crystalline modifications. Form A and form B are hygroscopic. Due to its 
more favourable physicochemical properties form A has been selected for development. Very 
similar and high solubility of forms A and B was observed under physiological conditions. 
Differentiation between the different forms is possible by means of differential scanning 
calorimetry (DSC), microscopy or X-ray powder diffraction. 
The active substance is packaged in a closed plastic (low density polyethylene) bag, placed in a 
moisture-protecting aluminium laminated pouch. This pouch is heat-sealed and finally packaged 
into a labelled fibre drum prior to storage and shipping. Specifications and description of the 
methods for polyethylene film and for the seal bags from aluminium laminated have been 
providedThe materials in contact with the active substance comply with the EC directive 
2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance (visual), identification (IR, UV, 
and HPLC), impurities (HPLC), enantiomeric purity (HPLC), nickel content (atomic absorption

spectroscopy), residual solvents (GC), water (Karl-Fischer), sulphated ash (Ph.Eur.), afatinib 
assay (HPLC) and maleic acid assay (titration). 
A detailed description for all analytical methods was provided. Full method validation data was 
also provided for the in-house analytical methods in accordance with the relevant ICH Guidelines. 
The analytical methods proposed are suitable to control the quality of the active substance. The 
impurity limits are acceptable and there is no concern from the point of view of safety.  
Batch analysis data of forty seven batches used in clinical, toxicological and stability studies of 
the active substance are provided. The results are within the specification and consistent from 
batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability  data  on  three  commercial-scale  batches  of  the  active  substance  from  the  proposed 
commercial manufacturer and stored in the intended commercial packaging for  24 months under 
long-term conditions at 25°C/60% RH and 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40°C/75% 
RH. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance (visual), impurities (HPLC), enantiomeric 
purity (HPLC), water (Karl-Fisher) and afatinib assay (HPLC).  
The stability of afatinib in solution as well as in the solid state has been investigated under stress 
conditions (different pH, oxidative, elevated temperature in dry and humid conditions) in order to 
identify potential major degradation pathways and to assess the overall chemical stability of this 
new  molecular  entity.  Degradation  was  seen  under  weak  acidic  to  neutral  media  and  oxidation 
conditions. 
Photostability  study  under  ICH  Q1B  conditions  has  been  performed.  Results  showed  that 
irradiation of the active substance in the solid state stimulates isomerisation reactions.  
The  stability  results  indicate  that  the  active  substance  is  sufficiently  stable  at  controlled  room 
temperature and protected from light and moisture. The results justify the proposed retest period 
in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product  
Pharmaceutical development 
The primary goal was to develop the finished product as a solid oral dosage form, combined with 
the  clinical  requirement  for  a  reliable  drug  release  as  well  as  patient  acceptability  (easy-to-
swallow dosage form that disintegrates only in the gastric environment) and safe handling of the 
drug  by  caregivers.  Based  on  those  requirements  and  the  physicochemical  properties  of  the 
active substances, a film-coated tablet formulation was developed. 
As already mentioned the active substance is soluble in water and aqueous media throughout the 
physiological  pH  range  from  pH  1-7.5.  In  the  development  and  manufacture  of  the  finished 
product, the anhydrous form (Form A) has been selected. Form A is the preferred form over form 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/491185/2013 
Page 8/129 
 
 
 
  
  
B  since  it  can  be  better  processed  and  has  better  physical  stability  especially  with  regard  to 
hygroscopicity. 
The  rationale  for  the  choice  of  excipients  is  sufficiently  detailed.  The  excipients  selected  are 
commonly  used  in  oral  commercial  pharmaceutical  dosage  forms.  All  the  excipients  are 
compendial  except  for  the  colorant  indigo  carmine  which  complies  with  EC  directive  95/45  as 
amended. 
Compatibility between the active substance and the excipients was extensively studied. The drug 
product  stability  data  demonstrate  compatibility  between  the  active  substance  and  the  chosen 
excipients  including  the  colour  pigment  and  support  their  use  in  the  intended  commercial 
formulation. 
The formulation development from the early trial formulations (TF1) to the final formulations (FF) 
have been described. The final composition was adjusted and optimised for the excipients during 
the  formulation  development  to  reach  the  best  quality  for  the  final  film-coated  tablets. 
Downsizing  of  the  tablet  dimensions  by  optimising  the  drug  load  of  the  tablets  was  made  to 
improve patient acceptability.  
The development of the dissolution method has been discussed and the method well described. 
The  dissolution  profiles  of  different  dosage  strengths  have  been  tested  at  different  pH  values. 
The  solubility  of  afatinib  dimaleate  is  high  throughout  the  physiological  pH  range  from  pH  1  to 
7.5. Media in this range provided sufficient solubility of the drug substance for sink conditions for 
the  intended  commercial  dosage  strengths  20  mg,  30  mg,  40  mg  and  50  mg.  The  results 
demonstrate comparable dissolution profiles independent of the dosage strength. All four dosage 
strengths  of  the  final  formulation  are  deemed  equivalent.  The  discriminatory  power  of  the 
dissolution method has been demonstrated. 
The  final  formulation  was identical  to  the  clinical trial  formulation  except  for  the  addition  of the 
colorant  to  the  non-functional  film-coat  of  the  tablets.  The  manufacturing  process  development 
has  been  thoroughly  discussed,  including  the  evaluation  and    the  optimisation  of  the  main  
process  steps    including  dry  granulation  of  the  active  substance,  dry  blending  of  the  active 
substance  (dry  granulate)  with  the  excipients,  subsequent  compression  into  tablets  and  finally 
film-coating of the tablet cores, including final drying. The tablet cores of the final formulation for 
all  strengths  are  manufactured  from  a  common  blend.  Thus,  the  different  dose  strengths  are 
proportionally  similar  to  each  other.  The  primary  packaging  is  a  blister/pouch  packaging.    The 
blister  card  consists  of  a  polymer  bottom  foil  and  a  lidding  foil.  The  bottom  foil  is  a  laminate 
double layer foil, with an outer polyvinyl chloride (PVC) film and an inner polyvinylidene chloride 
(PVDC)  film  whereas  the  lidding  foil  is  an  aluminium  foil.  An  additional  pouch  is  used  as  a 
secondary packing system containing a molecular sieve sachet as desiccant. This pouch consists 
of a three-ply laminated aluminium foil, with an outer polyester (PE) film, an aluminium foil, and 
an  inner  polyethylene  (PET)  film.  The  materials  comply  with  the  Ph.Eur  and  EC  requirements. 
The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate 
for the intended use of the product.

Adventitious agents 
The  only  ingredient  from  animal  origin  is  lactose.  It  is  confirmed  that  the  lactose  is  produced 
from  milk  from  healthy  animals  in  the  same  condition  as  those  use  to  collect  milk  for  human 
consumption and the lactose has been prepared without the use of ruminant material other than 
calf  rennet  according  to  the  Note  for  Guidance  on  Minimising  the  Risk  for  Transmitting  Animal 
Spongiform Encephalopathy Via Human and veterinary medicinal products.  
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process consists of five main steps: dry granulation, blending, tableting, film-
coating and packaging. At the end of the process, the tablets are dried to reduce residual 
moisture so that long-term stability of the drug product is improved. The process is considered to 
be a standard manufacturing process.  
Flow diagrams of the manufacturing process, including in-process controls, are provided in the 
dossier. A brief narrative description of each manufacturing step is also provided as well as 
information related to the equipment used.  
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies on three 
consecutive full-scale validation batches for each of the four different strengths. The 
manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a 
reproducible manner. 
The in-process controls applied are adequate for this pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification  
The finished product release and end of shelf-life specifications include appropriate tests for this 
solid oral dosage form: appearance (visual), identification (UV and HPLC), water content (Karl-
Fisher), assay (HPLC), uniformity of dosage (Ph.Eur.), impurities (HPLC), dissolution (HPLC), 
microbiological quality (Ph.Eur.). 
Batch analysis data of forty seven batches used in clinical, toxicological and stability studies of 
the finished product for each strength are provided. The results confirm the consistency of the 
process and its ability to manufacture a product complying with the product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of three production-scale batches of the highest and the lowest dosestrength for 
the  finished product stored under long term conditions for 24 months at 25°C/60 % RH and for 
6 months under accelerated conditions at 40°C/75 % RH according to ICH guidelines were 
provided. The stability study were conducted in accordance with the ICH guideline Q1A(R2) and 
the ICH Q1D "Bracketing and Matrixing" using a reduced stability design for the intermediate 
dosage strengths of 30 mg and 40 mg.  The bracketing was acceptable since the film-coated 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/491185/2013

tablets of the four strengths are packaged in identical container closure. The only slightly 
difference is the colorant in the film-coat. The batches of the medicinal product are identical to 
those intended for marketing and were packed in the proposed marketed blister pack. 
Stress stability studies were performed on one fully representative batch each of film-coated 
tablets 20 mg and 50 mg to assess the influence of heat and humidity. In addition, two 
representative batches each of the same strengths were exposed to light as defined in the ICH 
Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. 
Samples were tested for:  appearance (visual), water content (Karl-Fisher), dissolution (HPLC), 
resistance to crushing, degradation, assay (HPLC), and microbiological purity (Ph.Eur.). The 
analytical procedures are stability indicating. 
All results meet the proposed shelf-life acceptance criteria. Stress studies showed that the 
finished product is sensitive to excessive heat and humidity, and is sensitive to light exposure 
therefore needs to be kept in its primary packaging material. The results remained within the 
specification during the bulk studies.  
Based on the available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC 
are acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished 
product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The potential impurities, by products of the 
synthesis and degradation products, have been discussed in detail and do not raise any safety 
concern. The goal of the pharmaceutical development was to obtain film-coated tablets with a 
good acceptability profile. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects  
Based on the data provided the quality of this medicinal product is considered to be acceptable. 
Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the 
product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
All pivotal safety pharmacology and toxicology studies were carried out in compliance with GLP 
regulations. All other studies are considered also to be of sufficient quality. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The in vitro potency and selectivity of afatinib (BIBW 2992) has been determined in enzymatic 
assays using human recombinant protein kinase domains. Afatinib proved to be a kinase inhibitor 
with an IC50 of 0.5 nM on EGFR, 14 nM on HER2 and 1 nM on ErbB4.

To assess selectivity, the inhibitory activity of afatinib on related tyrosine kinases was examined. 
Enzymes from class II, IV and VII receptor tyrosine kinases, represented by BIRK, VEGFR-2 and 
HGFR, as well as the non-receptor type tyrosine kinases c-src, Lck, Lyn were used for the 
analysis (see Table 1).

Similarly, a set of 27 serine/threonine kinases comprising MKK-1, ERK2, JNK/SAPK1c, 
SAPK2α/p38α, SAPK2βp38β, SAPK3/p38γ, SAPK4/p38δ, PKBα/AKT, SGL, S6K1, GSK3β, ROCK II,

CDK2/cyclinA, CK-I and DYRK1α was tested and was essentially unaffected by the presence of 
10 µM afatinib in the assay. 
In short-term receptor phosphorylation studies, it has been confirmed that afatinib attains the 
inhibition at low nanomolar concentrations in serum starved cells with: EC50 = 13 nM in A431 
EGFR cells and EC50 = 35 nM in BT-474 HER2 cells. In the same way afatinib inhibits 
proliferation of NCI-N87 and BT-474 cells in a 72-hour cell growth assay with EC50= 4 and 
EC50=12 nM, respectively.  
The pharmacological inhibition of receptor activation by reversible EGFR inhibitors was shown to 
be more short-lived, with cells recovering after an 8 hour washout period, as compared to cells 
treated with afatinib or other irreversible inhibitors. After treatment with irreversible inhibitors 
cells recovered within 48 h. These results support the hypothesis that irreversible binding to the 
kinase is associated with a more long-lasting inhibitory effect. 
The possibility that afatinib might be active on T790M containing EGFR mutants known to be 
resistant to erlotinib and gefitinib was initially supported in molecular kinase assays. Further in 
vitro experiments with afatinib using NSCLC cell lines with activating EGFR mutations, including 
those resistant to first generation inhibitors, such as T790M or exon 20 insertions showed that 
afatinib is able to inhibit receptor activation and cell proliferation (see Tables 2 and 3).

Additional cellular studies were conducted to assess the inhibitory potency of afatinib and 
erlotinib on autophosphorylation of several uncommon EGFR mutants expressed in transfected 
mouse NIH/3T3 fibroblasts (parental NIH/3T3 cells do not express ErbB receptors).  These 
included variants harbouring point mutations in exons 18, 20 and 21 encoding the kinase domain 
of EGFR (G719S, T790M, L861Q), exon 20 insertions (WASVins770, D770_N771insNPG, 
P772_H773insV, WHins774) and activating missense mutations in exons 1, 7 and 15 encoding 
the extracellular domain of EGFR (R108K, A289D, A289T, A289V, G598V) (see Figure 1).

Figure 1. Effect of afatinib and erlotinib treatment on EGFR-Y1068 phosphorylation in NIH/3T3 
cells ectopically expressing EGFR mutants 
The in vivo activity of afatinib has been assessed in a variety of tumour xenograft models in 
immunodeficient nude mice.  
The NCI H1975 NSCLC cell line carries an activating mutation in the EGFR (L858R) as well as the 
T790M mutation reported to confer resistance to gefitinib and erlotinib. Growth of established 
NCI-H1975 tumours in nude mice was fully inhibited by treatment with afatinib. In the NCI-
H1781 tumour cell line harbouring activating mutations within the HER2 kinase domain 
(HER2G776insV G/C) afatinib was shown to have efficacy in this model. Transgenic mice 
expressing either HER2YVMA or EGFRL858R/T790M in the lung develop massive lung carcinomas within 
a few weeks after birth and treatment of these tumour-bearing mice with afatinib resulted in 
partial tumour regressions. 
In the MDA-MB-453 breast carcinoma model characterised by HER2 gene amplification and 
sensitivity to trastuzumab, treatment with afatinib resulted in complete suppression of tumour 
growth (T/C = 3 %). In the HER2-overexpressing, trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer model 
SUM 190, afatinib strongly inhibited tumour growth with a T/C value of 11 %, indicating a role 
for EGFR signaling in trastuzumab resistance. Treatment of mice carrying estrogen dependent 
MCF-7 xenografts resulted in moderate inhibition of tumour growth (T/C = 48%; [02-04]). In a 
model of triple-negative breast cancer (SUM 149), afatinib was highly efficacious (T/C = 5%).  
In mice carrying EGFR-overexpressing A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells, afatinib was effective 
(T/C = 2%) and induced tumour regressions. In the ovarian cancer model SKOV 3 (HER2 gene

amplification) as well as the HER2-overexpressing NCI N87 gastric cancer model, treatment with 
afatinib achieved T/C values of 3 % and 0-4 %, respectively.  
A comparison of the anti-tumour efficacies and systemic exposure in xenografted mice treated 
with various doses of afatinib shows that the necessary maximum plasma concentration in nude 
mice to reach full antitumour activity (defined as T/C < 10 %) was 80-285 nM and the 
corresponding AUC(0-24h) was 1.1-3.2 µM.h (see Table 5).

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In a battery of binding assays comprising 50 non-peptide receptors, peptide receptors, nuclear 
receptors, ion channels and amine transporters, afatinib inhibited two receptors by more than 
50 % when tested at 5µM; binding of cimetidine to H2 receptors and pirenzepine to M1 receptors 
which were inhibited by 68 % and 78 %, respectively. 
In vivo studies revealed different degrees of effects of afatinib on blood pressure, heart rate, 
contractility, kidney and liver as well as on gastric emptying, secretion and motility: A small 
(~10%) but significant increase in systolic blood pressure at 100 mg/kg in rats with a non-
significant trend at lower doses (10 and 30 mg/kg). The effect was persistent indicating a long 
duration of action. Heart rate was slightly and transiently increased at the highest dose. No 
effects were seen on body temperature, respiration rate, tidal volume and motility. The 
contractility (LVdP/dt max) was decreased in minipigs after iv administration of afatinib at 6.65 
(trend) and 20 mg/kg (p<0.0001) and an exposure of ~6 times and ~35 times the Cmaxss of 
~0.2 µM achieved in humans after 50mg/day, respectively (1200 nmol/L and 7110 nmol/L). 
However, no effects were seen on blood pressure and heart rate or the ECG intervals (QT, PR 
and QRS interval). Single oral administration of afatinib to rats at 30, 100 and 300 mg/kg, 
increased urinary glucose excretion after 4h up to 24h, and led to enhanced serum glucose levels 
at a dose of 300 mg/kg. At this dose increases in serum and urine enzymes were also observed, 
suggesting liver and renal toxicity. Afatinib reduced gastric emptying in rats at doses of 100 and 
300 mg/kg (196% and 430%, respectively). Intraduodenally administration of 30-300 mg/kg BW 
reduced the gastric secretion parameters juice volume and acid output dose-dependently 
(significantly different from control only at 300 mg/kg), responses that might indicate effects of 
afatinib via the H2 receptors at high dose levels.

Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety  pharmacology  studies  conducted  with  afatinib  included  an  assessment  of  effects  of  the 
product  on  CNS  and  respiratory  system  in  rats  following  oral  administration,  as  well  as  on 
cardiovascular system in minipigs following repeat oral administration. Also, it was evaluated the 
in vitro potential of afatinib to inhibit hERG current. 
Cardiovascular: In vitro afatinib was shown to have a low potential to inhibit HERG, with an IC50 
of 2.4 µM and did not affect the action potential duration (APD) in Isolated Guinea pig papillary 
muscle at concentrations up to 10 µM. A slight, timedependent, reversible increase of the heart 
rate that correlated with a shortening of the QT interval was observed in mini pigs at doses of 
2.45 and 6 mg/kg (Cmax 35-85 and 70-185 nmol/L, respectively) without any effects on ECG 
morphology.  
Respiratory: No significant effects on respiration rate, tidal volume or minute volume were seen 
in male or female rats at doses up to 18 mg/kg, except for decrease in minute volume in male 
rats at 18 mg base/kg, 240 minutes post-dose. This effect is not considered to be relevant for 
the clinical situation. 
CNS: Effects on the nervous system was investigated in rats where no significant changes were 
seen in the behaviour, physiological state, spontaneous locomotor activity or body temperature 
after doses up to 18 mg/kg. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies with afatinib have been submitted. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  pharmacokinetics  and  drug  metabolism  of  afatinib  were  studied  in  male  and  female  mice, 
male and female rats, female rabbits and male and female minipigs, including excretion balance 
and biliary excretion as well as investigations on metabolite profiles in plasma, urine, faeces and 
bile. Afatinib was formulated as a suspension / solution in all animal studies.  Aqueous solutions 
of afatinib were used as oral and intravenous formulations. 
Absorption 
The  absorption  in  vivo  of  afatinib  was  evaluated  in  rats  and  minipigs  following  single  oral  and 
intravenous  administration  and 
following  single  oral  administration.  The 
in 
pharmacokinetics parameters resulted in these studies are given in Table 6.

Distribution 
Tissue distribution 
The distribution of afatinib in the tissues was studied in albino and pigmented male rats by whole 
body  autoradiography  after  single  intravenous  or  oral  dosing  of  to  4  mg/kg  or  of  8  mg/kg 
[14C]afatinib,  in  male  albino  rats  by  tissue  dissection  after  repeated  oral  dosing  of  3  mg/kg 
[14C]afatinib    and  in  minipigs  also  by  tissue  dissection  after  a  single  oral  dose  of  2.46  mg/kg 
(5.06 μmol/kg) [14C]afatinib. 
The  results  indicated  that  afatinib  was  rapidly  and  well  distributed  from  blood  into  most  of  the 
tissues  except  for  the  central  nervous  system  (CNS)  since  the  blood-brain  barrier  was  crossed 
only to a very small extent. 
In rats, the distribution of afatinib after oral administration was qualitatively similar to that after 
intravenous  administration  but  on  a  lower  level.  Also  it  was  similar  between  pigmented  and 
albino rats. However, in pigmented rats, the concentration of afatinib in the retina of the eye was 
very high and kept constant over the investigation period. 
In Table 7 is shown the tissue distribution of afatinib after repeat oral administration of 3 mg/kg 
of [14C]afatinib for 13 days to male rats.

In  minipigs,  at  168  h  after  oral  administration  of  [14C]afatinib  MA2,  afatinib  was  recovered 
principally  in  the  livers,  spleen  and  testis  in  both  males  and  females.  Similar  to  findings  in  the 
rat, afatinib was found in the retina of the minipigs at 168 h after dosing. 
Protein binding and distribution in blood cells. 
The  mean  plasma  protein  binding  of  afatinib,  which  was  not  saturable,  was  91.8%  in  rabbits 
(Himalayan),  92.6%  in  rat  (Wistar),  92.9%  in  minipig  (Göttingen),  94.3%  in  mouse  (NMRI), 
94.6%  in  mouse  (CD-1),  92.7%  in  transgenic  CByB6F1rasH2  mice,  94.9%  in  non-transgenic 
CByB6F1rasH2 mice and 95% in human, over a concentration range of 0.05-0.5 μM.  
In  vitro,  binding  of  afatinib  MA2  to  isolated  human  serum  albumin  (45  g/L)  was  moderate 
(79.6%)  and  binding  to  human  alpha-1-acid-glycoprotein  (AGP)  increased  with  the  protein 
concentration from 11.6 % (0.1 g/L AGP) to 90.6 % (10 g/L AGP). 
Distribution  of  afatinib  between  blood  cells  and  plasma  (CC/CP)  was  evaluated  in  vitro  by 
incubation  of  [14C]afatinib  in  blood  of  rats,  minipigs  and  human.  Afatinib  was  distributed 
predominantly into blood cells, as indicated by a CC/CP higher than 1. A species difference in the 
extent of this distribution was observe, with CC/CP between 4.95 and 6.38 in rat, 5.07 and 2.98 
in  minipigs  or  2.21  and  1.02  in  human  blood,  (CC/CP  values  2  min  and  3  hours  after  spiking, 
respectively). 
In other ADME studies, for all investigated species, a time-dependent increase of distribution of 
[14C]afatinib into blood cells has been found. In rats, the mean CC/CP increased from 7.6 at time 
point  0.5  h  after  dosing  to  193  at  24  h.  In  minipigs,  CC/CP  increased  from  5  at  time  point  6  h 
after dosing to 28 at 168 h. For rabbits, the respective data are 2.5 at 1 h increasing to 7.4 at 96 
h.  
Covalent binding to protein 
X-ray structure analysis of EGFR in complex with afatinib has revealed that afatinib exhibits the 
structure of anα,β-unsaturated ketone and covalently binds to Cys797 in EGFR. 
This  covalent  binding  of  [14C]afatinib  resulted  in  the  formation  of  covalent  adducts  to  protein, 
like haemoglobin, as has been demonstrated in vitro in plasma and whole blood of rats, as well in 
vivo studies in plasma protein of rats, minipigs, rabbits, mice and human. 
The  covalently  bound  protein  adducts  are  formed  by  Michael  acceptors  because  of  theα,β-
unsaturated  ketone  structural  moiety.  Since  the  adduct  formation  via  Michael  addition  is  a 
chemical  equilibrium,  covalent  protein  adducts  can  decay  under  release  of  the  α,β-unsaturated 
ketone-structured  parent  compound,  as  has  been  demonstrated  in  incubation  experiments  at 
37°C using an aqueous solution of adduct of [14C]afatinib to human serum albumin. 
Placenta transfer studies 
In pregnant rats was studied the tissue distribution and elimination kinetics of [14C]afatinib after 
oral  administration,  showing  that  the  absorption,  distribution  and  elimination  kinetics  was 
independent of stage of gestation. Afatinib was  widely distributed in tissues and organs, except 
the  brain  and,  in  placenta,  the  concentration  was  approx.  2-fold  higher  than  blood,  also 
independent of the gestation stage.  
No  relevant  levels  of  [14C]afatinib  were  found  in  embryos  and  foetuses  except  very  low 
concentrations in foetal liver. 
Metabolism 
In vivo metabolism was studied in rats, mice, minipigs, rabbits and healthy human subjects after 
oral administration of [14C]afatinib and in bile and urine samples of rats after i.v. dosing.

Metabolism as excretion pathway was of subordinate importance in all species when compared to 
the excretion of the unchanged parent compound that accounted for > 50%, > 60 %, > 72%, > 
87% and > 88% in the rat, mouse, minipig, rabbit and human, respectively. Likewise, the total 
number of metabolites (ten) that were observed in the excreta of all species at amounts > 1% of 
the administered dose was relatively small. There were only minor differences in the metabolite 
pattern  between  the  investigated  species,  excreta  metabolism  pattern,  and  plasma  metabolism 
pattern. 
Based  on  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  studies,  the  metabolism  of  afatinib  can  be  subdivided  into  three 
reactions:  conjugate  formation  via  Michael  addition,  enzymatic  phase  I  metabolism  (oxidation: 
N-oxide  formation  (dimethylamino  moiety)  by  FMO3,  oxidative  N-demethylation,  by  CYP3A4, 
oxidative  O-dealkylation 
side-chain  N-dealkylation 
(dimethylamino  moiety)  followed  by  oxidation,  side-chain  (amide  bond)  cleavage  and  oxidative 
defluorination)  and  conjugation  of  phase  I  metabolites  (O-glucuronidation  after  oxidative  O-

to oxidative N-demethylation).

Excretion in milk of the lactating rats  
Female  Wistar  were  administered  a  single  oral  dose  of  4  mg/kg  [14C]afatinib  on  Day  11  of 
lactation.  The  concentrations  of  total  radioactivity  in  plasma  and  in  the  milk  of  the  dams  were 
followed up to 48 h post administration.

The average afatinib concentrations in milk at time points 1 h and 6 h post dose (1220 and 2130 
nmol/L, respectively) were approximately 80 and 150-fold above the respective concentration in 
plasma (15.6 and 14.3 nmol/L), indicating a rapid and pronounced transfer to milk. At 24 h and 
48  h  post  dose,  mean  afatinib  concentrations  were  84.7  and  10.9  nmol/L  in  milk  whereas  the 
concentrations in plasma were below the limit of detection. 
The  individual  AUC0-24h  of  radioactivity  in  milk  ranged  from  17700  to  40100  nmol*h/L,  which 
was more than 100-fold above the individual estimated plasma AUC0-24h (118 to 284 nmol*h/L). 
The estimated amount of total radioactivity secreted into milk within 24 h was about 2.4 to 5.0% 
of the dose administered to the dams. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Inhibition of cytochrome P-450 enzymes 
Concentrations  up  to  100  μM  of  afatinib  did  not  show  potent  inhibition  of  the  most  relevant 
cytochrome  P450  isoenzymes  for  drug  metabolism  in  human,  CYP1A1/2,  CYP2A6,  CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 CYP3A4 and CYP4A11. 
Inhibition of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes 
The glucuronidation of ß-estradiol was investigated by using human liver microsomes or 
expressed UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1. In this way, ß-estradiol was incubated with 
human liver microsomes (50 μM) in the presence of potential inhibitors of UGT enzymes at 
different concentrations (0-200 μM). The 3-glucuronidation of ß-estradiol is mediated selectively 
by UGT1A1, whereas the formation of the 17-glucuronide of ß-estradiol is catalysed 
predominantly but not exclusively by UGT2B7. Consequently, expressed UDP-
glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 catalysed the formation of ß-estradiol-3-glucuronide. 
The quantitative data of the formation of ß-estradiol 3- and 17-glucuronide formation were used 
for the calculation of IC50 data for the inhibitors, as it shown in Table 9. 
Table 9. Inhibition data of potential inhibitors of UGT enzymes. 
Enzyme induction study in rats 
The administration of afatinib, at dose levels of 4 and 8.5 mg/kg, orally to five male Wistar rats 
once daily for 4 days caused no induction of CYPIA, CYP2B, CYP3A, CYP2E1 and CYP4A activities 
and also had no effect on the liver to body weight ratios, total amount of microsomal protein or 
total amount of hepatic cytochrome P450.

In vitro enzyme induction study in human hepatocytes 
A  study  was  conducted  to  evaluate  the  in  vitro  induction  potential of  afatinib MA2  on  six  major 
human  cytochrome  P450  enzymes  in  cultured  primary  human  hepatocytes  from  three  different 
donors. In situ enzyme activities were assessed using selective test substrates and mRNA levels 
were  determined  by  semi-quantitative  real-time  PCR  for  CYP1A2,  CYP2B6,  CYP2C8,  CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19  and  CYP3A4.  Induction  of  in  vitro  enzyme  activity  was  not  found  for  any  of  the  P450 
enzymes  tested  following  treatment  with  up  to  5  μM  afatinib  for  48  h.  No  relevant  induction  of 
mRNA levels was observed for the respective enzymes upon treatment with afatinib. 
Active  uptake  of  afatinib  by  OATP,  OAT  and  OCT  transporters  and  inhibition  of  OATP,  OAT  and 
OCT mediated transport 
In  transfected  HEK293  cell  lines,  that  expressed  the  different  drug  transporters,  was  evaluated 
the  active  transport  of  afatinib  by  OATP,  OAT  and  OCT  drug  transporters.  Afatinib  exhibited  a 
high passive permeability. No a relevant effect of inhibitors on afatinib was observed. Therefore, 
afatinib  was  most  likely  not  a  substrate  of  OATP2,  OATP8,  OATP-B,  OAT1,  OAT3,  OCT1,  OCT2, 
and  OCT3  or  it  was  transported  only  to  such  a  small  extent  that  its  passive  permeability 
markedly  exceeds  the  active,  carrier-mediated  uptake.  Thus,  active  transport  of  afatinib  by 
OATP,  OAT  and  OCT  drug  transporters  is  not  expected  to  be  of  relevance  for  the 
pharmacokinetics of afatinib. 
Also in these studies was evaluated the potential of afatinib, at concentration range of 0-100 μM, 
to inhibit drug transport that is mediated by OATP2, OATP8, OATP-B, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, 
and OCT3. The results are shown in Table 10. 
Table 10. Inhibition of uptake transport of test substrates by afatinib into HEK293 cell lines that 
express OATP2, OATP8, OATP-B, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, and OCT3. 
Passive permeability through CaCo-2 cell monolayers, P-gp transport profiling and inhibition of P-
gp mediated transport 
The  passive  permeability  of  afatinib  in  CaCo-2  cell  monolayers,  its  potential  transport  by  P-gp 
(ABCB1) and the potential inhibition of P-gp by afatinib were assessed. Afatinib MA2 had a high 
intrinsic passive permeability (75-120 nm/s) and was also shown to be both a substrate (Km 10-
30 μM) and a medium-potent inhibitor for the drug efflux pump P-gp. Also it was determined that 
afatinib inhibited the P-gp mediated digoxin transport by CaCo-2 cells with an estimated IC50 of 
24 μM. 
In  transcellular  transport  studies  using  human  P-gp  expressing  LLC-PK1  cells,  the  Km  for  P-gp 
transport was estimated to be 9.3 μM. 
In another study using P-gp expressing LLC-PK1 cells and digoxin as test substrate, the IC50 of 
afatinib on P-gp-mediated transport was 1.6 μM. Due to the different IC50  obtained with CaCo-2

cells  and  LLC-PK1,  additional  experiments  using  a  range  of  afatinib  and  digoxin  concentrations 
were performed. A Ki of 3.4 μM was obtained.

all changes (i.e. except for a very mildly increased hematopoiesis 
in 3 animals and a mild hypertrophy of the serous portion of the 
sublingual gland in one animal) had regressed at 7.0/5.5 mg/kg. 
[The observation of loose stool on one or several days was the 
reason for reducing the dose from 7.0 to 5.5 mg/kg on Day 32.]

In  rats,  toxicokinetic  monitoring  revealed  that  the  exposure  (AUC0-24h)  increased  more  than 
proportionally  to  dose  and  the  plasma  concentrations  of  afatinib  were  higher  in  males  than  in 
females.  Additionally,  accumulation  of  drug  was  observed.  This  accumulation  of  the  drug  could 
explain the more toxicity of afatinib in the repeat-dose toxicity studies performed in rats. 
In  pregnant  rats,  AUC0-24h  increased  slightly  more  than  proportionally  to  dose  but  no 
accumulation was observed.  
In mice and minipigs, no drug accumulation was observed, although at higher doses a more 
than proportional increase in systemic exposure was observed in minipigs, and no sex 
difference in exposure was noted. In pregnant rabbits, also a slight increase in the exposure 
more than proportionally with dose was found but there was no drug accumulation 
As shown it Table 11 the exposure was compared in the repeat-dose toxicity studies performed 
in  rats  and  minipigs,  and  the  exposure  in  embryo-fetal  development  studies,  performed  in  rats 
and in rabbits, with the clinical exposure.

Reproduction Toxicity 
The influence of afatinib on fertility and early embryonic development was investigated in a 
pivotal study in rats together with effects on pre- and postnatal development in rats 
performed in parallel. Embryo foetal developmental toxicity of afatinib was investigated in 
pregnant rats (a non GLP dose range finding study and a pivotal (GLP) study) and in rabbits (a 
dose range finding study as well as a pivotal (GLP) study). The results are summarised in

The  local  dermal  tolerance  of  afatinib  MA2  has  been  evaluated  in  4  female  Chbb:NZW  rabbits 
applied with a single dose of 100 mg for up to 4 h. No noteworthy findings have been found, only 
two  areas  of  very  slight  erythema  were  observed  in  1  animal  immediately  and  4  h  after  a  1  h 
exposure to the test article. Afatinib was classified as non-irritant and non-corrosive. 
Acute eye irritation study in rabbits 
The potential effects of afatinib in eyes were investigated in a single female Crl:KBL(NZW) rabbit 
treated with a single dose of 20 mg afatinib MA2, applied into the conjunctival sac. Immediately 
following application, marked ocular side effects (chemosis, swelling of the eye lids, hyperaemic 
iris  and  conjunctivae)  were  observed,  some of  them  persisting  up  to  Day 17 of  the observation 
period.  Although  no  additional  animal  was  tested  due  to  the  marked  adverse  effects  observed, 
additional  slit  lamp  examinations  revealed  no  findings  on  Day  3  and  Day  18,  but  on  Day  12 
dilated blood vessels of the sclera as well as sprouting of vessels were noted. 
Whereas  no  changes  were  observed  macroscopically  or  histopathologically  in  the  control  right 
eye, macroscopic evaluation of the treated eye at necropsy revealed a red discolouration of the 
third  eyelid.  In  addition,  histopathological  examinations  revealed  changes  of  local  conjunctival 
irritation. Afatinib was classified as an eye irritant.

Other toxicity studies 
Immunotoxicity 
The potential effects of afatinib on the immune system were investigated within the 4-week oral 
rat  toxicity  study.  The  animals  were  dosed  with  0,  4,  8.5,  and  18  mg/kg  (0,  24,  51  and  108 
mg/m2)  of  afatinib.  Samples  from  blood  and  spleen  were  taken  at  treatment,  at  necropsy  and 
recovery  termination  and  analysed  by  flow  cytometry  for  subsets  of  various  leukocyte  cell 
populations.  Natural  killer  cell  activity  was  determined  for  spleen  cells  by  lysis  of  radiolabeled 
target cells. 
Dose-dependent  changes  in  peripheral  blood  and  bone  marrow,  indicative  of  neutrophilia,  were 
seen in both sexes at 8.5 and 18 mg/kg. The percentage of analysed peripheral blood cells was 
reduced at 8.5 and 18 mg/kg. The percentage of monocytes was marginally increased and that 
of B-lymphocytes was decreased at 18 mg/kg. In addition, the percentage of B-lymphocytes was 
significantly lower in the spleen of all drug-treated groups, (statistically significant at 8.5 and 18 
mg/kg).  Activity  of  natural  killer  cells  was  mainly  unaffected  except  for  a  minimally  reduced 
activity  at  18  mg/kg.  Absolute  and  relative  thymus  weight  and  absolute  spleen  weight  were 
significantly lower in males at 18 mg/kg. 
The  described  differences  to  vehicle  control  were  largely  also  seen  at  the  end  of  the  2-week 
recovery  period.  In  view  of  the  marked  and  life-threatening  toxicity  observed  in  high-dose 
animals  at  18  mg/kg,  along  with  numerous  premature  sacrifices/deaths,  the  observed 
immunological  low-grade  changes  may  be  an  unspecific  response  caused  by  the  exaggerated 
toxicity and, therefore, are not regarded to be of relevance for humans. 
Studies on impurities 
Specified impurities present at and above the ICHQ 3A/3B levels in afatinib drug substance 
and/or drug product were adequately qualified in GLP safety studies by in vitro and in vivo 
genotoxicity tests and a 13-week oral repeat-dose toxicity study in rats. 
Photosafety 
In Vitro 3T3 NRU phototoxicity test with afatinib 
The  phototoxic  potential  of  afatinib  for  phototoxicity  was  investigated  in  vitro,  using  the  3T3 
Neutral  Red  Uptake  (NRU)  phototoxicity  test.  Afatinib,  as  dimaleate  salt,  was  dissolved  and 
diluted  in  EBSS  at  neutral  pH  and  concentrations  of  4  mg/mL,  3  mg/ml  and  1  mg/mL.  UV/VIS 
light  absorption  of  afatinib  was  determined  under  irradiation  (Irr)  over  a  spectrum  from  about 
250 nm to 750 nm wavelength. Thereafter, BALB/c 3T3 cells were treated for 1 h with different 
concentrations of the test solution and, in the presence of the test item, for a further 50 min in 
the  absence  (-Irr)  or  in  the  presence  (+Irr)  of  a  nontoxic  dose  of  UVA  light.  1  Day  after 
treatment, cellular uptake of the vital dye Neutral Red (NR) was determined. Reduced cellular NR 
uptake  was  regarded  as  parameter  for  cytotoxicity.  A  second  experiment  was  performed  in  the 
same  way,  but  with  a  modified  concentration  range  of  the  test  item  to  confirm  the  results.  To 
clarify the contradictory results from the first and the second experiment, a third experiment was 
performed with adjusted concentration range. 
In  three  independent  experiments,  afatinib  exerted  cytotoxic  effects  on  BALB/c  3T3  murine 
fibroblast  in  the  absence  and  in  the  presence  of  irradiation.  In  the  first  experiment,  EC 50  was 
calculated as 12.22 μg/mL (-Irr) and as 2.31 μg/mL (+Irr). In the second experiment, EC50 was 
calculated  as  18.98  μg/mL  (-Irr)  and  extrapolated as  10.5  μg/mL  (+  Irr),  since  no  reduction  of 
cell  viability  to  50%  was  obtained  within  the  modified  concentration  range.  In  the  third 
experiment, EC50 was calculated as 17.86 μg/mL (- Irr) and as 8.74 μg/mL (+ Irr). The Photo-
Irritation  Factor  (PIF)  was  calculated  as  5.3  (first  experiment),  as  1.87  (second  experiment, 
using the extrapolated EC50 value) and as 2.04 in the final third experiment.

Thus, according to the OECD guidance, the test item was classified as "probably phototoxic”. 
Maleic acid 
Maleic acid anion is the counter ion to afatinib in drug substance. Maleic acid has been reported 
to be associated with renal side effects. Because no data from repeat dose studies in the minipig 
were available, a 4 week study (32 days of treatment) was initiated with maleic acid with a single 
dose group of 3 mg/kg, equivalent to the amount of maleic acid anion administered as afatinib in 
the respective 4 week toxicity study  in minipigs which was run in parallel. For this purpose 
maleic acid was dissolved in demineralised water and administered orally (gavage) to four 
Goettingen minipigs per sex (ca. 4 5 months old, body weight 9 12 kg). 
Daily oral administration of 3 mg/kg maleic acid for four weeks was not associated with any 
changes in clinical signs, clinical pathology, gross or histopathology in minipigs.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Afatinib is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that belongs to the ErbB-family of blockers. 
In vitro, afatinib has been shown to be a potent and selective inhibitor of EGFR/ErbB1, 
HER2/ErbB2 and HER4/ErbB4, it has also been shown active against EGFR-mutations known to 
be resistant towards other EGFR TK inhibitors. In vivo activity and inhibition of ErbB-dependent 
processes was shown in tumour xenograft models as well as in transgenic mice. 
The secondary pharmacology findings were in line what would be expected from an EGFR TK 
inhibitor and are not expected to have any adverse clinical consequences at the recommended 
use. 
No adverse safety pharmacology findings were identified in investigations on afatinib. The 
cardiovascular signals seen in the secondary pharmacology and safety studies performed are 
neither considered to be adverse and the proposal not to conduct a thorough QT-study was 
considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
No pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies with afatinib have been carried out. This was 
agreed as the applied indication is in monotherapy. 
CHMP assessment report

Pharmacokinetics of afatinib has been sufficiently studied and showed that the species used in 
the toxicological studies (rat and minipig) are relevant to use. The rat was selected as the rodent 
species for toxicology testing on afatinib due to its widely accepted use in toxicology 
investigations. The minipig was selected as the non-rodent species due to the poor 
gastrointestinal tolerance of dogs observed in early pharmacology investigations, because it had 
shown a metabolite pattern comparable to humans in liver microsome in vitro investigations and 
its ability for quinazoline metabolism by aldehyde oxidase. 
The most prominent feature of afatinib is the covalent binding to proteins which were shown to 
result in an almost linear tissue accumulation over time. 
Oral administration of single doses to mice and rats indicated a low acute toxic potential of 
afatinib. In oral repeated-dose studies for up to 26 weeks in rats or 52 weeks in minipigs the 
main effects were identified in the skin (dermal changes, epithelial atrophy and folliculitis in 
rats), the gastrointestinal tract (diarrhoea, erosions in the stomach, epithelial atrophy in rats and 
minipigs) and the kidneys (papillary necrosis in rats). Depending on the finding, these changes 
occurred at exposures below, in the range of or above clinically relevant levels. Additionally, in 
various organs pharmacodynamically mediated atrophy of epithelia was observed in both 
species. This information has been adequately communicated in section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
No genotoxicity has been found in three in vivo studies and in the in vitro chromosomal 
aberration assay. No long-term studies to assess the carcinogenic potential of afatinib have been 
perforemed. This is in line with the ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline S9 (Nonclinical 
evaluation for anticancer pharmaceuticals) and was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Afatinib has been evaluated regarding potential reproductive and developmental toxicity 
according to ICH guidance. The embryo-foetal development studies performed on afatinib 
revealed no indication of teratogenicity. The respective total systemic exposure (AUC) was either 
slightly above (2.2 times in rats) or below (0.3 times in rabbits) compared with levels in patients. 
A fertility study in male and female rats up to the maximum tolerated dose revealed no 
significant impact on fertility. The total systemic exposure (AUC0-24) in male and female rats 
was in the range or less than that observed in patients (1.3 times and 0.51 times, respectively). 
A study in rats up to the maximum tolerated doses revealed no significant impact on 
pre-/postnatal development. The highest total systemic exposure (AUC0-24) in female rats was 
less than that observed in patients (0.23 times). No studies have been performed in juvenile 
animals. Since the proposed indication of afatinib is for adults, the lack of studies in juvenile 
animals is acceptable. In addition radiolabelled afatinib administered orally to rats on Day 11 of 
lactation was excreted in the breast milk of the dams. The non-clinical findings on reproductive 
toxicity have been adequately communicated in section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
Specified impurities present at and above the ICHQ 3A/3B levels in afatinib drug substance 
and/or drug product were adequately qualified in GLP safety studies by in vitro and in vivo 
genotoxicity tests and a 13-week oral repeat-dose toxicity study in rats. 
An in vitro 3T3 test showed that afatinib may have phototoxicity potential. The majority of 
patients treated with afatinib are expected to develop some signs of skin adverse events, which 
are related to the pharmacodynamic activity of the drug and which also have been observed for 
patients treated with other EGFR inhibitors (gefitinib, erlotinib, lapatinib). Precautionary

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) data are provided from in total of 31 clinical studies: 12 basic PK 
studies, 10 plasma monitoring/sparse PK sampling studies and 9 PK studies of afatinib in 
combination therapy. In addition, 6 reports on PK meta-analysis, PKPD and population PK 
analysis of afatinib have been provided. The clinical pharmacology profile was investigated in 
studies performed in cancer patients but also in healthy volunteers. 
Absorption 
Following oral administration Cmax of afatinib were observed 2-5 hours post-dose following a 
single dose as well as at steady state, i.e. an intermediate tmax (see Table 16).

In Figure 2, the plasma concentration-time curves shows quite flat Cmax profiles, particularly at 
steady state which may indicate ongoing absorption over period of hours.

•  Bioavailability 
Following oral administration of afatinib, Cmax were observed approximately 2 to 5 hours post 
dose. Cmax and AUC0-∞ values increased slightly more than proportionally in the dose range 
from 20 mg to 50 mg afatinib. 
No absolute bioavailability of afatinib in man has been determined. Following an oral dose of 15 
mg (2.25 MBq) [14C]afatinib dimaleate, the total recovery of radioactivity was 89% with 85% 
recovered in faeces. 8% was recovered in faeces during the first 24h post dosing and 70% within 
72h.

Based on a number of factors such as the solubility and permeability of afatinib, the 
bioavailability observed in animal species and the limited effect of a Pgp inhibitor on afatinib 
exposure, the applicant has stated that absolute bioavailability of afatinib is likely high. 
In a scenario with high bioavailability, parent compound in faeces represents absorbed and then 
excreted drug. Thus, in this case the greatest concern in terms of drug-drug interaction would be 
interactions that involve hepatic and intestinal transport proteins. Afatinib has been shown to be 
a substrate to the efflux transporters BCRP and Pgp, but not to MRP2. The studies with uptake 
transporters (e.g. OATPs) were inconclusive due to a high background uptake in control cells, 
likely due to the high permeability of afatinib. The available in vivo studies with the BCRP and 
Pgp inhibitor ritonavir indicated that inhibition of intestinal efflux transporters had a limited effect 
on afatinib exposure. 
In the possibly less likely scenario of low bioavailability, the parent compound recovered in 
faeces would represent unabsorbed drug, and the major elimination pathway for absorbed 
afatinib would be metabolism. In vitro, enzyme-dependent metabolism was catalysed by FMO3 
and CYP3A4. Furthermore, conjugates formed by Michael addition, which is not dependent on 
metabolising enzymes, were observed in vitro. The in vivo mass-balance confirmed presence of 
conjugates formed by Michael addition in faeces. The metabolite m15, formed by FMO3, was 
recovered in urine but to a lesser degree than the conjugated metabolites, while the CYP3A4-
mediated metabolite was not detectable in excreta. Thereby, even if metabolism would be the 
major elimination pathway this would be primarily non-enzymatic and the risk for metabolic 
drug-drug interactions would be low. 
Regardless of whether the bioavailability is low or high, mass-balance data indicate that urinary 
excretion of parent compound is a minor route of elimination. 
•  Bioequivalence  
In a relative bioavailability study, the final formulation (FF) was compared to the test immediate 
release film coated tablet from which the final tablet was further developed. 
The relative bioavailability study was a single dose study with randomised, 3-way crossover 
design in healthy male subjects (n=22). The treatments were separated by at least three weeks 
and blood samples were collected for 96h. The plasma concentration-time profiles of afatinib 
following the three different formulations are shown in Figure 3.

Influence of food 
The food effect on the absorption/systemic exposure of afatinib was studied as a secondary 
objective in one of the MTD studies. Thirteen patients were evaluated in that part of the study, 
which was a randomized, two-way crossover design with a single dose of 40 mg afatinib 
dimaleate with or without a high fat/high caloric meal. The test film coated tablet TFII was used 
and blood samples were collected during 48h post dose. 
As seen in Figure 4 the absorption was delayed and decreased when afatinib dimaleate was 
dosed under fed condition.

Systemic exposure to afatinib is decreased by 50% (Cmax) and 39% (AUC0-∞), when 
administered with a high-fat meal compared to administration in the fasted state. Based on 
population pharmacokinetic data derived from clinical trials in various tumour types, an average 
decrease of 26% in AUCτ,ss was observed when food was consumed within 3 hours before 
or 1 hour after taking afatinib. 
Distribution 
Following oral dosing with afatinib dimaleate a bi-exponential decay could be seen after the first 
dose but with a change in the plasma concentration-time profile after repeated dosing towards a 
more mono-exponential decrease which might indicate a distribution phase reaching equilibrium. 
In vitro protein binding of [14C]afatinib was determined by equilibrium dialysis at 50-500 nM and 
the unbound fraction (fu) was calculated to be 5.0% independently of concentration. The fb of 
[14C]afatinib to isolated human serum albumin (HSA ; 45 g/L) was 80%. The binding to alpha-1-
acid-glycoprotein (AGP) increased with protein concentration with a fb of 12% at 0.1 g/L AGP to 
91% bound at 10 g/L AGP. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/491185/2013

The distribution into blood cells was studied and the blood/plasma ratio was determined to 2.2 
and 1.0 at 2min and 3h (after spiking), respectively. The change ratio with time may be 
attributed to the covalent binding (CVB) process. 
The apparent volume of distribution has not been determined since afatinib has only been dosed 
orally to man. High Vz/F was calculated and increased from 1940 L following a single dose to 
2770 L at steady state. 
Afatinib was distributed into blood cells, as indicated by a concentration ratio of blood cells to 
plasma that decreased from 2.21 at 2 min after spiking to 1.02 at 3 hours after spiking and was 
equal until 48 hours after spiking. Binding of afatinib to human serum albumin (45 g/L) was 
moderate (79.6 %). Binding of 150 nM afatinib to human alpha-1-acid-glycoprotein (AGP) 
increased with the protein concentration from 11.6 % at 0.1 g/L AGP to 90.6 % at 10 g/L AGP. 
The apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) was high with 1940 L for single dose treatment and 
2770 L at steady state. 
Elimination 
Generally a longer t 1/2 was calculated, about 37h, following the last dose at steady state 
compared to the t 1/2 determined after the first dose, about 23h. The t 1/2 of afatinib calculated 
following an oral dose of [14C]afatinib dimaleate in the ADME study was 34h. 
Clearance has not been determined since afatinib has only been dosed orally to man. CL/F was 
calculated to 1050 ml/min following a single dose to 898 ml/min at steady state. 
Excretion 
The mass-balance of excretion was studied in 8 healthy volunteers following a single dose 15 mg 
(2.25 MBq) [14C]afatinib dimaleate administered as an oral solution. Blood samples were drawn 
at regular intervals during 96h post dose and urine and faeces samples were planned to be 
collected up to 120h after dosing, however, depending on ongoing excretion at 120h the 
sampling period was prolonged. Urine samples collected 0-72h post dosing where pooled across 
subjects, as were the faeces samples, (proportionally according to the weight of the single 
fraction samples) for determination of excretion pattern. 
Most of the radioactivity was excreted within four days, 79% (range 65-88%) of the dose, with 
most of it excreted in faeces (Figure 5). The total recovery was 89% (range 84-95%) within 13 
days with 4.3% (range 3.4-6.0%) of the dose excreted in urine and 85% (range 77-93%) in 
faeces.

Afatinib  was  metabolised  only  to  a  minor  extent  in  humans,  which  was  consistent  with  in  vitro 
studies and studies in animals. Metabolic patterns in plasma, urine and faeces were investigated 
after  single  oral  administration  of  [14C]-afatinib  to  healthy  male  subjects.  In  addition, 
metabolism  of  afatinib  was  qualitatively  investigated  in  cancer  patients  with  various  solid 
tumours. Urine and plasma samples on Day 14 following multiple oral administrations of 70 mg 
tablets once daily were selected for metabolic profiling. The metabolism was mainly governed by 
non  enzyme-catalysed  Michael  adduct  formation  with  proteins  or  nucleophilic  small  molecules. 
Other  metabolism  of  afatinib  proceeds  via  the  following  reactions:  conjugate  formation  with 
electron-rich  small  molecules  such  as  cysteine  (m4),  N-acetylcysteine  (m13),  glutathione  and 
their  breakdown  products  (Michael  addition);  and  N-oxide  formation  (dimethylamino  moiety) 
yielding m15 (FMO3). Due to the low amounts formed in vivo all metabolites can be classified as 
trace / minor pathways. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/491185/2013 
Page 41/129 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
In  plasma,  [14C]-afatinib  was  the  predominant  radioactive  compound  that  was  detected  by 
radioactivity detection (97.4 % of total extracted sample radioactivity at 1 h after dosing, 97.7 % 
at  4  h  and  100  %  at  6  h).  Only  a  few  trace  metabolites  of  afatinib  were  detected.  Non-
extractable  radioactivity  was  found  in  all  plasma  samples  following  oral  [14C]–afatinib 
administration, considered as being covalently bound to plasma protein, which was expected due 
to the chemical structure of afatinib.  
Afatinib  was  also  found  to  be  the  major  analyte  in  plasma  of  cancer  patients  after  multiple 
administration  of  70  mg  afatinib.  In  addition,  the  metabolite  m3  was  detected  in  low  amounts, 
but  no  other  metabolite  was  detected  with  this  qualitative  investigation  in  plasma  samples  of 
cancer patients. 
The most prevalent component in the excreta was the parent compound (88 % of the excreted 
radioactivity,  64.1  %  of  the  dose),  followed  by  m4  (6.7  %  of  the  radioactivity  in  the  excreta, 
4.9  %  of  the  dose),  m13  (3.7  %  of  the  excreted  radioactivity,  2.7  %  of  the  dose),  and  m15 
(0.4 % of the excreted radioactivity, 0.3 % of the dose). 
Additional qualitative information on  the  metabolism  of  afatinib  in  cancer patients  was  obtained 
by  LC-MS  analyses  of  urine  samples  taken  on  Day  14  after  multiple  administration  of  70  mg 
afatinib once daily.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality, in the clinical dose range, was studied in healthy subjects. Healthy male 
volunteers received an oral dose of afatinib dimaleate in a single rising, sequential study design. 
Doses of 20, 30, 40 or 50 mg were administered using the final tablet formulation. There was a 
non-proportional increase in exposure with increase in dose in the studied dose range. 
In a phase II MTD study, patients received a single oral dose of afatinib dimaleate, the day after 
they were dosed with docetaxel (60-75 mg/m2), in a dose range of 10-160 mg. An over-
proportional increase in exposure, with dose, was seen between 10 mg and 40 mg and then 
becoming proportional up to 160 mg. 
The observed over-proportional increase of concentrations with increasing doses were 
characterized in the population PK analysis using a non-linear function for relative bioavailability 
(F1). F1 increased with increasing dose according to a power function with a power of 0.485 up 
to an estimated maximum dose of 70 mg from which F1 remained constant. 
Steady state was reached at least within eight days following once daily dosing, which is in 
agreement with a terminal t 1/2 of about 35h. The exposure at steady state was about 2-3 times 
higher compared to a single dose. The overall accumulation ratio was 2.8 when based on total 
exposure and 2.1 when based on maximum plasma levels. 
Afatinib did not induce CYP450 in vitro and was only metabolised to a minor extent by 
conventional metabolism i.e. enzyme catalyzed metabolism by that minimizing the risk for time 
dependency. 
Target and Special populations 
Target population 
A population pharmacokinetic (PPK) analysis was conducted by the use of nonlinear mixed effects 
modelling in NONMEM to characterise the PK of afatinib and to evaluated the effect of intrinsic 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/491185/2013 
Page 42/129 
 
  
  
and extrinsic factors. The analysis included data from studies in patients with different solid 
tumours, in total 927 patients (4460 observations).  
The PK was described by a two-compartment disposition model with first order absorption and 
elimination. Absorption was characterized by a non-linear function for relative bioavailability (F). 
F increased according to a power function with a power of 0.49 up to 70 mg, followed by a 
proportional increase with dose. Significant covariates were ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group) performance score, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and alkaline phosphatase (AP) 
influencing the afatinib exposure by affecting F. The exposure increased with increasing ECOG, 
LDH and AP levels. Furthermore, head & neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients had a 
significantly higher F than NSCLC or breast cancer patients. Weight (incorporated according to 
allometry), creatinine clearance (CRCL), sex and total protein (TPRO) were found to be 
statistically significant covariates on CL/F. CL/F increased with increasing WT. When CRCL was 
greater than 120 mL/min, CL/F was assumed to be constant, and otherwise it declined linearly 
with decreasing CRCL. Female patients had a slightly lower CL/F as compared to male patients 
and CL/F decreased with increasing TPRO. Lastly, increase in V2/F with increasing WT was also 
statistically significant. Age, smoking history, alcohol consumption and presence of liver 
metastases had no statistically significant impact on the PK of afatinib.  
Renal impairment: Afatinib has not been studied in a dedicated trial in subjects with renal 
impairment. The effect of impaired renal function was explored in the population PK analysis 
using creatinine clearance (CRCL) (according to Cockcroft Gault formula) as a surrogate marker. 
CRCL was found to be a statistical significant covariate for CL/F, with exposure to afatinib 
moderately increased with decreasing CRCL. Compared with a patient with a CRCL of 79 mL/min 
(median in population), exposure to afatinib was predicted to increase by 13% and 42% for a 
patient with a CRCL of 60 mg/mL and 30mg/ml respectively and to decrease by 20% for a 
patient with a CRCL of 120 mL/min.  
Hepatic impairment 
A dedicated hepatic impairment study (single dose) indicated no relevant effect of mild (Child 
Pugh A, score 5-6) to moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B, score 7-9) on afatinib 
exposure.  
Gender, weight, race and age 
The effect of gender, weight (range 31.4 to 134 kg), race and age (range 28 to 87 years) on the 
pharmacokinetics of afatinib was evaluated in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. No 
clinically relevant effects were observed. Gender was a statistically significant covariate for CL/F 
where female patients were predicted to a 15% higher plasma exposure (AUCτ,ss) than male 
patients. Weight was incorporated into the model according allometry on CL/F and V2/F and 
AUCτ,ss was predicted to increase by 26% for a patient weighing 42 kg and to decreased by 22% 
for a patient weighing 95 kg compared to the average patient (62.5 kg). The PK was found not to 
be significantly different between Asian and Caucasian patients and age was not a significant 
covariate. 
The exposure of afatinib in Japanese patients was evaluated in a MTD part of a phase I/II study 
with twelve patients included. The variability in PK was moderate to high. There was a slight 
tendency to higher exposure in the Japanese compared to the Caucasian patients at steady state 
CHMP assessment report

but the study concludes that the PK is comparable between the two groups. 50 mg afatinib 
dimaleate was chosen as the starting dose in the phase II step in the study. A 55 mg dose has 
been determined as the MTD in Caucasian patients. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Effects of afatinib on other substances 
Competitive and mechanism-based inhibition of cytochrome (CYP) P450 isoforms by afatinib 
maleate was investigated in human liver microsomes using specific probe substrates. For 
CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4, and CYP4A11, 
competitive inhibition was low or absent at afatinib concentrations up to 100 μM. For CYP2C9 an 
IC50 value of 79.3 μM was determined. There was no indication of mechanism-based inhibition of 
CYP3A4 by afatinib up to 100 μM.  
In primary human hepatocytes, afatinib up to 5 μM caused no relevant induction of enzyme 
activity or mRNA levels for CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19 or 3A4.  
In human liver microsomes, afatinib showed some inhibition of UGT1A1-mediated 
glucuronidation of estradiol and BIBF1202 (a metabolite to the experimental tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor nintedanib) with an IC50 value of 24.3 μM and a Ki of 10.9 μM, respectively.  
In two different studies, afatinib concentration-dependently inhibited the transport of the known 
Pgp substrate digoxin over Caco-2 cell monolayers with a mean IC50 value of 24 μM or a Ki 
value of 3.4 μM, respectively. The interaction of afatinib with Pgp was also evaluated using 
monolayers of Pgp-expressing LLC-PK1 cells. In this study, afatinib inhibited digoxin transport 
with an IC50 value of 1.59 μM. 
Afatinib showed concentration-dependent inhibition of the BCRP-mediated efflux of estrone-3-
sulfate over Caco-2 cell monolayers. At the highest afatinib concentration (30 μM) the inhibition 
was of the same degree as for the known BCRP inhibitor fumitremorgin C. The mean IC50 value 
for afatinib BCRP inhibition was 0.75 μM. 
Afatinib as inhibitor of human organic anion transporting-polypeptide (OATP) isoforms was 
investigated using HEK293 cells expressing OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or OATP2B1. Afatinib inhibited 
OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated estradiol 17β-D-glucuronide uptake and OATP2B1-mediated 
estrone-3-sulfate uptake in a concentration-dependent manner with IC50 values of 82.8, 71.2, 
and 6.05 μM, respectively.  
Inhibition of human organic cation transporter (OCT) isoforms was investigated using HEK293 
cells expressing OCT1, OCT2 or OCT3. Afatinib inhibited OCT1 and OCT3-mediated transport of 
the probe substrate MPP+ in a concentration-dependent manner with IC50 values of 20.0 and 
11.8 μM, respectively, while OCT2-mediated MPP+ transport was not relevantly inhibited by 
afatinib up to 100 μM. 
Inhibition of the human organic anion transporter (OAT) isoforms by afatinib was evaluated using 
HEK293 cells expressing OAT1 or OAT3. Afatinib did not show strong inhibition of OAT1-mediated 
PAH uptake or OAT3-mediated E-sul uptake and the IC50 values were >100 μM.

Effects of other substances on afatinib  
Afatinib has been shown to be a CYP3A4 and Pgp substrate in vitro. Three in vivo interaction 
studies have been performed. Two studies evaluated the interaction between afatinib and the 
CYP3A4/Pgp inhibitor ritonavir administered at different timepoints in relation to afatinib. The 
third study evaluated the effect of the strong inducer rifampicin on afatinib. 
When the CYP3A4/Pgp inhibitor ritonavir was administered 1 hr before a 20 mg dose of afatinib 
AUCinf and Cmax increased by 48% and 38%, respectively, as compared with administration of 
afatinib alone. Median Tmax was unchanged, and afatinib distribution and elimination phases, 
including terminal t 1/2 and mean residence time (MRT), appeared to be similar with and without 
ritonavir, indicating that ritonavir affected bioavailability rather than elimination of afatinib. When 
administered simultaneously with or 6 hr after a 40 mg dose of afatinib, ritonavir had only a 
minor effect on afatinib AUC (20% and 10% increase, respectively) and basically no effect on 
Cmax.  
Seven days of pre-treatment with rifampicin led to about 34% and 22% decreases in afatinib 
AUCinf and Cmax, respectively. Other pharmacokinetic parameters, such as Tmax, t 1/2 and mean 
residence time (MRT) were similar between the two treatments, indicating that the effect was 
primarily on bioavailability and not on elimination.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
No specific clinical pharmacology studies have been submitted.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
In the pivotal study 1200.32, no correlation between PK and efficacy could be established, 
although there was a weak trend towards a relationship between partial response and higher 
pre-dose concentrations at week 2 and 4.The relationship between AEs and trough afatinib 
plasma concentration was explored on Day 15 (Course 1). It was shown that median afatinib 
trough levels increased with the severity of diarrhea and rash/acne.  
In the pivotal Trial 1200.32, NSCLC patients were dosed with 40 mg afatinib, but were dose-
escalated to 50 mg afatinib in case of good tolerability and sequentially dose reduced to 30 mg 
and 20 mg afatinib in case of non-tolerated adverse events. Individual trough plasma 
concentrations suggested that patients who were dose reduced had originally higher plasma 
exposure and patients who were escalated to 50 mg had originally lower plasma exposure at 40 
mg afatinib in comparison to the average exposure in the 40 mg dose group. After dose 
adjustments, plasma exposure was similar for all dose groups at Day 43 of afatinib treatment, 
the Day of the last PK observation. In addition, the variability decreased in the 40 mg dose group 
from 85 % (Day 22) to 66.5 % (Day 43).  
Trial 1200.24 was designed to assess a potential impact on QTcF of continuous oral treatment 
with afatinib at a daily dose of 50 mg. Dose reductions to 40 mg/day or 30 mg/day were allowed 
in patients with drug-related toxicity.

Individual values for time-matched changes in QTcF from baseline and mean afatinib plasma 
concentrations are shown for Days 1 and 14 combined in Figure 6. Within the observed 
concentration range there was no signs of a QT prolonging effect.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Definite conclusions on the relative importance of different elimination pathways, such as biliary 
excretion, metabolism and renal elimination, cannot be drawn from mass-balance data. However, 
taking all available data into account (e.g. in vitro permeability and transport data, mass-balance 
data, pharmacokinetics in renal and hepatic impairment, interaction data) and possible clinical 
consequences of different scenarios, the CHMP was of the opinion that conclusions on the 
interaction risk can be drawn based on already available data and that an absolute bioavailability 
study was not required. 
Bioequivalence could not be shown between the final tablet and the test tablet used in the clinical 
program. However, the FF tablet has been used in the phase III studies, and the lack of 
demonstrated bioequivalence for the formulations used in certain exploratory studies is not 
considered to be critical for the interpretation of results. 
Afatinib is for oral use. The tablets should be swallowed whole with water. If swallowing of whole 
tablets is not possible, these can be dispersed in approximately 100 ml of noncarbonated 
drinking water. No other liquids should be used. The tablet should be dropped into the water 
without crushing it, and stirred occasionally for up to 15 min until it is broken up into very small 
particles. The dispersion should be consumed immediately. The glass should be rinsed with 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/491185/2013 
Page 46/129 
 
 
  
  
approximately 100 ml of water which should also be consumed. The dispersion can also be 
administered through a gastric tube.  
An important feature of afatinib is the covalent binding to lysine residues on proteins. This 
property is desirable from a pharmacodynamic point of view, but as the binding increases over 
time and causes a very long retention time of the drug in the body, concerns were raised 
regarding the long-term safety of afatinib treatment. These concerns have been adequately 
addressed in the RMP and further data will be provided post-authorisation by the applicant to 
determine the time needed to complete washout of afatinib: a PK sampling for non-covalently 
bound afatinib after cessation of treatment in patients who have been treated long-term with 
afatinib. 
As the time needed for complete elimination of afatinib is unknown and there are no or limited 
amount of data from the use of this medicinal product in pregnant women, the risk for humans is 
thus unknown. Therefore, if used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while or 
after receiving afatinib, she should be informed of the potential hazard to the foetus. In addition, 
as a precautionary measure, women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid 
becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with afatinib. Adequate contraceptive methods 
should be used during therapy and for at least 1 month after the last dose. This information has 
been adequately highlighted in section 4.6 of the SmPC. 
In vivo afatinib was metabolised only to a minor extent and the metabolism was governed by 
Michael adduct formation to proteins or nucleophilic small molecules. It was found that 
metabolism generally is of subordinate role for afatinib and that specifically enzyme-catalyzed 
oxidative metabolic reactions play a negligible role for the metabolism of afatinib in vivo. 
Higher exposure to afatinib has been observed in female patients, patients with lower body 
weight and those with underlying renal impairment. This could result in a higher risk of 
developing adverse reactions in particular diarrhoea, rash/acne and stomatitis. Closer monitoring 
is recommended in patients with these risk factors. This has been adequately highlighted in 
section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
It appears that moderate differences in afatinib exposure can be adequately handled by dose 
adjustments based on tolerability. Therefore, moderate increases in exposure due to intrinsic and 
extrinsic factors may not need to lead to adjustment of the starting dose.  The SmPC includes 
adequate recommendations in sections 4.2 and 5.2. 
In vitro studies have demonstrated that afatinib is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP. When the 
strong P-gp and BCRP inhibitor ritonavir (200 mg twice a day for 3 days) was administered 
1 hour before a single dose of 20 mg afatinib, exposure to afatinib increased by 48% (area under 
the curve (AUC0-∞)) and 39% (maximum plasma concentration (Cmax)). In contrast, when 
ritonavir was administered simultaneously or 6 hours after 40 mg afatinib, the relative 
bioavailability of afatinib was 119% (AUC0-∞) and 104% (Cmax) and 111% (AUC0-∞) and 
105% (Cmax), respectively. Therefore, it is recommended to administer strong P-gp inhibitors 
(including but not limited to ritonavir, cyclosporine A, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, 
verapamil, quinidine, tacrolimus, nelfinavir, saquinavir, and amiodarone) using staggered dosing, 
preferably 6  hours or 12 hours apart from afatinib. Adequate information has been included in 
section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/491185/2013 
Page 47/129 
 
  
  
Pre-treatment with rifampicin (600 mg once daily for 7 days), a potent inducer of P-gp, 
decreased the plasma exposure to afatinib by 34% (AUC0-∞) and 22% (Cmax) after 
administration of a single dose of 40 mg afatinib. Strong P-gp inducers (including but not limited 
to rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital or St. John’s Wort (Hypericum 
perforatum)) may decrease exposure to afatinib. Adequate information has been included in 
section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
Based on in vitro data, afatinib is a moderate inhibitor of P-gp. However, based on clinical data it 
is considered unlikely that afatinib will result in changes of the plasma concentrations of other 
P-gp substrates. Adequate information has been included in sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC. 
In vitro studies indicated that afatinib is a substrate and an inhibitor of the transporter BCRP. 
Afatinib may increase the bioavailability of orally administered BCRP substrates (including but not 
limited to rosuvastatin and sulfasalazine). Adequate information has been included in section 4.5 
of the SmPC. 
In vitro data indicated that drug-drug interactions with afatinib due to inhibition of OATB1B1, 
OATP1B3, OATP2B1, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, and OCT3 transporters are considered unlikely. 
Adequate information has been included in section 5.2 of the SmPC. 
In humans it was found that enzyme-catalyzed metabolic reactions play a negligible role for the 
metabolism of afatinib. Approximately 2% of the afatinib dose was metabolized by FMO3 and the 
CYP3A4-dependent N-demethylation was too low to be quantitatively detected. Afatinib is not an 
inhibitor or an inducer of CYP enzymes. Therefore, afatinib is unlikely to interact with other 
medicines that modulate or are metabolised by CYP enzymes. Adequate information has been 
included in section 5.2 of the SmPC. 
In vitro data indicated that drug-drug interactions with afatinib due to inhibition of UGT1A1 are 
considered unlikely. Adequate information has been included in section 5.2 of the SmPC. 
Importantly, co-administration of a high-fat meal with afatnib resulted in a significant decrease 
of exposure to afatinib by about 50% in regard to Cmax and 39% in regard to AUC0-∞. The 
SmPC includes adequate information in sections 4.2, 4.5 and 5.2 indicating that afatinib should 
be administered without food.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Based on the clinical pharmacology data afatinib has been adequately in the treatment of 
Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) TKI-naïve adult patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating EGFR mutation(s). 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The proposed indication for afatinib is the treatment of patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic NSCLC with EGFR mutation(s). The evaluation of efficacy supporting this indication is 
based on 1 pivotal (1200.32) and 3 supportive trials (1200.22, 1200.23, and 1200.42) in 
patients with pathologic confirmation of stage IIIB or stage IV NSCLC. An overview of the 
characteristics of the 4 main trials included in the efficacy evaluation is provided in Table 20.

In addition study 1200.34/LUX-Lung 6 was provided during the procedure. LUX-Lung 6 was a 
randomised, open-label, phase III study of afatinib versus chemotherapy as first-line treatment 
for patients with stage IIIB or IV adenocarcinoma of the lung harbouring an EGFR-activating 
mutation. 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Three dose-escalation trials were undertaken in patients with a variety of solid tumours (1200.2, 
1200.3, and 1200.4) in order to define the recommended phase II dose (RPIID). Dose limiting 
toxicities were found to be diarrhoea (16 of 171 patients), dehydration (7 patients of 171 
patients), skin reactions (5 patients of 171 patients) and fatigue (2 patients of 171 patients). 
Based on these data, the RPIID was found to be 50 mg q.d. Additional data from the Phase I trial 
1200.17 (i.e. the extension trial of trials 1200.1 and 1200.2) supported this finding. The 
frequency of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) increased with afatinib dose, as did the frequency and 
severity of a number of commonly-reported drug-related AEs. DLTs of diarrhoea and dehydration 
occurred more frequently at daily doses of afatinib 55 mg and above. 
Additional data from the supportive study 1200.22 / Lux Lung 2 (see full details in the Supportive 
Studies section) which included patients receiving both 40 mg and 50 mg afatinib starting dose, 
showed that efficacy results where comparable, however tolerability of the highest dose (50 mg) 
was lower than the 40 mg. Any AE leading to dose reduction were 9 (30.0%) vs 63 (63.6%); 
Serious AEs 5 (16.7%) vs 37 (37.4%) and Investigator defined drug-related serious AEs 2 
(6.7%) vs 12 (12.1%) for afatinib 40 mg and 50 mg, respectively. Based on these results the

pivotal trial (study 1200.32) was amended to reduce the starting dose to 40 mg once daily after 
knowing results from study 1200.22. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
Title of Study 
Study 1200.32/LUX-Lung 3 - A randomised, open-label, phase III study of afatinib versus 
chemotherapy as first-line treatment for patients with stage IIIB or IV adenocarcinoma of the 
lung harbouring an EGFR-activating mutation. 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Main inclusion criteria: 
1. Pathologically confirmed diagnosis of Stage IIIB (with cytologically proven pleural effusion or 
pericardial effusion) or Stage IV adenocarcinoma of the lung. Patients with mixed histology were 
eligible if adenocarcinoma was the predominant histology.  
2. EGFR mutation detected by central laboratory analysis of tumour biopsy material.  
For the tumour tissue samples, DNA extraction and amplification using real-time PCR was 
performed. Genotyping of the most frequent EGFR mutations was conducted using an established 
real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol together with fluorescence detection 
(TheraScreen®: EGFR29 Mutation Kit, DxS Product Code EG-51, QIAGEN Manchester Ltd, 
Manchester, UK). In addition, a central pathology review was performed, including an 
assessment of the percentage of tumour involvement; the results were not reported to the 
investigator. 
3. Measurable disease according to RECIST version 1.1.  
4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 0 or 1.  
5. Age≥18years.  
6. Life expectancy of at least 3 months.  
Main exclusion criteria: 
1. Prior chemotherapy for relapsed or metastatic NSCLC. Neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy 
was permitted if at least 12 months had elapsed between the end of chemotherapy and 
randomisation.  
2. Prior treatment with EGFR-targeting small molecules or antibodies.  
3. Radiotherapy or surgery (other than biopsy) within 4 weeks prior to randomisation.  
4. Active brain metastases (defined as stable for <4 weeks and/or symptomatic and/or requiring 
treatment with anticonvulsants or steroids and/or leptomeningeal disease).  
5. Any other current malignancy or malignancy diagnosed within the past 5 years (other than 
non-melanomatous skin cancer and in situ cervical cancer).  
6. History or presence of clinically relevant cardiovascular abnormalities such as uncontrolled 
hypertension, congestive heart failure NYHA classification of 3, unstable angina or poorly 
controlled arrhythmia. Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to randomisation.

7. Cardiac left ventricular function with resting ejection fraction of less than 50%.  
Treatments 
In the afatinib arm the starting dose was 40 mg once daily. Afatinib was to be taken once daily 
at approximately the same time each day at least 1 hour before food intake and at least 3 hours 
after food intake. Patients with pre-specified AEs during Course 1, i.e., diarrhoea or skin-related 
AEs or mucositis of any CTCAE Grade, or any drug-related AE of CTCAE Grade ≥2 were to 
continue afatinib at 40 mg once daily unless dose reduction was necessary. Patients with limited 
side effects during Course 1 (i.e., none of the above events occurred) were to increase the 
afatinib dose to 50 mg once daily from Course 2 onwards. The afatinib dose for these patients 
was 50 mg once daily for subsequent courses unless dose reduction was necessary. 
In the chemotherapy arm, patients were to receive pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) followed by 
cisplatin (75 mg/m2) on Day 1 of each 21-day treatment course. Patients were to receive 6 
treatment courses unless they developed documented disease progression, experienced 
unacceptable side effects, or the patient or the investigator requested permanent discontinuation 
of the study medication. Haematology assessment was to be performed before each new 
treatment course and the next treatment course was to be delayed for patients with a platelet 
count <100,000 /mm3 or ANC <1500 /mm3. 
Patients were to receive supportive care with anti-emetics, hydration, and vitamin supplements 
during chemotherapy in accordance with the current SmPC of the supplied medication and 
institutional guidelines. 
Objectives 
The trial objective was to compare the efficacy and safety of afatinib monotherapy with 
pemetrexed / cisplatin chemotherapy as first-line treatment for these patients. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by central independent 
review according to RECIST version 1.1. 
PFS was defined as the time from randomisation to disease progression (or death if the patient 
died before progression). 
The key secondary endpoints of this trial were: 
- Objective response (defined as complete response [CR], or partial response [PR]) according to 
RECIST version 1.1 (time to objective response, duration of objective response)  
- Disease control (defined as a patient with objective response or stable disease [SD]) according 
to RECIST version 1.1 (duration of disease control)  
- Overall survival (OS)  
Other secondary endpoints were  
- Tumour shrinkage (as specified in the trial statistical analysis plan [TSAP])  
- Change from baseline in body weight (as specified in the TSAP)  
- Change from baseline in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (as 
specified in the TSAP)

- Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) as measured by standardised questionnaires (European 
Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC] quality of life questionnaires C30 
[QLQ-C30] and lung cancer module [QLQ-LC13], with the pre-specified endpoints cough (QLQ-
LC13 question 1), dyspnoea (composite of QLQ-LC13 questions 3-5; individual item from QLQ-
C30 question 8), and pain (composite of QLQ-C30 questions 9 and 19; individual items from 
QLQ-LC13 questions 10, 11, 12)  
- Pharmacokinetics of afatinib  
- Safety of afatinib as indicated by the incidence and severity of adverse events, graded 
according to the US NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0 
and changes in safety laboratory parameters.  
Sample size 
It was estimated that 217 PFS events would provide 90% power for the log-rank test, presuming 
a hazard ratio of 0.64 for afatinib relative to pemetrexed / cisplatin chemotherapy. 
It was planned to enter 330 patients, i.e., 220 patients in the afatinib arm and 110 patients in 
the pemetrexed / cisplatin chemotherapy arm. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomised (ratio 2:1) to receive either afatinib or pemetrexed / cisplatin. The 
randomisation was stratified according to EGFR mutation category (L858R vs. Del 19 vs. Other) 
and race (Asian vs. Non-Asian). 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label trial due to the inherent differences between the 2 treatment arms 
(patients randomised to the afatinib arm received oral tablets while patients randomised to the 
chemotherapy arm received an intravenous infusion). 
Statistical methods 
Planned analyses 
For this trial, 2 analysis data sets were defined; these were the randomised set (RS) and the 
treated set (TS). The randomised set included all patients who were randomised to receive 
treatment, whether treated or not. The RS was used for tables about demographic and other 
baseline characteristics as well as for the primary evaluation of efficacy. 
The treated set included all randomised patients who were documented to have taken at least 1 
dose of study medication (i.e., afatinib or pemetrexed / cisplatin). Patients were allocated 
according to the treatment actually received. The TS was used for the safety analyses. 
Primary analyses 
The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by central independent 
review according to the modified RECIST version 1.1 criteria. 
A stratified log-rank test (2-sided, α = 0.05) was used to test for the effect of afatinib on PFS 
compared with pemetrexed / cisplatin chemotherapy. The test included the 2 stratification factors 
used at randomisation, i.e., EGFR mutation category (L858R vs. Del 19 vs. Other) and race 
(Asian vs. Non-Asian).

Overall survival 
Overall Survival (months), defined as the time from randomisation to death, was formally 
analysed twice. The first analysis was the analysis at the time of the primary PFS analysis and 
the second was performed at a time when more complete information is available on OS. To 
preserve the overall 1-sided α-level of 0.025, a Haybittle-Peto stopping boundary was used (p-
value <0.0001) for the first analysis. A stratified log-rank test was used to test the effect of 
afatinib on OS compared with pemetrexed / cisplatin chemotherapy. The test included the 2 
stratification factors used at randomisation, i.e., EGFR mutation category and race. A Cox 
proportional hazards model, also stratified by EGFR mutation category and race, was used to 
estimate the hazard ratio and 95% CI between the 2 treatment arms. Additional summaries were 
produced to explore the potential impact of subsequent anti-cancer therapy on OS. 
Interim analyses  
A decision of whether to proceed to full accrual was to be performed based on the first 40 
patients randomised to treatment with afatinib, using all radiological imaging data recorded up to 
and including the planned Week 6 imaging data of the 40th patient. The trial was to proceed to 
full accrual after the DMC had certified that at least 16 of the first 40 patients randomised to 
treatment with afatinib had responded. Otherwise accrual was to be paused and the DMC was to 
perform a general risk/benefit assessment of whether to resume accrual or stop recruitment into 
the trial. The determination of the best overall response for each patient was based on 
investigator assessment. This trial was not stopped and preceded to full accrual. Note: Protocol 
amendment 2 specified this analysis of the response of the first 40 patients randomised to 
treatment with afatinib.  
The DMC was to review the safety data of all patients approximately every 6 months. During 
these regular meetings, the DMC could examine PFS and OS to completely assess the risk- 
benefit advantage of afatinib. The significance level for the primary analysis of PFS was not to be 
adjusted for possible interim looks by the DMC. 
Health related Quality of Life (HRQL) 
The EORTC QLQ-C30 comprises 30 questions, using both multi-item scales and single-item 
measures. These include a global health status / HRQOL scale, 5 functional scales, 3 symptoms 
scales, and 6 single items to assess dyspnoea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhoea, 
and financial difficulties. Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items; no item 
occurs in more than 1 scale. The EORTC QLQ-LC13 module comprises 13 questions. The module 
was designed for use in patients receiving treatment with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The 
EORTC QLQ-LC13 incorporates 1 multi-item scale to assess dyspnoea, and a series of single 
items to assess pain, coughing, sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, and 
haemoptysis. The pre-specified HRQOL endpoints were the time to deterioration for cough (QLQ-
LC13 question 1), dyspnoea (composite of QLQ-LC13 questions 3-5), and pain (composite of 
QLQ-C30 questions 9 and 19). In addition, the 3 alternative measures of pain (QLQ-LC13 
questions 10, 11, 12) were examined descriptively for consistency with the composite of QLQ-
C30 questions 9 and 19, as well as the measure of dyspnoea (QLQ-C30 question 8) was 
compared with the composite of QLQ-LC13 questions 3-5. The EQ-5D questionnaire consists of 
the EQ-5D descriptive system and a visual analogue scale. The EQ-5D descriptive system 
comprises the 5 dimensions of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain / discomfort, and anxiety 
/ depression, with 3 levels per each dimension (levels: no problems; some problems; severe 
problems). The patients indicate their health state by ticking the box against the most 
appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensions. The visual analogue scale records the 
patient’s self-rated health status on a vertical, graduated (0 - 100) scale.

HRQOL was assessed at the time points specified in the flow chart below:  
The respective questionnaires were to be completed by the patients at the site before they saw 
the investigator, prior to clinical assessment, prior to any treatment at the clinic, and before the 
patients were provided with any new information about their disease status, in order to avoid 
influencing the responses. 
Results 
Participant flow and Recruitment 
The first patient was enrolled in the trial on 17 August 2009; the last patient was entered into 
the trial on 28 February 2011. Overall, 1269 patients were screened in 133 centres in 25 
countries; and 345 patients were randomised. About two thirds of randomised patients were 
from Asia, about one fifth of randomised patients were from Europe.  
About 30% of the enrolled patients were eligible for the trial. Altogether 924 patients were not 
randomised; 817 of those patients had a tumour sample that was EGFR mutation negative (see 
Table 21). Of the remaining 452 patients with an EGFR mutation positive tumour sample, 58 
patients did not meet the inclusion or exclusion criteria; 24 patients withdrew their consent; 5 
patients were not randomised due to AEs; 5 patients were lost to follow-up; and 15 patients 
were not randomised due to other reasons.

Table 21. Disposition of patients/all patients 
Important protocol violations 
More patients randomised to the afatinib arm (28.3%) than patients in the chemotherapy arm 
(15.7%) were reported to have important protocol violations. The most frequent protocol 
violations were intake of incorrect trial medication (mainly not following the protocol pre-
specified dose modification scheme; afatinib 15.2% of patients; chemotherapy 1.7%), violations 
of the entrance criteria (afatinib 7.0%; chemotherapy 10.4%), and non-adherence to safety-
related withdrawal criteria (patient continued in the study after PD according to RECIST 1.1; 
afatinib 6.1%; chemotherapy 0.9%). No patients with a protocol violation have been excluded 
from the primary analysis. 
Conduct of the study 
There were two amendments to the protocol: 
Amendment 1:  
Exclusion criterion 21 was changed; it originally referred to patients randomised to treatment 
with chemotherapy only. As the consent process took place before randomisation, it was 
necessary to cover both treatment arms with this exclusion criterion.  
The restricted medications during treatment with afatinib were changed. It was specified that the 
list of restricted medications refers to all patients randomised. An additional explanatory 
paragraph was added that the concomitant use of potent P-gp inhibitors and inducers was to be 
avoided during treatment with afatinib. The background was that a trial (1200.79) in healthy 
volunteers indicated that co-administration of these drugs affected the pharmacokinetics of 
afatinib.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/491185/2013 
Page 55/129 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
Amendment 2:  
Several changes and corrections were introduced with the second amendment to the protocol; 
major changes are presented below.  
It was specified that the trial had 2 screening visits. During the first screening visit, the patient 
signed the first informed consent and agreed to the EGFR mutation testing. During the second 
screening visit only for patients with a positive EGFR mutation testing, patients signed a second 
informed consent and agreed to participate in the main part of the trial. The original protocol 
allowed for collection of AEs and concomitant medications as well as collection of demographic 
information at the first screening visit; this was not covered by the first informed consent. This 
error was corrected with protocol amendment 2.  
The strict time window for afatinib intake was removed to accommodate individual patient’s daily 
schedule preference because afatinib has a long half-life. The old instruction to take afatinib “at 
the same time each day (±2 hours) at least 1 hour before food intake and at least 3 hours after 
food intake” was replaced by the information that afatinib was to be taken “at approximately the 
same time each day at least 1 hour before food intake and at least 3 hours after food intake”.  
The concomitant medication for patients randomised to treatment with pemetrexed / cisplatin 
was modified to allow for local variation in the pre-treatment with folic acid. Patients treated with 
pemetrexed were to receive at least 5 doses of oral folic acid or a multivitamin containing folic 
acid during the 7 days prior to commencing treatment according to the SPC or local institutional 
practice.  
The length of the observation period of this trial was specified. It was added that the observation 
period may end earlier depending upon the timing of analyses requested by regulatory 
authorities.  
It was specified that the decision of whether to proceed to full accrual was based on the first 40 
patients randomised to treatment with afatinib whether or not they had stopped treatment 
before the Week 6 assessment. Furthermore, it was emphasised that the DMC could stop the trial 
if less than 16 of these patients showed a response to treatment.  
New information was added to the appendix of the protocol. The appendix was updated with the 
current SPC of cisplatin provided for the trial. In addition, the RECIST version 1.1 criteria in the 
appendix were updated to ensure consistency with the imaging charter for the central 
independent review of radiological imaging.

Randomisation was stratified by EGFR mutation category (L858R vs. Del 19 vs. Other) and race 
(Asian vs. Non-Asian) (see Table 23). 
Table 23a. Stratification factors at baseline by treatment / RS 
The small subgroup of patients with ‘Other’ EGFR mutations was genetically heterogeneous; 
altogether 10 different genetic subtypes of ‘Other’ EGFR mutations were identified (see Table 
23b)

Numbers analysed 
The primary evaluation of efficacy in this trial was based on the randomised set, i.e., all 
randomised patients, regardless of whether treated or not. Of the 345 patients in the 
randomised set (afatinib 230 patients; chemotherapy 115 patients), 340 patients (afatinib 229 
patients; chemotherapy 111 patients) were documented to have taken at least 1 dose of study 
medication and were included in the treated set (see Table 24).

46.5% 
22.0
A total of 78 patients (33.9% of randomised patients) in the afatinib arm and 46 patients 
(40.0%) in the chemotherapy arm were censored for the primary PFS analysis. The main reasons 
for censoring differed between the 2 treatment arms: In the afatinib arm, 23.0% of patients 
were censored because they were alive and progression-free at the cut-off date. In contrast, 
28.7% of chemotherapy patients were classified as having been censored due to the start of a 
new anti-cancer therapy.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/491185/2013 
Page 60/129 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
Investigators stopped tumour imaging after they judged that a patient had progressed. Most 
patients then began additional anti-cancer treatment. If the central independent review classified 
such patients as not having progressed, they are presented in Table 26 as being censored 
because of the start of new treatment, as no further imaging was available for central 
independent review.

  Objective response and disease control  
Results on objective response and disease control are shown in Table 27.

  Overall survival  
The overall survival data were not mature by the cut-off date for the primary analysis. Only 67 
patients (29.1%) in the afatinib arm and 31 patients (27.0%) in the chemotherapy arm had died 
by the cut-off date. Hence, the median OS time was not estimable (see Table 28 and Figure 8). 
The final analysis of OS will be performed when approximately 209 patients have died.

 
Patient reported outcome 
The analyses of symptom control and HRQOL for this report focused on the pre-specified NSCLC-
related symptoms of cough, dyspnoea, and pain measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-
LC13 questionnaires. High compliance rates for HRQOL questionnaire completion on treatment 
were observed (87% to 99%) and were found to be similar for both treatment arms. Results are 
shown in Table 30.

Table 30. Improvement, stabilisation, and worsening of cough, dyspnoea, and pain-related 
items of QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC13. 
In addition, compared with chemotherapy, afatinib statistically significantly delayed the time to 
deterioration for cough (HR 0.595; 95% CI 0.406, 0.872; p = 0.0072) and dyspnoea (HR 0.682; 
95% CI 0.501, 0.928; p = 0.0145). A trend towards a delayed deterioration of pain was also 
observed (HR 0.825; 95% CI 0.618, 1.101; p = 0.1913). 
Ancillary analyses 
Sensitivity analyses  
 
PFS based on investigator assessment  
Progression-free survival was also analysed based on investigator assessment, using the same 
censoring rules as for the primary PFS analysis (see Table 31).

Page 64/129 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
The differences between the central independent review and the investigator assessment were 
analysed in more detail (see Table 32).  
Table 32. Concordance in identifying PFS events. 
 
PFS in patients with NSCLC with ‘Common’ EGFR mutations  
Based on central independent review, a statistically significant interaction between treatment and 
subgroup was observed for the subgroups defined by EGFR mutation category 
(p = 0.0012 for the EGFR mutation subgroup Common vs. Other; p = 0.0002 for the EGFR 
mutation subgroup L858R vs. Del 19 vs. Other). The pre- specified category ‘Common’ EGFR 
mutation comprised L858R and Del 19.  
The treatment effect of afatinib on PFS was stronger in the subgroup of patients with 
‘Common’ EGFR mutations compared with chemotherapy (see Table 33):

Table 33: PFS in patients with NSCLC with EGFR mutations of the category ‘common’, based on 
central independent review. 
Subgroup analyses  
The consistency of the treatment effect of afatinib vs. pemetrexed / cisplatin on PFS by central 
independent review was investigated for the following demographic and baseline characteristics: 
ECOG performance score at baseline, gender, age, size of target lesions at baseline, race, EGFR 
mutation category, geographical region, smoking history, and presence of brain metastases at 
baseline. The results of these subgroup analyses were substantially consistent with the primary 
analysis of PFS (see Figure 9).  
The treatment effect of afatinib was similar in relevant subgroups defined by gender, age, race, 
geographical region, and ECOG performance score at baseline. 
The treatment effect of afatinib vs. pemetrexed / cisplatin on PFS in relevant subgroups was also 
analysed based on investigator assessment.

Methods 
Study participants 
Patients with confirmed diagnosis of stage IIIB (with pleural effusion) or IV NSCLC with pleural 
effusion whose disease progressed after at least one, but not more than two, lines of cytotoxic 
chemotherapy of which one must have been a platinum-containing regimen, and treatment with 
erlotinib or gefitinib, or both, for at least 12 weeks. 
Treatment 
50 mg/day afatinib starting dose, with the option to reduce to 40 mg/day or 30 mg/day, 
according to a pre-specified, protocol defined dose-reduction scheme based on 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade (Version 3.0) 
The treatment was continuous with repeated treatment courses in the absence of disease 
progression, as long as patients tolerated therapy, did not meet criteria for treatment 
withdrawal, and neither the patient nor investigator requested discontinuation of treatment. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to investigate the efficacy and safety of afatinib plus best supportive 
care (BSC) vs. placebo plus best supportive care  (BSC) in patients with advanced NSCLC with 
progressive disease after at least 1 but not more than 2 lines of chemotherapy and at least 12 
weeks of treatment with erlotinib or gefitinib.  
Outcome/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: overall survival (OS) 
Secondary Endpoints: progression-free survival (PFS); objective tumour response based on the 
RECIST, Version 1.0; duration of disease control; time to and duration of objective response; 
HRQoL, and PK. Safety: Adverse events, according to CTCAE Version 3.0, laboratory 
investigations, physical exam, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance 
score, electrocardiogram, left ventricular function, vital signs. 
Statistical analysis 
The original protocol stated that the primary analysis would be conducted when 309 randomised 
patients had died; this would have allowed 85% power. Amendment 1 to the protocol, dated 6 
April 2009, increased the number of deaths required for the analysis to 359 deaths, providing 
90% power for the log-rank test, presuming a hazard ratio of 0.70 for afatinib plus BSC relative 
to placebo plus BSC. The hypothesized hazard ratio of 0.70 is taken from the erlotinib 
registration trial, which showed a 4.7 month median survival time for the placebo group and 6.7 
months for erlotinib. 
An interim analysis on objective response was performed within the framework of a Data 
Monitoring Committee (DMC) after 40 patients treated with afatinib had undergone tumor 
imaging at least once during treatment. The independent DMC recommended continuing the trial 
based on the number of responders observed. The independent DMC was unblinded; however, 
the trial team and investigators remained blinded to treatment assignments during these interim 
analyses. 
The final analyses of overall survival and secondary endpoints were conducted when 358 deaths 
were observed among all randomised patients. The log-rank test, stratified by baseline ECOG

performance score (0, 1 vs. 2) and gender (male vs. female), were used to test for the effect of 
afatinib at the one-sided 0.025 significance level. 
The data cut-off for the primary analysis was 8 July 2010. Updated results for OS have been 
provided on a data cut-off on 13 February 2012. 
Results  
Recruitment 
A total of 697 patients provided signed informed consent at 86 centres, including 432 patients in 
Asia, 174 patients in Europe, and 91 patients in North America. There were 585 patients who 
met eligibility criteria and were randomised in the study; all patients randomised received at 
least one dose of study medication (see Table 34). 
Table 34. Overall patient disposition—number (%) of all enrolled patients 
Conduct of the study 
The protocol had two global amendments: 
Amendment No. 1 (6 Apr 2009) - The purpose of this amendment was to update the sample size 
and to add a restriction for patients with known ILD. 
Amendment No. 2 (26 Jul 2010) - The purpose of this amendment was to add a restriction for 
concomitant medications. For safety reasons caution has to be exercised in combining afatinib 
with potent P-gp inhibitors and inducers.

Prior therapies 
About 40% of patients were treated with two lines of chemotherapy, 60% with one. Prior EGFR-
TK therapy is summarised in Table 38.

Table 38. Prior therapies in trial 1200.23/RS 
This trial was designed to enrol a patient population that was clinically enriched for EGFR 
mutations by requiring that all patients had undergone at least 12 weeks of prior therapy with 
erlotinib or gefitinib. Overall, 45.5% of patients had undergone ≥48 weeks of prior EGFR TKI 
therapy, and most patients (91.8%) had experienced clinical benefit from the prior EGFR TKI 
(45.0% had a best response of CR or PR, and 46.8% had experienced SD). Of the 141 patients 
with evaluable EGFR mutation test results (based on combined results from central and local 
testing), 96 patients (68%) were EGFR mutation positive. 
Numbers analysed 
Two analysis data sets were defined. The randomized set (RS) included all 585 randomised 
patients (390 randomised to afatinib and 195 randomised to placebo). The treated set (TS) 
included the randomised patients who took at least one dose of the randomised treatment. The 
efficacy results are based on the randomised set. The safety analyses are based on the treated 
set; thus, the safety parameters are evaluated based on data from the first date of drug intake 
to 28 days after the last drug intake. 
EGFR mutation results from tissue testing are shown in Table 39: 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/491185/2013 
Page 74/129 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
Table 39. EGFR mutation results from tissue testing 
Post-hoc analyses identified a patient subgroup considered to be highly clinically enriched for 
EGFR mutations (i.e. patients with CR/PR to prior EGFR TKI therapy and/or a long duration [≥48 
weeks] of prior EGFR TKI treatment): this subgroup comprised 391 patients with an estimated 
overall EGFR mutation positivity rate of 83%. The complementary subgroup not meeting the 
criteria for 'highly clinically enriched for EGFR mutations' (194 patients) had an estimated EGFR 
mutation positivity rate of 26%.  
Overall, 214 patients (36.6%) met the criteria of acquired resistance to erlotinib or gefitinib 
(PR/CR or at least 6 months of SD prior to PD and no systemic therapy between end of TKI

•  Study 1200.22 /Lux Lung 2: A Phase II single-arm trial of afatinib in non-small cell 
lung cancer patients with EGFR activating mutations 
The supportive trial 1200.22 was an exploratory open-label Phase II trial with a similar patient 
population as the pivotal trial 1200.32. Trial 1200.22 investigated afatinib as first- or second-line 
treatment (after chemotherapy) of EGFR TKI-naïve patients with EGFR mutations. The efficacy 
data from trial 1200.22 presented in this submission are based on an interim CTR (interim data 
cut-off 6 April 2011 and on an updated OS analysis (data cut-off 9 February 2012). 
Patients with Stage IIIB or Stage IV adenocarcinoma of the lung whose tumor harbored exon 18 
to exon 21 EGFR activating mutations and who had failed one line of cytotoxic chemotherapy or 
who had not received first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy (the latter only in Stage 2 of the trial per 
Amendment 1). All patients must have had biopsy samples available and the EGFR mutation 
status was determined in all patients prior to start of treatment with afatinib. 
Afatinib was administered at an initial starting dose of 50 mg daily that followed a two-stage 
design. In the first stage only patients progressing or relapsing after one prior cytotoxic 
chemotherapy regimen (including neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy) were allowed to enter 
CHMP assessment report

into the trial (second-line patients). An early stopping rule was in place and an end of Stage 1 
interim analysis was conducted after 40 second-line patients with NSCLC harboring activating 
EGFR mutations were treated and completed at least one 4-week course of treatment with 
afatinib. The trial passed from Stage 1 to Stage 2 after more than the required 16 second line 
patients achieved a complete or partial response (≥ 40% of patients with CR or PR). After the 
end of Stage 1 Interim Analysis on 3 March 2009 and amendments to the trial protocol, the trial 
was opened to first-line patients and subsequently the starting dose was lowered to 40 mg, 
resulting in four trial cohorts defined by line of treatment and afatinib starting dose (40 mg and 
50 mg). 
The primary efficacy endpoint was defined by the objective response rate (ORR) as determined 
by Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.0). Secondary endpoints included Clinical benefit 
(CR, PR, stable disease) determined by RECIST, time to objective response, duration of objective 
response, progression-free survival (PFS) time, overall survival (OS) time safety and 
pharmacokinetics. 
This is an interim report for an ongoing study with a cutoff date for data collection of 06 April 
2011 for all safety and efficacy data. 
An assessment of tumor response using RECIST was performed at the end of each course for the 
first three courses (i.e. every 4 weeks) and from thereon every other course (every 8 weeks). 
For the primary endpoint, adjudicated independent tumor assessment of the tumor response was 
performed by a central imaging unit.  
Statistical methods were based on calculated ORR with exact 95% confidence interval; Kaplan-
Meier estimation of PFS and OS; descriptive statistics for all other endpoints 
The study enrolled a total of 129 patients including 61 first-line patients (23 who received a 
starting dose of 40 mg and 38 who received a starting dose of 50 mg) and 68 second-line 
patients (7 who received a starting dose of 40 mg and 61 who received a starting dose of 50 
mg). The patients’ mean age at study entry was 62 years, and most patients were Asian 
(86.8%), had never smoked (63.6%) and had an ECOG performance score of zero (64.3%). 
Nearly all patients had clinical Stage IV NSCLC (93.8%) with one (42.6%) or two (27.9%) 
metastatic sites, mostly located in the lung, bone and brain. 
Results for the primary and secondary endpoints are summarised in Tables 44-46.

•  Study 1200.42 /LUX-Lung 5 
The supportive trial 1200.42 was a Phase III randomised trial of afatinib plus weekly paclitaxel 
vs. the investigators choice of chemotherapy following afatinib monotherapy in NSCLC patients 
failing previous erlotinib or gefitinib treatment. 
The interim report includes only data from Part A of trial, in which all patients received afatinib 
monotherapy. The data from the ongoing Part B (in which patients with progressive disease who 
derived clinical benefit from afatinib over at least 12 weeks in Part A were randomised to receive 
either afatinib plus paclitaxel or the investigator's choice of chemotherapy) are not included in 
the interim report and are not relevant for this application. All descriptions in the following 
narrative refer to trial Part A.  
Objective: To further explore the efficacy and safety of afatinib as second- or later-line therapy in 
patients with NSCLC and progressive disease after chemotherapy and at least 12 weeks of 
treatment with erlotinib or gefitinib. 
The objective of the interim analysis was to reaffirm the safety and clinical benefit of afatinib 
monotherapy in a treatment-refractory population of patients who were likely to be EGFR 
mutation positive; in addition, the interim analysis was to support any regulatory submission for 
afatinib treatment for patients with NSCLC.  
Methods: Trial Part A was a global, multi-centre, open-label, non-randomised Phase III trial in 
patients with NSCLC of stage IIIB (with pleural or pericardial effusion) or stage IV who had 
previously received treatment with at least 1 line of cytotoxic chemotherapy for advanced or 
metastatic disease and either gefitinib or erlotinib over at least 12 weeks, on which they had 
undergone disease progression. The original trial protocol stated that patients without prior 
chemotherapy were eligible if they had a known EGFR mutation after treatment with a reversible 
EGFR TKI or if they had derived clinical benefit for 6 months or longer from previous treatment 
with erlotinib or gefitinib; a global protocol amendment (Protocol Amendment 4, dated 12 
January 2011) changed this to include only patients pretreated with at least 1 line of 
chemotherapy and at least 12 weeks of treatment with erlotinib or gefitinib. The results 
presented below are based on an interim data cut-off on 12 December 2011; the study is 
currently ongoing.  
Patients were treated with a starting dose of 50 mg/day afatinib monotherapy, with the 
continuous dosing regimen to be continued until disease progression. An afatinib dose- reduction 
scheme from 50 mg to 40 mg and then to 30 mg was to be followed in the case of grade ≥3 
drug-related AEs; grade ≥2 worsening of renal function; grade ≥2 diarrhoea for 2 or more 
consecutive days despite anti-diarrhoeal treatment/hydration; or grade ≥2 nausea/vomiting for 7 
or more consecutive days despite antiemetic treatment/hydration.  
The primary efficacy endpoint specified for the interim analysis of Part A of the trial was PFS 
based on investigator assessment (calculated as the time from treatment start to the occurrence 
of PD or death), which was to be assessed when all patients had been treated in Part A for at 
least 12 weeks. However, patients might have discontinued treatment early; therefore, not all 
patients included in the interim analysis received study treatment for 12 weeks. Assessment of 
tumour response was performed at 6-weekly intervals in Part A and evaluated according to 
RECIST version 1.1. The secondary endpoint was objective response (CR or PR, based on 
investigator assessment) to afatinib monotherapy in Part A; further endpoints comprised time to 
and duration of objective response, OS, tumour shrinkage, disease control, and duration of 
disease control. Safety was assessed in terms of the incidence and intensity of AEs, graded 
according to CTCAE version 3.0, AEs of special interest (including skin reactions and 
gastrointestinal events), laboratory evaluation, and cardiac left ventricular function. In addition 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/491185/2013 
Page 82/129 
 
 
 
 
  
  
to the standard analysis of AEs by primary SOC and preferred term, safety analyses were 
performed using grouped terms (based on SMQs) for predefined events of special interest.  
Results - Efficacy: A total of 1154 patients were entered into the study and received at least 1 
dose of afatinib (with a starting dose of 50 mg/day). The mean age was 60.1 years; 56.7% of 
patients were female. The majority of patients were Eastern Asian (42.5%) or Caucasian 
(39.4%). The percentages of patients from Eastern Asian countries and from Europe and 
Australia were 43.0% and 52.5%, respectively. The ECOG performance score was 0 in 29.5% of 
patients, 1 in 59.9% of patients, and 2 in 10.6% of patients. The percentage of never-smokers 
was 53.6%; 11.0% of patients had smoked <15 pack years and stopped smoking >1 year before 
diagnosis, and 35.4% were other ex-smokers or current smokers. Almost all patients (98.6%) 
had NSCLC stage IV at screening; 1.3% of patients had stage IIIb disease. The predominant 
tumour histology was adenocarcinoma (85.4%). Patients with squamous cell carcinoma 
constituted 7.9% of the trial population. All but 17 patients had metastatic disease. The most 
frequent metastatic sites were the bones (38.6%), followed by pleural effusion (32.1%), liver 
(22.4%), and brain (22.1%).  
The trial was designed to enrol a trial population that was clinically enriched for EGFR mutations 
by requiring that all patients had undergone at least 12 weeks of prior therapy with erlotinib or 
gefitinib. All patients had received at least 1 previous chemotherapy; 64.6% had received ≥3 
previous chemotherapies. Overall, 37.3% of patients had received >48 weeks of treatment with 
an EGFR TKI, and the majority of patients (73.7%) had experienced clinical benefit from prior 
EGFR TKI treatment (best response of CR/PR in 32.1% of patients, best response of SD in 41.6% 
of patients). A total of 84 patients had evaluable central testing results for tumour tissue 
samples, including 49 patients carrying EGFR mutations (i.e. 58.3% of patients with evaluable 
samples) and 35 patients without EGFR mutations (41.7%). The subgroup of patients who were 
'highly clinically enriched for EGFR mutations' (i.e. had a best response of CR or PR to prior EGFR 
TKI therapy and/or ≥48 weeks treatment with a prior EGFR TKI) comprised 598 patients with an 
estimated EGFR mutation positivity rate of 83%. In the complementary subgroup of patients who 
were not highly clinically enriched for EGFR mutations (n=556), the estimated EGFR mutation 
positivity rate was 33%.  
The interim analysis included 872 patients (75.6%) with a PFS event, i.e. disease progression or 
death. Median PFS (based on investigator assessment) was 3.25 months (95% CI 2.85, 3.81). 
The probability to be alive and progression-free at 6 months was 24.5%. The percentage of 
patients with confirmed objective tumour response was 7.6% (95% CI 6.16, 9.31). The 
availability of OS data for the interim analysis was limited, because survival data of patients who 
did not enter Part B of the trial were only collected up to the date of study discontinuation of 
each patient. The number of patients with an OS event included in the interim analysis was 301 
(26.1%). Median OS was 13.70 months (95% CI 12.61, 14.88).  
Median PFS was longer in patients whose tumours harboured EGFR mutations (4.17 months) 
than in mutation negative patients (2.62 months). This was in line with the longer PFS (4.17 
months) in patients 'highly clinically enriched for EGFR mutations'. In patients who were 'highly 
clinically enriched' as well as in patients who were EGFR mutation positive, the 6-month PFS rate 
was 29.9%. Results confirmed the findings of trial 1200.23 (see Table 50).

•  Study 1200.34 /LUX-Lung 6 
The supportive study 1200.34 / LUX-Lung 6 was a randomised, open-label, phase III study of 
afatinib versus chemotherapy as first-line treatment for patients with stage IIIB or IV 
adenocarcinoma of the lung harbouring an EGFR-activating mutation in the Asian population. 
Dates of Trial: From 27 April 2010 to 29 October 2012 (cut-off date for the primary analysis) 
Objectives: To compare the efficacy and safety of afatinib monotherapy with gemcitabine / 
cisplatin chemotherapy as first-line treatment in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-naïve patients with Stage IIIB (with cytologically-proven pleural 
effusion or pericardial effusion) or Stage IV adenocarcinoma of the lung harbouring an EGFR 
mutation. 
Methodology: Two-arm, randomised (2:1 ratio), open-label, active-controlled, parallel-group 
comparison of afatinib versus gemcitabine / cisplatin. The study was planned to enrol 360 
patients, i.e. 240 in the afatinib arm and 120 in the gemcitabine /cisplatin chemotherapy arm 
Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion: Patients with Stage IIIB (with cytologically-proven 
pleural effusion or pericardial effusion) or Stage IV adenocarcinoma of the lung with an EGFR 
mutation, who had no prior systemic treatment for locally-advanced, recurrent or metastatic 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who were EGFR TKI-naïve, and not eligible for standard 
curative-intent treatment with surgery or chemoradiotherapy. 
Treatments: 
Afatinib (film-coated tablets): 40 mg once daily (lq.d.) with possible dose escalation to 50 mg 
q.d. and dose reduction to 40 mg q.d. (if applicable), 30 mg q.d., or 20 mg q.d. (according to 
the protocol-defined dose escalation and dose reduction scheme), if required. 
Gemcitabine (lyophilised powder) / cisplatin (solution for infusion): Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m² as 
an infusion over 30 minutes followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m² as an infusion on Day 1 of each 21-
day treatment course; gemcitabine 1000 mg/m² as an infusion over 30 minutes on Day 8. 
Chemotherapy could be delayed or the dose could be reduced in accordance with the guidance in 
the current summary of product characteristics. 
Each treatment course was planned to be 21 days. For afatinib, patients received continuous 
daily dosing as long as they did not develop disease progression. For gemcitabine / cisplatin, 
patients were to receive a maximum of 6 treatment courses unless they developed disease 
progression. 
Criteria for evaluation Efficacy: 
The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by 
central independent review according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/491185/2013 
Page 84/129 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
Key secondary endpoints included objective response (defined as complete response [CR], or 
partial response [PR]) according to RECIST version 1.1 (time to objective response, duration of 
objective response); disease control (defined as a patient with objective response or stable 
disease [SD]) according to RECIST version 1.1 (duration of disease control); overall survival 
(OS). Other secondary endpoints included tumour shrinkage; change from baseline in body 
weight; change from baseline in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance 
status; Health- Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) as measured by standardised questionnaires 
(European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire C30 
[QLQ-C30] and its lung cancer-specific module LC13 [QLQLC13]), with the main endpoints being 
cough (QLQ-LC13 question 1), dyspnoea (QLQ-LC13 questions 3-5; QLQ-C30 question 8), and 
pain (QLQ-C30 questions 9 and 19; QLQ-LC13 questions 10, 11, 12); afatinib pharmacokinetics. 
Statistical methods: The aim of this trial was to determine whether afatinib was more effective 
than gemcitabine / cisplatin as a first-line treatment in patients with Stage IIIB or IV 
adenocarcinoma of the lung harbouring an EGFR mutation. The primary analysis was the analysis 
of PFS based on central independent review. It was planned for after 217 patients developed 
progressive disease (based on central independent review) or died. An analysis of OS was also 
planned for this time point. A second OS analysis is scheduled for when the data are considered 
mature enough for meaningful analysis, this is expected to be when approximately 209 deaths 
have been observed. 
The stratified log-rank test (stratification factor at randomisation by EGFR mutation category 
[L858R vs. Del 19 vs. Other]) was used to test PFS for the effect of afatinib at the 2-sided alpha-
level of 0.05.  
Efficacy  results: 
A total of 910 patients were screened in 36 centres in 3 Asian countries; 364 patients with a 
positive EGFR mutation test were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to treatment with afatinib or 
chemotherapy. 
Randomisation was stratified by EGFR mutation category. Demographic characteristics were 
balanced between the treatment arms: patients had a median age of 58.0 years (range 27 to 
79 years); the trial included substantial proportions of females (65.4%) and never smokers 
(76.9%); most patients (75.5%) had an ECOG performance score of 1 at baseline. The 
TheraScreen®: EGFR29 Mutation Kit (QIAGEN Manchester Ltd, Manchester, UK) was used to 
categorise each patient’s EGFR mutation status. Most patients had a tumour sample with an 
EGFR mutation categorised as ‘Common’ (89.0%), comprising Del 19 alone (51.1%) or L858R 
(37.9%). All other patients (11.0%) had a tumour sample with various different EGFR mutations 
or mutation combinations, categorised as ‘Other’ EGFR mutations. Most patients (94.0%) were 
NSCLC Stage IV at screening, with 22 patients (6.0%) having Stage IIIB disease (disease staging 
according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system, 6th edition). Overall 
31.9% of patients had pleural effusion at baseline and bone was the most frequent site of distant 
metastatic disease (44.2% of patients).

•  Other studies 
The 4 trials discussed above are complemented by 2 additional trials (1200.33 and .72). Trial 
1200.33 was an open-label, uncontrolled Phase I/II trial performed exclusively in Japan (N = 
74). In the Phase II part of trial 1200.33, only patients pre-treated with 1 or 2 lines of 
chemotherapy and with erlotinib or gefitinib were included, thus constituting a similar patient 
population as those of trials 1200.23 and 1200.42. The results from trial 1200.33 presented in 
this submission are based on an interim CTR of the Phase II part of the trial (see Table 54). 
Efficacy was observed in the heavily pretreated population. The median number of courses

(range) was 2.5 (1 to 18). Six out of 12 patients had tumour size reductions with 3 patients 
achieving prolonged stable disease (SD). One patient with EGFR exon 19 deletion remained 
progression free for 310 days despite the presence of the T790M resistance mutation. Of the 12 
patients, 6 patients were assessed to have SD: the EGFR mutation status was wild-type for 4 
patients and EGFR exon 19 deletion and T790M for 2 patients. 
Table 54. Key results of trial 1200.33 
The open-label, uncontrolled Phase II trial 1200.72 investigated afatinib in patients without EGFR 
mutations. The primary objective of this open-label, single-arm trial was to explore the efficacy 
of afatinib defined by the objective response rate (complete response [CR], partial response 
[PR]) and disease control (CR, PR, stable disease [SD]) as determined by the Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) 1.1 criteria in patients with advanced (stage 
IIIB/IV) adenocarcinoma of the lung harbouring wild-type Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 
(EGFR). Main inclusion/exclusion criteria included patients (n=47) with locally advanced or 
metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung (stage IIIB, IV) following second line cytotoxic 
chemotherapy, whose tumours harbour wild-type EGFR. No patients in the FAS had a confirmed 
objective response. One patient had an unconfirmed PR. Nine patients (24%) in the FAS had a 
best overall confirmed response of SD. Median duration of disease control in these 9 patients was 
19.29 weeks (range 11.6 to 28.0 weeks). Key results are included in Table 55.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The pivotal study for this application (LUX Lung 3) was a conventionally designed, well 
conducted, chemotherapy (pemetrexed/cisplatin) comparative study in treatment naïve patients 
with activating EGFR-TK mutations. The results (PFS HR 0.58) are considered of clinically benefit 
and statistically robust and in-line with what has been shown before for the reversible EGFR-TKIs 
erlotinib and gefitinib (see Table 59). As supportive evidence of efficacy, the results of study LUX 
Lung 6 have been submitted in response to the CHMP LoQ. This cisplatin/gemcitabine 
comparative study also showed superiority in terms of PFS (HR 0.28) in treatment naïve patients 
with activating EGFR-TK mutations. 
As for the other EGFR-TKIs in studies conducted with similar designs, no survival benefit (HR 
0.91) was shown in LUX Lung 3 (and 6), interpreted as being due to high cross-over rates to 
EGFR-TKI treatment. In this regards OS data has not shown any negative trends on survival and 
it is considered reassuring.

The relative efficacy of afatinib, gefitinib and erlotinib is currently not known, as data with direct 
head to head comparison are not available. Further information on the efficacy of afatinib versus 
gefitinib will be available from a currently ongoing comparative head-to-head study. 
Additional supportive evidence based on study LUX-Lung 2  have shown that that the activity of 
afatinib in patients with EGFR mutations is not limited by line of therapy; both first- and second-
line patients evidenced response rates. Specifically, by independent review, first-line patients 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/491185/2013 
Page 91/129 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
treated with an afatinib starting dose of either 40 mg or 50 mg had a 66% confirmed ORR and a 
12- month median PFS, and a median OS has not yet been reached; second-line patients treated 
with 50 mg of afatinib had a 57% confirmed ORR, a 8.3-month median PFS, and a 24-month 
median OS. 
The treatment effect of afatinib in PFS was stronger in the subgroup of patients with common 
activating EGFR mutations (Del 19, L858R). In the complementary subgroup of uncommon 
mutations results are not consistent among trials, showing opposite trends in studies Lux-Lung 3 
and 6 (HR 1.89 vs HR 0.55). In addition, non-clinical data has shown activity in vitro and/or in 
vivo models expressing EGFR mutants harbouring both common and uncommon mutations, and 
only limited activity was observed in NSCLC tumours with insertion mutations in exon 20. Taking 
into account all available clinical and non-clinical data the CHMP did not find strong evidence to 
exclude patients harbouring uncommon mutations. 
LUX-Lung 1 was planned as a confirmatory study, but failed to meet its primary objective, i.e. to 
show a survival benefit over placebo in patients previously treated with one to two lines of 
chemotherapy and with secondary resistance to erlotinib/gefitinib. To undertake a confirmatory, 
global study third-fourth line study in patients with NSCLC with mandatory tumour biopsies prior 
to enrolment would have been unfeasible at the time when the study was initiated (April 2008). 
Study baseline mutation status is thus largely missing and, e.g. the proportion of the resistance 
mutation T790M in patients failing erlotinib/gefitinib can only be estimated based on circulating 
DNA and appears to be about 1/3. 
In study LUX-Lung 1 secondary resistance was defined on clinical grounds in the protocol; stable 
disease for at least 3 months followed by PD. Data external to the study, however, showed that 
these criteria were too liberal to identify patients with tumours with EGFR TK activating 
mutations being a prerequisite for meaningful activity at least for gefitinib (estimated 68% of 
patients included harbour EGFR TK activating mutations). By restricting the clinical definition of 
secondary resistance to patients with at least PR or stable disease for 48 weeks followed by PD, 
sufficient enrichment was achieved (83% of patients included harbour EGFR TK activating 
mutations). 
In the subgroup clinically enriched for secondary resistance to erlotinib/gefitinib therapy (the 
proposed indication) the PFS HR was 0.3, median benefit 3+ months. No statistically significant 
OS benefit was shown (HR 0.9). It is likely that next-line therapies administered to a larger 
extent in the placebo arm contributed to lack of an observed effect in OS.  
An unexpected finding was that OS was worse in the complementary subgroup to the highly 
clinically enriched for secondary resistance (HR 1.5, update 1.2) despite a statistically significant 
PFS HR benefit of 0.67. Further analyses showed that these findings were driven by patients in 
the complementary set with a short TKI-free interval prior to study enrolment (<4 weeks). No 
explanation to this finding was identified. Of note the median survival was exceptionally long in 
the placebo group. As these analyses were not protected by stratification, a reasonable 
explanation would be that favourable prognostic factors were enriched in the placebo group, 
even though it is hard to understand why median PFS would be only less than 2months in this 
group resulting in a favourable PFS HR of 0.45, p=0.013.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/491185/2013 
Page 92/129 
 
  
  
Attempts were also made to investigate whether there were signs indicating that afatinib induces 
resistance to next-line chemotherapy. Data are not conclusive, but there are no signs of major 
effects on the activity of next line chemotherapy in LUX-Lung 1 or 3.  
Whilst the attempt to retrospectively identify patients with secondary resistance to treatment 
with gefitinib/erlotinib was considered justified, unexpected findings, whether mechanistically 
related or compatible with imbalances in prognostic factors, cast serious doubt on the validity of 
the results in the enriched population in patients resistant to EGFR-TKIs. 
Additional expert consultation 
The oncology Scientific Advisory group (SAG-O) was convened on 11 July 2013 to discuss the 
benefits of afatinib from a clinical perspective in particular in the second and third line settings 
i.e. after chemotherapy and EGFR TKI respectively. 
The SAG-O provided advice on the following questions raised by the CHMP: 
1.  Has the efficacy been adequately demonstrated in patients resistant to EGFR-TKIs? The 
inconsistent trends in the population enriched for EGFR mutations and the 
complementary subgroup as well as the differences in post-progression outcomes in 
study Lux Lung 1 study should be taken into account in the discussion. 
The SAG agreed that efficacy has not been adequately demonstrated in patients resistant to 
EGFR-TKIs. The SAG endorsed the position of the Rapporteurs as stated in their assessment 
reports. 
The Phase III study LUX-Lung 1 comparing afatinib versus placebo in NSCLC patients failing 
erlotinib/gefitinib did not meet its primary endpoint of Overall Survival (OS) (HR=1.08, CI 95% 
0.862-1.346, p=0.7428). Although activity in progression free survival (PFS) was observed as a 
secondary endpoint (HR=0.38, CI 95% 0.31, 0.48), p<0.0001), it did not translate into a 
survival benefit to the patients. 
Post-hoc analysis performed by the company further enriched the population of EGFR mutation 
patients to 83% (originally estimated 68%). Although OS in the enriched population improved 
(HR=0.91, CI 95% 0.73, 1.14), there are too many uncertainties related to the post-hoc nature 
of the analysis which preclude to provide enough evidence to demonstrate a benefit in this 
patient population. In addition, it was worrisome that the complementary set had a negative 
trend in survival (HR=1.23, CI 95% 0.89, 1.70) and that patients in the afatinib arm in this 
complementary set experienced an increased number of on-treatment deaths compared to 
placebo. 
Moreover, further subgroup analysis have shown that patients in the complementary for whom 
the EGFR TKI-free interval was less than 4 weeks (not affected by subsequent therapies), had an 
even poorer survival outcome (HR=1.69, CI 0.97, 2.93). 
2.  The experts are invited to discuss whether efficacy in patients previously treated with 
chemotherapy can be reasonably foreseen in the light of the available knowledge and 
whether it makes sense to split the indication between 1st and 2nd line given that it is 
expectable that any patient with mutational positive status is going to be treated with 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/491185/2013 
Page 93/129 
 
 
 
  
  
TKIs instead of chemotherapy. Or, by contrary, does the SAG-O think that additional 
evidence is deemed necessary, and can be reasonably obtained, in patients previously 
treated with chemotherapy. 
The SAG agreed that efficacy can be reasonably expected in patients with advanced non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating sensitizing EGFR mutations previously treated with 
chemotherapy, although it was acknowledged that there is no definitive evidence that 1st and 2nd 
line treatments (where 2nd line indicates after 1st line chemotherapy) have the same benefit-risk 
balance based on the results of the pivotal Phase III study LUX-Lung 3. The SAG was of the 
opinion that there are no mechanistic arguments that would justify a detrimental effect of 
chemotherapy on the efficacy of TKIs in 2nd line. Moreover, prognostic factors are not expected 
to change significantly due to previous treatment with chemotherapy. 
In addition, anti-tumour activity in patients previously treated with chemotherapy has been 
shown based on the Phase II study LUX-Lung 2 in terms of response rates (ORR=57.1) and there 
is convincing evidence from several meta-analyses available in the literature where other TKIs 
have shown equal activity in 1st and 2nd line. 
Nevertheless, the SAG members highlighted the need to better understand the safety profile of 
afatinib in comparison with other TKIs. It was acknowledged that comparative data in the 2nd line 
setting is not currently available, and therefore the SAG would like to see further safety data 
comparing afatinib with other TKIs in order to help the clinical decision making. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy of afatinib vs. chemotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with NSCLC with EGFR 
mutations has been shown based on the pivotal trial Phase III trial 1200.32/Lux-Lung 3 in terms 
of improved PFS (HR=0.577, CI 95% 0.425,0.789, p=0.0004). Results from this study are 
considered clinically meaningful. Patients treated with afatinib in first line of NSCLC 
(adenocarcinoma) have a higher probability of remain stable without tumour progression than 
those treated with the traditional chemotherapy (gain of 4.2 months). This positive effect on the 
PFS was supported by sensitivity analyses. In addition, the subgroups analyses on PFS both the 
IRC as the investigators give robustness to the main analysis. Secondary variables point out in 
the same direction, though data on OS are still immature so as to observe a clear trend. 
The benefit of afatinib therapy in patients with secondary resistance to EGFR-TKIs has not been 
convincingly demonstrated. The post hoc analyses aiming at identifying the target population 
was not protected by stratification and imbalances in the complementary set favouring the 
placebo arm cast serious doubt on the outcome in the enriched population. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The examination of safety included all available data on the use of afatinib in patients and in 
healthy volunteers; patients and subjects were included if they had taken at least 1 dose of 
afatinib. Included in the safety evaluation are a total of 48 clinical trials in overall 3868 patients 
with different tumour types and 7 trials in a total of 181 healthy volunteers or non-cancer 
patients. In addition, safety data from 1151 NSCLC patients treated under named-patient use 
(NPU) and from 44 patients treated in investigator-initiated studies (IIS) were provided.

Generally,  for  all  trials,  the  afatinib  starting  dose  was  to  be  reduced  according  to  a  pre-defined 
dose reduction scheme if intolerable adverse events occurred (see Tables 62 and 63).

treatment group (SAF−3 and SAF−4) 
The  proportion  of  EGFR  TKI-naïve  patients  who  increased their  daily  afatinib dose  from  40 mg  to 
50 mg was small (SAF-1: 16 patients = 7.0%; SAF-2: 30 patients = 6.0%). In the pooled analysis 
of patients on 40 mg as starting dose (SAF-2), about 40 % reduced to 30 mg and about 10% to 
20  mg.  Dose  escalation  was  possible  based  on  rather  strict  criteria.  The  pattern  was  similar  in 
those who started with 50 mg, i.e. about 40% reduced to 40 mg and 10% to 30mg. The pattern 
over time is illustrated by data from SAF-3 in Table 64.

Adverse events leading to death  
Adverse  events  with  fatal  outcome  are  summarised  in  for  SAF  1  and  3  in  Tables  74  and  75. 
Death due to progression of the underlying disease was a frequent event. As a result death was 
recorded as an outcome event rather than an adverse event, unless it was the consequence of an 
SAE in which case the fatal SAE was reported. 
Table 74. Adverse events with a fatal outcome, according to study treatment by preferred term 
/ SAF-1 (chemotherapy/afatinib 40 mg). 
When considering the frequency of those fatal events not attributed to disease progression by 
the investigator in SAF-1, the frequencies (not corrected for differences in time at risk) were 
similar in the two treatment groups (2.6% in the afatinib arm compared to 1.8% in the control 
arm).

Table  75.  Adverse  events  with  a  fatal  outcome  according  to  study  treatment  and  by  preferred 
term / SAF-3 (placebo/afatinib 50 mg). 
Post hoc the study population was dichotomised in patients showing secondary resistance to 
erlotinib/gefitinib and the complementary subgroup. Despite longer time at risk in the enriched 
population, AEs with a fatal outcome were as frequently reported in the afatinib arm as in the 
placebo arm (10%). In the complementary group and despite more similar durations of time on 
study drug, however, the event rate was clearly higher in the afatinib arm, (14.2 % vs. 3.3). The 
Kaplan-Meier analysis is presented in Figure 14.

Adverse events of special interest 
Diarrhoea 
Diarrhoea  was  very  frequent  (>86%)  with  afatinib  treatment  regardless  of  whether  the  patient 
was  EGFR  TKI  treatment-naïve  (40  mg  starting  dose)  or  had  been  pre-treated  with  EGFR  TKIs 
(50  mg  starting  dose)  (see  Table  76).  In  most  patients,  the  first  episode  of  diarrhoea  occurred 
within the first 14 days of treatment with afatinib.  Dehydration and renal impairment can be the 
more serious sequelae of diarrhoea, occurring subsequently to gastrointestinal fluid loss. In SAF-
1,  the  incidence  of  dehydration  was  higher  in  the  afatinib  group  (3.1%)  than  in  the 
chemotherapy  group  (1.8%).  Also  in  SAF-3,  dehydration  was  more  frequently  reported  for 
afatinib (4.6%) than for placebo (0.0%). In the afatinib trials, the incidence of renal impairment 
occurred  with  an  overall  incidence  of  5.6%  (SAF-5).  In  SAF-1,  renal  impairment  was  less 
frequent  with  afatinib  40 mg  (6.1%) than  with  chemotherapy  (16.2%),  as  was  the  incidence of 
drug-related  renal  impairment  (3.5%  vs.  14.4%).  In  SAF-3,  renal  impairment  was  reported  for 
5.4%  of  patients  receiving  afatinib  50 mg  and  for  1.5%  of  patients  receiving  placebo.  The 
incidence of drug-related renal impairment in the afatinib group was 3.6%, whereas none of the 
renal  events  in  the  placebo  group  was  considered  drug-related.  In  both  SAF-1  and  SAF-3,  few 
patients (<1%) discontinued treatment permanently due to renal impairment

Rash/acne 
Rash/acne  was  a  very  common  event  in  patients  treated  with  afatinib  regardless  of  whether 
patients were EGFR TKI-naïve or pre-treated (see Table 77). In almost all patients in the afatinib 
groups  was  the  occurrence  of  rash/acne+  considered  as  being  related  to  study  drug.  For  the 
majority of patients, the event started within the first 28 days of treatment (SAF-1: 79.7%, SAF-
3: 65.1%). Substantial proportions of patients had recovered from rash/acne+ by the time of the 
data  cut-off  for  the  submission.  In  almost  all  cases,  the  occurrence  of  rash/acne+  could  be 
managed by dose reduction or the instigation of additional therapy; less than 2% of patients in 
the afatinib groups permanently discontinued due to rash/acne.

Stomatitis 
Stomatitis  was  a  very  frequent  adverse  event  in  the  afatinib  groups  with  slightly  higher 
incidences  in  EGFR  TKI-naïve  patients  than  in  EGFR  TKI  pre-treated  patients  (see  Table  78). 
Almost all cases of stomatitis+ were considered drug-related, both in the afatinib groups and in 
the comparator groups. Stomatitis+ on treatment with afatinib tended to develop within the first 
14 days of treatment (SAF-1: 57.2%, SAF-3: 42.9%).

Ocular effects  
The most frequent adverse events reported were conjunctivitis, dry eyes, and blepharitis as. As 
such,  ocular  effects  generally  manifested  as  superficial  corneal  irritation  and  inflammation.  In 
study 1200.32 (SAF-1), 22.7% of patients in the afatinib 40 mg starting dose group experienced 
superficial  ocular  effects+.  In  most  cases  in  the  afatinib  group  (22.2%)  the  severity  of  ocular 
effects+  was  CTCAE  grade  1  or  2  and  no  events  were  classified  as  SAEs.  One  patient  was 
reported to have keratitis (grade 3) that was classified as non-serious and resolved.

Hepatic impairment 
In  study  1200.32  (SAF-1),  according  to the  Applicant  comparable  proportions  of  patients in  the 
afatinib  40  mg  starting  dose  and  chemotherapy  groups  experienced  adverse  events  of  hepatic 
impairment+  (17.5%  of  patients  in  the  afatinib  group  and  11.7%  in  the  chemotherapy  group; 
hazard ratio 0.83, p=0.5858) (see Table 79). The most frequent comprised adverse events were 
hepatic  enzyme  elevations  for  both  treatment  groups  (16.6%  of  patients  in  the  afatinib  group 
and  10.8%  of  patients  in  the  chemotherapy  group).  In  afatinib-treated  patients  adverse  events 
of  hepatic  enzyme  elevations  were  mostly  of  grade  1  or  2;  no  event  led  to  treatment 
discontinuation.  All  grade 3  events  were transient  and  did  not  result in  afatinib  discontinuation. 
In  study  1200.23  (SAF-3),  slightly  higher  proportions  of  patients  in  the  afatinib  50  mg  starting 
dose group experienced adverse events of hepatic impairment+ (8.2% of patients in the afatinib 
group  vs.  3.6%  in  the  placebo  group;  hazard  ratio  1.55,  p=0.2992).  The  most  frequent  events 
reported  comprised  adverse  events  of  hepatic  enzyme  elevations  for  both  treatment  groups.  In 
patients  treated  with  afatinib  these  events  were  mostly  of  grade  1  or  2,  and  did  not  lead  to 
discontinuation.  Three  patients  in  the  afatinib  group  experienced  grade  3  adverse  events  of 
hepatic enzyme elevation, which were transient and did not result in discontinuation of the study 
medication.  In  the  larger  SAF-5  set,  10.1%  of  patients  (95%  CI  9.1%,  11.1%)  experienced 
adverse events indicative of hepatic impairment. 
Table  79.  Incidende  of  hepatic  impairment  adverse  events  identified  using  modified  SMQs, 
according to analysis set and treatment group/SAF-1 (chemotherapy/afatinib 40 mg) and SAF-3 
(placebo/afatinib). 
Overall  7  patients  in  SAF-5,  experienced  fatal  hepatic  impairment+:  of  these  3  patients 
experienced  fatal  hepatic  adverse  events  that  were  considered  drug-related  (as  previously 
described):  1  patient  in  trial  1200.23  had  fatal  events  of  acute  renal  failure  and  acute  hepatic 
failure  that  began  approximately  10  days  after  starting  afatinib  treatment,  and  occurred  in  a 
patient  with  hepatitis  B  infection;  1  patient  in  trial  1200.42  with  cytolitic  hepatitis  and  disease 
progression; and 1 patient in trial 1200.42 with congestive heart failure and hepatic failure. The 
4 remaining fatal hepatic impairment+ adverse events were considered not related to the study 
medication but were associated with progressive disease and/or sepsis. 
The frequency of liver enzyme elevations is summarised in Table 80.

Cardiac safety 
The  Phase  II  trial  1200.24  in  patients  with  advanced  solid  tumours  was  specifically  designed  to 
assess a potential impact of afatinib on the QT-interval Table 81.

matched mean / trial 1200.24 
Further  information  on  the  possible  effect  of  afatinib  on  the  QT-interval  was  provided  by  the 
retrospective, integrated analysis of ECG data from 4 Phase I studies with afatinib monotherapy 
in  patients  with  advanced  solid  tumours.  In  addition,  12-lead  resting  ECGs  were  recorded  at 
screening, during treatment (in approximately 12-weekly intervals), and at the end of treatment 
in the controlled studies 1200.32 (EGFR TKI-naïve patients) and 1200.23 (EGFR TKI pre-treated 
patients)  and  were  analysed  regarding  a  possible  effect  of  afatinib  on  the  QT-interval. 
Furthermore, afatinib studies included regular assessments of the left ventricular ejection fraction 
(LVEF)  by  Multiple  Gated  Acquisition  scan  (MUGA)  or  echocardiography.  All  analyses  of  ECG 
parameters and of LVEF were descriptive in nature.  
The integrated analysis of ECG data from 4 Phase I studies with afatinib monotherapy in cancer 
patients did not suggest any clinically meaningful effect of afatinib on heart rate, atrioventricular 
node conduction (PR interval), or cardiac depolarisation (QRS interval). In trial 1200.24, afatinib 
50  mg  (given  as  a  single  dose  or  as  a  daily  dose  for  14 days)  did  not  prolong  the  QT  interval. 
CHMP assessment report

Findings  based  on  QTcF  were  supported  by  those  for  the  heart  rate  and  the  uncorrected  QT 
interval.  Afatinib  did  not  alter  the  repolarisation  morphology  nor  increased  or  changed  other 
cardiac  abnormalities  as  assessed  by  standard  ECG  monitoring.  No  clinically  meaningful 
relationship  was  observed  between  afatinib  exposure  and  changes  in  the  QT-interval.  Likewise, 
no  clinically  relevant  changes  in  QTcF  were  observed  in  the  controlled  Phase  III-studies  with 
afatinib starting doses of 40 mg (trial 1200.32) or 50 mg (trial 1200.23).  
The  assessment  of  LVEF  based  on  MUGA  or  echocardiography  showed  that  treatment  with 
afatinib did not result in a LVEF reduction relative to chemotherapy (SAF-1) or placebo (SAF-3) 
(see Table 82). The incidence of heart failure events or decreases in LVEF (reported as AEs) was 
low; in the large SAF-5, 1.4% of patients were reported with these events (heart failure events: 
0.8%; decrease in LVEF: 0.5%). 
Table  82.  Incidence  of  adverse  events  identified  using  the  modified  SMQ  for  cardiac  failure 
and/or decreased LVEF / SAF-1,2 and 5. 
Interstitial lung disease  
The occurrence of ILD-like events was evaluated based on the largest safety set SAF-5. Using the 
broad SMQ search, 59 patients (1.5%) in SAF-5 were identified with ILD-like events, and 
38 patients (1.0%) with ILD-like events of grade 3 or higher; 15 events (0.4%) were fatal. It 
should be considered that the broad SMQ used for identifying ILD-like events included events 
such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonitis, and radiation pneumonitis. Therefore, 
the ILD-like events considered as drug-related by the investigator are regarded as more 
informative. A total of 28 patients (0.7%) in SAF-5 were reported with drug-related ILD-like 
events, including 5 patients who died due to these events. Drug-related ILD was reported for 20 
patients; of those, 2 patients died. 
Laboratory findings 
When considering trial 1200.32 (SAF-1) and taking into account the difference in study drug 
exposure between treatment groups, a higher proportion of patients in the chemotherapy group 
experienced a possibly clinically significant haemoglobin abnormality (46.3% of patients vs. 
8.9% in the afatinib 40 mg starting dose group); however higher proportions of patients treated 
with afatinib experienced a possibly clinically significant laboratory abnormalities in potassium

(8.4% of patients vs. 1.9% in the chemotherapy group), AST (8.4% vs. 0.9%), and ALT (10.2% 
vs. 4.6%) levels (see Table 83). 
Table 83. Patients with a possibly clinically significant laboratory abnormality, according to 
treatment group / SAF-1 (chemotherapy/afatinib 40 mg) 
When considering trial 1200.23 (SAF-3) and taking into account the difference in study drug 
exposure between treatment groups, a higher proportion of patients in the afatinib 50 mg 
starting dose group experienced possibly clinically significant abnormalities in haemoglobin 
(14.5% of patients vs. 4.2% in the placebo group) and potassium (6.2% vs. 0.0%) (see Table 
84). 
Table 84. Patients with a possibly clinically significant laboratory abnormality, according to 
treatment group / SAF-3 (placebo/afatinib 50 mg) 
Afatinib  was  associated  with  small  to  moderate  changes  in  haematology  parameters  which 
remained,  however,  notably  below  the  changes  observed  with  chemotherapy  in  study  1200.32 
(SAF-1). The proportion of patients with a worst on-treatment haemoglobin value of grade 3 or 
above  observed  with  afatinib  (SAF-1:  2.7%,  SAF-3:  1.8%).  There  was  no  indication  of  an 
increased risk to experience bleeding events in patients receiving afatinib.

For lymphocytes, a worst grade of 3 or above was seen in slightly more patients receiving 
afatinib (SAF-1: 8.4%, SAF-3: 6.8%) than receiving placebo (4.7%); still, percentages were 
lower than those with chemotherapy (10.2%) (see Table 85). No relevant changes were 
observed with afatinib for platelets, white blood cells, or neutrophils.

Safety in special populations 
No  specific  studies  have  been  submitted.  Safety  in  special  populations  was  analysed  using 
standard  subgroups,  to  determine  the  influence  of  demographic  characteristics  (gender,  age, 
race,  body  weight),  disease  characteristics  (Eastern  Cooperative  Oncology  Group  [ECOG] 
performance score at baseline, renal function at baseline, hepatic function at baseline), and and 
extrinsic factors (geographic region, smoking status) on the afatinib safety profile. 
Higher incidences of adverse events were observed for elderly patients than for younger patients 
(≥65  years  vs.  <65  years);  this  was  seen  for  both  starting  doses.  Similar  observations  were 
made for Caucasians (compared with Asians); however, this might also be explained by the fact 
that  the  adverse  event  incidences  reported  by  Asian  patients  are  generally  lower  than  those 
reported by Caucasian patients.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety evaluation of afatinib is based on the data from more than 3,800 patients, including 
more than 1,638 NSCLC patients treated with 50 mg monotherapy and more than 497 NSCLC 
patients treated with 40 mg monotherapy. The safety data provided by the applicant are 
considered comprehensive. 
All subjects (100%) who received afatinib have presented any AEs and 60.7% were ≥ grade 
CTCAE 3. The most common AEs observed in afatinib group were diarrhoea (96.1%), rash/acne 
(90.0%), stomatitis (73.4%), and nail effects (61.6%). Ocular effects were seen in 22.7%, 
nauseas (25%), vomits (22%), epistaxis (17%), hepatic enzyme elevation (16.6%), cough 
(15%), headache (14%), back pain (14%), nasopharyngitis (14%), constipation (13%), pyrexia 
(12.2%), upper respiratory tract infection (10.9%) and dizziness (10.9%). 
In patients treated with once daily afatinib 40 mg, dose reductions due to ADRs occurred in 57% 
of the patients. Discontinuation due to ADRs diarrhoea and rash/acne was 1.3% and 0%, 
respectively. Overall, dose reduction led to a lower frequency of common adverse reactions. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/491185/2013 
Page 116/129 
 
 
 
  
  
In LUX Lung 1, in the complementary set of patients to those with tumours showing secondary 
resistance to reversible TKIs there were more AEs leading to death in the afatinib arm 19/133 vs. 
2/61. According to standard practice patients were followed for AEs on study therapy plus 28 
days and AEs related to tumour progression were reported as AEs, including AEs with fatal 
outcome. The event pattern is not unexpected and in most cases was likely related to tumour 
progression.  
The main identified risks include diarrhoea (including dehydration and renal impairment 
secondary to diarrhoea), rash/acne, ILD and keratitis. In addition, important potential risks 
include decreased LVEF/heart failure, hepatic failure and pancreatitis. Sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the 
SmPC contain adequate information addressing these risks: 
Diarrhoea 
Diarrhoea, including severe diarrhoea, has been reported during treatment with GIOTRIF. 
Diarrhoea may result in dehydration with or without renal impairment, which in rare cases has 
resulted in fatal outcomes. Diarrhoea usually occurred within the first 2 weeks of treatment. 
Grade 3 diarrhoea most frequently occurred within the first 6 weeks of treatment.  
Proactive management of diarrhoea including adequate hydration combined with anti-diarrhoeal 
medicinal products especially within the first 6 weeks of the treatment is important and should 
start at first signs of diarrhoea. Antidiarrhoeal medicinal products (e.g. loperamide) should be 
used and if necessary their dose should be escalated to the highest recommended approved 
dose. Anti-diarrhoeal medicinal products should be readily available to the patients so that 
treatment can be initiated at first signs of diarrhoea and continued until loose bowel movements 
cease for 12 hours. Patients with severe diarrhoea may require interruption and dose reduction 
or discontinuation of therapy with afatinib. Patients who become dehydrated may require 
administration of intravenous electrolytes and fluids.  
Skin related adverse events 
Rash/acne has been reported in patients treated with afatinib. In general, rash manifests as a 
mild or moderate erythematous and acneiform rash, which may occur or worsen in areas 
exposed to sun. For patients who are exposed to sun, protective clothing, and use of sun screen 
is advisable.  Early intervention (such as emollients, antibiotics) of dermatologic reactions can 
facilitate continuous GIOTRIF treatment. Patients with severe skin reactions may also require 
temporary interruption of therapy, dose reduction (see section 4.2), additional therapeutic 
intervention, and referral to a specialist with expertise in managing these dermatologic effects.  
Bullous, blistering and exfoliative skin conditions have been reported including rare cases 
suggestive of Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Treatment with this medicinal product should be 
interrupted or discontinued if the patient develops severe bullous, blistering or exfoliating 
conditions.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/491185/2013 
Page 117/129 
 
  
  
Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) 
There have been reports of ILD or ILD-like adverse reactions (such as lung infiltration, 
pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, allergic alveolitis), including fatalities, in 
patients receiving afatinib for treatment of NSCLC. ILD-like adverse reactions were reported in 
0.7%.  CTCAE Grade ≥ 3 ILD-like adverse reactions were reported in 0.5% of patients. A 
warning addressing this risk has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Keratitis 
Symptoms such as acute or worsening eye inflammation, lacrimation, light sensitivity, blurred 
vision, eye pain and/or red eye should be referred promptly to an ophthalmology specialist. If a 
diagnosis of ulcerative keratitis is confirmed, treatment should be interrupted or discontinued. If 
keratitis is diagnosed, the benefits and risks of continuing treatment should be carefully 
considered. This medicinal product should be used with caution in patients with a history of 
keratitis, ulcerative keratitis or severe dry eye. Contact lens use is also a risk factor for keratitis 
and ulceration. A warning addressing this risk has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Severe hepatic impairment 
Hepatic failure, including fatalities, has been reported during treatment with afatinib in less than 
1% of patients. In these patients, confounding factors have included pre-existing liver disease 
and/or comorbidities associated with progression of underlying malignancy. Periodic liver function 
testing is recommended in patients with pre-existing liver disease. In addition, liver function test 
abnormalities (including elevated ALT and AST) were observed in patients receiving afatinib 
40 mg. These elevations were mainly transient and did not lead to discontinuation. Grade 2 
(> 2.5 to 5.0 times upper limit of normal (ULN) ALT elevations occurred in < 8% of patients 
treated with this medicinal product. Grade 3 (> 5.0 to 20.0 times ULN) elevations occurred in 
<4% of patients treated with afatinib. This risk has been adequately highlighted in sections 4.4 
and 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Left ventricular function 
Left ventricular dysfunction has been associated with HER2 inhibition. Based on the available 
clinical trial data, there is no suggestion that afatinib causes an adverse reaction on cardiac 
contractility. However, this medicinal product has not been studied in patients with abnormal left 
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) or those with significant cardiac history. In patients with 
cardiac risk factors and those with conditions that can affect LVEF, cardiac monitoring, including 
an assessment of LVEF at baseline and during afatinib treatment, should be considered. In 
patients who develop relevant cardiac signs/symptoms during treatment, cardiac monitoring 
including LVEF assessment should be considered. In addition patients with an ejection fraction 
below the institution’s lower limit of normal, cardiac consultation as well as treatment 
interruption or discontinuation should be considered. A warning addressing this risk has been 
included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
The highest dose of afatinib studied in a limited number of patients in Phase I clinical trials was 
160 mg once daily for 3 days and 100 mg once daily for 2 weeks. The adverse reactions 
observed at these doses were primarily dermatological (rash/acne) and gastrointestinal events 
(especially diarrhoea). Overdose in 2 healthy adolescents involving the ingestion of 360 mg each 
of afatinib (as part of a mixed drug ingestion) was associated with adverse events of nausea, 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/491185/2013 
Page 118/129 
 
  
  
vomiting, asthenia, dizziness, headache, abdominal pain and elevated amylase (< 1.5 times 
ULN). Both individuals recovered from these adverse events. 
Despite a large safety data base, adverse reactions related to the pan-HER character of afatinib 
and the covalent binding properties have not been identified. Formation of covalent protein 
adducts might result in hypersensitivity reactions. There were, however, no non-clinical data 
indicative of this. The putative consequences of adducts constituting a “deep compartment” from 
a PK perspective will be further addressed post-marketing in patients who have been treated 
long-term with afatinib and where PK data are sampled after stopping afatinib therapy. 
The types of adverse reactions (ADRs) were generally associated with the EGFR inhibitory mode 
of action of afatinib. In addition, based on indirect comparisons, the toxicity profile of afatinib 
appears very similar to what has been reported for other available EGFR-TKIs (see cross-trial 
comparison of safety and tolerability of afatinib, erlotinib and gefitinib in Tables 89-91).

Altogether there might be quantitative differences in the safety profiles comparing afatinib with 
gefitinib and erlotinib, but these differences are not of a magnitude constituting a blocking issue 
from a regulatory perspective. 
The CHMP was of the opinion that due to the limited number of patients in study Lux-Lung 2, 
further characterisation of the safety and efficacy of afatinib 40 mg qd in patients pre-treated 
with chemotherapy was needed. This concern has been addressed in the RMP, where it has 
been included as missing information. The applicant will perform a post-authorisation safety 
study (PASS) to collect additional safety and efficacy data in this subgroup of patients, as 
reflected in the PhV plan of the RMP as a category 3 (required) study. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included 
in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of afatinib in treatment of EGFR TKI-naïve adult patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic NSCLC with activating EGFR mutation(s) has been adequately 
characterised based on a comprehensive safety database in overall 3868 patients, including 
497 NSCLC patients treated with 40 mg monotherapy. The most frequent ADRs were diarrhoea 
and skin related adverse events as well as stomatitis and paronychia. The main identified risks 
include diarrhoea (including dehydration and renal impairment secondary to diarrhoea), 
rash/acne, ILD and keratitis. 
Patients resistant to EGFR-TKIs in the complementary set experienced an increased number of 
on-treatment deaths compared to placebo. 
Based on indirect comparisons, the toxicity profile of afatinib appears similar to what has been 
reported for other available EGFR-TKIs.

2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils 
the legislative requirements.  
2.8.  Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
PRAC Advice 
Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 1.2, the PRAC considers by 
consensus that the risk management system for afatinib (Giotrif) in the treatment: 
• 
of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) TKI-naïve adult patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating EGFR 
mutation(s). 
is agreeable. 
The PRAC however noted that some updates to the RMP might be warranted following further 
discussions at the CHMP with regards to the final indication of Giotrif and the possible need for a 
PK study in the post-authorisation phase.  
This advice is based on the following content of the Risk Management Plan:

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed risk 
minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed 
indication. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes.  In addition, the CHMP considered that due to 
the limited number of patients treated with afatinib after having received prior chemotherapy 
treatment, the Applicant should conduct a post-authorisation safety study to further 
characterise of the safety and efficacy of afatinib in this sub-population of patients.  
Finally the CHMP also requested a post-authorisation PK study to further characterise the 
potential developmental toxicity of afatinib. 
Following  these  recommendations  the  Applicant  submitted  an  updated  RMP  to  address  these 
issues.  
In the latest RMP, the following safety concerns have been included:

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
First line: The pivotal study for this application (LUX Lung 3) was a conventionally designed, well 
conducted, afatinib versus chemotherapy (pemetrexed/cisplatin) comparative study in the 
treatment of naïve NSCLC patients with activating EGFR-TK mutations. The results in terms of 
progression free survival (HR 0.58, CI 95% 0.425, 0.784, p=0.0004) were statistically significant 
in favour of afatinib and of clinically benefit for NSCLC patient with activating EGFR-TK 
mutations.  
As supportive evidence of efficacy, the results of the afatinib versus cisplatin/gemcitabine 
comparative study LUX Lung 6 also showed superiority in terms of PFS (HR 0.28, CI 95% 0.201, 
0.388, p<0.0001) in the treatment of naïve NSCLC patients with activating EGFR-TK mutations. 
In addition improved symptom control has been shown. 
Evidence provided robustly demonstrates patient benefit. These results are in-line with available 
data for other approved EGFR-TKIs erlotinib and gefitinib. 
Chemotherapy pre-treated patients: 
Supportive evidence based on the Phase II study LUX-Lung 2 has shown that that the activity of 
afatinib in patients with EGFR mutations is not limited by line of therapy; both first- and second-
line patients evidenced response rates. First-line patients treated with an afatinib starting dose of 
either 40 mg or 50 mg had a 66% confirmed ORR and a 12- month median PFS, and a median 
OS has not yet been reached; second-line patients treated with 50 mg of afatinib had a 57% 
confirmed ORR, a 8.3-month median PFS, and a 24-month median OS. 
In addition there are no mechanistic arguments that would justify a detrimental effect of 
chemotherapy on the efficacy of TKIs in 2nd line. Moreover, prognostic factors are not expected 
to change significantly due to previous treatment with chemotherapy. 
Patients with secondary resistance to erlotinib/gefitinib: The supportive Phase III study LUX-Lung 
1 comparing afatinib versus placebo in NSCLC patients failing erlotinib/gefitinib did not meet its 
primary endpoint of Overall Survival (OS) (HR=1.08, CI 95% 0.862-1.346, p=0.7428). Although 
activity in progression free survival (PFS) was observed as a secondary endpoint (HR=0.38, CI 
95% 0.31, 0.48), p<0.0001), it did not translate into a survival benefit to the patients. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/491185/2013 
Page 125/129 
 
  
  
Post-hoc analysis performed by the company further enriched the population of EGFR mutation 
patients to 83% (originally estimated 68%). OS in the enriched population improved (HR=0.91, 
CI 95% 0.73, 1.14). In this subgroup clinically enriched for activating mutations prior to 
erlotinib/gefitinib therapy, the secondary endpoint showed a benefit in terms of PFS (HR=0.279, 
CI 95 % 0.21-0.36), with a median PFS increase of 3.4 months. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Patients with secondary resistance to erlotinib/gefitinib: Whilst the criteria selecting for 
secondary resistance are well justified, the results are based on a post-hoc analysis, not 
protected by stratification, where there are too many uncertainties to demonstrate a benefit in 
this patient population.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
All subjects (100%) who received afatinib in study LUX Lung 3 have presented any AEs and 
60.7% were ≥ grade CTCAE 3. The most common AEs observed in afatinib group were 
diarrhoea (96.1%), rash/acne (90.0%), stomatitis (73.4%), and nail effects (61.6%). Ocular 
effects were seen in 22.7%, nauseas (25%), vomits (22%), epistaxis (17%), hepatic enzyme 
elevation (16.6%), cough (15%), headache (14%), back pain (14%), nasopharyngitis (14%), 
constipation (13%), pyrexia (12.2%), upper respiratory tract infection (10.9%) and dizziness 
(10.9%). 
Digestive symptoms (diarrhoea, nauseas and vomits), skin toxicity (rash/acne) and respiratory 
disorders were the adverse reactions more commonly resulting in treatment discontinuation. 
Adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation were reported in 14% (LUX Lung 3) and 
10% in LUX Lung 6. 27% patients required hospitalization due to SAEs. AEs leading to death 
(grade 5 CTCAE) were observed more frequently in afatinib groups than in chemotherapy 
groups (5.7% vs. 2.7% respectively). According to standard practice patients were followed for 
AEs on study therapy plus 28 days and AEs related to tumour progression were reported as 
AEs, including AEs with fatal outcome. The event pattern is not unexpected and in most cases 
was likely related to tumour progression. 
In study LUX Lung 1, patients with tumours showing secondary resistance to reversible TKIs in 
the complementary set experienced significantly more AEs leading to death in the afatinib arm 
(14.2 % vs. 3.3). Therefore this imbalance constitutes a serious concern in this patient 
population. 
In addition, it was worrisome that the complementary set had a negative trend in survival 
(HR=1.23, CI 95% 0.89, 1.70) and that further subgroup analyses have shown that patients in 
the complementary for whom the EGFR TKI-free interval was less than 4 weeks (not affected by 
subsequent therapies), had an even poorer survival outcome (HR=1.69, CI 0.97, 2.93). This 
might indicate that putative negative effects are more pronounced in patients with a more 
aggressive disease. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Despite a large safety data base, adverse reactions related to the pan-HER character of afatinib 
and the covalent binding properties have not been identified.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/491185/2013 
Page 126/129 
 
  
  
Formation of covalent protein adducts might result in hypersensitivity reactions. There were, 
however, no non-clinical data indicative of this. The putative consequences of adducts 
constituting a “deep compartment” from a PK perspective will be further addressed post-
marketing in patients who have been treated long-term with afatinib and where PK data are 
sampled after stopping afatinib therapy. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The magnitude of the benefit in terms of PFS demonstrated for afatinib over chemotherapy in 
treatment naïve patients is statistically significant and clinically meaningful. In addition benefit 
was also shown in terms of symptom control. These data are considered robust. 
Although a PFS benefit in patients with retrospectively defined secondary resistance to prior 
treatment with erlotinib/gefitinib has been shown, there are too many uncertainties related to 
the post-hoc nature of the analyses, the outcome in the complementary set pointing in the 
direction of imbalances in prognostic factors and also too sparse evidence as regards activity in 
relation to mutation T790M.  
The main toxicity associated with afatinib included diarrhoea (including dehydration and renal 
impairment secondary to diarrhoea), rash/acne, ILD and keratitis. In addition, important 
potential risks include decreased LVEF/heart failure, hepatic failure and pancreatitis. Based on 
indirect comparisons, the toxicity was similar to other TKI inhibitors in similar settings. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The magnitude of the PFS benefit over chemotherapy demonstrated in the first-line setting is 
considered to be sufficiently large to outweigh the risks. Therefore the benefit-risk balance is 
positive in this patient population, both for treatment naïve and chemotherapy pre-treated 
patients. 
In patients with secondary resistance to gefitinib/erlotinib, the efficacy has not been established 
and it is not possible to conclude that the benefit/risk balance is positive. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The benefits with afatinib in the treatment of EGFR TKI-naïve adult patients with locally advanced 
or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with activating EGFR mutation have been shown in 
terms of an increased progression free survival in patients receiving afatinib compared to 
chemotherapy. The results are considered of clinical benefit and in-line with what has been 
shown before for EGFR-TKIs erlotinib and gefitinib. As for other EGFR-TKIs no survival was 
shown, interpreted as being due to high cross-over rates to EGFR-TKI treatment. In this regards 
OS data has not shown any negative trends on survival and it is considered reassuring. 
The relative efficacy of afatinib, gefitinib and erlotinib is currently not known, as data with direct 
head to head comparison are not available. Further information on the efficacy of afatinib versus 
gefitinib will be available from a currently ongoing comparative head-to-head study. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/491185/2013 
Page 127/129 
 
 
  
  
In terms of safety the most common side effects are diarrhoea, stomatitis, rash, dermatitis 
acneiform, pruritus, dry skin, paronychia, decreased appetite and epistaxis. Based on indirect 
comparisons, the toxicity was similar to other TKI inhibitors in similar settings. 
Supportive evidence has shown that that the activity of afatinib in patients with EGFR mutations 
is not limited by line of therapy; both treatment naïve and chemotherapy pre-treated evidenced 
response rates. In addition there are no mechanistic arguments that would justify a detrimental 
effect of chemotherapy on the efficacy of TKIs. Moreover, prognostic factors are not expected to 
change significantly due to previous treatment with chemotherapy. 
Nevertheless the CHMP considered that further data is needed to better understand the efficacy 
and safety profile of afatinib in chemotherapy pre-treated patients. Therefore the applicant will 
conduct a post-authorisation safety study to further characterise of the safety and efficacy of 
afatinib in this sub-population of patients. 
The CHMP also requested a post-authorisation PK study to further characterise the potential 
developmental toxicity of afatinib. Mechanistically, all EGFR targeting medicinal products have 
the potential to cause foetal harm, however animal studies with afatinib did not indicate direct or 
indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity.  
On the other hand, treatment of afatinib in patients with secondary resistance to 
erlotinib/gefitinib did not translate into a survival benefit. The results in terms of an increased 
progression free survival are based on a post-hoc analysis, not protected by stratification, where 
there are too many uncertainties to demonstrate a benefit in this patient population. Therefore 
the final indication agreed by the CHMP does not include this patient population as initially 
proposed by the applicant. The final indication is shown below (deletions in strikethrough, 
additions underlined): 
“GIOTRIF as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 
(EGFR) TKI-naïve adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) with activating Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation(s) (see section 5.1). 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by 
consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Giotrif in the treatment of Epidermal Growth Factor 
Receptor (EGFR) TKI-naïve adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating EGFR mutation(s) is favourable and therefore recommends

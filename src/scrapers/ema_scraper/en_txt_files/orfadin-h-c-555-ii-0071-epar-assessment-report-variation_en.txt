2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
AKU is a serious, autosomal recessive, multisystem disorder affecting approximately one in every 250 
000 to 1 million people. Of 626 patients identified worldwide, there are 358 patients in Europe, 208 of 
whom are found in Slovakia. Morbidity in alkaptonuria (AKU) is caused by increased levels of the tyrosine 
metabolite homogentisic acid (HGA) due to a deficient enzyme, homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (HGD), 
that is the third enzyme involved in tyrosine catabolism.  
The absence of HGD results in patients being unable to fully metabolize the amino acid tyrosine, leading 
to high serum levels of HGA. Despite efficient and marked urinary excretion of much of the HGA, some 
of it is oxidized to a melanin-like pigment (via BQA). This pigment is deposited in connective tissues, 
particularly  cartilage,  a  process  termed  ochronosis,  with  darkening  of  cartilaginous  tissues  and  bone, 
arthritis and joint destruction, and deterioration of cardiac valves. There are few clinical features, aside 
from dark urine, until the late 20s or early 30s when progressive arthritic pain, affecting the spine and 
synovial joints, large and small, as well as pigmentation of eyes (sclera) and ear cartilage, begins. Fifty 
percent (50%) of patients require at least one joint replacement by age 55 years [Phornphutkul et al 
2002]. 
Currently, there is no pharmacological treatment approved available for patients with AKU and treatment 
options are limited to treatment of the disease sequelae as they arise, including physiotherapy, surgery 
and analgesia.  
AKU is a very rare disease without any approved drug. While it is true that life expectancy does not seem 
to be reduced, the disease is characterized by multiple manifestations, particularly related to joints, with 
development  of  joint  pain,  movement  limitations,  and  half  patients  in  need  of  at  least  one  joint 
replacement by 55 years. Therefore, effective therapy for AKU is considered by the CHMP as an unmet 
medical need. 
The  sought  indication  is:  “Orfadin  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  alkaptonuria 
(AKU)”. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Nitisinone  is  a  competitive  inhibitor  of  the  enzyme,  4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate  dioxygenase  (HPPD), 
which  metabolizes  4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate  (HPP)  to  HGA.  It  has  been  shown  to  reduce  urinary 
excretion and serum levels of HGA in a dose- and concentration-dependent manner in patients with AKU. 
It is hypothesized that if HGA levels are reduced to, and maintained at, normal, or near normal levels in 
AKU patients before the onset of overt ochronosis (i.e., blue-black pigmentation), this might prevent the 
development of the debilitating clinical features of the disease.  
 
 
Likewise, it is hypothesized that treatment with nitisinone in patients who have already developed some 
degree  of  ochronosis,  would  slow  down  further  progression  of  ochronosis  and  thereby  reduce  the 
incidence of disease related consequences.  
Nitisinone  (Orfadin)  is  currently  approved  for  the  treatment  of  hereditary  tyrosinemia  type  1  (HT-1), 
where  it  acts  by  the  same  mechanism,  i.e.,  by  inhibition  of  HPPD  which  prevents  formation  of  toxic 
metabolites further down in the tyrosine metabolic pathway. Due to the inhibition of HPPD, treatment 
with nitisinone leads to increased serum concentrations of tyrosine. High levels of tyrosine may lead to 
ocular signs and symptoms and adverse effects on the skin. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The main issues discussed during the SA procedure were: 
i. 
The  acceptability  of  a  clinical  development  program  based  mainly  on  a 
pharmacodynamic variable: the normalization of plasma/urinary levels of HGA. The 
CHMP advised that, although only HGA is the cause of the ochronosis process that in turn 
results  in  the  co-morbidities  effects  of  alkaptonuria,  there  is  no  historical  clinical  data  to 
support  the  assumption  that  the  control  of  HGA  levels  in  patients  with  AKU  will  arrest 
ochronosis. Therefore, while a primary endpoint based on a pharmacodynamic variable may 
be accepted, to support the claimed indication, data on treatment effect on clinical outcomes, 
and on safety will need to be provided at the time of MAA. It is expected that at the time of 
submission,  the  Applicant  will  be  able  to  build  a  persuasive  direct  link  from  HGA  levels 
through ochronosis to clinical outcome. The characterization of the natural course of disease, 
as well as a detailed justification on the normal HGA levels will be key basis for an approval 
in AKU patients based on the HGA surrogate biomarker instead of the expected robust clinical 
data in standard conditions 
ii. 
The initially proposed cut-off point of 3.0 µM (0.5 µg/ml) for plasma-HGA. The CHMP 
recommended  to  use  physiological  levels  of  HGA  as  an  endpoint,  and  to  switch  to 
measurements in urine, since plasma levels are much below the lower limit of quantitation 
in standard bioanalytical methods and, also, urine data are less variable. Two papers with 
data on normal levels of u-HGA are currently available: 20 - 30 mg/day (Introne et al, 2011) 
and < 100 mg/day (Suwannarat et al. 2005). The published literature being inconsistent, 
there is the need to investigate normal u-HGA levels. This is as important information in the 
authorisation process. 
iii. 
The acceptability of the All Alkaptonuria Severity Score Index (AKUSSI) to measure 
treatment effect on AKU disease. This scale measures AKU disease severity in clinical, 
joint and spine domains. Although validated, this scoring system bears some limitations in 
its  use  in  clinical  trials,  and  the  CHMP  recommended  to  implement  further  measures  to 
confirm treatment benefit on clinical outcomes. During the Discussion Meeting the Applicant 
presented  a  more  comprehensive  plan  to  assess  clinical  effect  after  12  and  48months  of 
treatment including the following variables: modified cAKUSSI scores (i.e. without measures 
of pigmentation: mAKUSSI), pain (VAS), total cAKUSSI, all individual cAKUSSI items, quality 
of  life  (SF36),health  assessment  (HAQ),  pain,  stiffness,  and  physical  function  (WOMAC 
index), range of hip motion, and aortic valve gradients. The updated plan was considered 
overall acceptable by the CHMP. In particular, the use of mAKUSSI over AKUSSI was advised.  
Overall, the development program of the product was in compliance with the CHMP Scientific 
Advice. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
As claimed by the applicant all the studies were conducted in accordance to GCP. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Published nonclinical pharmacodynamic data that demonstrate that nitisinone has compelling therapeutic 
effects on the development of ochronosis in animal models of AKU. These are summarized below. 
2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
AKU  is  an  inborn  error  of  metabolism,  caused  by  a  deficiency  of  HGD,  an  enzyme  involved  in  the 
breakdown of HGA, and an intermediate of the metabolism of tyrosine and phenylalanine (see Figure 1). 
It  arises  in  humans  from  homozygous  or  compound  heterozygous  mutations  in  the  HGD  gene 
(Fernandez-Canon  et  al.,  1996).  At  least  129  different  human  mutations  have  been  identified 
(Nemethova et al., 2016). The loss of enzymatic activity leads to an increase and accumulation of the 
systemic  content  of  HGA,  and  the  renal  excretion  of  HGA  increases  dramatically.  The  treatment  with 
nitisinone is suggested to abolish this systemic increase in HGA, and thereby to prevent the development 
of the debilitating ochronosis of joints, bone and other tissues (La Du et al., 1958).

Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
In vitro data 
The role of HGA in causing ochronosis has been demonstrated in a series of in vitro studies. Cell culture 
models,  both  of  chondrocytes  isolated  from  the  joints  of  patients  with  AKU  and  of  osteosarcoma  cell 
lines,  show  that  elevated  HGA  concentrations  are  the  prime  driver  of  ochronosis  (Tinti  et  al.,  2011; 
Braconi et al., 2012;). Osteosarcoma cell cultures in the presence of HGA accumulate ochronotic pigment 
in a dose-dependent fashion, whilst the pigment is absent in cells cultured in the absence of HGA (Tinti 
et al., 2011). Cell cultures of primary chondrocytes isolated from both fetal and adult rabbit cartilage 
demonstrate that incubation with HGA causes dose-dependent cytotoxicity with concomitant compromise 
of the cultures’ ability to synthesize proteoglycans (Kirkpatrick et al., 1994). 
Nitisinone has been demonstrated, both in vitro and in vivo, to be a potent inhibitor of hepatic HPPD in 
rodents, thus preventing the formation of downstream metabolites, including HGA (Ellis et al., 1995).  
Treatment with nitisinone is therefore likely to prevent ochronosis and subsequent clinical symptoms of 
AKU. 
In vivo data  
An  AKU  mouse  model  was  developed  in  1994  (Montagutelli  et  al.,  1994).  It  was  created  by 
ethylnitrosourea-induced  mutagenesis.  Homozygous  (HGD-/-)  mice  were  demonstrated  to  have  high 
levels of HGA in the urine and almost no HGD activity in the liver, but no clinical signs of ochronosis were 
present. 
Therapeutic  effects  of  nitisinone  were  demonstrated  for  the  first  time  using  this  AKU  mouse  model 
(Suzuki et al., 1999). The urinary output of HGA was reduced to less than 2 % of the pre-treatment level 
12 to 24 hours after a single oral dose by stomach tube of 100 μg nitisinone, i.e., approximately 5 mg/kg 
bodyweight. After repeated daily dosing of 25 μg nitisinone orally for 4 weeks, i.e., approximately 1.25 
mg/kg  bodyweight,  the  reduction  in  urinary  levels  of  HGA  was  preserved  throughout  the  treatment 
period. A 3-fold increase in the plasma levels of tyrosine was recorded in the nitisinone-treated normal 
animals when compared to the pre-treatment levels, and by 4 to 5 times in nitisinone-treated AKU mice. 
X-ray  examination  of  3  AKU  mice  at  age  13  months  showed  no  calcification  of  the  cartilage  and  no 
osteoarthritic changes in the knee and spine. 
Despite initial difficulties in demonstrating ochronosis in the above mouse model (HGD-/-), a later study 
verified that these mice did indeed develop ochronosis (Preston et al., 2014). Samples were taken for 
p-HGA measurements at 2- or 4-weekly intervals between ages 5 and 79 weeks. Wild type p-HGA levels 
were below the limit of detection for the analytical method. The mean p-HGA concentration in AKU mice 
was elevated; the mean (SE) lifetime level was 0.148 (0.019) mmol/L (range, 0.768 to 0.023 mmol/L), 
with no obvious changes with age. 
The authors were able to histologically show the presence of ochronosis in tissue specimens taken from 
the AKU mice by using a modified Schmorl’s stain. Extensive chondrocytic pigmentation of the femoral 
and tibial calcified cartilage was observed. 
A cohort of the AKU mice were exposed to nitisinone via the drinking water ad libitum from 8 to 67 weeks 
of age. No plasma samples for drug level measurements were taken to confirm exposure to nitisinone. 
The treated mice showed a significant reduction in plasma HGA between 8 and 14 weeks of age when 
compared  with  untreated  controls  (p  <  0.001).  By  using  the  modified  Schmorl’s  stain,  the  joint 
ochronosis  could  be  quantified  and  the  treatment  with  nitisinone  was  demonstrated  to  completely 
prevent the chondron pigmentation. 
Another study (Keenan et al., 2015) showed that administration of nitisinone to the AKU mice arrests 
further deposition of ochronotic pigment in the tibiofemoral joint but did not result in the clearance of 
existing pigment. 
The original AKU mouse model (Montagutelli et al., 1994) was  further improved by  knocking out two 
genes in the mouse; the gene of tyrosinemia type 1 (HT-1) and the HGD gene (Manning et al., 1999). 
The resultant HGD+/-/FAH-/- animal could be maintained in a healthy state if treated with nitisinone. 
Withdrawal of nitisinone was most often lethal, but in some cases the animal survived due to production 
of homozygosity of the HGD mutation in a process called reversion. The animals developed ochronosis 
of  the  kidney,  the  distal  femur  and  proximal  fibula,  as  evidenced  by  the  presence  of  chondrocytes-
bearing ochronotic pigment (Taylor et al., 2012).  
2.2.3.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The Environmental Risk Assessment of nitisinone, conducted, as stated by the MAH in accordance with 
Guideline  on 
the  environmental 
risk  assessment  of  medicinal  products  of  human  use 
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 Rev. 1, resulted in PECsw < 0.01 μg/L when using a refined FPEN based on 
the highest regional prevalence for the indications HT-1 and AKU. In addition, the PBT screening shows 
a log Kow below the limit of 4.5. Results led to the MAH conclusion, that the medicinal product is unlikely 
to represent a risk for the environment following its prescribed usage in patients. However, the logKow 
determination was not considered acceptable by the CHMP since the submitted study was not in line with 
the requirements of OECD 107.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Nitisinone pharmacological effect is supported by bibliographical non clinical data. AKU disease mouse 
model (HGD-/-) were demonstrated to develop ochronosis. Treatment with nitisinone lowered the HGA 
levels  in  blood  and  urine,  decreasing  therefore  the  rate  of  formation  of  ochronotic  pigment  in  the 
tibiofemoral  joint.  Similar  results  were  obtained  with  the  HGD+/-/FAH-/-  animal  model,  in  which 
nitisinone administration was able to revert the incipient ochronosis associated with single chondrocytes 
and  the  immediate  pericellular  matrix,  which  mirrors  authentically  the  early  stages  of  the  process  in 
humans and mirrors closely that seen in the HGD -/- animals described above. Overall, data adequately 
showed that this mouse model may accurately depict the HGA-induced ochronosis seen in the human 
pathology of AKU and further show the preventive effects of nitisinone on the ochronotic process. The 
ERA is not complete and the CHMP recommended the MAH to provide further data to substantiate that 
the  present  extension  of  indication  for  the  medicinal  product  is  unlikely  to  represent  a  risk  for  the 
environment. 
2.2.5.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The ERA data available at the initial marketing authorisation was updated in this application. However, 
it is not complete to conclude on whether a significant increase in environmental exposure is expected 
further to the extended use of nitisinone.  
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points are recommended for further investigation: 
In order to complete the Phase I ERA, an experimentally determined log Kow of the active substance 
Nitisinone should be provided in accordance with the Q&A document by the European Medicines 
 
Agency (EMA) Questions and answers on 'Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal 
products for human use' (EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010). 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
The pharmacokinetic profile and pharmacological activity of Orfadin has been well characterised in 
humans. New pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data in the AKU population have been collected 
through the dose-response and main pivotal studies, SONIA-1 and SONIA-2, which is considered 
acceptable by the CHMP.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
The dose response study, SONIA-1, investigating the effect of different doses of once daily nitisinone 
on 24-hour urinary homogentisic acid excretion (u-HGA24) in patients with alkaptonuria after 4 weeks 
of treatment. The intention of the study was to identify the nitisinone dose that lowers urinary excretion 
of HGA to normal, or near normal, levels. A separate study in non-AKU subjects was performed in parallel 
in order to define normal levels of both urinary excretion and serum levels of HGA. 
Patients  were  randomized  to  receive  either  1  mg,  2  mg,  4  mg  or  8  mg  nitisinone  once  daily  or  no 
treatment (control). 40 patients were planned to be randomized, equally distributed, to the groups (8 
patients/group). The overall design of the dose-response study is presented in the Figure 2. 
Figure 2. Overall design of SONIA-1 study 
The  primary  endpoint  was  u-HGA24  after  4  weeks  of  treatment  with  nitisinone.  Secondary  endpoints 
included  24-hour  serum  concentration  of  HGA  (s-HGA)  and  serum  concentration  of  Tyrosine  (s-Tyr) 
profiles at Week 4 and nitisinone steady state pharmacokinetic variables.  
 
 
 
  
 
 
Results for u-HGA24 are shown below in Table 1, Figures 3 and 4  
Table 1. u-HGA24. MMRM (FAS) 
FAS: Full analysis set, MMRM: Mixed effect model repeat measurement 
HGA excretion decreased in a clear dose-dependent manner, and at Week 4 the least square (LS) mean 
values were reduced by approximately 90, 95, 98 and 99% compared to the values at baseline in patients 
receiving  nitisinone  1,  2,  4  or  8  mg,  respectively.  No  change  in  u-HGA24  was  seen  in  the  untreated 
control group. 
 
 
Figure 3. u-HGA24 over time (FAS) 
Urinary HGA was only quantifiable in 7 of the 22 individuals in the separate study in non-AKU subjects. 
The highest 24-hour excretion observed in any of those 7 subjects was 2.91 μmol. Thus, no patient in 
the present study achieved a u-HGA24 level as low as the highest observed value in any normal 
subject. The LS mean excretion at Week 4 in the 8-mg group (=327 μmol) is about 100 times higher 
than that value, despite the 99% reduction of u-HGA24 from baseline in that dose group. 
The relationship between u-HGA24 and average concentration of serum nitisinone is shown in the 
figure 4. A clear concentration-response relationship can be seen for u-HGA up to an average 
nitisinone concentration of about 3 μmol/L. For Cav values above 3 μmol/L there was apparently no 
further decrease in u-HGA. 
 
 
 
Figure 4. Urine HGA in relation to average concentration (Cav) of serum nitisinone 
Results for serum HGA and Tyrosine profiles at Week 4 are presented in Tables 2 and 3.  The 
relationship between s-HGA and average concentration for nitisinone could not be determined due to 
several s-HGA values below the LLOQ. The relationship between Cav for s-Tyr and Cav for nitisinone at 
Week 4 is shown below in Figure 5.  
Table 2. Average and maximum serum concentrations of HGA at Week 4 (FAS) 
Several descriptive statistics, such as mean and standard deviation, could not be calculated for the 2-, 
4- and 8-mg dose groups due to a total of 14 individuals with values below the Lower Limit of 
Quantification (LLOQ). Despite this, an indication of a dose-response relationship is seen for the Cmax 
values. A dose-response relationship is also reflected by the increasing number of patients with values 
below the LLOQ with increasing doses. There were 3 patients on 2 mg, 4 patients on 4 mg and 7 
patients on 8 mg without a single quantifiable concentration in the samples collected over the 24-hour 
 
 
 
 
dosage interval at Week 4. Serum levels of HGA were non-quantifiable in all non-AKU subjects. It was 
not possible to determine if any of the nitisinone-treated AKU patients reached normal levels of s-HGA. 
Table 3. Average and maximum serum concentrations of tyrosine at Week 4 (FAS) 
s-Tyr levels increased with nitisinone dose, but the dose-response relationship appear less pronounced 
than for uHGA24 vs dose. At all doses, nitisinone increased s-Tyr levels above 500 µmol/L, which is the 
recommended threshold specified in the SmPC of Orfadin in the HT-1 indication. 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 5. Cav for s- Tyrosine vs Cav for nitisinone at Week 4 (FAS) 
Figure 6. s- Tyrosine Cmax vs Cav for nitisinone Cav at Week 4 (FAS) 
 All doses, including the 1-mg dose, resulted in daily average levels above 500 µmol/L in all individuals. 
From a nitisinone Cav of about 5 μmol/L and upward, all average s-Tyr were at least 800 μmol/L 
(Figure 6). 
2.4.2.  Main study 
The main study, SONIA 2, is an international, multicenter, randomized, evaluator-blinded, no-
treatment controlled, parallel-group study to assess the efficacy and safety of once daily nitisinone in 
patients with alkaptonuria after 12 months of treatment, followed by an additional 36-month treatment 
period. 
Methods 
Study participants 
Study centers were as follows: Royal Liverpool University Hospital, Liverpool, UK. National Institute of 
Rheumatic Diseases, Piešťany, Slovakia Hôpital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris.Cedex, France. 
Main inclusion criteria were as follows: confirmed diagnosis of AKU based on elevated uHGA level; any 
clinical manifestations of AKU, such as clinical ochronosis or chronic back / joint pain and age ≥ 25 
years. Exclusion criteria included: treatment with nitisinone within 3 months of randomization, or 
participation in another clinical study within 3 months of randomization; female patient of child-bearing 
potential not using a reliable method of contraception, or currently pregnant or lactating; current 
malignancy; unstable cardiovascular disease; serum potassium < 3.0 mmol/L, or eGFR < 60 mL/min, 
 
 
or ALT > 3 x ULN, or Hemoglobin < 10.0 g/dL, or Platelets < 100 x 109/L, or Total white blood count < 
3.0 x 109/L or neutrophil count < 1.5 x 109/L. 
A patient was to be withdrawn from treatment if the patient developed ocular signs or symptoms, or a 
skin rash (hyperkeratotic lesions). These AEs were judged by the investigator to be related to elevated 
tyrosine. Patients withdrawn due to an AE could not re-enter the study. Patients temporarily withdrawn 
from treatment due to suspected tyrosine toxicity could, however, continue in the study on a lower 
dose of nitisinone (2 mg) at the discretion of the investigator once all signs and symptoms of tyrosine 
toxicity had resolved. Patients with temporarily withdrawn treatment due to a suspected, but not later 
confirmed, tyrosine toxicity, could continue in the study on the 10-mg dose. In both cases, dates for 
temporary withdrawal of nitisinone, the date when treatment was re-initiated, and the dose used after 
the pause, were recorded in the CRF. Withdrawn patients were not replaced. 
Female patients were to use a reliable method of contraception during the study and for one month 
after the study. All patients were advised to limit their protein intake in order to keep tyrosine levels as 
low as possible without introducing specific diets. The importance of controlling protein and 
phenylalanine intake was emphasized and a list of foods particularly high in tyrosine and phenylalanine 
was provided. Patients were allowed to continue on any chronic medication but were not to make any 
changes in the dosage from one month before entering the study and until after the follow-up visit, 
unless necessary for medical reasons. 
Treatments 
The dose of nitisinone used in this study was 10 mg/day and was determined after evaluation of the 
SONIA 1 study results.  
In case a patient developed tyrosine-related adverse events, nitisinone dose could be decreased to 2 
mg/day. 
Nitisinone was taken once daily, in the morning. 
Objective 
The primary objective was to demonstrate that nitisinone is superior compared to no treatment in 
reducing u-HGA24 in patients with AKU after 12 months. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was u-HGA24 after 12 months. 
Secondary endpoints included: u-HGA24 after 3, 24, 36 and 48 months; occurrence of achieved target 
level (<300 μmol) of u-HGA24 at 3, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months; predose s-HGA at 3, 12, 24, 36 and 48 
months; change from baseline in cAKUSSI, mAKUSSI, scores at 12, 24, 36 and 48 months; change 
from baseline of joint and spine motion, other pre-defined rheumatology assessments at 12, 24, 36 
and 48 months; change from baseline in QOL measured by SF-36 at 12, 24, 36 and 48 months; pre-
dose serum nitisinone at 3, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months. 
The composite efficacy variable AKUSSI incorporates multiple, clinical AKU outcomes that can be 
described in a single score, ie eye and ear pigmentation, kidney and prostate stones, aortic stenosis, 
bone fractures, tendon/ligament/muscle ruptures, kyphosis, scoliosis, and joint replacements and 
other manifestations of AKU.  
Two types of AKUSSI score were used as secondary outcomes in SONIA 2; the cAKUSSI and a 
modified version, mAKUSSI, which does not include the pigmentation parameters. The mAKUSSI was 
agreed with the CHMP during the Scientific Advice. The AKUSSI scoring system is shown in the Table 4 
below. For each item, the actual results of measurements were reported in the CRF and used in the 
statistical analysis for the individual item and in the calculation of the AKUSSI score. All items included 
in the AKUSSI were assessed at baseline and yearly thereafter. 
Table 4. Clinical AKU Severity Score Index (cAKUSSI) 
 
 
Sample size 
Based on the CHMP advice to use u-HGA24 as the primary efficacy variable but also to show treatment 
effect on some clinical outcome variables. The sample size calculation was based on the probability to 
show treatment effect on the AKUSSI score, since very few patients are needed to show treatment 
effect on HGA levels. Based on data from the previous cross-sectional study of AKU using AKUSSI, and 
follow-up data, it was calculated that if the measure of efficacy is that nitisinone reduces the mean 
increase in AKUSSI over the 4-year period to 4 points, compared to the 8 points expected for the 
control group, and taking the standard deviation of the increase to be 8, then a sample size of 64 per 
group is required for a two-sided t-test with power 80 % for significance level 0.05. With a 10% drop-
out rate, a sample size of 70 per group is required (140 patients in all). 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomly assigned to one of the two groups in a 1:1 ratio. The randomization was 
stratified by study center and age (≤ 55 years and > 55 years), since there is evidence that the rate of 
disease progression increases after an age of approximately 55 years. The study statistician created a 
program to randomly assign the patients to the two treatment groups using the SAS System. The 
randomization was carried out by using randomly permuted blocks (4 patients/block) within each study 
center and age stratum. The randomization was centrally implemented in the electronic CRF system. 
Blinding (masking) 
During the scientific advice, the CHMP recommended to make the study evaluator blinded as far as 
possible, e.g. assessments which did not require direct contact between the evaluator and the patient 
(e.g. evaluation of images) would be blinded during the entire study period. Since, just as for the 
dose-response study (SONIA 1), the efficacy and safety study (SONIA 2) used objective assessments 
of efficacy for the primary endpoint (u-HGA24 levels), the Applicant states that the lack of a double-
blind design is unlikely to have introduced bias in evaluation of the primary endpoint or those 
secondary endpoints which were based on serum analyses or evaluator-blinded assessments. 
 
 
However, the Applicant recognizes that reporting of subjective assessments potentially introduced bias 
for some of the secondary endpoints, such as pain, QoL assessments, and reporting of AEs. 
The  majority  of  the  assessments,  except  for  self-reported  symptoms  such  as  pain  and  QoL,  were 
performed  by  blinded  evaluators.  Echocardiography  (aortic  stenosis  or  sclerosis),  scintigraphic  scans 
(osteoarticular disease of  joints and spine), X-rays (kyphosis and scoliosis), photographs of eyes and 
ears (pigmentation), and ear cartilage biopsies were evaluated by completely blinded central assessors 
separate  from  the  study  sites  and  thus  in  no  contact  with  study  patients  or  investigators.  Objective 
measurements that were not influenced by the possible knowledge of the patient’s treatment were also 
made by DEXA (osteopenia of the hip) and audiometry. In addition, range of motion and walk tests were 
assessed by independent site staff without knowledge of patient treatment. Patients were instructed not 
to tell the hospital staffs about their treatment. 
Statistical methods 
Based on data from the dose-response study (SONIA 1) it was assumed that u-HGA24 would have a 
log-normal distribution. The primary analysis was a MMRM as follows: log(u-HGA24) = treatment, site, 
age category, visit, treatment by- visit interaction where treatment, visit and treatment-by-visit 
interaction were included as fixed factors while subject-within-site was included as a random factor. A 
compound symmetry covariance matrix was used. The restricted maximum likelihood method (REML) 
was used and the degrees of freedom were estimated using Kenwood-Rogers method. Model-based 
point estimates and associated 95% CIs were calculated. The LS means and confidential intervals (CI) 
for within-group and between-group estimates were exponentiated, which corresponds to adjusted 
geometric means and ratio of adjusted geometric means. Data from beyond the 12-month visit were 
not included in the primary analysis. 
For the final analysis of secondary endpoints at month 48, a longitudinal model was fitted for most 
outcome variables having the fixed factor structure: treatment + site + age category + visit + 
treatment-by-visit interaction, together with the baseline value as a covariate and with subject-within-
site included as a random factor.  
No adjustment for multiple comparisons was made. 
Following a change in the statistical analysis plan (SAP), the multiple imputation techniques to account 
for missing data, originally selected, was changed with a tipping point analysis conducted for the 
following endpoints: u-HGA24, cAKUSSI scores, eye pigmentation, ear pigmentation, osteopenia of the 
hip, and number of spinal regions with pain.  
Imputations were performed in 2 steps. First the intermittently missing observations from both groups 
were imputed using the Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method assuming missing at random 
(MAR), generating 500 datasets. This was done by treatment and covariates used in the analysis 
models (site and age group), resulting in individual imputation models for each treatment*site*age 
subgroup. In case frequencies in some of the treatment*site*age group subgroups were too small for 
modelling, the analysis models could be run only by treatment, or by treatment with only one of the 
covariates (covariate with the smallest p-value in the original analysis was chosen). In the second 
step, the remaining monotonously missing observations were imputed assuming missing not at 
random (MNAR) in the nitisinone group, by adding a shift to the MAR imputed value. The shift added in 
the nitisinone group was calculated as the percentage of the mean value at the given time point in 
nitisinone group. The monotonously missing observations in the untreated group were imputed 
assuming MAR. The same analysis models were used for the imputed data as with the original analyses 
 
data. For endpoints modelling the change from baseline, the imputations were performed on the actual 
values. Changes from baseline were then calculated based on the imputed values. Tipping point results 
are given for the time points with significant treatment differences in favour of nitisinone.

Conduct of the study 
There were 3 amendments to the original clinical study protocol (CSP).  
Amendment no. 1 was approved before the inclusion of any patients in the study. The dose to be used 
in the study was identified and a number of clarifications regarding the different assessments were 
made. 
Amendment no. 2 introduced some minor changes in some of the study procedures. The amendment 
also clarified some of the text in the original CSP, a need identified during the initial study conduct. 
Amendment no. 3 described some changes to the study staff. MRI was changed from being a 
secondary to an exploratory assessment, and some further clarifications were made.

Table 15. Concomitant medications, onset of new medications after randomisation (FAS) 
Data indicate that more nitisinone-treated than untreated patients were prescribed analgesic medication 
after randomization. However, the collection of concomitant medication data was not set up to quantify 
the  use  of  different  drugs.  After  the  study  had  been  ongoing  for  a  couple  of  years,  the  site  in  Paris 
wanted to compare the use of analgesics, as several patients on nitisinone claimed they had reduced 
their  use  considerably.  But  with  only  information  about  start  and  stop  dates  and  varying  degrees  of 
strength and dosing information (very often stated as “on demand”), this was not possible. 
 
 
 
 
Numbers analysed 
Populations for analysis and data on treatment compliance are shown in Tables 16 and 17. 
Table 16. Summary of analysis sets (all randomised patients) 
Table 17. Treatment compliance (FAS, nitisinone- treated only) 
Moreover, 4 subjects had low or undetectable levels of serum nitisinone at one of the planned visits. 
Very few patients were discovered to have low levels of serum nitisinone despite reporting to have 
taken up the drug correctly. It is unlikely that such small numbers had some impact on the general 
reliability of the results. 
Outcomes and estimation 
The results of the MMRM for u-HGA24 at baseline, Months 12 and 48 are presented in table 18 and 
Figure 8.

Nitisinone reduced u-HGA24 by 99.7% compared to no treatment. The maintenance of this effect was 
observed over the whole duration of the study, ie 4 years of treatment. 
The occurrence of achieved target level (<300 μmol) of u-HGA24 at 12 and 48 months are presented 
in Table 19.

nitisinone dose to 1 mg/day 
During the treatment with nitisinone 10 mg, some patients developed keratopathy and the dose were 
reduced to 2 mg/kg. The levels of u-HGA 24h in this subgroup showed an increase of about 10 fold in 
u-HGA after switching to nitisinone 2 mg. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cAKUSSI scores at baseline and Month 48 are shown in the table 21.  
Table 21. cAKUSSI score at baseline and Month 48 (FAS) 
The more severe are the manifestations of AKU, the higher the score is. A reduction of 8.6 points was 
observed in the nitisinone group compared to untreated (95% CI: -16.0, -1.2; p=0.023). The 
difference between the two groups in the change from baseline to Month 48 was statistically 
significant. The Applicant stated that “a tipping point analysis was also conducted to assess the 
potential impact of missing data. While it seems that missing data could have an impact on the 
significant outcome, the continuous improvement over time until Month 36, after which the majority of 
missing data occurs, indicates that the statistically significant outcome at Month 48 is true.”

There were only 14 patients in the group with u-HGA24 ≥ 300 μmol and 41 patients with u-HGA24 < 
300 μmol, when they were grouped based on u-HGA24 at Month 48. 
Patients  with  u-HGA24  values  <300  μmol  had  cAKUSSI  and  mAKUSSI  scores  at  baseline  that  were 
approximately 38% and 57% higher than patients with u-HGA24 values ≥300 μmol. Furthermore, the 
group with u-HGA24 ≥300 μmol was about 10 years younger on average than the group with u-HGA24 
<300 μmol.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In SONIA-1, the primary endpoint (u-HGA levels) was considered appropriate. The CHMP recognized u-
HGA levels as an informative surrogate to evaluate treatment effects. According to the CHMP Scientific 
Advice (SA), increased levels of HGA are the leading cause of ochronosis in patients, that in turn results 
in the co-morbidities effects of alkaptonuria. Even if no human data are available, there are very strong 
evidence  in  mouse  models:  when  mouse  models  are  started on nitisinone  very  early,  this  completely 
prevents  ochronosis  development.  In  human  patients  with  AKU  who  also  develop  renal  failure,  an 
accelerated ochronosis is seen because of the reduced ability to excrete HGA. From the CHMP viewpoint, 
all  these  observations  support  the  validity  of  u-HGA  as  surrogate/pharmacodynamic  endpoint  to  test 
treatment effects. 
The design of the study seems appropriate. The number of subjects recruited for each arm is small (n=8) 
but it must be considered that the endpoints assessed are biochemical markers strictly related to the 
pharmacodynamic mechanism of the investigational product, and thus they are very sensitive indicators 
of the enzymatic inhibition by nitisinone. 
The study did not use placebo as control because of the difficulty to perform an actual double-blind study 
since the treatment is associated with absence of change in urine colour, a phenomenon that can be 
easily  recognized  by  both  patients  and  investigators.  However,  since  the  endpoint  was  a  biochemical 
marker (u-HGA) the lack of blinding of the study should not have impaired the reliability of the efficacy 
results.  
From the clinical development program of Orfadin in hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT-1), it was known 
that a dose of 2 mg/day could reduce urinary excretion of HGA by 95%, while increasing mean tyrosine 
levels to >700 μmol/L. The MAH originally planned to study doses ranging from 0.5 to 4 mg/day aiming 
at finding a dose that would significantly reduce HGA without giving high tyrosine levels with a potential 
of causing ocular adverse events. During the scientific advice, the CHMP expressed a wish to find a dose 
that would normalize HGA. This resulted in doses of 1, 2, 4 to 8 mg being used in the dose-response 
SONIA  1  study  in  patients  with  AKU.  In  SONIA-1,  the  selection  of  the  dose  range  is  not  entirely 
understandable given that the currently approved strengths in the HT-1 indication include 10mg and 20 
mg.    However,  results  showed  that  the  levels  of  u-HGA  24h  markedly  decreased  in  a  clear  dose-
dependent manner with nitisinone treatment. In the 8 mg group (the highest dose used) the reduction 
(vs  baseline)  was  about  99%.  Furthermore,  none  of  the  treated  patients  reached  the  normal  u-HGA 
levels  observed  in  non-AKU  subjects  (normal  values  were  indeed  very  low  and  quantifiable  only  in  a 
fraction of normal subjects) and a ceiling effect was seen at serum concentration of nitisinone of about 
3 umol/L (mostly reached with the 8 mg dosage). Despite the latter finding (ceiling effect at 8 mg dose), 
the CHMP noted that 10 mg dose was used for the pivotal study SONIA-2.   
 
 
During the conduct of the study of SONIA-1, a few errors and mixed up samples and incorrect sample 
times were identified. Considering  the low number of subjects in SONIA-1, the MAH provided further 
details  on    measures  put  in  place  to  minimize  errors  in  handling  and  analysis  of  biological  samples, 
including standard measures to ensure protocol adherence in SONIA-1 and 2. These were considered 
sufficient to support the validity/reliability of  studies.  
In  SONIA-2,  the  study  design,  including  the  open  label  nature,  was  discussed  during  CHMP  scientific 
advice and considered acceptable given that the characteristic coloration of urines induced by nitisinone 
prevents blinding.  
As stated by the MAH, the lack of a double-blind design is unlikely to have introduced bias in evaluation 
of the primary endpoint or those secondary endpoints which were based on serum analyses or evaluator-
blinded assessments. However, reporting of subjective assessments potentially introduced bias for some 
of the secondary endpoints, such as pain, QoL assessments, for the efficacy aspects. From the CHMP 
viewpoint, even with an evaluator blinded assessment, patients could not unintentionally transfer any 
information  about  their  treatment  allocation  to  the  evaluators  and  these  limitations  should  also  be 
considered. 
Regarding  patient  selection  criteria,  it  appears  the  genetic  diagnosis  was  not  required  in  order  to 
diagnose  AKU.  All  patients  were  already  known  to  be  affected  by  AKU.  Ochronosis  was  not  a  specific 
criterion for enrolling the patients: all the Investigators were very familiar with AKU and thus able to 
assess  the  presence  of  sufficient  signs  of  disease  progression,  according  to  the  MAH. Literature  data 
indicate that the amount of HGA excreted per day in individuals with alkaptonuria is usually between 
one and eight grams. Although not specified in the inclusion criteria, at baseline, the mean daily excretion 
of HGA was > 35000 µmol/day in both treatment groups, corresponding to approximately 5.88grams 
per day. The minimum amount excreted in any patient was 7457 µmol (1.25 grams) and the maximum 
84320  µmol  (14.2  grams).  Therefore,  the  observed  baseline  uHGA  levels  are  deemed  appropriate  to 
correctly identify the patient population with AKU. No information on the number of patients with chronic 
back / joint pain at baseline was provided; however, the high proportions of patients taking analgesic 
drugs at baseline is considered indicative of the presence of pain in the large majority of the recruited 
population. The CHMP noted that no radiographic confirmation of arthritis is listed in the inclusion criteria.  
Among  the  inclusion  criteria,  age  ≥25  years  was  required  for  the  enrolment.  Since  the  clinical 
manifestations of AKU usually start between 20-30 years of age, the age threshold was introduced in 
order to increase the sensitivity of the study. This justification seems reasonable. The CHMP noted that 
subjects > 70 years were not enrolled, this information was recommended for inclusion in the SmPC.  
The exclusion criteria include patients with low blood cells count. This is appropriate since, in previous 
experience with nitisinone for treatment of patients affected by HT-1, AEs related to lower blood cells 
count were described. 
The choice of a pharmacodynamic endpoint as the primary outcome variable (u-HGA24) was deemed 
acceptable by the CHMP as it directly relates to the mechanism of action of nitisinone and to what is 
understood as the pathogenic mechanism of the disease. However, it was noted that during the scientific 
advice,  the  CHMP  recommended  that  the  correlation/consistency  between  treatment  effect  on  the 
primary endpoint and long-term clinical outcomes should be demonstrated in order to support nitisinone 
benefit in the claimed indication. 
Upon  the  CHMP  request  that  a  link  should  be  shown,  at  the  end  of  the  study,  between  the  primary 
pharmacodynamics endpoint (u-HGA levels) and clinical outcomes, the evaluation of treatment effect on 
the All Alkaptonuria Severity Score Index (AKUSSI score) was included among the secondary endpoints. 
 
The AKUSSI score measures disease severity in clinical, joint and spine domains. The limits of the AKUSSI 
scoring system are acknowledged: many items are subjective in nature; the number of points for each 
item  does  not  necessary  reflect  the  relative  clinical  importance  or  the  underlying  seriousness  of  the 
disease; the weight given to each severity score may not be optimal. However, in the absence of more 
sensitive tools in such a rare disorder, the AKUSSI score allows to assess, in a comprehensive manner, 
treatment effect on the complex clinical manifestations of the disease.    
The  study  was  powered  to  see  a  difference  of  4  points  on  the  AKUSSI  score  between  control  and 
treatment. The choice of 4 points as minimal clinically important difference is justified by the MAH by 
the fact that this would corresponded to a decrease in disease progression by 50%, assuming an increase 
of  2  points  per  year  in  untreated  patients,  which  is  what  was  found  in  the  original  AKUSSI  study. 
Moreover, according to the MAH, as AKU is a slowly progressing disease it could be difficult to determine 
what level of reduction is considered clinically relevant and, as it is expected that the reduced progression 
will continue as long as the patient is treated with nitisinone, the observed effect after 4 years would be 
considerably more marked after a longer period. 
The primary analysis was a MMRM with treatment, visit and treatment-by-visit interaction included as 
fixed factors and subject-within-site as a random factor. Adjusted geometric means and ratio of adjusted 
geometric means were used to express differences from baseline values, which is considered acceptable 
by  the  CHMP.  Data  from  beyond  the  12-month  visit  were  not  included  in  the  primary  analysis.  Both 
intermittently  and  monotonously  missing  data  were  observed  and  imputed  in  two  steps  tipping  point 
analysis. 
No control for multiplicity was implemented and thus all secondary endpoints are descriptive in nature. 
This limits the interpretation of treatment effect on clinical outcomes. Given that the surrogacy of the 
primary  pharmacodynamic  endpoint  for  long-term  clinical  outcomes  is  not  demonstrated,  the  lack  of 
strong statistical support impact on the strength of the evidence. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Some  imbalance  in  patient’s  demographic  and  clinical  characteristics  were  observed  between  the 
untreated (control) and treated groups. The proportion of patients > 55 years old (33.3% vs 27.5%) as 
well  as  of  female  patients  (42%  vs  34.8%)  was  higher  in  the  nitisinone  group  compared  to  control. 
Patients  in  the  nitisinone  group  showed  overall  a  more  compromised  clinical  status  (around  6-10% 
difference  is  observed  in  many  clinical  characteristics  between  groups).  In  particular,  although  the 
percentage of subjects undergoing arthroscopies, that are indicative of overt joint damage, were similar, 
total joint failure requiring joint replacement was higher at baseline in the nitisinone group (24.6% vs 
17.4%)  compared  to  control.  Small  imbalances  were  also  observed  in  the  use  of  analgesic  and  anti-
inflammatory medications more frequent in the nitisinone group. The higher disease burden at baseline 
in the nitisinone group could be attributed to the larger proportions of patients > 55 years. Patients <55 
years were 96 (46 nitisinone + 50 control), whereas patients > 55 years were 42 (23 nitisinone + 19 
control). Further data with the baseline mean/median scores of the different subdomains of AKUSSI in 
the overall  groups,  by  sex  and  age  confirmed  the  presence of imbalances  in many  clinical  aspects  at 
baseline, apparently suggestive of a more severe condition in the nitisinone group. Consistent with the 
literature reporting women score, on average, 6 units less in for the AKUSSI score in females than males 
of the same age (Cox and Ranganath 2011), higher baseline scores in male patients compared to females 
were  observed  in  SONIA  2.  Similar  findings  were  observed  in  patients  aged  >55  years  vs  <55  years 
(mean score of 69.8 vs 48.2, respectively), in the untreated and treated groups.  Baseline imbalances 
are  also  noted  with  the  additional  efficacy  analysis  based  on  each  patient’s  most  common  u-HGA24 
category. 
Nitisinone  treatment  dramatically  reduced  the  excretion  of  u-HGA24,  reaching  a  nadir  at  month  3. 
Thereafter, u-HGA24 levels were maintained with minor fluctuations throughout the observation period 
of  4  months.  At  month 12,  u-HGA24  levels  (umol/L)  were  85.7  (95  CI:  71.8-102.2)  in  the  nitisinone 
group vs 26027.9 (95% CI: 21649.6-31291.8) in the untreated group. Whilst some observations could 
question the treatment effect e.g physiological levels of u-HGA24 were very low  and undetectable in  
many subjects in the pivotal study, these levels were not reached in AKU patients treated with nitisinone 
group; the proportion of subjects who had u-HGA levels below the pre-defined cut-off of 300 umol was 
88.6% at month 12, but decreased to 59.4% (mean u-HGA24: 158.1) at month 48, the clinical relevance 
of these findings remain uncertain, especially since the u-HGA24 targeted level was set arbitrarily. One 
plausible explanation to the reported reduction in the number of responders could be an effect due to 
patient compliance to treatment, that was indeed lower at month 48 (85.5%) compared to month 12 
(100.0%).  
Some patients who experienced keratopathy were switched to a lower dose of nitisinone, 2 mg, but u-
HGA24 levels increased by 10-fold after the change of dose.  
The cAKUSSI score showed a statistically significant result for nitisinone: difference nitisinone-control at 
month 48 was -8.6 (95% CI: -16.0, -1.2; p=0.023). However, results were clearly driven by treatment 
effect on eye pigmentation, and once the pigmentation variable is removed, as it is in the mAKUSSI, the 
difference between nitisinone and control is reduced to only -3.6 points (95% CI: -9.6, 2.4; p=0.234). 
Treatment effect on the eye pigmentation component of the cAKUSSI score, resulted in a difference from 
control of -2.5 points (95% CI: -3.9, -1.0; p=0.001), likely indicating a reduced rate of HGA precipitation 
in the eye. It is at present not known if a similar effect in other tissues is also observed. 
The lack of a significant gain over the control group using mAKUSSI score did not allow to extrapolate 
that the reduced HGA precipitation in the eye may be considered a proxy for clinical benefit. However, 
it cannot be excluded that the follow up time of 4 years was too short to detect relevant changes in other 
disease manifestations. Moreover, the scoring system used in AKUSSI is suboptimal, as the same score 
is assigned to morbid variables that may require longer times to develop and are expression of different 
stages of disease severity. Higher mAKUSSI scores at baseline were observed in patients aged >55 years 
vs <55 years (mean score of 69.8 vs 48.2, respectively), and in the nitisinone group compared to control. 
When treatment effect was analysed by age and sex all subgroups reached or exceeded the pre-defined 
difference of 4 points between nitisinone and control, in both  cAKUSSI and mAKUSSI scores, except for 
the mAKUSSI score in patients <55 years, suggesting heterogeneity in the untreated and treated groups 
may have contributed to the lack of effect in the total population. While acknowledging that the analysis 
was adjusted with respect to baseline, different severity of the baseline disease could have affected score 
sensitivity  to  detect  improvement.  At  the  CHMP  request,  the  MAH  further  clarified  that  the  primary 
analysis was also adjusted for age and site.  
An  imbalance  in  cAKUSSI  score  at  baseline  was  observed  in  the  Paris  center  with  a  score  of  75.4  vs 
100.1 in control and nitisinone groups, respectively, compared to patients in Liverpool (99.1 vs 96.9), 
and in Piešťany (70.8 vs 74.7). Albeit the numbers were low, the CHMP was concerned that in Piešťany, 
i.e. in the country with the larger prevalence of the disease, and where it is assumed that the clinical 
knowledge of the disease is greater, the numerical difference between treatment and control was the 
lowest  (-4.9  vs  -13  and  -12.9).  These  imbalances  may  have  been  due  to  differences  in  the  clinical 
characteristics  of  patients  across  the  different  centers,  as  reported  by  the  MAH,  including  the  lower 
baseline  mean  cAKUSSI  score  and  patient  age  in  Piešťany  compared  to  Liverpool  and  Paris  centers. 
Although confidence interval (CI) were large (Piešťany having the largest CI), the point estimate was in 
favour of the treatment in all sites. 
If treatment effect on individual variables of the mAKUSSI is examined, trends towards amelioration in 
some disease components are observed, such as in osteopenia (T score -0.19 vs -0.05; p=0.045), bone 
fractures (8 new bone fractures vs 3, and similar baseline values), and soft tissues ruptures (8 vs 4), 
although in this last case nitisinone patients with ruptures were lower at baseline compared with control 
(30.4%  vs  24.6%  and  the  number  of  soft  tissue  ruptures:  31  vs  27).  The  positive  trend observed  in 
favour of nitisinone on spinal pain could instead likely due to a larger use of analgesic drugs compared 
to  control  (almost  doubled  in  the  nitisinone  group),  however,  the  study  protocol  did  not  allow  for  a 
thorough investigation about the use of other medications and thus any firm conclusion is difficult to be 
drawn on this aspect. 
Overall, the CHMP view is that it is difficult to infer treatment effect based only on some parameters, 
and excluding others, as the risk of selection bias is very high. Nevertheless, it is noted that two third of 
the  point  estimates  of  the  individual  mAKUSSI  items  favoured  nitisinone  group.  When  additional 
responder analyses, using different definitions of responders, were performed by the MAH, in 6 out of 7 
of them, a consistent trend in favour of the treated population compared to the untreated patients was 
observed. When treatment effect is analysed by patients’ u-HGA levels (<300 umol/L and >300 umol/L), 
it  seems  that  patients  with  higher  u-HGA  levels,  i.e.  those  with  hypothetical  less  strict  control  of  the 
disease, experienced better outcomes. Whereas this subgroup was small (n=14) and included younger 
patients (difference of about 10 years) who had better baseline conditions (mean mAKUSSI at baseline 
was 40.8 [21.4 SD] vs 62.4 [28.7 SD] in patients with u-HGA levels <300 umol/L), and thus may have 
been favoured by earlier initiation of treatment, the CHMP considered that the results of the additional 
responder analyses together with this finding supported the consistency between treatment effect across 
disease manifestations and uHGA levels. 
Regarding  efficacy  on  other  secondary  endpoints,  the  CHMP  noted  that  more  patients  treated  with 
nitisinone underwent joint replacement. In particular, at month 36, 13 patients (18.8%) treated with 
nitisinone  vs  7  (10.1%)  in  the  control group  were  submitted  to  this  surgical procedure;  the numbers 
increased to 17 patients (24.6%) vs 10 (14.5%) at month 48, for nitisinone and control, respectively. 
However, this may be explained by the baseline characteristics of the nitisinone group, which included 
more older patients compared to control, and also more patients (17, 24.6%) had experienced some 
joint  replacements,  compared  to  the  control  arm  (12,  17.4%).  In  addition,  patients  in  SONIA  2  were 
recruited from several countries, and clinical guidelines for performing joint replacements varies between 
countries, as well as between different clinics within a country. Data about the range of joint motion are 
conflicting  and  of  difficult  interpretation  (Figure  15).  At  12  and  36  months,  some  joints  show  a 
statistically significant difference that, however, disappears at other time points of the assessment (e.g. 
at 48 months). Moreover, for some joints (at some assessment times) the point estimate favours the 
untreated patients. For SF-36 Health Survey, in general a trend is observed in favour to nitisinone (Figure 
16) but, the interpretation of these data in a trial not blinded is almost impossible. Of note, at month 
48, none of the domains was statistically better in the nitisinone group, even those that were statistically 
significant at previous time points. The strength of the data does not allow any mention of treatment 
effect of patient reported outcomes in the SmPC.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In the pivotal study, the efficacy was met for the primary endpoint (uHGA24) and cAKUSSI score 
(secondary endpoint). Despite the lack of statistical significance in the total population for the 
mAKUSSI score (secondary endpoint), two third of the point estimates of the individual mAKUSSI 
items favoured the nitisinone group. Additional efficacy analyses using different responder definitions 
also demonstrated consistency between treatment effect across disease manifestations and uHGA 
levels, 
The clinical efficacy of nitisinone in the claimed indication is thus considered demonstrated.   
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Orfadin is already approved in EU in adults and paediatric patients with HT-1, at the daily dose of 
1mg/kg body weight, that is significantly larger than the 10 mg fixed dose proposal for the AKU 
indication in adults. In the currently approved indication, the drug safety profile is mainly characterised 
by the risks posed by treatment-induced elevated tyrosine levels that may be associated with toxicity 
to eyes, skin, and the nervous system; however, Orfadin treatment in HT-1 is commonly associated to 
eye-related adverse reactions, and less commonly with skin disorders. Blood and lymphatic system 
disorders were also commonly described during HT-1 treatment in clinical trials, although 
predominantly mild and moderate in severity. 
The clinical safety dataset for the AKU indication is based on 2 clinical studies in patients with AKU.  
-  The  randomized  open-label  4-week  no-treatment  controlled  parallel-group  dose-response  study  in 
patients with AKU (SONIA-1); 
- The phase 3 randomized evaluator-blinded no-treatment controlled parallel-group long-term efficacy 
and safety study in patients with AKU (SONIA-2) 
In addition, supportive data from a prospective open-label long-term uncontrolled compassionate-use 
study in patients with TH1 and data from post-marketing surveillance from the Sobi safety database, 
corresponding  to  exposure  during  a  total  of  16  557  patient  years,  were  also  submitted.  These  data 
confirmed the known safety profile of Orfadin in the authorised indication and will not be further detailed 
in this report.  
With the limits of the small sample size (n=8 per group) and short duration of the study (4 weeks) of 
SONIA-1 study, the adverse events (AEs) reported below is focusing on the long-term efficacy and safety 
of SONIA-2 study 
In SONIA-1 study, there were no SAEs reported and no patient discontinued participation due to an 
AE. All adverse events were mild, except for one event of moderate back pain in the 4-mg dose group. 
No notable differences across the treatment groups were observed in hematology, clinical chemistry or 
vital signs during the study. No patient experienced any corneal effects. Overall, no safety concerns 
were identified at any of the tested doses of nitisinone over 4 weeks. 
Patient exposure 
The clinical study program involved a 4-week dose-response study in 40 patients with AKU (SONIA 1), 
and a 4-year clinical efficacy and safety study in 138 patients with AKU (SONIA 2). 
The exposure to nitisinone in the AKU development program is shown in the table 47.

Adverse events  
One hundred and thirty-eight (138) out of the planned total of 140 patients were included in the 4-
year efficacy and safety study. Treatment was initiated in all patients randomized to nitisinone. In the 
untreated group, withdrawn consent was the most common reason for not completing the study, while 
AE was the most common reason in the nitisinone group. The number of patients reporting at least one 
AE was comparable for the two treatment groups, however, there were more AE reports in nitisinone-
treated than in untreated control patients as shown in the table 47. 
Table 47 Overall summary of AEs in 4 year efficacy and safety study (SONIA 2, Safety 
Analysis set) 
The  number  of  patients  with  AEs  was  similar  between  treatment,  n=59  (85.5%),  and  no-treatment 
groups, n=57 (82.6%). However the number of AEs was higher in the nitisinone group, n=400, vs no-
 
 
 
 
treatment, n=284. The number of patients with SAEs was similar between the two groups: 39.1% in 
nitisinone vs 37.7% in untreated.  
The following table 48 shows the most common AEs in nitisinone group by Standard Organ Class 
(SOC) and Preferred Terms (PT).

≥0.1/10 patient years in nitisinone group), Safety Analysis Set 
 
 
 
The most commonly TEAEs reported with higher frequency with nitisinone compared to untreated group 
were  within  the  SOC  Musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorder  (44.9%  vs  34.8%  in  untreated 
group; with an incidence rate of 1.11 vs 0.9 per 10 pts year), followed by Infections and infestations 
(39.1% vs 15.9%, incidence rate 1.04 vs. 0.41 per 10 patient years). The most common localization of 
infections was the respiratory tract. This difference was seen for all subgroups, i.e., age categories, sites 
and sexes.  
None of the infections was assessed by the investigator or the MAH as related to treatment and most of 
them  were  non-serious.  None  of  the  infections  led  to  discontinuation  of  treatment.  There  was  no 
substantial difference in leucocyte and neutrophil counts between treated and untreated patients and 
there were no reports of leukopenia or neutropenia. Information on agents for the infections is sparse 
and  no  specific  agents  have  been  identified  as  causative  for  the  infections.  No  connection  between 
nitisinone and infections has been identified in a review of the scientific literature (preclinical and clinical). 
According to the MAH, there are no indications, either from the study of patients with HT-1 (NTBC study 
with  a  total  of  291  patients)  or  from  post  marketing  use  (over  15  years),  that  infectious  events  are 
related  to  nitisinone  treatment.  In  the  NTBC  study,  8  cases  of  infections  were  reported,  and  none  of 
these was reported in connection with leukopenia and/or neutropenia. Searches of post-marketing cases 
in the Global safety database (up to February 20, 2019) resulted in 82 ICSRs with 93 events within the 
SOC “Infections and infestations”. This constituted 3.4 % of the AEs cumulatively reported for nitisinone 
at  that  time.  In  patients  using  nitisinone  off-label  (AKU),  2  AEs  in  70  ICSRs  concern  infections,  both 
coded as conjunctivitis. 
TEAEs of Eye disorders were recorded in 36.2% of patients treated with nitisinone vs 11.6 % of untreated 
patients,  with  an  incidence  rate  of  0.96  vs.  0.30  per  10  patient  years).  In  the  nitisinone  group,  10 
patients had tyrosine-related eye disorders, and 9 nitisinone-treated patients developed tyrosine-related 
keratopathy in one or both eyes as confirmed by slit-lamp examination. One more patient, who could 
not come for a follow-up visit, was withdrawn from the study due to suspected keratopathy based on 
symptoms of eye pain. No untreated patients developed keratopathy. 
 
 
Among the 9 patients diagnosed with keratopathy, 8 patients had other eye symptoms, such as pain, 
hyperaemia, blurred vision or other signs, before the diagnosis by slit-lamp examination. One patient 
reported no symptoms before keratopathy was seen by slit lamp at a pre-planned visit. The keratopathy 
was completely resolved in all 9 patients at a follow-up visit at least 2 months after nitisinone withdrawal. 
For one patient, there were logistical problems with supplying the 2-mg capsules and this patient was 
therefore withdrawn from the study. For the remaining 8 patients, nitisinone was restarted at a dose of 
2 mg/day after recovery of the keratopathy; 5 of those had recurrent symptoms and were withdrawn 
from the study while 2 were still asymptomatic at the end of the study, and for 1 patient, keratopathy 
was discovered at the final visit.  
The time to development of the first tyrosine related TEAE ranged from 32 days to about 2 years and 11 
months  after  randomization.  The  median  time  to  development  of  eye  disorders  was  375  days  of 
treatment with 10 mg/day nitisinone. 
In the table 49 below, data about vital signs (blood pressure and body weight) are reported. 
Table 49. Vital signs (Safety analysis set)_ 
 
 
The blood pressure (BP) was slightly increased in the nitisinone-treated subjects compared to untreated 
subjects. In particular systolic blood pressure was increased of about 4.4 mmHg, already after 12 months 
of treatment. No further increase was evident at 48 months compared to 12 months. Of note, there is 
no  evidence  of  nitisinone  effect  on  the  cardiovascular  system  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  studies,  all  studies 
showed  no  nitisinone  pharmacologically  significant  effects  on  heart  rate,  blood  pressure,  and  cardiac 
force.  
More patients treated with nitisinone in SONIA 2 experienced weight gain compared to non-treated, 
about 2.9 kg at the end of the 48 months. Most of the weight was gained after the first 12 months of 
treatment, and after that time point the rate of change seems to be slower. 
Additional  analyses  were  submitted  to  investigate  these  safety  findings  at  the  CHMP  request.  The 
percentage of patients with categorical increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were presented 
in the table 50. The individual blood pressures for patients raising to above the reference range at any 
time, and shift plots of blood pressure were shown in Figures 18 and 19. For the systolic blood pressure, 
patients are divided into two categories, systolic pressure <140 mmHg or ≥ 140 mmHg, where ≥ 140 
mmHg is considered as an elevated blood pressure according to international recognized guideline WHO 
guideline. For the diastolic blood pressure, patients are divided into two categories, diastolic pressure 
<90 mmHg or ≥ 90 mmHg, where ≥ 90 mmHg is considered as an elevated blood pressure according 
to the WHO guideline.

Figure 18. individual blood pressures for patients raising to above the reference range at any 
time 
Figure 19. shift plots of blood pressure (Safety Analysis Set) 
Whereas,  SONIA  2  was  not  designed  to  systematically  evaluate  blood  pressure  over  time  (e.g.  blood 
pressure  was  measured  annually  at  a  single  time  point  and  the  method  was  not  standardized),  the 
following observations can be made based on the presented data: 
- 
the number of patients who had systolic BP >140 mmHg at month 48 was higher in nitisinone 
(16,  27.6%)  than  in  control  (8,  15.1%).  However,  in  the  nitisinone  group  no  difference  was 
observed compared to baseline (19, 27.5%). Thus, the observed difference between treated and 
non-treated patients seems due to a reduction of systolic BP in the control group; 
- 
the number of patients who switched from <140 mmHg to >140 mmHg at month 48 with respect 
to baseline is equal to patients who switched in the other direction (from >140 mmHg to <140 
mmHg),  in  the  nitisinone  group.  Thus,  there  was  no  net  change  in  the  number  of  patients 
classified in the two BP stages, at month 48; 
 
 
- 
the number of patients who had diastolic BP >90 mmHg at month 48 was higher in nitisinone 
group (13, 22.4%) compared to control (5, 9.4%). At baseline the treated patients having >90 
mmHg were lower (11, 15.9%) thank at month 48; 
-  more  patients  in  the  nitisinone  group  shifted  from  diastolic  BP  <90  mmHg  to  >90  mmHg  at 
month  48  (10,  17.2%)  compared  to  control  (5,  9.4%)  and  also  compared  to  those  treated 
patients who shifted from >90 mmHg to <90 mmHg (6, 10.3%); this means that there is a small 
net increase (n=4, about 7 percentage points) in the number of patients who had >90 mmHg at 
month 48 compared to baseline. 
The distribution of patients by body weight and the shifts among different categories of BMI were shown 
in Table 51 and Figure 20. 
 
 
 
Table 51 BMI, categorised (Safety Analysis Set) 
Figure 20. Shift plots of BMI 
The following observations can be made based on the presented data: 
 
 
 
 
- 
- Weight gain was observed in 20.3% of patients treated with nitisinone treatment compared to 
5.8 % of untreated patients. The increase in BW was already apparent after one year (2.5 kg vs 
0 kg in control) and was maintained with a small increase through the whole 4-year period (2.9 
kg vs 0.2 kg in control); 
- 
the number of patients who switched from <140 mmHg to >140 mmHg at month 48 with respect 
to baseline is equal to patients who switched in the other direction (from >140 mmHg to <140 
mmHg), in the nitisinone group: so basically, there was no net change in the number of patients 
classified in the two BP stages, at month 48; 
- 
the number of patients who had diastolic BP >90 mmHg at month 48 was higher in nitisinone 
group (13, 22.4%) compared to control (5, 9.4%). At baseline the treated patients having >90 
mmHg were lower (11, 15.9%) thank at month 48; 
-  more  patients  in  the  nitisinone  group  shifted  from  diastolic  BP  <90  mmHg  to  >90  mmHg  at 
month  48  (10,  17.2%)  compared  to  control  (5,  9.4%)  and  also  compared  to  those  treated 
patients who shifted from >90 mmHg to <90 mmHg (6, 10.3%); this means that there is a small 
net increase (n=4, about 7 percentage points) in the number of patients who had >90 mmHg at 
month 48 compared to baseline. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
In SONIA-2, there were 2 deaths; both occurred in nitisinone-treated patients. One death was due to 
heart failure, and one was due to myocardial infarction. None of the events was considered, by the 
investigator, to be related to nitisinone treatment. 
The first patient was a, treated with nitisinone 10 mg daily, was hospitalized for an operation of an 
aortic stenosis (onset before study start). died during the aortic valve replacement, due to an acute 
myocardial infarction and subsequent cardiac failure. The concomitant illness of aortic stenosis was 
considered to have accounted for the event.  The second patient was a, who was treated with 
nitisinone 10 mg daily. The patient died at a hospital, but the hospital has not been willing to release 
medical records. The patient was admitted to hospital due to pneumonia and “infarction” (not 
specified) causing fluid in the lungs and the patient passed away as a result of complications of the 
pneumonia 10 days later. This corresponds to Day 1321 in the study, but because of the lack of 
contact with the patient after Month 36 visit, there is no information on when the patient took final 
dose of nitisinone. It is assumed, however, that the patient continued with the nitisinone treatment 
until hospitalization.  
 
 
SAEs 
SAEs are listed in the table 52 below by frequency. 
Table 52. Serious adverse events (SAE) by SOC, sorted by incidence rate in the nitisinone 
group (Safety analysis set) 
SAEs were reported in a similar proportion of untreated and nitisinone-treated patients, with the 
highest incidence in the SOC “Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders”. None of the SAEs was 
considered by the investigator to be related to nitisinone. 
Laboratory findings 
Serum tyrosine 
The table 53 shows the levels of serum tyrosine in treated and untreated patients. 
 
 
 
 
Table 53. Serum tyrosine concerntrations (µmol/L) at baseline, Month 3 and Month 12 (Full 
analysis set) 
In  SONIA-2,  serum  tyrosine  concentrations  at  baseline  were  comparable  in  nitisinone-treated  and 
untreated  patients  (median  66  vs.  65  μmol/L)  however  after  3  months  increased  significantly  in 
nitisinone-treated  patients  (median  939  vs.  62  μmol/L).  Tyrosine  concentrations  in  nitisinone-treated 
patients thereafter remained elevated at approximately the same level until the 48-Month assessment 
(median 830.5 vs. 61.5 μmol/L). All patients were asked to reduce their protein intake. Patients in the 
nitisinone group were additionally informed that high tyrosine concentrations may cause eye problems. 
In many cases, lowering the nitisinone dose from 10 to 2 mg/day did not result in significantly lower 
tyrosine  concentrations,  i.e.,  concentrations  were  not  reduced  to  levels  under  500  μmol/L  (the 
recommended  limit).  This  finding  is  in  line  with  the  results  from  SONIA-1  study.  In  SONIA-1,  mean 
tyrosine concentrations increased with dose of nitisinone. However, all doses, including the 1-mg dose, 
resulted in daily average concentrations above 500 μmol/L in all individuals, and individual maximum 
concentrations of approximately 600 μmol/L or more. 
Alkaline phosphatase 
In SONIA-2, Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) increased in the nitisinone group at all visits after baseline. 
The greatest change from baseline (median value) was seen at Month 12. After that time, there was 
no further general increase in alkaline phosphatase. For 4 patients, the changes were considered 
clinically significant and were reported as AEs; either as increased alkaline phosphatase (3 patients) or 
as increased liver enzymes. The table below shows the levels of ALP at 12 and 48 months.

Set) 
Safety in special populations 
In the clinical development program for treatment of patients with AKU, all included patients were 
adults, and 92 to 97 % were White. Subgroup analyses of the incidence of AEs were performed in 
SONIA-2 with no apparent differences in incidences when analysed by age categories, sites and sexes.  
Patients with renal impairment (defined as eGFR <60 mL/min) or with hepatic impairment were not 
included in the AKU clinical development program.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No new information on the safety related drug-drug interactions were submitted, which is considered 
acceptable by the CHMP.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
AEs that led to study discontinuation are presented in table 55 below. Eye disorders were the most 
commonly reported system organ class and keratopathy the most commonly reported preferred term. 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 55. Adverse events leading to study discontinuation by SOC and PT (Safety analysis 
set) 
Post marketing experience 
No information on post-marketing experience with nitisinone in AKU patients was submitted, which is 
considered acceptable by the CHMP. The long-term safety data available in HT-1 patients confirmed the 
known safety profile of nitisinone. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Orfadin is already approved in EU in adults and paediatric patients with HT-1, at the daily dose of 1mg/kg 
body weight, that is significantly larger than the 10 mg fixed dose proposed for the AKU indication in 
adults. In the currently approved indication, the drug safety profile is mainly characterised by the risks 
posed by treatment-induced elevated tyrosine levels that may be associated with toxicity to eyes, skin, 
and  the  nervous  system;  however,  Orfadin  treatment  in  HT-1  is  commonly  associated  to  eye-related 
adverse reactions, and less commonly to skin disorders.  Blood and lymphatic system disorders were 
also  commonly  described  during  HT-1  treatment  in  clinical  trials,  although  predominantly  mild  and 
moderate in severity. 
The clinical safety dataset for the AKU indication is based on 2 clinical studies in patients with AKU.  
-  The  randomized  open-label  4-week  no-treatment  controlled  parallel-group  dose-response  study  in 
patients with AKU (SONIA 1); 
 
 
 
 
 
- The phase 3 randomized evaluator-blinded no-treatment controlled parallel-group long-term efficacy 
and safety study in patients with AKU (SONIA 2) 
In addition, supportive data from a prospective open-label long-term uncontrolled study in patients with 
HT-1  and  data  from  post-marketing  surveillance  corresponding  to  exposure  during  a  total  of  16  557 
patient years, confirmed the known safety profile of Orfadin in the authorised indication. 
Maximum  exposure  of  AKU  patients  to  nitisinone  10  mg  daily  dosage  was  48  months.  A  total  of  64 
patients were exposed for <24 months, 59 patients were exposed for > 36 months and 55 patients for 
48 months and 16 patients for > 48 months.   
The  most  common  TEAEs,  in  the  AKU  development  program,  were  musculoskeletal  and  connective 
disorders, which were expected as they are main manifestations of the underlying AKU disease. However 
their prevalence was higher in the nitisinone group (44.9%) compared to the control group (34.8%).  
The second most frequent TEAEs with nitisinone were infections (39.1% vs 15.9%), in particular in the 
respiratory tract. The frequency of pneumonia was 5.9% in nitisinone vs 0 in control; the frequency of 
bronchitis was 7.2% in nitisinone vs 1.4% in control. In the last PSUR, in the HT-1 indication, there were 
3  cases  of  pneumonia  observed  in  an  observational  study  and  2  spontaneous  cases;  as  regards 
bronchitis, one case was reported in an observational study. Over the 4 annual site visits, leucocyte and 
neutrophil counts were not notably different in nitisinone-treated compared to untreated patients, and 
there were no reports of leukopenia or neutropenia. The reason for the observed higher frequency of 
infections in the AKU indication compared to HT-1 is thus not clear. However, the increase in pneumonia 
and bronchitis cases was observed in the pivotal study with a randomised control design and the CHMP 
recommended their inclusion as new adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the SmPC.  
The  third  most  frequent  TEAEs  were  eye  disorders,  markedly  more  frequent  in  the  nitisinone  group 
(36.2%) compared to control (11.6%). Eye disorders were also the most frequent cause of treatment 
discontinuation (n=6, 8.7% of patients in nitisinone group vs no one in the control group). In particular, 
keratopathy was observed only in nitisinone treated patients (13%). AEs leading to study discontinuation 
were more frequent in the nitisinone treatment (13%) compared to controls (1.4%). The most frequent 
AE  reported  for  discontinuation  was  eye  disorders  in  nitisinone  group,  which  led  to  discontinuation  in 
8.7% (n=6) of patients treated with nitisinone and in no one of the patients untreated. Among these, 
keratopathy  was  present  in  5  patients  (7.2%)  and  1  patients  was  affected  by  eye  pain  (1.4%).The 
frequency of eye disorders, including keratopathy, appears higher in AKU compared to HT-1 patients, 
and    the  CHMP  recommended  that  this  difference  in  frequency    is  reflected  in  the  SmPC,  ADR  Table. 
Furthermore,  levels  of  tyrosine  were  markedly  increased  in  AKU  patients  treated  with  nitisinone,  as 
expected. After 3 months the levels of tyrosine rose from a baseline value (umol/L) of 65.3 to 950.8. 
Management of tyrosine elevation is not obvious because dose reduction does not automatically result 
in  significant  decreases  in  tyrosine  levels,  which  are  increased  also  with  small  doses  of  1  mg/day. 
Moreover, in subjects with keratopathy who reduced the dose to 2 mg/day, recurrence of the keratopathy 
was observed. Temporary discontinuation of the drug is thus the only choice. A warning has thus been 
agreed by the CHMP for inclusion in the SmPC, for patients who develop keratopathies included in the 
SmPC.  In  patients  who  develop  keratopathies,  plasma  tyrosine  levels  should  be  monitored.  A  diet 
restricted in tyrosine and phenylalanine should be implemented to keep the plasma tyrosine level below 
500 micromol/l.  In  addition,  nitisinone  should  be  temporarily  discontinued  and  may  be  reintroduced 
when the symptoms have been resolved. 
 
 
Skin disorders are also known to be associated to increased levels of tyrosine. In AKU patients treated 
with nitisinone skin-related AEs were more frequent in nitisinone group, n=15 (21.7%), compared to 
untreated, n=9 (13.0%). The frequency of skin disorders in the AKU population has been reflected in 
the SmPC.  
Apparent  increases  in  both  systolic  and  diastolic  pressure  were  observed  with  nitisinone  treatment. 
Although numerical low, elevations in systolic (4 mm vs -3.3 mm in control) and diastolic values (3.8 
mm vs 1.1 mm in control) were already observed after 1 year. However, SONIA 2 was not designed to 
systematically evaluate blood pressure over time (e.g. blood pressure was measured annually at a single 
time  point  and  the  method  was  not  standardized).  Shift  plots  of  systolic  and diastolic  blood  pressure 
showed  no  systematic  change  in  blood  pressure  with  nitisinone  and  in  addition  no  evidence  of 
pharmacologically  significant  effects  of  nitisinone  on  heart  rate,  blood  pressure,  cardiac  force  was 
generated  from  non-clinical  studies.  Thus,  there  was  no  clear  signal  about  blood  pressure  increase 
associated  with  nitisinone,  however  a  signal  about  cardiovascular-related  SAEs  was  identified  (see 
further  below).  The  MAH  agreed  monitor  and  provide  a  cumulative  review  of  the  cases  related  to 
cardiovascular safety in future PSURs. 
Weight gain was observed in 20.3% of patients treated with nitisinone treatment compared to 5.8% of 
patients in the control. The increase in BW was already apparent after one year (2.5 kg vs 0 kg in control) 
and was maintained with a small increase through the whole 4 year period (2.9 kg vs 0.2 kg in control). 
However,  it  is  acknowledged  that  due  to  baseline  imbalances,  the  proportion  of  patients  who  were 
overweight and obese at baseline was higher in the nitisinone group compared to the untreated controls. 
This imbalance could have impacted the results, as those already overweight may be more likely to put 
on  weight  than  are  normal-weight  subjects.  Moreover,  patients  treated  with  nitisinone  could  have 
followed the suggested diet, low in proteins, more strictly compared to control group, because aware 
that high tyrosine concentrations may cause eye problems, during nitisinone treatment. Therefore, no 
sound conclusion is at present possible on nitisinone effect on body weight. 
There were 2 deaths in the nitisinone group and none in the untreated group, during the 4 years of the 
pivotal  study.  The  deaths  were  considered  not  related  to  nitisinone  treatment  by  the  investigator; 
however, for one of the reported deaths, the patient could have died by pneumonia and/or myocardial 
infarction.  
The  total  frequency  of  SAEs  was  slightly  higher  in  the  nitisinone  group  compared  to  control  (39.1  vs 
37.7, respectively). The most common SAEs were musculoskeletal (26% vs 23.2% in control). Of note 
a larger proportion of SAE of cardiac disorders (5.8% vs 1.4% in control) and infections (4.4% vs 1.3% 
in control) was observed with nitisinone treatment.  
Patients with renal impairment or with hepatic impairment were not included in the AKU clinical 
development program. However, post-marketing experience in these populations are available in 
patients with HT-1 and no specific dose adjustment is required for patients with renal or hepatic 
impairment, as currently recommended in the SmPC information. 
Since a few cases of reversible thrombocytopenia and leucopenia were observed in study of patients 
with HT-1, existing recommendation to monitor regularly platelet and WBC counts is also applicable to 
AKU patients. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of nitisinone in adult patients with AKU is considered sufficiently characterised, and 
overall qualitative similar to that already known for the HT-1 indication. However, the frequency of 
several AEs, in particularly those related to tyrosine elevation appears increased (keratopathy, eye 
 
pain), and moreover some new AEs were reported, including infections, particularly in the respiratory 
system (bronchitis, pneumonia). These differences in frequency are reflected in the SmPC. 
In addition, the MAH should submit the following safety data with the next PSUR: 
- a cumulative review of the cases related to cardiovascular safety, discussing the cases separately per 
indication 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version with this application (Version 5.3): Update of RMP per 
current template (Rev 2.0 accompanying GVP Module V Rev. 2); addition of new indication 
alkaptonuria in relevant sections; update of post-marketing data, including data from completed post-
authorization safety study Sobi.NTBC-005, in hereditary tyrosinemia type 1; removal of 
“Hypertyrosinemia-related eye disorders”, “Increased tyrosine levels”, and 
“Leukopenia/granulocytopenia” as important identified risks. 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 5.3  is acceptable. 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 5.3 with the following content:

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2,4.4,4.6,4.8, 5.1 and 10 of the SmPC have 
been updated. Particularly, a new warning with regard to patients who develop keratopathies has been 
added to the product information.The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH. However, the changes to the package leaflet are minimal and 
do not require user consultation with target patient groups. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Alkaptonuria (AKU) is rare genetic disorder caused by deficiency of homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase, the 
enzyme that converts homogentisic acid (HGA) to maleylacetoacetic acid along the tyrosine degradation 
pathway. Of 626 patients identified worldwide, there are 358 patients in Europe, 208 of whom are found 
in Slovakia. 
The disorder is characterized by excretion of HGA at high levels in the urine, the precipitation of a bluish-
black pigment (derived from HGA) in connective tissues, a process called ochronosis, and arthritis of the 
spine and large joints. HGA undergoes oxidation also in urine determining dark discolouration of urine. 
The ochronosis occurs usually after 30 years of age. According to one study 50% of patients require at 
least one joint replacement by age 55 years [Phornphutkul et al 2002]. Other manifestations can include 
pigment deposition in clear and ear, aortic or mitral valve calcifications or regurgitation and occasionally 
aortic dilatation, renal stones, and prostate stones. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Currently,  no  medicinal  products  are  approved  for  AKU  and  nitisinone  is  sometimes  used  off-label  to 
treat patients with AKU. 
 
 
 
 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
SONIA-2  was  an  international,  multicentre,  randomized,  open-label,  evaluator-blinded,  parallel-group 
study with an untreated control group (1:1). The study duration was 48 months with a 12-month interim 
analysis. Main inclusion criteria were confirmed diagnosis of AKU based on elevated urinary homogentisic 
acid  excretion  (uHGA  levels);  age  ≥25  years;  any  clinical  manifestations  of  AKU,  such  as  clinical 
ochronosis or chronic back/joint pain.  
The primary objective was to demonstrate that nitisinone is superior compared to no treatment in 
reducing u-HGA24 in patients with AKU after 12 months.  
The primary endpoint was urine levels of HGA in 24h after 12 months of treatment with nitisinone. The 
use  of  a  primary  endpoint  based  on  a  pharmacodynamic  variable  is  in  line  with  the  CHMP 
recommendation during scientific advice. The CHMP also recommended that, although only HGA is the 
cause of the ochronosis process that in turn results in the co-morbidities effects of alkaptonuria, there 
is no historical clinical data to support the assumption that the control of HGA levels in patients with AKU 
will stop ochronosis.  
The main secondary endpoint was the evaluation of treatment effect on the All Alkaptonuria Severity 
Score  Index  (AKUSSI  score)  that  measures  disease severity  in  clinical,  joint  and  spine  domains.  Two 
versions  of  the  AKUSSI  scoring  system  were  used  in  the  study,  cAKUSSI  which  includes  eye 
pigmentation, and mAKUSSI without eye pigmentation in line with the CHMP scientific advice. Indeed, 
the CHMP recommended to provide data on treatment effect on clinical outcomes to support the claim 
indication  and  was  of  the  view  that  a  link  should  be  shown  from  HGA  through  ochronosis  to  clinical 
outcome. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In SONIA-2, Nitisinone reduced u-HGA24 by 99.7% compared to no treatment at month 12 (primary 
endpoint). At month 12 u-HGA24h (umol/L) were 85.7 (95% CI: 71.8; 102.2) in nitisinone group, vs 
26027.9 (95% CI: 21649.6; 31291.8) in the untreated group. The excretion of u-HGA24 reached a nadir 
at month 3. 
The  maintenance  of  this  effect  was  observed  over  the  whole  duration  of  the  study,  ie  4  years  of 
treatment. At month 48 u-HGA24h (umol/L) were 158.1 (95% CI: 117; 213.6) in nitisinone group, vs 
29936.1 (95% CI: 22090.6; 40568) in the untreated group.  
In SONIA-2, cAKUSSI score was statistically different between the nitisinone and untreated groups at 
month 48: change from baseline was 7.4 (95% CI: 2.1; 12.8) in nitisinone group vs 16.1 (95% CI: 10.7; 
21.4) in untreated subjects. Adjusted mean (difference nitisinone-untreated) was -8.6 (95% CI: -16.0; 
-1.2;  p=0.023).  The  cAKUSSI  component  for  eye  pigmentation  was  statistically  different  between 
nitisinone  and  control:  change  from  baseline  was  0.5  (95%  CI:  -0.5;  1.6)  in  nitisinone  group  vs  3.0 
(95%  CI:  1.9;  4.1)  in  untreated  subjects.  Adjusted  mean  (difference  nitisinone-untreated)  was  -2.5 
(95% CI: -3.9; -1.0; p=0.001). The mAKUSSI score showed trends towards amelioration in some of its 
components, such as in osteopenia (T score -0.19 vs -0.05; p=0.045), number of spinal regions with 
pain (adjusted mean difference nitisinone-untreated: -0.5; 95% CI: -0.9; 0.0, p=0.048), bone fractures 
(8 new bone fractures vs 3, and similar baseline values; p=0.056), and soft tissues ruptures (8 vs 4). 
Overall, about two third of the point estimates of the individual mAKUSSI items favoured nitisinone. 
 
 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The proportion of subjects who had u-HGA levels below the pre-defined cut-off of 300 umol was 88.6% 
at month 12 but decreased to 59.4% (mean u-HGA24: 158.1) at month 48. This could be an effect due 
to patient compliance to treatment. The clinical relevance of this finding is unclear as the threshold was 
set arbitrarily, and measurement of physiological levels of u-HGA24 were very low, even undetectable 
in some cases; such low levels were not reached by treatment with nitisinone. 
No adjustment for multiplicity was performed, thus all secondary outcomes are considered exploratory 
in  nature.    The  AKUSSI  scoring  system  is  currently  the  only  available  sensitive  tool  to  assess,  in  a 
comprehensive  manner,  treatment  effect  on  the  complex  clinical  manifestations  of  the  disease.  
However, it has some limitations, e.g the same score is assigned to morbid variables that may require 
longer times to develop, and are expression of different stages of disease severity.  
Results on cAKUSSI were driven by treatment effect on eye pigmentation, and once the pigmentation 
variable was removed, as it is in the mAKUSSI, the difference between nitisinone and control was reduced 
to only -3.6 points and no statistical significance difference was observed (95% CI: -9.6, 2.4; p=0.234). 
Higher mAKUSSI scores at baseline were observed in patients aged >55 years vs <55 years (mean score 
of 69.8 vs 48.2, respectively), in the nitisinone group compared to control. When treatment effect was 
analysed  by  age  and  sex  all  subgroups  reached  or  exceeded  the  pre-defined  difference  of  4  points 
between  nitisinone  and  control,  in  both    cAKUSSI  and  mAKUSSI,  except  for  the  mAKUSSI  score  in 
patients <55 years, suggesting heterogeneity in the untreated and treated groups may have contributed 
to the lack of effect in the total population.  
The positive trend observed in favour of nitisinone on spinal pain was associated with a larger use of 
analgesic drugs in nitisinone compared to control (almost doubled in the nitisinone group).  
More  patients  treated  with  nitisinone  underwent  joint  replacement.  In  particular,  at  month  36,  13 
patients (18.8%) treated with nitisinone vs 7 (10.1%) untreated patients were submitted to this surgical 
procedure; the numbers increased to 17 patients (24.6%) vs 10 (14.5%) at month 48, for nitisinone 
and control, respectively. However, patients in the nitisinone group had more severe baseline conditions 
that could have increased the risk of joint replacement. 
Secondary outcomes related to the range of joint motion are conflicting and of difficult interpretation. At 
12 and 36 months, some joints showed a statistically significant difference that, however, disappears at 
other time points of the assessment (e.g. at 48 months). Moreover, for some joints (at some assessment 
times) the point estimate favours the untreated patients.  
Patient reported outcomes (SF-36 Health Survey) showed a trend in favour to nitisinone but, the strength 
of  evidence  is  very  limited  since  the  trial  was  not  blinded.  At  month  48,  none  of  the  domains  was 
statistically better in the nitisinone group, even those that were statistically significant at previous time 
points.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The most common TEAEs, in the AKU development program, were musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders (44.9% vs 34.8% in control), followed by infections (39.1% vs 15.9%), in particular in the 
respiratory  tract.  The  frequency  of  pneumonia  was  5.9%  in  nitisinone  vs  0  in  the  control  group;  the 
frequency  of  bronchitis  was  7.2%  in nitisinone  vs  1.4 %  in the  control  group.  SAE  of  infections  were 
observed in 4.4% of nitisinone treated patients vs 1.3% in the control group.  
 
The  third  most  frequent  TEAEs  were  eye  disorders,  markedly  more  frequent  in  the  nitisinone  group 
(36.2%) compared to control (11.6%). Eye disorders were also the most frequent cause of treatment 
discontinuation (8.7% of patients vs 0 in the control group). In particular, keratopathy was observed 
only in nitisinone treated patients (13%), and in the 7.2 % of cases led to treatment discontinuation. 
Furthermore,  levels  of  tyrosine  were  markedly  increased  in  AKU  patients  treated  with  nitisinone,  as 
expected. After 3 months the levels of tyrosine rose from a baseline value (umol/L) of 65.3 to 950.8.  
Skin disorders were also more frequently reported with nitisinone compared to untreated group, 21.7% 
vs 13.0%, respectively. 
The  total  frequency  of  SAEs  was  slightly  higher  in  the  nitisinone  group  compared  to  control  (39.1  vs 
37.7, respectively). The most common SAEs were musculoskeletal (26% vs 23.2% in control). SAEs of 
cardiac  disorders  (5.8%  vs  1.4%  in  control)  were  also  observed  more  frequently  with  nitisinone 
treatment.  
Dose  reduction  did  not  automatically  result  in  significant  decreases  in  elevated  tyrosine  levels,  which 
instead  are  increased  also  with  small  doses  of  1  mg/day;  whereas  dose  reduction  leads  to  relevant 
increases  in  u-HGA  24.  Moreover,  in  subjects  with  keratopathy  who  reduced  the  dose  to  2  mg/day, 
recurrence of the keratopathy was observed. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders are main manifestations of the underlying AKU disease. 
Thus, their higher prevalence in the nitisinone group (44.9% vs 34.8% control) may reflect the limited 
efficacy of treatment to control disease symptoms. 
Over the 4 annual site visits, leucocyte and neutrophil counts were not notably different in nitisinone-
treated compared to untreated patients, and there were no reports of leukopenia or neutropenia. The 
reason  for  the  observed  higher  frequency  of  infections,  particularly  pneumonia  and  bronchitis,  in  the 
AKU population compared to HT-1 population is at present unclear.  
There were 2 deaths in the nitisinone group and none in the untreated group, during the 4 years of the 
pivotal  study.  The  deaths  were  considered  not  related  to  nitisinone  treatment  by  the  investigator; 
however, for one of the reported death, the patient could have died by pneumonia and/or myocardial 
infarction.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
The ability of nitisinone to largely reduce u-HGA24 in AKU patients is demonstrated. The maintenance 
of this effect was observed over the whole duration of the study, ie 4 years of treatment. Whilst some 
observations could question the treatment effect, e.g physiological levels of u-HGA24 were very low  
and undetectable in  many subjects in the pivotal study, these levels were not reached in AKU patients 
treated with nitisinone group; about 32% of patients who met the u-HGA24 targeted level at month 32 
did not maintain it, after 4 years of treatment; the clinical relevance of these findings remain 
uncertain, especially since the u-HGA24 targeted level was set arbitrarily.   
Regarding clinical outcomes, although a statistically positive effect was observed on the secondary 
endpoint cAKUSSI score, results were driven by the eye pigmentation component, and the statistical 
significance was lost when this variable was excluded from the score, as reported in the mAKUSSI 
score. The lack of a statistically significant gain over untreated patients using mAKUSSI did not allow 
to extrapolate that the reduction in u-HGA24, and the reduced HGA precipitation in the eye may be 
considered a proxy for clinical benefit. However, the vast majority of the point estimates of the 
individual items (two third) included in the mAKUSSI score favoured nitisinone over untreated group. 
In particular, trend towards amelioration in osteopenia, and bone fractures are reported with nitisinone 
treatment. In 6 out of the 7 additional efficacy analyses using different definitions of responders and 
combining results on uHGA levels, mAKUSSI score, and eye pigmentation, a consistent trend in favour 
of the treated population compared to the untreated patients was observed. 
While these analyses are supportive of the correlation/consistency between effect on the primary 
endpoint and clinical outcomes, follow up time of 4 years could have been too short to detect changes 
in other disease manifestations to result in a statistically significant effect on mAKUSSI total score. 
Heterogeneity in treatment groups may also have contributed to the lack of statistical significance in 
the treatment effect on mAKUSSI total score in the total population. Moreover, from the baseline 
characteristics emerge that the nitisinone group was enriched with patients with more severe disease 
in some AKUSSI items.  
The safety profile of nitisinone in adult patients with AKU is considered sufficiently characterised, and 
overall similar to that already known for the HT-1 population. However, the frequency of several AEs, 
in particularly those related to tyrosine elevation appears increased, and moreover some new AEs were 
observed, including infections, particularly pneumonia and bronchitis. Serious cardiac disorders were 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
few but occurred 4 fold more frequently with nitisinone treatment compared to control and thus need 
to be closely monitored post-approval, for the AKU population, in the future PSURs.  
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Despite the pivotal study met its primary efficacy endpoint, the efficacy on long-term clinical outcomes 
is at present not completely elucidated. However, based on the observed consistency of treatment effect 
across disease manifestations and levels of uHGA in SONIA-2, the correlation between treatment effect 
on  the  primary  endpoint  and  clinical  benefit  is  demonstrated  for  Orfadin  in  the  AKU  population.  The 
safety profile of Orfadin in the AKU population is in general similar to that already known in the HT-1 
population, a few differences in frequency and new ADRs have been observed in the AKU population and 
are reported in the SmPC.

Not applicable 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Orfadin is positive.

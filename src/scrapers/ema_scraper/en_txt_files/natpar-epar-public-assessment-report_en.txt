2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Physiology of parathyroid hormone 
Parathyroid hormone is an 84-amino acid protein that is secreted by four parathyroid glands that lie 
behind each of the upper and lower poles of the thyroid gland. Each gland weighs approximately 30–50 
mg and is supplied by blood from the thyroid arteries which may be disrupted during thyroid surgery. 
Parathyroid hormone regulates bone metabolism and serum concentrations of calcium and phosphate. 
Changes in circulating Ca2+ concentrations are detected by the cells of the parathyroid glands and 
alter parathyroid hormone secretion via a negative feedback system. Under normal conditions, if the 
serum calcium concentration is low then the parathyroid glands increase secretion of parathyroid 
hormone and when the serum calcium concentration is high then secretion of parathyroid hormone is 
reduced. 
Parathyroid hormone stimulates 1-α-hydroxylase activity in the kidney that converts 25(OH) vitamin D 
into 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol): this active metabolite of vitamin D facilitates the absorption 
of calcium and phosphate from the intestine. Parathyroid hormone reduces calcium excretion and 
promotes phosphate excretion in the urine. 
Parathyroid hormone also has a role in maintaining the skeletal content of calcium mineral. 
Parathyroid hormone follows a bimodal diurnal pattern in the circulation. A primary peak occurs at 4am 
and a secondary peak occurs at 4pm. The primary and secondary nadirs take place at 10am and 9pm 
respectively (times are approximate). The underlying rhythm is endogenous. Life style factors and 
nutritional intake modulate the pattern of secretion. The diurnal variation of parathyroid hormone is 
shown in the following figure: 
Figure 1: 
Estimated population mean rhythm curves (±2 SD) for plasma PTH on baseline day. (Fuleihan GE et al. 
J Clin Endo Metab 1997; 82:281-6) 
The parathyroid hormone concentration recorded is dependent upon the assay used. Subjects with 
postmenopausal osteoporosis do not display the nocturnal increase in circulating parathyroid hormone. 
Serum [Ca++] does not display a diurnal variation.

Hypoparathyroidism 
Hypoparathyroidism is a rare endocrine deficiency that is characterized by absent or inappropriately 
low circulating PTH levels, secreted normally by the parathyroid glands. The most common aetiology is 
permanent damage / removal of parathyroid glands or their blood supply during neck surgery (70 % - 
80 %), for instance total thyroidectomy, but also thyroid resection for benign thyroid disease, 
parathyroidectomy for treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism, etc. Other causes include 
autoimmune conditions, congenital absence, genetic mutations, iron overload syndromes, radiation 
damage. 
The parathyroid glands sense the level of extracellular calcium at the surface of the parathyroid cell 
and adjust the synthesis and secretion of PTH accordingly. The relationship between ionized 
extracellular calcium and PTH secretion is a steep sigmoidal curve where small variations in calcium 
level lead to significant changes in PTH secretion. Calcium sensing is initiated by the binding of calcium 
to a calcium “sensing” receptor (CASR for calcium sensing receptor) that is present at high levels on 
the plasma membrane of the parathyroid cells. The CASR, a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor 
superfamily, is activated by calcium binding to it that, in turn, induces intracellular signals and, 
through largely unknown mechanisms, regulates the synthesis and secretion of PTH. The net 
physiological effects are an increase in circulating PTH levels when the extracellular calcium decreases 
and a decrease in PTH levels when the extracellular calcium increases. 
Clinical presentation and current management of hypoparathyroidism 
Hypoparathyroidism results in hypocalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia, while in the urine there is 
increased calcium excretion and decreased phosphate excretion. Serum magnesium concentration 
usually is not abnormal. Because CASR is widely distributed in the human body, a fluctuation in 
calcium may lead to multiple and very diverse symptoms, although these hypocalcaemia symptoms 
are generally reversible. The key symptoms involve the neuromuscular system: numbness: 
paraesthesias, twitching, tetany. Seizures, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, laryngeal spasm are 
more serious and potentially life-threatening effects, and difficulties in concentrating (“brain fog”) and 
effects on mood and ideation are also described. 
In the PARADOX study, a cross-sectional web-based observational study of 374 subjects with 
hypoparathyroidism [Hadker N, et al.. Endocr Pract. 2014;20(7):671-679; initiated by the applicant, 
the Hypoparathyroidism Association (USA) and the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, USA)], in which most 
patients (66.6%) took a combination of oral calcium and active vitamin D [Including some treated with 
PTH] respondents were asked about 38 symptoms that were physical, emotional or cognitive. 
Physical symptoms experienced by more than 50% of the respondents were: fatigue (82%); muscle 
pain or cramping (78%); paraesthesia (76%); tetany (70%); joint or bone pain (67%); and pain, 
heaviness, or weakness in extremities (53%).  
Emotional symptoms were anxiety, fear, or inner unrest (59%) and feeling sad, down, blue, or 
depressed (53%). 
Cognitive symptoms were brain fog or mental lethargy (72%), inability to focus or concentrate (65%), 
memory loss or forgetfulness (62%), and sleep disturbances (57%). 
Current management of hypoparathyroidism 
Current management of hypoparathyroidism consists of calcium (carbonate/citrate) and active vitamin 
D (calcitriol/alphacalcidol) in pharmacological doses sufficient to maintain serum calcium levels just 
below or at the low end of the normal range, to protect the kidneys from hypercalciuria and to prevent 
long-term damage from a high calcium-phosphate product. Risk of the use of large amounts of calcium 
and active vitamin D are nephrocalcinosis or nephrolithiasis, hyperphosphatemia, parenchymal renal 
Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017 
Page 11/110 
 
  
calcifications. Long-term this can lead to renal impairment (renal complications ranging from 15 to 
41% of patients studied).  Thiazide diuretics can be helpful, promoting renal calcium reabsorption. 
These thiazides have however their own adverse events including hypokalaemia, and have no proven 
long-term efficacy. Deposition of calcium-phosphate complexes in other organs or precipitation in soft 
tissues are also risks of the current management. The balance between too little and too much is the 
challenge. Too little would lead to hypocalcaemia (potentially life-threatening), too much could lead to 
symptomatic hypercalcaemia (also life-threatening). The required amounts vary widely across patients 
and there is even great intra-patient variability. Therefore, constant vigilance and monitoring is 
required. Some patients require magnesium supplementation and phosphate binders further increasing 
the pill burden. 
In the absence of PTH, bone is not renewed normally with a resultant gradually accrual of bone: 
leading to an increased bone mineral density (BMD), which is not a benefit because the bone is 
typically hypermature: greater cancellous bone volume, greater trabecular and cortical bone widths, 
reduced mineralizing surface and bone formation rate. Although this abnormal bone quality is not 
felt/visible by the patient, this makes the calcium stored in the bones (99% of the calcium content in 
the body) unavailable. Low endogenous levels of calcitriol leads to the disability to properly absorb 
dietary calcium/phosphate and associated impairment of vitamin D-dependent bone and renal 
regulatory mechanisms. 
In the PARADOX study, about 70% of the patients reported having suffered from other severe medical 
conditions directly related to their hypoparathyroidism, as shown in the following table: 
Table 1: Comorbid conditions experienced by hypoparathyroidism patients - paradox study. 
Other sources confirm morbidities associated with treated hypoparathyroidism. Published studies from 
the Danish National Patient Registry and prescription databases suggest that post-surgical subjects 
with hypoparathyroidism show an increased risk of infection, psychiatric illness, kidney stones and 
seizures [Underbjerg et al. J Bone Miner Res. 2013;28:2277-85; Underbjerg et al. J Bone Miner Res. 
2014;29:2504-10.]. 
Because hypoparathyroidism is more than hypocalcaemia alone and includes multiple organ and 
system abnormalities, it is not unexpected that the current disease management fails to manage 
comorbid conditions, since it does not address the root cause of hypoparathyroidism, namely lack of 
PTH. The maintenance of serum calcium levels that do not lead to hypocalcaemic symptoms requires 
patients to adhere to a strict routine of taking multiple pills to avoid an always possible “crash” into

severe hypocalcaemic symptoms that may limit their family, professional, and social lives. 
Hypoparathyroidism (even though treated with the optimum medical management) can be associated 
with on-going symptoms that impair the quality of life. It is acknowledged that there is an unmet 
clinical need for parathyroid hormone replacement therapy in subjects with hypoparathyroidism. 
About the product 
The active pharmaceutical ingredient, recombinant human parathyroid hormone (1-84) [rhPTH(1-84)], 
is identical to the full-length human 84-amino acid protein. In the application, rhPTH(1-84) is also 
referred to as NPSP558, and also as PTH(rDNA), PTH, PTH(1-84), hPTH, hPTH(1-84), rhPTH, rhPTH(1-
84), rPTH, and rPTH(1-84). rhPTH(1-84) was originally developed and authorised for the treatment of 
osteoporosis. The current development program is for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism . The 
product is referred to as NPSP558 in the 4 Efficacy and Safety Studies in Hypoparathyroidism. 
Natpar (parathyroid hormone [rDNA]) powder and solvent for solution for injection is supplied as a 
multiple dose, glass dual-chamber cartridge which is available in 4 nominal dosage strengths (25, 50, 
75, or 100 μg). Depending on the dosage strength, each medication cartridge contains 0.40, 0.80, 
1.21, or 1.61 mg rhPTH(1-84), 4.5 mg sodium chloride, 30 mg mannitol, and 1.26 mg citric acid 
monohydrate as a sterile lyophilized powder, with 1.13 mL of a sterile 3.2 mg/mL aqueous solution of 
m-cresol as the reconstitution diluent. Reconstitution results in a nominal solution concentration of 
0.35 mg/mL (25 μg/dose), 0.70 mg/mL (50 μg/dose), 1.05 mg/mL (75 μg/dose) or 1.40 mg/mL (100 
μg/dose). 
The applicant proposed, during the procedure, the use of the reusable Shire Q-Cliq Pen, referred to as 
the Natpar pen. This reusable pen customized for delivery of Natpar requires external reconstitution of 
the powder and solvent contained in the glass dual-chamber cartridge. For that purpose, the cartridge 
is designed to be used in conjunction with an ancillary mixing device, i.e. the Duoject mixing device. 
Since the pen injector is reusable (i.e. the cartridge in the cartridge holder inside the pen will be 
replaced when empty), the pen is not considered as an integral part of the medicinal product and as 
such is a medical device, requiring a CE certificate. Using the pen injector, each medication cartridge 
delivers 14 doses; each dose contains 25, 50, 75, or 100 μg of rhPTH(1-84) depending on the product 
dosage strength.  
Recombinant human PTH(1-84) is self-administered once daily by subcutaneous (SC) injection into 
alternating thighs. The recommended starting dose is 50 μg daily. Based on calcaemic response, 
rhPTH(1-84) can be titrated at approximately 2- to 4-week intervals upward to doses of 75 μg and 
then 100 μg daily. Downward titration to a minimum of 25 μg/day can occur at any time. In the case 
of a missed dose, the next dose should be administered as soon as reasonably feasible and additional 
exogenous calcium should be taken based on symptoms. Recombinant human PTH(1-84) should not be 
administered intravenously or intramuscularly. 
A replacement therapy with physiological levels of parathyroid hormone could be expected to 
normalise serum calcium and phosphate levels, while concomitantly controlling renal calcium and 
phosphate handling, supplying active vitamin D, restoring suppressed bone turnover to normal and 
improving abnormal bone structure. Unfavourable alterations in serum calcium-phosphate dynamics 
could be less pronounced and therefore the risk of soft tissue calcifications could be reduced. rhPTH(1-
84) treatment could mimic the physiological effect of the endogenous hormone, beyond regulation of 
serum calcium levels. 
Teriparatide [PTH(1-34)] has an identical sequence to the 34 N-terminal amino acids of the 84-amino 
acid human parathyroid hormone and is authorised in the EU since 2005 for the treatment of 
osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, in men at increased risk of fracture and in osteoporosis

associated with sustained glucocorticoid use in women and men. The use is limited to 24-months total 
exposure. Teriparatide is not approved for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism. 
Originally, rhPTH(1-84) was developed for the treatment of osteoporosis in post-menopausal women at 
a high risk of bone fracture. 
The Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for osteoporosis was submitted in the EU in 2005, and 
the product was authorised as Preotact in 2006. On request of the marketing authorisation holder, the 
marketing authorisation for this product was withdrawn in 2014. In parallel rhPTH(1-84) was 
developed for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism together with a new pen injector system. NPSP558 
was the chosen designation for rhPTH(1-84) to distinguish the development program for the treatment 
of hypoparathyroidism from the previous one in osteoporosis. The safety and efficacy studies in both 
osteoporosis and hypoparathyroidism used the same drug formulation. 
Orphan designation for recombinant human parathyroid hormone for the treatment of 
hypoparathyroidism was granted by the European Commission on 16 January 2014 (EU/3/13/1210). 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The active substance contained in Natpar is a non-glycosylated recombinant human parathyroid 
hormone (PTH) produced in E. coli and consisting of 84 amino acids (rhPTH(1-84)). The protein is 
analogous to the full-length PTH naturally produced by the parathyroid glands. PTH is a major 
regulator of calcium in the body and acts to increase the concentration of calcium in the blood.  
The finished product Natpar is a powder and solvent for solution for injection in a cartridge. The 
lyophilised powder contains rhPTH, sodium chloride, mannitol, citric acid monohydrate and sodium 
hydroxide. The solvent (i.e. solvent for reconstitution) contains m-cresol in water for injections. The 
finished product is provided in 4 different strengths, i.e. 25 µg/dose, 50 µg/dose, 75 µg/dose and 100 
µg/dose, filled in multiple dose glass dual-chamber cartridges. The cartridges inside their cartridge 
holders are to be used with a mixing device for reconstitution and a reusable pen-injector (i.e. the 
Natpar pen) as delivery system. Each cartridge contains 14 doses to be injected subcutaneously. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
The active substance is a single-chain protein containing 84 amino acid residues with a sequence that 
is identical to the native human parathyroid hormone (PTH). There are no disulfide bonds, no 
glycosylation sites and no post-translational modifications. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Manufacturing process  
Recombinant human parathyroid hormone is produced by recombinant DNA technology in E. coli as a 
fusion protein containing the ompA leader sequence and the full sequence of PTH. The manufacturing 
process of the active substance comprises steps in which the protein is expressed in E. coli bacteria 
(fermentation), recovered and purified (several chromatographic steps and filtration/filling) and 
storedBased on the currently available information the manufacturing process of the rhPTH(1-84) 
active substance at the proposed Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) RCV GmbH & Co KG manufacturing site is 
Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017 
Page 14/110 
 
  
 
sufficiently defined and controlled. The purification process shows a good consistency in the elimination 
of both process-related and product-related impurities. Critical manufacturing process steps have been 
defined and in-process controls are in place throughout the process. The complete control strategy 
including all process parameters and in-process controls and accompanying details has been provided. 
Hold time periods for the intermediates during purification have been investigated.The starting 
materials used for production of rhPTH(1-84) have been well described and tests have been 
implemented to ensure the microbial safety throughout the production process. A two-tier cell banking 
system is used and the generation of the initial construct and the master cell bank (MCB) and working 
cell bank (WCB) have been described in detail.  
Process validation 
Validation encompassed the fermentation, recovery and downstream process. The prospective process 
validation of rhPTH(1-84) production process was performed.Validation data demonstrate that 
rhPTH(1-84) active substance produced according to the parameters described in the batch production 
records meets all predetermined quality attributes and specifications. 
Manufacturing process development 
Adequate comparability studies have been performed to bridge the manufacturing process changes 
made throughout development of the product. 
Characterisation 
The active substance rhPTH(1-84) has been characterised using a variety of test methods. These 
methods investigated the size, charge, primary, secondary and tertiary structure, aggregative 
properties, purity and biological activity of the protein. 
Specification 
The proposed active substance release specification covers identity, purity, potency and other general 
tests. The current reference standard has been well-characterised and is acceptable.  
Stability 
Long-term stability results show a good stability profile for the active substance under the proposed 
storage conditions. The claimed shelf life period at the recommended storage conditions. The stability 
commitment complies with the regulatory requirements and is acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development 
The finished product Natpar is a powder and solvent for solution for injection in a cartridge. The 
finished product is supplied as a multiple dose dual-chamber cartridge inside a cartridge holder. One 
chamber (“Chamber 1”) contains the sterile lyophilised powder and the other chamber (“Chamber 2”) 
contains the sterile solvent for reconstitution. The lyophilised powder contains rhPTH, sodium chloride, 
mannitol, citric acid monohydrate and sodium hydroxide and the solvent for reconstitution contains m-
cresol in water for injections. The dual-chamber cartridge is provided in four different nominal dosage 
strengths (i.e. 25 µg/dose, 50 µg/dose, 75 µg/dose and 100 µg/dose) that differ only in the 
concentration of the active substance.  
The dual-chamber cartridge inside the cartridge holder is made from type I glass with 2 bromobutyl 
rubber stoppers and a crimp cap (aluminium) with a bromobutyl rubber seal. 
Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017

The dual-chamber cartridge inside the cartridge holder is designed for use with a mixing device for 
reconstitution and a reusable pen injector, i.e. the Natpar pen, for delivery of a targeted fixed-dose 
volume of 71.4 µl. Each cartridge contains 14 doses to be injected subcutaneously. 
The composition of Natpar finished product is presented in Tables below.

Composition of Natpar finished product (after reconstitution) 
The manufacturing process development for the Natpar finished product is well described. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process of the Natpar finished product is sufficiently described. No novel excipients 
have been proposed and the rationale provided for the use of excipients is considered acceptable.  
Product specification 
The specifications established for the finished product are acceptable. The proposed finished product 
release specification tests cover identity, purity, potency and other general tests.  
Stability of the product 
A shelf life of 36 months at 2°C to 8°C is proposed and supported by sufficient real-time stability data 
for all four product strengths. On the basis of totality of the data and justification provided by the 
Applicant, an in-use shelf life of 14 days after reconstitution is considered acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
The risk of potential contamination with adventitious agents in the finished product is negligible. There 
is no significant risk of contamination with adventitious agents such as mammalian viruses or 
Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017 
Page 17/110 
 
  
 
 
 
mycoplasma. Therefore, viral clearance studies have not been performed, which is acceptable since no 
human or animal cell lines are used. Taking into account the nature of the product, sufficient 
information is presented with regard to the risk management for potential contamination with 
adventitious agents in terms of control of materials, control of production process, certification of 
materials of animal origin and testing of active substance and finished product. These controls ensure 
that the product does not contain adventitious agents. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
It should be noted that the Applicant has proposed the reusable Shire Q-Cliq pen (i.e. the Natpar 
pen)for product administration. The Natpar pen is designed to be used in conjunction with an ancillary 
mixing device, i.e. the Duoject mixing device. The Duoject mixing device was CE marked at the time of 
submission, whereas the Natpar pen was not. The Shire Q-Cliq pen and the medicinal product do not 
form a single integral product as defined in the Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC as amended. As a 
consequence, the Applicant was asked to provide proof of CE marking to support the use of the 
proposed Shire Q-Cliq pen. This issue was raised as a Major Objection due to the legal obligation under 
Directive 2001/83/EC to provide such evidence before adoption of a CHMP Opinion for this marketing 
authorisation application. With their response, the Applicant submitted the corresponding CE certificate 
issued by the Notified Body and the Declaration of Conformity. Therefore the issue was considered 
resolved. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Overall, the quality of Natpar is considered to be in line with the quality of other approved recombinant 
DNA products. The different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological documentation 
comply with existing guidelines. The fermentation and purification of the active substance are 
adequately described, controlled and validated. The active substance is well characterised with regard 
to its physicochemical and biological characteristics, using state-of-the-art methods, and appropriate 
specifications are set. The manufacturing process of the finished product has been satisfactorily 
described and validated. The quality of the finished product is controlled by adequate test methods and 
specifications. 
Viral safety and the safety concerning other adventitious agents including TSE have been sufficiently 
assured. 
The overall quality of Natpar is considered acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommended several points for investigation.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Non-clinical data for this application was in part derived from previous studies undertaken for the 
approval of rhPTH(1-84) for the treatment of osteoporosis (Preotact; approved in the EU in 2006 and 
withdrawn in 2014). 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
The Applicant performed different studies to evaluate whether treatment with rhPTH(1-84) induces 
effects similar to endogenous PTH, being involvement in (1) calcium homeostasis (2) phosphate 
homeostasis and (3) bone formation. The focus of the pivotal rat and monkey studies has been the 
effect of rhPTH(1-84) on bone formation in models for osteoporosis, obtained by ovariectomy (OVX). 
Besides, these monkey studies show that transient increases of serum calcium are obtained after daily 
administration of rhPTH(1-84), returning to baseline levels within 24h. Thus, pre-dose calcium levels 
remained stable during the course of the study. For serum phosphate no transient effect of treatment 
could be seen in the hours after administration of rhPTH(1-84), but at long term a decrease of pre-
dose levels was observed. The levels of active vitamin D were increased, as could be expected. The 
acute and/or chronic effects of rhPTH(1-84) on calcium, phosphate and vitamin D metabolism were 
also studied in the OVX rat model, but only increases in active vitamin D were observed. The absence 
of influence on serum calcium levels could be due to the role of calcitonin as a potent anticalcaemic 
hormone in rats, but not in humans or monkeys.  
The Applicant refers to the literature for studies using hypocalcaemic parathyroidectomized and 
thyroparathyroidectomized rats. Several publications show that treatment with rhPTH(1-84) increases 
serum calcium levels and urine phosphate levels in these animals shortly after administration, but no 
long-term data are available. 
In normal male and female cynomolgus monkeys, transient increases in serum calcium levels were 
observed while no long-term effect could be detected. Conversely, no transient serum phosphate level 
changes were detected while pre-dose levels decreased after long-term treatment.  
In OVX rats, treatment with rhPTH(1-84) resulted in a dose-related gain in bone mass at trabecular 
and cortical bone sites, associated with increased bone strength. In monkeys, treatment increases 
bone mineral density (BMD) and strength at trabecular bone sites. Increased bone remodelling was 
also found at cortical bone sites, but this was associated with decreased BMD and strength. 
Dose ranges from 1.5 to 30 µg/kg BW were administered in monkeys in the pharmacology studies, 
with corresponding exposures ranging from 0.2 to 21 ng.hr/mL, covering the human exposure at the 
maximum recommended dose (100µg/day; or on average 1.66 µg/kg/day).  
In conclusion, the nonclinical pharmacology studies in rats and monkeys were originally intended to 
support the use of rhPTH(1-84) in treating postmenopausal osteoporosis and predominantly 
investigated the effects of the compound on bone. For this current therapeutic indication they are 
considered to be secondary pharmacodynamics. No studies dedicated to evaluating the primary PD 
effects for the current indication have been conducted. The proposed use of Natpar is supported by 
published literature demonstrating increased serum calcium levels following administration of rhPTH(1-
84) in hypocalcaemic animal models. There were no signs of significant tachyphylaxis and 
desensitisation in long term studies up to 16 months in animals with normal parathyroid function. For 
Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017 
Page 19/110 
 
  
bone markers, long term human data from patients with hypoparathyroidism are very limited. Changes 
in bone function and structure could be expected. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety pharmacology studies primarily evaluated cardiovascular effects. The uncertainty about the 
doses administered in the otherwise GLP compliant in vitro assays for the evaluation of QT-
prolongation (hERG - canine cardiac Purkinje fibres) hampers correct interpretation of the negative 
results of rhPTH(1-84) in these assays. However, the maximal nominal concentration of 300 ng/ml still 
largely exceeds the human CMAX after dose correction. Therefore, no additional experiments are 
required.  
Two in vivo studies in rat and dog revealed mean arterial blood pressure reduction in rats and no 
effects in the dog at doses exceeding the intended clinical dose.  
Also, no adverse effects on the central nervous system were detected in a functional observation 
battery conducted in rats, resulting in a exposure-based safety margin of 18-24. Acute effects on the 
respiratory system were not tested. Given the absence of evidence for adverse effects on the 
respiratory system in clinical tests performed by the Applicant, no further non-clinical experiments 
were considered to be required, consistent with the assessment of the safety pharmacology data for 
the previous approval of Preotact. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption was evaluated in rats, rabbits, dogs and monkeys in several single dose studies and in the 
course of the repeated-dose toxicity studies. Absorption after subcutaneous administration was rapid in 
rats (2-20 min) and monkeys (20-60 min), and the rate of absorption was independent of gender, 
dose or treatment duration. For both single and repeated doses, peak plasma concentrations and 
exposure were linearly related to dose, except in monkeys at 25 µg/kg on. In monkeys, single dose 
exposure was predictive for multiple dose exposure, while in the rat exposure increased during the first 
weeks of daily treatment. Absolute bioavailability after subcutaneous administration was calculated to 
be 46% in rats and 39.5% in monkeys, comparable to humans (53%).  
Apart from the lacteal excretion study, no conventional distribution studies were conducted. Based on 
the results of this rat study, the possibility of minimal maternal transfer of rhPTH(1-84) through the 
milk to offspring cannot be excluded. The volume of distribution is comparable to blood volume in rats, 
and radio-labelled PTH was shown to be rapidly and widely distributed. 
PTH(1-84) is rapidly cleared from plasma in the liver by nonspecific peptidases as its primary clearance 
pathway and to a lesser extent in the kidney. Excretion studies were not performed. The Applicant 
refers to literature for identification of major route of elimination, i.e. urinary excretion. 
A concern was raised about potential effects on PK and PD of proteinacious particles in the finished 
product over the 14-day in-use shelf life after reconstitution of Natpar. In a rabbit PK and PD study, 
dose solutions prepared using reconstituted cartridges having appearance category B or C did affect 
the pharmacokinetics of the drug in the rabbit while those of category 0 and A have comparable PK 
profiles. The pharmacodynamics of the drug also appeared to be altered by batch appearance 
category.

EMA/180882/2017 
Page 20/110 
 
  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Repeated-dose toxicity studies were conducted in rats (up to 26 weeks), dogs (up to 4 weeks) and 
Cynomolgus monkeys (up to 26 weeks). Due to sensitivity to rhPTH(1-84)-induced hypercalcaemia, 
the dog was not considered an appropriate animal model and was replaced by the non-human primate. 
The most significant target organ in all species was the kidney, characterized by varying degrees of 
tubular dilation, regeneration and mineralization, which was due to the elevation in serum calcium 
associated with the pharmacological action of PTH. Male rats appeared to be more sensitive than 
females (9 deaths compared to 1 death or moribund sacrifices in the high dose group (n=30/sex)), a 
finding also observed in the carcinogenicity study. As in contrast to the previously authorized 
indication, Natpar is intended for use in both sexes, concern was raised about the clinical relevance of 
this apparent gender-based difference in sensitivity. In both non-clinical studies, total systemic 
exposure is slightly lower in female compared to male rats. Human data with respect to gender effects 
on PK, efficacy and safety are limited, but no gender difference in exposure of patients was observed 
so far.  Increased toxicity observed in male rats might be explained by a gender-based difference in 
exposure which is not observed in patients, and might therefore be of no clinical relevance. 
In contrast to the rat, with a NOAEL of 8.11 µg/kg/day and an animal to human margin of exposure of 
8.8, kidney-related abnormalities were detected at levels comparable to the clinical exposure levels in 
the pivotal monkey repeat-dose toxicity study. Nephrotoxicity is added as a potential risk in the Risk 
Management Plan. 
rhPTH(1-84) tested negative for in vitro mutagenic potential in two assays (bacteria and mammalian 
cells). In a two-year carcinogenicity study in rats, dose-dependent increases in bone tumors including 
osteosarcoma were observed in males and females. Osteosclerosis was observed in the 26 week repeat 
dose toxicity study in rats, suggesting that the observed lesions in the carcinogenicity study result 
from the long duration of treatment and the exaggerated pharmacologic response of the rat skeleton 
to daily treatment with PTH(1-84). Rat-to-human safety margin based on exposure are 4.8 and 3.3 in 
male and female respectively. Bone tumors were detected at 26- and 18-fold (male/female) human 
exposure at the maximum recommended dose. Although a growing body of evidence may be in favour 
of considering the observed increased risk for osteosarcoma or other bone neoplasms in rats, 
continued follow-up is recommended (See also Risk Management Plan and Clinical objections). 
Differences in rat and human bone metabolism may explain the difference in carcinogenic potential in 
these species. In contrast to humans, the ever growing rat skeleton may be considered to be a 
developing organ harboring immature and potentially tumorigenic cells that may respond to PTH with 
uncontrolled behavioral growth. Therefore, this concern remains for children as PTH treatment may 
have a different impact in developing bone compared to adult bone. In the agreed paediatric 
investigatiol plan, a juvenile study to address this question is planned. 
For evaluation of reproductive and developmental toxicity, conventional studies on fertility and early 
embryonic development (rat), embryofoetal development (rat and rabbit), and pre- and postnatal 
development (rats) were performed. A common finding in parental animals was a transient decrease in 
body weight gain, an observation not identified in repeat-dose toxicity studies. In the FEED rat study, 
small but significant differences compared to controls were observed in females (reduced number of 
corpora lutea, implantation sites and live foetuses, increase in gestation duration) and males (reduced 
prostate and cauda epididymis weights). Reproductive toxicity was also described for rhPTH1-34 
(Forsteo), where embryotoxicity (fetal resorption and reduced litter size) occurred in pregnant rabbits 
administered daily doses of 3 to 100 µg/kg.   
The observed foetal effects in rats and rabbits are limited to skeletal variations (reduced number of 
ossified phalanges in the hindlimb (rat), and incompletely ossified sternal centra, increased number of 
ossified thoracic vertebrae and ribs, and decreased number of ossified lumbar vertebrae (rabbit). This 
Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017 
Page 21/110 
 
  
could be ascribed to growth retardation induced by maternal toxicity, or to a pharmacological effect. In 
a peri-/post-natal development study in pregnant rats, male pups given subcutaneous doses of 1000 
μg/kg/day showed mild dehydration.  
The minor effects observed in the fertility study in rats and in the embryofoetal development studies in 
rats and rabbits are within historical control data ranges or can be attributed to maternal and paternal 
toxicity. The observed maternal and paternal toxicity was transient in these studies. No direct effects 
of rhPTH(1-84) were observed on reproduction and development. The mild dehydration observed in 
the pre-and postnatal study in rats at the high dose (1000µg/kg/d) is considered of no clinical 
relevance due to the high exposure margin (123-fold therapeutic dose).  
A conventional local tolerance study revealed no rhPTH(1-84)-specific effects after single dose 
administration by intravenous, perivenous or intra-arterial route. Repeated-dose toxicity studies 
revealed dose-related changes at injection sites (haemorrhage and fibrosis) suggesting that the 
rhPTH(1-84) solution was mildly inflammatory. 
Repeated administration of rhPTH(1-84) in rats and dogs can elicit weak immune responses, but the 
frequency of antibody formation is low and had little or no effect on the biological activity of PTH. In 
monkeys, an isolated immune response was detected. Overall, these responses do not compromise the 
interpretation of non-clinical studies. 
Several impurities identified in the drug substance and product exceed the threshold for qualification 
according to ICH guideline Q3A/B. The proposed release specifications for PTH(1-80) + 
PTH(deaminated), Met8[ox]PTH and Met18[ox]PTH are 1, 1 and 1.5 % respectively.  For five of the 
toxicology studies, impurity profiles of drug substance/product have been determined, and a sufficient 
margin of exposure (animal to human; dose-based) was observed in these repeated-dose and 
reproductive toxicity studies, both for the tested batches as for the proposed release specifications for 
the finished product. No genotoxicity study was performed but it is considered unnecessary to conduct 
further nonclinical studies in support of the qualification of these impurities. 
rhPTH(1-84) is non-haemolytic in human whole blood, and compatible with human serum and plasma. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Natpar is a protein and has an identical in structure to the endogenous human 84-amino-acid 
hormone. It is therefore exempted from the need to provide an environmental risk assessment as this 
naturally occurring hormone is unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment.  
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical pharmacology studies in rats and monkeys were originally intended to support the use 
of rhPTH(1-84) in treating postmenopausal osteoporosis and predominantly investigated the effects of 
the compound on bone. For this current therapeutic indication they are considered to be secondary 
pharmacodynamics. No studies dedicated to evaluating the primary PD effects for the current 
indication have been conducted. but the intended use is a hormone replacement therapy. Furthermore, 
the proposed use of Natpar is supported by published literature demonstrating increased serum 
calcium levels following administration of rhPTH(1-84) in hypocalcaemic animal models. There were no 
signs of significant tachyphylaxis and desensitisation in long term studies up to 16 months in animals 
with normal parathyroid function. For bone markers, long term human data from patients with 
hypoparathyroidism are very limited. Changes in bone function and structure could be expected. The 
pharmacokinetics of rhPTH(1-84) have been demonstrated to be linear except at the high doses used 
in toxicology studies. In all species tested (rat, dog, rabbit, monkey), rhPTH(1-84) exhibited rapid 
Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017 
Page 22/110 
 
  
absorption following subcutaneous administration, a distribution volume that approximated blood 
volume, and rapid elimination from the systemic circulation. The toxicology programme consisted of 
the investigation of single-dose toxicity, repeated-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, a 
complete assessment of reproductive and developmental toxicity, local tolerance and antigenicity. The 
species used were mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, and monkeys. Since the intended clinical route of 
administration in the clinic is SC injection, the majority of the studies were performed using that route. 
Initially, the dog was chosen as the non-rodent species for the toxicology programme. However, the 
dog was shown to be overly sensitive to the calcaemic effects of rhPTH(1-84) which resulted in 
pronounced adverse effects on the kidney. The non-rodent species was changed to the non-human 
primate. Repeated-dose toxicity studies conducted in rats (up to 26 weeks), dogs (up to 4 weeks) and 
Cynomolgus monkeys (up to 26 weeks) showed that the kidney was the most significant target organ 
in all test species. In monkeys, kidney-related abnormalities were detected at levels comparable to the 
clinical exposure levels, which is reflected in the SmPC. Nephrotoxicity is also added as a potential risk 
in the Risk Management Plan. A 2-year rat carcinogenicity study showed a dose-related increase in 
bone tumors including osteosarcoma. Although a growing body of evidence seems to indicate the 
observed increased risk for osteosarcoma to be of little clinical relevance (see clinical section of this 
report). The negative results in the in vitro genotoxicity studies and the results from the 2-year 
carcinogenicity study indicate that rhPTH(1-84) is a non-genotoxic carcinogen. In the carcinogenicity 
study and the rat repeated-dose toxicity study, males appeared to be more sensitive than females. 
This could be explained by the increased exposure in males, a finding that is not confirmed in patients. 
The effects on reproduction and embryofoetal development are minor. Those observed in the fertility 
study in rats and the embryofoetal development studies in rats and rabbits are within historical control 
data ranges or can be attributed to maternal and paternal toxicity, which was transient in these 
studies. Mild dehydration observed in the pre-and postnatal study in rats at the high dose 
(1000µg/kg/d) is considered of no clinical relevance due to the high exposure margin (123-fold 
therapeutic dose). 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Considering the absence of clinical relevance of the observed toxicities in non-clinical studies, and 
considering that limited dedicated pharmacodynamics studies are acceptable in view of (1) available 
nonclinical data in osteoporosis models, (2) published literature on hypocalcaemic animal models and 
(3) clinical data, the nonclinical testing program is considered adequate to support the safe use of 
Natpar in human subjects. 
2.4.   Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the European 
Union were carried out in accordance with the ethical requirements of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
The rhPTH(1-84) clinical development program includes 13 clinical pharmacology studies, 4 efficacy 
and safety studies in hypoparathyroidism, and a supporting development program consisting of 7 
osteoporosis studies.  
Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017 
Page 23/110 
 
  
5 studies are conducted in hypoparathyroidism subjects (4 efficacy and safety studies, 1 clinical 
pharmacology study). Among these studies, the pivotal study, CL1-11-040 was randomized, double-
blind, and placebo-controlled. It provided robust, statistically significant differences in efficacy between 
rhPTH(1-84) and placebo and is the primary registration study. 
In addition to the 4 efficacy and safety studies in the clinical development program, 1 investigator-
initiated trials (IITs) was reported studying the use of rhPTH(1-84) in subjects with 
hypoparathyroidism. This study was conducted in Denmark by Dr. Leif Mosekilde with a total of 62 
subjects. NPS has obtained a right of reference only to the Mosekilde pharmacokinetic 
(PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) substudy.  
The clinical development program also included a total of 13 clinical pharmacology studies: 7 
comparative bioavailability and bioequivalence studies (PAR-C10-005, PAR-C13-004, CL1-11-007, CL1-
11-012, CL1-11-013, CL1-11-017, and SH-PTH-0001), 2 healthy subject PK and initial tolerability 
studies (PBR930811 and PBR930812), 2 patient PK and initial tolerability studies in subjects with 
hypoparathyroidism (C09-002 and the Mosekilde PK/PD substudy), and 2 intrinsic-factor PK studies in 
subjects with hepatic (CL1-11-009) and renal impairment (CL1-11-010). 
In addition to the efficacy and safety studies in hypoparathyroidism and the clinical pharmacology 
studies, the safety of rhPTH(1-84) for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism is supported by nonclinical 
safety data, the premarketing and postmarketing safety data on the use of rhPTH(1-84) in patients 
with osteoporosis, and the results of a literature search pertaining to the safety of rhPTH(1-84) and the 
use of PTH(1-34).

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination 
In single- and multiple-dose studies in subjects with normal parathyroid function and in subjects with 
hypoparathyroidism, the plasma PTH(1-84) concentration-time profile seen after SC injection of 
rhPTH(1-84) into either thigh or abdomen was typically characterized by 2 peaks. An initial peak was 
achieved by roughly 5 to 15 minutes after dosing. A second peak, representing a slower rate of uptake 
from the injection site, occurred between 1 and 2 hours after dosing. PTH(1-84) levels declined 
gradually from the second peak and returned to predose levels at 12 to 24 hours. The mechanism(s) 
responsible for this double-peak plasma PTH(1-84) profile are poorly understood. Schwietert et al. 
believed that this double-peak profile in the serum PTH (1-84) concentrations probably indicates that 
the exogenously administered rhPTH (1-84) is released from the subcutaneous injection site into the 
systemic circulation at different rates. The PK of PTH(1-84) following SC administration of rhPTH(1-84) 
in the thigh was similar in normal subjects, in postmenopausal women with or without osteoporosis 
and in subjects with hypoparathyroidism. 
The mean absolute bioavailability of PTH after subcutaneous administration of 100 µg PTH in the 
abdomen of healthy postmenopausal women was determined to be 55% (range 36% to 92%). Since 
PTH is known to be rapidly hydrolysed by non-specific peptidases in the liver the possibility exists that 
pre-systemic metabolism may also occur at the injection site. 
The bioavailability of PTH is dependent of the site of injection. Injection into the thigh of subjects with 
normal parathyroid function results in a slower rate of absorption and a slower rate of decrease from 
the peak with a delayed return to pre-dose levels compared to injection in the abdomen. Similar 
overall exposure are obtained in both situations. The Cmax after administration in the abdomen is 2-
fold the Cmax observed after administration in the thigh. Since the response is dependent on a 
threshold in PTH concentration and the duration of PTH levels above this threshold and not direct 
proportional to the PTH concentration, the choice of the subcutaneous injection in the thigh (once a 
day in alternating thighs) is supported. These results are in accordance with the POP PK results where 
PTH(1-84) clearance is associated with injection site. 
Overall bioavailability of PTH(1-84) was higher with SC injection compared to intra-dermal injections, 
increasing with increasing depth of injection. There was an inverse relationship between the depth of 
injection and the calcaemic response, with the highest change in calcium occurring with SC injection. 
Thus, SC injection is the preferred route in the treatment of hypoparathyroidism with rhPTH(1-84). 
Five different pens have been used throughout the clinical development for PTH. It is recognized that a 
different bioavailability can be observed depending on the type of pen used for administration. The 
Applicant provided the results of two bioequivalence studies: one between the Ypsomed pen and the 
Haselmeier pen and one between the Ypsomed pen and the SHL pen. Whereas the first study 
successfully demonstrated bioequivalence, the second one failed to show this. According to the 
Applicant this was due to two outliers, demonstrating an AUC value of 1.74 and 1.58% of the reference 
medicinal products geometric mean AUC. As per bioequivalence guideline, reassessment of 
bioequivalence was performed after removal of these subjects. This resulted in point estimates (90% 
CI) of 112.94 (98.83-129.06) and 110.97 (97.02-126.92) for AUC and Cmax, respectively. This means 
that the exposure to PTH(1-84) with the SHL pen is not ~30%, but rather ~13% higher than the 
Ypsomed pen used during the clinical development program. In a subsequent step, the Applicant 
proposed to take into account the actual administered dose during the BE study. These doses have 
been recorded in accordance with the protocol of Study PAR-C13-004, where the following has been 
written: ‘Based on pen and cartridge weight changes from before to after injection administration, the 
Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017 
Page 30/110 
 
  
 
study pharmacist or designee confirmed that the appropriate dose amount was given. Expected weight 
changes were provided by the sponsor.’  Analysis of these results revealed that the in vivo 
administration of PTH(1-84) with the Ypsomed and SHL pens is characterized by an unacceptable high 
variability, presumably resulting even in an (almost) void injection. This has been demonstrated in 
different clinical studies with rhPTH(1-84) (studies CL1-11-007, CL1-11-009, CL1-11-010, PAR-C13-
004, C09-002 and PAR-C10-007), in which no or only marginally increased plasma PTH(1-84) 
concentrations have been observed for some of the subjects. Further, the Applicant stated that ‘lack of 
systemic absorption has not been observed with the use of Haselmeier or SHL pens’. Although it is 
agreed that none of the subjects did fulfil the criterion of a AUC < 5% of the reference medicinal 
product geometric mean AUC, it is noted that this is only borderline for one of the subjects after 
injection with the SHL pen (AUC = 5.6%) and that, overall, only 55 subjects have been treated with a 
single administrations. Therefore, data obtained with the SHL pen are too scarce to make a sufficiently 
substantiated conclusion. The Applicant subsequently decided not to use the SHL pen for 
commercialisation but instead to propose the Haselmeier pen. This pen (i.e. the Natpar pen; also 
referred to as Shire Q-Cliq pen is to be used in combination with the Duoject Mixing device (see also 
the Quality section of this report). Also for this pen, pen weights before and after administration have 
been recorded. These revealed that also for the Haselmeier pen a substantial variability in 
administered dose has been recorded, with administered doses ranging from 50.01 to 93.41 mg and 
with > 10% of subjects having a dose deviating > 20% from the target dose. However, if the same 
Haselmeier pen will be used during the studies that will be done as post authorisation measures, the 
same variability will also be introduced in the results of these studies and as such, it will be accounted 
for. In addition, it should be noted that US post-marketing data concerning this product delivered with 
the Haselmeier pen are available (see the Safety section of this report). Therefore, the issue associated 
with the variability observed with the Haselmeier pen (i.e. the Natpar pen proposed for 
commercialisation) was considered to be sufficiently considered for the benefit risk profile of this 
product. 
The product being administered as subcutaneous injection, data on influence of food are not relevant.  
The results of the data obtained after iv administration indicate that PTH is only marginally distributed 
outside of the plasma water. According to the Applicant, the pharmacokinetics after iv administration 
are described by a 2-compartment model characterized by a rapid distribution phase with a half-life of 
several minutes and an elimination phase with a longer half-life of approximately 0.5 hours, whereas 
the subcutaneous administration of PTH can be described by a one-compartment model with first order 
absorption and elimination.  
No specific metabolism studies in humans have been performed with PTH. Literature data indicates 
that Kupffer cells in the liver take up and degrade about 70% of the circulating PTH into C-terminal 
fragments that are then released back into the systemic circulation. The proximal kidney metabolizes 
another 20% of circulating PTH arriving from the glomerular filtrate and by peritubular absorption and, 
like the liver, returns C-terminal fragments to the systemic circulation. Thus, both the parathyroid 
glands and peripheral metabolism contribute to circulating levels of C-terminal fragments. N-terminal 
PTH fragments, such as those being analogue to teriparatide (PTH(1-34)), are neither secreted by the 
parathyroid glands nor released into the circulation following peripheral metabolism of PTH.  Because 
of this, the total quantity of C-terminal fragments in the circulation is often higher than that of full 
length PTH and can greatly exceed native hormone levels when renal function is impaired, as in severe 
chronic renal failure. 
The C-terminal fragments have been untill recently regarded as inert byproducts of PTH metabolism, 
since they do not interact with the PTH/PTH-related peptide (PTHrP) receptor, which mediates the 
classical hormone actions. Current findings instead indicate that C-PTH would interact with a putative 
C-PTH receptor (Scillitani et al., J Endocrinol Invest 2011; 34: 23-26). This way, C-PTH seems to exert 
Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017 
Page 31/110 
 
  
specific effects on calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism, opposite to those of the synthetic 
agonist of PTH/PTHrP receptor (i.e. PTH 1-34). In vitro and in vivo data indicate that C-PTH, by 
interacting with specific receptors, could have an anti-calcaemic action, as well as a pro-apoptotic 
effect on both osteocytes and osteoclasts. This in turn could result in a reduced activity of the latter 
cells, with a consequent inhibition of bone resorption. It is, however, agreed with the Applicant that a 
C-PTH receptor has never been confirmed and that the potency and/or concentration of these 
fragments appears not to be sufficiently high to affect calcium and bone metabolism in patients with 
hypoparathyroidism who are treated with rhPTH(1-84). In addition, since PTH(1-84) levels return to 
baseline levels by approximately 12 hours post injection, it is unlikely that the C-terminal PTH 
fragments derived from the exogenously administered would remain in the circulation at 24 hours after 
the injection. Therefore, no chronic accumulation of C-terminal PTH fragments is anticipated. 
The question did arise whether data could be provided  in hypoparathyroidism subjects to ascertain 
serum calcium and C-terminal PTH fragments over 24 hours post administration of rhPTH(1-84) Lack 
of such data added to concerns on the short-term and long-term clinical safety consequences of wide 
fluctuations in serum [Ca++] over 24 hours after each administration of study drug (see Safety section 
of this report).  
Concerning dose-linearity over the exposure range, it is considered that the results of studies PBR-
930811,PBR-930812 and C09-002 do not support a claim for linear dose proportionality across the full 
range of doses studied. The observed curvilinear relationship between dose and both AUC and Cmax, 
suggests that the bioequivalence studies should be performed using a low dose of study drug as this 
represents the most sensitive-to-difference region of the graphical relationships. The applicant 
proposed that the apparent non-linearity is due to a higher contribution of endogenous PTH at the 
lower doses and with a calculation to subtract endogenous concentrations the adjusted AUC’s are with 
the linearity requirements for 25- 100 µg. This explanation appears reasonable. Data for lower doses 
shows some non-linearity below 1 µg/ml however this may be due to poor definition of the PK profile, 
in addition it is highlighted that an alternative assay methodology was used. 
Population PK  
Population PK and PK/PD analysis results were submitted. However, additional data, analyses and 
discussion are expected to ensure that the optimal dose is eventually used in patients. The applicant 
acknowledged the value of a more mechanistic PK/PD model to characterise the exposure-response 
relationship over the empirical approach used in their original modelling. Given the complex 
interrelationship between PTH, serum calcium and 24 hour urinary calcium excretion, the empirical 
model utilised was viewed initially as inadequate to guide appropriate drug dosing (particularly 
schedule dependence of drug effect). 
In answer to the last round of questions, the applicant committed to use this approach to characterize 
PK and PK/PD data to be generated post-marketing. A clinical pharmacology trial to assess the 
pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic effects (PK/PD) of Natpar (parathyroid 
hormone) and the impact of dose and dosing regimen on the control of serum calcium and 
normalization of calcium excretion in urine using mechanism-based approach will be performed by the 
applicant as a post authorisation measure to further address remaining deficiencies of the previously 
developed model. Modelling and simulation with mechanistic model-based assessment of prior PK/PD 
data is expected to be used to inform the design of this trial. Simulations should be used to explore 
whether data collection as currently planned would allow appropriately characterising this mechanism 
based model so that there will be a suitable tool for prediction and simulation of unexplored scenarios 
(e.g. tid dosing).

Special populations 
Mild-to-moderate renal impairment does not seem to alter the pharmacokinetics of 100 microgram PTH 
administrated subcutaneously in the abdomen after single dose. Section 4.2 of the SmPC reflects these 
observations mentioning that no adjustment to the administered dose is required in subjects with 
mild-to-moderate renal impairment and that no data are available in patients with severe renal 
impairment. In addition to the patients on renal dialysis, the lack of data in patients with severe renal 
impairment has been adequately added in section 5.2 of the SmPC. In section 4.4., it is stated that 
patients with severe renal disease have not been evaluated in clinical trials.  
Patients with severe renal impairment were excluded in the clinical trials to reduce variability in the 
populations. Overall hypoparathyroidism (no baseline PTH secretion) patient population is essentially 
middle aged, and the concomitant treatments with oral calcium and active vitamin D are very different 
from osteoporosis (normal PTH secretion) in the elderly population. Therefore, contraindications for 
Natpar can be expected to be different with some aspects between Natpar and the previously approved 
product Preotact. For preotact, since other drug treatments for osteoporosis were available, it was 
concluded that patients with these impairments could use other drug classes for treating osteoporosis 
and a contraindication was accepted. In hypoparathyroidism, and in the context of a “not well 
controlled” patient with either severe renal or hepatic impairment, there is no other class of drug that 
can be used to treat hypoparathyroidism. Moreover, treatment with Natpar is titrated to effect i.e., to 
achieve a defined serum calcium range and Natpar offers 4 different dosages that allow to adjust the 
serum calcium level together with variable doses of oral calcium and active vitamin D. Therefore, CHMP 
did not require a contraindication in patients with severe renal impairment for this product.  
Mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment (total score of 7 to 9 on the Child-Pugh scale) does not seem to 
alter the pharmacokinetics of 100 microgram PTH administrated subcutaneously in the abdomen after 
single dose. Section 4.2 of the SmPC reflects these observations mentioning that no adjustment to the 
administered dose is required in subjects with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment and that no data 
are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment. The lack of data in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment has been adequately added in section 5.2. In section 4.4., it is stated that patients 
with severe hepatic disease have not been evaluated in clinical trials. 
There is no trial investigating especially the effect of ethnicity as primary endpoint. Since 253 of the 
274 subjects included in the POP PK analysis are reported as Caucasian (2 as black, 8 as Asian and 9 
as Hispanic) no effect of race on the clearance or volume of distribution of PTH could be established as 
the predominance of Caucasians precludes the identification of an effect even if one existed. However, 
based on the previous Preotact assessment, it seems that the results of the substudy CL1-11-006 
supports the conclusion that the ethnicity factor is not suspected to influence the PK of PTH. However, 
earlier experience in patients from other ethnic origins in the osteoporosis indication of rhPTH(1-84) is 
not considered extrapolable since it concerned only female patients with a different background than 
patients with hypoparathyroidism. Important uncertainties remain regarding the PK, efficacy and 
safety of rhPTH(1-84) in hypoparathyroidism treatment in patients from other ethnic origins than 
White (see RMP). 
According to the POP PK analysis, there is a clear effect of bodyweight on the apparent clearance and 
on the apparent volume of distribution. In this context, a detailed discussion on the potential influence 
of weight on the PK profile and the Pk variability of Natpar has been asked by CHMP, especially 
considering the route of administration and the potential impact of adipose tissue thickness. The 
applicant was asked to discuss the convenience of an individualised dosing regimen on the basis of 
body weight and discuss the dosing regimen in overweight patients.  Based on the PK/PD relationship 
of PTH1-84 and calcium levels and the analysis of body weight and BMI, the clinical data indicate there 
was no difference in responder rates in the REPLACE or RACE studies (see efficacy/safety sections).

EMA/180882/2017 
Page 33/110 
 
  
Taking into account that the previous authorised product of rhPTH (Preotact) was indicated for 
postmenopausal osteoporosis, several studies were carried out in post-menopausal women. Taking into 
account that rhPTH is indicated in adults with hypoparathyroidism including male subjects, that male 
subjects appeared to have greater PTH exposure in study CL1-11-010 and that there is an effect of 
gender factor on the apparent volume of distribution in POP PK, the applicant has been asked by CHMP 
to further summarize the influence of gender factor on the rhPTH PK characteristics and its clinical 
relevance. Based on the fact that there is no direct linear relationship between PTH1-84 and calcium 
levels and considering the responder rate provided by the applicant for the REPLACE study, CHMP 
agrees with the applicant that the influence of gender factor on the rhPTH PK characteristics cannot be 
considered as clinically relevant. However, human data on PK, efficacy and safety in male patients 
remain limited compared to females, which was not a major concern. 
Although the data in elderly patients over 65 years age are limited, based on the Population 
Pharmacokinetic Analysis of Recombinant Human Parathyroid Hormone in Subjects with and without 
Hypoparathyroidism, NPSP-PCS-101, no difference in PK was detected with regard to age and 
therefore dosage adjustment based on age is not required. Section 5.2 of the SmPC informs that data 
with patients of 65 years and older are very limited. 
The safety and efficacy of Natpar in children less than 18 years of age have not yet been established. 
Drug-drug PK interactions  
Since PTH(1-84) is an endogenous peptide in healthy people, the most likely predominant metabolism 
is hydrolytic degradation and not related to cytochrome P450-dependent oxidative enzyme activity. 
Therefore, rhPTH(1-84) is unlikely to be involved in any drug-drug interactions related to cytochrome 
activity. It is not expected to bind to plasma proteins, and has a low volume of distribution similar to 
extracellular fluid volume; therefore it is not expected to be involved in drug displacement interactions. 
A specific drug interaction study with alendronate and rhPTH(1-84) (PaTH study) was performed, and 
no interaction was observed with alendronate. There was also no evidence of any influence on the PK 
of covariates based upon the classes of concomitant medications in the final population PK analysis. No 
evidence of drug interactions was identified during extensive clinical studies in subjects with either 
hypoparathyroidism or osteoporosis. No obvious effect of thiazide diuretics on PTH clearance is 
expected from a mechanistic perspective. During the previous submission for Preotact, the lack of 
effect of thiazide diuretics on PTH clearance was confirmed in a post hoc analysis of subjects 
participating in the PopPK (ALX1-11-93001) and ACR (CL1-11-006) sub-studies of TOP. In the same 
way, no PK interactions were observed with the related drug teriparatide (PTH 1-34) in formal drug-
drug evaluations with hydrochlorothiazide or furosemide. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
A clear understanding of the pharmacodynamics of the compound provides guidance for designing 
studies, by means of physiological parameters within the serum and urine of the patient. Primary 
pharmacology is important for this kind of working mechanism, since there are many physiological 
parameters available that can further substantiate the proposed working mechanism. Therefore, 
pharmacodynamic data is not only important to reveal the working mechanism, but also to 
demonstrate efficacy for this orphan medicinal product for which data is available on a limited number 
of patients. Data concerning serum and urinary concentrations or physiological parameters as an

indication of the PD response to changes in systemic PTH(1-84) concentrations is generated from 
studies in the clinical pharmacology program (including PK studies and efficacy studies). 
Pharmacodynamic (sub)studies were performed in healthy subjects (or osteoporosis patients with 
normal PTH levels), others in hypoparathyroidism patients, some after single dosing but several also 
after long term treatment with rhPTH(1-84).  
Study PBR-930811 and PBR-930812 were studies performed in healthy subjects, in a search for dose 
response properties. Study PBR-930811 was a single dose study demonstrating that serum total 
(/ionized) calcium concentration and dose appear to follow sigmoidal functions, with little or no effect 
at doses below 1.0 µg/kg and a maximum plateau effect at doses above 2.0 µg/kg, with urine 
calcium/creatinine ratio (risk for hypercalciuria) only increasing with doses greater than 2.0 µg/kg). 
Study PBR-930812 was an ascending multiple dose study in which the chosen dose for each subject 
was administered during a week. Mean serum total calcium returned to baseline (without risk of 
hypercalcaemia) each day for all doses less than 2.5 µg/kg.  
Studies CL-1-11-007, CL1-11-012 and CL1-11-13 are also performed in healthy subjects and show 
that there is no direct linear relationship between PTH concentration in serum and calcium response. 
There is a delay in the response, and the magnitude and duration of the calcium response seem to be 
more dependent on the duration of the elevated PTH(1-84) levels rather than on the absolute 
magnitude of the increase. This is very clear when comparing the IV versus SC administration (CL1-
11-013) in which the AUC0-24 after IV administration is nearly 2-fold greater than after SC dosing in 
the abdomen, and the peak PTH(1-84) concentration 23-fold greater, but in contrast the calcium 
response was less after IV administration. CL1-11-012 shows an exploratory formulation (not retained) 
that has a lower Cmax but also with a greater calcium response. Study CL1-11-007 resulted in the 
conclusion that although injection in the abdomen results in a higher Cmax than injection in the thigh, 
the magnitude and duration of calcium response is higher after injection in the thigh. Therefore it was 
decided that this was the preferred injection site.  
CL1-11-017 investigated the depth of injection. There were no major differences but there was a 
tendency towards higher calcium response after SC administration.  
Study C09-002 was the ‘pivotal PD study’ with PD response measured in hypoparathyroidism patients. 
It was an open-label, escalating, single-dose study in 7 subjects with a diagnosis of 
hypoparathyroidism for ≥  12 months. Calcitriol (usual dose) + calcium supplement was given the first 
day, followed by 50 µgor alternatively 100 µg rhPTH(1-84) + calcium supplement the day after, with a 
washout of 7 days between the two dosages. PD responses of serum total calcium, albumin, albumin-
corrected total calcium, magnesium, phosphate, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D], and 
creatinine were measured in blood samples collected for 24 hours after dosing of usual daily calcitriol 
or after a single SC injection of rhPTH(1-84). Timed urine collections were also made during 24 hours 
after dosing to see renal responses. As summarized in the table below, each measured physiological 
parameter is an indication of parts of the working mechanism of PTH and can therefore highlight the 
working mechanism of exogenous rhPTH(1-84), making the study highly relevant for PD response, but 
also for efficacy.

Administration of rhPTH(1-84) results in increases in serum calcium (see Figure 5) and magnesium. 
Initial lowering of urinary calcium and magnesium was followed by a return to baseline due to 
increasing serum levels, which was in contrast with calcitriol administration. The difference between 
the two treatments was most evident in their effects on phosphate homeostasis because calcitriol 
administration had little effect on urinary phosphate and there was a small increase in serum 
phosphate. rhPTH(1-84) administration resulted however in a substantial decrease in serum phosphate 
by markedly increasing urinary phosphate excretion. The serum calcium x phosphate product was 
therefore decreased, being an important determinant of soft-tissue calcification, while calcitriol 
treatment on the other hand raised the concentration of this product. From this study it can be 
concluded that in contrast to the standard therapy calcitriol, mimicking all the physiological effects of 
the missing hormone helps normalizing calcium, magnesium, phosphate and vitamin D metabolism in 
subjects with hypoparathyroidism, explaining the reduction in requirements of calcium and active 
vitamin D, observed in the placebo-controlled trial.

The Mosekilde ITT study was a 1 day PK/PD substudy after a 24 week treatment of 
hypoparathyroidism patients with either 100 µg rhPTH(1-84) or placebo. The results were largely in 
agreement with results obtained by company-own data, although the peak serum calcium value differs 
from the study C09-002 (see Figure 7) The company stated that the peak serum calcium value of 10-
12 hours which is based on the single-dose PK/PD study (C09-002), likely is not reflective of conditions 
at steady state, and that the multiple sampling from Sikjaer, et al provides a better estimation of the 
peak serum calcium levels. In the REPLACE study protocol, the interval for collecting samples for 
serum calcium measurements was established at 6-10 hours, based on the results of the investigator 
initiated trial.

hypoparathyroidism subjects receiving Natpar 100µg – Mosekilde trial 
Finally, three PK/PD studies were performed in osteoporosis patients. Similar to the Mosekilde 
substudy, CL1-11-006 was a substudy after administration of rhPTH(1-84) during 15 months. The 
magnitude of the change in serum calcium results are similar to the results after a single dose. Serum 
phosphate concentrations show an initial decrease in serum phosphate concentrations caused by the 
phosphaturic action of rhPTH(1-84). After the 4 hours post dose, factors other than rhPTH(1-84) are 
primarily responsible for the changes in serum phosphate. Study CL1-11-008 was a substudy of CAP 
which showed that calcium supplements (700 mg) in addition to rhPTH(1-84) administration had 
minimal effects on the acute serum total calcium or phosphate. Study N01-AR-9-2245 NIAMS-045 
(ACR substudy of PaTH) demonstrated that the co-administration of alendronate does not affect the PK 
of rhPTH(1-84) and the plasma PTH(1-84) concentration-time profiles for 100 μg rhPTH(1-84) SC 
injections after 12 months of daily treatment, but does suppress systemic calcium levels, leading to an 
increase in the baseline PTH(1-84) concentrations and lowering the rhPTH(1-84)-initiated increase in 
calcium levels by 50%. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Many physiological parameters were measured throughout the studies summarized here. Some in 
healthy subjects (or osteoporosis patients with normal PTH levels), others in hypoparathyroidism 
patients, some after single dosing but several also after long term treatment with rhPTH(1-84).  
Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017 
Page 37/110 
 
  
 
In study C09-002 the magnitude and duration of the calcium response seems to be more dependent on 
the duration of the elevated PTH(1-84) levels rather than on the absolute magnitude of the increase 
and although there is an initial lowering of urinary calcium, this was followed after 6 hours by a return 
to baseline due to increasing serum levels. The question therefore was raised whether a twice/three 
times daily administration, a continuous administration via a pump device or a slow release formulation 
could be envisaged, decreasing the risk for hypercalciuria while maintaining the calcium levels in the 
normal, elevated range. The current profile (quick release, once daily) does not at all mimic the diurnal 
variation seen with endogenous parathyroid hormone in healthy subjects. It is considered that the ZnCl 
formulation (abandoned by the company at an early stage in the development plan for the indication of 
osteoporosis) which was associated with a flat peak in plasma parathyroid hormone concentration over 
10hrs post administration would have been more suited to mimic the diurnal pattern found in plasma 
with endogenous parathyroid hormone, avoiding the observed gross swings in serum Ca++. 
Additional modeling of a QD versus BID dosing conducted suggests that BID regimens of Narpara may 
give advantages over the proposed dosing. A PK/PD study to evaluate BID dosing regimens to control 
hypercalciuria will be part of the studies the applicant is conducting as post authorization measures. 
Primary objective of the study is to assess the pharmacokinetic profile and pharmacodynamic effects 
(control of serum calcium and urinary calcium excretion) of rhPTH(1-84) administered as SC doses of 
25μg administered twice-daily, 50μg administered twice-daily, and 100μg administered once-daily, 
as well as the effect of supplemental oral calcium intake, in subjects with hypoparathyroidism. Further 
mechanistic PK/PD analysis allowing for conclusion on an optimal dose and dosing regimen are 
foreseen for this product. Preferably, continuous dosing using a pump device should be envisaged or a 
device that allows for individual dosing.  
The interaction with drugs that may act on calcium/phosphate metabolism such as complexing anions, 
inhibitors of bone resorption, medication for parathyroid related disorders, drug causing 
hypercalcaemia, thiazide diuretics, digoxin, estrogens, calcitonin, systemic corticosteroids, 
anticonvulsants, fluoride, lithium were considered by the Applicant and relevant pharmacodynamic 
interactions for digoxin and for drugs that affect serum calcium levels are added in the SmPC. 
From a PK perspective, a different bioavailability can be observed depending on the type of pen used 
for administration. The Applicant provided the results of two bioequivalence studies: one between the 
Ypsomed pen and the Haselmeier pen and one between the Ypsomed pen and the SHL pen. 
Bioequivalence has been demonstrated between the Ypsomed and Haselmeier pen. For the second 
bioequivalence study (Ypsomed vs SHL), 90% CI for Cmax and AUC after baseline-correction were 
slightly outside the 80.00-125.00% margins after removal of two outliers showing only marginal 
increases in PTH(1-84) concentrations after injection with the Ypsomed pen. Systemic exposure to the 
SHL pen was app. 13% higher in comparison with the Ypsomed pen. This is most probably due to the 
fact that with the SHL pen, in average, 11.3 mg more product is administered in comparison with the 
Ypsomed pen. Indeed, during this bioequivalence study, the weights of the pens have been recorded 
before and after administration to confirm that an appropriate dose was administered. Somewhat 
unexpectedly, these data showed that there is a high variability o the dose of product delivered, 
ranging from app. 40 to 80 mg for the Ypsomed pen and from app. 40 to 113 mg for the SHL pen 
(target weight is 72.1 mg). This study was the only one providing in vivo data for the SHL pen that 
was initially the pen intended for commercialisation. Therefore, the Applicant decided during the 
procedure  to use the Haselmeier pen (also referred to as Shire Q-cliq pen in this report) instead of the 
SHL pen for marketing purposes. Although also for the Haselmeier pen a substantial variability could 
be observed in the delivered dose, it should be noted that, for this pen, bioequivalence was proven 
with the Ypsomed pen and long-term clinical data are available from the RACE study. No new 
unexpected safety signals have been observed in this study and the complaints were less as compared 
to the Ypsomed pen. In addition, US post-marketing data are available for this product that is 
Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017 
Page 38/110 
 
  
marketed in the US using the Haselmeier pen (see section on safety of this report). In addition, the 
variability will also be part of the post authorisation studies that will be undertaken provided that 
during these studies the Haselmeier pen will be used for dose administration. This is highly 
recommended as this will be the only way to also take into account this additional variability 
introduced by the pen.  
The applicant acknowledged the value of a more mechanistic PK/PD model to characterise the 
exposure-response relationship,.  Given the complex interrelationship between PTH, serum calcium and 
24 hour urinary calcium excretion, the empirical model utilised was viewed as inadequate to guide 
appropriate drug dosing. The applicant will carry out further PK analysis in one PK study with a model-
based approach for study design and data analysis.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
A high variability has been observed during Study PAR-C13-004, questioning the overall suitability of 
the pens to deliver an accurate and appropriate dose and, as such, impacting the efficacy and safety of 
the product. However, this additional variability will be taken into account in the post-authorisation 
studies provided the same pen (Haselmeier) will be used during these studies. 
Acute changes in the systemic concentration of PTH(1-84) have short- (minutes to hours) and long-
term (hours to days) effects on several physiological parameters related to calcium and phosphate 
homeostasis. An increase in plasma PTH(1-84) increases the renal excretion of cyclic AMP, increases 
and decreases the tubular reabsorption of calcium and phosphate, respectively, and increases release 
of calcium from the bone. Elevated PTH(1-84) increases 1,25(OH)2D production by the kidney, leading 
to an increase in intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate.  
Measurement of these physiological parameters was included in a number of the short-term studies as 
an indication of the PD response to changes in systemic PTH(1-84) concentrations. Although a peak 
ACSC level was observed after 10-12 hrs in the applicant’s PD study, the applicant argues that the 
Mosekilde study, measuring post-dose [Ca++] after multiple dosing, is more reflective of the actual 
peak serum [Ca++] level. It is not agreed that this is the case.  
Furthermore, results do not necessarily support a QD dosing regimen. The possibility of a beneficial 
effect on the urine calcium excretion after dosing twice/three times daily or a slow release formulation 
should be considered. A PK/PD study to evaluate BID dosing regimens is foreseen by the applicant. 
This is considered sufficient, if the company can conclude by means of further analysis of this study on 
the optimal dose and dosing regimen.  
The above mentioned aspects are considered to be major deficiencies in the development programme 
which  contribute to the requirement of a post-authorisation safety/efficacy study and the 
recommendation for a PK/PD study for further confirmation of the appropriateness of the QD dosing 
regimen.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies and main studies 
A possible added value of hormone replacement therapy over the current standard therapy is 
recognised, and the working mechanism is plausible. It is agreed that current therapy does not resolve 
Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017 
Page 39/110 
 
  
 
the hormone deficiency in itself, while hormone replacement possibly can resolve the short- and long-
term consequences of the deficiency and its current treatment. Some patients may have difficulties to 
maintain a stable serum calcium level when treated with calcium (carbonate/citrate) and vitamin D 
(calcitriol/alphacalcidol). In addition, it is noted that reports suggest that hypoparathyroid patients’ 
quality of life is affected by the disease even when adequately treated with vitamin D and calcium. 
Dose-response studies and main clinical studies 
rhPTH doses of 50 to 100 µg per day were established as the expected therapeutic range, based on the 
phase I studies and in consideration of the safety margins established in the long-term toxicology 
studies. Among the efficacy and safety studies in hypoparathyroidism, 3 studies used a dose titration 
methodology and 1 study used fixed doses. 
The applicant has presented as pivotal study a 24-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
phase 3 study in 124 subjects to investigate the use (efficacy and safety) of rhPTH[1-84] for the 
treatment of adults with hypoparathyroidism : REPLACE. 
Methods 
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study using a replacement design in which 
the standard of care, oral calcium and active vitamin D, was decreased or eliminated while the 
investigational treatment was being up-titrated. 
Study Participants  
Hypoparathyroidism was defined by biochemical evidence from serum calcium and parathyroid 
hormone (PTH) levels, specifically hypocalcaemia at any time in the past and documented PTH levels 
below the lower limit of the laboratory normal range twice with the last 12 months. Exclusion criteria 
included a known history of hypoparathyroidism resulting from an activating mutation in the CaSR 
gene or impaired responsiveness to PTH (pseudohypoparathyroidism). 
Adult subjects with hypoparathyroidism consisted of a screening and stabilization period of 2 to 16 
weeks duration (as necessary to achieve stabilization (stable baseline oral calcium and active vitamin D 
metabolite/analog doses) prior to the first dose of study drug. The screening and stabilization periods 
were collectively known as the optimization period. During the optimization period (Visit 1 to Visit 5), 
the oral calcium and active vitamin D metabolite/analogue doses were adjusted towards a goal of an 
albumin-corrected total serum calcium concentration within the target range of 2.00 to 2.25 mmol/L. 
Subjects were optimized on calcium citrate (or in some cases, carbonate) and either calcitriol or 
alphacalcidol (study supplements). Subjects who were taking other forms of calcium prior to the study 
were converted to sponsor-provided supplements.  
Treatments 
Single doses (50, 75, or 100 μg) of NPSP558 or matching placebo were administered subcutaneously, 
once daily in the morning. 
The comparator in this study was the matching placebo (sterile lyophilized powder consisting of sodium 
chloride, mannitol, and citric acid monohydrate for reconstitution with sterile diluent). 
In addition, study-directed oral supplements were provided to subjects for use throughout the study 
(ie, from optimization through end of treatment) in the predefined strengths and lot numbers.

Objectives 
The objectives of this clinical study were to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of NPSP558 
compared with placebo in adult subjects with hypoparathyroidism. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy was demonstrated by a combined reduction in the need for oral supplementation with 
calcium and active vitamin D metabolites/analogs, and an albumin-corrected total serum calcium 
concentration that was normalized or maintained compared with the baseline value and did not exceed 
the upper limit of the laboratory normal range. 
The primary efficacy variable was the percentage of subjects who met the triple efficacy endpoint at 
Week 24, based on investigator-prescribed data. A subject met the triple efficacy endpoint if he/she 
achieved: 
o  At least a 50% reduction from the baseline oral calcium supplementation dose  
and 
o  At least a 50% reduction from the baseline active vitamin D metabolite/analog dose 
and 
o  An albumin-corrected total serum calcium concentration that was maintained or 
normalized compared to the baseline value (≥ 1.875 mmol/L) and did not exceed the 
upper limit of the laboratory normal range. 
(The albumin-corrected total serum calcium goal was defined for protocol Amendment 7. Prior to 
Amendment 7, this parameter was defined as a clinically stable serum calcium level established at 
baseline and normalized by Week 24.) 
The secondary efficacy endpoints of the study included a comparison of NPSP558 vs the placebo group 
on percentage reduction in calcium supplementation dose at week 24, proportion of subjects 
independent of supplemental active vitamin D metabolite/analog usage and a calcium supplementation 
dose of ≤  500 mg/day or less by Week 24, frequency of clinical symptoms of hypocalcemia reported 
as AEs (including paresthesia, muscle cramping, tetany, seizures) during Week 16 to Week 24.  
The exploratory endpoints of the study included comparisons between NPSP558 and placebo on the 
proportion of subjects that demonstrated at least a 50% reduction from baseline amounts of oral 
calcium supplementation and at least a 50% reduction from baseline amounts of active vitamin D 
metabolite/analog therapy by Week 24 of the study and stabilised ACSC (maintained or normalized 
compared to the baseline value), change from baseline in 24-hour urine calcium excretion, proportion 
of subjects that maintained a calcium-phosphate product in the normal range of less than or equal to 
4.4 mmol2/L2 at week 24, change in BMD by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry of the lumbar vertebra 
(L1-L4), hip (total, trochanter, intertrochanter, Ward’s triangle, and femoral neck) and distal one-third 
radius at Week 24 compared to baseline, change from baseline in bone turnover markers BSAP, s-CTx, 
P1NP, and osteocalcin at Week 24, change in QoL score as measured using the Short Form-36 (SF-36) 
Questionnaire from baseline to Week 24, percentage of subjects who met and maintained the 3 criteria 
of the triple efficacy endpoint from Study Week 16 through Study Week 24. 
The safety endpoints included incidence of clinical episodes of hypocalcaemia (eg, adverse event [AEs] 
of hypocalcaemia and decreased blood calcium) at all visits, incidence of AEs related to hypercalcemia 
and hypercalciuria at all visits, incidence of all other adverse events, change in laboratory values, 
physical examination (including vital signs [blood pressure, pulse, and body temperature], body

weight, and body mass index [BMI] [derived]), and electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters (atrial and 
ventricular rates and PR, QRS, and QTc intervals). 
Sample size 
It was planned that approximately 110 adult male and female subjects with hypoparathyroidism would 
be randomized (2:1) to NPSP558 or placebo at approximately 30 multinational investigative sites. 
Approximately 84 (56 active and 28 placebo) subjects were expected to complete the study. With 
expected rates at which subjects would meet the triple efficacy endpoint of 40% and 10% for the 
active and placebo groups, respectively, 80% power was expected based on a 2-tailed test and an 
alpha of 0.05. 
Randomisation 
A randomization list was used via interactive voice response (IVR) or interactive web response (IWR) 
systems in a 2:1 ratio (NPSP558:placebo), centrally administered. Simple block randomization was 
applied without use of stratification factors. Forced randomization was not permitted for this study. 
Clinical study team members involved in the conduct of the study were not granted access to the 
randomization schedule or unblinded treatment codes until after database lock. 
Blinding (masking) 
Study drug was administered in a double-blind fashion during the 24 weeks that constituted the dosing 
period. Regardless of treatment arm or assigned dose, each cartridge contained a clear, colorless 
solution with 14 doses. Blinding was maintained at each titration interval and throughout the study by 
use of the IVR system. The medical monitor or his/her designee was to be notified by telephone within 
24 hours following the unblinding of any subject for any reason. A record was to be kept of the reason 
for breaking the blind, the time of breaking and the name of the person who broke the blind. 
Blinded laboratory results, including bone marker and PTH levels, were not accessible to the medical 
monitors, sponsor personnel or their designees, or study site personnel. No blind was broken in this 
study. 
Statistical methods 
Since this study included one primary and multiple secondary efficacy endpoints, a fixed sequence test 
procedure was used to control the study level type I error. The order of test sequence started with the 
primary efficacy endpoint and proceeded to the 3 secondary efficacy endpoints, in the order in which 
the secondary efficacy endpoints were defined. 
Each of the tests was conducted using the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) documented statistical 
procedures with a type I error of 0.05. Any subsequent hypothesis tests were not executed unless all 
precedent tests in the sequence resulted in statistically significant results, ie, p-value < 0.05. 
Three analysis populations were defined in this study. The ITT population, modified from the definition 
for the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH), included all randomized subjects who 
received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one post baseline efficacy measurement. All 
efficacy analyses were conducted on the ITT population. The PP population was a subset of the ITT 
population, in which subjects had no significant protocol violations. Efficacy analyses based on PP 
population provided additional support for the study efficacy argument. The Safety population included 
Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017 
Page 42/110 
 
  
all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study drug with any follow-up information. 
The Safety population was used for all safety-related statistical analyses. 
A critical time point in the primary efficacy endpoint definition was Week 24, which coincided with the 
scheduled end of treatment (EOT). If a subject completed Week 24 efficacy assessments, the EOT 
would use the Week 24 data. If an ITT subject dropped out early or didn’t have assessments at Week 
24, then the last efficacy assessments would be carried forward to EOT. The EOT data was used for all 
efficacy analyses using the ITT population. Details of handling drop-out and missing data were 
documented in the study SAP. 
The number and percentage of subjects who met the triple efficacy endpoint were presented by 
treatment group. The 2-sided Fisher’s Exact test was utilized to test for the difference in the rate at 
which subjects met the triple efficacy endpoint between NPSP558 and the placebo treatment groups. 
The rate difference and its 2-sided asymptotic 95% confidence interval (CI) were presented. Various 
supportive analyses for the primary endpoint were conducted to provide supportive information for the 
efficacy argument. Additional sensitivity analyses, including, Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method, mixed-
effect model repeated measures approach (MMRM), and using various percentages of reduction in daily 
doses of calcium and active vitamin D metabolite/analog as primary endpoint definition were utilized to 
determine the robustness of the primary efficacy analysis results. Prospectively defined subgroup 
analyses were also conducted, including age, gender, and prescribed active vitamin D at baseline 
subgroups. All the above analyses were also conducted using subject diary data. 
Results 
The triple efficacy endpoint (primary analysis) at week 24 was achieved with statistical significance, 
but the frequency of clinical symptoms of hypocalcaemia during week 16 to week 24 was not 
statistically different between treatment group and placebo group. rhPTH(1-84) treatment resulted in 
increased serum calcium, but no significantly reduced urinary calcium excretion. Mean calcium-
phosphate product significantly decreased, BMD readings showed statistically significant improvement 
in the most hip locations and all bone turnover markers (BSAP, s-CTx, P1NP, and osteocalcin) 
increased from baseline during treatment with rhPTH(-184). Quality of life (SF-36) showed no 
consistently higher scores in the rhPTH(1-84) group over placebo.

Figure 4: subject disposition 
Twelve (9.7%) of the 124 subjects did not complete study treatment (ie, discontinued prior to Visit 
16), 5 (6.0%) in the NPSP558 group and 7 (17.5%) in the placebo group. In the NPSP558 treatment 
group, 2 subjects discontinued due to AEs: Subject 1010-0006, who had a current history of 
hypertension and a previous 24-year history of smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day, discontinued 
on Day 122 after experiencing a CVA; and Subject 4002–0003 (Day 58) withdrew due to multiple non 
serious AEs. The additional 3 discontinuations were unrelated to safety issues: subject decision 
(unspecified, Subject 0002-0002, Day 66), lost to follow-up (Subject 1021-0001, Day 68), and subject 
and investigator decision (Subject 2001-0009, Day 85). 
In the placebo group, 3 subjects discontinued participation in the study due to the investigator’s 
decision after it was determined that the subjects (1003–0002, 1005–0006, and 1014-0003) were 
noncompliant with study procedures. Three subjects ended treatment due to personal decisions. 
Subject 0001–0001 chose to leave the study due to increased calcium in urine and her concern that it 
might lead to problems with kidney stones (this subject had a history of recurrent kidney stones and 
urinary tract infections). 
Subject 1008-0001 moved and could no longer make trips to the clinic and Subject 4002-0004 was 
unable to cope with the rigors of the study design. One additional subject (1010-0003) was 
discontinued due to unspecified noncompliance.

Recruitment 
A total of 32 sites in 8 countries (USA 19, Canada 3, Denmark 3, Hungary 3, Belgium 1, France 1, Italy 
1, UK 1) screened 184 subjects in order to randomize 124 subjects. Sixty subjects failed screening. 
Twenty-eight sites randomized subjects. Eighty-four subjects were randomized to the NPSP558 
treatment group and 40 subjects were randomized to the placebo group.  
Conduct of the study 
24-week treatment period initiated with randomization (2:1) to once daily (QD) subcutaneous (SC) 
treatment with either NPSP558 or placebo. The initial NPSP558 dosage was 50 μg QD SC and the 
dosage could be up-titrated, first to 75 μg QD SC and subsequently to 100 μg QD SC, following a pre-
defined sequence of dose escalation / down-titration. The titration period for purposes of analysis 
included the 5-week period of up-titration of study drug through the end of Week 12, since most up- or 
down-titration of study drug and oral calcium/active vitamin D supplementation occurred during this 
time period. Subjects were to undergo staged reductions in calcium and active vitamin D 
metabolite/analog supplementation while maintaining or normalizing their ACSC, and while up-
titrating/downtitrating the study drug. 12 weeks maintenance phase was next, with a constant dosage 
of study drug maintained. 
Baseline data 
The mean duration of hypoparathyroidism was 11.6 (± 8.12) years in the placebo group and 14.6 (± 
11.16) years in the NPSP558 group and the 2 treatment groups were well balanced for duration, with 
similar proportions of subjects with disease durations of ≤  5 years (NPSP558, 15/84 [17.9%]; placebo 
10/40 [25.0%]), > 5 to 10 years (NPSP558, 27/84 [32.1%]; placebo 13/40 [32.5%]), and > 10 years 
(NPSP558, 42/84 [50.0%]; placebo 17/40 [42.5%]). At baseline, most subjects were receiving a 
prescribed calcium dose of ≤  2000 mg/day in the NPSP558 group (57/84 [67.9%]) and placebo group 
(29/40 [72.5%]), while high dose (> 0.5 μg/day of calcitriol or > 1.0 μg/day alphacalcidol) active 
vitamin D metabolite/analog dosing was prescribed at baseline in 56/84 (66.7%) NPSP558 subjects 
and 25/40 (62.5%) placebo subjects.  
Differences between screening (ie, prior to the optimization period) and baseline characteristics were 
observed by review of selected laboratory parameters and oral supplement doses at these 2 time 
points, for subjects who were eventually randomized. Mean (± standard deviation) values for these 
parameters for subjects who had data at both time points show that optimization led to a more 
homogenous study population by decreasing the variability of the effects of hypoparathyroidism.

“Modified” Intent to treat: included all randomized subjects who received 
at least one dose of study drug and had at least one post-baseline 
efficacy measurement. 
For a subject whose study treatment was still ongoing after Visit 14 
(Week 16), all 3 criteria had to be met for the subject to have met the 
triple efficacy endpoint. 
For the end-of-treatment time point, subjects were considered to not 
have met the triple efficacy endpoint (ie, failures) if they did not have 
sufficient drug exposure (discontinued treatment before Visit 14 [Week 
16]) Week 24 (EOT)

Long-term study: RACE 
RACE was a long-term, open-label study using rhPTH(1-84) for the treatment of adult male and female 
subjects with hypoparathyroidism. Efficacy data were available for 41 subjects at Month 24. The 
subjects must have previously completed Study PAR-C10-007 (8 weeks of active therapy) and/or

Study CL1-11-040 (Visit 18). rhPTH(1-84) at doses of 25 µg, 50 µg, 75 µg, or 100 µg were 
administered SC QD in the morning into alternating thighs based on a subject’s TSC level at baseline 
via a multidose pen injector. The starting dose of rhPTH(1-84) for this study was 25 or 50 μg SC QD, 
and there was a fixed protocol for adjusting supplements and dosage according to measured TSC 
levels. The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate the long-term safety and tolerability of 
SC rhPTH(1-84) as hormone replacement therapy for the treatment of adult subjects with 
hypoparathyroidism.   
Based on investigator-described data, 34/45 (75.6%) subjects met the triple efficacy endpoint at Week 
52 (95% CI: 60.5, 87.1), 21/41 (51.2%) subjects met the triple efficacy endpoint at Month 24 (95% 
CI: 35.1, 67.1), and 24/48 (50.0%) subjects met the triple efficacy endpoint at EOT (95% CI: 35.2, 
64.8). Furthermore, the study indicated that serum calcium levels could be maintained within the 
target range of 2.0 to 2.25 mmol/L, urine calcium excretion was maintained, serum phosphate levels 
were decreased and an increase in the calcium-phosphate product of greater than 4.4 mmol2/L2 was 
not obtained. Increasing serum BTMs were observed which reflects possible effects of rhPTH(1-84) on 
bone remodeling. 
This was an open label study that had the advantage that the mean exposure was 119 weeks 
(approximately 24 months), with the majority of subjects (n = 44) on study for at least 24 months. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was met with a high statistical significance. One of the goals was to 
demonstrate persistence of efficacy. The number of subjects meeting the primary triple efficacy 
endpoint at 24 months was however 21/41 (51.2%), while the number of subjects meeting this 
endpoint at week 52 is 34/45 (75.6 %). 
The following table summarizes the efficacy results from the main study RACE supporting the present 
application, a long-term open-label study investigating the safety and tolerability of NPSP558 for the 
treatment of adults with hypoparathyroidism.

Design 
An Open-label Study, Phase 3 Study  
Subjects must have previously completed the double-blind randomized 
NPSP558 RELAY study (8 weeks of active therapy) and/or previously 
completed the double-blind, placebo-controlled NPSP558 REPLACE study (24 
weeks of treatment and 4 weeks of follow-up after discontinuation of 
treatment – Visit 18). 
Duration of study: 
1 year (with option to extend by 1 additional 
year) 
Aim of study 
Treatment group 
To optimize NPSP558 dosing while reducing calcitriol and oral calcium 
(carbonate or citrate) supplementation to as low as safely possible while 
maintaining total serum calcium levels according to the NPSP558 and 
Supplement Titration Guideline. 
49 subjects (one group only, no comparator) 
The starting dose of NPSP558 for this study was 25 or 50μg SC once daily 
Subjects’ NPSP558 dose could be increased in increments of 25μg to a 
maximum of 100 μg SC QD by the investigator at any time during the study, 
with the goal of achieving or maintaining total serum calcium levels (pre-
dose) in the range of 2.0 to 2.25mmol/L. 
Adjustment of supplemental calcium and calcitriol regimens was based on 
total serum calcium levels, with the goal to be a reduction or removal of 
calcitriol treatment to the maximum degree clinically possible and to 
decrease the prescribed oral calcium supplementation to ≤ 500 mg daily.

Outcomes 
Safety population 
The mean duration of exposure was 833.0 (± 205.09) days. 
NPSP558 administered at the doses of 25, 50, 75, and 100μg SC daily was 
generally well-tolerated. 
There were no deaths during the study. 
No new unexpected safety signals were found in the TEAE analysis. 
Secondary analysis 
Outcomes 
34/45 (75.6%) subjects were responders at Week 52 (95% CI of 60.35 to 
87.1) 
21/41 (51.2%) subjects were responders at Month 24 (95% CI of 35.1 to 
67.1). 
24/48 (50.0%) subjects were responders fulfilling the 3 criteria of response 
at the time of their last study visit (95% CI of 35.2 to 64.8). 
[End-of-treatment was defined as the last determination of response or last 
available measurement during the treatment period up to the interim data 
cut-off date]. 
Supportive studies  
The RELAY study was a NPS sponsored 8-week study. It was a randomized, dose-blinded study with 25 
µg or 50 µg rhPTH(1-84) SC QD administered. The results suggest that rhPTH(1-84) at fixed dosages 
of 25 μg and 50 μg/day are not sufficient for the treatment of the majority of subjects with 
hypoparathyroidism, but that it is recognised that for very few patients, the additional dosage of 25 µg 
can be considered. A starting dose of 50 µg is an appropriate starting dosage for the majority of 
patients with hypoparathyroidism.  
The open-label REPEAT study was primarily a safety and tolerability study, performed in the Hungarian 
sites. This study extended exposure of rhPTH(1-84) for 16 subjects and introduced study drug 
exposure to an additional 8 subjects for 24 weeks. The study was designed to demonstrate continued 
safety while extending efficacy results realized during Study CL1-11-040. In order to better mimic 
usual clinical practice in this patient population, the frequency and the intensity of the medical 
investigations was reduced after completing rhPTH(1-84) titration. 75.0% of the subjects became 
independent of active vitamin D, while maintaining an oral calcium dose of ≤  500 mg/day. Fifteen of 
24 (62.5%) subjects completed the end of treatment visit on a dose of 100 μg SC QD, 5/24 (20.8%) 
completed on 75 μg SC QD, and 4/24 (16.7%) completed on 50 μg SC QD, with 1 of the 4 subjects on 
every other day dosing.

Treatment group 
To optimize NPSP558 dosing while reducing calcitriol or alphacalcidol and oral 
calcium citrate supplementation to as low as safely possible while 
maintaining total serum calcium levels. A study drug and supplement 
titration guideline was provided as part of the protocol. 
All subjects enrolled in this study received NPSP558; there was no control 
group. 
Subjects received daily doses of 50, 75, and 100μg SC study drug 
administered subcutaneously in the thigh. 
All subjects were started on 50μg SC study drug daily 
The starting dose of NPSP558 50μg could be titrated up in increments of 
25μg at every visit up to Week 16 (i.e. Weeks 2, 4, and 8) to a maximum 
dose of 100μg SC daily. 
Adjustment of supplemental calcium and calcitriol or alphacalcidol regimens 
were to be based on total serum calcium levels, with the goal being a 
reduction or removal of calcitriol/alphacalcidol treatment to the maximum 
degree clinically possible and a decrease in the prescribed oral calcium 
supplementation to ≤500 mg daily. Once a subject achieved a stable serum

description 
The Safety population consisted of 24 subjects who received at least one 
dose of study drug. 
Mean exposure to study drug, based on the current study, without regard to 
previous exposure in the REPLACE study, was 169.4 (± 1.81) days. 
Outcomes 
There were no deaths during the study and no discontinuations due to AEs. 
No SAEs were reported for any subject. 
The most frequently reported TEAEs by preferred term were: 
hypoaesthesia (12/24 [50%]); 
muscle spasms and vitamin D decreased (both 6/24 [25%]); 
hypercalcaemia (5/24 [20.8%]), 
fatigue, headache, and hypocalcaemia (all 4/24 [16.7%]); 
arthralgia, hypoesthesia oral and tetany (all 3/24 [12.5%]). 
Secondary analysis 
Outcomes 
18/24 subjects were responders at week 24 
6/24 subjects were non-responders at week 24. 
The Mosekilde IIT was performed independently and included 62 patients (32 in the rhPTH(1-84) 100 
µg group and 30 in the placebo group). Dosage adjustment of active vitamin D metabolites and 
calcium supplementation was only allowed upon hypercalcaemia or hypercalciuria, hence the higher 
incidence of hypercalcaemia. The rhPTH(1-84) injections were therefore regarded as add-on therapy. 
The number of patients showing hypercalcaemia was important with serum calcium levels ranging up 
to 3.8 mmol/L. This was accommodated by reducing oral active vitamin D and calcium or decreasing 
the frequency of PTH injections to less than daily (occurred in 5/29). Although the number of patients

with hypoparathyroidism treated with rhPTH(1-84) is increased by this study, the design is different 
and the added knowledge relevant for the application is limited. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
There are no efficacy studies in special populations. 4 patients ≥65 years received rhPTH(1-84) in the 
REPLACE study, 4 patients received placebo. 2 patients ≥65 years were entered into the non-controlled 
trial (RACE).  
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses AND meta-analysis) 
Baseline characteristics groups in the efficacy and safety studies in hypoparathyroidism were similar 
besides: the population consists of a largely female and white population (greater than 75% of 
subjects in each study were female, more than 90% of all subjects were white). 
Efficacy results were not pooled among studies. However, the primary (triple) efficacy endpoints in 
Studies PAR-C10-007, PAR-C10-008, and PAR-C10-009 were very similar to the primary efficacy 
endpoint in Study CL1-11-040. In all 4 studies, the triple efficacy endpoint was a composite that 
required a responder to have a predefined reduction in oral calcium and a predefined reduction in 
active vitamin D dose, while maintaining serum calcium concentration at a predefined level. 
Changes in active vitamin D metabolite and calcium supplementation were measured in each of the 4 
efficacy and safety studies in hypoparathyroidism (CL1-11-040, PAR-C10-007, PAR-C10-008, PAR-
C10-009), and Mosekilde IITs. Whereas in the NPS-sponsored studies the protocol enforced reductions 
in active vitamin D first and then in oral calcium with initiation or up-titration of rhPTH(1-84), in case 
of the Mosekilde study, alterations in active vitamin D and oral calcium only occurred when 
hypercalcaemia or hypercalciuria was already manifested. Active vitamin D and calcium dose 
decreased significantly in the rhPTH(1-84) arms in all studies.  
Serum phosphate levels were significantly decreased in serum and plasma in the rhPTH(1-84) 
treatment groups as compared with placebo/baseline in all studies. Reductions in 24-hour-urinary 
calcium excretion in the rhPTH(1-84) group were not significant and not conclusive, and must be seen 
in the context of concurrent serum calcium levels. 
Across the studies, baseline BTMs were generally below normal or in the lower end of the normal 
range. Treatment with rhPTH(1-84) increased all BTMs (p < 0.001 for all markers). During continued 
treatment, change in serum bone markers either plateaued (BSAP and osteocalcin), decreased after 
Week 40 (s CTx), or decreased after Week 52 (P1NP).  
Treatment with rhPTH(1-84) tended to normalize Z-scores and decrease BMD. As compared with the 
corresponding placebo groups in Study CL1-11-040 and the Mosekilde IIT, the changes in several 
locations seen with rhPTH(1-84) were statistically significant. 
Sufficient information regarding fracture prevalence in this condition is lacking, but a modest reduction 
in BMD following administration of rhPTH(1-84) might result in improvement of the material properties 
of bone in these patients 
It can be concluded that rhPTH(1-84) has some effect on decreasing the hyperdense bones seen at 
baseline in subjects with hypoparathyroidism while the current standard of treatment for 
hypoparathyroidism (calcium and active vitamin D) has no effect on bone metabolic parameters.

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
This is the case for all applicant’s studies, including the investigator initiated Mosekilde trial. Even for 
the small sample size, the treatment effect is adequate to arrive at statistical significant effects for the 
efficacy primary endpoint of the REPLACE, RACE, RELAY and REPEAT studies.  
The primary registration study, REPLACE, was randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled. It 
employed a pre-randomization optimization period during which subjects’ oral calcium and active 
vitamin D doses were adjusted towards a goal of an albumin-corrected total serum calcium (ACSC) 
concentration within the target range (2.0 to 2.25 mmol/L), in order to protect them against the 
mandatory withdrawal of oral calcium and active vitamin D called for in the protocol. Thereafter, 
subjects were randomly assigned to receive 24 weeks of treatment with either rhPTH(1-84) or placebo. 
The rhPTH(1-84) group started on 50 μg subcutaneous (SC) once daily (QD) and could be up-titrated 
to 75 μg SC QD and then to 100 μg SC QD. Down-titration in 25 μg QD increments was also allowed, 
but not to dosages less than 50 μg SC QD. Upon discontinuation of study drug, all subjects entered a 
4-week post-treatment follow-up period. The study had well-defined and reliable methods for 
assessment of subjects’ response, and included pre-specified methods for analysis of the results. 
The primary endpoint in this study was a composite consisting of 3 components (triple efficacy 
endpoint) consisting of achievement of eucalcaemia while targeting a clinically significant reduction in 
the requirement for oral calcium and vitamin D. This does not allow to assess any direct effect on one 
of the main target organs: i.e the kidney (calciuria, phosphaturia). These effects are assessed as 
secondary endpoint, but a clear treatment effect has not been demonstrated. Furthermore, due to the 
optimization phase, patients were at a higher serum calcium level than before, which makes it by 
design, due to safety reasons, harder to demonstrate that the number of hypocalcaemia symptoms is 
lowered. Also by design, in the context of one advancing drug and adjusting other medications 
according to protocol during the titration phase, it is normal that episodes of hypercalcaemia occur 
more frequently. Furthermore, the long-term effects on clinical hard endpoints such as benefit of 
rhPTH(1-84) vs standard treatment on e.g. nephrocalcinosis/nephrolithiasis, renal impairment can only 
be demonstrated in a study that is longer term. With this respect, a placebo controlled study lasting 24 
weeks is very short for an indication for a permanent administration.  
Although the REPLACE study was described as blinded, physicians were required to review serum 
[Ca++] results in order to titrate study drug. It would have been very easy, then, for physicians to 
work out who was in receipt of active study drug because rhPTH(1-84) will raise serum [Ca++] (in 
most cases) whilst placebo will not. 
It is considered that, on this occasion, a more informative and clinically relevant study would have 
been one that was open-label and without a placebo control. Subjects would have established a serum 
[Ca++] within the reference interval at baseline and be titrated with rhPTH(1-84) to maintain serum 
[Ca++] within the reference interval post-dose and throughout a 24hr period. In order to achieve this, 
a slow release version of the current product would be advantageous, to be administered either 2 or 3 
times per day (with a view to re-create the diurnal variation of parathyroid hormone in serum but 
mainly to maintain serum [Ca++] within the reference interval).  
It is anticipated that a different dosing regimen would better control serum calcium and phosphate and 
urinary calcium in the patient. Such a different dosing regimen will be included in one arm of a clinical 
trial in the hypoparathyroid population, which will be conducted as a post approval commitment 
(specific obligation) for Natpar to confirm the positive benefit/risk of the product by investigating a 
number of relevant outcome parameters.

In the D120 responses, the company details the breakdown of subjects who took part in the REPLACE 
study regarding the cause of hypoparathyroidism. There were 71% subjects with post-surgical 
hypoparathyroidism, 26 % subjects had idiopathic hypoparathyroidism, 1% autoimmune and 1% 
genetic syndrome. It would have been preferred for the studied population to be homogeneous, and 
this is regarded as a deficiency of the study design. 27 adult subjects with a variety of causes of 
hypoparathyroidism other than neck surgery represent a mixed population in themselves, with 
differing prognosis and consequences to clinical safety (especially immunogenicity response).  It is 
noted that the Expert Meeting on Natpar (see below)has recommended not to differentiate between 
surgical and non-surgical cases of hypoparathyroidism regarding the potential to develop antibodies to 
Natpar. 
Study RELAY was an 8-week, randomized, dose-blinded, dose comparison study which evaluated the 
efficacy and tolerability of 2 low, fixed dosage regimens of rhPTH(1-84), 25 µg QD and 50 µg QD as 
replacement therapy for the treatment of adult patients with hypoparathyroidism. 
Studies RACE and REPEAT were each open-label extension studies. Although they were designed 
primarily to evaluate long-term safety and tolerability of rhPTH(1-84), efficacy was also assessed in 
these studies. Study RACE is an ongoing, 12-month study with an additional extension and closed to 
further enrollment, with a narrative description until the data cutoff date of 03 January 2014. The 
rhPTH(1-84) dosing regimen in Study RACE started at 25 or 50 μg SC QD and the dosage could be 
adjusted in 25 μg increments to as high as 100 μg SC QD or to as low as 25 μg SC QD as needed to 
maintain appropriate serum calcium levels or due to any safety concerns. It was an open label study 
that had the advantage that the mean exposure was 119 weeks (approximately 24 months), with the 
majority of subjects (n = 44) on study for at least 24 months. Study REPEAT was 24 weeks in duration 
and is completed. The rhPTH(1-84) dosing regimen in Study REPEAT started at 50 μg SC QD and 
dosage could be adjusted upwards to as high as 100 μg SC QD or downwards to 50 μg SC QD as 
needed to maintain appropriate serum calcium levels or due to any safety concerns. 
The Mosekilde IIT study was a 6-month, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel-group 
study comparing the effect of adding rhPTH(1-84) 100 µg SC or similar placebo to conventional 
treatment with calcium and active vitamin D (alphacalcidol/calcitriol). It included and 62 patients (32 
in the rhPTH(1-84) 100 µg group and 30 in the placebo group).Efficacy endpoints included indices of 
calcium-phosphate homeostasis, effects on plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]2 vitamin D) 
levels, bone mineral density (BMD), and biochemical markers of bone turnover. The Mosekilde IIT is 
supportive of the efficacy, and has another design in that respect that the primary endpoint was 
different, and that dosage adjustment of active vitamin D metabolites and calcium supplementation 
was only allowed hypercalcaemia or hypercalciuria, hence the higher incidence of hypercalcaemia. The 
rhPTH(1-84) injections were therefore regarded as add-on therapy.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
RhPTH(1-84) achieves adequate calcium levels while significantly decreasing the requirement for oral 
calcium citrate and active vitamin D. The primary efficacy endpoint was met with a high statistical 
significance, and this is consistent throughout all studies.  
However, in the REPLACE study, 11 rhPTH(1-84) subjects who met the triple efficacy criteria at Week 
12 no longer met the 3 criteria at Week 24. Furthermore, after 24 weeks of treatment in the REPLACE 
study, there is still no stable mean calcium serum level obtained in the patients in the active treatment 
group. However, there is a small increase in mean calcium supplementation dose. In the RACE study, 
the number of subjects meeting the primary triple efficacy endpoint at 24 months was 21/41 (51.2%), 
while the number of subjects meeting this endpoint at week 52 is 34/45 (75.6 %). These results raise 
Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017 
Page 58/110 
 
  
questions about the persistence of efficacy, and this concern is to be addressed in the registry and in 
the open label RACE trial. A warning for tachyphylaxis is included in SmPC section 4.4 and RMP. 
Concerning neutralizing antibodies, it is demonstrated that these subjects responded to treatment in 
similar proportions to those without antibodies, suggesting that the antibodies do not neutralize the 
activity of the drug product. Long-term effects on efficacy is however also unknown. Long-term bone 
effects are missing also.  
Concerning the secondary endpoints in the REPLACE, there was a statistically significant percent 
change from baseline in oral calcium doses with a 52 % reduction in the calcium dose for patients on 
rhPTH(1-84) compared with a 2 % increase for patients on placebo. A higher percentage of patients in 
the active treatment group achieved independence from active vitamin D at week 24, and took a 
calcium dose of 500 milligrams or less (43 % vs 6 % in placebo group). However, the change in 
hypocalcaemic symptoms reported as adverse events was about the same for the active and placebo-
treated patients.  
An important exploratory endpoint looks at the impact of decreased serum phosphate on calcium 
phosphate product, and the active treatment group has a decrease in mean serum calcium phosphate 
product, maintained until rhPTH(1-84) is stopped. At week 24, the decrease in calcium phosphate 
product in the active arm is greater than in the placebo arm. The mean 24-hour urinary calcium 
excretion in REPLACE was similar in the placebo and treatment groups, this was attributed to increases 
in total serum calcium in the rhPTH(1-84) group, while total serum calcium decreased in the placebo 
group. Although there might be a meaningful reduction of urinary calcium (reduction in contrast to 
increase in serum calcium), this reduction is not demonstrated by this study. Therefore a clear 
immediate treatment effect has not been demonstrated. However, improvement is claimed indirectly 
by the applicant (and supported by the expert consultation, see below) since hypercalciuric patients 
are retained in the criteria for patients eligible for treatment with Natpar. Due to the design and 
duration of the study, long-term assessment of clinical hard endpoints such as benefit of hormone 
replacement therapy vs standard treatment on e.g. nephrocalcinosis/lithiasis, renal impairment were 
not possible.  
Serum [Ca++] was measured pre-dose of study drug. Only at visit 13 of the REPLACE study was 
serum [Ca++] measured pre-dose, at 1 hour post dose and then at 6-10 hours post dose. These 
results show that many subjects display hypercalcaemia (and since the peak [Ca++] occurs at 10-
12hrs post dose then the extent of hypercalcaemia is not adequately shown by these results). 
About 16% of subjects did not respond to Natpar at visit 13 by an increase in serum [Ca++] by 6hrs 
(plasma parathyroid hormone concentration was shown to rise as expected): it is considered that these 
subjects display either tachyphylaxis or desensitisation, perhaps as a consequence of the time-profile 
of Natpar in comparison to endogenous parathyroid hormone. Natpar is administered in quick-release 
form, achieving a peak concentration by 1-2 hours that is (about) 4 times the upper limit of the 
reference interval of endogenous parathyroid hormone and then decays with a half-life of about 3 
hours. The parathyroid hormone receptor on cell surfaces belongs to the family of G-coupled protein 
receptors and is known to exhibit desensitization. In the D120 responses, these cases were confirmed 
by the company, but not adequately described or evaluated withPD data provided but not in terms of 
the primary endpoint. The possibility of tachyphylaxis is included in the SmPC.  
About 5% of subjects do not show either an increase in serum [Ca++] or an increase in plasma 
parathyroid hormone concentration following administration of Natpar at visit 13. This had previously 
been found by the company in studies CL1-11-007, CL1-11-009 and CL1-11-010 but does not seem to 
have been pursued. Possible explanations are non-compliance (it is understood that subjects would 
have been monitored at visit 13, making this seem unlikely. Also, the company reports a high rate of 
compliance), device failure (the event seems to occur whatever device has been used) or the presence 
Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017 
Page 59/110 
 
  
of neutralising antibodies (the company reports that these are not found in recipients). Although the 
PK failure of study drug in 4 subjects was confirmed by the company, these cases were not adequately 
described or evaluated by the company.  
Of the 2 NPS sponsored studies that are considered supportive, the RELAY study was probably 
performed to introduce an additional minimum dose of 25 µg. Efficacy results are indeed consistent 
with other studies, but it is recognised that for very few patients, the additional dosage of 25 µg can be 
considered. The REPEAT study on the other hand was primarily a safety and tolerability study. Both 
study results are consistent with the study result from the REPLACE study.  
The RELAY, RACE and REPEAT studies were extension studies of the REPLACE study and so subject to 
selection bias. These studies had the primary objective of collecting data on clinical safety. 
Very few patients ≥ 65 years were involved in the trials. The population consists of a largely female 
and white population (more than 75% of subjects in each study were female, more than 90% of all 
subjects were white). 
Additional expert consultation 
CHMP had requested an ad hoc expert meeting to obtain the opinion of experts in the field on a 
possible niche indication for patients where conventional treatment is inadequate to control symptoms 
of hypocalcaemia or for patients where conventional treatment is difficult, and in particular to explore 
whether they find that PTH replacement might have an added value in these cases. Questions were 
addressed to the ad hoc expert group. The corresponding answers are presented below: 
1.  Please discuss how well patients with hypoparathyroidism can be controlled by current 
standard treatment and whether there is a need for other treatment options for all 
patients with hypoparathyroidism, for a specific subgroup or for specific aspects of the 
disease. 
All experts attending the ad hoc expert meeting (SAG) saw a need for other treatment options beyond 
standard treatment, which is currently based on active vitamin D analogues and calcium supplements. 
While current standard treatment in many cases controls serum calcium levels reasonably well 
(targeting a serum calcium in the low-normal range or slightly below the lower limit of the normal 
range), many other aspects of the disease can remain unsatisfactory: Long-term consequences, which 
are felt to occur more frequently even under standard treatment, include: the risk of ectopic 
calcifications, in particular of the kidney (nephrocalcinosis) with deterioration of renal function, for 
which elevated serum phosphate levels and a deranged serum calcium-phosphate product may be 
indicators; CNS manifestations such as impaired cognitive function, anxiety, psychiatric manifestations. 
Current standard treatment replaces only incompletely the physiological actions of parathyroid 
hormone (PTH). Supraphysiological doses of oral calcium supplements and active vitamin D 
metabolites (or high doses of cholecalciferol in some cases) may cause problems of their own, such as 
gastrointestinal side effects of ingestion of large quantities of calcium salts or vitamin D intoxication. 
The patient representatives pointed out in particular the symptoms which can occur still under 
standard treatment, such as difficult-to-control episodes of cramps, body stiffness with considerable 
impact on daily activities, or the feeling of “brain fog”; also they raised concerns about long-terms 
consequences from current standard of care. 
Concluding this question, the expert group saw a need for other treatment options beyond standard 
treatment for the above reasons. 
2.  Please discuss the relevance of the results of the pivotal study. In particular discuss: 
Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017

-  The clinical relevance of the statistically significant results in favour of Natpar for the 
primary  endpoint  (responders  were  defined  as  having  a  ≥50%  reduction  in  oral 
calcium  and  vitamin  D  intake  and  a  target  pre-dose  serum  [Ca++]  between  1.87 
mmol/L and the upper limit of the reference interval for [Ca++]) i.e. the importance 
of reducing supplements in relation to the use of standard treatment. 
-  The  clinical  relevance  of  data  (including  possible  limitations  of  the  data  set)  with 
respect  to  fluctuations  in  serum  [Ca++]  also  in  the  context  of  the  proposed  dosing 
schedule? Has the company shown that Natpar achieves the calcium status that you 
seek for the patient? 
The expert group was of the view that substitution of the missing hormone, PTH, would in principle be 
expected of value. Based on the available data for Natpar in the pivotal trial (REPLACE) and supportive 
trial (RACE), the views on the possible benefit were as follows:  
a) Serum calcium: The expert group considered the serum calcium values 24 hours post injections as 
reasonably well achieved but would not see this as a particular clinical benefit. The expert group was, 
however, highly critical of the short term calcium fluctuations after each injection. This was highlighted 
in an analysis presented by the co-rapporteur of the serum calcium values 6 hours post injection, 
which were collected at one point during the REPLACE trial, at visit 13; here, serum calcium values 
varied widely in the Natpar-treated group 6 hours post injection; a number of patients (ca. 40%) 
experienced outright hypercalcaemia (whereas on the other hand ca. 20% did not show any increase 
in serum calcium). It was criticized that at no point maximal and minimal serum calcium values over 
24 hours post injection had been measured; serum calcium levels physiologically are tightly regulated, 
although it was pointed out that in hypoparathyroidism there are also broader fluctuations linked to 
calcium ingestions than physiological, therefore the wide fluctuations observed were of concern to the 
expert group.  
With regard to the fluctuations in serum calcium (and to some extent serum phosphate, see below) 
delivery by pump or as slow release form, or as twice daily application, would be expected to address 
better the problem. The experts noted the applicant’s intention to study further dose regimens (25 and 
50 microgram BID use), which was welcomed. The patient representatives pointed out that some 
patients, using the approved product in the US, or another PTH preparation off label in the EU, split the 
daily dose by using a syringe, because of the time-limited action of Natpar and symptom relief 
perceived. 
b) Serum phosphate: The reduction of hyperphosphataemia was seen as significant and beneficial, as 
long-term elevated serum phosphate levels are likely linked to ectopic calcifications. However it was 
noted critically that the effect of Natpar lasted only for ca. 8-12 hours out of 24 hours. 
c) Parameters of renal calcium excretion: With regard to hypercalciuria, 24 hour calcium excretion did 
not show an improvement with Natpar vs. control at the end of the REPLACE study. A limitation of the 
available data is that renal handling of calcium has not been properly measured in the REPLACE study, 
e.g. with measurement of the fractional excretion of calcium (which might be lowered under Natpar 
treatment). 
d) Markers of bone turnover: There is an indication of increase (i.e. towards normalisation) of markers 
of bone turnover. This is consistent with findings from other studies in patients with 
hypoparathyroidism, who tend to have low bone turnover, showing an improvement towards normal 
bone turnover with PTH injections. However, whether this might translate into a clinical benefit is not 
known, as this may improve trabecular bone density (which is already increased in 
hypoparathyroidism) but may increase porosity of cortical bone. 
e) Clinical improvement, Quality of life (QoL): The expert group found it disappointing that the 
applicant could not demonstrate any improvement of these parameters in their studies, as most expert 
group members felt this was the outcome in most need of improvement and could have been expected 
from such a hormone replacement treatment (see also section 5). However, it was acknowledged that 
instruments such as a general SF36 questionnaire might not be very sensitive and appropriate for 
Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017 
Page 61/110 
 
  
 
hypoparathyroidism; further research in this field is encouraged. The patient representatives pointed 
out that there were many patients anecdotally reporting a significant improvement in quality of life, 
cognitive symptoms as well as cramps and tetanic equivalents, and that this was also very much their 
personal experience. Several experts added that published uncontrolled studies, circumstantial 
evidence and individual patients’ narratives suggest improvements under such therapy. 
When asked what was felt missing in the studies, the experts mentioned cognitive testing, more 
specific QoL testing, and, at selected time points, measurements of serum phosphate (2-3 times per 
day), a calcium serum profile measurement over 24 hours and a proper calcium clearance 
measurement. 
Concluding this question, the experts voiced some criticism and concern with the proposed dosing 
schedule and the serum calcium fluctuations post injections (which could be expected to be of lower 
extent if Natpar would be administered in divided doses) but acknowledged the potential value of PTH 
treatment with Natpar (short and long term) with the existing posology for some patients. 
3.  Currently,  it  is  suggested  to  use  Natpar  in  patients  not  well  controlled/refractory  to 
standard  treatment.  Could  it  be  acceptable  to  extrapolate  data  achieved  in  the  pivotal 
clinical trial for Natpar in patients that were optimized on stable calcium levels to those 
patients not well controlled/refractory to standard treatment?  
It was pointed out and acknowledged that responses in all subgroups of the REPLACE study were 
similar. Overall, the expert group was of the view that the benefits seen in the study population might 
also translate into benefits for patients refractory to existing standard therapy. 
However, it was felt that criteria to define such patients as proposed by the applicant may be too far-
reaching; these were based on therapeutic goals in a recently published EU guidance paper (European 
Society of Endocrinology Clinical Guideline: Treatment of chronic hypoparathyroidism in adults. Eur J 
Endocrinol. 2015 Aug; 173:G1-G20). However, therapeutic goals defined in this guideline were 
intended to provide guidance for optimisation of treatment, and not necessarily to define those 
patients considered to be “refractory” to treatment. 
The experts were asked to consider possible criteria to define such patients. Factors suggested to be of 
likely relevance were severe and persistent symptoms related to hypoparathyroidism and, as 
laboratory parameters, hyperphosphataemia (with serum phosphate > 1.6 mmol/L), hypercalciuria 
(with 24-hour urinary calcium > 8 or 10 mmol/24 hours) and serum calcium outside the optimal range 
despite use of supraphysiological doses of active vitamin D (≥ 3 microgram of 1-α-
hydroxycholecalciferol or equivalent) or fluctuating wildly without apparent cause. 
In any case, the experts suggested treatment with Natpar should be in the hands of specialist care. 
4.  By  including  both  patients  after  neck  surgery  and  others  with  a  variety  of  conditions 
leading  to  hypoparathyroidism,  the  studied  patient  population  is  quite  diverse.  The 
development  of  antibodies  should  be  taken  into  account  for  the  patient  group  that  has 
never  been  exposed  to  endogenous  hormone.  Do  you  think  this  is  a  risk  in  terms  of 
responding differently, considering immunogenicity, tachyphylaxis? 
The experts considered that there is only a very low number of patients without circulating PTH from 
birth. Moreover, any potential problem with neutralising antibodies should become apparent during 
treatment.  
However, development of tachyphylaxis on therapy with Natpar was considered to be a possibility 
which could not be excluded, but may become apparent as an increase of doses of calcium and active 
vitamin D needed.

5.  In  case  of  a  registry,  which  efficacy  and  safety  aspects  should  be  followed  in  order  to 
gather more long term data?  
The expert group pointed out limitations with the proposal of a registry, due to the lack of a control 
group, in particular in the light of the many questions to be resolved and e.g. that certain evaluations 
are deemed  not possible in that context such as cognitive testing. A drug product-based registry was 
considered to have disadvantages vs. a disease-based registry, the latter however being doubtful to be 
available. Overall, the expert group did see a need for post authorisation studies and expressed a 
strong view that the applicant should be required to initiate and maintain such data generation if the 
product were to be approved. Post-authorisation follow up may include safety aspects as well as 
efficacy parameters, with a focus on long-term outcome (in particular kidney stone formation, 
nephrocalcinosis, deterioration of renal function, brain calcifications), QoL (in particular reduction of 
specific clinical symptoms such as episodes of tetanic equivalent but also impairment of daily 
activities), cognitive testing and more detailed measurements of calcium post injections. Additionally, 
long-term impact on bone metabolism should be considered (both potentially beneficial due to 
improved remodelling or adverse due to increased porosity of cortical bone). Further exploration of 
other posologies, such as twice daily injections or a slow release formulation should also be 
encouraged. This was also emphasized by the apparent ongoing off label use with dose splitting to 
optimise response to symptoms, as reported by the patient representatives (see above). 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
The primary endpoint in the pivotal efficacy study was focused on maintaining serum calcium within 
the target plasma level range, titrating active vitamin D metabolites and calcium supplementation. 
Primary efficacy was demonstrated by a combined reduction in the need for oral supplementation with 
calcium and active vitamin D metabolites/analogues, and an albumin-corrected total serum calcium 
concentration that was normalized or maintained compared with the baseline value and did not exceed 
the upper limit of the laboratory normal range. 
Use of Natpar exposes most subjects to marked diurnal swings in serum [Ca++] outside the reference 
interval. Some subjects did not respond to Natpar by an increase in serum [Ca++].  
Furthermore, direct effects on one of the main target organs, i.e. the kidney, cannot be concluded by 
the primary endpoint that was used. The primary endpoint and the duration of the study does not 
allow to demonstrate clinical benefit versus standard treatment for those who do well with active 
vitamin D metabolites and calcium supplements, e.g. the avoidance of long-term consequences such 
as nephrocalcinosis/nephrolithiasis and renal impairment. 
Although it is recognized that many measures were taken for safety reasons, and that also the design 
is influenced by this, the primary endpoint used does not allow to assess any direct effect on one of the 
main target organ: i.e the kidney (calciuria, phosphaturia). The treatment with Natpar should therefore 
be limited to a very restricted patient population, in which treatment with calcium and vitamin D 
metabolites is insufficient to obtain stable levels of calcium. During the procedure the applicant 
provided the results from two subgroups defined by different criteria as not adequately controlled by 
standard treatment:  
The first set of criteria identified patients who need larger doses of oral calcium and active vitamin D to 
raise serum calcium and/or to control the symptoms of hypocalcaemia. By applying these criteria, 20 
subjects (5 on placebo, 15 on Natpar) were identified in REPLACE. It is acceptable that the difference 
in primary endpoint is not statistically significant and it is acknowledged that there is a similar 
difference compared to the entire REPLACE population. Graphic time-profiles that summarize the main

biological parameters (albumin-corrected serum calcium, serum phosphate, calcium-phosphate product 
and serum creatinine), the symptoms of hypocalcaemia and the daily dose of oral calcium, active 
vitamin D and Natpar were provided. 
A different subgroup of patients that are not well controlled was defined by the applicant, based on 
recent guidelines of the European Society of Endocrinology, although therapeutic goals defined in this 
guideline were intended to provide guidance for optimisation of treatment, and not necessarily to 
define those patients considered to be “refractory” to treatment. Furthermore, this subgroup does not 
reflect the subgroup of hypoparathyroidism patients that do currently have a demonstrated benefit for 
the treatment if responding to the primary endpoint. This resulted in 100 unique subjects (33 on 
placebo; 67 on Natpar) out of 124 subjects that meet one of the criteria in the REPLACE trial. 
The design of the pivotal trial shows a clear and substantial effect of rhPTH(1-84) to decrease daily 
calcium and active vitamin D metabolite requirements in hypoparathyroidism patients.  The significant 
decrease of the serum calcium-phosphate product suggests potential further benefits. However, in the 
absence of a demonstrated more definite long term benefit (see below), the CHMP concluded that this 
treatment should be limited to a restricted patient population in which treatment with calcium and 
vitamin D metabolites is insufficient to obtain stable and acceptable levels of calcium and phosphate, 
or for which standard therapy results in intolerable adverse events or persistent, severe 
hypoparathyroidism symptoms (now reflected in the indication wording of section 4.1 of the SmPC), 
which CHMP identified as a currently unmet need (see also section 3.2.3, Additional considerations on 
the benefit-risk balance, of this report).  
Therefore, there remains a need to establish a clear, more definite, benefit of treatment with Natpar in 
such a restricted population, i.e. in the approved indication in patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism 
that are not adequately controlled with standard therapy alone. As concluded also during the ad hoc 
expert meeting, cognitive testing (more specific QoL testing) and, at selected time points, 
measurements of serum phosphate (2-3 times per day), a calcium serum profile measurement over 24 
hours and a proper calcium clearance measurement are lacking in the studies. These will be collected 
as additional and more definite, relevant clinical outcomes to confirm the positive benefit/risk of the 
product as part of the conditional marketing authorisation and constitute a specific obligation of the 
applicant under Art. 5 of Commission Regulation 507/2006. Therefore the applicant has the obligation 
to conduct a randomised controlled trial comparing Natpar to Standard of Care and to alternative 
dosing (optimal dosing resulting from a PK/PD study), investigating the appropriateness of the dose, 
cognitive data and QOL, as well as other parameters of calcium-phosphate metabolism, including 
calcium serum profile, serum phosphate and renal calcium clearance (see also section 2.7 risk 
management and section 4 recommendation).  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The rhPTH(1-84) clinical development program (primary data source) includes 13 Clinical 
Pharmacology Studies, 4 efficacy and safety studies in hypoparathyroidism, of which one ongoing, and 
a supporting development program consisting of 7 osteoporosis studies (3 placebo-controlled, 2 active 
controlled and 2 long-term extensions). 
This small number of patients with hypoparathyroidism is supplemented with safety data from 
osteoporosis studies. This population is, however, different with respect to sufficiency of parathyroid 
hormone (PTH), its implications on calcium and phosphate metabolism and the affected organs and 
Natpar - Assessment report

body systems and background morbidity. Therefore, the contribution of the data from the osteoporosis 
studies to the safety analysis in patients with hypoparathyroidism is very limited. 
The first cut-off of the ongoing study PAR-C10-008 (RACE) was 03 January 2014 with the exception of 
serious adverse events (SAEs) and markedly abnormal laboratory values for which a data cut-off of 20 
June 2014 was used. 
The updated cut-off for the ongoing RACE trial was 30 September 2014.

Table 13: Exposure to rhPTH(1-84) in studies in hypoparathyroidism 
The number of person years exposure in the NPS-sponsored hypoparathyroidism studies was 168.22. 
The median duration of exposure to rhPTH(1-84) was 48.00 weeks. 
Among the 121 subjects treated with rhPTH(1-84) in the efficacy and safety studies in  
hypoparathyroidism, 108 subjects received at least 24 weeks of treatment, and therefore, the short-
term exposure is acceptable. 
At the cut-off date of 30 September 2014 for the ongoing RACE trial 41 patients were exposed for ≥ 36 
months.  
For a product that is intended for chronic use, and for which no significant reduction in urinary calcium 
has been demonstrated, the number of patients receiving long term treatment is limited to draw 
conclusions on the long term (efficacy and) safety aspects. 
The placebo treated population with only 40 patients is very small to allow comparison with the PTH-
treated group. 37 subjects received at least 12 weeks of treatment and 31 subjects received at least 
24 weeks of treatment. The median duration of exposure to placebo was 24.12 weeks and the total 
person years of exposure 17.22. 
Demographic and other characteristics of the study population 
The reader is referred to the clinical part for a detailed description of the characteristics of the study 
population. 
In the studies in hypoparathyroidism, the majority of the subjects were female (79.3%) and most 
patients were white, non-hispanic. The elderly population in the efficacy and safety studies 
hypoparathyroidism, is limited: only 6 patients were 65 years of age or older and no subjects were 75 
years of age or older. No patients with severe renal and hepatic impairment have been included. 
Pen

During the procedure the Applicant decided against the use of the SHL pen for commercialization and 
switched to the Haselmeier pen (also referred to as Shire Q-cliq pen in this report) as the pen to be 
used for commercialisation for Natpar. The Haselmeier pen has only been used in the RACE trial as of 
30 September 2014, i.e. after cut-off date. Bio-equivalence with the Ypsomed pen was assessed in trial 
PAR-C10-005. 
Adverse events 
Common adverse events 
The most frequent treatment emergent adverse events, reported in more than 10% of rhPTH(1-84)-
treated subjects in the clinical hypoparathyroidism studies were paresthesia (43.0%), tetany (34.7%), 
hypocalcaemia (33.9%), headaches (28.1%), upper respiratory tract infection (25.6%), nausea 
(24.8%), hypercalcaemia (24.0%), arthralgia (17.4%), abdominal pain (15.7%), diarrhea (15.7%), 
fatigue (14.0%), cognition and attention disorders and disturbances (13.2%), vomiting (13.2%), back 
pain (12.4%), pain in extremity (12.4%), vitamin D decreased (11.6%), anxiety symptoms (10.7%), 
hypercalciuria (10.7%), injection site reactions(10.7%). 
The on-treatment TEAEs were analyzed for time of any occurrence. During the first year of exposure 
which represented the greatest number of subjects on treatment, with the exception of hypocalcaemia, 
pain in extremity, lower respiratory tract infection, influenza, vitamin D deficiency, urolithiasis, and 
gastroenteritis viral, the incidence rates of the analyzed TEAEs which occurred by the ≥  1 to < 12 
week interval, tended to peak in that interval and decline thereafter. The incidence rates for 
paresthesia, diarrhea, pain in extremity, lower respiratory tract infection, urolithiasis, and 
gastroenteritis viral remained approximately the same in the ≥  1 to < 12 week and ≥  12 to < 24 
week intervals. The highest incidences of hypocalcaemia and pain in extremity was during the ≥  52 to 
< 104 week and ≥  12 to < 24 week intervals, respectively.  
The higher incidence of adverse events during the first 12 weeks of management (that appear to 
reflect metabolic disturbance) is understood because attempts are being made to establish the 
appropriate dose of study drug.

Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017 
Page 67/110 
 
  
 
The most frequent post-treatment TEAEs in these PTH subjects were paresthesia (20.7%), 
hypocalcaemia (19.8%) and tetany (11.6%). 
Adverse drug reactions 
At day 120 and 180, the company was requested to carry out a relatedness exercise for all reported 
adverse events, not only those that occurred in >5% of patients. In the day 180 responses, all events 
reported in pivotal study CL1-11-040 were reviewed and all MedDRA PTs reported in at least 3 subjects 
exposed to Natpara were assessed for relationship to treatment according the classification 1) 
Hypercalcaemia symptom, 2) Hypocalcaemia symptom, 3) Drug administration event, and 4) Other 
events that may be related to treatment. Events reported in fewer than 3 subjects were also assessed 
for inclusion in category 3) and 4) above. Biologic plausibility was assessed. Other considerations 
included known mechanism, and if reported dechallenge-rechallenge. Resulting in the ADR table below 
(very common ≥ 1/10, common ≥1/100 to < 1/10). 
Table 15: Adverse drug reactions 
Adverse events of special interest 
Hypocalcaemia, hypercalcaemia, and hypercalciuria 
Hypocalcaemia, hypercalcaemia, and hypercalciuria were considered adverse events of special interest 
(AESI) in the clinical development program of rhPTH(1-84) in subjects with hypoparathyroidism due to

the underlying physiology of hypoparathyroidism and the mechanism of action of rhPTH(1-84), the 
dose titration and oral calcium and active vitamin D modification in the hypoparathyroidism studies. 
Individual PTs were combined with the associated laboratory PT. Hypocalcemia includes the AEs with 
the preferred terms of “hypocalcemia” and “blood calcium decreased”, hypercalcemia includes the AEs 
with the preferred terms of “hypercalcemia” and “blood calcium increased”, and hypercalciuria includes 
the AEs with the preferred terms of “hypercalciuria” and “urine calcium increased”. 
Individual calcium laboratory parameters alone were reviewed, which may or may not have been 
reported as an AE. 
Clinical symptoms were reviewed as a secondary efficacy endpoint. 
Table 16: Summary of hypocalcaemia, hypercalcaemia and hypercalciuria by study period in 
the Replace study 
Hypercalcaemia 
Double-blind, placebo-controlled Study CL1-11-040 
Optimization period (before the first dose date) 
In the placebo-controlled Study CL1-11-040, during the optimization period, 3/84 (3.6%) subjects (3 
events) who were eventually randomized to rhPTH(1-84) and no subjects who were eventually 
randomized to placebo experienced an AE of hypercalcaemia. These subjects all had on-treatment 
TEAEs of hypercalcaemia and/or hypocalcaemia. 
Titration period (through week 12) 
During the titration period of the placebo controlled Study CL1-11-040, hypercalcemic events occurred 
more frequently in the rhPTH(1 84)-treated subjects than in the placebo treated subjects.  Both the 
treatment emergent adverse events and the ACSC laboratory values support this trend: 12/84 
Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017 
Page 69/110 
 
  
 
 
(14.3%) rhPTH(1-84) subjects (13 events) and 1/40 (2.5%) placebo subjects (1 event) reported 
hypercalcaemia; ACSC values between > 2.65 mmol/L and ≤  2.98 mmol/L hypercalcaemia occurred in 
8/81 (9.9%) rhPTH(1-84) subjects and not in placebo-treated subjects. One PTH-treated patient 
(1.2%) and no placebo treated patient had an ACSC value > 2.98 mmol/L. 
Two of the events occurred 2 and 3 days after the initiation of 50 μg of rhPTH(1-84), however all 
others occurred well into the titration period ranging between Study Day 25 and Study Day 57, 
following up-titration to 75 or 100 μg of rhPTH(1-84). 
In the PTH group, one event was serious, resulting in an interruption of the study drug. 
All events resolved. Four subjects in the PTH group had hypercalcaemia with a duration of more than 7 
days (range 15 to 58 days), 2 of these subjects interrupted their study drug regimen. 
This larger number of hypercalcaemia in the PTH-treated group can be explained because both PTH 
and supplements have an effect on mineral homeostasis and need to be adapted. Placebo treated 
patients only had short-term reductions in their oral calcium and vitamin D supplements and quickly 
returned to their baseline supplements, by study design. Concomitantly, mean ACSC levels increased 
over baseline in rhPTH(1-84) subjects during this titration period, while there was an expected 
decrease in serum calcium in the placebo group. 
As the number of patients with hypercalcaemia in the titration period is high (14%), very close 
monitoring of the patients is required.  
Stable period (following week 12 to week 24) 
In rhPTH(1-84)-treated subjects during the stable period, less hypercalcaemia was reported either as 
an AE or assessed by central laboratory values as compared to the titration period, but still, 8/84 
(9.5%) of rhPTH(1-84)-treated subjects had 8 AEs of hypercalcaemia, no AE were reported in the 
placebo group. In the PTH group one event was severe, which resulted in an interruption of the PTH 
dose and a subsequent reduction from 100 μg to 75 μg daily. 
Hypercalcaemia, defined as ACSC > 2.98 mmol/L, occurred in no rhPTH(1-84) subjects and in 1/33 
(3.0%) placebo subjects. Based on ACSC values between > 2.65 mmol/L and ≤  2.98 mmol/L, 
hypercalcaemia occurred in 4/79 (5.1%) rhPTH(1-84) subjects and not in placebo subjects. 
Concomitantly, mean ACSC values returned to baseline in rhPTH(1 84) subjects during the stable 
period. 
Also during the stable period of the placebo controlled REPLACE study, the incidence of hypercalcaemia 
was higher in the rhPTH(1-84)-treated subjects than in the placebo-treated subjects. This requires 
regular monitoring of serum calcium during treatment.  
Post-treatment period (after the last dose of drug) 
In the post-treatment period, 3 placebo subjects and 2 rhPTH-treated subjects experienced a post-
treatment AE of hypercalcaemia. Among the rhPTH-treated subjects, 1 subject had a post-treatment 
TESAE of hypercalcaemia and 1 subject had a post-treatment AE of hypercalcaemia that led to 
discontinuation (ie, the event of hypercalcaemia was recorded 1 day after the date of the last dose of 
rhPTH[1-84]). In addition, although one of the placebo-treated subjects did not have an AE of 
hypercalcaemia per se, this subject had an ACSC level at Visit 16 of 3.17 mmol/L that was secondary 
to the post-treatment TESAE of dehydration and unrelated to study drug. 
Overall 
Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017 
Page 70/110 
 
  
Across all of the efficacy and safety studies in hypoparathyroidism there were 29/121 (24%) 
hypercalcaemia cases. There were no placebo-treated subjects and there was one rhPTH(1-84)-treated 
subject with an on-treatment serious adverse event of hypercalcaemia. 
Of the 8 subjects (2 placebo- and 6 PTH-treated subjects) who participated in additional studies, one 
had further episodes of hypercalcaemia. 
Long-term 
Table 18 shows that also in the 52 week period from week 52 to week 104 hypercalcaemia was 
reported as a TEAE in 4.3% (2 patients) of the population and from week 104 to week 156 in 7.1% (3 
patients) of the population. 
In the open label RACE study, in total, seven subjects experienced 11 treatment-emergent adverse 
events of hypercalcemia or blood calcium increased since baseline. Seven events were considered 
related to study drug by the investigators, 2 events resulted in an interruption of study drug in addition 
to a reduction in study drug dosing, 2 events resulted in dose reduction and other medication change, 
and 3 events resulted in an interruption of study drug and a change in other medication. All events of 
hypercalcemia (11/11) were mild or moderate and eventually resolved. 
Hypercalcaemia rarely occurs in the reference treatment (oral calcium and vit D derivatives) and can 
have serious clinical consequences. Also at the end of the stable period in the placebo controlled study 
and in the long-term open-label study TEAE of hypercalcaemia are reported. 
Moreover, serum [Ca2+] levels were measured pre-dose. Only in study CL1-11-040 at visit 13 serum 
[Ca2+] levels were measured 6-10 hrs post dose, when serum [Ca2+] levels are higher after rhPTH 
treatment. 35/75 subjects are shown to be hypercalcaemic at 6-10hrs post dose i.e. serum [Ca2+] 
>2.55mmol/L. Two subjects in the rhPTH group had ACSC ≥ 3.00 mmol/L and 5 had ACSC ≥ 2.95 
mmol/L. This illustrates the high incidence of hypercalcaemia in the rhPTH treated group, although 
only 5 hypercalcaemia related events were reported in 3 subjects in the following week. In the placebo 
group there was one patient with ACSC >2.55mmol/L 6-12 hours post dose (2.65 mmol/L).  Post-dose 
hypercalcaemia, based on (post-dose) ACSC, has not been adequately investigated by the Applicant. 
No TEAEs of nephrocalcinosis or nephrolithiasis were reported during the on-treatment phase for any 
subject who had hypercalcaemia. This should however be followed on the long-term. 
Hypocalcaemia 
Double-blind, placebo-controlled Study CL1-11-040 
Optimization period 
During the optimization period, 7/84 (8.3%) subjects (15 events) who were eventually randomized to 
rhPTH and 3/40 (7.5%) subjects (4 events) who were eventually randomized to placebo experienced 
an AE of hypocalcaemia. Of these 10 subjects, 6 subjects also had on-treatment AEs of hypocalcaemia. 
Titration period 
During the titration period, hypocalcemic events occurred more frequently in the placebo-treated 
subjects than in the rhPTH-treated subjects.  Both the treatment emergent adverse events and the 
ACSC laboratory values support this trend: 9/84 (10.7%) rhPTH subjects and 7/40 (17.5%) placebo 
subjects experienced an event of hypocalcaemia; ACSC values < 1.88 mmol/L, occurred in 12/81 
(14.8%) rhPTH subjects and 12/37 (32.4%) placebo subjects; ACSC values between 1.88 mmol/L and 
< 2.0 mmol/L occurred in 36/81 (44.4%) rhPTH subjects and 31/37 (83.8%) placebo subjects during 
this time period. 
Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017 
Page 71/110 
 
  
More subjects in the placebo arm had hypocalcaemia, which can be attributed to the protocol-
mandated reduction in oral calcium and active vitamin D. 
Stable period 
In the stable period, only down-titration of rhPTH(1-84) was allowed and adjustments to oral calcium 
and active vitamin D were made as needed. 19/84 (22.5%) subjects in the rhPTH group experienced 
29 AEs of hypocalcaemia compared to 4/40 (10.0%) subjects (4 events) in the placebo group; ACSC 
values < 1.88 mmol/L, occurred in 17/79 (21.5%) subjects in the rhPTH group and 5/33 (15.2%) 
subjects in the placebo group; values between 1.88 mmol/L and < 2.0 mmol/L occurred in 35/79 
(44.3%) rhPTH subjects and 14/33 (42.4%) placebo subjects during this time period. The incidence 
rate per subject per visit of ACSC < 1.88 mmol/L is 10.8%, which means that 1 out of 10 subject visit 
of patients in the PTH group presented ACSC values < 1.88 mmol/L, compared to 6 out of 100 in the 
placebo group. 
As explained by the Applicant, several factors might account for this. First, the rhPTH(1-84) subjects 
had experienced reductions or elimination of oral calcium and active vitamin D supplementation in the 
titration period whereas placebo subjects increased their calcium and active vitamin D supplementation 
back towards their baseline level in the later phase of the titration period. After Week 5, rhPTH(1-84) 
subjects were not allowed to increase their rhPTH(1-84) dose to compensate for their loss in oral 
calcium and active vitamin D supplementation. Indeed, 5 of the 19 subjects with ACSC-assessed 
hypocalcaemia had to remain at a dose less than 100 μg of rhPTH(1-84) despite ACSC-proven 
hypocalcaemia. 
Another factor to consider is the decrease in 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels seen in the rhPTH(1-84) 
subject group. One of the actions of PTH is to convert 25-hydroxyvitamin-D into the active 
1,25(OH) 2D. In the presence of low levels of inactive vitamin D this conversion may have been less 
productive, thus, contributing to hypocalcaemia. Nine of the 17 subjects assessed with hypocalcaemia 
based on a central laboratory value of ACSC < 1.88 mmol/L had a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of less 
than 75 nmol/L at the time of the event, a level assumed to be the lower range of normal 25-
hydroxyvitamin D in blood. 
Events occurring in this phase of the study were generally of short duration and were easily managed 
by adjustment of oral supplements. Four PTH-treated subjects experienced on-treatment  
hypocalcaemia that required treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate. The albumin-corrected 
total serum calcium levels for these subjects at or around the time of the event ranged from 1.75 to 
1.92 mmol/L. All of the events were considered to be SAEs or significant events. All of the events were 
resolved by the end of study. 
During the overall on-treatment period, there were 40 reports of ACSC < 1.88 mmol/L in rhPTH(1-84)-
treated subjects. Of these, 6 (15.0%) were associated with hypoparathyroidism symptoms within ±7 
days of the reported occurrence. During this time period, there were 36 reports of ACSC < 1.88 
mmol/L in the placebo group. Six (16.7%) of these events were associated with hypoparathyroidism 
symptoms. 
Post-treatment 
After discontinuation of study drug, subjects were followed up for an additional 4 weeks in the post-
treatment period. 27/84 (32.1%) rhPTH(1-84)-treated subjects (31 times) and 4/40 (10.0%) placebo-
treated subjects (4 times) experienced hypocalcaemia. In 3 rhPTH(1-84)-treated subjects and in 1 
placebo subject, the post-treatment hypocalcaemia was considered moderate or severe, and in each of 
these subjects the AE of hypocalcaemia required treatment with IV calcium gluconate. Albumin-
corrected total serum calcium levels for these subjects ranged from 1.47 to 1.97 mmol/L at or around 
the time of the event. All of the events were considered to be SAEs or significant events. With the 
Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017

exception of Subject 8002-0008, all of the events were resolved by the end of study. Two additional 
subjects in the PTH group had moderate post-treatment events of hypocalcaemia reported in the 
safety databases. All of the events were considered to be SAEs or significant adverse events. Serum 
calcium levels at the time of the events ranged from 1.40 to 1.90 mmol/L. All events resolved following 
administration of IV calcium gluconate. 
This underlines that discontinuation or interruption of rhPTH(1-84) treatment in hypoparathyroidism 
subjects needs to be accompanied by reinstitution of supplements in sufficient doses and frequent 
monitoring of serum calcium. 
The occurrence of hypocalcaemia is a major concern in non-compliant patients. Even upon drug 
discontinuation with reinstitution of supplements in sufficient doses and frequent monitoring of serum 
calcium, moderate or severe cases of hypocalcaemia requiring treatment with IV calcium occurred. 
Overall 
Across all of the efficacy and safety studies in hypoparathyroidism, 41/121 (39.9%) rhPTH-treated 
subjects experienced an on-treatment AE of hypocalcaemia. No subject had an on-treatment AE of 
hypocalcaemia which led to discontinuation. 
According to the Applicant, there was no apparent subject demographic or clinical feature (including 
25[OH] vitamin D levels) that distinguished subjects with hypocalcaemia AEs from the general study 
populations. 
Long-term 
Table 18 shows that also in the 52 week period from week 52 to week 104 hypocalcaemia was 
reported as a TEAE in 19.1% (9 patients) of the population and from week 104 to week 156 in 4.8% (2 
patients) of the population. 
In the ongoing open-label study PAR-C10-008, study drug titration in both directions was allowed 
throughout the study, as of the data cutoff date of 03 January 2014, 17/49 (34.7%) subjects reported 
31 AEs of hypocalcaemia and/or blood calcium decreased. Most of the events were transient in nature 
ranging between 1 and 34 days duration, with the majority having a duration of 10 days or less. There 
were 8 subjects who had events that were of longer duration or still ongoing at the time of data cut-off 
(03 January 2014). Only 2 subjects had events occurring within the first 3 months of the study, the 
others occurred well after initiation of treatment in the study. Two additional subjects experienced 
hypocalcaemia between 03 January 2014 and 30 September 2014. 
Looking at ACSC values in the on-treatment period of Study PAR-C10-008, there were 28 reports of 
ACSC < 1.88 mmol/L and 5 of these (17.9%) were associated with symptoms of hypoparathyroidism 
within ±7 days of the reported value. 
In the stable period of the Replace study, hypocalcaemia rates in the stable phase for both the AE and 
ACSC criteria were higher in the rhPTH(1-84) subjects than in placebo subjects. 
Hypercalciuria 
For the entire titration period of the replace trial, 8/84 (9.5%) rhPTH(1-84) subjects and 3/40 (7.5%) 
placebo subjects reported 1 AE of hypercalciuria. Hypercalciuria defined as 24-hour urinary calcium ≥  
7.5 mmol/24 hr occurred in 56/81 (69.1%) rhPTH(1-84) subjects and 17/37 (45.9%) in placebo 
subjects. 
In the titration period, hypercalciuria AEs and hypercalciura rates based on 24-hour urine calcium 
levels were lower in the placebo subjects paralleling the concomitant decrease in serum calcium and 
driven by the down titration of active vitamin D supplement. 
Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017 
Page 73/110 
 
  
During the stable period of the replace trial, more rhPTH(1-84)-treated subjects (8/84 (9.5%)) had an 
AE of hypercalciuria then placebo subjects (2/40 (5.0%)). 
Also hypercalciuria defined as 24-hour urinary calcium ≥  7.5 mmol/24 hr occurred more often in 
rhPTH(1-84) subjects (42/79 (53.2%)) than in placebo subjects (13/33 (39.4%)). 
For both treatment groups there was an overall decrease in 24-hour urine calcium excretion. Levels 
were: -1.99 (±4.85) mmol/24 hr in the rhPTH(1-84) group and -2.28 (±4.27) mmol/24 hr in the 
placebo group (p=0.439). 
At Week 24, a slightly lower percentage of subjects in the rhPTH(1-84) group (34%, 25/74) compared 
to the placebo group (39%, 13/33) had 24-hour urine calcium excretion > 7.5mmol/24 hours. 
Persistence of the effect on urinary calcium excretion is seen in long-term study, PAR-C10-008. 
Table 18 shows that also in the 52 week period from week 52 to week 104 hypercalciuria was reported 
as a TEAE in 6.4% (3 patients) of the population and from week 104 to week 156 in 2.4% (1 patient) 
of the population. 
The long-term clinical effects of the lack of reduction of urine calcium concentrations by the treatment, 
the increased incidence of hypercalciuria AEs relative to placebo and 10% of patients having persistent 
hypercalciuria are not known. 
Vital signs and cardiovascular safety 
In general, across the efficacy and safety studies in hypoparathyroidism, the means, medians, and 
ranges for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse and respiration rate, and temperature were 
similar at baseline and endpoint. Most of the instances of markedly abnormal values were associated 
with blood pressure or pulse rate, and were similarly distributed between the rhPTH(1-84) and 
placebo-treated subjects in the placebo-controlled studies. 
Since elevations in serum calcium will cause a known shortening of the QTc interval and PTH is 
administered as a replacement therapy, no thorough QT study is requested. The extent of QTc 
shortening observed in subjects treated with rhPTH(1-84) is far less than the extent of shortening in 
the arrhythmogenic congenital short QT syndrome (SQTS). No subjects in clinical studies in 
hypoparathyroidism had QTcF values below the lower limit of normal (< 370 ms)and none had a short 
QT related arrhythmia, whereas one subject in the placebo group had a treatment emergent finding of 
atrial fibrillation. SQTS is caused by gain of function potassium channelopathies not related to cardiac 
calcium channels. It is unlikely that the on treatment QTcF values, which are in the normal range, 
would incur an increased risk of arrhythmia. There is no evidence for such an acquired or drug-induced 
short QT syndrome. Furthermore, rhPTH(1-84) had no effects on PR and QRS.  
There is concern that the company has not investigated the immediate effect of hypercalcaemia (for 
instance by recording continuous ECG) but the risk of post-dose hypercalcaemia is currently mitigated 
by close monitoring as described in the SmPC (see clinical section of the report).   
Renal and urinary disorders 
Hypercalciuria is discussed above. 
In the Replace study, pollakiuria occurred in 3 PTH-treated subjects (3.6%) and in one placebo-treated 
subject. In PAR-C10-007 it was reported in 3 subjects, it was not reported in PAR-C10-008 or PAR-
C10-009. Given that rhPTH(1-84) increases serum calcium in hypoparathyroidism subjects just 
initiating treatment, transient pollakiuria could be an expected occurrence in some subjects. 
Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017 
Page 74/110 
 
  
 
Nephrolithiasis was reported in 2 subjects in Study PAR-C10-008 in the efficacy and safety studies in 
hypoparathyroidism. 
Apart from effects expected from the mechanism of action of rhPTH(1-84), no renal-related AEs in 
rhPTH(1-84)-treated subjects have been indicated. 
The currently provided data are, however, insufficient to assess the long-term effects of this treatment 
on renal damage. 
Injection site reactions 
Injection site reactions occurred in 0 to 13% of the PTH-treated subjects, were mild to moderate in 
severity and none was considered serious or lead to discontinuation of the treatment. Mild injection 
site hematoma, injection site swelling, and injection site erythema were reported. 
Overdosage 
Cases of overdose or accidental overdose were usually the consequence of misunderstanding that 
resulted in misuse or misoperation of the Ypsomed injection pen. There were no cases of overdose with 
the Q-Cliq currently in use in the ongoing long-term study. Hypercalcaemia and/or hypercalciuria were 
reported for the majority of subjects who had a TEAE of overdose or accidental overdose of rhPTH(1-
84). In most cases, the serum calcium did not exceed 3.3 mmol/L, study drug was temporarily 
interrupted, additional education provided, and the adverse event resolved. 
Withdrawal 
The post-treatment phase of the placebo-controlled study CL1-11-040 and Study PAR-C10-009 in 
hypoparathyroidism which included a protocol-specified post-treatment phase, provides the most 
accurate assessment of withdrawal effects. 
In Study CL1-11-040, there were more rhPTH(1-84)-treated subjects than placebo-treated subjects 
who reported post-treatment TEAEs of paresthesia (21.4% rhPTH[1-84], 5.0% placebo), 
hypocalcaemia (26.2% rhPTH[1-84], 7.5% placebo), and tetany (11.9% rhPTH[1-84], 0 placebo). All 
other post-treatment TEAEs reported among the 84 rhPTH(1-84)-treated subjects in Study CL1-11-040 
were reported in 3 (3.6%) or fewer subjects. 
The post-treatment cases of hypocalcaemia upon treatment discontinuation are discussed above, 
under the hypocalcaemia section. 
Pen complaints 
The pen ultimately proposed for marketing is the Haselmeier pen. The delivery systems used for the 
hypoparathyroidism program were the Ypsomed pen injector and the Haselmeier pen injector (also 
referred to as Shire Q-cliq pen in this report)). The Ypsomed pen was used in the studies in 
hypoparathyroidism (Studies CL1-11-040, PAR-C10-007, PAR-C10-008, and PAR-C10-009). The Q-Cliq 
system is currently being used in the ongoing study, PAR-C10-008. 
Across all Efficacy and Safety Studies, there were 0.286 complaints per 100 injections associated with 
use of the Ypsomed pen and 0.069 complaints per 100 injections associated with the Q-Cliq system. 
The majority of complaints were dose counter problems, dose activator problems, leaking medication, 
cartridge problems and dose knob problems. With the Ypsomed pen there were 28.4 TEAEs that were 
possibly related to pen complaints per 100 patient years exposure, for Q-Cliq this was 1.2 per 100 
patient years. 
Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017 
Page 75/110 
 
  
 
 
The simulated use validation study PAR-C12-003 shows there is a risk for underdosing with the 
Haselmeier pen following incorrect use of the pen. Underdosing can be corrected by intake of oral 
Calcium and active vitamin D supplements following the appearance of symptoms. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
No deaths occurred in the clinical pharmacology studies or the efficacy and safety studies in 
hypoparathyroidism. 
There were 12 rhPTH(1-84)-treated subjects (9.9%) who experienced a total of 20 on-treatment 
TESAEs through 20 June 2014. 
In the placebo-controlled study REPLACE CL 1-11-40, 5/84 (6.0%) rhPTH(1-84)-treated subjects 
experienced 7 on-treatment treatment-emergent serious adverse events, including back pain, cellulitis, 
cerebrovascular accident, diarrhea, diverticulitis, hypercalcaemia, and vomiting. None of these on-
treatment TESAEs were reported in more than 1 subject. The single on-treatment TESAE that first 
occurred during the titration period (ie, the initial 12 weeks of treatment) was hypercalcaemia. All on-
treatment TESAEs except for 1 episode of hypercalcaemia were considered not related to study drug 
by the investigator. 
Two of 40 subjects (5.0%) treated with placebo experienced on-treatment TESAEs (‘bronchospasm and 
obstruction’ in one subject and epididymal tenderness in another). 
Seven of 49 (14.3%) subjects in the open-label extension Study PAR-C10-008, experienced on-
treatment TESAEs. These events included lung adenocarcinoma metastatic, rectal cancer, fracture 
(x2), and viral infection in 1 subject each, syncope, dyspnea, chest discomfort, and throat tightness in 
the same subject, gastroenteritis and hypocalcaemia both in the same subject, and cholelithiasis and 
cholecystitis both in the same subject. None of these events was considered by the investigator to be 
related to study drug. 
Studies CL1-11-040 and PAR-C10-009 both included a protocol-specified post-treatment phase. During 
the post-treatment phase of Study CL1-11-040, there were 4 rhPTH(1-84)-treated subjects and 2 
placebo subjects who experienced a TESAE. Among the rhPTH(1-84)-treated subjects, the post-
treatment TESAEs included hypocalcaemia (2 subjects), hypercalcaemia (1 subject), and pancreatic 
disorders not elsewhere classified (1 subject). The post-treatment TESAE of hypercalcaemia occurred 7 
days after the last dose of study drug was administered and the investigator indicated that the event 
may have been caused by an adjustment in the dose of active vitamin D post study termination. The 
post-treatment TESAEs reported by placebo subjects included hypocalcaemia and dehydration. 
Due to the low frequency of on-treatment TESAEs in the studies, there were no obvious trends with 
respect to the time of first occurrence. 
Osteosarcoma 
Osteosarcoma is a rare cancer with an estimated incidence of 1.7 to 4.4 per million, depending on age. 
The peak incidence occurs in male adolescents. There is a secondary peak incidence in the elderly. 
Among the elderly, osteosarcoma often represents a secondary neoplasm, such as that which occurs 
with the transformation of Paget's disease of bone. Irradiation has also noted to be a risk factor 
associated with osteosarcoma in the elderly. 
A potential risk of osteosarcoma has been described for Forsteo (teriparatide; rhPTH(1-34). Use of 
teriparatide for more than 2 years is not recommended. 
Two case reports of osteosarcoma in patients using teriparatide (rhPTH(1-34)) have been identified. 
One patient was a postmenopausal woman in her 70s with a complex past medical history. The history 
included osteoporosis with vertebral fractures, and she was treated with teriparatide in a manner 
Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017 
Page 76/110 
 
  
consistent with the label. Sometime after beginning her second year of teriparatide therapy, she was 
found to have metastatic cancer. The primary cancer site was never identified. The diagnosis included 
several tumor types, including an osteosarcoma. 
Causality between teriparatide and the osteosarcoma in this patient cannot be established. This was a 
single case of >250,000 patients in the United States and >300,000 patients worldwide treated with 
teriparatide, the patient had a complex medical history, and the background incidence of osteosarcoma 
in the general population of men and women ≥ 60 years of age is 1 in 250,000 per year. (1.7 to 4.4 
per million depending on age). Given the known incidence in the general population, very rare cases of 
osteosarcoma can be expected, irrespective of treatment with teriparatide. [Harper et al, 2007] 
The second patient, a 67-year-old man, with potential teriparatide-induced osteosarcoma was 
complicated by a history of pelvic radiation. Given the location of the sarcoma within the field of 
radiation and the limited exposure to teriparatide before diagnosis (approximately 2 months), it is 
unlikely that teriparatide played the predominant role in the emergence of this patient’s osteosarcoma. 
The investigators cannot, however, exclude the possibility that teriparatide magnified the carcinogenic 
effect of radiation therapy to induce the osteosarcoma. [Subbiah et al, 2010]. 
In the FDA adverse event reporting system, 8 cases of osteosarcoma were identified with a history of 
teriparatide use prior to the initial diagnosis of osteosarcoma. Pathology results consistent with a 
diagnosis of osteosarcoma were provided for 4 of the 8 cases. The history of previous radiation therapy 
was noted in two of eight cases. It is difficult to draw conclusions on the causality based on limited 
data, but there are at least 4 reported cases on a population estimated to be less than 1 million, i.e. 
more than the background incidence rate. Therefore an increased risk for osteosarcoma cannot be 
excluded in the osteoporosis population and given the non-clinical data, consequently neither in the 
hypoparathyroid population. 
Based on experience with parathyroid hormone related products, there is concern that long-term 
exposure to Natpar may be associated with the development of osteosarcoma. Beyond routine 
pharmacovigilance, this concern is being addressed in the SmPC section 4.3 by contraindicating the 
use of the product for patient groups with a potentially higher risk to develop an osteosarcoma and by 
a warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC against the use of the product in young adults. Cases of 
osteosarcoma would also be captured in the registry, agreed with the applicant as a post authorization 
measure, however the extremely low incidence of osteosarcoma makes any conclusions to be likely 
very limited.  
Laboratory findings 
Consistent with the known pharmacologic effects of rhPTH(1-84) on mineral homeostasis, there were 
changes, sometimes marked, in calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels in blood, serum, and/or 
urine. 
In addition, a full range of haematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis testing was performed, and 
there were no clinically meaningful trends or observations suggestive of a safety concern with 
rhPTH(1-84) treatment. 
There was no suggestion that rhPTH(1-84) causes drug-induced liver injury. 
There were no cases that met the criteria for Hy’s law (cases of drug-induced liver injury) across the 
entire development program. 
In the placebo-controlled Efficacy and Safety Study in Hypoparathyroidism, no markedly abnormal 
treatment-emergent aminotransferase or bilirubin elevations or treatment-emergent liver-related AEs 
occurred in subjects treated with rhPTH(1-84). Likewise in Studies PAR-C10-007, PAR-C10-008, and 
Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017 
Page 77/110 
 
  
PAR-C10-009, the frequency of categorical aminotransferase elevations was relatively low and mild 
except for 1 subject with viral hepatitis. 
There were no renal-related AEs or abnormalities in renal function tests or urinalysis tests apart from 
changes expected from the mechanism of action of rhPTH(1-84). In the placebo-controlled trial, CL1-
11-040, creatinine clearance (estimated glomerular filtration rate) was relatively stable and no 
subjects had severe decreases or had results indicating end-stage renal disease.  
The influence of PTH on bone mineral density and bone turnover markers is discussed in the efficacy 
section of this report. 
Following a comment on PK data, the safety aspects of the accumulation of C-terminal PTH were 
discussed by the Applicant. C-terminal PTH fragments are not expected to accumulate chronically in 
most patients. Currently the possible safety consequences of such accumulation are not known. Any 
potential effect could be counterbalanced by PTH effect. 
Safety in special populations 
Gender 
No clinically relevant gender differences in TEAE rates were observed in the efficacy and safety studies 
in hypoparathyroidism. However, the majority of the patient population were females. 
Age 
Since there were very few subjects ≥  65 years of age (N=6 (5%)) and no subjects ≥  75 years of age 
in the efficacy and safety studies in hypoparthyroidism, no conclusions can be made regarding 
differences in the incidence of on-treatment TEAEs by age. 
Safety in elderly will remain a topic for further investigation in the RMP. 
Race 
There were very few Black subjects and subjects of other races in the efficacy and safety studies in 
hypoparathyroidism. 
The lack of non-Caucasian subjects in the clinical safety database will remain a topic for further 
investigation in the RMP. 
Pregnancy and lactation 
The rhPTH(1-84) development program did not include pregnant women or lactating women. 
Animal studies do not indicate harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity at clinically relevant 
exposures. 
It is unknown whether rhPTH(1-84) is excreted in human milk. In rats, mean PTH(1-84) concentration 
in milk ranged from approximately 1.6 to 10.2 ng/mL at doses of 300 and 1000 mcg/kg/day. This 
resulted in plasma to milk concentration ratios of 2 to 42 with an overall mean ratio of 14. 
Immunological events 
Samples for assay of antibodies to parathyroid hormone and E. coli protein (host cell protein) were 
collected in: 
•  1 pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study: 
Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017 
Page 78/110 
 
  
 
Study C09-002 
•  4 efficacy and safety studies sponsored by NPS: 
Study CL1-11-040 (REPLACE) 
Study PAR-C10-007 (RELAY) 
Study PAR-C10-008 (RACE) 
Study PAR-C10-009 (REPEAT) 
•  1 investigator-initiated trial (Bilezikian IIT) 
The 6 studies used to investigate immunogenicity are described below: 
Study C09-002 
This was an open-label, escalating, single-dose study to assess the PK and PD parameters of rhPTH(1-
84) administered subcutaneously to 7 subjects with hypoparathyroidism. Subjects received single 
doses of rhPTH(1-84) 50 and 100 μg in Treatment Periods 1 and 2, respectively, with a 7-day washout 
period between treatment periods. 
Serum samples were assayed for antibodies to rhPTH(1-84) using the Quest assay only once, predose 
in Treatment Period 1. One subject out of 7 subjects that completed the study had a positive screen for 
PTH antibodies prior to treatment administration. PK results for this subject were similar in periods 1 
and 2. 
Study C09-002 is not considered to be informative with regards to antibody development because this 
study employed the Quest assay for antibody detection. 
Study CL1-11-040 (REPLACE) [main study for application] 
This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study to investigate the use of 
rhPTH(1-84), for a 24-week treatment period for the treatment of adults with hypoparathyroidism. 
•  Antibodies to rhPTH(1-84) were measured by both Quest and Tandem. 
• 
The blood samples taken at Visit 5 (baseline), prior to treatment with rhPTH(1-84), Visit 16 
(post-treatment at 24 weeks) and follow-up Visit 18 (at Week 28, 4 weeks after stopping 
rhPTH[1-84] treatment) were analyzed by Quest Laboratories. 
•  A new method was developed to ensure that the assay technology used for PTH antibody 
testing conformed to FDA standards. A decision was made to use a new, validated MSD assay 
developed by Tandem Labs. This assay became available in January 2011 and was used to 
assay available samples for antibodies to PTH from 34 rhPTH(1-84) subjects and 17 placebo 
subjects at Visit 16 and/or Visit 18.  
•  Assays for antibodies with neutralizing activity (NAB) were not done as the method was not yet 
validated. 
•  Antibodies to ECP were not done as the ECP assay (TNJR11-019) required a baseline for each 
subject. A baseline was needed as the subjects may already have a high signal (being exposed 
to ECPs) prior to entering the trial. The signal is determined by the subtraction of the predose 
from the postdose values. 
• 
It has been acknowledged (in the methods section of this assessment report) that the current 
product has had a long development programme, that regulatory standards and assays change 
Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017

and improve and that the company has had to change assays to cater for changes in 
requirements over time. It is noted, however, that  samples for analysis at a later date had not 
been retained (to test for neutralising antibodies, antibodies to ECP and to test all samples 
using the Tandem laboratory method).  
Antibodies to PTH detected by the Tandem assay are presented in the following table: 
Table 17 Number (%) of subjects in study CL1-11-040 with PTH Antibodies based on the 
Tandem MSD assay 
4 samples were classified as specific (positive for immune-depletion) to antibodies to PTH. Titres are 
reported as the log10 of the reciprocal dilution which is derived from the interpolation of the dilution at 
the assay specific cut point. All titres were <2. 
Assays for neutralising antibodies and ECP antibodies were not done. 
The incomplete nature of the testing strategy hinders full interpretation of results. 
Study PAR-C10-007 (RELAY) 
Study PAR-C10-007 (RELAY) was a randomized, double-blind study to investigate the safety and 
efficacy of rhPTH(1-84) at fixed doses of 25 μg and 50 μg SC daily for the treatment of 42 adults with 
hypoparathyroidism. 
Serum samples were assayed for antibodies to rhPTH(1-84) and ECP at baseline and at Week 8. 
Samples were analyzed by both Quest (35 subjects at baseline and 31 subjects at Week 8) and 
Tandem (40 subjects were tested, 36 subjects at baseline and 29 subjects at Week 8). 
Based on results obtained by the MSD method at Tandem Laboratories, 3 subjects previously treated 
with rhPTH(1-84) and 2 subjects previously not treated or treated with placebo had specific antibodies 
to PTH at baseline. Three of these subjects (2 previously drug, 1 previously not treated) remained 
positive at Week 8. All of the samples had very low titers. No subjects had antibodies with neutralizing 
activity. Similar to overall responder rate of about 22% in this study, 1 of the 5 (20%) subjects with 
specific antibodies to PTH was an efficacy responder. 
Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017 
Page 80/110 
 
  
 
 
 
 
8 samples in 6 subjects that tested positive for ECP: specificity for ECP antibodies was not collected in 
this study. 
No subjects had a systemic hypersensitivity reaction or any immunogenicity-related event in this 
study. No subjects with specific antibodies to PTH had injection site reactions in this study. 
The incomplete nature of the testing strategy hinders the overall assessment. 
Study PAR-C10-008 (RACE) 
Study PAR-C10-008 (RACE) is an ongoing long-term, open-label clinical extension study investigating 
the safety and tolerability of rhPTH(1-84), for the treatment of adults with hypoparathyroidism. The 
subjects who enrolled in this study must have previously completed Study PAR-C10-007 (8 weeks of 
active therapy) and/or previously completed the 24 weeks of treatment in Study CL1-11-040. 
Samples for PTH and ECP antibody analysis are to be obtained at baseline (Visit 1, which used Week 8 
results from Study PAR-C10-007, if available), Weeks 24, 40, 52, every 6 months during the long-term 
extension, and at the End of Treatment visit.  
If any subject tests positive for PTH-specific antibodies at the final visit, they are to have follow-up 
blood draws for PTH antibodies at Months 2, 3, and 6 post-study. Antibodies to PTH, antibodies with 
neutralizing activity (NAB) and ECP were assayed by Tandem. 
As of the cut-off date of 03 January 2014, in the Tandem MSD assay, 9 of 52 subjects tested positive 
for specific antibodies to PTH, including 2 subjects who had specific antibodies only at baseline. 
Baseline data for these subjects are the results from Week 8 of Study PAR-C10-007. One of these nine 
subjects had antibodies with neutralizing activity and was not a responder at that moment. As of 30 
September 2014, in the Tandem Meso-Scale Discovery (MSD) assay, 10 of 49 subjects developed 
specific antibodies to PTH. The updated report describes four additional positive specific antibodies 
compared to the previous report. 
11 subjects returned positive results for specific antibodies to E. Coli Protein. 
Three of the subjects had specific antibodies to both ECP and to PTH in this study. 
Only one subject tested specific for ECP in Study PAR-C10-008 had an injection site reaction. No 
subjects with specific antibodies to PTH had injection site reactions in this study. Out of the 9 subjects 
who were positive specific antibodies to PTH in the PAR-C10-008 study, 3 (33%) had hypersensitivity 
reactions. Out of the 40 subjects who were not positive/specific for antibodies to PTH, 2 (5%) had 
hypersensitivity reactions. No subjects with specific antibodies to PTH or ECP had hypersensitivity 
reactions related to rhPTH(1-84) in this study as of the cut-off date of 03 January 2014. 
There does not seem to be an association between development of antibodies and clinical consequence 
such as hypersensitivity reaction in the RACE study. 
Study PAR-C10-009 (REPEAT) 
Study PAR-C10-009 (REPEAT) was a 6-month open-label clinical extension study investigating the 
safety and tolerability of rhPTH(1-84) for the treatment of 24 adults with hypoparathyroidism. All 
subjects enrolled in this study were from 3 study centres located in Hungary and had previously been 
enrolled in Study CL1-11-040. 
Samples were obtained for testing for PTH antibodies at baseline and at EOT (Week 24). If any subject 
tested positive for PTH-specific antibodies at the final visit, they were to have follow-up blood draws for 
PTH antibodies at Months 2, 3, and 6 post-study. 
Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017 
Page 81/110 
 
  
All 24 subjects who enrolled in the study completed treatment and had antibody testing performed by 
the (Quest and) Tandem assay. 
5 subjects returned positive results for antibodies to PTH; there were 2 subjects at baseline and 4 
subjects at 24 weeks who tested positive and specific.  One of these subjects tested positive for 
antibodies with neutralizing activity at Week 24, but not at baseline in this study and not in the 
previous study (CL1-11-040). At Week 24 this subject was a responder. 
None of the subjects who tested specific to antibodies against PTH experienced injection site reactions, 
a systemic hypersensitivity reaction or any immunogenicity-related event in this study. No subjects in 
this study had injection site reactions. With the exception of one subject, who had received placebo in 
REPLACE (Study CL1-11-040) and did not respond in either study, all subjects who had specific 
antibodies to PTH were responders, including a subject with antibodies with neutralizing activity. Using 
the MSD method for the presence of antibodies to ECP (TNJR11-196), all subjects had negative results 
for antibodies to ECP. 
There does not seem to be an association between development of antibodies and clinical consequence 
such as hypersensitivity reaction in the REPEAT study. 
Bilezikian investigator-initiated trial 
The ongoing Bilezikian IIT enrolled subjects who participated in a series of ongoing, prospective, open-
label, investigator-initiated, sequential trials and extensions conducted under US IND 070449. The 
Principal Investigator of the study is John P. Bilezikian c/o Columbia University USA. The study was 
carried out to investigate the effects of rhPTH(1-84) replacement on bone structure in 
hypoparathyroidism. The study began on 16 August 2004 and consisted of a pilot study, an initial 2-
year trial and subsequent extensions. 90 subjects have been enrolled by 3rd Jan 2014. 
Antibody collection was started in July 2013 i.e. late addition to protocol. Therefore data on antibodies 
are only available for 11 of the 90 subjects. These subjects received the study drug prior to assay for 1 
to 8.5 years. One of these 11 subjects had specific antibodies to PTH as of the cut-off date of 03 
January 2014. 
No subjects had hypersensitivity reactions associated with PTH as of the cut-off date. 
Overall Results from Studies CL1-11-040, PAR-C10-007, PAR-C10-008 and PAR-C10-009 
None of the subjects in the 4 NPS-sponsored safety and efficacy studies who tested specific to 
antibodies against PTH had a systemic hypersensitivity reaction related to rhPTH(1-84) or any 
immunogenicity-related event related to rhPTH(1-84) when antibodies specific to PTH were present. 
1 subject in these 4 studies (in Study CL1-11-040) had an injection site reaction 
(haematoma/bruising) when specific antibodies to PTH were present. This subject had specific 
antibodies to PTH in Study PAR-C10-008 at Week 52 but not previously in this study and did not have 
injection site reactions in this study. 
11/117 subjects (9.4%) in studies PAR-C10-007, PAR-C10-008 and PAR-C10-009 were found to have 
antibodies to ECP. (cut-off 03 January 2014) 
Although antibodies to study drug and E. Coli Protein were detected only in low titre and although 
there does not seem to be any clinical consequence of antibody development, the number of results is 
small and the testing strategy incomplete over all 4 clinical studies. In addition, there is concern that 
the immunological response of those subjects who are hypoparathyroid for reasons other than post-
neck surgery will be different in type and magnitude from those who had hypoparathyroidism post-
Natpar - Assessment report

neck surgery. None of the recipients developed a systemic hypersensitivity reaction related to 
rhPTH(1-84).  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Among the Efficacy and Safety Studies in Hypoparathyroidism, there were few notable differences 
between the incidences of individual on-treatment adverse event preferred terms between rhPTH(1-
84) or placebo-treated subjects who did and did not receive a concomitant medication in a particular 
class. None of the observed differences was considered to be of sufficient clinical importance to impact 
labelling. 
The inotropic effects of digoxin are affected by serum calcium levels. Combined use of parathyroid 
hormone (rDNA) and cardiac glycosides (e.g., digoxin) may predispose patients to digitalis toxicity if 
hypercalcaemia develops. 
For any drug that affects serum calcium levels (e.g., lithium, fluoride thiazides), influence on patients’ 
serum calcium levels should be monitored. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
Clinical pharmacology studies 
The TEAEs leading to discontinuation included vomiting, nausea, syncope, hyperhidrosis (all in 1 
subject), and urticaria in another subject. One rhPTH(1-84)-treated subject, had elevated liver function 
tests that were not recorded as an AE, but led to study discontinuation. 
There was 1 additional rhPTH(1-84)-treated subject who experienced a pruritic rash (judged by the 
investigator to be related to the study drug) the day after dosing in the first period of a crossover 
study and the subject did not receive study medication in the second dosing period. 
Efficacy and safety studies in hyperparathyroidism 
There were a total of 5 rhPTH-treated subjects who discontinued due to an on-treatment treatment-
emergent adverse event.  
Treatment-emergent AEs leading to discontinuation occurred in 3 subjects in the Replace study: rash 
(1 subject); cerebrovascular accident (1 subject); and arthralgia, anxiety symptoms, asthenia, 
cognition and attention disorders and disturbances, decreased appetite, depressive disorders, 
headaches, injection site reactions, nausea, pain in extremity, and tetany (all occurring in one 
subject). The only TEAE leading to discontinuation in the Relay study was arthralgia occurring in one 
subject. In the Race open-label extension study, one subject discontinued due to lung adenocarcinoma 
metastatic. No subjects discontinued in the Repeat Study. 
No events except for arthralgia (2 subjects) were reported by more than 1 subject in either study 
group. No subjects discontinued due to an on-treatment event of hypercalcaemia, hypocalcaemia, or 
hypercalciuria. There was 1 rhPTH(1-84)-treated subjects in the Replace study who experienced a 
TEAE that led to drug discontinuation 1 day after the last dose of treatment (hypercalcaemia). 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
In general, the assessment of the different safety aspects is sufficient on the short term (108 subjects 
that received at least 24 weeks of treatment), given the product’s orphan designation.  
There are only 47 patients with hypoparathyroidism with at least 1 year exposure and 41 patients 
treated for 3 years.  For a product that is intended for chronic use, for which no significant reduction in 
Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017 
Page 83/110 
 
  
urinary calcium has been demonstrated, for which there is a very high calcium fluctuation 24 hours 
post-dose and for which the mid-term effects of the QD drug administration are not known the number 
of patients receiving long term treatment is limited to draw conclusions on the long term (efficacy and) 
safety aspects. 
Hypercalcaemia-induced nephrotoxicity, soft tissue calcifications and end-organ damage, immunogenic 
effects, cardiovascular effects, effects on bone and osteosarcoma should be followed on the long term.  
The contribution of the data from the osteoporosis studies to the safety analysis in patients with 
hypoparathyroidism is very limited, given the differences between these populations with respect to 
sufficiency of parathyroid hormone, its implications on calcium and phosphate metabolism and the 
affected organs and body systems, the background morbidity and medications and the age. 
Adverse drug reactions 
The most common adverse drug reactions occurring with a frequency of more than 1 in 10 patients are 
signs and symptoms of hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia.  
Hypercalcaemia 
During the titration period of the placebo controlled Study CL1-11-040, hypercalcemic events occurred 
more frequently in the rhPTH(1 84)-treated subjects than in the placebo treated subjects.  Both the 
treatment emergent adverse events and the ACSC laboratory values support this trend. In the PTH 
group, one event was serious, resulting in an interruption of the study drug. All events resolved.  Four 
subjects in the PTH group had hypercalcaemia with a duration of more than 7 days (range 15 to 58 
days), 2 of these subjects interrupted their study drug regimen. 
This difference between placebo and rhPTH(1 84)-treated subjects can be partially explained based on 
the study protocol of the REPLACE study, there was an expected initial decrease in serum calcium in 
the placebo group and a trend toward higher serum calcium values in the PTH group. In the PTH 
group, both PTH and supplements have an effect on mineral homeostasis and need to be adapted, 
while placebo treated patients only had short-term reductions in their oral calcium and vitamin D 
supplements and quickly returned to their baseline supplements, by study design. 
The number of patients with hypercalcaemia in the titration period is high (14%). 
During the stable period of the placebo controlled Replace study, less hypercalcaemia was reported 
either as an AE or assessed by central laboratory values as compared to the titration period, but still, 
8/84 (9.5%) of rhPTH(1-84)-treated subjects had 8 AEs of hypercalcaemia, no AE were reported in the 
placebo group. In the PTH group one event was severe, which resulted in an interruption of the PTH 
dose and a subsequent reduction from 100 μg to 75 μg daily. 
Concomitantly, mean ACSC values returned to baseline in rhPTH(1 84) subjects during the stable 
period. 
The incidence of hypercalcaemia during the stable period is also elevated (9.5%). The occurrence of 
this adverse event is worrisome, because it has been observed in optimal monitoring conditions and in 
‘real live’ incidence could be higher and the outcome be more serious. This concern is therefore now 
addressed in a special warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC “Monitoring of patients during treatment” 
and in 2 detailed sections of the SmPC section 4.2 detailing needed measurements during as well as 
after initiation of treatment. Moreover, hypercalcaemia is rarely observed in the reference treatment 
(oral calcium and vit D derivative) and can have serious clinical consequences, making treatment with 
PTH less safe than the reference treatment in the currently proposed target population. 
Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017 
Page 84/110 
 
  
Moreover, serum [Ca2+] levels were measured pre-dose. Only in study CL1-11-040 at visit 13 serum 
[Ca2+] levels were measured 6-10 hrs after PTH dose administration, when serum [Ca2+] levels were 
shown to be about 0.25 mmol/L (max 0.7 mmol/L) higher than pre-dose levels. 
(Post-dose) hypercalcaemia, based on (post-dose) ACSC, has not been adequately investigated by the 
Applicant.  
Also on the longer term, in the 52 week period from week 52 to week 104 hypercalcaemia was 
reported as a TEAE in 4.3% (2 patients) of the population and from week 104 to week 156 in 7.1% (3 
patients) of the population. 
High risk patients will probably be elderly patients with renal insufficiency, subjects with a disease 
predisposing to hypercalcaemia (active neoplasia, multiple myeloma, granulomatous disease), people 
taking thiazide diuretics and those taking digoxin.  
No TEAEs of nephrocalcinosis or nephrolithiasis were reported during the on-treatment phase for any 
subject who had hypercalcaemia, however the number of patients on long-term treatment is limited. 
There is also a concern that the company has not investigated the immediate effect of hypercalcaemia 
(for instance by recording continuous ECG) and that the long-term clinical safety issues of wide 
fluctuations in serum [Ca++] over 24 hours after each administration are unknown.  
Hypocalcaemia 
During the titration period of the placebo controlled Study CL1-11-040, hypocalcaemic events occurred 
more frequently in the placebo-treated subjects than in the rhPTH(1 84)-treated subjects. Both the 
treatment emergent adverse events and the ACSC laboratory values support this trend. More subjects 
in the placebo arm had hypocalcaemia, which can be attributed to the protocol-mandated reduction in 
oral calcium and active vitamin D. 
In the stable period of the Replace study, hypocalcaemia rates for both the AE and ACSC criteria were 
higher in the rhPTH(1-84) subjects than in placebo subjects. (See MOs) Several factors might 
contribute to this increased incidence of hypocalcaemia in the PTH-treated group. After Week 5, 
rhPTH(1-84) subjects were not allowed to increase their rhPTH(1-84) dose to compensate for their loss 
in oral calcium and active vitamin D supplementation. (5 out of 19 patients) Another factor to consider 
is the decrease in 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels seen in the rhPTH(1-84) subject group. In the presence 
of low levels of inactive vitamin D its conversion to the active 1,25(OH)2D may have been less 
productive, thus, contributing to hypocalcaemia. 
Events occurring in this phase of the study were generally of short duration and were managed by 
adjustment of oral supplements. Four PTH-treated subjects experienced on-treatment hypocalcaemia 
that required treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate. All of the events were considered to be 
SAEs or significant events. All of the events were resolved by the end of study. 
Hypocalcaemia events also occurred on the longer-term. 
About 15% of the reports of < 1.88 mmol/L in rhPTH(1-84)-treated subjects were associated with 
hypoparathyroidism symptoms within ±7 days of the reported occurrence. 
During the post-treatment period, i.e. after drug discontinuation, 27/84 (32.1%) rhPTH(1-84)-treated 
subjects and 4/40 (10.0%) placebo-treated subjects experienced a post-treatment AE of 
hypocalcaemia. In 3 rhPTH(1-84)-treated subjects and in 1 placebo subject, the post-treatment 
hypocalcaemia was considered moderate or severe. Two additional subjects in the PTH group had 
moderate post-treatment events of hypocalcaemia reported in the safety databases. In each of these 
subjects the AE of hypocalcaemia required treatment with IV calcium gluconate. This suggests that 
discontinuation or interruption of rhPTH(1-84) treatment in hypoparathyroidism subjects needs to be 
Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017 
Page 85/110 
 
  
accompanied by reinstitution of supplements in sufficient doses and frequent monitoring of serum 
calcium. 
The occurrence of hypocalcaemia is a major concern in non-compliant patients. Even upon drug 
discontinuation with reinstitution of supplements in sufficient doses and frequent monitoring of serum 
calcium, moderate or severe cases of hypocalcaemia requiring treatment with IV calcium occurred.  
Renal and urinary disorders 
During the stable period of the replace trial, there were more AEs of hypercalciuria and events of 
hypercalciuria based on laboratory evaluations in the rh(PTH)(1-84)-treated subjects than in the 
placebo-treated subjects. The long-term clinical effects of the lack of reduction of urine calcium 
concentrations by the treatment, the increased incidence of hypercalciuria relative to placebo and 10% 
of patients having persistent hypercalciuria are not known. 
Osteosarcoma 
Two case reports of osteosarcoma in patients using teriparatide (rhPTH(1-34)) have been identified in 
literature. In the FDA adverse event reporting system, 8 cases of osteosarcoma were identified in 
patients with a history of teriparatide use. Pathology results consistent with a diagnosis of 
osteosarcoma were provided for 4 of the 8 cases. 
Causality between teriparatide use and osteosarcoma cannot be established in these case reports. 
Teriparatide might magnify the effect of radiation therapy to induce osteosarcoma. There are at least 4 
reported cases on a population estimated to be less than 1 million, i.e. more than the background 
incidence rate. Therefore an increased risk for osteosarcoma cannot be excluded in the osteoporosis 
population and given the non-clinical data, consequently neither in the hypoparathyroid population. 
Based on experience with parathyroid hormone related products, there is concern that long-term 
exposure to Natpar may be associated with the development of osteosarcoma. Beyond routine 
pharmacovigilance, this concern is being addressed in the SmPC section 4.3 by contraindicating the 
use of the product for patient groups with a potentially higher risk to develop an osteosarcoma and by 
a warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC against the use of the product in young adults.  
Pen (complaints) accordance 
The pen proposed for marketing is the Haselmeier pen (Q-Cliq), which is used in the RACE trial. The 
Ypsomed pen was used in the majority of the efficacy and safety studies. There were less complaints 
with the Haselmeier pen than with the Ypsomed pen in these studies. 
The simulated use validation study PAR-C12-003 shows there is a risk for underdosing with the 
Haselmeier pen following incorrect use of the pen.  Underdosing can be corrected by intake of oral 
Calcium and active vitamin D supplements following the appearance of symptoms.  
Safety in special populations 
Elderly population 
The elderly population is very limited, only 6 patients were 65 years of age or older, no subjects were 
75 years of age or older. Therefore, no conclusions can be made regarding differences in the incidence 
of in-treatment TEAEs by age category. 
Given the increased risk for adverse events and possible consequences e.g. of hypercalcaemia, the 
product should be used with even more caution in this population. 
Renal insufficiency 
Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017 
Page 86/110 
 
  
Mild-to-moderate impairment of renal function had no clinically-relevant effects on the PK of PTH(1-84) 
or serum calcium concentrations after single SC administration of 100 μg rhPTH(1-84) in the abdomen 
of male or female subjects. No data are available on patients with severe renal impairment. 
As creatinine clearance decreases, the peak plasma concentration of PTH(1-84) will increase. 
There is an increased risk of hypercalcaemia and calciphylaxis in patients with severe renal 
insufficiency. The Applicant does not want to contra-indicate patients with severe renal impairment, 
based on lack of data, because the proposed therapeutic population has no alternative treatment. 
Pregnancy and lactation 
The development program did not include pregnant women or lactating women. There is however, no 
established therapeutic regimen for treatment of hypoparathyroidism during pregnancy. This is due 
particularly to uncertainty about the use of vitamin D or its analogues, as in animal experiments 
teratogenic side-effects have been reported. Nevertheless, vitamin D or its analogues are required to 
control tetany predisposing to abortion and preterm labour. However, management of maternal 
hypoparathyroidism with calcitriol and calcium is feasible, if the 1,25(OH)2D3 concentrations are 
adapted to the physiological needs during pregnancy and serum calcium levels are kept in the lower 
normal range. 
Animal studies do not indicate harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity at clinically relevant 
exposures. It does not seem logic to deprive pregnant patients in which hypocalcaemia cannot be 
controlled by usual therapy from this treatment. Therefore, CHMP agreed with the proposed wording of 
the SmPC given that the indication is restricted. 
Immunological events 
As of the cut-off date of 03 January 2014, none of the subjects who tested positive to antibodies 
against PTH experienced injection site reactions, systemic hypersensitivity reactions related to PTH, or 
any immunogenicity-related event in this study, apart from one subject who developed a severe 
anaphylactic reaction to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dye (not related to rhPTH[1-84]) that 
resolved. 
Although antibodies to study drug and E. Coli Protein were detected only in low titre and although 
there does not seem to be any clinical consequence of antibody development, the number of results is 
small and the testing strategy incomplete over all 4 clinical studies. In addition, there is concern that 
the immunological response of those subjects who are hypoparathyroid for reasons other than post-
neck surgery will be different in type and magnitude from those who had hypoparathyroidism post-
neck surgery. The applicant is committed to the continued monitoring of antibodies and their effect on 
safety and efficacy in RACE and future studies. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The most frequent ADRs are signs and symptoms of hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia. 
The most important risks are the incidence of hypercalcaemia both during titration and the stable 
phase, and is potentially serious, and hypocalcaemia especially related with non-compliance. Post-dose 
hypercalcaemia has not been adequately documented, as well as ECG at trough and peak calcium 
concentrations.  
There are major concerns over the long-term clinical safety consequences of wide fluctuations in serum 
[Ca2+] over 24 hours after each administration of study drug, either arising from the recurrent peak 
calcium concentration achieved or arising from the repeated rise and fall of serum calcium. 
Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017 
Page 87/110 
 
  
Additional long-term safety data will be obtained from the RACE trial, that is ongoing at time of this 
report. Also, additional long-term data on clinical safety and efficacy outcomes will be collected in the 
PARADIGHM registry study (see section 2.7 risk management of this report). Data collected in this 
study include bone-related outcomes, soft tissue calcifications and renal function, together with data 
on hypercalciuria and quality of life.  
The number of results on antibody data is small and there is concern that the immunological response 
of those subjects who are hypoparathyroid for reasons other than post-neck surgery will be different in 
type and magnitude from those who had hypoparathyroidism post-neck surgery. The Company is 
committed to the continued monitoring of antibodies and their effect on safety and efficacy in RACE 
and future studies.  
Osteosarcoma, effects on bone, hypercalcaemia-induced nephrotoxicity, soft tissue calcifications and 
end-organ damage, immunogenic effects, cardiovascular effects should be followed, as their incidence 
in larger populations and on the long term are not known. Long term effects will be followed post 
approval in a registry study.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EC) 726/2004, Natpar (parathyroid hormone) is included in 
the additional monitoring list as it is approved under a conditional marketing authorisation [Art 14(7) 
of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004].  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
Hypoparathyroidism is a rare endocrine deficiency that is characterized by absent or inappropriately 
low circulating PTH levels, secreted normally by the parathyroid glands (mostly due to damage / 
removal of parathyroid glands or their blood supply during neck surgery, but also autoimmune 
conditions, congenital absence, genetic mutations, etc.).  
Hypoparathyroidism results in hypocalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia, while in the urine there is 
increased calcium excretion and decreased phosphate excretion. Because calcium sensing receptors 
are widely distributed in the human body, a fluctuation in calcium may lead to multiple and very 
diverse symptoms, although these hypocalcaemia symptoms are generally reversible. The key 
symptoms involve the neuromuscular system: numbness, paraesthesia, twitching and tetany. 
Seizures, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, laryngeal spasm are more serious and potentially life-
threatening effects, and difficulties in concentrating (“brain fog”) and effects on mood and ideation are 
also described. 
Current management of hypoparathyroidism consists of calcium (carbonate/citrate) and active vitamin 
D metabolites (calcitriol/alphacalcidol) in pharmacological doses sufficient to maintain the serum 
calcium just below or at the low end of the normal range, to protect the kidneys and to prevent long-
term damage from a high calcium-phosphate product. Thiazide diuretics can be helpful, promoting 
renal calcium reabsorption. The required amounts of calcium and active vitamin D supplements vary 
widely across patients and there is a great intrapatient variability. Therefore, constant vigilance and 
monitoring is required. Some patients require magnesium supplementation and phosphate binders. 
Although this treatment is able to achieve normal serum calcium levels, often hypercalciuria and 
hyperphosphataemia are present, due to the lack of PTH´s phosphaturic action on the kidney, putting 
patients at long-term risk of nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis. With long-acting vitamin D and 
Vitamin D derivatives, vitamin D intoxication is not infrequent and is a serious risk. Additionally, well-
being is not restored by this treatment. Current therapy does not address the root cause of 
hypoparathyroidism, namely lack of PTH. Providing a PTH hormone replacement can therefore 
expected to be beneficial. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
study C09-002 (PD) study demonstrates that single dose administration of rhPTH(1-84) has 
physiological effects of the missing hormone in hypoparathyroidism patients, after single dose 
administration rhPTH(1-84) vs calcitriol the following benefits were observed: increased mean albumin 
corrected serum calcium (ACSC) levels not returning to baseline levels, increased mean serum 
magnesium levels (AUC0-24 difference small), decreased mean serum phosphate levels, comparable 
mean serum 1,25(OH)2D levels, increase mean urinary cAMP, initial decrease mean urinary calcium 
excretion, initial decrease mean urinary magnesium excretion, increase in phosphate excretion.  
The REPLACE efficacy study is a 24-week double blind, placebo-controlled replacement study that 
clearly shows a benefit in terms of responders to the triple endpoint: 50 % reduction in calcium 
supplements, 50 % reduction in active vitamin D metabolites, maintaining patient within save range of 
serum calcium levels. The study met its primary triple endpoint with a p-value of <0.001: 1/40 
responders (2.5%) in the placebo group (CI: 0.1-13.2) compared to 46/84 responders (54.8%) in the 
rhPTH(1-84) group (CI: 43.5-65.7). 
Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017 
Page 96/110 
 
  
Following secondary and exploratory endpoints show a statistically significant effect in the REPLACE 
study (besides those related to the efficacy endpoint, such as decrease in calcitriol and oral calcium 
dose): increase in serum BTMs (p < 0.001), higher BMD measured in many locations of the hip (all p 
≤  0.001), decrease of phosphate serum levels (-0.16 (± 0.25) mmol/L in rhPTH group vs -0.01 (± 
0.22) in placebo group)(p ≤ 0.004), decrease in calcium-phosphate product (2.808 (±0.4657) 
mmol²/L² in rhPTH group vs 3.204 (± 0.4429) mmol²/L² in the placebo group) (p < 0.001). This 
demonstrates that treatment with rhPTH not only affects serum calcium, but also other aspects 
regulated by endogenous PTH. 
The RACE long-term study is an open label study that was still ongoing at time of this assessment, 
extending the period of observation to a current maximum of 1003 days (cutoff date 3/1/14), and that 
supports the REPLACE study showing 34/45 (75.6%) subjects that met the triple efficacy endpoint at 
Week 52 (95% CI: 60.5, 87.1), 21/41 (51.2 %) subjects met the triple efficacy endpoint at Month 24 
(95% CI: 35.1, 67.1) and 24/48 (50.0%) subjects met the triple efficacy endpoint at EOT (95% CI: 
35.2, 64.8). 
The PD C09-002 study is a single dose study that reports response of physiological parameters 
relevant for demonstrating the mimicking effect of rhPTH(1-84) vs the natural hormone in patients 
with hypoparathyroidism. 
The REPLACE study has a rigorous study design adapted to safety considerations for the patients in 
both study groups, and has well defined and reliable methods for assessment of subject’s response, 
including acceptable, pre-specified methods for analysis of the results.  
Although the RACE study has an open label design, it has the advantage of its study duration and that 
it has a design that allows to mimic real life situations: after the starting dose, the rhPTH(1-84) dose 
could be increased/decreased by 25 µg to a maximum of 100 µg at any time, while adjusting oral 
calcium and active vitamin D regimens based on TSC levels. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Initial lowering of urinary calcium and magnesium after administration of rhPTH(1-84) in PD study 
C09-002 was followed by return to baseline due to increasing serum levels: Over 24 hours, although 
there was an initial decrease by 65 – 68% with both doses of rhPTH(1-84) at 3 – 6 hours, values 
increased progressively to predose levels in the 16 – 24 hour sample. A different dosing scheme, 
continuous dosing, or a slow-release formulations was not considered. A more mechanistic PK-PD 
model is missing to characterize the exposure-response relationship determining the dose and dose 
regimen selection for clinical use (impact of covariates such as bodyweight, specific antibody 
presence). The applicant therefore is investigating this further post approval by means of an additional 
PK/PD study to inverstigate the appropriateness of the dosing regimen. This study, SHP634-101, is 
already planned. A model-based approach will need to be used in study design and data analysis to 
ensure an appropriate description of population PK, PK/PD and prediction of drug effects.  
Overall, there is concern that the clinical development programme did not fully evaluate the 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Natpar in a population of subjects with 
hypoparathyroidism. For instance, the quick-release formulation of Natpar chosen by the company 
results in a peak parathyroid hormone concentration (about) 2 hours after administration that then 
decays with a half-life of (about) 3 hours. This profile does not mimic the diurnal variation seen with 
endogenous parathyroid hormone in healthy subjects. This difference may have been a contributing 
factor to the apparent lack of effect on serum [Ca++] found in (about) 16% of recipients of Natpar in 
the REPLACE study in spite of the expected rise in plasma parathyroid concentration: this is considered 
to reflect tachyphylaxis or desensitisation.

Initially, the SHL pen was proposed to be commercialised, but none of the pharmacodynamic or 
efficacy studies is performed with this pen. Study PAR-C13-004 showed that a high variability is 
recorded in the dose delivered to the subjects, ranging from approximately 40 mg to 80 mg for the 
Ypsomed pen and from approximately. 40 mg to 113 mg for the SHL pen (with a target dose of 72.1 
mg). During the assessment of this application, the Applicant changed their intention to use the SHL 
pen in the to-be-marketed product to the Haselmeier pen (also referred to as Shire Q-cliq pen in this 
report), which is to be used in combination with the Duoject Mixing device. Although also for this pen a 
substantial variability in administered dose has been recorded, it should be noted that US post-
marketing data concerning this product delivered with the Haselmeier pen indicated the frequency and 
nature of postmarketing adverse events (including pen complaints) are similar to what was seen in the 
clinical development programme. By using the same Haselmeier pen during the studies that will be 
done as post authorisation measures, the same variability will also be introduced in the results of these 
studies and, as such, it will be accounted for. 
In the pivotal REPLACE study, although 46/84 subjects achieved the primary endpoint, the pre-dose 
serum [Ca++] and 24hr urinary excretion of calcium and phosphate were similar in both Natpar and 
placebo groups at the end of study. The rate of subjects meeting the triple efficacy endpoint in the 
RACE study decreases from 34/45 (75.6%) subjects at Week 52 (95% CI: 60.5, 87.1), until 21/41 
(51.2 %) Month 24 (95% CI: 35.1, 67.1). 11 subjects who met the triple efficacy endpoint in the 
REPLACE study at week 12 no longer met the 3 criteria at week 24. Mean serum calcium levels in the 
REPLACE study were still slightly decreasing in the active treatment group during the stabilisation 
phase between week 12 and week 24, and at week 24 after 8 weeks of stable dosing of rhPTH(1-84), 
despite mean additional calcium supplements being not decreased. Urinary calcium excretion was 
similar in the 2 treatment groups: -1.99 [± 4.85] mmol/24 hr in the rhPTH(1-84) group and -2.28 [± 
4.27] mmol/24 hr in the placebo group (p = 0.439) 
5% of subjects who were administered Natpar displayed neither an increase in plasma parathyroid 
hormone nor an increase in serum [Ca++]. This had previously been found by the applicant in studies 
CL1-11-007, CL1-11-009 and CL1-11-010. Possible explanations are non-compliance (it is understood 
that subjects would have been monitored at visit 13, making this seem unlikely; lso, the company 
reports a high rate of compliance), device failure (the event seems to occur whatever device has been 
used) or the presence of neutralising antibodies (the company reports that these are not found in 
recipients).  
The number of hypocalcaemia events in the REPLACE study is not reduced in the active treatment 
group compared to the placebo group. In the rhPTH(1-84) group, 29/84 subjects (34.5%) had 
symptoms of hypocalcaemia reported as AEs compared to 15/40 subjects (37.5%) in the placebo 
group, during Week 16 to Week 24. The proposed dosing schedule and the serum calcium fluctuations 
post injections (which could be expected to be of lower extent if Natpar would be administered in 
divided doses) is underexplored.  
QoL did not reach statistical significant improvement in the REPLACE study, nor in the Mosekilde ITT 
study. There was a numerical trend for between-group improvements in REPLACE for physical 
component scores (p = 0.097) and bodily pain (p = 0.105). No trends were observed in Mosekilde ITT. 
The investigated population is largely female. Since male subjects appeared to have greater PTH 
exposure in study CL1-11-010 and since there is an effect of gender factor on the apparent volume of 
distribution in POP PK, the influence of gender factor on the rhPTH PK characteristics and its clinical 
relevance is not known.  There are important uncertainties regarding the PK, efficacy and safety of 
rhPTH(1-84) in hypoparathyroidism treatment in patients from other ethnic origins than White, in older 
patients and in patients with severe renal & hepatic impairment. 
Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017 
Page 98/110 
 
  
The primary endpoint of the efficacy studies does not allow to assess any direct beneficial effect on the 
kidney comparing hormone replacement therapy to standard treatment. About 40% of subjects in the 
REPLACE study had evidence of renal impairment, however the effect of renal impairment on clinical 
outcome (or pharmacokinetics / pharmacodynamics) was not investigated during this study. 
Cognitive testing, more specific QoL testing, and, at selected time points, measurements of pre- and 
post-dose serum calcium and phosphate (2-3 times per day) and a proper calcium clearance 
measurement was missing in the performed studies.  
There is a lack of efficacy data of long-term placebo controlled studies beyond 24 weeks with regard to 
effect on bone and neutralizing antibodies, and a lack of long-term efficacy data overall allowing for 
assessment of clinical hard endpoints of hormone replacement therapy compared to standard 
treatment. 
Various deficiencies identified will be addressed in the post-approval studies: alternative dosing, 
cognitive testing, QoL testing, calcium serum profile measurement, proper calcium clearance 
measurement, long-term data on clinical hard endpoints and neutralizing antibodies. These will be 
addressed in a randomised controlled clinical trial, agreed as a specific obligation of the applicant as 
part of the conditional marketing authorisation, comparing Natpar to Standard of Care and to 
alternative dosing (based on a preceding PK/PD study), and in a long-term registry study 
(PARADIGHM) collecting long-term clinical outcomes relevant in hypoparathyroidism (see section 2.7 
risk management plan, pharmacovigilance plan, of this report).

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Most of the adverse events reported in response to Natpar (such as paraesthesia, headache, fatigue) 
appear to be caused by hyper- or hypocalcaemia.  
Calcium fluctuations 
Serum Ca2+ fluctuated up to 0.7mmol/L over 24 hours after each administration of study drug.

Issues of hypo- and hyper-calcaemia and fluctuations in serum calcium have been addressed by advice 
in the proposed SPC. 
Hypercalcaemia 
During the titration period of the placebo-controlled REPLACE study, hypercalcaemic events occurred 
more frequently in the rhPTH(1-84)-treated subjects than in the placebo treated subjects: 12/84 
(14.3%) rhPTH subjects (13 events) and 1/40 (2.5%) placebo subjects (1 event) reported 
hypercalcaemia. The ACSC laboratory values support this trend. 
One PTH-treated patient (1.2%) and no placebo treated patient had a TESAE with interruption of the 
study drug. All hypercalcaemic events resolved. The majority have a duration of 7 days or less. Patient 
with longer durations or more severe events need short interruption of the study drug regimen or 
down titration. 
During the stable period of the REPLACE Study, during which there was no further uptitration of the 
PTH dose, 8/84 (9.5%) of rhPTH(1-84)-treated subjects had 8 AEs of hypercalcaemia compared to no 
placebo subjects. Hypercalcaemic events were primarily mild or moderate and resolved quickly. One 
subject had a severe event which resulted in an interruption of the rhPTH(1-84) dose and a 
subsequent dose reduction. 
Also in the open-label long-term RACE study seven subjects experienced 11 mild or moderate events 
of hypercalcaemia that eventually resolved by an interruption of the study drug, a reduction in study 
drug dosing and/or a change of supplement dosage. 
Hypocalcaemia 
During the titration period of the placebo controlled REPLACE Study, hypocalcaemic events occurred 
more frequently in the placebo-treated subjects than in the rhPTH-treated subjects, which can be 
attributed to the protocol-mandated reduction in oral calcium and active vitamin D.  
In the stable period of the REPLACE study, hypocalcaemia rates for both the AE and ACSC criteria were 
higher in the rhPTH(1-84) subjects than in placebo subjects: 19/84 (22.5%) subjects in the rhPTH(1-
84) group experienced an AE of hypocalcaemia compared to 4/40 (10.0%) subjects in the placebo 
group. The incidence rate per subject per visit of ACSC < 1.88 mmol/L is 10.8%, which means that 1 
out of 10 subject visit of patients in the PTH group presented ACSC values < 1.88 mmol/L, compared 
to 6 out of 100 in the placebo group. 
Events occurring in this phase of the study were generally of short duration and were easily managed 
by adjustment of oral supplements. Four PTH-treated subjects experienced on-treatment 
hypocalcaemia that required treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate. All of the events were 
considered to be serious or significant, but resolved by the end of study. 
About 15% of rhPTH(1-84)-treated subjects with ACSC < 1.88 mmol/L had hypoparathyroidism 
symptoms within ±7 days of the reported occurrence. 
After discontinuation of study drug, 27/84 (32.1%) rhPTH-treated subjects (31 times) and 4/40 
(10.0%) placebo-treated subjects (4 times) experienced hypocalcaemia. In 5 rhPTH-treated subjects 
and in 1 placebo subject, the post-treatment hypocalcaemia required treatment with IV calcium 
gluconate. One of the events was not resolved by the end of study. 
Hypercalciuria 
During the stable period of the REPLACE study, 8/84 (9.5%) rhPTH-treated subjects had an AE of 
hypercalciuria compared to 2/40 (5.0%) placebo subjects. This effect is also seen in the 24-hour 
urinary calcium ≥  7.5 mmol/24 hr. None of the events were serious or led to discontinuation. 
Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017 
Page 101/110 
 
  
The effect on urinary calcium excretion is confirmed in the long-term open-label study. Ten percent of 
the patients have persistent hypercalciuria. 
Vital signs and cardiovascular safety 
Shortening of the QT interval is an effect of the change in serum calcium concentration that is 
consequent to administration of Natpar. Elevations of serum calcium in the efficacy and safety studies 
in hypoparathyroidism demonstrated the known effects of shortening the QTc interval.  
Immunological events 
16 of the 87 subjects with hypoparathyroidism who were tested using the validated MSD method and 
were treated with rhPTH(1-84) developed positive specific antibodies to PTH. None of these subjects 
had a systemic hypersensitivity reaction or any immunogenicity-related event related to rhPTH(1-84) 
treatment. 
Interactions 
The inotropic effects of digoxin are affected by serum calcium levels. Because rhPTH(1-84) transiently 
increases serum calcium, patients receiving digoxin should use rhPTH(1-84) with caution. 
There is a pharmacodynamic interaction with all medications that may potentially have impact on the 
calcium/phosphate metabolism (thiazides, corticosteroids, etc.) 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Calcium fluctuations 
The long-term effects of wide fluctuation in 24-hr post-dose serum [Ca++], as found in the REPLACE 
study, are not known.  These arise as either recurrent peak calcium concentrations achieved or from 
the repeated rise and fall of serum calciumwhich could be aggravated by the variability introduced by 
the pen (see section pen complaints, below). 
Hypercalcaemia 
Hypercalcaemia has been assessed based on pre-dose serum [Ca2+]. Serum [Ca2+] levels are higher 6-
10 hours post dose in the PTH-treated group and are expected to be maximal 10-12 hrs post-dose. 
The only clinical efficacy and safety study by the company that addressed post-dose hypercalcaemia 
using laboratory values is Study CL1-11-040 and only at visit 13 of this study. 35/75 subjects are 
shown to be hypercalcaemic at 6-10 hrs post dose i.e. serum [Ca++] >2.55mmol/L. Three subjects in 
the rhPTH group had ACSC ≥ 2.98 mmol/L. Post-dose hypercalcaemia has not been adequately 
investigated by the Applicant. 
The occurrence of hypercalcaemia has been observed in monitoring conditions and in ‘real live’ the 
incidence could be higher and the outcome more serious. 
Hypocalcaemia 
Several factors might contribute to the higher incidence of hypocalcaemia in the rhPTH(1-84)-treated 
group in the stable phase of the REPLACE study. There will be an artificially lower incidence of 
hypocalcaemia events in the placebo group by protecting them for the study protocol. rhPTH(1-84) 
subjects were not allowed to increase their rhPTH(1-84) dose to compensate for their loss in oral 
calcium and active vitamin D supplementation. There was a decrease in 25-OH VitD levels seen in 
some patients in the rhPTH(1-84) subject group. 
Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017 
Page 102/110 
 
  
The incidence of hypocalcaemia at discontinuation of the study drug is of concern in non-compliant 
patients, in which serum calcium levels won’t be monitored. Studies with diabetic patients have shown 
frequent omission of injections: 14% in type I diabetics and up to 28% in type 2 diabetics. (Farsaei et 
al., Prim Care Diabetes. 2014; (4):338-45) 
Vital signs and cardiovascular safety 
ECGs were obtained only prior to administration of study drug or shortly afterwards. It is understood 
that serial ECGs (or continuous monitoring) were not obtained. A high frequency of serial 12-lead ECG 
monitoring will be performed in a planned PK/PD study.  
Immunological events 
The antibody testing strategy employed by the company (to detect antibodies in recipients that 
develop against study drug and E. coli protein) is regarded as incomplete. 
There is concern that the immunological response of those subjects who are hypoparathyroid for 
reasons other than post-neck surgery will be different in type and magnitude from those who had 
hypoparathyroidism post-neck surgery. 
Osteosarcoma 
Based on experience with parathyroid hormone related products, there is concern that long-term 
exposure to Natpar may be associated with the development of osteosarcoma. The long-term data 
available for rhPTH(1-84) are limited. A potential risk of osteosarcoma has been described for the 
related drug teriparatide (rhPTH(1-34)).  
In the FDA adverse event reporting system, 8 cases of osteosarcoma were identified in patients with a 
history of teriparatide use. Pathology results consistent with a diagnosis of osteosarcoma were 
provided for 4 of the 8 cases. It is difficult to draw conclusions on the causality based on limited data, 
but there are at least 4 reported cases on a population estimated to be less than 1 million, i.e. more 
than the background incidence rate. 
An increased risk for osteosarcoma cannot be excluded. Beyond routine pharmacovigilance, this 
concern is being addressed in the SmPC section 4.3 by contraindicating the use of the product for 
patient groups with a potentially higher risk to develop an osteosarcoma and by a warning in section 
4.4 of the SmPC against the use of the product in young adults. 
Long-term effects 
For a product with intended chronic use, the number of patients receiving long term treatment is 
limited, there are 47 patients with hypoparathyroidism treated for 1 year and 41 patients treated for 3 
years. The patient cutoff was 30 September 2014. 
Long-term data on clinical (efficacy and) safety will be collected in the PARADIGHM registry. Data on 
clinical hard endpoints should be recorded (bone, soft tissue calcifications and renal function), together 
with data on hypercalciuria, QoL.  
Missing data in subpopulations 
There is no clinical data available in pregnant or lactating women, patients with severe renal or severe 
hepatic insufficiency.  
The elderly population is too limited to draw conclusions, only 6 patients were 65 years of age or older, 
no subjects were 75 years of age or older.

Pen complaints 
The Applicant decided, during the procedure, to change its intended pen for commercialisation from 
the SHL pen to the Haselmeier pen (also referred to as Shire Q-cliq pen in this report). The Ypsomed 
pen was used in the studies in hypoparathyroidism (Studies CL1-11-040, PAR-C10-007, PAR-C10-008, 
and PAR-C10-009). The Haselmeier pen is being used in study PAR-C10-008. Also with the Haselmeier 
pen a substantial variability in delivered dose weights has been observed, but it is to be noted that this 
pen was used in the commercialisation of the same product in the US (Natpara) and since then, post-
marketing data indicated the frequency and nature of postmarketing adverse events (including pen 
complaints) are similar to what was seen in the clinical development programme. The simulated use 
validation study PAR-C12-003 shows there is a risk for underdosing with the Haselmeier pen following 
incorrect use of the pen. Underdosing can be corrected by intake of oral Calcium and active vitamin D 
supplements following the appearance of symptoms. It is recommended to use also the Haselmeier 
pen for the studies included as post authorisation measures. As such, the variability will also be taken 
into account in the further post-approval development of this product.

3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
There is a clear and substantial effect of Natpar to decrease daily calcium and vitamin D requirements 
in hypoparathyroidism patients, demonstrated in the pivotal efficacy studies REPLACE and RACE. There 
is uncertainty, however, about how well this decrease of supplements addresses the actual clinical 
need in patients that are well-controlled on standard therapy of active vitamin D metabolite and 
calcium supplementation. At present, based on the primary endpoint, a favourable clinically relevant 
effect cannot be discerned in the hypoparathyroid population that is well-controlled on standard 
therapy, but is relevant in a patient population needing large amounts of oral supplements or not 
adequately controlled with standard therapy (unmet need). 
PD studies indicate that there is a mimicking of the natural hormone on several physiological 
parameters. However, only QD dosing is considered, which raises uncertainty about the possibility of 
having more effective dosing or dosing regimen of rhPTH(1-84) than was actually utilized in the 
efficacy studies. 
The reduction of calcium-phosphate product in serum is seen as beneficial. Serum phosphate 
measurements over the course of 24 hours were however not examined. As the PD effect on 
phosphate only lasted for 8-12 hours out of 24 hours, questions about the dosing schemes are raised. 
Clinical effect on ectopic calcifications on the longer term is needed to confirm its significance. 
Renal calcium excretion is another important parameter, but 24 hour calcium excretion did not show 
an improvement with Natpar vs. control. Improvement in 24 hour calcium excretion is an important 
treatment goal because hypoparathyroidism can result in impaired renal function. This will be further 
investigated in a randomised controlled clinical trial, agreed as a specific obligation of the applicant as 
part of the conditional marketing authorisation, comparing Natpar to Standard of Care and to 
alternative dosing (see also section 2.7 risk management plan, pharmacovigilance plan, of this report). 
The primary endpoint used in the studies does not allow to assess any direct effect on one of the main 
target organs: i.e the kidney. These direct effects are assessed as secondary endpoint, but a clear 
treatment effect has not been demonstrated. Data also failed to show a quality-of-life benefit, which 
may be due to the number of patients investigated, but is considered to be a very important 
uncertainty. On the other hand, beneficial effects on bone turnover markers and bone mineral density 
are demonstrated. Clinical outcomes in terms of bone strength and function are however unknown. No 
long-term placebo-controlled studies are available that show that the currently proven beneficial 
effects are maintained long-term or that show improvement on hard clinical endpoints relevant for 
these patients. Data on clinical hard endpoints, including bone, soft tissue calcifications and renal 
function, will be captured in a registry study (PARADIGHM) included as a post authorisation 
commitment. 
Administration failure, tachyphylaxis or desensitisation are possible, but will become apparent if an 
increase in doses of oral supplements is needed. Therefore it is considered acceptable.  
The consequences of the wide fluctuations in serum [Ca++] over the course of 24hrs after each 
administration are uncertain. So far, no long-term effects on the kidney and cardiovascular system are 
seen. Additional potential kidney effects are important in this population, but it is difficult to assess the 
impact of this uncertainty on the benefit-risk. 
On the short term this can result in extreme hypercalcaemia, which may cause severe symptoms, 
including palpitations. As the aim is to control serum calcium levels, this is an important safety 
endpoint. The facts that the post-dose 24-hour calcium has been insufficiently investigated and in real

world conditions the incidence could be higher make the risk for hypercalcaemia even more important. 
The SmPC contains advice to mitigate this risk. 
Hypocalcaemia events are more commonly expected to occur in this population with 
hypoparathyroidism than hypercalcaemia and can mostly be managed by adjustment of oral 
supplements. Few SAE or significant events occurred that required treatment with IV calcium 
gluconate. Severe hypocalcaemia may produce tetany and convulsions. As the aim is to control serum 
calcium levels, this is an important safety endpoint. 
The occurrence of hypocalcaemia upon drug discontinuation is a major concern in non-compliant 
patients.  
Osteosarcoma is very difficult to cure and has very serious consequences, but the risk for occurrence is 
considered minimal and further reduced by the contra-indications in patients with an increased 
baseline risk of osteosarcoma.  
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
It is clearly recognized that hypoparathyroidism is a state of deficiency of parathyroid hormone in 
which the current treatments do not replace that hormone or restore its function. The concept of 
providing the missing hormone as a replacement is a rational therapeutic option. 
The design of the pivotal trial shows a clear and substantial effect of rhPTH(1-84) to decrease daily 
calcium and active vitamin D metabolite requirements in hypoparathyroidism patients.  
The significant decrease of the serum calcium-phosphate product suggests potential further benefits. 
A reduction of 24-hour urinary calcium has not been shown, although exogenous PTH would be 
anticipated to have the same effect on urinary calcium as endogenous PTH.  
The studies did not show an improvement of quality of life or cognitive data.  
In hypoparathyroidism patients that are well-controlled with their standard therapy the effects shown 
are insufficient to counterbalance the lack of a significant decrease in urine calcium levels compared to 
standard treatment, the lack of an effect on QoL, the absence of a demonstration of long-term effects 
on clinical hard endpoints and the observed increase in hyper- and hypocalcaemia, and the remaining 
uncertainty of the long-term safety and this patient population is therefore not included in the 
indication of this product. 
However, the benefit/risk is considered positive in the restricted patient population that is not 
adequately controlled on standard conventional therapy. Standard therapy may include oral calcium, 
active vitamin D, magnesium, thiazide diuretics, and/or phosphate binders. Patients who are not 
adequately controlled with such standard therapy may be candidates for the treatment with Natpar but 
should be treated by health care professionals experienced in the management of patients with 
hypoparathyroidism.  A guideline sponsored by the European Society of Endocrinology for the 
treatment of chronic hypoparathyroidism in adults has been published recently (Bollerslev, J., et al., 
European Journal of Endocrinology, 2015, G1-G20). Guidelines such as these may serve as guidance 
for treatment goals under such therapies. 
In order to confirm the positive B/R of Natpar administered QD in patients with chronic 
hypoparathyroidism that are not adequately controlled with standard therapy alone, i.e. the approved 
indication, the MAH has committed to conduct a randomised controlled trial comparing Natpar to 
Standard of Care and to alternative dosing (optimal dosing resulting from a PK/PD study), investigating 
the appropriateness of the dose, cognitive data and QOL, as well as other parameters of calcium-

phosphate metabolism, including calcium serum profile, serum phosphate and renal calcium clearance 
(specific obligation of the applicant as part of the conditional marketing authorisation, see also section 
2.7 risk management and section 4 recommendation).  
The risk of post-dose hypercalcaemia should be further investigated, but is currently mitigated by close 
monitoring as described in the SmPC. Guidance has been added in the SmPC for initiation and titration 
of Natpar and oral supplements, including that treatment should be stopped or reduced and reassessed 
if pre-dose serum calcium raises above the ULN (2.55 mmol/L). 
3.6.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
There is a clear effect of rhPTH(1-84) on the reduction of required calcium and active vitamin D 
metabolite supplements. The importance of this statistically highly significant effect is however 
counterbalanced by the fact that the added clinical value is not known for patients who are already 
stabilized on calcium levels by the supplements that are currently used. Therefore, the use of Natpar is 
now being limited to a restricted patient population, in which treatment with calcium and vitamin D 
metabolites is insufficient to obtain stable serum levels of calcium or when uptitration in calcium and 
vitamin D supplements to obtain adequate calcium plasma levels is hampered by intolerable adverse 
events which may seriously affect these patients’ quality of life. 
The overall B/R of Natpar is positive in the restricted population of patients with chronic 
hypoparathyroidism who cannot be adequately controlled with standard therapy alone. Further data 
will be obtained  in a randomised controlled clinical trial, agreed as a specific obligation of the applicant 
as part of the conditional marketing authorisation, to further substantiate the positive benefit/risk in 
this patient population to confirm appropriateness of QD dosing versus standard of care and versus 
alternative dosing regimens using cognitive testing, measures of serum calcium and phosphate post-
dose and proper calcium clearance measurements. Post-approval, long-term efficacy and safety of the 
product will also be investigated in a long-term registry study (PARADIGHM)capturing data on clinical 
hard endpoints, including bone, soft tissue calcifications and renal function (see also section 2.7 risk 
management plan, pharmacovigilance plan, of this report). 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
As comprehensive data referring to the safety and efficacy of the product are not available, a 
conditional marketing authorisation was proposed by the CHMP during the assessment, after having 
consulted the applicant. 
The product falls within the scope of Commission Regulation (EC) No 507/2006 concerning conditional 
marketing authorisations, as it aims at the treatment of a seriously debilitating disease and is 
designated as an orphan medicinal product. The currently available standard treatment of 
hypoparathyroidism with calcium and active vitamin D has major deficiencies as it is not a 
physiological replacement of the missing endogenous parathyroid hormone and does not allow a 
complete normalisation of the calcium and phosphate metabolism. Patients insufficiently controlled on 
such standard therapy experience intolerable adverse events, such as periodic events of muscle 
cramps, tetanic events and cognitive deficits, which can seriously affect these patients’ quality of life. 
Patients with hypoparathyroidism on standard treatment are also at risk of suffering long term extra 
osseous calcifications, particularly of the kidney, brain and eye lens. 
Furthermore, the CHMP considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
authorisation: 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive, as discussed. 
Natpar - Assessment report  
EMA/180882/2017 
Page 107/110 
 
  
• 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data: The applicant will 
conduct a 26-week randomised controlled clinical trial to confirm the positive benefit/risk of 
Natpar in terms of safety and efficacy in the approved patient population in the EU. The study 
will investigate quality of life, collect cognitive data, and investigate physiological parameters of 
calcium and phosphate metabolism.The study is intended  to confirm the positive B/R and the 
appropriateness of the QD dosing regimen of Natpar in patients with chronic 
hypoparathyroidism that are not well controlled on standard therapy alone, which is the 
currently approved indication. The randomised controlled trial will compare Natpar to Standard 
of Care and to an alternative dosing scheme. Outcomes will include clinical endpoints like 
cognitive status, hypoparathyroidism related symptoms and health-related quality of life, which 
are considered essential, in combination with confirmation of QD dosing. Renal handling of 
calcium, reduction of hyperphosphataemia and fluctuations of serum calcium will also be 
measured because they are critical for the adverse events with current standard of care. These 
clinically important outcome parameters are considered confirmatory vs. the intermediate 
endpoints captured in the studies submitted in this application. This is a short study in the 
approved patient population and provision of comprehensive data seems likely. 
• 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed: Natpar is identical to human parathyroid hormone and is 
therefore a replacement therapy for the lack of endogenous parathyroid hormone in patients 
with hypoparathyroidism. Currently, no other hormone replacement therapy for 
hypoparathyroidism is authorised. Currently available standard treatment of 
hypoparathyroidism with calcium and active vitamin D has major deficiencies as it is not a 
physiological replacement of the missing endogenous parathyroid hormone and does not allow 
a complete normalisation of the calcium and phosphate metabolism. Patients insufficiently 
controlled on such standard therapy experience intolerable adverse events, such as periodic 
events of muscle cramps, tetanic events and cognitive deficits, which can seriously affect these 
patients’ quality of life. Patients with hypoparathyroidism on standard treatment are also at risk 
of suffering from long term extra osseous calcifications, particularly of the kidney, brain and 
eye lens. 
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required: The demonstrated reduction of doses of active vitamin D 
metabolites and calcium needed to adjust the calcium and phosphate parameters of patients 
with hypoparathyroidism together with partial improvement of some parameters of calcium-
phosphate metabolism, and the lack of any other approved therapeutic option to replace the 
missing parathyroid hormone in case of severely debilitating consequences of the disease 
outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required.  
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Natpar is positive.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Izba is a medicinal product that contains travoprost as active substance. It is intended for ocular 
administration and is available as eye drops, solution. Each ml of solution contains 30 
micrograms of travoprost. 
The therapeutic indication applied for by the applicant and approved by the CHMP is: Decrease of 
elevated intraocular pressure in adult patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma. 
Izba has the same therapeutic indication and contains the same active substance as Travatan 
(Travoprost 40 μg/mL Eye Drops), but contains a lower amount of active substance. Alcon 
Laboratories (UK) Ltd, the Applicant for this MAA for Izba is also MAH for Travatan.  
The posology for Izba (Travoprost 30 μg/mL eye dropssolution) is one drop once-daily topical 
ocular therapy. The therapeutic class is Ophthalmologicals-antiglaucoma preparations and 
miotics-prostaglandin analogues, the ATC Code is S01E E04. The mechanism of action is based 
on the fact that in the eye, prostaglandin increases the drainage of the watery fluid (aqueous 
humour) out of the eyeball. Izba acts in the same way and increases the flow of fluid out of the 
eye. This helps to reduce the pressure inside the eye.  
Travoprost 40 μg/mL eye drops solution and travoprost 30 μg/mL eye drops solution are also 
referred to as Travoprost 0.004% Solution and Travoprost 0.003% Solution, respectively in this 
assessment report. 
The clinical development of Travoprost 0.003% Solution was based on the body of work that had 
been compiled for the approval of Travoprost 0.004% BAK (preserved with benzalkonium 
chloride).  
The safety and efficacy profile of travoprost has been demonstrated in several clinical trials, but 
the clinical development plan for Travoprost 0.003% Solution included 1 pivotal, Phase 3, safety 
and efficacy study (C-11-034). This safety/efficacy study was designed to demonstrate that the 
intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering efficacy of of Travoprost 0.003% Solution is equivalent to the 
IOP-lowering efficacy of Travoprost 0.004% BAK, with both dosed once-daily in the evening in 
patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. 
Two pack sizes are proposed for marketing; a pack of one 4 ml bottle and a pack of three 4 ml 
bottles. The pack sizes are consistent with the dosage regimen and duration of use. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Izba is presented as eye drops, solution containing 30 microgram travoprost per ml solution. 
Izba is a medicinal product for multi-dose use and is preserved with polyquaternium-1 (also 
known as polyquad) and contains boric acid as preservative aid. Other ingredients are: 
Izba Assessment Report  
EMA/13480/2014 
Page 10/62 
 
  
  
polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil 40, propylene glycol, mannitol, sodium chloride, 
hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide and purified water. The qualitative composition is described 
in section 6.1. of the SmPC 
Izba is available in oval syndiotactic polypropylene (sPP) bottles with polypropylene (PP) 
dispensing plugs and closures, and is presented in an overwrap. It is available in two package 
sizes containing respectively one and three 4 ml bottles. Each bottle contains 2.5 ml eye drops 
solution. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Travoprost is a colourless to light yellow, clear to slightly opalescent oil.  It is somewhat 
hygroscopic, and is insoluble in water but very soluble in acetonitrile, methanol, octanol and 
chloroform. Its chemical names are [1R-[1α(Z),2β(1E,3R*),3α,5α]]-7-[3,5-Dihydroxy-2-[3-
hydroxy-4-[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy]-1-butenyl]cyclopentyl]-5-heptenoic acid, 1-
methylethylester and propan-2-yl 7-[3,5-dihydroxy-2-[3-hydroxy-4-[3-
(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy]-but-1-enyl]-cyclopentyl]hept-5-enoate. 
Travoprost has the following structural formula: 
The chemical structure of travoprost is confirmed by NMR, HPLC-MS, IR spectroscopy, specific 
optical rotation, elemental analysis and APCI-MS. Travoprost is the (+)-enantiomer of 
fluprostenol isopropyl ester. For confirmation of the enantiomeric purity, at least two batches 
were analysed by normal phase chiral HPLC-UV and compared to a racemic fluprostenol isopropyl 
ester standard solution.   
Travoprost contains five chiral centers and is therefore optically active. Enantiomeric purity is 
controlled routinely by specific optical rotation. Polymorphism is not applicable as travoprost is a 
solution. 
The applicant did not claim a new active substance status for travoprost. Travoprost is a known 
active substance but at the time of this opinion is neither described in the European 
Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) nor in the pharmacopoeia of a member state. Travoprost is described 
in the US pharmacopoeia.

Page 11/62 
 
  
  
 
 
Manufacture 
Travoprost is supplied by one manufacturer, details on the active substance and its 
manufacturing are provided in an active substance master file (ASMF).  
The manufacturer synthesizes travoprost in ten steps, followed by purification.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the 
relevant EU guidelines. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised.  
The manufacturing process is well described and adequate in-process controls are applied during 
the synthesis. The manufacturing process has been validated on three pilot size batches. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance (colour and clarity), identity (IR 
and HPLC), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), and 
specific rotation (EP). All analytical methods have been adequately validated. 
Tests for polymorphism and particle size distribution are not included as travoprost is a solution. 
Based on the results from batch analysis data, the following tests were not included in the active 
substance specifications: chiral purity analysis, heavy metals and silicon analysis. Chiral purity is 
routinely controlled in the starting material. The solvents used in the final purification step are 
included in the active substance specification. The travoprost active substance is a non-aqueous 
oil and is not tested routinely for bioburden as the microbiological quality of the travoprost stock 
solution (used in the manufacturing of the finished product) is routinely monitored. 
Batch analysis data have been presented on two production scale batches and demonstrate that 
all batches comply with the proposed specifications and that the active substance can be 
manufactured reproducibly. 
Stability 
The applicant has performed stability studies on three pilot scale batches of travoprost drug 
substance. These batches have been stored for five years at -20°C (long-term storage condition) 
and for 26 weeks at 4°C/35% RH (accelerated condition). The parameters tested were the same 
as at release, with the exception of specific rotation which is only tested at release.  
Stress studies showed the drug substance to be susceptible to degradation by heat and humidity. 
Filling the container with nitrogen decreased the rates of degradation. Exposure to UV radiation 
also caused degradation. Therefore the drug substance is stored in a borosilicate glass flask, 
filled with a nitrogen head, sealed with a borosilicate stopper and protected from light by 
secondary packaging.  
The stability results indicate that the drug substance is stable and justify the proposed retest 
period in the proposed container.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical development 
The aim was to develop a medicinal product with identical qualitative and quantitative 
composition to the already approved travoprost eye drops solution 0.004% (Travatan), which is 
preserved with polyquad, but which a reduced concentration (0.003%) of travoprost.  
Izba contains the following excipients: polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil 40 (solubilising / 
stabilising agent), propylene glycol (tonicity agent), boric acid (preservative aid/buffering agent), 
mannitol (tonicity agent/buffering agent), sodium chloride (tonicity agent), polyquaternium-1 
solution (preservative), hydrochloric acid (pH adjustment), sodium hydroxide (pH adjustment) 
and purified water (vehicle). 
The formulation development of Izba is based on the approved travoprost 0.004% formulation. 
Izba is a clear, colourless to pale yellow aqueous solution formulated at a pH of approximately 
6.8 and is isotonic. Since the drug substance travoprost is an oil, polymorphism and particle size 
of the active compound are irrelevant. The proposed formulation contains an expected range of 
excipients for an aqueous eye drop solution containing a hydrophobic drug substance compound 
such as travoprost. The drug substance is insoluble in water, hence surfactants, solubilising 
agents and co-solvents are used in order to solubilise the active substance. 
The excipients are identical in function and concentration to those in the authorised 0.004% 
Travatan formulation. The preservative system consists of polyquaternium-1 (polyquad) and 
boric acid. Boric acid is a preservative aid which also serves as a buffering agent. 
Polyquaternium-1 is a high molecular weight quaternary ammonium compound with disinfectant 
and preservative activity. The specifications for polyquad are the same as for the polyquad used 
in the approved travoprost 0.004% eye drops solution. The use of polyquad as a novel excipient 
was assessed and approved previously, for the 0.004% travoprost eye drops solution. On this 
basis the proposed formulation is considered acceptable. 
Also the manufacturing process development is based on the approved travoprost 0.004% 
formulation. The process consists of three main steps and a risk assessment was conducted for 
each step. Potential critical process parameters (CPPs) were identified as well as the product 
quality attributed that could be affected by the CPPs. The potential CPPs were further evaluated 
and then ranked by means of the results of experimental studies.  
The primary packaging selected for travoprost 0.003% solution is appropriately sized and is easy 
to squeeze due to its oval shape and deformation characteristics of syndiodactic polypropylene 
(sPP). Appropriate extractables and leachables tests were carried out for the proposed container 
closure. 
Adventitious agents 
None of the excipients are sourced from animal materials. Satisfactory TSE/BSE certification is 
supplied for each excipient. The majority of excipients are synthetically produced with the 
exception of mannitol which is derived from a vegetable source. 
Izba Assessment Report  
EMA/13480/2014 
Page 13/62 
 
  
  
Manufacture of the product 
Izba is a sterile medicinal product manufactured at two sites. The manufacturing process for the 
travoprost 0.003% solution involves three major steps: i) preparation of travoprost stock 
solution, ii) dissolution of the water soluble ingredients followed by addition of the travoprost 
stock solution and sterilization of the solution by membrane filtration and iii) aseptic filling of the 
sterile solution into packaging components previously sterilized by ethylene oxide.  
Terminal sterilisation and steam sterilisation of the final bulk was considered but was not possible 
because the active is prone to degradation at these temperatures. This manufacturing process is 
essentially the same as that approved for the travoprost 0.004% solution (Travatan). The critical 
steps in the manufacturing process have been adequately identified and controlled. The in-
process controls are adequate for this non-standard manufacturing process and for this 
pharmaceutical form. 
Process validation was performed on three commercial scale batches for both sites. The process 
validation results demonstrate that the process is able to reproducibly produce a finished product 
of the intended quality.  
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for identity (UHPLC, TLC), 
assay (UHPLC), impurities (UHPLC), identity and assay of boric acid (HPIC), identity and assay of 
polyquaternium-1 (spectrophotometric method), pH, osmolality, colour (visual examination), 
clarity (Ph.Eur.), particles/particulates (visual), fill volume(IPC test) and sterility (membrane 
filtration). 
The absence of tests for residual solvents and metals has been adequately justified; no residual 
solvents & metals have been detected in the stability batches. The proposed finished product 
specification (release and shelf life) is considered satisfactorily robust and appropriate and the 
analytical procedures are regarded sufficiently validated. 
Batch analysis data have been provided for four commercial scale batches and one clinical batch. 
These batches were made with travoprost sourced from both active substance suppliers and 
include also both finished product manufacturers. The data demonstrate that the predefined 
product specifications are met and that the manufacturing process is under control. 
Stability of the product 
The stability studies were carried out on five batches including four commercial scale batches and 
one clinical batch, produced at both proposed finished product manufacturing sites. The four 
commercial scale batches were packed into the packaging materials which are intended for 
marketing; they were over pouched using the foil laminate secondary packaging, the clinical 
batch was not over pouched. 
Up to 78 weeks long term stability data (at 25°C/40%RH) have been presented for the 
commercial scale batches, and up to 52 weeks long term stability data have been provided for 
the clinical batch. Furthermore, stability data have been provided for studies performed under 
Izba Assessment Report  
EMA/13480/2014 
Page 14/62 
 
  
  
accelerated and intermediate storage conditions, and stress tests have been performed under 
refrigerated conditions, freeze/thaw cycles and after light exposure. After 6 weeks of light 
exposure, increase in degradation product contents is observed. Increase of degradation product 
content is more important for samples without secondary packaging. All other chemical or 
physical assay results showed no significant changes for the samples when stored under stressed 
conditions. 
In addition, two commercial scale batches were evaluated in an in-use test, which measured the 
total viable microbial count of remaining product after simulating patient usage over a 30 day 
period. During the in-use 30 day study, the test product was stored at ambient room 
temperature (20-25°C), protected from light. 
Furthermore, results of supportive long term stability data from the approved travoprost 0.004% 
w/v eye drop solution formulation have been provided for three batches stored over three years. 
As the composition, fill volume and packaging is identical to the travoprost 0.003% eye drop 
solution the stability data may be considered to be supportive for overpouched product as all 
batches were overpouched. 
The shelf-life specifications include the same tests as the release specifications, with the 
exception that the following tests are not performed during stability: identity for travoprost, boric 
acid and polyquaternium-1 and fill volume. 
Supportive stability results for additional physical tests such as: precipitate, particulate matter, 
package condition, foreign insoluble matter, insoluble particulate matter and weight change, as 
well as the microbiological test, preservative effectiveness Test were provided. The results show 
no significant change upon storage. Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life and 
conditions for storage as stated in the SmPC are acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The development of Izba was largely based on the approved travoprost eye drops solution 
0.004% polyquaternium formulation, with the exception of a reduced concentration of 
travoprost. Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and 
finished product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out 
indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn 
lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in 
the clinic.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the 
conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform 
clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory 
way.

2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The Applicant submitted a full pharmacology dossier to explain the pharmacology of travoprost. 
Also called AL-6221, travoprost is a synthetic prostaglandin F2α analogue. Travoprost free acid, 
or AL-5848, a selective F-prostanoid (FP) prostanoid receptor agonist, used to decrease elevated 
intraocular pressure in ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma as monotherapy or as 
adjunctive therapy. F-prostaglandin receptor agonists increase aqueous humor outflow through 
the uveoscleral pathway in animal models and man.  
Travoprost, an isopropyl ester prodrug, is hydrolyzed by esterases in the cornea to its biologically 
active free acid. Travoprost 0.003% Solution, containing 30 µg/mL travoprost, is a sterile 
ophthalmic solution preserved with polyquaternium-1 (POLYQUAD). 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
A battery of in vitro and in vivo studies has been conducted to assess the mechanism of action of 
this FP receptor agonist. For in vitro test systems, AL-5848 (0.1 nM to 100 μM), the free acid of 
travoprost, was used because of the likely lack of esterase to hydrolyze the parent compound in 
the test systems used.  
Prostanoid receptor binding affinity tests for the free acid of travoprost AL-5848, show that AL-
5848 is a selective and full agonist at the FP prostanoid receptor. AL-5848 exhibited no 
significant receptor activity for a battery 32 physiologically relevant receptors at concentrations 
up to 10 μM.  
In vivo, travoprost significantly reduced IOP in laser-induced ocular-hypertensive monkeys when 
administered daily (0.3 μg and 1 μg) and twice daily (0.1 μg and 0.3 μg) by topical ocular 
administration. Travoprost reduction in IOP peaked at ≈22 and ≈30% (for 0.1 and 0.3 μg BID 
doses respectively), and ≈26 and ≈29% (for 0.3 and 1 μg QD). The IOP response was sustained 
through 24 hours and returned to baseline by 48 hours after the last once daily instillation. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The secondary pharmacodynamics assessment includes the effects of travoprost on optic nerve 
head blood flow and on the retina via flash electroretinogram (ERG) in rabbits. Travoprost

increased optic nerve head blood flow, which is considered to be a possible component in the 
etiology of glaucoma, and produced no significant changes in the ERG of Dutch-belted rabbits. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
The potential of travoprost to alter central nervous, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal 
and renal systems, as well as their effects on the uterus, were examined at doses up to 30 μg/kg 
(equivalent to 833-fold the maximal recommended human dose (MRHD)). The findings noted in 
the safety pharmacology studies with travoprost or its free acid, AL-5848 are consistent with the 
known pharmacology of PGF2α.  
Travoprost produced no significant effects on the central nervous, renal or respiratory system. 
Furthermore, travoprost showed no significant effects on cardiac repolarisation. 
At high doses (10 μg/kg), significant effects on cardiac contractility, blood pressure and left 
ventricular pressure were observed in dogs. However, these effects were observed at plasma 
concentrations higher than those achieved clinically at IOP-lowering doses, with a wide safety 
margin (278-fold the MRHD).  
In guinea pigs, a small but statistically significant increase in respiratory rate was observed 
following 10 μg/kg travoprost treatment. The changes, although were statistically significant, 
could be considered not biologically relevant since they were transient in nature (2-8 min in 
duration) and did not translate into changes in airway resistance or dynamic lung compliance. 
Travoprost increase gastrointestinal propulsion in a dose-dependent manner in mice, consistent 
with the known agonist activity of AL-5848 on FP prostanoid receptors. However, these GI effects 
are not expected at clinically relevant doses.  
Prostaglandins are recognized effectors of uterine function. AL-5848 induced concentration-
dependent uterine contractions in isolated, diethylstilbestrol-primed rat uteri, consistently with 
the known pharmacology of PGF2α. These uterine contractions were found to occur at 
concentrations of 3 nM to 1 µM, (translating to doses from 6 to 20,000-fold higher than plasma 
levels achieved clinically). 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
AL-5848 was essentially inactive at a variety of common central and peripheral receptors - e.g. 
adenosine, alpha-1 adrenergic, alpha-2 adrenergic, beta-adrenergic, muscarinic, nicotinic, 
dopamine, serotonin, melatonin and glutamate receptors. Therefore, travoprost is unlikely to 
interact adversely with other glaucoma agents or with other receptor-mediated pharmacologic 
agents. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of travoprost have been studied in 
Sprague-Dawley rats by administration of [3H]-travoprost by the oral, intravenous and 
subcutaneous routes, and in New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits by the topical ocular and 
intravenous routes and Cynomolgus monkeys by intravenous route. For systemic 
Izba Assessment Report  
EMA/13480/2014 
Page 17/62 
 
  
  
pharmacokinetic studies non-labelled travoprost was administered to SD rats by the intravenous 
and subcutaneous routes and to Cynomolgus monkeys intravenously.  
The analytical method used for non-labelled studies was fully validated for precision, accuracy 
and stability for each species and matrix. The procedure employed a LC/MS/MS method for 
detection of the active free acid AL-5848, which is formed by rapid hydrolysis of travoprost in 
vivo and in vitro. 
The pharmacokinetic studies showed that AL-6221 is absorbed and rapidly hydrolyzed by 
esterase enzymes to its free acid AL-5848, the pharmacologically active form. Therefore, the AL-
5848 levels are substantially higher than AL-6221 levels: in monkey plasma AL-5848 
concentrations were generally 4-fold higher than AL-6221 concentrations. 
Plasma concentrations of AL-5848 declined rapidly and in a biphasic manner following 
intravenous administration of AL-6221 in rats and monkeys and with t1/2 of 16 and 36 minutes, 
respectively. 
Following subcutaneous administration, maximal plasma concentrations and exposure to AL-5848 
increased in a dose-proportional manner.  
The study in rats also showed that travoprost is poorly absorbed following oral dosing. The 
bioavailability of AL-5848 after oral doses were both low (<3 to 6%). 
In vitro binding of AL-5848 to rat, monkey and human plasma proteins was similar between 
species at approximately 80% and independent of concentrations up to 100ng/ml.   
Tissue distribution studies of travoprost in rats showed highest concentrations in kidney, liver, 
lung and plasma. Radioactivity concentrations decreased over the first hours, but were still 
detectable in most tissue through 72 hours after multiple dose regimen. In pregnant rats, 
radioactivity was measured in amniotic fluid and fetal tissues with highest fetal tissue 
concentrations in liver and lung, which were approximately 2-4% of that in maternal plasma. 
The metabolism of travoprost and AL-5848 was studied in in vitro and in vivo in rats and 
cynomolgus monkeys. AL-6221 is rapidly de-esterified by plasma esterases enzymes to AL-5848, 
its pharmacologically active carboxylic acid form. Travoprost and AL-5848 are rapidly 
metabolised, following similar pathways to that of endogenous prostaglandin-F2α, which are 
characterised by reduction of the 13-14 double bond, oxidation of the 15-hydroxyl and β-
oxidative cleavages of the upper side chain. This is based on the non-clinical metabolism studies 
and studies reported in the literature on the metabolism of prostaglandins in humans. 
In rats, travoprost is rapidly excreted, with 34% and 74% being recovered in urine and faeces, 
respectively. Travoprost undergoes extensive biliary excretion and is excreted in the milk of 
lactating rats.  
No pharmacokinetics drug interaction studies with travoprost and other medicinal products have 
been conducted and this has been mentioned in the SmPC section 4.5. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The Applicant submitted a toxicology package that was also presented for marketing 
authorization applications for other formulations of travoprost previously authorised. No new 
Izba Assessment Report  
EMA/13480/2014 
Page 18/62 
 
  
  
toxicology studies were conducted with Travoprost 0.003% Solution. The toxicology package was 
acceptable to the CHMP. 
Single dose toxicity 
The topical administration of travoprost 0.004% at single dose demonstrated that the product is 
well tolerated in rabbits. The intravenous administration of AL-6221 in the rat was lethal for 4/8 
males at 100 mg/kg. However, the same dose in the mouse did not produced deaths. The 
toxicity of travoprost following intravenous single dose appears to be consistent with other 
prostanoid agents. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
The effects of travoprost following the repeat dose administration have been studied in mice, 
rats, rabbits and monkeys. In mice, AL-6221 was dosed intravenously and intraperitoneally while 
in rats, the product was administered intravenously and subcutaneously. Both in rabbits and 
monkeys, travoprost was administered by topical route. 
In mice, travoprost was administered intravenously at 100, 300 and 1000 µg/kg/day for 3 
months. Non dose-related mortality and slight reductions in haematological parameters were 
observed at high doses. No recovery period was included in this study. The microscopic 
examination of bone revealed a high, dose-related incidence of hyperostosis and endosteal 
fibrosis in the femur and sternum, which may have caused a reduction of bone marrow space 
leading to the haematologic changes observed.  This appeared to be supported by the increased 
extramedullary haematopoiesis seen in the liver and spleen.  
In rats administered subcutaneously up to 100 µg/kg/day for 6 months, slight reductions in 
haematological parameters were detected and bone hyperostosis and endosteal fibrosis were 
observed at ≥30 μg/kg/day. 
In rabbits given topical ocular doses of Travoprost 0.004% BAK (10 to 100μg/mL) two or three 
times daily for 6 months, no signs of ocular irritation or systemic toxicity were found and neither 
macroscopic nor microscopic changes in the eyes or adnexa were observed.   
Based on the repeated dose studies in rodents, bone was considered the target organ, with a no 
effect level of 10μg/kg/day.  This dose is approximately 278 times the proposed recommended 
clinical dose.  The effects on bone were not observed in mice at similar and higher dose levels 
and were not detected in rabbits or monkeys. Thus, it is considered unlikely that the proposed 
ophthalmic use of Travoprost 0.003% solution will induce any bone-related effects. 
Genotoxicity 
The standard battery for genotoxic assessment has been conducted in six studies, four in vitro 
and two in vivo. No evidence of mutagenic activity was observed in the bacterial reverse 
mutation assay. Travoprost was considered to be negative without metabolic activation and 
equivocal with metabolic activation in the mouse lymphoma mutation assay. Taking into account 
the negative results in the bacterial and in the two in vivo assays and the negative result 
Izba Assessment Report  
EMA/13480/2014 
Page 19/62 
 
  
  
obtained in the second mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, the risk of mutagenic potential 
for travoprost can be considered low. 
Carcinogenicity 
The carcinogenicity package provided is the same as previously evaluated for the other 
travoprost formulations. No further studies have been performed since carcinogenicity was 
discussed in previous marketing authorization applications of travoprost. The carcinogenic 
potential of travoprost was investigated in two-year studies in mice and rats, administered by 
subcutaneous injection, at doses up to 100μg/kg/day. In these carcinogenicity studies, maximal 
mean concentrations in the high dose group ranged from 4.18 to 6.96 ng/ml in mice and 8.8 to 
10.8 ng/ml in rats.  
In the rat study, statistically significant increases in some tumour types, as pheochromocytoma, 
skin fibroma, squamous cell papilloma and uterine granuloma cell tumour, were present by some 
statistical measures. These tumour findings were considered to be incidental, and not related to 
treatment with travoprost. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
In embryo-fetal development toxicity study performed in mice, only a quantifiable exposure to 
AL-5848 was observed in 4 of the 8 high-dose study animals, ranged from 0.104 to 0.126ng/mL. 
All other samples obtained from the other doses were below the limit of quantitation. 
No new developmental and reproductive studies were conducted with Travoprost 0.003% 
Solution. Only studies to support other formulations of travoprost have been submitted. 
In the fertility and early embryonic development toxicity studies, the effects on reproduction, as 
the reduced viable foetuses per dam observed, were the ones expected given the 
pharmacological activity of travoprost.  
Regarding the embryo-fetal development toxicity study mice administered with travoprost from 
GD 6 to 16, an increase in the percentage of early resorption and post-implantation loss and 
reductions in the number of dams with viable foetuses, live foetuses per dam and fetal body 
weight were observed at 1 μg/kg/day.  The no effect level for embryo-fetal toxicity was reported 
to be 0.3 μg/kg/day. 
In the prenatal and postnatal development studies, including maternal function, performed in 
rats, AL-6221 administered by subcutaneous doses produces effects in dam rats at > 0.12 
µg/kg/day 
No studies in juvenile animals have been submitted. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetics were assessed during topical ocular administration of travoprost in rabbits over a 
period of 3 and 9 months and in the cynomolgus monkey over a period of 12 months after topical 
ocular application of the medicinal product in the pharmaceutical form proposed for therapeutic 
Izba Assessment Report  
EMA/13480/2014 
Page 20/62 
 
  
  
 
use. Other toxicokinetic data were obtained from carcinogenicity studies and embryo-fetal 
development toxicity study. 
In rabbits, there was measurable systemic exposure to AL-5848 following topical administration 
of AL-6221 at the highest dose and in a small number of samples in the middle dose, although 
there were also many doses where the exposure was below the assay quantitation limit. No 
evidence of sex-related differences in AL-5848 plasma concentrations was demonstrated. Mean 
steady-state AL-5848 concentrations showed an approximately dose-proportional increase over 
the dose range. 
In monkeys, a quantifiable exposure to AL-5848 in all three AL-6221 treatment groups was 
reported. A minor sex related difference (male AL-5848 plasma concentrations those of females) 
at the high dose was seen, but the trend was not consistent across doses. 
Local Tolerance  
The local tolerance of AL-6221 has been assessed in the context of single-dose and repeat-dose 
toxicity studies. No relevant local toxic effects were observed in rabbits and monkeys after 
topical administration of travoprost. 
Other toxicity studies 
Regarding the potential phototoxic of travoprost, the product is considered non-phototoxic since 
the mean photo effects (MPEs) were 0.022 and 0.007, and the PIFs were 1.12 and 1.08, in the 
Neutral red uptake phototoxicity assay in BALB/c 3T3 mouse fibroblasts. Also travoprost could be 
considered a non-sensitizer according to a sensitization study conducted in guinea pigs. 
No immunotoxicity, dependence studies have been performed and studies in metabolites have 
been submitted. This is considered acceptable.  
Impurities of travoprost 0.003% solution have not been evaluated. However, the Applicant 
submitted two studies in which the impurities of AL-6221 were assessed. Such impurities (e.g.: 
epoxide impurity or AL-12535 observed at concentrations of up to 0.5% of drug substance) were 
well tolerated and produced no signs of ocular irritation or treatment related toxicity. 
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
A Phase I calculation of Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) assessment according to 
the “Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00)” has been performed for Travoprost 0.003% Ophthalmic Solution. 
Therefore, PECsurfacewater in Phase I for travoprost results is 0.000000009 mg/L or 0.009 μg/L.  
As the PECsurfacewater value is below the 0.01 μg/L action limit value, a Phase II environmental 
effect analysis is not needed. Travoprost is considered unlikely to represent a risk for the 
environment following its prescribed use and no further action is required under the Committee 
for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) “Guideline on the environmental risk assessment 
of medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00)”.

The log Kow value according to Partition Coefficient (n-octanol/water) OECD Guideline 123 for 
testing of chemicals “Partition Coefficient (1-Octanol/Water): Slow-Stirring Method”, was 
provided by the Applicant. This value for travoprost is 4.483. However, the study that 
ascertained this value was not carried out according to the criteria set out in the relevant OECD 
Guideline. Therefore, the log Kow value for travoprost of 4.483 as determined in this study is 
questionable. In order to conclude on the exact log Kow, its value should be determined strictly 
according to the guideline of the method chosen.  
If the log Kow value obtained for the product would be higher than 4.5, according to “Guideline on 
the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00)” and “Questions and answers on 'Guideline on the environmental 
risk assessment of medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010)”, 
travoprost should be screened by the MAH in a step-wise procedure for persistence, 
bioaccumulation and toxicity. 
Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Izba is in the pharmacological class of PGF2α agonists that includes latanoprost, bimatoprost, 
and tafluprost. Ophthalmic formulations of travoprost preserved with different preservatives 
(Travoprost 0.004% BAK, Travoprost 0.004% sofZia, and Travoprost 0.004% PQ) are marketed 
in the USA and/or European Union and in the process of development have undergone extensive 
non-clinical and clinical testing. Travoprost 0.003% Solution is identical to the formulation of 
Travoprost 0.004% PQ with the exception of a lower concentration of the active ingredient, 
travoprost. 
The same studies have been submitted as those that were provided to the marketing 
authorization application for Travoprost 0.004% preserved with BAK, Travoprost 0.004% 
preserved with sofZia, and Travoprost 0.004% preserved with polyquaternium (POLYQUAD 
[PQ]).

With regards to the environmental risk assessment, the available data do not allow to conclude 
on the potential risk of travoprost to the environment. A log Kow value measured according to 
Partition Coefficient (n-octanol/water) OECD Guideline 123 for testing of chemicals “Partition 
Coefficient (1-Octanol/Water): Slow-Stirring Method” was provided (4.483). However, the report 
provided by the Company did not meet the criteria set out in the relevant OECD Guideline.  
Sections 5.3 and 6.6 of the SmPC and Section 5 of the PL include wording that adequately 
reflects the above and captures also data and knowledge from the originally submitted dossier 
for the previously authorised travatan 40 µg /ml. 
Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the non-clinical aspects of Travoprost 0.003% have been adequately documented and 
meet the requirements to support this application. 
No issues of concern have been detected in regards to the non-clinical information of Travoprost 
0.003% Solution provided.  
However, the study that ascertained the log Kow value for travoprost (4.483) was not carried out 
according to the criteria set out in the relevant OECD Guideline. Therefore, the log Kow value of 
4.483 as determined in this study is questionable. In order to conclude on the exact log Kow, its 
value should be determined strictly according to the guideline of the method chosen.  
Adequate wording is included in the relevant sections of the SmPC and PL that reflect the above 
assessment. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The clinical development plan for Travoprost 0.003% Solution is based on one pivotal, Phase 3, 
safety and efficacy study (C-11-034).  
•  Tabular overview of clinical studies 
Izba Assessment Report  
EMA/13480/2014 
Page 23/62 
 
  
  
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No new pharmacokinetic data were specifically generated to evaluate the absorption, 
distribution, metabolism and excretion of Travoprost 0.003% solution in humans. The reason 
why these studies were not conducted was based on rabbit ocular tissue distribution and plasma 
data that showed both Cmax and AUC0-6h levels were very similar following topical ocular doses 
of Travoprost 0.004% BAK, and with Travoprost 0.004% PQ, that is formulated in the same 
vehicle as Travoprost 0.003% Solution. Therefore, it was considered acceptable to expect that 
ocular and systemic exposure levels would be approximately dose proportionally less with 
Travoprost 0.003% Solution compared to Travoprost 0.004% BAK and Travoprost 0.004% PQ. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No pharmacokinetics drug interaction studies with travoprost and other medicinal products have 
been conducted. This is reflected in section 4.5 of the SmPC.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No specific studies were conducted to evaluate the pharmacodynamics of Travoprost 0.003% 
Solution in humans. 
Mechanism of action 
The pharmacodynamic action of ophthalmically applied prostaglandin agonists, including 
travoprost, has been well characterised and no new studies have been conducted relating to the 
underlying mechanism of action. Travoprost is the isopropyl ester pro-drug of a potent and 
Izba Assessment Report  
EMA/13480/2014 
Page 24/62 
 
  
  
 
selective F-prostanoid (FP) prostaglandin receptor agonist. It belongs to the pharmacological 
class of PGF2α agonists that includes other globally established marketed IOP-lowering agents.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Prostaglandin analogues are currently the most widely prescribed first-line ocular hypotensive 
agents. They exert their therapeutic effect by increasing the outflow of aqueous humour via the 
trabecular meshwork and uveoscleral pathways.   
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Given the available data generated for pre-existing formulations, the absence of pK or pD studies 
with the intended concentration was considered to be acceptable. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The Applicant submitted an application for a new formulation of travoprost in which the 
concentration of the active has been reduced to 30mcg/ml from the 40mcg/ml previously 
authorised (Travatan). The indications and frequency of application remain unchanged. Given the 
topical nature of the product, and well-characterised therapeutic characteristics of travoprost, no 
clinical pharmacology studies with the new formulation were conducted. Instead, the application 
was supported by a pivotal efficacy and safety study, as discussed below. This was considered 
adequate and acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies and main clinical studies 
The 30mcg/ml concentration in Izba represents a 25% reduction in concentration compared to 
currently licensed travoprost (Travatan) formulations. No dose selection study was conducted in 
order to find out a lower, efficacious dose. The selection of the 0.003% concentration was based 
on dose-response clinical studies conducted during the early development of Travoprost 0.004% 
BAK. Study C-96-52, and C-97-02 evaluated travoprost concentrations ranging from 0.0001% to 
0.006%, and on one preclinical pharmacokinetics study including Travoprost 0.003% Solution (P-
11-510). 
Izba Assessment Report  
EMA/13480/2014 
Page 25/62 
 
  
  
A dose-dependent response (IOP reduction) was observed in the low dose range explored. Doses 
equal or higher than 0.002% reached significant (and quantitatively similar) IOP reductions. The 
greatest IOP lowering efficacy was shown by Travoprost 0.004%. This effect was confirmed 
during the Phase III. The travoprost 0.003% concentration was not specifically tested in those 
trials. It may be hypothesised that lower doses (e.g.: 20 µg/mL or 25 µg/mL) could have also 
been an option. Upon CHMP request, however, the Applicant adequately justified the safety and 
efficacy of the selected strength. However, in order to better address this topic, the MAH was 
encouraged to consider the possibility to explore the efficacy of a lower concentration product, 
given that studies with the 30 µg/ml dose, PD and historical clinical data indicate that there is a 
potential for even lower doses. 
Pivotal Study C-11-034: A Multicenter, Double-Masked Study of the Safety and Efficacy of 
Travoprost Ophthalmic Solution, 0.003% Compared to Travatan in Patients with Open-Angle 
Glaucoma or Ocular Hypertension. 
Methods 
The pivotal study (C-11-034) was a multicentre, randomized, double-masked, parallel-group 
clinical trial. This study was conducted at 60 investigational centres, including 52 in the USA and 
8 in EU (Sweden, Germany, Austria, Spain and Finland). In this study, the new formulation 
Travoprost 30 µg/ml solution preserved with polyquaternium (POLYQUAD [PQ] (study drug) was 
compared with Travatan 40µg/ml solution preserved with BAK (comparator). 
Izba Assessment Report  
EMA/13480/2014 
Page 26/62 
 
  
  
 
 
The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate that the IOP-lowering efficacy of 
Travoprost 0.003% PQ-preserved (Izba) is equivalent to Travoprost 40 µg/ml BAK- preserved in 
patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. 
The study was conducted in 2 phases: Phase 1 (Screening/Eligibility Phase) and Phase 2 
(Treatment Phase).  
After meeting all eligibility criteria, patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups within 
each investigational site. The use of a randomisation code to assign study drug protected against 
selection bias (i.e., the tendency to place patients with a greater chance of treatment success on 
a treatment believed to have greater efficacy). Further stratification of the randomisation (by 
investigational centre and 8 AM baseline IOP of the study eye) was intended to ensure balanced 
baseline IOP measurements between treatment groups. Patients ≥18 years of age, diagnosed of 
open-angle glaucoma (with or without pseudoexfoliation or pigment dispersion component) or 
ocular hypertension and a mean IOP ≥ 24 mmHg at the 8 AM time point and ≥ 21 mmHg at the 
10 AM and 4 PM time points at entry were recruited.  
On-therapy evaluations at Weeks 2 and 6 then Month 3 were considered sufficient to monitor 
patient safety.  
The study was double-masked, and neither the patient nor the study personnel who conducted 
the assessments had knowledge of the assigned treatment sequence, ensuring that the 
evaluations were not influenced by knowledge of the identity of specific treatments. 
The choice of the reference (control) treatment is discussed “Treatments” below. 
Study Participants  
Patients with a diagnosis of open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were eligible provided 
they met standard entry inclusion/exclusion criteria which were consistent with those applied 
previously in the clinical trials for Travoprost.  
Entry criteria were such that randomised patients demonstrated IOP elevations (lower limit 24 
mmHg at 8 am; 21 mmHg at 10 am and 4 pm) which were representative of most populations 
with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. They were also consistent with entry criteria 
selected in the pivotal studies conducted previously for all currently approved Travatan 0.004% 
formulations. An upper limit of 36 mmHg was chosen to avoid enrolling patients who, during the 
washout period, could develop IOP levels that might cause additional glaucomatous damage.  
For each patient, only one eye was designated the “study eye” for analysis purposes, and this 
corresponded to the most severely affected one (defined as the eye with the higher IOP at 8am 
averaged across the two eligibility visits, or if equally affected, then the one with the higher IOP 
at the next time point(s). If the pressures remained equal at each of the three time-points, then 
the default was to designate the right eye. This approach had been accepted by regulatory 
authorities for previous applications and was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
The washout schedule and IOP eligibility criteria are shown in Tables 3 and 4):

EMA/13480/2014 
Page 27/62 
 
  
  
 
 
Table 3: Washout period prior to dosing 
Table 4: Qualifying IOP at Eligibility Visits (1 and 2) 
The same eye was required to qualify at each time point. The Eligibility 2 visit was conducted 3 
to 8 days after the Eligibility 1 visit. Two eligibility visits were important to ensure a stable 
baseline for IOP, reduce the risk of regression to the mean and ensure valid assessment of IOP 
reduction while on treatment. 
A study duration of 3 months was considered sufficient to establish the efficacy of an IOP-
lowering therapy. With regard to long-term safety, there is an extensive database relating to the 
safety of the higher strength Travoprost  (both via clinical trials with a duration up to 5 years as 
well as post-approval experience) and therefore longer term safety with the lower strength,  
0.003%, formulation was not considered necessary. 
Treatments 
Choice of the Control Group 
Travatan preserved with BAK was selected as comparator arm in the study, although this 
formulation is no longer marketed in the USA or the EU. This was justified by the applicant on 
the following basis:

The BAK-preserved formulation served as the reference product in clinical studies 
supporting marketing authorisation in the EU for Travatan preserved with PQ and in the 
USA for Travatan preserved with SofZIA.  
The safety and efficacy of Travatan preserved with BAK has been well-established 
through clinical studies and over the course of >10 years’ post-marketing experience.  
Travatan preserved with BAK is the only formulation that had been approved in both the 
EU and USA, allowing a single global multi-centre study to be conducted.

•  Comparison against the original formulation (Travatan preserved with BAK) rather than 
the subsequent formulations preserved with PQ, avoids the potential for “bio-creep” 
associated with non-inferiority/equivalence trials over time that may otherwise involve 
progressively less effective active controls. 
IOP evaluations 
During the treatment phase, visits were performed at Week 2, Week 6 and Month 3 and at these 
visits the primary parameter, IOP, was assessed at the same time points as at Eligibility visits 1 
and 2 (8am, 10am and 4pm). The timing of the visits was consistent with those used previously 
for the MAs of the Travoprost 0.004% formulations to allow validation with the efficacy data 
obtained for the higher strength products.  
Objectives 
To demonstrate that the IOP-lowering efficacy of Izba (travoprost 0.003% PQ-preserved) is 
equivalent to that of Travatan (travoprost 0.004% BAK-preserved) in patients with open-angle 
glaucoma or ocular hypertension.  
Outcomes/endpoints: 
Efficacy 
Primary Endpoint:  IOP at Week 2, Week 6, and Month 3 for each assessment time point (8 AM, 
10 AM, and 4 PM) 
The supportive endpoints included the change in IOP from baseline, the percent change in IOP 
from baseline, the percentage of patients who achieved a target IOP level of < 18 mmHg, and 
the percentage of patients who achieved IOP-lowering of at least 30% from baseline. 
Safety 
Adverse events, best corrected visual acuity, ocular signs, visual field function tests, central 
corneal thickness, ocular hyperaemia, dilated fundus exam. 
Sample size 
The sample size estimate was based upon a SD for IOP of 3.5 mmHg, a 5% chance of a Type I 
error, and an assumption that the population means in the 2 groups were identical. 720 patients 
were subsequently planned to ensure that at least 640 patients (320 per treatment group) were 
followed for 3 months, in order to provide: 
•  ≥ 99% power that a 95% 2-sided CI of the difference in IOP would fall within ± 1.5 mmHg 
•  ≥90% power that a 95% 2-sided CI of the difference in IOP would fall within ± 1.0 mmHg.

for the Travoprost 0.003% Solution group minus the Travatan  group) at Weeks 2 and 6, and 
Month 3 and at assessment time points (8 am, 10 am, and 4 pm)  
Randomisation 
Patients were randomised using an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS). Randomisation 
was stratified, within the investigational centre,  according to the 8 am baseline IOP 
measurement in the study eye in order to ensure baseline measurement ranges (low: 24–27 
mmHg; high: 28–36 mmHg) were balanced between study drug groups.  
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-masked study to ensure that the assessments were not influenced by the 
knowledge of the specific treatment identity. The patients, the Investigators, the investigational 
centre staff, the Sponsor, and the clinical monitors were not aware of the treatment assigned to 
the individual study patients. The external packaging of the study drugs was identical. 
Statistical methods 
Primary and Secondary Efficacy analyses were based on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population – 
the ITT population being defined as all those who received study medication study medication 
and had at least one scheduled on-therapy study visit.  
The Per Protocol (PP) population included all those who received study medication, had at least 
one scheduled on-therapy study visit and, in addition and satisfied inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
This was used for supportive analysis of the primary endpoint. 
In accordance with ICH E9 (Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials) results from both data sets 
have been included in the Clinical Study Report to support the robustness of the efficacy findings.  
The primary analysis of both the ITT and PP analysis sets was based on an observed case (OC) 
analysis.  
The statistical model employed, and its associated analysis, was considered robust for random 
missing data.  For the primary efficacy endpoint, a sensitivity analysis using last-observation-
carried forward (LOCF) on the primary analysis set (ITT) was performed. The LOCF was used to 
impute values for dropouts and for missing data for IOP values at all on-therapy visits for the 
primary efficacy analysis using the ITT data set. If a patient missed an on-therapy visit, the most 
recently measured on-therapy IOP for the same time of day was used to impute the IOP at the 
missed visit. Similarly, if a patient is discontinued from the study, the last on-therapy IOP 
measurement for each time of day was carried forward to replace the IOP measurements for the 
visit.  
Overall, the results of 5 sensitivity analyses consistently supported the results obtained in the 
primary efficacy analysis that used the observed data. These analyses included a comparison of 
mean IOP measurements by visit using the treatment received (ITT), a comparison of the mean 
IOP measurements by visit using the ITT data with LOCF, a comparison of the mean changes in 
IOP measurements from baseline to each visit using the ITT data with LOCF, an analysis of the 
Izba Assessment Report

mean IOP with LOCF measurements by visit using a 2-sample t-test procedure (ITT), and an 
analysis of the change in IOP with LOCF measurements by visit using a 2-sample t-test 
procedure (ITT). Given this, the results of the study conducted without imputing missing data 
were considered robust. 
No multiplicity adjustment was needed for the primary hypothesis test since all 3 time points for 
all on-therapy study visits are required to satisfy the equivalence criterion via the intersection-
union principle, meaning that in order to demonstrate equivalence, all of the confidence limits 
must be within ± 1.5 mmHg, the margin of clinical relevance.  
In study C-11-34, which tested equivalence as the primary statistical objective, treatment group 
differences in mean IOP were examined with a pairwise test at each scheduled on therapy study 
visit and time point. Pairwise t-tests and confidence intervals (CIs) were based on the least 
squares means derived from a statistical model that accounts for correlated IOP measurements 
within patient and includes baseline IOP stratum and investigational centre as covariates. 
Descriptive statistics were summarised for IOP at each on-therapy visit (Week 2, Week 6, and 
Month 3) and assessment time point (8 am, 10 am and 4 pm). Equivalence was concluded if the 
2-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference in IOP (Travoprost 0.003% Solution group 
minus Travoprost 0.004% BAK group) was within ± 1.5 mmHg at each of the 3 time points (8 
am, 10 am and 4 pm) for each on-therapy visit (Week 2, Week 6, and Month 3). In addition, 
based on historical precedence, it was a requirement in the USA to also demonstrate that the 
majority of the confidence intervals also lay entirely within ± 1.0 mmHg and this was included as 
a requirement to establish equivalence for the purpose of US Health Authority (FDA) 
consideration only.  
Descriptive statistics were used to summarise IOP and each of the supportive efficacy variables 
at each on-therapy visit (Week 2, Week 6, and Month 3) and assessment time point (8 am, 10 
am, and 4 pm). Additionally, treatment group differences in the mean IOP change from baseline 
were examined using a pairwise test at each scheduled on-therapy visit and assessment time 
point. The pairwise tests were based on the least squares means derived from a statistical model 
that accounted for correlated IOP measurements within patient where the investigational centre 
and the 8 AM baseline IOP strata were included in the model. 
Results: 
Participant flow 
Overall, 864 patients were randomised; 442 to the Travoprost 0.003% Solution group and 422 to 
Travatan group. The disposition of the patients is shown in Figure 2. 
Overall, 24 patients (2.8%) discontinued early from the study, including 10 (0.2%) in the 
Travoprost 0.003% Solution group and 14 (0.3%) in the Travatan group (table 10.1.5).  
The most common reasons for discontinuation were AEs (n=7), followed by inadequate control of 
IOP (n=6) and patient decision unrelated to an AE (n=6) (table 10.1.5)). At least 96.7% in each 
group completed the study and the proportion of patients in each group who discontinued early 
from the study was similar. 
Izba Assessment Report

In general, similar percentages of patients in each treatment group discontinued due to an AE, 
and identical numbers of patients in each treatment group discontinued due to a decision 
unrelated to an AE. A slightly greater percentage of patients who discontinued due to inadequate 
control of IOP were in the Travatan group (1.2% vs. 0.2% for Travoprost 0.003%).

Conduct of the study 
In 13 patients there were protocol deviations which were sufficient to exclude them from one or 
more of the analysis sets (Table 6).  
Table 6: Important Protocol Deviations Leading to Patient Exclusion from an Analysis 
Set
One patient in the Travatan group did not receive study drug and was therefore excluded from 
the ITT, PP, and safety analysis sets. An additional 3 patients (again, all on Travatan had no on-
therapy follow-up data and were therefore excluded from the ITT and PP analysis sets. Finally, 
nine other patients (six in the Travoprost 0.003% group and 3 in the Travatan group) violated 
one or more of the exclusion criteria and were therefore excluded from the PP analysis set. A 
further 27 patients (11 in the Travoprost 0.003% group and 16 on Travatan) had protocol 
deviations that resulted in data from one or more individual assessment time points being 
excluded from the PP analysis set. In all but one case, the deviation was the result of an 
inadequate time interval between dosing and the IOP measurement or a violation of an exclusion 
criterion. Two patients (1107 and 7801) were dispensed the wrong study drug at Week 6 and 
therefore had no data at Month 3 included in the PP analysis. 
Baseline data 
All 60 study centres, with one exception, randomised at least one patient and the enrolled 
patients were representative of the population that would be treated. No efficacy and safety 
differences due to ethnicity would be expected with Travoprost 0.003% Solution.  
The patient demographics confirmed that the study population was representative of the 
population that would expect to receive Izba. They are also consistent with the demographics of 
the population enrolled in the safety and efficacy trials that supported the approval of the 
40mcg/ml Travoprost formulations.

These are shown in Figure 2, above.

Outcomes and estimation 
Summary of main efficacy results 
The ITT analysis set was used to conduct the primary efficacy analysis. The PP analysis set was 
considered supportive and was used only for the primary efficacy endpoint. The safety analysis 
set included all patients who received study drug. The primary and supportive efficacy analyses 
were based on observed cases; missing data were not imputed.  
In order to conclude equivalence, the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in IOP between 
treatment groups (i.e., the mean IOP in the Travoprost 0.003% Solution group minus the mean 
IOP in the Travatan group) must have been within ± 1.5 mmHg at each of the 3 assessment 
time points (8 AM, 10 AM, and 4 PM) for each on-therapy visit (Week 2, Week 6, and Month 3). 
No multiplicity adjustment was needed for the primary hypothesis test. 
A sensitivity analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint was performed in which the last 
observation carried forward (LOCF) method was used to impute values in the ITT analysis set for 
dropouts and missing IOP data. In order to support the robustness of the LOCF imputation 
method for missing data, additional imputation methods were used to impute missing values for 
dropouts and missing data for both IOP and IOP change from baseline at all on-therapy study 
visits for the primary efficacy analysis using the ITT analysis set. Lastly, pairwise comparisons for 
changes in mean IOP from baseline were made at each on-therapy study visit and time point 
using a 2-sample t-test for both the ITT and PP analysis sets. 
A total of 864 patients were randomised to one of the treatment groups. A total of 860 patients 
were included in the ITT analysis. A total of 851 patients enrolled were included in the PP 
analysis. 
Within the ITT analysis set, the patients were primarily 65 years of age and older (55.8%; 
overall mean age = 65.2 years), female (59.7%), not Hispanic or Latino (87.8%), and White 
(72.4%); a substantial percentage of the patients were Black/African American (25.3%). A 
majority of the patients also had brown eyes (60.3%) and a diagnosis of open-angle glaucoma 
(69.1%). No clinically meaningful differences were observed between study drug groups in 
regard to any demographic parameter. 
No important differences were noted in mean baseline IOP measurements among the study drug 
groups (see table below).

The mean corneal thickness at baseline across study drug groups was 552.4 μm. No meaningful 
differences in baseline corneal thickness measurements were observed between study drug 
groups.  
Primary Efficacy Results 
The IOP-lowering efficacy of Travoprost 0.003% Solution was equivalent to Travatan at all on-
therapy study visits (Weeks 2, Week 6, and Month 3) and assessment time points (8 AM, 10 AM, 
and 4 PM on each visit day). 
The least squares mean treatment group differences ranged from -0.3 to 0.0 mmHg with CIs 
ranging from -0.7 to 0.4 mmHg. Thus, equivalence was met since all 9 of the assessments had 
CIs that were entirely within the prespecified ± 1.5 mmHg margin. Further, all 9 of the 
assessments had CIs that were entirely within a ± 1.0 mmHg margin.

Secondary Efficacy Results 
The changes and percent changes in IOP from baseline to each study visit and assessment time 
point showed no marked differences between treatment groups. 
The mean reductions in IOP within the Travoprost 0.003% Solution group ranged from 7.1 to 8.2 
mmHg; the mean reductions in IOP within the Travatan group ranged from 7.1 to 8.4 mmHg. 
The percent reductions in IOP from baseline to each study visit and assessment time point 
ranged from 28.4% to 30.7% 
Izba Assessment Report

Approximately 33% to 55% of the patients had an IOP measurement below 18 mmHg during the 
study. At every study visit and assessment time point, at least 43.9% of the patients in the 
Travoprost 0.003% Solution group and 44.2% of the patients in the Travatan group had a 
reduction in IOP of at least 30% relative to baseline. No marked differences were noted between 
treatment groups at any specific assessment.

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
One single clinical trial was submitted to support the efficacy and safety of the 0.003% strength 
for Travoprost. The main objective of the Study C-11-034 was to establish the comparability 
(non-inferiority) between Travoprost 0.003% PQ (the new formulation) and Travoprost 0.004% 
BAK (the original formulation). The travoprost 0.004% formulation was modified in 2010 in order 
to replace the preservative used benzalkonium chloride (BAK) by polyquaternium-1 (POLYQUAD, 
PQ) so that the comparator used in this trial did not exactly correspond to that available on the 
market at the time of submission of this MAA.   
No specific dose selection studies were conducted in order to find out if there could be a lower, 
efficacious dose. The rationale for the 30 µg/mL choice was based on the available data of 
studies previously conducted to support the marketing authorisation of the original formulation 
(Travatan BAK). Dose-response studies revealed that doses equal or higher than 0.002% 
reached significant (and quantitatively similar) IOP reductions. The greatest IOP lowering efficacy 
was shown by Travoprost 0.004%. This effect was confirmed during Phase III. Travoprost 
0.003% concentration was not specifically tested in those trials. The CHMP obtained satisfactory 
clarifications from the applicant over the justification of the dose chosen. However, in order to 
Izba Assessment Report  
EMA/13480/2014 
Page 40/62 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
better address this topic, the MAH is encouraged to further investigate the efficacy of a lower 
concentration product, since studies with the 30 µg/ml dose, PD and historical clinical data 
indicate that even lower doses may be also applied. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study C-11-034 was performed with the aim to demonstrate the non-inferior IOP lowering 
efficacy of a reduced concentration formulation of travoprost (polyquad preserved Travoprost 
0.003) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The non-inferiority was 
determined versus Travatan BAK (benzalkonium preserved Travoprost 0.004%) instead of the 
currently available polyquad preserved Travoprost 0.004% formulation. The Applicant has 
justified the choice on the fact that the original dossier was performed with the BAK formulation. 
In addition, the non-inferiority between Travoprost 0.004% BAK and PQ formulations was 
demonstrated. However, in order to provide robustness to the comparison the inclusion of the 
currently available formulation (even a third arm as internal control) would have been of help.  
In this new formulation the amount of travoprost (30 µg/mL) has been reduced of one fourth 
from the original concentration (40 µg/mL). This precise concentration had not been previously 
tested, although doses between 20 µg and 60 µg/mL showed some efficacy. Whereas the safety 
profile of the product improved with the replacement of benzalkonium preservative (mainly those 
adverse effect due to corneal irritation, such as itching and dryness), topical prostaglandins are 
associated with a number of well-known ocular side effects (hyperaemia, eye irritation, increase 
in the number and length of eyelashes, changes in the iris and lash pigmentation). Therefore, the 
key issue was to establish if the proposed reduction in concentration of travoprost had a relevant 
benefit on the safety of the product without having impact on the IOP lowering effect.  
Study C-11-34 is a multicentre, double-masked, randomized, active controlled parallel group 
study comparing the efficacy of Travoprost 0.004% BAK and Travoprost 0.003% PQ in patients 
with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension requiring IOP-lowering therapy. The global 
design of the clinical study (including the selection criteria of the patients, the duration of the 
study, the choice of endpoints) is in general acceptable and in agreement with other similar trials 
in the field. 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the IOP achieved at Week 2, Week 6 and Month 3 for each 
assessment time point (8 AM, 10 AM, 4 PM).  Beyond absolute IOP levels (primary endpoint), the 
efficacy measured in terms of IOP changes from baseline (absolute and percent differences) and 
responder rates (patients achieving IOP < 18 mmHg, patients achieving IOP-lowering ≥30% 
from baseline) measured as secondary outcomes seem to be of special relevance.  
The non-inferiority is to be shown at all three time-points (8 AM, 10 AM, 4 PM) at every follow-up 
visit (week 2, week 6, month 3), for a total of 9 successful non-inferiority tests.  The non-
inferiority margin of 1.5 mmHg has been used in other similar trials in the past (included the 
Study C-08-40, where Travoprost 0.004% BAK and Travoprost 0.004% PQ were compared). This 
is considered appropriate. Standard time points for IOP measurements (where the time the 
highest IOP and the maximal IOP lowering effect are included) have been selected.   
The main proof of non-inferiority has been performed on the intent-to-treat analysis set. 
Whereas analyses on the full analysis set (i.e. ITT) have generally been considered not 
Izba Assessment Report  
EMA/13480/2014 
Page 41/62 
 
  
  
conservative for non-inferiority studies (‘ICH Topic E9 - Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials’ 
(CPMP/ICH/363/96), it should be noted that it also has been specified that both analyses have 
equal importance and should lead to similar conclusions (‘Points to Consider on Switching 
between Superiority and Non-Inferiority’ (CPMP/EWP/482/99). In this sense, although the Per 
Protocol (PP) set would have been the preferred population for a non-inferiority analysis,  
disparities between ITT and PP analysis set would not be expected in order to demonstrate the 
non-inferiority between both treatments and provide robustness to the results. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 864 patients (442 patients in Travoprost 0.003% and 422 in Travoprost 0.004%) were 
randomised. A total of 860 patients (442 in Travoprost 0.003% and 418 in Travoprost 0.004%) 
were evaluable for ITT analysis and 851 patients (436/415) were evaluable for PP analysis.  
More than 97% of patients completed the treatment period. A total of 24 patients, 14 (3.3%) on 
Travoprost 0.004% BAK versus 10 patients (2.3%) on Travoprost 0.003% PQ discontinued the 
study. Lack of control of IOP was reported more frequently in Travoprost 0.004% BAK than in 
Travoprost 0.003% PQ group (5 vs 1), what was in principle unexpected. No relevant differences 
between groups were observed with respect to other reasons. 
Overall, treatment groups were well balanced with respect to demographic characteristics. As 
expected, mean age was 65.2 years ranging from 21 to 92 years old, which represents the broad 
spectrum of the target population. In fact, a high proportion of elderly patients (≈ 56%) were 
included. 
From these data equivalence was shown since all nine assessments conducted exhibited CIs that 
were entirely within the pre-specified ± 1.5 mmHg margin (actually falling within tighter CIs of a 
± 1.0 mmHg margin). Mean IOP reductions from baseline ranged from 7.1 to 8.2 mmHg for 
Travoprost 0.003% Solution and from 7.1 to 8.4 mmHg for Travoprost 0.004% BAK, 
corresponding to IOP reductions of 28.7% to 30.7%, and 28.5% to 31.0%, respectively. The 
magnitudes of IOP reductions are clinically relevant and consistent with those observed with 
prostaglandin analogues including Travoprost 0.004% BAK as shown in other reported studies. 
Numerically, a minimal better trend was measured for Travoprost 0.003% PQ group.  
The non-inferiority primary analysis was performed on the ITT analysis set, the PP analysis set 
being considered supportive. Whereas this hierarchy may be object of discussion (see comment 
above), no differences were observed between both analysis sets.  
Minimal differences between groups were also observed when changes in IOP with respect to 
baseline were compared. Results in PP analysis set were consistent. The 95% CI of the difference 
between both formulations are within 1 mmHg in all time points. Patients experienced about 
30% of reduction of the IOP with both formulations, and this response was numerically similar in 
the two groups. A greater variability was observed between the groups of treatment and the 
analysis population sets when the efficacy was measured in terms of responder rates. In any 
case, no relevant differences were shown.  
No long-term studies have been conducted with  the new Travoprost 0.003% formulation, but 
long-term studies (up to 5 years) have been conducted with the currently licensed Travoprost 
0.004% BAK and these studies have demonstrated the maintenance of the effect without

development of tolerance. The treatment duration in C-11-034 was 3 months and, based on 
published literature, this was considered adequate to demonstrate IOP-lowering efficacy of 
glaucoma medications. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
Non-inferiority of Travoprost 0.003% PQ with respect to Travoprost 0.004% BAK in the 
treatment of patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma was shown in study C-
11-034. Although the comparator used in this trial had a different preservative to that currently 
available in the market (Travoprost 0.004% PQ), the equivalence between the two 0.004% 
formulations was already proven and, therefore, the indirect evidence was considered sufficient 
by the CHMP.  
Adequate wording is included in the relevant sections of the SmPC and PL that reflect the above 
assessment. 
As a result of the Marketing Authorisation for Izba, two different strengths (one with the original 
concentration, one with the reduced one) will become available. The two strengths have shown 
equivalent IOP lowering efficacy and an improved safety profile has been observed for Izba. Upon 
request of the CHMP, detailed information on the marketing plans for the two strengths (such as 
approximate time of co-existence of both presentations, any steps proposed to address the 
potential impact of strength confusion and Travatan withdrawal date) was provided by the 
Applicant. The MAH informed the CHMP that the co-existence of the two presentations on the 
market is expected to be approximately 3 years. Activities intended to minimise the risk of 
confusion by the prescribers and patients appeared advisable. In particular, prescribers could be 
made aware of the marketing plans to prevent potential confusion between presentations, and 
should be informed on how to handle the transition from Travatan to Izba. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety analysis of Travoprost 0.003% solution is based upon the results obtained from the 
following sources of data: 
•  3-month pivotal Phase 3 safety and efficacy study (C-11-034), designed to demonstrate the 
equivalence  of  Travoprost  0.003%  Solution  to  Travoprost  0.004%  BAK,  both  dosed  once-
daily in the evening in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. 
•  A  comparison  of  safety  data  between  Travoprost  0.003%  Solution  (C-11-034  study)  and 
historical  safety  data  from  confirmatory  clinical  trials  involved  in  the  development  of 
Travoprost 0.004% BAK (C-97-79, C-97-72 and C-97-71), Travoprost 0.004% SofZia (C-04-
17), and Travoprost 0.004% PQ (C-08-40). 
Overall, the approach established for the safety analysis is considered acceptable. However, a 
direct comparison between Travoprost 0.003% and Tavoprost 0.004% using POLIQUAD as 
preservative in both formulations would have been preferable. This would have deleted any 
interference in the safety results derived from the different preservatives. On the other hand, 
some indirect comparisons between Travoprost 0.003% PQ (C-11-034) and historical data of 
Izba Assessment Report  
EMA/13480/2014 
Page 43/62 
 
  
  
 
 
Tavoprost 0.004% PQ (C-08-40) have been provided. This was considered acceptable as it allows 
obtaining estimated conclusions regarding the overall safety profile of Travoprost 0.003%. 
Only ocular parameters have been measured. However, given that lower systemic exposure is 
expected when travoprost is topically administered and considering that there is a large amount 
of data about the safety profile of travoprost 0.004% from clinical studies and post marketing 
data, the measurements performed are considered acceptable.  
Patient exposure 
On the whole, 442 patients were exposed to one drop of travoprost 0.003% solution in C-11-034 
clinical study.  
The  demographic  characteristics  of  patients  include  different  age  groups  (56%  of  patients  ≥65 
years),  patients  with  a  diagnosis  of  open-angle  glaucoma  or  ocular  hypertension,  races 
predisposed to  the  disease  such  as  Black  or  African  American  and  baseline  IOP ≥ 24  mmHg.  In 
general, the studied population is considered representative of the population that is expected to 
receive  Travoprost  0.003%  solution.  In  addition,  they  have  similar  characteristics  to  the 
population  included  in  the  historical  confirmatory  studies  involving  Travoprost  0.004% 
(Travoprost  0.004%  BAK  (C-97-79,  C-97-72  and  C-97-71),  Travoprost  0.004%  SofZia  (C-04-
17), and Travoprost 0.004% PQ (C-08-40)). 
In  general,  the  safety  population  included  in  the  main  study  (C-11-034)  is  considered 
appropriate for the overall safety analysis. The safety data collected from historical confirmatory 
clinical trials are considered supportive data. 
Duration  of  exposure  is  in  general  higher  than  87  days.  The  majority  of  patients  (73%  in 
travoprost  0,003%  group  vs  72%  in  travoprost  0,004%  group)  were  exposed  during  3  months 
approximately.  
Some  adverse  events  already  known  for  topical  PGAs  generally  occur  after  several  months  to 
years of dosing (e.g. periocular skin hyperpigmentation or discolouration, iris hyperpigmentation, 
and changes in eyelash characteristics). Given that these events are considered identified risks in 
the  RMP  and  there  is  a  considerable  amount  of  data  from  long-term  clinical  studies  and  post-
marketing  surveillance  with  the  already  approved  travoprost  formulations,  the  duration  of 
exposure is considered acceptable. 
Izba Assessment Report  
EMA/13480/2014 
Page 44/62 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Adverse events 
The overall safety profile might be similar from a qualitative point of view as both treatment 
groups contain the same active substance (travoprost). However, from a quantitative point of 
view some differences would be expected as travoprost strength has been reduced 25%. In 
addition, preservatives of both treatment groups are different (POLYQUAD vs Benzalkonium 
chloride) and therefore the occurrence of AEs could be either due to the active substance or to 
the preservative.  
As mentioned above, a direct comparison using the same preservative would have been the 
preferable approach. However, as no new AEs and no significant difference between treatment 
groups have been found during study C-11-034, an indirect comparison Travoprost 0.003% PQ 
vs Travoprost 0.004% PQ could be considered suitable to compare the two safety profiles. 
As expected, the majority of AEs reported for either treatment group during clinical trial C-11-
034 were local ocular effects and they were in general consistent with the known safety profile of 
the use of travoprost and topical ocular PGAs. 
The most common AE reported during the C-11-034 study was hyperaemia of the eye (ocular or 
conjunctival). A lower incidence of hyperaemia in Travoprost 0.003% group (12.7%) was 
observed in comparison to Travoprost 0.004% BAK (15.2%). When comparing each type of 
hyperaemia in both groups, a lower incidence was also seen with the lower dose of travoprost 
(ocular: 7.0% vs 8.1% and conjunctival: 5.7% vs 7.1%). 
Furthermore, concerning adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to study drug, the following data also 
showed a less incidence of hyperaemia with travoprost 0.003% in comparison to travoprost 
0.004% BAK at Month 3:  
•  11.8% vs 14.5% (total ADRs for hyperaemia) 
•  6.1% vs 7.6% (ocular hyperaemia) 
•  5.7% vs 6.9% (conjunctival hyperaemia) 
The 90% of hyperaemias were mild in severity. In relation to discontinuations due to 
hyperaemia, one patient in Travoprost 0.003% group discontinued compared to 2 patients in 
Travoprost 0.004% BAK group.  
Regarding local tolerance to the study medication (defined as the MedDRA preferred terms of eye 
irritation, eye pain, eye pruritus, eyelids pruritus, foreign body sensation in eyes and ocular or 
conjunctival hyperaemia), similar observations were reported between groups. 
Izba Assessment Report  
EMA/13480/2014 
Page 45/62 
 
  
  
 
 
Only one patient reported dark circles under the eye (classified under the SOC Eye disorders 
according to MeDRA). In addition, it is of note that no periocular skin discolouration, iris 
hyperpigmentation and changes in eyelash characteristics were reported. Given that these 
effects are related to the topical use of PGAs and likely related to the prolonged use of 
travoprost, the potential occurrence of these AEs over time cannot be ruled out. As a 
consequence, these events are already classified in the RMP as identified risks. 
Regarding non-ocular adverse events, one case of pruritus and one case of rash were reported as 
related to Travatan 0.003%. 
Izba Assessment Report  
EMA/13480/2014 
Page 46/62 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
On the other hand, it is of note that in general no new AE different from the already known 
safety profile for travoprost was reported.  
On the whole, safety data submitted for study C-11-034 seem to be reassuring as they are 
consistent with PGAs effects and with the already known safety profile for travoprost. These data 
are considered the expected results when a lower dose of travoprost is administered into the 
eye. In general, lower exposure to travoprost resulted in a slightly lower incidence of AEs 
reported in patients dosing with Travoprost 0.003% solution in relation to Travoprost 0.004% 
BAK. 
Regarding ADRs for hyperaemia when comparing both formulations including the same 
preservative POLYQUAD (travoprost 0.003% PQ vs historical safety data of travoprost 0.004% 
PQ), the following conclusions are considered relevant: 
• 
• 
These  comparative  data  will  provide  reliable  data  to  guarantee  a  conclusion  concerning  the 
possible improved safety profile of travoprost 0.003%. 
Lower exposure to travoprost causes less incidence of hyperaemia: 
11.8% in Travoprost 0.003% PQ 
15.1% in Travoprost 0.004% PQ 
38.8% in Travoprost 0.004% BAK 
•  Benzalkonium  chloride  seems  to  have  a  negative  impact  in  the  incidence  of  hyperaemia  as 
historical  data  for  Travoprost  0.004%  BAK  revealed  an  incidence  of  38.8%  vs  11.8%  for 
Travoprost 0.003% PQ and 15.1% for Travoprost 0.004% PQ.  
•  No  unexpected  safety  issues  were  identified  when  comparing  Travoprost  0.003%  Solution 
and historical AEs for Travoprost 0.004% (preserved with BAK, sofZia or PQ). 
Regarding ADR for ocular intolerance to the study medication, it is observed that the local 
tolerance is generally improved with lower exposure to travoprost in comparison to historical 
data (Travoprost 0.004% PQ, Sofzia or BAK). It is noteworthy that some different Preferred 
Terms (PTs) have been included for the assessment of the local tolerance (i.e. ocular discomfort 
in historical confirmatory studies and ocular hyperaemia/conjunctival hyperaemia in study C-11-
034). However, globally, all the results extracted from the seven PTs that cover the term 'local 
tolerance' reveal a lower incidence of AEs with Travoprost 0.003% PQ compared to historical 
data of Travoprost 0.004% (PQ, BAK and Sofzia). 
Izba Assessment Report  
EMA/13480/2014 
Page 47/62 
 
  
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
No unexpected ADRs different from the AEs already known for travoprost 0.004% were reported. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No patient deaths and no SAE related to study drug were reported in clinical trial C-11-034. 
Laboratory findings 
Data related to changes in ocular hyperaemia and ocular signs (eyelids/conjunctiva, cornea, 
iris/anterior chamber, lens, aqueous cells/flare) were reported. 
In general, the safety profile of the submitted medicinal product is slightly improved, in terms of 
hyperaemia, compared to the already approved travoprost. 
Izba Assessment Report  
EMA/13480/2014 
Page 48/62 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Furthermore, changes in hyperaemia score from baseline comparing both treatments groups 
revealed a lower incidence of hyperaemia with Travoprost 0.003% vs Travoprost 0.004% BAK 
With regards to historical data analysis (see figure below), treatment duration did not seem to 
have any influence in the mean ocular hyperaemia score. However, data showed that the 
incidence of hyperaemia seem to be higher at the beginning of the treatment. In addition, it is 
observed that day visits (8 AM and 10 AM) show a higher incidence of ocular hyperaemia than 
afternoon visits (4 PM). Regarding the mechanism of action of travoprost, these observations 
could be due to the maximum effect reached after 12 hours of administration, i.e. 8 AM.  
Data provided for ocular signs changes in study C-11-034 show that the number of patients 
suffering changes in ocular surface or adnexa parameters (i.e., changes in eyelid/conjunctiva and 
cornea) and in anterior chamber inflammation (i.e., changes in iris/anterior chamber and 
aqueous flare/cells) is lower with Travoprost 0.003% compared to Travoprost 0.004% BAK over 
the course of the study. These data reassure about the improved safety profile with a lower 
exposure to travoprost. 
Systemic adverse events 
Upon CHMP request, the Applicant provided summaries of the most frequently reported systemic 
adverse events reported during study C-11-034. Only pruritus and rash were reported as non-
Izba Assessment Report  
EMA/13480/2014 
Page 49/62 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
ocular adverse events related to Travoprost 0.003%. The rest of non-ocular adverse events were 
considered as unrelated to study treatment. Moreover, additional information related to the low 
systemic exposure to Travoprost 0.003% was also submitted. Therefore, proposed SmPC was 
considered acceptable. 
Safety in special populations 
No clinically meaningful difference in the safety profile of Travoprost 0.003% compared to 
Travoprost 0.004% (generally, local ocular ADR consistent with the already known safety profile 
of topical ocular PGAs) has been identified based on a patient’s age, gender, race, co-disease or 
concomitant medication. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Similar results concerning discontinuations due to an AE were observed for both treatment 
groups.  
The majority of AEs leading to patient discontinuation were known local ocular effects associated 
with the use of travoprost. In addition, the number of patients that discontinued study 
participation due to local ocular intolerance of the study medication was similar between the 
treatment groups. 
Post-marketing experience 
On the whole, the majority of post-marketing adverse events reported with Travoprost 0.004% 
were local ocular effects. Several post marketing notifications of systemic adverse events were 
also collected. Among them, palpitations (cardiac disorder), tinnitus (ear and labyrinth 
disorders), nausea (gastrointestinal disorder), hypersensitivity (immune system disorder), 
intraocular pressure increased and blood pressure increased (investigations), headache and 
dizziness (nervous system disorders), insomnia and depression (psychiatric disorder), dyspnoea

EMA/13480/2014 
Page 50/62 
 
  
  
  
 
 
and cough (respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorder), skin hyperpigmentation, erythema 
and hair growth abnormal and alopecia (Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorder) were the most 
frequently reported systemic AEs.  
No new or relevant safety findings and no meaningful differences of adverse events for 
travoprost 40 µg /ml preserved with BAK, PQ or Sofzia have been found. In conclusion, post 
marketing data with travoprost 40 µg /ml were in accordance with the safety profile observed 
during the clinical trial C-11-034 and support the safety profile of Travoprost 30 µg/ml.    
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
No unanticipated safety findings for Travoprost 0.003% were identified. In the 3-month study C-
11-034 involving Izba as monotherapy, the majority of AEs reported were for local ocular effects 
with a known causal association with the use of Travoprost and topical ocular prostaglandin 
analogues in general. The most common adverse reaction observed was hyperaemia of the eye 
(ocular or conjunctival) reported in approximately 12% of the patients.  
Hyperaemia of the eye had, however, a numerically lower incidence in patients exposed to the 
lower strength of travoprost (i.e., 0.003%) compared to those administered Travoprost 0.004% 
BAK. Moreover, a lower incidence of hyperemia of the eye was observed in patients treated with 
Travoprost 0.003% Solution compared to historical data with Travoprost 0.004% PQ. 
Therefore, no patterns has emerged over the course of Study C-11-034  that would suggest an 
issue concerning patient safety when dosing with Travoprost 0.003% Solution based on a review 
of the types and characteristics of SAEs reported and AEs leading to patient discontinuation in 
the study, coupled with an evaluation of overall patient characteristics. Overall, the findings with 
respect to SAEs and patient discontinuations from this study are in accord with historical clinical 
study data associated with Travoprost. Based upon a review of changes from baseline in safety 
assessments, no meaningful differences in visual acuity, visual fields, corneal thickness, or 
fundus parameters were identified. A trend towards less hyperaemia in the Travoprost 0.003% 
Solution treatment group was observed over the course of the study. In addition, a trend in the 
Travoprost 0.003% Solution treatment group towards fewer ocular sign changes from baseline in 
ocular surface or adnexa parameters (i.e., changes in eyelid/conjunctiva and cornea) and in 
anterior chamber was seen.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included 
in the Summary of Product Characteristics. Additionally, the supportive post-marketing 
experience with travoprost 40 micrograms/ml is also reflected in the SmPC and PL for Izba, to 
ensure that the most comprehensive information is made available in the product information.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, data obtained from the 3-month study C-11-034 are in general reassuring. Travoprost 
0.003% seems to present a more favourable safety profile in relation to Travoprost 0.004% BAK.  
Some adverse events already known for topical PGAs generally occur after several months to 
years of dosing (e.g.: periocular skin hyperpigmentation or discolouration, iris 
hyperpigmentation, and changes in eyelash characteristics). Given that these events are 
considered identified risks in the RMP and there is a considerable amount of data from long-term 
clinical studies and post-marketing surveillance with the already approved travoprost 
formulations, the duration of exposure is considered acceptable.  
As expected, the majority of AEs reported for both treatment groups during clinical trial C-11-
034 were local ocular effects and they were generally consistent with the known safety profile 
related to the use of travoprost and topical ocular PGAs. A reduction in the incidence of the most 
common adverse events (eye hyperaemia and AEs classified as ocular intolerance of travoprost) 
was observed when a lower concentration of travoprost was administered into the eye.  
Therefore, no patterns has emerged over the course of the Study C-11-034  that would suggest 
an issue concerning patient safety when dosing with Travoprost 0.003% Solution or any new 
safety finding for established Travatan based on a review of the types and characteristics of AEs 
(including those leading to withdrawal from the study) or SAEs. Overall, the safety findings are 
consistent with historical clinical study data associated with Travatan. With regard to specific 
ocular safety evaluations, no meaningful differences in visual acuity, visual fields, corneal 
thickness, or fundus parameters were identified during the study. In fact, there was a trend 
towards less hyperaemia and fewer ocular sign changes from baseline in ocular surface or 
adnexa parameters (i.e., changes in eyelid/conjunctiva and cornea) and in anterior chamber in 
the Travoprost 0.003% group.  
Izba is a new formulation of travoprost in which the concentration of the active has been reduced 
to 30mcg/ml from the 40mcg/ml previously authorised (Travatan). The indications and frequency 
of application remain unchanged. Given the topical nature of the product, the well-characterised 
therapeutic characteristics of travoprost, and the fact that the 30mcg/ml concentration in Izba 
represents a 25% reduction in concentration compared to the already marketed travoprost 
(Travatan) formulation, the CHMP considered that, following approval of Izba, the PSUR reporting 
should follow the one defined in the current EURD List entry for travoprost. Practically, the PSUR 
will combine all strengths of travoprost into one report, and a single PSUR assessment for all 
products containing travoprost as active substance should be followed.  
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Alcon developed a formulation of travoprost with a reduced concentration of active substance (30 
µg/mL instead of 40 µg/mL) to be dosed once-daily in the evening in patients with open-angle 
glaucoma or ocular hypertension. In the study conducted in support of the MA application (C-11-
034), Travoprost 0.003% showed to have a similar IOP lowering efficacy to that achieved by the 
0.004% concentration.  
Beneficial effects 
Overall, data indicate that Travoprost 0.003% presents a similar IOP lowering efficacy and a 
more favourable safety profile in relation to Travoprost 0.004% with BAK. A lower incidence of 
adverse drug reactions was reported when the lower concentration of travoprost was 
administered into the eye. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The main proof of efficacy of this application is constituted be the demonstration of non-
inferiority of the new formulation (Travoprost 0.003%) versus Travoprost 0.004% (Travatan) 
preserved with benzalkonium chloride (BAK). However, the Travatan formulation was modified in 
2010 in order to replace BAK with polyquaternium-1 (POLYQUAD, PQ). Thus, the comparator 
used in the pivotal trial does not exactly correspond to that of the Travatan currently available on 
the market.  The two Travoprost 0.004% formulations (BAK and PQ preserved) have, however, 
previously demonstrated to have similar IOP lowering effect, so that the similarity between 
Travoprost 0.004% PQ and Travoprost 0.003% PQ could be reasonably extrapolated. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Data from study C-11-034 revealed that Travoprost 0.003% may cause eye hyperaemia as the 
most common adverse event. In addition, eye irritation, eye pain, eye pruritus, eyelids pruritus 
and foreign body sensation in eyes (classified as 'ocular intolerance') were also reported as 
adverse events related to travoprost. These AEs are compatible with the already known safety 
profile of Travoprost 0.004% and with the known effects derived from the use of topical ocular 
PGAs.  
The Applicant identified the following important risks, for which adequate risk minimisation 
measures have been set in the Risk Management Plan 
• Macular oedema 
• Hyperpigmentation  
• Hypertrichoses 
• Iris and uveal inflammations 
Izba Assessment Report  
EMA/13480/2014 
Page 60/62 
 
  
  
• Cardiac and vascular disorders 
• Respiratory disorders 
• Hypersensitivity reactions 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
A direct comparison to the current formulation available in the market (Travoprost 0.004% PQ 
preserved) was lacking. However, the indirect evidence provided by the equivalence between 
both Travoprost 0.004% formulations (BAK and PQ preserved) was considered sufficient to 
overcome this uncertainty.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Izba (Travoprost 0.003%) presents a similar IOP lowering efficacy and a more favourable safety 
profile in relation to Travoprost 0.004% with BAK. A lower incidence of adverse drug reactions 
was reported when the lower concentration of travoprost preserved with PQ was administered 
into the eye, indicating that Izba may have a more favourable safety profile to the one of 
Travoprost 0.004% preserved with BAK. 
However, given the proven equivalence between the Travoprost 0.004% formulations (BAK and 
PQ preserved) the above constitutes indirect evidence that Izba may have a more favourable 
safety profile overall in relation to Travoprost 0.004%.  
Given that the co-existence of Izba and Travatan on the market is likely to be approximately 3 
years, upon CHMP request, the Applicant provided an outline of the activities intended to 
minimise the potential risk of confusion for prescribers and patients. These measures are related 
to different packaging and trade name for each product as well as education concerning the co-
existence of the two products on the market. 
Adequate wording reflecting the data submitted is included in the relevant sections of the SmPC 
and PL. 
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by 
consensus decision that the risk-benefit balance of Izba for decrease of elevated intraocular 
pressure in adult patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma is favourable and 
therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions:

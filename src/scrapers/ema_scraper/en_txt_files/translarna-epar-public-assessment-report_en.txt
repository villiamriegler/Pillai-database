1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The  applicant  PTC  Therapeutics  Limited  submitted  on  29  October  2012  an  application  for 
Marketing  Authorisation  to  the  European  Medicines  Agency  (EMA)  for  Translarna,  through  the 
centralised  procedure  falling  within  the  Article  3(1)  and  point  4  of  Annex  of  Regulation  (EC)  No 
726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 19 
April 2012. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy resulting from a nonsense mutation in the dystrophin 
gene, in patients aged 5 years and older 
The  presence  of  a  nonsense  mutation  in  the  dystrophin  gene  should  be  determined  by  genetic 
testing.  
Translarna  was  designated  as  an  orphan  medicinal  product  EU/3/05/278  on  27  May  2005. 
Translarna was designated as an orphan medicinal product in the following indication: Treatment 
of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. 
Following  the  CHMP  positive  opinion  on  this  marketing  authorisation,  the  Committee  for  Orphan 
Medicinal Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Translarna as an orphan medicinal product 
in  the  approved  indication.  The  outcome  of  the  COMP  review  can  be  found  on  the  Agency's 
website: ema.europa.eu/Find medicine/Rare disease designations. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article  8.3  of  Directive  2001/83/EC  -  complete  and  independent  application.  The  applicant 
indicated that ataluren was considered to be a new active substance. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain tests or studies. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0202/2012 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0202/2012 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare (1 in 3500 male newborns), disabling and ultimately 
fatal  X-linked  genetic  disorder  that  primarily  affects  males  [Emery  1991,  Worton  2001,  Khurana 
2003]. The disease is caused by mutations in the gene for dystrophin, a protein that is critical to 
the  structural  stability  of  myofibers  in  skeletal,  diaphragmatic  and  cardiac  muscle  and  is  also  of 
importance for the central nervous system and smooth muscles [Worton 2001, Khurana 2003]. 
DMD is caused by several types of mutations in the dystrophin gene such as deletions, insertions 
and  point  mutations.  Approximately  13%  of  patients  with  DMD  have  the  disorder  due  to  a 
nonsense  mutation  [Dent  2005].  A  nonsense  mutation  is  a  change  in  the  nucleotide  sequence  of 
DNA that is transcribed into a premature stop codon in the messenger RNA (mRNA) for dystrophin. 
This stop codon causes the ribosome complex to terminate translation prematurely and results in a 
truncated, non-functional protein.  
The  overall  prevalence  of  DMD  in  the  European  Union  (EU)  is  of  the  order  of  0.37  per  10,000 
[Orphanet  2011],  accounting  for  approximately  18,600  individuals  (current  EU  population 
estimated at 503,500,000) [Eurostat 2012]. Based on the estimation that in about 13% of all DMD

Regulation (EU) 2018/1725

patients  the  disease  is  due  to  a  nonsense  mutation  (nmDMD)  [Dent  2005],  it  is  estimated  that 
there are approximately 2,400 patients with nmDMD in the EU. 
The majority of genetic defects in subjects with Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy are large 
deletions  or  insertions  in  the  dystrophin  gene.  Point  mutations  leading  to  a  nonsense  codon  are 
relatively  rare  and  are  found  in  about  7-13%  of  the  DMD/BMD  patient  population.  In  DMD  the 
disease is caused by the lack of a functional dystrophin - a structural protein from the sarcoglycan 
complex important for stability of skeletal and cardiac muscle cell, but also expressed in the CNS 
and smooth muscle.  The concept of treating DMD subjects with a nonsense mutation is to promote 
production of a full-length dystrophin protein and hence restore its function in muscle cells. 
There  are  no  curative  therapies  available  for  DMD  and  the  current  management  of  the  disease  is 
based  on  prevention  and  management  of  complications  [Bushby  2010].  Corticosteroids  (e.g. 
prednisone  or  deflazacort)  are  the  only  pharmacologic  therapy  that  have  been  demonstrated  to 
temporarily reduce the decline in motor function in patients with DMD [Mendell 1989, Griggs 1991, 
Fenichel 1991a, Fenichel 1991b, Biggar 2001, Beenakker 2005a, Biggar 2006, Pradhan 2006]. 
Ataluren  is  a  first-in-class  oral  drug  which  is  claimed  to  enhance  ribosomal  read-through  of  non-
sense mutations in different genes. The mode of action of ataluren is believed to be related to the 
ability of this compound to interfere with the ribosomal translational machinery in such a way that 
premature nonsense stop codons in the mRNA are read through by the translational machinery and 
this  results  in  the  translation  of  the  entire  mRNA  and  hence  production  of  a  full-length  protein 
product.   
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Translarna  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  Duchenne  muscular  dystrophy  resulting  from  a 
nonsense mutation in the dystrophin gene, in patients aged 5 years and older (see section 5.1).  
The  presence  of  a  nonsense  mutation  in  the  dystrophin  gene  should  be  determined  by  genetic 
testing (see section 4.4). 
The recommended dose of ataluren is 40 mg/kg/day, divided in 3 doses (10 mg/kg in the morning, 
10 mg/kg at midday and 20 mg/kg in the evening) within 30 minutes of a meal.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The  chemical  name  of  Ataluren  is  3-[5-(2-fluorophenyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl]-benzoic  acid  and 
has the following structure: 
The structure of Ataluren was unambiguously confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR, UV spectroscopy, IR 
spectroscopy,  mass  spectrometry  and  elemental  analysis.  Physical  properties  were  investigated 
using  DSC,  TGA,  XRPD,  KF  (to  determine  water  content  and  hygroscopicity)  and  particle  size 
distribution. 
Ataluren is a white to off-white non-hygroscopic crystalline solid, practically insoluble in pH 1 and 
sparingly soluble at pH 6.6 in aqueous medium. Solubility is much higher in aqueous borate buffer 
at pH 8 due to the carboxylic acid functionality. Ataluren is also slightly soluble in acetonitrile and 
ethanol and freely soluble in DMSO, 1,4-dioxane and DMF.  Although dosed as a suspension, the 
active substance is milled to increase solubility in vivo. 
Ataluren  is  achiral.  Polymorphism  has  been  observed  for  Ataluren.  The  most  thermodynamically 
stable form is routinely made by the proposed manufacturing process. 
Manufacture 
Ataluren is synthesized from well-defined starting materials with acceptable specifications. Enough 
of  the  manufacturing  process  is  described  and  the  physicochemical  properties  of  the  active 
substance  are  well  controlled  by  the  process.  A  particle  size  reduction  step  is  required  to  ensure 
robust dissolution following formulation. Detailed information about the manufacturing process and 
process  development  has  been  provided.  Since  the  manufacturing  process  is  considered  as 
standard,  validation  will  be  performed  ahead  of  release  of  commercial  supplies.  A  validation 
protocol was provided. Separate manufacturing sites are used which carry out identical processes 
with the exception of differences in scale. 
The manufacturing process is adequately described. The characterisation of the active substance 
and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified 
by toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
All  relevant  impurities,  including  genotoxins,  degradation  products,  by-products  derived  from 
impurities  in  the  starting  materials,  synthetic  intermediates,  reaction  by-products  and  residual 
solvents  have  been  appropriately  characterised  and  are  controlled  by  the  active  substance 
specifications.  Sufficient  information  on  two  genotoxic  impurities  is  provided  and  these  are 
controlled  well  below  the  TTC  limit.  The  overall  control  strategy  is  traditional  and  includes 
adherence to process description parameters, a series of in-process controls during each synthetic 
step,  appropriate  specifications  for  starting  materials,  intermediates,  solvents  and  reagents,  and 
active  substance  release  testing.  Therefore,  the  manufacturer  has  good  control  over  the

manufacturing  process  and  the  described  control  strategy  is  considered  adequate  to  ensure  the 
required quality active substance. 
Specification 
The  active  substance  specification  includes  tests  for  appearance,  identity  (IR),  assay  (HPLC), 
impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), residue on 
ignition (Ph. Eur.) and particle size distribution (laser diffraction). 
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  non-compendial  methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. 
Batch  analysis  data  from  21  batches  of  active  substance  from  the  proposed  manufacturers  on 
commercial scale are provided. Batch analysis on a further 11 batches ranging from development 
scale  to  commercial  scale  from  a  previous  (no  longer  used)  manufacturer  are  also  provided  as 
supporting data. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on three commercial batches of active substance from one proposed manufacturer, 
and  three  pilot  scale  batches  from  the  other  proposed  manufacturer,  stored  in  the  intended 
commercial package for up to 48 months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for 
up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines 
were provided. Additionally, stability data on six additional pilot scale batches of active substance 
from a previous (no longer used) manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package for up 
to  60  months  under  long  term  conditions  at  25  ºC  /  60%  RH  and  for  up  to  6  months  under 
accelerated  conditions  at  40  ºC  /  75%  RH  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided  as 
supportive data. No changes to any of the measured parameters were observed over the course 
of the studies under either long term or accelerated conditions.  
The  active  substance  was  also  exposed  to  thermal,  humidity,  photolytic,  acidic,  basic,  and 
oxidative  stress  conditions  following  ICH  guideline  Q1B.  These  studies  further  establish  the 
stability of Ataluren and demonstrate that the analytical methods are stability indicating. 
The  parameters  tested  are  the  same  as  for  release  with  the  omission  of  those  unaffected  by 
storage  (heavy  metals,  ROI  and  residual  solvents)  and  the  addition  of  microbial  testing.  The 
analytical methods used were the same as for release. 
The  stability  results  indicate  that  the  drug  substance  manufactured  by  the  proposed  suppliers  is 
sufficiently  stable.  The  stability  results  justify  the  proposed  retest  period  in  the  proposed 
container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical development 
The  objectives  of  formulation  development  were  to  develop  an  immediate  release  solid  oral 
dosage  form of  Ataluren  suitable  for  consumption  by  paediatric  patients  and young  adults.  After 
initial clinical studies using powder in bottle formulation, granules for suspension were selected as 
the  commercial  dosage  form  since these  would  allow  reconstitution  in  liquid media  (water,  milk, 
fruit  juice)  or  semi-solid  media  (yoghurt,  pudding,  or  apple  sauce)  for  ease  of  administration  to 
the youngest patients.

The  active  substance  shows  pH  dependent  dissolution  characteristics  due  to  the  ionisable 
carboxylic  acid  group,  being  practically  insoluble  in  acidic  or  neutral  pH  and  soluble  in  basic 
aqueous  media.  It  has  been  shown  to  be  highly  permeable  in  in  vitro  assays  (BCS  class  II). 
Ataluren  has  a  bitter  taste.  Excipients  were  chosen  to  improve  powder  flow  properties  for  large 
scale  granulation,  to  aid  formation  of  a  homogeneous  suspension  given  the  poor  wetting 
properties of the active substance, and to mask the active substance taste. 
All  excipients  are  well  known  pharmaceutical  ingredients  or  food  additives  and  their  quality  is 
compliant  with  Ph.  Eur.  standards,  tested  to  be  suitable  for  pharmaceutical  use,  or  generally 
recognised  as  safe  (GRAS).  There  are  no  novel  excipients  used  in  the  finished  product 
formulation. The full list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
Compatibility  studies  between  active  substance  and  a  range  of  potential  excipients  tested  in 
formulation development were carried out under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) over 12 
weeks. The active substance was shown to be compatible with all tested excipients. 
The  granules  are  stored  in  moisture-excluding  aluminium  sachets  to  prevent  clumping  of  the 
granules over time. 
The  formulation  evolved  during  development  from  a  powder  to  granules,  which  is  also  the 
commercial  formulation.  Comparative  dissolution  data  indicate  that  all  previously  used  clinical 
formulations  and  the  commercial  formulation  have  similar  dissolution  profiles,  with  >85% 
dissolution  in  <15  minutes.  The  discriminatory  power  of  the  dissolution  method  has  been 
demonstrated. 
The  primary  packaging  is  child-resistant  heat-sealed  laminated  aluminium  foil  sachets.  The 
material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system 
has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used in the formulation. Magnesium 
stearate is derived from a vegetable source. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process is considered standard for the production of granules. Key steps in the 
process include roller compaction, milling and blending. Adequate process controls are in place for 
each  of  these  steps  to  ensure  the  quality  of  the  finished  product.  The  formal  validation  of  the 
process  in  the  production  facilities  has  not  yet  been  completed  but  will  be  carried  out  prior  to 
release  of  Translarna  to  the  market.  A  process  validation  scheme  has  been  provided  and  the 
applicant will validate the process before commercialisation. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  validated  tests  for  appearance  (visual 
description),  identification  (HPLC  and  UV),  assay  (HPLC),  degradants  (HPLC)  content  uniformity 
(HPLC), dissolution (HPLC), water content (KF) and microbial limits (Ph. Eur.) appropriate for this 
kind of dosage form. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three batches of 125 mg strength, nine batches of 250 mg 
strength and four batches of 1000 mg strength, confirming the consistency and uniformity of the 
manufacturing  process  and  its  ability  to  manufacture  the  finished  product  to  the  intended 
specifications.

Stability of the product 
A bracketing strategy was used to investigate stability: the 125 mg and 1000 mg strengths were 
tested  but  not  the  intermediate  250  mg  strength.  This  is  considered  acceptable.  Stability  data 
from three commercial scale batches of both 125 mg and 1000 mg strengths of finished product 
stored  under  long  term  conditions  (25  ºC  /  60%  RH)  for  48  months,  under  intermediate 
conditions  (30  ºC  /  75%  RH)  for  36  months  at  and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated 
conditions  (40  ºC  /  75%  RH)  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The  batches  of 
Translarna  were  identical  to  those  proposed  for  marketing  and  were  packed  in  the  primary 
packaging proposed for marketing.  
In  addition,  finished  product  in  the  proposed  commercial  packaging  was  exposed  to  light  as 
defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. 
Samples were tested for appearance, assay, degradants, dissolution, moisture content, microbial 
limits,  granule  particle  size  and  average  deliverable  powder  weight.  The  analytical  procedures 
used are stability indicating. 
None of the parameters tested showed any observable trends over the course of the stability and 
photostability studies. 
Since finished product granules can be reconstituted in liquid media (water, milk, fruit juice) and 
semi-solid media (yoghurt, pudding, apple sauce), in-use stability data have been provided which 
indicate the preparation in water at ambient conditions or that in other liquid or semi-solid media 
under  refrigerated  conditions  should  be  used  within  24  hours.  The  stability  data  also  supports 
transient excursion to room temperature for 3 hours in milk or yoghurt or 6 hours in fruit juice, 
pudding, or apple sauce. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are 
acceptable. 
The  applicant  will  conduct  stability  studies  on  the  first  3  commercial  production  batches  under 
long-term  (25  ºC  /  60%  RH)  and  accelerated  (40  ºC  /  75%  RH)  conditions,  and  1  commercial 
production batch per year thereafter. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information  on  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  active  substance  and  finished 
product  has  been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to 
the  conclusion  that  the  product  should  have  a  satisfactory  and  uniform  performance  in  clinical 
use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
The  quality  of  this  product  is  considered  to  be  acceptable  when  used  in  accordance  with  the 
conditions  defined  in  the  SmPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform 
clinical  performance  of  the  product  have  been  investigated  and  are  controlled  in  a  satisfactory 
way.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Ataluren (PTC124) is an orally bioavailable small molecule intended for the treatment of Duchenne 
muscular  dystrophy  resulting  from  a  nonsense  mutation  in  the  dystrophin  gene.  Ataluren  is  the 
first investigational new drug designed to enable ribosomal readthrough of premature stop codons, 
resulting  in  the  formation  of  a  full-length  functional  protein  in  patients  with  nonsense  mutation 
genetic disorders. 
The summary of the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology of ataluren provided below is 
based  on  the  non-clinical  summary  submitted  by  the  Applicant  and  available  information  on  the 
published scientific literature. 
Safety pharmacology studies and all pivotal toxicity studies were performed under GLP. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
A series of in vitro studies were conducted in different model systems to characterise the primary 
pharmacodynamics of ataluren. In HEK293 cells transfected with the luciferase gene engineered to 
have premature stop codons at codon 190, increasing concentrations of ataluren resulted in dose-
dependent  readthrough  of  full-length,  functional  luciferase  as  measured  by  chemiluminescence  in 
the HEK293 LUC-190 cell-based assays (Fig. 1). 
Fig. 1 
A dose-dependent readthrough and production of full-length, functional luciferase was also seen in 
a cell-free translation assay (LUC-190 mRNA with a cytoplasmic translation extract from HeLa cells 
(Fig. 2).

Fig. 2 
In  myotubes  isolated  from  the  mouse  model  of  nonsense  mutation  DMD  (mdx  mice)  testing 
ataluren concentrations of 0.1 to 30 μg/ml and in cultured human myotubes from nmDMD patients 
testing  concentrations  of  0.1  to  40  μg/ml,  a  bell-shaped  dose  response  was  observed,  with 
maximal induction of dystrophin at an ataluren concentration of 10 μg/ml. 
In  mouse  embryonic  fibroblasts  (MEFs)  isolated  from  the  mouse  model  of  nonsense  mutation 
Hurler  syndrome  (Idua-W392X  mice),  reduction  in  tissue  glycosaminoglycan  levels  due  to 
production  of  a  full-length  functional  enzyme  was  evaluated.  The  maximal  induction  of  enzyme 
activity was seen at an ataluren concentration of 10 μg/ml, indicating a bell-shaped response. 
The  ability  of  ataluren  to  read  through  premature  stop  codons,  thus  enabling  production  of  full 
length  functional  protein,  was  further  investigated  in  vivo  in  nonsense  mutation  mouse  models: 
nmDMD mdx mice, Cftr-/- FABP-hCFTR-G542X mice (a mouse model of nonsense mutation cystic 
fibrosis) and Idua-W392X mice (a mouse model of nmHurler syndrome).  
In the mdx mouse model of nmDMD testing three dosing regimens- oral, intraperitoneal (IP) and 
combination  of  both,  the  optimal  efficacy  was  observed  with  a  combined  oral  and  IP  dosing  (1.8 
mg/ml  via  a  liquid  diet  and  33  mg/kg  IP  TID).  Pharmacokinetics  were  performed  and  this  dosing 
regimen resulted in a trough concentration of approximately 10 μg/ml. Doses that would result in 
higher plasma concentrations were not assessed and the potential for a bell-shaped response could 
not  be  determined  in  this  model.  Overall,  ataluren  administration  resulted  in  protection  from 
eccentric  contraction  injury  and  in  reduced  serum  CK,  indicating  reduced  muscle  fragility. 
Dystrophin  was  seen to  be  located in the  cell  appropriately,  with levels  accounting to 20% of  the 
normal levels. 
During  the  procedure,  the  Applicant  submitted  additional  data  from  an  nmDMD  zebrafish  model 
indicating promotion of nonsense mutation readthrough (fig. 3).

Wild-type

ataluren 
In  an  in  vivo  model  of  CF  (Cftr-/-FABP-hCFTR-G542X  mice)  ataluren  administration  dose-
dependently  increased  expression  of  appropriately  located  full-length  CFTR  and  restored  CFTR-
dependent chloride channel function. When ataluren was administered to Idua-W392X mice, a bell-
shaped dose response was observed with maximal induction of Idua enzyme activity at an ataluren 
dose  of  0.1%  (in  brain,  spleen,  heart,  and  lung)  or  0.3%  (3.7  to  19  μg/ml)  (in  liver),  with  less 
  Li ,   et   al ,   I n  Pr es s  
activity at 1.0% (w/w).  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In  an  RT-PCR  assay,  LUC-190  (UGA)  mRNA  transcripts  were  monitored  to  determine  whether 
ataluren  might  affect  cellular  mRNA  levels.  Data  obtained  with  HEK293  LUC-190  (UGA)  cells 
incubated  with  ataluren  at  a  concentration  of  30  μM  showed  that  LUC-190  mRNA  levels  were  not 
altered. In a microarray analysis of mRNA levels assessing the effect of ataluren treatment, some 
transcripts (22 out of >54000) were different from  control cells at an ataluren concentration of 5 
μM. Results of both analyses indicated that ataluren did not globally affect the synthesis or stability 
of the mRNA at concentrations that enable readthrough of a premature stop codon. 
A series of studies was conducted, both in vitro and in vivo to evaluate the potential of ataluren to 
promote readthrough of normal stop codons.  
In a nonsense mutation luciferase-CD40 reporter assay, no readthrough of normal stop codons was 
seen at any of the ataluren concentrations tested (fig. 4)

Similarly,  no  readthrough  of  normal  stop  codons  was  observed  in  a  wild-type  luciferase-CD40 
reporter assay, with the normal UAA luciferase stop codon changed to a UGA stop codon. This was 
documented by the absence of the luciferase-CD40 extended protein product in cells treated with 
ataluren at concentration of 1, 10 and 100 μM. 
In a 2D gel analysis of ataluren effect on normal stop codons, HEK293 LUC-190 (UGA) cells were 
incubated with ataluren at a concentration of 5 µM. The only noted difference in the electrophoretic 
pattern of proteins from cells incubated with ataluren compared to those from vehicle treated cells 
was  a  protein  with  a  molecular  weight  and  charge  corresponding  to  the  luciferase  protein.  No 
aberrantly elongated proteins were produced. 
In order to evaluate the potential for off-target pharmacologic activity, evaluation of the ability of 
ataluren to block binding of ligand to 62 diverse receptors or enzymes (neurotransmitter receptors, 
enzymes,  steroids,  ion  channels,  secondary  messengers,  prostaglandins,  growth  factors  or 
hormones  and  brain  and  gut  peptides)  was  conducted.  Ataluren  did  not  significantly  block  ligand 
binding to any of the targets (inhibition of >50% was considered significant) at concentrations of 
10 μM (2.84 μg/mL) and 30 μM (8.52 μg/mL).  
Safety pharmacology programme 
Ataluren was evaluated in stand-alone and GLP-compliant safety pharmacology studies.  
The effects of ataluren on general activity and behaviour in the rat were evaluated at several time-
points after a single oral dose and after 7 consecutive daily doses of vehicle or 500, 1000 or 2000 
mg/kg/day of ataluren. There were no behavioural or physiological changes in rats when compared 
to vehicle control rats. A slight decrease (5%) in body weight on Day 2 was observed in the 2000 
mg/kg/day dose group. 
The  effects  on  respiratory  parameters  of  ataluren  in  single  oral  doses  up  to  2000  mg/kg  were 
evaluated in rat. Ataluren did not elicit any statistically significant or biologically important changes 
in respiratory parameters of tidal volume, respiratory rate and minute volume.  
The  potential  for  effects  on  cardiovascular  function  were  evaluated  in  vitro  in  a  human  ether-a-
gogo-related gene (hERG) assay and in vivo, in a single dose cardiovascular safety pharmacology 
study  in  telemetered  dogs  (in  doses  up  to  1500  mg/kg)  and  the  4-week  and  52-week  toxicology 
studies in dogs (in doses up 1500 and 1000 mg/kg/day, respectively). All studies were conducted

in  accordance  with  GLP.  In  vitro,  ataluren  inhibited  hERG  current  by  0.2±0.1%  at  10  μM  and 
4.1±0.1%  at  100  μM.  In  the  in  vivo  studies  in  dogs,  ataluren  had  no  effect  on  the  ECG 
morphology, heart rate and ECG intervals at any dose. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The  potential  pharmacodynamic  interaction  of  ataluren  and  representative  aminoglycoside 
antibiotics  was  explored  in  an  in  vitro  model  system  of  ribosomal  readthrough.  The  ability  of 
ataluren  to  enable  readthrough  was  reduced  in  the  presence  of  antibiotics  that  are  known  to 
interact with ribosomal RNA (gentamicin and tobramycin) but not in the presence of antibiotics that 
act through alternative mechanisms (aztreonam and colistin). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  pharmacokinetic  characteristics  of  ataluren  were  characterised  after  single-  and  repeat-dose 
administration in mice. The toxicokinetics of ataluren were assessed after single- and repeat-dose 
administration to animal species used in the toxicological evaluation, i.e. Tg.rasH2 wild type mice, 
rats, dogs and rabbits. 
Following  oral  administration  of  ataluren  to  mice,  rats,  dogs  and  rabbits,  the  drug  was  rapidly 
absorbed and eliminated in all species, with peak concentrations after single doses occurring 0.25 
to  4  hours  post  dose.  The  Tmax  tended  to  increase  with  increasing  dose  and  with  multiple  doses. 
The half-life was similar across the non-clinical species tested and ranged within 1.1 to 7.6 hours. 
There was no accumulation of drug in plasma upon repeated daily dosing. In rats, two peak plasma 
concentrations were observed, indicating entero-hepatic recirculation. Plasma exposure to ataluren 
in  all  species,  based  on  Cmax  and  AUC,  was  less  than  dose  proportional.  After  multiple  dosing, 
plasma  exposure  (in  particular  the  AUC  values)  decreased  after  Day  1.  Ataluren  showed  a  high 
plasma protein binding (98.4% in mouse, 98.7% in rat and 97.5 in dog). 
Following intravenous administration of a single dose to dogs, the systemic clearance averaged 123 
ml/kg.hr  and  the  volume  of  distribution  at  steady  state  (Vss)  was  0.21  l/kg.  In  a  bioavailability 
study conducted in dogs with intravenous and oral dosing, low bioavailability (7%) was seen, which 
corresponded to the observed low urinary excretion in this species (12% of the dose). In mice and 
rats, the excretion via urine and bile indicated high bioavailability (40% urinary excretion in mice 
and 90% urinary and bile excretion in rats).  
After  oral  administration  of  radio-labelled  ataluren  to  rats,  high  concentrations  were  found  in  the 
gastrointestinal  tract,  the  secretion  organs  (liver  and  kidney),  adrenal  gland,  brown  fat  and  lung. 
Low radioactivity concentrations were observed in the brain. The blood-to-plasma ratio of ataluren 
radioactivity was less than one, indicating that ataluren does not accumulate in erythrocytes. At 24 
hours  after  dosing,  radioactivity  was  still  observed  in  brown  fat,  skin  and  the  Harderian  and 
preputial glands.  
In  rats,  placental  transfer  of  radio-labelled  ataluren  and  excretion  in  milk  were  observed.  At  a 
single  maternal  dose  of  30  mg/kg,  the  concentration  of  foetal  radioactivity  was  ≤  27%  of  the 
maternal  concentration.  At  the  same  maternal  dose,  the  highest  measured  concentration  of 
radioactivity in rat milk was 37% of the maternal plasma concentration. Presence of radioactivity in 
pup plasma confirmed absorption from the milk by the pups. The composition of this radioactivity 
(parent compound and/or metabolites) was not investigated.

The  major  biotransformation  pathway  of  ataluren  included  acyl  glucuronidation,  reductive 
oxadiazole ring cleavage, oxidative deamination and hydrolysis. In all species, unchanged ataluren 
was the major component in plasma (ranging from 70 to 91%).  
Ataluren  was  not  metabolised  by  CYP  isozymes,  but  was  directly  glucuronidated  via  UGT1A9  in 
human  liver  microsomes.  No  non-clinical  studies  were  performed  by  the  applicant  to  evaluate 
potential  drug-drug  interaction,  but  based  on  the  in  vitro  data,  inhibitors  of  UGT1A9  or  drugs 
metabolised by UGT1A9 may have a clinically relevant effect on the metabolism of ataluren. 
In vitro studies indicated that ataluren was not a substrate for P-glycoprotein.  
Following  a  single  oral  dose  of  radio-labelled  ataluren,  the  majority  of  the  administered 
radioactivity  was  excreted  in  faeces:  54%  by  mice,  84%  by  rats  and  80%  by  dogs.  Most  of  the 
dose was excreted within 48 hours. The total recovery was >93% in the three species.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Single dose toxicity studies of ataluren were conducted in rats and dogs. The oral LD50 in rats was 
>2000 mg/kg, the highest dose tested. In an oral escalating dose study in dogs, ataluren was well 
tolerated  up  to  the  highest  dose  of  1600  mg/kg.  No  macroscopic  abnormalities  were  noted  at 
necropsy.  
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat dose toxicity studies of ataluren were conducted in mice for up to 29 days, in rats for up to 
26 weeks and in dogs for up to 52 weeks. Both 26-week toxicology studies in rats and the 52-week 
toxicology study in dogs initiated dosing in weanling animals to support dosing in children.

Genotoxicity 
Ataluren genotoxicity was evaluated in vitro in gene mutation tests in bacteria and in mammalian 
cells and and in vivo in rat. The studies and their results are summarised in Table 2. 
Table 2 
Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity  potential  of  ataluren  was  tested  in  mice  and  rats.  In  a  GLP-compliant  26-week 
carcinogenicity  study  in  Tg.rasH2  mice,  ataluren  did  not  increase  the  incidence  of  tumours  up  to 
the  highest  doses  tested  in  males  (600  mg/kg/day)  and  in  females  (300  mg/kg/day).  The  non-
neoplastic  findings  included  endometrial  hyperplasia  and  nephropathy  in  females.  In  a  GLP-
compliant  24-month  carcinogenicity  study  in  rats,  urinary  bladder  tumours  (benign  urothelial  cell 
papilloma  [2  rats]  and  malignant  urothelial  cell  carcinoma  [1  rat])  were  seen  in  3/60  female  rats 
dosed at 300 mg/kg/day. In addition, one case of malignant hibernoma was observed in 1/60 male 
rats  at  the  dose  of  300  mg/kg/day.  The  non-neoplastic  toxicity  consisted  of  a  decrease  of  body 
weight. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
The  package  of  reproduction  toxicity  studies  consisted  of  a  male/female  fertility  study  in  rats, 
embryo-foetal developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits and a peri/postnatal toxicity study 
in  rats.  In  the  fertility  study,  no  effects  on  male/female  fertility  were  observed  at  a  dose  of  300 
mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested, and the NOAEL for early embryonic toxicity was the same as 
in  the  rat  embryo-foetal  toxicity  study.  In  the  embryo-foetal  toxicity  study  in  rat,  embryo-foetal 
toxicity  consisted  of  increased  early  resorptions,  post-implantation  loss  and  decreased  viable 
foetuses and signs of developmental delay (increased skeletal variations). The NOAEL for embryo-

foetal  toxicity  was  100  mg/kg/day,  giving  an  exposure  margin  of  factor  4  compared  to  human 
exposure. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 30 mg/kg/day. 
Placental transfer of ataluren and distribution in the rat foetus was investigated with radiolabelled 
ataluren. At a maternal dose of 30 mg/kg/day, the concentration of foetal radioactivity was ≤ 1/3 
of the maternal concentration. 
In  the  rabbit  embryo-foetal  toxicity  study,  maternal  and  embryo-foetal  toxicity  was  seen  at  the 
highest tested dose of 100 mg/kg/day. Embryo-foetal toxicity consisted of decreased mean foetal 
weight and increased skeletal variations. At the maternal and embryo-foetal NOAEL, there was no 
exposure margin compared to human exposure. 
In  the  rat  pre/postnatal  developmental  toxicity  study,  significant  effects  on  maternal  food  intake 
and body weight and on offspring body weight and ambulatory activity were observed at a dose of 
150  mg/kg/day,  i.e.  at  an  exposure  5  times  higher  than  the  human  exposure.  The  maternal 
systemic exposure at the NOEL for neonatal toxicity was <3 and at the LOEL <4. 
Toxicokinetic data 
The toxicokinetics of ataluren were characterised after single and repeated daily doses of 75-1800 
mg/kg/day  to  mice  (including  the  mouse  carcinogenicity  study),  30-2000  mg/kg/day  in  rats 
(including  the  rat  carcinogenicity  study),  25-200  mg/kg/day  in  pregnant  rabbits  (in  support  of 
embryo-fetal development toxicology studies) and 200-1500 mg/kg/day in dogs. The toxicokinetic 
data  indicated  a  short  t½  and  also  showed  that  there  was  no  significant  drug  accumulation  in 
plasma  upon  repeated  daily  dosing.  Ataluren  exposure  increased  with  increasing  dose,  but  it  was 
less  than  dose  proportional  at  higher  doses.  There  were  no  sex-related  differences  in  ataluren 
exposure in dogs, but in rats and mice, exposure was slightly higher in females than in males. The 
major metabolite seen in mice, rats and dogs was ataluren acyl glucuronide. 
Local Tolerance  
No local tolerance studies were performed (see section 2.3.6).  
Other toxicity studies 
No juvenile toxicity studies were performed (see section 2.3.6).

The  maximal  measured  logKow  of  ataluren  is  4.15  at  pH  3.23)  which  is  below  the  PBT  screening 
criterion of 4.5. A full PBT assessment has therefore not been conducted. The refined PECsurfacewater, 
based  on  the  prevalence  of  Duchenne  muscular  dystrophy  (DMD)  originating  from  nonsense 
(premature  stop  codon)  mutations  (nmDMD)  is  calculated  to  be  0.0067  µg/L,  which  is  below  the 
threshold for progression to phase II ERA studies. It is concluded that Ataluren is not considered to 
cause a potential risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The  CHMP  considered  a  series  of  studies  were  conducted  by  the  applicant  to  characterise  the 
primary pharmacology of ataluren. These comprised in vitro studies in different cell model systems 
including  transfected  human  embryonic  kidney,  a  cell-free  translation  system,  myoblasts  isolated 
from  mdx  mice  and  nmDMD  patients  and  mouse  embryonic  fibroblasts  isolated  from  the  Idua-
W392X mice. The ability of ataluren to read through premature stop codons was also investigated 
in vivo using nonsense mutation mouse models of DMD, cystic fibrosis and Hurler syndrome. In the 
course  of  the  procedure,  the  applicant  submitted  results  from  an  additional  study  in  zebrafish  to 
further  support  the  mechanism  of  action  of  ataluren.  While  these  data  suggested  a  plausible 
readthrough  effect  of  ataluren  on  the  premature  stop  codons  under  certain  conditions,  the  CHMP 
also  considered  recent  publications,  e.g.  by  Mc  Elroy  et  al.  20131,  which  indicated  a  lack  of 
translational read-through activity for ataluren. The CHMP highlighted the conflicting nature of the 
data  available  and  the  fact  that  the  variability  of  results  across  test  systems  was  not  sufficiently 
characterised.  Nevertheless,  it  was  concluded  that  the  limited  understanding  of  the  variability  in 
the non-clinical setting would not be critical if sufficient clinical efficacy was shown. 
The  lack  of  readthrough  of  normal  stop  codons  was  supported  by  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  studies. 
Overall,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  experimental  data  provided  some  reassurance  that  no 
readthrough occurs at terminal stop codons level. Moreover, it was noted that a proteomic analysis 
of HEK293 cells, treated and untreated with ataluren, will be performed by the applicant, in order 
to  further  evaluate  the  potential  of  ataluren  to  promote  readthrough  of  normal  stop  codons.  The 
CHMP recommended that these data should be submitted for review once available, as appropriate. 
The bell-shaped dose response hypothesis (discussed further in the Clinical section) was supported 
by  data  obtained  from  a  number  of  in  vitro  test  systems  and  in  zebrafish  larvae  in  ataluren 
solution.  Additional  circumstantial  evidence  was  obtained  in  in  vivo  models  relevant  for  other 
diseases.  However,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  bell-shaped  curve  was  not  seen  in  the  in  vivo 
model of the DMD, i.e. the mdx mouse. Therefore, the applicant´s hypothesis that clinical efficacy 
follows a bell-shaped dose-response curve was only partly supported by the non-clinical data.  
Safety  pharmacology  studies  were  carried  out  in  order  to  assess  ataluren  effects  on  the  central 
nervous system, respiratory system and cardiovascular system. No relevant effects on the CNS and 
respiratory systems were observed in rats at doses up to 2000 mg/kg/day. Cardiovascular safety of 
ataluren  was  assessed  in  vitro  and  in  vivo.  No  relevant  inhibition  of  ataluren  on  cloned  hERG

channels  expressed  in  mammalian  cells  was  observed  up  to  a  free  concentration  of  100  µM.  The 
results of in vivo studies in dogs assessing cardiovascular safety indicated that ataluren dosed up 
to 1500 mg/kg did not elicit any biologically important changes in cardiovascular parameters. 
The  potential  pharmacodynamic  interactions  of  ataluren  were  explored.  Of  note,  ataluren 
readthrough  effect  was  reduced  in  the  presence  of  antibiotics  known  to  interact  with  ribosomal 
RNA. These studies suggested that there was no benefit to co-administration of systemic or inhaled 
aminoglycoside  antibiotics  during  treatment  with  ataluren  and  moreover,  that  the  efficacy  of 
ataluren would be reduced during such co-administration. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacokinetics  of ataluren  were  adequately  characterised  in  the 
non-clinical programme. 
The applicant conducted an adequate toxicology programme for ataluren. All pivotal toxicity studies 
were performed in compliance with GLP. Only the oral route of administration was investigated in 
all tested species, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.  
The  most important  toxicity  identified  in  mice  after  repeated  dosing  was  nephrotoxicity.  No  NOEL 
and  no  significant  exposure  margin  compared  to  human  exposure  could  be  established.  Although 
this toxicity was not seen in the other species tested, i.e. rat and dog, since its mechanism in mice 
is not known, the CHMP was of the view that its relevance for humans could not be ruled out. 
One  of  the  main  concerns  discussed  was  the  finding  of  malignant  hibernomas  in  rat.    While  this 
finding was made only in this species, similarly to renal toxicity in mice, the CHMP concluded that 
occurrence of similar effects in humans could not be excluded, particularly in the young population, 
where the quantity of the brown adipose tissue is higher. In particular, the CHMP considered that 
malignant  hibernomas  could  be  related  to  the  effects  of  ataluren  on  fat  tissue  metabolism  and  to 
effects  on  plasma  lipid  parameters,  which  were  observed  in  rats,  dogs  and  humans.  Thus, 
hibernomas  were  reflected  in  the  proposed  risk  management  plan  of  ataluren.  The  CHMP  also 
noted  that  the  applicant  will  perform  a  β3  adrenergic  binding  assay  with  ataluren  and  one  of  its 
metabolites to further investigate their potential effects in the brown adipose tissue in rats.  
In  addition  to  the  above  mentioned  effects,  several  other  less  adverse  effects  were  found  in  the 
repeat  dose  studies;  in  particular  decreased  body  weight  gain,  food  intake  and  increased  liver 
weight without a histological correlate. 
An  adequate  battery  of  genotoxicity  tests  was  conducted  and  the  data  did  not  reveal  any  special 
hazard for humans. 
No evidence of carcinogenicity was seen in mice. In rats, cases of hibernomas were observed in the 
carcinogenicity-  and  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies.  In  addition,  an  increase  of  rare  urinary  bladder 
tumours was found in rats, but the systemic exposure margin for these tumours compared to the 
human exposure was considered sufficiently high and the finding hence of unlikely significance. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  a  GLP-compliant  full  reproductive  toxicology  programme  consisting  of 
fertility  and  early  embryonic  development  study,  embryo/foetal  development  studies  and  a  pre-
/postnatal development study was conducted. 
The  lack  of  formal  local  tolerance  studies  was  considered  acceptable  by  the  CHMP,  as  ataluren  is 
intended for oral use and investigating the potential local gastro-intestinal effects was covered by 
the oral repeated dose studies. 
The CHMP considered that while no juvenile toxicity studies were performed, the repeated dose 26-
week rat studies started at the age of 4-5 weeks and the repeated dose 52-week dog study at the

age of 68-83 days. The CHMP was of the view that these studies were supportive of use in children 
older  than  4-5  years  (based  on  the  studies  in  rats)  or  slightly  younger,  3-4  years  (based  on  the 
study  in  dogs).  Overall,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  the  level  of  evidence  available  was,  from  the 
perspective of non-clinical toxicity testing, sufficient to justify ataluren administration to patients 5 
years and older, i.e. the patient population covered by the indication applied for. 
ERA studies did not indicate potential risks to the environment linked to ataluren. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the CHMP concluded that despite the identified weaknesses of the pharmacology data (on 
mechanism  of  action  and bell-shaped  dose-response  hypothesis),  the limitations  within  the  non-
clinical package could be considered acceptable, if sufficiently compensated by compelling clinical 
evidence.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
Although ataluren is practically insoluble in water, it is readily absorbed after oral administration as 
a suspension. Ataluren was rapidly absorbed with Tmax between 0.5 and 2.5 h after single doses in 
fasted  adult  healthy  volunteers.  Peak  plasma  levels  were  attained  approximately  1.5  hours  after 
dosing  in  subjects  who  received  medicinal  product  within  30  minutes  of  a  meal.  Based  on  the 
urinary  recovery  of  radioactivity  in  a  single-dose  study  of  radiolabeled  ataluren  under  fasting 
conditions, the oral bioavailability of ataluren was estimated to be ≥55%.  
The  effect  of  food  on  ataluren  bioavailability  was  investigated  in  study  001,  using  a  formulation 
(powder  in  bottle)  different  from  the  phase  2a/2b  formulation.  Based  on  PK  modelling  in  healthy 
volunteers and data from patients with nmDMD, no significant effect of food was detected on either 
the rate or extent of ataluren absorption.  
Ataluren plasma concentrations at steady state were dose-proportional for ataluren doses between 
10 and 50 mg/kg. No accumulation was observed after repeated dosing.  
Distribution 
In vitro, ataluren was 99.6% bound to human plasma proteins and the binding was independent of 
plasma concentration.  Ataluren did not distribute into red blood cells.  
Ataluren volume of distribution (Vz/F) varied between 393 and 689 l when single doses between 3 
and 200 mg/kg were administered in healthy volunteers. A lower volume of distribution (around 50 
l for a 70 kg adult) was determined in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. 
Elimination 
In vitro, ataluren was metabolized by conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 
(UGT)  enzymes,  predominantly  UGT1A9  in  liver  and  intestine.  Cytochrome  P450  system  was  not 
involved in the metabolism of ataluren. 
In vivo, the only metabolite detected in plasma after oral administration of radio-labelled ataluren 
was the ataluren-O-1β-acyl glucuronide; exposure to this metabolite in humans was approximately 
8% of the plasma AUC of ataluren.  
Ataluren  plasma  half-life  ranged  from  2-6 hours  and  was  unaffected  either  by  dose  or  repeated 
administration.  The  elimination  of  ataluren  was  likely  dependent  on  hepatic  and  intestinal 
glucuronidation of ataluren followed by renal excretion of the resulting glucuronide metabolite. 
After a single oral dose of radiolabeled ataluren, approximately half of the administered radioactive 
dose  was  recovered  in  the  faeces  and  the  remainder  was  recovered  in  the  urine.    In  the  urine, 
unchanged  ataluren  and  the  acyl  glucuronide  metabolite  accounted  for  <1%  and  49%, 
respectively, of the administered dose. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In study 001 conducted under fasting conditions, more than a dose proportional increase in AUC0-∞ 
of  ataluren  was  observed  over  the  studied  dose  range,  i.e.  3mg/kg  to  200  mg/kg.  In  study 
PTC124-GD-002-HV  under  fed  conditions,  dose  proportional  increase  in  AUC  and  Cmax  was  seen 
for  ataluren  between  doses  10  and  50  mg/kg.  After  BID  dosing  for  7  days,  plasma  exposure  of 
ataluren increased also in a more than dose-proportional manner. In healthy volunteers, after BID

dosing  of  50  mg/kg  for  14  days,  plasma  ataluren  concentrations  appeared  to  decrease  over  time 
with  the  linearity  factor  decreasing  to  0.6,  suggestive  of  non-linear  PK  at  50  mg/kg  dose  in  this 
study.  Data  from  clinical  trials  on  plasma  concentration  indicated  that  the  steady  state  is 
maintained  from  Week  6  (the  earliest  measurement  time)  through  more  than  two years  of 
treatment and based on the proposed popPK analysis it was estimated that 95% of the decrease to 
the steady-state value occurs within the first two weeks of therapy. 
Special populations 
Age 
Based on data from subjects ranging in age from 5 years to 57 years, there was no apparent effect 
of age on ataluren plasma exposure.  
Gender 
Females  were  not  studied  in  nmDMD  clinical  trials.    However,  there  were  no  apparent  effects  of 
gender on ataluren plasma exposure in other populations. 
Race 
The  pharmacokinetic  properties  of  ataluren  were  not  considered  to  be  significantly  affected  by 
UGT1A9 polymorphisms in a Caucasian population. Due to the low number of other races included 
in the clinical studies, no conclusions were drawn on the effect of UGT1A9 in other ethnic groups. 
Renal or hepatic impairment 
No studies were conducted in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.  
Non-ambulatory 
There were no apparent differences in steady-state relative bioavailability and clearance due to loss 
of ambulation.   
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Effect of other drugs on ataluren pharmacokinetics 
Based on in vitro studies, ataluren was a substrate of UGT1A9 and breast cancer resistant protein 
(BCRP).    Caution  should  be  exercised  when  ataluren  is  co-administered  with  drugs  that  are 
inducers of UGT1A9 or inhibitors of BCRP. 
Ataluren  is  practically  insoluble  in  the  pH  range  of  1.02  to  5.7,  with  only  limited  pH-dependent 
solubility within this range.  Since at the therapeutically recommended dose, PPIs have been shown 
to  increase  gastric  pH  from  average  of  1.4  to  median  values  of  3.5  to  5,  no relevant  interactions 
with PPIs and other drugs altering gastric pH are expected. 
In vitro, ataluren was not a substrate for the p-glycoprotein transporter.  The pharmacokinetics of 
ataluren  are  unlikely  to  be  affected  by  medicinal  products  that  inhibit  the  p-glycoprotein 
transporter. 
Effect of ataluren on pharmacokinetics of other drugs 
In  vitro,  ataluren  was  an  inhibitor  of  UGT1A9,  organic  anion  transporter  1  (OAT1),  organic  anion 
transporter 3 (OAT3) and organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B3 (OATP1B3).  Caution should

be  exercised  when  ataluren  is  co-administered  with  drugs  that  are  substrates  of  UGT1A9,  OAT1, 
OAT3 or OATP1B3 because of the risk of increase in concentration of these drugs. 
Based  on  the  in  vitro  data,  ataluren  is  not  expected  to  inhibit  in  vivo  the  following  transporters: 
BCRP, MRP2, BSEP, OATP1B1, MATE1, MATE2-K and OCT2. 
Furthermore, based on in vitro studies, ataluren was not expected to be an inhibitor of either p-gp 
mediated  transport  or  of  cytochrome  P450  mediated  metabolism.    Similarly,  ataluren  is  not 
expected in vivo to be an inducer of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes.  
Potential  interaction  between  ataluren  and  corticosteroids  was  investigated  by  analysing 
pharmacokinetics  in  Phase  2  nmDMD  patients  receiving  corticosteroids,  and  adverse  events  by 
corticosteroid  usage 
in  the 
long-term  studies 
in  nmDMD  patients.  Coadministration  of 
corticosteroids  with  ataluren  did  not  affect  the  plasma  concentrations  of  ataluren.    No  clinically 
relevant change in the plasma concentrations of corticosteroids was seen with co-administration of 
ataluren.    These  data  indicated  no  apparent  drug-drug  interaction  between  corticosteroids  and 
ataluren and no dose adjustments were required. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Ataluren  was  claimed  to  enable  ribosomal  readthrough  of  mRNA  containing  a  premature  stop 
codon, resulting in production of a full-length protein (dystrophin). A premature stop codon within 
an mRNA is a result of a nonsense mutation in DNA and causes disease by terminating translation 
before  a  full-length  protein  is  generated.  A  nonsense  mutation  is  an  underlying  genetic  defect  in 
approximately 13% of DMD patients.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Given  ataluren’s  mechanism  of  action,  pharmacodynamic  activity  cannot  be  assessed  in  healthy 
subjects  because  they  do  not  have  disease-causing  premature  stop  codons.  Therefore, 
quantification of dystrophin in muscle biopsies was included as a pharmacodynamic marker in two 
clinical trials of nmDMD patients.  
In Study 004, muscle dystrophin expression was evaluated as the primary endpoint. This proof-of-
concept open-label study had a treatment period of 4 weeks. The extensor digitorum brevis muscle 
was  sampled  pre-  and  post-treatment  to  improve  the  ability  to  quantify  dystrophin  expression. 
61%  of  patients  showed  an  increase  in  dystrophin  staining  in  28  days  of  ataluren  treatment.  A 
mean  change  from  baseline  to  Week  4  of  11.0%  in  dystrophin  expression  was  observed  in  the 
overall study population (p=0.008, paired t-test comparing pre-treatment to post-treatment). The 
mean per cent change in dystrophin expression was generally similar across the dose levels (4, 4, 
8 mg/kg [n=6]; 10, 10, 20 mg/kg [n=20]; 20, 20, 40 mg/kg [n=10]) and no clear dose-response 
relationship  was  observed,  which  was  attributed  by  the  Applicant  to  the  small  and  unequal 
numbers of patients in each group and the short duration of the study.  
Muscle  biopsies  were  also  collected in  the  pivotal  Study  007,  which  had  a  treatment  period  of  48 
weeks.  In  this  study,  biopsy  of  the  biceps  brachii  was  performed  from  one  arm  at  baseline  (pre-
treatment  sample)  and  from  the  other  arm  at  Week  36  ±14  days  (post-treatment  sample)  to 
assess  the  production  of  dystrophin.  Based  on  a  quantitative  analysis  of  patients  with  pre-  and 
post-treatment muscle biopsy samples, a mean change (from pre-treatment to post-treatment) of 
2.8% in dystrophin expression was observed in the ataluren 10, 10, 20 mg/kg dose group, 1.3% in 
the  ataluren  20,  20,  40  mg/kg  dose  group,  and  0.09%  in  the  placebo  group.  These  differences 
were not statistically significant. 
The analysis of muscle dystrophin expression in Study 007 was compromised by limitations in the 
available assay methods to sensitively measure changes in dystrophin expression at low levels and 
by  poor  sample  quality  in  the  majority  of  muscle  biopsy  samples  (primarily  due  to  artefacts 
introduced  in  the  handling  and  shipping  of  the  samples).  Only  19  (~11%)  paired  pre-  and  post-
treatment  biopsy  samples  met  the  criteria  of  an  optimal  sample,  defined  as  no  or  mild  freeze 
artefact, good cross orientation and no more than mild or moderate fibrotic replacement. Of these 
19  optimal  paired  samples,  there  were  similar  positive  and  negative  changes  in  dystrophin 
expression across all 3 treatment groups.  
Other  evidence  of  ataluren’  s  pharmacologic  action  was  provided  from  the  open-label  Phase  2 
studies of ataluren in paediatric, adolescent and adult patients with nmCF. This disease is caused 
by  nonsense  mutations  in  the  gene  for  the  cystic  fibrosis  transmembrane  conductance  regulator 
(CFTR). In these studies, the activity of ataluren to restore CFTR in nmCF patients was supported 
by  improvements  of  transepithelial  potential  difference,  which  directly  measures  CFTR  function  in 
the nasal mucosa. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetic profile (absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination) of ataluren was 
studied in healthy volunteers and nmDMD patients and was considered sufficiently characterised in 
the intended patient population. 
Three  formulations  of  ataluren  were  used  in  the  programme,  but  no  bioequivalence  studies  were 
performed. Because of the ataluren BCS classification, the differences between the formulations in 
terms  of  composition  (excipients)  were  considered  critical  and  bioequivalence  could  not  be

established.  The  CHMP  considered  that  the  varying  results  regarding  bioavailability  could  be 
attributed  to  the  disease  status,  as  claimed  by  the  MAH,  but  due  to  uncertainties  in  the  pop-PK 
modelling, this could not be confirmed. 
The CHMP considered that the study 001 evaluating the effect of food was performed with Phase I 
PIB  formulation  which  could  not  be  assumed  to  be  bioequivalent  with  Phase  2a/2b  formulation. 
However,  since  clinical  studies,  including  the  pivotal  Study  007  in  patients  with  nmDMD,  were 
standardized regarding the food intake, i.e. Translarna was taken with food, the CHMP agreed that 
the product can be recommended to be taken with food.  
The CHMP considered that the data on dose- and time linearity/non-linearity were inconclusive, but 
the  clinical  trial  data  suggesting  that  the  steady  state  is  maintained  from  week  6  through  more 
than two years of treatment were re-assuring. 
With respect to special populations, the CHMP was of the view that age-adjusted dosing would not 
be required and that the data available on patients of other than Caucasian population were limited 
to allow any conclusions regarding use in different ethnic groups. In the absence of specific studies 
in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, the CHMP considered the pharmacokinetic properties 
of  ataluren.  As  it  is  extensively  metabolized  in  liver  and  renal  excretion  accounts  for  50%  of  the 
drug  elimination,  hepatic  and  renal  impairment  can  be  expected  to  result  in  ataluren/ataluren 
glucuronide accumulation. The CHMP concluded that close monitoring would be required in clinical 
practice,  should  these  patients  be  treated.  Furthermore,  additional  studies  addressing  the 
pharmacokinetics  and  safety  in  these  patients  were  considered  necessary,  as  described  in  the 
proposed Risk Management Plan.   
The  CHMP  discussed  the  interaction  potential  of  ataluren  and  was  of  the  view  that  this  should  be 
further explored by the Applicant. Of note, as ataluren was  shown to inhibit UGT1A9 in vitro, the 
CHMP requested that in vivo studies with a sensitive probe substrate be conducted. Furthermore, 
because  of  the  observed  time  dependency,  interaction  study  with  UGT1A9  inducer  should  be 
performed.  Since  ataluren  may  be  expected  to  inhibit  OAT1,  OAT3  and  OATP1B3  in  vivo,  in  vivo 
studies  with  sensitive  probe  substrates  for  these  transporters  were  also  deemed  necessary.  The 
CHMP  also  considered  that  in  vitro  studies  showed  that  ataluren  was  a  substrate  of  BCRP  and 
consequently  requested  that  the  potential  interactions  between  ataluren  and  a  BCRP  selective 
inhibitor should be evaluated also in an in vivo study.  
In order to characterise the mechanism of action of ataluren, a series of studies were conducted in 
vitro  and  in  vivo,  as  detailed  in  the  non-clinical  section.  While  the  CHMP  acknowledged  that  the 
data  from  the  presented  studies  were  supportive  of  the  readthrough  ability  of  ataluren,  recent 
literature  provided  some  evidence  indicating  lack  of  translation  readthrough,  rendering  the 
Applicant´s  data  less  convincing.  Furthermore,  the  CHMP  questioned  whether  the  oral 
administration  of  ataluren  in  humans  could  lead  to  sufficient  levels  of  ataluren  in  muscles, 
considering  that  the  available  non-clinical  data  were  based  on  models  with  intramuscular 
administration  or  models  with  direct  contact  with  ataluren  solution,  as  was  the  case  in  zebrafish. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  most  appropriate  way  of  addressing  this  issue  would  be  providing 
evidence  of  a  pharmacodynamic  effect  in  muscles  and  therefore,  data  on  dystrophin  expression 
from  muscle  biopsies  were  discussed  by  the  CHMP  in  greater  detail.  Of  note,  the  fact  that  data 
from biopsies on dystrophin production would serve as supportive evidence was also highlighted by 
the SAG Neurology experts. 
In  the  proof-of-concept  study  004,  increase  in  dystrophin  levels  (mean increase  of  approximately 
11%)  was  observed  in  about  60%  of  the  subjects,  indicating  that  not  all  subjects  responded  to

treatment,  or  at  least  not  within  28  days.  Importantly,  there  was  no  dose  response  relationship 
and  results  of  this  study  did  not  support  the  bell-shaped  dose-response  hypothesis  of  the 
Applicant. 
The  pharmacodynamic  effect  suggested  by  the  study  004  was  not  confirmed  in  the  pivotal  study 
007.  Considerable  variability  in  the  dystrophin  assay  was  exemplified  by  the  finding  that  positive 
changes occurred in the placebo group, to the same extent as the ataluren treatment groups. The 
CHMP  considered  that  the  lack  of  observed  effect  could  be  due  to  the  poor  quality  of  the  muscle 
biopsies.  The  GCP  inspection  looked  into  the  reasons  for  failure  to  provide  results  from  samples 
obtained at the start and the end of the study and identified particularly wrong biopsy orientation 
and freezing artefacts. In addition, approximately half of the biopsies exhibited moderate to severe 
replacement of muscle with fat or fibrotic tissue.   
In the context of these data, the CHMP concluded that the pharmacodynamic effect of ataluren, i.e. 
production  of  dystrophin  in  muscle  cells  of  DMD  patients  treated  with  ataluren,  could  not  be 
considered confirmed. Secondly, even if dystrophin were produced in cells with advanced stage of 
fibrosis,  it  could  be  questioned  whether  newly  produced  dystrophin  may  restore  the  disrupted 
sarcoglycan  complex  which  plays  a  role  in  muscle  fibre  stability  and  protection  from  damage. 
Examples  from  other  clinical  studies  with  products  inducing  dystrophin  production  in  muscle  cells 
indicated  that  this  may  not  translate  into  convincing  clinical  efficacy.  Overall,  the  lack  of  a 
pharmacodynamic effect in study 007 was considered a weakness of the dossier and is also limiting 
the external validity of the efficacy results. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the pharmacological profile of ataluren in human studies was not adequately documented. 
In particular, the CHMP concluded that there was a lack of relevant data on the pharmacodynamic 
effects  of  ataluren  in  humans  reinforcing  the  uncertainties  raised  on  its  mechanism  of  action  and 
the dose-response relationship. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
No  dose  response  studies were  performed. Instead the  preclinical  data in  combination  with data 
from  the  phase  2a  study  004  with  three  doses  tested  (4/4/8  mg/kg,  10/10/20  mg/kg  and 
20/20/40  mg/kg)  and  a  PD  endpoint,  were  used  for  further  determination  of  the  dose  in  the 
phase 2b and the extension studies. 
The  treatment  plan  in  the  Phase  2b  study  built  on  the  Phase  2a  experience  in  DBMD  and  cystic 
fibrosis  (CF)  and  on  the  available  toxicokinetic  and  pharmacokinetic  data  from  previous  non-
clinical  and  clinical  studies.  Because  the  observed  ataluren  pharmacodynamic  activity  had  not 
exhibited  clear  dose-response  over  the  tested  dose range  and because the  correlations  between 
short-term  pharmacodynamic  effects  and  long-term  clinical  benefit  were  unknown,  further 
exploration of dose and duration of therapy in study 007 was necessary.  
The  disabling  and  life-threatening  nature  of  DBMD,  the  lack  of  approved  therapies  to  treat  the 
underlying  cause  of  this  disease  and  the  serious  consequences  of  chronic  corticosteroid 
administration in boys with DBMD mandated that the highest tolerable dose be explored in order

to maximize the potential for benefit. Nonclinical animal data and dose-response data from the in 
vitro myotube dystrophin expression experiments performed as part of the Phase 2a DMD study 
(Study  004)  suggested  that  maintaining  trough  ataluren  plasma  concentrations  of  >2  to  10 
mcg/ml may be important to achieve optimal efficacy [Welch 2007]. 
The 20, 20, 40 mg/kg dosage regimen in Study 004 was associated with maximum concentration 
(Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve through 24 hours (AUC0-24) values that were 
lower than and/or comparable to the mean Cmax and AUC0-24 values in nonclinical toxicity studies, 
either  at  the  600  mg  dose  associated  with  recoverable  renal  lesions  in  mice  or  at  the  NOAEL  in 
rats  and  dogs  in  the  4-week  toxicology  studies.  The  mean  Cmax  and  AUC0-24  values  were  also 
lower  than  the  mean  values  observed  with  the  NOAEL  in  the  26-week  rat  studies  and  similar  to 
the mean values observed at the NOAEL for adrenal cortical function in the 52-week dog study.  
The  exposure  values  were  also  comparable  to  those  that  were  generally  well  tolerated  in  adults 
with  CF  participating  in  the  Phase  2a  study  program  –  including  patients  who  received  ataluren 
treatment for 12 weeks. These exposures were generally well tolerated in boys participating in the 
Phase  2a  DMD  study  (Study  004)  for  28  days.  Collectively,  these  considerations  supported 
inclusion of the 20-, 20-, 40-mg/kg dose level in the Phase 2b study.  
The  10,  10,  20  mg/kg  dose  tested  in  Study  004  showed  clinical  pharmacodynamic  activity  and, 
unlike the 4-, 4-, 8-mg/kg dose level, achieved trough exposure levels within the target range of 
2  to  10  μg/mL  associated  with  activity  in  nonclinical  models.  The  Cmax  and  AUC0-24  values 
associated  with  this  dose  level  suggested  favourable  exposure  ratios  relative  to  animal 
toxicokinetic  data.  Clinically,  these  exposures  were  safe  across  the  Phase  2a  DMD  and  CF 
experience. For these reasons, the 10, 10, 20 mg/kg dose level was also evaluated in the Phase 
2b study. 
2.5.2.  Main study 
A phase 2b efficacy and safety study of PTC124 in subjects with non-sense-mutation-mediated 
Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy 
Methods 
Study Participants 
To  be  eligible  to  participate  in  the  study,  patients  had  to  be  males  ≥5  years  of  age  who  had  a 
diagnosis  of  (nonsense  mutation  Duchenne/Becker  muscular  dystrophy  -  nmDBMD)  based  on 
phenotypic  evidence  of  DBMD  and  a  nonsense  mutation  in  the  dystrophin  gene  as  confirmed  by 
gene  sequencing.  Patients  were  required  to  have  the  ability  to  walk  ≥75  meters  unassisted. 
Adequate  baseline  renal,  adrenal  and  hepatic  function,  as  established  by  serum  markers  was 
required.  Key  exclusion  criteria  included  prior  or  ongoing  clinically  significant  illness  or  severe 
complications  of  DBMD,  serologic  evidence  of  hepatitis  B  or  C  and  change 
in 
prophylaxis/treatment  for  congestive  heart  failure  within  3  months  prior  to  start  of  study 
treatment.  Patients  receiving  corticosteroid  therapy  were  required  to  have  stabilization  of  such 
therapy prior to study entry. 
Treatments 
Patients received placebo, ataluren 10, 10, 20 mg/kg (total daily dose 40 mg/kg) or ataluren 20, 
20,  40  mg/kg  (total  daily  dose  80  mg/kg)  every  day  during  the  treatment  period  using  a  TID

schedule comprising morning, midday and evening doses. Approximate intervals for dosing were 
to  be  6 hours  between  morning  and midday doses, 6 hours between midday and evening doses 
and 12 hours between the evening dose and the morning dose on the next day. 
Administration within 30 minutes after a meal was  recommended. Study drug dosing was based 
on  milligrams  of  drug  per  kilogram  of  body  weight.  The  planned  duration  of  treatment  was  48 
weeks. 
The use of corticosteroids was to be standardized as much as possible during the study in order to 
minimize potential confounding effects. In patients not on corticosteroids at the beginning of the 
study,  initiation  of  corticosteroid  therapy  during  the  study  was  discouraged  unless  there  was  a 
strong  medical  need.  For  patients  on  corticosteroids  at  the  beginning  of  the  study,  a  stable 
corticosteroid  regimen  was  to  be  maintained  during  the  study.  Adjustments  in  corticosteroid 
dosage for increases in body weight were permitted but were not mandatory. 
Objectives 
The  primary  objective  was  to  determine  the  effect  of  ataluren  on  ambulation.    The  secondary 
objectives  were  to  evaluate  the  effects  of  ataluren  on  physical  function,  patient-reported 
outcomes,  cognitive  function,  cardiac  function  and  pharmacodynamics.  Safety,  compliance  with 
study drug treatment and ataluren plasma exposure were also assessed. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  change  in  6MWD  from  baseline  to  Week  48.  The  secondary 
endpoints  comprised  changes  in  proximal  muscle  function  as  assessed  by  timed  function  tests; 
change  in  force  exerted  during  knee  flexion  and  extension,  elbow  flexion  and  extension  and 
shoulder  abduction  as  assessed  by  myometry;  change  in  activity  in  the  community  setting  as 
assessed  by  step  activity  monitoring;  change  in  the  patient-reported  wheelchair  use;  change  in 
patient  and  parent/caregiver  reported  HRQL  as  measured  by  the  Pediatric  Quality  of  Life 
Inventory  (PedsQL);  change  in  parent/caregiver-reported  treatment  satisfaction  as  measured  by 
the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM); change in the rate of accidental 
falls per day as recorded by patients and/or parent/caregivers in a daily diary; change in verbal 
memory  and  attention  as  assessed  by  the  digit  span  task;  change  in  heart  rate  before,  during, 
and after each 6MWT as assessed by heart rate monitoring; change in serum concentration of CK; 
and change in biceps muscle dystrophin expression as determined by immunofluorescence. 
The safety endpoints were the type, frequency, severity, timing and relationship to study drug of 
adverse  events, 
laboratory  abnormalities,  vital  sign  changes,  electrocardiogram  (ECG) 
abnormalities, renal ultrasound and physical exams. 
The planned doses were compared to the actual doses (as reported by the patients) to determine 
compliance. 
Pre-dose  (C0h)  and  2-hour  post-dose  (C2h)  ataluren  plasma  concentrations  after  morning  drug 
administration were assessed by a validated bio-analytical method. 
Sample size 
The  hypothesis  of  this  study  was  that  the  mean  change  in  6MWD  from  baseline  to  48  weeks 
would be 30 meters longer in at least one of the ataluren arms than in the placebo arm. Assuming 
a  common  standard  deviation  of  ~50  meters  in  each  arm  and  a  1:1:1  randomization,  150 
patients were required (50 patients in each of the 3 arms) to detect a difference of 30 meters in

the  6MWD  with  >85%  power  using  a  2-sided  Dunnett’  s  t-test  at  the  0.042  significance  level. 
Assuming  a  premature  discontinuation  rate  of  ~10%,  it  was  planned  that  ~165  patients  (~55 
patients in each of the 3 arms) be enrolled. 
Randomisation 
Eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio and stratified based on age (<9 vs ≥9 years), 
use of corticosteroids at baseline (yes vs no) and 6MWD (≥350 meters vs <350 meters).  
At  the  time  of  randomization,  the  IVR/IWR  system  provided  the  clinic  pharmacist  or  other 
qualified  person  with  the  patient  randomization  number  and  the  Component  ID  numbers 
designating the kits to be dispensed. 
Blinding (masking) 
Patients,  parents/caregivers,  investigational  site  personnel,  PTC  Therapeutics  employees  and  all 
other study personnel were to remain blinded to the identity of the treatment assignments until 
every patient had completed study treatment and the database had been locked. The identity of 
the study treatments were concealed by the use of a placebo that was identical to the active drug 
in appearance, taste, odour, packaging, labelling and schedule of administration. Unblinding was 
only  to  occur  in  the  case  of  patient  emergencies,  if  requested  by  the  DMC  at  the  time  of  the 
interim analyses, and at the conclusion of the study. During the study, the treatment assignments 
were to be available only to an independent biostatistician and to the DMC. 
Statistical methods 
A  mixed-model  repeated-measures  (MMRM)  analysis  of  the  change  in  6MWD  from  baseline  to 
Week  48  was  performed  in  the  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  population  (all  randomized  patients  with  a 
valid  6MWT  at  baseline  and  ≥1  post-baseline  visit).  Included  in  the  model  were  treatment, 
baseline 6MWD, age (<9 or ≥9 years), corticosteroid use (yes or no), visit, and treatment-by-visit 
interaction.  Because  baseline  6MWD  was  included  in  the  model  as  a  covariate,  the  stratification 
factor  of  baseline  6MWD  was  excluded  from  this  model.  Least-squares  means  and  variance 
estimates of changes in 6MWD at Week 48 were generated from the model. These estimates were 
then used to compare the changes in 6MWD at 48 weeks between each ataluren treatment arm 
and  the  placebo  arm.  Normality  was  tested  using  the  Shapiro-Wilks  W-test  at  the  0.05 
significance level. Because a significant degree of non-normality was observed, rank-transformed 
data were used in the pre-specified analysis. 
Sensitivity  analyses  were  performed  to  assess  the  potential  for  induction  of  bias  due  to  lack  of 
patient  conformance  to  the  protocol,  inclusion  of  sibling  pairs,  and  missing  data  (analysis  after 
multiple  imputation  and  last  observation  carried  forward  [LOCF])  and  dynamic  randomization  in 
an  MMRM  setting  (permutation  test).  A  sensitivity  analysis  to  assess  robustness  of  the  primary 
efficacy  results  to  missing  data  was  based  on  the  LOCF  concept,  by  applying  an  analysis  of 
covariance  (ANCOVA)  model  to  the  last  available  post-baseline  6MWD  observation,  with 
covariates as defined in the SAP. 
As specified in the SAP, time to persistent 10% 6MWT worsening (last time that 6MWD was not 
10% worse than baseline) and time to persistent 10% 6MWT improvement (last time that 6MWD 
was  not  10%  improved  over  baseline)  were  evaluated  as  supportive  analyses  of  the  primary 
endpoint. Differences between each ataluren treatment arm and the placebo arm were assessed 
using Kaplan-Meier methods and the stratified log-rank test.

In  general,  secondary  variables  were  analysed  using  the  final  MMRM  that  was  used  for  the 
primary  analysis  of  the  6MWD  data,  except  that  the  baseline  value  of  the  secondary  variable  of 
interest served as the covariate and baseline 6MWD was added to the model as an independent 
variable.  In  cases  where  an  MMRM  analysis  was  not  appropriate  for  the  secondary  variable  of 
interest, alternative statistical methods were used as necessary. 
Post-hoc: 
Post-hoc refined MMRM, including baseline-by-visit interaction term, analysis of 6MWD as well as 
stair-climbing, stair-descending, running/walking 10 meters, and rising from supine to stand were 
performed in the corrected ITT population. It was recognized after unblinding that 2 patients had 
baseline  6MWTs  that  were  incorrectly  classified  as  valid.  In  fact,  these  2  patients  suffered  from 
recent lower leg injuries that reduced their baseline 6MWD when compared to their prior 6MWD at 
Screening or subsequent 6MWD at Week 6. These 2 patients should not have been included in the 
ITT  population  without  a  valid  baseline  test.  To  address  this  issue  their  baseline  values  were 
replaced with screening values, creating a corrected ITT population.

Recruitment 
The study took place between 28 February 2008 (first patient first visit) and 17 December 2009 
(last patient last visit). 
Conduct of the study 
The most common protocol deviations involved variations from protocol-specified collection times 
for  safety  and  efficacy  assessments,  particularly  laboratory  evaluations  (urinalysis,  haematology 
and blood chemistries). Patients who did not have an evaluation that was needed for a particular 
statistical  analysis  (e.g.  missing  baseline  data  in  evaluations  of  change  from  baseline)  were 
excluded  from  that  analysis.  With  regard  to  eligibility,  seven  of  the  174  patients  had  laboratory 
abnormalities at screening that should have excluded their participation in the study. However, a 
decision  had  already  been  mad  to  amend  the  protocol  to  allow  for  inclusion  of  patients  with 
clinically  insignificant  laboratory  abnormalities  and  thus,  waivers  were  granted  allowing  these 
patients  into  the  study  and  the  planned  protocol  amendment  was  subsequently  implemented. 
None of the patients received excluded concomitant medication and no patients were withdrawn 
from  the  study  due  to  developing  any  of  the  withdrawal  criteria  (as  assessed  by  the  adverse 
event data).

20 mg/kg and 60 patients who received ataluren 20, 20, 40 mg/kg were included in analyses of 
efficacy. The only patients excluded from all analyses of efficacy were those who failed screening 
(see fig. 7 above). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary outcome 
The model-estimated difference (pre-specified analysis) in the mean change in 6MWD from 
baseline to Week 48 between the ataluren 10, 10, 20 mg/kg and placebo arm was 26.4 
meters (95% CI -4.2,57.1). 
Further  results  of  the  pre-specified  efficacy  analysis  in  the  ITT  population,  i.e.  analysis  of  the 
change in 6MWD at Week 48 is presented in table 8 below. 
Table 8 Pre-specified MMRM analyses of change in 6MWD (ITT) 
 The observed difference between the ataluren 10, 10, 20 mg/kg and placebo arms in mean 
change in observed 6MWD from baseline to Week 48 was 29.7 meters (Figure 8).

Figure 8, Mean change in observed 6MWD by Visit (ITT) 
 A  post  hoc  statistical  analysis  was  performed  on  the  cITT  population  (see  section  “Statistical 
methods”)  and  presented  by  the  Applicant  to  support  the  efficacy  of  ataluren.  The  observed 
difference in the mean change in the 6MWD from baseline to Week 48 between placebo and the 
lower  dose  of  ataluren  (10,  10,  20  mg/kg)  was  31.3  metres,  while  the    model-estimated 
difference  was  31.7    (nominal  p=0.0281,  adjusted  p=0.0561)  Essentially  no  difference  was 
observed  between  the  higher  dose  (20,  20,  40  mg/kg)  and  placebo.  The  results  are  shown  in 
figure 9 and table 8 below).

Table. 8. Post Hoc MMRM Analysis of Change in Untransformed 6MWD based on Permutation test 
(Corrected ITT). 
As  pre-specified,  the  proportions  of  patients  with  at  least  10%  worsening  in  6MWD  at  Week  48 
were  assessed.  At  Week  48,  44%  and  48%  of  patients  in  the  placebo  and  20,  20,  40  mg/kg 
ataluren arms, respectively, were progressors, with no statistically significant difference between 
these  arms.  In  the  10,  10,  20  mg/kg  ataluren  arm,  26%  of  patients  were  progressors  (nominal 
p=0.0326, adjusted p=0.0652).  
The hazard ratio for ataluren 10, 10, 20 mg/kg vs placebo was 0.51 representing a 49% reduction 
in the risk of 10% 6MWD worsening.

Secondary outcomes 
Timed function tests 
The  results  on  timed  function  tests  of  muscle  function  (table  9)  indicated  positive  trends  for 
climbing and descending four stairs and running/walking 10 metres, as evidenced by less decline 
over 48 weeks; these differences were more prominent in the lower dose. No difference between 
ataluren and placebo was observed for the stand to supine test.

Table 9 Timed function tests and functional method scores (cITT)  
Upper and lower extremity myometry tests 
Over  48  weeks,  ataluren-treated  patients  generally  showed  less  decline  in  muscle  strength,  as 
evidenced  by  smaller  decreases  in  most  myometry  parameters  relative  to  placebo  (table  10). 
These trends were more prominent at the 10, 10, 20 mg/kg dose. 
Table 10 Myometry (ITT) 
Step activity monitoring 
Step  activity  monitoring  was  performed  in  the  community  setting.  Patients  wore  a  device 
monitoring and recording the numbers of steps taken. Differences in changes in mean steps taken 
from baseline to Week 48 favoured ataluren and placebo at both dose levels. The proportions of

time  during  which  the  patient  is  moving  at  0  (no  activity),  1-15  (low  activity),  16-30  (medium 
activity) and above 30 (high activity) steps/minute were also assessed (table 11). 
Table 11 Proportions of time spent at no, low, medium and high activity (ITT) 
Wheelchair use 
Patient-reported wheelchair use showed a positive trend favouring ataluren 10, 10, 20 mg/kg vs 
placebo. Mean percentage of day of wheelchair use (95%CI) increased from baseline to Week 48 
by 11.5% (4.36, 18.54) for placebo, 4.0% (-2.77, 10.68) for ataluren 10, 10, 20 mg/kg and 9% 
(0.7,  17.38)  for  ataluren  20,  20,  40  mg/kg.  The  treatment  differences  were  not  statistically 
significant. 
Frequency of accidental falls 
Over  48  weeks,  reductions  in  the  frequency  of  accidental  falls  were  seen  at  both  dose  levels 
compared to placebo.  The  absolute numbers showed a decrease from baseline to Week 48 of   -
0.04 falls per day in the 10, 10, 20 mg/kg ataluren arm vs increase of 0.18 falls per day in the 
placebo arm (table 12).

Quality of life measures 
Positive trends in PedsQL favoured ataluren vs placebo in the physical function domain in a pre-
specified  analysis.  The  difference  in  the  mean  change  in  physical  functioning  score,  favouring 
ataluren 10, 10, 20 mg/kg over placebo, was 3.4 at Week 48. As with the other endpoints, this 
was more pronounced in a post-hoc analysis of the decline phase subgroup; within this subgroup 
a  difference  of  6.1  in  the mean  change  in  physical  functioning  score,  favouring  ataluren  10,  10,

20 mg/kg over placebo, was observed at Week 48. 
Other secondary endpoints 
Changes  in  the  other  secondary  outcome  measures  not  directly  related  to  physical  functioning 
(patient-reported  psychosocial  functioning,  treatment  satisfaction,  digit  span  task,  heart  rate 
monitoring and serum CK) were generally small and no clear differentiation between ataluren and 
placebo was observed. 
Muscle dystrophin expression 
The  muscle  dystrophin  expression  data  were  compromised  by  poor  sample  quality  and 
inadequacies in currently available methods for quantification of dystrophin expression. 
Ataluren plasma concentration 
Ataluren  plasma  concentration  before  and  2  hours  following  the  morning  dose  were  dose-
proportional and well-maintained over time. All patients who received 10, 10, 20 mg/kg ataluren 
had  a  mean  C2h  across  all  visits  less  or  equal  to  19.3  mcg/ml.  Consistent  with  the  analysis  by 
treatment  arm,  patients  who  received  20,  20,  40  mg/kg  ataluren  but  had  mean  C2h  below  or 
equal  to  19.3  mcg/ml  showed  a  better  response  to  ataluren  as  measured  by  6MWD,  timed 
function tests and frequency of accidental falls than those who received the higher dose and had 
C2h above 19.3 mcg/ml. 
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses were performed in patients who were in the decline of the disease. Criteria for 
this  subgroup  were  identified  based  on the  results  from  the  placebo  arm  which  helped  to define 
the natural history of 6MWT in DMD (fig. 11).  
Fig. 11 The natural history of DMD as defined by 6MWT data from the placebo group in study 007 
This figure shows that patients younger than 7 years tend to increase their 6MWD over 48 weeks 
(maturational  improvements).  Patients  who  have  higher  baseline  6MWD  (above  350  m)  tend  to 
be stable over the 48-week period, whereas those patients with lower baseline 6MWD (below 350 
m) show decline in their walking ability over 48 weeks.  
Based  on  the  natural  history  data,  the  applicant  considered  that  the  ability  to  measure  a

treatment effect over a shorter period (48 weeks) would be greater in the decline-phase patients 
(7-16 years, baseline 6MWD ≥150 metres and <80% of predicted 6MWD). This was reflected in 
the design of the planned confirmatory phase 3 trial (inclusion criteria) as well as in the “decline 
phase” subgroup analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints of study 007 (fig. 12 and fig. 
13).

across the disease spectrum, including milder patients (i.e. baseline values above 70% predicted 
6MWD).

Analysis description  Primary Analysis  A mixed-model repeated-measures (MMRM) analysis of 
the change in 6MWD from baseline to Week 48 was performed in the intent-
to-treat (ITT) population (all randomized patients with a valid 6MWT at 
baseline and ≥1 post-baseline visit). Included in the model were treatment, 
baseline 6MWD, age (<9 or ≥9 years), corticosteroid use (yes or no), visit, 
and treatment-by-visit interaction. Because baseline 6MWD was included in 
the model as a covariate, the stratification factor of baseline 6MWD (≥350 
or <350 meters) was excluded from this model.

Clinical studies in special populations 
The target patient population for the treatment with ataluren is predominantly paediatric and the 
majority  of  subjects  in  the  studies  were  children,  with  the  exception  of  the  phase  1  studies  in 
healthy volunteers. Ataluren was not evaluated in elderly patients, which is in line with the short 
life expectancy of the patient population.  
No  studies  in  patients  with  renal  or  hepatic  impairment  were  performed  (see  the  Clinical 
pharmacology discussion, section 2.4.4). 
Supportive studies 
With  the  exception  of  the  pivotal  007,  all  studies  presented  in  the  dossier  were  conducted  as 
uncontrolled: 
PTC124  GD  004  DMD  (as  Study  004)  -  an  open-label  Phase  2a  trial  assessing  3  dose  levels  of 
Translarna  (4,  4,  8  mg/kg;  10,  10,  20  mg/kg;  and  20,  20,  40  mg/kg)  evaluating  muscle 
dystrophin expression as the primary endpoint.

The  results  of  study  004  are  summarised  and  discussed  in  the  Clinical  Pharmacology  section 
(2.4).

Translarna 20, 20, 40 mg/kg 
After unbinding of study 007 and the observation of no separation of the high dose from placebo, 
studies 004e, 007e and 008 were some prematurely stopped since patients were treated with the 
20/20/40 mg/kg dose. 
Two open-label studies were ongoing at the time of this marketing authorisation application: 
PTC124-GD-016-DMD (Study 016) - an open-label Phase 3 safety trial of ataluren in ambulatory 
and non-ambulatory patients who originally participated in Studies 007, 007e, 004, 004e or 008. 
Patients were treated with ataluren 10, 10, and 20 mg/kg for an open duration. 
PTC124-GD-019-DMD (Study 019) - an open-label Phase 3 safety trial of ataluren in ambulatory 
and  non-ambulatory  patients  who  originally  participated  in  Studies  007  and  007e  Patients  were 
treated with 10, 10, and 20 mg/kg for 48 weeks.  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  clinical  programme  of  ataluren  for  nmDMD  consisted  of  phase  1  single  and  multiple  dose 
studies, a phase 2a proof-of-concept study (004), one phase 2b efficacy and  safety study (007) 
and  open  label  extension  studies  004e  and  007e.  The  phase  2b  study  was  the  only  placebo-
controlled study and was presented by the Applicant as pivotal. The CHMP considered that claims 
of efficacy based on a single study could be acceptable in the context of a rare disease provided 
that results of the study were sufficiently robust and compelling. 
The main clinical study 007 was performed as multicentre, randomised, double-blind and placebo-
controlled. The CHMP considered that the choice of placebo for the reference arm of the trial was 
justified,  as  ataluren  represents  a  first-in-class  approach  to  DMD  and  no  approved  standard 
therapy exists. This approach was also in line with a protocol assistance provided by the CHMP on 
the product.  
With  respect  to  the  choice  of  the  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria,  the  CHMP  noted  that  as  the 
distribution  of  age  at  study  recruitment  was  wide  (i.e.  the  age  of  diagnosis  ranged  from  0 –  10 
years and the age range of recruited subject ranged from 5 to 20 years) and patients with DMD 
as well as BMD could be enrolled, the population was rather heterogeneous. Furthermore, as the 
study  included  only  ambulant  boys,  since  the  primary  endpoint  was  the  6MWT,  the  CHMP 
considered  that  extrapolation  of  efficacy  results  to  the  entire  DMD  patient  population  might  be 
difficult. 
The applicant provided a justification as to why the 6MWT is considered the most appropriate and 
relevant measurement tool for DMD and for the objectives of the study. The CHMP acknowledged

that the 6MWT is one of the most commonly applied tools for this condition and that ambulation is 
a  very  important  aspect  for  individuals  affected  by  the  disease.  However,  as  discussed  in 
literature,  the  6MWT  has  in  itself  several  deficiencies,  such  as  high  inter-  and  intra-individual 
variability.  Furthermore,  the  results  can  be  influenced  by  several  factors,  e.g.  behaviour, 
motivation, fatigue and a learning effect. Therefore, the CHMP highlighted during their follow-up 
protocol  assistance  that  clinically  meaningful  effects  should  be  seen  in  the  domains  of  disability 
and muscle strength. Since the study was already performed with the 6MWT as the only primary 
endpoint,  the  CHMP  pointed  out  in  this  protocol  assistance  that  the  outcomes  of  the  timed 
functional  tests,  myometry  and  the  other  secondary  endpoints  should  be  supportive  of  efficacy, 
i.e. pointing in the same direction.  
The  48  week  duration  of  the  clinical  trial  was  in  general  considered  adequate  to  investigate  the 
efficacy  of  the  test  product.  Still,  based  on  the  data  available  (and  discussed  below),  the  CHMP 
noted  that the  ability  to  measure  a  treatment  effect  in  1  year  was  lower  in  patients  with  stable 
ambulatory ability, as compared to the population of patients in the decline phase of ambulation, 
which might have impacted the efficacy observed in the overall population of the study. 
With  respect  to  GCP  compliance  and  data  verification,  a  routine  inspection  and  an  additional 
inspection  requested  by  CHMP  were  performed.  The  inspections  were  conducted  at  the  sponsor 
site, two clinical investigator sites and at the central pathology laboratory where the biopsies were 
analysed.  The  main  findings  pertained  to  archiving,  AE  reporting,  lack  of  oversight  (at  the 
investigator  sites);  lack  of  oversight  and  QC/QA  issues  (at  the  sponsor  site)  and  limited  GCP-
awareness  regarding  documentation  and  archiving  (at  the  laboratory).  With  respect  to  the 
acceptability  of  the  clinical  trial  data,  the  inspection team  considered  that  the  data  presented  in 
the clinical study reports were reliable and suitable for assessment in the MAA.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The primary analysis of the data resulted in a difference of -0.1 m (95% CI -30.4, 30.2; nominal p-
value=  0.9956,  adjusted  p-value=1.0000)  between  placebo  and  the  high  dose  arm  and  a 
difference  of  26.4  m  (95%  CI  -4.2,  57.1;  nominal  p  value=0.0905,  adjusted  p-value  =  0.1592) 
between placebo and the low dose arm. As the results were not statistically significant, the study 
007 was formally considered negative. Two subjects had invalid baseline measurements; analyses 
with  these  invalid  baseline  data,  without  these  subjects  or  with  corrected  baseline  values  were 
performed to  assess the impact  of  different  approaches. P-values  varying between  0.05  and 0.09 
were  observed,  with  sometimes  substantially  overlapping  confidence  intervals  in  the  different 
analyses, but comparable results in terms of point estimates (25-35m) were seen. Taken together 
with  the  fact  that  the  variation  in  6MWD  turned  out  to  increase  over  visits  and  exceeded  the 
variation  accounted  for  in  the  sample  size  calculation,  the  lack  of  statistical  significance  was 
assumed to be a consequence of under-powerment of the trial. Overall, the effect was considered 
consistent, but the confidence intervals were too wide to be perceived as conclusive. 
Further analyses and discussions were made on the corrected ITT population (cITT), which from a 
methodological point of view might be considered acceptable, although the CHMP flagged the fact 
that  the  results  were  post-hoc  derived.  In  the  post-hoc  analysis  of  the  primary  endpoint,  the 
10/10/20 mg/kg group had an observed mean of 31.3 meters less deterioration on the 6MWT, as 
compared  to  the  placebo  group,  while  the  20/20/40  mg/kg  group  was  not  distinguishable  from 
placebo. The model-estimated mean showed a value of 31.7 m (95 % CI 5.1,58.3) with a nominal 
p  value=  0.0281  and  an  adjusted  p  value  =  0.0561.  The  CHMP  also  considered  the  results  of  a 
progressor analysis which was discussed during the protocol assistance and which showed that the

proportion  of  subjects  with  10%  deterioration  on  the  6MWT  (indicating  disease  progression)  at 
week  48  was  26%  in  the  low  dose  group  versus  44%  in  the  placebo  and  48%  in  the  high  dose 
group.  
To  further  support the  robustness  of  the  efficacy  data  the  applicant  was  requested to  discuss  the 
outcomes on the secondary endpoints, particularly on the timed function tests and patient reported 
quality of life outcomes. The results indicated trends towards better outcome on some endpoints, 
e.g.  4  stair  ascend,  4  stair  descend,  10-m  run/walk,  smaller  increase  in  time  at  the  end  of  the 
study  was  seen  in  the  ataluren  arms  as  compared  to  placebo.  These  differences  were  more 
pronounced in the low dose group but being expressed in (mili)seconds were difficult to interpret.  
The frequency of patient/parent-reported accidental falling was also considered a relevant endpoint 
by  the  CHMP,  since  it  is  related  to  limb  fractures  which  further  reduce  the  activity  and  may 
accelerate the transition to permanent loss of ambulation. Moreover, the fact that this endpoint did 
not highly correlate with the 6MWT indicated that the rate of falls is measuring a different activity 
than  the  6MWT.  Since  accidental  fall  rate  was  included  in  the  study  protocol  as  a  secondary 
endpoint,  it  was  surprising  that  a  rather  high  number  of  subjects  had  no  baseline  values.  On 
request  of  the  CHMP  the  absolute  figures  were  presented  indicating  that  the  low  dose  arm  had 
milder (on this parameter) subjects (0.27 falls/day) as compared to placebo (0.54) and high dose 
arm (0.40). The absolute rates of accidental falls indicated that the population in the low dose arm 
was  milder  in  this  respect.  Therefore,  the  data  on    “change  in  accidental  falls”  (decrease  from 
baseline to Week 48 of -0.04 falls per day in the 10, 10, 20 mg/kg ataluren arm, vs an increase of 
0.18 falls per day in the placebo arm) were not considered as  indicating a true effect of ataluren 
on this parameter. 
With  respect  to  the  mean  percentage  of  wheelchair  use,  the  CHMP  considered  the  baseline  data 
and  the  respective  increases  observed  in  each  treatment  groups  at  week  48  and  requested 
additional information on the way the wheel chair use was registered. As the questionnaire did not 
take into account total duration of use of a wheelchair, but only a day in which it was used, it was 
considered that the variability in performance and the actual need for use of a wheelchair could not 
be completely captured. 
The data from the step activity monitoring indicated less increase in time spent in no activity in the 
10/10/20  group,  but  the  results  were  considered  inconclusive.    The  clinical  relevance  of  spending 
2% less of the time in no activity was not substantiated.   
The  CHMP  paid  specific  attention  to  evaluation  of  muscle  strength,  which  is  considered  as  an 
important  outcome  for  this  disorder.  Over  48  weeks,  ataluren-treated  patients  generally  showed 
less decline in muscle strength, as evidenced by smaller decreases in most myometry parameters 
relative to placebo. However, observed differences were considered to be below the level of clinical 
meaningfulness.  The  CHMP  considered  the  applicant´s  argumentation  that  in  the  course  of  the 
disease  there  is  severe  disorganisation  within  the  muscle  (at  the  level  of  muscle  fibres  and  fibre 
bundles) as well as fibrosis and aberrant innervation. Thus, in case of new production of functional 
dystrophin  the  regeneration  processes  and  restoration  of  muscle  strength  may  indeed  be  time 
consuming and may not be seen in a study of a shorter duration. Furthermore, as indicated by the 
SAG  Neurology  experts,  while  minimal  increase  in  dystrophin  production  could  lead  to  functional 
improvement, much higher levels of dystrophin in muscular fibres would have to be achieved for an 
effect  on  strength  to  be  seen.  In  this  context,  i.e.  little  supportive  evidence  of  effect  on  muscle 
strength,  the  CHMP  considered  that  robust  and  convincing  results  on  the  functional  outcomes 
(6MWD and functional timed tests) are of even greater importance and in the absence thereof, the 
entire body of evidence of efficacy is considered weak.

Overall,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  results  on  the  secondary  endpoints  did  not  support  the 
primary endpoint. The view that there was little supportive evidence of effect from the data on the 
secondary endpoints was also shared by the SAG Neurology experts. 
In  an  additional  post-hoc  analysis  of  a  subgroup  of  patients  in  the  decline  phase  (older  than  7 
years,  treated  with  corticosteroids,  baseline  6MWD  ≥150  metres  and  <80%  predicted  6MWD)  a 
difference in mean 6MWD of -50 metres was seen, favouring ataluren 10, 10, 20 mg/kg. This result 
was  considered  to  be  a  clinically  meaningful  improvement  in  terms  of  stabilisation  of  walking.  A 
similar  effect  was  also  consistently  observed  in  the  key  secondary  endpoints,  i.e.  time  function 
tests, which provided reassurance to the global results. The applicant discussed this finding making 
reference to the natural history data on 6MWD in DMD patients and concluded that over a shorter 
period of time, subjects in the decline phase of their walking ability may show a greater effect than 
patients  with  stabilised  ambulation.  At  the  same  time,  the  applicant  argued  that  in  light  of  its 
mechanism of action, i.e. production of dystrophin, ataluren should provide protection from further 
damage and hence be more efficacious in less damaged muscle cells. While this would imply that 
treatment  should  start  earlier  than  in  the  decline  phase,  which  was  also  supported  by  the  SAG 
Neurology  experts,  the  CHMP  maintained  that  the  potential  effect  in  earlier  stages  of  the  disease 
was  not  evidenced.    Overall,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  patients  in  the  decline  phase  of  their 
ambulation constituted only a subset of the study 007 population and the analysis should be seen 
as  exploratory.  Therefore,  the  results  to  be  generated  in  the  ongoing  confirmatory  trial  enriched 
with a population of patients in the decline phase were seen as critical to addressing this issue.  
The  CHMP  considered  that  even  if  the  lack  of  statistical  significance  was  disregarded,  there  is  an 
outstanding issue pertaining to the absence of effect seen in the higher dose. The applicant argued 
that the finding is explained by the bell-shaped curve dose response, supporting their position by a 
combination  of  non-clinical  and  clinical  data.  In  order  to  further  address  this  issue,  the  applicant 
submitted  a  correlation  between  the  plasma  concentration  achieved  and  the  effect  in  terms  of 
6MWT and TFTs supporting the robustness of the effect of the selected dose (fig. 15 above). While 
patients  with  lower  concentrations  appeared  to  show  better  results  on  6MWD  as  well  as  across 
TFTs, the CHMP considered that a scatter plot with change in 6MWT and plasma concentration on 
an individual patient level would have been of greater value. This data were additionally presented 
by the applicant (fig. 16 above). However, the CHMP was of the view that no specific pattern could 
be  identified  to  provide  additional  evidence  in  support  of  the  bell  shape  concentration  response 
curve. 
The data in support of the bell-shape curve hypothesis were considered to be inconsistent and not 
allowing a reliable assessment. The CHMP also took into consideration the SAG Neurology comment 
that additional non-clinical in vivo data would have been useful. The evidence was mainly limited to 
in vitro data from myotubes derived from DMD patients and similar findings were not demonstrated 
to  occur  in  vivo.  The  mechanistic  explanation  provided  by  the  Applicant  was  not  considered  as 
sufficient level of evidence. Overall, the CHMP concluded that the effect observed in the lower dose 
only could be a chance finding.  
Additional expert consultation 
In the course of the procedure, the CHMP identified need for input from the SAG Neurology on the 
three following questions: 
• 
Question 1 
Does  the  SAG  consider  that  the  evidence  for  the  mechanism  of  action  of  ataluren 
(nonsense  mutation  read-through)  is  convincing,  and  the  results  on  dystrophin 
Translarna

production could be seen as supportive of the pharmacodynamics of ataluren? 
The  SAG  considered  that  mechanism  of  action  seemed  plausible,  but  the  experts  felt  that  the 
provided  data  were  still  not  convincing  enough,  and  that  they  would  need  more  information  in 
order  to  be  certain.  The  same  was  true  for  the  data  provided  on  dystrophin  production  in  this 
case,  that  at  least  the  data  from  the  available  biopsies,  limited  as  they  may  be,  should  be 
provided.  Thus,  the  SAG  considered  that  presently  the  available  data  on  dystrophin  production 
cannot be used as supportive of the pharmacodynamics of ataluren.  
• 
Question 2 
Does  the  SAG  agree  that  the  presented  pre-clinical  and  clinical  evidence  supports  the 
bell-shaped dose-response curve and hence, the absence of efficacy at the higher dose 
studied?  
The  SAG  considered  that  the  proposed  hypothesis  for  the  bell-shaped  dose  response  curve 
seemed  likely,  but  once  again  the  experts  felt  that  additional  information  was  needed.  More 
specifically, it was noted that while evidence on the bell-shape dose-response curve was available 
in  several  pre-clinical  models,  no  data  were  generated  in  the  mdx  mouse  model,  relating  the 
production  of  dystrophin  to  the  levels  of  ataluren  in  the  muscle  fibres.  Such  evidence  would  be 
considered  of  relevance,  as  the  available  data  describe  only  the  relationship  between  plasmatic 
levels of ataluren and dystrophin production.  
Overall,  the  SAG  was  of  the  view  that  no  clear-cut  conclusions  could  be  derived  on  the  bell-
shaped dose-response hypothesis and the absence of efficacy in the higher dose studied in the Ph 
II trial.    
• 
Question 3 
Does the SAG consider, based on the data presented by the Applicant, that the observed 
effects  are  sufficiently  robust  and  clinically  meaningful  taking  into  account  the  results 
on the primary and secondary endpoints?  This should be discussed within the context 
of starting treatment at all stages of the disease (as now claimed by the MAH) or in the 
subgroup  of  patients  with  more  advanced  disease  (where  effects  appear  to  be 
different).  
The  SAG  considered  that  although  the  results  were  not  sufficiently  robust,  the  demonstrated 
effects were encouraging. The robustness of the results was challenged because of the observed 
variability in the primary efficacy data, the fact that many of the important conclusions supporting 
the  efficacy  of  the  drug  were  derived  from  the  performed  post  hoc  analyses,  and  the  fact  that 
there  was  little  supportive  evidence  of  effect  from  the  data  on  the  secondary  endpoints.  At  the 
same  time  it  was  recognized  that  at  the  time  the  study  was  designed  the  knowledge  of  the 
natural  history  of  the  disease  was  different  from  what  we  now  know.  It  was  agreed  that  the 
applicant has performed the post hoc analyses in line with the most current knowledge about the 
natural  history  of  the  disease,  and  in  this  respect  the  definition  of  the  sub-groups  in  these 
analyses  is  clinically  and  scientifically  justified.  The  SAG  experts  considered  that  the  results 
derived from these may be considered clinically relevant, especially in the sub-group of patients 
with  more  advanced  disease.  Additionally,  it  was  considered  that  the  lack  of  effect  on  the 
secondary  endpoints  could  be  explained  by  the  expected  mechanism  of  action  of  the  drug  i.e. 
partial  restoration of  dystrophin  production.  Most  of  the  secondary  endpoints  are  of  such  nature 
that any effect will have to be driven by an increase in strength, rather than an improvement of 
function.  The  experts  were  presented  with  the  latest  available  data,  showing  that  minimal 
increase in dystrophin production could lead to functional improvement, but not to improvement

of strength, and for the latter to occur, levels of dystrophin close to the ones in normal muscular 
fibres must be achieved. The SAG experts agreed that this could be a valid explanation of the lack 
of  concordance  between  the  primary  and  secondary  endpoints’  efficacy  data.  It  was  also  the 
position of the group that despite the fact that efficacy was most prominently shown in the sub-
group of patients with more advanced disease, there were trends of efficacy in all the sub-groups 
by severity, although of a different magnitude. This effect is to be expected, as according to the 
data  presented  by  the  experts,  the  decline  in  function  of  Duchenne  patients  is  not  linear,  but 
rather the speed of functional decline increases with the duration of the disease. In that respect, 
it  would  be  very  difficult  to  show  a  significant  functional  improvement  in  milder  patients  in  the 
frame  of  a  controlled  clinical  trial  with  duration  of  1  or  2  years.  On  the  contrary,  in  the  most 
severe patients even a small effect on function would be detectable and clinically meaningful. The 
patients and representatives in the room, in their statements, defended the position that at that 
late stage of the disease even small effects providing longer independent use of arms and hands, 
or preserving the ability to feed and drink from a cup on their own, would represent a significant 
and  important  effect.  Taking  all  of  the  above  in  consideration,  the  SAG  experts  felt  that  there 
should  be  no  scientific  reason  for  the  drug  not  to  be  given  to  milder  patients  if  efficacy  is 
established in more severe ones. The long term benefit on this population could be documented 
by a follow-up of data collected in specific registries.     
Overall,  considering  the  totality  of  the  evidence  available to  date,  the  SAG  was  of  the  view  that 
while ataluren can be considered as a potentially efficacious drug, the data from the confirmatory 
phase III trial are necessary before final conclusions on efficacy can be made. 
This conclusion was shared by the CHMP. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
While the effects observed in the pivotal study were considered generally encouraging, the CHMP 
considered  that  the  clinical  efficacy  data  submitted  were  not  adequate  and  did  not  provide 
sufficient  evidence  to  support  the  indication  of  ataluren  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with 
Duchenne muscular dystrophy. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
As of 12 May 2012, a total of 588 subjects had been exposed to ataluren in completed or ongoing 
clinical trials. This number comprised 76 healthy male and female volunteers, 218 male patients 
with  nmDMD,  270  male  and  female  patients  with  nmCF  and  24  male  and  female  patients  with 
nmHA/HB or nmMMA (table 14).

Table 14 Patient exposure to ataluren by age group, nmDMD and other indications 
In the completed studies in patients with nmDMD, ataluren was administered three times a day at 
one  of  three  dose  levels:  4,  4,  8  mg/kg;  10,  10,  20  mg/kg  and  20,  20,  40  mg/kg.  In  the 
completed studies in patients with nmCF, patients received ataluren three times a day at one of 
two dose levels: 4, 4, 8 mg/kg and 10, 10, 20 mg/kg. Healthy volunteers received single doses of 
ataluren up to 200 mg/kg and repeated doses up to 50 mg/kg BID for 7 days or 14 days. 
Adverse events 
The adverse-event profile of ataluren was comparable to that of placebo in patients with nmDMD 
in  the  main  study  007.  The  adverse  events  that  were  reported  in  ≥5%  of  patients  in  any 
treatment  arm  are  summarized  in  Table  15.  The  AEs  which  occurred  twice  as  frequently  in  the 
ataluren  groups  as  compared  to  placebo  are  highlighted.  None  of  the  patients  discontinued 
treatment  with  ataluren  or  withdrew  from  the  study  because  of  a  treatment-related  adverse 
event.

The  combined  safety  dataset  for  nmDMD  was  based  on  studies  007,  007e,  004e,  016  and  019. 
Patients in this dataset ranged in age from 5 to 22 years and the median age was 9 years. The 
combined  long-term  ataluren  exposure  was  achieved  in  179  nmDMD  patients  who  received 
ataluren  for  ≥48  weeks.  Ataluren  was  generally  well  tolerated  and  the  most  common  adverse 
events  (those  reported  in  ≥20%  of  patients)  included  headache  (40.7%),  diarrhoea  (27.3%), 
nasopharyngitis  (26.4%),  cough  (25.0%),  upper  abdominal  pain  (21.8%),  pyrexia  (21.8%),  fall 
(20.8%) and upper respiratory tract infection (20.8%). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths  
There were no deaths during the completed clinical studies of ataluren in nmDMD patients. In the 
ongoing open-label safety study for previously treated ataluren patients with nmDMD, study 016 
(PTC124-GD-016-DMD),  three  cases  of  death  were  reported:  a    male  patient  treated  with 
ataluren for ~9 months, a male patient treated with ataluren for ~14 months and a male patient 
treated  with  ataluren  for  ~18  months.  Causal  relationship  between  the  fatal  outcomes  and 
treatment with ataluren was not found. 
Serious AEs  
In  study  007,  serious  adverse  events  were  reported  in  5.3%  (3  of  57)  subjects  in  the  placebo 
arm,  in  3.5%  (2  of  57)  patients  in  the  ataluren  10,  10,  20  mg/kg  arm  and  in  3.3%  (2  of  60) 
patients  in  the  ataluren  20,  20,  40  mg/kg  arm.    None  of  the  serious  adverse  events  in  either 
ataluren arm was considered by the investigator to be related to ataluren (Table 16).

There were 21 SAEs reported from studies 007,007e, 004 and 004e. Fourteen of these SAEs were 
reported  in  patients  receiving  ataluren  and  only  one  (hypertension)  was  considered  by  the 
applicant  as  likely  related  to  the  ataluren.  The  case  of  paroxysmal  supraventricular  tachycardia 
was considered unlikely related to study drug by the applicant, because the patient had previously 
experienced similar symptoms and self-limiting episodes.  
There  were  three  SAE  cases  of  hypertension  (1  in  007e  and  2  in  004e)  of  which  one  was 
considered  as  related  to  ataluren.  In  addition,  there  were  five  cases  of  bone  fractures  reported 
(four fractures of femur and one of lower limb) of which one occurred in the placebo arm and 4 in 
patients  treated  with  ataluren;  none  of  these  cases  was  considered  by  the  investigators  to  be 
related to ataluren.  
Laboratory findings 
Data obtained in healthy volunteers indicated that exposure to ataluren could cause elevation of 
liver  enzymes  (but  not  bilirubin),  serum  cholesterol  and  triglycerides.  These  changes  seemed  to 
be dose-dependent and reversible after exposure to ataluren was stopped.  
No  significant  haematology  findings  or  signals  of  renal  toxicity  and  effects  on  adrenal  function 
were  seen  in  studies  007  and  007e.  The  only  finding  was  hepatic  toxicity,  which  was  expected 
given  the  data  from  healthy  volunteers.  There  were  ten  ataluren-treated  patients  and  one 
placebo-treated  patient  with  isolated  Grade  1  (mild)  elevations  in  GGT  or  total  bilirubin.  Mean 
cholesterol and triglycerides levels were in the upper range of normal at baseline and increased to 
borderline-high  or  high  levels  in  the  ataluren  arms  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  in  the  placebo 
treatment  arm  during  treatment,  primarily  in  patients  who  were  receiving  corticosteroids  (Table 
17).

No  clear  relationship  was  identified  between  pulse  rate,  respiration  rate  or  temperature  and  the 
use of ataluren, but increased blood pressure was observed (table 18). This increase was slightly 
higher in the subgroup using corticosteroids than in the subgroup not using corticosteroids. There 
was also a slight increase in the diastolic blood pressure in all treatment arms.

Safety in special populations 
Age-related  differences  in  frequency  of  some  of  the  frequent  adverse  events  were  observed. 
Vomiting,  pyrexia,  abdominal  pain,  influenza  and  viral  gastroenteritis  were  more  frequent  in 
children  aged  5  to  6  years  than  in  older  children.  Headache,  diarrhoea,  upper  abdominal  pain, 
nausea, falls, procedural pain, pain in extremity, back pain, rash, flatulence, disease progression, 
oropharyngeal pain and dizziness occurred more frequently in the older categories.  
No studies were conducted in patients with renal or hepatic impairment and safety in these populations was 
not  fully  established.  These  safety  concerns  were  proposed  by  the  Applicant  to  be  reflected  as  “Missing 
information”  in  the  RMP  and  the  use  of  ataluren  in  these  patients  was  proposed  to  be  subject  to  close 
monitoring.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Specific  drug-drug  interaction  studies  of  ataluren  were  not  conducted.  Potential  interaction 
between ataluren and corticosteroids was investigated by analysing pharmacokinetics in Phase 2 
nmDMD patients receiving corticosteroids and adverse events by corticosteroid usage in the long-
term  studies  in  nmDMD  patients.  Of  note,  hypertension  was  reported  in  some  patients 
concomitantly treated with systemic corticosteroids. 
In  the  long-term  studies  of  ataluren  in  nmDMD  patients  (Studies  007,  007e,  and  004e), 
concomitant  use  of  warfarin  was  not  allowed  because  ataluren  may  slow  the  clearance  of 
medications that are primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 2C9.

Safety  results  from  the  placebo-controlled  study  009  in  nmCF  patients  suggested  a  potential 
interaction of ataluren with intravenous aminoglycosides. Serious adverse events related to renal 
dysfunction,  which  occurred  only  in  the  ataluren  arm,  included  three  patients  with  acute  renal 
failure,  three  patients  with  renal  failure  and  one  patient  with  hypercreatininemia.  These  events 
were  characterised  by  elevated  creatinine  (Grade  1  to  Grade  4),  which  resolved  over  days  to 
weeks.  All  seven  events  were  associated  with  concomitant  systemic  treatment  with 
aminoglycosides or other potentially nephrotoxic antibiotics (e.g. vancomycin) that were generally 
administered  as  treatment  for  pulmonary  exacerbations.  No  patient  required  dialysis.  This  issue 
was  recognized  during  the  conduct  of  this  study  and  changes  were  made  in  the  protocol 
(prohibition  of  concomitant  use  of  intravenous  aminoglycosides  or  other  potentially  nephrotoxic 
antibiotics), which successfully addressed the issue.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
A total of 6 of the 216 nmDMD patients (2.8%) discontinued treatment because of one or more 
adverse  events.  Vomiting  was  reported  as  the  reason  for  discontinuation  of  treatment  in  two 
patients.  One  patient  discontinued  due  to  a  Grade  1  micturition  disorder,  indicated  as  unlikely 
related  to  study  drug.  After  the  interim  database  cut-off  date  for  Study  016,  one  additional 
patient discontinued due to abnormal cystatin C and BUN values. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events was also seen in the nmCF studies (e.g. due to renal and 
urinary disorders). 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  safety  profile  of  ataluren  was  based  on  data  from  phase  1  studies  in  healthy  volunteers, 
phase  2  studies  in  DMD  patients  and  their  extensions.  Upon  request  from  the  CHMP  during  the 
course of the procedure, the Applicant also provided an analysis on a combined safety data from 
the nmDMD  patients.  Of  note,  more  than  50%  of  patients  were exposed to  ataluren  for  at least 
96  weeks,  which  was  considered  to  constitute  a  sufficient  long-term  safety  database,  especially 
taking  into  account  the  nature  of  the  condition.    The  CHMP  also  considered  that  additional 
information  on  safety  was  derived  from  studies  in  other  conditions  (nmCF,  nmHA/HB  and 
nmMMA). 
With  respect  to  data  from  the  phase  1  studies,  next  to  headache  and  gastrointestinal  adverse 
events, there were signals that exposure to ataluren could lead to elevation of liver enzymes as 
well  as  serum  cholesterol  and  triglycerides.  Cases  of  hepatic  toxicity  (elevated  liver  enzymes) 
were seen also in DMD patients in the pivotal phase 2 study 007. While these changes seemed to 
be  reversible  after  exposure  to  ataluren  was  stopped,  the  CHMP  considered  that  ataluren  was 
intended for continuous life-long use and hence, reversibility of elevated liver enzymes was seen 
as  less  relevant  for  the  target  population.  Overall,  the  CHMP  considered  hepatotoxicity  as  an 
important potential risk.  
Similarly, the effect of ataluren on cholesterol and triglyceride levels was also documented in DMD 
patients.  In  study  007,  mean  cholesterol  and  triglyceride  levels  increased  to  borderline-high  or 
high  levels  in  both  ataluren  treatment  arms  and  to  a  lesser  extent  in  the  placebo  arm  and  the 
increase  was  more  prominent  in  patients  who  received  corticosteroid  therapy.  The  CHMP 
considered  that  this  would  be  the  case  in  the  majority  of  DMD  patients  in  clinical  practice  and 
considered this finding as a safety concern. 
The treatment-related adverse events reported most commonly in the study 007 (i.e. in ≥5% of

patients across all 3 treatment arms) were vomiting, diarrhoea, upper abdominal pain, flatulence, 
nausea, headache and decreased appetite. The CHMP considered that most of these occurred with 
similar  frequency  in  the  placebo  and  ataluren  arms.  The  adverse  events  vomiting,  flatulence, 
stomach discomfort and fatigue were seen to increase in frequency from placebo to ataluren 10, 
10, 20 mg/kg to ataluren 20, 20, 40 mg/kg.   
Increase  in  systolic  and  to  a  less  extent  in  diastolic  blood  pressure  was  observed  in  subjects 
treated  with  ataluren  and  there  were  three  cases  of  hypertension,  some  of  which  required 
antihypertensive  treatment.  The  CHMP  considered  that  the  use  of  corticosteroids  may  have 
contributed to these cases. However, if authorised, ataluren would be used mostly in combination 
with  corticosteroids  and  thus,  the  potential  risk  of  hypertension  with  concomitant  use  of 
corticosteroids was considered as a safety concern by the CHMP, particularly in the context of a 
disease with frequent development of cardiomyopathy.  
Based  on  the  combined  safety  dataset  analysis,  i.e.  data  from  patients  in  studies  007,  007e, 
004e,  016  and  019,  the  CHMP  considered  that  ataluren  was  generally  well  tolerated  by  patients 
with nmDMD, with the most common adverse events (those reported in ≥20% of patients) being 
those  that  are  typical  of  paediatric  illnesses  or  DMD  complications,  e.g.  headache  (41%), 
diarrhoea  (27%),  nasopharyngitis  (26%),  cough  (25%),  upper  abdominal  pain  (22%),  pyrexia 
(22%), fall (21%) and upper respiratory tract infection (21%).  
Additionally, the safety analysis indicated the changes in the lipid profile, hypertension, renal and 
hepatic  events  need  to  be  considered  as  safety  concerns  and  reflected  in  the  Risk  Management 
Plan.  
The  CHMP  considered  there  were  only  few  treatment-related  serious  adverse  events.  Femur 
fracture  (4.2%)  was  the  most  frequently  reported  serious  adverse  event,  but  none  of  these 
fractures which met the criteria for a serious adverse event was considered by the investigators to 
be  related  to  ataluren.  Although  the  causal  relationship  was  not  suggested  by  the  investigators, 
the CHMP paid attention to this signal, considering that lower limb fractures in DMD patients may 
lead  to  immobilization  which  may  become  permanent,  i.e.  transition  to  non-ambulation.  Further 
to their review of additional data on lower limb and on all fractures both in nmDMD and in nmCF 
patients,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  over  comparable  periods,  there  was  no  signal  of  higher 
frequency of fractures in subjects exposed to ataluren, as compared to placebo.   
With respect to specific patient populations, the CHMP considered that no studies were conducted 
in  patients  with  renal  or  hepatic  impairment  and  safety  in  these  populations  was  not  fully 
established. Since renal excretion accounts for ~ 50% of the drug elimination, renal impairment is 
likely to result in accumulation of ataluren and/or ataluren glucuronide. Similarly, since ataluren is 
extensively  metabolized  in  liver,  hepatic  impairment  is  expected  to  result  in  ataluren  increased 
plasma  concentrations.  Taken  together  with  the  uncertainties  around  the  claimed  bell-shaped 
dose-response  curve,  the  CHMP  considered  that  without  clinical  data,  understanding  of  both 
efficacy  and  safety  profile  of  ataluren  in  subjects  with  renal  or  hepatic  impairment  remains 
limited. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  no  immunological  events  were  reported  in  the  DMD  patients  treated 
with ataluren. Although immunological reactions are not expected for this type of compound, the 
Applicant  was  requested  to  review  all  available  data,  including  those  from  the  CF  clinical 
programme.  Two  CF  patients  receiving  ataluren  had  allergic  reactions  possibly  related  to  the 
investigational  drug,  as  compared  to  one  patient  on  placebo.  Based  on  the  data  available, 
ataluren’s potential for immunogenicity was considered low by the CHMP.

Despite  substantial  differences  between  the  DMD  and  CF  patient  populations  (differences  in 
demographics, concomitant medications, complications of the disease, overall health status/ need 
for  hospitalisations),  the  safety  data  from  the  combined  nmCF  population  was  considered 
supportive of  the  safety  profile  for  ataluren in nmDMD.  Ataluren  was  generally  well  tolerated  by 
the  nmCF  patients,  who  were  exposed  to  ataluren  in  the  two  long-term  studies  for  up  to  two 
years. The adverse events were typical of CF and included cystic fibrosis pulmonary exacerbation 
(84%), cough (32%), viral upper respiratory tract infection (28%) and pyrexia (22%) as the most 
frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events (reported in ≥20% of patients). Most of 
the adverse events were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity, were not attributed to ataluren and did 
not lead to discontinuation of treatment with ataluren. The data generated in the CF patients also 
provided  evidence  of  interactions  between  ataluren  and  i.v.  aminoglycosides,  which  was 
considered  of  relevance  and  supportive  of  a  respective  contraindication  should  the  product  be 
authorised. Ultrasound examinations (in nmDMD and nmCF studies) identified cases of abnormal 
renal ultrasound findings. In particular, the nmCF study data suggested a clear effect of ataluren 
on  renal  abnormalities.  Of  note,  five  events  of  renal  disorders  were  reported  as  serious  adverse 
events  in  nmCF  patients.  The  CHMP  considered  that  although  the  mechanism  of  a  potential 
contribution of ataluren to the reported cases of nephrotoxicity was not known, this signal in the 
clinical  development  appeared  to  reinforce  the  non-clinical  findings  seen  in  mice.  Based  on  the 
clinical data available, renal toxicity was assumed to occur less likely in DMD patients but was still 
perceived  as  a  safety  concern.  The  CHMP  concluded  that  it  should  be  considered  as  a  potential 
important risk. 
The CHMP pointed out a theoretical concern about possible effects of ataluren on reading through 
normal stop codons and hence producing abnormally elongated proteins. This was investigated in 
healthy  volunteers  and  the  results  did  not  confirm  that  this  would  be  the  case.  This  was 
considered  re-assuring  by  the  CHMP.  However,  these  analyses  were  performed  on  a  number  of 
selected  proteins  and  on pooled  samples  from  peripheral blood of  healthy  volunteers.  Moreover, 
the CHMP noted that the non-specific read through of normal stop codons should be examined in 
a range of plasmatic concentrations which are expected to bring about the read-through in DMD 
patients.  In  response  to  this  concern,  lysates  from  muscle  biopsies  obtained  from  48  nmDMD 
patients  treated  with  ataluren  10,  10,  20  mg/kg  for  36  weeks  (Study  007)  were  analysed  by 
Western  blotting.  Two  muscle  proteins  were  examined  (GAPDH  and  β-actin)  without  further 
evidence of protein elongation. Nevertheless, the CHMP was of the view that the theoretical risk 
of non-specific read-through of normal stop codons still remains an uncertainty. 
Furthermore, the CHMP flagged a theoretical concern that ataluren could enhance read through of 
non-sense mutations in other genes. The applicant discussed the potential endogenous nonsense 
codons substrates for ataluren presenting theoretical arguments why no effect on these would be 
expected.  However,  no  data  were  submitted  in  support  of  these  statements.  Overall,  the  CHMP 
concluded that the potential off-target effects were an uncertainty about the risks related to the 
mechanism of action of ataluren.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the CHMP was of the view that the Applicant performed a comprehensive safety analysis 
and that the safety profile of ataluren could be considered acceptable, although it was based on a 
rather limited patient exposure.

PRAC Advice 
Based on the PRAC review of the applicant´s response to the previous list of questions referring 
to  the  Risk  Management  Plan  version  1.2,  the  PRAC  considered  by  consensus  that  the  risk 
management  plan  for  Translarna  (ataluren)  in  the  proposed  treatment  of  Duchenne  muscular 
dystrophy,  resulting  from  a  nonsense  mutation  in  the  dystrophin  gene  (nmDMD)  in  ambulatory 
patients aged 5 years and older, could be acceptable provided that an updated risk management 
plan is submitted before final CHMP opinion, addressing the following issues: 
Hepatic  toxicity  should  be  included  as  an  important  potential  risk.  In  addition,  all 
• 
corresponding sections throughout the RMP require revision accordingly. 
The  summary  table  of  risk  minimisation  measures  should  be  edited,  as  no  additional  risk 
• 
minimisation  measures  are  planned  for  any  of  the  safety  concerns  in  the  RMP.  In  the  absence  of 
educational materials, the relevant sections of the RMP should be edited to clarify how health-care 
professionals (and patients if needed) will be advised about the need for monitoring of the patient’s 
lipid  profile,  renal  and  hepatic  function  monitoring  and  for  the  monitoring  of  blood  pressure. 
Genetic testing might also be considered. Furthermore, the reported risk minimisation measures in 
the summary table should be limited to SmPC (i.e. no Package Leaflet references are expected). 
Please  note  that  amendments  are  needed  in  the  proposed  SmPC  to  ensure  monitoring

Translarna should not be co-administered 
with intravenous aminoglycosides, based on 
cases of decreased renal function observed in 
a clinical trial in patients with nonsense 
mutation cystic fibrosis (nmCF) (see section 
4.3). 
Elevations of serum creatinine occurred in 
several nmCF patients treated with Translarna 
and intravenous aminoglycosides together 
with other antibiotics for cystic fibrosis 
exacerbations. The serum creatinine 
elevations resolved in all cases, with 
discontinuation of the intravenous 
aminoglycoside, and either continuation or 
interruption of the study drug. These findings 
suggested that co-administration of

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Ataluren  is  a  first-in-class  drug  designed  to  enable  ribosomal  readthrough  of  premature  stop 
codons,  resulting  in  the  formation  of  a  full-length  functional  protein  in  patients  with  nonsense 
mutation  genetic  disorders.  In  the  proof  of  concept  study  in  mdx  mice  ataluren  was  seen  to 
promote formation and adequate localization of dystrophin, resulting in increased muscle strength 
and prevention of loss of strength following repeated contractions. 
In  the  clinical  setting,  beneficial  effects  of  the  lower  dose  (10,  10,  20  mg/kg)  were  claimed  in 
both primary and secondary endpoints of physical functioning.  
With  respect  to  6MWD,  ataluren  was  observed  to  slow  disease  progression  in  nmDMD  patients. 
The  post-hoc  analysis  in  the  cITT  population  indicated  an  estimated  difference  in  the  Change  in 
6MWD  at  Week  48  of  31.7  metres  (nominal  p=0.0281,  adjusted  p=0.0561,  observed  mean 
difference  in  6MWD=31.3  metres)  between  the  10,  10,  20  mg/kg  dose  and  placebo.  Looking  at 
the  proportions  of  patients  with  at  least  10%  worsening  in  6MWD  at  Week  48,  44%  vs  26%  of 
patients  in  the  placebo  and  the  10,  10,  20  mg/kg  ataluren  arm,  respectively  were  progressors 
(nominal p=0.0326, adjusted p=0.0652) .  
A  greater  effect  over  48  weeks  was  seen  in  patients  in  the  “ambulatory  decline”  phase,  i.e. 
patients  between  7  and  16  years  of  age,  with  baseline  6MWD  ≥150m  and  ≤80%  of  predicted 
value.  Based  on  a  post-hoc  subgroup  analysis  in  this  population,  a  difference  in  the  change  in 
6MWD at Week 48 of 49.9 metres (p=0.0096) between the 10, 10, 20 mg/kg dose and placebo 
was seen. 
In  terms  of  secondary  endpoints  of  physical  functioning,  only  limited  effects  of  ataluren  were 
observed:  ataluren  patients  had  fewer  falls/week  than  placebo-dosed  patients;  increase  of 
wheelchair use from baseline was less in ataluren than placebo; ataluren patients spent less time 
in  “no  activity”  (based  on  Step  activity  monitoring)  and  a  minor  positive  trend  was  observed  in 
myometry tests. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The  CHMP  was  of  the  view  that  the  main  uncertainties  about  the  claimed  beneficial  effects 
pertained to the robustness of efficacy data in general, the dose-response curve (and hence the 
appropriate dose) and the applicability of the data to the overall target population. 
Uncertainties about robustness of efficacy data 
The  primary  analysis  of  the  pivotal  study  007  indicated  an  estimated  difference  of  26.4  m 
between  placebo  and  the  low  dose  arm;  this,  however,  was  not  statistically  significant  (nominal 
p=value 0.0905, adjusted p value=0.1592) and by the usual statistical standards, the study was

formally  negative.  In  order  to  explain  the  findings  in  study  007,  the  Applicant  performed  a 
number  of  post  hoc  analyses.  These  consistently  showed  a  similar  difference  in  6MWD,  but  the 
wide confidence intervals reflected the uncertainty in the estimate. 
The  CHMP  was  of  the  view  that  the  results  on  the  secondary  endpoints  provided  only  limited 
support  for  the  primary  endpoint  outcomes,  as  they  were  inconsistent,  difficult  to  interpret  and 
needed  to  be  seen only  as  trends.  Nevertheless,  in  line  with  the  input  from  the  SAG  Neurology, 
the CHMP acknowledged that most of the secondary endpoints were of such nature that any effect 
would  have  to  be  driven  by  an  increase  in  strength  and  for  this  to  occur,  higher  levels  of 
dystrophin in muscular fibres would have to be achieved. 
Pharmacodynamic confirmation of efficacy was not provided by the pivotal study, despite the fact 
that  biopsies  were  collected.  While  the  technical  problems  with  dystrophin  quantification  were 
recognised by the CHMP, the quality of the biopsies supplied was of concern.  The GCP inspection 
identified that several steps were underestimated, namely instructions for performing the muscle 
biopsies and the storage/ shipping logistics. Since the mechanism of action of ataluren is claimed 
to be by promoting production of a full-length dystrophin, more prominent evidence of dystrophin 
in muscle of patients treated for 48 weeks would be expected. Considering the limitations of data 
on clinical efficacy, the CHMP pointed out that the dossier would have benefited from supportive 
data on pharmacodynamics and their absence was seen as adding to the uncertainties. 
Uncertainties about the dose-response curve and dose 
The  CHMP  considered  that  one  of  the  critical  issues  was  the  absence  of  effect  in  patients  treated 
with the higher dose. The applicant argued that the finding could be explained by the bell-shaped 
curve  dose  response,  supporting  their  position  by  a  combination  of  in  vitro  data  (e.g.  human 
myotube  cultures,  nmDMD  mouse  myotubes  and  nmDMD  zebrafish)  and  clinical  data  (studies 
004e,  007  and  007e).  The  bell-shape  response  curve  was  however  not  obvious  based  on  the  in 
vivo preclinical data and the phase 2a clinical data, i.e. before the design and start of the clinical 
studies 004e, 007 and 007e.   
In  order  to  further  address  this  issue,  the  applicant  submitted  a  correlation  between  the  plasma 
concentration achieved and the effect in terms of 6MWT and TFTs supporting the robustness of the 
effect  of  the  selected  dose.  While  patients  with  lower  concentrations  appeared  to  show  better 
results  on  6MWD  as  well  as  across  timed  function  tests,  the  CHMP  considered  that  a  scatter  plot 
with change in 6MWT and plasma concentration on an individual patient level would have been of 
greater value. This data were additionally presented by the applicant, but no specific pattern could 
be  identified  to  provide  additional  evidence  in  support  of  the  bell  shape  concentration  response 
curve. 
Overall, the data in support of the bell-shape curve hypothesis were considered to be inconsistent 
and not allowing a reliable assessment. The CHMP concluded that the effect observed in the lower 
dose only could be a chance finding.  
Validity of data for the entire nmDMD patient population 
Since efficacy was investigated in a subgroup of ambulant DMD boys and documented mainly on 
ambulation  parameters,  extrapolation  to  the  broader  nmDMD  patient  population  (including  non-
ambulant subjects) was not supported by sufficient evidence.

Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Ataluren  was  generally  well  tolerated  by  patients  with  nmDMD,  with  the  most  common  adverse 
events  being  headache  and  gastrointestinal  disorders  such  as  nausea,  vomiting,  (upper) 
abdominal pain, flatulence, diarrhoea, stomach discomfort, constipation and regurgitation. 
The  laboratory  data  indicated  that  exposure  to  ataluren  could  cause  elevation  of  serum 
cholesterol and triglycerides. Mean cholesterol and triglycerides levels were in the upper range of 
normal at baseline and increased to borderline-high or high levels in the ataluren arms, primarily 
in  patients  who  were  receiving  corticosteroids.  The  values  tended  to  stabilize  early  and  did  not 
increase  further  with  continued  treatment.  “Changes  in  the  lipid  profile”  were  considered  as  an 
important identified risk in the proposed Risk Management Plan. 
Of note, elevations of serum creatinine occurred in several patients with nonsense mutation cystic 
fibrosis  treated  concomitantly  with  intravenous  aminoglycosides.  In  all  cases,  the  elevations 
resolved with discontinuation of the aminoglycosides indicating that co-administration of ataluren 
and  intravenous  aminoglycosides  may  potentiate  the  nephrotoxic  effect  of  the  aminoglycosides. 
Based on this evidence of decreased renal function, “potentiation of aminoglycoside renal toxicity” 
was determined as an important identified risk.  
There  were  no  deaths  during  the  placebo  controlled  study.  Three  fatal  cases  were  seen  in  one 
open-label study, but the fatal outcomes were not considered related to treatment with ataluren.   
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
From the non-clinical database, the finding of malignant hibernomas in rat raised the concern as 
to  whether  occurrence  of  similar  effects  could  be  expected  in  humans,  particularly  in  the 
paediatric population where the quantity of the brown adipose tissue is higher. In particular, the 
CHMP  considered  that  malignant  hibernomas  could  be  related  to  the  effects  of  ataluren  on  fat 
tissue metabolism and to effects on plasma lipid parameters, which were observed in rats, dogs 
and  humans.  Thus,  “hibernomas”  were  reflected  in  the  proposed  risk  management  plan  of 
ataluren as an important potential risk. 
Considering  the  mechanism  of  action  of  ataluren,  the  CHMP  pointed  out  a  theoretical  concern 
about  possible  effects  of  ataluren  on  reading  through  normal  stop  codons  (and  thus  producing 
abnormally elongated proteins) and a concern that ataluren could enhance read through of non-
sense  mutations  in  other  genes.  Although  such  effects  were  not  seen  in  the  data  available,  the 
CHMP was of the view that the potential off-target effects were an uncertainty about the risks of 
ataluren.  
Based on results of in vitro studies, ataluren was expected to have an interaction potential, which 
the  CHMP  considered  necessary  to  be  explored  further  in  vivo.  This  pertained  to  ataluren 
interactions  with  a  BCRP  inhibitor,  UGT1A9  substrate,  OAT1,  OAT3  and  OATP1B3  substrates  and 
UGT1A9 selective inducer. 
Increase  in  blood  pressure  including  cases  of  hypertension  requiring  antihypertensive  treatment 
was  observed  in  subjects  treated  with  ataluren.  While  this  could  have  been  due  to  the  use  of 
corticosteroids administered concomitantly, this issue was considered an uncertainty and captured 
as a potential risk in the proposed Risk Management Plan. 
The  preclinical  data  as  well  as  data  from  healthy  volunteers  and  DMD  patients  indicated  that 
exposure to ataluren may lead to increase in transaminases. While these changes seemed to be

reversible  after  exposure  to  ataluren  was  stopped  and  a  clear  hepatotoxic  effect  was  not 
confirmed, the CHMP considered hepatotoxicity as an important potential risk. 
The  nmCF  study  data  suggested  an  effect  of  ataluren  on  renal  abnormalities.  Although  the 
mechanism of a potential contribution of ataluren to the reported cases of nephrotoxicity was not 
known, this signal in the clinical development appeared to reinforce the non-clinical findings seen 
in  mice.  Based  on  the  clinical  data  available,  renal  toxicity  was  assumed  to  occur  less  likely  in 
DMD patients, but was still perceived as a potential important risk. 
Treatment  of  patients  with  renal  or  hepatic  impairment  is  another  area  of  uncertainty,  as  no 
specific  studies  were  performed  and  potential  safety  concerns  are 
implied  by 
the 
pharmacokinetics of ataluren. Since renal excretion accounts for ~ 50% of the drug elimination, 
renal  impairment  is  likely  to  result  in  accumulation  of  ataluren  and/or  ataluren  glucuronide. 
Similarly,  since  ataluren  is  extensively  metabolized  in  liver,  hepatic  impairment  is  expected  to 
result in ataluren increased plasma concentrations. Taken together with the uncertainties around 
the  claimed  bell-shaped  dose-response  curve,  the  CHMP  considered  that  without  clinical  data, 
understanding  of  both  efficacy  and  safety  profile  of  ataluren  in  subjects  with  renal  or  hepatic 
impairment remains limited. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Several  lines  of  evidence  support  the  clinical  relevance  of  a  30-meter  difference  in  6MWT, 
including a report2 showing that a 30-meter change in 6MWD over 48 weeks can be considered a 
clinically meaningful change based on the patient/parent-reported quality of life measures in DMD 
patients.  This  is  also  supported  by  results  of  longitudinal  LMWT  natural  history  data  in  DMD, 
indicating  that  each  30-meter  decrease  in  baseline  6MWD  predicts  increasing  risk  of  loss  of 
ambulation over the following 2 years. 
Ability to climb and descend a short grouping of stairs, abililty to run in short bursts, or to walk a 
short distance unaided, e.g. to a bathroom, reflect the typical activities important in the lives of 
DMD  patients.  Importantly,  recent  data  indicated  that  timed  function  tests  evaluating  these 
abilities  are,  similarly  to  6MWT,  predictive  of  the  time  for  a  patient  to  become  non-ambulatory. 
Natural  history  data  from  the  Cooperative  International  Neuromuscular  Group  indicated  that 
changes  in  these  parameters  are  predictive  of  the  likelihood  of  loss  of  ambulation  over  1  year. 
Falls commonly lead to fractures in DMD patients and the injuries sustained may accelerate loss 
of  ambulation.  Decreasing  the  rate  of  accidental  falls  and  hence  the  risk  of  fractures,  pain  and 
other  trauma  would  be  of  benefit  to  the  patients.  With  respect  to  decrease  in  wheel  chair  use, 
benefits can be attributed not only in terms of ambulation itself, but also by positively impacting 
on the respiratory function and minimalisation of scoliosis. Thus, if sufficiently documented these 
effects would be considered of high importance. 
The  most  commonly  reported  treatment-related  adverse  events  vomiting,  diarrhoea,  abdominal 
pain  upper,  flatulence,  nausea,  headache  and  decreased  appetite  were  not  considered  to  raise 
major safety concerns in a seriously debilitating and life-threatening condition such as DMD.

The  effect  of  ataluren  on  the  lipid  profile  (cholesterol  and  triglyceride  levels)  was  considered  of 
importance,  especially  in  a  situation  where  long-term  administration  of  corticosteroids  is 
expected.  Nevertheless,  the  values  tended  to  stabilize  early  in  the  study  and  did  not  increase 
further  with  continued  treatment,  which  was  considered  re-assuring.  Similarly,  the  risk  of 
hypertension during concomitant use of corticosteroids and ataluren was seen as of importance to 
the  target  population,  considering  that  such  co-administration  would  occur  in  the  majority  of 
patients in the clinical practice. 
In the context of the age group targeted, the potential risk of hibernoma was considered relevant, 
due to higher proportion of brown fat tissue in children. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  data  presented  in  the  dossier  had  several  deficiencies  which 
impacted  on  the  benefit-risk  assessment.  In  particular,  the  Applicant  conducted  only  a  single 
pivotal trial and with the formal failure of its primary analysis, the efficacy discussion was based on 
post hoc analyses. It was agreed that these analyses were performed in line with the most current 
knowledge about the natural history of the disease (gained during the conduct of study 007), and 
in  this  respect  the  definition  of  the  subgroups  in  these  analyses  was  clinically  and  scientifically 
justified  (e.g.  patients  in  decline  phase  of  their  ambulation).  While  the  effects  observed  in  the 
pivotal study were considered generally encouraging, as supported also by the SAG Neurology, the 
CHMP was of the view that they still need to be seen as failing to provide compelling evidence of 
efficacy (due to the failure of the primary analysis). 
Considering the limitations of data on clinical efficacy, the CHMP pointed out that the dossier would 
have  benefited  from  supportive  data  on  pharmacodynamics,  i.e.  data  on dystrophin  production in 
human muscle and evidence supporting the bell-shape dose response hypothesis. In this respect, 
the  CHMP  noted  that  while  dystrophin  production  was  observed  in  the  phase  IIa  study  004,  the 
limited  data  from  the  pivotal  study  (due  to  the  low  quality  of  muscle  biopsies)  precluded 
confirmation of a pharmacodynamic effect. Even though it was acknowledged that dystrophin is not 
a valid biomarker for efficacy, the mechanism of action is directly linked to its production and the 
limited data from study 007 on dystrophin production contributed to the overall uncertainties. 
As discussed above, the bell-shape dose response hypothesis was used by the Applicant to explain 
why  effects  were  only  seen  with  the  lower  dose  (10,  10,  20  mg/kg).  The  CHMP  considered  that 
unless the hypothesis is supported by sufficient (non)-clinical data, the observation of an effect in 
the  lower  dose  and no  effect  in  higher  dose  could  be  considered  as  a  chance  finding.  Taking  into 
account  all  available  evidence,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  view  that  the  bell-shaped  dose  response 
hypothesis was not confirmed. 
Furthermore, the CHMP was of the view that the results on the secondary endpoints provided only 
limited support for the primary endpoint outcomes, as they were inconsistent, difficult to interpret 
and could be considered only as trends. In particular, the fact that endpoints more directly linked 
to the daily living activities or those reflecting the negative impact of the condition (falls, level of 
physical activity or wheelchair use) did not show a re-assuring effect was of concern.  
All these aspects taken together were considered as having a negative impact on the robustness of 
the data in a broader sense, i.e. in addition to the statistical considerations. 
In  their  discussion,  the  CHMP  also  focused  on  the  fact  that  ataluren  was  evaluated  only  in 
ambulatory  patients,  whereas  the  product  was  intended  for  a  broader  patient  population. 
Furthermore,  considering  that  the  beneficial  effects  were  most  prominent  in  a  sub-population  of 
Translarna

ambulatory  patients  in  the  decline  phase  of  their  walking  ability  (effect  size  of  approximately  50 
metres  on  the  6MWD),  the  CHMP  discussed  whether  the  benefit-risk  balance could  be  considered 
favourable  in  this  population,  and  whether  this  should  lead  to  a  restriction  of  the  proposed 
indication. Of note, the SAG experts felt that scientifically  there should be no reason for the drug 
not to be given to milder patients if efficacy had been established in more severe ones. This was 
considered  by  the  CHMP,  but  the  overall  conclusion  was  that  based  on  the  level  of  uncertainties, 
efficacy could not be reliably established even in this subpopulation. 
Although  the  safety  data  identified  some  safety  concerns,  in  general  these  were  considered 
manageable  through  the  implementation  of  adequate  pharmacovigilance  activities  and  risk 
minimisation  measures  as  described  in  the  proposed  Risk  Management  Plan.  The  lack  of  serious 
toxic effects and the oral administration were also considered to represent clear advantages for a 
population of mainly paediatric patients. 
Overall, the CHMP was of  the view that the risks of the product could be considered acceptable if 
there  were  data  providing  sufficient  level  of  evidence  that  ataluren  may  be  beneficial  in  delaying 
disease  progression  in  nmDMD.  However,  considering  the  totality  of  data  available  and  the 
uncertainties described above, the CHMP concluded that a favourable benefit-risk balance could not 
be established at this point.  
The  applicant  applied  for  a  conditional  marketing  authorisation  with  the  proposal  that  additional 
data  would  be  generated  post-authorisation  in  the  confirmatory  phase  3  study  PTC124-GD-020-
DMD (Study 020). Therefore, the CHMP also discussed the criteria that would need to be met for a 
conditional approval and made the following conclusions: 
• 
DMD  is  a  life-threatening  and  chronically  debilitating  condition  where  no  satisfactory 
methods  of  treatment  exist  and  it  was  considered  that  the  product  would  thus  address  an  unmet 
medical need. 
• 
The CHMP pointed out that while in case of an orphan condition the clinical dataset might 
not be fully comprehensive, the evidence of efficacy should be sufficient to allow assessment and 
concluding  on  a  favourable  benefit-risk  balance.  As  discussed  above,  a  favourable  benefit  risk 
balance of ataluren was not considered established at this point.  
• 
The  criterion  that  the  benefits  to  public  health  of  the  immediate  availability  outweigh  the 
risks inherent in the fact that additional data are still required was not considered fulfilled since the 
benefits to public health were not substantiated by the data presented in the dossier. 
• 
With  respect  to  generating  additional  data  post  authorisation,  the  CHMP  considered  that 
the  Applicant  intends  to  conduct  a  confirmatory  randomized  placebo-controlled  Phase  3  study 
(Study 020) with the 10, 10, 20 mg/kg/day dose in patients with nmDMD. The CHMP agreed that 
this clinical trial may provide data alleviating the current uncertainties, but noted that although it 
will  presumably  be  well  advanced  by  the  time  the  product  is  launched,  its  conduct  (specifically 
retention  of  patients)  might  be  affected  by  the  availability  of  an  authorised  product.  This  impact 
was  considered  specifically  in  the  context  of  the  paediatric  setting.  Thus,  the  marketing 
authorisation  might  jeopardise  feasibility  of  completing  the  study  and  hence  the  quality  of  the 
results. 
Overall,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  conditions  for  granting  a  conditional  marketing  authorisation 
were not met.

4.  Recommendations 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy for Translarna in the treatment 
of  Duchenne  muscular  dystrophy  resulting  from  a  nonsense  mutation  in  the  dystrophin  gene,  in 
patients aged 5 years and older the CHMP considers by majority decision that the efficacy of the 
above  mentioned  medicinal  product  is  not  sufficiently  demonstrated  and  therefore  recommends 
the  refusal  of  the  granting  of  the  conditional  Marketing  Authorisation  for  the  above  mentioned 
medicinal product. The CHMP considers that: 
The  single  study  fails  to  demonstrate  persuasive  evidence  of  therapeutic  efficacy  of 
• 
Translarna  in  terms  of  the  primary  endpoint  (6MWT)  and  further  efficacy  parameters  confirming 
functional  improvement  and  activities  of  daily  living.   Furthermore,  the  mechanism  of  action  and 
the  bell  shape  dose-response  relationship  of  Translarna  were  not  conclusively  established,  which 
adds further uncertainty on the overall robustness of the efficacy data.   
Therefore,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that  pursuant  to  Article  12  of  Regulation  (EC)  No 
726/2004,  the  efficacy  of  the  above  mentioned  medicinal  product  is  not  properly  or  sufficiently 
demonstrated. 
Furthermore,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  Applicant  has  not  convincingly  shown  that 
• 
comprehensive data can be obtained from the confirmatory placebo-controlled trial if the product is 
authorised and available on the market. 
Due  to  the  aforementioned  concerns  a  satisfactory  summary  of  product  characteristics,  package 
leaflet and risk management plan to address other concerns as outlined in the list of outstanding 
issues cannot be agreed at this stage. 
Furthermore, the CHMP, in light of the negative recommendation, is of the opinion that it is not 
appropriate to conclude on the new active substance status at this time. 
Divergent positions to the majority recommendation are appended to this report. 
Re-examination of the CHMP opinion of 22 May 2014 
Following the CHMP conclusion that Translarna was not approvable due to the lack of established 
efficacy,  the  applicant  submitted  detailed  grounds  for  the  re-examination  of  the  grounds  for 
refusal.  
Detailed grounds for re-examination submitted by the applicant 
The  applicant  presented  their  detailed  grounds  for  re-examination  in  writing  and  at  an  oral 
explanation. 
A summary of the applicant´s grounds for re-examination is presented below. 
The  Applicant  requested  a  re-examination  of  the  CHMP  opinion  on  Translarna,  claiming  that 
substantial evidence is available for granting a conditional marketing authorisation in the following 
indication: 
“Translarna  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  Duchenne  muscular  dystrophy  resulting  from  a 
nonsense  mutation  in  the  dystrophin  gene,  in  ambulatory  patients  aged  5  years  and  older. 
Efficacy has not been demonstrated in non-ambulatory patients.

Page 81/101 
 
  
  
 
The  presence  of  a  nonsense  mutation  in  the  dystrophin  gene  should  be  determined  by  genetic 
testing.” 
Overall,  the  Applicant  was  of  the  view  that  ataluren  has  a  favourable  benefit-risk  profile  in 
nmDMD  patients,  which  is  a  population  suffering  from  a  fatal  disease  with  high  unmet  medical 
need, and maintained that criteria for a conditional marketing authorisation were fulfilled. 
Ground  1:  The  single  study  fails  to  demonstrate  persuasive  evidence  of  therapeutic  efficacy  of 
Translarna  in  terms  of  the  primary  endpoint  (6MWT)  and  further  efficacy  parameters  confirming 
functional  improvement  and  activities  of  daily  living.   Furthermore,  the  mechanism  of  action  and 
the  bell  shape  dose-response  relationship  of  Translarna  were  not  conclusively  established,  which 
adds further uncertainty on the overall robustness of the efficacy data.   
The applicant re-iterated that the ataluren phase 2b study (Study 007) was the first registration-
directed  trial  in  DMD.  The  lack  of  an  accepted  primary  endpoint  in  DMD  prior  to  the  conduct  of 
this study required that the company establish the 6MWT as the primary endpoint, as a result of 
which  the  6MWT  is  now  an  accepted  primary  outcome  measure  in  DMD  clinical  trials.  In  Study 
007, the 6MWD results met the MCID for 6MWD in DMD, demonstrating clinical meaningfulness in 
a  heterogeneous  population  (estimated  31.7  meters  6MWD  benefit  over  placebo,  in  the  cITT 
analysis  (post-hoc  analysis),  adjusted  p=0.056).  One  indication  of  the  robustness  of  the  results 
was  that  slowing  of  disease  progression  was  also  shown  in  the  pre-specified  analysis  of  time  to 
10%-worsening in 6MWD, in which only 26% of patients who received ataluren 10, 10, 20 mg/kg 
experienced disease progression, compared with 44% of the patients who received placebo. The 
applicant claimed that the difference between the ataluren 10, 10, 20 mg/kg treatment group and 
the placebo group was apparent as early as Week 24 in this analysis.  
The applicant highlighted that, given the role of dystrophin in stabilizing muscles and the natural 
history of ambulation based on the 6MWT, the effect of ataluren is most evident in patients who 
are in the ambulatory decline phase of the disease in a 48-week clinical trial. The eligibility criteria 
for the ongoing confirmatory Phase 3 study (study 020) were designed on this basis: age ≥7 and 
≤16 years; baseline 6MWD ≤80% of predicted for  age and height, (and, to enhance uniformity, 
on  corticosteroids,  and  baseline  6MWD  ≥150  meters).  Applying  these  criteria  to  the  Study  007 
population,  a  larger  ataluren  effect  in  6MWD  was  seen  in  this  “decline  phase”  subgroup  (49.9 
meters,  p=0.0096).  These  data  were  further  supported  by  the  results  in  patients  with  more 
advanced disease, with baseline 6MWD <350 meters, which indicated a difference for the primary 
outcome measure as well as trends favouring ataluren in the TFTs on the lower limb, wheelchair 
usage, and the HRQL patient-reported physical function domain.  
Furthermore,  the  robustness  of  the  6MWT  results  was  in  the  Applicant´s  view  supported  by  the 
positive trends seen in the key secondary endpoints, i.e. TFTs, that represent daily activities and 
also predict risk of loss of ambulation. As seen in the 6MWT, the trends in TFTs on the lower limb 
were larger in the subgroup enriched for the decline phase than in the overall study population. 
The  internal  consistency  of  the  6MWD  and  TFT  results  was  demonstrated  in  Monte  Carlo 
simulations, in which 10% of patients were randomly removed from each treatment arm, and the 
analysis  repeated 1000  separate  times.  The  Monte Carlo  analyses  and  other sensitivity  analyses 
(such  as  removal  of  best/worst  patients  and  the  randomization-based  ANCOVA  analysis) 
demonstrated that the results of the study were robust. 
Further  evidence  of  the  robustness  of  the  data  seen  was  constituted  by  the  positive  trends 
observed  in  other  secondary  endpoints,  which  pointed  in  the  same  direction  as  the  6MWT  and 
TFTs:  step  activity  monitoring,  wheelchair  use,  accidental  falls,  and  the  QOL  child  physical 
function domain. The results for wheelchair use and the QOL child physical function domain, like

the  6MWT  and  TFTs,  showed  larger  effect  sizes  in  the  subgroup  of  patients  in  the  ambulatory 
decline phase. The totality of the data was considered compelling by the Applicant when looking 
at the aggregately positive trends for ataluren vs placebo across outcome measures. With respect 
to muscle strength, the applicant pointed out that its measurement is not a relevant outcome for 
the  evaluation  of  a  dystrophin  restoration  therapy,  making  reference  to  studies  using  the  mdx 
mouse  which  indicated  that  dystrophin  levels  correlate  with  changes  in  muscle  function  but  not 
with muscle strength. 
In  terms  of  dystrophin  production,  positive  differences  in  dystrophin  expression  were  seen  in 
ataluren-treated patients in the Phase 2a study.  These data were considered by the Applicant to 
support the bell-shaped dose response since the majority of patients had plasma concentrations 
less  than  20  µg/ml.    The  Applicant  acknowledged  that  those  results  were  not  replicated  in  the 
Study  007,  giving  a  variety  of  reasons,  including  biopsy  sample  issues,  technical  problems,  and 
shipping and handling-introduced artefacts.  Of note, despite considerable technical limitations in 
the Phase 2b study, the largest %-increase in dystrophin and the largest number of patients who 
exceeded  the  value  of  40%  increase  were  in  the  10,  10,  20  mg/kg  group, compared  to  the  20, 
20,  40  mg/kg  and  placebo  groups.    To  put  the  limited  evidence  into  perspective,  the  Applicant 
made  reference  to  the  EMA  draft  guideline  [EMA  2013],  specifically  to  sections  recognising  that 
dystrophin is not a validated biomarker and may provide only complementary information during 
diagnosis,  and  the  fact  that  muscle  biopsies  are  debatable  regarding  the  robustness  and  the 
precise quantification of extremely low levels of dystrophin. 
The  published  in  vivo  demonstration  of  ataluren’s  readthrough  ability  was  considered  by  the 
Applicant  to  be  corroborated  by  the  efficacy  of  ataluren  in  both  the  mdx  mouse  and  zebrafish 
model  of  nmDMD.    Furthermore,  the  Applicant  documented  that  ataluren’s  readthrough  activity 
was thoroughly verified by a number of independent investigators in other disease models (Hurler 
syndrome, cystic fibrosis). 
With  respect  to  the  bell-shaped  dose  response,  several  lines  of  evidence  were  submitted  by  the 
Applicant  in  its  support,  including  observations  of  a  bell  shaped  response  in muscle  cell  cultures 
from mdx mice and nmDMD patients, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) of nmHurler mice and 
in  a  zebrafish  nmDMD  model  in vivo  (sapje  mutant).    In  addition,  the  Applicant  pointed  at 
similarities  between  the  ribosomal  binding  mechanism  of  ataluren  and  aminoglycosides,  which 
also show a bell-shaped response, highlighting that the dose-response relationship is not caused 
by  adverse  effects  of  ataluren.    Furthermore,  the  bell-shaped  dose-response  curve  observed  in 
concentration-based analyses of ataluren in the clinical studies was presented as consistent with 
the  bell-shaped  dose-response  hypothesis.  In  particular,  the  Applicant  presented  additional 
analyses  based  on  C0h  (fig.  17)  documenting  that  the  same  trend  is  observed  as  within  the 
analyses based on C2h, i.e. higher efficacy in patients with lower concentrations.

Fig. 17 Inverse concentration response – C0h data from study 007 
In terms of safety, ataluren was generally well-tolerated by patients with nmDMD at the proposed 
recommended dose of 10, 10, 20 mg/kg, as well as at the higher dose of 20, 20, 40 mg/kg, when 
taken daily for 48 weeks in the Phase 2b Study 007.  The adverse event profile of ataluren was 
comparable  to  that  of  placebo.    Most  adverse  events  were  mild  or  moderate,  transient,  and  did 
not require medical intervention.  None of the patients discontinued treatment because of adverse 
events.  Few serious adverse events were reported, none was considered related to ataluren, and 
no  deaths  occurred.  Of  note,  an  observational  registry  study  was  proposed  by  the  Applicant  to 
collect additional long-term safety data. 
Ground  2:  The  Applicant  has  not  convincingly  shown  that  comprehensive  data  can  be  obtained 
from  the  confirmatory  placebo-controlled  trial  if  the  product  is  authorised  and  available  on  the 
market. 
With  regard  to  the  completion  of  the  Phase  3  confirmatory  trial  PTC124-GD-020-DMD  (Study 
020),  the  Applicant  stated  that  as  of  20  March  2014,  48  study  sites  were  activated,  with  163 
patients screened and 125 patients randomized. The Applicant committed to completing the study 
in  a  timely  manner,  allowing  availability  of  results  in  3Q  2015.  Based  on  the  advanced  state  of 
study  enrolment  and  a  careful  analysis  of  when  market  access  to  commercial  drug  would  likely 
occur  in  the  concerned  EU  member  states,  the  Applicant  was  of  the  view  that  only  a  very  small 
number  of  patients  would  be  at  risk  of  withdrawing,  and  maintained  that  the  granting  of  the 
conditional  marketing  authorisation  should  not  jeopardize  the  completion  or  integrity  of  this 
critical  study.  In  this  context,  the  Applicant  referred  to  support  from  DMD  patient  advocacy 
groups, existing patient-physician relationships and the option of continuing in a separate open-
label  extension  study  as  tools  encouraging  patients  to  complete  the  confirmatory  trial. 
Furthermore, the Applicant argued that the study 020 sample size was sufficiently large to allow 
high  integrity  of  conclusions  even  if  some  premature  patient  discontinuations  should  occur  and 
also  flagged  that  their  successful  completion  of  the  study  020  was  critical  in  order  to  pursue 
approval in other regions.

Overall CHMP conclusion on grounds for re-examination  
The CHMP assessed all the detailed grounds for re-examination and argumentations presented by 
the  applicant  in  writing  and  in  the  oral  explanation  and  considered  the  views  expressed  by  the 
Scientific Advisory Group in the initial phase of the procedure.  
Ground 1 
Following  review  of  the  non-clinical  evidence  available,  the  CHMP  considered  that  effective 
promotion of translation across premature nonsense stop codons was documented in various cell 
culture systems as well as in vivo. In particular, the effects of ataluren observed in the zebrafish 
sapje mutant and in the different genetic mouse models in vivo were considered of relevance in 
terms of the mechanism of action claimed. With respect to the conflicting nature of some of the 
results that was pointed out in the initial phase, the CHMP acknowledged that it may be attributed 
to  methodological  differences  of  the  respective  assays.  Overall,  the  mechanism  of  action  of 
ataluren  (nonsense  mutation  readthrough)  was  considered  plausible.  Furthermore,  the  CHMP 
noted  that  the  maximum  activity  of  ataluren  in  the  non-clinical  setting  was  mostly  observed  at 
concentrations  overlapping  with  the  efficacious  plasma  levels  of  ataluren  in  the  clinical  studies 
004 and 007, i.e.  < 20 μg/ml. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  activity  of  ataluren  in  cultures  of  myotubes  from  mdx  mice  and 
nmDMD patients or MEFs of nmHurler mice in vitro and in mutant zebrafish larvae in vivo followed 
a bell-shaped dose-response curve. In addition, results in nmHurler mice showed an inverse dose-
response  relationship  with  the  lowest  dose  being  most  effective,  which  was  also  indicative  of  the 
above  hypothesis  of  a  bell  shape.  While  some  of  the  previous  uncertainties  related  to  the  lack  of 
verification  of  the  findings  by  additional  non-clinical  in  vivo  data  were  maintained,  overall,  the 
CHMP concluded that the bell-shaped dose-response could be considered implied by investigations 
of  ataluren’s  activity  in vitro  and  supported  by  data  from  in vivo  study  in  sapje  mutant  zebrafish, 
which constitutes a valuable complement to disease models in mammals. 
With  respect  to  clinical  evidence  of  the  bell-shaped  dose  response  hypothesis,  specific  attention 
was paid by the CHMP to the re-analyses of the treatment response in correlation to human plasma 
concentrations of ataluren. The cut off value of < 19.3 μg/ml used for categorization of patients in 
low/high plasma level subjects was considered justified, as it was based on the range of C2h seen 
in  the  low  dose  group  (10,  10,  20 mg/kg).  The  results  of  this  analysis  indicated  that  patients  in 
study 007  who had lower plasma ataluren concentrations (< 19.3 μg/ml) experienced less decline 
in 6MWT than patients who had higher plasma ataluren concentrations. Furthermore, in their oral 
explanation  the  Applicant  presented  additional  analysis  based  on  C0h  values  of  plasma 
concentration of ataluren, i.e. a parameter which approximately reflects the trough concentration. 
Importantly,  when  looking  at  the  efficacy  by  concentration,  similarly  to  the  observation  based  on 
the  C2h  data,  patients  with  low  concentrations  of  ataluren  performed  better  than  those  with  high 
concentration (both in terms of 6MWD and a across TFTs). Of note, the magnitude of the effect size 
observed in patients with lower plasma concentration on the high dose and the one observed in the 
patients on the low dose was similar in both instances, i.e. in the analyses based on C0h and C2h 
data. This evidence was considered to provide support to the bell-shaped dose-response hypothesis 
from the clinical point of view.  
Overall,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  view  that  the  bell-shaped  dose  response  hypothesis  was  plausible 
and that despite some limitations of the findings, the available evidence could provide a rationale 
for the observed differences in efficacy between the two doses tested, i.e. higher efficacy seen in 
the 10, 10, 20 mg/kg dose and minimal efficacy in the 20, 20, 40 mg/kg dose.

In light of the revised position of the CHMP on the mechanism of action and the bell-shaped dose-
response hypothesis, which were both parts of the initial grounds for refusal, the CHMP looked into 
the available clinical efficacy data. 
The  CHMP  maintained  their  initial  position  that  there  were  limitations  of  the  dataset  in  terms  of 
robustness, namely the observation of the variability of the primary efficacy data and the fact that 
many  of  the  conclusions  supporting  efficacy  were  derived  from  the  post  hoc  analyses.  However, 
taking  into  account  that  the  mechanistic  concerns  and  concerns  pertaining  to  the  dose-response 
were alleviated during the re-examination, as discussed above, the CHMP was of the view that the 
observed results could reflect a true effect. This was considered to adequately reduce the concern 
expressed  during  the  initial  phase,  i.e.  that  the  observed  effects  could  be  only  chance  findings. 
With respect to the magnitude and clinical relevance of the observed effects, the CHMP referred to 
their  previous  position,  i.e.  that  there  were  several  lines  of  evidence  supporting  the  clinical 
relevance of a 30-meter difference in 6MWT, including a report showing that a 30-meter change in 
6MWD  over  48  weeks  can  be  considered  a  clinically  meaningful  change  based  on  the 
patient/parent-reported  quality  of  life  measures  in  DMD  patients.  This  was  also  supported  by 
results  of  natural  history  data  in  DMD,  indicating  that  30-meter  decrease  in  baseline  6MWD 
significantly increases the risk of loss of ambulation over the following 2 years.  
As in the initial phase of the MAA review, the CHMP discussed the appropriate target population for 
the  use  of  ataluren.  Considering  that  the  beneficial  effects  were  most  prominent  in  a  sub-
population  of  ambulatory  patients  in  the  decline  phase  of  their  walking  ability  (effect  size  of 
approximately 50 metres on the 6MWD), the CHMP discussed whether this finding would imply the 
need  for  restricting  the  indication  to  a  population  defined  accordingly,  i.e.  patients  in  ambulatory 
decline  phase.  In  line  with  the  previous  position  of  the  SAG,  the  CHMP  agreed  that  scientifically 
there  should  be  no  reason  for  the  drug  not  to  be  given  to  milder  patients  if  efficacy  had  been 
established  in  more  severe  ones.  Furthermore,  the CHMP  considered  that  while  less  prominent,  a 
clinically  meaningful  effect  was  seen  also  in  the  overall  population  studied.  Thus,  the  CHMP 
concluded  that  ataluren  can  be  authorised  in  the  indication  that  the  company  claimed  in  the  re-
examination: 
“Translarna  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  Duchenne  muscular  dystrophy  resulting  from  a 
nonsense  mutation  in  the  dystrophin  gene,  in  ambulatory  patients  aged  5  years  and  older. 
Efficacy has not been demonstrated in non-ambulatory patients. 
The  presence  of  a  nonsense  mutation  in  the  dystrophin  gene  should  be  determined  by  genetic 
testing.” 
Of note, the indication initially applied for, covering also non-ambulatory patients was not pursued 
by  the  Applicant  in  their  Grounds  for  re-examination.  This  was  considered  appropriate  by  the 
CHMP, since ataluren was evaluated only in ambulatory patients.  
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  ground  for  refusal  No.  1  was  resolved with  a  specific  obligation  to 
conduct the confirmatory clinical trial 020. The results of this trial were expected to further reduce 
the uncertainties about benefits and support the favourable benefit-risk balance. 
Ground 2 
The  CHMP  reviewed  the  Applicant´s  discussion  about  the  feasibility  of  the  confirmatory  trial, 
including the progress on recruitment, expected timelines and actions proposed to minimise patient 
withdrawals  and  to  ensure  successful  completion  of  the  trial.  Based  on  the  assumptions  made  by 
the  Applicant,  the  CHMP  agreed  that  conducting  the  confirmatory  study  020  and  submitting  the 
final  study  results  by  4Q  2015  could  be  feasible  independently  of  the  status  of  approval.  In

particular,  the  CHMP  took  into  consideration  the  additional  tools  presented  by  the  Applicant  to 
ensure  that  patients  complete  the  confirmatory  trial.  These  included  existing  patient-physician 
relationships,  the  option  of  continuing  participation  in  a  separate  open-label  extension  study  and 
also  support  from  DMD  patient  advocacy  groups  which  will  be  leveraged  by  the  Applicant  to 
conduct outreach programmes for patients, emphasising the importance of remaining in study 020 
through  its  completion.  Furthermore,  the  CHMP  considered  that  a  protocol  amendment  will  be 
implemented by the Applicant allowing for additional recruitment, replacing patients who withdraw 
from the study for reasons linked to the availability of the product on the market. 
The  CHMP  concluded  that  the  strategy  of  the  Applicant  was  re-assuring  and  considered  that  the 
ground for refusal No. 2 was resolved. 
Overall conclusion 
The  Applicant  applied  for  a  conditional  marketing  authorisation  with  the  proposal  that  additional 
data  would  be  generated  post-authorisation  in  the  confirmatory  phase  3  study  (020).  Therefore, 
the  CHMP  also  re-discussed  the  criteria  that  would  need  to  be  met  for  a  conditional  approval 
according  to  Articles  2  and  4  of  the  Regulation  (EC)  no  507/2006,  and  made  the  following 
conclusions upon re-examination of the initial CHMP Opinion: 
• 
DMD  is  a  life-threatening  and  chronically  debilitating  condition  where  no  satisfactory 
methods  of  treatment  exist  and  it  was  considered  that  the  product  would  thus  address  an  unmet 
medical need. 
• 
Upon  review  of  the  Applicant´s  grounds  for  re-examination,  the  CHMP  considered  that 
despite  the  uncertainties  discussed  above  and  the  fact  that  the  dataset  was  not  comprehensive, 
sufficient  efficacy  was  seen  to  conclude  on  a  favourable  benefit-risk  balance.  Of  note,  this 
conclusion was to a great extent supported by the safety profile of ataluren, which does not pose 
any major safety concerns.  
• 
The  criterion  that  the  benefits  to  public  health  of  the  immediate  availability  outweigh  the 
risks  inherent  in  the  fact  that  additional  data  are  still  required  was  considered  fulfilled  since  the 
benefits  to  public  health  were  substantiated  by  providing  a  treatment  for  a  serious  disease, 
characterised by gradual deterioration of the condition and a fatal outcome. 
• 
With  respect  to  generating  additional  data  post  authorisation,  the  CHMP  considered  that 
the Applicant will complete a confirmatory randomized placebo-controlled Phase 3 study PTC124-
GD-020-DMD  (Study  020)  with  the  10,  10,  20  mg/kg/day  dose  in  patients  with  nmDMD.  The 
CHMP  agreed  that  this  clinical  trial  may  provide  data  alleviating  the  current  uncertainties  and 
acknowledged the timelines planned for its conduct and submission of its results (4Q 2015). With 
respect  to  the  study  feasibility,  the  position  of  the  CHMP  changed  at  the  time  of  the  re-
examination  Opinion;  specifically,  the  CHMP  considered  that  performing  the  study  was  plausible 
per se, independent of the marketing authorisation status, as discussed above.  
A favourable benefit-risk balance was established based on the data available at the time of this 
MAA and the CHMP concluded that the confirmatory evidence from study 020 was acceptable to 
be generated post authorisation.

4.1.  Risk Management Plan 
At  the  end  of  the  initial  procedure,  the  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the 
application was of the opinion that it was not appropriate to consider pharmacovigilance activities 
and risk minimisation measures. 
During  the  re-examination  procedure,  the  Applicant  addressed  the  open  issues  described  in  the 
PRAC RMP assessment dated 03 December 2013. A review of the Applicant’s responses and of the 
updated RMP (submitted as part of the re-examination file) concluded that the RMP in the proposed 
treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, resulting from a nonsense mutation in the dystrophin 
gene (nmDMD) in ambulatory patients aged 5 years and older, could be acceptable provided that 
an updated risk management plan is submitted before final CHMP opinion, addressing the following 
issues: 
1.  Hepatic toxicity should be included as an important potential risk; 
2.  The  summary  table  of  risk  minimisation  measures  should  be  edited  to  reflect  the  routine 
risk minimisation measures planned for each safety concern (e.g. SmPC); 
3.  Amendments are needed in the proposed SmPC to ensure accurate communication on the 
monitoring requirements.  
Of note, as requested by the PRAC during the initial phase of the MAA procedure, the PASS study 
‘Long-Term Observational Study of Ataluren Safety and Effectiveness in Usual Care’ was classified 
by the Applicant as a category 1 study. With respect to the scope of this PASS study, following a 
review  of  the  Applicant´s responses, it  was  concluded  that  it  had  been  satisfactorily  expanded  to 
obtain additional information on the long-term effectiveness of ataluren. 
The Applicant addressed the above issues and produced an RMP based on the following content:

Aminoglycosides 
Aminoglycosides have been shown to reduce the 
readthrough activity of ataluren in vitro. In addition, 
ataluren was found to increase nephrotoxicity of 
intravenous aminoglycosides. The co-administration of 
these medicinal products with ataluren should be 
avoided (see section 4.3).  Since the mechanism by 
which ataluren increases nephrotoxicity of intravenous 
aminoglycosides is not known, concomitant use of other 
nephrotoxic medicinal products with ataluren is not 
recommended.  If this is unavoidable (e.g. vancomycin 
to treat MRSA) careful monitoring of renal function is 
advised (see section 4.5) 
SmPC section 4.5 (Interaction with other 
medicinal products and other forms of interaction) 
Aminoglycosides 
Ataluren should not be co-administered with 
intravenous aminoglycosides, based on cases of 
decreased renal function observed in a clinical trial in 
patients with nonsense mutation cystic fibrosis (nmCF) 
(see section 4.3).  
Elevations of serum creatinine occurred in several nmCF 
patients treated with ataluren and intravenous 
aminoglycosides together with other antibiotics for 
cystic fibrosis exacerbations.  The serum creatinine 
elevations resolved in all cases, with discontinuation of 
the intravenous aminoglycoside, and either continuation 
or interruption of Translarna .  These findings suggested 
that co-administration of Translarna and intravenous 
aminoglycosides may potentiate the nephrotoxic effect 
of the aminoglycosides.  Therefore, if treatment with 
intravenous aminoglycosides is necessary the treatment  
with Translarna should be stopped and can be resumed 
2 days after administration of the aminoglycoside has 
ended.  The effect of co-administration of ataluren with 
other nephrotoxic medicinal products is unknown. 
Dehydration may be a contributing factor in some of 
these cases.  Patients should maintain adequate 
hydration while taking ataluren (see section 4.4).

Changes in lipid profile 
Because changes in lipid profile (increased 
triglycerides and cholesterol) were reported for some 
patients in clinical trials, it is recommended that total 
cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides be monitored 
on an annual basis in nmDMD patients receiving 
ataluren, or more frequently as needed based on the 
patient’s clinical status.

Serum lipids 
During the controlled study of nmDMD, mean total 
cholesterol and triglycerides were normal at baseline 
and increased, reaching borderline high or high values. 
The values tended to stabilize early in the study and did 
not increase further with continued treatment. 
SmPC section 4.4 Special warnings and

Hypertension with use of concomitant systemic 
corticosteroids 
Because hypertension with use of concomitant 
systemic corticosteroids was reported in some 
patients in clinical trials, it is recommended that 
resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure be 
monitored every 6 months in nmDMD patients 
receiving ataluren concomitantly with corticosteriods, 
or more frequently as needed based on the patient’s 
clinical status.

SmPC section 4.5 (Interaction with other

Effect of other medicinal products on ataluren 
pharmacokinetics 
Based on in vitro studies, ataluren is a substrate of 
UGT1A9 and breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP).  
Caution should be exercised when ataluren is co-
administered with medicinal products  that are inducers 
of UGT1A9 (e.g. mycophenolate mofetil), or inhibitors of 
BCRP (e.g. ciclosporin). 
Effect of ataluren on pharmacokinetics of other 
medicinal products 
Based on in vitro studies, ataluren is an inhibitor of 
UGT1A9, organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1), organic 
anion transporter 3 (OAT3) and organic anion 
transporting polypeptide 1B3 (OATP1B3).  Caution 
should be exercised when ataluren is co-administered 
with drugs that are substrates of UGT1A9, OAT1, OAT3, 
or OATP1B3  because of the risk of increase 
concentration of these medicinal products (eg, 
oseltamivir, aciclovir, ciprofloxacin, captopril, 
furosemide, bumetanide, valsartan, pravastatin, 
rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, pitavastatin). 
Based on the in vitro studies, ataluren is not expected 
to be an inhibitor of neither p-gp mediated transport nor 
of cytochrome P450 mediated metabolism.  Similarly, 
ataluren is not expected in vivo to be an inducer of 
cytochrome P450 isoenzymes.  
The CHMP endorsed the PRAC advice with changes. 
These changes concerned the following elements of the Risk Management Plan: 
The CHMP considered that the PASS study ‘Long-Term Observational Study of Ataluren Safety and 
Effectiveness  in  Usual  Care’  should  be  classified  as  a  category  3  study,  rather  than  a  category  1 
study. 
The CHMP justified these changes as follows: 
The CHMP considered that the scope of this observational study is to look into the long-term safety 
and  effectiveness  of  ataluren,  rather  than  to  focus  on  a  specific  issue  key  to  the  benefit-risk 
balance of ataluren.

5.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Ataluren  is  a  first-in-class  drug  designed  to  enable  ribosomal  readthrough  of  premature  stop 
codons,  resulting  in  the  formation  of  a  full-length  functional  protein  in  patients  with  nonsense 
mutation  genetic  disorders.  In  the  proof  of  concept  study  in  mdx  mice  ataluren  was  seen  to 
promote formation and adequate localization of dystrophin, resulting in increased muscle strength 
and prevention of loss of strength following repeated contractions. 
In  the  clinical  setting,  beneficial  effects  of  the  lower  dose  (10,  10,  20  mg/kg)  were  claimed  in 
both primary and secondary endpoints of physical functioning.  
With  respect  to  6MWD,  ataluren  was  observed  to  slow  disease  progression  in  nmDMD  patients. 
The  post-hoc  analysis  in  the  cITT  population  indicated  an  estimated  difference  in  the  Change  in 
6MWD at Week 48 of 31.7 metres (nominal p=0.0281, adjusted p=0.0561) between the 10, 10, 
20 mg/kg dose and placebo. Looking at the proportions of patients with at least 10% worsening in 
6MWD  at  Week  48,  44%  vs  26%  of  patients  in  the  placebo  and  the  10,  10,  20  mg/kg  ataluren 
arm, respectively were progressors (nominal p=0.0326, adjusted p=0.0652) .  
A  greater  effect  over  48  weeks  was  seen  in  patients  in  the  “ambulatory  decline”  phase,  i.e. 
patients  between  7  and  16  years  of  age,  with  baseline  6MWD  ≥150m  and  ≤80%  of  predicted 
value.  Based  on  a  post-hoc  subgroup  analysis  in  this  population,  a  difference  in  the  change  in 
6MWD at Week 48 of 49.9 metres (p=0.0096) between the 10, 10, 20 mg/kg dose and placebo 
was seen. 
In  terms  of  secondary  endpoints  of  physical  functioning,  only  limited  effects  of  ataluren  were 
observed:  ataluren  patients  had  fewer  falls/week  than  placebo-dosed  patients;  increase  of 
wheelchair use from baseline was less in ataluren than placebo; ataluren patients spent less time 
in  “no  activity”  (based  on  Step  activity  monitoring)  and  a  minor  positive  trend  was  observed  in 
myometry tests. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The  CHMP  was  of  the  view  that  the  main  uncertainties  about  the  claimed  beneficial  effects 
pertained  to  the  dose-response  curve  (and  hence  the  appropriate  dose),  the  robustness  of 
efficacy  data  in  general  and  the  applicability  of  the  data  to  the  overall  population  of  nmDMD 
patients. 
Uncertainties about the dose-response curve and dose 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  activity  of  ataluren  in  cultures  of  myotubes  from  mdx  mice  and 
nmDMD patients or MEFs of nmHurler mice in vitro and in mutant zebrafish larvae in vivo followed 
a bell-shaped dose-response curve. In addition, results in nmHurler mice showed an inverse dose-
response  relationship  with  the  lowest  dose  being  most  effective,  which  was  also  indicative  of  the 
above  hypothesis  of  a  bell-shape  dose-response.  While  some  of  the  uncertainties  related  to  the 
lack of verification of the findings by additional non-clinical in vivo data were maintained, overall, 
the  CHMP  concluded  that  the  bell-shaped  dose-response  could  be  considered  implied  by 
investigations  of  ataluren’s  activity  in vitro  and  supported  by  data  from  in vivo  study  in  sapje 
mutant zebrafish, which constitutes a valuable complement to disease models in mammals.

With  respect  to  clinical  evidence  of  the  bell-shaped  dose  response  hypothesis,  specific  attention 
was paid by the CHMP to the re-analyses of the treatment response in correlation to human plasma 
concentrations of ataluren. The cut off value of < 19.3 μg/ml used for categorization of patients in 
low/high plasma level subjects was considered justified, as it was based on the range of C2h seen 
in  the  low  dose  group  (10,  10,  20 mg/kg).  The  results  of  this  analysis  indicated  that  patients  in 
study 007  who had lower plasma ataluren concentrations (< 19.3 μg/ml) experienced less decline 
in 6MWT than patients who had higher plasma ataluren concentrations. Furthermore, in their oral 
explanation  the  Applicant  presented  additional  analysis  based  on  C0h  values  of  plasma 
concentration of ataluren, i.e. a parameter which approximately reflects the trough concentration. 
Importantly,  when  looking  at  the  efficacy  by  concentration,  similarly  to  the  observation  based  on 
the  C2h  data,  patients  with  low  concentrations  of  ataluren  performed  better  than  those  with  high 
concentration (both in terms of 6MWD and a across TFTs). Of note, the magnitude of the effect size 
observed in patients with lower plasma concentration on the high dose and the one observed in the 
patients on the low dose was similar in both instances, i.e. in the analyses based on C0h and C2h 
data. This evidence was considered to provide support to the bell-shaped dose-response hypothesis 
from the clinical point of view.  
Uncertainties about robustness of efficacy data 
The  CHMP  was  of  the  view  that  there  were  limitations  of  the  dataset  in  terms  of  robustness, 
namely the observation of the variability of the primary efficacy data and the fact that many of the 
conclusions  supporting  efficacy  were  derived  from  the  post  hoc  analyses.  However,  taking  into 
account  that  the  mechanistic  concerns  and  concerns  pertaining  to  the  dose-response  were 
alleviated  during  the  re-examination,  as  discussed  above,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  the  observed 
results could reflect a true effect. This was considered adequate to reduce the concern expressed 
during the initial phase, i.e. that the observed effects could be only chance findings.  
The  CHMP  was  of  the  view  that  the  results  on  the  secondary  endpoints  provided  only  limited 
support for the primary endpoint outcomes and needed to be seen only as trends. Nevertheless, in 
line  with  the  previous  input  from  the  SAG,  the  CHMP  acknowledged  that  most  of  the  secondary 
endpoints were of such nature that any effect would have to be driven by an increase in strength 
and for this to occur, higher levels of dystrophin in muscular fibres would have to be achieved. 
Pharmacodynamic confirmation of efficacy was not provided by the pivotal study, despite the fact 
that  biopsies  were  collected.  While  the  technical  problems  with  dystrophin  quantification  were 
recognised by the CHMP, the quality of the biopsies supplied was of concern.  The GCP inspection 
identified that several steps were underestimated, namely instructions for performing the muscle 
biopsies and the storage/ shipping logistics. Since the mechanism of action of ataluren is claimed 
to be by promoting production of a full-length dystrophin, more prominent evidence of dystrophin 
in muscle of patients treated for 48 weeks would be expected. Considering the limitations of data 
on clinical efficacy, the CHMP pointed out that the dossier would have benefited from supportive 
data on pharmacodynamics.  
With  respect  to  the  actual  mechanism  of  restoring  dystrophin  production,  the  CHMP  considered 
that  promotion  of  the  translation  process  at  the  ribosomal  level  was  plausible,  despite  the  fact 
that positive results were not seen in all assays reported. 
Validity of data for the entire nmDMD patient population 
Of note, the indication initially applied for, covering also non-ambulatory patients was not pursued 
by  the  Applicant  in  their  Grounds  for  re-examination.  This  was  considered  appropriate  by  the 
CHMP, since ataluren was evaluated only in ambulatory patients.

Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Ataluren  was  generally  well  tolerated  by  patients  with  nmDMD,  with  the  most  common  adverse 
events  being  headache  and  gastrointestinal  disorders  such  as  nausea,  vomiting,  (upper) 
abdominal pain, flatulence, diarrhoea, stomach discomfort, constipation and regurgitation. 
The  laboratory  data  indicated  that  exposure  to  ataluren  could  cause  elevation  of  serum 
cholesterol and triglycerides. Mean cholesterol and triglycerides levels were in the upper range of 
normal at baseline and increased to borderline-high or high levels in the ataluren arms, primarily 
in  patients  who  were  receiving  corticosteroids.  The  values  tended  to  stabilize  early  and  did  not 
increase  further  with  continued  treatment.  “Changes  in  the  lipid  profile”  were  considered  as  an 
important identified risk in the proposed Risk Management Plan. 
Of note, elevations of serum creatinine occurred in several patients with nonsense mutation cystic 
fibrosis  treated  concomitantly  with  intravenous  aminoglycosides.  In  all  cases,  the  elevations 
resolved with discontinuation of the aminoglycosides indicating that co-administration of ataluren 
and  intravenous  aminoglycosides  may  potentiate  the  nephrotoxic  effect  of  the  aminoglycosides. 
Based on this evidence of decreased renal function, “potentiation of aminoglycoside renal toxicity” 
was determined as an important identified risk.  
There  were  no  deaths  during  the  placebo  controlled  study.  Three  fatal  cases  were  seen  in  one 
open-label study, but the fatal outcomes were not considered related to treatment with ataluren.   
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
From the non-clinical database, the finding of malignant hibernomas in rat raised the concern as 
to  whether  occurrence  of  similar  effects  could  be  expected  in  humans,  particularly  in  the 
paediatric population where the quantity of the brown adipose tissue is higher. In particular, the 
CHMP  considered  that  malignant  hibernomas  could  be  related  to  the  effects  of  ataluren  on  fat 
tissue metabolism and to effects on plasma lipid parameters, which were observed in rats, dogs 
and  humans.  Thus,  “hibernomas”  were  reflected  in  the  proposed  risk  management  plan  of 
ataluren as an important potential risk. 
Considering  the  mechanism  of  action  of  ataluren,  the  CHMP  pointed  out  a  theoretical  concern 
about  possible  effects  of  ataluren  on  reading  through  normal  stop  codons  (and  thus  producing 
abnormally elongated proteins) and a concern that ataluren could enhance read through of non-
sense  mutations  in  other  genes.  Although  such  effects  were  not  seen  in  the  data  available,  the 
CHMP was of the view that the potential off-target effects were an uncertainty about the risks of 
ataluren.  
Based on results of in vitro studies, ataluren was expected to have an interaction potential, which 
the  CHMP  considered  necessary  to  be  explored  further  in  vivo.  This  pertained  to  ataluren 
interactions  with  a  BCRP  inhibitor,  UGT1A9  substrate,  OAT1,  OAT3  and  OATP1B3  substrates  and 
UGT1A9 selective inducer. 
Increase  in  blood  pressure  including  cases  of  hypertension  requiring  antihypertensive  treatment 
was  observed  in  subjects  treated  with  ataluren.  While  this  could  have  been  due  to  the  use  of 
corticosteroids administered concomitantly, this issue was considered an uncertainty and captured 
as a potential risk in the proposed Risk Management Plan. 
The  preclinical  data  as  well  as  data  from  healthy  volunteers  and  DMD  patients  indicated  that

exposure to ataluren may lead to increase in transaminases. While these changes seemed to be 
reversible  after  exposure  to  ataluren  was  stopped  and  a  clear  hepatotoxic  effect  was  not 
confirmed, the CHMP considered hepatotoxicity as an important potential risk. 
The  nmCF  study  data  suggested  an  effect  of  ataluren  on  renal  abnormalities.  Although  the 
mechanism of a potential contribution of ataluren to the reported cases of nephrotoxicity was not 
known, this signal in the clinical development appeared to reinforce the non-clinical findings seen 
in  mice.  Based  on  the  clinical  data  available,  renal  toxicity  was  assumed  to  occur  less  likely  in 
DMD  patients,  but  was  still  perceived  as  a  potential  important  risk.  Of  note, data  from  a  clinical 
trial  investigating  ataluren  in  cystic  fibrosis  were  published  at  the  time  of  the  re-examination 
CHMP  Opinion  (May  2014).  Upon  request  of  the  CHMP,  these  results  were  discussed  by  the 
Applicant  in  their  oral  explanation.  In  their  conclusions,  the  CHMP  highlighted  that  while  the 
evidence  did  not  indicate  increased  risk  for  the  DMD  population,  as  a  precautionary  measure, 
additional wording should be implemented in the Product Information to discourage concomitant 
use of ataluren and nephrotoxic medicinal products. 
Treatment  of  patients  with  renal  or  hepatic  impairment  is  another  area  of  uncertainty,  as  no 
specific  studies  were  performed  and  potential  safety  concerns  are 
implied  by 
the 
pharmacokinetics of ataluren. Since renal excretion accounts for ~ 50% of the drug elimination, 
renal  impairment  is  likely  to  result  in  accumulation  of  ataluren  and/or  ataluren  glucuronide. 
Similarly,  since  ataluren  is  extensively  metabolized  in  liver,  hepatic  impairment  is  expected  to 
result in ataluren increased plasma concentrations. Taken together with the uncertainties around 
the  claimed  bell-shaped  dose-response  curve,  the  CHMP  considered  that  without  clinical  data, 
understanding  of  both  efficacy  and  safety  profile  of  ataluren  in  subjects  with  renal  or  hepatic 
impairment remains limited. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Several  lines  of  evidence  support  the  clinical  relevance  of  a  30-meter  difference  in  6MWT, 
including a report3 showing that a 30-meter change in 6MWD over 48 weeks can be considered a 
clinically meaningful change based on the patient/parent-reported quality of life measures in DMD 
patients.  This  is  also  supported  by  results  of  longitudinal  LMWT  natural  history  data  in  DMD, 
indicating  that  each  30-meter  decrease  in  baseline  6MWD  predicts  increasing  risk  of  loss  of 
ambulation over the following 2 years. 
Ability to climb and descend a short grouping of stairs, ability to run in short bursts, or to walk a 
short distance unaided, e.g. to a bathroom, reflect the typical activities important in the lives of 
DMD  patients.  Importantly,  recent  data  indicated  that  timed  function  tests  evaluating  these 
abilities  are,  similarly  to  6MWT,  predictive  of  the  time  for  a  patient  to  become  non-ambulatory. 
Natural  history  data  from  the  Cooperative  International  Neuromuscular  Group  indicated  that 
changes  in  these  parameters  are  predictive  of  the  likelihood  of  loss  of  ambulation  over  1  year. 
Falls commonly lead to fractures in DMD patients and the injuries sustained may accelerate loss 
of  ambulation.  Decreasing  the  rate  of  accidental  falls  and  hence  the  risk  of  fractures,  pain  and

other  trauma  would  be  of  benefit  to  the  patients.  With  respect  to  decrease  in  wheel  chair  use, 
benefits  can  be  attributed  not  only  in  terms  of  ambulation  itself,  but  also  by  positive  impact  on 
the  respiratory  function  and  minimisation  of  scoliosis.  Thus,  if  sufficiently  documented  these 
effects would be considered of high importance. 
The  most  commonly  reported  treatment-related  adverse  events  vomiting,  diarrhoea,  abdominal 
pain  upper,  flatulence,  nausea,  headache  and  decreased  appetite  were  not  considered  to  raise 
major safety concerns in a seriously debilitating and life-threatening condition such as DMD. 
The  effect  of  ataluren  on  the  lipid  profile  (cholesterol  and  triglyceride  levels)  was  considered  of 
importance,  especially  in  a  situation  where  long-term  administration  of  corticosteroids  is 
expected.  Nevertheless,  the  values  tended  to  stabilize  early  in  the  study  and  did  not  increase 
further  with  continued  treatment,  which  was  considered  re-assuring.  Similarly,  the  risk  of 
hypertension during concomitant use of corticosteroids and ataluren was seen as of importance to 
the  target  population,  considering  that  such  co-administration  would  occur  in  the  majority  of 
patients in the clinical practice. 
In the context of the age group targeted, the potential risk of hibernoma was considered relevant, 
due to higher proportion of brown fat tissue in children. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The CHMP considered that the data presented in the dossier had some deficiencies which impacted 
on the benefit-risk assessment. In particular, the Applicant conducted only a single pivotal trial and 
with  the  formal  failure  of  its  primary  analysis,  the  efficacy  discussion  was  based  on  post  hoc 
analyses.  It  was  agreed  that  these  analyses  were  performed  in  line  with  the  most  current 
knowledge about the natural history of the disease (gained during the conduct of study 007), and 
in  this  respect  the  definition  of  the  subgroups  in  these  analyses  was  clinically  and  scientifically 
justified  (e.g.  patients  in  decline  phase  of  their  ambulation).  The  effects  observed  in  the  pivotal 
study  were  considered  generally  encouraging,  as  also  supported  by  the  previous  input  from  the 
SAG, and in the context of a revised position on the mechanism of action and on the issue of dose-
response  relationship,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  view  that  the  observed  results  could  reflect  a  true 
effect and thus constitute evidence of efficacy. 
As discussed above, the bell-shape dose response hypothesis was used by the Applicant to explain 
why  effects  were  only  seen  with  the  lower  dose  (10,  10,  20  mg/kg).  Following  re-examination  of 
the initial opinion the CHMP was of the view that, despite some limitations of the findings, the bell-
shaped  dose  response  hypothesis  was  plausible  and  the  available  evidence  could  provide  a 
rationale for the observed differences in efficacy between the two doses tested, i.e. higher efficacy 
seen in the 10, 10, 20 mg/kg dose and minimal efficacy in the 20, 20, 40 mg/kg dose.  
The  CHMP  was  of  the  view  that  the  results  on  the  secondary  endpoints  provided  only  limited 
support for the primary endpoint outcomes and needed to be seen only as trends. Nevertheless, in 
line  with  the  previous  input  from  the  SAG,  the  CHMP  acknowledged  that  most  of  the  secondary 
endpoints were of such nature that any effect would have to be driven by an increase in strength 
and for this to occur, higher levels of dystrophin in muscular fibres would have to be achieved. 
Although  the  safety  data  identified  some  safety  concerns,  in  general  these  were  considered 
manageable  through  the  implementation  of  adequate  pharmacovigilance  activities  and  risk 
minimisation  measures  as  described  in  the  proposed  Risk  Management  Plan.  The  lack  of  serious 
toxic effects and the oral administration were also considered to represent clear advantages for a 
population of mainly paediatric patients.

Overall, the CHMP was of the view that the risks of the product could be considered acceptable and 
that  the  data  provided  sufficient  level  of  evidence  that  ataluren  may  be  beneficial  in  delaying 
disease  progression  in  nmDMD.  Therefore,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  a  favourable  benefit-risk 
balance could be established at this point.  
As in the initial phase of the MAA review, the CHMP discussed the appropriate target population for 
the  use  of  ataluren.  Considering  that  the  beneficial  effects  were  most  prominent  in  a  sub-
population  of  ambulatory  patients  in  the  decline  phase  of  their  walking  ability  (effect  size  of 
approximately 50 metres on the 6MWD), the CHMP discussed whether this finding would imply the 
need  for  restricting  the  indication  to  a  population  defined  accordingly,  i.e.  patients  in  ambulatory 
decline  phase.  In  line  with  the  previous  position  of  the  SAG,  the  CHMP  agreed  that  scientifically 
there  should  be  no  reason  for  the  drug  not  to  be  given  to  milder  patients  if  efficacy  had  been 
established  in  more  severe  ones.  Furthermore,  the CHMP  considered  that  while  less  prominent,  a 
clinically  meaningful  effect  was  seen  also  in  the  overall  population  studied.  Thus,  the  CHMP 
concluded that ataluren can be authorised in the indication: 
“Translarna  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  Duchenne  muscular  dystrophy  resulting  from  a 
nonsense  mutation  in  the  dystrophin  gene,  in  ambulatory  patients  aged  5  years  and  older. 
Efficacy has not been demonstrated in non-ambulatory patients. 
The  presence  of  a  nonsense  mutation  in  the  dystrophin  gene  should  be  determined  by  genetic 
testing.” 
The  Applicant  applied  for  a  conditional  marketing  authorisation  with  the  proposal  that  additional 
data  would  be  generated  post-authorisation  in  the  confirmatory  phase  3  study  PTC124-GD-020-
DMD (study 020). Therefore, the CHMP also re-discussed the criteria that would need to be met for 
a conditional approval according to Articles 2 and 4 of the Regulation (EC) no 507/2006, and made 
the following conclusions upon re-examination of the initial CHMP Opinion: 
• 
DMD  is  a  life-threatening  and  chronically  debilitating  condition  where  no  satisfactory 
methods  of  treatment  exist  and  it  was  considered  that  the  product  would  thus  address  an  unmet 
medical need. 
• 
Upon  review  of  the  Applicant´s  grounds  for  re-examination,  the  CHMP  considered  that 
despite  the  uncertainties  discussed  above  and  the  fact  that  the  dataset  was  not  comprehensive, 
sufficient  efficacy  was  seen  to  conclude  on  a  favourable  benefit-risk  balance.  Of  note,  this 
conclusion was to a great extent supported by the safety profile of ataluren, which does not pose 
any major safety concerns.  
• 
The  criterion  that  the  benefits  to  public  health  of  the  immediate  availability  outweigh  the 
risks  inherent  in  the  fact  that  additional  data  are  still  required  was  considered  fulfilled  since  the 
benefits  to  public  health  were  substantiated  by  providing  a  treatment  for  a  serious  disease, 
characterised by gradual deterioration of the condition and a fatal outcome. 
• 
With  respect  to  generating  additional  data  post  authorisation,  the  CHMP  considered  that 
the  Applicant  will  complete  a  confirmatory  randomized  placebo-controlled  Phase  3  study  (study 
020)  with  the  10,  10,  20  mg/kg/day  dose  in  patients  with  nmDMD.  The  CHMP  agreed  that  this 
clinical trial may provide data alleviating the current uncertainties and acknowledged the timelines 
planned  for  its  conduct  and  submission  of  its  results  (4Q  2015).  With  respect  to  the  study 
feasibility,  the  position  of  the  CHMP  changed  at  the  time  of  the  re-examination  Opinion; 
specifically, the CHMP considered that performing the study was plausible per se, independent of 
the marketing authorisation status.

A favourable benefit-risk balance was established based on the data available at the time of this 
MAA and the CHMP concluded that the confirmatory evidence from study 020 was acceptable to 
be generated post authorisation. 
Overall,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  conditions  for  granting  a  conditional  marketing  authorisation 
were met.

The  undersigned  members  of  the  CHMP  did  not  agree  with  the  CHMP’s  negative  opinion 
recommending the refusal of the granting of a conditional approval of Translarna in the indication 
“treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy resulting from a nonsense mutation in the dystrophin 
gene, in patients aged 5 years and older”. 
The reasons for the divergent opinion are as follows: 
Translarna was developed to address the unmet medical need of the small fraction of patients with 
Duchenne  muscular  dystrophy  (DMD)  caused  by  a  nonsense  mutation,  estimated  to  be  2500 
patients (13%) of the European DMD population (~19000 patients). There are no remaining issues 
from the Quality point of view, and although some Non-clinical issues are still identified, they can 
be followed-up post approval. Considering the Clinical data, although the results are not sufficiently 
robust  for  a  full  Marketing  Authorisation,  the  demonstrated  effects  are  considered  to  be 
encouraging.  The  robustness  of  the  results  was  challenged  because  of  the  observed  variability  in 
the primary efficacy data, the fact that many of the important conclusions supporting efficacy were 
derived from post hoc analyses and the fact that there was little supportive evidence of effect from 
the data on the secondary endpoints. It is recognized that at the time the study was designed the 
knowledge  of  the  natural  history  of  the  disease  was  different  from  what  we  currently  know. 
Therefore, the post hoc analyses reflecting the most current knowledge about the natural history of 
the disease, and in this respect the definition of the sub-groups in these analyses is clinically and 
scientifically justified. In agreement with the SAG experts, results derived from these analyses may 
be  considered  clinically  relevant,  especially  in  the  sub-group  of  patients  with  more  advanced 
disease.  Additionally,  the  lack  of  effect  on  the  secondary  endpoints  could  be  explained  by  the 
expected mechanism of action of the drug i.e. partial restoration of dystrophin production. Most of 
the secondary endpoints are of such nature that any effect will have to be driven by an increase in 
strength,  rather  than  by  an  improvement  of  function.  The  latest  available  data  suggest  that 
minimal  increase  in  dystrophin  production  could  lead  to  functional  improvement,  but  not  to 
improvement of strength. For the latter to occur, levels of dystrophin close to the ones in normal 
muscular  fibres  may  need  to  be  achieved.  This  could  be  a  valid  explanation  of  the  lack  of 
concordance between the results on the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. The group also 
noted that, despite the fact that efficacy was most prominently shown in the sub-group of patients 
with  more  advanced  disease,  there  were  trends  of  efficacy  in  all  the  sub-groups  by  severity, 
although  of  a  different  magnitude.  This  finding  may  be  expected  since  the  decline  in  function  of 
DMD patients is not linear, but rather the speed of functional decline increases with the duration of 
the disease. In that respect, it would be very difficult to show a significant functional improvement 
in mildly affected patients in the frame of a controlled clinical trial with duration of 1 or 2 years. On 
the contrary, in more severely affected patients even a small effect on function could be detectable 
and  clinically  meaningful.  It  should  be  acknowledged  that,  in  these  patients,  even  small  effects 
providing  longer  independent  use  of  arms  and  hands,  or  preserving  the  ability  to  feed  and  drink 
from a cup on their own, would represent a significant and important achievement.  
Taking  all  of  the  above  into  consideration  and  in  the  absence  of  major  safety  concerns,  the 
minority  view  was  that  a  positive  benefit/risk  relationship  of  ataluren  has  been  reasonably 
established  in  Duchenne  patients  with  nonsense  mutations  and,  consequently,  treatment  with

ataluren should not be withheld from these patients. A conditional approval with the ongoing phase 
III  trial  as  condition  was  considered  acceptable.    In  addition,  the  long-term  benefit  of  ataluren  in 
this population could be documented by following patients up in specific registries.  
Overall, and under the scope of a conditional approval, the B/R balance is considered to be positive 
in the following indication: “Duchenne muscular dystrophy (nmDMD) caused by nonsense mutation 
in the dystrophin gene, in ambulatory patients aged 5 and older”.

recommending the granting of the marketing authorisation of Translarna indicated in the treatment 
of  Duchenne  muscular  dystrophy  resulting  from  a  nonsense  mutation  in  the  dystrophin  gene,  in 
ambulatory patients aged 5 years and older. 
The reason for the divergent opinion was as follows: 
• 
The single study fails to demonstrate evidence of therapeutic efficacy of Translarna either 
on  the  primary  endpoint  (6MWD)  or  on  secondary  efficacy  measures.  The  study  failed  on 
its  primary  endpoint  analysis  and  efficacy  claims  are  based  on  post  hoc  revisions  to  the 
analysis and on subgroup analyses. The argument that efficacy could be shown more easily 
in the decline phase subgroup seems plausible, based on data on the natural history of the 
disease, and it is agreed that confirmation of efficacy in these patients could be in principle 
extrapolated to support a general indication in DMD. However there are concerns that the 
presented  analyses  in  this  subgroup  might  be  data  driven  i.e.  the  inclusion  or  exclusion 
from the subgroup of a few patients with a large change in 6MWD (depending on how the 
population is defined) could substantially affect the analysis. In this context it is noted that 
the corresponding analysis in the pre-specified <350 metre (baseline 6MWD) subgroup was 
much less impressive than in the post hoc defined decline phase subgroup. The mechanism 
of  action  of  Translarna  and  an  effect  on  a  relevant  pharmacodynamic  measure  have  not 
been conclusively established, which adds further uncertainty. There is some  evidence for 
the  bell  shape  dose-response  relationship  but  still  some  uncertainty.  The  numerous 
assumptions  that  need  to  be  made  to  accept  the  claim  that  efficacy  is  shown  for  the  low 
dose  (but  not  the  high  dose)  in  the  decline  phase  subgroup  is  considered  problematic. 
Confirmatory  data  from  on-going  phase  3  trial  are  considered  necessary  and  a  positive 
benefit-risk balance has not been established at the present time due to a lack of evidence 
of efficacy.

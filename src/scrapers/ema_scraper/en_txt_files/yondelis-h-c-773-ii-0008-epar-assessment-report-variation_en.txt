Introduction 
Yondelis (trabectedin) is an antineoplastic agent that binds to the minor groove of DNA, bending the 
helix  to  the  major  groove.  This  binding  to  DNA  triggers  a  cascade  of  events  affecting  several 
transcription factors, DNA binding proteins, and DNA repair pathways, resulting in perturbation of the 
cell cycle. Trabectedin has been shown to exert antiproliferative in vitro and in vivo activity against a 
range of human tumour cell lines and experimental tumours, including malignancies such as sarcoma, 
breast, non-small cell lung, ovarian and melanoma. 
Yondelis (trabectedin), formerly known as ecteinascidin 743 (ET-743) was granted orphan designation 
(EU/3/01/039) by the European Commission on 30 May 2001 for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma. 
Subsequently,  an  orphan  designation  (EU/3/03/171)  was  granted  by  the  European  Commission  for 
trabectedin for the treatment of ovarian cancer.  
Yondelis  was  granted  a  marketing  authorisation  in  the  European  Union  on  17  September  2007. 
Yondelis is indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma, after failure of 
anthracyclines  and  ifosfamide,  or  who  are  unsuited  to  receive  these  agents.  Efficacy  data  are  based 
mainly on  liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma patients. 
This  type  II  variation  concerns  the  addition  of  a  new  indication  of  Yondelis  in  combination  with 
pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in the treatment of patients with relapsed platinum-sensitive 
ovarian cancer. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.6 of the SPC have been 
updated.  The  Package  Leaflet  has  been  updated  accordingly.  Further,  annex  II  has  been  updated  to 
include the agreed version 6.0 of the RMP. 
1.2 
Background 
Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary is one of the most common gynaecologic malignancies and the fifth 
most frequent cause of cancer death in women, with 50% of all cases occurring in women older than 
65  years.  Approximately  5%  to  10%  of  ovarian  cancers  are  familial  and  three  distinct  hereditary 
patterns have been identified: ovarian cancer alone, ovarian and breast cancers, or ovarian and colon 
cancers. The most important risk factor for ovarian cancer is a family history of a first-degree relative 
(e.g., mother, daughter, or sister) with the disease. 
Prognosis in ovarian cancer is influenced by several factors, but multivariate analyses suggest that the 
most important favourable factors include: 
  Younger age.  
  Good performance status.  
  Cell type other than mucinous and clear cell.  
  Lower stage.  
  Well-differentiated tumour.  
  Smaller disease volume prior to any surgical procedure.  
  Absence of ascites.  
  Smaller residual tumour following primary cytoreductive surgery 
Management of ovarian carcinoma depends on the extent of disease and prior therapy that the patient 
has received. The FIGO (Federation Internationale de Gynecologie et d’Obstetrique) staging system is 
used to classify the extent of disease and provide the basis for treatment considerations. Patients with 
newly  diagnosed  Stage  I  or  II  disease  have  limited  ovarian  carcinoma  confined  to  the  ovaries  and 
pelvis.  Patients  diagnosed  with  Stage  III  or  IV  disease  have  advanced  ovarian  carcinoma  that  is 
intraperitoneal (IP) or involves distant metastases. Patients whose disease recurs or persists after prior 
therapy  are  referred  to  as  having  recurrent  or  persistent  disease.  Most  patients  (75%)  present  with 
disseminated (Stage III or IV) disease; 17% with Stage III disease, 58% with Stage IV.  
The standard of care for advanced disease, set forth at a 2004 Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) 
consensus  conference,  consists  of  maximum  attempted  surgical  cytoreduction,  chemotherapy 
following surgery, and a drug regimen of paclitaxel/carboplatin repeated every 3 weeks for 6 cycles.

Results  with  this  approach  depend  on  the  volume  of  residual  disease.  Those  with  large-volume 
residual disease (nodules >2 cm in diameter remaining after surgery) will achieve a clinical CR in 40 
to 50% of cases and will have a median PFS of 17 months and median survival of 30 months. Those 
with  small-volume  residual  disease  (no  nodule  >2  cm  in  diameter  after  surgery)  have  a  95% 
probability of ending initial therapy with no clinical evidence of disease and will exhibit median PFS 
of 25 months and median survival of 60 months.  
For Stage I or II, the general practice is to look at tumour features that predict prognosis and divide 
patients  according  to  low  and  high  risk  for  recurrence.  Low-risk  patients  are  those  with  low-grade 
disease  whose  cancer  is  intracystic,  who  have  no  extraovarian  disease,  have  negative  peritoneal 
cytology,  and  have  no  ascites.  High-risk  patients  are  those  with  intermediate-  to  high-grade  disease 
whose  cancer  is  extracystic  and  who  have  extraovarian  disease,  positive  peritoneal  cytology,  and 
ascites.  Treatment  recommendations  for  limited  disease  include  platinum-based  therapy,  total 
abdominal  hysterectomy–bilateral  salpingo-oophorectomy,  and  careful  surgical  exploration.  Some 
patients  with  low-risk  limited  disease  have  no  further  therapy.  Those  with  high-risk  disease  receive 
platinum-based  therapy;  adjunct  platinum-based  therapy  cuts  relapse  in  half.  Patients  with  advanced 
disease receive surgical cytoreduction and paclitaxel/carboplatin.  
Most patients (62%) will not achieve long-term control of the disease and will develop either recurrent 
or persistent disease. Management of such patients requires that they first be classified as having either 
chemosensitive  disease  (i.e.,  response  to  first-line  therapy  leading  to  a  treatment-free  interval  of  at 
least 6 months) or chemoresistant disease (i.e., progression during first-line therapy or best response to 
first-line therapy: stable disease or recurrence within 6 months of completing first-line therapy). Those 
with chemosensitive disease are retreated with a platinum-based  regimen; the  expected RR is >60% 
and  median  survival  is  ≥30  months.  Those  with  chemoresistant  disease  are  treated  with  alternative 
drug therapy; expected RR is 12 to 32% and median survival is ≥8 months.  
Clinical recurrences that take place within 6 months of completion of a platinum-containing regimen 
are  considered  platinum-refractory  or  platinum-resistant  recurrences.  Anthracyclines  (particularly 
when  formulated  as  PLD),  taxanes,  topotecan,  and  gemcitabine  are  used  as  single  agents  for  these 
recurrences based on activity and their favourable therapeutic indices. 
Treatment with paclitaxel historically provided the first agent with consistent activity in patients with 
platinum-refractory or platinum-resistant recurrences (Kohn EC, Sarosy G, Bicher A, et al 1994 and 
Trimble EL, Adams JD, Vena D, et al. 1993). Subsequently, randomized studies have indicated that 
the  use  of  topotecan  achieved  results  that  were  comparable  to  those  achieved  with  paclitaxel  (ten 
Bokkel  Huinink  W,  Gore  M,  Carmichael  J,  et  al.  1997).  Topotecan  was  compared  with  pegylated 
liposomal doxorubicin in a randomized trial of 474 patients and demonstrated similar response rates, 
PFS, and OS at the time  of the initial report, contributed primarily by the platinum-resistant subsets 
(Gordon AN, Fleagle JT, Guthrie D, et al. 2001). 
PLD is marketed in the European Union under the brand name of Caelyx (it is also known as DOXIL). 
PLD is a liposomal anthracycline with a broad  spectrum of antineoplastic activity including ovarian 
cancer.  Caelyx  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  advanced  ovarian  cancer  in  women  after  failure  of 
first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. 
The application is based primarily on clinical data from one pivotal Phase III study (ET743-OVA301) 
of  Yondelis  in  combination  with  Caelyx  in  patients  with  advanced  ovarian  cancer  who  had  failed  a 
first-line  platinum-based  chemotherapy.  In  addition  results  from  3  Phase  II  trials  of  trabectedin  as 
single agent in a similar patient population are included as supportive efficacy data.

 Toxico-pharmacological aspects 
An  environmental  risk  assessment  was  submitted  in  this  application  in  accordance  with  the  CHMP 
the  environmental  risk  assessment  of  medicinal  products  for  human  use 
Guideline  on 
(CHMP/SWP/4447/00).

The  MAH  has  estimated  the  partition  coefficient  log  Kow  based  on  theoretical  considerations. 
Although the estimated log Kow is far from the action limit, this approach is not considered acceptable. 
The MAH should determine the partition coefficient in accordance with the current OECD guidelines, 
i.e., OECD 107 or 117 (the latter  method is only applicable for compounds with a log Kow<4). The 
MAH should submit the study report when available. 
The MAH has calculated the PECSW based on the maximum dose per patient adjusted for treatment 
duration. This approach is not acceptable. In the Phase I environment risk assessment, the calculation 
of  the  PECSW  is  based  on  a  screening  model  (snapshot  model)  in  which  the  patient  population  is 
treated  with  the  product  and  the  maximum  daily  dose  on  a  given  day.  Therefore,  the  MAH’s 
calculation on an average daily dose for one patient is not acceptable. The MAH has provided justified 
epidemiological  data  published  by  EMEA  (EMEA/COMP/96616/2008,  EMEA/COMP/48649/2008) 
on the incidence of the target diseases for Yondelis (soft tissue sarcoma and ovarian cancer) within the 
EU.  Using  the  maximum  daily  dose  of  2.595  mg/day  and  1.903 mg/day  for  soft  tissue  sarcoma  and 
ovarian  cancer,  respectively,  and  the  refined  Fpen  yield  a  PECSW  of  approximately  0.0003  µg/L  for 
both indications. Thus, PECsw values are well below the threshold for a Phase II environmental risk 
assessment. 
The  MAH  commits  to  submit  the  experimental  value  of  log  P  according  to  the  relevant  OECD 
methods.

1.4.1  Clinical Pharmacology 
New pharmacokinetic data have been obtained since the marketing authorisation of Yondelis, mainly 
in 5 clinical trials (one in monotherapy and four in combination with other drugs). The potential for an 
interaction between trabectedin and PLD was assessed in patients with ovarian cancer enrolled in the 
phase  I  study  ET743-USA-11.  Additionally,  the  pharmacokinetics  of  trabectedin  and  doxorubicin 
(non-liposomal) when given as a combination therapy was characterised in the phase I studies ET743-
SAR-1001 and ET-A-007-00.  
II  studies 
(ET-B-009-99,  ET-B-026-03  and  ET743-INT-11)  evaluated 
Three  phase 
the 
pharmacokinetics of trabectedin given as a single agent in patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Data 
from  studies  ET-B-009-99  and  ET743-INT-11  were  already  included  in  the  initial  marketing 
authorisation  application  of  Yondelis  in  soft  tissue  sarcoma.  Finally,  a  population  pharmacokinetic 
analysis  has  been  performed  using  data  from  the  phase  III  study  OVA-301.  The  concentrations  of 
trabectedin and doxorubicin (given as PLD) were analyzed. 
In study ET-B-026-03 all patients received 20 mg of dexamethasone at 30 minutes prior to start of the 
trabectedin  infusion.  Those  who  received  the  1.3 mg/m2  dose  were  also  given  4  mg  of  oral 
dexamethasone  at  24 h  and  12 h  before  the  start  of  the  trabectedin  infusion  and  5 more  doses  every 
12 h beginning 24 h after the start of the 3-h infusion. Full pharmacokinetic profiles (up to 6 to 8 days 
after the end of the 24-h and 3-h infusions) of trabectedin were collected during Cycle 1. 
As  expected  much  higher  mean  concentrations  in  plasma  were  observed  just  prior  the  end  of  the 
infusion when given over 3 h as compared to 24 h (Table 2). The minor differences observed in the 
mean  CL,Vss,  and  the  terminal  half-life  values  between  the  regimens  were  within  the  degree  of 
interpatient variability and are not likely to be clinically significance.

The main objective of Study ET-743-USA-11 was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) 
of trabectedin when administered in combination with Caelyx (doxorubicin HCl liposome injection). 
Secondary  objectives  were  to  evaluate  the  safety  profile  of  this  combination  of  study  drugs,  to 
investigate  potential  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  interactions  between  trabectedin  and  Caelyx.  A  sparse 
pharmacokinetic sampling procedure was used during Cycles 1, 2, and 3. Venous blood samples were 
collected during the three  cycles at the  following times: before the start of the intravenous infusion, 
10 minutes  before  the  end  of  1-h  intravenous  infusion,  and  2.83 h  and  168 h  after  the  end  of  the 
infusion.  The  concentrations  of  total  (encapsulated  plus  free)  doxorubicin  in  plasma  were  measured 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
using  a  validated  LC-MS/MS  method.  A  population  approach  (non-linear  mixed-effects  model 
software; NONMEM) was used to characterize the pharmacokinetics of total doxorubicin. A total of 
234 liposomal doxorubicin plasma concentrations from 30 patients were available for the analysis. An 
open one-compartment model with linear elimination was used to fit the plasma concentration versus 
time  data  of  total  (liposomal  encapsulated  and  free)  doxorubicin.  The  model  was  parameterized  in 
terms  of  systemic  clearance  (CL)  and  volume  of  the  central  compartment (V).  The  interindividual 
(IIV,  between  patient)  and  interoccasion  (IOV)  variability  in  the  pharmacokinetic  parameters  were 
assumed  to  follow  the  log-normal  distribution.  Residual  variability  was  evaluated  using  an  additive 
error model. 
Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin showed a long terminal half-life (74 h), a slow clearance (0.037 L/h), 
and a small volume of distribution (3.9 L) in plasma. No evidence of changes in pegylated liposomal 
doxorubicin clearance appear to occur within the range of trabectedin doses studied.

to Subjects Coadministered Caelyx 
The primary objective of Study ET743-SAR-1001 was to determine the regimen of the combination of 
trabectedin and (non-liposomal) doxorubicin for which neutropenia was manageable in patients with 
soft tissue sarcoma. Evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of both drugs was a secondary objective. 
The  following  regimens,  each  administered  every  3  weeks,  were  evaluated  in  separate  cohorts: 
(i) trabectedin  0.9   mg/m2  and  doxorubicin  60 mg/m2,  (ii)  trabectedin  1.1 mg/m2  and  doxorubicin 
60 mg/m2, and (iii) trabectedin 1.3 mg/m2 and doxorubicin 60 mg/m2. For all treatments, doxorubicin 
was  administered  as  a  10-  to  15-minute  infusion  and  immediately  followed  by  trabectedin  as  a  3-h 
infusion.  Both  drugs  were  administered  via  a  central  venous  catheter.  All  patients  received  20 mg 
intravenous dexamethasone within 1 h before the start of doxorubicin. 
Regarding  the  trabectedin  data,  the  relatively  small  sample  sizes  and  between-subject  variability 
precluded comparison of the pharmacokinetic parameters between the treatment groups. The data are 
shown below 
7 
 
 
 
 
Table 4 – Mean (SD) Trabectedin Pharmacokinetic Parameter Values Following Single-Dose 
Administration of Trabectedin in Subjects Coadministered Doxorubicin 
With respect to the doxorubicin data, maximum plasma concentrations of doxorubicin were generally 
observed  15 to  20 minutes  after  the  start  of  the  infusion.  The  concentrations  then  declined  in  a 
multiexponential manner. An increase in the mean plasma Cmax and AUC values of doxorubicin was 
observed with increasing coadministered doses of trabectedin despite administration of the same dose 
of  doxorubicin  to  all  patients.  However,  minimal  differences  and  no  clear  trend  are  observed  when 
comparing  the  mean  plasma  concentrations  at  each  time  point  between  1.25 h  and  51 h  (inclusive) 
after the start of the infusions. Thus, the concentration of the first pharmacokinetic sample (0.25 h) for 
each  profile  accounted  for  the  differences  in  the  plasma  Cmax  and  AUC  values  observed  across  the 
dose groups. Minimal differences in the mean t1/2 values were observed substantiating the absence of 
an effect of trabectedin on doxorubicin elimination. 
Table 5 – Mean (SD) Doxorubicin Pharmacokinetic Parameter Values Following Single-Dose 
Administration of Doxorubicin in Subjects Coadministered Trabectedin 
The  between  subject  variability  in  the  pharmacokinetic  parameters  of  doxorubicin  is  relatively  high 
(37% to 93%). For this reason, and due to the relatively small number of subjects evaluated, a strict 
assessment of the impact of trabectedin on the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin (and doxorubicinol) is 
not possible. 
ET-A-007-00  was  conducted  to  establish  the  maximum  tolerated  dose  and  least  toxic  sequence  of 
trabectedin and doxorubicin in combinations to patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma and breast 
8 
 
 
 
 
cancer. In addition, the potential for a pharmacokinetic interaction between these drugs was assessed 
as secondary endpoint. 
During the Part 1 of the study, patients were randomized to receive doxorubicin (60 mg/m2, 5-minute 
intravenous infusion) either before or after escalating doses of trabectedin (starting dose 0.6 mg/m2, as 
a 3-h infusion) in Cycles 1 and 2. For either sequence, the second drug was started at 1 h after the end 
of the administration of the first drug. Part 2 of the study was designed to optimize the dose regimens 
by  evaluating  the  tolerability  of  a  fixed  dose  of  doxorubicin  (50 mg/m2  or  60  mg/m2)  and  various 
doses  levels  of  trabectedin.  Oral  dexamethasone  (4 mg)  was  given  to  all  patients  at  24 h  before 
doxorubicin/trabectedin  dosing  on  Day  1  and  again  15  minutes  before  and  7  h  after  the  start  of 
administration of the combination. Dexamethasone continued to be given twice daily on Days 2 and 3.

Finally, the pivotal study included a Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis of Trabectedin in Patients 
With  Ovarian  Cancer.  Plasma  samples  for  pharmacokinetic  assessment  were  collected  from  patients 
who  enrolled  in  the  study  ET743-OVA-301  at  select  sites  during  Cycles  1  and  2.  The  population 
analysis included 2074 samples that were collected from 166 patients and analyzed for total (liposomal 
encapsulated  and  free)  doxorubicin  concentrations  and  963 samples  collected  from  86  patients  that 
were  analyzed  for  trabectedin  concentrations.  An  additional  361 trabectedin  concentrations  collected 
from 142 patients enrolled in ET743-INT-11 were included in this population analysis.

Notably,  these  results  are  not  consistent  with  those  obtained  during  Phase  1  study  ET743-USA-11, 
which  suggested  that  the  pharmacokinetics  of  trabectedin  are  not  influenced  by  the  concomitant 
administration of PLD. 
The effect of dexamethasone on the plasma clearance of trabectedin was reassessed using data from 
the present and former population analysis (n=831 patients in total). In agreement with the previous 
results, the plasma clearance of trabectedin was 19% higher in patients who received any concomitant 
dexamethasone administration relative to those who did not. 
The  total  plasma  doxorubicin  concentration-time  data  were  adequately  characterized  with  a  one-
compartmental  model.  Patient  body  surface  area  was  an  important  covariate  that  could  explain 
interpatient variability in clearance and distribution volume. Importantly, the estimated values of these 
pharmacokinetic  parameters  of  doxorubicin  were  similar  when  PLD  was  coadministered  with 
trabectedin and when given as a single agent.

The MAH conclusions of Population PK Study Report regarding interactions between trabectedin and 
Caelyx were as follows:  
1)  The  ET743-OVA301  parameter  estimates  for  clearance,  central  volume  of  distribution  and  K12 
obtained  during  the  analysis  of  historical  trabectedin  data  combined  with  INT11  and  OVA301  data 
were significantly lower relative to previous values. The clearance of trabectedin was on average 31% 
lower, causing a higher exposure when given with Caelyx, relative to administration as a single agent. 
2) The plasma clearance of Caelyx was approximately 7% lower when given with trabectedin, relative 
to administration as a single agent.  
Discussion on Clinical Pharmacology 
Regarding the PK in ovarian patients, the MAH has submitted three phase II studies and one phase III 
trial  (pivotal  study).  The  phase  II  clinical  trials  evaluated  the  PK  characteristics  of  trabectedin 
administered at different regimens in patients with ovarian cancer. In general, the pharmacokinetics of 
trabectedin in ovarian cancer patients seems to be very similar to that described in previous studies. 
Concerning  the  possible  interaction  between  doxorubicin  (pegylated  and  non-pegylated  form)  and 
trabectedin, several studies have been carried out.  The phase I study ET743-USA-11 showed that the 
concentrations of liposomal doxorubicin and trabectedin in plasma were not substantially altered when 
given  in  combination.  Pharmacokinetic  parameter  values  of  each  compound  were  similar  to  those 
reported  previously  when  each  was  given  as  a  single  agent.  Similar  conclusions  were  drawn  from 
the 
studies  ET-A-007-00  and  ET743-SAR-1001  with  non-liposomal  doxorubicin.  However, 
conclusions regarding the absence of a PK drug-drug interaction cannot be extrapolated from studies 
with doxorubicin non pegylated to the combination of trabectedin with PLD.  
The PK results of the pivotal study OVA-301 and specifically the population PK study, with data from 
the OVA-301 pivotal, showed a significant discrepancy between these ones data and those from study 
ET743-USA-11. Study OVA-301 only included population PK data. However, it cannot be excluded 
that  the  PK  profile  of  trabectedin  is  changed  with  co-administration  of  pegylated  liposomal 
doxorubicin. The trabectedin clearance  was on average 31% lower, causing a higher exposure when 
given with PLD, relative to its administration as a single agent. The pivotal study represents the target 
population of this indication. Therefore the results on these patients could be considered as the most 
predictable  information  of  the  “real”  characteristics  in  whole  population.  A  decrease  in  the  Cl  of 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
trabectedin could be expected when it will be co-administered with PLD. The clinical meaning of this 
fact  is  for  the  time  being,  unknown.  Information  on  PK  profile,  specifically  the  interaction  between 
Trabectedin and PLD, is therefore reflected in the section 5.2 of the SPC. 
1.4.2 
Clinical efficacy 
The schedule used for trabectedin in the pivotal phase III trial (q3wk 3-h) was supported by results of a 
phase II randomised trial (ET-B-026-03), which showed that two every-3-week regimens (1.5 mg/m2, 
24-hour  i.v.  infusion,  and  1.3  mg/m2,  3-hour  i.v.  infusion)  were  similarly  active  in  patients  with 
relapsed, platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer; however, a slightly better safety profile was found for the 
3-hour  schedule  with  respect  to  myelosuppression  (neutropenia)  and  fatigue,  together  with  a  more 
convenient  administration  schedule.  Subsequently,  a  phase  I  trial  (ET743-USA-11)  evaluated  the 
q3wk  3-h  regimen  of  trabectedin  in  combination  with  PLD.  The  recommended  doses  based  on  this 
phase  I  trial  were  trabectedin  1.1  mg/m2  and  PLD  30  mg/m2.  These  were  the  doses  used  in  the 
randomised study OVA-301 for the investigational combination arm. 
1.4.2.1  Pivotal study 
In  August  2004,  the  applicant  requested  the  European  Medicines  Agency  (EMEA)  to  provide  with 
CHMP  Protocol  Assistance  for  the  pivotal  study  OVA-301.  The  CHMP  feedback  was  received  in 
December 2004 and March 2005 for the initial and follow-up requests, respectively. In words of the 
company, the protocol incorporated recommendations received from both the EMEA and the United 
States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  
Methods 
OVA-301 was a phase III, open-label, multicentre, randomised clinical trial designed to investigate the 
efficacy and safety of the combination of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD, Caelyx) 30 mg/m2 
followed by trabectedin 1.1 mg/m2 every 3 weeks compared with the approved standard single-agent 
PLD 50 mg/m2 every 4 weeks. 
Subjects enrolled were 18 years of age or older with histologically proven epithelial ovarian, epithelial 
fallopian  tube,  or  primary  peritoneal  cancer  previously  treated  with  only  1  platinum-based 
chemotherapy regimen and had experienced either recurrence or progression after more than 6 months 
from the beginning (first dose) of the initial line of platinum-based chemotherapy for ovarian cancer to 
include  subjects  with  platinum-resistant  disease  (platinum-free  interval  from  the  end  of  first-line 
treatment  less  than  6  months)  and  subjects  with  platinum-sensitive  disease  (platinum-free  interval 
from  the  end  of  first-line  treatment  ≥6  months)  who  are  not  expected  to  benefit  from  or  who  were 
ineligible for or who were not willing to receive retreatment with platinum-based chemotherapy.  
The primary objective of this study was as follows: 
– compare the PFS of the combination of trabectedin + Caelyx with Caelyx monotherapy in patients 
with ovarian cancer. 
Secondary objectives were as follows: 
– compare overall survival (OS) between the 2 treatment arms; 
– compare the overall objective response rate (ORR) between the 2 treatment arms; 
– compare the safety profiles between the 2 treatment arms; and 
– characterize the PK of trabectedin and Caelyx in each treatment arm. 
Tertiary objectives included: 
– evaluation of quality of life (QOL) and pharmacoeconomics; and 
–  exploratory  evaluation  of  pharmacogenomic  profiles  and  hypothesis-generating  evaluation  of  the 
relationship between circulating tumor cells (CTCs), and the response to therapy, disease progression, 
and OS.

Progression  free  survival  (PFS)  is  defined  as  the  time  between  the  randomization  and  disease 
progression or death. Subjects who progressed or died will be considered to have had an event, except 
if this event occurs after the start of subsequent therapy for ovarian cancer, in which case the subject is 
censored  at  the  time  of  last  tumor  assessment  (prior  to  or  on  the  first  day  of  the  first  subsequent 
therapy for ovarian cancer). Subjects who did not progress nor died (lost to follow-up, or still being 
treated without documented disease progression, or started subsequent therapy for ovarian cancer and 
still alive) will be censored at the date of the last tumor assessment (prior to or on the first day of the 
first  subsequent  therapy  for  ovarian  cancer).  The  primary  efficacy  analysis  set  is  based  on  the  “All 
Measurable  Subjects”.  “All  Measurable  Subjects”  analysis  set  is  defined  as  all  randomized  subjects 
who  have  measurable  disease  at  baseline  as  assessed  by  the  independent  review  (any  of  the 
independent radiologist reviewers). 
Sample size: Approximately 650 subjects were randomized over 2 years. The primary analysis (PFS) 
was conducted after at least 415 events (progression or death) were observed. Assuming that Caelyx 
has a median PFS of 16 weeks and that the combination of trabectedin + Caelyx has a targeted median 
PFS of 22 weeks, this design would allow the demonstration of a statistically significant difference in 
PFS  at  a  one-sided  2.5%  significance  level  with  at  least  90%  power.  An  interim  OS  analysis  was 
performed in conjunction with this PFS analysis. The final OS analysis will be conducted when there 
are  520  observed  deaths.  Assuming  that  Caelyx  has  a  median  OS  of  62.7  weeks  and  that  the 
combination of trabectedin + Caelyx has a targeted median OS of 83.4 weeks, this design would allow 
for  the  demonstration  of  the  statistically  significant  difference  in  OS  at  a  1-sided  2.5%  significance 
level  with  at  least  90%  power.  It  was  anticipated  that  the  final  OS  analysis  would  be  performed  at 
approximately 4.5 years from the start of randomization. 
Results 
  Participant flow and Recruitment 
Nine  subjects  did  not  receive  study  drug  (6  subjects  in  the  Caelyx  monotherapy  arm  and  3  in  the 
trabectedin  +  Caelyx  arm)  as  shown  in  the  table  below.  The  remaining  663  randomized  subjects 
received  at  least  1  dose  of  study  medication  (trabectedin  +  Caelyx,  334;  Caelyx  alone,  329)  and 
comprise the All-Treated Subjects safety analysis population. One subject was randomly assigned to 
trabectedin + Caelyx but received only 1 dose of Caelyx, she opted to discontinue treatment without 
receiving trabectedin. This subject is included in the Caelyx monotherapy arm only for safety analysis.  
The first subject was randomly assigned on 20 April 2005. The last subject was randomly assigned on 
29 May 2007.

Demographic and baseline disease characteristics for patients were similar between the two treatment 
arms and consistent with those of the planned study population described in the study protocol. The 
median age of the study population was 57 years (range, 26-87 years), 78% were white and 63% had a 
baseline performance status of 0. Serous histology (68%) was the most prevalent subtype and 52% had 
grade  3  tumours.  Sites  of  involvement  at  baseline  (median  of  2  lesions)  included  abdomen  (74%), 
pelvis  (69%),  liver  (29%)  and  lungs  (18%).  The  vast  majority  (99%)  had  previously  undergone 
surgery for their cancer and 2% had received prior radiotherapy.  
Consistent with the eligibility requirements, all patients had previously received at least one course of 
platinum-based  chemotherapy,  with  64%  having  platinum-sensitive  disease  (i.e.,  with  PFI    6 
months). The median number of agents used for prior chemotherapy was 2 (range, 1 to 7), including 
taxanes in approximately 80% of patients.

Secondary analyses 
Overall survival 
In the initial variation application, the MAH submitted an analysis of OS data with the clinical cut-off 
date of 15 May 2008 established to achieve a pre-specified (415) number of PFS events. A total of 300 
deaths (145 in the combination arm and 155 in the PLD alone arm) had occurred at cut-off date (55% 
censored  data).  Median  OS  was  20.5  months  (95%  CI,  18.7-24.2)  in  the  combination  arm  and  19.4 
months (95% CI, 17.3-21.7) in the PLD alone arm. 
Further to the request of the CHMP to further justify the efficacy of the combination, on the basis of 
the  magnitude  of  PFS  gain  of  6-8  weeks,  the  MAH  conducted  an  ad  hoc  interim  analysis  of  the 
secondary endpoint OS with a prospectively established cut-off date of 31 May 2009.  
At the 31 May 2009 cut-off, a total of 419 death events (215 in the PLD monotherapy arm and 204 in 
the trabectedin + PLD combination arm) had occurred. This represents 81% of the 520 death events 
required for the final OS analysis, or 62% of the 672 randomised population. Current follow-up ranges 
from April 2005 to May 2009.  
The  trabectedin  +  PLD  combination  resulted  in  a  15%  decrease  in  the  risk  of  death  compared  with 
PLD  alone  [HR=0.85  (95%  CI,  0.70-1.03);  p=0.0920].  The  median  OS  was  19.5 months  (95%  CI, 
17.4-22.1) in the PLD monotherapy arm and 22.4 months (95% CI, 19.4-25.1) in the combination arm 
(Table 14 and Figure 5).

The  median  duration  of  response  for  the  independent  radiologist  review  in  the  Caelyx  monotherapy 
arm  was  7.7  months  (range;  6.5  to  9.0  months)  compared  with  the  trabectedin  +  Caelyx  arm  which 
was 7.9 months (range; 7.4 to 9.2 months). The hazard ratio was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.62;1.46) 
The Caelyx monotherapy arm showed a lower CA-125 CR rate than in the trabectedin + Caelyx arm 
(20% CR versus 30% CR). The Caelyx monotherapy arm showed a lower CA-125 PR rate than in the 
trabectedin + Caelyx arm (13% PR compared with 18% PR) 
No statistically significant differences were found between treatment arms in global measures of QoL. 
Only  minor,  sporadic  differences  in  the  fatigue  symptom  scale  were  found  in  cycles  3  and  9,  with 
some worsening of fatigue for subjects in the combination arm. Mixed-effects models predicting the 
score at baseline and follow-up scores as a function of treatment, days after baseline, and interaction 
between  treatment  and  days  after  baseline  showed  no  significant  differences  between  arms  for  any 
QoL measure. 
Supportive analyses 
Progression-free  survival  analyses  were  repeated  using  platinum  sensitivity  as  a  stratification  factor. 
Using  the  stratified  log-rank  test,  a  statistically  significant  treatment  effect  was  observed  in  all 
analyses.  Due  to  the  low  number  of  subjects  with  an  ECOG  performance  status  score  of  2,  these 
analyses were not carried out using ECOG performance status score as a stratification factor.

(Study ET743-OVA-301, by Analysis Set). 
Based  on  the  Investigator’s  assignment  of  platinum  sensitivity,  a  subgroup  analysis  was  conducted 
using the updated survival data. The effect of trabectedin + PLD combination was more pronounced in 
platinum-sensitive patients (Figure 7) than in those with platinum-resistant disease (Figure 8), although 
in  the  resistant  stratum  both  the  HR=0.90  and  median  values  (14.2  vs.  12.4  months)  still  favour  the 
combination arm.

As  an  exploratory  analysis,  the  therapeutic  effects  of  the  trabectedin  +  PLD  combination  vs.  PLD 
alone have been compared in the subset of patients with intermediate platinum-sensitivity, i.e., those 
with platinum-free interval (PFI) 6-12 months. The OS of this subset is shown in  Figure 9. This is a 
subpopulation where there is a high medical need for new agents, and where single agent PLD is most 
often  recommended,  as  indicated  by  the  National  Institute  for  Clinical  Excellence  (NICE)  and  the 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines.  
In  this  subpopulation  with  intermediate  platinum  sensitivity  (PFI  6-12  month)  of  OVA-301,  with 
relatively mature data (~70% events), trabectedin + PLD induced a highly significant 41% reduction 
in the risk of death (HR=0.59; p=0.0015), with a 6-months advantage in median survival relative to 
single-agent PLD.

Figure 10 outlines a summary of the main and sensitivity analyses for the updated OS data. This figure 
illustrates  again  the  consistency  of  the  survival  benefit  obtained  with  the  trabectedin  +  PLD 
combination. The favourable and consistent OS findings in this study strongly support the role of PFS 
as an appropriate surrogate for survival in this patient population.

Multivariate analyses 
Cox  proportional  hazard  models  were  used  to  compare  the  2  treatment  arms  and  included  the 
following  baseline  covariates:  ECOG  performance  status  score  (0  or  >0),  platinum  sensitivity 
(platinum  sensitive  or  platinum  resistant),  race  (white  or  non–white),  CA-125  (<2  times  ULN  or  ≥2 
times  ULN),  age  (<65  years  or  ≥65  years  of  age),  liver  or  lung  involvement  (yes  or  no),  and  prior 
taxane  use  (yes  or  no).  Race,  age,  and  prior  taxane  use  were  not  considered  in  the  reduced  model, 
which excluded variables at a 0.15 significance level (p values for these covariates are 0.30, 0.42, and 
0.86, respectively). Age <65 years and ≥65 years did not have a statistically significant effect on the 
outcome.  The  remainder  of  the  covariates  were  included  in  the final  mode.  The  interaction  between 
treatment  arms  and  platinum  sensitivity  was  not  statistically  significant.  Subjects  with  an  ECOG 
performance  status  score  of  0  or  who  were  platinum-sensitive  were  at  a  lower  risk  of  disease 
progression. The hazard ratio for the treatment effect is 0.763 (95% CI: 0.59;0.99), which represents a 
24%  reduction  in  risk  of  disease  progression  or  death  after  adjustment  for  potential  confounding 
factors. Similar results were obtained from oncologist and investigators reviews.

The importance of the imbalanced prognostic factors observed (Age, ECOG and ascites) on the PFS 
and OS was uncertain. In order to correctly show the effect of the imbalanced prognostic factors, the 
MAH was requested to submit further analyses of univariate results for treatment effect, multivariate 
approach  for  main  effects  and  multivariate  approach  for  evaluation  of  interaction  effects.  Each 
analysis  included  at  least  the  variable  (treatment  group,  ECOG  PS,  Platinum  sensitivity,  Ascite  and 
Bulky disease), hazard ratio, 95% CI & p-value. These data reinforced the overall conclusion that the 
combination  trabectedin  +  PLD  arm  has  a  significant  effect  independent  from  the  effect  of  the 
covariates  and,  in  consequence,  the  results  have  not  been  influenced  by  the  imbalances  observed  in 
some baseline patient characteristics. Moreover, the results of the additional analyses on the impact of 
ascites  (yes  vs.  no),  together  with  an  exploratory  multivariate  analysis  addressing  the  combined 
potential influence of baseline ascites and platinum-free interval, do not suggest a negative impact of 
these  prognostic  factors  on  the  treatment  effects  favouring  the  trabectedin  +  PLD  combination  in 
OVA-301. 
1.4.2.2.  Supportive studies  
OVA-301  results  are  supported  by  data  from  trabectedin  administered  as  a  single-agent  using  three 
different regimens (two every-3-week schedules, q3wk 3-h and q3wk 24-h, and one weekly schedule, 
qwk 3-h) in three phase II clinical trials: ET-B-026-03, ET-B-009-99 and ET743-INT-11. The efficacy

Study  ET-B-026-03  was  a  multicentre,  two-arm,  randomised,  controlled,  phase  II  clinical  trial 
evaluating  two  schedules  of  trabectedin  administered  to  a  relapsed,  platinum-sensitive,  advanced 
ovarian cancer population. The primary objective was to determine the optimal regimen of trabectedin 
when infused over a 24-hour or 3-hour infusion in an every-3-weeks schedule by evaluating objective 
response rate. As of February 2007, 107 (100 evaluable patients planned) were treated and randomly 
assigned to either a q3wk 24-h regimen at 1.5 mg/m2 (Arm A, n=54) or a q3wk 3-h regimen at 1.3 
mg/m2 (Arm B, n=53).  
In the ITT primary analysis, which included all randomised patients, the ORR was 38.9% (95% CI, 
25.9-53.1%) in Arm A and 35.8% (95% CI, 23.1-50.2%) in Arm B. Whilst not powered statistically in 
its design to compare efficacy outcomes in either arm, an exploratory analysis revealed no statistically 
significant differences between treatment arms with respect to ORR (p=0.8422). Twelve patients (6 in 
each treatment arm) achieved complete response and 28 patients (15 patients in Arm A and 13 patients 
in Arm B) achieved partial response.  
In  an  exploratory  analysis,  no  statistically  significant  differences  were  seen  between  treatment  arms 
for any of the secondary time-to-event endpoints, which included duration of response, TTP and PFS. 
Observed  toxicities  were  similar  as  well,  with  the  3-hour  infusion  having  a  slightly  lower  rate  of 
myelosuppression  (55  vs.  37%  of  grade  3/4  neutropenia)  and  less  fatigue,  thus  resulting  the  3-hour 
infusion schedule more convenient for patients. 
Based  on  these  results,  no  additional  comparisons  between  these  two  trabectedin  every-3-week 
schedules were deemed warranted. Trabectedin infusion every three weeks had promising activity in 
advanced ovarian cancer patients previously treated with a platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimen. 
Study  ET-B-009-99  was  a  multicentre,  single-arm,  open-label,  two-step  phase  II  trial.  The  primary 
objective was to determine the antitumour activity (in terms of ORR) of trabectedin administered as a 
3-hour  i.v.  infusion  (q3wk  3-h  regimen)  as  a  salvage  therapy  in  ovarian  cancer  patients  failing  one 
platinum-taxane containing regimen. Patients with persistent or recurrent ovarian cancer were eligible. 
As  required  by  the  protocol,  all  patients  had  received  therapy  with  platinum-  and  taxane-containing 
regimens. Refractory patients were defined in this study as those with progression on chemotherapy or 
within 6 months from the discontinuation of previous chemotherapy. Relapsed patients were defined 
as  those  having  relapsed  following  an  objective  response  to  platinum-taxane  chemotherapy,  with  an

interval    6  months  between  the  last  dose  received  and  the  documentation  of  relapse.  Fifty-nine 
patients  were  enrolled  overall:  29  patients  in  the  relapsing  group  and  30  in  the  refractory  group,  of 
whom  51  were  evaluable  for  efficacy.  The  first  six  patients  received  a  higher  initial  dose  (1.65 
mg/m2).  Due  to  the  poor  tolerance  of  this  dose,  the  study  was  amended  to  include  a  lower  starting 
dose. The remaining patients received trabectedin 1.3 mg/m2 every 3 weeks, which was well tolerated. 
However, 12 patients received an initial dose of 1.5 mg/m2.  
ORR  (per  RECIST  and  peer-review  evaluated)  was  43.5%  (95%  CI,  23.3-65.5%)  for  the  relapsing 
patient group (with one complete response and nine partial responses) and 7.1% (95% CI, 0.9-23.5%) 
for  the  refractory  patient  group,  TTP  for  relapsed  patient  group  was  6.7  months  (95%  CI,  5.0-7.9 
months).  
Study ET743-INT-11 was a multicentre, single-arm, open-label phase II trial. Trabectedin 0.58 mg/m2 
was  administered  as  a  3-hour  infusion weekly  (qwk  3-h)  for  the first  3  weeks  of  a  4-week  cycle.  A 
total  of  147 patients  were  accrued  and  treated,  including  51  patients  with  platinum-sensitive  disease 
and 62 patients with platinum-resistant disease in the primary efficacy analysis. 
The primary objective of this study was to determine the ORR in patients with platinum-sensitive and 
platinum-resistant advanced ovarian cancer after treatment with trabectedin, administered as a 3-hour 
infusion at the starting dose of 0.58 mg/m2 every week for 3 weeks of a 4-week cycle. Patients with 
platinum-sensitive ovarian carcinoma had disease progression > 6 months after cessation of platinum-
based chemotherapy, whereas patients with platinum-resistant ovarian carcinoma were defined in this 
study  as  those  with  disease  progression  during  treatment  or  disease  relapse  at    6  months  after 
cessation of platinum-based chemotherapy. 
The ORR was 29.4% (95% CI, 17.5-43.8%) for the platinum-sensitive cohort and 4.8% (95% CI, 1.0-
13.5%) for the platinum-resistant cohort. Median PFS and OS for the platinum-sensitive cohort were 
5.3  months  (95%  CI,  3.1-6.4  months)  and  17.1  months  (95%  CI;  14.3  months-upper  level  not 
reached), respectively. 
1.4.2.3.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Integrated  analysis  of  PFS  data  from  all  three  phase  II  trials  evaluating  trabectedin  as  single-agent 
treatment in patients with relapsed ovarian cancer is shown in next table. Median PFS of the integrated 
q3wk regimens for the 3-hour or the 24-hour i.v. infusions were very similar: 5.5 months (range, 4.6-
6.9) for the 3-hour infusion and 6.0 months (range, 4.6-8.6) for the 24-hour infusion. In contrast, PFS 
for the qwk 3-hour treatment regimen was shorter, with a median of 2.8 months (range, 2.0-3.8).

1.4.2.4.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
ET743-OVA-301  was  a  well-conducted  phase  III  trial  comparing  Caelyx  with  Caelyx/trabectedin  in 
663 patients with relapsed ovarian cancer. The primary endpoint PFS showed a clear advantage for the 
combination therapy whichever dataset was used. With the most conservative assessment a 21% risk 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reduction  for  the  PFS  endpoint  could  be  considered  evidence  of  activity  of  trabectedin  (this  is  also 
supported by phase II data). However, the absolute magnitude of PFS prolongation (about 1.5 months) 
is  not  impressive  considering  that  there  is  no  clear  support  of  overall  survival  prolongation.  Final 
overall  survival  analysis  is  pending,  since  it  only  will  performed  when  520  deaths  are  observed. 
Whereas  PFS  may  be  a  valid  surrogate  for  the  OS  endpoint  in  first-line  treatment  (chemo-naïve 
patients) this correlation may not be well substantiated in later-line therapy situations and that is the 
main weakness of the application dossier. 
The  magnitude  of  PFS  gain  (6-8  weeks)  and  the  HR  (0.72-0.79)  in  favour  of  the  combination  of 
trabectedin  +  PLD  observed  in  the  OVA-301  trial  do  not  differ  from  efficacy  results  of  other 
randomised  trials  in  comparable  populations  of  women  with  ovarian  carcinoma.  A  number  of 
sensitivity  analyses  support  the  robustness  of  the  PFS  endpoint.  At  the  request  of  the  CHMP,  the 
importance of the imbalanced prognostic factors observed (Age, ECOG and ascites) on the PFS and 
OS  has  been  further  analysed.  In  summary,  these  data  reinforce  the  overall  conclusion  that  the 
combination  trabectedin  +  PLD  arm  has  a  significant  effect  independent  from  the  effect  of  the 
covariates  and,  in  consequence,  the  results  have  not  been  influenced  by  the  imbalances  observed  in 
some baseline patient characteristics. Moreover, the results of the additional analyses on the impact of 
ascites  (yes  vs.  no),  together  with  an  exploratory  multivariate  analysis  addressing  the  combined 
potential influence of baseline ascites  and platinum-free interval, do not suggest a negative impact of 
these  prognostic  factors  on  the  treatment  effects  favouring  the  trabectedin  +  PLD  combination  in 
OVA-301. 
Moreover,  the  difference  in  PLD  dosing  schedule  was  of  concern.  In  the  combination  arm,  PLD  is 
given  every  three  weeks,  compared  to  every  four  weeks  in  the  monotherapy  arm,  raising  doubts  on 
whether  the  effect  seen  in  the  combination  arm  is  actually  an  effect  of  treating  with  PLD  more 
frequently.  Thus,  the  actual  benefit  of  adding  Yondelis  to  PLD  could  be  less  than  1.5  months  PFS 
gain. The two parameters better correlated with the efficacy of PLD are dose intensity and Cmax. Both 
were  substantially  greater  in  the  control  arm  than  in  the  combination  arm,  favouring  an  enhanced 
efficacy of PLD in the control arm. Thus, the more frequent administration of PLD at lower doses in 
the  combination  arm  is  an  unlikely  explanation  for  the  improved  outcomes  demonstrated  with 
trabectedin + PLD in OVA-301. Therefore, such superior outcomes with the combination support the 
contribution  of  trabectedin,  an  agent  with  proven  single  agent  activity  in  advanced  relapsed  ovarian 
cancer. 
As  previously  stated  there  is  clear  evidence  of  antitumour  activity  of  the  combination  of  PLD  and 
trabectedin and provided that a significant improvement in overall survival support the PFS endpoint 
this would be considered sufficient evidence of benefit in terms of efficacy.  
Further  reassurance  on  the  maturity  of  the  OS  data  was  needed.  The  protocol-specified  interim 
analysis of overall survival (OS) was carried out with 300 events, and even though the data are clearly 
immature,  a  favourable  trend  appears  for  the  combination  (HR=0.85)  and  survival  curves  remain 
separated  throughout  the  entire  observation  period. The  MAH  conducted  an  ad  hoc  interim  analysis 
with approximately 80% death events (416 of the required 520 deaths at the cut-off date of 31 May 
2009 when a total of 419 death events (215 in the PLD monotherapy arm and 204 in the trabectedin + 
PLD combination arm) had occurred).  This represents 81% of the 520 death  events required for the 
final OS analysis, or 62% of the 672 randomised population. Due to the larger number of events, the p 
value is now 0.0920. Median OS was identical at 19.5 months in PLD monotherapy arm, but is now 
22.4 months, i.e., a 3-month difference with the combination arm.   
The  benefit  in  terms  of  PFS  prolongation  appeared  more  evident  in  the  subset  of  patients  with 
platinum-sensitive disease as compared to patients with platinum-resistant disease. This finding does 
not  in  itself have  a  negative  impact  of  the  overall  conclusion  on  clinical  efficacy  but  the  population 
with platinum-resistant disease has the highest medical need whereas patients with platinum-sensitive 
disease may have a second treatment cycle with tumour response. However, Study OVA 301 was not 
powered  to  detect  differences  in  outcome  according  to  platinum-resistance  status.  The  result  of  a 
multivariate  analysis  indicates  that  treatment  effect  and  platinum  sensitivity  acted  as  independent 
factors  with  influence  on  PFS.  Although  a  long  platinum-free  interval  points  to  a  better  outcome  in 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
terms of PFS as compared to a short interval (platinum-resistance), the CHMP agree that the benefit in 
the platinum-resistant subset cannot be ruled out. 
The fact that patients with platinum sensitive disease (as measured by a long platinum-free interval) 
still  have  the  option  to  be  retreated  with  a  platinum-containing  regimen  should  not  per  se  be  an 
obstacle for approving the combination of PLD and trabectedin. PLD was approved for“treatment of 
advanced  ovarian  cancer  in  women  who  have  failed  a  first-line  platinum-based  chemotherapy 
regimen”.  The  registration  study  for  PLD  with  topotecan  as  comparator  also  included  patients  with 
both  platinum-sensitive  and  platinum-refractory  disease.  However,  it  is  unfortunate  that  the 
performance of trabectedin + PLD against common practice (retreatment with platinum) is unknown. 
Superiority against the approved PLD has been demonstrated. Based on the Investigator’s assignment 
of platinum sensitivity, a subgroup analysis was conducted using the updated survival data. The effect 
of trabectedin + PLD combination was more pronounced in platinum-sensitive patients than in those 
with platinum-resistant disease, although in the resistant stratum both the HR=0.90 and median values 
(14.2 vs. 12.4 months) still favour the combination arm. 
1.4.3.  Clinical Safety 
1.4.3.1.  Patient exposure 
Safety data from Study ET743-OVA-301 comprise the principal information supporting the safety of 
trabectedin  in  combination  with  Caelyx  for  the  treatment  of  relapsed  ovarian  cancer.  Safety 
information from the 3 Phase 2 studies in subjects with relapsed ovarian cancer with trabectedin as a 
single agent provide the primary supporting data for the safety of trabectedin in this population.  
Thus, the main analyses of safety in this document are based on the following 3 safety analysis sets, 
which are derived from data from completed Phase 3 and Phase 2 studies:  
  Study ET743-OVA-301 safety analysis set (N=663) 
 
Integrated Phase 2 ovarian safety analysis set (N=295): Pooled data from the Phase 2 Studies 
ET743-INT-11,  ET-B-026-03,  and  ET-B-009-99  of  trabectedin  as  a  single  agent  in  women 
with  relapsed  ovarian  cancer.  Data  are  categorized  according  to  the  trabectedin  dosing 
schedule  and  starting  dosage:  1.3 mg/m2  q3wk 3-h, 1.5 mg/m2  q3wk  24-h,  and  0.58 mg/m2 
qwk 3-h.  
Integrated Phase 2 safety analysis set (N=1,132): Pooled data from the 19 Phase 2 studies of 
trabectedin as a single agent in various tumour types, including 3 Phase 2 studies in relapsed 
ovarian  cancer  analysed  separately  in  group  2,  and  16  Phase  2  studies  in  non-ovarian  solid 
tumours.  Data  are  categorized  according  to  the  trabectedin  dosing  schedule  and  starting 
dosage: 1.3 mg/m2 q3wk 3-h, 1.5 mg/m2 q3wk 24-h, and 0.58 mg/m2 qwk 3-h. 
 
The integrated safety analysis was based on data from 19 Phase 2 studies completed up to April 2008, 
and is presented as a full revised analysis.

In  general,  the  incidence  rates  for  Grade  3  or  4  adverse  events,  serious  adverse  events,  and  adverse 
events leading to discontinuation were higher for trabectedin administered in combination with Caelyx 
(Study  ET743-OVA-301)  compared  with  trabectedin  as  a  single  agent  in  the  target  indication  at  the 
proposed regimen (q3wk 3-h) for the integrated Phase 2 ovarian safety analysis set.

Gastrointestinal  disorders  were  the  most  common  adverse  events  in  Study  ET743-OVA-301.  While 
the  overall  incidence  of  these  disorders  were  similar  for  the  Caelyx  monotherapy  (83%)  and 
trabectedin  +  Caelyx  (89%)  arms,  the  frequencies  for  certain  of  these  events  differed  by  10% 
between  the  2 treatment  arms.  Specifically,  nausea  (42%  for  Caelyx  monotherapy  versus  74%  for 
trabectedin  +  Caelyx)  and  vomiting  (30%  for  Caelyx  monotherapy  versus  56%  for  trabectedin  + 
Caelyx)  were  reported  more  frequently  in  the  trabectedin  +  Caelyx  arm,  while  stomatitis  (33%  for 
Caelyx  monotherapy  versus  20%  for  trabectedin  +  Caelyx)  was  more  frequent  in  the  Caelyx 
monotherapy arm.

Blood and lymphatic system disorders were reported less frequently in the Caelyx monotherapy arm 
(55%) than in the trabectedin + Caelyx arm (88%). This was mainly due to a higher incidence for the 
trabectedin + Caelyx arm for neutropenia (38% for Caelyx monotherapy versus 77% for trabectedin + 
Caelyx),  leukopenia  (26%  for  Caelyx  monotherapy  versus  48%  for  trabectedin  +  Caelyx),  anaemia 
(25% for Caelyx monotherapy versus 48% for trabectedin + Caelyx), and thrombocytopenia (8% for 
Caelyx monotherapy versus 36% for trabectedin + Caelyx). 
Compared with the Caelyx monotherapy arm, the trabectedin + Caelyx arm had higher rates for ALT 
increased (9% for Caelyx monotherapy versus 55% for trabectedin + Caelyx), AST increased (10% for 
Caelyx monotherapy versus 40% for trabectedin + Caelyx), blood alkaline phosphatase increased (8% 
for  Caelyx  monotherapy  versus  23%  for  trabectedin  +  Caelyx),  and  hyperbilirubinemia  (7%  for 
Caelyx monotherapy versus 16% for trabectedin + Caelyx). 
Hand-foot  syndrome,  was  reported  by  more  than  one-half  (54%)  of  subjects  in  the  Caelyx 
monotherapy arm but occurred at a lower rate (24%) in the trabectedin + Caelyx arm.

Serious adverse events and deaths 
A  total  of  19  subjects  died  during  treatment  or  within  30  days of  the  last  dose  of  study medication, 
including 8 (2%) subjects in the Caelyx monotherapy arm and 11 (3%) subjects in the trabectedin + 
Caelyx  arm.  Twelve  (63%)  of  these  deaths  (6  in  each  treatment  arm)  were  the  result  of  disease 
progression. Deaths associated with adverse events occurred in 1 subject in the Caelyx monotherapy 
arm  (drug-related)  and  5 subjects  in  the  trabectedin  +  Caelyx  arm  (3  drug  related).  In  the  Caelyx 
monotherapy arm, the adverse event resulting in death was sepsis. The adverse events resulting in the 
death in the trabectedin + Caelyx arm were acute renal failure and neutropenic sepsis; pancytopenia 
and  sepsis;  thrombocytopenia  and  febrile  neutropenia;  pulmonary  embolism;  and  general  health 
deterioration.

In  Study  ET743-OVA-301,  31%  of  subjects  in  the  Caelyx  monotherapy  arm  and  39%  in  the 
trabectedin + Caelyx arm experienced at least 1 serious adverse event from the time of the first dose of 
study  medication  through  30  days  after  the  last  dose  of  study  drug.  Treatment  with  trabectedin  + 
Caelyx  was  associated  with  higher  frequencies  of  serious  blood  and  lymphatic  disorders,  vomiting, 
nausea,  ALT  increased,  and  AST  increased  compared  with  treatment  with  Caelyx  monotherapy. 
Neutropenia  and  thrombocytopenia  were  the  most  frequently  reported  serious  adverse  events  with 
trabectedin + Caelyx, reported by 8% and 6%, respectively. In the Caelyx monotherapy arm, intestinal 
obstruction and abdominal pain were the most frequent serious adverse events, each reported in 3% of 
subjects. 
Grade 4 serious adverse events reported for 1% of subjects in the trabectedin + Caelyx arm included 
neutropenia (n=22, 7%), thrombocytopenia (n=14, 4%), leukopenia (n=10, 3%), pulmonary embolism 
(n=7,  2%),  febrile  neutropenia  (n=3,  1%),  and  anaemia  (n=3,  1%).  In  the  Caelyx  monotherapy  arm, 
Grade  4  serious  adverse  events  reported  for  1%  or  more  of  subjects  were  neutropenia  (n=4,  1%), 
intestinal obstruction (n=3, 1%), leukopenia (n=3, 1%), and pulmonary embolism (n=2, 1%).

Table 27 - Treatment-Emergent Serious Adverse Events by Toxicity Grade in at Least 2% of Subjects  
(Study ET743-OVA-301: All-Treated Subjects Analysis Set) 
The MAH has identified the following safety topics for special consideration concerning the treatment 
with the trabectedin + Caelyx combination because of their potential for clinical importance: hepatic 
toxicity,  haematologic  toxicity  neutropenia  and  infection,  thrombocytopenia  and  bleeding  events, 
abdominal  pain,  CPK  elevations  and  rhabdomyolysis,  cardiac  safety,  renal  and  urinary  disorders, 
myelodysplasia  and  acute  myeloid  leukaemia,  extravasation,  respiratory  disorders,  other  events  - 
ototoxicity, neuropathy, and hypersensitivity.  
Hepatic toxicity 
Trabectedin therapy frequently causes liver function test abnormalities, mainly in the form of elevated 
serum  transaminases.  Transaminase  elevations  of  any  grade  were  experienced  by  >80%  of  subjects 
receiving trabectedin in clinical studies (alone or in combination with Caelyx). The MAH states that 
transaminase  elevations  in  subjects  receiving  trabectedin  +  Caelyx  followed  a  predictable  pattern  of 
rapid onset and reversibility and decreasing severity with succeeding cycles. There was no indication 
of cumulative toxicity.  Transaminase elevations with trabectedin were managed with dose delays or 
reductions,  using  guidelines  outlined  in  the  study  protocols.  In  the  pivotal  study,  no  subject  was 
withdrawn from treatment with the trabectedin + Caelyx combination due to increased ALT or AST, 
37 
 
 
reported  as  an  adverse  event,  and  5%  subjects  receiving  the  combination  treatment  had  a  dose 
reduction or cycle delay as a result of increased ALT or AST.  
In  the  main  study  most  subjects  in  the  trabectedin  +  Caelyx  arm  had  an  elevation  (Grade  1  to  4)  in 
ALT  (96%)  or  AST  (89%)  at  some  point  during  the  study,  although  only  5%  and  2%  of  subjects 
receiving trabectedin + Caelyx had Grade 4 ALT or AST elevation, respectively. Elevations in ALT 
and AST were seen in 36% and 43% of subjects in the Caelyx monotherapy arm. Additionally, in this 
study, Hy’s Law criteria were used to predict hepatotoxicity. 
Table 28 – Summary Hy’s Law Cases – by Treatment Group  
(Study ET743-OVA-301: All-Treated Subjects Analysis Set) 
As seem in the above table, in the trabectedin +Caelyx arm, 3 subjects met the criteria. Two hundred 
forty-four  subjects  in  the  trabectedin  +  Caelyx  arm  had  an  elevated  ALT  or  AST  level  that  was  ≥3 
times  ULN  and  had  an  ALP  value  ≤2  times  ULN.  Three  (1%)  of  these  subjects  had  an  increased 
bilirubin that was ≥2 times ULN. Of the 3 subjects who met the criteria for Hy’s law, none developed 
serious hepatotoxicity. Two had subsequent therapy and died from disease progression, and 1 subject 
is still in the follow-up phase of the study.

Haematologic toxicity neutropenia and infection 
Neutropenia was the most common haematological laboratory abnormality. The incidence of grade 3/4 
neutropenia  cases  evaluated  as  drug-related  AEs  (63%)  was  higher  in  the  trabectedin  plus  PLD  arm 
compared with PLD alone (22%). In OVA-301, nadir grade 3 or 4 neutrophil values typically occurred 
within two weeks of dosing and were resolved among patients receiving trabectedin plus PLD.  The 
MAH states that this pattern was similar regardless of cycle, indicating a lack of cumulative toxicity 
(see  figure  below)  Compared  with  PLD  alone,  grade  3  or  4  neutropenia  developed  earlier  in  the 
combination arm (Day 15 vs. Day 22) but could had a similar duration (eight days in both study arms). 
Neutropenia  was  managed  with  dose  delays  and  reductions,  using  guidelines  outlined  in  the  study 
protocol.  Antibiotics  were  given  as  concomitant  therapy  in  20%  of  patients  for  both  study  arms. 
Growth  factors  were  given  in  OVA-301  prophylactically  according  to  ASCO  guidelines,  and  they 
were used more frequently in the combination arm (42% of patients/26% of cycles) than in the PLD 
alone arm (17% of patients/8% of cycles). The use of growth factors varied substantially according to 
the geographical area, with the lowest percentage in the European countries (26% of patients/12% of 
cycles)  compared  with  the  United  States  of  America  where  these  factors  are  more  frequently 
administered in clinical practice (47% of patients/35% of cycles). Drug-related febrile neutropenia was 
experienced by 7% and 2% of patients in the combination arm and in the PLD alone arm, respectively. 
Sepsis, septic shock or sepsis syndrome were reported in 2 patients (<1%) in the combination arm and 
in 4 patients (1%) in the PLD alone arm. 4% of patients with drug-related neutropenia discontinued 
the study due to this AE.

grade 3/4 cases; right graph: median nadir values during the first 6 cycles (OVA-301 study). 
Thrombocytopenia and Bleeding Events 
In  the  trabectedin  +  Caelyx  arm,  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  Grade  3  or  4  platelet  count 
abnormalities  was  4%  in  Cycle  1  and  increased  to  7%  in  Cycle  2  where  it  remained  stable  through 
Cycle 8 (5% to 7%). For Grade 4 platelet counts in the trabectedin + Caelyx arm, the median time to 
first  occurrence  was  57  days  (range:  11,  294)  and  the  median  duration  was  7  days  (range:  2,  27). 
Bleeding-related adverse events ere reported in a similar percent of subjects in the Caelyx (8%) and 
trabectedin + Caelyx (9%) arms of Study ET743-OVA-301. 2 subjects in the trabectedin + Caelyx arm 
(0.6%; none in Caelyx arm) had a drug-related Grade 3 or 4 bleeding-related adverse event. 
In  the  Caelyx  monotherapy  arm,  the  proportion  of  subjects  who  had  Grade  3  or  4  laboratory 
abnormalities  in  Cycles  1  to  6  ranged  from  0  to  2%  for  platelet  counts  and  from  1%  to  3%  for 
haemoglobin.  Of  the  27  subjects  in  the  Caelyx  monotherapy  arm  with  Grade  3  or  4  haemoglobin 
abnormalities, the percentage of subjects who received treatment with blood or blood related products 
(n=7, 26%), blood transfusions (n=5, 19%), or other antianaemic drugs (n=1, 4%) was lower than in 
the trabectedin + Caelyx arm. Among subjects receiving the trabectedin + Caelyx combination, cycle 
delays  due  to  thrombocytopenia  reported  as  an  adverse  event  were  more  common  (13%)  than 
40 
 
 
 
 
treatment  withdrawals  (3%)  or  dose  reductions  (5%).  One  percent  or  less  of  subjects  in  the  Caelyx 
to 
monotherapy  arm  had  a  cycle  delay,  dose  reduction,  or 
thrombocytopenia reported as an adverse event. 
treatment  discontinued  due 
CPK Elevations/Rhabdomyolysis 
In the early phase II studies with single-agent trabectedin treatment, rhabdomyolysis and/or elevations 
in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) (grade 1-4) were associated with death in three patients (studies ET-
B-008-98  and  ET-B-005-98,  269  patients  treated,  1%),  commonly  as  a  component  of  a  syndrome 
which  included  neutropenia,  sepsis,  renal  failure  and  elevated  liver  enzymes.  Thereafter,  strict 
monitoring of liver function tests and CPK levels and dose adjustment guidelines were implemented in 
all  ongoing  and  subsequently  initiated  clinical  studies,  including  OVA-301.  Rhabdomyolysis  is  a 
known risk discussed in several sections of the Summary of Product Characteristics of trabectedin. In 
OVA-301, grade 3/4 CPK elevations were uncommon: 2% for the trabectedin plus PLD arm of OVA-
301  (0%  in  the  PLD  arm)  and  3%  for  the  integrated  phase  II  ovarian  safety  analysis  set.  In  the 
trabectedin + Caelyx arm, 1 subject (<1%) had a dose reduction and 4 subjects (1%) had a cycle delay 
as a result of increased CPK. Two subjects in the trabectedin + Caelyx arm had treatment discontinued 
as a result of increased CPK 
Cardiac Safety 
In Study ET743-OVA-301, MUGA scans or 2-D echocardiograms were performed in 369 subjects at 
screening  and  at  the  end  of  treatment  termination.  There  was  no  indication  that  the  addition  of 
trabectedin increased the known cardiac safety profile of Caelyx in the Phase  3 study ET743-OVA-
301 or the Phase 1 Study ET743-USA-11. 
Extravasation-Related Adverse Events 
Extravasation-related adverse events following injection of trabectedin were uncommon in all 3 safety 
analysis  sets,  reported  for  1%  of  subjects  receiving  trabectedin  +  Caelyx  in  Study  ET743-OVA-301 
and 4 to 6% of subjects receiving single-agent trabectedin in the Phase 2 integrated safety analysis sets 
Respiratory Disorders 
Serious respiratory-related disorders were reported for 5% to 7% of trabectedin-treated subjects in the 
Study  ET743-OVA-301  safety  analysis  set  and  the  integrated  Phase  2  safety  analysis  set.  Most  of 
these serious respiratory-related disorders were assessed by the investigator as not drug related 
Myelodysplasia and Acute Myeloid Leukaemia 
No subject treated in Study ET743-OVA-301 developed treatment-emergent acute myeloid leukaemia or 
myelodysplasia within 30 days of the last dose of study medication. Subject 280065 in the trabectedin + 
Caelyx arm was discontinued due to neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Approximately 2 weeks later, 
the  subject  underwent  a  bone  marrow  biopsy  due  to  persistent  hematological  abnormalities,  which 
revealed acute myeloid leukaemia. The subject died approximately 99 days after the last dose of study 
drug  and  the  cause  of  death  were  pneumonia,  neutropenia,  and  acute  myeloid  leukaemia.  A  second 
subject  (140005)  who  received  13  cycles  of  Caelyx  monotherapy  was  diagnosed  with  acute  myeloid 
leukaemia 95 days after the last dose of study drug. The subject died 3 months and 12 days later due to 
disease progression 
Laboratory findings 
In Study ET743-OVA-301, compared with the Caelyx monotherapy arm, a higher proportion of subjects 
in the trabectedin + Caelyx arm had abnormal neutrophil counts (74% versus 92%, respectively), platelet 
counts (27% versus 64%, respectively), and WBC counts (82% versus 95%, respectively). 
White blood cell count abnormalities were frequent in all 3 safety analysis sets. In Study ET743-OVA-
301,  62%  of  subjects  in  the  trabectedin  +  Caelyx  arm  had  Grade  3  or  4  WBC  count  abnormalities, 
compared  with  20%  of  subjects  in  the  Caelyx  monotherapy  arm.  The  incidence  rate  of  Grade  3  or  4 
WBC count abnormalities was also higher for the trabectedin + Caelyx arm of Study ET743-OVA-301 
compared  with  trabectedin  as  a  single  agent  in  the  q3wk  3-h  treatment  arm  of  the  integrated  Phase  2 
ovarian safety analysis set (29%) and the integrated Phase 2 safety analysis set (30%). The incidence of 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Grade 3 or 4 WBC count abnormalities in the q3wk 24-h arm of the integrated Phase 2 safety analysis 
set was 49%. 
In  the  pivotal  study,  the  incidence  rates  of  mineral/electrolyte  non-haematologic  abnormalities  were 
similar in the trabectedin + Caelyx and Caelyx monotherapy arms, with the exception of low potassium, 
which was higher in the combination arm (42% versus 28%, respectively).  
Grade  3  or  4  mineral/electrolyte  non-haematologic  abnormalities  in  Study  ET743-OVA-301  were 
equally infrequent in both treatment arms; the most common were low sodium (9%) and low potassium 
(8%) for the trabectedin + Caelyx arm and low sodium (9%) and elevated potassium (6%) for the Caelyx 
monotherapy arm. 
1.4.3.3.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Almost all patients experienced drug related AEs. The safety profile of the combination treatment is 
characterised  by  the  high  percentage  of  adverse  events  (99%),  which  includes  as  more  relevant 
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, AST/ALT increases, hyperbilirubinemia, CPK elevations and 
rhabdomyolysis. The percentages of adverse events observed in the trabectedin group were sometimes 
as much as 2 times higher than in the trabectedin/Caelyx group. The most common AEs observed in 
all the patients were the gastrointestinal disorders, with the highest percentage of nausea and vomiting 
in the trabectedin group. 
All the effects mentioned above have been already described in the initial marketing authorisation for 
soft tissue sarcoma. No new relevant data has been shown. It is acknowledged that the majority of the 
serious  AEs,  such  as  neutropenia,  thrombocytopenia,  anemia  and  AST/ALT  increases,  can  be 
managed  with  the  appropriate  dose  reduction  and/or  delays  in  the  cycles.  However,  the  laboratory 
findings  appear  to  be  consistent  with  relevant  clinical  implications,  such  as  increased  risk  of  febrile 
neutropenia.  
The rate of drug related AEs, serious adverse events, deaths, AEs leading to the discontinuation, and 
laboratory values, are without a doubt higher in the trabectedin/Caelyx group. 
A  higher  incidence  observed  in  drug-related  grade  3  or  4  AEs,  SAEs  and  drug-related  SAEs 
(especially  within  the  Blood  and  Lymphatic  system)  for  the  non-white  population  (Asian  race)  was 
observed. This is reflected in section 4.8 of the SPC. 
The overall clinical safety assessment of the proposed combination of  trabectedin + Caelyx does not 
cause any major concern per se since the toxicity profile is predictable from the known safety profiles 
for both substances and such toxicity is routine management  in oncology centers. The most important 
additive toxicity is neutropenia and infection-related adverse events due to neutropenia with increasing 
frequency and severity with the combination as compared to both agents used as monotherapy. Any 
potential safety concern of the combination should be evaluated in the context of risk/benefit.  
1.5. 
Risk Management Plan 
An updated Risk Management Plan (RMP) was submitted in this variation application. The EU-RMP 
version 6.0 follows the guideline and has included the updated information regarding trabectedin use. 
The addition of safety data from the use of trabectedin in combination with PLD has revealed a higher 
risk of bone marrow suppression and a higher need for concomitant anti-emetic treatment. A summary 
of the RMP is provided in the table below.

Section 4.6: Pregnancy and lactation 
 No sufficient clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. However 
based  on  its  known  mechanism  of  action,  trabectedin  may  cause  serious 
birth defects when administered during pregnancy. Trabectedin should not 
be  used  during  pregnancy  unless  clearly  necessary.    If  it  is  used,  the 
patient  must  be  informed  of  the  potential  risk  to  the  foetus  (see  Section 
5.3)  and  be  monitored  carefully.  If  trabectedin  is  used  at  the  end  of 
pregnancy,  potential  adverse  reactions  should  be  monitored  carefully  in 
the  newborns  Men  in  fertile  age  and  women  of  childbearing  potential 
must use effective contraception during treatment and 3 months thereafter 
for women and immediately inform the treating physician if a pregnancy 
occurs (see Section 5.3) and 5 months after treatment for men (see Section 
4.4).  Trabectedin  can  have  genotoxic  effects.  Advice  on  conservation  of 
sperm  should  be  sought  prior  to  treatment  because  of  the  possibility  of 
irreversible  infertility  due  to  therapy  with  Yondelis.  If  pregnancy  occurs 
during  treatment  the  possibility  of  genetic  counselling  should  be 
considered. Genetic counselling is also recommended for patients wishing 
to have children after therapy.

Section 4.5:  Interaction with other medicinal products 
In vivo interaction studies have not been performed. Since trabectedin is 
metabolised  mainly  by  CYP3A4,  co-administration  of  substances  that 
inhibit 
isoenzyme  e.g.  ketoconazole,  fluconazole  ritonavir  or 
clarithromycin  could  decrease  metabolism  and  increase  trabectedin 
concentrations.  If  such  combinations  are  needed,  close  monitoring  of 
toxicities  is  required  (see  Section  4.4).  Likewise  co-administration  with 
potent  inducers  of  this  enzyme  (e.g.  rifampicin,  phenorbarbital,  Saint 
John’s Wort) may decrease the systemic exposure to trabectedin.  
Alcohol  consumption  must  be  avoided  during  treatment  with  trabectedin 
due to the hepatotoxicity of the medicinal product (see Section 4.4). 
Preclinical data have demonstrated that trabectedin is a substrate to P-gp. 
Concomitant  administration  of  inhibitors  of  Pgp,  e.g.  cyclosporine  and 
verapamil,  may  alter  trabectedin  distribution  and/or  elimination.  The 
relevance  of  this  interaction  e.g.  CNS  toxicity  has  not  been  established. 
Caution should be taken in such situations.

Benefit-risk assessment 
Benefits  
In  a  well-conducted  phase  III  trial  (OVA-301)  comparing  Caelyx  with  Caelyx/trabectedin  in  663 
patients with relapsed ovarian cancer, the primary efficacy endpoint PFS showed a clear advantage for 
the  combination  therapy  whichever  dataset  was  used.  With  the  most  conservative  assessment 
(independent  radiologist  in  patients  with  measurable  disease)  a  21%  risk  reduction  for  the  PFS 
endpoint  could  be  considered  evidence  of  activity  of  trabectedin  (this  is  also  supported  by  phase  II 
data). However, the absolute magnitude of PFS prolongation (about 1.5 months) from 5.8 months to 
7.3 months is not impressive considering that there is no clear support of overall survival prolongation. 
Final  overall  survival  analysis  is  pending,  since  it  will  only  be  performed  when  520  deaths  are 
observed. The increase in PFS is not linked to an improvement in QoL. The QoL data neither support 
nor  challenge  the  efficacy/safety  assessment.  The  pivotal  study  was  not  blinded  and  QoL  data  are 
often not very sensitive. However, the addition of trabectedin does not seem to worsen the QoL. 
The  magnitude  of  PFS  gain  (6-8  weeks)  and  the  HR  (0.72-0.79)  in  favour  of  the  combination  of 
trabectedin  +  PLD  observed  in  the  OVA-301  trial  do  not  differ  from  efficacy  results  of  other 
randomised  trials  in  comparable  populations  of  women  with  ovarian  carcinoma.  A  number  of 
sensitivity  analyses  support  the  robustness  of  the  PFS  endpoint.  However,  the  importance  of  the 
imbalanced  prognostic  factors  observed  (Age,  ECOG  and  ascites)  on  the  PFS  and  OS  was  further 
analysed.  Results  seem  to  be  robust  in  the  sense  that  the  imbalances  do  not  affect  the  global  PFS 
results.   
As  previously  stated  there  is  clear  evidence  of  antitumour  activity  of  the  combination  of  PLD  and 
trabectedin and provided that a significant improvement in overall survival support the PFS endpoint 
this would be considered sufficient evidence of benefit in terms of efficacy. 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Thus, further reassurance on the maturity of the OS data was needed. The protocol-specified interim 
analysis of overall survival (OS) was carried out with 300 events, and even though the data are clearly 
immature,  a  favourable  trend  appears  for  the  combination  (HR=0.85)  and  survival  curves  remain 
separated throughout the entire observation period. The MAH conducted an ad hoc interim analysis of 
the secondary endpoint OS with a prospectively established cutoff date of 31 May 2009 when a total 
of 419 death events (215 in the PLD monotherapy arm and 204 in the trabectedin + PLD combination 
arm) had occurred. This represents 81% of the 520 death events required for the final OS analysis, or 
62% of the 672 randomised population. Current follow-up ranges from April 2005 to May 2009. The 
trabectedin + PLD combination resulted in a 15% decrease in the risk of death compared  with PLD 
alone  [HR=0.85  (95%  CI,  0.70-1.03);  p=0.0920].  The  median  OS  was  19.5 months  (95%  CI,  17.4-
22.1) in the PLD monotherapy arm and 22.4 months (95% CI, 19.4-25.1) in the combination arm  
The  study  OVA  301  was  not  powered  to  detect  differences  in  outcome  according  to  platinum-
resistance  status.  The  results  of  a  multivariate  analysis  indicate  that  treatment  effect  and  platinum 
sensitivity acted as independent factors with influence on PFS. Although a long platinum-free interval 
points to a better outcome in terms of PFS as compared to a short interval (platinum-resistance) the 
CHMP agree that the benefit in the platinum-resistant subset cannot be ruled out. 
The fact that patients with platinum sensitive disease (as measured by a long platinum-free interval) 
still  have  the  option  to  be  retreated  with  a  platinum-containing  regimen  should  not  per  se  be  an 
obstacle for approving the combination of PLD and trabectedin. PLD was approved for“ treatment of 
advanced  ovarian  cancer  in  women  who  have  failed  a  first-line  platinum-based  chemotherapy 
regimen”.  The  registration  study  for  PLD  with  topotecan  as  comparator  also  included  patients  with 
both  platinum-sensitive  and  platinum-refractory  disease.  However,  it  is  unfortunate  that  the 
performance of trabectedin + PLD against common practice (retreatment with platinum) is unknown. 
Superiority against the approved PLD has been demonstrated. The design and inclusion criteria of the 
pivotal  trial  OVA-302  have  been  sufficiently  detailed  in  section  5.1  of  the  SPC.  In  the  updated 
analysis the survival benefit appears enhanced in the stratum of platinum-sensitive patients, where PFS 
HR was 0.73 (p=0.0170) and OS HR was 0.82 (p=0.1259) in the updated analysis. Of interest, in the 
subpopulation  of  patients  with  intermediate  platinum-sensitivity  (PFI  6-12  months),  an  exploratory 
analysis  shows  the  largest  differential  effect  favouring  the  trabectedin  combination  with  a  41% 
reduction in the risk of death (HR=0.59; p=0.0015) and a 6 month increase in median survival. 
Risks 
No  new  or  unexpected  serious  adverse  events  were  seen  with  the  trabectedin  +  Caelyx  combination 
relative to administration of Caelyx monotherapy or trabectedin alone. 
The overall clinical safety assessment of the proposed combination of trabectedin + Caelyx does not 
cause any major concern per se since the toxicity profile is predictable from the known safety profiles 
of both substances and such toxicity is routine management in oncology centres. The most important 
additive toxicity is neutropenia and infection-related adverse events due to neutropenia with increasing 
frequency and severity with the combination as compared to both agents used as monotherapy. Any 
potential  safety  concern  of  the  combination  should  be  evaluated  in  the  context  of  risk/benefit.  Two 
percent (2%) of subjects in the Caelyx arm developed Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia versus 8% in 
the  trabectedin  +  Caelyx  arm.  Sepsis,  septic  shock,  or  sepsis  syndrome  were  reported  in  4  subjects 
(1.2%) in the Caelyx monotherapy arm and 2 subjects (0.6%) in the trabectedin + Caelyx arm. 
Other  concerns  are  more  thrombocytopenia  with  the  combination,  more  elevations  in  liver 
transaminases and more elevations in CPK (and rhabdomyolysis in rare cases) due to the toxicity of 
trabectedin. These aspects have been sufficiently addressed in the RMP and the SPC.

Balance 
The  magnitude  of  PFS  gain  (6-8  weeks)  and  the  HR  (0.72-0.79)  in  favour  of  the  combination  of 
trabectedin  +  PLD  observed  in  the  OVA-301  trial  do  not  differ  from  efficacy  results  of  other 
randomised  trials  in  comparable  populations  of  women  with  ovarian  carcinoma.  A  number  of 
sensitivity  analyses  support  the  robustness  of  the  PFS  endpoint.  As  previously  stated  there  is  clear 
evidence  of  antitumour  activity  of  the  combination  of  PLD  and  trabectedin.  The  updated  ad  hoc 
interim analysis on overall survival provided further reassurance on the validity of the PFS endpoint. 
Further, the MAH has made a commitment to provide the final results from the ongoing study OVA-
301 for review by CHMP when available. 
It  is  agreed  that  although  toxicity  of  the  two-drug  combination  is  more  pronounced  than  with  PLD 
alone  it  is  not  very  different  from  the  toxicity  seen  after  other  two-drug  combinations  for  the  same 
therapeutic indication. The safety profile of trabectedin and the combination is by no means unusual or 
frightening considering the therapeutic indication. 
The  benefit-risk  balance  of  Yondelis  in  combination  with  pegylated  liposomal  doxorubicin (PLD)  in 
the treatment of patients with relapsed platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, is considered positive. 
As  a  consequence,  sections  4.1,  4.2,  4.4,  4.8,  5.1,  5.2  and  6.6  of  the  SPC  have  been  updated.  The 
Package  Leaflet  has  been  updated  accordingly.  Further,  annex  II  has  been  updated  to  include  the 
agreed version 6.0 of the RMP. 
Furthermore,  the  CHMP  reviewed  the  data  and  justifications  submitted  by  the  MAH  taking  into 
account the provisions of Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004, and taking into account the 
provisions  of  the  “Guidance  on  elements  required  to  support  the  significant  clinical  benefit  in 
comparison  with  existing  therapies  of  a  new  therapeutic  indication  in  order  to  benefit  from  an 
extended (11-year) marketing protection period (November 2007)”, and did not consider that the new 
therapeutic indication brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. (EMEA 
note: This refers to the extension of the marketing protection but has no impact on the orphan status 
and its incentives, which is reviewed by the COMP.)
